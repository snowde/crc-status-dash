Sophia H.,"Sacramento, CA",143,122,273,3.0,6/16/2015,"I came here with my cousins and friends to celebrate my cousins MPA graduation. We had a party of 12 people and ordered some appetizers, drinks and desserts. Our first waitress was either having a bad day or just really had a bad attitude but she definitely wasn't pleasant. The manager was also very rude and later on in the night he started to come around more and put his manager face on. We really did not enjoy our night there until our new waitress Stephanie came around. She was amazing and we loved her. If it wasn't for her this review would def have 1 star. We had to repeat ourselves many times to get our drinks correct and even then they sent us the wrong lemonade twice. Lol. We probably won't be back for a while, and if we do we will keep our fingers crossed to have Stephanie wait on us again!"
Monee D.,"Fremont, CA",0,18,,4.0,8/4/2016,"Food is good, great selection for late night pick-up, delivery or going to the restaurant itself.  Ambiance is okay...lights too bright in my opinion and definitely loud no matter where you sit.  But, for late night dining it beats Taco Bell and jack in the box for sure."
Amy H.,"San Jose, CA",1246,1323,2163,4.0,4/11/2013,"BJs is a bunch of goodness in one restaurant, whether you want an entree or DESSERT. The place is pretty big and can get pretty packed around dinner time. Lunch would be a great time to go since it won't be as busy as the dinner crowd. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday like my friend did. She had the beer sampler. LUNCH Lunch is great here because they have awesome specials that are discounted. I got the club half flatbread pizza and side salad. The pizza was the perfect size that was cut up in smaller slices. There was chicken, avacado, cheese, tomatoes and onions and it was sooo good. The salad was a nice addition and it was all for $8 or $9. I couldn't believe it because dinners are always pretty expensive. Definitely worth coming here for lunch. DESSERT PAZOOKIEEEEEE. Sometimes I just want to go to BJs for the Pazookie. If you don't already know and you have been missing out, a pazookie is a huge baked cookie with ice cream on top. An individual size can be split with 2 people. You can also get the sampler with three different flavors, such as oreo cookie, regular cookie, and red velvet. I wouldn't recommend the other crazy flavors because the regular cookie is just plain delicious. If you really want to YOLO with friends, I would get the PARTY SIZE PAZOOKIE. You can literally split it with 5 others because there is so much cookie and ice cream. The cookie is thin, warm, and gooey and the ice cream scoops just belong with it. Eat it quickly though or else you will have melted ice cream on your delicious cookie :( **TIPS** 1) Lunch time is the way to go if you want cheaper food. 2) Celebrate any occasion here and they will definitely accommodate you.  3) If you come here for dinner, prepare for a 30-45 minute hour wait. 4) GET A PAZOOKIEEE. 5) Enjoy!"
Jasmin V.,"Fremont, CA",64,2,,1.0,1/28/2017,"Just got home from having dinner with my son tonight and I'm feeling pretty upset about my service. My son loves this restaurant so I decided to take him to dinner there tonight. On the website there was a coupon for a free pizookie with a purchase of 9.95 or more so I was excited to redeem it. Our server JESSICA was friendly but when we asked about the free pizookie she got all weird and asked us to show her the coupon. I pulled up the website on my phone and showed her the coupon and she stayed staring at it for a while. She finally said it ""worked for her"" but when she gave us the bill it had still charged us. I let her know that we were still being charged for it and instead of just fixing it for us she made us feel super embarrassed and said it's probably because we weren't signed up for rewards or something. She just really didn't want to honor the coupon for us and we felt super embarrassed so we just paid for it and left. It's not even about the money, it was the fact that she made a big deal about a coupon that was on the website. Workers there should know the promotions going on and not make their customers feel embarrassed just for trying to use a coupon. I always enjoyed going to this bjs but after tonight I for sure will never return."
Mystery M.,"Fremont, CA",306,536,32751,3.0,6/17/2014,"After my experience here at BJ's today for lunch, I just had to write a review update. I came to take advantage of their FREE Pizookie Day that they've posted all over the web on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their Website. At first, I was slightly confused on how this works. While heading to BJ's, I put down my name on the ""Prefered Waiting List"" using the BJ's App. When we got there the hostess, who was really nice, told us that there was going to be a 10 minute wait. No biggy there, it's BJ's there always going to be wait. The hostess was about right, it was only about a 10 minute wait. When we were finally able to get a table, we were sited in a booth, ones that were meant for 2 people. The hostess had asked used if that was okay and we said yes because well it was meant for 2 people and we had 2 people in our party. It took a while before our waitress came to assist us and take our order. Which was to be expected because BJ's is always so busy no matter what time you go really. When our waitress finally came, she apologized for the wait and for taking so long to help us and take our our order. Our poor waitress seemed overworked and really tired of waiting soooo many different tables. I felt kinda bad for her because she had to wait so many tables. We ordered our food  and then I had asked her about the FREE Pizookie offer that was going on today because of #BJsFreePizookieDay and she told us we had to order it online using the BJ's App because it was a pre order thing. So, after she took our order, I went online using the BJ's App and ordered the FREE Chocolate Chip Pizookie and it was scheduled to arrive at 1:30 PM. The waitress had confirmed that the kitchen had received our order of the Pizookie and that was great and all. The Pizookie came out at 1:20, ten minutes early than it said on our order but you'd think that would be okay right? Well, no in this case it was not. The reason for the deduction of a star was because the Pizookie came out 5 minutes after our entrees arrived, therefore, I wasn't really able to enjoy my entree at all which was a BJ's Mini Lunch Special Pizza. I couldn't enjoy my Pizza because I didn't' want my Pizookie to become hard nor did I want the Ice Cream on the Pizookie to melt. That was the sad part of my meal today, that I couldn't enjoy the Pizza because of the Pizookie coming right after the Pizza came. Even our waitress was like ""OMG, the Pizookie came out already? ""They sent the Pizookie out already"". ""The Pizookie came out right after the entrees."" She did apologize for that as well and told us that ""usually the pre orders come out pretty quickly"". At least next time, I know not to pre order the Pizookie until after my entrees come out so I can at least enjoy my entree first lol. But it was FREE so I guess I can't complain too much... Also, the Clam Chowder that came with my Pizza (you can choose from a variety of soups) was pretty good. I like the Clam Chowder Soup, it was full of rich flavor, clams and potatoes.  The Pizookie was still good, and our waitress was nice and apologized for the mishaps that happened today. So,  just one star knocked down, now a 3."
Jeff C.,"Fremont, CA",189,249,138,3.0,6/15/2014,"This is our go to place for decent American food chain.  We came here recently to watch a World Cup game and the bar area was packed with fans watching on the 4x TV screen.  Typically, there's always a short line here because its so popular.  BJ has a rewards program thats good for small rewards like free dessert if you eat there often.  Happy hour half-off prices for food means half portions.  So its not really a deal.  The prices for appetizers are above average, so next time I would just buy an entree. While watching the game, we got a Jerry Burst pitcher, which is easy to share with the ladies.  Also got fried calamari, avocado rolls, and regular buffalo wings.  They were all very good but probably could give me a heart attack.  The bartender checked in on us periodically through the game and was very relaxed.  All-in-all a great place for a sporting event.  Its OK for general dining though since the food quality and value is hit or miss from my experience."
Lala K.,"Honolulu, HI",318,178,727,4.0,6/2/2014,"Excellent customer service! The fact that they were willing to sit a party of 16 with the whole party not present. Our waitress was also a sweetheart, she catered to out every need and she was very patient. Despite being a big party, we didn't wait long for our food and our food arrived at the same time. I've always been a fan of BJ's cause I find their food to be exceptional good. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area, as well as those looking for a place to hold a huge party."
Caroline K.,"Castro Valley, CA",54,60,1,4.0,5/25/2016,"Went back this Sunday and service was so much better - our server was on top of things and strangely, weekend service was way better than my previous weekday experience.  The manager was responsive to the observations that I had made and it's always nice as a consumer to feel heard.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the shredded lettuce was so wilted and brownish that I do wonder what QA is done before serving.  But my bloody mary was awesome and dishes were cleared promptly!  While i still think this location needs some work, I can appreciate that they are making efforts and that management staff is responsive!"
Izzy Q.,"Fremont, CA",58,35,21,5.0,6/17/2015,"I personally really enjoy this location. I'm originally from San Jose and used to go to the Oakridge mall location but I find that this location's employees are much more friendly! I usually sit at the bar and I was extremely impressed with Sergio one of the bartenders who is always there late night closing. I asked him to make me a Cantaloupe martini,  a drink that I would always have at the San Jose Oakridge location. He hadn't heard of it before and i told him to just give it a shot. After a couple of tries...he nailed it!!! It tasted just like the one i used to order in SJ. I was extremely impressed! He's one of the reasons why i come back :)"
Queena T.,"Oakland, CA",74,35,25,5.0,11/11/2016,"Perfect for any game day! Delicious pizzas and yummy delicious appetizers. I always tend to get their appetizers or finger food because that's one of the best, safe, comfy food to me. By all means, you can try other food as well. This is just my preferences. Don't remember much about their pastas, but it's not that bad. I found a new favorite pasta, but I forgot what's the name of it. It's like a pizza, but in a pasta instead and it comes in a pot. Great services here, checks up on you every 10 minutes or so and keeps refilling drinks. They always make sure we have a wonderful time, satisfied with our food, and experience. And if you aren't satisfy with your food or they made it not to your liking, they will try to make you another one. No, this doesn't mean you get free food. They will simply replace your food. Don't be greedy! So excellent on customer services. And all the employees there are friendly. Sadly, there's no reservations. The line can get very long and you have to wait at least 45 minutes just to be seated. But the food is worth the wait because once the food comes out, all the problems vanishes or disappeared."
Bailey D.,"Roseville, CA",178,7,,2.0,7/9/2016,"I am only giving this BJ's location a 2 out of 5 because those stars only stand for the food. The food is good, but the customer service is a little poor. We have been here for a an hour and have only been check on maybe twice. Our server was just chatting up with other co workers and not checking on our table when we needed something and we would ask for something and the server would never bring it. I will give the blonde Taylor, a 5 star she is awesome!!!"
Josh R.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2017,"I go here a lot with friends and family. Great atmosphere and great to watch the warriors game or any sports game when you're there. But recently the service has been lack luster and this past visit had might been my last one. Service was down right aweful. On what seemed to be not a crowded day our did not bring us plates zero napkins and never checked in on us for refills on drinks unless we flagged him or any other employee working. I've gotten coffee and asked for creamer and never got any. But what was the worst part was when we paid. We had a sizeable group of about 5 and we paid 10 dollars over the due amount. After waiting for about half an hour we had to leave since we work the next day and it's about 10:30 so we had to reach the front desk to see where our change is and they had told us he left. So he left without saying anything, no receipt, no change, nothing. So this was the final straw we will be looking for another BJ's with better service and that actually bring change back"
Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",304,1561,73,3.0,2/23/2013,"I came back here with two coworkers to try them out again.  In some aspects, the meal that I had here was a lot better but a few things bothered me like my experience last time. First of all, my meal was way better.  Once again, I ordered off the lunch menu and got a lunch portion-sized of the BJ's Cobb Salad for $9 along with a side of Tomato Bisque soup for only a $1 more.  The soup portion is quite large so it's quite the deal and there's plenty in there to share with someone else too.  In terms of taste, the soup was decently seasoned although I wish it was a bit more creamy.  The BJ's Cobb had turkey, bacon ,avocado, and bleu cheese dressing mixed with romaine lettuce.  It's a chopped salad so the lettuce as well as the other elements on the plate so don't expect leaves of romaine on the plate. Secondly, like last time, there were a few service issues that were a bit irritating.  Unlike last time, we got our food and drink orders in relatively quick after we sat down.  I ordered iced tea for my drink and I noticed that there was no sugar on the table nor was there an offer to bring me lemon with some sugar with my drink.  It was a bit surprising as I didn't think that I needed to remind my server that I wanted lemon with my iced tea...that's something that I expect my server to ask me.  My server also didn't smile during our whole experience too...I know that's sort of nitpicking and that everyone can have bad days and moods but I used to be in the service industry too!  Flash that ""fake"" smile for me!...don't really want to see a grumpy face from someone who's waiting on me. Overall I still enjoyed my meal with my coworkers and it was an improvement overall since the last time I was here.  Hopefully the next time I come here, I hope the service aspect of my meal improves a bit."
Monica B.,"Union City, CA",9,85,27,3.0,3/18/2016,They can never get everything on time or right...good people but lacking that focused customer service
Lydia H.,"Milpitas, CA",213,64,33,2.0,5/20/2015,"Two words to summarize my review: understaffed and inadequately trained.  This place has really gone down hill compared to my previous visits from previous years. I know service had always been slow, but at least they were always nice about it.  We came at around 9:30 sat at one of the round tables near the bar after we got the ok from the hosts. We proceeded to wait 10 min- no menu. So we got our own menus back at the hosts stand. 10 more min- no server greeting us or asking if we wanted some waters. Some type of acknowledgement would've been nice.  Another 10 min passed so we decided to order from the bartender ourselves. The rude and snobby bartender looked at us impatiently and took our order. We sat back down and voila, our server appears. I'm not going to bore you with the rest of the waiting details, as you probably have an idea from reading the rest of the reviews from other yelpers, but it continued with us flagging down the server for the basic necessities because he was obviously too busy and overwhelmed.  We understand his pain, both having been in the hospitality industry, so we gave our 20% tip and bounced.  This place really needs an upgrade in food and service because it's not what they used to be. The beers and atmosphere are still great, but probably wouldn't come back again. It seems like management honestly just doesn't give a fuck."
Athena K.,"San Francisco, CA",7,47,5,4.0,3/7/2016,"Had a much better experience this time. I really enjoy happy hour and the food we had was great, I love the crispy fries almost as thin as shoestring fries and that's my personal favorite. Ribs are so succulent. Sliders are big and juicy. Buffalo wings had a great sauce but the quality of the chicken itself was not so good. The service was excellent, shout out to Margarita for being quick and friendly and bringing us awesome delicious margaritas."
Simon F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",51,500,3314,4.0,2/3/2014,"My wife and I had lunch here on Saturday (for some reason, my wife didn't want to eat at a strip club). We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (you're given a black pager if you have to wait). I was nice enough to go outside (this freed up a sofa for a family to use). The flies that were trailing me soon followed. Our hostess was friendly (my wife just noticed that she was wearing too much eye shadow- maybe she was trying to look like a wolf). We were seated in the large room on the left (the only other time we were seated there was during the grand opening). I had to ask for place settings. The tables weren't fully set up yet. Our server was young and clearly new. He was also light (he could get blown away by a stiff breeze). Anyway, he was attentive, but annoying (I found him to be a major pest at first). We left him a nice tip ($9.81), but I have to say that it was because we didn't have any singles (our total was $50.19, and so a tip of $4.81 would have seemed a bit harsh). At one point, a manager came by to check on us. He was nice, and was in the area a lot (a group of about 10 suddenly arrived- they were pretty loud). As usual, I enjoyed the songs playing inside (ex: ""Chloe"" by Grouplove). : The TV at the bar was turned to 4 different things. It was dumb, largely because only 2 games were on. (My wife groaned when I had us switch seats. I wanted to face the TV that was closest to us.) : If you redeem 150 points, you get ""$10 Off Any Meal (excludes alcohol, gift cards, tax and gratuity)."" Note: All prices include tax. : My Pink Lemonade was $3 (there are free refills on soft drinks). : Mozzarella Sticks ($8.67): 9/10. My wife and I each had 4 right away.  Our mozzarella sticks, as usual, were wonderful. My wife likes the marinara sauce too, but only had a little. BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich ($11.94- the price was $11.25 in 2011): 8/10. My wife is always pleased when she orders one. She ate her sandwich quickly and received a good serving of wedge-cut seasoned fries. : Pepperoni Extreme (Mini- $11.45): 8.25/10. I should have ordered a Small (for $15.21). Still, I was very pleased overall (I could have received more pepperoni, and the edges of the crust were lightly burnt). Next time, I'm going to try BJ's Hand-Tossed Pizza: ""Our delicious thin crust is lightly brushed with garlic butter and topped with the perfect combination of bold tomato sauce, our signature five cheese blend and your favorite gourmet ingredients, then baked to crispy perfection."" : BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger ($8.67): 8/10. They're new. Description: ""On a grilled bun with Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickles and our special burger sauce."" I didn't receive any ""special burger sauce,"" but that's cool with me. It kind of fell apart, but my patty was very tasty. My crispy-thin fries were pretty good (I just had to add some salt), but somewhat cold. If we weren't pressed for time (my parents were watching our son), I would have complained about them. My bun was nicely grilled, and my cheese was delicious and gooey. I only received 2 strips of bacon, but they were quite meaty. : BJ's Famous Pizookie®: White Chocolate Macadamia Nut ($6.49): 8.5/10. Our Pizookie was a shade overcooked, but otherwise delectable. The scoops of vanilla bean ice cream were bigger than normal. Regular pans were used in the past (tin pans are now used). The Pizookies here were a bit better in the past. Still, I highly recommend them. I laughed right before we left. A guy got hit in the head by one of the revolving doors. He wasn't paying enough attention (he was embarrassed, but otherwise fine). The parking lot should be fixed up a bit. It's pretty ""ragged."" For the most part, my wife and I really enjoyed our food."
Marie R.,"Redwood City, CA",1,9,13,4.0,11/11/2015,Came here with family for the 1st time. Food was delicious. Place was full had to wait a while but it was worth it.
Rashmi P.,"Fremont, CA",128,223,43,3.0,11/28/2016,"The food in general is bland and nothing to rave about, but the pizookie happy hour are the only reasons my friends and I ever come here."
Jaime T.,"Milpitas, CA",84,38,235,4.0,9/3/2014,This place is wonderful for group gatherings.   This is always the destination of my sport banquets.  We cram in and the staff still manage to satisfy us as well as maintain a smile on their faces.  The food is alright.   I prefer the appetizers over the actual meals.  And the pizookies are to die for!  They are a must when you visit.
