Hetal C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",2,7,,1.0,11/25/2016,"As much as I love the food here, the service is horrible. We went in at 9pm and ordered a party platter pazookie. It took almost 25 mins, which was fine, but when we got it they had made the wrong flavor and it wasn't warm at all. The cookie was so thin you could almost see through it. We let our waitress know and she replied with, it is what you ordered, we went on and showed her how to wasn't and all she said was oh. She dropped the check on the table without a word and left. Very disappointed!!"
Shiree S.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",0,9,16,5.0,6/11/2016,Anthony was amazing. He was super helpful at all times and even chatted it up a bit. Melissa(manager) was awesome. She came by to check on me and did it ever so sweetly! Great place!
Christina T.,"Hayward, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/6/2017,Called and the lady said there was no wait for 4 people. Got here in 10 min and they said the wait was 25 min... it's 58 min later and we just got seated. Sadly I'm not surprised in the wait. The worst!!
Ambar C.,"Los Angeles, CA",414,380,2264,3.0,12/28/2012,"I've been to a few different BJ's now.  They have a decent beer selection, and their pazookie things are yummy.  I took my sister to this particular BJ's to celebrate an important milestone in her career.  I was exhausted, so I only ordered a 5oz IPA.  She ordered some fruity cocktail drink, and we both split the pazookie mini trio.   I was satisfied with the IPA, but it was nowhere near the best IPA I've ever had.  Trust me, if it were really good, I would have ordered another glass.  Anyway, onto the pazookie trio.  We got mini pazookies in peanut butter, cookies and cream, and regular chocolate chip.  The peanut butter pazookie was very rich and had an intense peanut butter flavor - definitely crunchy peanut butter.  The cookies and cream was probably my favorite.  It came with a chocolate cookie with white chocolate chips with a cookies and cream whipped topping.  The regular pazookie came with a regular chocolate cookie and vanilla ice cream.  Overall, I was happy with the dessert.  The bartender was very nice, but he wasn't especially attentive once he found out we only came in for dessert."
Verunchik R.,"Hayward, CA",51,40,6,4.0,5/13/2016,"It's a good place to grab lunch, the service has been better lately, good choice of beers and ciders, big menu, lots to chose from. Hubby's calamari came out overcooked, but they took it of the bill."
John W.,"Union City, CA",49,31,4,5.0,5/1/2016,"5 stars for excellent customer service with our server, Kishan. He was very attentive despite a very busy night. He's prompt. He refilled our waters without us having to ask. He checked in on us just the right number of times. Food is what to except of a larger chain restaurant. Restaurant is clean."
D T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,83,30,5.0,4/30/2016,"Best ribs! Forget Texas Roadhouse and Famous Dave's. BJ's has BOMB baby back ribs, with or without sauce. Compliment the ribs with a side of baked potato and asparagus."
Edwin B.,"Emeryville, CA",4,32,18,5.0,9/23/2015,"Very enjoyable experience. I considered giving only 4 stars because of the deplorable whisky selection,  but everything else was so good, they get 5. BJ's is my JAM,  and Katherine H. is my Peanut Butter. (Katherine H. was our dining experience associate.)"
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",143,8,,2.0,5/9/2015,"Every single time my coworkers and I come, the service is terrible. We always have to wait a minimum of 10 minutes before our server comes by our table. Another 10 minutes before we get our drinks. Another 20 minutes before we get our food. Don't get me wrong, the servers are actually really nice, but they just never stop by the table. Order everything at once because if you want to place another order, it'll take at least another half hour.  Also, last time we were here for a friend's birthday and after waiting over half an hour for our pizza, the pizza was served cold. What the heck? Of course we sent it back. When he brought it out the second  time, he didn't bring any plates or silverware. We came late that night and there weren't that many tables. If it was busy, I'd understand, but c'mon.  I honestly think chain restaurants like this need to up their game. There are a lot of booming restaurants that have excellent service and great food. I've been to BJs a dozen of times and every single time, the service doesn't change."
James L.,"Las Vegas, NV",49,12,3,5.0,3/19/2016,"After a long day at work, it's nice to wind down with a beer flight. No matter how busy this place gets, I always seem to get excellent service. I like the light fair menu, especially the Korean Tacos. Never had a pazookie, but I heard that they are really good there."
Raj G.,"Fremont, CA",0,75,291,4.0,12/8/2015,"BJ's is probably the second best place in the Bay area for beer. They have over a dozen beers on tap plus they always have a seasonal beer on hand. The food is pretty good too including their chicago style thick crust pizzas. You can even customize and make your own. The chicken Lettuce wraps is my favorite for appetizer - light and not too filling.....yes, you need to budget space for some great tasting beers! And do not forget to end your evening with a Pizookie! Yummylicious! There is always a waiting period after 6 PM so call in advance to get on their phone list to save waiting time once you arrive and check in and collect your buzzer."
Brook B.,"San Francisco, CA",1,9,,1.0,6/7/2016,I came here tonight for my nephew birthday celebration and I must say very disappointed!! I normally visit the one in San Bruno Ca and had no problems even with the crowd. My husband steak had to be sent back three times. The waiter and servers were all over the place. Time we got our food it was time for us to go where he didn't even want his dinner. Then we asked for our bill and that took even longer to receive. It's sad how this particular BJ's put a bad taste in my mouth moving forward. Hopefully they get more help and pay attention to detail.
Ashley D.,"Fremont, CA",17,6,14,5.0,10/2/2015,"Went here thursday night and it's pretty busy took as a while to be seated but it's fine because the food was bomb! And service is really good the guy who served us was so accommodating :) also the price is not ridiculous i really love the dessert ""Thumbs up"" i'll definitely be going back here."
Stuart M.,"Hayward, CA",7,54,36,5.0,2/24/2015,Never been disappointed at any of the BJ establishments. They have great food and they beer on tap is delicious! Always order there specialty pizzas paired with their blonde ale.
Paul T.,"Moline, IL",29,158,206,3.0,2/16/2015,"BJ's is a casual restaurant chain that does better than most. They offer a diverse menu, craft brews and a full bar. The food is for the most part consistent and the service at this location has improved over the course of the past 12 months. They feature over 120 menu items that include calorie estimates. There are several ""EnLIGHTened"" entrées, salads and lunch specials which range in calories from 460-850. Some of my favorite menu items include: -- Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi (460 calories); oven roasted mahi-mahi served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice. The mahi-mahi is always cooked to flaky perfection and the fried rice is almost as good as Benihana's without all the buttery guilt. I suggest asking for soy sauce and Sriracha hot sauce on the side if you want to kick things up a notch !! This dish pairs well with a glass of Barefoot Chardonnay; not too expensive and on point ($5.95 glass/$20.95 bottle.) -- BJ's Favorite Mini 6"" Deep Dish Pizza (~753 calories);  Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives, white onions, and seasoned tomatoes. I'm actually not a fan of deep dish Pizza in general, but these are good and not particularly heavy. This dish pairs well with your favorite brew."
Rela S.,"Fremont, CA",47,127,74,5.0,1/19/2014,"We came here for the 49ers game and the staff did a great job of taking care of us. On game days they offer happy hour specials throughout the duration of the game. The specials were definitely a great deal and they had a good selection of drinks and food. Some items included: Happy Hour Specials: $4: All BJ's craft beers, Flatbread pizzas, boneless wings $5 House Beers, Freshly Muddled Mojitos, Martinis, Spinach Artichoke Dip, Chicken Pot Stickers, Angus Beef Sliders $6: 4 Different Types of Wines, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Santa Fe Spring Rolls, Avocado Egg Rolls, Mini Deep Dish Pizza Keep in mind the Happy Hour specials are ""Happy Hour-Sized"" so much smaller than their usual portion sizes. I got the flat bread pizza and there where 4 small slices of pizza. It was pretty tasty though. The chicken lettuce wraps were a pretty decent size as well. One other thing to keep in mind is the happy hour specials ONLY APPLY TO THE BAR area. Not sure if this rule is for game days or everyday. But when we went they only offered the specials at the bar. We picked up a few drinks while waiting for our table and brought them over once the table was ready. Overall a great place to watch a game. I think next time we'll just hangout at the bar. The energy was much better on that side of the room :)"
Jeanette E.,"Fremont, CA",71,20,4,4.0,3/13/2016,"Called ahead for 3.  Only had a 15 min wait.  Restaurant was a bit loud.  Sat in Jennifer's section.  She was sweet and got our order in.  We ordered the pasta alfredo, classic burger and the roast beef dip.  Apparently there was an issue with the kitchen because I had to return my roast beef twice because the meat was cold.  I understand the first time, but twice? The manager came out and apologized and all was good. But when I returned it the second time, he was mortified.  I felt bad because maybe it's suppose to be cold.  Nope, it's suppose to be hot.  Anyway, third times a charm and again the manager and Jennifer apologized for the issue.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 because of how it was handled and they did comp the mistake.  Can't give a 5 stars, because hey there was an issue.  Overall, we had a pleasant visit and will return.  Sadly I forgot to give my BJS rewards #"
Scott R.,"Fremont, CA",23,19,3,1.0,6/22/2016,Very poor food today. I would avoid.  Ordered the Italian Market pizza and it looked terrible.  Hardly any meat on it and looked sickly compared to the menu picture.  Cook was rushed obviously but quality NOT quantity is what keeps customers happy!  If I could add pics I would.
S G.,"Alameda, CA",0,99,7,2.0,8/15/2015,"The worst customer service EVER!!! I was about to make my own food.lol. I had to find my waitress and have her take my order. The restaurant was extreme loud, made it hard to talk with people at our table.   The food deserves 5 stars."
Laura F.,"Millbrae, CA",3,55,172,1.0,1/12/2015,Had avocado rolls at the 10pm happy hour.  Both myself and my date became very ill after we left.   Service was just ok...
