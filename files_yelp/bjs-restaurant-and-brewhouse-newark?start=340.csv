Jason M.,"San Jose, CA",113,217,246,4.0,1/8/2015,"Burgers are delicious! I came here not knowing what I wanted the waitress recommended a burger wow what a good choice this burger was fantastic,  toppings just the right amount everything was great.   I tried two of the beers, I can't say that I'm a big fan of BJ's beers, they are kind of off.  but the food so far great."
Amber E.,"San Jose, CA",3,15,3,1.0,12/20/2014,"Take out waitress was dry heaving. When I asked about the poor thing I was told ""they really need all people on staff.""  I'd  rather have slow service."
John B.,"San Francisco, CA",5,32,1,5.0,8/3/2015,"I don 't like giving out 5 stars, but this place earned it. I went in twice over the weekend.  This place is awesome in almost every conceivable way.  The décor and cleanliness, the service and friendly attitude of the staff, the food, even the menu is awesome. Gabby was my server both times and she did a phenomenal job. You don't sacrifice anything here.  The food is amazing and authentic, the prices are good and the environment is cool."
Lynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",214,511,2093,3.0,4/9/2014,I seriously haven't reviewed this place? I visited this place about 4 times since it opened. I've ordered the shrimp pasta. Really good. They always give really big portions. I never get around to trying their pizookies because I'm always too full. Their beer is great and service is always up to par.  I will definitely come back to try the meats and hopefully pizookie next.
Lauretta K.,"Fremont, CA",41,27,,3.0,12/27/2014,"We usually avoid this place because they're service is slow. Last night we went because they have cash ahead seating (amazing!). Service was great, food was decent... I got the grilled chicken Alfredo, there was something not chicken in there, not sure what it was but I moved it to the side and kept eating. They didn't even give me crap when I asked for extra sauce and to add mushrooms. After this visit I won't hesitate to go back."
T C.,"Oakland, CA",112,791,313,5.0,1/7/2015,"I really should be on a commercial for BJ's... no one in this world loves this place as much as I do. No one I say!  Be it a cobb salad, pizza, burger, tacos..whatever.. it's always good. I have never had bad service or a bad meal at any BJ's Brewhouse in all the land. Ever! If there's a BJ's around, there I am... Not every day but, when I get a hankerin for good food and drinks and some good ole fashioned chain restaurant food that also happens to be delicious!"
Anonymous U.,"Watsonville, CA",0,4,3,1.0,10/29/2016,Worst service I've ever had. When I walked in the girl at the front was rude and didn't even greet us and when we were told to wait for seating she didn't give us a time of wait. The workers stand around gossiping and when we we're sat at our table the girl didn't even talk to us and our waitress took 10 min to bring us coffee and 10 more minutes to bring sugar for our coffee and our food took forever to come! Bad service!!! DO NOT come here
Alea F.,"Castro Valley, CA",58,13,,4.0,5/14/2016,"The food is great, the service is usually good, and the drinks are really good. An awesome place for a great family dinner! The atmosphere is very good and is great for conversation.   Overall very worth coming out to!"
Ashley W.,"Dallas, TX",91,6,2,2.0,10/28/2016,I called in around 5pm on Friday and spoke with someone about happy hour. I asked if they offered happy hour and they said yes until 7pm. I asked if it was in the bar only or in the entire restaurant. I was told it was in the whole restaurant. We came in around 6:30pm and I asked to see a happy hour menu. The hostess told me our server would have one. We were seated in the regular dining room. When the server came by I asked to see the happy hour menu and he told me happy hour wasn't available in the dining room. We were already seated and told that they could not do happy hour outside the bar. The whole reason we came early in the evening was for happy hour and then we were seated where it wasn't offered. I wanted to move to the bar but didn't want to make a scene. Ultimately the food was good. I had chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The chicken and potatoes were hot but the broccoli was not. Overall I am not satisfied with this experience.
Ralph P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,29,2,2.0,4/3/2016,"Caution...do not order delivery if you are (a) hungry or (b) don't have money to burn. I have eaten in and the food is generally pretty good. Tonight I felt like delivery. The order took an hour and a half. It came with no utensils or condiments (we were at a nearby hotel). The food had been jostled around in the containers so that it looked like trash upon arrival. It was so over salted, I thought I would not be able to eat it, but I was starving, so I did and now I believe my blood pressure has hit an all time high! The delivery and service charges for three items were over $12.00! Room service would have cost about the same,  would have been much faster, and probably better."
Vi T.,"San Francisco, CA",1207,332,1268,3.0,8/28/2011,Get's craaaazy effing packed on weekends. The pizza gave our entire group stomach aches and questionable bowel movements. Lost my pizookie virginity here.  Yum. Cupertino's BJ's is better.
Carolina A.,"Palo Alto, CA",107,16,1,2.0,3/27/2015,"So tonight we came in to celebrate my little sister's 16th birthday ( we were only a party of 4) But we called in ahead of time/early just because its friday and we knew it would be busy. We only waited 15-20 mins which was AWESOME! Our waitress was really nice and wonderful and took our orders and brought our drinks in a timely matter.  But why the two stars? well, the birthday girl ordered a burger and it only came with ONE bun. Two young girls came to give us our food, one of them almost hitting me in the face with the plate that was given across the table ( I'm a calm person so I just ignored the rudeness) and the other gave the birthday girl her plate with ONE bun and said"" unfortunately you only have one bun"" and then left. I looked at my sister just to clarify with her that we actually heard that right. Then I thought, ""oh maybe she went to go get the other bun"", because, you know, we ordered a burger, and last time I checked, burgers came with TWO buns. But the girl never came. And at this point my blood started to boil.  But my sister (being the sweetheart that she is) tried to just go with it and attempted to eat it, but today is her birthday and being her older sister, I was NOT having that. Our waitress finally came back and I relayed the appalling event that just occurred. She was shocked, apologized quickly, and got my sister a bun. I cant say I've worked in foods or can deal with the things they go through, but I don't think its difficult or rocket science to put a bun on top of a effing burger.... I really appreciated our waitress and I appreciated her apology even though she was not at fault. I hated that she felt that she needed to apologize for something that she did not do. So waitress, YOU ROCK! I wish your co workers had the same work ethics as you do.  And to the management, Please train your staff on how to deliver good customer service, IDK how tired you might be, there is no excuse for such rudeness. Your front desk and waitresses are great but we will not be coming back again. Ive had better service at the BJs in San Mateo so I think I shall continue spending my money there."
Dvn M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/21/2016,"It is my birthday today. An old friend took me out to lunch and we ended up goin here. Started great, everyone was nice and greeted us and service was up to par. After we get our appetizers, one of the servers decided it was a good idea to bring us a large saucer of sriracha and instead of serving it from the open-side of the bar, brought the saucer in between my friend and I. The server slipped and now my friend and I are covered in spicy hot sauce. our ties , shoes socks, all smeared in the bright red shade of rooster sauce. The manager tried to make things better by offering to comp me for the meal (was nice of him), but what this rant is about is when the server who dropped the sauce opened the door to enter the kitchen, let out a loud chuckle and started to tell her friends, all before the door closed behind her. Spicy sauce has penetrated me dress pants and now is burning my inner thigh. thanks bjs'........."
Radostina S.,"Cupertino, CA",428,92,7,3.0,5/7/2015,"The service was pretty good. Our avocado egg rolls were burnt. Tasted ok still. I got the santa fe salad and that thing is sooo good. I highly recommend it. Last time I was here I ordered the parmesan chicken with broccoli and there was no broccoli. Overall, the service is good but the kitchen slacks a little when it's super busy. Wait times are also no fun."
Zoey S.,"Union City, CA",126,72,125,3.0,11/24/2015,"I'm probably the only person not a big fan of their ""deep dish"" pizza which deep full of dough. I only come here when my fiancé drags me. I wish they would revamp their menu and include more selections with less sodium. Giving three stars because the service is good here but unfortunately the food keeps me away."
Dave K.,"Hayward, CA",1,33,13,4.0,4/17/2016,"Food is ok but I gave it a four for the selection of beer, number of tv's around the place playing nba playoff games and for the Sun afternoon manager who was great. She really cared about the customers that came in and super attentive."
CJ C.,"Newark, CA",0,33,9,2.0,4/2/2016,"This place is bad to a point that there WIFI is not working, food is even worst cold and tastes bad our server is crazy, coming asking are you ready to order after we told him give us 10 mins we are having appetizers, then he comes back after a min with the same question hahah.  And the worst part is the whole floor is slippery and oily so watch out your steps . Beer was very good that's why they get 2 stars"
Angelique M.,"East Bay, CA",362,241,1252,3.0,12/26/2013,Food is same like every other BJs. But the service was aweful. Our waitress hardly came to our table and she gave our food to the table next to ours. And it wasn't just our waitress it was the rest of the waiting staff. They kept mixing orders left and right. I will say the other times I have been here the service has been on point. Tonight was just not their night.
Ana A.,"Fremont, CA",90,4,1,1.0,9/12/2015,"Size they promote are not the sizes they give you. We went there for a bday and we ordered crispy calamary, and to our surprise the serving size was really small. We called the manager and they said that was how they always served it. Overall, we where disappointed about the size of our food, it was not even that cheap."
Reece R.,"Newark, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/9/2016,"I love getting the rack of ribs when I have a big enough appetite. otherwise the chicken tortilla soup and the mozzarella salad is great, if you get there early enough on the right day you can even get the unlimited soup and salad. I've had the pizza from here a few times now but it never quite hit the spot except for the appetizer flatbreads those are great"
