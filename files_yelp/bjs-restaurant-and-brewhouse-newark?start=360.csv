Jag S.,"Hayward, CA",5,18,3,3.0,12/9/2015,We tried bjs yesterday.  The service was excellent but food was so so. The chicken was over cooked. Also their artichoke dip was not even average.  I gave them three stars just because of service.
The Food L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",20,284,579,4.0,5/21/2015,"What a gigantic restaurant with massive parking lot !!! Not sure who was providing bad service, I found everyone very friendly. I got the impression that it's a very popular among the locals. I wouldn't mind going back if I had to. Desserts are fabulous but I regretted for those extra calories!!! They list all items with calorie count - pretty awesome."
Gia M.,"Fremont, CA",21,13,22,3.0,8/4/2015,"I immediately liked the atmosphere when I entered BJ's. Though it was quite dark, it was very lively inside with a lot of TV screens, and families, and friends dinning, and the place was very big. A lot of people may find this annoying as orders may tend to be slow, but our waitress was very attentive and made sure our orders were taken and delivered promptly. I also like how diverse their menu is, there's always going to be something for everybody. We ordered all appetizers for dinner. We tried the Sliders, Chicken Wings, Crispy Calamari, and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The Sliders and Crispy Calamari were yummy, but nothing out of the ordinary. I felt like you could order the same thing else where and it would taste the same. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were also just okay. It was tasty, but I felt like it could have tasted better. I wasn't really impressed until I tried the Chicken Wings, which we all loved! It was /that/ good that we needed to order another plate to share! The skin was crispy and the meat was just moist and it easily slid off the bone. You know chicken wings are good when they don't need to be dipped in sauce! For dessert we had the Cookies n Cream Pizzookie-- chocolate and Oreo cookie that's a size of a small pizza, topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream, caramel syrup, and chocolate chips. This was reeeaaally good! I love dessert, but the not-too sweet kind, and though this may sound like a mouthful of diabetes, it wasn't! The sweetness was just right and I really enjoyed eating this down to the melted ice cream. Of course you gotta share this, unless you want 1200 calories all to yourself (I won't judge)."
Chris B.,"San Francisco, CA",26,58,106,1.0,1/17/2015,"I've given this place several tries and each time they seem to disappoint. Slow service, messed up orders, and sometimes rude wait staff. The food is below par and don't even think about taking it home in a doggy bag. It honestly tastes like dog food the next day. I've ordered the roast beef dip (take out) and it was the worst sandwich ever. The roast beef was dry and hard and not edible whatsoever! A lot of times, if your seated at the tables your food will come out at different times then the person you came with. Pictured here is the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and a quinoa salad. I thought it was going to be good so I ordered an extra pita taco. Unfortunately it was not good. There was no flavor and it was very bland, not to mention the order was messed up as well. I've come to the conclusion that I can get better food elsewhere, I will not be back."
Anjali S.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,5,4.0,5/16/2016,"The food here is amazingly good. My family and I usually come especially for the deep dish pizzas and the pizookies. BJ's is known for their pizookies as their signature dish, which is a warm cookie topped with ice cream and they are always fresh. Their pizzas are always loaded with toppings and cooked perfectly. One downside is that this place is always crowded so it is very hard to get a table during evening hours and weekends and usually the waiting is a couple of hours. I highly recommend this place for once in a while outings as the waiting times and prices are not suitable for weekly dinings."
Jennifer M.,"Reno, NV",5,33,13,3.0,3/19/2016,"Not much to say... They are all the same. I had the Santa Fe salad which was good. I did a tasting of their draft beers; The harvest Hefeweizen, oasis amber, Jeremiah red ale, nutty brewnette. I recommend doing a tasting. They are all pretty good but nothing really amazing. Red ale is pretty good. It was very busy but they sat is pretty quick and the waitress was sweet and personable."
Jhet S.,"San Ramon, CA",28,9,,5.0,9/18/2016,"I celebrated my birthday here today and to share with you guys... You should come here and celebrate your occasions or just to eat and have fun with friends or families. When I booked my reservation, I spoke to the manager ""Jordan"" and he was so accommodating and very helpful as to what I should order for the party of 35. He even emailed me and called me 2 days and the day before my event to make sure that everything is ok. His very professional and very friendly. Even the 2 servers are great, always smiling and always make sure that everyone gets their drinks and needs. My friends and families are so delighted with their experience here. Buffet table was presentable and organize. Jordan kept coming back to ask if everything is ok. I'm a very meticulous yelper and this time I want to give BJ's a FIVE STAR the servers and most especially Jordan the Manager. Good Job guys! We are definitely coming back."
Melissa M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,92,5,2.0,4/1/2016,"I had a serious pregnancy craving for their spinach and artichoke pizza. Unfortunately, our server was in lala land when she took our orders. Both my husband and I's orders were wrong. We never received refills on our water glasses. We wanted dessert, but by the time she finally came to the table we just wanted to leave. Really disappointing experience!"
Tiffany T.,"Eugene, OR",119,345,634,3.0,8/30/2011,"My favorites are their gourmet mac and cheese, grilled burger melt, cajun pasta, grilled chicken alfredo, atlantic salmon, and jambalaya. Also love their strawberry splash! Seriously, I couldn't taste any alcohol in it. It just tastes like a slushie."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,1/28/2014,"Dinned there on 1-24-14 about 8:30 PM.  Place was busy had about a 20 minute wait, not bad for a Saturday Night. Food and service was good. We are fans of the menu, always enjoy eating at BJ's. Great kid menu items as well."
Madhur B.,"Stanford, CA",190,225,489,5.0,3/3/2014,"Man, I love this place. I find the general food style to be very similar to Cheesecake Factory, with the vibe being a bit more upbeat. I really don't understand how they manage to make the incredibly simple concept of ice cream on a cookie taste so unbelievably delicious.  My recommendation:  Cookies & Cream. That whip cream with the ice cream and cookie is the greatest Peanut Butter Original Chocolate Chunk Aside from the desserts, I'm a BIG fan of the food as well. Some recommendations: Avocado egg rolls - Similar to Cheesecake factory's, yet somehow distinct. Love it.  Chicken Teriyaki - I honestly enjoy this more than teriyaki at any japanese restaurant I've been to, and I'm not ashamed to admit that Chicken Parmesan - See comment above, swap japanese for italian. The marinara is actually seasoned (and a little spicy), which I love.  Balsamic Glazed Chicken - The chicken is always cooked perfectly, and the fried onion strings adds a great crunch"
Catherine B.,"Fremont, CA",318,147,64,2.0,3/20/2015,"Yeah this place is a straight up no for me. Because of all the construction going on so close by (construction for what? They've had it going on for like four years...) they had to like re-arrange the parking lot  completely. So now a giant, empty lot has been reduced to a few parking space up front then the rest cut off in an awkward loop further away from the restaurant. It's really inconvenient&weird. My family&I came when the place wasn't really busy but we still had to wait (even though there were empty tables everywhere). I was torn between the Atlantic Salmon&the Angel Hair Classico. I chose the Angel Hair. I regret everything. The sauce was literally water. It was like they forgot to take the noodles out of the water that they cooked them in then threw some cheese&vegetables on top in an effort to make it better. It just made it worse. It was probably the worst pasta I've ever ordered. The noodles weren't even angel hair - they were thin, tiny, &not even long. It was like someone cut the noodles into quarters then put it back in the soup water. It was gross. This really ruined my last experience with BJ's (which wasn't that bad) &I don't even think it's worth coming back here just for a pizookie."
Kimberly C.,"Austin, TX",93,342,86,3.0,2/18/2014,"Went to this location once. Service, must be because it wasn't packed, was attentive. Balsamic chicken was overcooked and the salad was wilted (from the heat of the hot plate and/or chocken) which is my ultimate pet peeve! Dry, overgrilled chicken breast was edible at least. The buttery mashed potatoes and fried onion strings were decent.   Gave a three star review because the fiance stated his burger was good. And of course their shoe string fries are tasty as always at each BJs location."
Simarprit S.,"San Jose, CA",4,57,11,3.0,11/12/2014,"If they keep themselves at 3/5, they would remain in business.  Problem with 3/5 is that they would always be vulnerable to a new restaurant opening up and walking away with their business. We were a party of four and we had Tortilla Soup Bowl. It was good, mae us ready for main meal.  Southern Fried Chicken was beautifully curated and enjoyable.   Parmesan Chicken was Paremasn Chicken Salmon Dinner was good but portions were way too small. Pizzokie trio was fantastic dish and was thoroughly enjoyable as a dish. Cookies and ice cream were very fresh."
Leizel B.,"San Jose, CA",384,147,268,3.0,10/17/2014,"I came here last night with a friend for dinner.  Like all BJs it was crowded and noisy.  On top of that, the Giants game was on so it was even more crazy.  (We didn't think about that before we decided to come here...our fault).  The wait for a table wasn't too long, we waited about 20 minutes. Once we were seated, we were asked immediately what we wanted to drink, of course we say just waters for now because we haven't even gotten a chance to look at the menu.  After a few minutes, we finally place our orders.  I ordered the rib eye, medium rare, with a wedge salad and baked potato.  For my drink I got their strawberry patch.  My friend ordered the jambalaya.  My steak was cooked perfectly, however, the seasoning was bland or nonexistent.  I had to add my own salt and douse it in A-1 sauce and horseradish.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.  The portion they gave her was huge and she was only able to eat half of it.  My drink tasted just like strawberries, but the alcohol content seemed very low, kind of tasted like I was just drinking a strawberry lemonade.  I don't like my drinks super strong, but I'm paying for an alcoholic drink, it should make me feel kind of warm and fuzzy. Now, on to dessert... if I could give the rating on just the Pazookies alone, I would give it 5 stars.  I mean you cannot go wrong with fresh baked cookies topped with ice cream.  Can you?  We ordered the trio with chocolate chunk, double chocolate, and macadamia nut cookies.  OH SO GOOD!!  I should've ordered a glass of milk with it, but I was too full.   Our service was just ok.  The server was very nice, however he was a little slow and when we needed him he was nowhere to be found."
P snacks A.,"Los Gatos, CA",3,56,2,1.0,9/1/2016,suks bad sevice and slow waiters .......if any waiters
L C.,"Fremont, CA",0,23,1,4.0,3/25/2016,"Thanks to BJ's for accommodating my party of 40 which turned into a party of 75 on a late night Saturday evening.  Although we waited a bit even with reservations, the staff tried to accommodate us as much as they could on such a crowded evening. They were able to get us 50 seats and the rest of the party found spaces in the bar to hang out.   One table was for 30 teenagers.  The waiter assigned to that table deserves kudo's.  He basically had to take care of the whole table by himself.  By the time he was able to get drinks to everyone, refills were being asked of him from the first people he served.  Poor guy!!  BUT, he kept up his great attitude with a smile.  In fact, although his name was Michael, they kept calling him Charlie Puth (the singer) cuz he looked exactly like him.  With his calm and super nice nature, he made waiting for the food bearable. The other two tables were taken care of by another gal.  She seemed overwhelmed a bit and then another totally cool server came by and helped out.  Tips for late night big parties?  Make reservations.  Don't do individual orders - do the big party meal where everyone gets the same item.  Don't forget to order the humongous pizookie!  It'll be devoured."
Andrea P.,"Hayward, CA",236,2,1,2.0,12/21/2015,"A girlfriend, S and I were out spending the day Halloween shopping and dinner got pushed back because of it. We found refuge at BJ'S around 10 pm and stopped for a late dinner. My salad and wine were amazing. S, however did not enjoy her salad. When we told the server, I think her name was Melissa, she very hesitantly offered to take it away which made S feel uncomfortable so she kept the salad and never took another bite. We then proceeded to order our meals. When they came out, S's meal had been prepared entirely wrong which was immediately visibly apparent and we voiced it as such. The food runner apologized and excused herself to fix it. I then started on my meal to find that my Spaghetti and Meatballs(which I specifically ordered without chili flakes due to an allergy) was COLD. I called over Melissa and explained my problem. She then proceeded to stick her fingers into the plate of Spaghetti right in front of me at the table. As a server myself, I was appalled! She offered to have a new one made and I obliged.  In the meantime, as we're having these problems, the manager, Brandy(?) Is standing in the to go area as Melissa acts as our messenger between management and the table. And what is Brandy doing? Putting away boxes and chatting. S is a restaurant manager and I have worked closely along management as a server for years. We were both extremely shocked to have not been visited by a manager at this point.  So, time goes by and we receive our remade meals.  S's comes out wrong yet again, and mine has chili flakes. I take one bite and I'm on fire.  So, we call over Melissa yet again. Tonight just isn't our night and we'd like to pay for what we enjoyed from our terrible experience and hit a drive thru somewhere.  She makes a trip back to Brandy and returns to our table with a check charging us for everything and still no visit from Brandy.  That's when I asked Melissa what the manager's name was.  Only after that did we get a visit from her. She walked over, already familiar with our situation and started going on about how busy she is and how she's the only manager and how she's stuck doing to go's. NOT OUR PROBLEM We sat in disappointment watching her for at least 20 min waiting for a visit before we actually received one. And her ""being so busy"" entails talking and laughing with her subordinates and putting away to go boxes and bags. I have always enjoyed my excursions to BJ'S and make a point of visiting several of the locations in the bay area frequently.  To say the least, S and I were extremely disappointed with our experience and I feel extremely hesitant to return. ... I sent this to corporate and never got a response."
Monica M.,"San Jose, CA",111,57,49,4.0,1/19/2014,"The theme o the night was to try something new - and so my fiancé and I happened upon this place. The lighting was nice and dim, the menu had a little bit of everything- pizza, burgers, BBQ, pastas, salads, sandwiches, soups, wraps, chicken dinners.  I got the balsamic chicken and it was Devine! The chicken was tender and moist , the cheese mashed potatoes were on point. The service was well attentive. The drink selection was out of this world with so many options! - and don't get me started with the pizza/cookie dessert, it was yummy yummy yummy. I recommend this place for those who want to expand their beer tasting palates or if your looking for a relaxed place to have a date. Only down side was that the Caesar salad was a bit bland with barely any dressing. - the place had a security guard monitoring the parking lot which was a nice touch since the restaurant is located in this empty shopping center with construction going on."
Jim F.,"Muskego, WI",1,93,,3.0,11/9/2014,"Had dinner Friday. Got there around 6:00PM and already really crowded. But I got one of the two tables left in the bar area.  Within minutes, standing room only.  Service was prompt and efficient all the way through my time there.   Especially considering how busy it was.  Food was just OK. I had a rack of ribs with a Caesar salad and roasted asparagus.  The ribs were pretty good. But the salad was just a bunch of lettuce in a bowl with bottled dressing on it. Asparagus was just put under a broiler until charred. No seasoning of any kind. Neither side was bad. Just nothing special.  Almost an afterthought to the meal. A bit expensive for the entree to have that.  The beer was really good. I had their in house pale ale on tap. Yummy.  Probably won't go out of my way to go there again but will not avoid it either. Thus 3 stars."
