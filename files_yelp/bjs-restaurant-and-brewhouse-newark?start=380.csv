Kristoffer C.,"Union City, CA",39,67,63,2.0,3/2/2015,"Went to BJ Brewery late night dinner, after coming from a trip from LA. Decided to go a little healthy and ate some salmon and rice pilaf. It was really good, but until i got the price thats the thing that i didnt like. But on top of that, I stepped out to use the restroom, and as I was walking in to the bathroom, there was throw up everywhere on the floor and on the ground. Alerted them right away, but they didnt clean it up for a bit. So I had to wait till i got home to use the restroom"
Helen N.,"Milpitas, CA",120,39,46,2.0,9/27/2013,"I don't know if my boyfriend and I have bad luck or not but the service here is always terrible! We never have any utensils on our table and when I try to flag down an employee for some.. it would take forever for them to actually give me them. Our food always comes late, my boyfriend would have to eat while I eat or vice versa.  I love their food, I really do, especially their famous pizookie but sometimes it's just not worth to drive all the way here because of the bad service."
Julie P.,"San Jose, CA",22,4,4,4.0,4/13/2016,Love the raspberry lemon drop and the jambalaya!  Great food/atmosphere and service keep me coming back!  And the pazookies are amazing!
Ryan T.,"Lincoln, CA",280,205,35,4.0,12/8/2013,"Been to this place a few times now, and havent been disappointed yet. The only thing that really sucks is the wait.. but i guess all good things are worth waiting for, right? They have amazing house brewed beers in all varieties. It definitely seems like the servers have a good understanding of what they are serving too. They make recommendations and really know their stuff. The food is pretty good. Not top notch, but its pretty good. They have such a huge variety of choices on the menu, it makes it really hard to decide.  The real treat comes at desert... the pizookie. Wow... so many choices on how you can have it, and all the ones ive tried are amazing!"
Jake D.,"San Leandro, CA",118,5,,1.0,5/12/2015,"Angry review is angry... Immediately seated, (called ahead)... Flagged a server down after waiting twenty minutes. Gave her our cocktail and food order. Server seemed, well, let's call it dazed and confused. Fifteen minutes after giving our orders, no cocktails, no water, nada. We were walking out, the manager stopped us to try to smooth things out. Another patron came up, they had been there for two and a half hours, took them an hour to even get their appetizers... All in all, I give the place two middle fingers. They are not going to survive like that when the new restaurants open at the mall."
Wendy Y.,"Fremont, CA",295,615,614,4.0,10/1/2014,"I usually come here during the night, at around 8pm or 9pm. It's usually a late dinner and we try not to eat too much. Just like any other BJ's Restaurant, the place has full bar access, booths, and tables. This place in particular has a long wait time on a lot of times I've been here. There were times when we left because the wait was too long and it was already late.  We were seated quickly this time. Our waitress came quickly and provided us with menus and waters. We scanned through the menu and decided on two appetizers and an entree. We got the chips with spinach dip, buffalo wings, and chicken pasta with angel hair. We also got two drinks: your typical Stella and a raspberry cider. The food came pretty quickly and we chowed down right then because we were so hungry. The spinach dip was so good and it warms your mouth. The dip was thick, but in a good way. The buffalo wings were great and the portion was huge! It also comes with celery and carrot sticks. The dipping sauce for the wings was a little weird for me. It was a spicy liquid-y hot sauce. The pasta was so delicious! The angel hair spaghetti was cooked well and the white sauce was great! The chicken was also very tender and juicy. Maybe I was just hungry, but everything was really good. I definitely recommend the raspberry cider though! It's one of the sparkling ciders so it's not even like alcohol. It just tasted really fruity and nice.  The service was also good. Our waitress came and checked on us many times to make sure that things were going great. Other servers dropped by and asked us how we were doing as well. I don't come here much often, but the food is good whenever I come, so I am satisfied with this place. I will most likely be returning one of these nights. It's pricey, but it's expected for these kind of restaurants."
Samantha C.,Bay Area,119,437,510,1.0,5/13/2011,"The food is below par and the service is complete crap. Each and every time I have been to this place, I leave annoyed. If I could give zero stars, I definitely would. The only reasons as to why I have been here in the past is because it is close to home and at a convenient location.  The very first time I went here, the service was unbelievably bad. Our waitress continuously got our orders wrong and she even wrongfully brought our condiments to another table. We ordered a pizza without sun-dried tomatoes and when we got it she actually omitted all tomatoes, fresh and sun-dried. She barely apologized nor were we compensated for their mistake.  Another time I went, I ordered a bake potato and my boyfriend ordered a sandwich. We waited for 30+ minutes when our server finally decides to come to tell us that something went wrong with their potatoes so they had to throw everything away and start the cooking process over. As soon as he finished talking, he walked away. He did not ask if I wanted to order something different nor did he offer to bring out my boyfriend's sandwich first. The waiter never apologized nor did the manager. Ten minutes later, our food came and it was mediocre.    The food is honestly not amazing for the prices that they charge and the service is impeccably poor. People dine out for the experience and of course the food too, but this place has neither to offer. I would rather drive further and go to The Cheesecake Factory instead, where the food is good and where my business is appreciated."
Lisa S.,"Fremont, CA",192,353,766,4.0,12/16/2014,I rarely ever go to BJ's just because of the fact that every location makes me wait so long for decent food. They do have a good selection of their pizzas which they are know for but I usually stick to the appetizers and salad.
Mary T.,"Newark, CA",15,2,2,4.0,6/29/2015,"My choice for dinner brought us to BJ's in Newark, Ca. I wanted to change things up and didn't want my usual drink. Our kind waitress Jessica Watson (last name because we found out their are about 4 Jessica's that work there.) recommended a drink called ""drink like that"" it was so tasty that  I was drinking it to fast the alcohol caught up to me later. That was fine because the food was good. And you can't end the evening with out getting dessert. We ordered the trio of pazookies. We chose chocolate chip, triple chocolate & my favorite peanut butter but with a twist they were trying something new. They placed Jam in top of the cookie so it tasted like a PB & J sandwich. Thanks Jessica"
Rita K.,"Union City, CA",617,592,299,3.0,5/15/2013,"A solid 3 stars. There may be a wait during dinner time, especially on weekends, so I recommend making reservations ahead of time. The food here is okay, but the pizzas are really good, especially the buffalo chicken one! I recommend coming here during HH after work (I think it ends at 6pm) for half off mini pizzas! Their HH specials for drinks aren't that much of a discount, $1 off drinks for the most part. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've been here a bunch of times over the past few years and I never had a problem with their food. I recommend buffalo chicken pizza, cobb salad, and their wings. The 5 pepper wings (extra hot) isn't that spicy at all, so all you spicy lover freaks would be able to eat it with no sweat. The pizookie is what BJ's is known for. Delicious melted cookie with ice cream on top dessert... mmmm. Might come here for my birthday for the free pizookie.  We watched a Warriors playoff game here once near the bar, we had to call in advance to reserve one of the tall table with stools and got a great view of the big TV screen. I recommend coming here for sports games! Lots of screens everywhere with volume."
Dani K.,"Brentwood, CA",23,10,2,2.0,4/26/2015,Plates smelled like egg. Food was good. Service was okay. Asked for plates and never got them.
Min L.,"Fremont, CA",0,21,5,2.0,11/19/2015,"11/19 Thursday night. First time in this BJ, not impressed.  Sanding front of the host ( Sandra ) for 5 minutes. She never acknowledged, greeting, or even looked at us. She wasn't rude, but just looked very confused and stressed."
Dani S.,"Fremont, CA",213,15,3,2.0,12/13/2015,"Dined here multiple times for the past few years.  I'm only giving this place 2 stars because I feel like it has SO much potential to be an amazing restaurant and bar but managment had dropped the ball. The service here is always really slow and it takes a good 40 minutes just to get your appetizers,  to find it cold and not even worth eating. The food is okay but I can say 9 out of 10 times something is wrong with it.  And don't get me wrong I'm not the type to be picky when ordering or asking for ""everything on the side"" but it's usually that one thing you don't ask for will be on your plate. For example my birthday a couple years back a ordered a pasta with no meat. My plate finally comes out and not only did I find a peace of sausage in my pasta I also found a peace of plastic. The manager was generous enough to have my tables meal be comp'd. But seriously?! C'mon BJ's step it up!"
Daniel H.,"Hayward, CA",93,40,41,2.0,8/28/2014,"So I haven't been to BJ's in a while because I'm trying not to pay a bunch of money for awesome irresistible desserts all the time (*cough* PIZZOOKIE!!! *cough*). But they got me: free Pizzookie if you download the app and order on the app!!! I don't know if I've ever downloaded an app faster... So I committed the great sin of deliciousness, and headed straight over. When I went to check in at the restaurant, I swear the hostess saw me, thought of greeting me, then decided against it. The manager had to nudge her, then she finally greeted me and got me seated. I told her about my order that had already been placed, and she told me my server would be out shortly. Okay... So I waited forEVER for a server to bring me WaTer and verify my order. They took a long time AGAIN to finally bring me my Pizzookie.  The Pizzookie wasn't amazing, but it met my expectations at least - slightly over cooked but otherwise still a big cookie with ice cream. :) The best part? When I told the manager how bad the service was he did not care AT ALL!!! Don't worry, man, I won't be back to get any more of that service. 1 star for the service, 1 added for a free Pizzookie that was slightly overcooked. No return trips intended."
Stacy V.,"Patterson, CA",28,16,46,4.0,2/24/2014,"We took our 8 year old son to this place for his birthday because he wanted to order the ribs. We told the waitress that it was his birthday! Thinking he will get something...a small cupcake, or some ice cream... Or something.... We waited.... And..... Nope! Nothing! I haven't been to a restaurant where they don't do anything! I mean for the price you pay for the food, you would expect something.   The food was great here! Loved every bite. So we ordered buffalo wings and they only give a few wings for $9.50. Ya I think that's a little over priced. Anyway overall the wait staff was good and so was the food."
Kelly H.,"Grand Blanc, MI",1,26,28,5.0,11/13/2014,"I've eaten here about 5 times in the last 3 weeks.  I'm impressed by the extensive menu a since I'm staying at a nearby hotel. They have consistently good quality.  Tonight, April was my waitress.  She only works Thursday and Friday; but so far she has been the best!  I've eaten Mahi tacos twice, Ahi Poke twice, avocado egg rolls, and a salad.  All were good quality and fresh. Hefeweizen was good - better than Claim Jumpers by far.  Close to Hacker Schorr.  One night we had bad service in a group of 6, but the manager was quick to recover.   I'll be back again.  Ahi poke was the best!"
Ricardo G.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,5,2.0,3/25/2016,"Waiter was excellent, food on the other hand seemed to be sitting under the heating for a while. When I received my meal, my deep dish ravioli was Luke warm. disappointed"
Kayla F.,"Newark, CA",301,39,41,3.0,12/28/2015,Bj's has a great variety of food. When my best friend and I went it was a bit crowded. The service was slow but it seemed to be slow because of the lack of staff members. I ordered a bison burger that was really undercooked and usually I like meat rare but this was a bit bloody. My friend ordered a salmon over rice and beans that looked super healthy and made to perfection.
William M.,"Irvine, CA",68,420,1709,2.0,11/9/2013,"The problem with this BJ's location is that they don't have any close-by competition to keep them on their toes, such as Yard House, Cheesecake Factory, etc. As a result, the gaggle of self-chatty hostesses hand you a pager with a 15 minute wait, direct you into the bar area, where there's a full menu but not enough wait staff to give prompt service.  Why not just have a wait list for everyone?  We may have been better off just waiting the 15 minutes for a regular table. The food is likely to be BJ's the usual good BJ's selections, but unfortunately it's not here yet...waiting...waiting..."
Sarah L.,"Flushing, NY",19,149,140,3.0,1/6/2014,My little cousin was raving about this place so we took him. Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory...don't know if that's good or bad. Highlight = Pizookie
