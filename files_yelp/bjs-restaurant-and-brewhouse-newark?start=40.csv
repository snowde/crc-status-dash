Brandon D.,"San Lorenzo, CA",203,90,197,4.0,5/29/2017,"BJs is the place to be at! It's definitely always going to be busy here, but you've got to know the right time to go. I came here for my birthday and decided I'd also try my luck coming during dinner hours. Got here around 7 PM and it was definitely packed. I came with a party of 2, so that definitely helped things along. The wait was only about ~20 minutes, so it definitely wasn't as bad of a wait that I bet other people had to wait for. There's plenty of seating available at this location.  If you're looking for some good ol' fashioned American foods, you've come to the right place! They've got pretty much any sort of food you can think of. They've got salads, pizzas, burgers, fries, ribs, steaks, drinks. The list goes on and on, if you can think of it, BJs probably serves it. If she's working during the time you're there, I highly recommend asking for April. She's kind, patient, funny, and all around awesome! I decided to get a drink to start off my meal, and started with the fried calamari as an appetizer. Because it was pretty busy, I expected the entrees to come a little while after so to have some time to enjoy the appetizer. To my surprise, the entrees came out right away! We got burgers and the steak special. All that came out, you can say, pretty much with the appetizers, so we had a ton of food to eat at the same time! Everything was very flavorful and juicy. Despite how busy it was for dinner time, my food was cooked perfectly, medium rare quality and everything came out in a timely manner. When it came down to dessert, we of course got the pizookies! Since it was my birthday too, we were able to get a mini pizookie on the house! We were able to try and mix and match flavors which is awesome when you love sweets and desserts but can't seem to choose exactly the dessert flavors you want! Service was awesome, especially during the busy hours. April, our server, was awesome! She was especially patient when it came to making the crucial decision of what to have for dessert. Not only that, she was also patient and had recommendations when it came to what flavors to get in terms of pizookies. All the food was cooked beautifully and filled with flavor. Will definitely come again to enjoy the good foods with good company! Definitely come to BJs!"
Nataly G.,"Union City, CA",2,146,77,4.0,3/28/2017,"My family and I come here on occasion, mostly Sundays. What's cool is that there is a mall across the street that has an AMC so it's pretty convenient! It does get a bit crowded sometimes if you go later on in the afternoon.  My all time favorite dish is the 5 meats pizza, it comes in the pan(dish?) that it was cooked in and all pizzas come like this so the pizza is fresh and hot! The crust is amazing it's fluffy yet crunchy and flavorful and the toppings are awesome!  We usually get pizza when we come because it's always a hit! However this last time my dad got a burger and couldn't finish it because he said the meat tasted off and was cold. So we defiantly recommend ordering pizza! The staff never seems to be in a good mood so that's  why I unfortunately docked off a star, they're slow to take your order, never get you refills and the hostess can often times be grumpy."
Joey V.,"San Diego, CA",107,102,63,5.0,5/11/2017,Came here twice  The first time Cassandra our sever made my party feel unwelcome. She took forever to take our orders and to bring our drinks. We receivers our appetizer but gave us small plates when we were already more than half way done with it. We asked for a straw for our drinks and she never came back after she acknowledged that she was going to get us some. The second time April was our server and changed my whole perspective about their customer service. She made it fun and did not make my party feel ignored. She is the best server I've had at this restaurant.  I was hesitant to give this place no stars because of my first incident here with Cassandra but April made it so much better. Give this girl a raise because she deserves it.
Rachael M.,"Fremont, CA",68,25,7,3.0,12/8/2017,"The food is more like a 4 star when you dine in.  Unfortunately, they started offering delivery and it's less than ok.  We call DoorDash and placed a order a few weeks ago it took 2 hours and was not warm.  We decided to try again on their web site delivery, you place your order thinking they are delivering and all they did is add a fee to the door dash fee and assign to DoorDash. Took 2.3 hours and disappointing again.  Do it, and do It well, or don't do it at all."
Kamiya M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",195,58,22,4.0,9/21/2017,"Love the pizookie there, along with the jambalaya. Their Vanilla Cream Soda is a must try if you have not tried it before. It's my favorite late night hangout place as it is open quite late on weekdays as well. The ambience is pretty cool too !"
Khang N.,"Foster City, CA",45,5,,2.0,8/26/2017,"The beer is good. That's about it.  Everything else sucked.  We ordered their Nashville hot and their brunch egg combo.  Their sweet potato fries were cold and hard. Their sunny side up eggs were eclipse from even being decent with old potato hash.  Go to Country Way just down the street. The  food is infinitely better with real bacon, not whimsy limp ones here."
Learnee L.,"Emeryville, CA",39,663,86,4.0,3/22/2017,I'm never a fan of franchise restaurants and I've had bad food experience from other BJ locations so I wasn't looking forward to going with my girls to this place. Came in Tuesday for early dinner and d place is crowded. Parking area close to d entrance is full but thank God for more parking spots on d other side closer to d gas station. We were a group of 9 but we were able to get seats right away. Service was good. Food came in pretty quick. I ordered the super salad and it was great. The pizookie was on sale that night so all my girls got one. I unfortunately am cutting on sugar so I opted to skip it. Big screens to watch sports. Bar was hustlin but wasn't packed.  Restroom was clean.  I'll give it a 4 star.
Kathy T.,"Hayward, CA",304,104,139,4.0,4/18/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite places to get ""American food""- I think that's the best way to explain it? I go here a lot because like I said, it's one of my FAVS!  APPETIZERS: -Stuffed mushrooms: 4/5 I have no clue what goes inside these little mushroom but it tastes amazing! Perfect combo of crunch with softness. Only reason not 5/5 is the price. You only get 5-6 mushroom for about $13. I only get these when I'm balling!  -Calamari: 4/5  I love that BJ's give two dipping options for their calamari, fav is the white sauce! Calamari here has the perfect crunch. Same reason for it not being 5/5.... why is it so expensive! Such a small plate for basically the same price as an entree.  -Avocado egg rolls: 3/5  My boyfriend loves these but I'm not the biggest fan. I think it's too much avocado? I'm also not a huge fan of the Asian like sauce, reminds me of sweet and sour. Of everyone I know, I'm probably the only one that isn't a huge fan of these egg rolls.  -Chicken tortilla soup: 5/5 Hands down my absolute favorite tortilla soup, EVER! I'm serious! I love those soup, I've tried chicken tortilla soup at many other places, nothing fulfills my craving like BJ's! ENTREES:   -Blacken Atlantic salmon: 5/5 My favorite! I have no idea how they do it! It has the perfect taste and the sauce that comes on the salmon, delicious! Comes with rice and steamed veggies, great combo. -Chicken Parmesan: 5/5  Usually this plate comes with red sauce. I'm not a fan or red sauce (marinara) but at bj's it's a delicious lemon white sauce! I order extra of that! AMAZING! The chicken is nice and crunchy with the amazing sauce poured over it. Side of mash potatoes and broccoli....... YUMMERS!  DESSERTS:  -Bizzokie aka Huge cookies! 6/5  Cookies and cream is my favorite. But so far whatever I tried is still pretty good as well!  BEERS: They have ""brew house"" in their name, meaning their beers should be good. I agree with that fact! I enjoy their Hefes and blonds. I like their berry cider but I DO NOT like their pear cider.... taste like cleaning appliances.  TIPS- if you know you're coming out name down on their app! Worth it! Also, on your birthday they give you a free mini bizzoki! :)"
Danae L.,"Fremont, CA",360,430,79,3.0,4/17/2017,"I don't think they have happy hour, but regardless it's still a great place or small bites and drinks. I came on a Saturday night with friends and there was a 50 minute wait. We started started with a few alcoholic drinks and calamari. I wish the calamari was served in smaller bits and slightly crispier. I ordered the shrimp tacos with tortilla chips. I asked for nothing spicy but still received salsa that was too much to handle. There was barely enough tortilla chips and insufficient shrimp in my tacos. The waiter was probably new because she had a hard time working their system."
Stanley Y.,"Union City, CA",313,158,51,2.0,8/23/2016,"The menu is too large for their own good. About half of it is actually edible. Certain dishes are amazing, some are pretty good, and others taste worse overcooked boiled chicken.  I think people just come here for the decor, ambiance, and pizookies. If you come here, stick to burgers, pizzas, drinks, and pizookies (they would 5 stars if they stuck to those). Skip appetizers if you're not that hungry.  I ordered the Late Night Burger. It was pretty good, but my medium rare came out well done... almost too well. The burger would have been slightly dry if I didn't add generous amounts of hot sauce. I know it says its an open faced burger, but do you really have to but the patty halfway on each bun? Presentation was underwhelming since the over easy egg was too wide and covered everything else. Fries were okay and tasted a bit stale like they sat in the kitchen window a bit too long. Pizza is always a safe bet. Do not get any of the pasta or rice dishes. Pasta is under-seasoned every time. Jambalaya is an exorbitant $17 but isn't even close to authentic and was way too salty. Pizookies! This is the best thing here. They have a supersized pizookie that is not on the menu. For $25, you'll get a giant half baked cookie the size of a large pizza with half a gallon of ice cream stacked on the center. Their alcoholic mixed drinks are pretty good. About $10 each. Service is usually good, but the waiter whose name starts with a K gave us the check way too early."
Sheila H.,"Fremont, CA",1,20,13,1.0,12/9/2017,"Came down with the flu and my kids wanted BJ's tonight. We call several times no answer, then we order on line. We waited 20 minutes to pick up our food. However, we waited another 35 minutes for our dinner. Upon getting home we see that several items from our order were missing and the potato skins were cold, only (2) skin had cheese and no sauce that normally comes with the skins NOT included. Tried calling manager however NO answer. It was not just one thing missing from our order SEVERAL. That's why I feel it's necessary to let them know they ruin our family dinner."
Nick S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",28,129,12,1.0,8/4/2017,"Went here with family yesterday. Knew there wasn't a lot of vegan options but that's fine. Asked for pasta with tomato sauce said no meat no cheese. Arrived covered in Parmesan cheese and I said is that cheese I asked for no meat no cheese. Guy says yeah it's cheese. I said again that I asked for no meat and no cheese and he then asked if I wanted him to take it back. I said yes. 5 minutes later the manager came out to let me know that the meatballs have Parmesan in them, I tell him I just want noodles and tomato sauce, no cheese, no meat. Dish comes back out 10 minutes later and silently put down. Giant roll covered in butter on top.  I don't mind that there's few vegan options I don't expect every restaurant to have good choices but I don't understand when my order is wrong and they act like it's my fault."
Vikash S.,"Fremont, CA",2,28,6,5.0,9/28/2017,Duty manager on Sunday get 5 star he just turned the bitter experience into a smile. We will come Back again. Thank you again
Vineet J.,"Redwood City, CA",52,41,14,1.0,11/5/2017,"I waited 14 minutes from when I sat down to when I left but no one came to my table to take my order or offer me water. I asked a waiter to call my server, and he said he would- but instead he and 4 other waiters started talking and splitting tips in a corner for more than 10 min. Note that this was 4 pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was not busy. I will not be coming here again."
Adrian G.,"Hayward, CA",424,39,2,3.0,11/21/2017,"In terms of this place in general it meets the requirements. Came for pizookies and wine everything came out delicious but I have to say the service was below par, never want to be that guy but we did wait 45 minutes which was a bit off putting given another 15 minute wait for the check, they were having a real hectic night I'm assuming this isn't something that happens a lot place is kept well together!"
Celena Z.,"Union City, CA",6,24,35,4.0,7/25/2017,"Just ended my day by coming to Bj's. Ordered a calamari appetizer and was a little disappointed on how much I paid for the calamari and how little I got.  The Oreo pizookie is to die for! I think it's the best out of all of them. But overall, Michael our server was super friendly and did a great job."
Tarcisio G.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",16,40,12,4.0,9/28/2017,Love this place! I come here to have a beer and appetizers.  Tonight I did not like that there was people waiting around for tables and some employees had a glass of water on one table simulating busy table for themselves and their friends while still wearing bjs uniforms.  Our waiter was the best.. friendly and quick to respond to our needs.
Sarah L.,"Union City, CA",294,111,416,4.0,7/15/2017,My husband and I went here on a Friday night for date night. You have to be prepared to roam the parking lot for days just to find a spot.. We ended up parking by the gas station across the street.. I think it's the Overflow parking lot.? After all that once we got in the weight time was ridiculous.. but expected on a Friday night! Luckily there was bar seating open and we were able to sit right away! (Bar seating available first-come first-serve which includes high top tables) we were greeted by the server who was very pleasant. I ordered the classic burger with french fries and my husband ordered the mahi mahi tacos (fried). When our food came it was PERFECT! MY BURGER WAS SO JUICY AND HAD A GREAT CHAR ON THE OUTSIDE! The Buns had a great toast on the inside and had a nice gloss on top. The french fries were perfectly fried and had a great crunch as well.  The mahi-mahi tacos were also made perfectly! It was fried but NOT dry and was nice and flaky. Great flavors BUT the green stuff I think it was a guacamole sauce . It tasted a bit funny almost over ripe?  It was also nice that the manager stopped by to see how everything was.  No complaints here except for the parking lol We would definitely come back!
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,3.0,6/20/2016,"Nearly twenty-four hours after the Golden State Warriors loss (Game 7, 2016 vs. Cleveland), there should be an empty hole inside me. Thankfully, the BJ's deep dish filled up the void. With all the sports TV's, I couldn't have unassumingly picked a better place; every shoulder turn there's a new TV to look at. The staff must hate LeBron James because as soon as it cut to his post-game interview, they cut off the sound. LeBron is a true nemesis but I can't deep down not admire the guy; I could have listened to him for a couple minutes. You'd think as a Warriors fan I'd be all for the Golden Pilsners, but not quite. I almost never go without the Jeremiah Red Beer (toasty amber hue). And I never finish without doing a Pazookie (baked cookie with ice cream on top). This particular staff is almost rock solid. I only found one of the four hostesses a little airhead-y, but the waiters and waitresses like to think two steps ahead of the customers (except when it comes to the cheque; I'll wave anybody down after this much waiting post-Pazookie. Come on!) Good kid's menu. Good coloring book and crayons. Good iced water. Good beer (for me). Solid 3-stars, but there's upside here if you need sports TV viewing. SUBSEQUENT TRIP HERE: We ordered a pizza, pasta dish and pazookie dessert and they all came at the same time, that means, dripping ice cream on cookie when we're just trying to start on pizza. Idiotic. #likereally"
Samina M.,"Fremont, CA",8,1,,2.0,9/23/2017,"We have been to Newark bj's multiple time, the food and service is always good, yesterday it was my son's birthday and he picked bj's. Our host was good she was very friendly that is why I added 1 star but the food was not good we ordered 2 app sets of calamari it was very salty and overly battered and seems like was fried in an old oil our main dishes was not as expected also we ordered jalapeño burger and it was totally burnt but last we ordered birthday pazooki ice cream the cookie was very doughy it was under cooked so basically bj's ruined my son's birthday we walked out  unhappy."
