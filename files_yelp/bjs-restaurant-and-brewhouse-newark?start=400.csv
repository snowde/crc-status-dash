Sahil D.,"San Leandro, CA",20,15,1,2.0,2/28/2015,"So we were at this Place on a Tuesday night. I started to experience their bad service in first 10 mins. The waiter said she would be back to take our order in 2 mins and she din show up for 15mins. Some other waiter asked us if we want something (without even a smile on her face). We ordered and after 5 mins the first waitress   shows up and puts plates on our table WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT US, then the pasta was bad (tasted like they warmed up frozen pasta) and garlic bread was cold. Upon telling the waitress that the bread is cold she said ""I can microwave it for you"" b*tch I don't come here to eat microwaved food. BAD FOOD, BAD SERVICE!!!!"
Smash S.,"Fremont, CA",6,56,121,1.0,7/23/2014,"Always bad service, always a long wait for food. We've now been waiting 40 minutes for 2 pizookies & 2 small pizzas........ I've only had good service from nico & amanda. You're better off ordering to go, but their food isn't all that anyways so you should probably just cook at home."
Vira P.,"San Francisco, CA",336,1141,1134,3.0,4/5/2013,"I got the mahi-mahi off their lower-calorie menu.  I guess lower calories mean less portions.  It was small compared to the rest of the menu.  But it was pretty good so I can't complain too much. As always, I ordered the avocado egg rolls to start.  The egg rolls were good, but the tamarind sauce was watery, as if they're trying to make their inventory last longer. The highlight, of course, is the pizookie.  Can't go wrong with a pizookie. Service was fast and friendly.  So basically it's just your average BJ's Restaurant."
Tara L.,"Caulstown, Republic of Ireland",38,30,2,4.0,3/15/2016,"My friends and I ordered to go. We got pizza, stuffed mushrooms,  lettuce wraps and dessert, the baked beignet. Food was soooo good. Packaged perfectly, not soggy. Food had perfect tempature."
Ryan D.,"San Leandro, CA",152,393,17,2.0,12/31/2012,"Newbie. But I'm not missing out.  Your hard-earned nine bucks will give you ten small boneless ""wings."" I think that's a little too overpriced. Unless it came with an actual BJ.  Catch up with a friend over a pazookie here. That's all I recommend."
Jo L.,"San Jose, CA",22,218,24,2.0,9/8/2014,"Had the BBQ chicken pizza and hooooly crap it was sooo salty! Imagine a delicious looking BBQ pizza, you could probs find a pic here and now imagine a mound of salt on top. Not just as a garnish. Nope, just obnoxiously sitting on top of your pizza ruining every bite.  If it weren't for being a bit buzzed from a pitcher of their Berry cider, I would've cried a river of SALTY AF tears."
Eric H.,"Salinas, CA",49,69,22,1.0,6/17/2014,"We get our table at 5:30pm. Our entire group had arrived(11 people total)and ordered at 6:10pm. There was no one checking on us or offering water ( many of us were out for some time) and we complained to the suppose manger at around 6:55pm for at least water. Some of us got their appetizer but no plates at around 7pm. Then finally some of us start receiving our food at around 7:25pm.... REALLY!!!!! There was even 2 orders that were wrong or forgotten. This was on a Tuesday evening, isn't this suppose to be a easier day of the week for a restaurant? The one star doesn't express the frustration and hunger we had. I don't know what was happening in the back but the server could of attended to us a bit more, could of even improved our impression at BJ's.  We tried to have their dessert, which we heard was good, but they are still messing up. 2 more orders were taken incorrectly or done wrong and it's 8:16pm.... After everything we were given a discount but it still no excuses for this to happen to anyone. If what we heard was true, the girl who served us was very knew, which would explain why she couldn't seem to handle everything that was going on. She shouldn't have been given such a large group or have some one help her out. I feel bad for her but not for the business, this could of been avoided with better training and leadership...."
Bridgett W.,"Seattle, WA",404,240,302,5.0,11/9/2014,"We love BJ's. Always great service and this location did well to keep it up. We were seated right away, got delicious food from a friendly server, and enjoyed the dark, chilled out atmosphere. We were happy they were open late on a weeknight too because we had postponed our dinner until after we went to the nearby mall."
Jessica B.,"San Leandro, CA",69,229,65,4.0,12/7/2014,"Haley is the best! I have a history of having horrible service at BJs (all BJs, not any ones in particular) so I want to praise good service here whenever I come across it! Came here one busy Sunday evening with a party of 8- a few of them being foreigners with limited English. We had Haley as a waitress and she was AMAZING! Really kind and patient with our semi-difficult table. When she left to go on her break our service declined significantly so we had to talk to the manager to get her back."
Lynn D.,"Fremont, CA",241,4,,4.0,8/4/2016,"I love this place, the staffs here are so nice and friendly. The food are great w very reasonable price. Would definitely recommanded friends and family"
Jared T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,12,,1.0,10/15/2015,"I don't expect a world class meal when I order lunch from a place like this, but I do expect something to taste better than what my 3 year old made me for breakfast this morning. A coworker and I ordered the shrimp scampi to go. When we got back to work to eat it (a 2 minute drive) we realized that the pasta had absolutely no flavor. There was no salt used when cooking, It seemed as if there was no sauce on the noodles, and when i dipped my finger into the small amount of sauce on the bottom to see if maybe it wasn't sticking to the noodles, I found that it was nothing but starchy water with a little oil. The shrimp had the same quality you get from a bag of frozen shrimp from Safeway for 8.99. I understand this isn't Forbes Mill and I don't hold them to this standard, but when I spend 18.00 dollars on a single lunch I expect to take more than one bite before I throw it in the garbage."
Eva H.,"San Ramon, CA",53,217,10,2.0,9/27/2014,"Why do my in-laws insist on going here.  I can't stand this place but I wasn't part of the decision for dinner.  The service was good so nothing against our server.  The food however, ugh, just eat before you go -  How do you screw up a Mango salad?   Answer: you make the chicken dry and you don't use ripe mangos and you don't put any dressing on it.   Who makes the worst salad ever?   Answer: BJ's, that's who."
Ann H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,41,5,3.0,1/15/2016,"The place is clean and the food is good. I love the ribs here!  However, there were a few instances when I ordered off the lunch menu and was charged the dinner price. When we asked the server about this, she didn't make any effort to resolve the issue. I let it go since the dish was already consumed. If she knew the item was on the lunch and dinner menu, she should ask which one we wanted.  This happened again when ordering to-go. I was charged the dinner price ordering off the lunch menu.  Although I enjoyed my meal, I realize I have to be diligent so I don't get charged extra."
Amy L.,"Santa Clara, CA",401,747,273,3.0,6/14/2011,"Sorry, gotta bump it down to three stars. Came with the boy + some friends for my friend's graduation. We called ahead of time [45 minutes] to reserve a table for 10, but they said reservations were booked, although they don't take reservations much earlier. The boy and I rushed over after congratulating our friend. Luckily, they had a no-show, so they had a table for us. We only had to wait for about 30 minutes, which was how long it took for our friend&the rest of the party to show, anyway. The staff was super nice about our friends taking awhile to come. It got reallyyy busy about 10-15 minutes after the boy&I got there, which was understandable [graduation season]. Anyway, our waiter was pretty nice and brought out waters for everybody promptly. Took us awhile to decide what to order, but we had fun waiting for the food. However,  the food definitely took longer that I thought it would to prepare. Appetizers were decent [pesto chicken flat bread, tortilla chips with artichoke dip, potato skins].  The boy&I ended up splitting a medium Great White deep dish pizza. Price was alright, and the pizza was definitely more than enough for us [we had 3 slices left to take home]. I was so disappointed in it, though. Compared to the legit Chicago Pizza that I've had since I last was here, it was.... mediocre. The crust was soggy, the flavor was bland [I needed ranch! On an Alfredo-based pizza. What the heck!], and it was just... okay.  Pizookie was still delicious, but gotta bump them down a star for mediocre food. Oh, and there's nothing really brewed at this ""brewhouse."" They say that cherry coke&root beer are ""brewed"" here, but last time I checked, neither of those require fermentation, so it doesn't really count. False Advertisement! :P Oh well."
Mindy R.,"Newark, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/26/2017,"I would give this place 0 stars if that was an option. Being there are limited places in the area to accommodate a large party of people we didn't have much choice but to eat here.  I blame the management for the problems we had. They had a weeks notice about our party of 30 and clearly did not prepare. After being seated one waiter took our drink and appetizer order and then I guess he left so after a half hour we finally tracked a server down who took drink orders again and then promptly forgot what we ordered. The manager was clearly overwhelmed and did not have a handle on the restaurant. After the waiter brought half of the drinks we ordered and forgot what the order was that he took 15 minutes before he then proceeded to argue with our table that he didn't take that order the other guy did and he just got here. We reminded him that we just gave the order to him. I don't know if he was high or had a learning disability but he was not all there. When the dinner order was finally taken needless to say we were a little nervous and with good reason, as the dishes started coming out things were not what we ordered and there was more confusion. To top it off the man paying for the dinner did not get his food.  After the third time of being told it was coming the waiter finally admitted it was given to somebody else.. wtf. There was no offer of compensation for the bill which when finally tallied was 1,296 a good gesture of the manager would have been to take 10-20% off the bill. The bathrooms were disgusting no toilet paper in the stalls and again excuses from the staff 'the hostess is supposed to take care of this, there is supposed to five of them' PATHETIC is the best way to describe the restaurant and the staff we had people from all over the world and it is a shame that i as one of the American's in the group was extremely embarrassed by the quality of service and treament we rececived."
Cath M.,"San Francisco, CA",319,1086,1075,4.0,9/11/2010,"I asked the girlfriend where she wanted to eat... she said: I want beer. OK. I suggested this spot since it's along the way home... and I've been craving their ""sweet pig"" so we got here around 4ish... apparently that's still their Happy Hour in the bar area... we didn't know that until we saw the bill! Awesome! We ordered the following: - Garlic Parmesan Kettle-Style Chips  = it was my first time tasting it and I'm a BIG fan! It was delicious! So crispy and it very addictive! Girlfriend and I couldn't stop munching on it! I'll definitely get this next time around! - Mini sweet pig = it hit the spot! I inhaled this sucker in no time! Tasty and overloaded with toppings! - Mini southwestern for the girlfriend and she inhaled it as well (she just ran a 10K so it was no biggie for her!)  - BJ's Famous Pizookie = never really had this but since she was uber excited about this... we had to get it. This a deadly dessert. After eating it, I'm trying to schedule in my head the days I'm hitting the gym and the rides that I'll do! Yah, talk about guilt trip! Our server was here and there... she forgot my drink so my friend was annoyed but it was ok to me. Its another hit or miss spot. When we got the bill... my friend and I were shocked. Damn... we grubbed and it was just $27! Yup... with the food and dessert and my friend's beer... we rocked it! PS: they don't serve Hanger One so ... eh for the bar part!? =)"
Cynthia B.,"Fremont, CA",234,159,69,4.0,11/13/2014,"I actually really enjoy the pizza here, and it's one of my go to places for when I'm craving some deep dished or hand tossed pizza. My boyfriend and I especially love the chicken with white sauce. So much flavor and deliciousness!  We usually come here and have to wait but the wait never seems long for me because we are either playing charades with my family. Or if we are alone, we'll have plenty to talk about to let the time pass. The service is also pretty good, they've always been really nice and polite to me. On one rare occasion, they did keep forgetting to give us cheese and hot peppers for the pizza after we asked multiple times. But I'll let that go since the food is good! Overall, it's a huge restaurant with good pizza and good service, definitely a good go to chain place."
Kathy L.,"Fremont, CA",3,14,1,1.0,6/19/2014,"So unhappy with this Newark restaurant. The quality of their food has dropped so far in the last year. Not sure what has happened but the end result is awful.  For the prices they charge, I expect to rave about everything I eat.  We used Grub Hub to order online and get the food delivered. Big mistake. Took over an hour to get a pizza and 2 sides delivered. Food was lukewarm and tasteless. We ordered a ""create your own"" hand tossed pizza. 25 bucks later we got a pizza with almost no toppings, no extra cheese that I ordered and the skimping on the toppings that did make it onto the pizza was offensive.  The first time I went to BJs I loved it. That was back in early 2013. In 18 months I don't know what happened but nothing I've eaten at this restaurant since then has been worth my patronage.  Be warned!!!"
Daniel D.,"Hayward, CA",6,12,6,5.0,4/3/2015,"There was a 30min wait for a table, but it was made all better when they brought pizza to us in the waiting area. When I come here, it's for the Chile Verde Fries (appetizer) & a pizookie, but they're always good."
Jana L.,"San Francisco, CA",201,360,640,4.0,2/2/2013,"I'm a fan for their constantly good American Food!  Their appetizers are really yummy!  I've tried chicken wings, calamari, and the spinach & artichoke dip here.  All were pretty consistent!  I love calamari, so eating this was really satisfying. I usually get the porkchops here or the sandwiches.  The lunch specials have good soup/salad/sandwich combos!  They're priced REALLY well too! :)   I like the porkchops for dinner because they provide a variety of things to munch on.  You get potatoes, meat, and vegetables!  Deep dish pizza is also really good here too but I'm picky with the toppings so I usually just don't end up getting it. AND LASTLY... the pizzookies are like absolute BEAUTIES.  It's literally ice cream on top of a cookie but why the hell is it SO DAMN GOOD.  I get the macademia nut all the time!!!!  But the best combo is the macademia nut + oreo half and half.  OMG.  Like, pure deliciousness.  Because I mean, you need some chocolate in your pizzookie!  I've also had the raspberry white chocolate one, and that one was also really good.  Ughhhhh, I want a pizzookie just talking about this!  Om nom noms.  The food is good.  Go."
