Jack K.,"Irvine, CA",10,5,2,1.0,8/16/2015,Worst service I have ever experienced. We ordered online ahead at 635 to be seated by 7 got seated by 715 and didn't get our food until 745-750 and when the food got to us it was cold. The medium rare burger I got turned into a well done and our appetizer hasn't come. It still hasn't as I am typing this review at 8:10pm. DO NOT COME HERE. Terrible terrible service
Justin C.,"San Leandro, CA",373,777,899,3.0,6/27/2011,"After another visit, I have to say that BJ's stepped up their game. A lot better beer on tap and pretty tasty food. I had the Angus Pot Roast Sandwich. It has to be eaten with a knife and fork. Quite large wouldn't do this thing justice. It was huge, and tasty to boot. The Pizookie was rich and decadent. I could only muster up enough courage to take a couple of bites. I think I'll return."
Tiffany Michelle L.,"Fremont, CA",298,243,471,3.0,7/12/2013,"The new Bison burger was okay - kinda plain, I suggest they try a new or better sauce I'm not sure if the coleslaw was supposed to be dry with no liquid or not, but that is the way it came."
Nazz A.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,13,4,2.0,8/15/2015,Waited 15 min for a server. Turns out the server in our section went on break so no one was assigned to help us. Wtf.  Ordered a very berry margarita. Ive had it numeorus times.  Usually delicious. This one was terrible. Too strong. Every sip burned my throat lie i was taking a shot.  My bbq brisket burger was dry. Not enough sauce.  They forgot the ranch i ordered. Had to ask again.
Dyutika P.,"Fremont, CA",20,20,,2.0,7/30/2014,"Stick to their beers, the cocktails are too sweet and fruity. The service is too slow and lethargic"
Kyra S.,"Union City, CA",505,410,1205,4.0,10/7/2014,"The food was good, we had a large party reservation and we were seated quite quickly.  But when it came to using a coupon we waited forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  for it to get processed.  I am not sure if the girl was new or the manager or what . But overall it was a good experience with good food"
Randy R.,"Charlotte, NC",0,7,36,4.0,2/11/2016,"Good Food, pricey drinks.  Great service and local beers.  Busy on Thursday Night before the Super Bowl off the beaten path in Newark CA."
Arnab R.,"Fremont, CA",0,41,,2.0,8/15/2015,"Average food with very bad service. Waitress was very good and responsive, but the server just dumped the food, literally, on the table, all the time. And this is the first time ever I have to write about smaller portion size in any restaurant! Calamari fries came halfway full in the plate! I was wondering maybe something went wrong, but then noticed same orders for other tables, and they were all half full. Either increase the portion to full plate, or serve the same portion in a smaller plate, but don't keep it half full. Its a big time put off from customer perception point of view. And nobody came back to check on us to see if we want another round of beverages."
Yelp'y Yelper T.,"Fremont, CA",1,81,96,3.0,5/23/2014,"TGIF: Beer times are good times :-).  Always packed with sparsely open seating which is good, can find a spot even when busy.  Service is typically really good as the servers are cool and quick at what they do. Food always taste good but has 'upset' some bellies a time or two.  In one instance in March 2014, all the people at our table enjoyed the meal but got violently sick through the evening and into the next day. Because the meal impacted all of us we contacted the location and the managers comments were basically ""well, it happens, nothing I can do about it"", no apology or offers to make it up were given.  It didnt seem like he cared at all that our ENTIRE table got sick, kinda seemed like a normal occurrence for him.  Three calls (and messages) to corporate went unanswered, seemed like no one cared about us all getting food poisoning. Regardless, we keep going back for cold beers and good times, but are WAY MORE selective of the things we order, mainly Avocado egg rolls and flat pizza apps. My main gripe is that they call themselves a ""Brewhouse"" and the don't brew beer at all. Every drop is private labeled brewed for them by Saint Arnold brewery in Texas. Having mock serving tanks in every location is totally unethical, borderline fraud.   They deserve 2 stars but will be nice today and give them 3 because we enjoy the ambiance and meeting our friends there. Plus they are better (and slightly safer) than Jacks Brewery across town."
Zita Marie F.,"East Palo Alto, CA",1,9,8,3.0,1/7/2015,The food was amazing! The salmon dish was also good and I was satisfied even tho it don't scream my name when I received it but it was yummy! The baked lasagna dish was fantastic! First time going had a good server and enjoyed it the second time it was not so good the server didn't have great customer service possibly could of been having a bad day. I didn't feel so welcomed even though he looked like he was trying his best. But my family enjoyed the food so it didn't turn out to be a completely a bad time.
Drew C.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,11,,3.0,1/23/2016,"Decent place to grab a few beers, watch a sports game, and have some food. It won't blow you away, but just consistently solid."
Susan M.,"Hayward, CA",4,10,10,2.0,2/17/2016,Long wait time. Rude waiters and below average food. Only good thing about is its pretty clean and they good selection of beers
Mike P.,"Newark, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/24/2016,"We visited this place last night.  The service was horrible,  it took them 20 minutes just to take our order.  They didn't bring any silverware. Received my appetizer. Had to wait before they brought some out by that time it was cold.  The waiter was nice but she had way too many tables.  The food was good hence the 2 stars.  Advice to restaurant please hire more staff to meet the demands of of your customers."
Megan D.,"Davis, CA",125,24,7,2.0,1/2/2016,"When the food comes out on time and together, it ends up quite good. However the service is often awful, with orders cold, late or forgotten. But, a fine selection of beers."
Amy C.,"Newark, CA",1518,982,1731,4.0,11/30/2010,Loved the avacado egg rolls = yum! Pizooki = yummie too! Pretty elegant decor. So far I've tried this location & the San Bruno one. About the same. And I had this pear or berry cider at the San Bruno one which was delicious! I forgot what's it called though.
Michael V.,"San Jose, CA",60,80,,5.0,5/21/2014,"I came here this past Sunday night with a friend and just walked right in and sat in a booth in the open bar area. There were a couple napkins on the table, so i guess it looked like we had been there for a while. We didn't get helped for a couple minutes.   The waitress came by and super apologized because she just took over someone's shift and I guess we sat down at the exact time she took over. She was really considerate and went above and beyond what she needed to do as far as recognizing the situation and then blending it into the rest of our stay. Very professional.   Oh, the alcoholic root beer tastes way better in my head.  Next time I'll just get a normal root beer.   has no sweg."
E L.,"San Francisco, CA",58,52,4,2.0,3/15/2014,"I am currently at the restaurant right now and our visit is not pleasant. I called ahead to my name down and advise the hostess that I will be coming in 15 minutes. We arrived at BJ's and walked right in. There were two young ladies at the front. Neither of them acknowledge me and I had to initiate the conversation that I was present. I told then that I wanted to check-in because I called ahead of time. Forty minutes and our pager buzzed and we were seated. We then waited for fifteen minutes with no one either acknowledge ""We will be with you shortly or something along the lines of we're busy right now and we will take your order shortly."" I don't expect this type of service from a known and high-end restaurant.  I am not sure if they lack training or their employees are not happy with thier job. I don't want to put any names down so they can put training across the board.  Service = 1 Food = 3 Waiting = 2 Environment = 3 Overall = 2"
K K.,"Fremont, CA",16,23,2,1.0,2/3/2016,"This is one of the worst places I have been to, the service is terrible.  We went one night with party of eight and they made us wait for two hours.  The manager indicated that they accidentally took our name from list but did not offer an apology.   The service was terrible and I would never go here again."
Moe F.,"Fremont, CA",5,11,4,5.0,8/2/2015,"This is one of the best BJs Restaurant I have been too although I visited many different locations in California but this location is the BEST. They provide Excellent Service. As soon as I walk up to the Bar Area, Lawrence, Anthony, Loriane and Lance will have my drinks (H2O) ready and they even know how I like my appetizer's prepared. Last week I lost my Gold Premier Rewards Member's Card. I sent an email thru main corporate website and requested a replacement card. Few days later I revisited the same restaurant for dinner, while I was having dinner the Restaurant General Manager Mr. Evan Crisp walked up to me and greeted me by my name ""Moe"" which got me surprised and handed me a replacement GOLD PREMIER REWARDS Card without me asking for it. I was expecting a replacement card in the mail from the main corporate office. I was very impressed by the General Manager Mr. Evan Crisp. Not to mention that they have excellent food and beverage selections. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. Oh! yes, During the  NFL (Football) NBA (Basket Ball) & MLB (Baseball) season this is the BEST SPORTS BAR to hang out with friends and family."
Lauren L.,"Long Beach, CA",24,12,,1.0,3/8/2014,"I love Bjs food, so this is specifically for my service.  I myself being a server can understand when you're slammed or forget to grab something, but this guy checked on us once if you don't count him asking about the check (initials K.G). Our drinks when unfilled for a half hour, no exaggeration. My friend waited a good 15 minutes refusing to eat his pizza because he needed ranch. I had to flag down another server.  I feel like to get a good tip, you just got check on me after I get my food, mid way, and towards the end. It's free refills, so keep my water coming.  No tip for you."
