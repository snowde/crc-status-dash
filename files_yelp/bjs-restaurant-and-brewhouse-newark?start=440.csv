Edwin N.,"Fremont, CA",42,207,15,4.0,9/6/2014,"This has got to be one of the better chain restaurants out there. The food is good and the service even better. I've been to this location a few times and my experience has always been positive. The last time I was here I took my daughter out for lunch...we had pizza and beer and we both got carded! I thought this was hilarious cause I'm an old fart. Pizza was good, but not spectacular and the beer was also good. We had their house porter beer cause my daughter wanted to try it. I wanted something a little hoppier to pair with the pizza, but I went along with my girls choice. The staff was outstanding attending to our needs and several of the staff kept checking on us making sure everything was okay. All in all not bad food and excellent service."
Raj P.,"Hayward, CA",60,12,2,2.0,4/1/2014,"Thought to try them again as was not too happy with them the first time around.  First disappointment - the Cajun Pasta - most blend pasta I ever had anywhere. No spice at all. Tasted like it was just dipped in light tomato sauce. Second disappointment - ordered appetizers during happy hour and it was good but when we ordered more, we were told it would cost more since it was no longer happy hour. No problem with that. What was disappointing was when we were told that the portion would also be bigger because it was at regular price. Been to a lot of places during happy hour and always price was cheaper during happy hour but the portion was always the same. So happy hour price is not a big savings at BJ's since they also short you on the portion. Very disappointed in that little trick. Why not just remove the appetizers from happy hour since it's really a bait and switch."
Nancy H.,"Fremont, CA",1,10,5,1.0,2/25/2015,Came in with a Deaf group of people. Manager refused to turn on Captioning on their TV so we could follow the game.  Won't be coming back. Shame really because its a great hang out and good food.   Manager needs to learn American Disability Act because someone gonna sued them for not accomadating DEAF FOLKS.  Fremont especially where the State Deaf School is.. tons of deaf folks.  tisk tisk
Courtney K.,"Union City, CA",53,254,363,4.0,2/19/2013,"I love BJ's, I was so happy when this location opened because the only one around was in Cupertino. I love their artichoke & spinach pizza, avocado eggrolls and scampi pasta! Also you can't go to BJ's and not get a pizookie, you just wound't be doing it right. I also like the fact that you can call when you're on your way to put your name in."
Maria M.,"Union City, CA",23,52,48,4.0,10/26/2015,"I had stopped eating here because of the rushed poorly presented food and bad service. Today I was pleasantly surprised! Four stars for the great service this afternoon. Stephanie was courteous, prompt and attentive to our needs. As far as the food is concerned it's good, not great but it's way better than the last time I wrote a review a few years ago. I get a little concerned about the quality of the service and the food when the restaurant is busy. We were there late afternoon so it was pretty quiet. I still think even if it was busy Stephanie would have been able to handle it. I may almost be convinced to come back. I have to test it out on a busy day to confirm things have changed!"
Harry G.,"Union City, CA",11,60,16,2.0,9/13/2015,"A very busy, noisy, popular restaurant with attentive service. However, the food was mediocre. The Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was dry. The Cajun pasta with shrimp was bountiful but the noodles were overcooked and sauce was very watery. The angel hair pasta dish was bland."
J S.,"Maine, NY",0,57,16,3.0,10/26/2015,Not too bad for a chain. Ordered Santa Fe salad and a few house beers. Not the best option but adequate for dinner.
Aarron W.,"Orange, CA",473,526,407,3.0,12/14/2012,"Came here for lunch, and ordered chicken tortilla soup, and half of a chicken club sandwich. The waitress Cynthia was very polite and friendly, no problems with her. The soup was awesome, didn't taste too salty. The sandwich wasn't that great, it came with a greasy sourdough bread.  The pizza here is awesome so I would come back.   One more tip, the menu had about 30 pages and is confusing. It's better to do a few things awesome than a ton of items that are so/so."
Sally M.,"San Bruno, CA",75,10,3,1.0,5/20/2015,"My family and I came to eat here, we received nothing but bad customer service. The greeters and seaters were talking gossiping when we walked in. When we finally got seated, it took the waiter 30 minutes to introduce himself and ask us what we wanted to drink. When we finally our waiter finally came and we ordered our drinks it took him another 30 minutes for a cup of water! The waiter was really rude! When he came to give us our check, he slammed it on the table and walked away! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!"
Bevi K.,"Newark, CA",135,321,104,3.0,6/27/2014,"This is a great spot to indulge in food that's bad for you, and have a good time with friends. It is ALWAYS packed, so be prepared to wait. The customer service has gotten better over the years, but it's still not the best. It takes quite some time for the food to get ready, and you will have to flag people to get refills. Be extremely clear with your order, especially if you're going to do any substitutions, theres usually always something wrong with it."
Tea D.,"Redwood City, CA",36,16,8,2.0,5/4/2015,Food is exactly like all the other BJ'S out there. This one however has horrible service. Went there for their late night and it took 15mins to just be greeted.
Trusha S.,"Fremont, CA",39,79,15,2.0,6/10/2015,"I have been to BJ's countless times, which is why I am giving this two stars. I really do think in recent time, the whole experience has gone down.  I came here with a couple friends to watch the Warriors NBA Finals game. As expected, the place was crowded. It didn't seem like they had prepared for the rush as when I walked in they told me they only had 4 servers for the entire place. I didn't know how I was to respond to that, so I sat anyways. Between my friends and I we ordered a couple drinks, appetizers, and pizza from the happy hour menu. We got the drinks and appetizers, and 45 minutes after we ordered our pizzas still weren't here. I knew it was crowded, but this was too long so I asked the waitress to check on the food. She comes back 15 minutes later with two pizzas. She hands me mine and said it had been sitting out for awhile, because somebody dropped my friends' pizza on accident without telling anyone. She claimed they had reheated mine and gave it to me and brings out some other pizza for my friend, a different one than the one she ordered which was really odd. My friend sent it back because the pizza she brought out had pork, which she doesn't eat. And my pizza was cold! Even though she said she reheated it. I sent mine back to be heated AGAIN. Finally she comes back with my pizza and the pizza my friend had ordered. But since mine had been reheated so many times, it was soggy! It literally felt like they had just put it in the microwave it was gross.  Finally when the bill came, she charges us the regular price for all the food and drinks instead of the happy hour price! That was really frustrating, and is a huge mistake. When we told her she wasn't very apologetic and just said she would talk to her manager. Especially when going during happy hour, make sure that people double check their bills as the servers don't seem to be doing their job properly. This place is understaffed, and the waiters they do have are incompetent. They really need to get better. I am only giving 2 stars based on my past experiences here over the years where it was MUCH better."
Erik R.,"Newark, CA",121,1,2,4.0,9/19/2015,Kelli was an awesome server! But the manager Evan was was really unprofessional when he yelled at her in public for getting a different drink we ordered. It was a misunderstanding on the order not her fault and he was a big douchbag about it and made it awkward. He need to be more respectful to his employees and the customers seeing that... But food was excellent and our server was great!
John Y.,"San Jose, CA",4,44,1,3.0,8/6/2014,I complained in their website and to my surprise not only did the regional rep contact Me but also the manager of the place.  They both apologized profusely and vowed to correct the injustice I experienced. In addition they gave me a 50 dollar credit towards my next meal. So I give them kudos for the follow up. I hope they corrected their process so that no one ever experiences the horror I experienced.
Chris A.,"Fremont, CA",0,37,,3.0,9/15/2015,Thoroughly enjoy the beer selection there as well as the pizza. The entrees are hit or miss but there is a significant variety of items. The waits are generally not long going at 7P but I have noticed that the cleanliness of the table/menus is lacking. Pizookie is really good if you have room at the end!
Miranda C.,"Hayward, CA",257,1,2,5.0,11/8/2015,"April, our server was great! Best customer service Ive had in awhile. She made sure my drink was always filled. Bubbly personality. Next time I wanr her as my server."
Chantelina J.,"Fremont, CA",139,149,37,5.0,4/6/2015,"I'd say the service in this restaurant has up'd their game! This review is for Kyle, who was the waiter for my husband and I on Saturday night. He was very attentive with our table and was also very personable. He wasn't overbearing like some waiters are in other restaurants. He asked all the right questions and managed to make sure our orders were put in correctly. He definitely made our dinner much more enjoyable knowing that he took care of us. Thank you, Kyle!"
Flo C.,"San Jose, CA",2,7,2,3.0,5/15/2014,Jon-Paul my waiter was very nice. However the quality of food was poor ... An there was a DOG in the restaurant ! I almost wanted to throw up !
Veronica A.,"Union City, CA",278,898,384,5.0,4/2/2012,"In reading the reviews, we came here not expecting very much...and we were pleasantly surprised! Came here for lunch and we got here at around 11:30 which was good because around noon it started to get packed.  Courtney was our waitress and she was great! She was friendly, came to check on us, and brought our food out in a timely manner.  We noticed she didn't write down our orders and she mentioned she's been a waitress for 5 years.  After having a very horrible experience with a waitress at ANOTHER restaurant which I will not mention here, we were so happy that we found a wonderful waitress that took care of us and we were able to enjoy our lunch without stressing out about bad service.   Avocado eggrolls- delicious Chicken wings- very good Pomegrante Margarita-strong and good Parmessan crusted chicken-it was ok Jalapeno burger-very tasty, loved the fried jalapenos We ordered some stuff to go and that took a long time, but it was probably because the placed was packed to the gills. Will def come back."
Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",743,2526,266,2.0,6/3/2012,"I've had mixed experiences with the BJ's service depending on how busy it's been, but our waitress was pretty dismal - she wasn't the slyest about chatting it up with her friends at another table while making us wait for extended periods without food & drink. As for the fare itself, I could take it or leave it.  I wouldn't mind the nachos every once in a while, but the deep dish pizza is really sub-par after seeing what it should actually taste like in Chicago.  The dough is thick and bland, boring my palate within a couple bites.  At least the pizookie is still a decent dessert.  For beers, the Hopstorm IPA had an odd, unpleasant sweetness...so it worked out that our waitress forgot to come back and take my order after trying the skosh XD All in all, it's def worth the further drive down to Yard House if you're in the mood for some happy hour snacks & beer."
