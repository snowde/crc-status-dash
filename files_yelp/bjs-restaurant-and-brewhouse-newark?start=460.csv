Arvindram R.,"Tracy, CA",105,155,1008,3.0,5/10/2014,"Have been at this place  for almost not less than 60 times, used to be an awesome place with great food and Beer, happy hours used to be really Happy with 1/2 price regular sized appetizers. Some corporate changes happened which wanted to profit out of the venture and from then the food quality worsened, prices went up and portion size started diminishing. Come on BJs we used to be friends, let's get back on track with quality and value for customers."
Matt A.,"Rochester, NY",15,8,,1.0,11/29/2014,"Service was slow.   I came here around 2 on a Saturday and sat at a half empty bar.   It took over 10 minutes for the bartender to come over and take my drink order.   He stated the taps obscured his view of me so he didn't know I was there...  Really?     I ordered fried calamari just to have something to chew on during that football games.   While the portion was good size, it was soggy and very greasy.   Disgusting.  If you can't get that right then there is no point in trying anything else. The beer was good though."
David O.,"Oakland, CA",140,16,1,2.0,9/4/2015,"Where do I even begin to tell you how terrible this place was. I guess I'll start with the two positives, it was clean and the server was nice. It all goes downhill from there. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, I'm a huge fan of shrimp scampi at that....worst ever, the shrimp was burned, so was the pasta, sent it back and it came back worse than the first time. I ceased my complaints and just ate it. No seasoning, didn't bring me ground pepper or lemons until I finally asked for a to go box because I couldn't do it anymore. The place wasn't even busy and they brought me my check in record speed. Would never EVER come back for anything but some happy hour booze. My advice, STAY AWAY from anything that requires the cooks to COOK"
Rusty C.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,32,,4.0,10/1/2015,I ate here quite a bit while in Newark on business. I mostly sat at the bar. The atmosphere is an upscale sports bar. They have very good happy hour specials for food and beer. The beer options are fantastic. They have a bunch of TVs and are always playing a game on them. My type of place.  The service was okay but not great.
Tony L.,"Fremont, CA",429,35,,3.0,3/12/2015,This place was packed when the family decided to try it out. The parking was problematic and the wait time was long but everyone seemed to have a good time and the food was decent. Nothing special.
Judy W.,"Oakland, CA",412,343,133,3.0,5/11/2012,"it's a decent chain, nice choices on tap. Prices is similar to Cheesecake Factory. Their deep dish pizzas are pretty delish!! I probably wouldn't come here, unless it's for someones bday.. lol. It's not really a place where they have food that I crave.  Pizookie is amazing thought! you guys definitely need to try it out!!! If you havent been there yet, grab some buddies, order a pitcher of beer, get the largest deep dish pizza and finish your meal off with a cookie with ice cream on time. YUMMMMMMMS"
Lyn W.,"Fremont, CA",0,25,99,2.0,9/22/2015,"My friends and I come here often for happy hour. My hubby and I tried for a late dinner to see if our experience for dining in would be different. First of all their hostess (one female and a male that night) are rude. No smile no greetings just out right ""for how many"" is how they started. The hostess told us that the wait is about 10-15 minutes, so we figured... Oh ok the wait isn't that bad. Wrong! 35 minutes later our name wasn't called yet, so I ask the hostess about what happened to the 10-15 minutes wait? She said well there's a lot of people and you probably have to wait another 10-15 minutes more.  The sad things is I keep seeing they're giving other people with a party of 3 and more a buzzer to let them know their table is ready but they didn't give us a buzzer. The couple who was in line before me had already been seated long time ago and other people with buzzers already been seated and we are still waiting.  45 minutes later and we are so hungry, our names had not been called yet. We decided to wait an available seat at the bar and when my hubby finally got one, we decided to just eat there. So after an hour we finally got seated at the bar and got our order taken immediately. I have BJ's two starts for the waitress who served us with a smile and for the waiter who cleaned out the table so we can seat and eat.  All in all the hostess needs to do more training about customer service. Other than that food is good. Won't be dining again at the Dining hall but would eat at the bar only."
Christian Y.,"Fremont, CA",2,2,,1.0,9/20/2015,Horrible service.  Waited one hour for dessert while the table next to us for it before us although we ordered first.  Long wait for entrees and pizzas burnt and cold.  Food is really small in portions and tastes bad.
Tiffani H.,"Mountain View, CA",2,1,,1.0,12/29/2014,"Turn around don't do it. This was the worst dining experience I've ever had. Horrible service and apparently normal car break ins in their lot.  Every year we have friends fly in from Southern California. We decided to try something new and go to Bj's. Never again.  Here's a summary:  **The manager very casually comes to our table and asks if anyone drives a VW... And then says ""oh ok because it just was broken in to"" and walks away. We found out from the bus boy that car theft  and break ins happen 2-3 times a day In their lot. Hello jerk...WARN YOUR PATRONS!!!!!  It took 15-20 for anyone to come to our table. (The place was not at all packed)  Only half of our 25 person party was brought waters/offered appetizers Our waitress kept forgetting our orders(write it down dummy)  The guy bringing out the food was rude and kept yelling at us, throwing our plates on the table: his shirt was dirty and untucked , he was not happy to have to be at work. Very unprofessional.  The orders kept coming out wrong.  We weren't brought napkins until the end after several requests.  Water refills never offered.  Very rude response to the car being broken in to.  Absolutely the lowest level of customer service I've ever had and on top of that....THE FOOD SUCKED. don't do it people. This location should just be torn down."
Valerie H.,"Fremont, CA",19,12,2,5.0,7/24/2014,Great food.  Parking lot security  person is inside talking to the girls at the desk. Car break-ins are frequent here.  Do not leave valuables in car!!!!!!
Lina H.,"Newark, CA",681,633,691,2.0,1/2/2014,"Very, very disappointed.  I was looking for a spot to catch the Sharks game and I figured BJs would have it.  I found parking relatively close to the entrance, and walked right in.  When I got close to the bar I was shocked to see they were not showing the Sharks game!!! At least not in the 4 TVs right in front of the bar.  :(  When I asked the bartender about the Sharks game he pointed towards the TV on the side of the restaurant, nowhere close to the bar.  So basically if I wanted to watch the game I was going to have to get a booth or table in the dining area.  I was definitely not hungry nor did I want to wait an hour to get seated!!! So, I simply walked out and drove myself to Jacks Brewing where they had two TVs right at the bar showing my precious black and teal Sharks.  ;)"
Amanda H.,"Aurora, CO",10,42,15,3.0,3/11/2014,"We called ahead and there was a 45 minute wait, when we arrived about 30 minutes later we were seated immediately. It did take a little while for our server to free us but once she did she was amazing and attentive. Unfortunately the chef of the night wasn't up to par. We ordered the cheese sticks and calamari as appetizers. A individual sweet pig pizza, a burger, chicken salad and a pasta. My fiancé ordered his burger medium rare and received a medium well. My pizza was extremely limp and didn't have any pizza sauce! I think the recipe for the thin crust is not a good one as it was extremely soggy. Typically I get the deep dish which is so good. Anyways, the server had my pizza remade which took about 10 minutes. The second go around it had sauce but again soggy.  The manager came by and comped my pizza. Which is much appreciated. Only complaint about the server is the fact that she did not let me know root beer was not free refills and they were 3 bucks a pop! However, one of my rootbeers was also comped so I ended up paying just for 1. We still left the server a 20% tip as the meal was not her fault. Having been a server before I really appreciate the fact she got a manager involved. So many times I've gotten the wrong meal or soggy or something and servers just don't care and don't offer anything. At that point I say sorry server no tip for you!"
Meghian G.,"Livermore, CA",34,3,,1.0,1/17/2015,"We went to BJs for brunch, we waited 5 minutes and no one came to seat us. The restaurant was not busy at all. We wanted to try the brunch cuz we seen it last time we had dinner but no one is available to help you. I wouldn't recommend them for brunch."
Lorna P.,"Fremont, CA",55,17,10,3.0,8/4/2015,"Great selection of beers. Love that they have my favorite Belgium Lambic beer on tap! Food was average. Chicken lettuce wraps and tomato mozzarella sale were my favorites. But definitely have a wide selection of menu items. Got a decent deal for happy hour. Super busy, so bartenders had somewhat of a hard time keeping up, but were pretty cool. I'd probably go back if someone else were picking the restaurant."
Mike W.,"Fremont, CA",97,3,,1.0,2/14/2015,I called in yesterday and asked if I could get a copy of a receipt for a meal I had eaten here the day before so I could get reimbursed by my company. I was told that if I came in and spoke to the manager I could get the receipt. I went out of my way to drive all the way over there and when I arrived the manager informed me that he did not have the time to get me the receipt. I completely understand that this was my mistake but I should have been informed that it was not possible. This was a waste of my time and BJ's lost a customer because of it. Learn how to put the customer first!
Diana H.,"Davis, CA",178,41,280,5.0,6/1/2014,Late night service was great. The house was packed but the wait was reasonable. No complaints. Calamari appetizer was a own and the strawberry splash is a definite favorite. Bathrooms were clean which is always a plus.
Hahn N.,"San Ramon, CA",2,43,6,2.0,4/19/2016,"Definitely not my best visit unfortunately. I decided to take my kids to lunch before some fun activity and arrived around 2:30.  The hostess took us to our table and after that we didn't see a waiter for ten minutes to take our order for drinks or food. Our waitress eventually showed up and attempted to take our order but she failed to listen to us as we had to repeat ourselves 3 times. She left and we doubted we were going to have the right drinks but she got it after all. She took our food order and had really bad attitude as if we were an inconvenience to her and what she was doing. The food came and my sandwich was super dry. The toast was burnt and the chicken was dry. I ordered the wedge salad which resulted in a bath of dressing which ultimately ruined the meal in the long end. I've had this same meal now twice and for going on a busy Saturday dinner with a great experience to this on a dead Friday lunch time, pretty upsetting. Our waitress checked on us about 10 minutes after someone else brought out our food. Again the tude... Then she went over to the wrap around booth next to us full of young guys with the most energetic greeting and made flirtatious talk. We later learned it was another employee and his buddies. Another waitress joined her as they all talked. She then came back with her tude to see if we needed anything else. We ordered two pazookies and she looked at us like we were crazy to want to order them. She dropped off our tab and went to her buddies at the booth for more flirting.  Our pazookies arrived, we ate them and I left the worse tip I've ever left anyone. Feeling guilty but the service wasn't even tipable. Sorry Rosario but you really shouldn't be a server if you can't treat all your guests equally and lose the tude."
Manushi P.,"Union City, CA",0,20,5,3.0,8/22/2014,"We have been to this place couple of time. We loved their pita wrap , pizza.  Stuffed mushroom is delicious."
Gina R.,"Glenmoor, CA",29,30,7,3.0,10/17/2015,I give it a 3 star customer service was excellent can't complain on that. There was only 2 min wait to be seated. They got our food pretty quickly. My only complaint is the food sucks!!!i ordered a chicken Alfredo fettuccine and it wasn't good it seemed like they pored sauce from store those cheap ones. The bread sticks were over toasted too hard to give it a bite. Before maybe two years ago it was so much better! But now maybe it's the cook I don't know but I sure as hell didn't like my plate I will not be coming here anymore Olive Garden is soo much better! The pazooki here is hella good!
Chris H.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/30/2016,"terrible service. called ahead and made a reservation, which was lost. waited an awfully long time for a table, especially for having called ahead. servers took 15 minutes to come take our drink order, and he only has two tables. appetizers came out incorrectly, drinks were changed without warning, and the meat is chewy. any one of these would be tolerable, but all snowballing together? come on. very disappointed.  also, don't change every single tv to one single game when there are multiple, local teams in playoffs.  easily fixable things, remedied by a staff who is present and cares about customer service."
