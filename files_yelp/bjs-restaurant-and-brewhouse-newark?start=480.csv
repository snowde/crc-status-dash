Michelle A.,"Hayward, CA",45,79,20,5.0,5/21/2015,I have been here countless times but tonight can't beat the amazing service I received from darren not only did he make fantastic recommendations but he was just an all around pleasant person to be around. He helped get the night started with his positive attitude and round of drinks that he kept up with follow ups which is hard to come by. Big tip and a hi - five bjs!
Sharon B.,"Newark, CA",34,10,5,4.0,9/14/2014,"Worst Service ever; But, to their credit, they never gave up! We had party of 16 reservations for 6 pm a week in advance.  Checked in 6:03. Were told it might be a min. We checked in again at 6:20 & had to wait 10 more min. It was obvious they had lost our reservation especially after we were finally brought to our seating. We were cramped & overcrowded, against a wall.  we're a big family,  so we're used to it.  They brought complimentary cheese sticks to apologize within 5 minutes of seating us,  but didn't take our drink order for another 10 min. They forgot 4 out of 6 requests for water.   Then 10 more min to order.  By then we were getting very hungry had been there almost an hour, so we ordered 3 more apps & all our entrees.  They brought the apps but no plates, we had to ask 2 times.  I sent a drink back because I didn't like it. I had ordered it, but it was very sweet.  The server brought me something else right away.  Our food came at 7:30,  most of it anyway. They had forgotten to order 4 entrees,  & had made 1 entree twice. They took that back.   I later found out that my grandaughter had ordered one kind of soup but had been given another. (It was her birthday.) I asked why she didn't tell us. She said she was just too hungry to send it back.  I asked if she liked it, she said it was not her favorite but she didn't care.     About now you must think we're a bunch of complainers and eventually we did all get fed. It just took so long lots mistakes.  I had the salmon it was sooooo good. The manager was very kind,  he came over personally & apologized directly to me, then comped my salmon dinner.  After all the mishaps I certainly appreciated that gesture.  We left about 8:40. I've heard in Europe things are done at a very leisurely pace,  perhaps we melded into a worm hole for the evening. We were hungry and cranky, but rolled w the flow as best we could; we did not get great service; but,  they never gave up on us, were never rude, and the food was quite good.   If you're wondering,  we tipped 20% we're not jerks!"
Mechelle A.,"Hayward, CA",129,97,306,5.0,4/4/2014,I went there last night and John Paul was my waiter ... He was off the hook ... i own a restaurant and I know how important it is about service to every one ... from the minute he walked to the table and til the minute we left he was outstanding... him being so great and on point made everything taste better
Jerry R.,"Fremont, CA",1,1,1,2.0,9/11/2014,Came in about 11ish for a late dinner. Sat in the bar area. Took about 20 minutes til our server came. It seems like he was more concerned about taking to a girl at the bar then attending his tables. We ordered a pizza and appitizer. Thinking that our appitizer would come out before our pizza it ended up coming out at the same time. A little disappointed to be waiting so long for. The appitizer ends being served to us cold. SMH.   On another note thanks to the supervisor to assisiting us in our problem.
Radio G.,"Livermore, CA",1,11,1,2.0,3/2/2015,Slow. Like. Reading. This. Sentence. Service. Do. Not. Go. There. Hungry. o. M. G. Where is the food. This is the second time it has taken more than 45 minutes for a simple pasta dish. I won't be back.
Tine G.,"Union City, CA",4,4,,1.0,1/21/2015,"Nayeli was our server tonight. She completely forgot that we had mentioned that we came to BJ's to celebrate my mom's birthday. Instead, when we ordered a pizookie after dinner, we thought she was bringing the one with the candle to us and got excited. Nope. She brought it to the table next to us. All night we saw people celebrating birthdays but our idiot server completely forgot about my mom. No one disrespects my mom like that. Never celebrating anything here again, thanks to NAYELI."
Ryan A.,"Hayward, CA",154,380,169,5.0,1/8/2014,"BJ's is the new age family restaurant.  The trend setter.  That used to be Chilis.  Applebee's, Fridays, used to copy Chilis.  Now all 3 copy BJ's.  BJ's menu is huge, their food is hot, fresh, & tasty.  I come to this location for lunch often.  Good service, good food."
Suzi L.,"Hayward, CA",3,11,49,5.0,3/27/2014,This place is really good for party's. The food is great and the servers are very efficient. Jk. Sometimes they suck but I really enjoy drinking and eating so yea I give it 2 thumbs up!!
Garrett C.,"Fremont, CA",262,4,,1.0,9/20/2015,"I used to enjoy this place but after today the service is just horrible. The food is okay but the portions seem to have been reduced. After our main meals, the desserts took almost 20 minutes to arrive. The server spoke very quietly and I almost thought they couldn't speak English. Probably won't come back again."
Andrea F.,"Fremont, CA",15,20,7,1.0,7/22/2015,"Never made it in the door!  We have been to BJ's before and while I don't think I would give it a 5 star rating, it was acceptable. We tried to go there for dinner last night. There is a lot of new construction that has caused most of their parking lost to be torn out. We drove around the entire lot several times, which is now about 1/2 the size it used to be. There was no parking. Pretty frustrating especially looking at the size of the construction project and the fact that it looks like it will be this way for a long time."
Jay G.,"East Bay, CA",453,534,489,3.0,12/7/2013,"A friend wanted BJ's... To celebrate his graduation from college and hangout before moving back to SoCal. So, we ended up at the Newark location to do just that! Accompanied by my friend and bro in law, we came on a busy Friday night. Even the bar area was packed. No matter what way we went (waiting for a table at the bar or main dining area) we were going to have to wait. Luckily, for us we found a party at the bar that was just leaving after our 10 minute arrival.  Our ordering was very simple. We just had to order what was necessary for  celebrating a congratulations/going away occasion: - Buffalo wings with buffalo sauce on the side - Artichoke dip - Blue Moon beers - Hennessy shots  The buffalo wings were crispy, yet tender. To control the heat of the buffalo sauce, we had it on the side because not everyone could handle the heat. The artichoke dip was nice and creamy. It was served warm and made our tortilla chips taste great. I didn't drink beer since I can't have any, but I did have my fair share of Hennessy shots.  This place is good for sporting events, but since BJ's is a popular place in the area be prepared to wait."
Miss H K.,"San Francisco, CA",446,959,1946,4.0,9/9/2011,"Came here tonight for dinner with friends and was more satisfied than I thought I'd be! I called in 30 min in advance to put our name on the wait list, when we got there it was packed, however we only had to wait about 10 extra mins to be seated-seems the wait was due to short staff vs open tables. I ordered the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tasty and was served over fettucini noodles with green beans. My dish was good, I liked the noodles with it. Also tried the red velvet pizookie for dessert which was also sweet. Service was fine and the prices here are affordable for family dining. I'd definitely recommend calling in advance for a table but wouldn't mind returning here in the future. Good for groups."
Andy B.,"San Ramon, CA",5,100,291,3.0,5/8/2014,"Not really wanting to come back to BJ's after eating their pasta. VERY oily and unappetizing since the pasta and sauce had a congealed texture and taste to it. As for the appetizers, they were okay. Not very memorable. The day I went was for my cousin's birthday dinner. We also had dessert there, and I didn't feel satisfied from the portions I had there. I wouldn't come back, especially when the service was just okay. Oh yeah, and when I thought I had left my iPad in the restaurant and called the restaurant to see if they found it, the employee who answered the phone wasn't even apologetic about my concern when I explained the situation. Thankfully, my iPad was found under my car seat, so I was so relieved when I saw it there. We had a BJ's back in my hometown, and I'm glad I never went there."
Bernadette M.,"Hayward, CA",610,652,1036,5.0,10/21/2013,"This place is always packed! Thank goodness Mervyn's closed because there wouldn't be any parking. I felt like I parked out in the boonies and had to go over the river and thru the woods to get to the restaurant. Sheesh! It was just a girls night and we were quoted a 30-minute wait but I opted to sit in the bar area and stood there like a hungry hawk waiting for a table to open up.  Other folks were doing the same thing and the servers will have a stern ""excuse me"" if you're in their way while carrying drinks and food to their tables. Understandable. Thankfully two seats opened up at the bar and you can't go wrong getting service by the bartenders and having four different games to watch up on their large screen.  We had some drinks, a standard vodka tonic cocktail for me, and beer for my gf. We decided on the artichoke dip as an app, she went with the balsamic chicken with potatoes and I wanted to venture out from my usual avocado rolls and called on Yelp for recommendations. The white pizza was the first to get a recommendation so I went with that.  It was good and the mini size was perfect for me. Matter of fact, I took half of it home for lunch the next day. I prefer the Buffalo Chicken Pizza over that one. And the Balsamic Chicken was tasty. My gf finished her dish without a problem. The dip app was small. Not enough dip for the amount of chips that they give you and for $8. The other patrons were very friendly. Nice conversation and even free beignet dessert for moving over one seat to make room for a gent's guest.  AND a recommended beer float was given to my girlfriend as well. Score! Service was friendly and helpful."
Shital B.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2016,We were group of 11 people 4 people ordered chicken dish which very salty. The service really sucks. Never coming back here.
Kellie N.,"Atlanta, GA",242,391,473,4.0,12/18/2011,"I love that they have a light bites section and an appetizer section. I sat at the bar and had a couple items off the lite bites menu. Seared ahi and tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were amazing. I'm not a beer drinker, however, the most amazing bartender, Melissa let me try one of their light beer's liked it...maybe when it is warm outside I will have one. Great staff, friendly and fast service. I also loved that in the middle of the afternoon, the ""regulars"" come in and were greeted by name by the bartenders. The menu is so huge and they tell you the calories in each item."
Alejandra J.,"Hayward, CA",7,37,5,4.0,5/17/2015,"Drinks are delicious, and all the bartenders I've met are really nice with great service !"
Lexie P.,"Fremont, CA",582,39,4,4.0,5/15/2015,"My overall FAVORITE restaurant in Fremont. I've come here countless times and for the most part, I've always received great customer service with great quality food. I usually order the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. I sometimes get the caesar salad, clam chowder, or five meet deep dish pizza. I almost ALWAYS get a pizookie. I'm extremely sad that they don't have red velvet anymore but I have enjoyed the peanut butter s'mores pizookie and I always love the traditional chocolate chip. They've raised their prices a little bit within the last 5-6 years but I'm still a fan, especially since they have their rewards system. I usually rack up enough points for a reward/coupon within 2-3 visits. I also get weekly emails with their specials and coupons, which usually gets me to come in."
Rebecca P.,"Milpitas, CA",178,104,88,1.0,12/20/2013,"If I can give zero stars, I would.  We got here at 7. They told us 45 minutes. It's now 9 pm and they keep giving us the run around. Every time we check how long, they tell us another 15 minutes. At 845, we ask how long the wait is. And they said 15 minutes. 45 minutes has passed.. They said another 30 minutes.  On top of that, my friend ordered calamari and hour ago and still hasn't gotten it. They brought the check over. Calamari was on it but we never received it.  Bad service? Yes! We have been waiting over 2 hours and other people have been getting seated before us. We only have a 10 people party.  This is really bullshit. I can't say how the food is because we still haven't gotten seated!"
Scott S.,"Elk Grove, CA",147,197,215,1.0,6/19/2013,"Normally it pains me to write a one star review, but not today.   We came here for a family gathering.   We arrived about 1150 am and were told it would be about a 25-30 minute wait.  We were very patient and continued to wait for about 45 minutes.   We were finally seated and given our menus.  Our waiter was friendly enough, but a bit slow.  It took a few minutes to get our drinks and even longer to get our apps. We received our main courses.  My fiancee had ordered a sandwich and asked for no bacob.  It ended up coming with extra bacon and when we pointed this out the waiter simply took the order back and removed the bacon.  We demanded that a new sandwich be made and had it about 10 minutes later. They ended up comping a desert and actually screwed that up as well. Too bad because I normally like the beer here."
