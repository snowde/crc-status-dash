Samantha R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,34,,1.0,1/13/2014,Crappy customer service.  Was waiting to be seated and the hostess forgot about us and seated someone else. LOLOL maybe the place needs lighting or she needs glasses?? Yup not coming back. Also it takes years to get your food.....
Dinesh C.,"Fremont, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/30/2014,"After a long wait we got seated and ordered our appetizers, drinks and kids food which was served promptly.  We then ordered our entree - pizza, which took over an hour.  The manager realized this before we could bring it up and apologized and said he would comp us for that.  At this time we were glad they realized their mistake and that they took to steps to correct and act upon it.  We ordered dessert for the kids who were getting restless by now.  This took over an hour and our server was nowhere to be seen.  We asked another server to call the manager and then our desserts show up.  We asked our server to call the manager and she said she would but never did.  We had asked for a glass of water and that too took over half an hour.   I'm glad they comp'ed us for the pizza - but spending two and half hours for a dinner with hunbgry kids totally ruined the night.  I would never go again."
Maria C.,"Fremont, CA",0,59,,2.0,9/25/2014,"BJs. Where to begin? Well, first there's the name. We'll leave that for a site that won't chuck this review based on it's user policy :) We've been in and out of this BJs for over a year, and while I fell in love with this chain in Boulder, CO, it's not the best here. Why, you ask? Noise ------- the noise level in here is off the chain ridiculous. We've canned it from our moms-night-out list of places to go because even yelling, we often can't hear each other. And I don't want to yell at people I like. I'd like to yell at the wait service, though. Wait Service -------------- Listen. I get it. You're underpaid, supposed to make your cash on tips, have too many tables, and I'm sure some of us customers aren't as nice as the others. But seriously, don't help make the situation worse, cuz, as they say, it's the little things. Like when you bring a tray of 4 drinks to the table but 3 straws. And then say you're sorry, you'll be right back with one. But never come back. Or, when you come to the table with hot soup, but there's no spoon. And say you'll be right back with one. But then proceed to take the order of the table RIGHT BEHIND US. You realize we can hear you, right? We can see you, right? That's just a slap in the face, in my opinion. It's like saying, ""You know, Mr Customer, I know you can't order your own soup and get it from the kitchen. So I'm going to let that HOT dish sit in front of you and grow colder by the minute, until I damn well feel like getting a spoon for you."" YOU set the expectation - YOU said you'd go get it... and yet you don't. For 9.8 minutes, on average, over 4 visits. Yes, it got so bad that we'd TIME YOU over MANY visits and chuckle as the $20 bills passed hands, bets collected and cashed in, winners and losers announced, as we gambled on how long you'd be gone. You want a tip? Give me service. You want a good tip Give me good service. You want a great tip? Well, you get the idea. The Food ----------- As a first time reviewer of you, but long time eater in your chain, I understand that I'm emotionally scarred from your chain's decision to pull the stuffed baked potatoes. I admit, I was a bit miffed when I was told that, after WANTING to pay for a $10 potato (come on, let's just say it, we all know it's really worth $1.50 in costs), that you're complaining to me about the time it takes the kitchen to prepare it. Which tells me the kitchen isn't looking to cook, they're looking to reheat. Which brings me to the last point - the food quality is OK, for what it is - but it could be so much better, particularly when the menu is priced squarely in the average range of $14/item, $20-$22/meal. And when we leave? Yup, you guessed it. My man wants to visit McDonalds, because he's still hungry. Quality -------- I want to end on this final note. You are what you serve, in the restaurant business; a lot of times we'll put up with crappy wait service, or rude wait service, or NO wait service, if there's good food and drink. However, you sold me a roughly $4 cream soda with no carbonation. After asking for something with bubbles, and being looked at with incredulity (because, you know, customers take a perfectly fine glass, drink none of it, and send it back for fun, and you, you decide you're the soda police and want to question my word, despite seeing not a single bubble on the side of the glass), take 15 minutes to work it out with the bar, who tells you there's something wrong with the batch, and there are no more batches. OK, I'm disappointed, but things happen, I get it, let's move on. Imagine my surprise when I saw more trays of bad-batch soda being served to other customers. It's a small thing, I know, but for a chain making it's name on the every-so-hot marketing monikers of ""Hand-crafted"" sodas, it tells me that you knew there was a problem (despite how we got to that discovery), and continued to serve it anyways. Which makes me wonder about what's on my plate. EEKS."
Jelani W.,"Hayward, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/18/2014,This is the worst place to eat my food had a toe nail and a spider in it then I tried to get something else and they told me to get out and me and my grandma left then she fell off the curb because her starvation
Jackie H.,"Milpitas, CA",276,232,57,4.0,9/23/2013,"1. Food: A lot like the Yard House, but it tastes better.  2. Great Pizookie selection 3. Parking is a little strange in this place. It is a maze! I see it as a challenge, however I can see it as a challenge for inebriated people.  4. Oreo pizookie. 'Nuff said. It's a great chain. You get the same food at every location (which is good because their margherita flat bread is awesome). The service is a hit or miss, but the turn-over is so high (like every restaurant) that I can't really attribute service to food quality.  I'd come back :)"
Megha R.,"San Jose, CA",1,17,,4.0,7/25/2015,"The ambience, service and food was absolutely amazing! I tried a quinoa for the first time and loved it. It was a herb roasted chicken on quinoa. I found the chicken a little overcooked because it was chewy but the flavors that it was cooked in were amazing. I wish it was a little less tangy though. I saw a few fried calamari and some avocado egg rolls being ordered on my table and everybody loved them. The Cajun pasta with chicken was nice and creamy too. If you get a chance to be there and love chocolate do try out the triple chocolate Ghirardelli brownie and icecream. Thumbs up on the food and service!"
Kevin S.,"San Leandro, CA",0,17,4,1.0,5/29/2015,Here I am waiting in bj's waiting to 've seated for the past hour and 45 minutes. After being told it would be a 1 hour wait. Children are hungry. I've worked a long day. Still no help from the staff.  If I could give this place 0 stars I would.
Delency P.,"Newark, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/22/2015,Ive experienced better service at marine world on a hot summer day in the funnel cake line. My cousin couldn't leave the restaurant without taking a shit.
Ruben O.,"Newark, CA",38,23,3,4.0,7/20/2015,"This was a mixed bag of good and okay. Let me start of with saying the wait was a bit long all around [getting seated, drinks, food, etc....] The food was okay but nothing special, Calamari was cooked well and seasoned nicely but kind of a small portion and forgettable flavor. Avacado egg rolls were.... Different,  but not in a bad way. Drinks were either too strong or too sweet, Pizza was mostly dough and although the dough was good the toppings and sauce just didn't have enough flavor for my liking. Now for the saving grace though, that damn Pazookie. It's worth the price of admission alone, warm soft cookie with some type of dessert sauce and a big scoop of ice cream. #FoodOfGods"
Steph C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",300,395,68,4.0,11/20/2013,"Not as bad as people claim it to be. The bar is the best place to sit if you're looking to get the latest and greatest in sports for the day. There are TV's everywhere! The beer selection is great and the service is fast and friendly. Although I like fast service, I always assume the food quality will be sub par. Not here! I ordered the appetizer sliders for my entree during dinner and it filled me up good. Pizooki? I'll pass. I can make a better cookie at home. If you're looking to bring your kids with you on a Thur/Fri/Sat, I'd recommend to think twice. It's loud, people are slinging back beers and it has dim lighting. Bypassing the cookie dessert, it's no wonder this place is always packed and has a line out the door."
Lorelei B.,"Hayward, CA",12,19,37,3.0,6/17/2014,"I ordered my food online to dine-in since i only have one hour of lunch because i thought it would be faster that way. So they worked on my order and i waited for awhile just to get my drink. Finally my order came, but they did not customize my food like i asked. I asked for extra mushrooms and they did not put any. So i left it as is.  I asked to get a refill and it took a good 10 minutes just to get it. Then I asked for dessert and it took another 15 minutes to wait... I was already 15 minutes late to get back to work when i got my dessert.  Waitress didn't smile that much. She was just ok. Overall, the only thing that was great was their food. Customer Service however was pretty slow."
Pearl V.,"San Jose, CA",1246,993,3794,4.0,6/11/2011,"YES on the strawberry mojitos! and DOUBLE YES on the ahi poke. They are always a MUST order when my GFs and I get together! The mojitos are dangerous... so delicious yet not lightly poured, because they sure can creep up on you if you have more than one. And the poke. If you love sashimi or are a poke lover like me... take my advice and order TWO for the table. You'll be glad you did!"
Janice M.,"Alameda, CA",663,130,304,4.0,5/20/2013,"I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants and when I mean chain restaurant, I'm taking about Applebee's , TGI Fridays, Chili's, El Torito.. Etc. Countless of times I have driven pass this BJ'S restaurant thinking"" Ehhhhhh... It's just another one of those chain restaurants, ill pass"" but when I decided to try it this week , I was kinda impressed. I've never stepped into this place since they open and just now I decided to give it a try. Service:I heard it can be a hit or miss. My sis in law and I came in here around 5pm and Happy Hour is here is between 3pm-7pm and it wasn't that busy. I heard they get pretty packed here. (45+min waits) Our waiter was A guy named Ed and he was pretty nice and informative when it came to a lot of things in the menu. Very talkative and funny guy. Made sure our waters were filled and got us anything we needed. Food: I actually wanted to try a lot of things on the menu. What caught my eye was the Ahi Poke appetizer. It was that or the calamari but I also wanted to try the calamari so I got that instead. The ahi poke will be the reason I come back for a second visit. My sis in law kept talking about now delish their pizzas are so she ended up getting that to share with my boy. Before ordering my meal, we got munch on the calamari and I thought it was really good. Not too crunchy but not to soggy either. I decided to get a regular veggie burger. First bite... I was satisfied. Only pet peeve I have is when restaurants serve you burgers and all the insides (produce) are served on the side. Next time I think I'll mention for them to put together for me. The fries were great!! I love how they were thin. Very flavorful! IDecided to take a bite of the pizza crust from my sis in laws order and oh wow! Delicioso!!!! Last but not least... PAZOOKI time. I was so happy to hear they had an option for a smaller size pazooki. We were all pretty much stuffed. The ice cream served on top of that warm cookie made it a delightful treat! I can't wait till I get the chance to come back here and dine. I've raved to a couple of people about BJs and they have all given me ideas on different things to try."
Jennifer S.,"Mountain View, CA",46,98,225,3.0,2/19/2012,"If this weren't one of the few places open in Fremont after 10 PM, I would never come here. In fact, the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the lack of competition BJ's has for late-night grub. The wait for your food is always a minimum of 30 minutes, no matter how busy the restaurant is. The food tastes fine, but is also quite overpriced for what you're getting, and you're really paying for the nice ambiance and the TVs. (The service is lackluster, so you're certainly not paying for that!) I have never had beer or pizookies there, so I might just be missing out, but as it stands, I only go to BJ's under peer pressure and never on my own volition."
Tim M.,"Hendersonville, NC",13,63,68,4.0,2/17/2014,"The burger I ordered and had delivered was fantastic!  It was cooked precisely as ordered and was delivered hot and tasty.  This was definitely the best burger I've had in the Newark area.  I opted for the thin fries instead of crinkled.  They were hot, but like fries delivered from anywhere else, they weren't as good as fresh out of the oil.  I will certainly be ordering from BJ's again"
frank c.,"Fremont, CA",2,8,,1.0,8/3/2013,"This review is for our dining experience on 8/2/13: This has to be one of the most painfully slooooooow dining experience I've ever sat through!   For example, we ordered the appetizer nachos and asked for the salsa on the side. Kudos to them for getting the nachos out in good time, but we didn't get the salsa until we were half way through with our nachos!   Also, the wife's strawberry lemonade refill took over 10 minutes and 2 servers to get!  It felt like the server was no where to be seen, either that or he was trying to avoid us! We've been visiting BJ's ever since they opened a few years ago, but the service has gone downhill ever since.  I don't think I'll ever suggest BJ's again..."
Rami A.,"Redwood City, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/8/2016,"Wife ordered her burger well done, and it came out medium. Ordered a great white pizza and it came out completely cold. Sent it back for another one, and the new pizza had no sauce and no mushrooms. Gave up at that point and just ate it. Very disappointing."
Wintha K.,"Fremont, CA",8,20,1,1.0,9/27/2014,"I tried to give this place another chance but their service is appalling. Earlier this month I came here and it took 45 mins after ordering to receive our order of two salads and one small pizza. They also then forgot we placed the order for a pizookie so that took an additional 25-30 mins. We asked to speak to a manager and he came over 20 mins later, and said he was completely unaware of the situation.  Gave it another chance tonight and all we ordered was the pizookie trio. 20 mins after ordering they let us know they were out of the peanut butter pizookie. How did they not figure that out earlier when we ordered? This extended our wait for just a pizookie to 30 mins after ordering and counting...still haven't received it yet. Pretty unacceptable."
Louisa T.,"Fremont, CA",182,700,269,4.0,9/30/2013,"Thank youuuuu google! When we looked up BJ's on googlemaps, a coupon popped up for BJ's, $20 for 2 soup or salads, 1 medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Can't get better than that. Amazing deal if you ask me. My husband and I ended up going with 2 other friends and we both got a chance to use the deals, thanks to our waiter checking with his boss to make sure we could. As a group we shared a pitcher of heff and original wings to start off, and I thought the wings were delicious. I would definitely come back for those wings and the pizza.  The salad was limited to ceasar or house, which I was ok with. My husband ordered the chilli soup which I think he enjoyed, and we shared a medium spicy meatball pizza, and it was spicy alright. It was definitely the jalapeno type of spicy where it burns your mouth a bit. Delicious flavor however, and I like that the crust and presentation on the serving plates was like a deep dish pizza. This is a crust you can eat on it own. (medium pizza for 2 and we had left overs to take home) I haven't been here in a long time, but I do remember their scampi pasta being super delicious as well. I'll have to go back and verify that. The oh so famous pizookie... warm cookie topped with ice cream was delicious as usual, but a tad too sweet for my taste now. I think I'm getting old. But my friend ordered the red velvet (I didn't even know they had different flavors now!) and I ordered the cookies n' cream one. The cookies and cream was on a delicious (but overly sweet chocolate cookie which I normall love if it's not too sweet) topped with vanilla ice cream and cookies n' cream whip. The red velvet seemed less sweet, and tasted ok.  As for the seating, when you walk in, everything to the right where the bar was is free for all, first come first serve. We went there because we really wanted to watch our football games (both Stanford and Cal had games going on, half an hour apart) and thanks to Bj's big tv splitting 4 ways, my husband and I were quite content that we were able to watch our games while enjoying our meal (we called in advance to make sure they were going to play it before arriving).  The menu here is great with a wide selection of foods (and beer- their samplers are fun) you may enjoy, and I have to admit our server this Saturday by the bar section was terrific! Great service. It was definitely more enjoyable that I thought it would be."
Robert P.,"Union City, CA",3,34,3,5.0,6/3/2015,"Our server, Rhianna, was amazing. My mother ordered something that wasn't on the menu and she quickly checked with the kitchen to see if it could be made. We were never waiting for drink refills, and her cheerful attitude dramatically enhanced the meal."
