Ruby K.,"Lancaster, CA",0,17,9,1.0,6/30/2015,"The food was bland, the service was awful and it was an overall horrible experience. This particular location is the worst BJ's location. Our server was Courtney and she had a really bad attitude and only came to our table once ( we weren't even able to get refills)"
Frank P.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/31/2013,"Worst service I have ever had. Went twice. The first time we were told it would be five minutes and we kept waiting and others with the same number of people were seated before us even though they had arrive after. After 25 min, we left went somewhere else. Second time with a different friend. We were seated right away. Order a pizza and waited.  Two hours later we received a raw pizza where the only thing melted was the top layer of cheese.  Wish I would have taken a pic to post. We asked for the manager and she didnt bother to take anything out out of the bill. The only thing she offer was to box it so that we can bake it at home."
Delilah B.,"San Francisco, CA",96,319,37,3.0,6/1/2011,"Huge assortment of beers.  +1 Lime in the Coconut.  +2 Avocado rolls. +2 Looooong wait, no reservations. -1 Consistency. -1 I went here twice in 1 week.  Actually, twice in 1 weekend.  Not for the ambiance, the long wait, the tiny TV's but for 2 things.  The Avocado rolls and their Lime in the Coconut drink. Although the Avocado rolls were consistently and absolutely delicious and addicting, the Lime in the Coconut drink was better the first time.  They had absolutely different flavors each time.  :/  Too bad.  Consistency is key."
Kavita B.,"Fremont, CA",16,54,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Save your money and run! When this place first opened, excellent service and the food was delicious. As time went on, this place has lost all its charm. The service is horrid and the food, just as bad. I have been here on several occasions because it always seems to have little wait these days and fits large parties. The worst is their brunch, my son ordered pancakes from their kids menu. It was literally 3 pieces of pancakes the size of a small coins. We ended up ordering a regular sized pancake afterwards."
Monica R.,"Danville, CA",558,111,153,4.0,3/4/2014,I love BJ's every dish I have tried here has been pretty good and reasonable in price as well as always having great service and a fun bar crowd. Great place to watch games.
Allan H.,"Fremont, CA",156,203,26,4.0,7/23/2013,"Okay I'm a bigger fan of this place now.... Although the food is still sub-standard for it's price range, the drink selection and my newfound love for a few of their specialty drinks have made up for it. Jeremiah Red: I don't need to turbo-browse these reviews to know that this is probably one of the best and favorite beers among the patrons, it's really got a full body taste and feel to it and is pretty alcoholic.  A fruitier and albeit less potent drink is their ciders. I actually enjoy drinking all of their ciders when I want to switch it up from drinking Reds. Although I feel like BJ's ciders falls a bit short of Yard House, it's a good and much closer alternative.  This updated rating either reflects a change in my personal preference of this place or is symbolic of my venture into alcoholism, either way, this has because a go-to spot for my friends and I."
D. L.,"Santa Clara, CA",4,14,,5.0,3/7/2016,"I have hosted a few BJ's pizza events in the past at different locations and this was the best overall experience. I hosted my son's birthday party here over the weekend and everything was expedited perfectly. My contact with Evan, the restaurant manager, was primarily thru email and he called me the morning of to confirm the party. Evan was professional and easy to talk to. Upon arrival, the room was set up exactly how I requested it to be, specifically a gift table, a kids table. And Jocelyn was our ""person""...she was on it! Sweet, patient, accommodating. Our party of 50 didn't intimidate her at all! She was awesome! We did a package that had replenish-able pizza, pasta, salad, and drinks! And Evan and jocelyn never made the food go empty! It kept coming and my guests were fed well! I really have no complaints! Thank you Bj's Newark...Evan & Jocelyn...for a smooth and memorable party.  Everyone had a great time!"
Blaire A.,"Union City, CA",57,113,72,4.0,3/21/2014,"First time I have ever come in and not gotten a pizza. They took away the cheeseburger pizza which was really disappointing, but anyway..... I ordered the California Burger and I took off the green chilis because I do not like spice. The bun is a piece of delicious garlic toast that will you have your mouth watering for more. Order the thin and crispy fries because they did not put enough on your plate to satisfy you. My boyfriend ordered the burger with bleu cheese and bacon (which was gross to me because I hate bleu cheese). He ordered it with wedges and it looked like they put a handful as this huge plate was mostly barren. I'm pretty sure this was a mistake though as I saw the next table over receive a burger and A LOT of wedges. Flavor wise I like thin and crispy a bit more than the wedges but they're close in flavor.  Our waiter was Lance. He was nice.  Strawberry lemonade was okay, but nothing special. I think I probably drank 4 glasses of it though so...."
Norman F.,"Union City, CA",270,35,21,1.0,5/23/2013,"1 star for decent food. Although their food is ok the service sucks!!! The last time I was here the server said stupid ass shit to us. He seemed like he was high which is cool, I don't care but we were with my girls parents. Real classy Tonight our server seemed hella out of it and barely said shit to us as we were ordering. She makes eye contact with us but walks by us hella fast without saying shit.  Never filled my water, never took our plates away.  But you never.... Never.... Fuck with my pazookie.  Servers name is ravinder k. I will not be returning. BTW this review comes from someone who works for tips and is extremely generous for actual good service."
Kristina N.,"Milpitas, CA",73,126,142,5.0,11/21/2014,"Well I've been to this BJ's for a gazillion times and last night was one of the best experiences I've ever had there. I didn't quite get our server name but she was AMAZING! Very nice, attentive and social. She's the reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars. Anyways the food here is okay, they're not bad but they're not to die for either. I always get the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wrap and the wings for appetizers, though their portions always fill me up. Their pizzas are pretty good, but the pastas are alright. Kinda just like Olive Garden, nothing special. However i'm sure everyone knows about their pizookies. They are DELICIOUS. I have had pizookies at other places but none are like BJ's. Oh god if i could I would eat like 5 a day!! Anyways i'm a fan of BJs and I most def would come back."
P A.,"Hayward, CA",6,85,65,2.0,4/26/2015,"The service is so slow.  It usually takes 15 minutes to receive your drink order.  The food used to be good, 2 years ago but I notice the menu continues to change and the prices at the BJ on Mowry is more expensive than other locations and the menu does offer the half/smaller portion selections.  A normal lunch on a Monday -Thursday will take 2 hours."
Bhargav S.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/1/2016,"When you order a vegetarian penne make sure they don't give you a shrimp penne!!! When you accidentally have one and tell the server, this is not a vegetarian penne... He simply laughs and says ""boss haven't you ever seen a shrimp before, you should have checked!"" Yeah rite!! It was not funny dude!!!  Its not funny to have eaten a shrimp when you have been a vegetarian all your life! I hope you guys see the order before you cook!"
Ronnie G.,"Hayward, CA",15,41,149,1.0,11/24/2014,"I've been here twice and had a terrible experience both times.  The restaurant is always under staff.  Food arrives late and cold.  If you don't flag down your waiter, you'll never get a refill on your drinks."
Anne E.,"Union City, CA",0,20,7,1.0,5/21/2015,"THEIR HAPPY HOUR IS A LIE.  they give you half portions for half the price so you're basically buying it for regular price. At all the places I've been to they're the only place that does that. Also, our server was very rude and seemed annoyed when we told him we were waiting for happy hour to start."
Cyrex G.,"San Leandro, CA",6,34,1,1.0,6/19/2013,"I've gone 5 times now and had to give up every time because the wait was 45 minutes. Went tonight (Wednesday 8:40PM), and we were told 25 minute wait. After awhile the host came over and apologized that she had to bump up the wait time to 45 minutes.  I'm sorry, but your excuse for a long wait shouldn't be ""because there's only one waiter for that section"".   Like their food but I the service is lacking."
Chrlens S.,"Hayward, CA",44,13,7,4.0,7/15/2015,Met a friend here and the setting was nice it's right off the freeway...  Food was good and service was good as well..
Concepcion B.,"Palo Alto, CA",73,9,8,1.0,3/1/2016,"WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER!! If I could I would put ZERO stars. It's my 2 year olds birthday and we decided to grab a late lunch here because it seemed family friendly. Everything was okay until 10 min after we left. My husband realized he accidentally left his sunglasses on the table. So I call right away to tell them. We were told no sunglasses found. My husband was 1000% sure it was left on the table. I told the gal on the phone to check again. Not only was I left on hold for 20 min, my husband calls on the other line and they answered right away. So either I was being left on hold on purpose or they were hoping I would hang up, or both (and IT WAS NOT BUSY, maybe only two other customers at the time). Who ever my husband talk to on the phone sounded like she was laughing and sarcastic. So my husband went back right away. When he got there the manager said they already looked and asked everyone. My husband said he wanted to talk to the busboy or whom ever cleared our table. The busboy came out and said he TOLD the manager and everyone he DID FIND THEM and placed them up front with the host. Somehow they made their way back somewhere else and TWO MINUTES LATER THE MANAGER GAVE THEM TO MY HUSBAND. DISHONEST BUNCH OF MF's!! Ok so they were just sunglasses. Well expensive sunglasses but that is beside the point. DISHONESTY AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
Matthew H.,"San Jose, CA",57,10,1,4.0,1/9/2015,Mark one of the coolest and nicest worker at BJ! He gave me an amazing  BJ experience that I will never forget! I'll come back for some more BJ from him soon. Thanks bro!
Viet N.,"Alameda, CA",349,464,226,3.0,1/29/2012,"It's a shame I was driving and that it was brunch time, or else I would have had a beer at this place. Maybe even a pizookie.  Because what I had didn't exactly blow my mind. I had the great beginnings (I think?) appetizer (basically mozzarella sticks, avocado wraps, some eggroll looking thing, and chips with spinch dip), and the California scrambled eggs.  Everything was loaded with cheese, and I couldn't even finish my entree. Yes, half of the appetizer and 1/3 of the entree was enough to fill me up (I was sharing with the other person in my party of 2).  It was good overall , and the sauces went very well with their respective appetizers. But throughout my meal, I kept thinking that this tastes exactly like something I would get at Fridays or Chilis. It was a little cheaper, but the food is not something I would go for on a regular basis, much like the other chain restaurants I mentioned.  However, the server, Christy, was very attentive throughout our time we were there, so plus points to BJ's!  However, next time I'm just coming back for a beer and a pizookie."
Kevin S.,"Plano, TX",28,825,2,4.0,1/29/2012,"In town to visit some family and friends, needed a place to watch the Patriots play the Ravens.  Considered a local pizza place...but when I found they had 2 very small screens....we changed it up to BJ's. Timing was perfect, we arrived just after kickoff and grabbed a table in the bar. Katrina was our waitress and she was good. Ordered some nachos to start for the first half and had a medium classic combo pizza for the second half. Nachos were loaded and loaded!  Very tasty!  We didn't finish them, and that's not usually the case...LOTS of nachos!! The pizza?  Excellent! The beer?  Great!  Had several Sam Adams. Parking can get tight, especially with a local game on (49ers, Giants, Sharks, etc). There is some construction going on with the old part of the mall...my guess is they are going to redo it or maybe make more parking?  who knows...but it doesn't improve things for now. Why 4 stars?  Just the layout of the place....didn't seem that well planned for when a crowd of people are standing in the bar area."
