Lancaster K.,"Union City, CA",38,29,9,3.0,9/21/2013,"I've been here numerous times and the experience has been what you would expect from a place like this. It's always busy. It's even worst when there's a game. It feels like everyone in Newark is here. This is a good place to watch a game but be wary of that beer tab. If you come here often with your significant other get the rewards card and earn that free desert. Food: The food here is pretty decent. We keep it simple and order Pizza, Wings, and Calamari. This is as good as it gets.  Overall this is always a great place to eat and hangout."
Christopher S.,"Union City, CA",116,21,125,4.0,4/8/2012,"Another local eatery that I've been to maybe a half dozen times and every time I've visited, it's been a good experience. It can get pretty craze during dinner time and the weekends so I usually shy away from this place unless it's for a birthday party, so it would be wise to call ahead of time for reservations because it can take a minute to get seated. Pretty reasonable prices for above average entrees. Their beer/cocktail selection is pretty bad ass too!  Try the shrimp lettuce wraps and the fried calamari.  For beers I usually go with the Brew house Blonde or Hef.  The pints look a bit smaller than usual tho or maybe it's the glass?"
Jay J.,"Union City, CA",1,67,,2.0,5/1/2015,"Not all bad, but not all good either.  The Good  Server was friendly and very attentive, quick with refills and extras. Thanked us for the good tip. Rib eye steak was very tasty and very large. Horseradish mashed potatoes were good. The Bad Wait time 20-25 mins Brussels sprouts didn't taste good. BLT salad had a dressing on it that also did not taste good. Too mustardy maybe? Nachos were nothing special, although a large serving. Baked Beignet tasted cold and old. Too much strawberry 'sauce' rather than fresh strawberries. The server was the best part."
Lilian L.,"South Bay, CA",129,526,116,3.0,12/23/2011,"Went here for the first time which also happened to be the first time that my boyfriend and I had a dinner party or any type of food get together with my friends.  My boyfriend and a mutual friend of ours got there at 6:38PM, the restaurant notified us that the wait would take an hour and a half.. Now an hour passed and then they said 58 minutes..  (we are a group of 10 and the table were waiting for had 30 people, but regardless a restaurant should not give times as a statement if they are unsure..) I ordered the New Orleans jambalaya. It was pretty good. My best friend didn't recommend this because when she had it, it was really oily and greasy. I found it to be fine, but a little spicy maybe for some. Also I got the Pizookie in Red Velet. It was really good, but really sweet even though I have a sweet tooth. My boyfriend on the other hand doesn't like things too sweet so it wasn't something he could even eat half of.  There was a 17% tip for our group.. thought it should be only 15... but it 17..  Waiter service: didn't do much, took forever to get our bill when we were done, she made a mistake but eventually that was resolved with a wrong dish. (Every server differs, but it wasn't a crazy night for a Tuesday) Would I go here again? maybe.. but, it's not that special.  My boyfriend said the burgers are like D&B burgers in case anyone was wondering. My friends said they would go back for fries, boyfriend said they were like potatoe chips. Only bad thing is they put either hella salt of MSG in their food.. I had to drink a lot of water that night, my boyfriend got up an had 3 FULL GLASSES of water.  Great thing is that they do call you in case you decide to go around since buzzers don't walk further distances. Parking looked hard for some, but I manage to get a spot, it wasn't too bad.  Atmposhere: not too dim.. it's okay. artwork on walls... etc.. it's like a bar/applebee's pretty much sort of.. great for maybe friends and stuff. P.S. NO COKE, only pepsi. but they have homemade rootbeer. (went on 12/20/2011)"
Angel Y.,"Fremont, CA",14,53,41,5.0,10/5/2014,"Delicious food every time! I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and it was absolutely delicious! My fiancé ordered the jambalaya and although the portion wasn't big enough for his liking, he was quite pleased. Great service."
Jason N.,"San Leandro, CA",106,5,1,3.0,8/22/2013,"My experiences here has been mixed. The food here is alright but the service seems to fluctuates. After coming in and reserving a party for 8 on a relatively busy night, we were seated an hour later in the the round, corner booth with an extra seat pulled up to seat our full party. If you can imagine, we were the literally packed like a can of sardines. I enjoy my company but I don't need to be playing footsies with every one of them. Then came our waitress who was completely apathetic to our situation. At this point, we waited too long and everyone was hungry.  I usually order the Crusted Parmesan Chicken and tonight was no exception except for that they forgot my veggies. No biggy right? I can just ask for them, so I did. Our waitress brought them out and they were clearly nuked. What a bummer. I've had better experiences here but be prepared for anything less less."
Evelina C.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",388,399,369,4.0,11/22/2011,"Came here for dessert for my sisters birthday dinner. We ordered 2 different Pazookis, one that was half red velvet & half cookies & cream and one that was half double chocolate chip & regular chocolate chip. They were absolutely delicious, but it took forever for the second Pazooki to come out."
Harsh M.,"San Jose, CA",50,74,186,4.0,3/16/2015,"Must try the stuffed mushrooms. BJs is always a go-to place for my group of friends as it has really great appetizers and pizza, and beer. This BJs in particular is in a nice location right off 880, for easier access for non-fremont/non-newarkians."
Lillian K.,"El Cerrito, CA",0,11,,2.0,9/1/2013,"Service was acceptable, seated very quickly, both servers we had (one going on break) were attentive and pleasant. But the food I had was ridiculously disappointing. I ordered a 'make your own' deep dish pizza. The crust, admittedly, was quite tasty and in line with what I expected, but the toppings/final execution and taste was just - lame. Greasy cheese, flavorless tomatoes, dry tiny meatballs, no taste of garlic except in one bite even though ordered it with roasted garlic. It was the equivalent sadly of a microwaveable 2-minute frozen pizza in taste as far as the toppings go. Not in any way worth the cost. Also, for evening/night time dining, the interior is ludicrously dark and poorly lit. Very poor showing overall."
Sasha M.,"Fremont, CA",0,31,6,5.0,8/15/2013,"Only bad thing was when I came here once and was waiting to be seated. A girl said she'd call me shortly. However later she just kept starring at me instead of calling me to let me now our table was ready. When I went upto after a while of her glancing at me here and there she says ""yea...your table is ready"" ...What the heck? lol whatever. The food also takes FOREVER to arrive when it's packed but I do see many waiters walking around and I understand why it would take a while with how many people are there on packed nights. ANYWAYS, I give this 5 stars because the food is always DELICIOUS. The waiters have always been so polite. Once my friends foods arrived before mine and the manager came out apologizing and said I can have any appetizer for free so I could eat with my friends. The food came in right away after the manager came out. I thought that was great customer service.   and omg their PIZOOKIs (did i spell that right?) are SOOOO DELICIOUS! YUM. I get the smaller size than the regular ones because it's too chocolatey. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Especially at night to go on a date, friends night out, or even a family day out! The atmosphere at night is kinda dark. I like that though lol."
Jim D.,"Oakland, CA",584,702,412,3.0,1/3/2011,"Great place to watch college football. I met with three buddies to watch the Stanford vs Virginia Tech game at BJ's  BJ's had beer specials where the beer pints are half off the regular prices. Three of us had beers while one of the buddies was drinking wine (who watches football and drinks wine). We also ordered the platter with the avocado rolls, taquitos, mozzarella sticks with chip and nachos. I thought the platter was really tasty plus they had special pricing. The avocado rolls with the cream cheese are the best.  After a couple beers we had a second wind for eating so we order three of the mini pizzas one combination, one margherita and one bacon/cheeseburger.  I didn't taste the bacon/cheeseburger but I did taste the two others. Both were very good and the crust was light and fluffy, similar to a croissant. Friendly service and the servers are on the spot when you need a refill...."
Linda D.,"San Jose, CA",1211,448,1494,4.0,1/10/2012,"An hour wait on a Friday night? Geezus squeezes.  Super packed. The calamari appetizer was super crispy n good.  I got the tomato salad. It had slices of tomatoes with fresh mozzarella balls and Parmesan in balsamic vinaigrette. Super tasty.  I ordered a small pizza half great white shark, and bjs combo for my nephew. It was ok I expected deep dish pizzas to be loaded with more marinara, cheese, and toppings though ha. Just from what I've seen on TV, but it was just alright.  I had some of my moms salmon it was good. And mashes potatoes? Hella good!  My sister ordered a steak medium rare and it looked like black dookey, burnt, overcooked and chewy. So maybe avoid the steaks or get em medium rare.  Awesome to bring kids for the kids menu. It's like 5 bucks n my nephew got a pretty big plate of spaghetti, side of mashed potatoes, and a drink.  My waiter was also very friendly."
Stephanie K.,"Monterey, CA",0,8,1,2.0,11/1/2014,"Food is good but they lie about the portions. My fried chicken meal was supposed to have two chicken breast but in reality they split one breast into two pieces. As a lady that gets full quickly, I cleaned my plate and was left wanting. My boyfriend was still hungry after his meal and was looking for others scraps."
Angela K.,"San Lorenzo, CA",295,673,1071,4.0,1/8/2012,"On your birthday, you will receive a COMPLIMENTARY PIZOOKIE DESSERT,  This coupon expires in 2 weeks."
Abena O.,"Manhattan, NY",11,123,52,1.0,1/14/2013,"I've been to this place multiple times (against my will) due to its close proximity to my house. Sadly, each time I become more unimpressed by the food and service. They have a rather large menu which is good if you are dining there with picky eaters. However, the food is the definition of mediocre. Nothing that I have had there is even worth mentioning other than their pizookie. Nothing on the menu is particularly special. Honestly, I could get the same quality of food for cheaper at Chili's, Denny's, etc.  For me, service is really important. I'll continue to go back to a place if the people who work there provide excellent service, but this place is lacking in that area as well. I always experience slow, bad service when I'm there.  I have to admit that I like the interior of the restaurant and I feel like it has a good atmosphere. So I guess I can kind of see why people go there. Especially if they love beer."
Henna P.,"Fremont, CA",98,282,222,4.0,11/7/2011,"This place is right by my work and has become the default Happy Hour watering hole on Fridays. I think their drinks are over priced, but the cocktails are yummy :9  The portions are a good size so I always end up with leftovers to take home. I recently shared a large Portabello Mushroom pizza with 2 other people and we each ended up with an extra slice to take home. It was very tasty! I hate the parking lot. It's the most poorly designed parking lot ever. Seriously. Whatever moron designed it needs to go back to parking lot design school. The layout is terrible, there are weird bumps and dips all over the place, the spots are different sizes, and it's just like a really bad maze because there's no flow to the design. It probably doesn't help that Mervyn's went out of business and there's nothing else open in that plaza. But at least you don't have to fight for parking spots with retail shoppers."
Erin W.,"Cape Elizabeth, ME",87,29,11,4.0,4/15/2013,"So, in a slight variation on the Valentine's Day tradition my wife said,""Well, you can get a steak, at BJs.""   We ended up doing other things that night and never made it out there. So, when the in-laws popped in over the weekend and asked if there was anyplace we wanted to try for dinner, we decided it was time to try BJs out. Our party was seated quickly on a busy night and our server popped in for drinks right away. I wanted to get food ordered for the boy first thing and our server was happy to accomodate. I write that, because many servers out there develop severe brain freeze when I try to order food before the drinks. She saw the logic and made it happen. Wifey loved her sesame salad, In-laws liked their food, turkey burger and shrimp & lettuce wraps. I prolly was the least pleased of the bunch food-wise. I ordered a burger with bacon and cheddar, thinkin it would be a safe bet. Safe, sure. Great, not so much. The burger looked formidable at first glance, but was found out to be a thin pattied wimp. There was about 3 inches of lettuce and several tomatoes hiding about a half inch of burger and 2 anemic bacon slices beneath. It tasted fine, but I will pick something else from their extensive menu next time. There will be a next time. The service was great start-to-finish and the space is more of a loud restaurant with a few TVs than it is a sports' bar so it seems well suited for families."
Stephanie A.,"Union City, CA",44,8,1,2.0,4/30/2015,The staff is pretty friendly but I give them 2 stars for service. It took 45 min for a chicken Caesar salad.
Colin T.,"Fremont, CA",28,30,3,2.0,11/16/2014,"For food 2 stars. Just come here for sports and you will avoid heartache and disappointment. Had the angel hair pasta and lasagna . We felt that both were just reheated and not fresh. The cheese had melted with the pasta into chunks. My pasta was supposed to be served with garlic oil. Either the oil wasn't present or it had completely soaked into the pasta (shudder). We had fond memories of this place. The food was good back then, not now."
Priscilla F.,"Fremont, CA",129,53,9,3.0,2/8/2014,"Long story short: Food was okay, service was not.  Went here last night with a few of my friends and our server was originally a guy named Chris. But since he was going on lunch or leaving, another server took care of us named Nayeli.  She seemed nice at first but first impressions can be deceiving. She took our orders and visited the table ONCE before other servers delivered out food to the table.  She hardly checked on us and didn't even refill our drinks. The wait to get our food was RIDICULOUS!!! It would've been a little better had our server checked on us a few times but she didn't.  When we finally got our food, we didn't even finish because we waited so long. My friend and I split a bacon chicken ranch pizza which was pretty good, another friend ordered fettuccine Alfredo (basic) and another one ordered a margherita fresca flatbread or something like that (chewy bread). After dinner, we ordered dessert. About 15-20 minutes passed before we got our dessert and it was the wrong one and again she didn't even bring it to the table, someone else did. We told the server that our dessert was wrong so she took it back to the kitchen. About 2 minutes later, Nayeli brings out the dessert that we just rejected and said that another server took our order, the kitchen is making another one and to just eat the one she brought out again while we were waiting. Seriously? By this time my friends and I didn't care because she wasn't being the best server anyway, plus a free pizookie is a win for anyone.  I don't know if it was because it was Friday or whatever but service was pretty bad. Waited forever to get our food and they couldn't get our dessert right.  I enjoy going to BJ's but it really depends on the server you get. It might be awhile until I visit this BJ's again.. This is the third time I've received bad service there. It might be bad luck with the servers or the nights that I happen to go, either way 3 stars is all you get BJ's."
