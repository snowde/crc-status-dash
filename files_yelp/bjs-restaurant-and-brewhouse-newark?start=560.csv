Joy H.,"Milpitas, CA",20,3,7,4.0,3/29/2014,"I'd only been to a BJ's one time before, and it was pretty good. So when the hunnie suggested we try the one in Newark, I was game.  We have driven past it many times, and every time it was packed. But we went at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon and got a table immediately. The decor of the restaurant was awesome.  The bar looked nice and we'll stocked.  The place was clean. Overall appearance was great. Service...meh. We were seated and it took about 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink order. It wouldn't have been too bad if the place was busy,  but it wasn't.  We ended up placing our orders...we got the fried calamari, he ordered the Bbq pulled pork sandwich with their crispy fries,  and I ordered the new roast beef dip with wedged fries. The calamari breaded and deep fried and served with a lemony tartar-like sauce and a spicy marinara sauce. It was good,  crispy, but a little oily. They could have drained it a bit more. His pulled pork was pretty good. The pork was tender and the flavor was intense. The coleslaw that came with it was warm,  and I didn't like that.  The fries, well, they were fries. My dip...it was awesome! The roll was toasted.  There was a good amount of beef on the sandwich. The Swiss cheese was perfectly melted. The au jus had a lot of flavor. The wedged fries seemed to have a coating on them and were fried crispy, which I liked. The meal itself I give 4 stars. Then came dessert. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia pizookie.  It came out within 5 minutes and looked amazing. It was served with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  We dig in and it was delicious! It could have been cooked a tad bit longer, I think, but the flavor was just yum. We finished that fast. When we left, the place was crowded, and it wasn't even 5:00 yet! Definitely go early if you want a table. We will."
Mike L.,"Fremont, CA",0,33,7,2.0,6/4/2015,"Wow 15 minute wait and 20 tables open? Terrible service, long wait, tiny parking lot but not their fault, ridiculous that you can't be seated because of lack of staff. More people in the bar than the restaurant and less staff but people are seated and eating."
Elaine Y.,"Fremont, CA",33,507,5,2.0,12/5/2014,"typical chain sports bar restaurant with big tvs and lots of people.  was i expecting something different? not really i guess.  had a salad that actually needed more lettuce. it was full of other things like meat but it needed more veggies and it needed to be colder. warm salad not good.  the tacos were good except the plates came out sticky. it's not fun to eat something with your hands but when you touch the plate it's sticky. anyway, if you want a chain place then go."
Kenneth L.,"Fremont, CA",23,32,9,3.0,2/16/2015,"This would be a 3.5 stars review if possible. My friends and I went to watch the NBA All-Star game there. We sat at the bar tables and had the carnitas fries with chile verde as well as a large BJ's favorite pizza. The ambiance is nice. It's definitely a nice place to watch games with friend. The massive tv at the bar area makes watching sports pretty great. The waitstaff is nice but generally very busy. This means that they'll take awhile to come back to you and ask you if you need refills or are ready to order. That's really because BJ's always seems to have a fairly long wait (the bar area less so than the restaurant section). All in all, this place fits the criteria of a nice place to watch a game. The food and drinks are what you expect of BJ's. Decent food but fairly pricey. The carnitas fries were good, a little bit too much salt in there though. The carnitas were tender and the chile verde complimented the fries and carnitas well. This was probably my favorite thing I had there that night. The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was pretty good as well. Not the most amazing deep dish pizza I've ever had but definitely a good pizza. It had a little of everything (sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, olives) and the flavors blended well (obviously, because its essentially a combo pizza). The crust was quite addicting (I'm not a crust guy either) as the dough was crispy on the outside while still maintaining that nice chew in the middle. Again, this was pretty salty, so if you don't like salty foods you should probably stay away from this place. For my drink I had the root beer (because I wanted refills.....we were there for about 3 hours). I was tempted by some of the alcoholic drinks but ended up getting the root beer instead. I'll probably come back to try some of their alcoholic drinks. As for the root beer it was definitely one of the best root beer I've ever had. They come in a frosted mug (essential because it keeps the root beer cold while not diluting it with ice) and unlimited refills (I had about 5 rounds of root beer).  All in all, I spent about $17 (including tax and tip) for this meal. Not horrible because of what I went there for (decent food, drinks, and watching the all-star game with friends) but definitely not cheap. I would definitely come back once in awhile to watch some sports with my friends but probably not regularly or even semi-regularly. My PSA for this place would be that I did slip into a salt-induced food coma after getting home. Be forewarned."
Prashanth S.,"Central District, Fremont, CA",105,10,8,4.0,3/15/2015,Good for a very late night dinner in Newark. As with all BJ'S you won't be disappointed. But parking is a spot of bother
John H.,"Fremont, CA",1,55,1,3.0,1/21/2015,"Was tempted to give this a 2-star. Bar's the place to be; comfortable and the tenders are usually gregarious and efficient. Beer's acceptable, but the food is Dennys++.  Pizza rates a ""nice try"". The fun pluses in this place are the black cherry and cream sodas, both ostensibly house-made."
Joe B.,"Hayward, CA",16,10,2,5.0,5/31/2015,I'm a regular here... And usually I get treated really well. U can call ahead and reserve a spot..food deserves 5 stars...sometimes it can take a while but hey that's fine because the more time you spend with the family the better... Thank you bjs for keeping it real.
Kris J.,"Concord, CA",41,248,153,4.0,9/17/2013,"Came here on Sunday during the 49ers game. It was packed! but we got seated within 5 mins because I was on the call ahead list. Food came quick because I ordered to-go. so almost as soon as we got seated, our appetizers and pizza came out. YAY! They have happy hour at the bar section as long as the game is on, double YAY! and the whole restaurant cheers when the 49ers make a good play. they cheer REALLY REALLY LOUD. lol. Good place to watch the game!"
Justin L.,"Concord, CA",0,36,11,3.0,3/10/2015,"Food was great, but server was very slow to come to table and great us, to take our order, and for food delivery. Also my wife's plate was missing some food. Went on a Tuesday wasn't that busy you would expect them to be fast but just wasn't the case today."
James H.,"Fremont, CA",32,36,7,5.0,5/26/2015,"I'm a regular here. I live in fremont.. There are lots of bad reviews about the service here. But that's not always the case... Yes I have had some experiences where the service was not soo perfect, but for the most part they do a pretty good job. I give them 5 stars for the good quality.... I've always had a great dinner here. Buffalo chicken, spaghetti or steak... They make it really good... I'm never disappointed... I've been coming here since 2 years and will continue to do so.... Great job bjs"
Jill J.,"Sunnyvale, CA",17,81,3,3.0,12/28/2014,"As with most of the reviews here, service is very slow. My boyfriend and I were not in a hurry and had a few drinks. Our server would not let us order happy hour with her so we had to order at bar and bring them over ... Meh. In addition there was a mistake with our pizza, appreciated that she admitted it was her fault as most servers would not:) . However the food runner ( who looked like the most unhappiest person in the world) brought us the wrong pizza on accident ... And the other food did taste like it had been sitting for a while. Our server was really sweet but the food runner did not smile and said nothing when she delivered  our food, we had to yell to ask her for ketchup. Well we were offered the mistake pizza for free since we touched it and a free pizZookie. Maybe not our first choice for food but it was decent if you have lots and lots of time ;)"
Janel P.,"Hayward, CA",6,34,3,4.0,3/19/2013,"Absolutely love the Atlantic Salmon dish....wasn't expecting the quality of food from a chain restaurant that has its own brewery going, but gotta give credit when credit is due!! Much superior quality than other chain restaurants. Variety of beer and sampler drinks available is simply awesome, can keep coming back, too bad they have an hour or longer wait during peak times.... that's the only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars. They need to open one in Hayward, CA."
Susan P.,"Alameda, CA",12,20,35,3.0,3/1/2014,A long wait of half an hour to be seated for such a small portion of crowd. Tortilla soup is salty and the turkey sandwich. Won't be back for awhile. We have a nice waitress comes in to check on us every 10 min.
Russell T.,"Orange, CA",62,9,1,2.0,4/25/2015,"Parking sucks but what evs. A whopping 6 TV screens running. Plates already have sauce on them before they hit your table. Calamari has zero flavor. However, staff is very friendly and accommodating. Service on its own would earn 5 stars."
Karm P.,"Fremont, CA",18,19,37,3.0,6/10/2014,3 stars cuz last time i was here i did not see the Jambalaya on the menu anymore hmmmmmm......other than that avocado egg rolls and the Buffalo ranch pizza......not much of a beer drinker but if u are You must come check this place out got a lot of beeeaa choices haha ......on that note Cheers Mate.
Brenda N.,"Fresno, CA",48,41,17,3.0,11/16/2012,"I came here with my sister a few weeks back and wasn't really wow'd about the place.      We sat at the bar and the counter was a sticky wet mess.  I had to use my dinner napkin to wipe it down a little.  Eh. . . Anyhow, I came for the happy hour appetizers while my sister ordered happy hour drinks.  The finger-food items were ok . . . I'm thinking the sticky counter ruined my experience.  However, the bartender was pretty good with getting my sister her drinks within a timely manner so no complaints there.   I read from a previous post that BJ's makes their own sodas too.  Hmm, now I might be back for that.  Awesome."
Jenny T.,"London, United Kingdom",243,260,665,3.0,3/27/2011,"This is one of my favorite late-night suburban hangouts when I'm catching up with friends. They have an excellent happy hour menu - mini pizzas, mac & cheese, crispy calamari and chicken pot stickers - and happy hour is available late in the evening.  It's always fun to sit at the bar, watch the game, chat with the bartenders and get served IMMEDIATELY."
Thuyvi M.,"Hayward, CA",713,853,632,4.0,2/9/2013,Came here on a Friday night told it was going to  be a 40 minute wait for 2 but within 15 minutes we got a table. Service and food was on point. Our server made my 1st time experience a good one. Very attentative and informative. We ordered way too much food since our eyes were hungry. We got 2 appetizers 2 entrees and drinks! I must say the calamari was really good and not tough and rubbery. For my entree I got the chicken parm. and it was really hot and good. The chicken didnt taste processed and the mashed potatoes were fluffy and perfect. Overall my experience was really good but I have to knock off one star for price. Our bill was $128 not including tip just for two people but I guess it was worth it :)
Artemis X.,"Santa Clara, Hayward, CA",10,119,66,2.0,10/14/2013,"We came here to redeem a Google Offer for a three course meal for $20.00 I am not a fan of ordering pizzas with ""1/2 this and 1/2 that""  as it seems to cause confusion.  In this case, it seemed clear that April, our server, had a clear understanding of our order yet, the kitchen did not.   It took an unreasonable amount of time to receive our drinks and when April did reappear, she apologized, saying that she had to explain our order to the kitchen.  I was exasperated, as I didn't understand the explanation requiring an absence of that length.  April went to lunch, introducing us to Lori(Ann).  The pizza we received looked hearty and appetizing, yet it wasn't how we'd requested it, so we sent it back. The manager brought the second one which STILL wasn't accurate, so we sent that back for as much of a remedy as was available at the time. In the meantime, we'd stopped here because we were hungry and pretty much an hour passed before we received our entree.   We were offered an additional pizookie at no cost for the mistake. In the end, I don't plan on going back here.  If you do, please request Lori(Ann) because I experienced her as a true service professional.  Of all the persons involved, she showed heart, she was genuine.   The manager was involved, but it was one of those things where she is stepping into a mess she didn't make and trying to correct it as much as she can. April...well I appreciate that she understood what we wanted, and after the fact apologized for our experience."
Karen T.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2016,"Poor service. Forgot to bring the salad before the jambalaya. Asked for no rice and yet it appeared under the jambalaya. Switched servers after ordering due to a server leaving their shift which we appreciated. However not one server came back to see what we thought of the meal. Over spiced jambalaya as well. Poor parking too, with the need to circle the parking place several times. Second time we have had this level of service and won't return now."
