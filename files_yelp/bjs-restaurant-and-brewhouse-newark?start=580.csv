Elizabeth C.,"Union City, CA",109,112,57,4.0,10/3/2013,"BJs has great beer and great food.  I mean what else can you ask for?  Sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but I see the servers bustling around so I think it's more of a workload issue than a speed issue. Their Jeremiah Red is one of the best Red Beers around, but when it's Oktoberfest time I get even more excited.  Their pizzas range from the classic to the creative and are cooked Chicago style, although they're recently added flatbreads, thin crusts, and even gluten free!  A note - pizzas tend to take a little while to make...especially ones in pans so be patient! Their pizookies are so delicious, from the classic chocolate chip to the seasonal ones like rasberry white chocolate almond.  A FRESH baked cookie, warm and topped with ice cream...YUM! When they have the 2 for $20, I always try and go - two salads or soups, one medium pizza, and a pizookie to share - it's perfect!"
Tony U.,"Oakland, CA",292,872,598,3.0,7/30/2011,"Nice sports bar like environment.  Excellent appetizers (especially the avocado roll and stuffed mushrooms).  The Fish Tacos were nasty.  Although I had a great time, how could an establishment muck up on fish tacos? It was the shell, it had to have been stale or overfried making the shell texture not pleasurable. Also, the calories of the food: ridiculous.  Still fun place despite my few gripes.  Service very good too."
Derek B.,"Atascadero, CA",1,23,5,4.0,7/15/2014,"Was looking to try this location near our new home and once we were finally accepted after trying once or twice, found it's not half bad! PROS: -Expansive menu with great food options, something akin to Elephant Bar. -Pricing is fairly decent, there are definitely ways to save money if you make good choices. -Nice atmosphere, kind of like a younger and trendier PF Changs or Elephant Bar. CONS: -Busy, busy, busy. We've walked up to this place on more than one occasion and we're told there was a 1-1.5 hr wait, wow! You're not allowed to call in ahead of time to get a reservation either, perhaps after a certain time maybe. -Given that it's busy, the waiters attention can be seriously compromised. Our waiter had issues coming regularly or when needed and would sometimes walk away before an order or request was fully resolved, strange! -It's a fairly loud atmosphere, especially around the bar area. Sort of a great place to go if you want to have more than a few drinks, talk loud, watch the game, and be merry...just be wary if you're thinking to bring certain people. -My spoon or fork was super dirty with a huge chunk of something on it...something nasty but I forget what it was...we told them but there was no consideration given...we even had to bug them b/c they forgot to replace. So yeah, the customer service CAN be lacking although more visits are needed to resolve an opinion. Hoping to try again soon."
Kevin W.,"Euless, TX",691,570,464,5.0,12/21/2012,"I love this place. This place has TVs for all the games. It has a great drink selection, beer, non alcoholi, and mixed. They have hand crafted beverages. All the food was great. I was unimpressed by the pizookies but they were tasty also. Go check this place out. The avacado eggrolls and pizzas are excellent. They have great happy hour specials."
Lynn C.,"Paris, France",125,1056,611,4.0,10/25/2010,"The drinks are TOO sweet but everything else was excellent. Went to BJ's for happy hour. Had to wait in the bar to get seats so we had the $1 off cocktails and a Poke for appetizer. The poke was AMAZING!! it's not served in a glass but comes with these delicious garlicky chips.  For entree, I got the new orleans jambalaya. It was SPICY, not authentic, but still tasty.  Loved the atmosphere and our bartender. Our server seemed like he was high, and kept bothering us about the cheque. Not cool."
Evelyn R.,"San Jose, CA",130,210,20,4.0,5/28/2014,"Good food and service. We tried some pizza, chicken wings, avocado rolls, and artichoke dip...all very good. Especially the chicken wings. I also tried the scallops but they were gross. I sent them back and had it taken off my bill. The pizookies were very good as well. I tried the macadamia and oreo pizookie but the oreo was better. This Bjs location is nice and clean. I would go again."
K S.,"San Jose, CA",3,227,4,4.0,12/4/2014,"Pretty cool place to hang out and have a beer or 2 with friends. Usually super packed though and has long wait time. Food is pretty unhealthy, but tasty."
Ravi C.,"Austin, TX",55,277,16,3.0,9/18/2013,"Don't see a point in writing a detailed review for a chain restaurant... but here we go... It almost feels blasphemous eating at a chain in the bay area given the options we have here. We stumbled to this place after laughing mad at the made up theater and at that late hour, starving we were in no mood to search. So, we came here. (gee!! I sound so apologetic!!) For Drinks we ordered IPA(liked it), a Mohito, a Long Island(no one offered me a taste) and for the teetotaler a cream soda( tasted it and it was wonderful).  We ordered the Avocado rolls and Mushroom bites(Don't remember what it's called) and they were good. Only down side is the sauce that comes with Avocado rolls. It's too sweet and I don't think it goes well with the rolls. Instead I asked for Cholula  hot sauce,which I think is perfect match. We ordered a large Vegetarian Pizza for main course and finished it real fast. I am very prejudicial when it comes to Pizza. The only Pizza I like is NY style pizza with very few toppings. So, when everyone wanted to order Pizza... I said yes but was very cynical about it. But for once... they were right and I was wrong. The Pizza was amazing, not NY style but the crust was fluffy and the flavors were subtle. After devouring the Pizza we ordered a Pizokie trio with Red velvett, white chocolate Macadamia and cookies and cream. They were okay... but next time, I am going to order only the single flavor version. I think because of the tininess of the cookies, they were not soft and chewy anymore.  The service was great and the food was enjoyable. Definitely a place to go to have some good food and good drinks late at night."
Dora C.,"Fremont, CA",778,227,35,2.0,9/17/2012,"Every time I walk into BJ's I feel like the hostesses are very reluctant.  It always seems like they notice you right when you walk in, but then react only 2 mins later.  Quite frankly, it makes me feel pretty awkward, because I'm just standing there looking at them while they look at me.  However, once they acknowledge you, they are usually pretty quick with seating!   Normally at these types of restaurants, I always get pasta, but for some reason BJ's pasta isn't very good!  I'm not the only one who thinks so, because all my friends agree with me as well.  I recommend their burgers,  I got the bacon cheeseburger the last time I went.  All the burgers come with a side of fries.  I was extremely satisfied with the burger I got.  Their meet is USDA, and it's just really juicy and big!   As for pizookies, if you want to just eat one by yourself then I recommend the mini ones.  I recommend the peanut butter and cookies and cream one.  My friend also said that the red velvet pizookie is really good!  The one that I don't recommend is the chocolate one [triple something?], it's waaaaaaay too sweet! But yes, normally people come to BJ's for the pizookies, so definitely order one to just try! So the reason why I give this BJ's 2 stars is because of a particular experience I had once about a year ago.  I came with my friends [5 girls], and being in high school, we don't have that much money!  Anyways at the end of our meal, we all split the bill and paid in a lot of fives and ones, but one of my friends paid in quarters!  Since it was a lot of quarters, we decided to make the waitress's job easier by putting them in piles of four, however, when our waitress saw the money, she was super pissed off, and demanded one of our parents [who wasn't even dining and only there to pick up my friend] to take all the quarters back and give her bills.  I thought this was super rude of the waitress, and I mean money is money, does it matter if it's coins or bills? In conclusion, I honestly feel like BJ's is only worth going to if you're craving pizookies."
MaryAnn W.,"San Diego, CA",103,177,49,5.0,11/26/2013,"We waited about 45mins for a table for 11 people. I would image because the 49er game was on so it was okay. Anyways we got seated and half our party was about 15mins late and our server didn't mind. Our server was Jonathan. He was so awesome. I mean he serve the table by himself plus a little help when bring out the food, but that's with all servers. The reason I give Jonathan a high five for his great servers is because 11 people we got everything we needed. He did it with a smile and never forgot any extra. He made sure our water was filled and if we needed anything else. Its a plus to me with my water especially when I went through 3 glasses and I never once had to ask him to fill it, he did it on his own. Our food came out within 20 mins which was no bigger because we were with family and friends for a birthday.  The don't even add gratuity to the receipt with big groups which is a plus but we ended up tipping about 25%."
Mari P.,"Fremont, CA",20,200,50,1.0,9/4/2012,"Went in for lunch, granted we got a booth right away...our waitress was horrible. The waiter next to our booth saw that we had been waiting for awhile and went and checked on our drinks, found our waitress. He was super friendly and helpful.  This girl took our order with the grumpiest face. Food came back with the wrong sides but we said screw it and ate it because we were hungry and had to leave. Took forever to get our check so again the waiter next door,  saw us waiting and ended getting our check for us. Some people just can't be in this biz, after reading some reviews...they need a floor manager walking around checking in with tables, I would have surely called her out.  And her tip reflected the service we received =)"
Kathryn K.,"Stockton, CA",17,11,1,5.0,4/1/2015,"This is my favorite Resturant in Newark! Love the Santa Fe rolls & the s'mores pizookie the best! Tonight I ordered the pizookie for take out & they accidentally gave me the wrong order but when I called them up the guy who took my order, Eric, was very helpful and polite. He fixed the problem in no time and as always, I was very happy with my service and my order!"
Krista T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/31/2015,Wow. So disappointed today in the service and management. Female manager Dedra?We ordered food for my husband and I and our 2 year old. Toddler food arrived. Ours never did - and they tried to charge us the $6.00 for the toddler's food. When I approached the manager she was unapologetic and said oh I can take the $6 bill. Really? Nothing else. Not even a sincere apology. I never write poor reviews or contact corporate but tonight doing both. If management actually makes it right I would edit this review. We will see if anyone responds.
Jerry Y.,"Fremont, CA",6,21,,2.0,9/23/2012,"BJ's Is Consistent This is the 4th BJ's I've visited, and all of them are consistent. They all have slow service and screw up food orders. Pros: + The restaurant is clean. Cons: - Hostesses did not acknowledge our presence upon entering the restaurant, although business is slow and we were the only ones at the entrance. - Waitress did not refill my soda. - Our two entrees took 30 minutes to arrive. - The bill took 15 minutes to arrive.  - My wife's salad contained cheese, although she requested no cheese. It appears the chef attempted to scrape out the cheese before serving it. Good thing she's not allergic to cheese. - Food is overpriced relative to the quality and quantity."
JOHN S.,"San Leandro, CA",2,20,,3.0,1/31/2015,"I called first to put my name on the waiting list and when I arrived it was a 5min. Wait time for a table (not bad). I had the New Orleans Jambalaya which was good but bland, and a little to much Red Pepper Seasoning for my taste. The salad had tasted great,can't think of the name of it but it had rasberry vinegette. The restaurant is open til 12am and the bar til 1am."
Jen I.,"Markham, Canada",120,229,27,3.0,6/29/2013,"I'd heard about the slow service here and was a little hesitant to try this place out, but I'm glad we did. Yes, the service was a tad on the slow side, but the hosts and servers were very polite and attentive so I don't have much to complain about. We got a bunch of appetizers, all were great. We got the calamari, avocado spring rolls (yummy!), stuffed mushrooms, and some chorizo thing that I didn't try although the others at my table liked it. For dinner I got the Chicken Fried Steak with white cheddar mashed potatoes...I LOVE chicken fried steak but there wasn't enough of the white gravy, and sadly the steak was a little stringy. I still enjoyed the meal, since luckily they give you a LOT of food so I just cut around the crappy parts. The mashed potatoes were really good, but the veggies they serve were bland and plain.  I was way too full to even think about dessert! They had a nice (but typical) selection of them from the menu.  The prices were fantastic - for our group of 5 that ordered apps, entrees, and beer, it was $130. Not too shabby! PS. I kept giggling at the name the whole time I was there. BJ's. Tee hee."
Abhishek S.,"Fremont, CA",30,8,,5.0,12/31/2014,"Ahhh!! what should I tell about this place, Awesome food, awesome Beers, nice place to enjoy with friends and family."
Cliff G.,"Fremont, CA",0,13,1,4.0,1/26/2015,"We go here quite a lot, It's one of the few places open this late.  I like it, and so do others, as it is always full.  The tomato bisque is great, especially paired with Jeremiah red.  We like the thick pizza's, love those burned parts next to the pan.  Mediterranean is a good choice  Watermelon/Feta salad, for something very light.  Drake's Denogginizer, best beer. Only complaint is sometimes the service is a little slow, the servers probably have too many tables each. KJ index: 34.25 (KJ Chardonnay was $34.25 last time I checked)."
Venkata W.,"Union City, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/11/2014,"This was the first time I went to BJs in Newark.  When we waked in, there was a young group of hostesses hanging around the front of the restaurant carrying on multiple conversations.  I did not understand why there were so many congregating and crowding the front of the restaurant. We were seated in the 20 min wait time.  But when we went to our table, it was not wipes clean from the previous seating.  When we pointed that out to our server, another young girl, she went up to the congregation and yelled at them.  They just watched her disinterestedly.   Then she came back, said she was sorry, that there were no silverware and napkins for us to use, and went to find them. She did not try to clean the table, or send anyone to do this.  The congregation was back to just that....their conversations.  Later, she returned with the napkins and silverware, after the appetizer had arrived and our hands were dripping with the sauces. When I ordered my glass of wine, which came in a carafe, she poured it for me.  The problem?  She did not pour all of it.  In fact, she gave me a awkward smile, and took the last remaining bit with her!  What gives? The main course, when it came out was warm, but nothing great.  The flavors did not stand out.  It was mediocre. We normally tip generously, so that did not happen here.  Needless to say, we won't be returning."
Michelle O.,"Emeryville, CA",11,26,3,2.0,11/15/2014,"Just had dinner at this place. My stomach is aching! I had the parmesan crusted chicken. Flavor wasnt that great. The lighting was poor, very dim making my entire dinner party squint just to read all of the tiny writing  on the menu. Not to menton for a party of 3, the wait was over  30min. The menu  is plentiful  with selections, but I am in no rush to return"
