Kia F.,"San Jose, CA",3,125,12,1.0,6/21/2017,"We were here Tuesday night from 10:15pm until around 11:55pm, June 20, 2017. Our server was Shea, and she was inattentive and served us in a hurry. She would come and leave with a quickness that was unbecoming of basic food service hospitality. She left me wondering if she even wanted to be there to ""take care of us"". No refills, she gave us the bare minimum version of checking-in and no ""sorry the food is taking a while"". She managed to drop off the bill with a sub-standard script and snatched it away without a word as soon as it was ready. She left the card and customer copy in the same swift, non-verbal way.  To top it off, the fries were barely warm, we waited 40 minutes for the food and the steak was chewy. This was not a good night at BJs, Fremont. It wasn't even busy! Thanks, but we will remember to go somewhere else."
Steve C.,"Hayward, CA",14,19,23,3.0,1/16/2017,"I usually only review a place if it's a 1 or 5 star place. Either you had to be really mad enough to remember to write a review, or the experience went so well you feel compelled to shout your love to the world via Yelp reviews.  Today's experience with BJ's was mainly an indulgence trip; I came literally for the chocolate chip pizookie.  Like a genius, I decided to order the full size version with a glass of milk for just one: me. This experience definitely is best left in your mind. However I do think I won't be thinking about eating a whole pizookie ever again.  Let's break this review down into sections: customers, environment, cleanliness, location, parking, food quality, service. Customers are standard of a family friendly restaurant. Some families are here, some couples, some old friends who deserve their own sitcom where they can sit-calm... I'm punny. That's how we Filipinos say ""funny"".  The environment is chill. Got some paintings on the wall and tvs with sports on them. Music is okay. Good enough to blend into any conversation without you really giving a crap about the music.  Points docked for cleanliness. I arrived around 3pm so it's not too crowded, yet my table still had obvious residue. I do not want to lean my arms on the table. the seat was fine tho.  This location is right off the freeway and near Newpark Mall so it's like Landmark status. Easy to find and the parking (at least for 3pm). FOOD QUALITY!!! Caps lock helps wake up the readers. The pizookie was too big for me to want to finish alone. This definitely requires 2 or more in my opinion. The flavor is good though. The outsides of the cookie are crispy with a gooey chocolatey center. So the cookie isn't fully cooked. It is crunchy outside and gooey inside. If this is what you like more power to you. The vanilla ice cream quality is okay too. You can see the vanilla beans in the ice cream. The milk is standard milk.  SERVICE.... A bit slow. I can understand though because I am not the only person this waitress has to worry about. She helping lots of other people so I forgive the wait times. Midway through she had a dude named Mike come and replace her so she can take her lunch break. This guy is okay he is chill. I just wish he was around to ask for the check earlier than I found him. But it's okay I won't make a big deal out of it (says a Yelp reviewer; I cannot be trusted).  I have given my thoughts on my rubric, but I have not had the chance to check out the bathroom. I usually enjoy describing a restaurant's restroom because a clean restroom shows a restaurant has pride and good work ethics. Maybe I'm just OCD idk.  WHY THREE STARS THO? YOU ENJOYED THE COOKIE!!!  The main reasons were service, wait time, cleanliness and price. For a glass of milk and the pizookie full size its 10.32 and a 15% tip is 1.42 making the total $11.74 which is a bit much for only being able to finish half of the pizookie. Maybe even less than half. I feel a bit jipped off at least for what I paid. Then again the server did say they had a mini pizookie for like $3.XX I should have just gone for that one.  The service was good enough, but no efforts to make me feel ""special"" or give me a memorable experience were attempted. Not sure how happy the workers are here. I don't blame them though, I hate customer service myself. Yelp is cool tho cuz I get to be that anal customer reviewing stuff lmao. I mentioned the table not being clean earlier, and the wait time was slightly longer than ideal.  If I wanted to be nice I would rate this a 4 star, but trying to look at this review as corporately as possible they might rate itna 3 star. Personally I guess I would say it's a 4 star, but I'm trying to give an unbiased opinion.  That was my review you made it this far and you deserve something great like 10% off your next BJs visit or something. Unfortunately I cannot grant that request so I hope my thanks is good enough. Thank you for reading this review, see ya next time! Steve Carney Amatuer Yelp Critic"
Saachi G.,"Fremont, CA",483,213,3128,4.0,1/19/2017,"Adding a star for the great service we received last night. I was able to put our group on the preferred wait list so when we arrived we were immediately seated. We asked for a booth and were given one. Our server Jonathan was very helpful all night, a step up from service we have had in the past. He was very quick to bring our beers/drinks throughout our meal, which I really appreciated. Also, a big thank you to the manager for sorting out a bit of a coupon mishap we had. You and Jonathan definitely improved our experience as loyal customers at BJ's. Thank you for a great night."
Carlos C.,"Jardim San Leandro, Brazil",17,2,,2.0,11/23/2017,Nice place if you like cold half baked potatoes and unchewable asparagus. Long wait for meals to come out. Service was great.
Sara P.,"Fremont, CA",38,35,1,1.0,1/7/2018,"Terrible! We have used Grubhub twice from BJ's in the past two weeks.  The first time we got no ranch with our buffalo wings.  This last time (and yes, it is indeed the LAST time we order from BJ's), our order took almost 2 hours for to BJ's to prepare.  Unacceptable.  You can't cancel an order though Grubhub once it's been received by the restaurant.  BJ's accepted the order immediately, then turned around and waited almost two hours to get it ready.   I know for a fact it was prepared very late because the food was hot when we got it, so can't pin that on the Grubhub driver!  I ordered extra ranch for three orders of chicken buffalo bone-in wings.  We got zero ranch.  The chicken containers said on a typed sticker ""Extra Ranch"" but none were included.  To make matters worse the amount of buffalo hot sauce in the little containers was laughable, didn't cover two of the wings even.  Oh and when I spoke to Grubhub, BJ's gave us an insulting $1 credit on the $71 order for the missing ranch."
Christian C.,"Union City, CA",309,73,12,1.0,5/23/2017,"My sister and her husband were there this past weekend, ordered a pizza and received more toppings than they liked. When the pizza came out it appeared to have a huge chunk of cheese but at first it appeared to be a condom on top of the pizza, but it turned out to be a finger condom to cover up cuts and bandaids. None the less pretty gross, it's basically like finding a bandaid. I would be cautioned until the kitchen issues are resolved, my head chef would never let anything but food be served."
Sheila C.,"Union City, CA",139,296,495,2.0,12/7/2016,"Who goes to BJ's and doesn't get a pizookie?! I always try and save some space for dessert! There's a couple different kinds of pizzokie's you can get. There's also a trio but they're mini sized so they're good for first timers!  I've never really been a fan of BJ's. It's always too crowded even during the weekdays. Parking is something they need to really improve on. There's a ton of parking on the other side of BJ's but it's an inconvenience and during the weekends, that area can also get pretty packed.  The food isn't all that great. I used to love coming here only for their deep dish stuffed raviolis but they don't have it anymore :( they were so delicious!   What's really shocking about BJ's is that they microwave all their stuff including chicken and all. I honestly thought they were freshly made. Don't think I'd come back again unless it was some kind of event."
Jim J.,"Naperville, IL",26,58,,2.0,11/2/2017,"The ambiance of this restaurant is nice, but the service is mediocre and the food falls way short. Came here for lunch, and started with the Avocado Eggrolls. They were kind of non-descript, with the texture consistency of baby food and flavor to match. Also had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad, which was rather limp, and had a weird mix of flavors that didn't really resemble chicken or barbecue. Both dishes were so over salted that the flavor essentially burned in my mouth. How do you screw up a salad?  Not impressed!"
carlotta b.,"Hayward, CA",17,6,5,2.0,11/6/2017,Take out is terrible I put the order in thirty minutes ago been waiting for ten minutes still no update and there's no one at the counter terrible service I say
Jessica R.,"Union City, CA",165,135,121,3.0,5/10/2017,"Been here many times and the food is the usual American menu. Food is alright. Sometimes it comes out cold. Pastas, burgers, pizzas, beer, liquor, etc. the only thing I think people actually go here for is the pazookies. Those are   if you have a sweet tooth. Calamari is delicious, nicely crispy! Service is usually pretty good when I come here so can't complain about that. Come here if you want dessert or some drinks."
Ying Bo C.,"Newark, CA",12,4,,1.0,10/1/2017,"We noticed waiters wearing some type of tablet for ordering.  My order was switched from Ziti to Chicken Alfredo.  Wife's side order was wrong.  They rushed my order out and under cooked the pasta.  My wife's prime rib was not seasoned at all.  She ate two bites and threw it away!  That's $24 in the trash!  So if you want to flush money down the drain, go to BJ's."
Laverne A.,"Daly City, CA",0,36,38,1.0,2/25/2017,"Before you read, could BJ's please give some recognition to our waitresses April. She was awesome.  Well, as most of the Yelpers on here talking about the host check in. That would also explain the 1 star. Come on BJ's invest some money into training these folks. They are front and center of your business. Such a shame.  Here's the email I sent corporate:  I put my party on the priority wait list. Upon check in was told that it was only 15 minutes. Checked in the 3 times with desk and lady kept saying we were next after we saw all these other people getting checked in. Finally had it and stood in front of lady until we were called to be seated. Waitresses, very nice lady named April took our order. Appetizers came out. Ordered stuffed mushrooms and a quarter was larger than the size of the mushroom. I have photos. Also ordered top sirloin with asparagus and mashed potatoes, asparagus ends not trimmed and still had dirt ends. I also have photos. Mashed potatoes, cold in the center. Told our waitresses but situation was beyond repair and completely frustrating. I will not be returning to any BJ's nor will I have my company have any functions there until this is addressed."
Marshal R.,"Fremont, CA",107,242,27,3.0,11/19/2016,"I want to love BJ's, I really do but within the last 2 years there's been so many issues. It almost doesn't even seem like it's this location. I've gone to other locations and experience the same kind of service and food issues. 4 out of my last 5 visits we've had trouble even getting a table. They'd give us a buzzer and then 45 mins later we have to inquire about where we were in line just to come and find out that they supposedly called for us but the buzzer didn't go off (we were at the bar while waiting). And many more cases like this. The wait staff is VERY hit or miss (at every location I've been to). The food comes out in a weird order at times, like getting your appetizer with your entree (what?). Kind of defeats the purpose of an appetizer. Reason for keeping it a 3*** is because the beer is always good. And like I said, some times you get a good waiter.... some times...."
d s.,"Orange County, CA",60,83,7,3.0,7/22/2017,"We had the chicken lettuce wrap, Deep Dish California and Mediterranean pizza, Monkey Bread dessert. Chicken lettuce wraps were really bad. They add alot of mushrooms, celery, chestnuts all topped with chips. Shredded carrots on the side with 2 sauces, horse radish and the other I couldnt tell. The whole dish tasted like a bad attempt to make Chinese chicken at home with extra salt. Gross. -1 And they did not give seperate plates for the appetizer, which is defintely short sightedness with the given appetizer. -1 Pizza was better - Mediterranean is always good. California supreme was just okay. Next time we will stick to BJs favorite and Mediterranean. +1 Dessert - Monkey Bread with ice cream. Its like a moist cinnabon with ice cream. +1 The food was prompt, despite it being full at 2pm on a Saturday. +1"
Tara K.,"Dallas, TX",0,30,1,4.0,8/17/2017,"BJ's hasn't let me down when it comes to great tasting food. I've tried a variety of their items: burgers, salads, pizookie, fish n chips, deep dish pizza, seafood, steak; they were all excellent! I love/hate that they have so many options, especially if you can't make up your mind about what you want! They truly have enough variety to satisfy any diet, so anyone complaining about that is just being picky. The atmosphere is great: pretty chill, clean, decent noise volume, space between your table and the next one over, and TVs on different stations. It's definitely my go-to place when it comes to grabbing quality lunch or dinner. If you eat here regularly, the rewards program is a bonus. It's always great getting credit towards your bill or a free item (we redeemed a triple chocolate mini pizookie with chocolate ice cream on it and OH. MY. GOD. Delicious and I hate chocolate.) -- if you have enough points. The staff is all right. The host/hostess at the front can sometimes be unenthused, which is weird since it's the first face you typically see when entering the restaurant. The waitstaff is somewhat attentive. I think they could work on watching drinks more. Often, it's a good 10 minutes before they notice an empty cup on the table and then another 5-ish for them to bring a refill. All in all, I haven't experienced anyone who is rude or negative in any way."
Phil P.,"Schaumburg, IL",52,170,,5.0,12/20/2016,"After checking in at our hotel down the street, my colleague and I wandered into BJ's for a late lunch.  We opted to sit at the high-tops in the bar area and were promptly greeted by our server (can't remember his name).  He gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, which is huge BTW, while he went to get our iced teas. I settled on the Salmon and Quinoa bowl, and my colleague had the grilled chicken.  Both of our entrees were awesome in size, quality, and flavor.  We left completely satisfied!"
Michelle D.,"San Jose, CA",15,96,13,2.0,6/21/2017,Typical chain restaurant- mediocre food and mediocre service. The waitress seemed like we were bothering her or something. It also took forever to get our check. The food was lukewarm and displayed messy and was not appetizing at all.
Suki M.,"Fremont, CA",157,159,567,4.0,4/23/2017,"Went back to BJ's for a quick bite after a long absence, ate in the bar area which is our M.O. since we like to watch sports, service was on point food was good for a bar & grille pizza and cauliflower tacos... the tacos are soooo good I hope they keep em!! But what happened to the wedge cut fries??!!!!! Why O Why would you get rid of them?!!!"
Michael B.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,30,11,1.0,5/28/2017,"I got there at 12:44 and checked in. Waiting for my fiancé got a kid who was in training who got me and her both water with lemon. My fiancé came in at 1:14. We placed our order at 1:20, in the back room was a graduation party going on. Which I believe is why the line was taking so long. Even the manager was bringing out the food walking right by us. We tried to get him to stop, but no go. And instead of anyone having the decency to say hat the kitchen is backed up, your order may take a minute or two longer.  Instead nothing was said to us. We ordered two different salads. But by 1:54 with a thirty minute wait for salad we got up and left. If you know you have a party ahead of time set yourself up for success verses pissing off a valued customer.  We used to dine with your company all the time but the last few visits have left us wanting.  Not a place to return for awhile. If at all."
Lauren F.,"Wilsonville, OR",407,386,600,2.0,9/29/2016,"Great location | Food, menu is good | Service isn't great $$ We went with my parents to have a late dinner and dessert at this BJ's. Usually we go to the BJ's in our area, Santa Rosa, when my parents come to visit. We weren't very happy with our experience here.  The location is good, it's next to the freeway, across from a major mall, and it has ample parking. Gas station is next to it too. Food and menu is pretty consistent since this is a chain. Sometime you'd be surprised though, but this time we didn't have anything to complain about.   It was the service that earned a 2-star review.  Shaen introduced herself and things were good.  But throughout the time of dining there, it just got more weird and strained... She wasn't as attentive as she could've been. Like, she'd check up on us, but my mom had to ask for extra sauce a couple of times, and when Shaen gave extra sauce, it wasn't the right one.  I understand it gets busy during weekends, but it's a tad bit weird if you hand us the check when we're finishing up our meal and haven't even received our dessert yet. (We had already put in our order for dessert too.) I think at that point she just wanted to be done with us. I mean, doesn't that make you feel rushed to finish? So, from the middle of our dining to handing back the credit card, there was this really strained interaction and feeling like 'ugh, I want to be done with you.' Would I come back here again? Probably not.  It's not the worse, but it's certainly not the best.  It was out of convenience we went because they were open late."
