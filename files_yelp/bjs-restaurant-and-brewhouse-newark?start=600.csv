Troy S.,"San Leandro, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/20/2015,"Called ahead of time to reserve a table, we get there and my name isn't on the list! How high are they? definitely not going back, hope the place burns to the ground :)"
Angela C.,"San Francisco, CA",27,108,37,4.0,8/8/2013,"This review is for MAX- the server.  He was so great!  I'm not going to get into the detail of the menu or drinks because I figure everyone has been to a BJs. Hopefully the management at this location review yelp! and give kudos to Max.  He was one of the best servers I have ever had wait on me...ever.  Such a sweet guy, pretty talky when we put our orders in but once we got our food he didn't bother us with the ""how'd everything turn out"" banter which I totally appreciate."
Dilip M.,"Milpitas, CA",0,22,6,4.0,1/20/2014,"We came here for the niners and Seahawks game. Our friends had reserved the table so finding seating wasn't a hassle at all. Food on the other hand was average. If you go during the happy hour esp during the game, make sure to order from the happy hour menu at the bar if you are looking for happy hour deals. Otherwise you will be charged full price, which we realized later.  Servers were very friendly but just overworked due to the game. Food is slightly on the expensive side. You end up paying 10 bucks for tiny boneless wings. Same with other appetizers."
Lawrence L.,"Millbrae, CA",362,489,2653,4.0,11/4/2010,"Been to BJ's plenty of times, but tonight was special!  We were here with some colleagues and the vibe was electric since the Giants were in the World Series, and this would be the game to take it all.  One of my friends got here a little early so we had prime seating with a great view of the main large flatscreen tv. A very different experience than I have ever had at a BJ's, since everyone was pretty much rooting for the same team, and cheering was not held back. Now for the food, we ordered their Best Beginnings appetizer sampler platter:  their avocado egg rolls were great, tortillas chips with spinach and cheese dip was nice, mozzarella sticks were gone before I could taste one (so they must have been good), and Santa Fe Rolls were my fave on the platter (yummy).  I ordered the chicken fried steak (as usual), and was satisfied...  I also tried their new Lightswitch Lager (clean and refreshing). Service was attentive, as they always kept our beer flowing.  Especially on a busy night like tonight. Great place to catch a game!  Go Giants!!!!!"
Karla g.,"Union City, CA",86,225,52,2.0,11/17/2012,"Bad service: Me: Id like a glass of wine and a glass of water please. BJs server: If I get you a glass of water, ill have to get the whole table a glass of water... Are you sure you want water?  Me: YES. Wow."
Lanie T.,"Hayward, CA",36,173,,2.0,8/20/2012,"First time last night. Maybe last time? Kudos for witnessing the staff in the VERY nice bathroom, cleaning. That's nice! Kudos for quick seating and polite service. Service was lacking. Our server was very sweet but quite confused. We ordered fried artichokes as appetizer. Another chick brought it and laid it down proudly...but it was stuffed mushrooms. No biggie. Here's my biggie: Proud Chick ARGUED about it. ""Isn't this what you ordered?"" Repeated in different words about five times. Listen, sweet cheeks. WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS. WE ORDERED ONE THING AND YOU BROUGHT ANOTHER. SO SHUT THE F UP AND BRING US WHAT WE ORDERED WITHOUT A HASSLE, OK? We ordered steaks with sides. One of my sides was green beans. When my order came, I counted: SEVEN string beans?  WTF???? I realize that corners need to be cut, but come on...STRING BEANS!!!!??? Give me 15 and I might be happy! Doesn't the meat cost you more than veggie's? And I realize this is a growing trend, but especially for venues that make you wait for your food....WHERE'S THE BREAD? We inquired and were grudgingly allotted two stale dinner rolls. BJ's! You're in NEWARK CA for godsakes! No view, no ambiance. Give us some damn bread, green beans and service! Not going back. Sorry. Nice people working there, really. But not worth the bucks! Oh, but I had one of their star cocktails--a peach something something. Really, quite good."
Robert H.,"Milpitas, CA",11,63,14,4.0,2/4/2013,"BJ's in Newark is tucked in at the 880 Mowry interchange, so eyes open or you will miss it. The parking is shared with a dead Mervyn's store and the lot is so chopped up that you don't want to navigate it while tipsy. Parking is somewhat of a problem for a brewhouse that pushes large and tiny glasses of beer. This place is busy all the time, so you'll be parking a fair distance from the entrance in the Swiss cheese parking lot. The fare in BJ's is tasty and the service was attentive and prompt when we went on Saturday afternoon. Seating is in booths or at tables and televisions showing sport events are spread all around. The food is of that saucy, cheese-filled, bready fried variety. It's similar to what you find at Yardhouse. There are very few plates on the menu with fewer than 1200 calories, and if you drink beer, well, maybe you should fast for a few days afterward. Even their light menu, which is maybe 6 items, hovers at 600 calories each. The Newark establishment is smaller than the one in Glendale, but the overall effect is the same--trendy high-cal food and fresh beer served in comfortable, stylish surroundings. One note: the paper napkins delivered with the food are cocktail-sized. Be sure to ask for table service and cloth napkins, unless you are intent on eating with your fingers."
Luigi H.,"San Francisco, CA",183,26,5,2.0,2/11/2013,"I've been to BJ's a few times and its always been 'okay'. Normally I dine in and the food comes out in good sized portion and the food is okay...maybe a 3 star level.  However, today I picked up a personal pizza for a friend and are you kidding me? I called the order in and the guy said it was enough for 1-2 people, but seriously, this thing is barely enough for 1 person. Maybe more for a kid. This thing was tiny! For $13 you're better off getting a Costco slice of pizza. I should of gotten the larger pizza but I assume that would have cost me over $20. No way worth what I paid.  I'm giving them 2 stars for staying open late and the staff is friendly but for today's experience was a huge turnoff."
Aaron W.,"Folsom, CA",5,18,1,4.0,1/12/2015,Pretty good beer and the food is always good.   Both the burgers and the deep dish pizzas are good.   But of course the pizookies are well worth the visit.
Corinne T.,"Fremont, CA",31,33,16,1.0,8/14/2012,"I got food poisoning from the Newark location in July 2012.  Got it from the shrimp...or it could have been the Southern Egg Rolls.  I've never had food poisoning before & man do I never want to experience that again.   Also,  HORRIBLE customer service...the lady manager with blonde hair is rude & not friendly.  I called there once to make a to go order for my whole company...they put me on hold three separate times for 30mins each time...I was pissed! Then I called back & asked for the manager...they put me on hold for another 30mins until I just hung up.  I called back at a later/not as busy time...spoke to the manager & she offered me a dessert if I wanted to come pick it up.  Nice...but no thanks...last thing I wanted to do is drop everything I was doing to drive to BJs for your f*ck up! ugh!"
Kurt M.,"San Francisco, CA",139,11,6,5.0,9/3/2014,"Sergio is awesome!!!!! I forgot my bj reward card and he was able to look me up by number!!! Also he was very fun, friendly, and entertaining! My food was hot and very delicious!! And beer was good and refreshing!"
Marcos G.,"Hayward, CA",7,2,1,5.0,2/9/2016,"The welcoming desk invited us kindly and with a bright mood. The waiters that assisted us were friendly and very flexible (as in they did what ever we asked). The presentation of the food was excellent and a work of art. The taste was even better than presentation with various flavors overwhelmed my tongue in the best way possible. With a hint of spice, my guacamole-bacon hamburger was built to perfection. My meal never fell apart when I lifted and bit it. For desert we got the trio. In the trio, we got the salted caramel, triple chocolate, and original. The Salted Caramel was my favorite for its flavor enhancing ingredients. The triple chocolate suppressed my chocolate craving from the whole week. The original was a sweet taste of the past, having a sweet, warm cookie under a nice cold vanilla ice cream warmed my coldest memories. With all these incredible perks overrun the fact that a pepper shaker loosened up and spilled a mountain on my siblings Parmesan Chicken. Overall it was a pleasant and fulfilling experience and will recommend to anyone who asks to have a relaxed evening and great food."
Valerie A.,"Oakland, CA",298,210,268,3.0,10/8/2012,"I went here this past weekend with a friend for drinks. Saturday nights, beware, it's PACKED! We luckily squeezed our way into the bar area. We were served by bartender Cory who was very fast and took care of us. The Giants vs. Reds Game 1 of the Division Series was on, and I was so happy so be front and center in from of the big screen. The crowd is loud and definitely folks who are seasoned drinkers. My friend and I ordered a flatbread and potato wedges to go with our drinks. The food is ok. It's bar food. I don't expect much. You need those carbs to hold down the drinks. What's nice is the alcohol selection and what they have on tap.  The bathrooms are nice, the floors are clean, and the service is fast. That's all I really need for a few drinks and something to snack on. It's much pricer that anywhere I usually go to watch a game or have drinks, but there isn't much in the tri-city area. Until next time, bottoms up!"
Maynard M.,"San Jose, CA",146,126,129,4.0,6/8/2011,"I've had BJ's before (mind outta the gutter) and I loved it, jk I didn't think much of it. I thought their food was too starchy and the closest one was in South San Jose.  I still didn't bother to check it out even though they opened one by my place. The only reason I checked it out was all the FB posts of the pazookie. Pros -pazookies -good selection of beers -lettuce wraps -clean Cons -wait time, place gets really packed.  I guess Fremont loves their BJ's -doughy pizza -happy hour aint really happy hour with their limited specials and only discount like a buck off drinks"
Sunil R.,"San Francisco, CA",708,2322,12,4.0,8/3/2010,"Woohoo!! This place is legit and my new favorite American food, sports bar in the East Bay. Very nicely done, the set up and colors remind me of P.F Changs. The service was great, friendly and prompt. The drinks were very good too, from the mojitos to the martinis. The food was excellent and I liked everything we tried. The flatbreads, the deep dish pizza and the parmesan crusted chicken were delish. Dessert with the cookies and ice cream were yummy. Yes, the location is a little strange but I will be back."
Sheila P.,"Hayward, CA",25,75,9,3.0,10/5/2014,"I have to agree with many of the posts the food was delicious but the service was ridiculous. My partner and I waited over 25 minutes for anyone to address us after being seated. We actually had to go and ask who our server was. After being introduced to our server we ordered since we had ample time to review the menu, our server disappeared for another 20 minutes so we asked the manager to fulfill our drink order. Once the server returned he was very apologetic but we were over the experience and apologies close to tip time don't appease us. Three stars for the tasty food. We will not be going back due to the poor service."
Jennie S.,"San Francisco, CA",40,44,1,1.0,9/11/2013,"ONCE AGAIN AWFUL... Why did I give in and say ok to trying again. Wait an hour, get ONE drink...not two. then second drink comes out after food is almost done and the food was all wrong. Stop hiring shitty chefs . food made me sick. Threw up for the rest of the night . so pissed."
James B.,"Fremont, CA",0,16,2,3.0,1/28/2015,I really really like bjs and the food. The only thing is one time I came in for they're brunch because I was there the previous week and had seen and ad on the table about it so I went next week to go to brunch and no one was there so I was confused if they were doing it or what so me and my family stood at the door whiting to be helped and no one did of even offered and information just kept looking at us and walking by would of been nice if someone would at least acknowledged us but no one did so we went to ihop. But at night they have good service and good food.
Grace Y.,"San Jose, CA",1851,889,188,3.0,6/10/2010,"Every single thing I've had here has been absolutely delish! I would probably eat here more if: 1. It was closer to me. 2. If the wait wasn't absolutely ridiculous at all times. 3. If they took reservations seriously, instead of whatever list they do that doesn't save you any time but makes you feel like you were saved a spot.  4. Their service was reasonable...even below average would be fine...but it's horribly slow and they forget everything so if you're picky, you're kind of out of luck.  5. Their to-go wasn't so slow and they stopped forgetting things all the time and then tried to give me ice cream to make up for their mistake when I catch it.  6.Cheaper food.  Food is on the pricier side for this type of chain joint. You can definitely eat cheap here if you share.  7. If it wasn't so crowded and loud. There's nowhere to stand if you're waiting, and the bar area is always full. Also, there's always a birthday celebration or two and they get kind of crazy sometimes. The food is delicious, so I will be back to stuff my face."
Lisa C.,"San Leandro, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/1/2014,Service here was terrible. Waited an hour for our food. The waitress had an attitude and had horrible customer service. Drinks were way too sweet and also took forever to get. Will never go there again!!
