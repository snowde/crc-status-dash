Albert C.,"Milpitas, CA",9,16,5,1.0,3/23/2014,"Absolutely disappointing. Decided to give them a few tries before writing my report but after giving them the benefit of the doubt a total of four times, I can easily say they have failed to redeem themselves, and in fact, worsened in quality each and every time. The first time I came here with a friend the wait was alright. Maybe 10-15 minutes, which is quite understandable. I ordered a jalapeno burger with the patty cooked rare. I cannot say how long I waited for the food because I was engaged with conversation with my friend, so I will not comment on it just yet. However when the burger did arrive, my hopeful expectations for a rare juicy beef patty were shot down by a well done. Now I have made my own burger patties before, I can easily say...rare does not take a lot of work at all. When someone is willing to eat their meat rare, please understand that they mean it. Anyways, I told the server the issue, and although they offered to take it back, I declined. Why? Because 1) we had a movie to catch, and 2) I simply don't like wasting food. Ate it, disappointed and disgruntled, but still, tipped our server 15% simply because it was not his fault, and he took the appropriate actions to correct this mistake. Second and third was I was here with co-workers on lunch break. Lunch rush wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately. However our server was harder to get a hold of than the metaphorical needle in a haystack. He sat us down, told us he would be back to take our orders shortly. Our timeline was we arrived at BJ's at 12:00PM on the dot. We did have have our orders taken until 12:20. I did not dare order the burgers again this time. Instead I got the simpler lunch special, sandwich and soup with a side of fries. Much less disappointing as I see less of a chance to screw up a sandwich, soup and fries. However they did give me wedge cut when I wanted thin and crispy fries. Whatever, not a big deal. (At this point I feel the cost is not worth the food) Now today (March 22, 2014) my friend suggests we get BJ's. I wanted black bear, but my friend wanted drinks, so fine...We wait half an hour to have our pager start buzzing. That was once again, understandable and expected due to it being dinner rush. We are seated and we are given time to order. I order the Ahi Poke as an appetizer and decide to give the burgers another chance. Same order. Rare and thin crisp fries. I even told the waiter to make sure it is rare because they messed up the last time. He assured me it would be what I ordered. We waited about 20 minutes for our food. Shorter wait time I suppose. Got the burger, and it is ******* well done again. Not even slightly pink. It is browned in the center! I tell the server, and this time I have it sent back. It takes them another half an hour to get me another burger.  Now I am not saying I am more important than the other patrons of the restaurant, when a customer comes in saying his order was messed up before, and he orders the same thing, only to have the same mistake again. You would expect there would be better communication between the workers, and that the customers service may be just a little faster. If I wanted to wait around in stuffy building for half an hour to be seated, and another half hour to be disappointed, and then the next half hour to be starving, without food, brooding, watching other people eat, and just be out right PISSED, I can do that in the COMFORT OF MY OWN HOME! I can easily just NOT COOK DINNER, AND WATCH FOOD NETWORK, WHERE A REAL CHEF COOKS FOOD AND ENJOYS WHAT HES EATING. I told the server to simply just put the burger To-Go as soon as it finishes, give me my check immediately, I just want to pay, and leave.  This place is absolutely terrible. Never again. I'm telling my coworkers to never come back here again. My friends no longer have a say in where we are going if they suggest FREMONT BJ's. I have never been so upset with both SERVICE, and FOOD. BJ's you guys suck. Yeah maybe you didn't f*ck up my sandwich, but hell if I am paying you guys a cent for half a sandwich, let alone 9 dollars and tip. I'm going to Togo's or Subway. Cheaper, faster, and not full of FUCK UPS."
Brandy D.,"Mountain View, CA",8,58,75,2.0,8/14/2012,"We gathered for a friend's birthday on Saturday August 4th. We had called ahead to arrange a party of 10 to be arriving at 7:30 pm. When we arrived, the young gentleman at the front desk was not very nice. He said sorry, we don't have any record of a phone call saying you were coming with a large party.  He said sorry, you will have to wait 45 minutes to an hour.  We waited, finally were seated.  The food was good. The service was ok, (we always had to flag someone down for a drink refill)... the front desk was terrible. Both female and male hosts were rude and very unprofessional. Terrible customer service. This BJ's gets two stars: one for actually seating us within the hour, and a second for delivering our food on time."
Robb J.,"Hayward, CA",72,143,263,3.0,8/2/2013,"Great place to celebrate some accomplishment or birthday at this place. Nothing really bad to say about this location, good clean atmosphere. Have to have a pizookie (cookie with ice cream on top) for desert!"
Valerie L.,"San Francisco, CA",422,35,43,3.0,12/7/2012,"Had the 2 for $20 deal here. Comes with 2 soup or salads, medium pizza, and a pizookie. Medium pizza can be customized to order, which was a huge perk, because for about a few dollars less, my friend and I were going to get just a medium deep dish. Instead, we got salads and dessert to go along with it! Pizza was just alright...wasn't hot enough. I like my cheese to be stringy and messy to separate. However, the dough they use is always amazing and flavorful. I tried the Irish Pear beer on a whim, and didn't regret it. It's extremely light and not too fruity.  Try to seat yourself at the bar to avoid hour long waits for tables, if you're with 1 or 2 people. Service is quick and friendly."
Marshall M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,76,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Maybe they have great burgers? Maybe their beer is to die for? Who knows. We just wanted some pizza. Their menu said they have deep dish, so bring it on! It was awful. Your taste buds will be begging you for Little Ceaser's after you try eating this tasteless pizza, with uneven toppings, and practically no sauce. This is the worst pizza I've ever had. It was just horrendous."
Oscar H.,"San Francisco, CA",12,58,50,4.0,7/29/2011,"Been to a couple BJ's, including this one when it first opened, but usually just for beers. This time I actually tried some of the food. We waited about half an hour to be seated. The place was packed and noisy, but not too crazy.  Started off with a glass of Jeremiah Red. No need to say anything here, their beers are always on point and Jeremiah Red is my brew of choice. For appetizers, we ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and 2 Mini Chicken Tacos. Both were good, but the stuffed mushrooms stole the show. Definitely recommend those to start your dinner right. Then I didn't really want anything too big so I had the Grilled Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza. It was alright. For some reason I enjoyed the first two dishes more. Although the wait was kinda long I wouldn't mind coming back to try some other food on another occassion."
Angelica P.,"Fremont, CA",407,166,396,2.0,9/17/2010,"Been here twice with my brother. The only reason why we came here is because this is one of the few places open in our area when he gets off work (10:30pm).  First time we came around 11pm. We didn't realize that the dining room closes at 11pm and the only place we can sit is at the bar. Then, we found out that the only thing you can order after 11pm is appetizers and pizzas. The first time we came we were frustrated that none of this was mentioned on their website. So, we just ordered a mini pepperoni and had it to-go. We brought a 5 year old with us so we didn't want to sit by the bar. The second time we came was a little better since we knew what to expect. This time it was just me and my brother so we sat down and ordered an appetizer combo and a mini Mediterranean to share. The service was ok and the food was ok. The food wasn't bad....it was just blah. Nothing stood out for my taste buds..but it was edible."
Khaled A.,"Castro Valley, CA",6,109,22,4.0,6/7/2013,"I don't eat burgers too often, but whenever I go to BJ, I always get a burger and fries. The burger are delicious and pretty big. The only complaint I have is, the chef never makes by burgers properly the first time, its always done perfectly the second time. I ordered my burger medium rare, but it was cooked well. Even though the chef made a mistake, he/she always come out and personally serve the burger to you and make sure it up to your standards. Overall, considering this is a chain restaurant, there food (atleast the burgers), are excellent, unlike some other places um um um Pyramids (there food has gone down the toilet and their prices have gone sky high)."
Steph C.,"Newark, CA",0,8,6,2.0,1/29/2016,"Okay, so I'm not the type to complain. But this really bothered me. BJs is my favorite restaurant. I come here a lot i think, and sometimes the service is not the best but I never really care because the food is bomb! Yesterday i ordered my first deep dish pizza! i got a mini. Our waitress was really nice! She was a filipina girl I think? (sorry if I'm wrong) and she had some bomb ass lashes on lol. But that's besides the point. lol..anyways I get my pizza and bite into it. Literally, first bite. I look down as i'm chewing and see a huge black hair on my white scarf. i'm like what the hell (I have medium brown hair) and i start to pull it off my scarf and i feel it tugging in my mouth! YES! a hair was cooked into my pizza. I was so grossed out lol. I tried my best to be nice about the situation because I hate rude people. I told our waitress that I felt bad but i was grossed out. She took my pizza and got me a new one really fast! which was awesome but I kind of lost my appetite at this point :( they only discounted the pizza and charged me for everything else which is why i'm writing this review. Really bjs? could of atleast just took my drink and pizookie off too -__- whatever. I'll be back again probably but i'm not gonna be coming as often. Shout out the waitress though she was nice, wish i got her name to give her some credit!"
Melissa B.,"San Antonio, TX",102,14,13,4.0,11/18/2014,This was a really good choice for dinner.  We had a party of 7 and were seated right away.  Food was really good. The waitress we had was amazing.  She made sure our drinks were filled without hesitation and we had everything we needed. They have military discounts and really awesome kid programs to earn free meals.  Definitely going back to this particular location.
Cynthia V.,"Oakland, CA",102,95,37,2.0,11/2/2012,"Good vibe, decent food.  Love the home brews.  Wait staff was very helpful and attentive. Ladies - skip the heels when stopping by here.  It's an embarrassing trip to your behind just waiting to happen!  Seriously, lay off the wax BJ's!,"
Dave A.,"Fremont, CA",22,91,16,4.0,5/22/2013,"Service: about the same as you would find in any big restaurant chain, its better then your average.  Food: now this is where they are above the rest, quality product with good prices.  Must try : jalapeño Burgers"
Mary K.,"Silver Spring, MD",72,92,2,3.0,7/27/2012,"I would have given them a better review if I was just basing the experience on days I would just sit in the bar over a couple of drinks, but on one occasion it was pretty much one disaster over the other.  RESERVATIONS---My immediate family is big, which is why we usually opt for call ahead seating. My sister called when they opened letting them know that we would be there. We all arrive 15 minutes prior to our reservation and they let us know that they had us on the list, but took us off because the girl who took it down did everything wrong. Told us we would have to wait an additional hour 15 minutes for seating (It was Father's day and the last game of the basketball series). Pretty :( , but went with it anyways. My sister decided to stay with the pager, while the rest of us headed out to Lion Super Market to shop around to kill time...Come on 1 hour 15 minutes ridiculous!!!! (According to the other reviews, this isn't a new issue) DROPPED PIZZA; Blagh STEAK:Since the game was over, things slowed down a bit. We were able to put in our order and ordered two of their steaks, a steak salad and an XL wheat crust pizza have buffalo chicken and cheeseburger. The order came, the steaks were over cooked, my mom's steak salad had only about 3 pieces of steak and a scant handful of mixed greens. The ended up giving us a small pizza and a medium pizza since they ran out of the XL wheat crust...except they dropped the medium pizza on the floor. They offered to replace it. My sisters and I ended up sharing the small pizza (4 of us). By the time the replacement pizza came in, we were already done with our meal.  REPLACEMENT PIZZA: So they end up making us a replacement pizza; that shit was burnt and they still expected us to eat it, The bottom was charred and honestly we didn't want to eat it and were already full with what we had. We told the waitress who notified the manager and he saw how burnt it was, he offered to replace it again. We could careless, so he offered to take it off our bill.  I understand that it was a busy day, but in general I was pretty much disappointed with the rushed service, missed orders, and the burnt pizza (come on, you drop our pizza and then replace it with a burnt one?! How does that make any sense. I used to love going to BJs in La Jolla, but this one not so much. Left a good tip anyways since they tried..or tried to try"
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,127,21,4.0,1/25/2011,"I eat at this BJ's way too often. Pretty much every time we have an event with friends we always decide to eat at BJ's.  We like to dress up and go out and eat with  the girls, so it's a nice place to dress semi-formal and not have people just stare at you weird for wearing a dress . Again, I always get the half rack ribs here, unless I'm really hungry then I might go for a whole rack ;)  BUT the best part has to be the pazookie. You can't leave without getting one and I recently realized they had white chocolate ones ! gah was I missing out ! The waiters/waitresses are all really friendly too and always greeting you with a smile, and it makes you feel good , better then having a cranky waiter that's for sure.  Wait lines , might be a tad bit long during fridays and weekends, but it usually goes by pretty fast ."
Alberto S.,"San Leandro, CA",132,6,5,1.0,5/21/2012,"Came in here with my girlfriend after she gets off and work and the wait was only 20 minutes and that wasnt that bad Once we sat down we were pretty much ready to order and i ordered a simple small pepperoni pizza and she got a mini bbq chicken. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. I dont think it takes that long to bake a pizza. When the food finally came out it was cold and i could of easily held the pizza tray with my hand. Also my girlfriends bbq chicken looked like it got slumped on a plate and did not look good at all. We told our waitress who said she just got it out of the oven yet she was able to carry the obviously cold pizza tray with her hands. She said she would have them make us new ones. 30 more minutes go by and still nothing. We decided to give up, so we tell her nevermind just cancel our order and she gave us a dirty look. Instead of apologizing and going to check on our order she rudely said, ""okay,"" and walked away. Won't be coming back to this location again, i'd rather wait until the new one opens up in Pleasanton."
SG G.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,5.0,2/3/2016,"Good food, especially the pizza! Tried it once , and I am hooked. :)"
Jacki C.,"Newark, CA",24,76,5,4.0,8/17/2012,"DH and I come here often for an EARLY dinner and drinks.  I emphasize early because if you come during normal hours, whether on a weeknight or weekend, you are bound for a wait.  Therefore, we adopt the Sr Dinner Hr.  Not only do we not have to wait, we can partake in the happy hrs specials on drinks and appetizers.   Although they are known for their deep dish pizzas we mostly stick with the appetizers and small plates.  We normally get the seared ahi, stuffed 'shrooms, fried artichoke hearts, flatbread pizzas, etc.  Our favorite is the seared ahi tuna.  They don't have it on the menu anymore, but they will still make it for you if you ask. And of course beer, beer, beer, and maybe just one more beer.  They have a lot of beers to choose from and some nice seasonal drafts.  But don't get too hooked on their seasonal creations, because you will miss it when it goes away :( We mostly sit in the bar area and the servers there are always on top of their game!  We've noticed that the service in the main dining area is not always as good. Then before we leave, we normally leave with a mini pazookie!!! Yeah! This is dinner done right!!"
Ashley T.,"Newark, CA",10,10,1,1.0,5/1/2015,"I've always ordered the Santa Fe Salad here at Bjs and every single time I order it, it turns out delicious and they always give a good amount. But when I ordered it today, they gave me half of the original position and barley had any salad in it. I called to complain and the manager said to bring it back to see it. Once we got there, she accused us of eating it beforehand and said that's why the portions were so little. I never met a manager like her before, accusing the customer of eating half of it and returning it? I wouldn't have wasted my gas and sit in traffic to go all the way back to change it. She wasn't genuinely sorry about it, she just blamed us. I hope they can fix their customer service and management because it is unacceptable to treat customers like that."
Alexis Nicole B.,"Hayward, CA",62,11,4,4.0,8/24/2013,"I would honestly go back there again! It was a great experience. My friend and I were trying to find a place that sell desserts and was open late at night, when we stumbled upon BJ. The waiting time for the two of us on a Wednesday night was very short. To the point were they said they'll buzz for us and it only took one minute. Poor me, they didn't even give me enough time to go the bathroom. I know...tmi. But the waiter (his name i forgot) was simply amazing. He was very patient and kind and nice. My friend and i ordered two cookies 'n creme pizookie for kids (four- something dollars), a spicy meatball pizza for us to share(13.50), and two strawberry lemonade (free refills). It cost 28 dollars but it was 28 dollars well spent."
iPunchfish -.,"Campbell, CA",35,265,13,2.0,1/20/2013,"Schmoozed up by the TO-GO guy and ended up getting the Party Plus Plus dealio for 4 to 6.  40 minutes later we grab the food and run back to our friends house.  We find that the party plus pack is enough to feed 4 to 6 midgets.  Damn you, slick TO-GO guy."
