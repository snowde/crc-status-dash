Silvia R.,"Hayward, CA",28,72,65,2.0,5/24/2013,The food is great but the service is horrible! Our waitress only came around to take our order and never came back to check on us if we needed anything else. No waters and no ketchup for our fries and didn't get a chance to order more drinks. Noh and to top it off my boyfriend had to get up and go ask her for the check what kind of bs is this?  Extremely disappointed with the service we got today! Will def. Think twice before coming back to this place!
Beverly R.,"Fremont, CA",109,132,32,2.0,5/1/2012,"Yea, 2 stars is about right. 3 stars for the tiny stuffed mushroom appetizer, spongy deep dish pizza (um, it's suppose to have a crunchy base, and layers of sauce and toppings not a big fluffy disk of carbohydrates), and shirley temple with twice the amount of grenadine it should have had.   2 stars for my rude server who did not once actually plant himself in front of us (aside from when he was taking our order) to actually listen to our response or requests.  he literally walked by each time he had something to say.  He would chat it up with the family next to us and make sure their order was perfect.   I'm still not too sure what the reason behind that was since we are a presentable looking family that obviously can afford a place like BJ's and tip well (if deserved).  He was just not interested in serving us and eager to move on to the next table.   1 star for the long wait for our order.  Remember that table next to us that received the special attention?  They ordered about 5 minute after my party ordered but got their food 10 minutes before ours arrived.  From appetizer to entrees we waiting 45 minutes.  It's not like this is fine cuisine...it's BJ's for crying out loud!"
Seeking B.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/19/2016,horrible service checked in @12:30 waited till 4 to get food. yes we were party of 10 but there was absolutely zero service
Manju J.,"Fremont, CA",1,27,,2.0,7/20/2014,"Went there for lunch . Big mistake  They were busy with parties of 15-20 they forgot all about me, my friend and her son. The waitress was so slow and not attentive. It made me so mad by the time I got the food the taste of food didn't matter Food was ok but very greasy  Kids Mac n' cheese was very dry and my tomato bisque had oil floating in it !! Now I remember why I had not gone there in over 3 years!!"
Luis M.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/24/2016,Love BJ's but hate the fact that every time I come they have us waiting here for an hour and a half the least just to get us seated and some water served. Today we had to deal with a dumb ass manager named Gene or Jean that made us wait 45 mins because we had 5 people and not 6. What kind of dumb management is that. And she didn't even seem to care that we were mad. Zero stars if I could. Love the food but management pissed me off.
Gorlan L.,"Oakland, CA",31,1,,4.0,4/21/2014,Foods good the lemon chicken new dish is awesome please try. I asked for a booth but the host Calob sat me and my girlfriend at a tiny little table but i notice that he sat other tables of party of 2 at a booth that can fit at least 6 people. Also it was monday around 11 at night and it was not busy. So if you do come here and want to be seat where you want to please remind him 2-3 times so he can accurately seat you where you want to be seated.
Betty K.,"Newark, CA",23,56,82,5.0,10/21/2014,Cool environment! Great service...boozooki yay!!!!
Alan D.,"San Jose, CA",1144,418,320,5.0,7/29/2010,"Okay, so I ate at this place yesterday with my fellow Target Interns and it was a great meal! We had straw fries (delicious!) and these kettle chips with parmesan cheese it was awesome and amazing! I chose to eat the Cajun pasta which was spiced just right and had the right kick... OH and for once my chicken wasn't dry as a desert! But the reason why I really give this place 5 stars is because of the team they have here. I accidentally left my iPod touch on the chair after I finished eating (my dumb mistake) and realized it was missing but I didn't know where I left it! So began my journey of calling every place that I had been to and receiving a no answer and finally just deciding to call them this morning and bam! There it is! So I'm just glad that their team actually took the time to actually place it in the lost and found rather than taking it themselves... I've encountered that incident before it's not fun. So if you ever lose anything... lose it here, the team will take care of you!"
Bannister C.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",42,445,62,3.0,9/10/2014,"The food served here is without a doubt good tasting. It is the loud, uncomfortable, chaotic environment that takes its toll on you. Not a place to enjoy and relax and appreciate your meal. Perhaps the owner should hire an acoustic engineer to see how the noise can be attenuated. A shame it really is too loud inside."
Brian W.,"Fremont, CA",26,23,10,4.0,6/14/2013,"Pros: Great ambiance if you like a great social setting that doesn't feel overwhelming.            A plethora of choices to choose from.            Great seating if your lucky enough to get the crescent shaped booths            Pleasant Service Cons: A bit packed during busy hours (Call ahead to avoid the wait) I have been to several BJ's before and am OK in general with the franchise but I was pretty impressed with their Newark location. This particular location is by far the largest of the BJ's I have been to. The restaurant to me gave off a classic 1920's look with a contemporary edge. We called ahead to avoid a rather large wait time and got seats right away!  To start the night off right, my party ordered the  ""choose 8"" beer option. This gives you the chance to try 8 different beers. Its probably about 3 beers in total (double shooters) and really helps you learn what types of beers you like. We ordered the artichoke dip which was pretty good, not spectacular, but the beer made it just right.  Our meals were cooked well and fast. I ordered a spicy pasta which only tingled. But the flavor was good in general.  Our server and host were both extremely friendly and made us feel like we were VIP's which made the evening really memorable.  Overall, I would highly recommend this BJ's location. Great dining experience, too bad the food was just good not great."
Amy J.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",527,1758,161,3.0,7/12/2010,"This is the ONLY thing in this abandoned shopping center. They do have a good happy hour though I will admit. You can get half off a mini deep dish pizza from 3pm-7pm (I think those are the hours I could be wrong) or $2 off any appetizer. There might be a deal on the beers but I'm not sure. You can also get a free birthday sized Pizookie if you sign up for their email list. Not bad. The prices are ok. I think it's on par with most other chain restaurants. One thing I noticed this time around was there was an odd smell near the bar. It smelled like rotten cheese which made me think of going to a different location next time around. Maybe it was what the people behind me ordered, but it didn't make for a pleasant experience. Oh well, I got my food for a decent rate and a free dessert - I can't complain. Our servers were also really nice and attentive."
steven p.,"Clovis, CA",0,2,8,5.0,11/8/2015,Our server April was the best everything came out great. Beer was on point and food was good now just waiting on my pizookie
Avni A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",259,258,311,3.0,12/4/2012,"I've been to BJ's many times and I love the fact that they have so many options to choose from. I usually get their Spinach and Artichoke pizza and it is tasty. For appetizers, you can't go wrong with the avocado egg rolls. If your vegetarian, I'd avoid getting their Veggie burger and the giant baked potato, it's not that great. I think the chocolate chip pizookie or any other pizookie outshines all their food.  As far as service is concerned: when we got seated, no server came to our table for like 15 minutes. We had to grab another server and even then it took him 10 years to bring us our drinks.  Overall, the food is average but dessert is 4 stars. Good hangout spot."
Ram V.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Been here many times and the service is not the best. Today it has been pretty particularly bad. Had to wait for cheese and pepper for 20 mins and by the time we got it, we were done with the the pizza! Sorry - did not have a good experience!"
Eddie B.,"Fremont, CA",6,31,17,3.0,10/31/2014,I gave a 3 because while I love Bj's Restaurant because I always get high quality food. But my issue is this one location uses big tomatoes in their Tomato and Mozzarella salad and chops them in 4ths. Which means you get these huge pieces of tomato with a few little pieces of mozzarella. Every other franchise uses the cherry tomatoes and cuts them in half which makes them about the same size as the cheese. Told management last time and he agreed they were wrong.... Still no change so I will continue reviewing
Bubba G.,"Union City, CA",22,220,32,2.0,5/10/2013,"The lunch specials are worth it. Otherwise, the food is okay. You are really paying for the trendy atmosphere here. My kids love the pizookie. It is a cookie and ice cream dessert that is quite tasty!"
Jennifer N.,"San Jose, CA",7,13,4,4.0,5/2/2014,Great food. Five star service today but usually the service there is a 3 star or lower. Hopefully they keep it up! Happy hour menu should be better in my opinion if they want more business around the slow hours.
Josephine C.,"San Jose, CA",27,141,,4.0,6/11/2013,"3-stars for over place and food. Extra 1-star for superb service that my friends and I had received last night. Our server was attentive. My friends and I had  a slight issue with paying and so when we explained to our server what was going on, she took the extra couple of minutes to understand and make sure she got it correctly in terms of billing each person.  I got the chili and cheese giant stuffed potato. It was good; however, it tasted like it was boiled rather than baked. The size of the potato had gotten smaller from the last time I had ordered it. Plus, I should've asked for extra chili on it since there wasn't enough on it. Good for one really hungry person. Overall, this is our usual BJs restaurant like any other around the bay area."
Trung N.,"San Jose, CA",715,409,54,4.0,11/30/2010,"A very inviting and cozy environment that this location has. The decor is relaxed, and the service is above average compared to similar restaurants. Friendly service for sure, my group and I didn't have any problems with our waiter as he made sure we were taken care of. The food is delicious and is consistent with the other BJ's chains around. Definitely love their avocado egg rolls... and their root beer.. oh yes... it is a yummy, tasty non-alcoholic choice for a drink."
Nicole M.,"Fremont, CA",14,202,59,4.0,8/9/2014,"Best time to go here is during lunch time!  Lunch specials are a great deal and man i love their pizoookies! I always order their Chicken Tortilla Soup when here. Salads, appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and fried chicken is good here."
