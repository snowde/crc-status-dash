faith r.,"Milpitas, CA",66,7,4,1.0,4/25/2014,"In a nut shell: service was horrible and our waitress made us feel like we were just a nusance and it obviously looked like she didn't want to be there. Also, shady plating of food, if it doesn't look right be sure to ask or you might get stuck paying full price for half an appetizer. What are you trying to do bjs, rip off your late night customers?? If you want to read full detail Its below. I will never be coming to this location again.  Went here on Tuesday night at 11pm, a bit late but there were still plenty of people seated in the dining area and the bar. We were seated very fast and our waitress came rather promptly. Though a friend of ours went to the bathroom so we decided to wait a bit till he got back. We didn't see our waitress come back for at least 15-20 min. Though we saw her walk around, stand at the hostess stand talking with other coworkers, make eye contact with us (as we were trying to suggest we are ready to order) and just continue to walk by again. When she finally came she sounded a bit annoyed under her breath but tried to act nice, I ordered the little bites mac n cheese and my two friends ordered burgers. She quickly then left to put the order in but my friends thought of an appetizer so I suggested the spinach dip. We call her back over, looking even more annoyed she takes down the dip order and leaves. When the dip comes its literally half or maybe even a quarter of the size it usually is, and there was not one single whole chip among the bunch, they were just crumbs and a huge lettuce leaf taking up half the plate. I ask if this is how it comes or if they changed it. The runner said our waitress may have put in the ""happy hour"" portion and she would send our waitress over. Iv been to bjs many times and have never heard of a happy hour portion, and if there was the waitress should have specified.  All of a sudden a new dip was brought out, I suppose its because the first one was obviously a mistake. I ask for more chips since the ones brought out were just crumbs the runner says to me ""crumbs? "" with a puzzled look on his face. Do you not see what was brought out!?  It should have never left the kitchen like this in the first place. After that we finally when we see our waitress and she half heartedly apologized and said "" it's come out twice like this, the cooks must hate me"". Way to look professional and deflect the blame. We find out later a group of 4 had the same thing happened to them cause we can see them complaining to the same waitress we had. My guess is they only just gave each of us half portions expecting us not to catch on and charge us full price. It even took her a good 10-15 min to even get our check. My guess was, she was complaining about us to the manager cause he kept looking over. I do love bjs and go quite often but I will never come to this location if that is how im going to be treated. I get its almost the end of your shift,  you must be tired and want to just go home, but at least act like you give a damn."
Paula O.,"Fremont, CA",57,201,230,4.0,4/23/2012,Went on a Tuesday night with the BF. He had a pizza (their combo one) and i thought it was pretty good. I had the Grilled Pork with potatoes and green beans. It was one of their healthy items under 500 calories I think. I thought it was pretty tasty.  We will definitely go again.
Sumit S.,"San Francisco, CA",36,44,72,4.0,7/10/2012,"Never came here without an reservation and always left with sweet drunken memories. Don't know why people have given negative reviews, but I have always got a sweet and charming waitress. Always come here for a celebration or weekend get together with friends. Never disappointed with food, drinks or service. Even if we didn't like anything, waitress are more than happy to replace it with new. Thumbs up to BJ's :)"
Eric L.,"Fremont, CA",8,5,1,5.0,8/28/2013,"I had to make a Yelp account just to post this. Great food and great service! I have never been treated so well at any other restaurant! They really know how to make their customers feel special! Last night, my friend had a going-away party at this restaurant and he made the right choice, choosing this place. The staff treated all 16 of us really well. Our food came at a good time.  Since the night was really hectic my jalapeño burger ended up rare instead of the medium I ordered, as multiple jalapeño burgers were ordered at our table. The waiters empathized and went out of their way to give me a fresh burger and a free take home meal. It was delicious! They also helped us celebrate two birthdays at our table. Everyone went home happy and feeling like stars! If you are thinking of celebrating a special event or are looking for delicious food and service that makes you feel like a star, I recommend this BJ's to you!"
Steve H.,"Newark, CA",68,70,45,3.0,1/24/2012,"Most BJ's are pleasant. However, this one in particular lacks finesse. Put a little bit of effort in it please. You know that was coming, pause. Although there's a gang of people stopping by for a quickie during lunch, the wait is minimal since there's a lot of hands on the job ready to service you. My cousin and I shared the Avocado Eggrolls, Grilled Chicken Club with a cup of Clam Chowder, and a Pina Colada. Avocado Eggrolls - Crispy tubes stuffed deep with avocado. The sweet, sticky sauce on the side plays nicely with the eggrolls.   Grilled Chicken Club - Moist, succulent chicken breast topped with crispy bacon and smothered in a creamy garlic mayo. Arousing to the tastebuds. The shoestring fries that go with this dish were titillating. Clam Chowder - Slurping goodness but overly salty. Pina Colada - If you want to black out and not remember how you ended up in a stranger's bed then drink a few of these. Tasted nothing but liquor.  Don't expect a wild, mind blowing experience. This place is known to have it's up and downs. Stick with the beers and pizookie and you'll come out on top."
Araceli T.,"Fremont, CA",1,6,,2.0,12/2/2014,"The food is generally pretty good, but not good enough to make up for the exorbitantly long wait to receive it after ordering."
Stephanie D.,"Hayward, CA",87,3,,2.0,10/5/2015,"So we went out last night to eat here for my fiancés cousins birthday and I got to say the service was terrible. The food wasn't good and most things my fiancé asked they didn't have. I thought it was going to be really good to eat here but overall I didn't like the food. I ordered the pepperoni pizza and it had too much garlic! My fiancé ordered the clam chowder bowl and he said it tasted like it came out the can. We both didn't finish our meals. And to top it off we had asked for a birthday pazookie for his cousin in advance and didn't get it till and hour and half later. They said they hadn't made it yet. I think they just forgot cause when my sister told them again they said okay we will make it. They just gave it to him and that's it. I thought they had to put candle on it or something but no. So we didn't think much of it till 30 mins later we seen two employees give another customer a pazookie with a lit candle and they said ""enjoy!"" Not even us did they say anything. I was like are you kidding me! The worst service and also when I had said I didn't like the pizza the server rolled her eyes and mugged me. I was saying it nice so that they wouldn't think I was an annoying customer but it was the truth I did not like the pizza at all. I guess when you complain about the food they don't treat you right. Maybe I'll come back and try something different but this night was the worst! Didn't think it would be this bad. They took forever with our food and it was warm by the time it got to our table. Didn't know clam chowder took almost an hour to make if it was from a can. Idk about you but I hope they improve their service. I have never been treated his bad ever! Always a first time for everything"
Chris T.,"San Leandro, CA",0,36,6,4.0,10/17/2013,"The wife and I went a week ago and had the cheese burger pizza, chili soup and she had the tortilla soup.     Everything was excellent as well as the service by our waitperson ""Reanna"", You should totally ask for her if you go because she is sooo good I gave her a 20% tip!    The Final test is my dreaded Day After Test for the pizza, you know - In the fridge and reheated in the Oven at 350 for ten minutes, Still Fantastic!           Totally go and have some food and Remember - the BEER is Delicious!!!           Remember ""Reanna"" too!"
Jo C.,"Santa Clara, CA",10,125,169,4.0,8/13/2014,"Drinks were watered down. You can barely taste the alcohol. The server was somewhat attentive. We had our dishes piled up.  No one came to get them till my friend made eye contact with a busser, who didn't come to our table, he just stared at my friend. Sweet pig and barbecue chicken pizzas were excellent and we didn't have to wait long."
Kay A.,"Fremont, CA",42,156,102,4.0,5/4/2012,"BJ's is always a winning choice. The menu has a large variety of food, sure to please anyone. They have tons of homemade beer. The desserts are amazing!  My Favorite time to go is during lunch cause they have wicked good lunch specials.     Dinner time gets VERY crowded, but is generally worth the wait.    I love their Mediterrean pizza, salads, ahi tuna, pizookie, turkey cobb sandwich, and chili!"
Josie H.,"San Francisco, CA",253,573,13,3.0,9/10/2010,"I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE. I ACCIDENTALLY SLIPPED AND THE TABLE NEXT TO ME LAUGHED AT ME:( Just kidding, I would come back here just for the pizookie! My family decided to come eat here: We got the mini hawaiian pizza- GOOD, I love this pizza!  small cheeseburger pizza,- it so salty, I don't understand why my sister would LOVE this one, but i guess if you're 18 and you like to eat, then try this one!  grilled chicken pasta- kinda of tasteless, mediocre.  and a chocolate chip pizookie- so SOOOO GOOD. I love their pizookies, even though I can really just bake a cookie at home and then put ice cream on it to save the 5.95 cents, but we are humans, and we tend to be lazy:) Our bill came out to be 57 dollars, hmmm, should have gotten sushi instead, but the pizookie was just soooooooo addicting for me!"
AP A.,"Alameda, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/24/2015,"Terrible service! We waited 1.5 hours for our food to be served. When delivered, food was cold and one entree was missing. The server when asked for why the delay, explained very very casually that they were missing a key ingredient and if I would like to substitute with something. Somehow the forgot to mention this during the 1.5 hours they made us wait. At this point everyone at the table had finished dinner. Very disappointed with the service. The food has still not arrived after servers just ""5 min"" to prepare comment. Server was not at all apologetic for the delay in food and missing the order. However the manager came by and was apologetic and hospitable and offered to pay for appetizers. Hence the 2 stars for his good hospitality."
Melissa M.,"Hayward, CA",160,46,299,4.0,4/1/2012,"Love this bj's! Ambiance is great and service is awesome... Place gets pretty packed, so I suggest u make reservations ahead of time. They accomodate big groups and I think  its awesome that our waitress here made no mistakes with our bill when we went. Atleast none that I cud remember, it was very hard to tell tho coz she pretty much got all of us drunk...... lol..... The food is good but I really love their fish tacos .. a must try!"
Phoebe T.,"San Jose, CA",362,491,606,2.0,3/15/2010,"Let me start off with I went here on Valentine day but completely forgot to write a review, so it was my 3 friends & I, let me start off with the host we had was a female & she was completely rude. My friends were already there & I came a bit late since I live in SJ & all & when I arrived, instead of asking politely what I would like to drink she was like ""What do you want?"", I was like ""WHAT?!"" cause I didn't think I heard her correctly & I was thinking to myself, ""oh uh uh, this girl is asking to get laid out or something"", but after she heard MY rude ""WHAT?!"", she ended up asking me in a forcefully nice kind of way of what I would like to drink. Nuh uh. Bish you effed with the wrong girl. Waitress or not; be a little bit more respectful please. If you give respect, you get respect! Anyways, other than that little dispute we ended up getting a different waiter because she was actually about to get off work when I got there (thank goodness), the waiter we got was pretty decent I guess.  Okay so food, I ordered the pasta with chicken & brocolli, it was decent. It wasn't as creamy as I hoped it would be. Both my friends got the deep dish pizza; they said it was delicious but the first pizza the manager came out & told us they accidently dropped the pizza when they were about to bring it out so they had to get another one done so we waited for like an extra 15 minutes for his (still charged us FULL price).  Overall, I don't think I would go back to this BJ's. As you can see why. I only gave it a 2 star because the service was very... Ahem, excuse me but SHITTY. But  the dessert (apple crisp) was delicious as well as the pizza. But yes, no Bj's at this spot for me! I'm sticking to the one in SJ!"
Raymund S.,"Newark, CA",100,202,168,2.0,1/1/2014,"I have been coming to this location for a couple of years, but now I really feel I need to comment on the service.  The quality of service has really declined and the last time I was here with a group, it was really bad.  Our orders were messed up and everything we individually asked for were not fulfilled.  Its like they were not even writing down on paper what we were ordering and everything came out in a default configuration.  My coworker specifically ordered  a wedge salad with anchovies, and he got potatoe wedges.  Really?? To make things worse, the last person in our party got her porkchops 20 minutes after everyone else got their food, and it was still messed up.  She asked for roasted potatoes and she got mashed.  She specifically asked for roasted.  The icing on the cake was when we were about to pay for our bill, a server comes out and asked if we got the red velvet pizookie? LMAO is this really happening?? The place was not busy at all and our 1 hour lunch turned into almost two hours.   The bill alone took 15 minutes to come out. What a shame, I hope the bar area isn't a big cluster f%*k as the seated areas."
Lisa D.,"Newark, CA",0,31,2,1.0,7/14/2012,"When a friend suggests we go to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery it makes me CRINGE. BJ's tries to trick you into believing that they're better than other local sports bars, grungy lounges, or late night restaurants. This is absolutely ludicrous thinking & a complete scam. Save your time, save your money, & stay away! I've had better service at Applebee's! BJ's has provided the most consistently horrible service I have ever experienced at a ""restaurant"". When BJ's first opened it never really appealed to me, but I went with my friend & some of the cast after a show. We arrived around 11:30 pm & were ignored for more than 5 minutes. Once acknowledged, we were told to ""hold on"" so they could check to see if they had seating. Finally, we get lead to a table in the far left corner which would've been great had my friend not been in a wheelchair.  After flagging down someone to see if another table was available, we were rudely left maneuvering around chatting associates blocking the ramp & interrupting at least 3 other parties to clear enough space for her to get by. The only idea we received from BJ's staff was, ""Well, do you think she could get down the stairs?"". Although the décor may be nice, the setup is abhorrent. Even a fully able-bodied person struggles to maneuver in BJ's. The night proceeded the way I've now come to expect of BJ's- drinks forgotten or mixed up; food forgotten; dirty cups, plates, utensils, table; pathetic excuse of a waitress who takes orders & never comes back (another associate told us our waitress had left). When I went to order food at 12:30, I was shocked to be told the grill was off for the night already!  I ordered a turkey sandwich & it was THE WORST sandwich I had ever had. For $10 I would expect deli-like quality, but this sandwich made even Subway look delicious. My sandwich consisted of two slices of toasted wheat bread slathered in mayo, a huge chunk of tomato, & about a half of a pound of pre-packaged sliced turkey. I wish I had waited until I got home, I could've made a better sandwich there. A couple months ago, my boyfriend & I went to BJ's for drinks around 11:45 pm on a Friday. Luckily, we came together & he was there to walk me through the dark seedy parking lot. We sat at the bar area & were talking when the waitress came over. We asked for a few minutes only to be bombarded for an order 2 more times in less than 5 minutes, with our impatient waitress snidely stating that, ""the bar is going to close soon"". Umm, excuse me? Aren't you open for another hour?? We ordered a round of drinks around 12 & called a friend to join us. He arrived about 12:15 & we ordered 6 more drinks in total & an entrée. Halfway through, our waitress appears & states she hadn't expected more people to come in after 11:30, so she had made plans & was taking off; at least she left us with a replacement. At 12:50 a manager approached us & told that, ""it's time for you young folks to get out, we're closed"". I was so taken back by this distasteful & disrespectful treatment. We were paying customers in the establishment during business hours & not being loud or rowdy. If it was 1:05 perhaps, I could understand a gentle reminder that they need to clean up or something. Utter rudeness, from a manager no less, definite mood killer. Last night my boyfriend & I were looking for late night grubbing. We could've gotten elsewhere, but for some unknown reason I thought going to BJ's would be a good idea. It was 12:15 pm, so I called in to inquire what time they planned to turn off the grill. I SPOKE WITH ASSOCIATE CHRIS who put the phone down to CHECK WITH A MANAGER & told me as long as I am in the establishment & have me order in by 1, they will honor it. All I can say is BULL SHIT! My boyfriend arrived at 12:45 pm prepared to be seated & order for us both as I would be a few minutes behind him. THEY REFUSED TO SEAT HIM! I arrived shortly after 12:50 pm to find myself locked out with a smug looking manager leaning on the door. I was LIVID!!! Why say you're open until 1 am, but then do everything you can to deny customers?! If you close at 1 am, that implies that your associates leave at 1:15 at the earliest not at 1 like your patrons should be!  My boyfriend had placed a to-go order (minus the alcohol of course) & after calling him from the locked door & screaming at the manager through the glass, my boyfriend convinced him to let me in. I was sooo angry & making a bit of a scene, yet not once did any associate approach me to try to remedy the situation or understand my side. I had done my part & still got screwed by BJ's management again! I would never recommend BJ's to anyone! After everything, the food wasn't even that good. I could get the same caliber food at Red Robin at a lower cost, & maybe even TGI Fridays or Applebee's. I hope management reads this, because they ought to be ashamed of how they treat patrons in their establishment. Heed my warning- save your time & money- STAY AWAY!"
Shell I.,"Union City, CA",111,94,88,2.0,8/15/2012,"Definitely not one of my favs.  If I have a choice, I usually go with the alternative to BJ's. Over the weekend, I ended up here again because my cousin really wanted to come here. We came for lunch. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and my cousin the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I didn't care for either of them.  I find their food to be too salty and untasty, which is why I try to steer cleer of this place, and this occassion was no different. My quesadilla was oily on top and with the first bite I got lots of salt.   However, I did enjoy the fried mozzarella sticks.  This place is best for groups coming to drink and watch TV. For meals.....there are sooo many better options :)"
Stephanie G.,"Fremont, CA",155,425,566,4.0,10/12/2012,"Went here for a birthday celebration during happy hour. Love that the waiters/waitresses don't bug you when you just want to have a beer/appetizer. Wide variety of foods and beverages. I'm in love with the great white shark pizza, yummy! Tried the chicken wings this last time (just the plain ones) and they were tasty with my beer. I would definitely check this place out if you're looking for late night happy hour (after 10pm in the bar area)."
Linh N.,"Milpitas, CA",359,50,10,2.0,12/21/2011,"So my friends and I came here last night for a secret santa exchange and we normally go to restaurants in big groups. Last night was the longest wait I ever had at any restaurant: approx 2 and a half hours. We were talking about going to another restaurant but since they gave us our estimated wait time as one and a half hour we decided to wait it out. In hindsight, we would've gone to another restaurant if we knew we were going to wait that long.  There was a lot of confusion as to where they were going to seat us. After waiting for that long, they were still about to seat our group separately. We finally all got a table together in the end after all the confusion though.  Be warned, DO NOT WEAR HIGH HEELS THERE UNLESS YOU LIKE FALLING. The floors there are incredibly slippery and dangerous to women with stilettos. I needed my friend to walk me around just to risk not injuring myself.  After the long wait, my friends and I finally received our food but after digging in we decided that the wait was not nearly worth it. I got the angel hair toscana and it was just an okay dish, the noodles were bland. My friend ordered the tilapia and she wasn't really satisfied with her dish either. The only thing that anyone really liked that evening were the pazookis.  Even the pazookis were hard to order because the waitresses and waiters barely paid attention to us and never cared to check up on us; it was nearly impossible to to get their attention. There also seems to be a lack of communication between the waiters since we got two pazookis when we only ordered one; we took the extra one anyways though. Summary: my friends and I should've gone to olive garden instead."
Sonia K.,"Newark, CA",6,9,4,1.0,8/20/2014,Service is super slow ! I work in the food industry and having your hair down while serving food not OKAY a table next too me just complained of having a long string of hair in their food ! Your hair should be up in a pony tail or in a bun not down ! I understand your trying to attract customers but you can do it with your hair up ! And customers won't have hair in there food ! This definitely needs to be discussed with the manager ! Smh get it together . RIDICULOUS.
