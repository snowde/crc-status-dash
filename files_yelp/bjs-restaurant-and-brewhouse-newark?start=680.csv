Uyen V.,"Hayward, CA",106,11,197,1.0,11/6/2011,"This is not the first time I've ever eaten at BJ's. I've actually been here tons of times. But tonight pissed me off enough to actually write a review. Let's start off with the little bit of good the night had to offer. The food is always decent. They forget a couple of things here and there, that's fine, its a busy place. Our waitress/waiter always brings it out later. Usually super friendly staff. We wanted a booth, but they gave us a table so asked if we could wait for the booth and they obliged. We waited FOREVER. The girl at the front desk was too busy texting and looking at her nails to really pay attention. She offered us two separate booths at the bar. Wtf? We are ONE party. Why would we sit at a loud ass bar, at two separate booths.  Luckily her coworker sees a booth open up and points it out and directs us to it. That girl deserves 5 stars, but our waitress fucked that up. So on to the best part of the night. Our waitress Jessica. If I could take a picture of her to warn all other patrons I would. Let's be frank, the girl shouldn't work in this industry if she hates her job so much. We sat down, she came over and asked what drinks we would like to start off with, I asked if I could order the appetizers, she ignores me and asks my friend at the end of the table what he'd like to drink. When she gets to me, she asks me, ""The great beginnings right?"" with so much attitude that I almost  said no and got up and left. After that, she brings us out our food. I had a midori sour and my friend took a sip. I can understand you have to card everyone, but you can talk to people like they're actual people. My friend didn't have ID on her so Jessica very rudely said ""DON'T SIP THAT ANYMORE.""  Um okay. Understandable. You're doing your job. But how about you don't need to be so fucking rude. Now for the topping on the sundae. As we were finishing up our meal, she put the check on the table and KEPT checking on it. Uh, if it looks like we're not done, maybe, we aren't fucking done.  So we pay cash, bill is about $117, we pay about $121, fitting tip for shitty service in my opinion. I usually tip 10-15% so this was a low one for me, but I was pissed. As we were leaving, she yells at us ""Thanks for the 4$ tip, I worked my butt off"" Uh, what, the, fuck? I gotta give it to her for making sure she was a bitch the whole night through. Consistency is key right? Tried to leave a complaint,  but we were told that the general manager wouldn't be back til Wednesday. I hope he/she likes getting bitched out early in the morning."
Steve C.,"Fremont, CA",104,116,24,5.0,1/4/2013,"Ok, I have to give credit where credit is due! BJ's Brewery & Restaurant at their Newark/Fremont location has improved significantly. I don't know if they started listening to their Yelp reviews but I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at the quality of food and service. Their onsite management should be proud of taking a lackluster chain and turning it into something they should be proud of. We were invited to go for New Years Day and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was darn good. Now it wasn't has great as Val's Burgers in Hayward, but the combination of the Burger, Steak Fries, Full Bar and the exceptional service has given it a 5 star rating in my book. My entire table was raving about the meals and the service and all of us said ""We would be back"". I typically say, eat local, and I would recommend you go back and try BJ's again if you didn't have a good experience the first time."
Pratik D.,"Fremont, CA",37,16,,1.0,8/17/2014,Horribly slow service. We waited around 20 minutes for someone to come pick up check payment. Had to get up and walk to counter for payment. No apologies even after this incident from them. Would not return ever again.
Jenny N.,"Oakland, CA",600,471,331,3.0,9/14/2012,A chill place to drink beer and munch on appetizers. Love the happy hour times :) had to wait 30-45 for our pizza and when they brought it out.. It was cold and stale .. Complained. Got a new one. And got it for FREE :) so that was cool.
Maria A.,"Union City, CA",1,2,,5.0,9/7/2014,I have gone to a lot of BJ'S over the years but this one has given me the best experience in along time. Lance was our server and he was awesome. My order came out wrong but he fixed it and gave us two whole pizzas free of charge. The manager came out to apologize and was very nice. I would come here anytime.
Jennifer A.,"San Jose, CA",30,24,4,1.0,8/7/2014,Worst service ever!!! I don't know how new this bjs is or how crappy the managers are that they can't train their employees properly. I've been to many bjs. Northern and southern California and this has got to be the worst out of all of them. The waiter never came after we asked for a refill of water. My pizza was burnt and not pre cut it was a mission to even get a slice of pizza. I'm over this place. I would rather go to the blossom hill one and wait a lot longer than have to have service like this. Ridiculous. You pay for service this is definitely not the place to get that. I'll take my money elsewhere where they can refill my water after I ask for it and not half hour later. Or when my pizza is actually pre cut!
Cindy T.,"San Jose, CA",115,1120,468,4.0,10/8/2010,"I usually visit the BJ's in Cupertino or at Oakridge mall and this new location didn't disappoint.  Since parking is horrible at Cupertino and Oakridge, you won't have trouble finding a parking spot at this location because they are the only one in business in the plaza since Mervyn's has been closed for months.   This location is really nice, due to the fact that it is quite new.  The wait wasn't too bad for dinner on a Saturday.  Service and staff was on par.  This is an awesome place for accommodating huge groups (20+ people) because they have big dining rooms.   I love their buffalo chicken wings and their thai shrimp lettuce wraps are to die for! So yummy.  Their deep dish pizzas are quite delicious, too! Plus, they have pizoookies! Great spot to hang out and down brewskys."
Edward L.,"Milpitas, CA",143,18,393,3.0,7/18/2010,"Typical BJ's establishment. Great for parties, but be prepared to WAIT in long lines during dinner times. Reason for this is that there are very few BJ's up in NorCal.  On a saturday 6pm, took about 45 minutes. If you like alcohol, you can always wait at the bar. Don't forget it's a family restaurant, so only 3 shots an hour so you don't puke on a kid. Friendly SERVICE and decent food. Usually get the pizzas here, but honestly their pizza is similar to Pizza Hut. Deep dish pan pizza with lots of oil to make it crispy, which is my favorite type of pizza. Unfortunately it's also x2 the price of The Hut. You should come to BJs if you want to pay for the atmosphere and watch sports on the big screen. Food is typical of normal American family restaurants. Fun TRIVIA, this place is located in a plaza which consists of only a Mervyn's and a BJs. Lots of construction panels just plastered with EAT AT BJs. All the old stores here have closed. I'm guessing they moved across the street to the real plaza."
Keeper K.,"Milpitas, CA",0,14,7,1.0,3/22/2014,"Spouse's birthday and was forced to go there against my wishes. Horrible service even per BJ's standards. Missed the meal for my spouse while serving everyone else. My drink had a weird taste, desert never came and so on. Total Disaster. Hope that summarizes it."
Jessica P.,"Fremont, CA",96,3,25,5.0,8/24/2014,"5 stars ONLY with Maria. Otherwise all stars only for happy hour prices not service. Some guy is usually running around the floor, he works hard and I don't blame him, it's staffing. Except the time he was serving my friends and was absolutely rude; so  hassled he gave water and never came back and then told them off... Seriously not THIER fault but I'm trying to be nice... But Maria is the only good server I've ever had... Food is consistent and good just not exceptional"
Adam S.,"San Ramon, CA",1,32,4,1.0,9/17/2014,I went here on 9 13 2014.  My date and I ordered the calarme.  It was so bad we both got sick at the same time.   We spoke with the manager and after fighting with him he removed the appetizer.     This was a let down.   I and my friends family and Co workers will hear the nightmare my date and I had.   Come on guys we spend on average 60 dollars when we visit.   You really think a 10 dollar plate is worth a terrible customer experience.   With so many options why fight the customer?
Jenny M.,"San Leandro, CA",38,33,3,3.0,5/24/2013,I only come here for their selection of beers. I love Gulden Drak  Food is ok
Laura B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,,5.0,10/14/2014,"My husband and I decided to stop at BJs for dinner while on vacation. Our server Taylor, brought our drinks to us right away- I couldn't make a decision what I wanted off of the menu, so Taylor recommended the grilled chicken pasta and it was absolutely delicious. Good choice!! She checked on us attentively and we finished our dinner off with a pizookie. Yum. Thanks again!"
Malinda R.,"Hayward, CA",40,47,76,2.0,7/20/2014,"Food wasn't worth the price. Nice staff, but all of my silverware and plates were dirty. We went to a BJ in Oregon state and it was great. But I will never return here again. $60 wad too much. They replaced the silverware with more dirty silverware, I cleaned them in the ice water before I used them."
Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",485,786,1873,4.0,12/30/2011,BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse combines new American cuisines with several other different cultures. They are known for there beers and there appetizers are simple delicious. If its your birthday they give you a free piziooke. Pros Atmosphere: The area itself is large and open so you don't feel at all cramped inside a restaurant. The perimeter of the restaurant is surrounded by flat screen tv's showing sport shows to give it a sports bar feel. The added decorations and coloration of the restaurant adds a nice touch as well.  Food: The food tasted pretty good with a large variety to choose from. They also have a large selection of alcoholic drinks as well to go nicely with an appetizer.  Birthdays: They give you a free pazooki on your birthday so come by if you want something free for your birthday.  Parking: The parking for this place is huge so parking is simple.  Location: its located near other shopping strips and food area so a prime place to go grab food and do a little shopping as well.  Cons Crowded: It gets pretty crowded here during prime time around 7:00 PM. Wait time is usually 30 to 45 minutes during peak hours.  Price: The pricing of the food seems a little off. The quality of the food compared to the price your paying for it doesn't seem to add up. The food is good but not necessarily worth the price. Overall this BJ's on Mowry is a nice place to dine out. The large parking with good food quality is great. Come before the peak hours to avoid the crowd and you'll find it a pretty good spot to dine out.
Audra M.,"East Bay, CA",47,383,538,5.0,2/3/2012,"I have to give this location 5 stars for their great service. We have been there twice in the last month and both times we were greeted by friendly people and our waiters were both excellent.  The place is always I mean ALWAYS crowded, but the waiters still treat you like your their only customer.  The food is great, I haven't had any issues with the food. But my 5 stars is for their excellent customer service."
marie t.,"Newark, CA",1,26,24,1.0,8/15/2015,"Sat for 15 minutes while watching the staff argue about who is supposed to serve us.  No water or drinks just menus from the hostess. Amazing, one girl just stood around avoiding looking at us obviously not busy but not wanting to serve us.  Another waiter finally came by and tried to get us some service since it wasn't his station.  We come here once in awhile and it's not usually like this.  Disappointing!"
Tiffany B.,"Oakland, CA",54,14,4,4.0,6/21/2012,Wow was it worth the wait.... Tried going in LA... Had to wait over hr so we left. Found they had one near us... The service is on point!!! And the food was Soooo good. So many selections. The drink wasn't bad although they didn't have Ciroc which is why I'm giving them a 4. Will def be going back real soon to try something else. Also loved that there are tv's everywhere!!
Ranjeeta R.,"Fremont, CA",0,24,,1.0,12/22/2014,"If I could give less than 1, then I would have. Horrible, horrible service. Servers don't even bother clearing up dirty appetizer plates before serving the main course. Servers don't show up for long periods of time. I can't emphasize enough on how bad the service is now. It wasn't so the first year after it opened. Food was better then too. Fries are cold. Food that's no longer warm to barely warm gets served and honestly it doesn't even taste good like it used to anymore. Waste of time, energy and money to go to this restaurant now. Last few visits to this restaurant has been just terrible and I used to go almost weekly to this place in the past. Not anymore for sure. Don't waste your time and money at this place."
Dina I.,"Menifee, CA",5,27,13,2.0,5/29/2014,"No one greeted us.   The manager came by our table with an attitude.  The ""security"" is a creep that stands arounds being inappropriate and getting paid for it.  I usually love coming to this restaurant, but never again to this location!!!"
