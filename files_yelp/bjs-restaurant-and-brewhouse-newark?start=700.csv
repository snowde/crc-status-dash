Yogesh P.,"Fremont, CA",9,8,,5.0,4/1/2014,My best hangout place with my buddies. Beers beers beers and the hot wings. This place gets crowded all the time.
Ron O.,"Fremont, CA",50,20,1,3.0,4/20/2013,"Thus far, waited 30 minutes for a 15 minute wait. It seems call ahead doesn't do anything for you. Which is bad for me, because I have four hungry kids waiting to eat. Luckily, the food and service made the evening acceptable."
Richard L.,"San Leandro, CA",0,8,,2.0,3/29/2015,"Went to BJ's. (Not our first visit.)  Current wait staff, and kitchen staff need training and to pay attention to detail.  Will give another chance, but that is it.  It would be a shame if quality of service does not improve."
Gator R.,"Hayward, CA",1,36,2,2.0,12/25/2012,"One star would be a better rating but I'll be nice and give them two.  I ordered the pork chops lunch special ( in reality it should be called the pork ""chop"" special as I only received one lean baby size pork chop). It was accompanied by some greens that appeared to have been frozen for a long period of time as they were tasteless.  A few buddies ordered the personal pizzas. By their facial expressions, they were probably wondering if it was DiGiorno's.  Staff was friendly and drinks were poured in a timely manner.  I will only return to this BJs if taco bell is closed for renovations."
Jamie V.,"Milpitas, CA",12,62,72,4.0,11/7/2010,"They've got great food, especially desserts. I highly recommend the great white pizza and any pizookies (remember, you can ask to switch up the ice cream flavors). As for their service, I have yet to have any problems with any of the waiters. Looking to grab a drink? They don't have the greatest happy hour specials, but the drinks are okay."
Justin M.,"Newark, CA",2,18,,4.0,8/22/2014,"Food here is consistently good, my wife and I have celebrated a few anniversaries here. Not too pricey and great selection. of food and drinks. can get a bit crowded, so if you're looking g for a quiet evening I recommend take-out. If you aren't traveling far the food quality doesn't suffer at all, although you may have to wait longer than the quote time for your order."
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,3.0,12/12/2011,"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner.. with a 10pm reservation, you would think service would be attentive.. meh! B -- S -- Plenty of parking, all the stores in this area have closed (RIP Circuit City) -- Right off the freeway and across from Newpark mall -- Restaurant size: about average/same as other locations -- 2nd newest, Concord is the newest location -- NEW glutten-free options :) at all locations Once you've been to BJ's, they're all about the same with the exception of service. That's where they make or break themselves at these chain restaurants. So I don't deduct anything from BJ's given that I actually have had a good experience at all of the locations in the bay area and even in Sacramento. Food was the same, I was glad to have a calzone and a ceasar salad. I also ordered a glutten-free pizookie which is totally awesome! Definitely a great alternative to the normal options.  *House Salad (side note): I've always noticed that the house salads are trash which I mentioned to the server. She told me that they make them the night before and that's why they aren't that good. The caesar and other salads, however, are made fresh to order! So if you wonder why the house salads suck like I did, now you know! My biggest gripe with servers is lack of attention and filling up my damn water. I know it's a hard thing to ask for. We had a big party but I'm a thirsty guy and no water means no bueno for me. Otherwise our server was fine. Some of my party complained about her being rude, but I didn't really notice. I would still consider this location very convenient if I lived in the area and if you want to grab a beer and watch a game, this is a perfect spot to go."
Allie A.,"Union City, CA",123,49,13,5.0,9/8/2012,"The only complaint that I have is that it's always dark & busy.. Other than that this place is great. The staff is amazing, I've never had a bad experience here!"
Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",428,304,146,2.0,1/2/2012,Server was 10 min late on our water. Food was also taking longer than expected. I already experienced shitty quality at BJ's but I went here since it was close to the mall. I have to say their buffalo chicken wontons were good but 3 wontons is kinda little. Their seared ahi tuna was good but didn't taste fresh. Tasted like it was out of a can or the freezer.  My main meal was the unlimited soup and salad. Their house salad was drenched with too balsamic vinaigrette(sp?) and their chicken tortilla soup was really good. My friend's flatbread pizza was bland and I had to use ranch dip to add some flavor into it.  Their meals are EH but I usually ONLY go here for their pizookie. That's the only thing they're good at.
Hannah M.,"Fremont, CA",2,37,2,5.0,5/26/2014,"This review is for the bar top only!  I have to say the bartenders at this establishment are on point! Cory And Anthony  are so attentive and make some amazing cocktails! I had a great time sitting at their bar top. I would advise people to try an sit at the bar if it available, service in the dining room can be very disappointing.  All in all I was happily surprised by the service at the bar and I hope they keep it up!"
D.wight L.,"East Bay, CA",497,899,1578,4.0,7/29/2011,"Okay enough of the corporate restaurant bashing.  I'll play nice today.  Key word:  today.  So here's a quick congenial update, before I change my mind. This place ain't all that bad.  Been back many times and I keep getting more and more surprised on the decency of some of the items.  Pork Chops...not bad, NitWit Belgian White Beer...pretty damn good, NY Steak with giant baked potato that could feed a village in a third world country...I hate to admit it, good. So there it is. Come here if you want that proper Steak & a BJ experience! I mean Steak & a BJ's beer experience.  Ooopsies."
Terri L.,"San Jose, CA",28,60,3,2.0,7/20/2011,"I really don't know why some of my friends always choose to go to BJ's for group dinners because I think they aren't the greatest, other than their Pizookies.  We were in a large group, but I didn't think it was okay at all for our server to come sit with us for a bit and tell us how she has been getting crappy sections and haven't been making a lot of money. Are you trying to make us feel sorry for you and get more money out of us for your mediocre service? Well it's not working. Sorry!"
Ranika M.,"San Ramon, CA",16,11,,5.0,7/13/2014,"Bartender Sergio is awesome. The service is  great, fast and efficient. We had a big group and they catered to all our needs. Even after we had a few drinks. The lighting is a little dim and the floors were slippery but overall it was a great experience. We will definitely be coming back again!"
Rosario G.,"Fremont, CA",0,8,3,2.0,1/30/2014,"I absolutely love the restaurant and decided to try the take out , not impressed . I called ahead and placed my order with someone who seemed annoyed which annoyed me , she made me feel very rushed and I wasn't sure that she got my order right . (Which she didn't ) When I arrived to pay there were two cashiers , the person who called me forward to take me next wasn't able to take my payment . Instead I had to wait while money from another customer was exchanged directly in front of me . A customer who had arrived after me . Why call me forward and then tell me you can't take my money but you take the customer behind me ? Then when I was able to pay the girl was extremely rude when giving me my change and when I asked for a receipt she made a big show as if I was putting her out . And to top it off my order wasn't correct and I felt it was poorly prepared , I made the mistake of getting home first before I checked my food . My takeout experience wasn't what I was expecting and I doubt I'll do it again."
Kannan V.,"Kansas City, MO",9,11,,4.0,1/6/2013,Good find for me. hand-tossed Buffalo chicken pizza was just awesome! We ordered marsala chicken pasta but that wasnt great. The waitress was very polite and swapped our order without any questions. Great service!  Jeremiah red Irish pale ale is a must try. I loved it!
Monika S.,"Newark, CA",0,6,101,5.0,7/3/2015,"Love coming to BJ's! Overall, I think the service is alright. The reception and waiters are usually friendly. The food is tasty- love the appetizer platter they have (can't remember the name). The only problem I have had was waiting for the waiters to come (ordering food, paying bill, etc.)"
Deborah A.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,45,,2.0,12/20/2012,"This would have been a three star for me but I have to say waiting an hour after placing your order makes even the best of places lose points with me. We were seated right away and it was 1:30. We placed out orders and then waited. When we finally called the waiter over he said our meal would be right up there was a mistake in the type of bread they used for my friend's sandwich. I really think he should have come over and let us know there had been a delay and what it was caused from. My flat-bread pizza was nice but not warm and my friend's sandwich was luke warm,  The bathroom was clean and well kept and I always find that refreshing. Menus were sticky and really should have been cleaned off.  I feel the wait staff could handle the long waits a bit better."
Mary J.,"Castro Valley, CA",408,243,5290,5.0,6/12/2011,"My Birthday Lunch Date @ BJ's Friday, 6/3/11 - The Wonderful Company of My Sista LOCATION: Newark, CA...immediately West of Hwy 880, exit off Mowry Ave. The old Mervyn's building hasn't been torn down yet & no one's leased it out so the parking lot is always plenty for the neighbor building...BJ's Brewery & Restaurant! Ambiance here is socially-fun-loud, contemporary yet hip, sporty (large bar area & large flat screens throughout), family friendly, & hosting large parties friendly. Overall spacious making it very handicap, disabled, big-ppl, & senior citizen friendly too ^_^ WORDs OF CAUTION: Seriously, BEWARE OF THEIR SLIPPERY FLOORS! Not sure if it's possible to over-wax a floor or what, but for anyone wearing non-tennis shoes when visiting, walk easy w/ each step. What's crazy is that they (hostesses) KNOW their floors are a bit over-waxed & give warning as you get escorted to your table/booth. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've been here numerous times throughout a given day & throughout the week, & even tho I give caution to their floors, they definitely serve up great customer service here along w/ great food no matter when you visit. Keep up the awesome work team! EATS: Lord help me when I think I've sampled a lil' bit of everything here, when I visit again & survey their ""menu book"" I always find something new to try out. On this bday lunch w/ my sista, we enjoyed the below eats: $2.95 side Caesar Salad  $3.95 Mac & Cheese  $23.95 large Southwestern Pizza  I'll always recommend their Caesar Salad, just fresh & good! Sis enjoys their ""sophisticated"" mac & cheese w/ crumbled bacon on top; so creamy once u get 2-3 scoops in. Their pizza is listed as ""deep dish"", but it's just thick crust...not the definition as a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in my eyes. Don't get me wrong tho 'cuz their pizza crust is good & I've yet to sample something I didn't like here. I think my sis & I might have found our fav BJ's pizza tho...their Southwestern Pizza is scrum-didly-umptous! FINAL TAB: Our lunch, plus something to take home for our pops, came to $53.83   I'll definitely consider re-visiting BJ's over & over again   Plus gotta bring my BF, kuya & his fam here one day. PREVIOUS EATS WORTH MENTIONING $7.95 Soup (Chowder) & Salad Combo  Full Slab BBQ Ribs & Baked Potato  $13 Jambalaya  Flat Bread Pesto Chicken Pizza  $23.95 large Mediterranean Pizza  (close up   ) $23.95 large Cheeseburger Pizza  $23.95 large Supreme Pizza  Gluten Free Flatbread Personal Pan Pizza  Turkey Club Sandwich  $10.25 Angus Post Roast ""open"" Sandwich  $5.95 BJ's Baked Beignet  $8.95 Pizookie ""mini"" Trio  Pizookie   "
Michelle B.,"Fremont, CA",42,36,5,2.0,12/17/2012,"Went for dinner with my husband the other night. Our wait time for a table was about 15 minutes, not bad. Ordered soup/salad and dinner. Dinner came after about 30-40 minutes. The shrimp skewer my husband ordered was overcooked (he ordered two and they only brought one-had to cook that and bring it separately later) and our soup and salad came AFTER our dinner. Really? By the time my husband ate his soup it was cold. Mind you, we had to ask the person who brought our dinner (not our waiter) where our salad and soup were...Then the manager came over and apologized but did nothing with our bill other than to say sorry.  We have been to the BJ's in Dublin and the food/atmosphere/service was very good, so we thought we would try the one in Fremont. We will spend our $$ somewhere else. Food was ok but not good enought to go back."
Steven H.,"San Francisco, CA",86,25,10,2.0,7/18/2011,"You know, it's such a nice idea, and they try so hard....and the cream soda and root beer on tap just plain rock....but it's just not quite all there. I know it's a chain and it follows the brewpub/sports bar model, but they could do so much more. First, hire someone who knows how to train young people to wait tables on a large floor. Keeping the hands full and focusing on the moment is everything. Running back to the kitchen because you forgot a key piece of the meal (the cheese ordered on the sandwich?) or an incorrect entree, that far away to the kitchen means the other entrees are cold when the waiter returns....not excusable. Must focus on the task at hand. The floor is too big. And how do these errors happen so consistently in the first place? We have tried and tried again (the clam chowder is pretty good, and we like the appetizers) but we're always sending something back to be replaced. They need to pull it together, work on quality control and maybe turn down the TVs one notch (not on big game nights, but random nights with football reruns and soccer and all the *different* channels are ALL loud?) and then it might be okay."
