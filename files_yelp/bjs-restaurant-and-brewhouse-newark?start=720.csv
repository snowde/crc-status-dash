Melissa H.,"San Jose, CA",160,40,16,1.0,10/30/2011,"I tried calling when I needed to set up a farewell dinner for a friend. I called on a Thursday morning for RSVP Friday for roughly 30 people. I was put on hold, not asked to be, but just put on hold for a manager. The manager came on & when I inquired about the RSVP, he smirked & with attitude said, ""wait, you want a table tomorrow night, for 30? Friday? And you're calling me Thursday??"" I didn't need to deal with his smart ass remarks, so I responded by telling him we can take our money elsewhere. I could do with out his rude comments!! We ended up going to Jack's Brewing Company in the Hub. It was a MUCH better choice!!"
Holly S.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/22/2014,"The food was a little slow and once it arrived it was dry and cold, but our server Barbra was just the sweetest. She was so attentive and had a genuine interest in providing excellent service. Definitely saved the experience for me and my family."
Farah J.,"Pleasanton, CA",11,117,27,5.0,5/14/2012,Great place! BUT CALL AHEAD! IT TENDS TO BE 45 MIN WAIT FOR 2! OUTRAGEOUS.
Peaches C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",339,294,43,4.0,6/6/2011,"My girlfriends and I are addicted to the strawberry mojito here. It is aweeeessssooooommmeee! This BJ's seems a lot less crowded than the BJ's at oakridge, still crowded but not as bad. I've been here twice in the last month and can't complain on either the food or service. I know my girlfriends and I will be definitely coming back to our strawberry mojitos :) Oh and the ahi poke is amazing."
Jack D.,"Fairfield, CA",0,4,,3.0,9/2/2014,"The dessert menu is so irresistible but for someone who is on a budget, this is definitely not my go to place. Overall, if I didn't have a gift card I wouldn't be coming here again."
Dorothy F.,"New York, NY",352,181,67,4.0,5/11/2009,"Training for a marathon is brutal. Not only do I have to run 5-6 times a week but every week I have to complete a long run that ultimately totals 22 miles to ready me for the actual 26.2 mile race.  I won't bore you with the agonizing details but I will say this for the sake of all the eye-rollers, naysayers, and people who ask me why I do it: SO I CAN PIG OUT GUILT-FREE. Makes sense now right?  My latest day of gluttony was this Saturday after a body numbing 22 mile run in San Francisco. How I managed to crawl into and out of my shower, put both legs into a pair of leggings, then walk the rest of the night after my run is nothing short of a miracle. Given our miraculous feat my running buddies and I decided it was time to treat our bodies to a different kind of punishment. The kind that involves eating enormous amounts of calories, sugar, fat, calories, sugar, and anything fried.  BJ's Brew house was just the place we were looking for. Now it's by no means a hole in the wall dive, but they serve up some very satisfying bar fare and comfort food in a surprisingly sleek and modern setting.  Our party of 6 started with a medley of appetizers ( in other words more than we shoud have):  -onion strings - thin slices of perfectly salted & battered onion  -chicken wings- the buffalo sauce was drizzled on top along w/ranch for a less messy but still tasty buffalo-style wing  -Santa Fe spring rolls- light but satisfying w/ a great blend of veggies and meat  -artichoke dip - creamy, savory and kinda greasy YUM  Since we loaded up on appetizers I decided to keep my entree 'light' by ordering a thin crust appetizer-size pizza. I'm partial to thin crusts and a huge fan of basil and this pie had both, along with tomato and sausage so I couldn't really find anything wrong with it. I also snuck a few bites of their parmesan-crusted chicken and mashed potatoes. Good flavor but very rich and filling ( probably why my BF had 1/3 of it leftover). Overall I was very pleased with their food. Their menu isn't breaking new ground but the food is hearty and satisfying.  After our many plates were cleared came the inevitable question: ""do you guys have room for dessert?"" Clearly our server had no idea. Without a moment's hesitation we chose 2 orders of their signature dessert. The PAZOOKIE.  And oh my pazookie that stuff was good. Despite the strange name it's a simple combo of cookie and ice-cream. But BJ's has clearly perfected this classic pairing. The cookie was warm, the batter chewy, and the chocolate chunks slightly melted and topped with a generous serving of vanilla ice-cream. The pazookie was clearly the highlight of the night but service was also good and our waiter was upbeat and attentive.  Now you clearly don't have to run a marathon to eat at BJ's but it's the only surefire way to enjoy their food and Pazookies, without any guilt."
Ami P.,"Fremont, CA",20,16,,2.0,8/9/2011,"This place falls right in line with what I expect from any big chain restaurant: Wah wah wah...destination disappointment. The only reason why I even ""ate"" here was because it was the chosen birthday spot for a friend.   1.  Let's begin with opening the menu and about the 3rd page in, I found that the pages were stuck.  I pried them apart and discovered wet, slimy, avocado goop acting as the adhesive. Yuck...I was immediately turned off.  Obviously, the menus don't get cleaned as frequently as I hoped.     2. The house side salad was around $5...for what?! A plate sprinkled with a sparse array of lettuce, shredded carrots, 2 cherry tomatoes, and crumbled, bottom- of- the- bag croutons. I'm not cheap, by any means, but I'm not stupid with my money either.  This salad was 100% a rip off.  A Fresh Express Salad kit from Safeway for $3 would have been a supermodel salad compared to this.   3.  The Margherita Flatbread was what I decided on for my meal.  I chose it b/c the picture and the description seduced me. I saw words like ""fresh"" and ""sweet"".  Deception!! ! What came out was something that looked as if a teenager would have heated up as an after school snack out of a frozen box.  There was NO fresh mozerella from what I could see/taste, and the sauce had a weird chemical flavor reminiscent of the janitorial supply closet back in high school.   4.  The white peach and mint tea was undrinkable.  The instant it touched my tongue, my tastebuds rejected it.  I was anticipating a slightly sweet, peachy flavor laced with mint...what I experienced was loud, sour, syrup flavored water.   The redeeming factor of this place was our waitress.  She was very friendly (although it was transparent that her speech was rehearsed and insincere) and she had a smile on her face the entire time.   I will only return to BJ's if I have to due to another celebratory gathering."
A B.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/2/2015,Had 1/2 a dinner there tonight. You ask 1/2? I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and the menu says the mahi mahi was glazed. I sent it back because it was not glazed. It came back still not glazed. I like fish but this fish did not taste good it wasn't seasoned and needed the glaze. But that wasn't all went to the ladies the trash bin was overflowing and the toilet paper rolls from the stalls were strewn across the floor. Lovely dinner....not.
Angie C.,"Mountain View, CA",43,152,1,4.0,3/31/2012,"Another 4 stars thanks to having ANOTHER Saturday night snafu with the call-ahead seating. I called in at 7 pm, expecting a wait. As such, I was not surprised when I was told to arrive at 8 pm. We arrived at 8 and gave the name, mentioned we had call-ahead seating (there were two of us). The hostess handed us a pager and told us that'd be 30 minutes. I told her I did not expect a wait with call-ahead seating. She assured me that the call-ahead list was so long that the wait would still be 30 minutes. I told her that was unacceptable and asked to speak to a manager. As soon as the ""M"" word escaped my lips, the pager buzzed and we were ushered to our seats. Thankfully, we once again had wonderful service. Our server, Shane laughed and joked with us. At one point, my friend joked about getting brownie points for her birthday - and Shane ordered a birthday brownie as a surprise. He was on top of things and made the experience truly enjoyable. We spoke to the same manager, Brenda, who recognized us and thanked us again for the feedback. She told us how glad she was that we'd come back by, assured us that the front end waiting system is something they're still working on improving. So be forewarned - you may run into minor annoyance with the hosts. But once you get past the gatekeepers, this place is pretty awesome."
Michelle G.,"Union City, CA",3,5,,2.0,5/8/2014,"Boooooo this place. The quality of their food has dropped so much, especially their happy hour foods. Their service is consistently terrible (and I mean for years). I used to love their pizzas (the great white), but the last few times I've had it...yuck. One good thing I can say is their pizookies are still one of my favorite desserts, especially the oreo pizookie. Yum!  Fun environment, but don't expect much."
Jason H.,"Raleigh, NC",2,93,4,4.0,5/5/2015,"Food was good, though I had worked a 17 hour day so that level of hunger has to be taken into account. We had a pleasant waiter but based on what me and my work mate noticed it wasn't that he was inattentive just perhaps overbooked. We sat at a table in the bar. That was uncomfortably close to another table. I just found it an I enjoyable overly crowded atmosphere it's why I will give it a 4... It was good food but not the type of place you leave having had an experience you want to repeat."
S C.,"Boise, ID",0,2,,1.0,7/29/2015,"Understaffed or uncaring?  I'm really not sure.  I've noticed a steep decline in ""service"" at local restaurants in recent months, but BJ's is the winner of the worst service award.  I've dined at BJ's once each month for the past 3 months and nothing has improved.  Service staff is unattentive, food delivery takes way too long, food is either cold or ill prepared.  Nothing speaks quality.  Dining out isn't cheap, and because of that the expectation from customers for good service is high.  Sadly I won't be returning despite the great beer selection.  Worse yet, I've had friends tell me that service at BJ's in Pleasanton and in San Mateo are just as bad."
Jason T.,"San Lorenzo, CA",8,24,2,3.0,1/2/2012,"Hm. I can drink now. The beer is good.  Getting a little older I've learned to not expect service not necessarily advertised. Sit to eat and drink-- A-okay.  Food-- Okay. What do you expect from a chain. IT is your cheesecake etc.  Beer-- Good.  Night-- chill, for the most part.  Loud-- Yes.  Dark-- Yes.  Floor Slippery-- sometimes and I don't know why.  Restroom-- Clean, it too is dark-- you might not look as cool as you might think.  Overall. Eh. It is Fremont, where else do I go and not spend a journey's time?"
Jo-Ann G.,"Brentwood, CA",59,18,34,5.0,6/2/2012,"We celebrated our twin daughters baptism here last 4/28th.  We have about 80 guests and everything was just perfect.  The service was excellent.  The manager and servers that day were very attentive, all the drinks were served and refilled quickly.  They made sure that we didn't ran out of food; even towards the end, they kept sending out more appetizers that most of our guests took some home.  They also let us use an extra long table for our own cake, cookies & candy bar; and  set up our projector too. Thank you for the excellent service, we'll definitely do another special event in the future."
Tuyet N.,"San Jose, CA",129,100,4,1.0,6/28/2013,"This is not the place to try pasta. I had the shrimp scampi. The noodles were dry and the shrimp was bland. The server never asked us how our food was. I've worked in the service industry before so I still tipped over 20%. It's not the sever's fault the food was bad, but he should've asked about the food."
Laura D.,"Fremont, CA",16,35,2,3.0,4/30/2014,Their food is really good especially the chicken tortilla soup. You can never go wrong with the Buffalo chicken pizza. The only thing that sucks is there service. Always slow and they make a lot mistakes on the check.
Lynn B.,"Hayward, CA",2,38,,1.0,7/3/2013,"I wish I would of read these reviews before I went there. The service was really bad. We were sat down pretty fast and our server took our order very quickly.  Sounds great so far!  Took about 10 or 15 mins to bring our drinks. After that never saw him again.  The table next to us who came the same time we did got their appetizers and salads and we were still siting there with our ice waters (They had a different server). My poor son had something floating in his drink so he didn't even have that. Not one time did our server come and check on us. After more than 40 mins I started gettting really mad. I told my son  hope our salads come pretty soon so we can eat them before our dinner comes out. A few mins later a guy comes out with 2 plates and comes to our table. He was wearing a chefs hat ( I think he was the cook.) and put our dinners on the table. I told him that we never received our salads yet. The cook said that he would have the manager come and talk to us. Out of no where our server shows up and said that there was some kind of ""glitch"" and he would go get our salads. When he brought the salads, he messed up on mine. He said he would go get me another one but I told him to forget it. The thing that really makes me mad is I think our dinners were sitting because they were not very hot. This was my first and last time there.......:("
Ed G.,"Oakland, CA",0,17,1,2.0,5/25/2014,"Ate here tonight with my date. The service was ok. The food, however, was about as bland as I've ever had. This BJs doesn't hold a candle to the BJs in Cupertino. EVERYTHING was bland...wings, potato skins, salads. Even the dessert was bland. How can one screw up dessert?!!  BJs Newark - come for the beer but say no to the food!"
GuyFawkes S.,"Milpitas, CA",0,16,,2.0,6/9/2013,"While driving home from work, I was craving some feticinni alfredo with broccoli and grilled chicken for dinner and maybe save some for lunch the next day. I didn't have the number to call ahead so I parked in the To Go parking spot and called the number posted.  When someone answered, I said I wanted to order To Go. I was asked my name which I answered. I was asked two more times and I answered the same each time. I got annoyed, why wouldnt he believe me or was he confused that I already ordered and was here to pick-up? I waited for 35 minutes in my car with the air conditioner on which was not a problem. I saw how busy they were by all the people coming in and out of the restaurant. Once I received my food, I excitedly drove home to dine on my favorite meal from BJ's.  I ate 30% of the meal and closed it up for tomorrow. A few hours later I got drowsy and nauseous.  I vomited out the meal and tossed the leftovers in the garbage. I'm not sure if I want to return to this restaurant."
John G.,"Union City, CA",120,83,7,3.0,4/9/2012,"The food here is okay. I only really come for the mini pizzas. The Buffalo chicken, Cheeseburger, and Favorite pizza are pretty good. They started skimping on the Ahi Poke app though. I remember it being more than enough, but now it's become a one person portion. The beer here is also ok. Their house brews are just ok. You can find better versions of each beer somewhere else. Even though it's not a house brew, Chimay Blue is the only real beer that makes my mouth water here. I'ts a good spot to watch games, so many TVs and there's that kind of huge one right over the bar."
