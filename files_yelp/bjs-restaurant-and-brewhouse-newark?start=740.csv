Hailey K.,"Mountain View, CA",209,44,99,3.0,7/17/2011,"Avocado roll every time! That is a must try, though it is not that unique. It is a good spot to chill with friends and have a relaxing night. All the BJs are huge so it would be hard for those boys and girls make really quick services but I can tell they tried their best.  Also, the buffalo chicken pizza was fantastic. The good thing is that they use ranch but not blue cheese! That's what real buffalo style should be. Then Pizookie time. We nailed the order by getting half Chocolate Chip cookie and half Red Velvet Cookie with White Chocolate Chips. The combo was awesome and the Red Velvet cookie better masked the poor quality of the ingredients.  After the dessert, we had some wine and beers. I would say the drinks are not that impressive but after all, it is a chain restaurant so it is quite understandable."
Mary Jane P.,"Hayward, CA",142,458,166,4.0,3/10/2012,"Came here late night after going to San Jose to see cirque du soleil totem. we were seated promptly. We asked the waitress her suggestions and the guys in our group ordered exactly what she suggested. They  loved it! It was a half cheeseburger half 5 meat pizza.  We also ordered for appetizers hot wings, tuna tar tar and shrimp wraps. All were Delicious!! I ordered the blacked salmon. It was so good I am craving it and cant wait to go back......hmmmmm maybe I can figure out their seasonings used to make the rub.....naw I'll just steal some!! hahaha"
Malia W.,"Tacoma, WA",118,343,362,4.0,12/11/2011,"Came here this weekend to spend some time with old friends. We found a booth in the bar area. VERY packed on a Saturday night. We ordered two pitchers of Hefeweizer, one mojito and four appetizers (3 from the mini appetizer menu) Came up to about $70. The waitress came around a lot asking if we needed anything. However, when we ordered beer or asked for the check it took a fairly long time. But it may have slipped her mind since they were pretty busy.  Overall, like all the other BJ's I've been to. Good food and good beer :) They had lots of parking since the restaurant is in between what was mervyns and circuit city."
Thamina S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/8/2015,"I'm actually sad with this location. It takes forever to recieve our food, they need to have more waiters on the clock or else they will run out of business soon. We ordered potato skins as our app and we specificed no meat on it because of religious reasons and when it got to our table, lo and behold there was meat. It took them awhile but when they finally gave us our app our entree had arrived. My sister ordered a cajun pasta and believe me there was nothing cajun about it, it tasted just like bland spaghetti with ragu sauce. I ordered a small pizza and it was barely even warm. I would say our wait for our food was 30-40 minutes, which is unacceptable. I can't come here anymore."
Nick F.,"East Bay, CA",110,796,106,4.0,4/20/2009,"I've been to other BJ's in the past and have been to this location three-times for lunch and one-time for appetizers/drinks last Thursday. (Thanks Chris for the great service!) Let's start with what happened last night...I'm not a beer drinker but my friend kept raving about a few of the beers they had, like this Pumpkin Ale whatever it's called?  So, I figured what the hell...April 16, 2009 will mark the first day in the 31-years of my life that beer would touch my lips.  We both ordered two ""Taster Sets,"" which were four - 5oz glasses (See the pic I uploaded). I picked the one that was preset and she picked a custom set.  This was a GREAT way to test if I liked the light - darker stuff.  Based on the different beers I tried, I can say that I liked...actually, enjoyed if anything the Pale Blonde.  Not too sure if it'll make me a beer drinker but, if I ever had to order one, that's what I'd go for. They have a pretty wide selection of menu choices, probably a little too much that you might have a hard time deciding what to order.  Their menu is kinda reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory's menu, without the advertisement on every other page!   We ordered their sampler appetizer (It has a real name, I just forgot the name of it!) but it came with Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Santa Fe Spring Rolls and Avocado Egg Rolls.  I think it was about $13.95, not too bad.  We both got a salad, I absolutely LOVE their Wedge Salad...it has to be the dressing I think!  Overall it was a great night. The other couple times I've been here were for lunch.  They have some pretty decent lunch specials like a half sandwich with fries and half salad for about $7-$8.  I got the California Chicken Club and of course, the Wedge Salad...major yum!  They also had a personal pizza and salad for also about the same price, as well as a bunch of other specials. It can get pretty busy there around lunch time so, if you're on a 30 or even a 60, plan on a 90!  Gotta leave room for some workplace gossip while they prep the food!  haha!   But that's where they loose 1-star, not many people have the luxury of an extended lunch hour and they don't seem to realize the sense or urgency of getting out of there at a decent time.  The first time we were there, the manager noticed me constantly checking to see what time it was and eventually comped our meal.  Don't get any ideas, this was like the 2nd day they were open....and they did improve the 2nd time around! ;) Overall, BJ's is a great place for lunch, dinner, happy hour, watching a game, etc.   My only beef is that the plaza where it's located at sucks!  The only two entrances to reach the restaurant are like ridden with major, major potholes.  :/  But, that's not their fault...we'll blame it on Mervyn's for going out of business!  haha!"
Will M.,"Santa Ana, CA",554,646,2467,4.0,6/9/2009,"This is their newest restaurant in the area.  I am generally not a fan of chains, but I love BJ's concept of good microbrew and tasty food.  I've been eating at my local BJs for about 5 years since they opened, so it was an easy choice to check out this Fremont Newark restaurant.  First off, the restaurant is as crowded as a free Molly Cyrus concert during weekends.  We drove by on Fri. Night at 6 PM and there were lines of people outside.  We returned for lunch at 1:30 PM on Saturday and it was immediate seating.  I had their Baslamic Chicken, ($12) very flavorful and moist chicken with small side of greens and dressing and  seasoned rice in lieu of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a little sweet with a slight tang, and that glaze onion was yummy.  I opted for the cooly named Nitwit White Belgian beer ($6) which is Hefeweizen with tiny bit of coriander and citrus.  It was a perfect match.  My nephew had their Mediterranean Pizza which he eats with topped with ranch dressing. My brother had the chicken lettuce wraps, always a winner esp. at BJ's.   Generally, most of the food their I've tried is quite good and there is enough of it.  Their pizzas are excellent with a puffy flavorful crust. Their pastas are good, as are sandwhiches. My favorite item, though, it their version of the Chinese Asian sesame salad. They use napa cabbage instead of lettuce, so the flavor and texture are better than lettuce based salads in my opinion.  Lastly, I love their award winning bears, all of them.  And they are good about telling you what goes with a certain food in case you don't know.   Service was friendly and quick this time.  I know this place is nuts during prime time on weekends.  This new restaurant is clean and very well put togehter, though loud.  Fortunately, they built it right next to a recently abandoned Mervyn's.  So although this is a high high traffic area, at least parking isn't a problem right now.  Of course, if they put something else like another shop in the ex Mervyns, it could be bad parking wise. They keep advertizing their pizzookie.  I've had it, it's yummy.  But it's a pschological ploy.  They know you'll love their food, and for most restaurants, desserts are a huge money maker.  So is coffee and beverages.  So if you haven't had enough food, maybe you'll go for their yummy dessert, and that is a good choice.  There are other desserts here, too. But being a bigger fan of the Flipino dessert called halo halo, an ice and canned milk and ice cream concoction of preserved and canned fruits and beans, I never quite get to their desserts. We headed elsewhere for that, but they have good food period here. The bill was $46 plus tip.  Not bad for a very nice time."
Tung T.,"San Leandro, CA",259,148,46,2.0,5/18/2011,"Remembered when BJ's was the S!$T? Like when you would travel 25+ miles and wait 30min + for a table to enjoy some good food and ultimately eat their famous pazookie. Well those days are over!  BJ's...what happened? I would use to crave their entrees and appetizers but now i am dreaded every time I am forced to go to BJ's. The last time i went with a group of friends for drinks, i tried their snakebite thinking that it would be just as good as Yardhouse's. O boy was I wrong. It was pretty bad beer on top of pretty bad pear cider that had a medicine aftertaste to it. I love beer, but i couldn't even force myself to drink that. For snacks, I shared the Best Beginning appetizer which comprised of spinach dip, avocado rolls, santa fe rolls, and mozzarella sticks. One word: mediocre.  O yea and the red velvet pazookie? W T F. Does not taste like red velvet at all. LIARS!  This BJ's especially, I think I've only had bad experiences of BJ's at this particular location. But think about it...why do we go to chain restaurants? It is because we hope and think that being a chain, every restaurant should have the same standard. That's what makes chain restaurants so successful. So i have no pity at all, if you are confident enough to open up chain restaurants you better have all of them at the right standards!  But besides that, good service is no good if the food sucks. Our waiter, although is very nice. He had a very strong undertone which i did not appreciate. It felt like we were kids and he was just serving us to take our money. Anyways enough rambling, go at your own risk."
Stawan K.,"San Jose, CA",1,147,,4.0,3/15/2014,Love this place for their variety of beers and drinks. Lively place with some great options to eat specially the flat breads and appetizer menu. Great for a weekday party with office crowd. Always crowded and fun when a good game is on.
Natasha S.,"Fremont, CA",219,179,209,3.0,1/19/2012,ive had very iffy experiences here ... never consistent This time when we went they forgot my nachos and gave us chips and salsa ... umm wheres my CHEESE!! ugh ... and he never realized what he did ... ummm HELLO! sooo we asked another server that we ordered nachos and this is what we got and then she got the manager who came to us and apologized and said that our nachos will be coming out and that will comped as well as the complimentary chips and salsa that we got instead. yeaaaah i filled up on the chips and salsa and maybe took one bite of the nachos i originally ordered. we also ordered the ahi tuna appetizer ... nom nom nom ... yummy! OVERALL: eh ill go back again probably to try the beer sampler since i need to expand my palette for beer haha
Manish P.,"Santa Clara, CA",8,58,,5.0,3/14/2015,"Always love going to BJ's - no matter which location!  They have huge variety of items to choose from, portions are very generous and they've got some really good beers -- not to mention their yummy Pizzokie :)"
Mary G.,"Fremont, CA",0,33,,4.0,7/23/2015,great food. Get in before 7pm other wise you will waiting 45min-1hour
Sabrina Alexandra L.,"Fremont, CA",33,109,18,3.0,8/8/2013,"I've finally tried this place out after working in this town for 3 years. The food was excellent and the service was prompt and their drinks were perfect. The only downfall to this place is the wait time. They said during weekdays, the wait time can be up to half an hour to an hour and weekends are 1hr plus. That's the only issue I have with this place but I'll still be coming here for the drinks."
Anna W.,"San Leandro, CA",491,576,478,4.0,6/29/2011,"Of all the chain restaurants that we frequent (and we frequent many chains), Boyfriend ranks this chain as one of his favorites. The service has always been pretty friendly and the food is pretty decent for the price that you pay. The wait staff is always willing to split the check for you, which is always appreciated, especially when there is a large group of friends. I think one of my favorite things to see is how many late high school/college-aged girls come here, dressed to the nines (think clubwear). It's really not an upscale restaurant at all; I mean, it's not McDonald's, but it's not exactly Gary Danko either. The wait for dinner here can get pretty excessive, so call ahead on your way out there and get your name on their waiting list so your wait time isn't as painful once you get there (especially on Friday/Saturday nights). Boyfriend also really loves the beer selection here. They have a wide selection on tap (from my understanding), and they also have seasonal beers available on tap as well. Of their alcohol, I have only tried their Irish Root Beer -- which is delicious, but light (not that I can drink much anyway). One of my favorite items on their menu is their baked potato. It's HUGE, delicious, filling and cheap. What more can a starving college girl ask for? Their pizzas are also amazing, and a small or medium pizza is usually enough to share between two people (or it is for Boyfriend and I, but I also don't tend to eat a lot in general). Their nachos appetizer is also amazingly large -- we shared it among four people and still couldn't demolish it. BJ's, however, is famed for their Pizookie. It's probably one of the better desserts that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming and regretting (for, alas, I am lactose sensitive). I recommend getting the Pizookie Trio, so you can get three smaller Pizookies and try them all as opposed to just one large Pizookie. Be warned though; you'll get hooked. Giant, warm cookie topped with delicious ice cream? Be still, my artery-clogged heart (and please, please be still after, my poor upset tummy)."
Marevie T.,"San Jose, CA",1823,674,26,4.0,11/11/2013,"The food is always wonderful at BJs anywhere! I liked the Ahi, the mushrooms appetizer and of course, the beer. MMMMMM.... BEER. Anyway, the host at the front was really upbeat and I was kind of expecting our waitress to be the same, unfortunately not. The only things that were upbeat was her eyelashes, that seemed to keep her eyes open. Lol! Awe I get that its the end of the night, but look a little alive when you're serving DJ's who have to be 100% at odd hours of the night and decided to come in to eat before going out. It's not that bad. Lol"
Laila A.,"Fremont, CA",0,7,3,1.0,5/7/2011,"So here I am trying to enjoy dinner for the First time at this location and what a waste of time. Service wasn't good at all the server seems to be in la la land. I ordered a chicken sandwich with no bacon and what comes on my sandwich? Bacon! She disappeared and didn't check in so I was sitting there wasting my whole lunch away (and the restaurant wasn't even busy!) she finally comes back I ask to have it taken off the bill because now I'm late and need to leave, she offers a box and bring the bill with no box! I have to hunt her down again for a box to pack my other left overs.  Won't be coming back anytime soon!"
Kass T.,"Union City, CA",17,45,39,3.0,8/31/2013,"Food and drinks are amazing but their customer services is usually bad. I'm a regular here because I love the pazookies but seriously, most of the time the waiters are moving too fast and forget about the importance of customer service."
Dianne M.,"Fremont, CA",41,39,85,4.0,2/13/2012,"I love BJs. Ever since it opened, Fremont/Newark had some entertainment late night places to go besides milk tea places.  They close at midnight. the Food is great, and the drinks are good.  I always order the chicken dishes like chicken parmigiana, crusted chicken something, and the deep dish pizzas are pretty good. The mini pizzas are just as good although not enough toppings like the regular size.  The only food that I didn't like here at BJs that I've tried was the fish so far. Taste and texture and dry...did not finish my meal. The Strawberry Blast, I think, is really good with a taste of rum...it's similar to the pina colada and I always order this when I want something with alcohol.  The wait can be long, up to an hour, if you come on Friday nights or weekends."
Skyler W.,"Sacramento, CA",97,180,22,4.0,3/27/2011,"Happy Hour until 7pm! $1 off beers $2 off all apps and 50% off mini pizzas.  This BJ's looks and feels like all of their other restaurants.  This restaurant is conveniently located right off of the 880 on Mowry rd.  I came here after work on a Thursday night at around 6pm, the place was crowded, but i was able to score a seat at the bar. It was happy hour, so i decided to order some hot wings and a Lagunitas IPA. The wings were magnificent, juicy and slightly crispy . The sauce came on the side, so you are able to control how much heat you really want.  The beer was of course ever so delicious. I also ordered the Mini Bruschetta, it was very cheap and really tasty, the pieces of bread were thick, and it tasted similar to their pizza dough. Overall i was very happy with my visit to BJ's, the food was excellent and the service was right there with it, even the other people at the bar were very friendly. Also i was very impressed with their selection of beer, i counted 28 beers on tap!! I will definitely come back here again for some good ol' happy hour eatin and drinkin."
Felicia I.,"Newark, CA",71,23,4,3.0,10/11/2013,I left a review before which was terrible but the only reason why I'm leaving a second review is because the waiter I had tonight. BJ's is known for their terrible service but tonight a waiter named Ed was amazing!!! I give that guy 5 stars for his service and hopefully he will get recognized because majority everyone who is a waiter/waitress there sucks. But thank you ed!!!
Omar G.,"Union City, CA",33,10,,4.0,4/20/2011,"BJ's doesn't seem to need a review since it seems everyone has been here!  Still, I need to procrastinate so here goes: The food here is always high quality, be it the pizzas, burgers or that awesome runs Poke appetizer.  The staff is usually pretty friendly & helpful.  The beer, well the beer is ok.  I have never been a huge fan of their house beers, but I love the fact that the serve some great guest brews.  You'll often find Anderson Valley, Speakeasy, Drake's and other local brews. Also, for the homebrewers, they offer a 10% discount with your AHA card!  Almost forgot about the Pizzookie.. can't do that!  A freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top... rocks!"
