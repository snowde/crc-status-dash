cheryl d.,"Union City, CA",8,22,32,2.0,3/4/2011,"I usually like ""bj's"" but this one just falls flat. 2 stars go to the pizookie & chili cheese potato wedges. my pizza was way under cooked, the fact that the veggie toppings tasted raw and temp was barely warm. the wait is ridiculous.  the staff is slow at times."
Nikki C.,"East Bay, CA",1790,409,785,3.0,1/14/2011,"I've been to several BJ's restaurants and this location quite a few times.  The food is decent, service is okay, and happy hour specials aren't the best. HAPPY HOUR 4pm to 7pm 10pm to close Raspberry Lemon Drop = 3 stars * tastes pretty good but I prefer a traditional lemon drop. Brewhouse Blonde = 4 stars * my favorite BJ's beer next to the Nutty Brunette.   Angel Hair Toscana = 3.5 stars * reasonably priced, large portion, & very similar to TGIF's Bruschetta Chicken Pasta.  However, at BJ's you can order it plain, with Chicken or with Shrimp. Spinach & Artichoke Dip = 3 stars * your average dip served w/tortilla chips Crispy Calamari = 3 stars * a bit too greasy for my taste but pretty good nonetheless. Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza = 4 stars * considered an appetizer but can easily be ordered as an entree. This is my favorite happy hour special. Pizookie = 5 stars * one of the only reasons I crave BJ's over other chain restaurants is their infamous Pizookie dessert.  I typically order Chocolate Chunk and this never lets me down.  Most recently I tried their Cookies 'N Cream Pizookie and it's equally gratifying. 3 stars is a fair rating.  I don't normally dine here for lunch or dinner, mainly because their food is pretty average w/the exception of the Pizookie.  9 times out of 10 we're here for happy hour or for someone's birthday.  The bar area gets very crowded and hard to find a seat if you're with a large party.  You'll get the most out of their Happy Hour by ordering the food specials.  For drinks, you only get $1 OFF cocktails and beer so if you're looking to get buzzed at a lower cost then TGIF is a better alternative for Happy Hour."
Bill C.,"San Ramon, CA",58,549,64,2.0,7/2/2009,"This place is average on a good day. Their brewed beers were ok. Although you can tell by the taste and finish, they don't use high end ingredients in the beers. They are cheap, mass produced beers that try to pass as Microbrews. I had there Nutty Brewnette (American Brown Ale) and it was just ok. Not a particularly memorable beer. I ended up switching to Boddingtons.  The food was again mass produced. I had a Cuban sandwich burger. It was easy to tell the burger portion had been cooked long ago was was simply kept warm. How hard is it to make a burger tough? I swear I had to chew that burger forever. It wasn't all that good. The dinner salads were pretty plain and boring. The salad missed the nice crisp crunch you'd expect from a salad.  Will I be back? Naw, there are plenty of places to get average food."
Aurora R.,"San Jose, CA",9,10,1,5.0,5/17/2014,"Came here on a lunch date with my hubby. We were seated quickly. It was nice, clean, cozy. Our server was Jonathan J, he was very perky, polite, and attentive. We will be back."
Cat G.,"San Ramon, CA",252,214,35,1.0,3/1/2011,"Saturday, February 26th, 2011.  We were in town for a big NCS wrestling meet. We had a break in the afternoon and decided to take all the kids to BJ's for lunch before finals. We arrive with a group of 18-20 people. Right away the Manager on duty said that she has a big party that will be done in about 20 minutes and we'll be seated no longer than 35 minutes. If it was going to be any longer than that we'd have to go somewhere else in order to get back in time. So we stayed given that time window.  45 minutes later...  Still waiting, 18 people deep in the waiting area... when I asked the manager how much longer it would be, she said they were bussing our tables and we would be seated in just another 10 minutes.  15 minutes later...  ""I'm so sorry, they are just putting your tables back together, we'll be seating you in 5 minutes. Why don't I start putting in your orders now so that when you sit down the food will be ready"" Which we agreed to do..  20 minutes later...  They take us to the table. By that time. two of our pizzas were cold, one of the sandwiches had soggy bread. 8 of the kids had to go back to the school, scarfing down food, because a 35 minute wait turned into an hour and 20 minutes. Food was awful, clam chowder was runny and luke warm. We ate the food and left. Not a good experience at all, to say the least."
Rosemarie P.,"Hayward, CA",585,145,640,3.0,3/6/2009,"Every time I go there, the service gets worse and worse.  They're lucky the food is so good or I wouldn't ever go back.  Damn the service! Love the BBQ Chicken Salad (on romaine lettuce, dressing on the side) - on hit!"
cindy c.,"Oakland, CA",259,127,43,4.0,1/7/2012,"Yummy appetizers such like the avocado rolls. The dipping sauce that comes with it delicious sweet with a bit of spiciness. Yum! The santa fe rolls are another one of my favorite.  The best beginning is what we usually order N it has the above rolls with it, it also comes with mozzarella sticks and spinach and artichoke dip with chip. The drinks are usually on the VERY sweet side, so if you're not Into super sweet cocktails make sure you ask them to reduce the syrup.  They have a large variety of beer. And a few selection of wines. They have a pretty large menu and haven't had everything on it, but so far the things I have are very tasty."
Jan P.,"San Leandro, CA",1707,462,1259,4.0,12/18/2010,Pizookie gets a five. (white choc macadamia nut). Friends were talking up this dish but thought how good can a cookie dessert in a chain restaurant be? I'm not sure I even wanted to know how right they were. Now the rest of my life is just time in between pizookies. UPDATE- 5 days later. Just realized the origins of the term pizookie is pizza + cookie. Oh!
Cindy C.,"Oakland, CA",68,201,450,1.0,3/11/2011,"I am so mad at BJ's! This was my favorite location up until i came here one night and the waitress was  horrible...so rude! We sat down at 11ish. our waitress came to us late and then started rushing us. She DIDNT bring water til after we order then told us we had to pay the bill before we got our food. We couldnt even eat peacefully without her rushing us telling us we have 15 min then 10 min then 5 like damn! If the host wouldve told us earlier then maybe we wouldnt have stayed ! Or  would have sat at the bar! Thanks to this incident, Im officially not coming to this location anymore!"
Razel M.,"Seattle, WA",149,256,44,4.0,11/11/2011,"This is me and my girl Grace's spot -- whenever I'm in the bay, odds are we meet here. She always orders the classic burger (""but no dressing, and can I have ranch instead?"") and I'm the more adventurous one. BJ's has a huge menu and, guaranteed, something will look good to you on any given day. We usually sit at the bar and, perhaps people are entertained by our girl talk, but we always end up with free drinks. ;-) Finally, PIZOOKIES. What's not to like? =) Well, okay, the service can be hit or miss, although at this branch it's usually a hit. And the wait can be pretty bad around dinner time or on the weekends. But, PIZOOKIES."
L T.,"Hayward, CA",0,26,2,2.0,2/21/2011,"This place reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory minus one important thing - Customer Service. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of BJ's in San Diego and Reno, but had not given this Brewhouse a try until the other night. Walked in and was almost awed, it was definitely a hot spot with large screen TVs, a noisy bar and plenty of people waiting to be seated. Curiously, there were open tables when I browsed the floor, and now I know why. Reservations? Sure, 10 people or more and 80% of your party must be present before being seated. I get that. But no reservation and you are still required to have 80% of your party there before seating. Wait a minute? If you have kids, this is a real stressor. Especially if you know that people will be trickling in after work and not necessarily show up all at once. Shame on me? If only I had known. While waiting we look over the extensive menu, a definite plus as far as selection goes. Even gluten free options for the growing number of people with allergies. Had to try the gluten free beer and was not disappointed. Not hoppy so if you are an IPA fan, this is not your beer, but for those that like the smoother sweeter beers, this one is tasty enough to get you through the night. Spent enough time reading the multi-page menu and still not at the 80% mark. Fine, kids are restless, but don't hassle us about not having everyone there. It's your policy and when you say, ""Hey, let's all meet up at BJ's!"" it's not like you will get everyone there at the same time. Making the story short, the manager stepped in and seated us with only 70% present. Food is tasty enough and the selection of brew is impressive; Arrogant Bastard Ale anyone? Kids are now happier with fries, mac-n-chess [which is bigger than the gourmet adult version], chicken fingers and burgers; the adults are now happier with some drinks in their systems. One thing to ponder: Potatoes bigger than a four year old's head! Not natural. But unfortunately, we had to ask for our server for things more than a few times. For the price and the included gratuity, we expected a bit more, but someone mentioned that is just the sign of the times. Seriously? Since when did good customer service change its definition based on generational values? The food was good, beer is better than most, atmosphere is lively, pricing is on the higher side . . . but sadly the deal breaker is the customer service and the way they treated us from the beginning. Not sure we will be going back any time soon. Even if by the end of the night everyone did show up - 100% thank you!"
Raven B.,"Union City, CA",22,144,42,1.0,2/12/2013,"I went here when it first opened and I wasn't really impressed, but my visit on 2/11/12 sealed the deal for me. My waiter was Jon-Paul and he was very slow helping my group although barely anybody was in the restaurant. It was 10PM and the place wasn't even 1/4 filled. When he was serving us, he kept putting his arm (and later his ARMPIT) in my face instead of finding an easier way to hand us our food/drinks. I found that really disrespectful because a few times he even brushed my bangs and not once did he apologize. Also, I had a question about the check and later when we left, we heard him talking bad about our group to the security guy. The food was OK, but the service makes it not worth coming back."
Diana P.,"Fremont, CA",361,159,301,4.0,6/13/2011,"This is pretty much the default spot for my friends and I when we want to have a dinner to catch up.. good drinks, good food, not too far of a drive, and not that long of a wait.  Been here maybe 4-5 times since it opened & the staff is pretty friendly.  One time I had ordered the ahi poke appetizer, and requested extra avocado since there was only like 5 cubes of avocado with my ahi. The waitress was sweet to get it for me not charge since she saw there wasn't that much on plate. She was very attentive to our party and we never had to flag her down when we needed anything.  Love love love the berry burst cider, can't get enough of that!"
Rain E.,"Milpitas, CA",5,3,1,5.0,2/28/2014,"Came here w/ my bf around 2 for a late lunch. Our server Allie (sp?) was very attentive & would check up on us to make sure everything was good. Both our orders treated real good, as well as our white chocolate pizzookie (:"
Mar A.,"San Mateo, CA",245,247,293,5.0,2/3/2011,"This place is always crowded--- which means people are coming for a reason, right? I've been here a few times and have never had bad service. The servers are always helpful and friendly, and the bar staff makes very strong drinks. I love their beer here! Their micro brews are delicious (I can't leave unless I have a Jeremiah Red and a Harvest Hef). But this place also has a ton of other non-BJs beers on tap and a lot of others in bottles. They have a full bar, enough TVs and sports to keep everyone satisfied, and waiting space for when it gets super crowded and you have to wait for a table. Bathrooms are always clean, which is a plus for a place that is always crowded. Order the pot roast sandwich. You'll thank me later. And they have a pizza for everyone! I tried the mac n cheese last night and it was the perfect serving size for a small bite. Get it. It's delicious!"
Samantha S.,"San Leandro, CA",60,110,12,2.0,5/16/2011,"I've come here a couple of times very recently and I can say the second trip did not redeem the first trip.  This rating is all based on the food, not the service. The first time I came here with a small group of friends for drinks.  We ended up ordering the best beginning appetizer sampler.  The four dishes that made up this sampler all sounded delicious.  It came with avocado egg rolls, sante fe spring rolls, spinach dip, mozzarella sticks, and a small selection of dipping sauces.  I've had better avocado egg rolls at other BJ's locations, so it's safe to say I was very disappointed.  And as far as the sante fe spring rolls go, I'm speechless.  They looked like they were old and had been sitting out some where for far to long.  The mozzarella sticks and spinach dip were nothing special either.  The drink I got was the jerry burst, which I enjoyed.  It was a berry cider mixed with some type of beer. The second time I went with a larger group of people.  It was very difficult to decide what to get to eat so I ended up getting the mozzarella tomato salad while i made my final decision.  The tomatoes had absolutely NO flavor and the balsamic dressing that came with it was completely hard on the plate.  It looked very pretty, but the overall taste was pretty disgusting.  Even if the balsamic dressing wasn't cemented into the plate it still had an off flavor.  I ended up getting the ahi tuna appetizer for dinner because it looked and sounded amazing.  To bad it wasn't.  I think they might have forgotten to add the sauce that came with it because it was straight flavorless chunks of tuna. I normally love coming to BJ's, but I think I may have to take a brief break before returning soon.  The service though both times was amazing!"
Ilana D.,"San Leandro, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/22/2013,Got take out 43 dollars for 2 pizzas and drove all the way from Hayward to get it. The pizza wasn't cooked all the way through raw and cold in the middle. All the toppings fell off when you tried to pick ul a slice from the cooked part. Barely any cheese to hold it on. Sad pizza very overpriced.
Katherine M.,"Milpitas, CA",29,18,2,4.0,3/24/2013,"Went here with a group of friends. This was my first time at BJs and I am definitely a fan.  There are all kinds of TVs throughout the restaurant and it was very busy.  If you are looking for a quiet little restaurant, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for a lively restaurant, here you go.  We ordered our lunch and it was served quickly.  The portions were a good size.  We decided to split dessert and had Pazzokis.  These were to die for.  Next time, I won't finish my lunch and save more room. The Peanut Butter cookie with chocolate ice was my favorite.  I will definitely be back."
Andrew M.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,109,34,2.0,5/21/2011,"Came here with a bunch of friends to wish me a fun going away. I've been to BJ's before in Foster City and I remembered it being pretty good. This one, well unfortunately I can't say the same.  Being a bunch of 21 year olds, we wanted some alcohol and the girl who was serving us, who was very sweet, didn't know anything about the drinks. She wasn't 21 and they didn't teach her what to look for but its okay, still got what we wanted. Their beer is pretty good, a little too skunky for me but I'm always down to try something new.  The food was mediocre. I order the Pot Roast sandwich. It was messy, the pot roast was over cooked and the mash potatoes were very mushy. Their pizza was probably the best thing and that was just okay as well.  Sorry BJ's, won't be back."
Kim V.,"Fremont, CA",178,261,33,2.0,1/2/2011,"UPDATE. Came here a few days ago on a lunch date with 5 other friends. What happened to the cute waiter who serviced my birthday dinner here?! Our waiter was cool. He constantly came back to check on us. My friends walked in and said the placed smelled like WOOD POLISH, lol. I couldn't smell it. But apparently everyone else could. Took us about 15 minute to order, and by the time we were ready, our waiters shift was over, and he came to our table to let us know, and showed us our new waitress. We ordered our food, and she didn't even bring them out. A Manager ended up bringing us our food. She took forever to bring us our check. We spent more time waiting for our check and to process our cards, then we spent eating our food. And when we asked her to bring to-go boxes, she attempted to pack them for us (I'm picky with my food), so I reached for one of the boxes on the table to pack my own leftovers, and she reached over and snatched it back out of my hand and said she got it, and I said no, it's okay, i'll pack my own. Talk about rude service. 1 star for the manager and his AWESOME friendliness, and 1 star for the delish Cheddar Broccoli Sourdough Bowl Soup."
