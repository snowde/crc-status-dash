Cynthia L.,"Union City, CA",46,64,36,1.0,5/31/2011,"I enjoy the food here but the wait is always so long.  It doesn't matter when you go (time of day, day of the week).  They are always crowded.  I went with my 1 year old daughter and my cousin.  They sat us in the back room. The table that was available was not the best table.  It was so close to the surrounding tables.  People kept bumping into my daughter's high chair.  One waiter bumped her 3 times. Customers bumped her twice.  I moved her, but the place was so crowded and people were running around all over the place that it didn't matter where her high chair was placed.  The safest place for my daughter was in my arms or on top of our table.   I like the food, but don't like the environment or the fact that people (staff and patrons alike) do not pay any mind to little ones.  I'd say it's not kid friendly.  Our waitress forgot my daughter's juice, I had to ask her three times for her juice.   As far as food goes, the Avocado Wrap was really good and filling.  The Santa Fe salad was good."
Mandi G.,"Fremont, CA",4,5,,5.0,3/13/2014,Love the food here!! It was a long wait but well worth it! Our food came one of the orders was a mistake but the manager came over and handle very well she was professional and apologetic I'm pretty sure her name was Melissa. She was amazing and took care of us. I would have to say Bjs Newark has stepped it up with management and staff.
Tiffany M.,"Sacramento, CA",319,482,537,4.0,2/11/2009,"Despite the wait. Anything on their menu will not disappoint you. Beers and pizza, a must get when you do come. ALSO, you must get a PIZOOKIE!!!  A fresh baked, hot out of the oven, RICH cookie topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream and served in its own deep dish.  **I favor the white chocolate macadamia nut.**"
Alyssa R.,"Visalia, CA",28,61,33,3.0,12/24/2013,"Went for my office dinner and I've done a special event at bjs before and they didn't want to give us the special even menu because we didn't have a contract. That was a big inconvenience. I never needed a contract before, after talking to the manager we finally were Able to order. The waitresses are all rude and give attitude, the only nice people are the managers. We had one waitress come with a platter we didn't order and she got irritated because it wasn't ours and our actual waitress for the night started fighting with her because she was at HER table. They may need to hire more mature staff, it was somewhat a good night, but that was just because who I was with."
Paul S.,"Fremont, CA",4,2,,4.0,4/7/2014,"BJ's gets many bad reviews for their service, that has not been the case for me and my family. Granted if you get there for dinner most nights expect an hour wait..at least! Many times though they will serve free pizza to you in the lobby. Thinks thata a great idea. Last week went to a going away luch with co-workers. Our server Gabby was great. Very cordial and friendly without being phony. Most of the food is average, pizza is good..a little pricey. Anyway for a fun night out I can think of worse places."
Jessica H.,"San Ramon, CA",55,234,273,4.0,12/19/2010,"I really like this place. The food is good, love the chicken wings. I got the deep dish pizza, it was probably one of the best pizzas! I really love the Pizookie as well, got the double chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream. I have to say, pretty good combo, but I would try something else next time. Okay...this place got a 4 star since the service was ""too good"". The guy kept on bothering us, I felt he was like listening to my conversation with my friend too! I think the waiter is a bit bothersome."
Jeff Y.,"Fremont, CA",67,52,,4.0,1/21/2012,"This is way overdue I went twice and still haven't wrote a review till now! Going inside in Bj's Restaurant, holy crap it get really full at night, and you really have to go there a little early if not you're either outside freezing your butt off, or stand all night till you're call up (if longer than 30 minute forget about it) unless you're with your family of course. For appetizer I ordered flatbread pizza...both are california club, and grilled chicken pesto. Love the pizza! Main course  1st visit: BBQ Pull Porked Sandwich - very tasty 2nd visit: surprise it another pizza i'm like great, anyway I order the barbeque chicken pizza and the BJ Bacon Cheeseburger(my personal favorite for BJ and MOST RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!) No Dessert because I be full eating deep dish pizza FAIL! Food overall is good, but the price doesn't go down which suck, so you might have to bring a little bit of cash with you in case, I'll come back again if it with a family, or with group of friend!"
IC C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",3,15,24,4.0,2/2/2014,If you're coming here in a budget get the macaroni and cheese. Delicious. With ketchup.
Tran N.,"Kentfield, CA",156,281,17,3.0,10/9/2011,"The beer here is good, but I wish the food is more consistent. I always order the balsamic glazed chicken, but once in a while the chicken is over cooked and really dry.  I don't think the wait is too bad here, the estimate that the hostess gives is actually pretty good. Once in a while a server will give out some free pizza to people who are waiting."
Eddie M.,"Union City, CA",2,211,55,1.0,4/4/2013,"it was so crowded and the menu is not for us. Husband didn't like the beer, and he is a brewer so we wont be back.  Tables really close and crowded and noisy and good for young people I guess"
Katie N.,"San Francisco, CA",934,223,1227,1.0,10/7/2012,"When I lived in San Jose, I loved going to BJs at Oakridge, I think I went there so much I had a personal bartender.  With that said, I thought I'd give this one a try.  The BF and I came here on a Friday, since I called ahead, we were seated right away and that's where it became a 1 star.  Since I'm familiar with the menu, I just wanted to get some drinks started but nope, we sat there for 10 minutes, without a single acknowledgment.  We saw servers passing by and no one even stopped to say ""Hi"" or ""I'll be right with you,"" NADA.  There was a party of 4 that got service as soon as they sat down and we were sitting there for 15 minutes now!  It was like we were invisible!  I could have said something, or ask for a manager, but instead I lost my patience and I just decided to leave, don't think I will return to this BJs since it left a bad impression in my book."
David A.,"East Bay, CA",8,52,8,5.0,3/18/2014,BJ's is the most best restaurant to go to. They have amazing foods and a Pzookie man that's awesome and delicious. The pizza is good and very reasonable price. The burgers omg don't get me started about the burgers they hit the spot real good. Anybody want to come there try the Pzookie it's soo delicious. I want to come and eat there on my birthday.
Tiffany C.,"Fremont, CA",80,4,,4.0,1/29/2012,"I think by now I should be considered a regular here! Ever since I came back from college to the East Bay, I have gone to BJ's a ton just because there are very few places that are open late night on the weekends.  Venue is pretty big compared to the other BJ's I've been to. Place seems like a full house Thurs-Sat nights. If you come around 10/11PM there may be a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2-4 people. Some people may consider the food to be a bit on the expensive side but I think the prices are pretty fair for the portions you get. The food is average in my opinion and I usually order the California Chicken Sandwich with Crispy Thin Fries. BJ's also has a small bites menu. Small bites meaning good for 1.5 persons.  There is a wide selection of beers but since I'm a beer hater...I can't elaborate on that part of the drink menu. Drinks are average prices (~$8-9) and are usually above average in strength. I usually get the enlightened drinks to try and make me feel better about consuming my high calorie sandwich/fries. The ""Skinny Rita"" is okay and is supposed to be the strongest of the enlightened drinks.( I suggest mixing it with a straw before drinking it.) I tried the ""Mojito Lite"" once and I hated it...I suggest sticking with the regular mojitos. Since I come here so much, I kind of wish they had happy hour. (Unless I'm totally clueless...which is entirely possible...so they may have happy hour??) Considering the food and drinks the place is average. I gave an extra star just because it  has been my go to place for late night the past few weeks."
Shannon L.,"East Bay, CA",1354,2575,3295,2.0,11/14/2008,"Originally we made a reservation for 12, but only 6 of our party showed up.  So I'm surprised we still got such good treatment.  2 stars for that!  And even with only 6 people, we still had 2 servers!   I hate how inconsistent chains can be with their food.  Maybe it's because my standards for eating were much lower in college, but I remember the BJ's in Tustin being so wonderful to go to!  I always loved eating the avocado egg rolls, deep dish pizzas, and pizookies.   Today I split a medium size BBQ Chicken pizza with my friend and it was $20!  Outrageous.  There are 6 hefty-sized slices but the pizza came out lukewarm and kind of bland.  It ALMOST tasted microwaved....oh BJ's please tell me you do not microwave!!  That will put you on the same playing field as TGIF/Chevy's/Olive Garden.  I also tried the Oreo Pizookie with French Vanilla ice cream.  What makes this ""Oreo"" is that the whip cream is cookies 'n cream flavored.  The chocolate cookie was undercooked so it was also lukewarm and gooey, in a bad way.  I personally feel that Vanilla BEAN ice cream would've gone better... the French Vanilla threw it off a little. This place is your typical BJ's--big restaurant, sports bar with big screens, lots of traffic.  Service was surprisingly good and the food came out fast.  I would definitely recommend this for big groups but to be honest, if you're a chain restaurant and not good at the opening, I don't know how good you'll be from then on!"
Dawn L.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/14/2015,Ordered online lightly battered artichoke heart appetizers. They were heavily battered and almost burnt. Ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce on the side  & added side wedge salad with 1000 island dressing on side. The marinara sauce was not put on the side as requested and the spaghetti was cold. I did not like the sauce so the whole entree was thrown out. Instead of 1000 island dressing I received blue cheese which I dislike. Was anyone paying attention ?  I have been sick and was looking forward to a good meal but this was a complete waste of money. After paying the service fees etc. I have learned a very expensive lesson. Will not order at BJs again.
Kim H.,"Newark, CA",8,67,3,4.0,12/10/2013,"I've said it before, Newark isn't exactly a hotbed of excitement, but there are a couple of spots to have a sip and nosh in the area.  BJ's in Newark is a fantastic location on game day.  I went with a friend last Sunday to cheer on the 9ers and was blown away by the great grub and service.  Our server, Loriann was busting a move with the crowd but managed to keep the food and drinks coming and with one cool attitude and wonderful recommendations.  As a gluten-free diner, this place is one of the best, especially for casual dining...I had pizza and a pazookie!  Heavenly!  Great game day happy hour specials, great service, and really decent gluten-free food.  I'm a fan!"
Johnny G.,Hong Kong,240,102,333,2.0,6/14/2011,"I have been to BJ's multiple times, but I always can't really find anything to order.  Everything looks and sounds mediocre.  And sure enough, everything also tastes mediocre. I have tried, Fish and Chips, pork roast sandwich, a variety of pizzas and pastas, but nothing really stands out.  I do like the environment and it's a good place to have a drink with friends. Here is my biggest complaint.  They do not accept reservation for party of 10 and under.  What the heck.  I am trying to give them business and they don't want it. Tips: - I really don't know what is good here, maybe you can give me some tips or suggestions by writing a reply or sending me a message.  Haha. Overall: - Nothing special, probably will come back if friends are hanging out there."
Curtis C.,"San Jose, CA",166,28,22,4.0,9/14/2010,"With Mervyn's having shuttered their doors long ago, BJ's sits alone across from the Newpark Mall, a dessert oasis (more on that to come) in a literally deserted strip mall. Location aside, the parking lot is always full and the restaurant bustling, leaving  BJ's Brewhouse and my post happy hour waistline as two things that are definitely not suffering from recession. Speaking of dollars and scents, the smell of deep dish pizza and sinfully delicious pizookie wafting through the air as you step through the door will get your taste buds firing on all cylinders without doing too much damage to your pocketbook.  The key to a successful BJ's run is to go during happy hour, or to catch their weekday lunchtime specials, that way you have free reign on all their best menu items at cut-rate prices. Some of my favs on the menu include the sliders (pulled pork or angus beef, both are delicious) with fries, most of the pizzas, spinach artichoke dip w/ tortilla chips, and the egg rolls.  Of course no visit to BJ's is complete without ordering a pizookie. A word of warning to anyone who finds themselves sharing one of these bad boys with me, try to take any of the crispy cookie edge and I will parry carte the hell out of your spoon. I didn't take 4 weeks of fencing class at the Brea Community Center for nothing. Well actually I took it because it seemed random, and I'm random, but that's neither here nor there. Aside from the food, BJ's also serves their own line of decent brews. I've been known to imbibe my fair share of the Jeremiah Red and Piranha Pale Ale during many a happy hour. The combination of tasty bar food, good beer, and a gigantic wall of TVs playing every sporting event imaginable, makes BJ's a pretty righteous spot to catch a ball game. Hits: Happy hour specials, lunch specials, ginormous TV wall Misses: Crowds, somewhat limited bar seating at this location Words of wisdom: Arrive early if you want to snag a table in the bar, lunch specials are weekdays only, check out the late night happy hour if you missed the early one"
Bre E.,"Fremont, CA",6,36,9,5.0,11/26/2013,"Randomly decided to head out to Bjs tonight. Had a huge craving for their stuffed mushrooms. We were greeted warmly, & seated promptly. Our server, Jesse, was assisting our table quickly, & we had waters at our table before we even knew it. He was awesome. Very prompt & courteous. If you go ask for his section! He's really great."
Mary T.,"Hayward, CA",94,248,205,4.0,6/7/2011,"I like this BJ's location the best.  They are on point with their stuff and the food is great.  The chicken wings are the right size, not skimped on like the BJ's in Foster City.   Get their chicken wings with sauce on the side and their wedge cut fries as an appetizer to share.  Delish!  Hubby likes this location cause they have all beers on tap from all over the place.  Guys, what can you say?  So, if you are looking for a certain beer, you may be able to find it here."
