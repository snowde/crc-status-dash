James W.,"San Bruno, CA",1,3,,1.0,10/15/2017,Please don't allow customers to order online through this app and then cancel because you don't deliver. Very frustrating and misleading.
Danielle M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",112,54,25,2.0,2/26/2017,"I've been to Bjs many times, this location twice. Ordered the wedge salad every time I have come, and it never had parsley on it ! This time it was loaded with it . So I sent it back . Bartender Anthony was super cool about it , didn't care . Then the manager brandy came out and pretty much told me that next time I order a salad , I should specify that I don't want parsley. (Ok first of all how am I supposed to know it even comes on it if it doesn't mention it in the ingredients on the menu) it was just the fact that she went out of her way to come and say that to us, it was just a turn off . And then made it a point to say ""I'm not tryna argue with you"" no one was arguing we were just taken off guard by the fact she came out in the first place. And lastly wedge salads DO NOT have parsley on them so why I should I have to specify this??? Luckily for the fact that I was starving, the friendly guests and sweet bartender I stayed. Update :::: Just made a pick up order and came to realize that our avocado eggrolls were missing and when we called to verify a lady on the phone was very rude and condescending to us. Then I asked for her name and guess who it was... Brandy the same person that was rude the first time we came here! This Brandy lady should not be working in the food service industry because she has a unnecessary attitude."
Manny G.,"Union City, CA",170,600,803,3.0,4/7/2017,"Was not expecting much as I have been here before although decided to stop in after an event. We had asked for a couple of beers only to find out they did not have those bottles tonight. Food was just ok, We had the triple Decker club sandwich which I had asked them to hold the Mayo and sure enough that request went unnoticed. Server was on a break and the back up server did not come around so I scraped off the mayo myself. We also had the bison burger and it was quite plain. We did manage to score seating at the bar that was a plus. I received the level of service and quality of food I had expected. It seems that there is always a challenge in finding parking in the crowded lot."
Al G.,"Newark, CA",43,37,15,1.0,8/20/2017,"Okay... we eat here all the time and really never had any problems, until today. Our party of 6 entered the restaurant and there were 4 female individuals at the front desk. They were engaged in personal conversations with one of them slouched and leaning on he counter. We all walked up to them and they just looked at us. No hi, hello or any kind of welcome greeting. The only words from one of them was, ""6? How many kids?"" I said two kids and no response. Didnt say have a seat, over this way, we'll have your table ready in a moment, etc."" we all just stood there in front of them and looked at each other in confusion while we listened to the staff with their personal conversations. Then after a minute, one of them took us to a table for four. She pulled out the 6in extension and gathered chairs from another table to fit 6. I asked her if a booth was available and she said no. I said, we can wait for a booth if we have to because we wont fit 6 in a table designed for 4. And we are asian, so that was how small the table was. Anyways, the hostess had a solution * Put my 5yo in a high chair so it would save some space. Which i replied no, he wont fit in a high chair idiot. He is too big. Absurd solution.  So I told her, there is no way you can fit 6 ppl on a table for 4. So there are two options for you. So i told her two things. We can wait for a booth or we can eat somewhere else. Her response was, ""Well, it might be awhile for a booth."" I just told you we would wait. Geez! So I told her never mind and that we would eat somewhere else that has common sense and respect. I spoke to the manager and explained all this to him, as he looked at his 4-5 hostesses at the front, standing there doing nothing. He tried to keep us there and he didnt seem happy about what he was hearing from me and apologize. I explained to him that i just wanted to give him the feedback and how he addresses it with his staff, is his job. Unfortunate because i like their food. But we wont be going back for awhile. They were not busy at all. 1/2 the place was empty. So we are here at Jack's, waiting to be seated. But we were greeted with a smile when we walked in and handed a pager and also told the approximate wait time. Just as any restaurant would.  I"
Pavle R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,32,,2.0,10/12/2017,"This is a lush house, and the food leaves something to be desired.  I had the sweet potato fries, sliders, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts and a mini pizza.  All were pretty overcooked, over-seasoned and unattractive. The sliders looked the worst and served on a bed of crappy lettuce mixed in with my fries. Ugh! Nasty. Not recommended for the food.  The beer was a good selection and the service staff were nice, but the food... Ugh."
Brian M.,"Fremont, CA",4,4,,1.0,12/10/2017,"Great Service, Disappointing food.  I went in on Friday and ordered a large deep dish pizza after seeing how amazing it looked in the commercial and boy was I in for a let down. instead of a deep dish pizza I was treated to a flat crust and about 3"" of mostly unmelted cheese that was thrown on and hastily melted on top of it to fill out the pan and cover up the fact that the crust had problems This location must be having an issue with the crust right now as I heard from a co worker they experienced the same thing. The Server was great he tried a couple time to get it all melted at least until he was worried about the crust underneath getting too dark. I ended up being able to choke down 1 slice and a half of the worst pizza I have ever eaten if it can even be called a pizza and not just a bag of cheese on top of bread. The manager was very polite and took it off of my check but with the kitchen  being devious and instead of just saying there was a problem and cooking a new one just trying to cover it up pretty much ensures I will not be back to this location."
Jeremy S.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,1.0,2/26/2017,"Avoid that place. The worst restaurant I have been in the past 10 years. The food is horrible, and the service a joke. We were a group of 30 people, took 45 mins to get a drink. Run away, as fast as you can."
Gloria F.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/26/2017,"Our server had the sweetest demeanor and served with a smile!  BJ please give mad love to Amber!!! Now the reason for my yelp/rating is very POOR onsite management!  We were a party of 14.  We were seated in the overflow/large party section.  There were multiple very large parties with ONE server!  Who sets there servers up for failure like that? We had two orders that never came (including the birthday girl we were celebrating).  Appetizers, salads and main dishes all came out within 2 minutes of each other; our server was so apologetic and nervous that she accidentally knocked over a glass of ice.  We could not believe that she would not be given an help to assist with the multiple parties! To get to my point about the onsite manager Brandy(I believe that's her name)...she had an annoyed display all over her face that she had to walk over and speak with us...isn't that your job when you have unhappy customers??  She proceeded to make excuses instead of being proactive!  She stated how it was not her job to help the server.  We stated, we weren't asking her to help Amber BUT to get Amber some help!  That's what GOOD management does!  You ensure your team is set up to succeed so the customer experience is awesome and they want to return to your establishment! Just terrible management!!"
Miguel B.,"San Jose, CA",80,8,4,1.0,9/22/2017,Prob one of the worst... host attitude is just atrocious. 1.5 he wait with over 10 tables available for 2... wow! Good job keeping me as a customer.
Turd F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",11,57,15,2.0,4/7/2017,"BJ's is not like it use to be! Quality of food went down! The service was ok. The host was nice, bartender fast, but the different waitresses were slow, and didn't follow up on anything! They were real quick with the check though!! The main thing I really didn't like was the food! Calamari was a very skimp appetizer! There once huge fully loaded chicken baked potato was such a sad sight, It looked like a very small house sized potato that really won't fill u up! I'm glad the waitresses didn't check on my table! It stopped me from spending anymore money here! Sorry but I will not be going back or telling anyone about this place for a loooooooong time!"
Carolina F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",91,21,1,2.0,7/27/2017,Went in on a Wednesday night and my boyfriend and I both order the exact same thing. Steak (medium well) and sweet potatoes fries. My boyfriend steak came out perfect and mines was so over cooked and super dry. The server took it back and came back with another steak. The steak was bloody af !!! The cooks were just mocking me!!! I felt so bad for the server but he came back with the same last steak that was bloody but it was just cooked more. I've kept apologizing I felt so bad for him. At the end he gave us the check and I wrote a note and said the cooks need to learn how to cook steak and the sweet potato fries were old. The server is the only reason why my rate even got 2 stars. It should of really got 0. I think the manger should of came to talk to me to make sure I was satisfied. If the manger would of came I would of never wrote a bad review.
LeAza D.,"Hayward, CA",111,267,866,2.0,1/22/2017,"I just come for the beer only haha! Berry burst beer! Only one I get when the ohana and I go there. Also, use to get the baked potato too. But when o ordered it last time, it was smaller compared to before. (It was worth it). Now, I just get the salad and the beer, also the pazookie .. the burgers, pizza and pasta I don't really like or enjoy there at bjs. Idk just think they're salty for some reason. Only reason a 2 stars. It's because, the waitress kept talking to her damn friends the whole time. It's the waitress with the long hair with a ponytail. (Asian girl) super annoying. Didn't give her a damn tip at all. Even the table near us. Didn't like her either. Since the whole damn time she was with her friends. That sat at a table across from us. I even yelled at her. But she didn't seem to care."
Jules V.,"Danville, CA",27,119,52,5.0,3/25/2017,Always great service and super yummy. Our go to place. The Brussels sprouts w an amber ale and vodka martini strait up and stirred was a great marriage.  Next up super foods salad and shrimp tacos on the enlightened menu felt like we had super powers after from so much delicious food and healthy life saving properties. I am in love w this enlightened menu. I feel so zen like I can conquer the world after leaving here.
Ronald F.,"Daly City, CA",286,41,3,2.0,7/21/2016,"Ordered Gourmet 5 Meat. YAY DEEP DISH PIZZAZ RIGHT?  Well the taste was definitely there with the bacon, ham, and sausage. Unfortunately tomato/tomato sauce was not. Not sure where it went. Haven't gone to BJs for about 6-7 years but it seems like it will be a recurring factor. The so called deep dish pizza is more like  cheesy bread with a bunch and meat to distract you from the missing tomatoes. The blast of flavor did its job. I finished 3 slices before realizing it."
Loretta S.,"Fremont, CA",0,65,24,5.0,9/9/2017,"We love BJ's! We always have a fantastic time, and the foods and atmosphere are wonderful! B&L Sylvia Fremont, CA"
Zoe Y.,"San Francisco, CA",952,213,239,1.0,12/15/2015,"*REVIEW IS REGARDING TAKEOUT* Horrible. Last night, we ordered takeout and I was super disappointed. We called around 11:15 to order and pick it up. We ordered a side salad, penne with butter only, French fries, and the Santa Fe spring rolls. Anytime I've dined at BJ's they have always done penne with butter, no problem. Clearly it was an issue here. They charged us for a Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, even though I was not getting any chicken or any sort of meat. As if that wasn't annoying enough, when we got home I opened it and there was literally 15 noodles in the whole thing. The salad also looked half full and not what it should have been."
Candy R.,"Newark, CA",61,52,37,1.0,8/24/2017,"I would give this place zero stars if I could! My family and I came on a weekday at 12:30 and sat down for 15 minutes without anyone even acknowledging us, giving us water, or taking our order. No one even blinked when we walked out the door and told them the problem. Don't come here"
Bill G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",42,763,51,2.0,3/9/2017,"Huge menu, great beer selection, but slow service and this place gets crazy busy. Plus, the pizza isn't that great."
Mighty M.,"Fremont, CA",1,79,70,4.0,7/22/2016,Just finished eating here. One of the circle of restaurants we go to near our place. Was going to take out one star for slow service but my food was good.  The service is alright and like an average busy food chain.  On a Thursday our wait for dinner was not bad at around 10-15 minutes. Ordered calamari and avocado egg rolls for appetizer and both are very good. My kids all ordered black and bleu burger as their faves here.  Sometimes they get the pizza.   I got southern fried chicken which is not in the menu but very good and my fave here.  Sometimes I get the spaghetti and the loaded nachos is also good here. My kids always get the pizzookie for dessert.
Monique M.,"San Jose, CA",3,8,9,5.0,11/9/2016,"Went to the restaurant for a late dinner after 9pm on a weekday and it was pretty packed! My friend and I waited about ten minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad. Service at this location is usually meh, but we were blown away by our server, Monique (we had the same name, HA)!  She was absolutely attentive and always bringing us a refill on the drinks and she did a good job checking up on my friend and I if we needed anything else! She was super friendly and it looked like she was happy to work there. GREAT SERVICE!  The food was absolutely AMAZING! I always get a deep dish pepperoni extreme. SO YUMMY. My friend and I got a medium, which has 8 pieces - each of us split it so we ate 4 each! We also decided to try the mozzarella sticks which were pretty tasty as well! MAKE SURE YOU SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! BY DESSERT I MEAN THE PIZOOKIE, DUH!  If you don't know what a Pizookie is, it's basically a huge oven baked warm delicious cookie with TWO HUGE scoops of ice cream to top it off! GOOD FOR SHARING! They have different flavors for each Pizookie and a thing called a ""Pizookie trio"" where you can try 3 mini pizookie flavors for about $10 dollars! I got the chocolate chunk flavor, UGH. SO MUCH GOOEY CHOCOLATEY GOODNESS!  I will definitely be back again soon! Especially for the PIZOOKIES! I want to try all the flavors!"
