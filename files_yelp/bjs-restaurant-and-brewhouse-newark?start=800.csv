Donna L.,"Hayward, CA",369,65,147,5.0,8/16/2010,"I'm a regular here so this review is long overdue! BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is one of the best restaurants I ever ate at! This restaurant  is usually packed but you can call ahead to be put on the wait list. And if you drop in on a busy day/night, general wait time averages from 30-40 min wait or longer. On several occasions, I had to wait 30-40 minutes for a table but it was so worth it! Some of the dishes I had tried and would recommend is the Cajun Pasta, Chicken Alfredo, Baked Potato, Pizza, Turkey Club Sandwich and the desserts of course! So tasty and delicious! The portions for these meals are much larger. As for the price for the meals, you can get tasty meals between $8 - $15, very affordable considering the large portions! Customer service may be a bit slow because this restaurant is so popular and packed but the server is generally kind and try to do their best to accommodate you! If you haven't tried the food here, you're missing out! BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is perfect for both small and large groups, the food is delicious and comes in large portions and is extremely affordable! * * * * * FIVE STARS * * * * *"
Lorrie M.,"San Jose, CA",3761,2986,262,4.0,2/1/2009,"I always have a great experience at BJ's so I really can't say too many bad things about this place except that it seems to be the common theme at all BJ's when they get busy, the service just DROPS. This is sad because honestly they get busy a lot and it would be nice if they had apt waiters that knew what to do. Other than that I have to say the food here for a chain restaurant is FANTASTIC. I always get their delicious chili cheese fries or sliders, and their jambalaya is one of a kind.  Finally, as I'm sure everyone knows ... PIZOOKIE ... white chocolate macadamian nut HEAVEN ... *do not disturb... I am eatingz*"
Rachel A.,"Fremont, CA",4,14,,1.0,3/31/2015,"We ordered to go from BJ's and won't be going back anytime.  Tortilla soup was salty to the point that it was inedible; clam chowder had a fishy taste to it, also inedible; the two sandwiches we ordered were barely mehh; the fries were the skimpiest side I've ever seen.  All that for $35.  Never again.  Not sure what happened, this place used to be pretty decent."
Richard G.,"Los Altos Hills, CA",176,448,468,4.0,6/27/2009,"One of my clients suggested a late dinner and wanted to try out the new BJ's in Newark. Maybe because it was a Tuesday, we did not encounter any of the wait times that my fellow yelpers encountered. I think they may be a victim of their popularity in the local area. The place was very full for a Tuesday night. We were seated right a way and our drinks arrived promptly with our salad and soup. I found my salad to be very fresh and crispy and just the right amount of dressing. Our server announced that she was taking a short break and announced who would be covering for her. I was very impressed as I do not recall anyone doing this before. Her replacement server made sure we got our entrees of roasted chicken and I ordered the Salmon which was cooked to perfection and served with wonderful vegetables and rice, a good selection. They really did a wonderful job of keeping our glasses full and we were too stuffed to order any dessert.  So there you have it, great service, upscale ambiance, and fantastic food. Too bad I was driving as I would like to have sampled their home made brews. The home brewed Root Beer was a wonderful addition to my meal and my client really enjoyed the Strawberry Lemonade. They have many High Definition TVs to keep up on the Sports scene."
jack l.,"San Mateo, CA",24,74,78,5.0,3/1/2013,"The mark of a great restaurant is not just putting food out fast, but puting out top quality food and making your customers happy in the process. This is precisely what the staff here has done for me and my family. Don't get me wrong here.  The place is not perfect because the kitchen had issues but they more than made up with it great food and service.     We came to Bj's on a busy Friday night and got seated within 20 minutes. We were greeted by our server Ravinder (forgive the spelling if it is wrong) who was cordial and friendly. She took our order and brought our drinks with a smile. We happily went about drinking our drinks and talking away. About the time we noticed that our food was not coming our server and kitchen manager Phillip arived and told us that they had run out of sauce and had to re-fire our food. To make up for the error they comped us appetizers and coffee while we waited for our new dishes to be prepared. We were more than happy to accept and in no time our dishes arived and we were both happy and well fed. Evidence of the care taken to prepare the food was evident in the food that was delivered. Attention to detali was taken in the plating and the shrimp scampi was cooked perfectly. This place has cemented a place as one of my all time favorite hangouts.  They handled an awkward situation with geace and a passion for quality so I give this place my best review."
Maya M.,"Fremont, CA",50,21,6,1.0,12/8/2014,"Made reservations and Came here with a group of about 8 for my friend's birthday dinner. WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN A RESTAURANT. A friend of mine wasn't very hungry so she got two appetizers, her calamari came out completely cold so they sent it back. They also got avocado egg rolls so while they were waiting for their calamari they were about to take a bite and a nice big hair was sticking out of it. Those got sent back as well. On top of that when the calamari came out we realized they re-fried the SAME calamari. So it was literally like hard rubber. We just said forget it and we don't even want it anymore just take it off the tab. On top of all THAT, we had all had our entrees out and my boyfriend was still waiting for his. At first it wasn't a big deal but after we asked over 3 times they brought the manager Rich or Rick out whatever his name was and he showed the slightest sincerity or care at all. He was not at all apologetic or seemed to care. So they're probably just used to giving terrible service. He just kept telling us ""it'll be right out"" ""it should be out soon"" (it was just a small lunch entree by the way, just a piece of fried chicken on some mashed potatoes) you would think it was the most extravagant thing on the menu. By this time almost all of us were getting out plates taken away because we were all finished and then they finally brought out his damn dinner. We came to have a Birthday dinner together with our friend and he didn't even get to eat at the same time as us. And on top of THAT we told the waiter it was our friend's birthday and he started taking care of our checks already. When we got our checks we told him again and he brought out a mini pizzookie for him. The only thing that justifies them even getting one star was that the food tasted decent."
Jill S.,"Indian Trail, NC",3,13,1,3.0,6/5/2012,Really liked this restaurant.  We waited for 20 minutes for a table... and the magical thing about it... They said 20 minutes... and it was actually only 20 minutes... It was refreshing...  The only thing I could say negativly about my experiance is that the menu was a bit intimidating... there was so much on it.  I ordered the Calzone and my associate ordered the Spaghetti.  Both were great.  Desert was to die for... I cant remember what it was called... But it was a cookie with icecream... Pazzok?  maybe? Anyway... I would go here again... and just might tonight.
Kevin B.,"Fremont, CA",61,75,33,4.0,8/13/2013,Love bjs....blonde beer is where its at...food is delicious...a little pricey though...but love the staff and bartenders...
Ashish A.,"Fremont, CA",3,2,,3.0,2/18/2014,"The ambience is nice, so is the location. But the service sucks. Their waiter/waitress are either too burdened or overloaded with work."
Louisa L.,"Castro Valley, CA",153,315,229,3.0,6/30/2011,"Try to avoid coming here with a big group of people.....because you won't get your food until you are hungry to death.... Food is just average, service is alright......but with the wait for food.....IT TAKES FOREVER! Even the bill took like 15 mins to come.....zzzZZzzzZZzzzz.... I like how rich their clam chowder is, but at the same time it's really salty. I've tried it a few times and most of the times it's very salty. Appetizers are usually nice. Lunch menu is just so-so. My co-worker voted their fish taco to be the best, may be i should give it a try next time!"
Farzana V.,"Fremont, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/4/2012,"This place does not even deserve the 1 star yelp makes me put!!!!! I was burnt 3 times by this restaurant (i should have stopped at the first time). NEVER order take out and if you do make sure you open ALL your food items and check.  I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with extra mashed potato (which they charged btw) and surprise! no potato AT ALL. Ordered extra sauce another time and wouldn't you know it.... no sauce at all.... The third time I actually checked to make sure they had sauce but did not open the container and got TARTAR sauce with chicken ....Thank for charging extra for nothing BJs.  I have been to 3 other branches in Foster City, San Jose and Cupertino and all of them have been consistent with great service but this one just does not seem to care.  That was the last order I ever give them."
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,4.0,6/25/2013,I think people are being a little harsh on this place. The food is exactly what I expected for a brewhouse style place and the lunch specials were fairly cheap. The beer was good and the service great as well. I enjoyed it.
J C.,"Richmond, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/18/2012,"I came here for my cousin's birthday at the beginning of October. Note that I only stayed because it was his birthday and I wasn't going to ruin it because of someone's terrible ethics or lack of manners. When I walked in to reserve a table, the server barely acknowledged me. No thank you, no welcome to BJ's. Nothing. I let that go. If she was having a bad day and couldn't suck it up, whatever. Later on while we were outside waiting, my cousin (being the optimistic, silly guy that he is) says something along the lines of ""oh she must think I'm cute"" jokingly. I look over and it's that same girl with the attitude working the take out counter staring at us. A few minutes later one of her coworkers comes over and she says something to him and they both stare, no smile. It honestly felt like a high school exchange. I called after my 24 hour shift two days after the incident. Asked to speak to a manager regarding what happened, because it was definitely uncalled for. No one called back. Thanks for that BJ's management. Really professional. The kicker? I would've just let this go because it's not worth it, but I find it really odd that I woke up with an upset stomach and experienced the symptoms of food poisoning during my 24 hour shift. I think it's pretty ridiculous for anyone to have this behavior, especially when the customer has done NOTHING wrong and nothing to you. There are plenty of other people who can suck up whatever they're going through and work and actually be thankful for a job and show it. I've been spit at/on, assaulted, had every obscenity yelled at me, whatever you can think of on the job, and you know what? I still suck it up and do my job because that's what I was hired to do. Not act like an immature brat for no reason at all.  I know I'm just one customer and I wont affect your business, but I'll never be back to this location. My apologies for the lengthy review, but I had to let it out somewhere."
Jamie H.,"Hayward, CA",0,24,1,4.0,1/17/2014,"Hubby and I came here for the first time in December..they were packed but seated us within 15 mins. Being that busy I expected to wait, but was pleasantly surprised when we didn't. They brought drinks right away, appetizers and the main dish in a very timely fashion and we had eaten and were gone in 50 minutes which was great since we had to go pick up our kids from the babysitter. The food was great, hot and yummy and my hubby likes the root beer. It was clean, including the bathroom and the decor is nice... and I have to say, it's obviously popular, it was hopping. Was very impressed all the way around. Two thumbs up from us, taking the kids next!"
Aishwarya G.,"Fremont, CA",87,114,143,4.0,7/29/2013,"Best beginnings is good, liked the santa fe chicken"
Mitty C.,"Fremont, CA",1113,390,184,4.0,6/23/2011,"Pizookies are amazing! The happy hour appetizers are decently priced as well, though the alcohol prices really aren't marked down much but given the Newark/Fremont area, there aren't that many options for late night drinking anyway so I'm going to let that slide.   The food is usually pretty decent, although I have been there on some occasions when the food could have used more attention by the chef. There seems to be an inconsistent dinner rush that isn't wholly dependent on the day of the week at all. Just keep in mind if you're going with a large party, to arrive earlier if possible cause you'll probably be waiting.  $4 mini pizzas during happy hours are delicious."
Sammy C.,"East San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,10,1,5.0,2/10/2014,Food is really good.excllent customer service .this is only my favorite place where I  goes every week .
Carina R.,"Newark, CA",0,535,,3.0,5/24/2013,"BJ's is me and the hubster's go-to place when we can't think of anywhere interesting to go to eat. It's usually pretty lively, there's beer, and decent food. That's really all we want in a place to chill at on a Friday after a long week at work. The wait is usually at least 30 minutes (sometimes an hour), but it's not that bad because we usually go to the bar and have a few beers before we get seated. Sometimes we'll get lucky and we're able to sit at the bar or at the bar tables for a while before, too. Sometimes not - the bar can be really crowded. The beers BJ's has on tap are pretty good. And if you don't like their beers they always have outside beers on tap and beers in the bottle. Their mixed drinks are pretty good, too. There's something for everyone when it comes to drinks. Their food is hit or miss. The apps are pretty good. Salads are too. I usually get the pizza and that's always delicious. But some of their entrees are either really good or just so-so. I would stick to the burgers and sandwiches. Everything else, to me, has always been not that good. Every time I get something other than the pizza or a salad - like a baked potato, chicken, fish, etc. I have been let down. I usually regret ordering that and think I should have gotten the pizza like I usually do. Their service is so-so as well. Its hit or miss. You either get someone who is super on it or someone who ignores you for most of the time. BJ's is alright. Not the best, but pretty darn good."
Brenda H.,"Fremont, CA",45,543,13,3.0,8/26/2010,"I came here with my 5 cousins and brother to have dinner.  It was probably the first time we sat down immediately.  So that alone made me pretty happy.   It was weird.  We were actually helped by 3-4 different servers.  We had 1 main server, but she was sometimes there....sometimes not.  Kinda strange.   Anywhoo, i had the 10in thin crust gluten pizza...all veggies with no cheese.  it was pretty tasty.  i'd definitely order that again.   The three starts is because NOTHING HERE IS HEALTHY.  if you are conscious about what you put in your body, go someplace else.  Otherwise, have a beer.  Invite some friends.  And have a nice casual time."
C.C. S.,"Union City, CA",1,30,7,3.0,8/5/2014,"Ok so my family and I were looking forward to a nice sunday dinner together. We decide to come to this restaurant. We've eaten here before when it first opened and had a great experience. Not so much this time. Perhaps it was a bad night but there is no excuse to just ignore your customers. Like i said it was a sunday night around 8pm and the place was packed, no big deal. We wait our turn and were seated in a decent amount of time.  10-15 minutes later and still no one comes to even ask if we want water. Waitress looks our way but never even says hi or one moment. Nothing! We wait longer and then we notice people who arrived after us are getting their orders taken. Wth? Ok we decide to leave and the gals at the desk say thanks for coming. Uh you obviously forgot you just sat us down. Anyhoo back in the car and on the hunt for food at 9pm. I could have just stayed home and cooked. Again maybe just a bad night but i  am not in a hurry to return here. Im being generous with 3 stars. Ijs."
