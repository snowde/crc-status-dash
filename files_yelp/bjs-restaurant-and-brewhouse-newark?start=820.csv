Steve B.,"Fremont, CA",68,34,7,5.0,1/4/2014,I always have a good experience when i come over to this BJ's. I love their pizza and their big screen tv's. Did i mention the beer? No? Prettt awesome!! The only thing is that sometimes their tv's have no volume so hard to totally get into the games.
Big S.,"Concord, CA",173,33,94,1.0,3/9/2013,Recently I visited the restaurant in Newark and wished I had not gone.  The food is good and the beer is fantastic.  The problem is the service and the management.  It was not packed in anyway and you can see they had so many people on the payroll doing anything but servicing the few people that were paying customers.  It got so bad the security guard in the parking lot started ushering people to the tables while the hostesses were chatting away.  Any special request was meeting with rude looks and I was really wishing I had not been there.  It will be the last time I ever set foot in a BJ restaurant again.  I don't expect people to do anything but service the customer and I guess that is asking too much.
Greg H.,"Fremont, CA",327,167,16,4.0,7/10/2011,"This place is always great to eat with friends and or family. I come here often and every time I'm greeted by friendly hostesses and get served by chill waitresses. I firmly believe that every meal should be completed with either their root beer or cream soda. But i mean, that's just my opinion. this place is awesome, hands down"
Leslie P.,"Torrance, CA",70,1012,1212,3.0,7/5/2010,"There's not many restaurant&bars in the area. they are mostly in fremont or in union landing in UC. So this one is pretty popular. The food is a-okay. like i said for another review, pizookies are O.R (=overrated). this is the only BJs that i've had HH at, and it's relatively a good deal. deals on food & drinks."
Mike D.,"Hollister, CA",0,31,,1.0,2/14/2013,Recent i decided to give this place another chance and I called in advance to reserve a table for a party of 8. We were all there 5 minutes early and they said that they did not have the reservation and they expected us to wait 45 minutes? This really upsets me as the food has always been really good but the service here is terrible. I took the group to Elephant Bar and was seated right away. I am so over this place.
David H.,"Palo Alto, CA",21,42,7,4.0,5/31/2012,"Start it off with some avocado rolls and end it with the ""mi-SOOOO good"" salmon... you won't be disappointed. You can get the pizookie if you dare, but I'd make sure I had someone to share it with before I ordered it for one. Long waits... about half an hour on average, so it's a good idea to send a sacrificial lamb to get signed in."
Kimberly L.,"San Jose, CA",88,315,345,2.0,9/3/2013,"Came here on July 4th. There was a bit of a wait. I thought the quality of their food would be the same as their San Mateo location, but it was not. I go to their San Mateo location often for lunch and they are always on point. This location seems to be lacking on service. Also the food was just alright."
Izel P.,"Fremont, CA",164,44,7,2.0,9/24/2012,"I used to really love this restaurant but the service lately has been lacking. Last few times I was here, service was extremely slow. One time, we had a waitress who did not seem to know what she was doing. She didn't check up on us, she forgot our waters, it took forever to get our entrees after we have been eating our appetizers for 30-40 mins! We were so hungry we ate most of the appetizer and barely touched our entrees because we were getting full. It also took forever to get our check. Ridiculous! Also, prices on some menu items have gone up so I've been turned off to this place. I only look forward to coming here because of my love for the pizookie."
Brett P.,"San Ramon, CA",60,62,17,4.0,7/19/2013,Grabbing dinner and pazookies with friends. The great white is super yum! Pazookie platter is the best!
Kameelah C.,"Oakland, CA",2,11,15,5.0,10/5/2013,"Today me and my hubby went to this BJ's for the first time. And I can tell you that it will not be the last time. The food was great and we received exceptional service from our server named April! She is the bomb, Everytime we come here we must sit in her section! More restaurants need better employees like April!"
Laura H.,"Livermore, CA",0,20,1,4.0,1/15/2012,"I go to BJ's at least once a week.  The staff is friendly and efficient; the place is well managed; and the food is quite a good value - you get a good amount of food of good quality at a decent price.  The only drawback to BJ's is how noisy it is - but that's to be expected in a sports bar. My favorite dishes are the Jambalaya, the gourmet mac & cheese (deliciously spiced up with chipotle), the wedge salad, and, of course, the pizzas.  And they also have some excellent desserts - the pazookies are delicious and so are the beignets.  So save room!"
D Y.,"San Jose, CA",46,1039,190,5.0,8/11/2013,this time we had: 1. crispy calamari - quite good. it came with both marinara and ranch sauce 2. maui glazed porkchop with greens and potatoes - quite good too 3. barbeque bison burger with slaw - quite good too 4. sparkling raspberry drink - decent.
Rochelle B.,"Fremont, CA",16,10,18,1.0,9/23/2011,"Food good. Beer good. Pizookie good. Service........ SUCKS! So bad, I think I am done with BJ's. If I really have a craving, I will be driving to San Mateo because at least you get treated with respect at that one. The Fremont BJ's is horrible. It all starts with the hostesses. There is too many of them up there, and they always seem to forget about people. It has happened on 3 occasions to me or someone I know that the hostesses started seating other people who came in after us, first. Then being rude about it until they realize they forgot you. And they always say ""oh, we called you"". Uh, no you didn't idiot. We were sitting right in front of you seeing how long until you notice us sitting here.  P.S. Don't order mixed drinks. They will tell you the order a double if you realize there is not a full shot of liquor in the drink."
Tracy L.,"Carol Stream, IL",585,107,86,4.0,5/24/2011,"I come here every time i come to california for two reasons: 1) POTATO SKINS ARE DELICIOUS!!!!! 2) pizooki's are freaking amazing meal-wise they have a lot to choose from, even a calorie count menu if you really want to know what's going in your body. fish tacos were ok, ribs and chicken is great, the personal pizzas are good because they have  a soft crust, the burgers are really good too i had the grilled burger melt (that's the same idea AND better than the frisco melt from steak n shake! haha!) but let me get to the good stuff: potato skin appetizer: GET THEM. they're not scraped so thin like some potato skins, they actually have something to bite into, melted cheese, bacon bits, and ranch and sour cream dipping sauce?! hell yeah! pizooki: get your own, get a tasting platter to pick 3 flavors, or get a party platter that's the size of a pizza with like 8 sccops of ice cream piled high on it!! (share that with 5 or more) can't go wrong with any of the flavors, the newest one is RED VELVET...orgasm. i'll admit the ghirardelli choc on choc is really really really chocolatey.   happy hr's awesome! bartender let me taste beers all i wanted before i bought one! they brew some beers just try them, but they also have a nice selection for girly drinks too.  ALWAYS a go to spot, has huge TV's and little tvs everywhere, great spot to watch games and hang out"
Andrew N.,"Newark, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/9/2015,We were served by Mark at the takeout on friday night. He was pretty awesome and helpful. It also helped that he looked nice! 10/10 service. Would come again.
Eve B.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",1,10,,4.0,1/6/2014,"I decided to give this place another try after getting in contact with management and I'm very glad I did. And before you wonder why I gave 4 stars to this place while other unique places get less than, I'm basing these reviews on what the places are, not in comparison to other. Apples and oranges obviously. Moving on... The service was much better. Our waiter was much more friendly and attentive even though it was much more busy than before. The food was definitely worth it this time around. I just know now to only order pizza. The only issue is that I ordered a giant pizookie for my friends and myself to share. I think it was so big that it cooked unevenly in places so some parts seemed hard and stuck to the pan and other parts were under cooked. Still tasty though. Overall, 3.5 stars but I'll round it up. ^_^"
Nancy T.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",620,125,19,3.0,5/19/2013,"I've been here twice, once for their pizookie which was really yummy and the second time I went with my boyfriend for dinner. For appetizers I had the stuff spinach mushrooms which were really tasty! Unfortunately when I got to the main course.. I was very disappointed. I ordered the shrimp scampi and it had no flavor. The garlic bread was the only thing with flavor that was on that plate.. It was pretty much a plate full of pasta and bread crumbs with no flavor.. There was a good amount of shrimp in it, the only plus.. My boyfriend got one of the pizza's which wasn't bad but when he asked our waiter for parmesan cheese for his pizza.. the waiter never brought it. Overall my experience was not so good.. may come back to try something else or just for the pizookie. 3 stars for the stuffed mushrooms and the pizookie."
Mai C.,"San Francisco, CA",12,67,2,3.0,6/23/2013,"I've been to this place a number of times, and it's always the same. The food is not bad, but the service is slow. We had to wait more than 15 minutes for anything and it took a while for our server to come around for us to order anything else. I had to ASK for a refill of my raspberry iced tea. It sounds stupid but I'm used to servers just refilling it before I ask. Overall, the food was good. The service just needs help."
kara o.,"Pleasanton, CA",63,25,,2.0,11/12/2010,"It's never a good sign to go a restaurant and see someone throwing up in front.    I should have left at that point, buy unfortunately I stayed.  I wasn't expecting much in the way of food, even though I had enjoyed BJs in San Mateo.   I had a turkey burger which was good, but the fries tasted like they were made in old grease.   The server was very friendly, but the service was incredibly slow.  Perhaps they need more staff.   PS the rest of the strip mall this is I is completely boarded up.  I won't make the drive again."
Jim C.,"San Jose, CA",39,238,117,3.0,1/28/2011,"Hung out with my buds here, I tried the Grand Cru, good at first, but too sweet for my taste, I prefer their blonde b/c I'm a gentlemen. :-P Not sure what one of the lady ordered, it was some fruity cider, pass.  Food was non eventful, in fact, I can't recall what we ate. We all finished and no one got sick, I guess I had a pint or two too much.   Yeah, grab a brew and bond with your pals, watch a game, that's about it, I wouldn't come here for fine dining."
