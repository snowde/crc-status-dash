Nancy T.,"Newark, CA",1,4,,2.0,12/20/2011,"The customer service here sucks balls.  I've been here plenty of times for dinners, birthday dinners, lunches, and happy hour. If it wasn't for their awesome Jerry burst drinks, I wouldn't ever come back.  Their wait time during dinner is horrible.  The hostesses seem to always be confused and unwilling to do their jobs.  Orders have been wrong numerous times.  Their happy hour sucks. I'd rather go somewhere else for happy hour. The BJ's in Cupertino is 100000000x better than this one. Their customer service and cooks are on top of it. managers walk around making sure everything is okay and that you get your food on time. Newark BJ's needs to learn from them."
Paul G.,"Pescadero, CA",18,293,4,1.0,2/23/2013,"AWFUL....This is the third time I have tried this franchise.  This time, we went to celebrate a birthday.  We made reservations for 15 and thought we were good to go.  First they had no reservation, The birthday girl of 93 years, had to wait an hour for a salad.....Everyone else had their food.  The waitress said, ""I only have two hands.""  We got a hamburger that we did not order, so the waitress took it back, and brought us back the same hamburger that was already cut in half, on a new bun.  Our waitress never came back to refill our water glasses, or bus the old cocktail glasses that were building up on our table.  The manager did come by and apologize, and offer to remove the hamburger off the bill.  Oh, then they brought us plates and silverware for the birthday cake, and the silverware was soiled and dirty, very gross.  Gorden Ramsey should visit this place....Do not waste your time at this place"
Rafael N.,"Oakland, CA",22,152,12,3.0,1/17/2011,"Just an average BJ??? Hey that's OK with me.  Love the beer selections and the decor is palatable. Nice size TV above the bar. A bit of a wait cuz it gets busy. Menu is huge....  The best memory so far is a nice deep dish pizza and shrimp tacos.  Worst memory was the donut thick battered Fish n Chips.  Overall, a spot to get ur beak wet n munch n watch some tube deserves a 3."
David F.,"Union City, CA",1375,159,2161,3.0,10/11/2010,Service is hit or miss here after being seated in a not so crowded bar area our waitress was assigned our table and another table all the way across the building.  We waited 15 minutes to be served not a good experience.  In the past we have had hit or miss experiences here but it is close to home and the good out weighs the bad experiences I guess.  Plus nobody can touch the Oreo Pazookie!
Sue E.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/24/2015,"food quality  variable - sometimes great (like their Brewmaster hamburger) but the following visit barely warm (ditto  accompanying fries).  At such times, it's obvious that they're understaffed with prepared food just waiting to be picked up and served.    much depends, of course, on the chefs as well - and, again, a great difference as to what you get in quality and quantity (like toppings on a pizza).. but for this area, it's one of the better places to go so my friends and I are regulars."
Lisa T.,"Hayward, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/20/2014,"Waited over an hour to get 1 of the 2 salads that we ordered.  The server saw that I didn't have a meal and didn't say anything, I assumed they were going to bring it out right after.  About 10 minutes later, she finally comes to ask how we're doing and I asked about my salad.  I'm sure she forgot to put the order in. Instead of apologizing, she just said, it's coming right now .  Terrible service. We also asked for a coffee that she didn't bring for an hour and when she finally did, she didn't bring sugar until asking for it twice.  When I finally told her forget about bringing my salad and the sugar for the coffee and just take it off of our bill, she said to wait to ask her manager.  Another wait, then the manager told her that they'd take the salad off the bill and give to us for take out which wet declined.  The manager did not come to talk to us until we finally had to ask.  We didn't even order dessert, which is the main reason we wanted to go there.  We will not be.visiting this location again, terrible service."
Cliff X.,"Fremont, CA",543,32,,4.0,9/30/2010,"Keyword - Brewhouse.  First timers should try the beer sampler. they have 12% BEER! my all time fav is Jeremiah Red.  RootBeer is also pretty Rad.  Pizza - I recommend Mediterranean. Server - I recommend you sit at the bar. You'll be sitting there for a good 30 minutes longer for your dinner if you got waited on at the tables. Slow OR Busy. I think Bj's trains their servers to take that extra 30mins longer.  Overall - Nice place, nice people, nice food, nice BEER, SLOW service (except bar)  OH! and they have Rooster Sauce."
LPthang S.,"Berkeley, CA",30,254,65,1.0,8/8/2013,"I had a very horrible experience on Saint Patrick's Day. I ordered a pizza with out onions and it came out 45 minutes later with everything on it. Our waitress was very apologetic about it because she had the correct order. So, she sent it back to be corrected and it still came out wrong. So, I spoke with the manager and she had a nasty attitude. She said,' she would comp us half off since half was wrong! lol That is so crazy, and walked off. Thanks to the head chief who came and apologized with a gift card and wanted us to give them a second chance but, I must say ill pass..."
Corinna S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",287,37,7,3.0,9/15/2014,"let me start off by saying that pizookies are heaven in cookie form and that you have not lived until you've tried one. pizookies are essentially the only reason i would come to bj's. that's not to say that their food isn't good because it definitely is! it's just not really anything special. also, it's hit or miss when it comes to getting a good server. some are super friendly and patient, while others are grumpy and sometimes even rude. i usually come here with large parties and i think large parties truly test the skills of server; skills which, quite frankly, bj's servers often lack. for that reason and for their lack of extraordinarily good food, i only give this place 3 stars. i'd give it less if it weren't for their delicious pizookies."
Amanda M.,"Newark, CA",10,45,2,4.0,1/12/2011,"Just have to say, I love the pizza here, the mini is just big enough for me! But, I fallow it up with a pizookie. So I leave feeling pretty stuffed!  I don't really like the parking lot, its kind of cramped, and if Mervyns was still around the parking would be even worse. The inside is nice, lots of nice decor. If you're a sports fan there are like, 5 flat screen tvs playing a variety of games. They're a little distracting in my opinion. Ive never had to wait more than 10 mins for a table, even on a busy night. The staff is great. I've always had a good server. Over all I'd recommend going here with friends, family or even a date ;-)"
Nicole G.,"Austin, TX",473,72,1,4.0,4/4/2011,"Order ""Drink Like That"" - it has a lot of good stuff in it! I also love the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Pizzookies! Expect to wait, because this place is always packed!"
Mariah J.,"Hayward, CA",1,14,,2.0,11/15/2014,"the appetizers are still pretty good but the last few times I've been here the pizza hasn't been very good, there isn't much sauce and not very much toppings so it's been mainly bread and ya the breads good but thats not what I ordered I would like some pizza toppings with my pizza please."
Danielle S.,"Sacramento, CA",59,4,1,5.0,7/26/2013,"Surprised to see that there was a wait on a Thursday evening, but we were still seated pretty quickly. We had great food and great beer!! But the best part of the night was are great waitress Shantay !! She made our night great!! She had made sure were were happy and our drinks were always full !! She went out of her way to have a great conversation with us even thought it was a pretty busy night !! Ask for Shantay if you want to have a wonderful experience !!"
Shequita C.,"Livermore, CA",2,15,,4.0,8/13/2010,"Yes, this place is kinda like a Cheesecake Factory/Elephant Bar. However, I'm not sure which came first, the Cheesecake or BJs.  I was a little skeptical that a beautifully decorated warehouse like place can be placed around commerial building suicide.   The food was good,  The portion size of my shirmp pasta and my friends chicken salad was bountiful.  One thing I didn't care too much for was their summer special - spiked Arnold Palmer.  Next time, I'll stick with the brewski.  I did have a belgium beer that was great.  Lindeman Framboise.   Sweet!"
Jennifer H.,"Fremont, CA",0,14,,1.0,8/10/2010,"This place is trying way too hard to be like The Cheesecake Factory. First off, I really applaud them for being located in a completely deserted spot. Customers take up the restaurant parking lot AND the now defunct Mervyn's parking lot which means people must love this place. Don't know why..here's my reasons 1.) The food is wayy too salty. Why must Americans like salty foods? Hello, there's a reason why you are overweight and have high blood pressure, America. In fact, if you're looking to come here for a simple and healthy meal..get your butt to Sweet Tomatoes. Even their salads here are loaded with crap..why call it a salad then? I got a soup in a bread bowl. Toooo salty and even the bread bowl was slathered with butter...eck 2.) If you're looking for a nice and relaxing place..get lost. TV screens and super loud, playing sports games and other things AND if you come at a rather bad time, angry men shouting while spitting bits of BBQ wings out of their mouth. Not a good look people.. 3.) Service was pretty bad. Even when our drinks were getting pretty low, no one would ask for refills. It took a good 20 minutes or so to get reception and it wasn't even busy. I will definitely not be coming back here again..it was quite an awful experience. For a whole week, my body was feeling like crap."
Emily N.,"Corvallis, OR",185,67,63,5.0,3/17/2013,"Fantastic food, good quantity for the price, and great quality. Although you may have to wait quite a while to get seated, it is worth the wait. It is fantastic to have a decent restaurant in Newark!"
Meshell C.,"Oakland, CA",150,415,493,2.0,7/10/2010,"If I could rate the service alone, it would only deserve ONE star.  The waitress repeatedly forgets to bring us our things.  My brother had to wait for his beer the longest.  She had to be constantly reminded about the food (not bringing the fries).  Then she forgets to add avocado on one of the burgers. At the end, she doesn't even asks if we wanted anything else and just handed us our bill...umm, actually, we wanted dessert!  Anyways, the service was horrible, and then the manager came at the end to apologize for the wrong order and offered to have avocados added when we were already done w/ the meal.  Pointless! The food was as expected...the California burger was somewhat bland.  i had the Roast Turkey club and it was good.  The classic burger was fine.  My nephew had the Mac n Cheese which he thoroughly enjoyed.   The place had plenty of TV's around so that was good to catch up on sports, but not enough for me to be entertained when I'm constantly annoyed by the horrible service."
Jennifer K.,"Oakland, CA",11,86,,4.0,6/26/2011,"My family and I love happy hour here and that's saying a lot when you can get my parents on board.  =) We love it so much that my husband and I had our rehearsal dinner at this location and we were very happy with the value of the party catering service!  It was all you can eat pizzas, apps and salads.  Too bad it was the night before my wedding because my bridesmaids and I were trying to not eat that much, otherwise we would have seriously gotten our grub on."
David P.,"Oakland, CA",206,35,20,3.0,6/25/2011,"I hate the wait at this place, It's as bad as the one in San Bruno. Happy hour usually has people standing and waiting to vulture the next table available around the bar when your not looking. But you can always go off the side of the bar and ask the bartender to get you a beer at the HH rate (thats only BJ's beers btw.) Pizookie is the bomb with a Nitro porter, and the main entrees are ok.  Go when its not to crowded, you'll thank me in the long run."
Katherine L.,"Milpitas, CA",11,28,18,5.0,6/22/2011,"I love this place, especially for lunch. This is my second time coming to this location (I've been to the BJ's in Cupertino twice) and haven't had a complaint yet. Parking is never an issue because they share the lot with a closed down Mervyn's. Both times that I have gone here for lunch, we get seated immediately. Our waiter gave us ample time to decide what to order and the food came out pretty quickly. Since it's a brewery, I always like to order a beer with my meal. Usually I get the Jeremiah Red (nice and low on the hops flavor), but this time I tried their seasonal beer the Nitwit (like Blue Moon but packed with more flavor). I definitely want to come back and get it again. For food, my friend and I split the Ahi Poke, and I got the lunch size of the Italian Market salad. I loved the Ahi Poke, and it's a must order if you like avocado and sashimi-style tuna. Usually the salads are around $11, but for lunch they're only $8 (and still just as huge and filling!). This time, I think the salad was a little heavy on the dressing, but if you like a little bit of everything the Italian Market salad is delicious. And if you still have a little room and want to indulge, get a Pizookie! We knew we probably couldn't finish a whole one, so we ordered a small red velvet Pizookie, instead, and it was perfect."
