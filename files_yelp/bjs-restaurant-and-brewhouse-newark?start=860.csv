K M.,"Carmichael, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/24/2014,"Great service, good tasting food, the Dessert took a little too long to come, but it was well worth it, the pizookies are AMAZINGLY, I love letting the ice cream harden a cookie a bit so it's crispy on the outside and squishy on the inside lol."
Surge C.,"San Diego, CA",305,588,1302,4.0,1/7/2011,"In comparison to the BJ's in San Bruno's, this one is amazing! I have never had an issue with the service and the staff is always very welcoming. My order is taken fast, food delivered fast, and drinks made perfectly. I love getting the pear cider here!"
Rich A.,"Los Angeles, CA",121,26,,4.0,5/3/2011,"Came here for a birthday. Great staff. Very attentive...and not to say, the waitresses (at least the ones who assisted me) were absolutely attractive! Jameson shots all night, made a very cranky Rich in the morning. But hey, ""live in the present"" right? Answer to your question... Hell yes, I would come back...and this time get a White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Pizookie."
Alan A.,"Fremont, CA",4,318,29,3.0,2/15/2011,"I do like the atomosphere of this restaurant/ sportsbar.  The place is big, trendy, and there are a lot of flat screen televisions that dot the walls.  As for the food taste, it is spotty.  I have had good meals and not so good meals here.   My most recent dish was the Chicken Parmegana.  This was one of the dishes that I would not order again.  They gave you plenty of chicken draped over Spaghetti; however, the chicken did not taste that great.  Instead of allowing it to go to waste, I forced myself to clear my plate. As I said earlier, the taste of the different dishes that I've had were hit and miss, but none of them have been horribly bad.  Where customer service is concerned, it has always been superb.  If you are looking for a trendy place to hang out for drinks with friends, or you are in search of a so so meal, I would definitely give this place a try."
Nancy J.,"Minden, NV",30,218,28,4.0,4/6/2012,"Great service... Jason is the best.  Food good, but my husbands baked potato was luke warm and had a brownish tint like it had been in a warmer all day, this cost them a star.  Came here tonight because my daughters went to school with Grace Kim...   RIP Grace, it is not fair what happened to you in Oakland."
Sloane T.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,33,12,2.0,8/11/2012,"Visited on 7 Aug 2012: Let's see, where do I start.  Oh yeah, waiting for about 30 minutes only to find out the beeper they gave me was broken.  Okay, fine, I asked if we could get something complimentary as payback?  They said free appetizers.  Cool.  Got menus, waited a bit longer than normal for the waiter to take our order, but finally did.  Then we waited.  And waited. And waited.  And waited.  Then they came, soon followed by the soup that I ordered for DINNER.  I asked if they could hold on to it for me as we'd just gotten the appetizers.  Okay.  Appetizers were good.  Then we waited for the main course.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally the dinners came, all of them, that is, except for our daughter's, whose birthday dinner it was.  Also, husband's pasta, which he ordered with the red peppers on the side, came with the peppers in the pasta, and then some.  He couldn't even eat it, it was so hot (and he's from India!).  After about 15 minutes of no dinner for birthday girl, I got our waiter and told him about that as well as the volcano pasta.  He was very nice, and took it away (husband didn't want anything else).  Finally daughter's dinner came.  I complained so much to the waiter that he got the manager, who I must say showed excellent customer service.  In fact, the service people are very good, very nice, and courteous.  I don't blame them for any of this (except, maybe, the early soup).  The manager greatly reduced our bill, and gave a free pizookee combo dish (huge!), on the house.  Not sure when I'll be back, though.  With all the wait time, we were in that place for more than two-and-a-half hours."
Mary O.,"Union City, CA",2,34,,1.0,9/3/2014,"If I could give this restaurant Zero stars I would. I have worked as a server for 8.5 years of my life and I've lived between the states of Louisiana and California and I have never in my life had worst service than I did tonight. I was ONE of my servers TWO tables and Ravinder K, our server, did not refill our drinks one single time. In fact, we asked the manager after 45 minutes if our salads were coming out before he brought them out, as well as refilling out waters after they sat empty for 20+ minutes. My mixed drink tasted like cough syrup, not that our server asked at all to see how our drinks or entree's were. Also, 2 of our guests ordered broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl, only to wait 50 minutes to get Clam chowder in a bread bowl. When they let the manager know they ordered broccoli cheddar he said he'd have it fixed in a moment only to come out 5-10 minutes later to inform them that the cooks made a mistake and they had no more bread bowls but they he could bring them a small bowl of soup and remove the two soups from the bill. So we sat there for over 2 hours, got most of our entrees messed up, as well as no refills, and the soups also never came. The manager didn't apologize, neither did the server who looked stunned when I informed her that this was by far the worst service I'd ever received. She seemed to not care about the entire situation. My friend's entire bowling team has come here for years, and after tonight you've completely lost 8-10 guests every Tuesday night."
Sudhakar K.,"San Jose, CA",2,42,22,4.0,8/1/2013,"Except for the long waits, this place is the best place (probably the only one) that stays open late night in the Fremont area.  I love their Jermiah !"
John L.,"Fremont, CA",141,99,98,1.0,7/28/2010,"I went there for my first time and this place gave the worst service then any other restaurants that I have been to. Even McD or Olive Garden surpass this place when it comes to service. Not one employee from BJ came up to us to greet us. I do see them walking by and they never even made any eye contact. No acknowledgment after waiting there for more then 20 minutes. It's like we're all invisible to them. No Hello, or Welcome, or One moment please.  I guess this please doesn't need our business. I would never come here or recommend anyone to go there unless you don't mind being treated as trash."
Kayla H.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/21/2012,"After hearing about BJ's so much I finally decided to head on over for dinner on a Friday night to see what all the buzz was about, I went with a friend. When I first entered BJ's I was very impressed by the atmosphere. The wait staff are professionally dressed and nicely combed. Besides that, BJ's is a nice place to have dinner and a couple drinks with friends or family. Its comfortable and you can come casually dressed. The food is delicious and very aesthetically appealing and their brew's are pleasant and good with what's on the menu. The only problem I had when I went was that it took almost 45 minutes to bring out the dessert. Other than that, I would go here again."
Sahar R.,"Fremont, CA",7,62,44,2.0,8/20/2012,Service here is terrible every time I have gone in a group. It's like they know gratuity is included (mandatory in groups) and stop caring about the fact that you're trying to enjoy your dining experience.
Ashley P.,"Fremont, CA",16,24,,4.0,6/16/2012,The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my fav! What's even better is that I have leftovers the next day!
Enza P.,"Milpitas, CA",602,575,344,4.0,12/18/2010,"I really like the overall vibe of BJ's. It's always dimly lit inside with great decor, which puts me in a relaxed mood. I've been to this location several times before and I am generally happy about everything. This last time I went, was with 4 friends. 2 of my friends ordered beer and really enjoyed it (they have a crazy beer menu). My other friend got some kind of cider that was really tasty too. I'm definitely ordering that next time. We didn't get appetizers but for my entree I ordered the jambalaya. Instead of eating it with rice I subbed it for pasta, which tasted great. I wish they gave me more sauce, but that's probably why you're supposed to eat it with rice haha. My friends ordered a pizza, side of potato skins, and a sandwich. Everyone loved their food.  For dessert, we had a sampler style pizookie.You get 3 mini pizookies with your choice of flavors. We ordered 2 oreo and 1 macadamia. I LOVED THE OREO ONE. OH MY GOODNESS. They put a little creme on the side too in addition to the ice cream that made it more oreo-like. The chocolate cookie was surprisingly not too chocolate-y which I was ecstatic about. All I do is dream of the oreo pizookie nowadays. I love everything about this place except that time you wait for you food. I takes FOREVER for food and sometimes drinks to come out. I don't blame the waiter for the food, whoever cooks the food sure takes their time. I would still come back because I do enjoy the service as well as the food. It's a bit on the pricier side but I still love it."
Neha S.,"Fremont, CA",17,27,6,4.0,8/25/2014,"Great place to hang out, have some good appetizers, pizzas and chill. The waiters dont rush you at all once seated. Reservations are a must unless you dont mind standing in line for 20 mins! Pizooki dessert is amazing! !"
Ronaldo R.,"Alameda, CA",50,7,,2.0,8/19/2012,"Rude service. I was standing at the bar waiting to get a drink. Area was congested and servers had trouble getting through, one of the servers pushed me out the way without saying excuse me or even saying sorry. Service sucks"
Jozelle D.,"San Jose, CA",128,97,24,2.0,3/23/2010,"**********Sign up for BJ's e-mail list to automatically receive your FREE birthday Pizookie®. Sign up @ the restaurant or online!********** STOP! LOOK FOR THE NEXT AVAILABLE BJ'S! I don't really like this particular location only because the wait was so hecka looooong! I've eaten here once and attempted to eat here two other times. They're always so packed, which is a good thing for them but not for the hungry customer. I mean seriously...you let me down BJ's. I tried to bring my parents in for some grub one night so they could try the famous pizookie for the first time...but filipino parents don't like to wait, and wait long for that matter. -_-  Despite all that, the pizookie is still the shiz and I'd come back...maybe at a different location though."
Linda C.,"San Leandro, CA",144,441,1,1.0,1/3/2010,"Just call me Shaniqua C. I think I should have insisted on not settling on this place for even a casual holiday dinner. Something told me that I would regret eating here or something would piss me off majorly about this place...and boy should I listen to my intuition... THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE.  Now, most of you will ask: so what? Granted, there are many places with good food and bad service that I will tolerate because the food is just that damn good...here...not so much.  The wait was long, but we dealt with it because it was during the holiday season, but come to think of it, every time i try to patronize this place, the wait is always one hour MINIMUM. Sorry, I won't even wait that long for some places with MUCH better food... Walking us to the table, our hostess did not even NOTICE that in the process of carrying a PILE of presents, that I had slipped on a GREASE SPOT that hadn't been mopped up properly. EVEN WORSE, she proceeded to smile weakly at me and say ""Oh, our floors are always like that!"" THEN...WALKS AWAY. !??!!?!??!?! OH HELL NAW. NO YOU DI'NT! The ghetto queen inside me gets unleashed and I ask our waitress (who, by the way, was totally NICE) to get the manager. He comes, and I unleash the fury that is SHANIQUA C. (aka Linda C) and apparently I give him enough shit for him to go back to the hostess table and dish out some hell himself.  And yeah, he should. What if I was pregnant?! What if I had existing health problems that were compounded by that fall? I mean really, people have sued for a LOT less, and these chain restaurants are the first choice for lawsuits, so don't you think they would have CARED a little bit more?  The manager took my name and number but he has not called as he said he would. Minus 10 million points.  Sadly, the food wasn't bad, but the service is SHITTY, SHITTY, SHITTY - and enough to make me never wanna come here again.  To be FAIR, the food was decent and I ended up still have a good time with friends despite the nasty and MASSIVE 3 inch x 3 inch bruise I ended up with for 2 weeks.  All in all, there is NO EXCUSE for a chain restaurant of this size to have service this shitty, and for this reason, I will never ever come to this BJ's again."
Karen L.,"Fremont, CA",467,379,412,3.0,9/6/2010,"The first time at this place was awesome for me. I loved the decor, atmosphere, food, and everything actually surprised me. We had the best beginnings appetizer combo, and wow the avocado rolls were really good! The spinach dip was quite enjoyable as well, it was made just right. We had quite a few people so we shared a large deep dish pizza consisting of bj's cheeseburger/bacon and Mediterranean. The toppings were generous and the pizza dough was thick and fluffy.   2nd visit here was such a disappointment considering the last good experience. Everything was over oily and over done. The avocado rolls weren't as fresh as the first time and the consistency was very mushy,  The waiter who served us was not even mentally there. We asked for half veggie and half bj's favorite, and we pretty much just got bj's favorite with minimal toppings. What the hell happened?? Then we asked him, ""didn't we get half veggie?"" He then comes by and says, hey well look at this half it has less meat on it so it's pretty much your vegetarian slice right here! WOW, wtf... wrong response! I was pretty annoyed after this visit, but I still believe that this place has potential. So perhaps the next time, (third time) will be the charm!"
S A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5,54,5,4.0,3/18/2013,If you want to indulge - this is the place :) We tried the stuffed mushrooms - yum! Next was Bruschetta - yum again! Also I liked that the portions weren't too big.  We had gone for brunch and I had the BJ's Special brunch and my husband had the chicken sandwich. Both were really nice. We tried the salad and berry crumble in our next visit and both were great! It's just that the calorie count really sucks :(
Sandra C.,"Fremont, CA",99,15,3,2.0,6/16/2011,Called to see what time happy hour was and the guy hung up on me after saying the hours.  I knew this place sucked (speaking of this one specifically) but I would think they'd at least wait til you got in the door to be rude to you.
