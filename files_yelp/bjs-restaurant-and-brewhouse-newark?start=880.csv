Natalie L.,"Fremont, CA",20,6,,4.0,4/19/2013,My Favorite restaurant around town with yummy food and drinks. Great restaurant to bring the kids with as well.Always great service when eating there only downfall in takeout service is not as good. Take out always takes longer then they said and 50% of the time my order is either incomplete or just completely wrong  so I would advise to only dine in.
Priscilla S.,"Castro Valley, CA",156,173,28,3.0,10/20/2010,"Ate here over the weekend with some friends.  Although we still had issues and miscommunication from the reservation staff, the actual service during our meal was pretty good and the food wasn't so bad (way better than Fridays).  The place was packed because of the Giants game yet it didn't feel cramped inside.  I'd go back again but try to avoid calling ahead at all costs cause that itself will give you a bad experience."
Bill F.,"Fremont, CA",28,275,44,4.0,12/13/2009,"I came here to pick-up my son and his friend because they were there after a school function to get something to eat and socialize.  I arrived a early but they want to socialize more before heading home.  Therefore, I went to the bar to sit and get something to drink. It was late, about 11:30 when I went into the bar and it was still half-full.  I looked at the drink menu and saw that they had a extensive menu of mixed drinks and beer on tap.  Afterwards, I ordered a drink and watched some of the action on the television over the bar.  The bar was impressive with the displays of bottled liquor and the bar taps displaying the various beers.  I even saw the people next to me ask for a sample of one of the beer offerings - which is something I did not know was possible! I sat at the bar for a while until my son and his friend were ready to go home.  Service from the employees was impressive.  It was quick, efficient and friendly.  They also checked on me every once-in-a-while to see if I needed anything else.  Too bad I could not drink a too much that evening because I needed to get the ""Young Ones"" home safely! It was a great experience and I will be sure to go back for a pizza and a glass of wine without the kids but with the girlfriend (wife, also)."
Diana L.,"Newark, CA",10,57,8,5.0,2/20/2012,"BJ's is by far one of my favorite brewery's. I give their beer, food and service 5 stars for several reasons. I've been here quite a few times and it never fails. We are always greeted by friendly staff. The waiters/ress are always very attentive and on point. I love coming here for their savory fresh Ahi Poke. It's chopped sashimi Ahi marinated in poke sauce with diced avocado. The Ahi is served with crispy wonton chips- so delicious. I've also tried their chicken noodle soup and the minestrone. They're both nothing special, but do their job as fillers. Their pear ciders are also quite delicious. If you love ciders, try the pear cider! Not the biggest fan of the berry pear cider because it's too sweet! The Margherita Fresca (has mozzarella, tomato sauce, fresh basil and parmesan cheese) and California Club (bacon, chicken, tomato & garlic aioli) flat bread pizzas are amazing! They are both crispy, fresh and flavorsome. I would recommend sharing appetizers and plates with your table to try different plates. Their BJ's Cobb Salad is also fresh and delicious! If you plan on going on a Friday or Saturday evening (or during a game), plan on waiting at the very minimum 1 hour. They are always packed- which in my opinion, is a great sign. They have a full bar and flat screen TV's all over. The place is loud with dim lights, but I love it! Plenty of parking too.  Their prices are reasonable, but be careful when ordering pitcher, after pitcher... it can add up! ;)"
Anthony S.,"San Leandro, CA",51,34,38,4.0,12/8/2010,"while attending a kids circus at the nearby mall, I had opportunity to try this location as my first BJ's. it was a weekend evening and I found the short wait no issue, host and initial contact service was admirable. multiple flatscreens made ease of sports view and kept me from playinf espn on my phone, which makes momma happy. C'mon, it it a brewery so beer was a must for a guy like me. I tried the taster mix, and was duly delighted with the choices I made. overall food selection was a plus, even with the kids. all of our dishes were a hit, and the total cost with drinks and dinner for a group of 4 was under 60$  Assuming BJ's is a chain style unit, I would easily say popping into one on my road travel by chance of just seeing it would be a YES...."
Briggitte L.,"Hayward, CA",0,36,3,2.0,4/6/2014,"My daughter and I went to BJs with a friend a couple of weeks ago.  It was an overall good experience.  My daughter ordered the standard chicken tenders & french fries (hard to mess that up).  I ordered a new fish dish.  It was so bland that I cannot even remember what it was.  My friend ordered a salad and she liked it.  When we first arrived we had a friendly, energetic server.  He was very attentive.  But he went on break before we got our meal and his replacement had the personality of a rock.  She barely spoke above a whisper.  A couple of times my friend and I had to ask each other what she'd said.  She also was not nearly as attentive as the male server.  She pretty much ignored us after we received our entree.  We had to hunt her down to order dessert.  The cookie was delicious as always.  My daughter thought that her entire meal was awesome.  My friend seemed to like her meal better than I did too.   One more thing, I wish the waiters at BJ's would bring fresh glasses for refills instead of taking the glass that the customer is using.  It is highly likely that they will mix up glasses as they refill in the kitchen and you will end up with someone else's glass."
Maria M.,"Fremont, CA",11,20,3,3.0,2/9/2011,Walked inside and it has a niiice atmosphere. The workers were super friendly (even the ones that were outside taking their break were welcoming) and the food is pretty good.
Kelly L.,"Fremont, CA",6,37,16,4.0,7/9/2013,"When I had a sleepover at my house, my parents took me and my friend here. It was really fun and pretty nice inside. The food was pretty good. Very similar to what you would find at Elephant Bar or Claim Jumper! Homie:P"
Daniel D.,"Fremont, CA",676,44,132,2.0,11/21/2012,"Came here for a late dinner and had an interesting experience. My expectations when it comes to dining are held at a higher level when it comes to BJ's. We were seated fairly quickly, helped out right away, and everything was going smoothly. One thing about his location that caused it to earn two stars was the fact that everything takes forever. After ordering and waiting 45 minutes for our food we were then approached by the waiter who let us know that both orders were messed up (baked potato was cooked wrong and my cajun pasta was taken to the wrong table). Cool, as long as they were being transparent and honest. Still sucked having this mix up though. We finally got our food after waiting about an hour and 15 minutes. I had become very impatient. Food was good, still prefer The Cheesecake Factory's cajun pasta over BJ's but still good. The waiter was cool though and she went out of her way to ""talk to her manager"" to get us a discount on our bill for the long wait. Awesome! Not so much, after waiting for our bill for another 15-20 minutes, we were told that we were going to get 50% off the baked potato, the pepsi, and the Shrimp Cajun Pasta. That's not what the bill reflected though! We got half off the baked potato and pepsi (the two cheapest items on the bill) and only $0.85 off of the pasta lol I didn't even bother trying to have them correct it, I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. I definitely should have said something but why should I? If they are trying to make my dining experience better than what it was then those things should have been doubled checked. Meh. I've experienced better."
Chelsea O.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",95,6,1,1.0,7/16/2012,"The food and drinks were good, but the service was horrendous. My group came here for a little surprise dinner for our friend's birthday & engagement. I had called the day before and made reservations with a manager. To my surprise, when we got to the restaurant they did not have my reservation. I was visibly upset and a little frantic as I was concerned that we wouldn't be able to pull off the surprise, but the hostesses didn't give me any information on when a table would be ready for me... they just gave me the little light up thing and told me it would light up when the table was ready. My friends and I went to the bar and sat there for 20 minutes and our table was still not ready. I went back to the hostess stand and explained the situation that this is a surprise party and the guest of honor will be arriving in 8 minutes. I asked for the manager, and they told me that they already talked to the manager and he said I didn't have a reservation. Their whole attitude was very nonchalant. It was obvious that they did not care about our situation that we were in because of their incompetence. Eventually we did get a table in the nick of time (thankfully the guest of honor was running late). Once we were sat we didn't see our waitress, Courtney, for a while. We were sitting their with empty glasses for a good 20 minutes before we could even find her to get another. I can say that she was probably one of the worst servers that we have ever had. She was absent the whole time, rarely checked up on us, NEVER refilled our waters, and was completely rude whenever she was at the table. The only time she was quick to get to the table was when she came to get our money and the gratuity that she absolutely did not deserve.  The management at this restaurant is terrible. Brenda, the manger i spoke with when i made my reservation is obviously incompetent. There is another woman manager (blond) who was on duty when i was there was either completely aloof of the situation, or lacked the managerial skills to do anything about it. There was a male manager on as well, he was better than the other two... but could definitely use some customer service training.  All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. BJ's has great food and drinks, but this specific location has terrible service and worse management.  Good side: The brunette bartender was very kind and attentive and made fantastic drinks. Thank you for that."
kelly e.,"Newark, CA",87,8,6,1.0,2/22/2014,"I have been to BJ's on multiple occasions in different areas. This was the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant the I've been too. I have been in the industry for 14years and have a lot of patience but this one takes the cake!!! Danielle B in Newark was one of the worst servers  I have ever had. We first waited for 5 minutes for anyone to say hello. I did appreciate that she came and said "" I appreciate your patience"". We had very little interaction with her and when our food came we had no silverware. We were half way through or meal before anyone checked on us..Good thing the food was good! I will give you that! When we first ordered we asked her to put in a to go order and when we were done she dropped the bill with no To go. I asked her about it and she did admit that she forgot! I appreciated her honesty and told us it would be 5 minutes. 25 minutes later she came back with our to go, no discount or even a sorry. All that was said was ""I'll take your check"" which we weren't ready to give. I, as a server understand that things happen, but it is my job to try to make sure the guest comes back. There was nothing she did that made us feel welcomed back or that she even wanted us to return,,,and we won't!!!  YOURE SERVERS ARE TOO STRECHED AND CAN'T HANDLE THEIR SECTIONS!! FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A YELP REVIEW IN MY LIFE BECUASE I FEEL THEY ONLY COME FROM ANGERY GUESTS..BUT I HOPE YOU WORK ON YOUR TRAINING AND GUEST SATTISFACTION. YOU ARE BETTER THEN THIS!!!"
Vampire J.,"Alameda, CA",10,61,52,5.0,12/24/2012,"What a great experience! Great food and service! OMG so full after... They make root beer that is extremely yummy, i have been here twice now the wait is worth it! The food is sooooo good here. You must save room for a pizzookie it's a signature dessert that also benefits children with cystic fibrosis."
Vanessa A.,"San Jose, CA",3,18,5,4.0,3/8/2013,"Love this place! This is my go-to chain restaurant.  It's cool and a fun place to be. I haven't found a dish I haven't liked.  California burger, chicken fried steak, broccoli cheddar soup, Pizookie!! The list goes on. The wait sucks. This place is always busy (weekday and especially on weekends).   However you can always call first and the wait is totally worth it."
Curtis C.,"San Mateo, CA",133,212,3,1.0,9/26/2010,"I dont want to rant but this place had terrible service.  We went there after a late night with it being packed late midweek night.  We were seated promptly with the hostess very nice but once we got seated, we seriously waited thirty minutes and still no service and had to wave down a waiter to reseat us.  We got ok service after that.  I got the salmon but it was overcooked.  Even though there is nothing to eat here in Fremont, i will never eat here again due to the TERRIBLE service and the barely above par food. btw, their ""signature oktoberfest beer"" was out too.  Double slap to the face."
Sasitorn O.,"Oakland, CA",49,198,522,3.0,2/16/2010,"After spending Valentine's weekend at Big Sur and on the way heading back home, we decided to grab pizza and this place was on the way. When i heard of this restaurant, for some reason i can't stop smiling ( maybe i think in negative way :P ) However, we totally forgot the day we went was Valentine's day. It was a bit long line, I have told to be waiting about at least 35 - 40 mins but the line was faster than i thought. We got a great seat for just two of us. We started with beer and strawberry margarita, which just ok for me. Food : First, Avocado egg rolls was a great starter.             Caesar salad was just ok, like other places.             Our pizza made with Mushroom, onion, pepperoni, artichoke           heart,  roasted garlic, and fresh basil which was good.  Service : was fine."
Susan N.,"San Anselmo, CA",6,120,7,3.0,11/6/2012,"You know how it is, chain restaurant...blandish food. But sometimes you're hungry, and it comes out piping hot and next thing you know, the greasy food is gone! Their pumpkin ale is pretty good though! Surprising for a chain brewery."
mike l.,"Fremont, CA",41,59,,4.0,12/29/2009,"PROs: - Good quality food.  Better than Elephant Bar in my opinion.   - Deep dish pizzas are great. - Avacado egg rolls are off the hook. - During happy hour, you get half off of all appetizers and a few bucks off of your drinks which isn't bad at all. CONs: - It will probably take you at LEAST 45 minutes to an hour to get a table, even for two people.  Your best bet is to get your name on the waiting list, grab the little vibrating thing, and hang out at the bar.  If you see a bar table or spot open up, just hop on it and order your food from there. It's a lot faster. That's about it.  Fair prices, good food. 4 stars."
Ken J.,"Fremont, CA",27,144,,4.0,10/31/2012,"I am moving this to 4 stars because of their menu, and their beer. Gluten free Pizza is the favorite of my friend. I did NOT like thei r avocado egg roll... wierd flavor didn't work for me. Didn't particularly like their lettuce cups wither... but there is so much to explore and they have a nice bar.  I would encourage others to go."
Wes O.,"Hayward, CA",49,63,,2.0,10/5/2009,"This review hurts a little.  This night, I lost something very near and dear to me, and ""PROBABLY"" has little to do with BJ's itself.   [Begin rap] Crusing down the street in my 6-6/ bumping the beat, ignoring the chicks/ Went to BJ's to get some food/ nuckle heads out there cold acting a fool/ I saw the haters so i cut down my bass/ then I parked my ride in a safe ass place/ took off my steering wheel off and walked on in/ walked by a punk muthafucka with a devilish grin/ I felt the hate, but proceeded to stay/ I ordered my food but it was only ok/ one hour later I walk outside/ some punk muthafucka done stole my ride/ Cause the boys in the hood are always hard/ eat at BJ's you might lose you car/ knowing nothing in life, except being legit/ dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit/"
Larry M.,"Livermore, CA",1,21,,2.0,5/30/2013,"Average service and attention to my gluten free needs, but the first steak I ordered was stringy and couldn't be cut with their steak knife. String beans were over cooked, salad was wilted. New steak and string beans much better, yet lacking flavor on a boneless ribeye. Tasted like no seasoning was used in the preparation. Re-fire on steak was relatively quick and without much argument. Service was not bad until my brother ordered a takeout order for his son and we ordered dessert. 20 minutes later after flagging the manager, we got both. Gluten free? Day after results, not good on the gluten free issue. I would question whether celiacs should dine here. Mixed bag here. Had much better experience at the Salinas location."
