Patrick D.,"Newark, CA",0,12,5,2.0,7/29/2011,"Oh god, did they have to put it right next to a free way???!!!  Scenario check/theory: let's say you are a parent of 2 or more children. You  live somewhere in Oregon and you decided to take the family down to Disneyland or whatever by car. You children are being little $&^¥$ (profanity), Whining that they are hungry and what not. You see a sign for a small city named Newark,Ca., and a glimpse of a restraunt just beyond that.  What is a caring parent's first reaction?   That is Bjs main problem. It is too crowded! Other than that, good food, bad service, and all around, a 2star rating."
A W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,19,,2.0,5/21/2012,"I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a deep dish veggie pizza. I've been here on three separate occasions and each time they managed to mess up my meal. It says Vegetarian for a reason, yet they somehow keep managing to shove meat under the cheese or in the crust. the first two times I told the waiter, the manager came over said how sorry he was and gave me another veggie pizza for free (luckily this time with no meat). Didn't have to pay for either veggie pizza. The third time a manager (not sure if it was the same one or not), but he brought me a replacement with no meat, yet when the bill came he said he gave me the replacement free, and still made me pay! for their screw up! I will not be going here ever again. It's pretty serious if they can't get a simple veggie pizza right. If someone was allergic to that meat or if it was some other ingredient they hid in the pizza someone had an allergy to, I'm sure they wouldn't be open anymore."
Keleka C.,"San Jose, CA",11,73,15,5.0,10/4/2010,"This year for my daughter's birthday dinner, we decided to have it at BJ's.  Although I wasn't 100% about having to do the buffet for large parties due to the selection, I ended up very pleased in the long run.  We went with their Signature dishes in which we were able to choose Chicken/Ribs, a pasta (Spaghetti), four pizzas (BJs Classic, BJs Meat Pizza, the Mediterranean, and the Sweet Pig).  I do have to say, the ribs were very very good!  The meat pretty much fell off the bones! From the moment we walked in to the very end, the wait staff and managers on hand were very attentive.  Drinks were always refilled, they brought the food out as instructed as well as the cupcakes when it came time.  What's even great is that at the end of your allotted two hour time, you can take whatever is out in the buffet home.  So, we had everyone take some food home. The only thing I wished they had was a private room for parties at this location.  Other than that, I would definitely have another large party or event here at this particular BJs.  The price is definitely worth every penny."
noah a.,"Fremont, CA",1,125,14,2.0,9/30/2012,"In general BJ's isn't bad for a chain but this location somehow manages to screw up chain-wide recipes. They always skimp on pizza topping, don't give enough side dish, ""forget"" to bring out parts of your order etc. I sear they need to go through an audit by the chain and see how poorly they compare to other BJs. If you have a choice the new one out by Dublin/Pleasanton is MUCH better."
Thanh N.,"沖縄県, Japan",172,314,87,3.0,8/31/2010,"I was so happy when they opened a Bj's in my area! I had been driving to San Mateo and Cupertino to eat their pizza for the longest time! My boyfriend and I would crave it once every two weeks. The service is 'ok'. I ordered togo a few times, and once we took the pizza home unsliced! I mean how does a pizza end up in the box unsliced?!..I was pretty mad since I had taken the pizza to a friend's house who lived in San Leandro and he didn't have anything to cut the pizza with. I called the restaurant to let them know it was unacceptable and the manager never got back to me as he said he would. He offered to cut the pizza if I drove back there. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I was now 13 miles away, it should have been cut from the beginning..I definitely was not going to drive back just to have a pizza cut! I spoke to another manager later, he was rude too. Overall, their food is yummy. So if you're looking for something new or you've never tried BJ's Brewhouse, you should give it a try. They sure won't disappoint your stomach."
Ash P.,"Hayward, CA",70,270,28,2.0,3/8/2012,"Let's be real, I only come here for the pizookie and that's it!  It's that good that I will wait an absurd amount of time to be seated.  I have never had a great meal or service at any of their chains."
Mike N.,"Brentwood, CA",99,265,134,3.0,3/3/2010,"The food here is hit or miss. Mostly miss. Learn how to cook a burger! When someone ask for medium, it means still a bit pink, not dry as hell and cooked all the way through! The service is ok. It's just a decent place to get a beer I suppose. Side Note:  My brother did 10 loops in the parking lot until I asked him WTH? He said this place was notorious for having cars broken into and or stolen. He's got the inside scoop, he's a deputy."
Jay H.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/11/2014,Bartenders tend to have tunnel vision here and they have a hard time finding the game on TV people want to see then they change channels out of nowhere. I won't be back.
Arneb A.,"Dublin, CA",5,16,,5.0,5/7/2013,Best restaurant to eat at! Amazing dessert especially the pazookie
Shirley N.,"San Jose, CA",306,352,522,4.0,12/19/2011,"I've been to this and their other locations quite a few times. Each experience was different. This review is for my last visit back in September for a friend's birthday. The wait was a bit long but it makes sense since it was a Friday night. Service is a hit or miss with chain restaurants like BJ's. We we're lucky and got a great server. Moving on to the food, I wanted something light that evening so i choose the maui glazed pork chop with roasted red potatoes, green beans and grilled onion. Super delicious and i didn't feel like crap after. I love that they didn't over-cook their pork. The rest of my friends seem to enjoy their food as well! We also got the beer sampler, not a huge fan of beer but its cool to try the different kinds! Our night ended with their original chocolate chip cookie pizookie! I'm not a fan of dessert after dinner but this is a MUST! I have yet to try their other pizookie's, maybe next time! Things I've tried in the past that i really liked--Chicken pesto flatbread pizza, Avocado eggrolls, mini bruschetta, grilled chicken potato, and their yummy thin fries! BJ's is a great place to have a birthday, enjoy a few drinks and have dinner with friends. Great selection of beer and food!"
Aile M.,"Fremont, CA",0,29,,1.0,3/26/2010,"I took my friend here on the 03.19.10, and I was a bit surprised that the restaurant was packed at 9:30pm, so I thought this place might be something else. I was thinking ""Awesome,"" but it was a disappointment. I ordered an Angel Hair Pasta with shrimp, and my friend ordered something with meat on it. After ordering, I looked around in between conversations with my friend. The ambience of the restaurant was very modern and loud. Note, I do not mind the loudness at all. Huge TVs hung from the ceiling showing sports.  By the time the order arrived, it was half an hour. Half an hour wait is a big no, no for me. Furthermore, the waitress messed up my order--the shrimp was missing in the pasta. The waitress apologized, and somehow it was understandable. The thing that got me was the part that she did not take the shrimp-less pasta, but rather gave me a plate of fried shrimps on a smaller plate 20 minutes later to be added to the pasta, ""BY MYSELF."" I added the shrimp thinking the pasta would somehow change my mood, but I was dead wrong. The pasta was bland, as if it was made for a diabetic. The sauce was hard to notice, and I even doubted that there was sauce in it. I was so frustrated that I just ate some of the fried shrimps and even that was not even good. On the other hand, my friend ordered a steak that was supposed to be medium, but arrived well done. My friend ate the thing anyway because he was so hungry that night and did not even have the strength to argue. We moved on to the dessert and ordered triple oreos, which took another half an hour. I was like,""What the @#$%!"" The dessert did not require any cooking. You just slap them together and serve, but it still took half an hour? In my opinion, just skip this place and go to another restaurant. McDonalds is alot better than this. I do not have anyone that I hated enough to send to this place and die of frustration and starvation. However, if you want to bring your most hated enemies, this is the place for you."
Vanna S.,"Fremont, CA",12,138,4,3.0,9/14/2010,"BFF's pick for her bday celebration and it was suppose to be a quick lunch before she gets back to work.  I thought this would be great for me to scope it out before taking my husband for a beer treat. We went in after the lunch rush and this place looks pretty empty since it''s so big.  I mean there are people but it's so big it feels empty.  We sat ourselves (since there was no one to take us to the table) in the bar area's cozy booth and was greeted by our server, Karla, few minutes later. We made our order of  Root Beer - pretty good, but lacking something, served in ice cold mug. Chicken Wings - nice crispy skin and and moist with 2 sauces and celery sticks served on the side.  perfectly cooked without being too messy, you can put as much sauce as you like.  BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza - combination of yellow onion, bell pepper, sausage, peperoni, tomato and olives.  it was suppose to be deep dish pizza and it's nothing special.  I guess if you have a few, yeah, it's good, it won't matter anyway, right? Our server was pretty forgetful for not having a very busy service.  We asked for straws and she forgot and when we finally asked another server for it, the straws shows up.  Our food shows up and we had no utensils or napkins.  We helped ourselves with the napkins for the empty table next to us.  I witness the table behind also grabbed napkin utensils wrap from another empty table.  Our server was nice, but not very thoughtful. The ambiance and prices are very favorable.  The Chicken Wings was not bad and the Pizza was just ok, meh.  Need I talk about the service any more? Over all this place really deserves 2.5 star and I just rounded up.  So a ""meh ok""."
Dean Z.,"Fremont, CA",7,34,,1.0,1/6/2013,Let me start of by telling you that I cant remember one good experience that I have had here. The service is HORRIBLE! The only thing that keeps me coming back are the large assortments of sports on their many tvs. Think twice before coming here
Elise G.,"San Jose, CA",166,890,2241,4.0,11/22/2010,"I like the setup of this BJ's better than those in Cupertino and San Jose.   The bar is dim, cozy, and inviting.  The backdrop is a puzzle of different flat screens displaying sports and there is plenty of seating in the bar area.  The pub tables are close enough to the bar top to be near friends and watch the games.  And there are booths available in the same area too.  I like that it's quieter than the other BJ's I've been to.  The place is pretty big.  There's no doubt that it can accommodate a lot of people.  But the ceilings are high so the noise travels upward and the layout makes the restaurant feel less cramped.  I would come back again just for the environment.   As far as food goes, it's pretty consistent with other BJ's chains.  The Pazookie is a memorable must.  Between four of us, we split the sampler with 3 different cookie pies topped with vanilla ice cream.  Of course that was after the hoard of appetizers we ordered. We got:  Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, Santa Fe Spring Rolls, Chicken Wings, Mini Tacos, Crispy Fried Artichokes, Stuffed Mushrooms, Crisp Potato Skins, BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders, and Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage Flat Bread Pizza. My top 3:   1.  I liked the BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders the best.  The sauce was flavorful and it came with fried onion strings inside.   2.  The Chicken wings were the best I've had in the area.  I like that they weren't saturated in sauce, the skin had a nice texture to them, and the meat was moist. 3.  Santa Fe Spring Rolls:  They were just plain tasty.  I liked the crispiness of the outside and how they were skinny and bite size so they didn't feel heavy. The beer was really good.  There's such a variety and there's a lot on tap.  My boyfriend ordered a bunch of different types in an attempt to work his way down the beer list.  I sampled his light and dark Belgian beers in a bottle and was pleased with both.   We'll be back again.  It was a great place to watch football at the bar over some good food and good beer."
Yen H.,"Fremont, CA",198,82,178,4.0,10/11/2010,"The first few times that I've been to BJs was at the Cupertino location and I hated it...The ambiance and service wasn't bad but I hated the food. I honestly didn't like any of their dishes.  Now that BJs has arrived to Newark which is closer to my place, I was able to try it out a few more times, especially during happy hour with my friends. I used to not like their avocado eggrolls, which everyone else and their momma loved, but now I heart them as well! Hey, it only took about 5 tries or so but now i'm addicted! I like how the avocado chunks are nice and warm...I especially love the sauce that comes with them. The food here is A-Okay. Nothing special but their portions are big. I realize that I don't like how they make their drinks...except for maybe the strawberry splash but I always have to ask for extra strawberries. It's a good place for a group of friends or family to get together and enjoy each others' company."
Jonathan M.,"Lancaster, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/31/2010,"Strike 1: I had a reservation of 20 people.  When we got there, there was 8 people.  they said we can't sit yet because they need at least half of us to be present.  we were short 2 people so they made us wait for 30 min.  then they finally said, ""come on in."" AFTER FREEZING!!! Strike 2: Upon arrival of my family, they asked where my party was.  The lady said, those asians on the back is your group.  my white cousins didn't appreciate the comment. Strike 3: Some paid cash and some with card.  I placed my card last instructing our server to bill the rest on my card.  When we got the bill back, they charged almost all of the expenses on my card.  I thought most people didn't pay so i let it go.  Found out that the server TOOK ALL THE CASH and only charged the expenses on the card.  Now its too late because there's no proof that we paid cash.   Lesson learned, don't be fooled when your busy and occupied.  people take advantage of the situation.  I admit it was partly my fault, but isn't that why we have a server?  To serve not to fool?"
Manny M.,"Castro Valley, CA",15,147,10,4.0,4/26/2012,"Came here for dinner last nite (first time) around 6:30pm and it was pretty crowded for a Wed. We were seated in 10 min. not bad for 3 of us. We started off with the fried artichoke hearts which were tasty, my uncle had the  pork chops, my wife had the seared ahi tuna salad, and I had the ribeye w/ mash tators. We were very pleased with the food and service. On a con, lower the music so no one is screaming to get heard in a conversation, I know it's hard for today's society to converse when their face is plastered to the phone, some of us DO talk though. Parking is ok, looks like Picasso painted the lot."
April G.,"Newark, CA",12,7,3,1.0,2/25/2010,"I have to agree with most of the yelpers about this place.  The service is HORRIBLE!  First time I went my friends and I went straight to the bar.  And our bartender was really nice and checked up on us everyonce in awhile.!  I don't know his name, but he makes good drinks and nice!  So the first wasnt so bad.... But the second trip we decided to get a table, the hostess was able to sit us immediately which is kinda nice.  But it took the server 20 MINUTES to approach us? Seriously?  The server was rude on top of that.  The service at Elephant bar is better than BJ's!  If I decide to go back, I will just head straight to the bar instead.  Maybe I will have better luck there. The food is good I think.  Pizza's are off the hook and the pizookie!"
Minhphuc T.,"San Leandro, CA",603,14,199,4.0,9/24/2010,Cant go wrong with this place. The jambalaya is always good. Nice selection of beer and they always have different seasonal beers too! Service is kinda slow but expected since its always crowded here but the friendly service makes up for it! Fun place to go to with friends.
Jonny A.,"Fremont, CA",213,287,252,5.0,8/15/2012,"I've had issues with the BJ's in the south bay, but so far, this one has been flawless. Even when it first opened, the wait time wasn't too bad -- nowadays, there isn't a wait -- at least every time I've been since. The servers are really friendly and knowledgeable -- chatty in a good way too. There's plenty of delicious food and drink -- and the happy hour goes on late -- big plus. Hosts are always greeting people right away. Come on down!"
