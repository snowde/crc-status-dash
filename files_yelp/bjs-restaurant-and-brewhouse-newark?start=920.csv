Blck R.,"Fremont, CA",13,124,363,4.0,8/15/2010,"I've been to the one here in Fremont and to the one in Sac. Although I can't remember what I had, I do remember that it was good. This is one of those places that you can take a date to or just to meet a few friends for a great lunch or dinner. I do remember having the Pizzokies...AWESOME. Four Trans-Fats out of Five"
Sean M.,"Newark, CA",21,317,40,4.0,9/19/2010,Service - 4 Stars Gumbo - 4 stars but very spicy Chicken Parmigiana - 4 Stars Pizookie Trio - 5 Stars - totally awesome idea for a desert.
Tiara H.,"Livermore, CA",2,36,17,4.0,12/7/2008,"They just build this recently so we decided to check this place out for my friend's birthday last week and we were very happy with what we found. =) The food was delicious! I had blackened chicken alfredo and a few bites of the giant chili cheese baked potato and they were both mouth-watering!  They have something to eat for just about anyone, and their drinks arn't too bad either. =) I believe I had the Blue Moon drink and it was pretty good, not the best I've had but hey it was a purty color lol XD  Our waiter was not very attentive but that doesn't mean all of them are like that. I would definately check this place out! It's pretty decently priced as well. =) Yumm...I want to go there now lol"
Heidi M.,"CA, CA",275,295,791,5.0,7/7/2010,"This is fremont/ newparks hotspot, since there really isnt any form of nightlife locally, unless you want to go to a dive bar +1 great place for groups +1 pretty busy, but I always get seated pretty quick +1 hug portions for pizza and entrees +1 wide variety of drinks and mixed drinks +1 alot of TVs to watch games +1 oreo pizookie *drool*  +1 service is always pretty great. A couple of my friends are servers here, so I'm a bit biased.  Im glad they opened one nearby, since I would drive to SF or SJ to get my pizookie fix :)"
Rachael W.,"Folsom, CA",13,57,16,4.0,9/8/2010,"My daughter begged me to take her here a couple of weeks ago for a girl's lunch. Have to say the food was GREAT this time. I got the parm crusted chicken. O-M-G!  Yuuuu-uuum! She got something or other she liked & I thought was OK. As usual the rootbeer was fabulous. Glad I went back. My MIL has been asking me to take her there, & now I can without worry. Still won't go for take-out ever again. PS- My 20's were still on my car when I came out. Maybe cuz a cop was parked in the lot watching traffic go by?"
t h.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,118,3,5.0,3/19/2011,5 stars for the chocolate chip pizookie. We ordered a large one and it was still warm when they brought it to the table and was topped with vanilla ice-cream.  Add a candle on top and it's perfect for a birthday celebration if you forgot to get a cake.
Cris G.,"Union City, CA",0,4,4,2.0,1/19/2013,The wait here to get a table is always long in addition to waiting for your food is another long process. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have plenty of time to kill.
Mindy H.,"Stockton, CA",13,127,40,1.0,11/30/2011,"I don't if it was an accident that I had a bitch of  waitress bc all the other reviews seem to rave how good and attentive their waiter/tresses were but my god, this girl was a straight up bitch. It was just my boyfriend and I and all we ordered were 2 entrees and 1 drink and a dessert. My boyfriend ordered a chicken fried steak to substitute the mash potatoes with french fries and low and behold, when the food came out, we got mashed potatoes. Food just took forever to come out and the only thing satisfying was my pazookie. She never came by to ask how we were until we had to flag the bitch down to give us a refill. I am usually a very generous tipper, but this bitch didn't get shit."
Anna C.,"San Leandro, CA",2,12,2,1.0,6/17/2014,I went on a  friend date awhile ago here and now that I have a yelp account I can give me review. I ordered Alfredo pasta with broccoli which was ok nothing special I don't really like their pizza this just seems like a cool place to chill with a group of people and get your drink on. So as we get into our car to leave we got followed by the security rent a cop man who stared us down until he got close to our car. He proceeded to tell us we hadn't paid for our meal! I know for a fact we did since I paid half. He literally tried to open our door and act like he was doing a citizen arrest and as the situation was about to get real a waiter runs out and yells out they found the money it was under the bill! The rent a cop tried to shake my friends hand but we were so offended by his embarrassing assumption my friend made  him back up and slammed the door on his face and we got out of there ASAP never again!!!! They should've paid us for the chef boyardee meal we ate and the bullshit we had to go through after. The end.
Rheine T.,"San Lorenzo, CA",501,136,138,3.0,11/8/2011,"So I took my boyfriend and my friend here for their birthdays and it was fine. Everything was just fine. Food was wonderful and pizookies are worth the try. But the waitress keeps getting stuff wrong. She gave us the desserts when we didn't even order it yet and she insisted that we ordered it, but we didn't and then she gave us another menu for it, then we ordered the desert and then she gave us the check and left us alone. Hmm,. She is kind of grumpy waitress."
Sandy N.,"Fremont, CA",37,232,181,2.0,11/19/2009,"Well don't know what their deal was on this Wed night, but it wasn't good. Typically when I come here - all goes well, service and such...not this time...  So its about 10 min to 7, I remembered to call in for call ahead seating, I know its not a reservation but you get placed on the waiting list. 10 min later we get there. I said my name and that I called in. Still the lady said it was going to be 15 min. I was thinking well wtf did I call in for? So there we stand my son and husband. 15 min passes, 20 min...Then I see other parties being seated...ok. So I go and ask the lady (different one - other went on break or something) and I said I called it in and whats taking so long, she said ""Oh we had you as not in yet"". WTF? Then she said that I will be next on the list...then right after a party of 3 were seated (I assumed we were going to be next!) Then this is what really pisses me off, a party of 3 just walks in - she said she called in. Then about 5 min later her pager goes off and they are seated - by this time I was flamed! a min later ours goes off and I toss it onto the counter just extremely dissatisfied at this point.  We were then seated, menus were passed out. Then the excruciating wait - had to be at least 20 min before the waitress came by. We ordered our drinks those came, we ordered the calamari - came out in about 10 min, though they were extremely greasy and somewhat soggy. But my son didn't care and ate them - or else Id have them replace them but at this point my son was starving. My son and I had waters to drink, hubby got OJ. So when my son needed a refill he did get one, but it just took way longer than usual. My husband was never offered a refill or at least a water on the side.  I admit out entrees were good (I got the pizza, hubby got a steak and son got chicken tenders) Our waitress was virtually unavailable.  Either they need to hire more staff (both on the floor and the kitchen) or they need to train the waitresses on better service.  So we get our check and we had our coupon for $5 off, after she came back with the new receipt, she had knocked off $10 - I thought good.  My hubby likes to give a good tip, he was knocking down like $9 or so. I said why? the service stunk & the wait stunk. So he puts down $5.  So I suppose the next time we go here - we will go before the dinner rush, but we thought 7 was sorta late and that it wasn't going to be to crowded. I will still call in and I will make sure the person who checks us in knows that I did call in. So we don't have another issue."
Craig F.,"Fremont, CA",317,211,431,2.0,9/17/2009,"Came here for happy hour and sat at the bar. Bar was packed as expected and was able to find the last remaining spot at the end of the bar. I ordered a Piranha pale ale $3.75 (Beers $1 off during happy hour 3-7pm and 10pm till close) and the BJ's Favorite mini deep dish (combo pizza $5 - half off during happy hour reg $10) The pale ale was ok, I'll stick to Sierra Nevada. The pizza was good esp. for $5, I would not pay the $10 for the pizza when it's not happy hour.  With 10 min to go of happy hour, I decided to try their Hefeweizen. I will def. not be having this one again. I'll stick to my Pyramid Hef or Blue Moon. Way too sweet. Didn't like this one at all. Final damage was $13.72 for 2 happy hour beers and a mini pizza I'm doubtful that I'll come here very often in the future, but if I do, I'll skip the house brewed beers and recommend you do the same."
Ricardo R.,"Newark, CA",230,134,53,4.0,8/20/2012,"Usually try pasta. Opted for the salmon, best choice EVER!!  Friendly and quick service."
Jorge H.,"San Lorenzo, CA",133,165,16,5.0,7/13/2010,"Hands down, THE BEST Restaurant/Brewery in the East Bay.  The food selection is AWESOME. (Although for some it can be pretty intense).  The beer sampler is FANTASTIC!  Most places will give you small shot glasses filled with beer, this place gives you seven 5oz glasses for under $10!!!  The service is great, the variety of beer on tap is very generous and the takeout option is a plus!  I need to come back here to buy a pint glass and eat more of their YUM food!"
Marissa L.,"Albany, CA",0,21,3,1.0,7/6/2014,"I recently visited this location a few weeks ago. My service was horrible!! I don't know if the sever wasn't very experienced or if she had too many tables. My boyfriend and I got seated and it took a while before our server came and we ordered an appetizer and 2 ice waters. 20minutes went by... No water or appetizer. Our server finally brought out our appetizer but forgot to bring the water. We reminded her and it took another 10 minutes to get water and extra napkins. The food was just okay. Our silverware was dirty and I asked her for another set which took sooooo long. We had to ask for more water. Maybe I wouldn't have been so annoyed if she was actually friendly. I asked to speak to the manager. I seen the server talking to her before she came to my table. I told the manager how horrible my service was and how I had to ask for EVERYTHING. I was very respectful and calm and all she said was ""wow that's not normally like her"". I was in shock. No ""I apologize"" or anything like that. I found that very unprofessional. I will NOT be returning."
Rita E.,"Concord, CA",721,174,229,3.0,9/9/2009,"I've been to this location twice. Last Tuesday, we were seated almost instantly & on Saturday, we had pretty good timing as people were leaving the bar and openned up just the right number of seats. Tuesday's picks: + Balsamic Glazed Chicken: I'll swear by it everytime. It's a pretty well-rounded meal. I've been lucky to never get under/over-cooked chicken. + Strawberry Confusion: Tasted great but I couldn't taste any of the alcohol.  + Pizookie: If you've never had one, treat yourself to a couple moments of bliss. A giant cookie & ice cream are sure to bring a satisfied smile to your face everytime. Saturday's picks: After spending the day wine tasting in Livermore, all I wanted was soup. + Broccoli & Cheddar in a sourdough bread bowl: The bread was yummy, but the soup was SO salty... I'm glad I had the bread to balance it out a little. + Mango Mojito: Another overly sweet mixed drink... Couldn't taste the alcohol. Yummy nevertheless. All-in-all, it's your run-of-the-mill American Restaurant & Brewery. Great for groups, one-on-ones, or dining alone.  I'm glad they're building a BJs in Concord... Newark is so far..."
Neil K.,"Fremont, CA",5,511,1,4.0,7/7/2010,Came here for lunch and really enjoyed it. Lot of space and tv's all around if you're into watching sporting events while you eat.   They brew their own alcohol on the spot and also cream and cherry soda if you want something lighter. The menu is huge with a good variety of choices.  Kids menu is also pretty good. Ordered some pizza and thought it was good.  Wanted to try some other things on the menu but will do that next time.  I've heard it gets really busy for dinner but I enjoyed my lunch experience there.
V K.,"Hayward, CA",7,313,30,1.0,12/31/2009,"(sigh) I wanted so much to like this place because I enjoyed the one in San Mateo - but this one was disorganized from getting seated to ordering food. We put our name on the list and were told it may be 20-25 mins wait - it was reasonable, but kept an eye on the bar area, just in case something became available.  It didn't help that there were folks that were planted there permanently, so the turn over was just nonexistent. Our time came, we were called to the front, our little pager was taken and we were told to stand by a sign. I got a little peeved that people who got there 20 minutes after us and were given someone else's pager snagged a wait person before they were called and were sat before us. We were overlooked for quite some time - it was just chaotic and we were there before the rest of the crowd. Ordering food was another challenge, people that were sat after us also got their order and food about 15-20 minutes before us. To be fair, the food and drinks were good, at least the taste was the same as the one in San Mateo. I won't be back here - it was just  very disappointing."
Konnie H.,"Newark, CA",65,68,63,4.0,8/5/2010,"BJ's is a really good place for gatherings and family dinners.  Pizza is supposedly their most famous dish, which I will admit is pretty darn good, especially the crust. Their sandwiches are pretty good too. However, it's just a bit too greasy for my taste.  I wouldn't go there too often, maybe once in a while.  But overall, our waitress was very nice and helpful.  Although she did have a little too much opinion on what my friend decided to drink..."
Rene L.,"Richmond, CA",19,254,236,2.0,6/24/2012,"I dont know what all the hype was about. It was my first time coming to this place and probably my last. I had a beer and my girl had a mixed drank and we had some appetizers that didnt even fill us up. I wanted to order some more foods and dranks but the waitress never came around , so I was like ok im out!! Waitress ""check plz"" paid it and left. We were there for the happy hour but there was nothing happy about it plus I think beer was only $1 off oh well I least I can say I tried this place."
