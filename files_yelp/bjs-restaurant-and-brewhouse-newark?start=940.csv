Maureen M.,"San Leandro, CA",70,280,12,3.0,11/28/2009,"This place is just great to throw back a couple of beers and watch a game on 1 of 9 flat screen TV's.  esp the jeremiah red! The menu is good for those that like variety, but not good for the indecisive. the service was good. Food: their pizza is a little bland to me, give me a REAL deep dish pizza please. try the jumbalaya, pretty damn good, ALMOSt as good as the south. and the one and only PIZOOKIE!!! for all those dessert feen out there!"
Mina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,177,69,2.0,6/17/2012,"Ordered a pizza and they messed it up twice! It was a standard ""veggie"" pizza - asked to hold the olives. How hard can that be? Waitress was clueless! But the manager did come over to apologize, and offer a new pizza. This is a great restaurant but if they keep this up, they're going to go down quickly!"
Lora R.,"Oakland, CA",183,118,79,4.0,5/20/2010,"We've been going since our first beer tasting here: though we only liked a few, we REALLY like them.  Their Hef is tasty and I really enjoy their laid back and welcome attitude whenever I go. I haven't actually sat in the full restaurant area: we just hang out in their bar section: service is always helpful and fast, though we typically have to ask for the check before it appears.  We have never once waited for a table, and I prefer the tall tables so I can sit high and swing my legs, pretending I'm both tall and a little girl.  Brownie points for them. Their menu is vegetarian, and certainly pescatarian friendly which is not the easiest to find at brew houses~  And the servers always know which stocks are used for their items, which is GREAT and keeps me from getting sick which I certainly appreciate. I haven't had anything I didn't thoroughly enjoy, and their soups are fabulous!  Their clam chowder was fresh and not too thick with lots of clams. The tomato-basil is lovely!  Salad options are wide since they make them fresh so asking to take the meat out is not a concern. I enjoy the games here because it's not so crwded or loud that you have to yell: but it's boisterous enough to keep interest and excitement going. Price range can jump easily if you're going for the microbrews or cocktails, but otherwise it's a good price for the quality and quantity.  They have the sort of dishes that don't look as big as they are so getting full is always easy!  And be sure to go during their happy hour: super-awesome pricing and getting drinks and appetizers becomes simple!"
Zain K.,"Louisville, KY",352,792,3,3.0,4/13/2010,"I've now sat here for about five minutes trying to think of something interesting or useful to say about this place, but to no avail.  It's true-to-formula suburban microbrewery restaurant, with a large selection of nondescript and slightly overpriced food, and about a half-dozen or so home brews, none of which were special.  At 10p on a Monday night there was a line, so this is apparently what Fremonters (or Newarkers,  or whatever) do on a Monday night.  A safe bet if you're in the area and looking for something predictable to eat, but you're feeling venturesome you can do better."
Mary W.,"Portland, OR",28,67,76,4.0,6/7/2010,"Their BBQ chicken deep dish pizza had a super yummy crust - thick and fluffy and the bottom a little crunchy, not like a dense Chicago style deep dish. Got the big appetizer sampler: Avocado rolls and Santa Fe rolls were good. Artichoke dip with tortilla chips was not very exciting. There were also mozzarella sticks but didn't try them. Went on a busy Sunday night and had to wait 30-40 minutes for a table so it's understandable due to the number of people that service would be on the slower side."
Jamie T.,"Newark, CA",16,9,1,1.0,2/9/2015,"ZERO STARS!!!! Management is horrible particularly Desiree. Our server was slammed in the bar and appeared to be new. My kid's drinks came out after my husbands beer and my soda. I let that slide. While I was waiting or our meal I watched how Desiree the manager, talked with 3 servers just standing around. If it's not busy enough where you can all stand around talking then either help the girl struggling or go the F&$& home! While I'm still observing the manager and her unprofessionalism. My husband and two children received their meals. The food pony then came back to tell me that they were just making the lettuce wraps. These were ordered of their happy hour menu and are not regular sized which is fine but a burger and two kids meals were done before. We were not once checked on by our server or offered refills. After out meals were done for 10 min. and still no one my husband told the hostesses we needed the manager so we could let her know of our unpleasant experience as well as the bill. In comes Desiree who we had to interrupt from her 20 min conversation. She picked up my husbands dish and without talking to is shouted to our poor overwhelmed server to get our bill. When out server walked over I told her to bring her manager back. When Desiree came back she said all you wanted was the bill right?! That's when my patience ran out! I told her had she picked up more than one dish from the table or not talked for the last 20 min and noticed me trying to get her attention that maybe she would know how unpleasant our dining experience was. I told her we never got a refill, my sons drinks came out last and my lettuce wraps were never made like the rest of the order. She the. Said, ""Fine do you want me to take off the lettuce wraps?"" At that point I told her she should do more which she didn't and how unprofessional she is for talking for the last 20 min about non business related items with employees while our server struggled. Normally I don't ask for discounts but at that point the bill should've been mostly comped not the happy hour lettuce wraps which was the cheapest for her to take off. I AM SO IRRITATED! Next is corporate. She needs to be trained again....BJ's service is starting to turn into the quality you got at Red Robin before they closed!"
Alyssa S.,"Daly City, CA",77,162,66,3.0,7/7/2012,"Ive liked this location for a while but keep getting veryyyy mixed experiences.  Example of time i liked: Bartender was great, very friendly, quick and even came up with a new tasty drink with me since ive been dieting and trying to keep low calories. Since i was gonna eat their food i figured drinks better be kinda light. Enjoyed happy hour and had some appetizers.  Example of time i hated: Had a pretty large group about 12 people so wait was a while but front host was great and We finally got seated. We all ordered our food from mrs. grouchy hates her job waitress but when it started coming we were getting more appetizers than we ordered. We all knew what we ordered so we gave em back to her cuz they werent ours. She never came by our table but for our orders and when food arrived. No refills or ""anything else?"" or ""would anyone like dessert?"" i even walked to the bar to get a glass of water. Totally abandoned :( then when our bill came the appetizers that werent ours that we never ordered or ate we were still charged for. Lame...good thing i wasnt buzzed or anything because i would have just paid the bill. Anyways took foreverrrr and they finally removed it and we couldnt wait to get outta there."
Joyce P.,"Newark, CA",30,83,5,4.0,9/21/2010,"I'll give it four stars.  I am not going to lie.  I am not a big fan of chain, but BJs...I'll make an exception.   Their pizza is awesome.  It's almost as good Z-Pizza for me at least. Their beer is good Root beer and cream soda is yummy! Great place to hang out and socialize with appetizers and drinks.   They have pretty late hours. Their staff is really nice.  I think once we had mediocre service, but it can't be perfect everytime.  Oh and that take out service they offer is pretty nifty too."
Chi N.,"Union City, CA",23,219,108,4.0,5/17/2010,"I just had dinner here with my cousin.   We didn't have to wait for a table at all... Our server was super nice, and helpful. We got the appetizer sampler (he kindly traded out the avocado rolls for the Santa Fe spring rolls, thanks!), 2 bowls of clam chowder, and the cajun chicken pasta. The chowder came out right away, and piping hot! MMMM.  Next came out the sampler, it was HUGE, it came with mozzarella sticks, twice as many Santa Fe rolls and spinach dip with chips. Super good. Then our pasta came out, which we shared and barely touched, only because we were so damn full. Too full for a pazookie. BOO!! Otherwise a delicious meal, and great service!"
Wil G.,"Hayward, CA",98,308,95,4.0,5/15/2012,"Went there for some pizza and brews with my brother.  We called in to put our names in on the way, we got there and was seated at a table within a few minutes (off peak) the waiter was extremely polite! beyond the norm, which was great and the beer and pizza was great, never rushed us and had a few refills, I would come back again, compared to the one in Dublin."
H A.,"Fremont, CA",2,31,,2.0,6/24/2014,"I went to BJs some weeks ago with family. I ordered pork chops. When they arrived I thought I would have to break out the chain saw to cut through them. I politely complained to the waiter and he offered me the ribs instead to which I agreed. However, they were burnt. Now mind you, I am not really hard to please but the experience there along with the wait time and pricing really left me cold. This is not the first negative experience I have had with this chain. Management really needs to review their overall customer service and quality of food"
Chris C.,"Union City, CA",51,549,15,4.0,4/30/2009,"My friends decided to take me to BJs for a belated B-Day Dinner. BJs is a chain brewery that kind of reminds me of a what will happen if you mix Gordon Biersch with Cheesecake Factory, a decent brewery with massive amounts of high caloric food.  The most important thing to know about this location is that the lines are RIDICULOUS LONG. So best to call in ahead of time and have them reserve you a spot like we did. Even with the call in, we still had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. People were waiting outside the door to get into this place.  The interior here is nice (kind of in the style of Cheesecake Factory) with plenty of flat screen TVs all over the place. The best way to describe the menu is that it's American Bar Food so we're talking about deep dish pizza, burgers, sandwiches, big salads, etc. Prices here are reasonable. Most appetizers (sliders, nachos, wings) will cost you between $5 - $9, sandwiches and burgers $7 - $10, and entrees such as pizza, steaks, chicken, etc you're looking at the $10 - $17 range. Also they have a couple of vegetarian options such as a veggie burger, veggie pizza, and some pasta dishes.  We looked over the menu and I decided to put in an order of their Blonde Beer and an open faced meatloaf sandwich, my wife got the salad and the baked potato, my friend got the chicken club, and his wife put in an order of mozzarella sticks and the chicken lettuce wraps. We chatted for a bit and our drink orders came up. The blonde was good. It had a light taste to, was really smooth which I liked, and didn't have an after bite at all.  Then about 10 minutes later came the mozzarella sticks and the salad. Portion here are definitely on the generous side. I would guess we probably got about dozen or so mozzarella sticks and the ""side"" salad was pretty generous. Veggies in the salad tasted good and not like its been sitting around for a while and the mozzarella sticks tasted like they were fresh out of the fryer and had a good crunch while keeping a good ""gooey"" cheese taste inside.  Next came our meals, and holy mountains of food Batman, I mean, they must think we are sumo wrestlers or something because they brought out a TON of FOOD. My open faced meatloaf sandwich must have weighed a couple of pounds because the sucker was stack. It had a nice garlic bread on the bottom, a 2 inch thick slice of meatloaf, and a mountain of mash potatoes with gravy and fried onion rings on top (oh yeah it also came with some steamed veggies to make it ""healthy""). My wife got a potato that was on steroids because it was the size of a Nerf Football, and my friend and his wife got equally as large portions.  Eating the open faced sandwich, it was really good. It's been a while since I've had meatloaf and the combination of flavors was just great. The meatloaf was moist and the mash potatoes had no lumps in it. I tasted my wife's steroid potato and that was pretty good. It was basically cheddar cheese with steamed veggies on top. We were disappointed that they didn't offer sour cream and chives with it because that would have taken the potato to the next level. My friends seem to enjoy their meal too.  After only eating half our meal, I boxed it up and got my B-Day Pizookie. There's not enough good things to say about Pizookie, a nice warm chocolate chip cookie about 5 inches in diameter fresh out of the topped with vanilla ice cream. If anything, it's worth getting the Pizookie. It was a nice way to end probably a 2000 calorie meal.  The service here was nice and friendly. As to ratings, kind of hard for me on this one. Yes I would come back, but would a wait longer than 20 minutes, probably not, and judging by the lines out the door people are waiting somewhere in the 45 minute range. But I can't blame a place for being popular. Overall a 3.5 star experience, but good enough to round up to 4 stars. If you can avoid the lines and looking for a massive amounts of American High Calorie Bar Foods while watching the game, BJs is you place to be."
Michael S.,"Dublin, CA",1,63,2,4.0,8/13/2012,"I would give the micro-brews 4 or 5 stars. Food is 3 - 4 stars. Busy place with a good menu. I have eaten here several times while staying nearby for a month. The best dish was by far the parmesan-crusted chicken. I had that one twice! Pizza is excellent, and so was the barbecue beef sandwich. Burgers are good too. But go here for some serious brews."
Alex R.,"Union City, CA",192,29,3,3.0,8/22/2011,This place is always seems packed. I mean the food is good here but not amazing. The pizza here is not my type of pizza but if you love deep dish style then you will love it. The price here are a tad too much but great tasting food none the less.
Roen R.,"Hayward, CA",44,123,25,4.0,9/29/2010,"I like this place because of their popular chicken dish. Their avocado eggrolls are the best. Their pizza blows, Sorry but I don't understand how their famous for their pizza.  There is always a huge wait for me and my girlfriend to get a table because this place is so pact at night, and the parking lot is not big enough for all the customers, especially on the weekends.  Their Pizookie! OMG They are the best! After I gobble this down, I just want to lay down and sleep and accept the fact that I'm gonna get diabetes because of how sweet that dessert is."
Britney C.,"San Francisco, CA",85,201,50,3.0,5/11/2009,"Came here on Mother's Day (yesterday) with my fiance and his family for the first time. We started off with some appetizer sampler that consisted of the avocado egg rolls, Santa Fe spring rolls, mozzarella sticks and the spinach and artichoke dip. The avocado rolls which came with some sweet dipping sauce was pretty good as this was the first place that I have seen them offered. And I love avocado. Everything else was pretty typical and could be found at every other chain restaurant. For my entree, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which came with mashed potatoes and some kind of sauce. I got two huge pieces of chicken which I ended up taking one home. The sauce that was drizzled on it was pretty blah and probably would have tasted better with some kind of honey mustard or tangy sauce to compliment the saltiness of the parm. The mashed potatoes were also pretty bland and I didn't really touch it after a few bites.  Service was not great but not bad. It was a busy night so I'll cut our waitress some slack.  Since I'm pregnant, I couldn't try any of the beers. =( I know, what's the point in going to a brewery if you can't drink beer?!?! But I will be back when I'm un-pregnant to try some of their brews and that damn pazookie."
Sean S.,"Anaheim, CA",98,50,21,4.0,9/26/2010,"I first learned of this place when they catered my company's lunch meeting. This place gets 4 stars because of the great food, friendly wait staff and great food... plus they have fresh-brewed beer! I especially like the Piranha Ale. I've been back 4 times so far & I  really enjoy their super-sized salads. Also, you can't go wrong with their appetizer combo and deep-dish pizza. Also, they conveniently have online ordering & a special pick up entrance. They get only 4 stars because it's a bit pricey for pub food."
Jess C.,"San Francisco, CA",279,429,22,4.0,7/12/2009,"BJ's would be one of my favorite chains.  I'm normally not a fan a pizza but I love eating theirs.  I recently discovered there's one opening near me in the East Bay but in the meantime, I guess Newark would be my next closest option.  A group of girlfriends and I came here on a Tuesday night.  There was still a 20 minute wait!  Onto the food.  As a group, we ordered the thai lettuce wraps.  There was definitely a nice kick to it.  I went with a small buffalo wing pizza.  It was spicy but very good.  It consisted of little chunks of buffalo wings, celery, cheese, and buffalo wing sauce.  A small was more than enough for two people or at least two different meals.   We finished off with the oatmeal raisin pizookie.  I'm not a huge dessert fan so I guess that's why I don't really understand the hype it.  It was just pretty much a giant cookie.  The service was pretty good; our waiter was very nice and friendly though a little slow/unattentive at times.  Our total for four people with gratuity was about $80.  Not bad. Count down begins until they open the one in East Bay!"
Leena S.,"Union City, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/24/2013,"I went here with 6 other people one day and was first off disappointed that they only have a ramp to get down to the seating area (away from the bar) all the way at the back of the restaurant. I was on crutches and when I asked how I could get down was told at the front ""there are only two stairs to go down."" I should have complained right then because I was furious. I would prefer it if the staff was trained in having some manners. I was on crutches with a massive boot and the lady at the front tells me ""it is only two stairs..."" Are you kidding me? Obviously, the staff does not care to accommodate those with disabilities. Would go to elephant bar any day over the rude treatment I received here. On to the food, it was pretty good but there were delays in receiving it. I can understand that because we had a large party but we had to ask for things several times before we received them. I would go here maybe for the happy hour but nothing else."
DeQuan S.,"Oakland, CA",34,24,2,5.0,5/8/2012,"Food, service? THE BOMB. Been coming here for a couple years. Wait time is about the same anywhere else on a busy Friday/Saturday night but its well worth the wait! TV screens all around (you can peek at the game, lol). Reasonable price for ALOT of food. Great place if your hungry. Check it out!"
