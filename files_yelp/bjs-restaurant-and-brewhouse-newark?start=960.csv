Constance D.,"San Leandro, CA",356,387,185,2.0,2/12/2012,"I came here with my boyfriend to meet some friends for dinner and since our friends were going to be a while, we grabbed some seats at the bar. Our bartender was super amazing; very friendly and nice. Once our friends arrived, we were able to score a table, since they seemed to know a host, and were sat right away. Our server though, I forget this name, was not very good at all. He barely came by to see us and left one of our friends water glass empty for 3/4 of the meal. The food was very good, for a crazy busy restaurant. I'd go back if friends would want to go but it's not first on my places to go."
Anita C.,Hong Kong,192,377,734,2.0,2/1/2010,"Pluses: Packed after work, but wait wasn't too long for seats. Jambalaya was good and so was the pizza (I think we just go the BJ combo.)  Pazuki was alright (a bit sweet for me, but not bad - basically 2 scoops of ice cream on top of a warm chocolate chip cookie). MINUS: Service was bad! Waitress sounded normal and nice, but wasn't even paying attention to us as we were talking to her. Or check in on us and walk away before we asked her something. And she would leave and not come back for a loooong time. Not sure if it's worth coming back here because of this service. Seems like the servers are chatting and mingling in the back, because 4-5 of them would come out of the kitchen at the same time to go to their tables..."
Adrienne P.,"Fremont, CA",50,151,1,1.0,3/3/2009,"It's really a shame that their service is so lousy.  Otherwise, it would be a nice, fun place to go to in my neighborhood. We tried the on-line ordering service and boy oh boy did they screw up!  Why even bother having a ""special instructions"" button when the staff is just going to ignore it?   Problem #1:  We requested ""no mayonnaise"" on the bbq chicken sandwich.  It came slathered in mayo. Problem #2:  We requested bacon and cheddar cheese on the sourdough burger.  It came without both. Problem #3:  We had a $5 off coupon code which we entered into the on-line system.  They did not honor it until my husband had to point it out as he was picking up the food. Problem #4:  They said the food would be ready at 8:15 p.m.  It wasn't ready until about 8:40 p.m....actually, we think it may have been ready and just sitting in the kitchen and it was just when one of the employees decided that it was convenient enough that they went to go get it.  The reason for our hypothesis:  the food was cold and the bread on the sandwiches was soggy when we finally got to eat it.  It got cold during the drive home, you say?  Nay.  We live about 4 minutes away.  There is no way that it would've gotten that cold that fast. Problem #5:  We wrote an email to the company to complain (we were going to complain immediately but it was already 9 p.m. and we were tired and hungry and we knew that with how busy they were that no one would help us out).  Well, they have not responded.  Had they responded, I might have written a nicer review.   BJ's - you messed with the wrong Yelper."
Milicent A.,"Fremont, CA",171,126,6,3.0,7/18/2009,"So I've been here a couple of times, and I have to say not bad.  The area is huge, but it gets packed quick! So expect to wait on those days.  Every time I'm hear, I get pretty good service, but some of the waiters/waitresses I have need a Rockstar or some kind of caffeine overload! Other than that, they were polite and attentive. Just kinda....Sleepy like? Anyway, always had a decent meal here, but the food is way too heavy for me, and thats A LOT to say coming from me To be honest, I'm not a big fan of their pizza, which they are known for. I like their lunch specials, and I like how they have a section for  people who want to ""watch"" their weight...theres about 6-7 entrees that are less than 600 calories each, and they dont sound to bad   addicted to their unlimited soup and salad lunch special for about $6.75? I love their cheese broccoli soup.  Good for groups, but plan ahead on busy nights. Happy hour is ok. Their bar can be bigger! Btw, they need to stop waxing/buffing that floor of theirs/"
R. E.,"Fremont, CA",4,49,5,2.0,9/29/2013,"Service ok- nice people But that's why they get two stars.  Loud, had a pizza, pricy and not great, ordered a drink and was told they didn't have the liqueur needed when I  said there is no liqueur in the drink the server firmly repeated himself which says to me the bartender was to lazy to try to make a drink a little different- this is the second time here won't be going back did I say it was LOUD?? Left with a headache -"
Whitney N.,"Hayward, CA",21,45,4,4.0,6/24/2011,I have only lived in Fremont 3 months but I've been here about 10 times. My friends and I always like to just sit at the bar when we eat because the bartenders are so funny and nice and the drinks are GREAT! I like the fun noisy atmosphere with the restaurant feel. Perfect place to come to watch the games!
David T.,"Livermore, CA",1,20,,5.0,4/22/2009,I must be hitting this place at the right time because every time I get great service & the food is outstanding.  It also helps to make sure you're starving because they have huge portions.  Anyway they've got real ice tea not the watered down like at Costco that never empties (for long.)  I've sampled just the burgers here which have been cooked perfect every time.  It's the only place where I've gone where they include a knife for a burger.  You need it if you're not starving.  The fries are fine filler. The decor is nice.  Lots of TVs & pleasant employees.  It's pricey compared to most places I go for lunch but it's well worth it.
Vance P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,19,1,2.0,1/29/2013,This place is busy all the time. If you have a larger sized group then you better be prepared to wait awhile. After you get seated get ready to wait some more for a waiter to help you out and take your order. Now I don't mind waiting a bit for some good food but this I tell you is not good food. Its not bad but its not worth waiting for at all.
Ariel L.,"Union City, CA",50,83,,3.0,1/29/2013,Booze and the pazzooki thats all you need to get. The wait staff is always awesome with a fun enviroment.
Jee C.,"Oakland, CA",137,250,397,3.0,2/7/2012,I'm not a person who goes to sports bar to watch games... but I think this BJ's needs more TV for people who like to watch while dining.
Maureen R.,"San Jose, CA",11,11,,5.0,8/18/2012,"Just had the most pleasant encounter with a woman I believe is the manager! Any restaurants wld be lucky to have such classy personnel. Please eat here, I know I will be back!"
Al M.,"Fremont, CA",73,9,1,4.0,3/8/2011,"My girlfriend and I came to BJ's for happy hour and decided to order out of the box, we order a Mediterranean deep dish pizza; this was new to us because we usually go for the usual combo or just pepperoni.  When we got the pizza, it was hot, topped with veggies I couldn't even pronounce but it was hella good. It came on an iron skillet, waitresses were nice and conversational.  All in all, loved it."
David J.,"Fremont, CA",6,20,,2.0,9/22/2011,"Long wait, waitress disappeared, no utensils, food was cold when they finally brought it, got my order wrong, there was no sugar on the table, so dark you couldn't read the menu, they don't offer any bread or chips before the meal, they had no coffee ready. However the tvs were big and they are numerous. Not sure about the beer. I wont be going back."
May C.,"San Jose, CA",69,183,3,5.0,3/20/2009,"Not sure if it was because it was St. Patrick's Day, but their happy hour ended til midnight!!!! That's Awesome Blossom!!! (Whoops, wrong restaurant)"
Kristen O.,"Springfield, IL",26,21,44,3.0,10/25/2011,Food as always is good. Bartender needs some work. Had to listen to her grumble about everyone else that works here while trying to enjoy my lunch. She also kept touching her hair and face then touching plates and glasses.  Ick.
Niza H.,"Fremont, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/1/2011,"Never, never again will I go back to this place. The food is okay but the service is so horrible that I would rather stay home.  My friends and I've been to a couple of different BJ's locations and the food and drinks are always good so when we moved to Fremont we decided to check out the closest one in Newark for my friend's birthday. Big mistake.  We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. That was the only good part of the night. First, the waiter forgot to bring me my drink, twice. And his hand writing was so bad that the bar tenders had to come over to our table to ask what we ordered 'cause they couldn't read the ticket. So that took forever.  Once we ordered food, it got worse. As starters, a couple of us got salads and one got an appetizers. The waiter brings out the pizza stands and the condiments, but no starters. Twenty mins later, a salad comes out. The other salad and appetizer doesn't come out until long after the first one is completely gone. It's been over an hour at this point, but we were a big party so we expect it to take a bit longer for us, but not like this. We wait. And wait. Finally our food comes out. It's cold, my burger is undercooked, but we eat anyways. Nobody's gotten a refill at this point, even though most of the glasses have been empty since before the first salad arrived. I have to stop one of the other waiters to ask for refills since our waiter doesn't bother to check up on us.  The last straw for me was when the waiter didn't want to split up the check for us. He said it would take him too long to figure it out so he told us to just do it ourselves. So we split up the check, tax and gratuity as well (We were a party of 12 so it's automatically put in). He comes back with the receipts for us to sign, and we noticed that he's put an additional tip for himself on the receipts. So we send those back and wait. Finally the manager has to come over and sort everything out. The whole process took over half an hour. Needless to say, we were all pretty pissed off by the end. And we all vowed to never, ever, come back to this BJs."
Monica L.,"Gilroy, CA",403,803,60,4.0,2/1/2009,"I feel like I have been to a BJ's before but I am just not sure where or when because they seem to be popping up everywere! Came here yesterday for lunch with my dear friend Sue Ann  D.*waving* and her husband. Yeahhh!  This place is huge! I walked in and I was thinking ""WOW! This place reminds me of Vegas for some reason"". The decor is trendy, modern and cool. I liked it!  We were seated immediately and had great wait service. We shared the chicken wraps and all of us ordered the turkey club since both Sue Ann and her husband were raving about it. It is very good! I could only eat one out of the 4 sandwiches! I took the rest home to eat for lunch today. It also included a decent sized garden salad and I had that with Italian dressing.  This place sort of reminds me of Cheesecake Factory (which I am not a fan of) but without the ridiculous wait! This location sits alone in a Mervyns shopping center plaza (sniff sniff!) with all bare stores and wood planks on the windows and doors. I am sure within the year this area will be really desirable with new and shiny stores. But BJ stands all alone pretty well. Their parking lot is a bit strange for some reason but there is plenty of parking because of Mervyns being unoccupied.  I would come back probably with a group since it seems like a good location for large parties. Prices are decent and since I got to make two meals out of my one meal from here, it was worth it in my book!   I'll be back!"
Leo L.,"San Jose, CA",4,93,32,4.0,4/27/2012,Good Californian food and beer.  Good service.  Nice amenity.  Like the place!
Richard M.,"East Bay, CA",40,13,2,1.0,6/18/2014,"Seems like every time we come here, the service has gotten worse.  It's very SLOW.  I mean sluggishly slow.  This was on a Tuesday night. There were 7 of us. The two appetizers we ordered were wrong and came out at different times.  Then it took another  40 minutes before we were able to order our entrees after we complained about the service .  30 minutes later, some of the entrees came out and boy, some of the orders were incorrect and mine was nowhere to be found.  The waitress totally forgot my order (Enlightened bison burger)  I had to wait another 20 minutes.  Finally, I got my order and the bison burger was totally dry.  It supposed to be cook in medium rare not well done.  After getting the bill, even that was all wrong.  My brother-in law spoke with the on-duty manager and complained to him about the whole experience.  Don't know what had happened between them because my wife and I left to get out of this place."
Reese S.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",33,108,183,4.0,8/5/2011,"This place deserves at least a 3.5 average rating. I mean, 3 is just an average joint. BJ's brews their own beer and sodas. That's not average. That's brilliant. Upon mention of the home-brewed sodas, I decided to try out their Cream Soda. It was delightfully fizzy and sweet, but not too sweet. It had far better cream flavor than that store-bought stuff. I do not drink sodas, but this was good. I ordered the Smoked Turkey Cobb. Very tasty. Let me give you then run down: layers of smoked turkey adorned by lettuce, tomato, cheese, applewood bacon, avocado, and Dijon mayonnaise sit atop a toasted, garlic and cheese French roll. The roll was the best part of the sandwich, and the sole purpose for my ordering it. It was crispy and crunchy as any good toasted roll should be; the garlic and cheese sent me to another realm of Bread Heaven. I love me some bread, and this roll was packed with flavor. This is not just some run-of-the-mill plain jane sandwich bread. This stuff rocks. The bacon added a nice smokey flavor that paired well with the smoke of the turkey. The Dijon mayonnaise added flare and a creaminess to balance the crunch.  As any sensible person should do when eating at BJ's, I ordered the Pizookie. Think of the warmest, gooiest, chunkiest cookie, then think of cold, creamy ice cream...that is the Pizookie. But what differentiates this dessert from the normal cookie and ice cream crap served everywhere else is its cooking method. The dough is placed in a thin metal dish, and baked like a small pizza. Then the ice cream is dolloped on top, melting constantly into a river of creamy delight. The options are many: chocolate chunk, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin walnut, and macadamia nut. All the best cookies. Vanilla bean ice cream is the only one offered for the normal Pizookie. I ordered the chocolate chunk (had to go with the classic). Phenomenal. The best thing of the night. It was so warm and so gooey with large chocolate chunks that just oozed and melded with the creamy ice cream. And vanilla bean was a great flavor selection on BJ's part. It has a distinct flavor, and pairs well with a fresh cookie. I felt like Santa, but on a planet where the cookies aren't stale after sitting there all night, but rather cookied while I was coming down the chimney; and instead of boring milk, I was given the best thing ever created: ice cream. The place is very loud, the service is not very good, and it is darker than Mordor (hence my lack of food pictures).  Come for the Pizookie."
