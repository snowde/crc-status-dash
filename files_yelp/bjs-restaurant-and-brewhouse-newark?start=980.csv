Emmie L.,"Milpitas, CA",161,200,8,3.0,12/17/2011,"Second time coming here, and the experience was a tad bit less pleasurable. Since we came on a Friday around lunchtime, the weekend before Christmas, the place was jam packed and overflowing with Christmas gift exchanges it seemed. The main hostess was okay - I like that they gave us a buzzer to let us know when it was our turn to be seated. The wait wasn't all that bad; around 10-15 minutes at most.  Our server was much cheerier! I wonder why haha. No, but he was a nice enough guy who seemed a bit distracted at times, but he was handling many tables all at once. Gave us completely fresh glasses of water, about 2 times for each of us. He gave us some recommendations when we were stuck between two very tantalizing choices, and we took his word for it, thankfully. We ordered from the lunch menu; very affordable choices with great value I'd say - about $6.25. Eventually, I went with the Margherita Fresca (?).. just completely butchered that haha, but hey, it was tres bon. It came with a small side of salad and 4 mini pieces of pizza, which I didn't take to go for what seems like the first time in ages because 1.) the wait was long! I mean like 45 minutes long for our main dishes to come out; no free appetizers either, which sucked a little 2.) the portions weren't those of immense proportions or anything of that sort  The red velvet mini pizookie was too sweet for my liking."
Christy K.,"Dublin, CA",8,71,,4.0,3/16/2009,"Great selection of food.  Their ale and their Hefeweizen are really good.  The service is SLOW.  Painfully slow.  I know it's crowded, but it doesn't take 30 minutes to fry up some fish n chips, ok?   I'd go back because so many things on the menu sounded tasty.  And it's a cool place to hang.. the bar is nice, they even have Grey Goose L'Orange there, which made my dad happy.  Our waiter was so-so.  I've definitely had worse but he just really seemed like he didn't want to be there.   All in all, cool place.. has potential."
Timan G.,"San Francisco, CA",218,123,,2.0,1/25/2010,"This place reminds me of a blend between Cheesecake factory and your typical sports bar.  There are more knife and fork options but the food really isn't all that great. The burgers were a let down, and my mom's cheeseburger actually came out a bit cold!  My brother loved his calzone.  The fries are just eh.  I had the open-faced meatloaf sandwich which supposedly features BJs' ""amazing signature meatloaf.""  Did I miss something?  A college student with no cooking experience could make better meatloaf. But the calamari was good (granted it's really hard to mess that stuff up.)  The mozerella sticks were delicious with a very tasty, parmesan garlic marinara sauce.  I'd go back for the cheese sticks, that's all."
Eddie K.,"Newark, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/7/2013,"Came in for lunch and the wait for food is terrible. Took almost 1hr for them to bring out my pizza. Then when the pizza finally came, the pizza was not even cook with raw sausage and meat. Then the manager came by and said sorry and will take the pizza off the bill.  Do she even expect me to pay for a uncooked pizza. Totally insane seevice."
Keno M.,"San Leandro, CA",55,26,37,5.0,5/21/2012,Good food had the ribs got a half rack ate half of it lol calamari appetizer great three people with drinks and desert $100 WELL definitely go back the help was hella' cool and on point love it!!
Nicole D.,"Oakland, CA",6,371,87,4.0,1/17/2012,When we went on a weeknight is was crowded with people celebrating the holidays.  It's worth coming for happy hour and half off of their smaller size pizzas.  It allowed us to try a variety and have money and stomach space for their pizzookie - yum!
Tisha G.,"London, United Kingdom",674,443,247,3.0,6/19/2009,"After all I had heard about BJ's, I was really excited about coming here! Then I met their jerk-off bartender, Robert. GAG me. Completely rude! It was my friend Sasha's 22nd Birthday, so we first-things-first; We marched up to the bar to buy her a few drinks. It did't take the 7 of us long to realize that our bartender that had been tending to the same group before I had gotten there, was completely oblivious to our business. He was rude, he ignored us, wasn't very good at taking our orders, and even TIPPED himself from my change!I didn't even get my $5 change back for my drinks. Because he took the change for himself, I ended up being forced to tip him more than my drink cost.  Now I'm not a miser - If you do really well and are friendly, I will tip you $10 for your effort to please me as a customer, because face it, places need patrons in order to do well. Too bad they stiffed one who is an avid yelper. Food took a while to come through, but our waitress (tall skinny caucasian girl) was very sweet, accomodating and helpful. LOVED HER! We were in a goup of over 20, and she was very calm about how crazy it was. But the bartender! No matter how many times we went back (And we spent at least $200 at the bar) this ""Robert"" character was incredibly rude. He even almost gave me a DIRTY glass. Are you freaking kidding me? Luckily a smarter, kinder bartender behind him pointed out that fact quickly and then took over the task of making my drink. Good guy, but I didn't catch his name. Overall, BJ's was so overrated. But their Grilled Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps were really good."
Christine K.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",103,288,19,4.0,12/5/2011,"Not sure if we just got lucky but we had a great waitress that checked on us multiple times.  Food is always consistent and good, had an ahi appetizer, pizza, and gharadelli pizookie."
Donald R.,"Anaheim, CA",465,252,97,5.0,1/11/2012,Deep Dish Pizza and happy hour is great.  Reminds me of Uno's Pizza from back in the day.  I also love the great selection of beers they brew.
Rana A.,"San Francisco, CA",89,400,175,1.0,3/8/2009,"It's nice to see that Fremont has a restaurant that is open past 10pm. The food here is ok, but the service is really bad! We had a party of 13 and they told us it'd be an hour and a half. Knowing this was a lie we stuck around the bar until our table was ready. About 25-30 minutes later we see a table being cleared off. I walk over to the hostess stand to ask if we can/were going to sit there. I was mid way through my sentence and she walks away.... No excuse me, just walks away. At first I thought ""what just happened? then I was PISSED! I talked to the other hostess about what just happened and she told me to ignore her ""because she's weird"". I don't give a F**K if you're weird!!!This is your JOB!!  Anyhow I go to complain to the most senior manager and all he says is ""I'm sorry"". I apprecaite the apology, but he didn't even try to make me happy. He didn't offer to discuss the matter with the hostess, offer a complimentary dessert or possibly a voucher for the next visit. Just I'm sorry.  Luckily our server was kind and gracious. She was very efficient with us and checked up on us frequently. We all left happy and full, but that hostess' behavior left a bad taste in my mouth that I don't plan to return."
Florence W.,"Fremont, CA",122,281,27,4.0,3/28/2009,"Same great service as always, but I tried two dishes that I'd like to write about. Last week I tried the balsamic glazed chicken ($10.95) and I wouldn't recommend that to others, unless you like your chicken well done. I found the portion to be a bit smaller than the other dishes, but it would fulfill an average appetite like mine. It is a bit on the healthier side with lean grilled chicken under a bed of greens. The only thing a little unhealthy (meaning DELISH!) in this dish is the white cheddar mash.  Today I tried the parmesan crusted chicken ($11.95) because two different people told me I had to try it. The two large chicken breasts were pan-fried to perfection with this lemon butter sauce which I ordered on the side. I had steamed broccoli and white cheddar mash on the side. This was awesome and could only finish one chicken breast and the broccoli--huge portions! The sauce was worth the 12 bucks alone--but be warned, it IS a butter based sauce, so try no to go overboard! Both times I came here I had to really control my appetite because I am head over heels in love with their cajun chicken pasta--it sucks to be on a low-carb diet!  Once again, it is IMPERATIVE that you request a table in Joanna's, Arthur's, or Jackie's section. These three are the best servers BJ's could ever hope for--kind, funny, not too chatty, quick, and overall awesome!  Final Verdict: My low carb diet has limited my choice of food, denying my tummy of carbs puts me in a bad mood. Cue BJ's Brewery, because they can't do any wrong, they're vast selection makes me want to break out in song!"
Scott B.,"San Leandro, CA",104,89,32,3.0,9/12/2011,"The service was a little confusing! I tried to call ahead and make a reservation but there were no more open slots... So the manager instead puts me down for a call ahead waiting, a deal they got... However when we arrive for my gfz birthday they didn't save my name so we had to wait for 40 mins to sit down and get a table... Which was very frustrating..  BUT They ended up waiving for a free appetizer and three free clam chowder bowls because they screwed up all on them! The service for  the actual food was amazing when  FINALLY We sat down!! Oh ya one last thing puzoookies amazing :)"
Jen V.,"San Pedro, CA",100,53,18,3.0,1/23/2012,I've been here twice and have enjoyed it every time. The food is great - especially the appetizers and pizza. The only problem is that it usually has a really long wait. I recommend calling ahead or just expect a 20-40 minute wait on weekends.
Beef E.,"Portland, OR",27,79,33,3.0,11/6/2009,"Just an average place to eat.  I went there twice, once because I was really hungry and it was the only place still open.  The food is uninspiring and their beers are hit or miss.   Although they have nice selection of Belgian Beer, I would rather make a trip to BevMo. Only go here if you are tired of eating Afgan or Indian food."
Monique R.,"Palo Alto, CA",60,8,,5.0,3/30/2012,"MMMMMMM, I love Bj's! I went here today with my friend, we had great customer service, and the food was great. We ordered and shared a small half and half pizza, which was really good and a Regular chocolate chip pizookie. We went at 5pm on a Friday, and surprisingly, we were seated right away! I love Bj's I will definitely come back to this location."
Cecilia D.,"Hayward, CA",0,17,,3.0,7/18/2012,"Food is good of course. But for some reason, the hostess annoyed me. She looked at us when we walked in with this face like we were supposed to greet her first, I guess? We said for 2, and she said ""okay here"" and handed us the beeper and didnt say anything else. No ""Welcome to BJ's!"", no ""hi, how can I help you tonight!"" It turned me off.  Pizookie was amazing as always though!"
Gene E.,"Newark, CA",1,29,,5.0,5/19/2012,"I went to BJs a couple of times with friends and family. Nice atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices. BJs is not fine dining. It has more of a feeling of a sports bar.  I will definitely be returning."
Gabriel R.,"Mountain View, CA",31,16,6,5.0,5/19/2012,We showed up late and had great appetizers and burgers. Beer tasting flight was amazing and well worth it. Servers were helpful and fun. I will be back!!!
Noel M.,"Milpitas, CA",731,1659,634,3.0,2/20/2009,"It must be BJ's week (my bf will be happy! lol!)  For the second time this week I met up with friends but this was the first time at this location.  It's the same ol' BJ's, terrible service and all.  The only difference is this one has a jacked up parking lot."
Patel P.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/27/2011,"We had a horrible experience at this particular BJs. We waited over 2 hours for a table despite calling in a reservation (atleast that's what we thought we had) . We had really hungry kids and they wouldn't offer anything for us, not even the opportunity to order some snacks while we waited. In the end they said it would take 30 more mins so we just left!  If you make a reservation make sure they write it down as a reservation and not a ""call ahead"". They have 3-4 people standing at the maitreD desk  with not alot for them to do, but tables are open and not enough wait staff.  For the record I really like BJs in general, good food , good atmosphere, great place to watch games.etc. and I have been to several other BJs without an issue, but this particular location is really poorly managed. Stay away,"
