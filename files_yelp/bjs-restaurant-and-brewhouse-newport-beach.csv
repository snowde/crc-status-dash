Dwight C.,"Hemet, CA",140,233,76,5.0,12/18/2017,A nice surprise on a busy crazy night! We stopped at this restaurant for dinner after a Christmas boat parade in Newport Harbor. While we had made reservations the neighborhood was crowded with Folks coming and going to the various parade concessions.  We were seated immediately even though the restaurant appeared packed. This facility is part of the BJ's chain and has a varied menu with many choices. Service was fast and our server present and helpful. Food arrived quickly and was hot and tasty. We were not rushed and our server checked on us a number of times even though he was very busy with a number of tables.  A very pleasant dining experience after a nice evening on the water. Prices were very fair and a bit lower than we had expected to pay in this high tourist area. Restaurant appeared to be an older building and a bit worn from heavy usage but was clean.  This is a recommended stop for lunch or dinner when in the area.
Florence S.,"Hesperia, CA",434,386,725,4.0,11/20/2017,"This was a tiny bjs but it was still bjs and I enjoyed it. I was surprised to see how many tables they had for the space, but they made it work and they have a loft area. The loft was full of teenage girls so we avoided that area and of course when I went to use the restroom they were all inside.  The missing star is for the bathroom situation. I wanted to wash my hands before we ate and I couldn't get close to the bathroom. The hallway was full of teenagers and the bathroom a tiny single stall. It was clean but you could see the age. They need an update for sure.  The menu is missing some of my favorites because the restaurant is tiny. We were able to order other things and that didn't really matter. I wish they have the pepperoni pizza appetizer my kids love. We ordered a flatbread pizza instead."
Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4320,743,1968,4.0,7/7/2017,"After a day of fishing on the pier with a PACK (thanks Patrick) of Cub scouts, our family and another wanted to grab a quick late lunch around 3 pm, and head for home.  Considering parking in Balboa is always a giant pain in the asada, we left the truck in the pier lot and walked to this BJs. We were quickly seated in a booth with a few extra chairs, and given various kids and grown-up menus.  Our server was a young man who proved to be very patient and attentive, even with our kids who missed naps and are generally indecisive anyway. The restaurant is... cramped.  It's a small place anyway, sort of snuck into an existing older building that shares a roof with a touristy ""novelty t-shirts and other assorted crap"" store.  If you blink, you'll miss it.  Still, there are a few flat screens on walls and smallish tables here and there.  No bar, which is outside my experience with other BJses. When our food arrived, my youngest (3) announced he had to go to the bathroom. Of course he did...  so off we wandered through the small restaurant to an even smaller bathroom.  The condition of the restroom betrayed the age of the building.  Clearly, this is not a new facility.  Generally musty and marginally lit, although in fairness, cleaner than as described in other reviews.   Kids all ate their food, and my salad was pretty good for a salad.  Of course, they all filled up on chocolate milks, so I got to eat a few slices of their kids pizzas for one. Bonus.  Good food and good service, even if I felt pretty claustrophobic in the small space. I can't speak to the evening ambiance of this place, largely because I'm not that guy that takes three kids 9 and under to a Newport Beach restaurant on a weekend for dinner.  No sense in spoiling the ending for those young couples on dates planning their futures together.  Besides, have I mentioned parking sucks here? Compared to the BJ's in my native Arcadia, which is spacious, well staffed, and holds truer to the restaurant concept of sports bar, the Newport Beach one doesn't quite hold up.  However, if you're ducking in for a quick bite before sitting on the 405 parking lot, it's fine."
John K.,"Tucson, AZ",2,90,274,4.0,7/31/2017,"Sunday opening weekend of the us open of surfing , brought back many great memories of visit years back in Huntington Beach and eating on patio of bj,s brewhouse on mains patio on sidewalk with great people watching . Lucky to get a front row table with you know the large beer,drink,food menu.server Katelyn sp? was great! Enjoyed the meat eaters deep dish pizza ,craft IPA & margaritas watching steady flow of beach goers stroll by. Another total taste & place in time  experience for my memory bank."
Brianne N.,"Irvine, CA",145,91,138,4.0,1/19/2017,"I've now found myself at BJs twice for no reason other than the fact that it was the only place open in the area at that time that catered to under 21 year olds.  It's not a bad place to be. They served my party although two of us ordered food, two of us ordered desserts, and one of us ordered coffee. They get the job done if you're looking for a snack and a place to hang out. Although, I came in around 8 and felt as if they were rushing our group a little. We were the last people there, but they closed at 10.  You can't go wrong with their pizookies (pizza cookies w/ icecream) to satisfy a late night sweet craving or to finish off your meal. Their house-brewed drinks are also very good. Their prices are a little on the expensive side. I payed ~$8 for a regular bowl of tomato soup."
Dave A.,"Campbell, CA",1,46,72,4.0,11/2/2016,"My sweetheart and I dropped in on a Friday evening for some food. The last time I visited there was when I was attending college 25 yrs ago. The weather was perfect, the air was warm. But trying to find a parking spot was a nightmare. We finally walked in the front door ... and to my utter disappointment, they would not let us sit upstairs. I was devastated. We were ushered to our seats at a table near the front window.  The pizza (combo I believe it was), was excellent, the service was prompt and professional. A very romantic evening led to me getting a surprise kiss (TMI) as we ventured out onto the dark pier before heading home ..... You cannot go wrong eating here."
Gulsen B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,56,52,4.0,6/11/2017,We came here in the afternoon and there was just 1 waitress serving but she did her best to serve very quickly.  I found it so weird that there was just 1 waitress at the afternoon time. We ordered shrimp pasta and vegetarian taco both of them were delicious.
Jeff B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",81,29,5,5.0,12/10/2017,Extensive kids menu. Quick service. Good food and beer. The restaurant was busy but our waiter was awesome. He did not miss a beat.  We will be back.  Great for kids!
Marina D.,"Valencia, CA",4,41,27,5.0,8/9/2017,"Who doesn't love BJ's?! My husband and I love coming to this BJ specifically because their outdoor seating is so cozy. Amazing food, delicious beer and great service!"
Jacob C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",4,6,,5.0,7/13/2017,"We came in with a party of 14 and were seating almost instantly. We had Ashely as our server and she was amazing. She was super patient as we attempted to tell her/ figure out our order. In addition to that, she informed us of the portion sizes for the people that were extra hungry.     The actual restaurant was clean, a little noisy, but inviting. And the chicken club sandwich was the best I have ever had."
Jenna N.,"Norwalk, CA",49,14,21,3.0,1/1/2017,"I visited this location after taking a boat ride in the balboa canals! i came with a group of 16, and i called ahead to let them know so they can prepare for us. we got there and it was very empty, so we were seated as soon as the table was ready.  eating at restaurants as a vegan can be kinda difficult but there's hope for me at bj's because of the pizza! i ordered a veggie pizza on a flatbread dough instead. i obviously asked for no cheese or butter on it.  when i received it it was SUPER skimped. i asked for no cheese NOT no pizza sauce.  i don't know how they thought this looked good enough to send out.."
Hussein E.,"Cypress, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/21/2017,Completely overlooked what pizza had on it. It came out and told them I want another one. They gave me fruit n crackers in the meanwhile while they made me a new pizza. Super nice n highly recommended
David R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",388,1297,1356,5.0,3/13/2016,"I don't like the pizza here, that's what I thought. The truth is that I went here and had pizza 20 years ago and I again didn't like it. It's not a ""real"" deep dish pizza and to me there are way too many really big tomatoes and I don't like tomatoes.  However the Chocolate Chip bouzouki's are to die for. I mean the really good and if you haven't had one you're missing out. So we went back there for a bouzouki and I thought I'd have a salad and watch everyone else in my party eat a disgusting pizza. Then as I was scanning was scanning the menus I was so pleased to see that there are new items on the menu that looked really good. Like a pesto pizza and a BBQ pizza. They had really good looking sandwiches and supper yummy salads.  So I'm here to tell everyone that the new menu is great and again the bouzouki again is yummy."
William M.,"La Habra, CA",25,18,34,3.0,5/20/2017,"Space is nice, two stories. Don't come here if you are craving those great BJ's avocado rolls though. You'll be sorely disappointed. They don't seem to carry the full standard BJ's menu. Service was great, however!"
D. C.,"Irvine, CA",2,43,71,5.0,10/9/2016,"This place was so friendly and the staff and manager were awesome. My family never been to BJ's I've been twice in the bay area. The last time was fir a job interview months ago, so anyway now I'm in solcal. My first reaction was wow this place is tiny and normally BJ's I've seen are huge. The outside at night didn't look like much but the real treat was inside. It was my birthday and man the food was so good. I felt drunk leaving and staggering and no I didn't have any alcohol drinks. I ordered the jumbo meatballs I was expecting only 3 meatballs. I ate maybe a dozen and ran out of pasta in my sauce. So I asked our waiter a very nice guy to have the cook boil more noodles. It was perfect since the sauce was so good and the rootbeer wings were excellent. It was something new I love wings and this was a unique flavor I never had. My free dessert was hmmn I don't know what it's called. Piezora ??? Its like ice cream on a cookie I got the salted carmel damn it was good. It was a nice simple meal with my family we all enjoyed our food and service. The place as my wife said it, was a nice cute size. They have 2 levels with tv no nasty smoking sorry if your reading this and your a smoker. I forgot my waitress name he even held the door open on our way out. He had blonde gair full facial hair like a mohawk but not really just comb back. Anyway I'll find out next time  I had a choice of Irvine and I picked Newport. I live in Irvine area and said hmmn kets go in a different area. Also the review stars were higher at this location. Parking well I parked down the street and walked 2mins it was free. The manager was nice I used my coupon I found online I think it was $10- $15 off any order of $35. Also sign up as a rewards premier for BJ's free app.  Thanks I'll be back"
Kris B.,"Oceanside, CA",399,602,4414,4.0,1/17/2016,"We had a few ups and downs at this visit but overall, I'm still fond of this place! Mostly because it's within walking distance from where we stay in Newport. It took awhile to be acknowledged by the obviously frazzled and busy manager on duty. It was a good reminder for me since I work in retail, that to just slow down and say ""I'll be with you in just a minute"" goes a long way! But she did eventually come over to the hostess stand and our party of 10 lucked out since another 10 top had just left. Our server Edwin did a good job taking care of my big, crazy family! Two favorite moments - his patience with my mom who does not want pineapple and my sister in law who does want pineapple, and why don't we just put pineapple on half the veggie pizza? Second favorite moment was when the three kids were all incessantly and loudly ordering chocolate milks and he was able to ignore them, smartly not getting involved. The pizza here is delicious! You cannot beat their deep dish pizza (except Zachary's in Berkeley) My brothers and Dad and I got the large BJ's favorite that is loaded with MEAT ($24.95). Large thin crust cheese for the kids ($10.25) and the medium veggie pizza for Mom and Sis-in-law ($20.95). Added 3 salads for $3.75 each. My Dad really enjoyed the taster set of beer for $7.95.  We finished off the meal with 4 Pizookies: Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate, Peanut Butter and the seasonal Pumpkin ($6.75 ea). Then off to the kids park next to the pier to have the kids run off all that sugar!"
Matthew C.,"Santa Ana, CA",180,19,1,4.0,1/27/2017,"I been to this location a good half dozen times. Never have had any problems, solid establishment. Myself and about 17 others went just tonight and our server was Ed (Edgar) I believe. He was exceptional - he got all of our orders, was quick with drinks, and bringing anything else out that we may have needed. He demonstrated great professionalism and genuine care. It is not everyday you get that sort of service from a server. That also was a common theme from other employees and the manager that helped served food and such. Great attitudes around. This BJ's is a great restaurant with a great staff, you won't be disappointed.  We also made reservations and was able to get the whole upstairs to ourselves. No hassle or anything. If you do have a big group, do call ahead and they will accommodate you."
Felicia M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",1,5,,5.0,8/18/2017,We celebrated my sons graduation here and the manager and service was top notch!  We had a very large party and they accommodated everything we needed.  From the personal service of the manager upon making the reservation to our superstar server.  Thank you for helping to make our special occasion extra special!
Abby H.,"Anaheim, CA",191,4,3,1.0,5/5/2017,"My boyfriend and I were trying to enjoy a romantic evening at this quaint establishment. When we walked in, it took about 5 min before anyone came to seat us. Then once seated we received absolutely 0 service. Like 0. The waiters continued to serve the people around us but seemed to ignore us. Once we had a waiter flagged down it seemed that we were a bother to them. When the waiter came to refresh our beverages he spilled water on the table and said, ""oh sorry,"" and walked away as the water continued to dribble off the table onto my boyfriends leg leaving us to clean up the mess. However, we would eat here again bc pazookies. (The waiter is the one that looks like Nev from catfish)"
Katie F.,"Pasadena, CA",1,26,,5.0,10/15/2017,We had the best server here - Thomas - who warranted a 5 star review. Everything was good but he was great.
A B.,"Newhall, CA",0,12,1,5.0,7/15/2017,"Great place to eat, compare  to the Bj's next to our house in Valencia , this one is very small,  but...the service is excellent, the waitresses are super nice and service is fast and efficient, Manager was very nice and made sure everything is ok. Bj's Manegemant should be proud to have a team like that!!"
CJ O.,"Irvine, CA",1,37,,5.0,7/8/2017,"Had a party or 13 and was quickly seated, all orders correct, and individual checks. Christina seated us, Saila was our waitress, and Amanda was the GM - each were very personable and would love to work with them in the future.  Several friends downloaded the BJs app and got free pizookies! So tasty! Thanks for a great experience."
Brittany F.,"Newport Beach, CA",10,9,2,5.0,7/8/2017,Because honestly who doesn't love bj's pizza? They  can get busy in the summer so if it's a Saturday night and the weather is amazing expect a wait but it's so worth it! We ordered a large pizza take out tonight and apparently they ran out of large boxes so they made us a small and a medium. And it's amazing! Yum!
Heather N.,"Garden Grove, CA",122,168,164,2.0,8/11/2016,"Incredibly annoyed at the portions given when you do take out. First of all, the $16 chicken alfredo was just way too expensive for the amount you get! I can go to Azar's and get two portions of what you gave me for the same price. Wouldn't recommend going here."
Amber T.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,4.0,6/6/2017,"The food was good. We sat outside on the patio and ordered a mini pizza and calamari and a couple of draft beers. The table tent on our table said that happy hour was from 3-7. Since we ordered at 6 we were expecting there to be a discount applied to our check. When the check came I asked our server and she said happy hour is only inside. So, my question is why management would choose to put table tents advertising happy hour on every table outside (There is nothing printed on the table tent that indicates that happy hour is only inside)that are not included in happy hour. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who was surprised when my check came. It seems like a lot of people have probably left with a bad taste in their mouth."
Chad H.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,4,,2.0,6/22/2017,"I've been going to BJ's since their first restaurant in Santa Anna in the 90s, I only go there for the pizza. My last trip there was disappointing, went to the BJ's on Newport Peninsula, and seems like they doubled the amount of oil they add to the pan before they make your pizza. Also, the new oil has like a artificial butter flavoring that's disgusting!  I'm going to have to find a new favorite deep dish pizza restaurant now..."
Joe A.,"Dana Point, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/27/2017,"Tom is an amazing server! I came in with my girlfriend and he styled us. We didn't know what to drink so he gave us samples. We had the best tortilla soup, a great pizza and the perfect beers. An all around great experience! Thank you tom for the amazing service we can't wait to visit you again!!!"
Chuck L.,"Chino, CA",20,3,,5.0,4/15/2017,we had a great meal after a day in Catalina.  Stephen was our server and was awesome.  we will for sure come back
Spencer L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,4,,5.0,5/19/2017,"Fantastic pizza and the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza is a personal favorite. The atmosphere inside is great, but we love to order takeout and take it back to the beach for a sunset dinner. Price is good, too, for the quality of the food."
Robert T.,"Escondido, CA",0,37,3,1.0,4/9/2017,"All I can say is... we sat at our table for 10 + minutes, no server ever came by.  Wouldn't be so bad except it was the first table into the restaurant and the whole time the hostesses were looking at us.   My advice, go next door! They want you there."
Monica M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/8/2017,"Loved the food and service, Richard knows how to keep his customers happy!! Service was on point!! Didn't have to look for Richard he was so anxious to keep make sure we were taken care of. Will have to let friends and family know this is a great spot"
Bekah C.,"Tulsa, OK",0,5,,4.0,4/3/2017,I recently visited BJs with a group of 25 for a family birthday. They called ahead to confirm and had everything ready upon arrival. Parking is a nightmare down there on the weekends and the waiter was very kind to wait for a few people. The good was great and the complimentary dessert was the perfect finishing touch.
Saul R.,"Pomona, CA",31,2,,5.0,4/2/2017,"The service was great. The food was lovely, had the spaghetti w meatballs, chicken lime and rice, and chicken Alfredo w broccoli. Amanda was awesome and took care of my coupon. Will come again."
Claudia P.,"Newport Beach, CA",62,10,4,5.0,1/17/2017,"I love this restaurant. I go for their kale and sprouts salad. The manager is always welcoming. She is really polite and goes out of her way to make sure that we are taken care of. I could go to a different BJs,  but I rather go there because they treat me like family. Everyone is really friendly and i always find parking.  lucky me!!!"
Jazmin V.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,8,,4.0,6/19/2017,"Went there yesterday on Father's Day and they held my reservation for 19 an extra almost 20 min. My group was all running late because parking is a nightmare. Ordered pizza and wings the basics, food was good."
Roland H.,"Dana Point, CA",29,60,10,5.0,4/21/2016,If you like thin crust this isn't the place for you. I can't describe how good their pizza is but it's awesome. I hear the other food is great too but I can't NOT order the pizza every time I go. I have been to a lot of pizza joints and this one is by far even as a chain the best. They also serve beer and alcohol so your covered there as well.  Go for the pizza you will not be disappointed.
Crystal C.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/1/2017,"Best service I've ever had at Bjs.. and my bf and I come here at least once a week! Sayla is the sweetest and kindest server. Now, I will only come back when she's working! Thank you for the mobile app heads up! Signing up now! Now we are really hooked!"
Michelle H.,"Compton, CA",140,3,,1.0,3/5/2017,"My friend and I decided to go to Bj's for her 21st birthday to enjoy their food and drinks. However, our experience was far less than enjoyable. We walked in around 1:30 and was seated right away, the waitress was nice and took our order. My friend ordered an alcoholic drink and was not asked to see her ID. We waited about an hour till we realized they were taking way too long for our food. A few minutes later the waitress who took our order came to our table and asked if our manager took our order. This was weird that she asked this because she was the person who took our order. Therefore, I called the manager over to ask if she placed our order and if she did not then cancel it. He walked into the kitchen then walked out and told us, ""I told them to stop making it so do you still want it?"" and I said no and he said, ""are you sure they are starting to make it"" which did not make sense because he just stated that he canceled it. If I can give them 0 stars I would, there was no apology for the horrible service either. All in all this was the worst dinning experience I have ever had, I will not come back to this establishment."
Christopher P.,"Oswego, IL",0,39,9,5.0,8/9/2016,This place has incredible food at exceptional prices.  I was weary at first but I'm so glad we stopped.  The entire family ordered something different and I friend everyone's food and it was excellent.  Food has great flavor too!
Joel U.,"Irvine, CA",0,54,10,4.0,11/8/2015,It was my first time at this location. It's the smallest Bjs I have ever been to. It's a two story building. We got sat upstairs. Sadly there is no elevator so if you have elderly or walking impaired guest please be aware. I didn't know they didn't have an elevator. Our server was nice. And food was great.  As a tip: they do NOT sell any alcohol and only serve house beers so no coronas or margaritas if your looking for that type of drinks.  Parking is near by but you have to pay 1.50 per hour.
