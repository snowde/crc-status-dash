Manny G.,"Santa Ana, CA",200,22,16,4.0,9/23/2014,"out of all of the Bjs I've been to, this one is the best.  The pizza here is the freshest to me, tasting the best. The crust is nice and firm and also fresh. The way it is put together nothing falls apart like at other BJs.  This is a much smaller location so it has more of a family feel and intimacy. Your server doesn't get lost and the management team is more hands on then those of the larger stores. I would definitely say that you get the best BJs service at BJs in balboa.  The only thing holding his location from 5 stars is the parking, and the fact that it isn't the full menu, nor do they have all the handcrafted sodas on tap. only the rootbeer!   My favorite is the Orange cream soda which you can't have!  Overall 4/5 stars... you will leave a happy camper after you bring the family in."
Jeremy A.,"Newport Beach, CA",147,15,3,5.0,6/8/2014,"The pizza wasn't perfect but the service and the pazooki were. Kenny, the manager, provided excellent service."
Cole H.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,4,,4.0,6/4/2015,"Great food. Great waitress. But the other blonde waitress and cooks were talking right by the kitchen door and consistently made eye with me and my girlfriend. As they were smiling and glancing at us, I felt very uncomfortable and thought they tampered with our food!"
Nina V.,"Artesia, CA",0,8,1,4.0,11/9/2014,This location is small and no bar but consistent with good taste and great pizzas as usual. Good service. They got rid of mac and cheeeseee at this location bring it back! Try their porter beer with a scoop of icecream!
Jason Towe J.,"Newport Coast, CA",3,30,21,3.0,10/28/2014,A little greasy pizza but it is never the less great pizza.  A little pricey too but it still has good flavors
Stefan J.,"Orange, CA",2,23,7,4.0,10/28/2014,Always a fan of the pizza and beer. This one in articular is our fav. It seems the pizza chef is the best in all of the bj's. Our waiter said he has been at this location for about 15 years and knows just the right way to make the pizza.
Jeff S.,"Anaheim, CA",1,43,16,2.0,4/24/2013,"VERY DISAPPOINTING SERVICE FROM THE MINUTE YOU WALK IN THE DOOR! Hostess told it would be no more than 15 minutes. 40 minutes later after being told it will just be another five or ten minutes, we were finally seated. Unless you are starved and can't find another place- go somewhere else. It's chain food, you can get it anywhere."
Ann R.,"Anaheim, CA",13,19,1,1.0,5/13/2013,"SERVICE WAS VERY POOR FROM START TO FINISH!!! Sadly disappointed in the service.  Granted it was Mother's Day, but we had reservations.  We were sat 1/2 hour after our reservation.  We told them we were limited on time and we began to immediately order.  We sat for 45 minutes waiting for our food only to have to tell the waiter at this point we have to get our food to go.  It took them another 15 minutes to get our food together and ready to go only to find they were missing two of our sandwiches. We took our food and left, finally, only to find that they got most of the sandwich orders wrong.   Very sad, pathetic service.  Would NEVER go back there again.  You can get that type of food anywhere and probably with better service."
Andrew D.,"Newport Beach, CA",70,36,515,5.0,12/11/2012,"Not a regular, but I LOVED this place.  1. The beers are awesome. You can't come here and not have one of their several tasty beers available. 2. I had the great white pizza, which was BOMB. Split one with my cousin, who eats a ton. We didn't finish it. 3. The Oreo Cookie Pizookie is definitely on my list for best desserts ever tasted. Funny how we couldn't finish the pizza, but we destroyed the pizookie when it came out. Ha."
Tammy G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",319,714,5721,4.0,9/18/2010,"My family and I have visited BJ's a few times. My kids like it mainly for the pizzookies, they rate the pizza itself as average. This last time, they ordered kids' personal pizzas without the tomatoes and it came almost sauceless with minimal cheese, but very thick puffy crust. Most adults seem to like the pizza and my father in law enjoyed the chicken fried steak. My chicken wings were good, however the cobb salad left a lot to be desired-- skimpy toppings and small for the price. I would have at least liked the turkey to be grilled or roasted, but it was the cubed deli stuff. We have never had to wait long to be seated. The staff is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is designed to be sporty and lively, there is always television sets playing sports channels and the patrons seem to be happy and talkative. Overall we have experienced good service and a fun, casual atmosphere. BJs is really more of an adult hangout than a family restaurant . I'd recommmend BJ's as a place to eat large servings of all-American style food, drink beer , try their home made brews - which are decent, and relax with friends. Decent chain."
Natalie L.,"Baldwin Park, CA",119,48,22,2.0,6/22/2014,"This is the worst BJs I have ever been too! The service is rude, the menu is only 1/2 of regular BJs restaurants. Seating upstairs is horrendous! It's hot, humid and the tables and chairs are uneven! I do not recommend eating here. I will never return to this location."
Jennifer C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",86,22,3,5.0,3/16/2014,Great food and service here everytime! Avocado egg rolls are the best! The Cobb salad I had was excellent and had the modifications I requested the first time. Love there beers too.
Jose B.,"Kensington, MD",2,24,11,4.0,8/3/2014,"The pizookie is as advertised. We tried 3 different flavors and all 3 were fantastic. Definitely the highlight. The deep dish pizzas were money as well. We got the Hawaiian and the meat lovers. Both were on point and unlike most deep dish pizzas, not overly greasy. Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of cheese and sauce. Our server was attentive and nice as well. So why not the 5th star? There are no cocktails here! We rolled in on a Saturday night with a group of 8 ready to rock (we'd been drinking on the beach) and to hear there was no liquor was a big disappointment. That said, they do have a nice selection of microbrews to choose from and affordable wine bottles as well. Overall, I highly recommend this spot!"
Kristy A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",50,12,1,1.0,11/1/2014,"Puddles all over the floor. The booth was sticky and covered in crumbs, the table next to us had food and plates all over with no one seated there. No one greeted us at our table, brought water over or anything...and it wasn't even busy...staff was socializing with each other instead. After 15 minutes we walked out and went to the new place next door, Cruisers, highly recommend skipping BJ'S and going straight to Cruisers."
Bridget K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",137,77,100,3.0,1/8/2012,"This is a BJ's Grill (I think that's what it says on the building), so it's not the full menu I've seen at other BJ's. There were no baked potatoes, for example. Now that I think of it, it's been a long time since I've eaten at another BJ's, so maybe they're all like this now. Clearly, I have very little BJ's knowledge, so I'll just move on to what vegan offerings they have. They had a ""light"" menu that had a veggie pasta dish that was vegan-friendly. Just ask to make sure they use oil instead of butter and stuff...you know the drill. I was actually surprised by how good it was. This location obviously gets busy (it's near the Balboa fun center and the pier), so the wait was about 30 minutes for our party of 7 at about 5:30pm on a Friday night in December. The host at the front was really on top of things, though, and we were able to drink a beer in the waiting area.  I guess to me, a three-star review means some place I had a good experience at but wouldn't make a big effort to revisit. That describes this BJ's perfectly. I will be fine with going there again if fate makes it happen."
Marianne E.,"Fontana, CA",26,67,18,4.0,4/17/2014,This location is much smaller than most other locations I have visited but we were seated right away and the service was great. Our order was served in a timely manner and the food was great. The Pizzookie is a must have desert so save room.
Erik V.,"Covina, CA",98,39,1,2.0,1/2/2012,"This was the original BJ's.   The home of the genius that is the Pazookie.  A place that was itself perhaps more flavorful than its pizza, with almost as much character as their excellent beers.  The place I hung out my friends after a day at beach, and the place I had my first date with my wife.   Was...   BJ's is everywhere these days.   No doubt some corporate pirate on vacation stopped in here with the family when his nanny had the week off, had a Pazookie and some good beer, and saw the golden opportunity of mass market food chain exploitation just waiting for a good corporate rape and pillage.   And rape and pillage they did.  Even the original BJ's in Newport was not spared. I haven't been back to original in Newport for a few years now, and so after a day on the water with the family, we couldn't think of a better way to end the day than with a pint and pizza at one of our favorite beach dives.  Now wish I hadn't.  My memories would have been better off.  No longer the charming beachside pizza/brewery hole-in-the-wall it's been remodeled and stripped of any of the character it once had, and replaced with a soulless, corporate- spreadsheet dictated décor that screams, ""We use microwaves!"" with a girlishly guilty squeal.  All highlighted with bullet points in a menu that looks like the addendum to the Cheesecake Factory Menu that includes those few frozen, pre-made items they didn't have room for.     The Pazookies used to be made from scratch.  They took a good 10 minutes, just like when you make cookies at home, and were served with huge scope of good vanilla bean ice cream.   Now they come out in seconds; are pre-made and re-warmed and served with some cheap no-name, imitation fake vanilla ice-cream-like substance that even my kids thought tasted fake.   While the pizza is more or less still the same, it too is now frozen first (at least the dough is, made somewhere else, and costs twice as much.   The stake through the heart though had to be that the ""beer machine"" was broken and they had no beer.  WTF?!  A ""brewery"" that can't properly tap their own kegs.  All they had were Pepsi products.  Freaking Pepsi!  How low can you go.   It was heartbreaking.  It's one thing when a place you love goes under, or just is over and done.  It's another when it's perverted by some cheap corporate model and turned into the Frat House version of Pizza Hut."
Craig R.,"San Diego, CA",1854,650,141,4.0,6/10/2009,This location is much smaller than the regular ones but more cozy and laid-back. This BJ's takes on the easy-going surf culture of the area. I always request to eat upstairs (I really don't know why). The staff is always super cool and my main reason to visit this location is the Pazookie. I'm not one for sweets but a good Pazookie will make me travel great distances.
Sarah B.,"Orange, CA",4,5,2,3.0,5/31/2013,"I'm always a fan of BJ's pizza's and pizookies, and I would definitely recommend coming here for the food. The service however is not very good. The waiters seem very uninterested in your presence. (I have been to this specific one maybe 4 times in the last two years, never have i had a good server.) If you, like me, care more about the food than the service I would definitely go here. But if you're about being treated well you'll probably want to go to a different place."
Kyle B.,"Corona, CA",0,11,4,5.0,5/14/2014,Very good service! People are very friendly. The food is really good and fast.  Got to love the cookie pies!
