BJ L.,"Saitama, Japan",160,107,8,5.0,5/23/2011,"Best west coast deep dish, hands down. And because it's my namesake,  could I give them less than 5 stars? I couldn't care less how full you are at the end of your meal, get a pizookie. Every pizza is awesome. Every beer (I've tried) is awesome. Every BJ's location is solid. I love me."
Michael D.,"Newport Beach, CA",123,104,49,3.0,12/2/2013,"BJs is decent pizza and standard American chain choices for food. I have been going here for years and it's not bad but it's not great. I have had the mozzarella sticks and they are only ok... Salads are decent. Beer is an upside, not a lot of choice but some good beers. The pizookie (sp?) a big cookie with ice cream is really good because it's fresh and warm when you get it."
Marcelo M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",116,102,14,5.0,5/4/2013,"Took the family here to celebrate a birthday, we got right in and sat at a great booth upstairs. The service was amazing and our server was one of the best I've seen, thanks Jesse! We had great food and a great atmosphere. When we eat at BJ's this will be the location we go to. I believe that requires us to pass two other locations to get here. Soooooo worth it."
April P.,"Chino, CA",34,9,,1.0,12/31/2013,"Our food and beverages were fine.  The menu is smaller then a regular BJ'S but they still have a decent selection.  My issue is the service we received.  It was awful, our first waiter was very slow and kept spilling things  on the floor (he was polite however), then we had a waitress start serving us and she had a very rude attitude!  I don't know what happen to the first waiter but I would have rather have continued dealing with his slow messiness than deal with her dirty looks and attitude.  Unfortunately the manager's attitude was even worse!  We asked to see the manager due to her attitude and the bill was incorrect.  He promptly fixed the bill but was incredibly rude.  I will never eat at this BJ'S again."
Cassie R.,"Riverside, CA",3,31,4,5.0,11/28/2013,Came here with the husband last night and we were both very satisfied! Saturday night and we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. Our waitress was so nice and friendly and never left us needing anything. We ordered the NitWit beer...oh em gee! So good!!! We ended up getting another because it was so good. I got the watermelon feta salad. Sounds weird right? It's incredible!!! Best flavor combinations ever! Hubby got the deep dish buffalo chicken pizza which was amazing but too spicy for my taste. It was by far the best food we ate on our entire weekend vacation in Newport. I don't know what people are talking about claiming the service is terrible and the pizza is gross! Total opposite! Best service ever and the pizza was great quality food. We're already planning to check out the BJs by our house.
Steve V.,"Phoenix, AZ",83,82,2,5.0,5/31/2013,"Okay, five stars here.  One of the best pizza's ever in my humble opinion.  This one brings home the sizzle.  Tasty piranha microbrew, pretty good wings, and great pizza.  View doesn't knock you out (there really is none), but location is great.  Eat your pizza and walk around the fun zone.  It's really that simple to enjoy your life!"
John E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,25,,1.0,8/27/2011,"My wife an I walked in and were seated immediately. When we sat down, nobody acknowledged our presence with a hello, drinks, or we'll be right with you. We got up and left after 20 minutes of watching waitresses scrambling to help everyone else arounds us including those seated after us. Preposterous indeed.  1 star for customer service or lack thereof."
Gina M.,"Orange, CA",433,445,1458,3.0,7/17/2012,"it's like a BJ's express. they don't have a full menu and the venue is much smaller than other locations. nonetheless, the service was satisfactory and the beer was great!"
Matt J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,24,3,1.0,6/5/2011,"BJ's pizza is terrible.  They call themselves ""Chicago Style"", but if you tried to feed this pizza to peple in Chicago they would slap you in the mouth.  The closest comparison I can think of is Pizza Hut's original style crust, which is NOT a flattering comparison.  Some of their other non-pizza menu items looked decent enough, and the restaraunts always have good ambience, but since they advertise themselves as a pizza place I feel the review should be based on their horrible, horrible pizza. 1-star rating aside, I will definitely go back to BJ's just for their pizookies.  This desert is a deep dish cookie served warm with ice cream on top, and it is freaking amazing.  If BJ's stopped selling pizza and just sold pizookies, I would change this rating to 5 stars in a heartbeat."
J B.,"Seal Beach, CA",2,1,,1.0,7/30/2014,This location offers only a limited menu. I am sure the food is normal BJ quality but if you think you know what you want better think again.
Laurel P.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,43,1,4.0,8/20/2012,"Friendly service; good, hearty American food.  A little noisy inside -- noisy enough that I had a hard time hearing the people seated across from me.  Good for families -- children's menu available."
Connor K.,"West Chester, PA",0,21,,3.0,7/3/2013,"It was good...but they made us wait while there were 6 empty tables all clean and ready. So when they finally sat us, it was a table that had been sitting empty for 15 minutes.  The food was good but besides pizza, there was not a lot of other selections. So if you are a pizza enthusiast, you should go here because they have a lot of it."
Orsolya D.,"North Hollywood, CA",835,799,1415,1.0,11/7/2009,"I am not one to completely bash a restaurant/store/etc...but this going to be my first based on my HORRIBLE experience. If I could give a zero star rating, I would! AWFUL!!!  This is was my first time at a BJ's and NEVER AGAIN will I patron another location or this one again!! I barely know where to begin... A group of 5 of us were celebrating a girlfriend's 29th birthday on a Thursday night. It was 9:30 and we were looking for dinner so to be respectful, we called BJ's to ask when they close and if they can serve a party of 5 at this time. We were told that the resturant closes at 10:30 and that they would love to serve us.  We show up to an almost-empty restaurant with the crew instantly giving us death-stares which signaled the, ""We wanted to close up so why are you here?"" mentality. We already called to get an ""okay"" so this was unacceptable. Despite this, we are seated and receive poor service instantly. Our first waiter was a young man who looked under 16 wearing flip flops and shorts claiming to not even work at the resturant but was ""helping a friend"". He took our drink orders but could only get water and not alcohol to he sent another waitress over. She arrives and gives us a sharp attitude. I ask for a drink and was denied because my license expired a few days ago. I told her how I already went to the DMV to get my new one but that they send it in the mail and it takes 2 weeks but I have the paper from the DMV, as well. Not to mention, even if the license is expired, you can still see that I am much over 21. My birthday does NOT decrease with an expired license. She explained that it was ""against the law"" to serve me. I understand if this was the case, but it was the WAY she explained the situation speaking to me like I was an underage teenager trying to purchase a drink. VERY RUDE and CURT.  Two members of our party purchased drinks. We were served by yet ANOTHER waiter (waiter #3) who brought the drinks and took our meal orders... to which we found out that they ""shut the ovens down an hour ago"" so we could ONLY order the pizzas. Why was this not explained immediately when the menus were placed into our hands?! And AGAIN, we called ahead of time to make sure we weren't coming into the restuarant too late. Then, the birthday girl got reprimanded for holding two drinks (we were taking pictures of a drink in each hand). We were told she can't drink two drinks at a time. Um, we were taking pictures, buddy. The actual food was suitable. Not the best pizza I've ever had. The toppings appeared undercooked and raw. The cheese was not even melted. The high light was the pizookie that the birthday girl received for free, HOWEVER, it was raw cookie dough and so underbaked that we didn't even finish it.  We finally receive our receipt to which we see that we were charged incorrectly with an added item on the receipt. This happens after we had to REMIND the waiter that he hasn't given a soda re-fill to one of our members after she already asked for one.  We pay our check and all employees dissapear and I literally had to peak my head into the kitchen to ask for our parking validation. Overall, this was one of the worst resturant experiences of my life. I'm from LA county so maybe Orange County BJ's are not up to par or maybe it is just this location. Either way, first impressions say a million words and I can safely conclude that I will NEVER eat here again and encourage others not to do so, either. I am highly disspointed especially because we were trying to celebrate a 29th birthday and were treated like 9 year olds. STAY AWAY FROM BJ'S!!! HORRIBLE!!!!! I'd rather eat a hot dog from a street-side vendor..."
Tim W.,"Orange County, CA",102,703,983,5.0,7/20/2009,"Location Location Location.  This in an OG BJ's location. It has been here in Balboa by the pier for over 30 years!!  People who compare it to the new, jumbo sized, cookie cutter BJ's that were built in every new shopping center over the past couple years ... well, you just don't get it.  Yes, this place is small. But it is a two story original location with tons of character.  This is what BJ's was back in the day when they were 'all about the pizza', before they added 10 pages to their menu to try and compete with Claim Jumper and Cheesecake Factory.  I have been coming to this location in Balboa since I was in high school! I was in Balboa last weekend and we stopped in here for dinner.  It always brings back lots of good memories from back in the day.  The place was busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes.  Service was great.  Food was great.  Atmosphere was great.  Highly recommend: BJ'S BACON CHEESEBURGER- Ground Angus beef, red onions, Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes and chopped dill pickles drizzled with signature burger sauce. AND BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE This location and the one in Lahaina , Maui are my favorites. Super casual, laid back and old skool."
Alonso R.,"Davis, CA",140,64,,5.0,5/21/2012,"I was here with my fiancee over the weekend, after spending the day in Balboa. Even though it was a Saturday night, and the place was crowded because of the Laker's game, they didn't take too long to get us a table. Our server was really nice, food was brought very quickly. My fiancee had a gluten free pizza that tasted like hot wings...it was amazing! Really good. I had a bbq pizza, which was really good as well. Really liked this place."
Quynh Nhu N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",218,74,258,5.0,9/2/2009,"PIZOOKIE!!! I love their pizookies... I bought it to go as a bday cake for my bf and got the 5 flavored one, and each flavor was delicious.  We had a hard time eating it all.. and there were 10 of us.  For the price they charged, it was cheaper than a bday cake... tasted better... and came with ice cream :) On top of that, their pizzas are delicious... the alfredo pizza... OMG sooo good... the bbq chicken... and even just the regular pepperoni was good.  It's by far one of my fave. pizza and hang out joints.  Hot wings are delish as well!"
Erik C.,"Charleston, SC",83,2,,4.0,5/8/2013,BJ's has a fantastic combination of that place you like to go to have a few beers with a buddy while also having the family element. The upstairs tables are nicely tucked away in order to give that semblance of privacy for a private conversation. The service is fantastic and the waiters/waitresses are very respectful. I never felt rushed or hassled by the staff and genuinely appreciated the prompt attention by the servers when called upon. I HIGHLY recommend the Meat lovers pizza and love the way they serve it to you. I am genuinely a BJ's fan and have a lot of respect for the folks that work there.
Natasha K.,"Forestville, CA",3503,400,1599,4.0,6/8/2009,"Excellent delivery service! I was at Sharkeez newport for the Laker game and craved the Great White alfredo chicken pizza, so I called to order and within 15 mins my delivery guy was there. Super friendly, on point with the condiments and big smile on his face :D If you want awesome food and great delivery service, go with this location!!"
Jeff L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",277,22,1,2.0,8/17/2011,"Maybe it's just this kind of food, with all the salt, fat and sugar.... Parmesan crusted chicken, mozzarella sticks, pizookie... My digestive system is angry at me. It tasted good while I was eating it. Then I started feeling funny. When I got home I got a headache and then barfed it all out. The food might have tasted good, but the after effects just aren't worth it in my mind. If you value your health, stay far far away."
Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,2/28/2009,"This location is very small. But, unlike the one in Huntington beach it was not overly crowded. I assume in the summer months it gets that way though.  The view is amazing. They are about 30 feet from the sand on the beach.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes. Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer. As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heif  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert. On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful. The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too. They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that. Overall I would say they have a smaller menu than other BJ's. Maybe less salad etc. They also seem to lack some of the options that a full bar would offer.  But, on the upside this location is a lot more quaint, cool, and romantic than some of the other BJ's I have been too. And it's a great deal of fun."
