Sandy T.,"Garden Grove, CA",228,427,35,3.0,4/28/2009,"My bf's sister gave me a gift card for BJ's and we were in the area so we stopped by this location.   It is nice to be so close to the beach, but their menu seems to be more limited than other locations.  Overall service was great and the food was as expected. I think I kept from giving it 4 stars because I am kicking myself for not remembering my box of leftovers.  I had only eaten a bite on my sandwich and maybe 10 fries, so it was essentially my full meal left behind!  I know this isn't their fault, but I am still pissy about it."
Rob W.,"Orange County, CA",34,648,1172,5.0,2/27/2009,"My partner and I are long time fans of BJ's Pizza. Don't ask how long, that's just rude. Anyway, we've given up on the big chain style locations. Too hit and miss on service and food. Too noisy, like one huge sports bar at times. We were at this location about a month ago for an early dinner and it was great. Service was good and the pizza was really good. We tried the new special pizza at the time which was Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza. Loved it.  Seems like if you loved this location years ago than you will now too. I imagine the kitchen being fairly small and not really losing control with such high volumes like the big restaurants. Can't believe I'm only the 3rd review here. Guess the coolness factor is gone for some?"
Cassie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",346,10,7,4.0,7/18/2010,"welp, the hostess with the braces? must have been her first job. u kinda have to put ur foot down with her. she actually wanted to make us get up from out table and wait back at the front so it could be ""properly"" wiped clean of the water rings from the previous occupants. i was like ""no thanks sista....we're good."" she was also really confused when we said there was 5 of us and she made a pain expression since there were only 4 chairs. i suggested she get one of the ones from a table next to us that wasn't in use. um, duh?  i hate chain restaurants like the next guy but bjs (god do i hate to say i just ate at bjs for numerous reasons) but i always leave with a happy belly. the nitwick beer was awesome, meatloaf sandwich pretty darn comforting, and the waiter let me have a mini pazookie. they couldn't validate our particular parking stub (we ended up having to pay $14 for parking) so we asked for a free bday treat and he was happy to bring it to me just for saying it was my birthday.  the people watching is the best!"
Jim S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",543,64,15,5.0,2/15/2012,We had great service here for my fiance's birthday! I wish I could remember the name of our waiter to give him credit! We've never been treated so well at a Bj's! All the Huntington Beach Bj's have bad service.
Thomas S.,"San Francisco, CA",58,19,1,4.0,12/8/2013,"Good food, amazing service from Matthew. Really enjoy the BBQ chicken pizza and pizookie (ice cream and giant chocolate chip cookie). Like the Jeremiah red beer and their pale ale (fairly similar to Sierra Nevada pale ale). Not a big fan of their salads -- stick to the pizzas. July 2013."
Mr B.,"Orange, CA",2,96,57,3.0,8/17/2013,"This location is very different than the other locations since it has been there for many years (maybe 20 or longer). It is very small and service here is very slow. Things are just done differently. It used to be way way better before they fell inline with the corporate line. They used to have a great pasta salad but they got rid of it for greasy french fries to be similar to the rest of the BJs restaurants. They have a limited menu and although many things have changed here to line up with the menus at the rest of the BJs be prepared for things to be different. I wish things could go back to the way they used to be here. Food is ok, maybe better than other BJs. Long waits for everything. Don't come here in a hurry or just call ahead and get to go."
Jeremy L.,"Long Beach, CA",23,31,,2.0,8/20/2013,"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Waited for 10 mins until we were greeted even though it wasn't busy, waitress was chewing gum (very obviously), the manager seemed careless considering everyone was standing around drinking Starbucks (except the ONE Busser, he was good). Limited menu but the food was good. Beach and edinger location is better hands down."
Chelsea C.,"San Francisco, CA",269,237,3,4.0,4/14/2009,"I love Bj's Pizza. i have dreams about the artichoke pizza.  Kinky, cheesy, saucy dreams.  Ok, so maybe I really love BJ's pizza."
Daniel S.,"Seal Beach, CA",7,94,,4.0,7/9/2011,"Really fun BJs, never knew there was one here in Newport. Parking sucks but the food and server were great. Nutty Brewnette bear was amazing alongside a cigar and beef dip. Pazookie at the end never hurts either."
Derek K.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2013,I saw and found COCKROACHES everywhere and our server with a annoy high pitch voice keep flirting with my dad and bumping her butt against him.....
Melissa K.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,191,2,3.0,6/28/2008,"Watch out when going to this location--it is much smaller than the regular ones and their menu is therefore limited also. Their salad selections in particular are down to the basics--caesar, wedge, and maybe one more. I think they only have beer and wine here too.  The crowd is hit and miss, one time I was here and the whole place was packed with junior high girls and their mother's, other times its been super empty."
Ryan C.,"Pomona, CA",5,44,2,4.0,1/1/2011,wow... great location!!! our navigation took us through Newport beach auto ferry.. first time ever.. fun fun!! BJ here is small but very cozy.. and very close to the beach.  close to plenty of parking. Food is as expected from BJ.. service.. decent.  But LOCATION!!!
Alison W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,176,14,4.0,6/10/2011,"Hard to find if you are driving, especially at night. Although rather small it has a nice interior. We ordered quite a few of the appetizers as well as our entrees and all was tasty and well portioned. Price was not bad, especially for the appetizers. Service was ok, and wait wasn't too bad (went on a week night)"
Jessie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,4/26/2013,"They make awesome mojito here, not too strong not too citrus-y . Not every places get it right."
Chris G.,"Ridgecrest, CA",45,6,1,2.0,7/23/2011,The food was ok. But as we were waiting to get served a roach walked on the back of our booth. YUCK!
Stephanie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",669,212,9,2.0,9/8/2009,"I know it is tragically uncool to like chain restaurant food. I don't freaking care. I like BJs. They have an extensive menu loaded with pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas and even baked potatoes. But if you ask me what the best thing on the menu is, it is the Pizookie. Damn that thing is delicious. Its like your own personal cookie cake, you know, the kind you see at Mrs. Fields and you always hope someone will get you on your birthday... only this one is covered in ice cream! The food is pretty standard here, not bad, not great... the only reason I am giving this location a 2 instead of a 3, the service 9 times out of 10 is AWFUL. I have honestly had some of the worst service I have ever had in my life here. I will probably be back, because Balboa is small and there are limited options within walking distance, but if you are torn between this and Ruby's Diner, go to Ruby's Diner..."
Anna J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,,5.0,6/1/2013,"I stopped in for a quick bite while out for a walk along the beach. There was no wait, the service was friendly, the food fresh and satisfying, and the berry cider delicious!"
Dave S.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,1,1.0,5/17/2011,"Location was great, beer was good, but ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and ended up on the toilet the entire night.  I don't know if I got food poisoning or what, but I would double check the food before I eat anything.  It was so bad had to take off work the next day to sleep because I couldn't get any sleep the night before.  It was horrible."
Pamela M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",116,245,4,5.0,2/21/2007,How can I be the first to review BJ'S??? LOVE IT!! have been coming to this location for years and might actually be relocating down the street with the husbo. The pizza is AWESOME! We always get the same thing. Husbo starts us off with a pitcher of the berry burst cider and he gets minestrone soup. Then we get the pizza 1/2 sweet pig and 1/2 BJ's favorite. Then you can't leave without a pizzookie!!!! You can get that 1/2 and 1/2 too. This is not a good place to eat often though - TOO FATTENING!!
Matt E.,"Lafayette, CA",50,1,,4.0,1/16/2011,"Smaller than most BJ's, but still has a great atmosphere.  It can get loud downstairs, but the balcony is much better for conversations.   BJ's has my favorite pizza ever - have a BJ's classic combo with a Jeremiah Red and bask in the perfection."
