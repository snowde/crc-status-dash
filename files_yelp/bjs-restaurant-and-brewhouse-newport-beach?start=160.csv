Keith G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,11,,4.0,1/3/2011,"Ate at this BJ's on 12/29 with a party of 5. -Unfortunately, the power went out twice during our visit. -Fortunately, the wait staff and manager were all extremely helpful and pleasant, and the manager more than once offered to allow us to skip out on our tab even though the power outage was beyond their control (nor did it adversely affect our visit). As other reviewers have indicated, this location is smaller than other BJ's, but I will definitely be back, thanks mostly to their service."
Jenn C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,47,19,5.0,6/8/2010,Such a great location. It's a super small BJ's which makes it great. Took a walk down the boardwalk and then stopped in and ate delicious pizza.
Nick M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,17,9,5.0,12/27/2010,"Nice cozy place, friendly servers, good food and beer. Smaller than most Bj's. Had the nachos and pale ale. Both were excellent! Servers did not rush us. Took walk around Balboa Island to view Christmas lights, then jumped on ferry to Balboa Pennsula and found BJ's.  After a relaxing meal we took romantic walk on Balboa pier before taking the ferry back to the Island. Nice place to take a date, noise level was just right so you could have a private conversation without the next table hearing you."
Tamara J.,"Santa Ana, CA",149,406,5,3.0,6/25/2009,"Hung out at the beach with the 12 year old today and decided he needed feeding. This is what he chose. It was about 2pm, and there were very few people there. Shame one of them was one of those undisciplined screaming devil spawn and it's oblivious, rude spawn-er. I hate you and wish bad things for you. Service was very good and attentive. I had the bbq chicken salad and broccoli cheese soup. The soup was tasty, but had cooked too long. The broccoli had turned to mush with little woody pieces. blech. The salad was good. Very generous with the chicken, loses points for not using fresh corn. My midget had the bacon cheeseburger pizza. He loved it. But he's 12. I thought it was too greasy and the sauce on top- no idea what it's supposed to be- has no business on a pizza. I felt our order took quite a while to get to us, given the light business they were doing. Overall, I'll give them another shot someday. When I want to spend $35 for lunch with no beer involved."
Rory M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",41,33,,4.0,12/6/2009,"BJ's is great..  Good food, good beer, good pazookie..  The pizza is bomb, the french dip sandwhich is bomb, the waitresses at the HB location are gorgeous and very friendly."
chris b.,"New York, NY",79,200,3,4.0,10/26/2009,"I go to this BJ's and the one on Jamboree in Tustin depending on what type of mood I'm in.  This one is quieter, more family oriented.  I even once went here with a book and got some studying done while gut-busting on a pizza.  No full bar at this location kind of sets the tone.  It has a less corporate feel and the staff is smaller and seems more tight knit.  You can't go wrong with servers Marcie or Jane.  Be nice and they might hook it up!  This place really works for unwinding on evenings during the week.  The food is quality and if there's something wrong just let them know.  If you are in a rowdier mood check out the one in Tustin."
Ross N.,"Newport Beach, CA",249,59,,5.0,12/21/2011,Diego at the Newport restaurant is second only to the old school blacken chicken pizza with Alfredo sauce.
amber h.,"Riverside, CA",1,20,1,5.0,6/8/2010,I always go here when I go to new port. Its right by the beach and all the little shops. I love the pizza and beer. Also the wedge salad is very refreshing and tasty.
h l.,"Riverside, CA",11,81,5,4.0,9/1/2009,"I love this BJ's, its location is great but full of children, families and babies. It isnt your normal BJ's with a bar area. It is very small capacity, and they only serve their brews. The menu is paired down, but still has all of the favorites. I would say if you go on a weekend to expect a wait, but its the best place to eat in the area for a reasonable price and the food is always delicious."
John L.,"Fullerton, CA",0,18,,2.0,4/2/2012,I love BJ's!   Just not this one.  I figured I'd never been down to the Newport one and I was with an out of town guest so it I could kill two birds with one stone by taking him to BJ's @ the Beach.  The menu was a fraction of the size as normal.  It was tight and cramped.  And of course there was no parking.
Jim G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,37,,4.0,9/15/2011,"Always have had friendly efficient service at this location.  The atmosphere is upbeat and usually on the fun side.  It's a little tight inside if they are busy, but their craft beers help ease that pain.  We usually order a deep dish pizza made our way, and have always enjoyed.  Nice place to eat and casually hang out at for a while after an afternoon at the beach.  The location is walking distance from the water."
