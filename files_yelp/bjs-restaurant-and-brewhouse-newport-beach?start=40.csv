Paul A.,"Anaheim, CA",394,1075,513,4.0,12/25/2014,"This old school bj's is great. Coziness is king here and eating here always makes me feel nostalgic. My family and I had s tasty white pizza worj artichoke dip. This was the perfect place to stop before our harbor cruise to see the boat parade and house lights. It took awhile to get service, but once it arrived the rest of our visit was great,"
Stella G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/14/2017,Ritchie was our server and he was awesome!! Really kind and concerned about giving us the best service. The kitchen made a mistake and put chicken on my salad which I thought was no big deal as they sent out another salad that was perfect but Ritchie served us an amazing Pizzookie on him!  What a doll : )
J J.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,17,,5.0,2/21/2017,"EXCELLENT EXCELLENT Pizza!!! Get the ""Great White"" pizza!! Sooo good!!! Love this place.. kid friendly too with their color crayons that don't roll off the table-- and kids activity paper. Service was great.. caring waiter and manager.."
Rachel H.,"Honolulu, HI",1,6,3,2.0,8/30/2016,"Food is awesome, service is not. I went in today with two little kids and our server ignored us the whole time. Anytime she came over it was because I said something to her as she serviced her other customers around us or I got up to get her or another server I saw if I couldn't find her. Before this, the girl that gave us our seat barely made eye contact and mumbled to us that our server would come. So I give two stars because I love their food, just not impressed with the service at this location at all."
Keilani W.,"Castro Valley, CA",2,1,4,2.0,8/16/2014,"Waiting, waiting, waiting... But the pizookie has not arrived. We ordered one pizookie & the beignets. 10 mins after we ordered it to-go they told us they didn't have beignets... Creating a weird situation  Weirrrrrrrrrd. So we got an extra pizookie + an mini pizookie in place of the ""missing beignets"". Our whole group was confused. The workers kept us waiting for almost an hour."
Ron L.,"Rialto, CA",19,10,1,4.0,8/21/2016,"Went here for linner, after a day at the beach. Seating is limited for big parties but food is really good! A little pricey. Overall good food and beer!"
Jessie L.,"Sacramento, CA",56,110,125,4.0,11/1/2015,"I liked this location because it is on the beach. Parking sucks though. Also there isn't a full bar, so no Irish rootbeer. Our server was a bit rude, but satisfactory. We came for early dinner with my mom on vacation. I didn't see the small bites tomatoe mozzarella salad on the menu, but they did have it. Thank goodness! One of the reasons I come. My counterpart part comes for the Jeremiah Red and the blackened bleu burger. I had a small deep dish with jalapeño and ham. Amazing as always. I love love love their deep dish pizza. My ma had the club Sandwich. All were very tastey. I definitely had to try their pumpkin pazooki. Was very rich, but filled my daily pumpkin void. Very yummy. Try their pumpkin beer too! Pretty good. I have never been disappointed with their good. Not super pricey either. Approx 9-13 per dish. Irvine location is still my favorite."
Iris L.,"Irvine, CA",911,41,26,2.0,8/11/2014,"The upside to this BJ's location is that it's warm, cozy, and next to the beach. Other than that I'm not sure what to say. We went here for a friend's birthday but when we entered I didn't think it would be that small because I've always gone to other BJ locations and it would be a moderate good size. The size didn't bother me too much but the food on the other hand kind of did.  I ordered the Clamchowder soup in a bread bowl and the first thing that I thought of when I took my first sip was that it was way too salty. It felt like they accidentally dropped the salt container in the big pot of soup and thought we wouldn't notice it... I was kind of disappointed too at the same time because you can't really go wrong with clam chowder... but I guess I did go wrong. I also ordered the large BJ Special pizza with my friends and that on the other hand was a better decision. It had  a lot of toppings especially olives, not sure why it was so drenched in olives in comparison to the other ingredients haha. But nonetheless it was good. The crust was soft and it had a nice taste to it.  Since it was my friend's birthday, she got a free pizookie which was delicious! Just wish my clam chowder was just as good."
Kimberly B.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,5,,2.0,7/23/2016,I have been to two BJ's - one in Las Vegas and this one. They were polar opposites. This one had horrible service and poor quality food. The waitress (when she interacted with us which was maybe three times) was exceptionally rude and did not know the menu at all. I asked two specific questions and she answered both incorrectly (I found the correct answer later in the menu). The food took a very long time to come and it was not busy at all. The food was sloppily thrown together on the plate as well. They never did bring the appetizer and my son had a coupon for a free pizzookie and she got irritated about that. I will never go to that BJ's again. The BJ's in Vegas has great service and great food!
D B.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,144,192,1.0,5/24/2016,"Waited over 15 min watched the girl serve the 1 table she had to deal with...rest of restaurant was empty. Never bothered to ask if I wanted a drink or was ready to order or anything. So I left. She obviously didn't want my $$ today or a tip...you know, for her great service. Lol. Will never come back here again. Stopped eating at bjs in ontario years ago for the same reason. Only came back here because of the high school memories at the beach. Thanks for ruining them with your crappy service."
Lindsey M.,"Newport Beach, CA",156,1,,1.0,7/4/2016,Terrible service very slow they don't answer your phone call orders or get your food out in time.
Michael M.,"London, United Kingdom",0,14,4,5.0,12/8/2016,great food - i have been there many times and will go back .  service is usually great .  pizza is very different than most places - dip dish ..  they have lots of other things that are really good too.   deserts are good but very fattening
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,4.0,12/7/2011,"Of all the BJ locations I've been to, the Newport Beach location is probably my favorite. It's smaller and can get pretty loud. Parking isn't easy during the day or on the weekends but I tend to only go at night during the week, where you can park near the pier for free, after 6:00 PM.  Only three parties in the place - upstairs seating area closed. Slow business usually equates to excellent service. Which it was. Ian was the perfect server.  Took advantage of the Holiday Party for 2 promotion. Soup and/or salad, 1 medium signature selection pizza and a regular size Pizookie for $19.95.  It was a nice, enjoyable dining experience. Food was good. Dessert was awesome."
Mitzy B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",543,297,40,3.0,1/29/2014,"Baby BJs! Half the size of a normal menu The food itself was good, but I wouldn't return to this location. I go to BJ's for the ambiance, bar feel, and watching sporting events, and this place is not good for that."
Gracie O.,"Honolulu, HI",1,12,3,1.0,12/27/2015,"I came into this BJs last week because I really wanted the kale and Brussel sprout salad. I go to the BJs at the Block in Orange all the time but I figured since I was in the area, I'd stop here. No full bar, that's fine. I'll have a beer. No big deal. So I order my salad and im extremely excited for it. It takes 30 minutes to hit the table. It was seriously the saddest salad that I've ever seen. The kale was old, the Brussel sprouts weren't really roasted and it just looked sad, probably more sad than I did. My server was no where in sight so I had to bug a different server to grab her. When she finally came I explained that the presentation was throwing me off because I have this salad all the time. She went on to say ""our salads are pre-proportioned and that's what it should look like"" Hmmm... I didn't want to waste my time, 1 she didn't understand what I was saying and 2 if she can't offer good service how can she possibly have knowledge of the food?    The manager then came over and asked how everything was, I told him about my experience with the server and he kindly listened and then asked ""did you save room for a pazooki""  I didn't even finish the salad and how was a pazooki supposed to help the fact that the kale and Brussel sprouts were OLD?  Safe to say, I would have much rather bought a store packaged salad from trader joes instead, and yes, I will do that next time."
B B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,,3.0,4/8/2016,"Probably should have eaten somewhere else, but it was raining and we were able to be seated quickly. Service was fine, but the food quality was not. Lettuce in salad was wilted, chicken in sandwich was pink and chewy. A little quality control from the kitchen would improve this restaurant."
Kira W.,"Newport Beach, CA",74,213,147,4.0,1/16/2015,Only come here for the pizzookies...which are always heavenly. A chocolate chunk pizzookie makes everything better.
MICHELLE C.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,158,37,5.0,3/5/2015,"Stumbled upon the place after parking near the pier and looking for a place to eat dinner. Was surprised to see a BJ's here but have enjoyed it so thought we would try this location. Even though they don't offer the entire traditional BJ's menu, there is plenty to choose from! We ordered a wedge salad, BBQ chicken salad, French dip & Sm deep dish pizza w/mushrooms, roasted Brussels sprouts (yes...sooooo darn good!!!) & tomatoes. Everything was delicious especially the BBQ chicken salad (lots of chicken breast) and the pizza! Our waiter was Arturo who was wonderful!! Really enjoyed him and the hostess who sat us was delightful as well. This place is a treasure in Newport Beach  Will be back & highly recommend!!!"
Cat D.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,21,,1.0,3/1/2016,"Well where do I start..... I came here and was expecting too much I guess you could say... Ok so they have no bar! Just ""House beers"" the menu wasn't much of a menu it was very limited not a lot to choose from ... The service was ok just ok! I think I would have gotten better service at Denny's! But anyways I order a something chicken club sandwich and let me tell you I was pretty hungry and my whole appetite just went down the drain when I saw blonde hair on my sandwich..... I went with two other friends and they were disappointed as well... Would I go back to this place again ? No never ever ever! Horrible service"
Logan F.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,3,1,5.0,7/18/2015,Such an amazing meal! Everything was fast and prompt. Service and food was amazing. One of the best burgers I've ever had!
