Charles R.,"Irvine, CA",163,167,271,5.0,1/28/2015,"Ate here a couple years ago. Usually go to BJ's in Irvine and Huntington Beach. It is located in the building that was the Prison of Socrates in the 60's and 70's. Use to listen to Tim Morgan play folk music here. This is the 2nd BJ's - it opened right after the original one in Santa Ana.  Typical BJ's faire. I had chicken tenders and Pam had a Brewhouse burger. All was good, and the service was great."
Nancy D.,"Newport Beach, CA",185,10,,5.0,3/24/2017,"Where do I even begin. Although I had never been that interested in trying this place, my friends picked it so my expectations were already on the lower side. My God, did my opinion change fast. Everything about this restaurant experience was perfect from the amazing food to the impeccable service. You would not expect this from a pizza chain. The house hard cider was berry flavored and extremely refreshing. The deep dish pizzas were phenomenal and came with a ton of different topping options, I loved how they had ""mini"" sizes so I didn't have to split with any one ;). To top it off, we were offered a free dessert simply for downloading their app. When I tell you this dessert was the best dessert I've ever had I'm not kidding. They offer several flavors of cookie skillets with ice cream and they are just so perfect. I should probably also mention that our server was one of the best I've ever had, she was extremely attentive and thorough. Definitely come to this location!!"
Shelby T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",213,5,,5.0,10/14/2015,I went to bjs in balboa tonight and my server Edwin was just out of this world. I didn't have to ask for anything because he was just on top of it. Awesome experience!
Josh J.,"Corona, CA",72,6,,5.0,8/22/2014,"Great service and great food! This store is smaller than the regular BJ's, but it was so nice not to be in a huge restaurant that was loud, yet still getting the sam quality of food.  Manny was our server and he rocked it! Management came by our table and said hi and wanted to make our dining experience great, and that they did.  Thanks BJ's for another awesome dinner and good time!"
Trish S.,"Escondido, CA",910,82,271,1.0,8/10/2014,"Normally I love BJ's. However I was so disappointed in this one, I will never go back to this one. If you are looking for shots or other liquor they have NO BAR Here.Its literally down the street from the pier and you would think it would have a bar, like the surrounding places but they don't. Their menus also is pretty much cut in half, and doesn't offer like the other BJ's do. YAY when you have picky kids and there's like not so much to chose from.  I always get a Jeremiah Red when I go to BJ's I am not sure what they served but it was not a Jeremiah red. Wasn't even the same color. We were here yesterday, and had the kidos. My oldest ordered a Chicken and Shrimp Cesar salad, and the shrimp was still raw and the chicken was pink..WTF. My youngest ordered the chicken fettuccine plate. He was sick all night and threw up all morning (today). I didn't see what his chicken looked like, but I am assuming that's what it has to be because none of the other kids are sick (they ordered other food). The Birthday boy wanted a Shirley Temple, and again I am not sure what they gave him BUT it wasn't a Shirley Temple. It's not a complex drink. The bathroom was disgustingly gross. All of the toilet paper was sitting on top of the toilet, as if someone was playing tetris with them. The roll holder was just chillin with nothing on them. From the looks of the bathroom it didn't appear to have been cleaned in a LONG TIME.  Its a very small place compared to most of the BJ's I have been too. Was horribly loud. There was a group of 50 somethings who were so loud you literally could not hear the person next to you, or our waitress. They sounded like a bunch of hyenas. I thought I was in Newport not the San Diego Zoo. I would give this place a minus 10 stars. Don't come here you are better going to Taco Bell, at least their bathrooms are clean while you have the runs! If you're into watching games like Football, Baseball and what not they had ONE TV that I could see. T~"
Todd J.,"Newport Beach, CA",271,224,83,4.0,3/18/2013,"I delivered pizzss here when I was 17. Loved it then, love it now. Although they have updated the menu with all sorts of fancy items, I keep it old school.  Chicago deep-dish style is what BJ's is all about. And they do a good job of it. I love how the tomatoes are all roasted from the oven. Although the Newport location does not have a brewery, all the beers are available. While the beers arnt ""mind-blowing"" they are decent.  I know this may sound strange....but they have good ranch dressing. Service is good and friendly... The pizookie is the little cherry on top. Its a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream on it. A must order!"
Amanda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,654,1357,3.0,9/29/2014,"They only have beer and wine, which is ok, I guess. The food selection could be better. I feel like BJs was good 10+ years ago and hasn't really kept up with the times. That said, the service was good and friendly, and they got us in and out pretty fast."
Bree K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",437,7,2,5.0,1/22/2016,Really awesome experience! Took all of my cheer girls here for dinner after a basketball game (there were 17 of us) sat us right away it was also a Friday night! Ethan our server did such a great job!!!! Get Ethan the next time you want to eat here!
Jessica M.,"Riverside, CA",7,55,37,3.0,7/9/2015,So if you are coming for the deap dish pizza or a pazooki then do come but not if you are in a hurry. This place is usually crowded due to its location. The flatbread pizzas aren't great. Servers were nice and did their best and management seems to jump in to assist when needed.
Ivy T.,"Santa Ana, CA",479,472,253,4.0,5/22/2014,"This BJs is located right next to the beach! It is smaller than most BJs, but I guess is why they have the disclaimer ""BJs Grill"" in its name. The place was small but there is upstairs and downstairs seating.  We ordered a small pizza, half meat lovers and half with mushrooms. It came out fast and was made with the thick pizza deep dish crust that BJs is known for. A small pizza is more than enough for two people and they did not go cheap on the toppings. The Meat Lovers pizza was packed with ham, sausage, and pepperoni.  We also ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip appetizer. The dip was not as chunky but more watery. It tasted okay with the chips, but could be much better. Service: Service was great! Our waitress was friendly. We even told her we were kind of in a rush and she pushed our orders right through the kitchen. I believe she had a waiter in training with her who also helped us out. When walking out, they gave me a to go cup and refilled it with the Strawberry Lemonade that came out! How nice! Just so you know: Parking is limited here so bring quarters for the meter parking."
Kammi K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",160,4,2,5.0,11/14/2015,Thanks for being open till 11! Made our drive down to the beach worth it! Thanks for also hiring cute wannabe hipsters
Michelle T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",779,999,1108,3.0,4/7/2015,"Awhile ago,  when I discovered this might be the closest bjs to me I was excited until I went there and saw how limited their menu is.  Both their drinks and food menu is pared down. Mostly appetizers, salads, pizzas, and beers. The place is tiny compared to a normal location.  The selling point is how close to the water it is for a quick bite before or after the beach."
Hattori L.,"Orange County, CA",3,26,,1.0,5/21/2015,The foods not bad.  However the service has really gone down over the years. Not good service.Good memories don't always equal good food. For those reasons I'll not go back there if I don't have too.
Nazi G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",5,72,29,5.0,4/19/2015,I liked the food and our server was a real life Barbie according to my kids. She looked just like Barbie doll. Very pleasant as well. I would recommend this place.
Chris G.,"Birmingham, AL",29,193,7,3.0,6/12/2015,Not bad. Decent brews. A good French Dip and my co-worker loved her pizza.
Mel H.,"Orange County, CA",285,417,2654,4.0,10/7/2012,"Came here for dinner with a friend. Was bummed that they only serve Chicken Tacos for lunch, so I resorted to Fish Tacos. I didn't like the tortilla so I just ate the insides..the fish with some special sauce.  It also comes with 3 different types of sauces: chipotle sauce, avocado sauce, and salsa.  With 3-color tortilla chips!! YuM!!  Oreo Cookie Pizookie was actually VERY good!! I'm usually not a fan of oreo cookies, but this was really delicious!"
George P.,"Los Angeles, CA",265,364,4,4.0,6/2/2014,"I little BJ never hurt anyone, especially by the beach.  Small compared to all of the others I have been to but was a good experience.  Waitress were prompt and food was as expected for a party of 6.   Keep on yelping"
Brian M.,"Escondido, CA",83,18,,5.0,12/5/2015,"As the saying goes, the best spice is none other than one that has been tempered with several hours of starvation. We were positively famished when we walked into BJ's tonight, and for that reason, the large pizza we consumed brought a satisfaction that cannot be easily replicated. The service was fast, the NBA game was close, and the carry out box was out of this world. Would I go back? More like, when will I go back? Well, I'd like some decent parking at the very least, but I'd say this establishment is a keeper."
Simone R.,"Irvine, CA",10,31,27,1.0,1/17/2015,"BEWARE! This is a smaller BJ's so they barely serve any food. They don't have baked potatoes, salmon, etc. Pissed me the fucked off!"
Linda B.,"Garden Grove, CA",13,19,,1.0,6/15/2015,"Stopped by for dinner on a Sunday night. Was told there it was gonna be a 30 min wait, so they asked for our cell phone # to call us when our table was ready. We came back 30 min later to check on our table and they said they called for us, though not actually our cell phone, just yelled out our name. So annoying... why ask for our cell phone # then?!  Told us we would have to wait another 15 minutes... so we said hell no we're not waiting. They ended up seating us in 5 minutes since we disputed. As I was sitting in the indoor waiting area, the manager (I think), short white blond hair lady, came over and said ""I need the chair."" Didn't ask nicely, didn't say please, nada. So freaking rude. So me and the other people sitting along the wall had to all get up.  Service was slow and food took forever to get out. Granted, our waitress was nice. But boy did it take forever for everything to come out and check out. When we finally got our food, we noticed the table next to us who were seated before us hadn't even order. OMG that sucked to be them. I've been to so many better BJ's. Never coming back to this location again!"
