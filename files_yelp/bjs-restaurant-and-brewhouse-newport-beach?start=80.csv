Julian D.,"Newport Beach, CA",100,81,1,3.0,3/28/2015,One lonely day I came in here after looking at the name without realizing it was a restaurant. 30 minutes later I left with a confused look on my face and a belly full of mediocre food.
Eric V.,"Irvine, CA",296,149,33,3.0,4/12/2014,"Excellent choice to stop by after a day at the beach. Deep dish pizza's the main attraction here IMO. Come here with a large party and share! Individuals can get expensive. Anywho for the food: BBQ Chicken Pizza - Its a fairly good selection. However I'm not a fan of bbq sauce on pizza and it tasted a little too sweet for me! Buffalo chicken - I didn't like this one too much, but it wasnt bad. It was literally the flavoring of buffalo wings in pizza form, so you can determine whether or not you want that. Cheeseburger Pizza - As weird as it sounds, this one is my favorite. Like the buffalo chicken, this is literally a cheeseburger in pizza form. I loved it! The Works (i think this is what its called) - came with sausage and pepperoni and what not. - My 2nd fav! its a classic. Cant go wrong with it. If you can't decide on a choice, pick this. Dessert: Pizookies - These are the bomb. Get the triple chocolate!! You will not be disappointed. The cookie is warm and the ice cream is yummy! Get the gigantic one if you have a large party! You can also split different flavors in one pizookie!!"
H Q.,"Placentia, CA",153,715,1751,2.0,11/21/2013,"+Ugh! Got food poisoning from the Caesar's Salad. Haven't been able to eat in almost two day because of it. +On the bright side, the pizza was good. Food poisoning scale based on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the worst: 7"
Vonnie A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",46,18,1,1.0,11/29/2014,"I should of known things were not going to go well at BJ'S as soon as we waited 5 minutes for a host to even greet us. Well they definitely continued the slow/ poor service. We continued waiting for a waiter once we were seated. I would be understanding if it was busy, but unfortunately it was not. We did finally get our order taken food came out in a reasonable time. Food was bland no refills on beverages and what a surprise no server around. What we did notice the staff standing around talking to each other. Was looking forward to ordering a desert but was over the horrible slow service. We waited for our waitress to come by but she never did after waiting 15 min after our dinner was done I had to get up to locate her for our bill. We will not be back. Where was management on Sat 11/29 around 4pm."
Scott H.,"Blue Jay, CA",106,122,44,2.0,4/5/2015,"Came here last night for dinner.  The only thing good about the place was my beer.  It was tasty, and cold.  The rest of the experience was subpar at best.   Service was incredibly slow, food was pretty awful.  I had a burger, and it was burnt on the outside and pink on the inside.  As I discussed with my wife, our feeling is, since they are right at the beach, they feel that good food and decent service isn't necessary, due to location.  Pretty sad.  Every other BJ's I've been to has been top notch.  I won't be back here."
Mitchell L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",172,3,,3.0,6/17/2015,"The waitress took our drink orders and then completely forgot about us. However, the dessert was what saved this place. The deep dish pizza was good, but the flat bread pizza was fantastic!"
Brittany H.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,1,3.0,8/15/2015,"I was contacted by the manager and he informed me that Shelby was talked to and that they also addressed it in a team meeting. He said that they also recognized the busser for his assistance. Lastly, he invited us in and comped us our meal and the service a million times better, as it had been in the past. Thank you for taking ownership of your staff and their mistake and thank you for making it right! We look forward to coming back in and eating their again!"
Diane V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",780,432,320,5.0,7/22/2013,"This easily could have been a 3 star experience, but throughout the night it just got better and better.  I came to BJ's for the pizookie and was craving deep dish pizza.  This place is pretty small, especially for a BJ's so we were quoted 25 minutes to wait.   Considering it was a Friday night, that was understandable.  But after waiting 40 minutes, my patience was growing thin.  The hosts did apologize for the longer wait.   We were sat at a table and initially an unpleasant server greeted us.  I had a feeling he was having a bad day or just wanted out of there because he was not exactly all smiles and sunshine.  Some minutes later a more cheerful and positive server, later known to us as Matthew, came up to us and said he would be relieving our previous server.  Thanks goodness!  Some positive energy up in here!  Matthew was awesome.  He was prompt, professional, engaging, and best of all, just an overall cool guy to be around.   We ordered BJ's Favorite Deep Dish pizza, which tasted as good as it sounded, and a pitcher of the cider.  Thick crust and goodness with fresh tasting ingredients - and brought out personally by none other than the kitchen manager himself!  I was in pizza heaven!   The cider was a bit weak and did not taste at all like it had alcohol, but it still tasted good.  For dessert, we ordered a pizookie, half chocolate chip and half red velvet. They were generous with the ice cream, and we ended up with more ice cream than cookie!     To top off the night, the general manager asked us how our meal was, and he was very genuine about it.  That, along with the switch in servers and the delicious meal, made this a 5 star experience.  It looks like most people here complain about the service, but we lucked out and got the best server in the house apparently.  Yay us!"
James L.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,3.0,4/6/2016,"I came here this weekend visiting from out of town and I wasn't very pleased.  My pizza was ok, a bit too greasy, but I was really disappointed when it came to the pizookies.  They were promoting the Monkey Bread pizookie and I ordered it, waiting for a delicious dessert.  The waitress came back out and said that they took it off the menu and replaced it with a lemon blueberry one.  I had to go with the chocolate chip and was not very satisfied."
Greg G.,"Vancouver, WA",115,235,65,2.0,4/15/2013,"4/3/13 We came in after an afternoon at the beach for an early dinner.  We ordered two pizzas and some salads and beverages.  The food was very average but we were hungry and wound up finishing most of it.   The real issue here was that a place that is a chain brew pub is not the best place to order pizza but we did so anyway.  So, I guess it was our own fault that it was suboptimal because I have never been to a brewpub that had good pizza.  That is usually reserved for pizzerias or Italian restaurants.  I have eaten at BJs before but stuck with stuff that is universally good at most chains such as burgers, sandwiches and salads.  That's what I will do next time, if there is a next time."
Sandra F.,"Grand Terrace, CA",0,13,1,3.0,2/29/2016,Out for a bike ride stopped in for a burger. Ordered the double deluxe burger ... Was delicious and service was great. Lesley was our server... Thank you Lesley !!!!
Nicholas B.,"Tustin, CA",91,9,1,1.0,3/28/2015,Worst service ever! I waited 45 minutes for my appetizer. They forgot to male my entree...we just left. Our server came to our table 2 times that was it. We were communicating through the bussers. Absolutely crap!
Fernando M.,"Los Alamitos, CA",27,75,18,4.0,9/29/2014,"Good food, good service. Right on the beach, perfect location."
Drew M.,"San Jose, CA",401,401,327,4.0,11/5/2012,"I really like this location!  It's really small, intimate, and BJ's is always a solid spot for good beer selection and great deep dish pizza.   I tried their seasonal Pumpkin Ale, and was really happy with it.  We also got a few bucks off our pizza with a Yelp Check In Deal, so it was pretty awesome.  I love their BBQ Chicken Deep Dish Pizza, and would definitely come back just for this.   I think that for a chain restaurant, you get good bang for your buck here.  And because the location is really small, you get a lot more attention, which is often very nice. 4 Stars."
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1723,1189,1870,4.0,1/15/2013,"Found this place on a Friday night and it's pretty decent. It's smaller than most BJ's locations and doesn't have everything on their menu but it works.  Since it's smaller, the customer service is more focused. Our drinks were constantly refilled and the waitress checked up on us often. I was also surprised that it was crowded on a Friday night which is kinda rare but then again, it's located on Balboa which is ideal for those that want to escape the crowds. We got the BJ's favorite and the spring rolls. I bypassed the beer selection but it's always decent here. The deep dish was great. Hit the spot and I had leftovers for the next day as dinner and it was still good. The spring rolls weren't really my thing. I miss the avocado rolls but sadly, this location doesn't offer them."
A P.,"Orange County, CA",0,30,,2.0,1/5/2016,"Food was good, service was not that great (slow and basically ignored), cute atmosphere, but bathrooms were NASTY....made me wonder what the kitchen looked like??   They were old, dilapidated, and DIRTY.  Kind of made you lose your appetite.  For how nice other locations look, very surprised at the gross tile with mildew stained caulking. It was just nasty....floors as well.  Won't be back anytime soon."
Kajal G.,"San Francisco, CA",141,415,436,3.0,9/12/2013,This has to be the littlest BJs I've ever seen in my life but the pizza was good- kinda expensive but good. We ordered the Mediterranean without chicken. I didn't know BJs made pizza before this.
Travis T.,"San Diego, CA",6,38,2,2.0,5/20/2013,"Like other reviews here the service was not good. It was slow, the server forgot to put our salad orders in, and they had to change out a keg which meant waiting 20 minutes for a beer which should only take an extra 5 minutes if you are slow. Much prefer other BJ's locations.  Oh and since this wasn't the full restaurant they didn't have the full menu, which for me, meant no avocado egg rolls. WTH those things are a-m-a-z-i-n-g. Should be a staple at every BJ's restaurant. Just saying.. The only saving grace was that the pizza still came out great."
Raj G.,"Frisco, TX",0,12,3,1.0,11/28/2014,"Slow service...waited for 30 min and all our food was cold...soup, pizza and kids meals.Avoid."
Shakeel A.,"Anaheim, CA",1,28,1,1.0,5/11/2015,"Went with our family and some friends a total of seven of us on mother' day. Our day was going great till we met the rudest , unpleasant , condescending , ignorant ass of a waiter. This guy was a true ass. We have a daughter with food allergies and tried to explain the allergies to him since we have eaten at our local BJ's several times in Anaheim Hills and have never had an issue , but this ass was as condescending and rude as they come. In the middle of the order he walks away saying that we were taking too long to decide and he is going to take a beak and Will  get some one else to help us who has more time. Then comes back while another much nicer server was taking the rest of the order and says ok I just had to come back in the middle of my break to assist him since I am a nice guy.   We were seated upstairs around 1.30 pm on Sunday the 10 th , did not get his name since he never introduced himself.  Since it was Mother's Day my wife was nice enough to insist that I leave a tip any way , I did leave this guy a generous tip , if not for my wife and it being Mother's Day I would have left him a penny and that would still have been too much for the service we got from this ASS..........LE."
