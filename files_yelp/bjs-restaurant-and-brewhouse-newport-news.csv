Anthony K.,"Yorktown, VA",176,267,131,4.0,11/15/2017,"First BJ's that I liked.  There was a little bit of a wait for dinner, but that was expected.  They were not expected to be busy on Veterans Day.  Burgers are awesome.  Nice beer selection. I got the shrimp/asparagus pasta - Very tasty.  Staff comes by quite often to make sure you are taken care of.  I will be coming back."
Lisa K.,"Carrollton, VA",70,143,126,1.0,12/23/2017,"I really wanted to have a good experience here but I did not. I went for a birthday lunch and it was my first time here. I was not sure what to expect. The menu is pretty big and there's a good variety of food, the ambiance is pretty cool but that's where it stopped. Service was EXTREMELY slow.  It took over 11 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders and over 10 minutes for them to come back.  I got the peachberry tea and it was really good but refills were slow.  The service was slow- not sure if I can stress that enough. I ordered the salad/soup and a friend order a burger.  The server unfortunately messed up my friends order but she ate it anyway.  That was her choice not to tell the server so I can't fault them for not making it right.  The salad was okay- very small but the soup.. the cheddar broccoli soup was just gross.  I couldn't take but a few bites before having it taken away.  It tasted like a lukewarm cheese dip.  It was not good.  At this time we had been there for almost 90 minutes and I needed to get back to work.  If I have bad service and bad food I am quick to say something to management but this was a birthday lunch and I was already running behind. I looked at the reviews after eating there and I wish we had chosen my birthday lunch at a fast food place instead.  We would have saved time and money and I probably would have actually eaten."
Rocco S.,"Newport News, VA",15,38,1,1.0,10/13/2017,"Never again Service slow,food ok,staff unconscious, distracted,no where to be found Food delivered wrong,overcooked, missing componants,oh and overpriced!!!!! Drinks served warm,barely any ice Pull it togther or go out of business!!!!!!!!!!! We were not the only ones,thats not good!!!! Especially in these times when the restaurant business us failing. I guess your next!"
Tammy M.,"Newport News, VA",171,53,25,5.0,1/1/2018,"Today was my second visit here. My forest visit was blessed with delish food in a nice atmosphere. Today my5 nieces and my pop enjoyed the food offerings, while I enjoyed our pleasant server and the great holiday deals!! I had some amazing burger. My nieces had burgers and ribs. Everyone was full and happy. Plus they gave me SPECIAL items cause we spent so much."
Jessica V.,"Portsmouth, VA",52,62,108,4.0,12/24/2017,"Decent place. They don't brew their own beer (at least not that I could tell) but they do have a wide selection of craft beers available. All different varieties, IPAs, pales, blonds, stouts, reds, you name it. The menu looked good, and I almost got the tacos. The chicken bacon piadia was pretty good. Juicy, not as cheesy as I expected, but good flavor. You could taste the bacon. The ranch was good too. The fries were excellent. I ate all of them. This was a 1100+ calorie meal, however, it did keep me full for a hours. They had some good happy hour deals from 3 to 7 which I would go back to check out. I liked the wide open space of the restaurant, and the décor was neat."
Kirstie C.,"Petaluma, CA",45,39,,5.0,12/30/2017,"We just had excellent service and food tonight with our waiter Herman. He was prompt and efficient, our food was hot fresh and delicious! We will be back! We put off BJs for awhile because our California experiences were horrible. This one has BJs as our new favorite spot   The burgers were Devine and flavorful and the tea was refreshing."
Saeron K.,"Newport News, VA",2,5,2,2.0,1/9/2018,"I went there for date night with my hubby and we sat outdoor table and had some steak, pasta and cocktails. The food and drinks were not that bad but a little rat showed up the near our seat and i freaked out. One of customers wrapped up the rat and put it outside of the restaurant. I was really appreciated to the person who took away that rat instead of the waitress."
Dana R.,"Yorktown, VA",8,73,48,1.0,7/29/2017,"I've visited this BJ's location multiple times, mostly when people are in town and because my husband works so close. This was by far the worst experience we have had at any restaurant in a very long time. First off, our waitress would disappear for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. She was awful. Every time we have visited with our kids, they have been given a kids plate with fruit and a piece of bread. Today they were not. Other kids in the restaurant were, so when our waitress comes by with our food, we asked for a side of fruit, which we were then charged for. When we approached her about it, she said that it was supposed to cost that amount, but she would have it removed 'as a favor'.  I ordered the BJ's Brewhouse Burger, which comes on a Parmesan crusted bun. This thing was an absolute salt bomb. I couldn't finish it even after I removed the bun. My French fries were cold and stuck together. Very bland. My daughter ordered the mini corn dogs and they came to us completely burnt. We actually got a rock hard shell of a corn dog with an equally rock hard hot dog on the outside (photo will be posted). We sat and waited for over 15 minutes to ask our waitress for replacement meals and just gave up.  Absolutely will not be returning. For the amount of money that you pay for a plate here, you should be receiving better quality food, and you should receive great service no matter where you go. It wasn't even busy!"
Pete A.,"Norfolk, VA",11,107,120,3.0,5/20/2017,It's ok at best.. Service is slow buy very polite.. Good place to watch sporting events.. Had the ahi salad.  It was good.  Nice appeal very vibrant and energetic.
Lance H.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,7,4,3.0,1/6/2018,"This is our first trip to BJ's. When sat down and looked at the menu, we were pretty excited. It's nice to have a menu where there is so much too choose from you can't pick. That however also has a downside. I ordered the made in house chips and guacamole. When it got to the table it had already started to turn colours on top. My fish tacos came out hard like they had been sitting under a heat lamp. My wife's burger was supposed to be no onion and came out with onion on it. The manager Mark was very nice and addressed the issues with a professional and friendly demeanour."
Justin H.,"Fort Eustis, Fort Eustis, VA",0,3,,5.0,12/27/2017,took my family there to eat and their pizza is by far the best around. it's really thick and has a great flavor. Also the brews are on point nothing like a cold beer and pizza
Adam B.,"Newport News, VA",375,419,20,4.0,7/7/2017,"We sat at a bar table and had to wait about five minutes for menus, which didn't thrill us. But in fairness, they appeared to be a little bit understaffed. I tried four of their beers and I particularly liked their IPA and pale ale. I always get uneasy with chain restaurants that make their own beer, but theirs was pretty good. I had the California chicken club sandwich with grilled chicken, smoked bacon, avocado, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and roasted garlic aioli on grilled sourdough bread. With some fries, this was a really good and well balanced sandwich.  Onto dessert. I admit I really wanted the monkey bread pizookie. But on mom's recommendation, we had the beignet dessert. It was pastry dough baked topped with cinnamon sugar, vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberries, strawberry purée, and whipped cream. It was really good, but it was the kind of dessert where you just tap out on sugar for another week. Being that I'm moving here from Chicago, I may have to see how their deep dish pizza really is..."
Cathrine C.,"Newport News, VA",389,343,506,5.0,5/8/2017,"My husband and I went on a double date with some friends for dinner and we had a great time! There was a little bit of a wait, supposedly 30min, but we probably only waited about 15min. Meanwhile, we played some cornhole which was right outside the restaurant: girls vs boys, of course. After we were seated our waiter took our drink and appetizer orders right away. We got our drinks and our appetizers shortly after and they were delicious. I had a Pink Cadillac that came in a martini glass and it tasted like a pink starbust, no joke. Super delish. For appetizers we ordered the calamari and mozzarella sticks, equally as delicious and cooked perfectly. Enough to share between us 4. My husband and I also ordered a Caesar side salad which was pretty decent. The croutons were crunchy and not stale at all. Also not drowning in dressing. For our meals I got the salmon over couscous which also had a mushroom and tomato sauce. It had a taste different from what I normally order, but was surprisingly really good. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the couscous had a lemony taste that balanced out my palette. My husband ordered the shrimp and asparagus penne and he loved it. We were stuffed so we had to take some leftovers home. Lemme tell ya, even after 2 days, my salmon was still good. For dessert, we all shared the pizookie sample trio. Pretty much got all different kinds but my favorite will ALWAYS be the classic chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream. Seriously a must whenever you go to BJs. Credit and appreciation to our server who was always so attentive during the entire course of our meal and had perfect timing for everything. As we ordered our entrees I also ordered the dessert and he knew just when to place the order. Some of the items on the menu can get pretty pricey, but overall it's decent and worth the price. I really love the ambiance of this place. It's a wide open restaurant with a nice bar on one side and high ceilings. The lighting is a little darker, but I didn't mind it. Makes for a great date night and isn't too loud. I like sitting in their booths because they're pretty tall, which makes the meal a little more intimate.  One last thing, please just get a pizookie. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out!"
Parth P.,"Washington, NJ",0,20,5,3.0,9/26/2017,"My girlfriend and ordered the appitizer platter along with a pizookies trio! We got the Chocolate Chunk, Monkey Bread & Salted Caramel! All three were really good but our all time favorite is always the Chocolate Chunk! The appetizers were also good especially the spinach artichoke dip and the avocado egg rolls!"
Sunny L.,"Yorktown, VA",0,27,16,3.0,10/22/2017,"Food was excellent and had a nice beer selection. We had a group of 7 people at the bar side and the wait staff seemed overwhelmed when we all sat down. She wouldn't take everybody's order, even though she saw our glasses empty. We had to stop her to place an order. She would take orders from only a few people and walked off and didn't come back for awhile. We got there around 6pm on Saturday and we were not able to place an order of our dinner till past 7pm., because she kept on disappearing."
Jhannae L.,"Mount Hope, KS",45,2,,1.0,12/17/2017,The absolute worst experience I ever had at this restaurant when I walked in it was halfway empty the host took her time to come to the host station and I had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. For the time I sat there waiting the host had her back to us turning around laughing  and then when I finally sat down I wanted to order the holiday special and they  told me that they didn't have any steaks they were all out and didn't even offer me anything else to please me
steve k.,"Newport News, VA",37,133,,4.0,8/23/2017,"I have heard a great deal about BJ's so a friend and I had dinner. Our service was fine, the meal was fine, but nothing else really stands out. The price was reasonable albeit not inexpensive, our server was good, competent, a bit ""stiff"" but I would rather have that than ""over the top"" enthusiastic. While I had ""adult beverages"" with dinner I did not see an unusually large selection including their own brews. The only complaint I had was a long time to be waited on once seated, but that is not a surprise anywhere these days. Overall, I would call this a dependable, straight forward stop on the dining tour, and there is nothing wrong with that."
Sherry C.,"Newport News, VA",1,4,3,2.0,9/29/2017,This was my first time here. We ordered the avocado rolls as an appetizer it came two minutes before the main course. We order jalapeño cucumber margarita that was suppose to have 1800 silver tequila (none) however it tasted like a lemonade no jalapeño were in the drink. Waitress took it back and bartender put some canned jalapeños in the drink but it was advertised to be serve with fresh ones. Had to order two shots of tequila to add to the drinks.  The only highlight was our waitress and manager who were very accommodating and apologetic. Unsure if we will return. We paid our full tab but received gift cards since the manager was notified about the experience.
Bruce J.,"Yorktown, VA",2,17,,4.0,8/26/2017,"Pretty good jambalaya! Very tasty and full of meat. A bit spicy. I enjoyed the tart lemonade as well, despite the very large selection of adult beverages.  Some kids though."
Laure J.,"Newport News, VA",294,112,206,3.0,2/7/2017,"I think if you really like beer, this is a great place to go. If you do not like beer, this is not a great place to go. The interior is very cool looking, industrial, high ceilings- its hip & its very spacious. I ordered spinach dip, it lacked flavor and texture, like if you put it on the chip and held it slanted the dip would slide off. that's not poppin. The waitress bugged me about getting a drink so finally I said, okay maybe I could go for something with tequila and she said ""Um, how about  a margarita?"" Girl -_- if you're going to push a drink on me at least have some menu knowledge and suggest something specific to your restaurant. But i still got the margarita,hahaha. the drink was weak and tasted pre-made, very thick like it was mostly mix & a dash of tequila. wtvr, I'll take the blame. The menu is weird to me, maybe I should have ordered pizza but I went with the baked ziti & it was decent. I didn't care for the meatballs but i liked that it had a nice crust of cheese on top & the mix of alfredo with marinara.  I probably won't go back unless someone fills me in on a happy hour deal."
Noriko M.,"Huntsville, AL",15,7,,4.0,9/1/2017,"Many choices of beer and other drinks!!!we stayed there for LONG TIME for our ""girls night out""  The staff were kind! The food was good!"
Alycia R.,"Newport News, VA",37,11,,4.0,11/24/2017,"Wasn't expecting much from all the negative reviews, however this place is pretty good! Better than Park Lane and a lot cheaper. We got the garlic knots as an appetizer, and they were delicious. Soft, garlicky,  and crispy on the bottom. The marinara with it was really good as well. I order the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos, absolutely delicious. The side with it was okay but the tacos definitely made up for it. I don't even like cucumbers and I thought they were good. We also got the chicken Alfredo deep dish pizza, and that was good. Very pillowy and soft, however I wouldn't call it deep dish. It also had like no sauce on it, so I feel like it was a little overpriced. We also didn't get any silverware or napkins. But other than that, our experience was very good. Will come back again."
Juan R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3,50,6,5.0,10/15/2017,"It is a great restaurant. The food and the atmosphere are great, and the customer service by the service is very polite. I enjoy eating the spaghetti with meatballs, and I like the fact that the music it's not too loud and there's no need to be yelling at whoever is enjoying a delicious meal with you. It is also nice to have TVs all over so you can watch whatever sports they have on. There also located in a very nice Area which makes them even better."
William M.,"Newport News, VA",22,48,77,3.0,6/14/2017,"I love to try new things and have new experiences so when I heard they built a BJ's brewhouse near me I couldn't wait to try there food and beer. When I got there the ambience had a classy yet causal feel.   I was seated promptly and the waitress was very nice in giving suggestions on there house brewed beer menu. I choose the Jerimah red ale which is now my one of my favorite beers. The jambalaya here is pretty good as well. All and all it was a pleasurable experience. So why the 3 stars you ask? Well... since you asked, this restaurant felt like Cheesecake Factory but instead of selling cheesecake they sell beer. Now don't get me wrong Cheesecake Factory is a great place to eat but in this restaurant I was looking forward to a more unique experience. Other then that BJ's is a fine choice for dinner and a beer."
Bri A.,"Hampton, VA",204,4,3,5.0,8/6/2017,My favorite restaurant.  Never leave here with a empty stomach. I'm never disappointed when I come here.
Tamekia F.,"Chesapeake, VA",106,64,207,4.0,10/19/2016,"Went here late Sunday night for the  football game. There wasn't much of a crowd. I decided to try the California club flatbread. SUCH a good choice. It was great. The flatbread was crunchy, but not burnt. The toppings were nicely sized and they didn't skimp on any of the ingredients. There was some sort of sauce drizzled over it that was really good. It's also a nice size. I could only eat half off it. Yay for leftovers! This was my second time coming here and I would absolutely return."
Jenn P.,"Alexandria, VA",44,7,1,3.0,9/23/2017,"Amazing food but really slow service.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what but there was hardly anyone there and it still took forever,"
Russell S.,"St. Marys, GA",0,4,,2.0,10/1/2017,Went there tonight and had Pizza.  When it came out it was like warm.  The rest of the food was average.  In my opinion for what we got and quality of food it was to pricey.
Anna L.,"Newport News, VA",0,4,,5.0,12/12/2017,"OMG!  I am in love with this place!!!  The food is so unique and fresh.  I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants but was super impressed with the menu.  The beers on tap are almost overwhelming.  I'm usually a wine drinker, but tasted a few beers.  Pretty impressive.  My mother in law and I loved the place so much she wanted the family to make reservations for her birthday."
Brian R.,"Hampton, VA",47,7,,3.0,10/10/2017,"Let me preface this by saying they have quite good food. However, I've been here 4 times total. In each circumstance they took an extraordinary amount of time to seat us. Even when the restaurant was more than half empty we had to wait 25 minutes. On my first trip when it first opened I was told 45 minutes. Decided to wait then kept being told 15 more minutes for a total of 2 hours until my family and I just gave up. Service is nothing spectacular. My last trip I got the Jambilliyah hoping for something spicy. As a person that is sensitive to spicy foods the spices used in that dish rate a 1/10 on the spiciness scale. Fairly disappointed in that. Going to give it one last shot before I give up on them."
Richelle P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,1,,1.0,9/26/2017,"Was here last Sunday and service is awful and slow. Then ordered jambalaya and it was so salty that I had to re-order again (glad the waitress didn't charge me for that nasty jambalaya). So I re-ordered thyme chicken, it was ok didn't even finish it, didn't have any appetite.  The calamari actually tasted good but that was it. The brownie with ice cream on top was just too sweet for me. The price is a bit pricey for the place and the food they serve. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL.  Keep your money and go somewhere else!! So when I got home, I got so sick that I puked everything I ate from this place. Food poisoning obviously. Didn't eat anything else prior to eating at this place. SO DISAPPOINTING AND WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. SAVE YOURSELF!!!! Not even worth 1 star for this place at all!!"
Alicia B.,"Memphis, TN",27,3,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Let me just say, this is a first time I've ever done a bad review on anyone!  We came on a Saturday night. Your busy I get it. But when you finally get seated after an hour long wait for that, wait another 15 to literally track down a server. Then get no ""apology, thank you for waiting, sorry bout your wait,""  you're a bit put off. We ordered a deep dish pizza. Not crazy orders. Our food came in a reasonable time but for being ""made to order"" it was luke warm my 6 year old could dig in. We finished. Then had to ask for our check. Whole process was just rediculous. Worst tip we've ever given a waitress, whom by the way spent a much greater amount of time with the two young men down the way  Save your time and money and go elsewhere."
Megan S.,"Paducah, KY",37,3,1,5.0,5/12/2017,"Yum yum yum! Waitress was lovely, got seated right away on a Friday night. Ordered the fried mahi mahi tacos and husband got brisket burger. Both were delicious and well prepared. For dessert we of course got the trio and man oh man was it good!!!"
Kelsey A.,"Fredericksburg, VA",134,3,,3.0,9/2/2017,"Walked in to a half empty restaurant and was told it was a 15 minute wait. Two couples came in and both were sat, while my party of 3 waited. It was obvious the hostess forgot about us when she looked over and whispered to her fellow host, acting like she made a mistake. Sat at the bar; decent service and good food. Other than poor customer service from the hostesses, the evening went well."
Emily U.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,2,,4.0,9/1/2017,"Food was delicious! Excellent service! Salted caramel Pizooki was one of the best deserts I've ever had. I'm not a big drinker but they do have a large selection of you like to drink, and you get free samples to try it before you order!"
Mary W.,"Newport News, VA",0,16,7,2.0,9/1/2016,"We wanted to try this place for the first time. Well, the 2 stars are for our waitress because she was very informative regarding the menu and our food came out quickly.. However it was early evening.. The food is equivalent to pizzeria uno, Friday's and chili's.. The menu was overpriced $$$ for the quality of the food. This is the ultimate Long Island ice tea!! Too much sour mix in it.. I've definitely  had better!!! Needless to say we won't be back!"
David D.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,16,,4.0,8/25/2017,"Have been several times, everything I've  eaten is really  good!!! Service is great, especially Sierra! Will be back many more times!"
David H.,"Hampton, VA",167,142,927,4.0,8/19/2015,"I am really impressed with this new restaurant/brewhouse in the Oyster Point area of Newport News. It is always a welcomed site to get a new place in my area and BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse has just been added to my regular listings. Located in the ever so changing Oyster Point Area BJ's is one of the first businesses to open this area with PF Chang, Whole Foods and Zoe's Kitchen to name a few that I am starting to see come together.  When you first enter you are welcomed by a warm and inviting staff. There is a full bar to the right that is large and plenty of area to hang out and have some fun in. The atmosphere is open and fun filled with seating well-spaced so that you are not bumping into others, but at the same time you don't feel like the space is wasted as well. The art work and décor of this place is also very refreshing and a little hip at the same time without really going overboard.   I had the deep dish ravioli which was just perfect. Served in a deep dish pan with huge cheese filled ravioli and covered in meat sauce and cheese galore.  I could not finish my meal and had to take the rest home for lunch the next day.  My wife had the fish and chips and she loved the fact that they used shoe-string fries and the portions of fish was just perfect for her as well. The tartar sauce had a wonderful spice that was welcomed change as well. My daughter had the small sweet pig deep dish pizza, but they messed up her order and sent the mini instead. They figured it out while it was baking and notified us that they would still bring out the small which ended up getting packed to go as well.  Everything was well prepared and well-presented and be back many more times to try other things on the menu. I also enjoyed, but didn't partake of the in house brews and will try some next visit. BJ's also offers a very inviting Happy Hour as well along with some Late Night Snack items as well.  If I had to say anything negative was that our server seemed to disappear after bringing our check for a while and didn't give the correct change was going to be part of her tip. Not a show stopper, but it was busy and she was very pleasant so that was just small stuff."
William Duane C.,"Hampton, VA",39,13,159,4.0,1/15/2017,"BBQ Bison Burger was excellent. Wife loved her Turkey Burger. Our friends had seared Ahi salad and fish and chips. Both were well liked. It's a bit of a drive for us and we don't eat out much but this will definitely be on our ""return"" list."
M P.,"Hampton, VA",169,8,1,5.0,6/4/2017,This place was amazing! Great menu selections. I was a first timer and felt welcomed. Enjoyed convo with staff and very friendly. I got the deep dish pizza and jambalaya. I will definitely be back. Prices were a bit steep on some stuff. Great atmosphere as well.
