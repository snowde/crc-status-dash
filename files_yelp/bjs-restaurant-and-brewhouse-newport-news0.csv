Maria D.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/21/2015,"I have been to BJs in a lot of places, a lot of states and usually enjoy good service. But Newport News, VA was an exception - never have I had such terrible service (from the hostesses - we gave up before being seated). We were told 45 - 55 minutes wait, then 20 minutes more, then there were suddenly 3 more parties ahead of us, so it would be 2-1/2 hours. With 2 small children, waiting indefinitely while the hostesses kept inexplicably extending the time did not work for us.  This restaurant could give all BJs a bad name - if I had never been to one before, I never would go to one after this experience."
Joni F.,"Newport News, VA",0,15,,5.0,11/7/2015,So good. The pooozookie should be against the law. Would go back here any day. Love that you can order from the app for dine in and also pay on there.
Wayne M.,"Newport News, VA",5,22,8,4.0,10/27/2015,"Fantastic service and food when we visited.  Our waiter was amazing, and full of personality.  The only problem, was the music was so blaring loud we couldn't hear each other!"
William J.,"Newport News, VA",0,10,,5.0,10/21/2015,"I had the pepperoni deep dish pizza and if I could I would give 10 stars. Though I know pizza preference depends broadly on the person. The crust is thick, yet light, airy, and fluffy. The pepperoni bold and tinged with Just the right amount of spice/kick. I love the fact that they don't swamp their crust with sauce like so many other pizza places. You can really taste all of the seasonings. I did pick up so not sure how dining in is though I've heard several complaints from others regarding customer service and wait times."
Sierra P.,"Hampton, VA",162,10,6,4.0,10/19/2015,My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday night and the wait time was not bad at all. We decided to go to the bar and get a couple beers while we waited on our table. The bar staff was quick and friendly. We had the buffalo wings for starters and they were pretty good. The BJs Favorite deep dish pizza was our entree and it was really tasty! No complaints here!
William T.,"Poquoson, VA",0,27,,3.0,5/23/2016,Went for first time Sunday.  Staff was very friendly and helpful - needed assist so my wife could get in without a long walk.  Thought the food was good.  Concern is about handling orders in the kitchen.  My wife's meal came a good 15 minutes before mine.  She has soup and salad - I just had a sandwich (which did require the roll be toasted).  We were told that since hers was quicker to prepare it just came up faster.  Why not just wait until the sandwich is ready to put the soup in the bread bowl?  Simple kitchen management.  Not anything the server could control.  Will still try them again
Scott H.,"Williamsburg, VA",60,3,,1.0,9/22/2015,"The service was horrible. We called for reservations at 6:30. When we got there we were told our table would be ready in a couple of minutes. After 15 minutes we asked again and were told they don't take reservations, only call ahead seating, and it would be 30-40 minutes. We complained to a manager that we were never told that and he kept saying he would have a table ready for us in a few minutes......we didn't get seated until 7:45. 90 minutes after we arrived. While the manager did buy us 5 appetizers, it didn't make up for the horrible service. The food was good but I would not recommend going here. They should have stayed closed longer and trained their staff."
Laura L.,"Carrollton, VA",1,3,,2.0,9/11/2015,"We went on a weekday with a rather large group (10) so we arrived at 11 to try and be before the lunch crowd.   We had at least 5 different waitstaff members try and help our table (including a manager) and apparently none of them could remember what anyone had ordered.  After repeatedly saying what our orders were, some at our table still waited for upwards of an hour and a half for a SALAD!  It took 2.5 hrs for all of us to get our lunch and bills sorted out.  We asked for our checks early because we had seen how long it took to get our food and still took 30 Mins for bills to be brought to us.   Then when one person was charged for something she shouldn't have been, the waitress told her it would take at least 20 mins longer for a corrected bill.  The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either and definitely not worth that kind of wait time!"
Leah S.,"Hampton, VA",0,4,1,2.0,8/30/2015,"Service is so so very slow. I told our waitress we hadn't eaten all day and she still took 10 minutes to bring my drink. I even asked for a water in the meantime and it took even longer for that. Doubt the food will come any time, we'll see how long that takes"
Mike E.,"Memphis, TN",27,5,,1.0,8/22/2015,"Went there last night. The waitress Lucinda lied about why they didn't have 2 of their beers on tap. Also, she told us they ran out of cheese so they could not make any pizzas. Yet throughout the night our group kept seeing pizzas go by. Final straw was the waitress brought my wife the wrong order which contained gluten items in it when it was supposed to be gluten free. It's going to be a long time before we go back, if ever."
Lauren M.,"Williamsburg, VA",118,4,8,1.0,1/16/2016,"Customer service was the worst!! We were initially greeted and seated by less than enthusiastic hostesses.  My family and I proceeded to sit at our table for over 10 minutes without being greeted.  We had numerous servers walk past us to include one who brought drinks to the table right next to ours... And still not even a ""someone will be with you shortly"" We finally decided to leave the establishment.  Upon walking out, I proceeded to tell the hostesses, who seemed less than concerned. They didn't even have the common sense to get a manager... I had to ask for one.  One of the hostesses even started talking trash under her breath as I waited.  The Manager said he would ""wait on us himself"" no thanks buddy. We went next door to PF Changs where the service was fantastic and we didn't feel like we were an ""inconvenience"" to the employees who worked there.  I will never eat there nor would I recommend it to anyone..."
Tiffany J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",15,56,8,5.0,11/11/2015,"Went for lunch on a holiday and they were awesome despite being packed. The beer was good, the food was fresh (we had a table of 4 and all ordered an app and 2 lunches) impressed with it all!"
Jesse C.,"Newport News, VA",75,217,19,2.0,8/25/2015,"I came here during a promotion that allowed my family to eat for free. We donated money to the cystic fibrosis foundation for what the meal would of cost us. Overall the service was  good. I really liked the hand crafted root beer and orange soda. The food was all very greasy. Yeah, I know.. it's a brewhouse.. however I can typically eat greasy food without having a GI attack. The food seemed very trendy? Think typical pubfare with buzzwords like: no high fructose corn syrup, sriracha, and ""healthy"" spins on stuff. I am confused by what audience BJ is trying to target? It seems almost red robinish but expensive? So if you have a growing family, it may not be the best for your budget? However they have healthier (use this phrase with a grain of salt) pubfare that kids may enjoy... keyword may! BJ's has a very extensive list of beers, however they use their own brand the most. While it was good per my craft beer enthusiast husband... I think he would rather be reaching for stone. I think that they put a lot more effort into their own beer and marketing that than having other craft beers available. That was kind of a disappointment to me. I find BJ's to be pretentious and to be a jack of all trades, master of none."
Tevin H.,"Newport News, VA",1,4,,2.0,1/9/2016,"Okay I wasn't big on this place from word of mouth and they really didn't prove the nay Sayers wrong. I walked in and I had to wait about 5-7 minutes before being seen. I got my table ordered my food which was of course a burger. Sad to say they didn't get my order correct (Guacamole deluxe- turned out to be a double deluxe? No guacamole or extras) the burger had great flavor and was cooked to my standard but it wasn't what I ordered. They offered me to remake the burger I wanted but I had already waited long enough plus my date would have finished her meal before I had gotten mines if I did. The napkins smelled greasy (cloth) I also ordered their mini cookie dessert trio. That was beyond expectations. The service sucked all the way I always tip no matter what though. But 2 stars out of a possible 4 cause of the service, the attentiveness, and the pride of the restaurant. If there's nothing open at the time and this is left might as well take your chances."
kaye h.,"Newport News, VA",21,31,1,2.0,9/10/2015,"The food is really good. The pizza is very tasty and the crust is light as air. I enjoyed it very much. The lunchtime staff is made up of really inexperienced servers. Today was my second visit and I was and remain summarily UNIMPRESSED. They are extremely awkward and if I'm being honest, it's like they're doing community service. Their attitudes are marginal, they are not the least bit excited about having a job at all. Our server was a lovely young girl, but we had the feeling that she just didn't care for her job. She took our drink order, bought them promptly and then disappeared into the kitchen. She bought my salad and then disappeared into the kitchen. After I finished my salad and my mother was still waiting on her order, she had disappeared into the kitchen. At that point, my curiosity about this ""kitchen"" was piqued. Was there some sort of black hole or other dimension there that food and wait staff disappeared into? My question was answered as we were driving away. There was a cadre of wait staff standing on the side of the building smoking. I think that's where the ""black hole"" of the kitchen spits them out into...#notimpressed"
Ilene D.,"Newport News, VA",0,28,,2.0,1/29/2016,"Maybe it is because we went on a very busy night, or that we were seated as far from the kitchen as possible, or that we were seated next to a command station and everyone had to gather there to input their orders, or that because the restaurant was so busy the kitchen was in too much of a rush to make the food well, or because it is just not that great a place.  When we did have a complaint about the food, it was impossible for anyone to find a manager. We went, we ate, we will not be back.  It is just not worth the visit."
Jeff K.,"Crestview, FL",0,8,6,4.0,1/22/2016,Came here for lunch and had the Double Deluxe with a Nutty Brewnette.  Both were excellent.  Brews on lunch special and the burger was huge.  Top it off with great service from Olivia and a military discount!  Great spot for lunch.
Amanda E.,"Warrenton, VA",1,18,,2.0,12/20/2015,"The first time at this new location was less than ideal.  We ordered the appetizer sampler, and the frozen Costco brand foods tasted better than what we received.  The saving grace was the alcoholic drinks, which were made very well.  The second time here was a little better food wise, but when we received the appetizer we did not have any eating utensils, which we asked for when we got the food, and we were finished eating it when they actually bought the utensils.  We were not going to eat it cold.  The burgers were pretty good, but ordinary."
Cindy M.,"Yorktown, VA",0,20,,2.0,12/8/2015,"I really want to like this place because the food is good...but the service is not so great.  I even did a survey and didn't get a single response.  Prices are also so high for the portion size you receive...pasta for $15 with  no salad included...Olive Garden is a better deal than that!  Not sure where the problem lies-kitchen issue, training, too many tables for servers, etc. but they'd better step it up a notch or it won't last around here.  Word is getting around they have bad service!  I've tried to defend them but after my last visit I just can't do it anymore."
Oye D.,"Newport News, VA",1,7,,2.0,11/23/2015,"First  all let me say that this business moves extremely slow. I made a reservation so that me and my parties would not be waiting forever. The person on the phone said it would be an hour  wait. So an hour later we came to the restaurant and they said it will be an hour wait. We told the front desk person that we called and made a reservation how would this be an hour wait? She looked at us and try to explain why, but sh didn't really care in my opinion that we were inconvenienced. After complaining, we didn't have to wait an hour but, it is ridiculous to make a reservation if it's not going to be a uphold.  This is my second time coming to this place, the  food is pretty good however if there was a grade below an F on how fast the food came to our table it would get that grade. I think this place needs to work on customer service, and speed. These two things are important in a restaurant."
