Mark A.,"Beckley, WV",0,17,,2.0,5/29/2016,"went in when they first opened. the wait staff is terrible, food was OK, but over priced. Went again with friends a few months later......the staff is still terrible....I dont think they really want to do their job. Seems their phones are more important than the customer."
Raven T.,"Hampton, VA",125,1,,2.0,3/30/2017,"Ive been here 3 times and every time i fo it  gets worse. Tonight was to worst experience ive had at a restaurant. As a server i understand that you go through somethings and some customers are harder to deal with BUT regardless there is never a situation where you can say ""I DONT GIVE A FUCK"" in front of your customers. From the beginning of the night it was bad. We were supposed to have a reservation...nope.Lucky they weren't busy at all so after they got that straight we waited for an hour and 15 at least before we even got out appetizers and drinks. After that we got cold food and drinks that were incorrect multiple times. One us even had to get up and get ketchup from someone else. Order water and never got that. So many things wrong. Just not please,and clearly its not justva onetime thing because every time I go its bad. I got there at 630 and didnt leave till 930 and it wasnt because I was having such a great time i wanted to stay."
Michael D.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,14,2,5.0,9/29/2016,"Wife and I ate here last night, absolutely delicious. Had the brisket bacon burger, one of the best burgers I've had in a while"
Danielle M.,"Smithfield, VA",8,107,14,4.0,6/3/2016,"Had a late lunch/early dinner here yesterday and our server was anazing! I wish I could remember is name, but he was very attentive and was more than helpful with suggestions on entrees, way better experience this time around. The ahi tuna salad was delicious, and the siracha Brussels sprouts are a must have."
Amy R.,"Newport News, VA",55,12,,2.0,9/23/2016,"Too much spice, even in things that don't typically have any.  Not willing to adjust or have options not to have the added heat, either.  The ""check back"" occurred the moment the dishes were set down and the waitress - when tracked down - said she would bring sour cream and then forgot.  Which might have been understandable except she talked me into another drink and then forgot that as well, delivering it as we were waiting to get our check.  It is cuisine designed by a wing chef: ""What if we had a diverse menu, but just spiced it all like wings and eliminated options?""  If the food was seasoned normally, it would have been decent - it looked well prepared except that everything had to be spicy for some reason - the breaded fish was spicy hot, coleslaw was spicy hot, pasta was spicy hot.  There was no rhyme or reason to any of it - just pour heat onto everything.  (The coleslaw!)"
Jennifer W.,"Yorktown, VA",107,25,13,3.0,9/8/2015,"I've been here twice since it opened: once at lunchtime on a weekday and once for dinner on a weekend. The food I've had so far is delicious and there is a large drink menu to satisfy every craving. So I have no qualms with the food or drink.  The problem with this place is that no matter the quality of food, it cannot compensate for the lack of good service. The second time was quite a bit better than the first, however: don't open a restaurant and expect the servers and kitchen staff to just ""work it out"" as they go. Have training days ahead of opening so that they are prepared when the general public comes in. Poor planning, in my opinion. Overall: Yummy food and drinks at a slightly higher price than most bar joints with mediocre service and lack of smiling faces = 3 stars."
Monika P.,"Boston, MA",15,11,,3.0,10/14/2015,"5-21-16 We returned for dinner, because I had a $25 gift card I didn't want to waste. I put us on the wait list hours ahead, so we didn't have to wait forever, but we still waited. The waitress was very nice. She took our drink and appetizer order promptly. Our food order came after, we waited longer than I would have expected for a pizza and a salad. When the pizza did finally arrived... it was missing the sauce! I realized it after we got home with the leftovers. I ate my salad, it was good, but not great. And the pizza, well it's still sitting in the fridge, and will probably be in the garbage next. Waste of money. Sorry, but this place just can't keep it together. 10-14-16 We arrived 30 minutes after making ""preferred seating"" reservation. When we got to the front, we were told that there was a 45 minute wait. WTF! We waited for over an hour. There were plenty of empty tables around us when we were finally seated. Waited 10 more minutes for a waitress to show up. Water and a beer showed up pretty fast. The appetizer took much longer. And the main courses were quick to follow. Not properly spaced timing. The waitress never came back to check on us. Food was mediocre. Nothing special. We took a dessert to go. When we got home, the pizzookie was the wrong flavor from what we ordered and there was a nice long hair in the ice cream."
Teri H.,"Yorktown, VA",68,2,,1.0,10/23/2015,"Atmosphere is great Service is not great Food is unreasonably slow Chip/dip appetizer took 45 minutes We have been here multiple times- still disorganized  Last time we ordered a pizza, the toppings came on the side - cold.  So strange  They just can't seem to get it together  Hamburger is good, just don't come if you don't plan on being here for hours Also, you can put your name on the list ahead of time via an app.  You can still expect to wait over a 1/2 hr."
Robin H.,"Fort Monroe, VA",15,1,,1.0,9/6/2015,"The service here needs some serious adjusting. The first time we visited, I sent my salad back twice. The kitchen forgot the Kale (main ingredient), the roasted Brussel sprouts and the goat cheese. The second time they forgot the brussel sprouts. Our second visit, from the time we sat down until we left it was 1 hour and 40 minutes. Our glasses were only refilled one time and we had to take the check to someone else to have it rung up. I ordered from the dinner menu; however, I recieved the lunch portion. I requested that the item be adjested in which it was.  Had I not remembered reading the menu and requesting a copy of it to check the ingredients on BOTH occasions, I would have been cheated on what I ordered. We gave them two chances and the service is clearly an issue. Another table made a comment that they were running late and really needed their check because they had been there long enough. And yet, another table waited at least 25 minutes to receive a beverage. They were still waiting on their check when we left with very UNHAPPY faces! If you do not mind poor and very slow service, the food is very good; however, a large part of the dining experience is the service!"
Conor C.,"Hampton, VA",15,4,1,5.0,10/3/2015,"We were planning to go to PF Chang's, but it was a 2 hour wait. So we decided to give this place a try. The host told us it would be a 30 minute wait and we would be texted when the table was ready. The wait only lasted maybe 15 minutes. We were seated and served immediately. So the service was great!  The food was also amazing! The avocado egg rolls were great and creamy! I had the clam chowder which was also good. The Hawaiian Mahi was great! The pineapple fried had lots of pineapple in it and was cooked perfectly. We each had a hand-crafted cream soda. I had the orange creme soda and it was amazing! For dessert we got the peanut butter s'mores! It was out of this world! The marshmallow topping was perfectly burnt and the chocolate bottom was nice and warm.  This was a great experience and we will definitely be coming back! They do a great job handling a busy Friday night crowd and provide some great unique items!"
Sita C.,"Newport News, VA",0,10,2,1.0,1/7/2017,"Tried this place for the first time a year ago when they 1st opened. 1st experience was poor-- waitress took too long to come back to table for refills etc. and food was just okay. 2nd time here was just recently a week ago - same scenario. Service isn't fantastic and food taste like frozen food warmed up (got the chicken Alfredo pasta) place is overpriced for no reason, I don't see how they are still in business or why people choose to come here. If you are looking for a late night place to get drinks there is a Friday's and Buffalo Wild Wings down the street that would be much better in my opinion."
Catherine H.,"Burlington, Canada",42,42,5,4.0,8/15/2015,"Halleluyah!  I think I may have just found my new after-work happy hour location! Newport News - lacking in a huge selection of decent eateries - definitely needed this chain.  Yes, Bjs Brewery may be a chain, but for a ""soft"" opening, they definitely hit the mark with their food and drink selections. First, the soft opening is a fantastic idea! (Explained in a previous review so I won't bore you with the details).  However, tables were offered either a starter or a dessert to share and we were lucky enough to get the dessert - the Salted Caramel Pizookie.  Think freshly baked (huge) salted caramel cookie topped with mini chocolate chips and vanilla ice cream - three of us couldn't even finish the whole thing but it was delightful!  Yes, it was that good I had to talk about it first :) We shared the balsamic chicken with mashed potatoes and crispy fried onion rings - and French's fried onions have nothing on these freshly cut, fried rings of the sweetest onions I've ever tasted.  The perfect crunchy topping to the soft mashed potatoes.  The chicken was juicy and tender with a balsamic sauce that was perfect.  Next we shared the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flat-bread.  I didn't actually realise that it came drizzled in pesto sauce, and I'm a pesto kind of girl, making this thinly crusted flat-bread one of my favourites! We also opted for the roast beef sandwich au jus.  I can't say that roast beef is one of my favourite things to eat, but this sandwich definitely converted me! Also, the idea of dunking my perfectly good sandwich into a pot of beef stock didn't really appeal to me, but despite the messiness, as The Monkees would say...I'm a believer!  This was accompanied by thin, fresh cut chips (aka fries) which is a rarity in today's frozen chip world! 10 out of 10 for the chips, BJs! Happy hour is from 3-6pm with pretty good beer prices and even half price wines on Tuesdays.  So, not really being a beer drinker, you know where you will find me after work on a Tuesday!"
Alida D.,"Yorktown, VA",0,6,,1.0,8/2/2017,"GOING DOWNHILL FAST.  Decided to go to BJs on my birthday for dinner. We have always enjoyed the menu. The restaurant was half empty but there was no one at the front to seat us. After standing there for a while someone came down from the bar area to greet us and seat us.   We ordered the shrimp  quinoa bowl and the chicken quinoa bowl and lemonade.  Someone from the kitchen brought our meals to the table. He didn't look very happy.  Upon examining the bowls I noticed that our quinoa was brown rice.  I immediately told the waiter and he went to the kitchen. He never came back and no one from the restaurant came to the table to address our concerns. I don't have a problem with brown rice. I eat it all the time at home but I didn't order brown rice. So we ate the meager amount of brown rice and tasteless shrimp and decided that this would be our last visit to BJs.  The waiter seemed to be new at his job so I don't blame him and he received a good tip. quinoa costs three times what you will pay for brown rice but no one offered to adjust the price or even address the substitution.  I don't think BJs will be around much longer if this continues to be the type of service they present to the public. AND IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY DINNER. !!!!!!! August 1,2017."
Jeri A.,"Newport News, VA",0,6,,1.0,9/10/2015,"Walked in on a Wednesday evening, seated right away.  First time in.  Sat for approximately 7 minutes....never approached by any wait staff.  We got up, told the receptionist how disappointed we were....to her benefit she tried to get us to stay but we had already made up our minds to leave.   We will try to go back after its been open for a little bit and perhaps the kinks will be worked out."
Audra S.,"Newport News, VA",14,34,33,3.0,9/25/2015,"The food was decent american fare, their menu is extensive. Service was very good and the food came out promptly. No complaints."
J H.,"Gloucester Point, VA",0,28,17,2.0,5/7/2016,"Less than thrilling. Nothing was great or special with exception of dessert. The place was pretty packed so, can't be all bad. Just not my thing."
Cristopher S.,"Hampton, VA",2,9,3,1.0,6/10/2016,Just horrible flavorless food. There was nothing enjoyable about the meal that I or any of the 5 people I was with had. We all ordered different dishes. It was almost as if there was no seasoning or in some cases the food was overcooked. The asparagus was wilted and over breaded. The pasta sauce just was tasteless I don't know how that is even possible. Service was quit slow for it to be a Thursday night and plenty of empty seats. It's like the armpit of chain restaurants. I won't return again. The beer was good.
Lyndsey K.,"Newport News, VA",89,21,1,5.0,8/11/2016,"Amazing food and drinks. Be sure to try the avocado spring rolls!! We took my parents here literally just so they could try the avocado spring rolls. Every time we've come, the wait staff has been excellent and friendly!"
Michael S.,"Newport News, VA",13,7,1,5.0,10/13/2015,"Went there for lunch today.  I had not been there before. The staff was helpful and pieasent, the food wonderful. I had the Mahi Mahi I grilled tacos, which hit the spot.  My Mother had the club flatbread and had to take half home, it was huge. The beer and wine prices where what you would expect to pay at a brewpub, but reasonable. Overall, it is a great place for lunch."
Gary B.,"Newport News, VA",67,8,5,2.0,12/17/2016,"We will start with the ugly and finish with the good...she ordered a margarita, it was pure syrup and had to be sent back, completely undrinkable. I ordered a Long Island, same thing. Those are relatively expensive drinks and should be made as such. Not just a pitcher of premix junk. She had hers replaced with a BJ's classic mojito, too easy right. No such luck. So to the beer we went. You just can't mess that up. Our appetizers came out and finally a manager walked past asking us how things were going. I asked him for silverware plates and napkins. Now I'm not a picky person, but when my knife and fork had food crusted to them it's really pushing me to the point of no return lol. He immediately brought me clean silverware and all was well. The moz cheese sticks were great and the chips and sriracha dip also good. I had the roast beef dip, no complaints, good sandwich. She had the BLT salad and it was drenched in dressing lol. The other couple with us shared a pizza and seemed to enjoy it. I do love the atmosphere there, should we go back it will be burgers and beer. Nothing fancy, don't venture out on there very deep menu. Enjoy!"
