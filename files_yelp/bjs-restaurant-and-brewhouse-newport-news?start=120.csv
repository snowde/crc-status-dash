Pete N Maria S.,"Newport News, VA",96,20,4,3.0,10/5/2015,We came here with the family!  Atmosphere is nice! Server was great!  I ordered the fresh salad and steak! I wasn't really anything special the food was okay!
Angie F.,"Williamsburg, VA",13,46,25,4.0,9/5/2015,"Great food, decent experience, but room for improvement exists.  Went on a Thursday night with family and the place was packed. We ordered 2 apps - Brussel sprouts were good and the stuffed mushrooms were great. We order 3 different flights of their house brews (three of us drinking) which was a bit of a mess. Though all were ordered at the same time, we got them at different points so we couldn't enjoy together; the worst part being that they couldn't recall which glasses were which brew and then got 2 flights completely mixed up.  There is a huge difference between a lager and an IPA but the servers couldn't keep them straight. I had a ""starter"" salad that had watermelon, feta and arugula - delicious - and a flatbread.  We had entree salad, burger and chicken at the table and everyone really enjoyed their meal.  Our waiter (Devon?) was great.  However there were people assisting the waiters with their drinks, etc. and I think that caused more confusion than help. Overall, I will be back and I'm sending friends!  Be patient, they just opened and are working out the kinks."
Sarah L.,"Newport News, VA",11,15,1,5.0,9/16/2015,"We've been to several bjs in California and have always loved it. The food was great this time too. We had the ahi poke appetizer, a Caesar salad and bowl of the beer chili, and the gourmet meat pizza. Our server was decent but less than thrilled to be there. Probably because of all you nasty people writing bad reviews and giving them a hard time. Remember they're still learning and figuring it out so be nice and patient :) Also the next time we came in we had Olivia. She and her trainee were wonderful!"
John P.,"Newport News, VA",57,19,,2.0,10/17/2015,"Poor service.  Manager had to tell the hostess to greet and seat after we stood directly in front of station for a couple minutes. Food and drink was good, although overpriced when compared to similar restaurants"
Janelle T.,"Yorktown, VA",0,10,14,3.0,10/7/2015,"Arrived right after opening so waiting for a table wasn't a concern and right from the start I was overwhelmed by the menu.  Lots of options especially lighter fare so good to keep in mind.  We got the house made fountain cherry and orange cream soda both verrrrry good but the orange was overly sweet and couldn't drink much of it luckily the server switched it out for another drink no charge. We ordered the sriracha queso, he didn't ask so they put chili in it however that was delicious. The chips though....holy greasy...we asked for non greasy chips his answer was they make them fresh daily and they all look like that. He said he would try and get some non greasy ones and to his credit he tried but they were just as greasy.  Sad because the dip was good, he took it away and said he would take it off the bill.   My husband ordered double deluxe burger and it looked amazing and he said it was very good handmade patties no complaints.   I ordered the deep dish ravioli it was good, I will say if you read the description it mentions sausage and pepperoni, the sausage is like the pork topping on a Pizza Hut pizza and the pepperoni is diced so small you don't notice it.  But I want to be clear it was very good and big portion 4 giant ravioli in there.  If you like cheese this is for you.  Then we ordered trio pizookie dessert salted caramel,cookies and cream, and wht chocolate macadamia.  All good the fist two were really sweet the macadamia was good just not over the top sweet.  All in all a good shared dessert not premade but made to order. All in all service was okay but not impressive.  The appetizer was taken off but they didn't seem to care about fixing it.  The service was slow at times and everyone just have the impression they were there but not happy about it.  The runner that brought the dessert put it down and walked off, not horrible but would a little interaction hurt? Looks like a good place to see a game, kinda noisy and because the patio door was open we had flies circling the table.  My husband told me to add bring a moist towelette because everything will be sticky if you order those sodas. They are delicious but somehow managed to get everywhere, I'm assuming the frosty mugs as they melted contributed to this.   So the rating is mostly based on the food not the service/atmosphere."
Ryan P.,"Newport News, VA",0,4,,5.0,1/4/2017,"I love this place! I have been here many times and everything on the menu is awesome! The black and bleu burger is one of the best burgers that I have ever had! Appetizers are great. Drinks are really good too. The wait sometimes can be long but if you use the app that they have, you can book a table in advance."
Mike B.,"Laurel, DE",0,5,,1.0,12/30/2016,the food was amazing the service sucked I have never been so negotiated at a restaurant before waited over 20 min for a beer after asking for it and only  to have the waitress walk by 5 times looked right at me and also  left the dirty dishes on the tiny table only after asking to see the manager did she pay us any attention. I will never eat there again
Charlie B.,"Newport News, VA",141,6,,4.0,7/3/2016,The food is extremely good. It can be a little pricey which is too be expected. The desert is a must if you can afford it. The service is unfortunately not the best though. Still 4 stars though cause food and wide variety of alcohol.
Adam F.,"Manahawkin, NJ",25,11,1,3.0,9/17/2015,"My wife and I went a week after it opened, I had been to the chain across the country and had a good experience. We were able to get a booth by the bar very quickly. There was a great selection of beers and many local brews that I liked. Our service was good, my dinner was excellent and very good, looking forward to ordering it again. My wife's meal was another story, the food was good once we got the correct order. She ordered some specific changes that were not done and by the time she got her correct meal it was cold."
Nicole T.,"Newport News, VA",1,14,2,1.0,2/22/2016,"Overpriced & nothing to write home about! We tried pizza, root beer ribs, & chicken breasts. I would have expected the signature root beer ribs to at least have a hint of root beer flavor but they were just sweet ribs nothing stood out except sweetness. The pizza was just ok & the chicken was not memorable. No need to return here."
Jean M.,"Irving, TX",5,30,9,2.0,2/2/2016,"I have been to BJ's in other states. Namely, the great state of Texas. This place sucks compared to that location. Every time I have been to eat in, the service is severely lacking. The food is pretty ok. But seriously, to pay the prices for this type of restaurant to get bad service, is just not ok. If not for the BJ's rewards program, and curbside pick up, I would write this place off completely. My son is 7 and he likes their rootbeer ribs. We like their pizzas. On Mondays, if you join their email club, large pizzas are half off (as of this review). But otherwise, it's just not worth it."
Erin B.,"Gambrills, MD",26,8,,5.0,3/15/2016,"My husband and I went for the first time over the weekend, we will definitely be back. Service was excellent, our burgers were huge and juicy, and a great selection of beers on tap."
B. J. L.,"Russellville, TN",0,2,,1.0,2/6/2017,"Have went to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse  3 or 4 times when we visit our son and family.  Loved the place and the food.  Tonight we go, a Monday night, the hostess takes our name and how many, 4 plus a baby.  A manager walks by and ask the hostess how many and walks off.  Another manager comes up and ask us again how many and if we are with another party.  Again the same manager, 5 minutes later, comes back and ask the same question, how many!  Ridiculous!!!!  If you don't have enough servers and waitresses that is your problem!  You need to make it work and you need to make sure you don't approach your customers and ask them3 times in a span of 10 minutes how many in your party?  I still can't believe this just happened.  MAnagers...take notice that is a good way to run your customers off!  I can only imagine how the service would have been tonight if the manager has to ask 3 times how many is in your party.  AND...they were not busy at all!!!!  So disappointed!!!!l"
Benjamin M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,38,27,3.0,1/17/2016,All our food was cold and the waiter forever at all stages of the meal!!!   We stopped in for a quick bite after watching a 2.5 hour movie (The Revenant) and it took about as long as the movie to get us in and out.
Jose N.,"Newport News, VA",26,2,,2.0,2/14/2016,"So my husband and I were deciding whether we should give this place another chance, or get Wendy's. Needless to say, we chose to give this place a second shot. Should have gone with Wendy's. We were seated remarkably faster this time than the last. Considering our first attempt ended with a walk out the door and a night in with some take-out Chinese. But that's about where the compliments end. Our server seemed fairly new and shaken, however, I've been checked in on more frequently at a fast food chain than I was here. Food taste wise was o~kay. Presentation was aweful. I had a burger. From Ikea apparently, assembly was required. I think I would have had a better time spending my money on a one night stand and risking my marriage for the same price I spent here. Not much for pleasure. But too much for the experiences I had  here."
Karee M.,"Newport News, VA",2,23,2,4.0,4/5/2016,We've been here a few times and really enjoy the selection of beers posted on the wall.  The menu is extremely diverse so it should satisfy the cravings of everyone in your party.  I recommend this if you're looking for a casual spot for lunch or dinner.
Kathy R.,"Yorktown, VA",0,2,,1.0,10/3/2016,"Terrible service. Went there for my husband's birthday and sat for 20 minutes before I went to asked to be served. Instead of doing so, they continued to ignore us. We left."
Christne O.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,2,,1.0,10/2/2016,"The service was great, but the management was terrible! They offer football happy hour, but then won't play the volume on the games because 'we people want different games' so play the volume on at least one of the games instead of the 80's music playing! We weren't the only football people to leave...."
Tricia H.,"Goldsboro, NC",18,25,17,4.0,12/20/2015,"So far the food here has been really good.  This is a chain restaurant whether people realize it or not.  Typically I steer far and wide of any chains, I don't care for the canned and frozen approach to food generally speaking.   But it is what it is.  This is a place I can go to, and finally get a good Bison burger out East, as I get these when I am out west at various places.  The jumbalaya was so good,  whether pre-made or not.  We had eaten at Pat O'Brian and personally I thought the gumbo was very poor, so if I had to have Cajun food, I would prefer BJ'S over Pat O'Brian in NOLA (frozen, canned , I don't care...BJ'S version of Cajun was better and much spicier and flavorful).  I have a big pipe dream wish that restaurants would start making real rice, basmati preferably.  It's cheap, easy (with a rice cooker you can't go wrong),  and the texture and flavor is so superb compared to this mess of rice I find at chain restaurants. I don't think most people even know how good rice can be to begin with so that is me being too idealistic, and not specifically directed toward BJ'S exclusively.   Enough with the rice rant.  BJ's is really good, it's worth it, and I love their wide selection of beer.   I am glad I can visit it out East now instead of only out west.  Who doesn't love good BJ's, right."
Brad S.,"Sterling, VA",0,11,,2.0,11/14/2016,"Went back to this BJ's after a bad experience the last time, thought I would see if it was just a one time problem. Not to be, After being seated, it took 15 - 20 minutes before someone came to ask us if we wanted something to drink. We ordered appetizers, which took another 20-25 minutes. The other BJ restaurants are not like this. I don't know why they have a problem at this one."
