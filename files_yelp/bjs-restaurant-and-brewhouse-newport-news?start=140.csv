Jodi F.,"Newport News, VA",0,3,,4.0,11/14/2016,"Love this place. Food is amazing, service and managers are awesome. I would definitely recommend it for dining"
Jon F.,"Newport News, VA",1,1,,4.0,1/28/2016,"Food and service here is great. Can free sample all the different beer from the brew house. I had the spaghetti with meatballs and we also had the garlic knots. Both were delicious, and highly recommended. Been here several times now and have yet to be disappointed so if you haven't tried it yet, you definitely should! Service is good as well, the waiters and waitresses are very friendly I know we will definitely will be back!"
Melanie K.,"Hampton, VA",229,36,6,5.0,1/3/2016,"The food at this place is amazing!! It's not cheap but it is good! Bathrooms are usually clean. Service is always good when I go. I've been for lunch, dinner, and happy hour. The Pazooki's are to die for."
Tiffany G.,"Newport News, VA",0,11,4,5.0,11/11/2016,"I don't usually write reviews but from the time I called ahead to the moment I walked in the door I was warmly welcomed with exceptional service..  Shenita who took my order was awesome, very pleasant and is the reason I will come back again! I like the atmosphere and the prices weren't too bad either."
Mara D.,"Newport News, VA",0,29,,2.0,2/1/2016,I have been here on two seperate occasions since I gave them the benefit of the doubt on the first bad experience as they were clearly very busy and very understaffed.  I found out on my second visit that they are often understaffed and it is not just a fluke for all of the food to come out at the same time (apps and entrees) and that they are usually cold.  Due to being understaffed the service was marginal and the seating was a disaster as another party was sat at our table after we were called (after a 1 hour wait).  This resulted in being seated outside on a 50 degree night when all of the heaters were broken despite us asking if the space was heated and them confirming that it was. The only positive thing I can say about this restaurant is that the beer selection is good.
Wes B.,"Washington, DC",0,27,1,2.0,9/2/2016,"Meh. That is how I would describe this place. Service, food, beer--meh.  The only exception would be the menu. Good gravy, I think the founder went to a Cheesecake Factory and thought, ""I want a book for a menu too!""  Because that is what you get, an entire book. Unfortunately, the options, while many, are meh."
Matthew L.,"Newport News, VA",46,6,,1.0,12/21/2015,This place was extremely disappointing. Everything was very greasy and the same old thing you get at any other chain restaurant that serves a little bit of everything. Over priced junk food
Dominique L.,"Newport News, VA",32,19,1,3.0,3/16/2016,"I was here last night and it was ok, was expecting better...service and food wise. But will return with high hopes."
Hamp C.,"Madison, AL",1,47,10,5.0,2/20/2016,Great for lunch and dinner.  Go early for lunch and dinner though.  They get busy!  Lots of great beer on rotation.  I love the tuna steak salad.  Their appetizers are really yummy too!  All of them!  Great for happy hour with co-workers.  Big menu with lots of options for everyone.  Parking at the Tech Center is terribad though.
Kevin K.,"Newport News, VA",49,4,,3.0,2/20/2016,"This was a Friday and very busy. They were on wait . We were sat a table without silverware and didn't get any until we asked. Server was friendly, but had to many tables because she was busy and didn't check on us. We had a homeless man ask us for money in dining area. Food took really long time. Manager was busy walking around with blinders on. Other than that we will try to avoid this place on weekends. Better experience during the week."
Nancy J.,"Yorktown, VA",0,4,,1.0,10/25/2016,"Wow, keep trying to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but I'm done. Service is awful. Went there today with my son for lunch. We got seated right away, but that's it. We sat there for 10-15 minutes and never got greeted, offered water or anything. When the table across from us that came after us got waited on, we got up and left, went across the way to Mellow Mushroom-got waited on right away and the food was delicious."
Allen T.,"Lanexa, VA",0,6,,1.0,10/31/2015,The worst dining experience we have had. Wrong orders included giving a meal that my friend started eating and realized it was amother tables order. We watched the waiter  give the raten off plate to the other table!
Tiffany W.,"Suffolk, VA",16,28,34,1.0,11/14/2015,"I am from SoCal so I was beyond excited when I saw that they were building a BJs here. Sad to say though, it really is horrible and I do not see myself going back. The hostess was rude, our waiter seemed lost and my appetizer and pizza came out at the same time. Not only that, I had to ask for plates for my pizza and when I asked for silverware my waiter stated they didn't have any...... I asked if she can go to the back and just bring back a fork on a napkin that would be fine and she took 10 minutes doing that. I was also just given drink napkins the whole night and when I asked for the specialty drink of the night they were all out (at 7pm) . I didn't purchase a pizookie because it was overall just bad service :( Again, I was super excited and I just wanted to have my California experience here in Virginia with my family but sadly they do not want to return."
Joe G.,"Newport News, VA",1,2,,1.0,1/7/2016,"I went to BJ's with my family and was totally dissatisfied with the food and the service.My plan is to never go there again. We ordered pizza, sliders, chicken wings and pasta. Of all the dishes only the wings were good. If you value your money, please spend it somewhere else."
Cristy W.,"Williamsburg, VA",2,21,9,4.0,3/5/2016,"Great food and service, little pricey on the drinks with little alcohol but the food is amazing!!"
Cheryl F.,"Newport News, VA",0,18,3,2.0,3/5/2016,My triple decker sandwich reminded me of a convenience store sub.  It was served so cold that the cheese was actually hard. Kind of expensive for a 7-11 sub.   My husband on the other hand enjoyed his burger. I guess I was expecting more flavor from an $11 sandwich.
Brian B.,"Yorktown, VA",1,6,,1.0,10/14/2016,"Overall I've probably been to this restaurant 5 or 6 times total.  But more recently I have visited this establishment 2 times. The 1st was a couple of months ago and I swore I'd never go back.   My wife and I were there for almost 1 hour, at our table, before we could even get a drink, but that's not why I'm updating this review.  I'm updating the review because I was there again last night (10/13/16).  Why I went back, after declaring that I never would, is irrelevant but the experience has not changed.  We were a party of 5 that arrived at 6:30, were seated immediately, and then it took almost 2 1/2 hours to be served 1 pre-order round of drinks, 1 appetizer, 5 dinners, and 2 desserts.  And this was in a restaurant that, on the high side, was 1/2 full.  The service, as I could have predicted, was awful.  The waitress almost never checked on us, did not refill any glasses until we asked (and then got it wrong), and took forever to pick up the check after she dropped it off.  The food here is not bad but it's expensive.  Combine that with consistently poor service and the only advice I can offer you is ""Stay Away""."
Sue H.,"Hampton, VA",1,33,,3.0,11/6/2015,"I think they are working out the kinks still.  It's only been in operation less than two months.  However, it wasn't THAT crowded tonight and I had to wait a good amount of time for the food (not too bad but a little longer than average I'd say). Also, took a very long time to get drink refills... and honestly 14.95 for baked ravioli is a bit expensive. For that price, I'd of liked it to have included a small side salad but that was 3.95 extra.  The ravioli was average to less than (on a sliding scale I'd put it just below the middle). Reason was the top was rubbery/chewy.  Bottom ravioli was good. But nothing special. My husband had the baked Ziti.  He said Applebees was better. Also Olive Garden's...   Coffee I enjoyed as well as that delicious garlic knot. But pricey for what you get on some things. Other things on the menu looked good. Root beer glazed wings/ribs.  Also the pizzas looked cool but they are right next door to Mellow Mushroom so... I wanted to try the pot stickers but they were 10.95 for an appetizer and I just wanted to try one. Maybe another time. They had some unique tacos to try... so we'll be back. It didn't suck. But not that standout either."
Lauren G.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,3,,2.0,10/10/2016,I love bjs and I was very excited when they opened one in Newport news. But every experience I've had horrible service. I've order an appetizer twice now and both times I never received it. Today I ordered an appetizer and when I never received it I told the manager when she brought out our food and she said I'll go check on that right away. Never came back never said anything even though she walked right by my table. No apology or anything was said about it. At least It was taken off of my bill. The food is always great but I hope the service gets better. Very disapponting since I love this place
Derek P.,"Plymouth, MN",7,9,,1.0,10/15/2015,"As far as BJ's go, this is probably the worst one I've ever been to.  Food is ok, little sub par than than other BJ's.  The waitstaff and Bartenders are terrible...if you're not a local you can forget getting served in a timely fashion.  Couple of us went for Monday night Football and there were literally 7 people in the whole bar besides us and half of them were employee's off duty hanging out.  Very unprofessional.  Drinks were poorly made and mixed improperly.  When I asked some questions about the local brews on tap (besides the BJ branded variety) I  got dumbfounded looks and some chatter clearly indicating they knew very little about the beers they were serving.  Highly disappointing."
