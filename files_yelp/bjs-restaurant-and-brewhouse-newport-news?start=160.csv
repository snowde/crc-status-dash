Paul S.,"Hampton, VA",25,89,20,3.0,1/5/2016,"I was kind of disappointed, maybe it was because my son who is a big fan of BJ 's built it up so much or that it was their opening week, but it was packed, the service wasn't terrible but really not up to even mediocre standards. The food was not as great as advertised so I'd give a C- I will probably try it again in a few months to give them time to get it together"
Kevin S.,"Yorktown, VA",13,17,1,4.0,3/31/2016,Thank you for the Veterans Day special. It was very popular that day in the restaurant. My daughter and I had to wait for a table (too long) and then for two bar seats (10 minutes). I will be back!
Amanda R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",19,8,,5.0,6/9/2016,"Love everything here - the beer is SO GOOD, and I never leave without ordering an appetizer.  Avocado egg rolls, sriracha brussel sprouts highly recommended."
Tanner L.,"New York, NY",42,1,,1.0,11/14/2015,"The food here is decent, but if you're planning on going on a Friday or Saturday evening, don't waste your time. The hostess was rude at best, and our wait time was upwards of an hour after being told thirty minutes. When I went to speak to the manager to inquire about a wait time, he seated us at the bar, taking a table from a nice family who was just about to grab it (the bar is first come first served). When we told him that if we had wanted to sit at the bar we would have done so ourselves, he dismissed us immediately. Overall I am extremely unimpressed with the management of this restaurant and the staff they employ, and do not recommend it to my friends and family."
Ashley M.,"Newport News, VA",48,4,2,1.0,8/30/2015,"This place was ridiculously bad in terms of service AND food prep/taste. I was hoping for a good experience at a new place, and I tried BJ's 2 nights in a row to give it a chance. Sadly, I was disappointed both times with the lack of professionalism on the part of the wait staff and the shoddy food. On my first night, I visited the restaurant with my best friend. We were seated immediately at the bar and ordered drinks and mini pizzas. The mojito I got was one of the best I have tasted! We were off to a good start! I noticed that my pizza was taking a while but didn't really care because I was enjoying having the time to visit with my friend. The waitress came by and apologized at one point. She explained that they burnt my pizza to a crisp and that she made them make me a new pizza. When we finally got our food, the pizzas she brought were burnt! I can only imagine imagine how the first pizza looked. Now, I took my husband tonight to try to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Everyone has an off night every once in a while.  After being seated immediately, it took over 10 minutes for any of the servers to acknowledge us. When our waiter finally came, we ordered drinks and an appetizer. My strawberry mojito was amazing but my husband's beer was flat. Our spinach artichoke dip had no taste, and the greasy chips that accompanied it also came plated with chip crumbs, like at the bottom of a bag, and burnt pieces of God only knows what from the fryer. We ordered two entrees after we finished our app and they were both terrible. My husband remarked that his burger was greasy and tasted like chemicals, and my Cajun pasta tasted like Alfredo and marinara mixed together and sprinkled liberally with seasoning salt. Half of the noodles were even stuck together and uncooked. Halfway through our entree, we ordered a second round of drinks. We had been done with our food for 10 minutes before we saw the drinks. When the waiter sensed that we might be a bit upset, he remarked that this was what bothered him about the restaurant. He also told us his boss had assigned him a crazy table that was making his night difficult and he apologized. After he walked away, a waitress came by and yanked our ketchup off of our table without asking if we still needed it. My husband still had a plate of fries and half a burger in front of him. Once she saw his startled face, she grabbed another bottle and put it on our table while rolling her eyes... No apology or anything. When we brought it to the waiter's attention, he said a lot of the staff in the brewhouse had no class. Overall, we paid 80 dollars for crappy food and service. Very disappointing."
Justin P.,"Norfolk, VA",1,8,1,5.0,6/20/2016,"Excellent beer, good American food, prices are reasonable. With dozens of beers and a rotating guest beer list, you can try all kinds of brews and discover there is more to beer than generic light beers. So head in, dive into the world of micro brews and bring some friends."
Mike W.,"Yorktown, VA",0,23,,4.0,11/7/2015,"Been here twice now.  Once for dinner, once for beers.  Food is decent, really like the chili queso dip appetizer.  Prices aren't too high and are pretty much what you'd expect for the area. The wait times talked about by others is a little surprising since it's a fairly new place people are still checking it out.   The issuing at tech center as a whole is horrendous and I can only imagine it'll get worse as more stores are added. Anyway bj's is worth a visit and a few beers."
Jonathan D.,"Hampton, VA",31,19,2,3.0,8/25/2015,"My girlfriend suggested this place to me because I like to try different sorts of beer whenever possible.  We were sat immediately as it was just the two of us and they were quite busy. The decor is typical ""brewpub"" and appears larger inside than it does outside, however there isn't a brewery in the building. The beer selection was decent. 50 taps offering a range of their own selections and various others from well-known craft beer companies. They also have a menu that takes some time to get through.  After we were sat, we were greeted by our server, we'll call her S. She took our drink orders, I had the BJ's Harvest Hefeweizen and my significant other had the Strawberry Patch. She seemed to enjoy hers. The hefeweizen was decent. ""S"" seemed very interested in us ordering an appetizer, she came twice, we had decided not to order one, but S came again (a third time) and asked if we decided on one. Then we ordered our entrees (we hadn't decided because the menu is rather busy, so it took one more time for us to order.) I had the fish and chips and she had the Cajun Pasta. As for the portions, they are worth what you pay. 4 pieces of fish and a half plate of fries. And the pasta came in a deep plate. Well sparing intimate details the fish was a bit greasy (it was fried but even so), the fries a little dry but the flavor was excellent. The Cajun Pasta, not so much. My other-half described it as a mixture of Alfredo and marinara and something sweet. She didn't taste any of the blackening spice and barely ate any of it. The service was attentive but felt very rushed. We had only received our food 10 minutes before and had only been in the restaurant for about 40 minutes when ""S"" came by, and asked if everything was good and if she wanted a box for the pasta (first time). We were still working on our food, my date eats at a slow pace. Again, S comes by asks if she wants a box, I'm nearly finished eating at this point and my girlfriend says no thank you, and the waitress moves on again (twice). My plate is finished and the server comes by again and asks if she wants a box and if we want dessert. She says no again to the box (three times) and no dessert. She walks off and says she'll bring the check. We look at each other feeling like she wants to get rid of us. So I pay, and when she brings it back she has a takeaway box in her hand and asks again! (Four times!) So in and out in about an hour (I Wasn't looking for a fast dining experience). Granted, it was busy, but there were several open tables when we left. Might come back for drinks, but the experience left a lot to be desired. Sorry for the long winded review."
Whitney M.,"Yorktown, VA",90,5,,2.0,11/7/2015,We went for the first time last weekend and had a so so experience. The food was very good but the service was horrible. We waited 20 min for someone to even greet our table and another 20 min to get our drinks. Hopefully they get there staffed better trained because the place has potential but isn't going to make it with a rude and inexperienced staff that clearly does not care.
Natasha M.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,12,,5.0,1/6/2016,Always a great place to eat.   Feel in love at the location in Maryland and have been a BJ'S Brewery fan ever since.
Linette C.,"Newport News, VA",6,3,,4.0,12/6/2015,"I really love the ambiance and the service. I just wish they had more gluten free, soy free options. The gluten free pizza is great though!!"
Rosie C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3,26,17,5.0,12/5/2015,Everything we ordered tasted great. My bf got the burger and I got the wings and they were both pretty darn good. I'll definitely be coming back soon. Happy to have Sierra as my server!
Ashlei O.,"Hampton, VA",0,6,,2.0,1/1/2017,"This rating is based on first impression of walking in. Ok I had two experiences coming into this restaurant. The first time I had no reservations on a Thursday and the hostess with no personality told me a 45 to an hour wait. Another party of 3 came in called ahead and was able to sit right away. My second experience a young couple walked in right ahead of me with no reservation came in and was told by the very same hostess that it would take 10-15 min. I went up with my reservation and was instantly told 20-25 minutes. I asked why then she told me that wait list does not mean anything and you still have to wait after people who walk in. Another lady whose name I can't remember but was definitely a more senior member came up and I asked her if she can explain the process and she did very professionally and asked the hostess what wait time did she give me; and she lied and said she told me 10-15 minutes. She blatantly lied right in front of me. The more senior person told me it would not take that long and  had me seated in less than 10 minutes. This hostess was very unpleasant, unapproachable, and unprofessional on both occasions. My waitress was so awesome and so was the lady that intervened. The food was also awesome. I would move the hostess from the front to the back cause she is horrible at greeting people."
Carol D.,"Newport News, VA",68,18,,4.0,9/8/2015,"Went on a holiday yesterday and the place was packed and contrary to other Yelp comments, service was good. We were greeted quickly and after being asked our seating preference, we were immediately seated. Our waitress introduced herself and quickly brought drinks - and kept them filled. The menu is huge, focusing primarily on pizza and hamburgers but we were delighted to see quite a few 'weight conscious' items such as the delicious lemon thyme chicken. This dish was excellent, visually appealing, and a good portion size - Excellent! The variety of the menu impressed us as well - not just the same 'ole wings and mozzarella sticks, although there is a version of those.  I think some of the service complaints made by others on this site may be due to growing pains. I sure hope so as BJ's has a lot of competition about to open at Newport News' new Marketplace at VA Tech Center and we are glad to welcome them! Newport News has waited a long time for great restaurants!"
J S.,"Yonkers, NY",0,3,,5.0,10/10/2015,"Great food, great beer selection, great atmosphere, great service, great new mall. Have been there a few times and the food and drinks were consistently good which is impressive considering the large menu."
JeriLynn H.,"Severna Park, MD",60,106,60,3.0,11/9/2015,"I must say that I was very skeptical to dine at this restaurant at first, but so far from my experience the food has been good.  The location isn't the greatest in regards to parking and access. Also, the lobby/waiting area was poorly designed. My family attempted to eat here on a Sunday afternoon and there was no way for the hostess to distinguish who was still waiting for a buzzer and who had just walked in. Not to mention how cramped it becomes.  I would not recommend coming here during peak hours. Their lunch specials are very reasonable, and their dinner is great! The calamari appetizer is great quality and flavor, however, I would not recommend the wings because they do not look like the picture. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at the quality of their sandwiches and fries. If you love the shoestring fries, you will love their fries! The service is hit or miss. Some visits the service was amazing, others were mediocre at best. Being a new place, there is a lot of kinks that they still need to work out. Overall, I look forward to returning here..but just not during their peak hours."
Sadie L.,"Fairfax Station, VA",0,9,1,4.0,1/17/2016,"I've been here a few times and the service can be a bit slow, but the food and drinks are really good! But be warned some of the dishes are a bit spicy!"
Diane C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,17,,1.0,5/13/2016,Service is awful. Food is less to be desired. This is a chain restaurant but usually has great food! Not this establishment. So disappointing.
Michael F.,"Newport News, VA",17,7,2,2.0,1/8/2016,As a porter and stout drinker I would have to say their dark beer is below average in taste. I have eaten there twice the first time I ordered a burger they never asked me how I wanted it. I like mine on the rare side and it came out like a hockey puck. The second time I ate there I went for a desert and chose the smores pookie it was way to sweet. On the bright side their Red beer is pretty good.
Jennifer G.,"Hampton, VA",38,84,121,3.0,9/26/2015,We came here around 11 before the lunch rush really started. We came in the porch entrance and walked to the front. The hostesses were polite and so was our waitress. The food was typical bar food. Nothing special. The bar is great and the beer selection is great!
