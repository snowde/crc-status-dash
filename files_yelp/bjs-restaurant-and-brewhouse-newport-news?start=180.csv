Sarah M.,"Newport News, VA",10,22,6,5.0,10/11/2015,"WOW! I just finished up my left overs and seriously, just as good warmed up as it was in the restaurant (but I'm that crazy person that uses an oven instead of a microwave to reheat)  My best friend and I went in at about 1230am Friday night, not realizing they closed at 1. But instead of getting the typical rude vibe from employees that you expect in other restaurants at closing, they were all super friendly. So friendly we didn't even know it was closing time til our wonderful waitress said ""take a quick look over the menu, the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes and i want to make sure we get you in"" she got a house beer, and i got a skinny margarita, because in my mind that leaves more room for food calories!!! We ordered house made guacamole with chips for an appetizer, she got a california chicken flatbread, and i got....well I'm not sure the name but its like an avocado mixed with a little heaven and some other delicious things in an egg roll. A few minutes after putting our order in, a girl from the kitchen staff comes out to inform us they're out of chips for the guacamole but would love to give up some pita or something else to take its place. We aren't picky people, so we told her it was her call. She was friendly and funny, and brought us out our guacamole with some delicious cheesy bread. When our main dishes came we saw that it was way more food than we were expecting! Great serving sizes! We both got take home box's. The price was a bit steep as far as alcohol goes, most skinny margaritas i have are less than $5 and come in the half glasses, this one was also in a half glass but was almost $9!! The food pricing was average for the area. I will def be back!"
Rai S.,"Hampton, VA",3,14,,2.0,12/12/2015,Food is edible however 1st time ever I had to ask for seasoning for calamari :( Menu is Hugh just not good very loud not a good date place maybe sports bar & beer only I know management can't help screaming kids however it should motivate adult sports bar only I don't drink my date enjoyed the beer. Dessert not good just alright
Miranda B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,22,22,5.0,9/23/2015,"I had the black and blue-house burger with no tomato sub for a turkey patty and OH MY GOD AMAZING. Service was wonderful, very impressive. We did wait for 30 minutes for a table on a Wednesday night... So I would recommend reservations. But well worth the wait. Best burger I've had in a long time!"
Steve R.,"Yorktown, VA",0,10,6,2.0,10/22/2015,"Hostess did not have our table available for a 7:00 reservation for our party of 10 so we waited 30 minutes. We waited another 15 min after being seated for our waiter. After ordering drinks they came 15 minutes later and when we finally were able to order and the food arrived it was cold like it had been sitting waiting for pickup for a long time. The Oktoberfest beer was good, the hamburger bun was bigger than the patty and the fries and pizzas were cold. When the waiter finally arrived with our bill the wrong cards were charged and it was another 15 minutes before that was sorted out. It was a 3 hour dining "" experience""."
Steph W.,"Washington, DC",29,17,1,3.0,10/15/2015,food was decent. Super crowded and apparently our waitress had a party so she seem to be a little flustered. The drinks were amazing! The food was just ok. I had the New Orleans jambalaya. It was a little too spicy. I think it's should've been a pasta instead of over rice pilaf.
Chelsea P.,"Portsmouth, VA",1,2,,1.0,11/28/2015,The appetizer was greasy and tasteless (calamari). Entree was overcooked and flavorless (steak). The cherry on top was a hair hidden underneath the steak. I will not be back!
Alexis H.,"Newport News, VA",120,14,3,4.0,11/16/2015,I work close to this resteraunt so I stop by alot for my break. The spinach stuffed mushrooms are amazing and I always sit at the bar because I get the best service their. Stephanie is amazing and we've had long talks and she made me feel invited . The flat bread pizza and the peach margarita are also amazing.
Aiden B.,"Yorktown, VA",51,220,7,4.0,8/21/2015,"Large selection of drinks and food, suitable for all tastes.  Very busy, but it's new, so that's to be expected.  That said, don't come here if you're in a hurry, as your meal will take quite some time to be served...  I'll have to come back in a few months once all the hype dies down."
Mark C.,"Hampton, VA",0,12,,3.0,9/19/2015,"Nice place, the bar stood out with all the aluminated bottles of liquor in the background.  I had the pulled pork bbq sandwich. Was a bit messy to eat but was ok. Cole Slaw was very good. Waitress seemed to lack experience but was adequate.  Would probably go back again give it a second chance."
Kelly B.,"Newport News, VA",44,14,,5.0,9/18/2015,"The husband and I want to try out the new restraunt and while normally I prefer smaller local places the staff are all local am I right :). Our server Clarissa was awesome, as we are a bit of a handful (i have a food allergy and my husband just loves teasing people) she handled us and we all had a great time. We had the brussel sprouts as an appetizer *amazing. He had the mahi and shrimp and I had the parmesagn crusted chicken. Both tastey and filling definetly no room for dessert here. We each tried a couple of their beers and enjoyed both he especially likes the ipa collaboration done with Stone Brewing Co."
Tiffany D.,"Yorktown, VA",69,6,,4.0,1/14/2016,"My husband and I treated my parents and Uncle here last Saturday night.The staff here are very knowledgeable and willing to help with any questions. I am by no means a beer connoisseur, but the only ones I would recommend are the berry cider and the hefeweizen. I bought an 8 glass taster set for 5 people and those were the only two that were drinkable in all 5 of our opinions. Since we didn't drink the others and paid $16, the waitress gave us free desert. Their food was good. We tried the chicken club, veggie pasta, veggie pizza and two burgers. They do give you large servings so you get your moneys worth. They are a little on the pricey side and that is why I'm giving it 4 stars."
Sam N.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,9,,1.0,7/17/2016,"Corporate. Beware the beer ""sampler"", small taste of two types only.  A few local craft beers.  Better beer at the Virginia Brewing Company  or Alewerks.  Worth the drive."
Matt F.,"Berkley, MA",1,15,2,5.0,8/20/2015,I use to go to Bj once a week when I lived in Orlando so when I heard they were finally opened here I was excited. We decided to get take out and it was great.  We got the chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza and it was amazing. There deep dishes are the best pizza in the area. The restaurant looks great and had a ton of beers on tap. Can wait to dine in. This is a must stop if you are in the area
June J.,"Hampton, VA",55,13,5,3.0,12/25/2015,"The pizza was probably one of the best I've ever had. I ordered the House Special. The service, however, was extremely slow. My pizza came out before my appetizer (pretzels) and I canceled the pretzels after waiting for them for 55 minutes. Others were seated a good 30 minutes after us and received their food at the same time we did. It's unfortunate that their slow service will deter future visits because the food is amazing.  But you have to wait too long to get it!"
M S.,"Newport News, VA",3,16,2,4.0,5/20/2016,"I enjoyed this restaurant! Parking can be limited on some nights of the week but the food is great. I think it's cool how you register for the wait period on your phone and you get a text when it's your turn to be seated. How cool! Great portions and for those drink... wide selection of drinks. The atmosphere is modern,  dim and club like but it's not a club. I think they should have live music some nights. I think it would be great."
Geoff J.,"Palm City, FL",7,15,,1.0,5/19/2016,"Probably will get lost in what must be a sea of complaints on this location.  But, arrived around 8:15pm. Host was on phone with friends joking around. Told wait time was 15 minutes for table.  Once at table,  it was another 20 minutes before we had to leave because no server came over for introductions or drink order.  Talked to manager on duty on the way out,  she offered a free appetizer if we sat back down.  But 35 minutes total with no service is not worth a free app. This is not the first time I've had bad service,  but it was by far the worst of them. Shame,  because the food is normally excellent. But, I'm done.  Avoid this place. The frustration isn't worth it."
Jackie A.,"Newport News, VA",0,14,,1.0,9/21/2015,"Gave BJ's a shot last Friday around 4--we had a large party and it took about 10 minutes for them to get the tables together, even though the restaurant was fairly empty. The staff seemed to mostly be standing around.  Wen we were seated, another 10 minutes passed before the waitress took our drinks. We had been at the restaurant at least 30 minutes by the time our drink orders arrived, and the waitresses apparently had no idea which can drink was which, delivering orders only to take them back and give to another member of the party. The whole experience was completely disorganized. When we went to pay, one member of our party gave the waitress her card--and then waited easily 20 minutes for it to be returned. The waitress and her manager were over at the register doing who knows what, and my friend actually had to tell them to give back her card since she had to leave. Didn't even get so much as an apology from the manager for the obscene wait. The service was disorganized, and downright incompetent. Will never patronize this restaurant again."
Don G.,"Gloucester Courthouse, VA",0,6,2,3.0,9/14/2015,"Should be 3.5 stars ... Had to try the new brewpub in the area.  First impression was a nice decor and set up especially if you are interested in watching the latest game .  But after we were seated it took almost 10 minutes for anyone to stop by and say help or ask for our drink order.  Server finally stopped by and apologized for our wait and we ordered drinks and diner at the same time.... we had plenty of time read the menu ..., Nutty Brewnette brew was very tasty and the Broccoli Cheddar soup in a bread bowl was Very Good.  Dinner was served in good time and the only complaint we'd be for the Gourmet Mac & Cheese which was overlooked (guessing it was sitting under the warming lamps too long).  All in all, good brew, poor service, good  food.  We will return . ps.. Note to the management... You serve seafood items so you SHOULD have cocktail sauce..."
Tom P.,"Chesapeake, VA",28,2,,5.0,11/29/2015,"Absolutely delicious, my steak was cooked perfectly, my girlfriends pizza was amazing. Drinks were on point. Staff was attentive and friendly.  All around a great experience. Would definitely recommend. We are probably going to be regulars."
Casey B.,"Newport News, VA",0,17,35,4.0,8/25/2015,"We decided to try some place new tonight and came up with very mixed feelings about the place. We ordered the calamari which was very delicious. My son ordered the kids sliders which we ordered with the calamari. Both came out in 15 minutes. The beef slider patties were very small and not filling even for a kids meal. His thin cut French fries were very good.  My girlfriend and I ordered the BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza and the North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp.  And then we waited... And waited... And waited...  We waited a very long time for food just to be told it was already given out and that they were remaking it. Then we waited some more, they still convinced us to wait. All the managers had come to our table and apologized. They gave us no excuses because they had none. They were upfront about the situation. They handled everything the way they needed to, we will consider coming back.  Once we got our food, it was very good. Very flavorful dishes.  Our waitress, Crystal was excellent. She tried to keep us a happy as possible and was constantly checking on us. The managers were great. Jerry took care of everything in the right manner and had a great presence. Their customer service was awesome."
