Steve Y.,"Yorktown, VA",0,17,3,2.0,11/9/2015,Very good food... But very slow service... Took along time to get the beverage order and even longer for the food to be brought out.
Katherine M.,"Newport News, VA",0,11,,5.0,9/21/2015,"Food is awesome and Kendra is an amazing server!! Great burgers! The place is very calm and inviting, also. Definitely recommend this place."
Sharyn F.,"Newport News, VA",57,9,,1.0,9/17/2015,"Worst customer service ever. No interest in accomdating our party, slow service and actually said we had received a drink we never got. Once the newness wears off the lack of customer service will do them in."
Barbara D.,"Newport News, VA",10,2,,2.0,9/9/2015,"Several aspects of our meal were unpleasant.  Here are a few...waitstaff overwhelmed, lacked support and training. Not enough bartenders-drinks took a very long time to be delivered and then two of the four people at our table got the wrong drinks. Glasses and plates removed before we were done-it seemed like a hand grabbed things off the table before you could say ""WAIT"". The manger came by twice to ask us how our meal/service was.  We complained but he didn't do anything.  At one point in the evening, while the staff was frantically trying to keep up, he was leaning against the back wall doing absolutely nothing!  Final order from the bar arrived just as we were ready to go.  Although the food was good, the overall experience was unacceptable."
Justin W.,"Newport News, VA",0,3,,2.0,9/5/2015,Service needs some serious help/training. Very slow with getting a drink and keeping it full. Ordered a deep dish. Didn't have the size crust we ordered so got a larger size which tells me it's pre made. The pizza had ZERO pizza sauce on it. Not sure what that was about. Tasted like greasy Pizza Hut pizza. There must of been at least 100 servers working. You would think one would be able to keep there beer glass full.  This was second time with crappy service so let's see if third time will be a charm.
Lisa R.,"Yorktown, VA",21,2,,1.0,8/24/2015,"Opening night was awesome! Been here three nights in the first week with various groups. The second time we waited 30 minutes for soup/salad. My husband had both and could have finished if he hadn't waited for me before I received my salad. The third time, our burger was wrong twice after waiting nearly an hour for food. Also, when our bill came they charged me for the $13 dollar per glass wine versus the $6 that I ordered. They told me that I was wrong on that one. No budging on our bill for wine. Only one burger taken off after half our party ate and left before our order came to the table incorrectly the second time. Not to mention we had to ask to speak to a manager, I don't recommend."
Ralph H.,"Seaford, VA",44,32,1,2.0,8/19/2015,Had lunch there yesterday and was not impressed.  The beer selection was good but the food was expensive compared to similar dishes in the area.  Their burger was average and the fries were like potato sticks.  Definitely will not be frequenting this place very often.
Alyssa V.,"Yorktown, VA",0,5,,1.0,10/30/2015,I know this restaurant just opened recently and I was really looking forward to dining in with them. I was here on Wednesday of this week with my friend. We sat outside and the server did not come to our table until 10 min after we had been sat. We finally got our drinks and then ordered our appetizer. We probably waited about 30 minutes and finally got our appetizer and even then our server did not even take our main order of entrees. Finally another server came by and we had to ask for our order to be taken. This server also spilled a drink on my friend. Finally after waiting 20 minutes we got our entrees. Unfortunately my friend's sandwich was made wrong twice after she had told the server how she wanted it modified. She also never got another refill of soda. She ended up not even eating anything. The server asked the manager to talk to her right in front of me and the manager looked at her and kept on walking. It was really rude. My friend did not eat anything and they still charged her for half the appetizer and the drink that got spilled on her! I can't even tell you who our server was because we had 4 different people come by. I have served in my day so I know the pressure that comes with working in the food service industry but I know that you guys have been open well over a month so I don't understand why your servers have not been trained properly to do their jobs. They should have gotten plenty of training to not be this disorganized. I could look around me and see that there are piles of plates and glasses just sitting on the table. There is no excuse for this much chaos considering how many servers were working that day. I could also look and see that the guests around me were also dissatisfied with the service. I will never come back here again!
Don S.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,15,1,1.0,9/7/2015,"Horrible experience... There was construction and this was our first time visit so we parked in the only place we knew to parked and entered the side patio area where the gate was propped open to enter. Rather than any stuff willing to help show us where to go we got remarks by the staff ""this is not an entrance and or exit""! Well SORRY! How about you keep door closed or put a sign outside telling people what to do rather than acting rude to your first time guest! At the hostess stand we did not have much better luck. We sat in bar area did not get any service for 5 minutes and walked out same way we came in again rudely reminded by the horrible staff that the door opened to parking lot was not an exit??? So glade we did not order anything. Management needs to get a clue and do better job at guest service. Close the side door or put a sign there if you don't want foot traffic from that direction. Train your staff to be friendly not rude. Not what I was  expecting for a first-time visit."
