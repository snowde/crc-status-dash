Talore M.,"Newport News, VA",94,2,,5.0,7/9/2017,First time at BJs! I've always heard great things about this  place! The food was good and fresh my fries were scorching and the portions big! Unfortunately our waitress wasn't all that great no refills on water never stopped by our table  I had to ask another waitress for help several times! The waitress that helped us when the waitress assigned wouldn't was Toya she did great working her tables and ours too!
KJ H.,"Newport News, VA",0,15,6,2.0,1/15/2017,"Service was very slow, place was packed. Took a long while before our waitresses introduced her self. Order was made wrong which added more wait time. They have the staff to run a good flow but they suck, food is great!"
Joseph P.,"Pearl City, HI",0,2,,1.0,6/16/2017,"Okay food was alright, mediocre. But our server, Linda was a total wreck. Horrible service. First and last time. Me and my friends are very displeased. Took forever to have her ask what we wanted to drink, never checked up on us through out the night and took forever to give us our check and money. No tip, Fat fuckin L.... oh and she fucked up one of our friends order."
Sarah P.,"Newport News, VA",0,8,7,2.0,3/16/2017,"My family and I came here for a nice dinner on a Thursday night. After waiting almost an hour for the food, two orders mysteriously disappeared. We waited an additional 20-30 minutes for our missing meals. Our waitress was busting butt trying to appease the larger group tables she had, but they were highly understaffed. After a long wait we got our food. The manager was terrible with communication and I felt like our group was kind of shafted because we didn't fuss as much. They did comp the two meals that were missing as well as dessert. But I'm not sure we'll come back. Overall our dining experience took 2 1/2 hours."
Miranda C.,"Richmond Hill, GA",69,5,1,2.0,5/28/2017,"This place is really overpriced and disappointing. The menu is too extensive. Everything sounds wonderful in paper but if they condensed the menu and perfected some dishes instead of having such a varied menu, it would be better. My fries came out of the end of a bag and I got as many crumbs as actual fries. In my opinion, everything in the menu should be cut by $3. If you like their brand of beers, then this is the place for you."
Tina M.,"Yorktown, VA",8,6,3,2.0,5/24/2017,"Food is okay....the service is still slow even on a day when you are the only one in the dining area... wait staff have time to stand around talk, play on phones, etc"
Tania V.,"Newport News, VA",66,119,420,5.0,8/20/2016,Woo! I only came here for drinks. I ordered the Ultimate Long  Island and.let me tell you... I used to live in Long Island and their long islands weren't this strong! This punches you (in a good way) but take it Slow cuz dam...it'll knock you out! I went to a location in California and learned about BJs there. It's definitely got good pizza but I like the thinner crust not deep dish style...but then I'm from NY where deep dish doesn't quite reign too high.
Regan M.,"Newport News, VA",0,7,,1.0,6/14/2017,"After we were seated no server came to get our drink order or even acknowledged us for ten minutes. The plates brought to us for our appetizer were covered in sauce and clearly never cleaned. The manager didn't seem interested in correcting these issues and after waiting an hour for our entrees, the food we received was mediocre at best. The grilled cheese was oily enough to soak through the paper it came on and pool on the serving plate and their rib dip sandwiches are nowhere near being worth the price. We wanted to like it but won't be returning."
Lisa P.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,6,,3.0,9/26/2017,"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend last night. There were barely any patrons but the service was so slow. Our waitress was friendly but she was very inattentive. At one point, I asked for extra Parmesan for my pasta and although she passed the table a couple times while serving the adjacent table, I never did get my cheese. After our dessert, she never came back with the check and was nowhere to be found for a good 20mins. We finally flagged her down and made sure to tell her to split the check before we lost her again. Food was decent but the poor service just sticks in our minds. I'd go back again for drinks or the pizza cookies."
J D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,30,3,1.0,8/19/2017,Quite possibly the worst service I've received in a decade.  After waiting for 10 minutes our server finally made an appearance.  Took our drink orders and disappeared for another 10.  Took our food orders and disappeared again.  Managed to mess up my order rendering the food inedible.  Came back 5 minutes later to verify for a second time what was wrong.  By that time the others at our table were already halfway done with their meals.  Wound up cancelling my food order.  Waited 20 minutes for a drink during this fiasco.  As the Check arrived the final piece of ineptitude was laid out.  She forgot that I never received my meal and left it on the bill.  Thankfully mellow mushroom is right next door...
Kyla C.,"Newport News, VA",84,3,,2.0,6/12/2017,"I ordered my food online for pick up with some co-workers. I customized my burger adding avocado ($1), mayo and mustard. When my food came out, there was nothing on the burger that I added. When I asked the host he assured me the avocado was there. I said I do not see them, it's not there, he again said yes. When I walked outside I checked my to go box and there was no avocado. He tried to take my burger back to the kitchen just to add avocado but I instead asked him to just bring out the slices, the manager brought the slices out, on a plate and slide them onto my burger. There were no napkins or utensils in anyone's bags even though salads and soups were ordered.  All in all the experience was below average and the food was average."
Darnell P.,"Hampton, VA",194,188,901,3.0,1/1/2016,"We came for dinner New Years Night before the movies(Menu is full of options). We ordered calamari..""dont order"" to much oil from the fryer. We also orders the wings..they're ok When we ordered the pizza it came out COLD...How??? They kindly took it back/replaced it but did not remove from the bill. My steak was excellent and the baked Ziti was too Our server was Amber C..if it wasn't for her i would've pissed  more of a fit...ask for Amber"
Britney S.,"York, PA",193,15,,4.0,4/16/2017,"Tried this place four times and service is always good. Large menu with great variety. You must try one of their BJ brews! Definitely different. I've tried salad, sandwiches, soup, pizza, ribs, and apps! All great!"
Brie S.,"Poquoson, VA",79,2,,1.0,5/25/2017,"We have been to this location about 5 different times and tried to give them countless re-dos, but each time the service gets worse. Today it took us about 25 minutes to get waters, and then during that 25 minutes we decided to leave but first order a app to make our time worth it. Took about 15 minutes to get that and then 20 mins to get our check. Went over to Mellow Mushroom and got our food and drinks in half the time and it was delicious! Won't be going here again anytime soon!"
Trudy S.,"Newport News, VA",0,33,14,2.0,5/15/2017,The food is fantastic. The beer is over priced. The service was horrible. I was lucky to catch the server when she passed by. Each time I have been there I had a problem with my service. I had to order our drinks  multiple times because the servers would forget.
Heather W.,"Yorktown, VA",69,161,561,2.0,6/22/2016,"I've been here twice. Both times with friends, who didn't want to wait at Mellow Mushroom.  Basically: mediocre chain restaurant food, terrible service, that is terribly overpriced.  Both visits were with three friends. Both times we were there for over two hours. None of us order anything complicated. The first time I had the pan pizza (the smallest pizza known to man kind, mind you). The second time I had a salad. My friends ordered pasta. NOTHING that justifies being there for TWO hours.  Both visits, for a cocktail, dinner & tip, my total has been over $50. Are you freaking kidding me?"
Esmond C.,"Newport News, VA",60,5,,4.0,4/26/2017,Every time I come here i leave full and happy. I haven't had anything on the menu that I did not enjoy!
C T.,"Newport News, VA",0,46,11,5.0,4/19/2017,Bj's has great service and rarely ever had a wait. They are fast in bringing your drinks and food out. They have a good variety on the menu and the prices are reasonable.
Jarrod P.,"Ballston Spa, NY",4,3,,2.0,3/5/2017,"This place is great if you have 2 hours to kill for dinner. I've been there 3 times and they are painfully slow. The food and beer is good, but you'll want to allot a few hours to this place."
Makina L.,"South Newport News, Newport News, VA",96,1,,1.0,8/28/2017,"I've been here before and loved it so my boyfriend and I decided to grab a quick dessert after work and it was maybe the worst service we had ever experienced. When we walked in there was no one in the front to greet and seat us so we went to seat ourselves, thankfully once we did have a seat we had a very nice waiter. Yet even though he was nice he never came to check on us and after about 40 minutes of waiting we hadn't gotten our dessert yet. Now frustrated, we called over another waitress passing by and politely let her know our things haven't come yet and it would be great if she could get our server and let him know. Barely acknowledging what we had to say she walked away mumbling under her breath, I didn't understand much until she slightly louder said ""I don't even care."".... I ignored the comment and continued to calm my boyfriend down and finally about 5 minutes later out waiter came back with our treat apologizing for the wait and said how the person who was supposed to be running our things had left. Nothing but pure annoyance."
