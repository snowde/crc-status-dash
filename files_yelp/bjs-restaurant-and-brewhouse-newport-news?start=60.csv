Christina R.,"Newport News, VA",0,7,,4.0,8/1/2017,Their cauliflower Barbacoa tacos...yes! And their Brussels sprouts are delicious. Great place for a meet up or just a quick bite to eat. Plenty of great drink options as well.
Mallory Lynn M.,"Newport News, VA",69,16,,5.0,3/30/2017,"THE BEST!!!!!!!! One of our new favorite places! I regret waiting so long to try it out. We love everything. The burgers, the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, the pizza is to die for, and the pizookies are out of this world!!! And the selection of craft brews is awesome"
Alex L.,"Yorktown, VA",0,45,2,3.0,8/21/2017,Very extensive menu I visited three Sundays in a row and all three times my order was incorrect. The place lacks experienced management. Too bad the food once you get it is amazing. That is why I went back three times before giving up on them.
Brad M.,"Springfield, VA",304,19,5,5.0,3/26/2017,Great beers and phenomenal pizza...idk how this place doesn't have higher reviews..very clean place and upscale atmosphere..beautiful patio and corn-hole game to play when its nice out...love the Hopstorm IPA and Piraña Pale Ale...Ribeye was excellent too
Nat B.,"Crofton, MD",73,31,20,1.0,5/11/2016,"After coming here I was very happy I no longer live in Newport News; if this is what service in a new location is then I'll stick to the DC rudeness. I was so upset I couldn't even do my Yelp review bc I didn't want anger to motivate my review. I visited back in October when the restaurant was in its first few weeks of opening to celebrate a friend's birthday. I was shocked at how bad the service was. It was a large party of 10 which was known in advance because we made a reservation well in advance. It's understandable that you can get overwhelmed with large parties, there is no excuse for you to respond with a growl and ""what"" when you are asked a question. Needless to say after orders were wrong and waitresses being rude we all decided that would be the last time that establishment would receive any of our business."
Victoria C.,"Seattle, WA",238,165,355,4.0,8/20/2015,"My sister and I saw this place while checking out the new shopping center and decided to stop in for dinner on a Wednesday night. We both looked at the menu beforehand and were super excited. The menu's huge, they have almost anything you want. Sandwiches, burgers, pizza (both thin crust and deep dish), other special entrees, and a great selection of lighter/healthier foods even! It was pretty crowded when we got there. But there wasn't a wait for groups of 2!  If you had a larger group, be prepared to wait for a while. They do have a pretty awesome bar. We were seated immediately, so I didn't get a chance to go over there for a drink, maybe next time. The hostess was super nice, and our waitress came and took our drink orders. She was friendly and very helpful. I got the white peach margarita. It took a while to get our drinks, but nothing out of the ordinary for a place that was packed/busy. It was good, they had slices of peaches in mine, although white peaches have such a light peach flavor, it just tasted like a normal margarita but sweeter. I didn't mind it though. It was still delicious. We were both craving steak, so I ordered the House Top Sirloin (medium) with a baked potato and roasted brussels sprouts. The food didn't take as long as I thought it would to come out. The steak wasn't too big, but it was only $14.95, so I'm not complaining. It was good, temperature was spot on, although we both found our steaks to be a little bit dry. The brussels sprouts were cooked so well, I love the flavor of a nicely roasted vegetable. My sister finished everything, no complaints from her. We did do some people watching (who doesn't?) and took note of how awesome the other food looked. The pizza was a decent size, and the shrimp scampi was huge! We decided to order one of their famous pizookies, the Cookies n' Cream, for dessert. It was good, nothing too special about it honestly. I probably could have made it at home if I wanted to. We did finish most of it and enjoyed it. I was pretty full afterwards. It's a little pricey here, but we did order a drink, entree, and dessert. It's one of those higher up chain restaurants you know is going to be pretty good. I'll definitely be back to try one of their own brews and some of their pizza! They didn't run into any ""new restaurant, trying to get a hang of things"" problems which was a huge plus in my book!"
Mark S.,"Denton, TX",33,17,3,5.0,5/14/2016,"Went back to Give a Second Chance.... Needless to say a completely different experience our Server Bradley was amazing, spot on knew the menu, as well as very knowledgeable about all the Beers, Wines and Spirits... Food was top notch, and perfectly prepared. We ordered Avocado rolls, and Calamari...Both prepared to perfection. 3 meals, Shrimp Tacos....cooked and plated well..taste was spot on... Beet Salad ...Wife's choice again fresh greens very well put together... I had the Salmon with cherry sauce served with grilled asparagus and Spinach Couscous....Salmon grilled to perfection taste was amazing.. Asparagus was tender and tasty not over salted. Couscous delicious and cooked to the level you would expect at a fine dining establishment. The waitstaff all worked together to make sure that every table was waited on in a timely manner...no glass went empty... The GM David came by almost every table...very amazing visit...we will be going back again...thanks to a 110 percent turnaround from 8 months ago...."
Katrina C.,"Norfolk, VA",397,261,387,4.0,8/14/2015,"Oh yea! This place is pretty awesome for being a chain restaurant/brew house. As my colleague would say, it definitely reminded us of Gordon Biersch without the actual brewery in house. Yes, they do serve their own brewed beers on tap, but they don't actually produce it in this location. But as I've stated, it is a chain, primarily from California. So if you're a West-Coaster, you probably already know about this place. The new shopping center in Newport News is a perfect location for this chain. Surrounded with other chain restaurants, so more options for the folks around here. The atmosphere is open and bright with an industrial edge. The bar area has 3 huge flat screen TVs with loads of brightly lit bottles on the wall. There are 3 glass garage doors opposite side of the room with more seating behind. Plus there's a PATIO! Perfect for those nicer days/nights.  On to the real stuff: the FOOD! Since this was a ""dress rehearsal"" their menu was hand selected per table. We had the opportunity to try out their ""Calamari"" for appetizer and boy were they fresh and flaky! Pretty tasty stuff! One thing I would note though, is their presentation of this is a little lacking. Its such a huge rectangular plate for a tiny handful portion and then top that off with two awkwardly placed sauce cups that were just there on the other side. Maybe having it on a smaller plate would actually make it look like you're getting more than what is there. The eyes are the first thing that eats after all. On to the entrees. We opted for the ""Bacon Cheeseburger"" with fries, the ""Deep Dish Ravioli"" (aka lasagna) and their ""Honey Chipotle Salmon"" on a bed of cous cous and asparagus. Everything was super tasty! Out of the 3, my fave was their Salmon. That honey glaze was just scrumptious! Although we were not selected for their dessert, I would definitely recommend what they are apparently known for: the Pizookie! I will be back just for that soon and will update this review then.  Equally as important as the food, their service. Since they are brand new, I wont comment too much on some of their ""newly"" employed servers, but their PRO's (trainers) were fantastic! I love making small talks and sharing a laugh with servers that actually enjoy what they do. It just makes the dinning experience so much better! I don't quite remember their names, but they know who they are (pizookie hookup & orange county gal). You ladies definitely deserve great tips! As I've mentioned, I will be back for more. Maybe try out their happy hour one day."
Cliff H.,"Newport News, VA",38,78,67,4.0,8/22/2015,"BJ's is new to the area, so I've been trying to find a comparison to help friends figure out if they'd like it. BJ's is a more advanced version of Chilis. Restauranteurs who own authentic brewpubs must hate the economies of scale version of their business that BJ's propagates. They offer 10 of their own beers, but those are made offsite somewhere in large enough quantities to supply all of their restaurants. That's sort of disingenuous and combined with the faux-warehouse decor, makes BJ's aesthetically feel like they're trying too hard to ride a fad. A few years from now this restaurant might join the other chains trying to play catch-up with the flavor of the month and just come off outdated.  For now, though, BJ's is doing a few things very well. They were slammed on the Friday night we dined there. The hostess told us it would be about a 20 minute wait and, maybe she got lucky, we were seated exactly 20 minutes after she took our name. Our server was clearly reading from his talking points for the evening (try the egg rolls! they're everyone's favorite!), but was helpful in trying to select items from their large and diverse menu.  Let's talk about all that menu diversity for a sec. BJ's has everything from spring rolls (""Santa Fe Spring Rolls"" because apparently Santa Fe is known for their spring rolls?) to deep dish pizzas to ""loaded"" burgers. Having so many different things on the menu always makes me wonder if that hurts the kitchen's ability to perfect the dishes they do really well or if spreads them too thin. It's probably a sign that they get most of their food from frozen bags that can be dropped in a fryer. I had the Spicy Hawaiian Deep Dish Pizza and my fiend had the Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza. Both tasted great and came out very quickly. I ordered the ""small"" and she ordered the ""mini,"" but they came out the exact same size. No complaints really but what was the extra couple bucks for if I could've just ordered the mini. I guess I also would've lost a little masculine pride ordering a ""mini."" Pizza should come in one size - ""all."" I want ALL the pizza.  My daughter ordered the Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl. It came with a good lookin' piece of fish. I'm not a big salmon guy, but it looked good enough for me to beg for a bite off her plate.  We finished our meal with the Pizookie Trio. I hated it. The cookies and ice cream were good, but you're never going to get me to say the word ""pizookie."" Stop it with the fake words. This is a great example of what I was getting at in my opening paragraph. BJ's looks and feels cool now, but a few more years of made up words and passing trends and you're left with an expensive Cheddars.  I recommend going, but bring a credit card. Our 3-person dinner came out to $93 after tip AND a 20% discount for paging with their app. Maybe a better comparison for BJ's is Burger & Barley down the road in Jefferson Commons. I'd prefer B&B because of their beer selection ($5 flight!) and more affordable pricing. And when does that Mellow Mushroom open anyway?"
Brittany H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",66,1,,2.0,1/27/2017,"Don't waste your time making a reservation, its pointless. We made a reservation for 7 people between 5:45-6 and still had to wait 40 minutes for them to put two tables together. The two stars is only for the food, on this occasion we thought it was worth the wait however I don't think we will be willing to wait this long again when a reservation has been made."
Carolee L.,"Newport News, VA",1,52,1,4.0,1/18/2017,"Great happy hour. We have never sat at a table, we always are in the bar area. Justina is a good bar tender. It's a chain and has reward points. Great apps and excellent Wedge Salad that even my husband will eat!"
Nina K.,"Newport News, VA",21,55,3,2.0,12/7/2016,"Atrocious service. That's it. Overpriced food, the options are diverse, but the food seems like microwaved food plated from TV dinners. The boneless wings were so salty and like microwaved over-breaded frozen popcorn chicken drenched in cheap sauce. The broccoli cheese soup was also not great, but way better than their boneless wings. If the service made up for the food I'd say go check it out, but really, you shouldn't."
Elise S.,"Newport News, VA",1,31,,3.0,3/26/2016,"It's a chain with mediocre food. Nothing brazen to complain about but not a single thing to get excited about. Perhaps a good place to go drink with a large group? Atmosphere: It's clean and they have seats. Nothing wrong with the decor; standard bar chain personality. It can accommodate a very large group but I would be sure to call ahead if that's what you need.  Service: I had a good waitress on my visit. She was friendly, knew the menu, and quickly corrected the mistake made with my meal when brought out. My water stayed replenished, which always earns bonus points from me.  Food: Standard chain food. I can get the same nuked meal from Chili's, Applebee's, TGIF, etc. Nothing was specifically wrong with it but I don't crave it and nothing on my plate (chicken, potatoes, broccoli) had anything going on that was particularly special or interesting. Portion was reasonable to the price and all my food came out hot."
Glenn B.,"Yorktown, VA",0,12,9,5.0,12/19/2016,"Awesome, extensive menu for a brew house ... and then on top of that, the food tastes great!!!"
susan p.,"Newport News, VA",35,10,4,2.0,1/22/2017,"Overpriced!!!  Shocking prices for what it is.  Steak was dry and gross...my meal, the parmesan chicken was tasty but definitely not worth the $$$.  I will not be back to BJs.  Also this NN location, every time the front door opened freezing air would blow in. I felt like I had to keep my coat on the entire dinner. Not a good experience at all.  I regret that money spent."
Adrienne S.,"Alexandria, VA",125,196,322,3.0,4/24/2016,I went to one of these in California and loved it. This one is hopefully still working out the kinks because the service is hit or miss. The find us decent and prices are not bad. Their soda floats are really yummy! Great convenient location
Jennifer R.,"Ocean Springs, MS",29,29,4,3.0,1/5/2017,Good food and friendly staff. Never had a bad experience at BJs. Server made great recommendations. The Mediterranean tacos were incredible!!
Ana P.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",132,156,402,5.0,4/4/2016,"Great food, ambiance, service! Also, kid friendly! I will definitely be back!"
Chris S.,"Seffner, FL",41,58,11,1.0,12/29/2016,"I travel the country for work. This is the first BJ's that I have come across that doesn't have any food specials after 10 pm. If you are heading there for the late night special, keep this in mind. Took forever to get a beer and I sat at the bar. There were only a few people there, so no excuse. I will never go back."
Krisna G.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,18,,1.0,8/27/2016,"We decided to stop in for an early dinner to beat the crowd. 430 in the afternoon. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs and bacon cheeseburger well done. Burger was burnt and I requested a replacement.  15 mins later, still no burger.  At this point, my bf is done with his food.  Still no burger. We told them to keep the burger and asked for out check.   Spaghetti was greasy. Meatballs had a lot of grizzly and crunchy pieces that really don't belong in meatballs.  Otherwise it'd be called tendon balls.  Manager made us wait for our check but could careless about the poor quality.  I don't want free food but if you can't get a burger right then you really shouldn't be selling American food."
