Marina A.,"Newport News, VA",24,118,306,4.0,9/5/2016,"We beat the crowd. I ordered the under 795 calorie Ahi Salad. It's crunchy & full of flavor. They put 3-4 decorative dots of wasabi on the plate- BEWARE! I smeared one dot onto my salad on purpose and almost died. I later accidentally touched another death dot & my nose burned, my eyes watered & hubbs asked if I was ok. I survived. Kiddo ordered the mini deep dish combo & our waitress explained for the same price, we can get a large (we know what we are having for dinner) since it was half price anyway, we said, ""Yes!"" They have pink drinks and donate the proceeds to cancer. We ordered two strawberry lemonades, hubbs grabbed a blonde. After we devoured our food & boxed half the pizza, we ordered kiddo a pizzookie. I told her she's been a fan since she was in my belly back in Burbank, California. I prefer thin crust pizza, but the one she ordered was damn good. Server was great, we have the BJ's app & make sure to use it anytime  we come in for a bite. Place is normally loud, but today we were next to two very boisterous groups. I try to ignore it all, but even the family made a comment this time. Still a good time, good food."
Falichia R.,"Newport News, VA",72,9,4,5.0,12/3/2016,"My family and I really enjoy BJs restaurant. We have been here three times thus far and expect to return again numerous times. As our waitress always inform us it's really a pizza joint but has a little bit of everything on the menu. The Mediterranean deep dish pizza is very good, the guacamole burger is yummy, the asparagus is loaded in salt, it would be better without a chance of high blood pressure. If you're a wing person I would NOT recommend their wings as they are small and very dry. The restaurant brews its own beer and soda. I recommend the Amber beer it taste like a Samuel Adams autumn lager. The Blondie is a good light beer. The rootbeer, black cherry soda is delicious as well. Our service is usually good the waitresses check up on us from time to time and every single time we have been there the manager has stopped by to ask how everything was. The kids menu is also great and they offer crayons and a complimentary appetizer( garlic knot and grapes) to keep the children occupied. My only complaint would be that out of my entire table they carded  Me despite me being there with my husband and two children however I suppose that should be considered a compliment and protocol had they asked for everyone's ID."
BJ H.,"Portsmouth, VA",11,105,39,5.0,1/30/2016,Excellent!  This is my first time at this location but I have eaten at the one at Tri-County in Cincinnati. Always good food and good service.
Melissa H.,"Newport News, VA",3,21,1,3.0,9/6/2016,Food is a bit bland for my taste but it's a great spot to hang out with friends to have a drink or something to snack on.
Terry K.,"Newport News, VA",157,203,556,4.0,12/9/2015,"First visit after it appears the novelty of BJ's being in Newport News has worn off.  I delayed my visit because of the many horror stories I heard about extremely long wait times.  Not the case at all for me. Courteous and friendly greeting by the hostess, my wife asked for a booth and we were immediately seated.  The interior has an expected modern look.  The bar looks like it's from outer space (a good thing) with all the fancy lighting. As for the menu, to me it's a bit busy and somewhat disjointed.  I think it could be better organized - that's just me.  In any case the food my wife, my sister-in-law and I ordered was absolutely delicious. My sister-in-law ordered the Baby Back ribs, not aware they were ""Root Beer"" glazed.  One taste and her face lit up light a spotlight. After some encouragement I tried one of the ribs and it was moist, tender and had a taste/flavor I could not put my finger on it.  When I re-looked the menu - ah ha! Root Beer glaze was the mystery.  Very good.  My wife's tacos (1 shrimp, 1 Mahi Mahi) was cooked perfectly and tasty and yummy.  I'm originally from Chicago and unfortunately ordered the 6in Deep Dish BJ's favorite.  I was disappointed.  It was OK, but not up to my expectation - so next visit I'll be trying either a different menu item or a different pizza.  All in all a great eating experience.  It was worth the wait for us."
Vance S.,"Hampton, VA",174,268,156,5.0,11/23/2015,"Looking for a good bar or family or fun or whatever restaurant?  BJ's is it! THE MIXED BREWS ARE AWESOME!  A glass running $5.50 a glass may seem on the high side but it is worth every penny. We had a deep dish pizza which was good, it would have been better had I ask to have it cooked well done, you know, burn the edges a little. The menu selection was great! I seen a couple next to us have a wedge salad that was loading with the kitchen sink of toppings, Ill get that next time. The bar itself is amazing, they have neon lights behind the bottles that sits the mood. And they have wide-screen TV's all over the place so you can see your favorite sporting event. This place is a combination of everything. The bar area had plenty of seating but I still recommend you get there early on a weekend of special event. We got there around 5:00pm and glad we did, by 6:00 it was almost standing room only. My wife enjoyed it for her birthday and so did I. Prices are AWESOME! i am fan and will be back. GREAT SERVICE!"
Tyler D.,"Kaneohe, HI",53,25,18,1.0,11/15/2015,"This establishment will never receive my business again.  Let me just say first off that the food was decent, the service however was enough to lose me forever. The management seems to be non-existent.  No one seems to hustle or move with any sense of urgency.  We stood and waited at the front for five minutes before they could seat our party of four...right next to the door. Which was an open table the entire time we were standing there.  Why it was so difficult, I have no clue. After being seated for 7 minutes without even being greeted by a server I had to find someone and ask for a server, still it took another 3 minutes to get someone to us.  My wife requested ketchup with her French fries...this took another 5 minutes.  It was not crowded on the Sunday when we came in.   We weren't asking for anything out of the norm and we were being rather polite especially considering the fact that we were having to flag down people to get them to do their jobs.  Not really sure why people choose to work in the service industry if they aren't prepared to serve. I highly recommend you do not come to this establishment."
Angie W.,"Oakland, CA",44,47,7,1.0,11/11/2015,"Having been to numerous BJ's locations on the West Coast I was so excited when I found out they were opening one in Hampton Roads. I've been excited to go and figured I'd take my sister for her first experience and go in just to order a Pizookie dessert. First impression: This is certainly NOT the same atmosphere that the West Coast BJ's offer. It was one SMALL open room comparatively but really that's not affecting my review, just not what I was hoping for/expecting that I came to love and appreciate from all the previous locations I've been to. We went inside and there was no hostess to be seen. We waited. waited. waited. waited. A couple staff members looked right at us and kept walking. Some staff members were standing around the bar and just completely ignored us. I should mention we went at 10:30 PM and it was not even slightly crowded. We waited some more. Waited some more and finally after being ignored by all the staff (seriously, not even one person told us to wait that someone would help us in just a second, they made eye contact and just kept walking or kept talking at the bar). Isn't the host/hostess supposed to kinda set the first impression of the place? Non-existent host and being ignored by the very staff that would probably have waited on our table. Nope. We turned around and left. Not sure I'll even try giving this place another go. If they can't handle guests when it's empty, I'd HATE to see how they handle it during peak hours. My recommendation: Don't bother with this location."
Ted D.,"Hampton, VA",0,32,,2.0,5/8/2017,"Great location, lovely décor, fast service belies some very ordinary food offerings.  For example tried the jambalaya - over spiced, under shrimped, and you needed a microscope to see the sausage - a culinary disaster.  Recommend you use this place to start an evening with drinks and appetizers and head elsewhere for main courses."
Brittany S.,"Hampton, VA",4,141,5,4.0,8/27/2016,"Stopped in here for dessert and drinks on a Friday night at 8. We were seated right away and our server quickly came to take our order. We ordered a beer and cider from the bar which actually took a while to get. They said the bar was backed up and that was the cause for the delay. We also got the salted caramel pizzookie. Yes, so much yes, I could eat one every day. The berry burst cider is delicious too, one of my favorite ciders. Not the best BJ's location we have been to but it's a great restaurant to go to because they have something for everyone and a great drink selection."
Jon Z.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,11,1,1.0,11/1/2016,Im used to the BJ's restaurants out west and when i heard they opened one in Newport News I had to go! Unfortunately my experience at this BJ's differ from the other BJ's around the country. The service is slow and the food is barely edible. I gave this restaurant three tries and they are off my list of places to eat. You'd have better consistency and better tasting food at Mcdonalds.
Kina M.,"Newport News, VA",4,17,37,2.0,10/28/2015,"We've been to this location a few times now and the food can be a hit or miss. Tonight unfortunately it was a major miss. If you're thinking of calling in for carry out, be sure to check your food before you leave. We ordered three different pizza options and all of them were so over done they were difficult to eat. We were so disappointed. Our return to this location is questionable.  So, my fiancé called the manager about our horrible experience. The manager was apologetic and gave us a credit for the meals. We tried the same options and had much better results. We may consider going back."
Tara W.,"Williamsburg, VA",45,5,12,4.0,1/1/2016,The menu was extensive. Lots of beer to choose from! We had the calamari for appetizer they were over cooked and see tough. Our dinner was much better burger and Mahi mahi. I will be back.
Carolyn R.,"Newport News, VA",0,5,,2.0,10/12/2015,"Don't leave your phone at home, and be prepared to pay a lot for drinks while you wait (if you're lucky enough to get called). We made the mistake of going on a rainy Saturday night when everyone in town was checking this place out. The hostesses did not greet us, in fact were standing with backs to us and elbows on the stand.  Consciously not carrying our phones for the night threw them, as they said they would shout for us, but though we were nearby, never heard a shout.  Typically they text you when your table is ready. We paid over $40 for two beers and two wines while waiting.  Not being offered a menu, I was unpleasantly surprised at the bill. After seeing a server seat her friends, about an hour later, we went to the hostess and were told we had been called.  We finally got seated with harried looks from the hostess.   On the plus side our server was friendly and efficient, and the food was good, but not remarkable. The manager refused to address the issue of us seeing a server preferentially seat her friends. The whole atmosphere was one of lets get these people processed or they won't go away! I'm not sure if we'll go back."
Amanda U.,"Manayunk, Philadelphia, PA",42,24,3,1.0,11/9/2015,"Every time I've gone here I've had horrible service. The order is always wrong or takes over an hour to get a salad and soup. The food isn't bad, it's a shame the service takes so long because it ruins the restaurant for us. Went back about a week ago and the bartender who started out great ended the night poorly and with horrid decision. Didn't notify us of closing time or last call and was way more interested in talking to her friends than serving us. She offered her friends cheap pitchers of beer(we're talking $5 for craft beer pitchers) and didn't offer it to us when we asked about specials. In my business that's theft and seriously poor choices as a bartender.  All around bad place to spend any money- very disappointed"
Lori W.,"Oceanside, CA",241,403,1540,4.0,1/10/2016,"This is a chain restaurant that never varies in high quality food. I have had many dishes here before but only came for dessert and drinks in this visit. The pizzokies are amazing, and a secret is that you can do half of two flavored in the big ones. We ordered a salty caramel and double chocolate combo. It arrive quickly and was a more gooey concoction-the perfect taste for this treat. It's big enough to share or you can get three small ones to share as well. The atmosphere is honey enough that you don't feel like it's a chain. The service could have been more attentive otherwise it would have been 5 stars!"
Elizabeth J.,"Gloucester Courthouse, VA",0,20,,4.0,10/11/2016,"I really enjoyed the food as well as the appetizers. I highly recommend BJ'S  to those who haven't visited yet. It's always good to try something new. Prices are pretty reasonable,  environment very clean and very quaint. Nice location,with a ""Great""staff...."
Masha N.,"Fort Eustis, VA",0,12,,4.0,10/3/2015,"My husband and I have to been several BJ's in other states, so when we saw one was opening here in Newport News we got excited.  We came in on a Saturday a little after five. We had a 30 minute wait and finally got buzzed. We had to stand at the hostess desk while they chatted. They asked our name and then kept talking to each other. No one said ""just a moment"" or anything. Finally I asked ""can we get seated?"" The two girls rolled their eyes and the manager just made a face. Not starting out on a good foot! We finally got seated. Another five minutes go by and no one has brought bread or taken out drink order. A server, George, came by after a few more minutes and took our drink, appetizer, and entree orders at once.  The avocado egg rolls came out fast and they are tasty! The honey ginger dipping sauce gives them an amazing flavor. Our server is awesome and brings drink refills before we're even done with our egg rolls.  Egg rolls are done and a few minutes later out entrees are there. I had fish and chips, husband had the brisket bacon burger. Both were delicious! The food was great and came quickly. George was amazing! When we go back we will definitely make a request to have George as our server, he definitely brightened up our experience! I started with three stars but George bumped it to 4.  Front of house needs to work on their level of politeness and professionalism. Also disappointed the manager was standing there watching while the hostesses ignored us and didn't seem bothered. One the hostesses made eye contact when we left but didn't say ""thanks for coming"" or ""have a nice night"" or anything."
Jackie W.,"Newport News, VA",30,4,,1.0,9/6/2015,"My daughter and I decided to try the new place in town. It's been open for two weeks and I'd have thought that the kinks would be worked out, but I sure was wrong. From the moment we walked through the door the service was rude. I go to put our name on the list and the hostess asks for my cell number. I tell her no I don't want to give get it and she very loudly asks me if a own a cell phone. I reply that I do in fact own one but prefer not to give it out because I don't want spam messages from them. She rolls her eyes and asks for my name. We wait about twenty minutes and are seated. The waitress asks what beer we would like to try and I said none...she turns to my 16 year old and asks her if she would like something from the bar...sheesh...I'm not happy at this point. She brings my coffee without any sugar, creamer, or spoon...  We place our order and are so surprised when it comes out in under ten minutes. My medium rare steak is well done...in ten minutes!! I send it back, it comes out raw... I could go on but I'm too annoyed to type more..."
Cassandra P.,"Hampton, VA",6,25,12,5.0,6/20/2016,Came yesterday to celebrate Father's day with my husband. They were giving free pint glasses to the fathers with 20% off the next visit. The food was amazing and the beers even better. This is one of our favorite places to eat and continues to be. The place was packed but our server was on it was a hustle and bustle that is rare now. Definitely will be back.
