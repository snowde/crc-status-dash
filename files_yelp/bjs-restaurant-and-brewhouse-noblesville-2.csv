Leigh M.,"Brighton, MI",293,1,,5.0,1/2/2018,"I want to preface this review with the fact that I NEVER leave reviews. Ever.  And also the fact that I don't live in Indiana, but when I'm in town this is definitely top of my list to frequent!!  We went here for dinner tonight for my birthday and I'm so happy we did!! I'm giving BJ's 5-stars for obviously the food - there were SO many choices that even the pickiest eater could get something they want. We each got such different dishes and all across the board each dish was amazing. On top of that, I wish we could give more than 5-stars because our waiter, Nyree, was the SWEETEST. He was the perfect combination of attentive, professional, and laid-back. Everything he did was absolute quality. He even sang happy birthday to me - all by himself! He could have just brought me the free pizookie and left, but he sang and I thought that was so kind. I had one of the nicest birthday dinners because of it (it's the little  things, right?) So thank you, BJ's, for having such yummy food and thank you, Nyree, for such excellent service!! You made my birthday."
Paris H.,"Indianapolis, IN",80,24,6,3.0,12/11/2017,"This place gets 3 stars because it is overpriced. The food is good, but it's nothing SUPER special.  On the plus side, there was a lot to choose from on the menu. There are a lot of health conscious options. The strawberry lemonade was amazing. The dining area is very spacious. Our server wasn't very friendly or bubbly, but she gave good service. The food came out fast. The desserts are pretty good too."
Ken C.,"French Lick, IN",1,2,,5.0,12/6/2017,"Have been to BJ's twice recently and I now consider it one of my go-to spots for dining out.  I like that they take some risks with their menu instead of just offering the same old bar food as many other chains do.   Specifically, I highly recommend ordering from the ""Enlightened Entrees"" menu.  I have tried both the Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa Bowl and the Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles and they were both delicious (although the peanut chicken is my preference).   For an appetizer, I wouldn't pass up the chance to order the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts.  Delicious! The only negative for me were the house beers.  They were very mediocre (except for the Grand Cru seasonal and the Red Ale which were both above average).  However, they seem to offer a variety of local guest craft beers so you should be able to find something enjoyable. Highly recommended!"
Rob M.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,47,22,4.0,11/22/2017,"I recently visited BJ's for the first time with my parents. We all enjoyed our meals and drinks for the most part and our server was a fun guy once we got him to open up. The first beer that I got was a bit disappointing. I got BJ's amber ale (I can't remember the name of it) and it seemed like it lacked flavor. When I think of amber ales I typically associate a lot of flavor with a little bit of hop in it. As ambers go this one was very bland. It had very little flavor with not hop (I can take or leave the hop, but the flavor is important). I also got BJ's pumpkin ale, which was better and tasted as expected. We also ordered food. We all got a broccoli cheddar soup and mom got an order of ribs. The soup was very good and apparently the ribs were great as well.  Overall, I plan on making another visit to BJ's sometime! Thanks for the drinks, food, and service!"
Kerisa S.,"Fishers, IN",110,64,59,5.0,8/17/2017,"It's been a long while since my last review. Why? Summer chaos! So many wedding activities, travel, family functions, work stress, dog responsibilities, the list goes on and on and on! I just really haven't had the time. However, since I visited BJ's 3 times in 1 week I think I will take a quick minute and write about them!  I know BJ's has been open in noblesville for a while now and the parking lot is always packed. I never felt a need to go as I have gone to the one in Greenwood and one in Oklahoma City. Those restaurants were good, okay, nothing to write home about so didn't really care when BJ's opened here. However, my husband and I have gotten into this kick of attending the same 1-3 restaurants over and over and over again this summer with our busy lifestyles (another reason I was on review hiatus). I wanted to stay close to home one Friday but nothing elaborate  instead of the normal 3 we had been frequenting. I suggested BJ's.  Parking lot was packed when we arrived and the wait was 40 min but we don't like tables anyway and lucked out finding two seats at the bar. Our bar tender Carolyn was super friendly and helpful. I literally asked to see every Belgian beer bottle before I made my selection- and she was fine with it! She rocks. By the way, the one I picked (Delirium) was AMAZING and I recommend!  I was excited to see a menu with so many options. Seemed bigger than what I remembered from the other locations. AND they have gluten free pizza!  of course I asked Carolyn a million questions again and picked it because she said it would be a crispy crust and I hate doughy pizza. My husband ordered the Hawaiian deep dish pizza. I just got sausage pepperoni and mushroom on mine.  When they came out my pizza sadly was not crispy but doughy/maybe undercooked in the dough. I asked her what happened!? She was mortified and immediately took care of it for me. A guy from the kitchen - maybe a manager- came out and said he was sorry she even told them extra crispy and they were going to fix it right away. They did, and it was AMAZING! Best gluten free pizza I have yet honestly.  Overall great night and great experience.  Sunday -2 days later- rolls around and we go to lunch with my husbands friend to the place we always go to, one of the 3 and sitting there I was blah. I don't like their alcohol beer wine selection and food is eh. I quickly asked if they could finish their drinks and we go to BJ's to eat instead. We did! Sat at the bar again. Had Carolyn again. Everyone super fun and friendly again. Great experience.  Tried the tuna sashimi salad and it was okay, it just wasn't my pizza. Also got the couscous Mac and cheese which is a small plate but very cheesy. Husband and I loved but you need to be a big cheese lover. Drank my beer again!  Wednesday then rolls around and my husband went back to eat there since we didn't want to cook before leaving on Thursday for a short vacation. Carolyn was our bartender again, this time we were on first name basis and she knows my drink. I already felt like a regular and quite at home. Decided to try a burger but I already forgot which one, but it WAS good. Still tho- gluten free is still my fave. I've honestly been craving it all day today I think I'll make a trip there this weekend after being out of town the past  two weekends. Also need my delirium fix!  Definitely worth a try. Menu is huge. If you don't fall in love right away, try again, there are so many options! They also have a rewards program I discovered on the Wednesday visit and signed up for. Who doesn't like rewards!?"
Kelly M.,"Indianapolis, IN",329,50,39,3.0,7/24/2017,Decent place.  Reminds me of a mix of Scottys brew house with a TGI Friday's. Very extensive menu with a variety of things. Looks like they have a wide range and assortment of beers.  New restaurant therefore portion sizes are pretty big.
Tiffany C.,"Fishers, IN",9,66,111,5.0,6/4/2017,"Ordered take out the other day and the food was delicious! I'm a salad girl so I got the Ahi Tuna. I will definitely be ordering out again and hopefully dining in very soon!  UPDATE: is it possible for a restaurant to continuously go downhill!? Unfortunately, after the first try every time after they've constantly made my order wrong. I am a salad girl so it shouldn't be that difficult.  But be aware what is on the menu is NOT what you'll receive.  Tip: if ordering out check your order.  I've continued to order from here because once I remind them what the menu says they'll add the ingredients. Then the salads are great!  While waiting for them to remake my order I was writing this review and the manager HALERIE remade my salad and comped me without asking. She was VERY apologetic and personable."
Lavel L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",10,137,582,2.0,5/25/2017,"I am here on business and I came to this establishment for a late dinner. I have been to other BJ's and it was ""ok"", so I knew what I was getting.. First off I want to say that my waiter Eydie S was phenomenal!  She has been one of the best waiters that I have ever had.. Kept my strawberry lemonade replenished, recommended things on the menu, recommended things to do in the local area, just overall didn't seem like she was just there to do a job.   For my appetizer I got the stuffed mushrooms which were ok, I wouldn't get them again. They lacked flavor, and were just ok.. Almost, borderline not ok.. LOL For my dinner I choose the Turkey burger which again, was just ok and lacked flavor. Also I noticed that the patty was very small, it didn't even fill the bun! I got fries as a side, which came out hot and fresh.. But you really can't mess fries up. For desert I tried (3) small pazookies.. I tried the cookies and cream, chocolate, and macadamia nut one. All were good! Eydie and desert were the highlight of the meal/visit.. I am not sure if I will be back or should I say, I won't be going out of my way to go to BJ's. It's just ""ok"" nothing to brag or rave about.."
Chantelle O.,"Noblesville, IN",73,117,81,3.0,10/9/2017,This place is fine.  Even better if you are meeting friends for drinks.  I had an issue when ordering delivery online.  It said it didn't get my card number so I did it again thinking I put in the wrong number.   Ended up getting charged twice. The food is fine.  Nothing to write home about.
Erin Q.,"Indianapolis, IN",122,337,115,5.0,11/20/2017,"Met some of my gal pals here for an early dinner on Sunday. We were quickly seated and greeted by our server. I ordered the Peruvian Quinoa bowl with Shrimp. Heads up-it doesn't look much like the picture, but it was very tasty! Our server was very entertaining! He kept us laughing and made sure to check in often. Definitely request him if you go! John R.(John John:)), Thank you! Oh, I had the peanut butter pizookie too. My friends tried to tell me the chocolate chip was the best one, but I tasted it and disagree. Peanut Butter all the way!"
Lauren W.,"Fishers, IN",137,95,1027,4.0,2/22/2017,"BJ's is just what the Noblesville/Fishers area needed! The restaurant has a fun and lively atmosphere.  They serve a variety of craft beers, both their own BJ's brewed beer and a small selection of local microbrews. BJs is known for their handcrafted draft sodas that are made fresh daily. If neither of those beverages strike your fancy, they have a huge selection of cocktails and wine. They have about anything you could ever want on the menu...variety of appetizers, pasta, soup, pizza (both deep dish and flatbreads), ribs, chicken entrees, steak, sandwiches, salads and of course dessert...the Pizookie (I'll get to that later)!  We ordered chicken pot stickers, sriracha queso, a golden beat and arugula salad, and BJ's Brewhouse Classic tavern-cut pizza. All of the food was great! My favorite part of the meal was the Pizookie...a cookie in the form of a pizza what's not to love! It was Tuesday night, so the Pizookies were only $3 each. We ordered the chocolate chunk, which had two scoops of delicious vanilla ice cream on top of a warm chocolate chip cookie! They have 9 different flavors of Pizookies. I can't wait to go back and try another!  My only compliant is that the service was slow and the staff was not very attentive. The restaurant was packed when I went and they recently just opened, so perhaps that is why. BJ's has something for everyone and the food is delicious. Be sure to order a Pizookie!"
Nancy Z.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,3,,5.0,12/27/2017,"This is our new go-to place. Service never disappoints and the food is always good. Case in point: My husband, son and I went here yesterday for a late lunch. Food came out. We ate, talked and then the food runner came with a plate that was supposed to have been mine. I was so enjoying my food, I hadn't even remembered what I ordered."
Ryan A.,"Greenfield, IN",7,24,,5.0,12/25/2017,Been here twice and love it.  Service is always great and food is awesome!  Pizzas are the bomb!
Todd B.,"Noblesville, IN",4,17,13,4.0,11/11/2017,"The atmosphere and setup was more of a restaurant than a brew pub.  The spaghetti was awesome with some spicy  heat to it.  Side salads was an extra.  The pizza  looked pretty delish also.  I give it a ""Will Return"" rating."
John M.,"Carmel, IN",0,8,,5.0,12/22/2017,Excellent. Had heard of BJ's but had never been. I had the mozzarella salad and mini pig (Hawaiian) pizza. My wife had the Derby Cobb salad. Delicious. We will be back.
Suzanne S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",28,118,85,5.0,6/26/2017,"Fantastic prime rib available on weekends. I am very particular about prime rib and BJ's Noblesville knocks it out of the park. Portions are very generous. The triple chocolate pizookie is delicious--a perfect warm brownie topped with ice cream. So rich!  The tap list is impressive and is not limited to BJ's own beers--although as a lover of craft beer, I enjoy trying the seasonal choices. Service has always been friendly and efficient, despite being a busy place. Plan ahead for a wait--you won't be disappointed. Diverse, large menu with plenty of choices to satisfy a group."
Tony M.,"Indianapolis, IN",43,51,46,5.0,3/5/2017,"The great -  1) Mommy was blown away by the complimentary kids starter that included a little garlic knot and.a mini fresh fruit cup. This place gets that a happy child makes happy parents.  2) Rachel was phenomenal. She offered suggestions and was incredibly attentive to our every need.   3) Mommy was very pleased with the small beer tasters that allowed her to audition a couple of the many craft beers that are available on tap. The Jeremiah Red mixed with the Berry Burst Cider was very nice if you want to stay away from hoppy, bold beers.  The good -  1) The Barbacoa Cauliflower tacos were very flavorful but the pita offered just a bit too much breading for my taste. Would have loved them on a simple corn tortilla. I was served with side of red quinoa and brown rice super salad. My wife liked it very much.  2) The Turkey Burger was very good but the spicy mustard was a bit too bold for my wife. Without it it would have warranted an excellent rating.  The Could Have Been Better - 1) The Calamari was tough and chewy and was not a favorite.  Overall the experience exceeded our expectations for a new restaurant."
Brice S.,"Noblesville, IN",0,63,170,3.0,3/18/2017,The server was good. I tried a basic Brewhouse Burger. Pretty disappointed after ordering well done. Most of the Burger was pink. Extremely greasy. Great place to stop for a beer and appetizer.
Joe H.,"Fishers, IN",0,13,,4.0,12/3/2017,This place is pretty solid. The location and parking are pretty convenient. The atmosphere is slightly above average although nothing that special. The bar has a cool look to it. The staff seems pretty friendly. I had a nice chat with the bartender and she was pretty chatty and fun. The food is actually pretty delicious. They have great specials on certain days as well. I haven't had a chance to try their pizza yet but I bet it's pretty good. I had their hand pulled turkey dip and it was really delicious. The horseradish sauce with it is insanely good. I really like their beer selection here too. I'm a big fan of their Jeremiah Red beer. It's tasty and has a high alcohol content. They also have a great selection of cream sodas and root beer. I definitely recommend this place it hasn't done me wrong so far.
Craig M.,"Fishers, IN",5,62,33,3.0,3/26/2017,"We have been here twice, so this is a combination of two visits... Service is slow, seems unorganized, and the handhelds for ordering seem to slow the process from a customer perspective.  But with that said, the orders we've had were accurate. Both visits, there are a lot of people working the tables and it seems like they aren't fully communicating who's doing what. Staff has been friendly both visits. The foods is pretty average.  Nothing special.  We've had a combination of burgers, pizzas, salads, and pasta dishes, plus an appetizer & desserts. My deep dish reminded me of Pizza Hut's, but no where near as greasy as PH's.  Flavor was fine, but somewhat pricey for the quality. Pasta had good flavor. Salad at our table looked fine, but the ahi looks a ton smaller that the menu photo. Desserts were good, and our kids liked them a lot. The beers were decent as well.  Had multiple IPAs (which we enjoyed) and a bourbon barrel aged stout, which was just okay for the style.  It got better as it warmed, because it's served at a temperature colder than recommended for stouts."
John T.,"Westfield, IN",0,15,6,4.0,8/6/2017,"First time here, had a very nice experience. Looked super busy, but we were seated right away!  Energetic server was polite and not over bearing. Quick service with the beers and they were good and cold!  We opted to have burgers, both of ours were cooked just how we wanted them. Portions were solid, drinks were great and service all around was exceptional!  Highly recommend, it's casual, nice atmosphere and we'll be back to grab something again and maybe watch some football on the numerous tv's!"
Kenneth S.,"Fishers, IN",25,4,,1.0,10/23/2017,"The food is just ok but service is horrendous. Also, if you are going to offer curbside to go and your sign says until 9:00 pm but you tell me that because it's dark out you can't do it. By the way it's 7:20 pm. You guys really need to work on customer service. I also notice you seem to be a little understaffed since you can't answer a phone until it rings 20 times or acknowledge when someone comes in for their carryout order."
C.Michael T.,"Campbell, CA",248,50,,1.0,10/19/2017,"I was there today with my sister.  John, who was our waiter, was very personable, but he forgot the extra blue cheese, had to ask for Wipes, had to ask for a refill, potato was not cooked and was raw, took forever to get a new potato.  Where was the manager to help?  I thought the manager would come over and offer something because the food was not cooked.  I saw him there wondering around.  Not impressed. Had told my sister how good the one was in San Jose, Ca.  She said that she would not be back.  Such a letdown."
Joshua T.,"Seymour, IN",0,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,"We checked in online using their app, at the time it seemed like we were the ""smart ones"" since people were calling in and not getting put on the list from overhearing them talk outside. Well that being said we waited for our 35 minute quote time and nothing, 45 minutes... nothing. Finally I walked in to ask where we were in line and the hostess stated that she miss informed us our wait time and it would be ANOTHER 35-40 minutes from now. Unreal. People are having the same issues and walking out, causing scenes in the parking lot. I would say this isn't the best first impression... 2 stars... would be a one star but the bar staff was friendly. Update: Looked at the hostess screen, there are table who have been here for 45 minutes (of 3-4) getting sat in front of us who have been waiting 95 mins (from their screen) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Taking my family elsewhere. Don't waste your time or money. Dropped to a 1 star for good reasons"
JimandCathleen V.,"Cicero, IN",2,51,6,2.0,5/8/2017,"Been 3 times now. The food is great or I would have given 1 star.  However, the service is always slow/bad. (Bar &  restaurant ) Had to get our own menus first visit. Had to request silverware on visit one & two. Always have to ask for drink refills.  They can't seem to get the timing down with appetizers & food. If you don't mind your appetizers arriving with your meal, it's fine. (Our first visit the waiter said he would remove app from bill, but he didn't.  We didn't mind paying for it because we ate it)  There are so many places to eat around HTC poor service will kill a business. Too many places to choose from.  The parking lot is a disaster too.  Husband did enjoy the beer selection and prices.  I had a $10 Long Island ice tea on our first visit. (Horrible)  Pretty sure we won't be going back even with the coupon promotions I see they are doing now."
Casey C.,"Fishers, IN",6,13,33,4.0,7/18/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite spots to grab a drink, unwind from the workday and skip cooking! Highly recommend the egg rolls, can't go wrong with them."
Robin G.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,1,,4.0,10/22/2017,"Good food,  but hard to enjoy my food because of a football game on with the sound so loud you cannot carry on a conversation.  I have no problem with sports on Tv's but having the sound so loud you cannt hear anything else is irritating. So because of that, I am only giving them 4 stars, the food is good but wish they would either turn down or turn off the sound on the Tv's."
Nancy S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,3,7,5.0,4/28/2017,"Very impressed with the food, beers and service. Place was packed by 5:15 on a Friday but we got a seat right away. I will definitely return."
Laura S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,3/22/2017,"Horrible service. Went there when they first opened and waited 25 min at our table for a waitress to even show up.  Decided to give it a second chance and was still a horrible experience. Used the app to get our name on the list before leaving the house. Showed up and was told 20 min wait. 40 min later still no table and still told a 15-20 min wait. They then accidentally seated another group at our table, they got the ""names on the list confused"". Again told 15-20 min wait. We waited. 20 min later still no table. When approached by the manager he said ""calling ahead or using the app ahead of time didn't mean anything, your time doesn't start until you get to the restaurant"". I understand it's not a reservation but why am I not put on the list until after I show up? We walked out and he called 5 min later to tell us he'd have a table ready in 20 min. Haha right!"
Brian L.,"St Paul, MN",21,80,9,1.0,5/6/2017,"My cousin was just there, and after a two hour wait, was finally seated. Caveat Emptor."
David B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,2.0,6/29/2017,Delayed service with several empty table -  had the ribs with great sauce and delicious rub.....only issue was that they were the most tough and driest ribs I have ever been served.  I am sure they were cooked At sat too long. I never complain about food so I just asked the waitress to take the 3/4 slab to manager to show what they served ---  o response after that  Wife and dtr had great meal (chicken and tacos)
Rachel C.,"Fishers, IN",119,172,306,5.0,3/10/2017,Stellar service and food!! Our server was great about walking us through the history and background info of the restaurant as it is a new chain here in Indiana. He even let us know that if we downloaded the BJ's app on our phone we could receive a free mini pizookie (pizza cookie) ((it's so worth!)). I love that they have a health conscious section in their menu and how expansive their menu is in general. My husband and I shared an order of the turkey burger and a seared ahi salad. Food came out quickly and man it was DELICIOUS. I think I'm going to start getting into turkey burgers because of this burger. It was so juicy and flavorful; and the added dried cranberries with a kick of Dijon mustard on the burger just sent it to another level. The ahi salad was great as well. I loved how they added nori (seaweed) all over the dish and it really made me feel like I was eating a sushi dish without the carbs! And of course to finish off our lunch we were rewarded with a mini white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie A LA FREAKING MODE. ON THE HOUSE. Definitely looking forward to coming back for dinner!
Birgitta H.,"Fishers, IN",37,17,1,4.0,8/13/2017,"Decided to have my birthday dinner at BJ's.  Called ahead and did not have to wait more than a couple of minutes. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. The decor is cool and fun, a little loud but that's to be expected.  We enjoyed the appetizer sampler first. Great mix w mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, artichoke dip, and wings. We all ordered different menu items for our dinners. Everyone was very happy with their selections. The burgers are huge and juicy, steak was made perfectly to order and the mashed potatoes are delicious. The thin crust pizza is light and lets you enjoy the flavors of the generous toppings. The cherry glazed salmon was cooked just right and served with fresh and flavorful couscous and veggies. Since it was a birthday celebration, we finished the dinner by sharing a couple of the famous Pizookies, salted caramel and chocolate chip. A decadent way to end a great meal!"
Melissa C.,"Westfield, IN",0,2,,4.0,3/19/2017,"I highly recommend using the app to cut down the wait time.  After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes before our server came and took our drink order.   Once we were able to order, it didn't take long for our food to come.  The food was good.  I had the Flatbread Nachos and would recommend them!"
Joan M.,"Fishers, IN",11,6,,5.0,9/13/2017,"Always great food and service!  Wait staff is attentive, friendly and seems genuinely interested in the customers satisfaction."
Kennedy R.,"Fishers, IN",2,68,22,4.0,2/26/2017,"Visited bjs twice in a row this weekend, once with friends and once on a quick date before a movie and was not disappointed either time! They have excellent house brand beer that isn't brewed on site but still worth the $5.50ish per pint. On Wednesdays house pints will run you $4 :) The fried mozzarella appetizer was very large for the price and the trio of pizzookies was the perfect size to share! The service could be a little faster but with it being such a new restaurant and relatively busy that is to be expected."
Tres E.,"Fishers, IN",0,1,,5.0,12/9/2017,Great place to take family for wonderful food and drinks. Management and staff always accommodating to special requests and provide great service. One of our families favorite places to dine out with. Recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Lisa S.,"Noblesville, IN",123,79,182,2.0,4/10/2017,"Pricey.  My husband and I had regular bar food and 2 drinks, spent nearly $100. they have a large selection of beers and the service from the bar was good.  I just feel like, for bar food it shouldn't have been that expensive."
Dottie B.,"Fishers, IN",87,7,3,1.0,3/17/2017,"Ordered a $28 pizza via carryout. Was supposed to be the BJ's deep dish special. Curb service attendant was awesome!  However, when I got home with the pizza it was not deep dish, not fully cooked and looked like it had fallen on the ground and placed in the box. Once I called to inquire about my mistaken pizza I was on hold for 9 + minutes and was told it would be an hour to replace my said pizza. I ordered a $21 Puccinis instead and it was perfect as always. Won't be back."
Chris F.,"Zionsville, IN",0,16,,2.0,3/2/2017,The bar is fine and decor is classy.  If you are a health conscious individual there are much better choices for a restaurant however .  There Kale salad had at least half iceberg lettuce...pretty crappie for a 11$ salad. The steamed broccoli was also chewy and not prepared well.  To expensive to not enjoy
