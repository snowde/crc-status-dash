Jonathan A.,"Westfield, IN",121,40,23,5.0,2/11/2017,I gotta say this is probably one of my new favorite places to go. The food was fresh hot and came out fairly quickly. Wait staff was knowledgeable and friendly. A great variety for everyone in the family. The portion size for a large enough to split if needed.
Blayke L.,"Noblesville, IN",157,5,,5.0,6/20/2017,"We lived by a BJ's in Houston and were excited to see one here! This place is ALWAYS packed. Expect a wait. Food and service were great! Family friendly!! Our server was amazing, wish I could remember his name! Despite being extremely busy, he was very attentive to our table and amazing with our 4 year old. The menu is huge and has so many amazing choices. I ended uo getting the ahi tuna salad which was so tasty and very filling. My fiance got the double bacon guacamole burger... he is obsessed and hasn't stopped thinking about since! The manager stopped by each and every table including ours to see how our visit was. He was extremely friendly as well. Great addition to the area! Excited to bring visiting family and friends here. Looking forward to our next visit."
Craig B.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,47,14,1.0,3/26/2017,Local beer prices are excessive. No prices listed for the local beer...should have asked! Local beer priced 7.95 for pint of Dare Devil IPA vs. the average beer on the menu is less than 6.50 . High transportation costs for the local beer?  Food was ok over all was disappointed to order a beer off the featured local beers and be excessively charged . Doubt I will come back after a disguised price . The spaghetti and meatball was good though for 14.95 was not bad
Tiffany S.,"Fishers, IN",40,251,,4.0,3/12/2017,Everyone is rushing to this chain and the menu is big with lots of options. I have had the Brussels sprout salad both times and it is very good. If you want to please a lot of different people this is a good choice. Service has been friendly and fast.
Jackie B.,"Fishers, IN",0,5,,1.0,7/4/2017,"I am not one who posts on Yelp often; however, I feel that our experience needs to be shared with others.   I was extremely disappointed with our service on the evening of July 4th.  My family and I visited the restaurant for dinner.  We were seated about 7:30 and were greeted promptly by our server. He was very nice, a little stressed because he had several tables sat around the same time. However, he was quick with the drinks and placing our order.  My husband's salad and my son's kids appetizer plate were delivered very quickly after our order was placed, so all was good.   However, timed started to tick by.  Ten ... fifteen ... twenty ... thirty ... forty-five ... almost an HOUR later, part of my son's dinner was brought out.  Approximately 10 minutes after that, part of my dinner was brought out. I notified the server of the missing items and my husband's meal and he assured us that everything would be out quickly, and he would return with the missing sides.  The server brings the sides and another 10 minutes go by and my husband finally gets his meal.  His ribeye steak was the worst steak he or I have ever had.  He ordered it medium; however, it was more than well done.  The steak was seasoned so poorly that he couldn't even eat it.   It was clear throughout the meal that something was wrong in the kitchen as we noticed that no one in our section had food and no food was being brought out of the kitchen.  Eventually, the managers started walking around with the tickets for each table; however, neither one ever made it to all of the tables.  It seemed that only certain tables were selected.  We asked our waiter and other waiters to send the manager to our table; however after 15 minutes of waiting, the manager never spoke with us.  We heard rumors from other tables about the debacles in the kitchen (technology issues, staff walking out, managers trying to cook the food, etc); however, I find it quite inconsiderate that the managers didn't have the decency to speak with each individual table.  What makes me even more frustrated with this situation is we still received a bill.  Really!?!  After an hour of waiting and poor food, we still received a bill and the managers expected the servers to handle the frustrated customers.  It seems to me that the managers don't always have the procedures / logistics down to run a restaurant effectively, and that is sad.  I am disappointed in this experience and the food.  BJ's is no longer a restaurant that we will return to as they don't seem to respect all of their customers and don't place value in the customer service & logistics needed to run an effective restaurant."
Gern B.,"Noblesville, IN",3,110,,4.0,3/5/2017,Probably 3.5 stars. Service was great. We used the app to get on the wait list. People in front of us were being told 45 minutes but we waited about 10.  Food was good but my mashed potatoes were cold and very average. Not what I expected.  Beer was great but $5.75 /pint... Kinda expensive overall.
Meggan B.,"Ingalls, IN",4,5,2,4.0,11/19/2017,"My girlfriend and I were out and about Saturday night and needed drinks and food before our movie. Walked in to BJ's was told it was going to be a 20 min wait. Totally fine with us. My friend turned to me and said, ""if only we could get a couple drinks from the bar while we wait."" Low and behold a lovely lady from the bar came around the corner to get our drink order while we wait. Nice. I'll be honest the food menu was way too big. I was a bit skeptical of the quality with that size of a menu. I've worked in the restaurant business for years so I have a bit of insight I feel. We decided to split the prime rib special since I had food earlier, our waiter didn't seem happy about that at all. I understand with the check average dipping a bit, but we have several drinks and as long as the service was good I'm always going to tip20% or greater. He came back with a smile and a joke and made everything better. I enjoyed the prime rib, and the dessert was delicious. I'll be back for sure. Keep it up guys."
Lilia H.,"Fishers, IN",62,3,6,3.0,7/19/2017,First time I went for lunch and it was good. Next time I waited for 40 minutes and then took 10 minutes to get a waiter to come over. Because we waited so long we ordered an appetizer. Later we ordered dinner. Dinner came and no appetizer. All three of us were not that impressed with the food. Waiter was nice but clearly overwhelmed and I had to chase him down to get the check and again to pay. This was at 6 on a weeknight.
Kyle F.,"Fishers, IN",0,6,,1.0,9/4/2017,"One of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant.    At 1:30 on a Labor Day afternoon (place wasn't that crowded) it took over 35 minutes to get out appetizer and never did get a drink refill.   When I finally tracked down a manager (our server disappeared) he offered no apologies, but just said he would ""try to find our chips and queso"".   It did finally come, but at 45 plus minutes since we ordered we are still waiting on our food.   With all for the restaurants to choose from around HTC, this will probably be our last to BJs."
Doug V.,"Fishers, IN",2,11,,5.0,8/15/2017,Huge menu and I have loved everything I have had so far.  Nice craft beer selection as well.  Highly recommend the pizooki dessert.
John G.,"Noblesville, IN",561,10,21,5.0,8/4/2017,Amazing food and great atmosphere. Get the pizza and try one of their craft beers.  Have gone to BJ's several times and have not been disappointed once.
Brett H.,"Indianapolis, IN",98,4,,5.0,8/12/2017,"I have now been twice, and both visits were very pleasant. The server had good energy, with a nice knowledge of the menu and beers. Lots of options so it's hard to decide, and have yet to be let down with my choice. The beer was good both times and the service was on point. Would recommend giving this place a shot."
PollY S.,"Fishers, IN",94,12,2,4.0,8/4/2017,"I've had their Ahi Tuna salad a couple times. The tuna is great but the salad dressing on the salad is pretty bland. The bison burger was great but somehow they managed to overcook the fries and they were cold. I guess it just saved calories,  bc they were inedible lol."
Morgan M.,"Whitestown, IN",6,33,9,3.0,6/12/2017,"First time trying BJ's and I wasn't totally impressed. The food was ok, nothing special. I did like the environment and the service was great. I think it might be a good place to grab a drink and appetizer but probably won't return for a meal for the price I can find better."
Gabriella H.,"Pendleton, IN",25,2,,3.0,7/31/2017,All the male servers are hot it's the only reason I go at this point. Also I get the spaghetti and meatballs every time but the meatballs are too spicy.
Amber J.,"Fishers, IN",0,7,1,4.0,4/22/2017,"Great dining experience. Our server, Lynn, was attentive and very friendly. We had the deep dish pizza and it was delicious. The food prices are fair but the drink prices are a little pricey. Overall a great experience and we will definitely be back to try a few additional items on the menu."
Jeremiah L.,"Frisco, TX",100,3,,3.0,7/20/2017,"I had never been to BJ's before so I wasn't sure what to expect...And to be honest it wasn't the greatest. The service we received from the bartender Sarah was good and she was very hospitable. But the food was my problem with this place. The food in general was...passable, but they also had us waiting for almost 45 minutes. In the end...It wasn't worth the wait."
Markel W.,"Noblesville, IN",21,55,74,4.0,2/28/2017,"This is a new spot right outside the HTC facility and it was a pleasant surprise. While it was a long line to have a seat at the table, there was plenty of room at the bar. They brew an array of their own beers, so there's a huge variety. The facility itself is very attractive. We order dinner and appetizers. The appetizer portion was very sufficient and ended up filling me up prior to dinner. I ate my dinner the next day for lunch, salmon, and it was still delicious the next day. But for all of this, the bill was unexpectedly high. I'd give it $$$. The calamari was pretty good an the sriracha wings were on point. I'm looking forward to our next visit."
Tim B.,"Fishers, IN",0,2,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Awful service. They did about everything wrong that they could have. 3 different servers and were left sitting for 20 mins before even ordering. Server spilled beer on my wife and didn't apologize. Kids got wrong drinks, wife got wrong meal. They promised the right drinks and meal would come out right away but they never came. Tried to offer us a free dessert but we declined-we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Will not be giving them another chance."
Trtman W.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,69,,3.0,8/20/2017,"Mediocre food at best.  Good selection of beers...but be prepared to pay 6.50 for a Boston Lager...and other middle of the road beers.  Pizza has what tastes like frozen pizza dough.  Burgers are way too salty and take a look at the patty size to the bun size.  Wow!  They really need to find a smaller bun compared to that little burger.  However, if they did that it would seem like a ripoff to customers I imagine.  My kid got the bone in wings which were very dry.  They were so dry that I could tell by just looking at them.  There are much better places around the area for a beer and food."
