Margaret P.,"Noblesville, IN",29,28,1,2.0,5/1/2017,"I have visited the Noblesville location several times. My experience has been awesome up until this visit. My food has been great each time. My service the first visit was excellent on every level. I recommend this place highly to all of our hotel guest looking for a place to eat,drink,and meet with business people for conversation. That being said,in hesitatant at this point to do so. I brought a friend to lunch after church,was greeted promptly and curtious. Was seated quickly,and was quite pleased. We was greeted by our server asked for drink order then is when things turned. We wanted an appetizer as we were deciding what to order and just have a very casual relaxing lunch and conversation. As she took our app order she said so what do you want to order for lunch? I volunteered we'd like to just enjoy our appetizer for a bit. Not to her liking she asked again as soon as she saw the runner deliver the app.again I declined to order. Third time we did go ahead and order. Our server wasn't very informed to preparation of the mushroom burger.and didn't care to find an answer to my friends question only wanted our order. I ordered the mahi mahi and   was good not great... We had barely started eating when our server approached our table with my fork headed to my mouth her question wasn't how's your food tasting,is everything okay can I get you anything,none of the normal,just do y'all need a box??? Dumbfounded I gestured to my unbeaten meal,and stated no mam were eating but thank you. Well I can take this if you want to the app.,no thank you,we are still working on that also. No refills was offered for our drinks. I asked for a dessert menu later as none was offered. My friend had a after dinner drink the server don't understand the order so she was charged a full kaluha a full bailys for a cup of coffee which was a 15.50 cup of coffee. I only had a decade with our cookie Sunday. So great place great concept good food but the service on this occasion made for a very unpleasant day. I did have a buy one get one coupon which was good. However I still tip on the original amount. I really shouldn't have on this trip."
Temple R.,"Indianapolis, IN",195,29,28,4.0,3/4/2017,I've been twice now and I really enjoy the food! The staff has been really good each time. I went on Sunday for the prime rib special. Huge portion and it was cooked perfectly. My wine was alittle expensive but .... I will definitely be returning.
Melissa D.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,14,,1.0,3/28/2017,"This place is a joke. This was my first visit. It will be my last. I have had food poisoning all night and today. The service was awful. 25 minutes just to get a drink. Then you order your food and they bring your friends food but you get nothing for fifteen minutes. But I only got half of what I ordered. Another fifteen minutes and the waitress tells me they are out of what I ordered. Then I wait another ten minutes to get a menu. Then another thirty minutes for my food. I ordered Salmon. And it smelled awful. So I complained, the waitress said it smelled awful too. I asked how did they cook this, her response was a pizza oven, they pushed it threw twice, since we ordered it on the fly. Are you kidding me! Trying to kill someone!?! The manager on duty was a joke. He offered nothing, and acted like it was my fault."
Bill D.,"Fishers, IN",3,32,3,2.0,11/11/2017,"I have been here a few times prior for just a pint or two but today was my first time for a meal. We were having a late lunch/ early dinner around 3:00. Got seated pretty quickly, drink order taken, so far so good. Placed our food order, three burgers and a small pizza, nothing crazy. Food took more than 30 minutes and our server acknowledged that she thought they were plating our order but wasn't sure. Food finally came out, pizza was soggy, burgers were luke warm. Rather than make a issue and wait more we ate and paid. What really bothered me though is that this is a craft beer place and usually their house beer is pretty good. Today I was served a house Oktoberfest beer that was clearly off and shouldn't have been served to anyone. Maybe shame on me for ordering a marzen (typically brewed in Sept.) in November but I figured it was still good or they wouldn't have it on the board. Bottom line, probably won't be back. Disappointed."
Marley W.,"Anderson, IN",20,101,125,5.0,3/25/2017,Absolutely an amazing menu so many good things it was hard to make a choice. Ended up with a flight beers to make a choice there. And then claim chowder and salad and the brussels sprout appetizer all very tasty!  Will bring my family back here
M L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,26,7,3.0,4/29/2017,"The beers were good and the food was decent. However, without the. It one get one free entree from their app, this would have been a very expensive dinner.  I think the jambalaya for half the cost is better at Yats."
Meshia W.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,17,9,1.0,5/31/2017,"I've been to BJs in a different area and was excited to take my visiting parents to this location close to our home. Our table wasn't ready at the reservation time but that we ok. The restaurant was lively and had good energy. It was all downhill from here. Long story short, my mother's steak was under cooked and my husband received the wrong pizza. TWICE! A different waitress tried bring a 3rd incorrect pizza and when we asked for a manager, we were told ""I have to close one of my tables first then I'll find someone."" A manager, Blake, finally came to our table and was very cordial. However, his adjusted bill did not include items from our order!  It was such a failed dinner it was comical."
Michael B.,"Greenwood, IN",0,13,4,1.0,4/14/2017,"Call ahead is a joke. Called for a party for 6 to be reserved for 9:00 tonight (called at 5:00pm and was assured we would be fine). Arrived at 8:50 and was told we had 10 people in front of us and would be another 45-60 minutes. They know how to take the reservation, but don't know how to keep it!  Too many other options in the area as we took out party and $$$ and went elsewhere.   Very poor as the hostess could of cared less.  In return I will care less in ever returning!  Happy Easter and good luck."
L S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,19,1,3.0,3/19/2017,"I really wanted this to be an amazing place!  The food is wonderful and there are so many beer choices.  However, the TV had 60 min. on the screen and I asked the male bartender, Rob, to put on the women's NCAA game on instead. He changed all the screens to men's games. I had to convince a female bartender to put on the women's games on one fricking screen.  The  male bartender, with a star on his shoulder, ignored me the rest of the evening. Niiiiiiice... Ugh!  Then my friend told our server that she's a sheriff, showed her badge, and that she qualified for the ""buy a hero a beer"" perk. The server came back and said, ""I'm sorry but that doesn't qualify for alcohol. WTF, it's ""buy a hero a BEER"" promotion!!! Definitely gender biased restaurant."
Jennifer B.,"Fishers, IN",0,3,,2.0,3/17/2017,"So, we signed up for the waitlist ahead of time online and when we arrived we were told a 40-50 min but ended up waiting over 1 hr 20 min. We were told multiple times just 15 more minutes. Ugh!!! Seriously, ridiculous!! Then we FINALLY get our table and place a quick order for drinks and apps and we get the wrong apps! Then we wait for another 20+ minutes for the right app. Then we wait another 30+ minutes for our dinner order. Someone took my water,  I am starving and now I have nothing to drink.  Seriously HORRIBLE SERVICE! When we got our food I do have to say it was very good. I ordered the Chicken Quinoa and my husband ordered the Gumbo. Our waiter was struggling all evening. So hopefully they will pull it together because the menu looked good and full of healthy choices."
Greg S.,"Fishers, IN",0,8,,4.0,5/6/2017,"Friendly, appetizers were good, service from door to table was fine. Had new Gluten-free Peruvian Salmon dish, fantastic. Only flaw was drink refills took a bit. I would come back again to hopefully give it a 5 star. Overall would recommend to family and friends."
Katie H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,3,1,1.0,3/25/2017,"Save your money and time and go elsewhere, the service is slow and Restraunt is not very clean, I ordered a bacon cheese burger medium well and when it arrived it was raw in the middle I would not even consider it cooked to rare just raw, looked like they just seared the outside of patty and bun was absolutely soaked in grease, and for a bacon cheeseburger there was one piece of bacon broken in half, sent the burger back and ordered a bowl of tomato bisque when that arrived that was sent back to as well you could see a layer of grease floating on top and it did not taste like tomato bisque it tasted like grease, my husbands ordered a burger as well his was ok but frys were old and cold where my frys were fresh, so left without even having anything to eat. We Will Not Be Coming Back"
Michael R.,"Fishers, IN",0,6,4,5.0,2/20/2017,Went to BJ's with my wife the day after they opened and we had excellent service and equally excellent food. From the appetizer to our main meal everything was top notch and we will be visiting them again in the near future.
Luis R.,"Pendleton, IN",6,13,1,4.0,4/24/2017,"Place looks great and it has a really good atmosphere  if your going out for a casual night. Food is great, with a very wide selection of food. The app is one of kind and really useful compared to other restaurant apps out there. I recommend using the app at any chance to get deals and easy service. The current problem in run into is food service. Each time my family and I have dined here something from our dishes is missing. It's either chicken or dressing missing from a salad, some toppings missing, or just the wrong order served. What saves the day is the servers. Today we had John and he was by far the best to serve us. He got our order fixed, was very interactive, and really attentive on our table."
Marilyn C.,"Noblesville, IN",0,12,14,1.0,6/17/2017,"We went on a Sunday when it wasn't very busy and I ordered a glass of wine, when it arrived the glass was covered in a thick film of water spots. I asked the waitress for a clean glass and she looked at me like I had two heads, however took the wine and promptly returned with another glass of wine...exactly as water spotted as the first. The food we had was average-good. We will never go back. It's pretty bad when you can't serve drinks in clear glasses."
Christi K.,"Pendleton, IN",172,9,,5.0,2/27/2017,We loved it! Great meal! Great service! Great beer!  The pita tacos and pizza are good choices:) We will be back! Welcome to Hamilton town center!
Jennifer U.,"Indianapolis, IN",82,3,1,1.0,3/26/2017,"Great food, catastrophic staff.   Being my second time there, I downloaded the app and we did the call ahead thing but when we got there, we were told it would be 20 min. which was fine.  Then after 20 min we were told 35 min. After that it was an additional 20 min.  Mind you 5 big tables were empty when I walked to the bathroom during our wait...and don't think this is an unusual thing- this was happening to everyone around us in the waiting area.  To tell you your table is ready, the hostess screams your name. This restaurant is LOUD.   Wait staff is slow- very slow.  Took 20 min for 2 guys to figure out which one had our table.  Took 20 min after that to get drinks (I ordered water).  Took 30 min for them to bring my son's lemonade. The bathroom ran out of toilet paper.  The waiters do NOT take away empty glasses or dirty plates- they just keep piling them on the table.  The first time we ate at this restaurant our waiter was also ridiculously slow- and I even told a waitress walking by our table that someone spilled water on the floor and she stopped and looked at me and then kept walking.   I retold another waiter that water had spilled and he grabbed a towel that looked like they would wipe tables off with it and he wiped it up.   The food was so good I wanted to bring back the whole family including my elderly mother to give it another chance.  Both times I thought that the new flooring was slippery and you need to be careful walking so you don't slip.   Really Good food.  Desserts are fun and yummy.   Took forever to get a bill.  Lots of TV's.  Stressful dinner because of the wait time and staff and if being such a loud place.  3.5 hours later we were done with dinner- which isn't what we had planned.   I would warn anyone from attempting this place on a weekend night.   I've tried this place twice now- they've got a LOT of issues to work through.  **I think corporate needs to come and retrain this staff."
Shannon G.,"Fishers, IN",34,1,3,5.0,4/21/2017,We have enjoyed this restaurant more than any other that has recently come to the area.  Everyone is always friendly and the food is excellent.  My kids love it bcs if there is a wait they serve pizza in the lobby and they always get a start kids pack (garlic roll and fruit) before their meal comes out.  Good place that I see only getting to great with the few short months they have been open
Lawson S.,"Spring Lake, MI",5,14,1,5.0,6/25/2017,Amazing service while I was there from Taylor Weed. A must visit if you are in the area.
Anna V.,"Fishers, IN",76,2,3,1.0,7/14/2017,"I am not one to write reviews. I've worked in the restaurant business most of my adult life and my family has a business, so I know how service should be and still tip 20% regardless of the service if the restaurant is busy. Being a server can be hard work. I went into this establish with my friend at 11 on a Friday night. We chose to sit in a booth in the bar for our first experience. It was NOT busy. There were 2 other tables and maybe 5 people sitting at the bar top, where the bartender was caring for them. Our server greeted us and brought us water 5 minutes later. By the time, he came with our water, we were ready to order our food and drinks. He set our water down so fast and walked away. He took another tables order a few booths away, checked on the table behind us and never came back. We watched as he stood in the middle section of the bar top talking to a fellow coworker and watching tv. Didn't even glance at us. We waited and waited until we decided to just get up and leave. Pretty disappointing"
