Chris A.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,7,,2.0,7/25/2017,"Service was mediocre at best, waited so long for our drinks the ice was melted. Food was okay nothing to get excited about especially as long as we waited for it to make it to the table and then they still forgot one of our meals."
May H.,"Fishers, IN",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2017,The service was very poor.  From seating to ordering our drinks takes about 10 mins.  Then it took another 10 mins to get our drinks.  Went ahead with our appetizer order and entree order which is soup and a wedge salad.   It took 15 mins to get our appertizer then another 20 mins to get our soup and salad.  Took us an entire hour and 10 mins from seating to paying our bills.  Ridiculous! Will not be back...
Dee B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,16,,5.0,6/24/2017,"Greg was our server and did an amazing job! Prompt, polite and seemed to truly enjoy his job. The manager on duty (Blake?) was bussing tables and running around everywhere to ensure things were getting done. Good management inspires a good staff and this has been shown with our visits to BJ'S!!"
David W.,"Hillsboro, IL",0,62,18,2.0,4/19/2017,I went with a buddy from work after seeing the full parking lot during visits to Noblesville.  The place isn't ready to handle a crowd. The service was incredibly slow and the waiter didn't really seem interested. We luckily found a high top in the bar so didn't wait too long for table. The beer was warm and the food was average. There are better spots in Noblesville to eat and drink.
Jessica K.,"Fishers, IN",0,11,5,5.0,4/15/2017,"We moved from California and bjs is out go to place. Excited that it is closer instead of driving all the way to Greenwood. We went the second day they opened service was not too great. But went again last night and Douglas was the best server! The manager even acknowledged that he remembered our previous experiences weren't too good. But will continue to go again, and again."
Nancy H.,"McCordsville, IN",0,5,,5.0,5/19/2017,"This is a very popular and busy place!!!  They offer different/unusual items as well as the classics.  Delicious food and craft beer.  My recommendation is Thursday's rib  special - 1/2 rack ribs, house salad, two sides, and desert.  Great food and great value."
Phil D.,"Whiteland, IN",0,18,,5.0,5/23/2017,Douglas was awesome.  He was a great conversationalist and very prompt.  The restaurant was clean and service was very good.  I would recommend for a solid lunch and dinner.  Ask for Douglas.  We will.
Harsh P.,"Noblesville, IN",10,11,,5.0,3/18/2017,"Happy to see BJ'S in Noblesville!! Excellent appetizers, Flatbread and pizzas. Draft beers are really good. Saturdays are super super busy.. Avocado toast is a must try. Mediterranean pizza was real good!"
Beau M.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,,3.0,3/12/2017,"The restaurant is spacious and awesomely decorated. I moved from Las Vegas where we have several BJ's Brewhouse. We were sat rather quickly,(Sunday Night mind you) and our Server John was on top of things from the get go. We did however wait abnormally long for our beverages to hit the table, (Diet Pepsi). We ordered the queso, salsa, and the Brussel Sprouts. The chips were really greasy and stayed that way, almost like the oil wasn't hot enough and just saturated them. The Brussel Sprouts were great except for the random burnt french fries that were mixed in. Our main courses by the way were great! The Alfredo is always good and the salad my wife had was fresh and crisp.  Like I said John was all over it and made the night great for some of the little mishaps from the kitchen. I wanted to give four stars but couldn't in good conscience because of the apps.  One other thing. I would've like to speak with a Manager over the mishaps but no one came.  Again John you rock man!"
Lori O.,"Fishers, IN",0,4,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Did call ahead seating! It DID NOT WORK! We called at 5:50pm. They said 40 to 45 minutes from the time I called. Arrived at 6:18, checked in, and they said another 45 to 50 minute wait! In the end, we did not get sat for another hour and 30 minutes! Once we got sat, a server(s) came right to the table and food didn't take long to arrive. However, it was marginal at best. The ribs are definitely Not fall off the bone ribs. Needless to say, BJ's needs a lot of work in several areas."
J B.,"Fishers, IN",1,8,3,5.0,2/13/2017,Such a versatile restaurant and a welcome addition to the Fishers/Noblesville area.  Love the Sriracha dry rub wings and Jerry Burst beer blend.  Do yourself a favor and ask to have Taylor for your server; she's phenomenal!
Keith L.,"Fishers, IN",0,5,,1.0,3/18/2017,This was our first trip and we will not be back. We ordered cheeseburgers well done.  One was not even close.  The waitress seemed reluctant to take it back and we waited 20 minutes for the replacement.  They did not offer to do anything to fix their mistake.  In general the food was greasy and salty.  Not worth the money
Jon H.,"Noblesville, IN",0,8,,4.0,3/7/2017,"We got there right at 5pm on a Friday and it was starting to get busy already. We were seated immediately and the place was very efficient for how new it is. Appetizer (S&A Dip) was excellent and the Hawaiian spicy chicken pizza was excellent.  Service was great, but the floors seemed oily and slippery when walking out of the place."
Stacy C.,"Fishers, IN",0,26,,2.0,3/4/2017,"This was my second time, the first time was awesome but thiis time  soup was cold!  Was very disappointed this time and service was not that great."
Alexandria T.,"Fortville, IN",0,3,,3.0,2/18/2017,"I was so excited to go to bjs since I haven't been to one in 6 months when I was in Texas. My first experience (on Tuesday) was amazing. Our server was awesome. I wish I knew her name. She was fast, knew what she was doing, and very helpful. But our second visit ( tonight) was another story. First off I added my name to the wait list, went in to check in, they told me it would be 40 minutes at the latest. Okay sounds great. So we hung out for 50 minutes, then asked how much longer, they said about 10 minutes there was one other 2 top in front of us. Okay thank you. Well as we were standing there waiting I noticed that there was a table that was dirty. So I just kinda watched it for a little. A server came to take off the check book, then it sat there for 8 minutes. There were 4 managers standing around talking not 2 feet away. About 2 minutes later a manager come and puts all the glasses together but just left it there. I waited about 5 more minutes the went to say something. As I was saying something to the manager someone clean off the table. I was explaining to a manager what I have noticed and he just said there are two people waiting can you wait 5 minutes then we will take care of you. NO SORRY OR EXPLANATION. He just looked at me like I was stupid and just walked away. I wasn't even done talking to him. This continued to bother me through the night because I felt like I was not important. We finally got seated and the servers took very good care of us. My only concern was that when the servers are putting in our order they kinda Hover over and it's hard to talk without feeling rude. Besides that the rest of dinner was nice. I just felt very disrespected by that one manager with a pink button up.  Food was AWESOME!"
