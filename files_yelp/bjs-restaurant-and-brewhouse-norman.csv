Fran V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",325,156,320,4.0,12/27/2017,Came for a birthday dinner and all was great. We were served in a decent time and checked on every couple minutes for water and drinks. Great lighting and atmosphere for something intimate. I loved the setting. Great spot n their menu I didn't give it a 5 because their drinks could be a little stronger my mojito tasted like water basically.
Alex M.,"Dallas, TX",63,35,21,1.0,11/28/2017,"Received the absolute worst service from incompetent staff! My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday afternoon hoping to snag a good Happy Hour. Turns out, they just changed their Happy Hour menu to not include Friday's (though both of the staff that spoke to us had no idea). We started with the queso, which is just artificial cheese dip, and I had the Mediterranean chicken tacos. They were small and had a few morsels of chicken smothered in white sauce. Not great. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken bites which tasted like they had been nuked in the microwave after being frozen.  BUT the worst part was after the meal.. my boyfriend left his phone behind and didn't realize until after we had left. When he tracked his phone on his Tile app, he saw it was located at BJ's. We called the manager that night and they said they would look for it during their ""nightly clean."" We called again in the morning, got transferred to three different people asking how they could help us (hand the phone to someone who can please) and they said they hadn't found the wallet but would ""keep looking."" I even told them which booth we sat at, and they swore they looked but couldn't locate it. Finally, we were able to drive back up to BJ's. We immediately go to the booth we sat at a few nights before and what do you know... the wallet is underneath the table sitting in water. Are you kidding me BJ's? So much for a nightly clean. Totally unprofessional and unhelpful - definitely will not be returning."
Carla M.,"Chandler, AZ",149,6,3,1.0,9/16/2017,In Norman waiting for the OU game to start.... waiting  . . . . BJ's poor timing on getting your direct tv to cooperate. Get game ready #damn
Lorri A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",54,38,343,4.0,12/22/2017,"Dining in is good. The wait time really isn't that bad. They have a huge menu. So, if you want it they probably have it. Drinks at the bar are good and service is pretty quick. However,  their curbside pick up and just regular pick up orders is lacking. Went to pick up on a Friday and all the spots for curbside were full.  Parked at bfe went in to get curbside order and waited around for a good 10 mins. I had servers walk past me and not even ask if I needed help. Same thing goes when I order pick up. I pick a specific time to pick up, I'm there to pick up at specific time. Apparently, your Togo order people didn't get the message because again I wait about 10 minutes to even get noticed.  Just aggravating."
Alan N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",173,513,300,4.0,12/6/2017,"Pretty decent, just your normal BJs with their massive menu. Came here during Veterans Day so this review is a bit delayed. The food here is good, tastes like any normal Chain restaurant you can find around, large drink menu though and plenty of tv. Did not get a pizookie this time but it seems they've gotten more flavors since I last visited. Just a decent place If you're in the mood and have a party between 6-10z"
Michelle M.,"Norman, OK",80,65,85,4.0,3/30/2017,"Got an email advertising free Pizookie day dessert with $9.95 food purchase on 3/29. My boyfriend and I went because we like their deep dish pizza.  Such a good choice, welcoming and great service. Food brought out quick and hot!! This place never disappoints us!! The biggest problem is deciding what to eat... So many yummy choices!  Thank you BJ's Brewhouse staff!!"
Nate S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",97,79,126,3.0,7/3/2017,"We came in a little after 3pm for the Monday special which is half off a large deep dish pizza. We were sat and tended to quickly and ordered waters, macaroni appetizer and a pizza. The app came out with the pizza and we wish we would have been told it would take so long. After we received our food the server checked up on us soon after then disappeared. We ran out of water shortly after the first checkup and had no help for miles. We were the only table in the center of the room. I had to stand up and fill our waters with the nearby pitcher and they didn't even notice. The divider walls are so tall I can see why it's easy to not see us but that should mean you need to put in more effort to attend to your tables. Also I worked in the service industry and know you are supposed to baby the crap out of customers when they're the only current source of business. The pizza was good though and we got free mini pizookie when we downloaded the free app."
Chase L.,"Norman, OK",54,4,,3.0,12/16/2017,"Great pizza and beer. Their Jeremiah Red is my favorite beer, sad it's not available anywhere. I know of at least one BJs in Texas where you can fill a growler of beer and take It home. Hopefully the laws change in Oklahoma soon. Went to this BJs last night with my fiancé. Had the thin pizza and some beers. Overall the food was great. We were sat right by the where the wait staff gathers to talk about what their tips were from each table, kind of uncomfortable. Also, our waitstaff seemed to rush us out.  Our chips and salsa appetizer was removed from the table before all our salsa was gone without asking us or offering More  chips. After we finished our pizza we were asked if we wanted dessert to which we said no. I was asked if i wanted another beer, my fiancé was not. When i got my 2nd beer, our ticket was closed without asking if we were finished. Only reason this gets 3 stars is for the Jeremiah Red and the good pizza."
Rick R.,"Norman, OK",0,32,,3.0,6/19/2017,"Went here for an employment celebration after   our group could not decide where to go.  Honestly, it was not my choice.  Went on a Friday night and only had to wait 15 minutes  before being seated.   The ambiance is very tasteful and my table enjoyed the array of cocktails on the menu.  We all shared a combination appetizer plate which was somewhat cold and loaded with buffalo wings but lacking on the other items.  We all ordered something different and most enjoyed their meal.  I ordered  the Fish n' chips which was only fair and overly priced.  The fish was not cooked through and the breading fell off.  Dessert was fun as well as after dinner drinks.  Our server was wonderful, helpful and very thoughtful.  As mentioned, this would not have been my choice, but most seemed like they enjoyed it.  For the price and quality  of the food I justify my score!"
Roy B.,"South Weber, UT",112,76,188,5.0,3/28/2017,"Not sure about all the negativity.  Been here several nights in a row now and none of what I've read has been true... I suspect some folks are on their damn phones too much or are just not happy folks. Zero complaints about the food, staff, environment etc.... all 5x5"
Ashley P.,"Norman, OK",142,91,182,2.0,1/14/2017,"My boyfriend and I have officially been turned off from any and all BJ's because of this location, Pizookie's or no. I received an email from them asking how my experience was when I ate there last, and let me tell you - I absolutely reamed them. Seriously, it was a rrreaaalllyyy long email.  Visit #1 - Went with friend and ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Omg people. I never spit food out. Ever. It's impolite, and isn't very attractive.  That being said, I took one bite of the chicken lettuce wrap and immediately (and unflatteringly) instinctively spit the food back out and began choking.  You want to talk about unnecessarily spicy? Yeah. That was it. I literally. *Literally* couldn't even eat the chicken part of the wrap because it was so flaming hot spicy.  I ended up just putting the dish to the side for the waitress to take.  The manager came over and apologized for the experience and offered to get me another item from the menu (I just opted to share a pizza with my friend) and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer.  Visit #2 & 3 - Went with boyfriend for a healthy dinner and ordered the sirloin steak with asparagus and a cup of clam chowder.  The clam chowder was ""meh,"" and came out cold. Not room temperature. Cold. As if someone had taken the soup out of the fridge and just dumped it in the bowl. Ew. We also didn't get any oyster crackers with them. :(  Now, I'm of the personal opinion that a steak and asparagus isn't exactly something that would be easy to screw up. *Buzzer* Wrong. The steak and asparagus were completely inedible. The spicyness and heat from the seasoning on the sirloin blew up my mouth and definitely irrigated my sinuses....sniffling, tears and all. The asparagus wasn't any better. They appeared to have thrown the asparagus onto a grill and then taken an entire bottle of ground pepper and poured it on top of the vegetable.  Needless to say, not only was it spicy as all heck, but the asparagus wasn't even cooked! It was still almost completely raw. At this point, I was too frustrated to call a manager. I didn't want to appear like one of *those* people who comes in and complains just to get free food, and my very long email to them went unanswered, so what's the point?  Not going back to this BJ's again. Maybe someday I'll work up the cajones and visit another location, but my lips can still feel the burn from that steak. Lips = traumatized."
Lauren K.,"Oklahoma City, OK",97,104,204,3.0,2/5/2017,"I had the salmon quinoa and had severe food envy for the whole dinner, This is not the place to go if you're hoping for a really good healthy option. However, their burgers and loaded salads looked pretty big! The beer selection is extensive, and the overall atmosphere is very relaxed although loud at times. Not my first choice, but also not a bad choice."
Tes H.,"Norman, OK",87,86,129,5.0,7/31/2016,"One of my favorite spots in Norman!  From happy hour to dinner dates with friends, I keep finding myself back here over and over again. The atmosphere is fun and classy, the hostesses are always so nice, and the wait staff is attentive.  You may wait a while on game nights; it IS a type of sports bar/grille, after all. But they do call ahead waiting 30mins or less before your arrival.  The drink menu is huge. The food menu has an even larger selection. This is a go-to restaurant for a crowd or if you're eating with someone picky.  Try a sangria!"
Iris L.,"Dallas, TX",179,227,382,5.0,12/26/2015,"Came here for lunch on Christmas Eve and overall was very pleased with the experience. We were greeted very promptly and pleasantly upon walking it.  We were also seated very quickly in a nice booth. I have to also mention how beautiful the floors were! Loved them. Our waiter was very nice. I ordered the strawberry lemonade which I sadly had to send back- something was off, seemed like too much syrup?  He gladly took it back and gave me a regular lemonade instead. He also checked up on us several times and kept refilling my fiancé's water glass. I ordered the mini deep dish extreme pepperoni pizza- AMAZING. And my fiancé got the burger and thin fries- also very good from what he said. Overall, clean and a great easy lunch. I would recommend stopping if driving through Norman."
Nita H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,21,,2.0,9/14/2017,"Oooo. No, go somewhere else. Chicken fettuccine tasted like Marie Callender's and Maria Callender's actually had more flavor. Best thing was the cookie desert with ice cream they serve. Go next door to Charleston......"
Brandee A.,"Rochester, MN",0,2,1,4.0,5/19/2017,This was a great place to grab lunch while in town to watch Softball.  They have lots of TV's and were willing to change the channels for us.  We had been to another BJ's location in California and had a great experience. thought we would give this one a try even though it wasn't rated very well.  Food was delicious and service good.  Would definitely come back again!
Michelle M.,"Norman, OK",46,8,,4.0,7/10/2017,Love this place. Quality food and service. Clean and relaxed atmosphere. Pizookies are fabulous!!
D R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",14,47,21,2.0,9/5/2016,"Food good but expensive, beer good but $19/pitcher. Service mostly terrible if sat by hostess, the bar area is actually better service. Overweight guy last night ignored us for 15 min until we got up and moved to the bar area. He never even looked up while hiding behind a corner where he pretended to type things into a computer for 10 min at a time. Saw him rudely rush all his tables out that night before close. Closing time is 11pm on Sat."
Haley B.,"Norman, OK",9,126,30,5.0,10/18/2016,"Pazookies. That is the key to life and why you should visit BJs. One of my favorite (and very ridiculous, but possibly least questionable) college memories is coming to BJs with my friends and ordering a table of Pazookies, then timing ourselves as we devoured the entire skillet. We were real savages. I still daydream about those pazookie eating challenges when I pass this restaurant. Alright that's enough, go see what this pazookie business is all about! You won't be sorry!"
Daniel S.,"Marion, IA",73,15,4,5.0,6/11/2017,"I have been to this location a couple of times. Once in the bar area, and once in the back area where my server was Ciera, who was very attentive and an amazing server! I had spaghetti once and ribs once. Both meals tasted very good, and the house beers were tasty. It was always busy, but the hostesses did get me in pretty quickly, so that's a plus. I'll certainly be back!"
Don R.,"Keller, TX",145,206,705,2.0,3/12/2016,"I love the décor at BJ's, but I find the food to be very pricey for what you get and on my recent visit to this location, I was really disappointed in the flavor of the Flatbread. I did really enjoy the flavor and uniqueness of the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts, but the Margherita Flatbread was definitely FLAT! I know there's very little in the way of toppings, but this had less flavor than a frozen school lunchroom pizza. It tells me how little it put into their base ingredients. I generally like the food better, but I just don't go very often because I don't want to pay $15 for a hit-or-miss entrée."
Christina F.,"Kansas City, MO",30,54,1,3.0,4/9/2017,"Coming in from out of town to visit my college daughter! Campus corner was packed on a weekend night so we came here. Ordered the calamari which was a bit expensive for what we    got...portion small and fairly bland, and a cracker thin pizza which was good but nothing spectacular. The menu is huge and the area clean and spacious. Would try again. It was OK but nothing to write home about."
Shawn H.,"Blanchard, OK",1,41,13,3.0,6/24/2016,"Pizza is good and beer is good but the rest of the menu feels very pre-prepared and seems to be made from average quality ingredients. Atmosphere is good, restaurant seems clean and well kept but definitely has a chain feel. Overall the waitstaff and bartenders are average. We come here quit a bit and the service is a little hit and miss.   Unfortunately and a big disappointment is that they do not allow take home beer (growlers) although many other brew pubs in Oklahoma do."
Chelsey V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",336,182,157,5.0,11/23/2014,"I will admit I have been to BJ's in the past and have not had very good experience. But at this location, I had an amazing experience. We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer (not on the menu) and stuffed mushrooms. The salsa is a fire roasted salsa which my husband loves. The mushrooms were different than other mushrooms I have had but they were still very good. I ordered a house salad and it was delicious. The presentation of the salad was very nice as well. For our entree we split the Mediterranean Pizza. We got a large and it was a lot of food for two. We ended up eating a quarter of the pizza. On a first bite I wasn't really sure if I liked it or not but by the end I was a fan. Great food, great atmosphere, great experience... Thanks BJ's... We will be back!"
Violet H.,"Norman, OK",278,8,,2.0,11/20/2016,This place is wildly overrated. I ordered and margherita pizza and they gave me a cheese pizza with what looked like Rotel.. I sent it back and all three of my other friends sent their food back as well because their orders were wrong (and one's chicken was completely burnt). Their pizookies are their only redeeming quality
Christina S.,"Norman, OK",34,16,2,5.0,11/20/2016,I have been several times.  And it is one of my favorite places to take friends when they are visiting from out of town.  The ambiance is very nice.  A little on the expensive side.  I wish the service was better... its good but not great.  The hostess is always cheery and bright.  The Asian Chopped Salad is pretty darn good.  The Cherry Chilpote Salmon is delicious and my favorite is the avocado egg rolls and rootbeer glazed ribs.  I'll even have those as my meal.  The margherta pizza is meh.   But the pazookie dessert is a must.  Save room even if you have to share it.
Bryan M.,"Austin, TX",54,30,,3.0,6/30/2016,The food is fantastic!  Very extensive and delicious selection. Pretty reasonable prices for all the food you get too. The same is true for their beer selection though the fancier stuff can get pricey. The only issue is their service. The wait staff is friendly and all.  They're just not that responsive sometimes. An empty water glass is pretty common around there.  They spend too much time talking to each other and not enough talking to their customers.
Nick N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",158,710,270,4.0,11/21/2014,"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Decor & Style: 5/5 The large space and good ambience is why I love this place. Great place to get a drink, and a large variety of American food. For awhile my favorite was the pizza but it's gone from a 5/5 to a 4/5 since it doesn't seem to be as flavorful as it was in the previous years.  Now I just go for the Turkey Club and any handcrafted beer. Excellent selection of beer. Great modern style and ambience. One of the regular places I go to (this goes for all BJ's across the metro)."
Johnny S.,"Tulsa, OK",31,266,2086,3.0,11/15/2014,"Game weekend reviews really shouldn't count but I needed to share this... They have a call ahead feature where you can call in and put your name on the list.. It's not a reservation but it puts you ahead of the walkins!  Okay so we did the call ahead... When we get there the hostess says 30 or 40 minutes. Bar is full, no place to sit down, they're slammed!  10 minutes later they call our name!  Food was good, Service was good, microbrews we're good. Very popular place with a diverse menu. I'd like to try them again on a non game weekend.., my guess is things would be a lot better!"
Rosa L.,"Carrollton, TX",0,23,,2.0,8/10/2015,"Want some over- priced nuked food? You'll get it here. We ordered a Caesar salad but they were out of Caesar salad dressing, That should have been a tip that the food here was not freshly prepared. We settled for the wedge instead. Ugh. Not sure what the basic dressing was on this salad but it was thin, kind of slimy sweet/tart white stuff with a couple bleu cheese sprinkles on it. The wedge was a very small piece of iceberg lettuce with some chopped tomato and hard, not crisp, bacon crumbled on it. Not good. Our shared entrée was a deep dish pizza. Sort of. Basically it was lukewarm dough served in a deep dish pizza pan. It was topped with meatballs which also tasted like dough so I'm thinking they must have a lot of bread in them, stringy mozzarella cheese, chunks of tomato that tasted like they were freshly plucked from a can and a smattering of tough hot white onions. We were starved so we ate the mess, waited and waited for refills on our drinks and got out of there fast.  Service was lackluster from our front desk greeter seater who was in love with his cell phone to the manager who brought out our lukewarm pizza. The server introduce herself or show up much after bringing our drinks. This place is just a definite ""just keep looking for something better"" kind of place. This was our first time at any of the BJ's locations so I can't say that they're all like this one. I sure hope that they aren't. And if they are I expect they'll be going the way of the dinosaur."
Kit J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",3,3,,2.0,7/19/2016,Ordered Brussels sprouts but they were burnt. Manager kindly took them off the bill.  Flat bread pizza was a step above Totinos.  I had the Chicken Alfredo. Lunch size was huge.  Pretty good. We also ordered a pet fly that loving stayed by us the entire meal
Chris C.,"Marietta, OK",7,79,27,5.0,3/21/2016,"Prices seamed a little high but it turned out the single serve pizzas were half price and we got a $10 off coupon on here so it was a super meal for a great price!  House IPA was Excellent, Pizzas were Awesome, Jalapeño burger was good and the pizza cookie things were perfect for the 3 of us with the sampler.   It was our first time here, but ""We'll be Back!"". :)"
Russell L.,"Santee, CA",0,10,2,5.0,4/7/2016,"Came in for lunch, the all you can eat soup and salad was amazing, you can refill either with a different soup or salad. Absolutely great, normal price $7.75. They offer a 50% discount to military, so after a 20%tip and tax my final bill was $6 for all you can eat. Dandy."
J Jason B.,"Atlanta, GA",121,89,12,4.0,8/20/2015,"BJ's is one of those places that I think about going to often but only get there about twice a year.  Maybe because I always prefer to not eat at a chain when I do go out, but as far as corporate places go in Nompton, BJ's is probably my fave.  And by the way, I feel stupid reviewing corporate places.  There's over 100 BJ's in this great nation and chances are you've been to one.  So if you haven't been to one, say you're new to America, or you've only just become old enough to eat out, or maybe you're 16 and you just got a license and before this your parents never took you out to eat.  Maybe you lived waaaaaay out in the country,,, anyway, if any of these conditions apply or you'd like to know more about this particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, by all means keep reading. I guess I'd describe BJ's as if Cheesecake Factory and Spaghetti Warehouse had a baby, which by the way- gross.  Cheesecake and spaghetti should never be imagined together like that.  BJ's lacks the baroque grandeur of Cheesecake Factory, but the plush seating and attentive, pleasant, well trained service put BJ's in a different league than Spaghetti Warehouse.  The menu is American cuisine, which is to say, pretty much Italian cuisine with a good number of dishes that aren't Italian.  Pizza, pasta, steak, chicken, potatoes, burgers... cookies.  Anyone can find something they like here (even vegetablists like myself.)  If not, ditch em.  Seriously.  Even my dad, who thinks that 5 cheese blend on a pizza is just a way of skimping on mozzarella, can find something he likes, (which was, not surprisingly, an all mozzarella pizza with sausage.) As far as decor, all the BJ's I've been to are nice, but I really like this one in Norman. The building was a Don Pablos for years and even though its essentially the same building, its nearly impossible to tell, what once was once a loud faux barrio is now cavernous, upscale, and fresh. BJ's is not cheap, its not expensive.  I'd say you get what you pay for, so if you're down for something nice I think BJ's is always worth the money.  That, I guess, is probably what keeps me from going there more often, that or the location.  Which reminds me, if you are new to Norman or are in the area on a business trip (unlikely) or perhaps are in town for one of our many (sarcastic) festivals, here's a good way to get to BJ's:  by helicopter.  BJ's sits on the finest lot in the most poorly planned business park ever.  Lets put all these businesses on a divided winding frontage road with no highway access and let's put an entrance at the apex of each blind corner.  Great going, city. BJ's also brews their own beer and has a full bar, its a great place to watch a game.  There's a good view of at least one television from (probably) every seat. Their signature dessert, the pizookie, is never as good in real life as it is in my head.  That said, I want one now."
Brian M.,"Tulsa, OK",6,12,3,2.0,4/17/2015,Pizza was decent.  Pasta was made with microwave Alfredo sauce. Spinach artichoke dip was also prepackaged and microwaved.   If you want a restaurant to microwave prepackaged food for you than this is your place.
Brandy W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",79,527,425,3.0,4/8/2013,"If Gordon Ramsey came here he would definitely reduce the number of items on the menu! Wow!!  We started with the fried Calamari which was really good.  It tasted good and was well breaded but was obviously pre-made quality.  I had a pizza and was pleased with the texture, cheese, and overall flavor.  I would come back again if in the area but was not impressed enough to choose it over other options when available.   There may be other incredible dishes on the menu but they became white noise at a point because there was so much to choose from.  We decided you could eat here every day and never exhaust the menu after a couple of years. Service was the main downfall for our party.  I went 10-15 minutes at times with an empty glass.  At one point, I asked the server to just bring two glasses of tea with her as she kept apologizing for being so slow.  The sad part is that the restaurant was not busy and she only appeared to have a few tables. Overall: It was good food. Good atmosphere. Super slow service."
Chelsea S.,"Widener, AR",27,4,,4.0,12/7/2014,"Visited BJ's after the Bedlam game in Norman and despite a packed house and long line of people waiting we were sat in about 30 min. Not bad at all considering the volume and we easily got a drink from the bar while we waited.  The restaurant was very large, clean, and had a variety of seating options. Our server did a great job! Our group of 4 was pretty vocal and he played right along with us joking and got everything on our order correct. The host who sat us was also very friendly and made us feel very comfortable, apologizing for the wait. All the staff we came in contact with from the bartender to the food runners were well put together, spoke clearly, and interacted with our table very well. As a customer service manager in the restaurant industry I take notice of this very quickly! We had 3 appetizers:  Thai Shrimp Lettuce wraps - mediocre, not a lot of flavor and the lettuce was way too large for the filling.  Ahi Poke - basically a rare ahi tuna tartare served with a nutty soy dipping sauce was very very good! It didn't last long and we thought about ordering another. Full of flavor and served at the perfect cool temperature.  Calamari - breading was tasty, didn't wow me but calamari is pretty standard to prepare. Served with 2 dipping sauces a spicy ranch and a barbecue something. Good portion for 4! We were all very pleased with our entrees, after spending awhile going through their extensive options. They literally have just about everything, pizzas, pasta, steak, burgers, soups, salads, chicken, and seafood.  We had: Lemon Chicken Pasta - angel hair pasta, with a creamy lemon, butter sauce served with 2 chicken breasts, steamed spinach, and artichoke hearts. Very good portion of food and full of flavor, not too heavy for a pasta dish.  Deep Dish Baked Lasagna - made with ricotta cheese, it was baked perfectly and full of fillings.  NY Strip - cooked to order, med-rare with 2 sides of choice: horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus  Ribeye - cooked to order, med-rare with the mash and broccoli  Overall, I recommend BJ's for all demographics from families to solo travelers. It has so much to offer even the pickiest eater should find something satisfying served at an affordable price range. We will be keeping an eye out for this chain from now on as we travel."
Clark W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,38,17,3.0,1/12/2015,"Multiple part review.  Craft beer- 5 stars. Even though pricey per pint the large spectrum of choices including the darker brews make them a winner. Love the porter and stout, I hope they expand their IPA brews. HopStorm IPA is great, but sells out sometimes.  Food- 4 stars. Large and ever changing menu. I can get pizza which isn't my wife's and daughters favorite while they can get seafood, steak or chicken. Our go to appetizer is potato skins. Their nachos and fish tacos have not been our favorites. The fish n chips, jambalaya and salmon are great.  Service- 2 stars. Large busy restaurant I get it, but we've done call ahead many times and it has been screwed up every time. The app reservation has been better so far. Once seated service has been hit and miss, just not consistent."
Joy M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",456,821,577,5.0,11/29/2012,"Two visits down and I'm happy with it all. We even sat at the same booth both visits, by chance of course. I always get the pizza and normally end it with a pazookie, but I'm trying to lose some LBS. Oklahoma has been kind to me, but not kind to my midsection! Anyhow, whoever trained the wait staff here trained them well. I didn't have to go a minute without an empty beverage. Our waiter was so good that I didn't even noticed that he dropped off a refill right next to my almost empty glass. Man, that's sneaky good! That is one of the main reason why I keep coming back to this place... The service! Ceasar salad isn't my favorite here, I feel like the dressing is too sweet."
Scott F.,"Norman, OK",12,3,,3.0,10/19/2014,"BJ's is a decent restaurant in Norman. They brew a decent beer and have a huge menu. The Buffalo burger is a great low calorie option there and their pizzas are also very good. The problem with having a large menu is that not everything is very good. My wife has an issue with the texture of their Parmesan chicken. The Ahi Poke appetizer is a little bland and the brew house burgers have come out consistently overcooked.  BJ's is not a bad place to eat if you are eating with a group of people with varying tastes, but I tend to stick with what I know they can cook properly."
