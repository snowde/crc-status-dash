Jennifer M.,"Norman, OK",41,1,,1.0,11/11/2015,"Just went to BJ's with 4 veterans and their families. We made reservations an hour in advance. Someone bullied the host into giving our table away, so we waited almost an hour for another set of tables that were again taken away. Are you kidding me?!!?! We told the manager we were leaving and he could care less. Thanks..."
Jen E.,"Velma, OK",0,45,3,3.0,11/22/2014,"BJ's food is quite good, with matching service.  We have tried many menu items from pizza to salmon.  All meals are well proportioned and served timely.   Our only complaint is the noise and warm temperature in any season."
Shawn G.,"Norman, OK",1,32,,4.0,6/22/2014,"I go to BJ's every so often and consider it ""in the rotation"" because the food and the service are almost always good. There's always a long wait on the weekends compared to other places because of this, but that can be avoided by using their curbside take away if you need food now. The dining experience is nice and is worth a wait if you find yourself here.  BJ's is a microbrewery and serves its own house brand of beers; they are quite good and you'll probably find one in the style you're looking for, but if you're not sure what you're looking at order their flight of beers and get a small sample of each one.  This is a great place to go and just hang out with friends or family because they have a huge assortment of appetizers, which I always find to match up well with any evening of extended drinking and chatting. Several years ago their Southwest Eggrolls pretty much set the bar for nouveau American appetizer food and were quickly copied by just about everyone.  Like several other posters have mentioned their pizzas are excellent. I usually build my own and am always really happy with it. I also recommend their chicken fried steak meal, it's also really good. If you're looking for something on the lighter side I have also enjoyed and recommend their balsamic chicken dish. For desert you really should try the pizookie - I don't really care for chocolate chip cookies myself but wow is theirs fantastic. They even have a gluten free version for folks avoiding wheat."
Foster J.,"Pocola, OK",16,2,,2.0,2/7/2015,My family and I was driving through and thought we would try BJ's needless to say we won't be back. The food was below average and priced as if it was first class.
Gloria R.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,24,2,1.0,4/22/2016,"My salad was quite delicious. My company, quite atrocious. Thanks for the try. The pizookies are so good."
Nick C.,"Archdale, NC",0,19,1,3.0,4/21/2014,"Came in about an hour before closing and the service reflected it.  Food was okay. I had the scallops and thyme chicken. The chicken was covered in some kind of sauce that had waayy too much lemon in it and it was doused all over the entire plate - which ended in my veggies and rice being ""lemonized"" as well.  Probably would opt for one of the various other restaurants in the area if I had the option again."
Hoss J.,"New Haven, MO",0,15,49,5.0,5/21/2015,Getting five stars before I get my dinner for serving me 5 minutes prior to close without any hassle. Goes a long way with me as it shows customer first.
Josh T.,"Independence Heights, Houston, TX",52,19,,4.0,3/25/2015,"Foods pretty good, lots to choose from, what you should expect from a chain. Four stars is because the BJ's brewed beer is pretty righteous !"
Jeff C.,"Norman, OK",7,173,19,4.0,12/12/2013,This place is clearly under rated. The beer selection is awesome and the wait staff knows their stuff. Had the Moroccan Salmon. Don't normally eat sea food in Oklahoma but this was excellent. And of course a pazookies are awesome. Likes it so much I joined the frequent diner program. See you there
Tony G.,"Mascoutah, IL",12,66,34,1.0,7/17/2014,"I put one star because I can't put none. Absolutely worst service ever. We left after half hour waiting on drinks. Who knows how much longer it took, but the waiter kept saying "" your drinks are right there, I'm getting them now"". Yeah needless to say we didn't wait around. It's a shame because I love BJ's, and have never had a bad experience until now. I'll never go to this one again. Be warned."
Justin G.,"Norman, OK",16,46,55,2.0,1/11/2013,"The pizza is very good, and their menu is relatively huge. So they've got that going for them. But beyond the pizza, the food is just average.  Lunch specials there are nicely priced,  but beware the astronomical prices on soft drinks!  That ""cheap"" lunch is pushing past $10 by the time you add a drink to the tab."
Patrick M.,"Norman, OK",0,47,1,3.0,1/14/2015,Food is good and mostly typical American cuisine. Casual atmosphere but can get pretty loud when it's busy. Clean. Good craft beers. Wait staff gets overwhelmed easily. Not sure they have received enough training. Had to chase our waiter down numerous times. They have no idea how to pre-bus a table or assist others sections.
Christine K.,"Denver, CO",40,54,9,3.0,12/4/2014,"Good food, not fantastic. It is similar across the country. A little loud but good for a large group like we had."
Stuart K.,"Saint Louis, MO",31,165,,3.0,12/11/2014,"OK  usually don't like chain restaurants, well because they are cookie cutters, and don't train their staff's well.   That is especially true in a college town with were high employee turnover shoulde be expected. BJ's is an exception except for one item.  I expect a Brewhouse that has a window looking at beer storage tanks to actually brew their product on site.  Not the case at BJ's as the brewing tanks are for show only. That said, their Blonde beer which is brewed in Houston by St. Arnold Beer (a tiny company with many different clever brews) is just plain super.  It was served cold and crisp and tastes great. Coming from St. Louis where Lasagna is a religion, BJ's did not meet that standard but was good.  My salad with blu cheese dressing not so much.  You should be able to recognize the taste of blu cheese and perhaps see a chunk or two of the tasty treat. The service was good, and the server very nice.  I would not travel 600 miles to go there, but it certainly was better than most in a college town."
DrFunkySauce ..,"Norman, OK",175,3,,5.0,1/9/2015,Our waiter Matthew was incandescent.  His vibrance alone was worth the trip. The meal was divine as well.
Josephine S.,"Norman, OK",135,90,139,3.0,4/18/2012,"Everyone has decided they want to go out to eat but no one can decide on what they want, so where do you go? Sometimes you strike a compromise, but sometimes BJ's is your best bet. The food can be a bit pricey, but the service is impeccable and they will make up for it tenfold if it isn't. The beer is always delicious. I love to do the seasonals, but the blonde and brunette are yummy, but then again, so are the rest of the brews. The flights are also a lot of fun to get so you can try them all for yourself and decide what you would like to have a full pint of. My favorite thing to eat there is their fish and chips, but their pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and salads are great too! For dessert they have all kinds of Pazookies (giant cookies topped with ice cream), like peanut butter, chocolate chip and at one point Oreo, that are great for sharing, but could be polished off alone. I won't judge you if you aren't into sharing desserts. Whether you are in a booth, at the bar or a table, the ambience is lively but not overly so and there is ample seating for a large group or a little spot a romantic duo can tuck away. Parking can be an issue around dinnertime on the weekends, as well as some weeknights so make sure you get there a little early and maybe even call ahead. Watch out for those big nights in Norman when parents are in visiting their kids or seeing them graduate - BJ's is a favorite and will be packed!"
Rachael P.,"Noble, OK",7,22,7,2.0,10/4/2014,"My bf and I were looking for a date night spot. This place was a shock on so many levels. It was dark, crowded (therefore incredibly noisy) and insanely expensive. The waiter was polite when we decided to go somewhere else. Plus, the menu was so large even if we could have afforded something there was WAY too many options to choose from. Won't be going back."
Niki S.,"Murphy, TX",31,208,,4.0,12/1/2012,"My boyfriend is convinced that a trip to this BJ's location is an integral part of his pre-game ritual for attending OU football games.  Now I see why!  We decided to skip the Sooner Tailgate before the OU vs OSU game and instead enjoyed a nice relaxing lunch at BJ's.   Sitting at the bar can be hit or miss, but I found the service to be excellent even though the place was pretty packed.  I am a sucker for BJ's Berry Cider- nice and crisp but definitely on the sweet side.  My sweety had the cajun pasta and I had the grilled chicken pasta.  Both came out nice and hot and each entree was more than enough to share.   Being able to watch games on the big screens in the heat was definitely a nice bonus.  I would suggest BJ's for a night out in Norman or as a part of a pre-game tradition."
Jeff M.,"Norman, OK",46,7,3,1.0,8/5/2014,"Wow! Mediocre food, terrible wait staff. Ordered the Jambalaya. Vegetables undercooked, shrimp ""fishy"" and someone in the back thought Cajun spices would mask the bad cooking. All of this with an empty water glass... Daughters steak dry beyond repair. Flatbread pizza good and chewy...NOT crispy. Very disappointed in first visit. Will not return. Looks like those that ordered liquor got better service. Better restaurants nearby, don't waste your time."
Juliette L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",275,335,181,4.0,5/14/2012,"This was my first time at this location and my bf's first time at a BJ's! There was a 25 minute wait when we arrived at around 8ish, but we only waited 10 minutes. I have to say the Norman location compared to the Memorial location seems more packed with more parents eating out with their babies or toddlers. It is very loud and I prefer the Memorial location due to the older crowd, but our food and service was excellent. My bf had the stuffed mushrooms and jambalaya and I had the gluten free pizza. Both of our entrees were delicious and cooked perfectly. He also had their popular beers, and I had a couple glasses of wine. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and will be coming back! I want to try their avocado eggrolls next and see how it compares to The Cheesecake Factory's avocado eggrolls."
