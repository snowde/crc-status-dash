Louie F.,"Norman, OK",2,35,1,2.0,11/12/2011,Too much stuff on the menu! Everything is over-priced. Food was just OK. $10 for a burger $10 for a BBQ beef sandwich Thankfully my brother paid for it but I felt so guilty that he had been ripped off that I offered to pay my share.
Nicole L.,"Ada, OK",10,8,13,5.0,8/1/2013,"The family loves this place!! Great service, very clean & well designed. We go here all the time when we are in Norman. I highly recommend the fish tacos & the avocado egg rolls."
Susan M.,"Warr Acres, OK",0,4,,2.0,4/17/2015,Stopped here after my daughters track meet at OU. Thought we'd try it since there's not one in Tulsa. Very disappointed. Spinach artichoke dip was thick and mucky. Chicken Alfredo was bland. Flatbread pizza was average. Nothing tasted freshly prepared. Definitely won't be back.
Nick D.,"Union City, CA",263,101,5,3.0,9/28/2010,"I can't say much about this locale that distinguishes it from other BJs I've been to.  The pizza was just fine (we had the BJ's Favorite), the baja spring rolls were just fine and the seasonal Oktoberfest beer was outstanding.  The Oktoberfest was kind of sweet and it put me off at first, but I really started to enjoy the flavor after the first few sips.  I highly recommend the Oktoberfest. To address the negative reviews, I didn't have a bad experience here.  I notice that people will post negative experiences more often than they will post positive ones.  For me, at BJs, you get what you pay for, the prices are a bit higher, the food quality is always slightly above average.   As for beer, there's no point ordering anything but one of their signature microbrew at BJs.  There are many other spots in town with beer specials (Sooner Legends has $2 domestics all the time), but BJs is known for their microbrews, so of course they are going to charge you a higher premium for ordering something that they don't make themselves.  And, honestly, their microbrews are good!  Find the one that fits your taste and try something new (or get the beer sampler and try them all). I was completely satisfied with my experience here, I came in knowing and expecting three star quality and that is exactly what I got plus the pleasure of a tasty seasonal beer in the Oktoberfest microbrew."
Casey P.,"Norman, OK",5,11,1,2.0,11/17/2010,"I really don't understand the obsession with this place. The menu is overwhelming and overpriced and when you finally do pick something it will be a while before you see it and it will just be OK. And that's after you've probably waited half an hour to get a table. The alcohol leaves a lot to be desired . The mixed drinks are expensive and watered down.  I like my wine and I'm easily impressed but the wine I've had here is just awful. Seriously, just have a beer.   Bottom line...  I've never had a bad time here but after leaving feeling kind of dissatisfied and a little broke more times than one I've just decided not to bother anymore."
Aaron S.,"Moore, OK",0,35,,2.0,7/13/2013,"I have been to BJ's several times as I tried to like it, but after the last few times I am convinced it is not worth the price.  Margarita I had was average and so was the food and service.  For the prices they charge it should be much better."
Stacey B.,"Norman, OK",12,36,1,3.0,2/25/2013,"This is a good place to go when everybody wants something different.  It has a little bit of everything.  The food is good and the service has been very good.  The food can be a little pricey, but the service is worth it.  Nice ambiance and (when I have been there) not full of college kids - no offense, but I am over that sometimes living in a college town!"
Chander G.,"Morrisville, NC",10,82,9,2.0,8/2/2010,"I used to be a BIG fan of BJ's - great beer, and awesome pizzas. However, after two times eating at this location in two years, I can't say I'm impressed - in fact, I'm downright disappointed. The pizza is now ""so-so"" - better than pizza hut, but not by a lot.  The BBQ chicken pizza I got tonite used a cheddar cheese blend, and just wasn't very good.  In the past, my experiences here were much better. Now, there are a few plusses - the wait staff is friendly, and tends to refill drinks pretty quick.  They have good happy hour specials (though they aren't particularly appetizing). All said, the service and beer gets this place 2 starts - probably would be more if that was all they had.  Unfortunately, their mediocre (a good way to say ""not so good"") food results in a poor score for BJ's Boo-hoo for BJ's. PS. Kathleen serviced me in an excellent manner.  No pun intended.  If you get her as a waitress, her favorite color is blue and her sign is aries."
Matthew Z.,"Ada, OK",2,42,,2.0,4/27/2013,They got everything on the order wrong over and over and over. The fired calamari was not crispy at all. It was like eating rubber rings in soggy fry batter.
Anne H.,"Medford, OR",39,115,13,4.0,10/8/2011,"We started with a decent beer. My husband had the nutty brunette (American version Newcastle brown ale). Excellent service, timely food delivery. We come here often and have yet to have a bad experience. We especially love the pizza, salad combo. Avoid the place like the plague on OU home game days...too crazy"
Kelley G.,"Norman, OK",21,20,,2.0,2/8/2010,"Okay food, but don't go if you don't want to drink their beer!  $5 in Norman, OK for a Bud Light bottle...crazy!"
Emma O.,"Noble, OK",0,5,,4.0,5/23/2011,Can you say Pizzookie and Pizza.  Both are very yummy at this place.  My friends and I go here just to share dessert.  My brother's were born in Chicago and we love to go here for the pizza as well.  Reminds us of the pizza up North!
Vena F.,"Pearland, TX",90,195,60,2.0,5/18/2009,"We frequent BJ's in the Greater Houston area pretty regularly, so i'm very familiar with the chain.  We were disappointed in the Norman location.  The evening we frequented was Mother's Day evening(well after the crowds of big group diners).  Everything we ordered came to our table COLD!  The only good thing about our experience was our server, Isaiah.  He was apologetic and insisted we report our complaints to the manager.  We declined and paid our check in full.   Maybe they were understaffed and could not recover from their earlier book of business?"
John F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",25,15,1,3.0,9/28/2010,I am always happy when I go to BJ's for pizza and dessert. When I have ordered any other food I've been disappointed. The Chicken Fried steak was sad to say the least and their pasta dishes lack substance. Check out Cafe 7 across the street on the west side of the mall. You will not forget it. BUT...BJ's pizza is awesome :)
Eric H.,"Lincoln, NE",9,29,,4.0,1/1/2009,Definitely one of the best restaurants in Norman. The menu is loaded with options and there are a fair amount of drinks available (by Oklahoma standards anyway). The atmosphere is great for most any occasion and is still family friendly. I imagine this place makes a slaying when the Sooners are slaying opponents on the field.
Jane D.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,1.0,3/29/2010,"I hate to leave this review but I feel I must because I recently had the worst dining experience in a very long time at this restaurant. Please keep in mind: this review is only for the NORMAN,OK BJ's. I have repeatedly dined at the BJ's in both Austin, TX and Addison, TX repeatedly and have never had a problem.  The Norman branch clearly has a problem with management and employee hiring/training. Friday afternoon, I recommended BJ's to my relatives that I was visiting in Norman. I now feel bad about that decision. I entered the restaurant with my husband, sister that I was visiting, and grandmother.  We had 2 different waitresses which was odd but okay. The first waitress was unfriendly when she took our drink orders (we politely ordered water because it was mid-afternoon and a family outing) . After that, she abandoned our table.  The second waitress that took over was perfect until the check came. She accidentally handed us someone else's check which should not have been a huge problem but she made it one. My elderly grandmother was treating us all to dinner and did not notice that the amount was different than expected, so she left $20 cash to cover the amount on the check and $10 for a tip. The waitress came back and picked up the check and snapped at us ""You didn't give us the right amount. I gave you the wrong check!"" I answered for my grandmother who seemed confused by her tone and said, ""No problem. What do we owe?""  The waitress must have been mentally slow, because she continued to repeat that we had the wrong check in a louder voice and then gave us the right check. Why would you argue and snap at a customer who just said your mistake was no problem?!?  Anyways, we immediately added more cash which still included a decent tip despite her rudeness because we assumed she was just having a bad day. After that, a very long period of time passed by (longer than we spent eating our food) and the waitress repeatedly passed the table without picking up the check. This is when we FINALLY lost our patience. I even waived at her once and she made eye contact. She only appeared to have 1 other table. Finally, after waiting longer, my husband went to the bar to break the extra cash so that we could leave her exact change with no tip and finally leave. There was no reason for this type of service. We ordered our food and drinks immediately, didn't even ask for anything extra, and just wanted to pay and leave. My husband and I run a business and would never treat customers this way. Now we have a horrible impression of both the residents of Norman, Oklahoma and the local branch of BJ's. Next time I see my sister and grandmother from Oklahoma, I will insist that they visit us in Austin, TX where people are properly trained, have common sense, and are polite to their customers. At least our BJ's is a pleasant place to visit."
Mandy B.,"Norman, OK",7,13,,4.0,4/2/2009,I love the atmosphere in this restaurant also the pizza is very good. I was also impressed with the service and the beer selection. You can get a pizza with pretty much whatever you want on it if you want to custom order or you can pick from their concoctions on the menu that are perfect combinations of ingredients. I wouldn't waste my time getting the cookie dessert though. It is not as good as you think it would be.
