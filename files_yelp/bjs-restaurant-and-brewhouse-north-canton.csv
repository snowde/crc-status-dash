Erica H.,"Canton, OH",1,9,,5.0,1/7/2018,"My husband and I love this place... if you go here you have to get their homemade rootbeer, deep dish pizza and top it off with one of their amazing pizookies! This place is delicious!!"
Ashley M.,"Cleveland, OH",235,348,782,2.0,3/16/2017,"The service was okay. But, the food was terrible!  I was at the N. Olmsted location last week and got the same thing and it was delicious. When I ordered the Ahi tuna salad today. The greens were starting to go bad and it was literally smothered in dressing.  I seriously couldn't eat it. BUT, was still charged for it and left hungry.  The monkey bread thing was good. A bit over cooked as we couldn't get it off the pan.  Our server was a bit..... I hate to use the word annoying, but she was. We're trying to carry a conversation and my friend literally had to shoo her away, then she rushed us with the bill. Very poor everything. Even the bathrooms were a mess. I'm glad I live in Cleveland and was only out that way to have lunch with a friend.  I won't be returning."
Hannah R.,"Austin, TX",32,1,2,4.0,9/24/2017,"Got a great Hickory Brisket Burger cooked medium which was excellent! It has come melted cheddar cheese and bbq brisket. Started with chips and ""queso"" . Just yellow american cheese dip with a little pico. Chips and salsa was spicy but delish. The dessert was the Pizookie trio and it was amazing! Got the monkey bread, salted caramel, & churros. Service was excellent as well and our server Michael was very attentive."
William C.,"Canton, OH",4,96,,3.0,8/17/2017,"Had dinner with a group of friends.  The wait staff was good and reasonably attentive.  But, 5.95 for a draft beer?  Really?  And the waitress asked how we wanted our burgers cooked, but they were so thin that there was no way you could make something ""medium"" as opposed to ""medium well"". A joke.  And I would again comment that the menu is waaay too ambitious. Pare it down and do what is left well. That is the formula for a good kitchen."
Sarah K.,"North Canton, OH",16,228,36,3.0,3/15/2017,"Food is good! And the pizookies (did I spell that right?) are absolutely heavenly. Also dearest waitress I had the last time, I'm sorry we only got one dessert to share and drank nothing but water, but we had just eaten elsewhere and I was raving about the desserts so we had to stop by. Also I sincerely didn't know that pizookies were half price that day.  Anyway, always a good time here, even if the waitress is visibly pissed about the dessert and water choices."
Reidar C.,"North Canton, OH",12,13,2,4.0,10/30/2017,"As a restaurant in this market it's hard to distinguish yourself from the crowd. There are many options but I really liked the Bison burger as it is traditionally not as fattening as other options. However, I probably won't go back as there are many other options in the area."
Angela K.,"North Canton, OH",0,6,1,5.0,11/13/2017,"Love this place for dinner, they have such a huge menu with a great variety. And we'll let's not mention how amazing the pizookies are! Just tried the snickerdoodle one and it was amazing! Highly recommend going and tying it for lunch or dinner. The atmosphere is great and very welcoming!"
Mark M.,"Akron, OH",26,87,10,4.0,10/23/2017,We did not eat here but sat at the bar before heading out to Wasabi. The beers were fabulous! We started with a flight and ordered a couple pints of their stout. Simply wonderful. The bar tender was knowledgeable and friendly.
Justin V.,"Sylvania, OH",50,25,14,5.0,7/29/2017,I didn't initially visit BJs because of the average rating on yelp. I was very impressed by the section and drinks. The flatbreads were delicious! The staff was as friendly and environment was clean.
Alex S.,"North Canton, OH",63,14,1,4.0,10/2/2017,"Very unique menu, lots of alcohol to choose from. They are usually busy, which means you wait a long time before you eat. Service is either hit or miss. I've had servers that really upset me there, and also some really great hard workers"
Paul J.,"Canton, OH",0,37,,4.0,9/17/2017,"With an absolutely enormous menu, I was skeptical that everything could be good. I was wrong. I have yet to order something I didn't like. Plus, pizookie."" Nuff said."
Christina S.,"Indian Shores, FL",52,17,4,1.0,7/5/2017,"Just awful. Cold food. Long wait. Never refilled our drinks. Freezing environment. Will NOT return. When the waiter WAS at our table, he was polite & friendly."
Kaitlyn B.,"Hartville, OH",62,20,1,2.0,11/12/2017,"Came here in the evening and the place was pretty empty, we were seated immediately. Our server was incredibly nice but the service took forever. We waited 10 minutes to order our drinks, then 10 minutes for her to bring the drinks, she finally brings them and we're about to order our food and she says ""i'll be right back to take your order in a moment!"" 10 minutes later, she came back. It was just so slow, and I typically don't complain but it took so long to finally get our food. When the food finally came, it was not good. The cheese on my burger was melted but also cold, like it had been sitting for a while. Then when i started eating my burger, it LITERALLY dripped a yellow puddle of grease onto my plate and had very little flavor. At $13 a burger, it disappointed me to leave over half of it uneaten. I don't think I want to come back here."
Tracey H.,"Canton, OH",2,10,3,4.0,1/5/2017,"We had a delicious dinner here on Sunday afternoon.  Initially, we were concerned about getting a table - because although I could see empty (and uncleared) tables, we were told the wait was 30-40 mins.  I looked around the waiting area, and counted six parties waiting.  That didn't add up.  I asked the hostess about sitting on the bar area, and she indicated it was first come, first served.  We walked around the bar area, and noticed an empty but again uncleared both, and a large dirty table that was actually two 4-tops pushed together.  My dining companions and I pulled the tables apart, stacked the dirty dishes, glasses, and napkins onto one of the tables and took our seats at the now-cleared table.  Dirty looks from everyone waiting in the lobby could be felt.  Hey - you could have cleaned your own table too... All of the above is why there are 4 stars instead of 5.   Once we got the table wiped off, and a server assigned, our visit became much better.  Our server Rose was the highlight of our experience.  She single-handedly saved this review from being a disappointed rant.  She was so friendly, attentive and pleasant that we all commented that any of us would hire her if we ever had a job for her. B.J.'s - please hire dependable busboys, and staff up for the Monday after a holiday weekend.  You've got great food - but if your lobby looks full and we see dirty tables, we're not going to stick around."
Ron L.,"Canton, OH",8,31,,4.0,8/21/2017,"We like BJs for the creative and varied menu.  The prices are a little high and the drinks a little weak, but the food is good."
Emily L.,"Columbus, OH",2,19,6,2.0,4/27/2017,"The food is excellent, Pazooki's are my favorite!! But our service was absolutely miserable and I would avoid Rachel as a server at all costs. She took more than 20 minutes to even notice that we were empty on water so we asked another waitress for help ordering dessert and getting refills...then she swooped in and tried to take credit after literally avoiding us for half our time here. She also asked us how to split the checks before our food had even gotten to our table and didn't look at us once, was legitimately staring at her tablet the whole time! And she didn't even introduce herself, I had to eavesdrop on a conversation to find out her name. Will not return to this location, simply due to the service alone. Not a happy customer, but the pazookis are delicious."
Mel B.,"Baltimore, MD",38,176,117,4.0,3/24/2016,"Visiting friends and fam in OH and we decided to give this place a go. We went on a Saturday night without reservations which was a mistake because this place was hoppin. This was my first time to a BJs and found it hard to believe it was a chain because of the huge draft list and the overwhelmingly large menu. We went to snag some drinks and ended up scoring a table in the bar section (1st come, 1st serve), so I was already a happy camper. Strawberry mojito in my hand (delicious, btw) and a huge menu in front of my face. I really could have gone wild here with all of the beers on tap. I love an extensive beer selection and trying new brews, but for some reason I was feeling the umbrella drinks and so were my compadres. All of the drinks were spectacular and even though I did not have a beer, I SO appreciated the selection. We decided to get a lot of apps and split them between the four of us. We ended up going with the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts, Sriracha Queso Dip, Old Country Tomato Basil tavern cut pizza, and Root Beer Glazed Wings. Here is how I would rank them: #1- Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts- great sauce, cooked perfectly. Wish I could have eaten the whole basket myself! #2- Root Beer Glazed Wings- such an interesting flavor that worked really well on the perfectly fried wings. Even though this was my #2, I would have to say if the table were voting, this would be #1.  #3- Old Country Tomato Basil tavern cut pizza- meh. It was fine. I was expecting it to be a little cheesier or maybe have a little more...sass? #4- Sriracha Queso Dip- honestly, felt like this could have been a micro cheese dip from the grocery store and I could say the same about the chips. Thumbs down.  NOW the star of the meal??? PIZOOKIES! Yes. Oh yes. Give me pizookies or give me death. We did the pick 3 and had the Monkey Bread Pizookie, Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie, and the Triple Chocolate Pizookie. The best was definitely the Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie...oh me oh my...that cookies and cream whipped cream changed my life!  Service was excellent and I liked the vibe a lot. Will definitely return (with a reservation)!"
Alissa S.,"Menahga, MN",2,14,3,4.0,6/5/2017,They have some really great food. The pulled pork sandwich was amazing and they even have good gluten free buns (for as good as a gluten bun can be). Burgers and pizzas are great as well. Eating here can add up quick however.
Lisa T.,"Huntington, WV",81,23,1,4.0,10/29/2016,"Were out of towners, enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I had baked ziti, it was ok.  Probably wont order it again. I had the pulled pork at a BJ in Florida and it was great!"
Shawn L.,"Cambridge, OH",1,9,4,3.0,12/14/2016,"Pretty cool atmosphere. The decor is warm and inviting. We went about 4:30 on a Tuesday evening, so it was not crowded. Service was good and friendly. I love craft beer, so I ordered a flight of four. The IPA, pale ale, red ale, and brown ale. All were pretty average. Not great, but not bad either. I ordered the blackened ahi, which had a pretty good flavor. The relish was especially good. All of my food, however, was only lukewarm, and again pretty average. I might eat there again, but I won't go out of my way to do so."
Debbie H.,"Massillon, OH",2,14,,2.0,8/16/2016,"To start with, the tables are too crowded. It made for an uncomfortable dinner for pretty much everyone in the place...especially the wait staff.  The pizza was cold and dry. The Jambalaya was just OK...tasty, but thick, cold and not your typical Jambalaya. The burgers were way over cooked when ordered medium.  Pretty pricey for the quality of food. More like a tourist trap type place vs local hang out. Good beer of course and I'm sure that's what they depend on. We wont' be going back."
Pamela D.,"Richwood, OH",0,25,12,5.0,4/7/2017,Ordered for carry out. The food was ready faster than I expected. I needed gluten free options and they have quite a few. I went with the gluten free pizza with the Buffalo Chicken toppings. It was delicious. My daughter ordered cheese sticks. I've never seen so many cheese sticks in one order. Very generous.
Justin L.,"Cleveland, OH",8,209,21,2.0,10/3/2016,The place was ok the food was not that great i ordered a portabella burger i was the last of my party to receive my meal after waiting 20 minutes. The bathrooms were ok The one thing that management did not care about was how the employees and the customer could not wash their hands because the sink was broken or the water did not turn on.      The Burger was alright if your hungry and you get the same thing as me make sure you order a side salad because they don't give you much as far as burgers go other then a few fries.
Corella D.,"Navarre, OH",0,31,14,5.0,5/8/2017,"Everything I've had here has been excellent. I love the deep dish pizza. The mahi-mahi and couscous is wonderful. Pizzookies are fun to share. If you watch they have good coupons also. I wish the pizza was cheaper, but they do have a special on those on Mondays."
Christian M.,"Cleveland, OH",56,29,90,4.0,3/3/2016,"I went at lunch time around 12:45.  There was no wait and service was very friendly.  Being that it was lunch I ordered one of four house made caffeine free sodas, root beer.  It was delicious and the glass was chilled do I ended up with root beer slush as ice in my drink.  I ordered the crispy potato skins as an app and the cherry glazed salmon as my lunch.   This is how they went from 5 stars to 4.  Both dishes came out at the same time.  I had to decide if I wanted to eat cold fish or cold skins.  The waitress apologized, but cold food or food held in a warmer isn't good.  I let the skins sit and as they chilled so did the cheese on them.   They were ok, but not good enough for me to order them again.  The salmon however, I would make this place a regular stop for that salmon!  It was moist, the asparagus was cooked just right, and the bed of couscous it was on tasted like perfect pillows of lemony goodness.  It was beyond amazing. I would go here again. P.s. you can get deserts in mini shot sizes."
Jaime S.,"Akron, OH",0,19,9,1.0,5/2/2016,"Spent 20 min waiting for someone to take our drinks. Told the lady who seated us. She said. Go sit down someone will get with you."" She did not move from her spot and did not tell anyone while we were standing there with her.   We walked next door and eat a very good hamburger at red Robin."
Casey W.,"North Canton, OH",191,49,,5.0,10/22/2016,This place has yet to disappoint me! I have been to the one on canton and the one in Las Vegas. Always fantastic food and great service.
Bryan M.,"Canton, OH",211,578,63,3.0,5/24/2016,Not too shabby... HUGE menu... i got the brisket buger.. it was decent but way too much sauce. I ordered a salad to with some sort of siracha vinergarette which was excellent. The service is pretty slow sitting here giving this review while the server is talking to coworkers for the past 10 minutes and its 230pm so its kinda dead
Daniel B.,"Uniontown, OH",27,382,58,3.0,10/28/2016,"Average burgers but plenty of choices on the menu. Friendly server (Michelle). Large selection on the menu for a beer pub/sports bar. Although average in taste and price, they are HUGE burgers! Bring your appetite or be prepared to take home half. Not as noisy as most sports bars either. THere are lots of places like this in the area so there are other choices. All are about the same."
Justin L.,"Canton, OH",0,9,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Horrible. Table of 8. Cold food, kid's food was late and missing a side. 3 adults had wrong food and/or missing sides. Fries were good, brisket burger was average. Waitress rolled her eyes when we said we had a coupon. Worst restaurant in Canton, and that's saying something."
Claire M.,"Akron, OH",0,3,,2.0,11/12/2016,"Service is fine and there are tons of beer & food options, but bigger isn't always better.  I find everything here to be average & it's not worth returning when there are much better spots nearby!"
Pete U.,"Massillon, OH",29,12,13,4.0,6/20/2016,"Came for a late brunch on a weekend, was seated immediately. Inside is very clean and there's plenty to look at as well as flatscreens on every wall. The food was excellent and decently priced. One of the most extensive menus I've seen. Beer selection is enormous with their own that they brew to choose from. Fast and friendly service. I'll be back!"
Brooke A.,"New York, NY",4,7,,2.0,12/26/2015,"I convinced my sister and brother-in-law to come here after I'd had so many delicious meals at BJ's during the years I lived in Arizona. Unfortunately, this location left a lot to be desired. We ordered an appetizer and beers which were delicious, but took a while to come, but that was nothing compared to our entrees.  The kids' macaroni and cheese came after about 35-40 minutes (still well ahead of our other entrees) and was lukewarm, but served on extremely hot plates.  Next, our server let us know that my burger was the reason for the wait. It wasn't a special order or anything. I've never heard of a burger causing a backup in the kitchen...  My sister and brother-in-law ordered another beer. By this time, the kids were done eating. My brother-in-law's deep dish buffalo pizza came out cold, followed by my sister's flatbread (which she said was really good). About 10 minutes later, their second round of beers came out, and then eventually, my burger.  A manager came by and apologized and took off the price of...wait for it...the children's ice cream sundaes. A whole $3. At this point, we were laughing it off, but really it was quite ridiculous. I don't think we'll be back for a long time, if at all."
Amanda G.,"Nashville, TN",57,76,56,2.0,11/12/2015,"I wish I could give this place more stars. We generally try to avoid the chain restaurants, but this food was actually pretty good. We really enjoyed the burger, and pizzas we got.  Unfortunately, the service was terrible. We ordered a queso appetizer that came out cold... intolerable cold. We asked if they could heat it up, and it still came back less-than warm, but as long as it took to get our waitress's attention we just dealt with it this time. Our drink orders came to us wrong multiple times. My boyfriend asked for fries with his burger, and did not get them. She finally brought them out after we had all finished our entire meals. It was just an incredibly long wait to receive anything we asked for. I don't think we will be back, unfortunately."
Jeff W.,"North Canton, OH",20,1,,1.0,7/26/2016,"Usually an easy going customer, but food was tasteless. Hamburger (hard to mess up) had no taste. Had a fish, shrimp stew which literally had two shrimp and NO taste.  Will NEVER go back."
Andi C.,"North Canton, OH",48,84,8,4.0,11/24/2015,"I wish people would give a restaurant longer than a month before they reviewed new restaurants.  I've been to the BJ's in Columbus and was a big fan.  I have to say the North Canton location didn't disappoint.  We came in last night (Monday) and there was a short wait, so we decided to eat at the bar.  Let me say that they hired some of the best bartenders.  Those guys were working hard behind that bar, but made sure you had everything you needed.  We had excellent service.  The bar area is a great atmosphere and a great place to watch a game.   We were promptly greeted, given an explanation of any beer we had questions about, and he made sure we were satisfied with our beer selection.  We had the spring rolls for an appetizer that were delicious, a little kick to them.  For dinner I had the cherry glazed salmon over asparagus and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  He had the jambalaya which is one of his favorite meals.  He described it as ""different"" than what he has homemade, but he liked it a lot.  There were several thins on the menu we wanted to try.  I liked the ""light"" options.   The beer list is diverse and plentiful with many local breweries as well as BJ's own brews.  I had one of each. The BJ brew I had was the berry cider and I absolutely loved it.  Very light and refreshing.   We will definitely be back, however, if you go with the intent on drinking and eating, it is quite expensive.   Maybe a once in awhile type place for us. Definitely give this place a try."
Scott H.,"Navarre, OH",79,81,106,5.0,10/6/2015,After trying one of their California  locations we were very excited to see a BJ'S  coming to Canton. Their menu has a ton of variety. They put their own twist on some menu items to give it some variety. Also a great place for anyone looking for Gluten free items!
Angie M.,"Uniontown, OH",19,3,,4.0,10/24/2015,"Good food but frustrating dining experience due to seating process. Our party of 4 visited on a Thursday night around 5:15. They have an app which you use for waitlist seating. We checked in on the app at 5:15 which said no wait. Arrived at the hostess desk at 5:20 to be told app not working 30 to 40 minute wait. We waited for 50 minutes and checked our spot in the seating only to be told hostess never actually ""hit the right button to check us in"" We were finally seated by 6:05! Asked to speak to manager but he was apparently to busy!! Overall food is good but in my opinion a bit overpriced. We had burgers, fries and one drink each for a party of 4 this was over $100 with tip. Add that to the frustrating seating and not sure how soon we will return! Since posting this review I have been contacted by management and have decided to give them another try!"
Aaron B.,"North Canton, OH",5,64,45,3.0,10/26/2015,"Just as solid as any BJ's I've been to yet. Good food, good drinks and good service. It's a great place to take the family for dinner, a date night, or just having a drink with a friend."
Brandon T.,"Akron, OH",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2016,"Update... Last night at 11:00 pm I threw up and was unable to eat anything the day after. I personally believe it was food poisoning because I had a disgusting meal and ""coincidentally""  got sick for the first time in 8 years. Not ever coming back even if it were free.  Will be informing friends and family about my horrible experience."
