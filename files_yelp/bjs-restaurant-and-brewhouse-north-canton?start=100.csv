Maureen G.,"Uniontown, OH",0,1,,2.0,11/4/2015,Still working out the kinks with kitchen and service. Very slow and not overly busy. Soup was like warm and main order was wrong. I'm sure they will improve with experience. Waiter was very nice and polite.
Tracy L.,"North Canton, OH",0,1,,2.0,10/24/2015,"Very long wait.  Food ok had the chicken taco.  The staff was carrying on unprofessional,  (talking to one another more attention to each other than the customer).  Too many other great places in the area.  Not sure I'll ever go there again."
Rachel M.,"Uniontown, OH",0,1,,2.0,11/6/2015,"Food was good, service was HORRIBLE! We arrived after using the app to get on the wait list and were seated almost immediately even though it was a busy Friday night. The waitress came quickly and we placed our drink order and food order. Then we waited, my salad came but still no drinks and we had only ordered a Pepsi and water. Then our food came and we still had not received our drinks. Finally our waitress checked back and we got our drinks half way through our pizza. While halfway through our pizza, our appetizer finally arrived, extremely late. Then when we were done and our waitress checked back and then we waited 30 minutes for our bill, the waitress was no where to be seen. Then when we finally got our bill we had to wait another 10 minutes for a box, meanwhile the waitress was rude and not the least bit apologetic about our long wait. While the food was delicious this was an extremely frustrating dining experiance."
