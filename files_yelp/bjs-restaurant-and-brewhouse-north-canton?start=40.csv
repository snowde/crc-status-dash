Megan Y.,"Jackson Township, OH",53,3,,5.0,9/23/2016,"Our server, Jonathan T, was phenomenal. He was energetic and attentive. We were told it'd be a 20-25 minute wait, which is of course understandable being a Friday night. We were sat after about ten minutes however. All of the food ordered was as enjoyable as the vibrant atmosphere within the restaurant. It was my first time eating there & I would definitely come again."
Mike S.,"Canton, OH",0,12,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Food is flavorless and stupid expensive.  My wife and 6 year old son went for lunch. Got a burger, tacos and a kids meal. A coke, juice and iced tea and the bill was 42$.  Service is okay nothing special food was cold and only got one refill.  Definitely not worth the money."
Katie H.,"Lakewood, OH",0,2,,5.0,5/8/2016,By far my favorite restaurant to date. Not only is food delicious but the array of craft beers makes me feel like a kid in a candy store. I love my dark porters. The staff went above and beyond to find the right beer for me with not only samples but detailed explanations of tastes. Management was equally as awesome. Was checked on twice and each time I continued to rant about there location. Bravo BJ's. I will be sending all my friends your way.
Gretchen B.,"North Canton, OH",64,149,472,4.0,3/28/2016,I think we've been here half a dozen times and the food is always good here.   Beer selection is great too.  Not sure what happened this time around with the service though.  Easter Day late afternoon and the place was barely busy but we waited what seemed like forever.
Eric T.,"Massillon, OH",0,11,,3.0,7/30/2016,"I just had lunch there a bit ago. For a Saturday afternoon it was busy, but not busy enough that one should have to wait fifteen minutes just to get a drink and/or refill. But that was the case. Poor service all around. My group and I were waited on by three different waiters. What didn't make sense was the fact that we had so many people waiting on us and yet we waited awhile on the drinks. Food was solid, but nothing to write home about. The domestic draft I bought was overpriced. The beer selection is a selling point here, according to what I've heard from others, but be prepared to pay through the nose for it."
Angelica M.,"North Canton, OH",0,4,,4.0,1/25/2017,They have the best pizookie. It's a very nice environment. Try out there salsa and chips.
Lois S.,"Canton, OH",11,7,,2.0,1/14/2017,"We went to BJ's on a Friday around 5pm during their so-called ""happy hour"".  Drinks were $1-$2 off of $8-10 drinks, not even top shelf booze - not so happy! I ordered the jambalaya which was delicious but my husband ordered the shrimp asparagus pasta & unfortunately had hardly any asparagus in it & not a single tip!  The service was great but I doubt we'll be back, it's WAY too overpriced for what you get! No salad - no bread - NOTHING EXTRA INCLUDED in the meal."
Brian S.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,16,,2.0,10/12/2016,"Had lunch here today. Not the first time (3rd I believe), but felt the need to comment. A group from work pre-ordered, but again when we arrived the staff seemed to have no idea what was going on. We preorder because though our lunch time isn't defined, we're recommended 30-45 minutes. I am certain if you preorder they do not prepare ahead of time. The salads and soup arrived within 10 minutes but the hot food still took 20... And when my blue cheese dressing was omitted, after I requested it our waitress asked 'Is everyone else happy with their meal?' Good selection, but customer service is garbage here (and I have worked food service so it is likely worse than garbage)."
Joe P.,"Massillon, OH",5,25,2,2.0,2/20/2016,American food with outrageous prices for a chain restaurant. I guess they think it is high end bar food but again it is a chain? I got the regular BJ Brewhouse Burger because I refused to pay 12 dollars plus for the other signature burgers. The burger was pretty good and I liked the bun it came on but they serve shoestring fries. Really? Terrible. I don't know any other restaurants to stay in business that served shoestring fries. The rest of the menu was way overpriced. 14 dollars for a flat bread pizza? No thanks.
Alex L.,"North Canton, OH",0,10,,3.0,7/1/2016,"Seems like a typical ""corporate"" restaurant. The beer selection is good, but the food is all over the place. First visit I got the beef dip sandwich which was great! My second visit I got a soup special in a bread bowl. I think it had about 2 tablespoons of soup in a pound of bread. It was tasty but the portion size was disappointing. Third visit we got a pizza and that was the kicker. Burnt with almost no sauce. I hope they can turn it around because it has potential."
Jamie L.,"Akron, OH",0,4,,2.0,3/4/2017,"The only reason I give this terrible place 2 stars is because the sweet tea was good and because they did give out small slices of pizza to the full lobby of disgruntled customers. Other than that, the mediocre food and terrible service is not worth the wait. For starters, they lost our call head seating ""reservation."" They bumped us to the head of the line which was still a 30 min wait, which is great considering it was a Saturday night. The revolving door is nice because it keeps it warmer than having the door open constantly while you're waiting, but I kept getting clobbered by people who don't know how to use it. So we finally got seated and ordered. They forgot my mom's drink and offered to take it off the bill. Well, yes, since it never came, please don't make us pay for it. The food was about Applebee's quality. Processed chicken, frozen pasta, a pathetic flatbread cardboard pizza and an ordinary burger with a bunch of junk on it. Should have walked away when all the other disgruntled patrons did."
K C P.,"Massillon, OH",0,17,,3.0,11/15/2015,"I read Yelp reviews after making plans to visit BJ's for noon lunch today.  I am pleased to say that service was prompt and provided with a smile.  The size of the menu is overwhelming.  Eventually this party of two, women of grandmotherly age, made their selections:  Santa Fe Salad, specially requesting iceberg lettuce only.  The other order, the chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. Appraisal:  The salad, a finely chopped mound at least 6 inches high, was served in a bowl.  (Sorry no picture!)   Our server provided a box for the leftovers which overflowed slightly.  No disappointment with quality or quantity!  Enough for two more meals went home. The quinoa bowl was tasty, prepared with a mild spicy rub but was much too salty.  Ordinarily I would have taken leftovers home, but not this time.  If I were to order again, I would make a point of asking for less salt. We were encouraged to take our time through lunch, and each time we thanked our server for her attention, were repeatedly told, ""My pleasure.""   When our bills arrived, I questioned why I was charged for dinner at noon.  ($9.95 v $13.50)  Our server said she thought that was what I wanted. (I believe this item was listed on the Lunch page of the menu -- page 12.)   She did not offer to adjust the price.   Had the manager visited our table during our visit, I would have commented on the saltiness of my dish.  I would also have sought him/her out regarding my bill.  As it was, I didn't need to bring home leftovers, and I will be sure to specify in the future which portion size I am ordering. There are other items on the menu that I was interested in and, for that reason, I am not opposed to visiting again.  But neither am I in any hurry.  There are a number of excellent restaurants in the immediate area of the new BJ's and the issues I had at BJ's have not been a problem elsewhere."
Kraig M.,"Louisville, OH",0,10,,5.0,3/17/2016,Wow... What a great experience... Don't know which one of their craft beers you would like?  Just ask or get the sampler! Try the ribs!!! Service was great... Everyone was smiling! If you are looking for a great place to hang with some friends or a date night it wasn't to loud but still had that sports bar feel...I'm not a big chain restaurant kind of person but I was extremely surprised with the hometown feel... Great Job BJ's!
Heather H.,"Sturgis, SD",48,3,,1.0,12/31/2015,"I've been a part of opening new chain restaurants and I can't believe my experience last night. The server was just the worst. Not only did she tell us a play by play of every thought she had, she told us that she would be avoiding our table because I ordered something with blue cheese on it, which she was allergic to. I got the wrong beer, not once, but twice, and it was the same beer both times. Then our pizza was lacking an additional topping that we ordered. The server took it back to the kitchen and they threw some jalapeños on it and at that point, the pizza was cold. I realize that BJ's is new to this area, but it's a chain restaurant that provides training for its staff and usually a team of company employees for the first month. It shouldn't have been that bumpy."
R A.,"Uniontown, OH",0,8,,1.0,12/31/2015,"Not good food, seemed to be PRE -prepared frozen Yuk! No quality. The pizza was cold, seemed to be frozen and the bone of the wings were cold noooo way will we be returning! Staff replaced cold food, but yuk I want Fresh Quality food! Rhonda A"
Jill R.,"Cleveland, OH",0,3,,1.0,1/2/2016,Call ahead seating is a joke. We're told to get there in 30 minutes and they would seat us.  After arriving we were told it would be another 20 minutes. After 25 minutes they told us it would be another 15.  After 20 more I demanded to be seated.   Server spilt beer on my husbands phone. When I tried to explain all that had gone wrong so far the manager said they were having a hard night because they had lots of tables that were very angry that night.  So far not impressed and wouldn't come again.
Dustin F.,"Salem, OH",0,4,,3.0,3/25/2016,"The food was pretty good, but the service wasn't. We noticed people around us were getting poor service as well. I would come back again but definitely won't be rushing back anytime soon."
Brittany B.,"Canton, OH",74,4,,3.0,5/1/2016,I am only going to give it 3 stars... The food was fantastic! But the 2 hour wait was a bit ridiculous... We had a party of 10 they do not take reservations for any party more the 6... Which boggles my mind... The manager Friday night told us that we wouldn't need to be there more the 30 to 45 mins before ... So we went earlier like we were told and the. They tell us 2 houses. They only have a like 2 tables for bigger parties. The service was great the food came out fast and right! I def recommend it in you have all night to be there and don't have kids bc the wait it awful.
Shannon C.,"Chicago, IL",35,22,10,5.0,2/13/2016,The avacado rolls are the  .  the mozzarella and tomato salad was to die.... This place blows away all the surrounding chains.  The bar is so pretty and inviting.  Took my 5 year old daughter and mom and we all had a great experience.
Denver L.,"Canton, OH",58,14,5,1.0,11/4/2015,We ate there on November 3rd. They have been open for over a month at this point. We got there at 5 p.m. . And didn't get our check to get out of there till after 7:30 I ordered a burger service was terrible food was cold manager did nothing about this I won't be back
