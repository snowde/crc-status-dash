Jeff J.,"North Canton, OH",5,3,,3.0,2/10/2016,"Good food but expensive. Same with the beer. A pizza, burger with fries, and 6 beers cost me 80 bucks. Which I can deal with except for some of the people they let go at the bar too long. Some regular drunk likes to go to the bar and instigate arguments and the bartenders let things go a little longer than they should (mind you it was 9pm when this happened to me on a Tuesday). It's a nice place. Not some hole in the wall where you'd expect things like that. This guy was drunk and picking fights with anyone he could get to respond and they just let him go bothering customers and he was hammered. Then when they finally kick him out right before he nearly starts a fist fight they laugh it off and say he does it like every night. High class."
Kevin G.,"Greensburg, PA",1,4,,1.0,5/30/2016,"First I have to say that the food was very good as it has been all along. But sad to say that everything else that comes with dining out was terrible. Our server was not very friendly and seemed to be overwhelmed with her duties. Every step took much longer than it should have and made for an uncomfortable experience. Then to cap off the evening and after paying the bill, I got a notice from my credit card company that I had been charged twice. I went back in to question our server(Audreanna) and said she made a mistake and it would be refunded to my card within 24 hours. It would have been great if she had told me what happened instead of finding out the way I did. Then when I called the restaurant. I spoke to a manager( Ms. Burwell) said that it would take more than 24 hours to show up on my card, more like 72 hours and she chuckled while telling me this. I asked for the information of the General Manager of the restaurant and she would not give it to me. She couldn't have cared less about what my issue was! It sad to see that a restaurant that has great potential is run by a group of incompetent untrained people. Needless to say I will not be visiting BJ's in the future!"
Sandi D.,"Canton, OH",12,2,,1.0,11/10/2015,Horrible service cold food and raw potato never going there again. They need to check out Texas Roadhouse and Roosters They have fantastic service and food. Learn from these places!
Allison A.,"Canton, OH",2,35,7,3.0,11/10/2015,"My friend and I were excited to see a new restaurant coming into Canton, and when we found out it was at BJ's Brewhouse and were speaking about it with a mutual friend, our mutual friend told us that we would love it. She said they had one in Vegas, and it was one of her favorite places to go, the food was so good, and she was excited, too.  My friend and I have been three times in the last month. The first time we went, I had a burger and she had the baked ziti. Both were quite good, although I would hesitate to say either was the best thing I ever had. The second time we went, we went for dinner. My friend ordered the seared ahi tuna salad, and I, splurging a bit, ordered the half rack of ribs. Now, let me quickly explain something. I am highly allergic to pork. I love it, so upon occasion, I will allow myself a small slice of ham, a piece of pork chop, or some ribs. I know that when I eat the pork, I'm going to pay for it fairly severely later, so it's important that the experience of eating it is worth the agony to come. Unfortunately, it was not. The server had promised me that the ribs were so tender they would fall off the bone. He described a 5-hour marinating process and a slow grilling process that allowed the full flavor of the meat to develop and tenderize. The barbecue sauce they use, a peppery sweet sauce, was really good, but the ribs were overcooked, tough, dry, and overall disappointing. Not worth the money I paid for them, and most certainly not worth the consequences. My friend's salad was presented beautifully, the ingredients were fresh and crisp and tasted wonderful, although the pieces of seared ahi on it were nothing like the picture in the menu. They were about half the size, and mostly hidden under the lettuce.  Yesterday, my friend said she wanted to try it again. Because we had just been there several days before and had had a relatively disappointing experience, I really didn't want to go, but it was close, we could get in immediately, and she was on a schedule. It was late afternoon, past lunch time but before the dinner rush, so we just ordered a pizza and two wedge salads. When we had been there for dinner earlier that week, I had seen someone at a table next to us enjoying a pizza. It looked delicious, a deep pan pizza, so I was amenable to trying it. We added wedge salads at a cost of 3.50 each, but I was disappointed with those as well. The dressing was nice, the lettuce was fresh, but I could get one twice that size at Red Robin for $0.50 less. The pizza itself was hardly warm in the middle, and the dough was not completely cooked through, so we had to send it back to be warmed up and properly cooked. Even after that, or maybe because of that, it wasn't great. They do have a huge menu with many things we haven't yet tried, so I'm willing to go again and try some other things. Maybe this is a place where the huge menu hampers them a bit. Maybe some things are good and some things I need to learn to avoid. Our service has always been good, and we like the modern industrial vibe of the restaurant itself. Just be aware that you are not walking into world-class dining and that your experience, depending on what you order, may vary greatly."
Athanasia P.,"Canton, OH",5,5,,5.0,4/2/2016,"Went in for dinner. This place just gets better and better! Rachael S was a wonderful server! I mean, why eat anywhere else?"
Travis S.,"Canton, OH",174,16,1,2.0,12/11/2015,"First thing, the menu is huge. I kept flipping the pages and still was not sold on what I wanted. Ordered a pizza which was fine. So the place is a brewery that doesn't brew in house. Just another corporate establishment. Beer was ok. Just not overly impressed. Nothing there that stands out."
Mrs. B.,"Stoneham, MA",0,42,7,4.0,7/26/2016,"I am giving this place four stars not because it's a four star restaurant, but because it was almost perfect given my expectations. Waitress was great. Attentive and friendly. Knowledgable about the beers available. Six meals ordered and everyone's was delicious. The strawberry mojito is fantastic! The Pizookie desserts are awesome. Guacamole and chips were really good too. Pretty good value for $85 including alcohol. Just wish we had a BJ's back home!"
Fred B.,"Lordstown, OH",3,14,,4.0,10/24/2015,"What a great place.  Huge menu, and everything on it is great.  Plus they brew their own beer.  Wait time was crazy, but mgr made it right.   We didn't even complain."
Steve S.,"North Canton, OH",2,50,13,3.0,2/2/2016,"So I've been here 4 times, only eating here twice. The reason being is the wait is always so terribly long. It's good food, but I'm not waiting 60+ minutes for what amounts to ""bar food"", I'll go to QSL and be eating within 30 minutes of arrival. That said the Brewhouses burgers are good. The pizza is strange, but ok. Needs more sauce. I'll give it a little longer to be open and hopefully the lines will be shorter."
Jon C.,"Cleveland, OH",0,18,,5.0,1/13/2016,Server Thomas B did a great job...good coustomer communication and beer / food knowledge. Asset to this location(first time here) and I've been to others in  southern Ohio many times. Food is spot on as well.
Kristin C.,"Massillon, OH",46,1,,4.0,10/11/2015,"My first experience at the newest canton restaurant was stellar!  The food and atmosphere were what you would expect from a brewhouse, (I was very pleased with the extensive menu), but the highlight of our visit was our server, Emily!  What a delightful young lady!  A lot of restaurants in Belden have great menus, drinks, and a wide variety of atmospheres, so what sets one apart for me is service.....and Emily delivered with her attentiveness, bright smile, and positivity!  I am a server myself, so this caliber of service in a new establishment was not lost on me.  I look forward to many more experiences at this great addition to the Strip!"
Jaime W.,"Horn Lake, MS",20,25,8,2.0,12/4/2015,"Heard it was great.. service was awful..we had to wait for shift change to get any service..was wondering why they even sat us. Food was OK. It will be a long time before I go back it's too loud and too busy.. beer, Grand CRU was great, I took home a growler, but ended up taking home a bigger one than I asked for and didn't feel like making them do it over. Hopefully in a year or 2 they will be better!"
Sean B.,"Louisville, OH",57,7,3,4.0,12/17/2015,"Nice spot on the strip. Beer was good, as was the food and the service. It was a much better experience than normal at a chain restaurant. I will defiantly go back."
Adena B.,"Canton, OH",0,5,,3.0,8/23/2016,"Ribs r good, but the soups r not bowls r way to big!!!!  Salad is fine. Pizza wrap needs to be hot not Luke warm"
Robert B.,"Canton, OH",0,12,,4.0,2/20/2016,Went here for some brews and dinner.  The service was quick and the food was great but I felt like I was rushed out and I hadn't even finished my first beer.
Richelle S.,"Canton, OH",0,2,,4.0,7/5/2016,Went for lunch. Deep dish pizza was delicious! Rootbeer and pizookie were also great! My son was a huge fan of the 5 meat pizza. We will definitely return!
Elisa C.,"Canal Fulton, OH",80,3,2,4.0,2/7/2016,"Great drinks, great food, and THE BEST fries you can get! I have been there twice and have gotten burgers both times which are pretty good. I've only gone on the weekend, so it's a pretty long wait sometimes. But they have a service to text you when your table is ready so you can go out and do something on The Strip while you're waiting. They also have a rewards program and I think an app that lets you put your name in early so the wait is even shorter. I love this place!"
Michelle G.,"Dover, OH",21,92,,3.0,11/1/2015,The food was really good and the atmosphere was cool. A bit disappointed that the Octoberfest I ordered was bad tasted really sour. I told the server it was bad and would like a different beer. They took away the bad beer brought me a new one but still charged me for the bad beer.
Darcie P.,"North Canton, OH",62,7,,5.0,10/29/2015,"The beer was great, food was great and staff was excellent! They had a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night so we ate at the bar and the bartenders were all so nice, Jeff and Shawn were awesome. There were so many menu choices but the pesto chicken sandwich I got was delicious. I really liked the environment also, I know it's a chain but it didn't have the typical chain restaurant feel. I would definitely go back and recommend to friends."
Rick C.,"Uniontown, OH",1,43,1,5.0,8/6/2016,Nice menu from apps to burgers to entrees- had a burger with brisket on it- they make their own craft beers and also carry a nice selection of other beers- as an IPA guy I have always found several to my liking- BJ's is always packed
