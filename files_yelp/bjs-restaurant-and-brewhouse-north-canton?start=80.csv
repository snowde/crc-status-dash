Jessica B.,"Uniontown, OH",0,6,,2.0,2/2/2016,"Waited at least 45 minutes for our food.  Orders were wrong and burgers overcooked.  Waitress was very attentive and fixed problems.  This is our third visit and probably last.  Too bad, loved the concept.  Oh and sent back burger and waited 15 min while the rest finished eating.  Just got mine in a box to go!"
Claudia R.,"Uhrichsville, OH",1,11,,5.0,7/26/2016,"I really love this place, every time I go I get calamari as an appetizer , ribs or guacamole burger as meal and the salty cookie with ice cream as desert. Good service!"
Brian M.,"Akron, OH",0,6,,5.0,10/25/2015,"Stopped here for lunch yesterday. Tried their Amber Ale & Red Ale, enjoyed them both.  Had the Gourmet Five Meat Pan Pizza, it was great!  Very nice atmosphere, and all of the bartenders were very nice.  Loved the big TV's too. Glad I stopped in!"
Katie H.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",0,5,,2.0,7/15/2016,"Went on a Wednesday for dinner around 7pm. Service wasn't up to par. They were having kitchen issues and it took forever to get our food. When the food came, it was room temperature, portions were off, and I didn't like the taste. I only gave two stars because after a conversation with the waitress, she got the manager and he paid for all of our food and apologized. Not sure if I'd try again."
Courtney R.,"Cleveland, OH",82,7,2,5.0,1/10/2016,"Came for a girls night with my friends from work and had a great night. All of our food was great, service was excellent. Had a really good experience. We called ahead for seating and I am glad we did, the whole restaurant was packed the entire time we were here!"
Tom H.,"Akron, OH",0,41,,4.0,5/28/2016,"A pleasant surprise to find a place that exceeds the standard bistro fare.  My wife got the burger and I got the pizza. Both were great, the service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed.  More comfortable chairs would help, but all else was really good. A little pricy."
Tracy D.,"Springfield, GA",0,15,,4.0,7/8/2016,"Fun environment, good wait staff...food was good but they over seasoned my steak....other than that this is a great place to eat and get drinks"
Sarah S.,"Massillon, OH",0,5,13,2.0,7/4/2016,"I've been twice now. Just ""ok"" both times. Food ""eh""...nothing I'd crave moving forward. Service a bit slow also."
Jim M.,"North Canton, OH",0,32,1,4.0,12/14/2015,"Very good food. Plenty of choices on the menu. Flat bread pizza was delicious. Also, the salads were nice size. One person at our table had the portabella burger. Great flavor! Lines are large being a new place on the strip. Sitting at the bar is nice. Many friends have done that and said the barkeeps are attentive. We had very good service with the wait staff.  Worth a try."
Dan B.,"North Canton, OH",26,28,13,4.0,12/6/2015,"Wow, my first time here. I was impressed! Very Good food, very tasty, full of flavor, great selection, and wide variety. A bit on the pricier side. Big menu, like being handed a dictionary. Love that they offer handcrafted Beers and Soda. The Root beer is awesome. Loved the Deep Dish Pizza, Caesar Salad, and the Sriracha Mac and Cheese. Wait Staff was enthusiastic. Love the decor and atmosphere. Was a bit loud for conversation. Wish they could have done some sound dampening in the construction. Went just after 9 pm on a busy Saturday night and was seated in minutes. Was disappointed a manager did not make rounds to his tables of guests. But kept coming to talk to the servers at the server station behind me and kept comparing this store with the Columbus store.   This restaurant makes a nice addition to The Strip and Belden Village area."
Amy D.,"North Canton, OH",53,2,,4.0,11/5/2015,"Visiting the area on business. Great BBQ, great ale.. Hope the dessert is just as amazing! Will be back on my next visit! #yumyum"
Mike R.,"North Canton, OH",1,48,,5.0,2/27/2016,"A wonderful addition to the long list of nondescript restaurants on the Strip.  We've patronized BJs several times since they opened and I have yet to see a place that combines such a great atmosphere with solid service, good food and a respectable draft beer list including several of their own productions.   Be sure to download their app to get on their wait list at lunch time and after 5pm - there is always a big crowd and wait times can stretch 30+ minutes.  Definitely worth the wait given what their competitors offer in the local area."
Austin P.,"Uniontown, OH",0,1,,2.0,5/16/2016,"Me and my fam wanted something new and we decided upon this place. The food was extremely delicious and the drinks were great. Unfortunately the service on our first time in was less than average, at best. Again the food was outstanding but our order was messed up a numerous amount of times; along with our fries not coming out until we already finished the meal and started on dessert. I'll be headin back forsure, I'm looking forward to trying their creative menu, just hoping the service is alittle better."
Billy D.,"North Canton, OH",0,2,,5.0,3/23/2016,"Been here over a dozen times now and am yet to be disappointed.  Their specials make everything worth it and for being a non Italian Restaurant, their Pizza is fantastic."
J B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/30/2016,"GOOD FOOD, DUMB POLICY.  This post is not to help the whiners, but to hopefully change a policy.  Good food good service.  If you want seated fast during a busy time, throw a temper tantrum and they will seat you immediately.  I was in on a Saturday night and watched this happen several times.  When I inquired, the hostess stated ""we want to keep everyone happy, if someone complians, we are told to seat them immediately.""   This is a bad policy, likely to make me think twice before eating here."
Jaclyne G.,"Canton, OH",0,1,,2.0,1/23/2016,I visited BJs for my 1st time last week with a coworker who really loves BJs and kept telling me all about it. I absolutely hated how close the tables in bar section were. Literally we felt we were part of the couples date next to us. Service was good. Food... well its okay (Good sandwiches) Loved the Sweet Cider Beer Yum and a few other beers were good. I would go back to have a drink and appitizer thats about it. Definitely not for dinner!
Jarod S.,"Canal Fulton, OH",6,1,,1.0,10/20/2015,"Being a new restaurant, I was expecting a few hiccups... A few was an understatement. Although the food was good, the service/wait staff needs some serious help. It took 5-10 min for anyone to get a drink order and it went downhill from there. Our table felt like we were inconveniencing the serves as they were short, not polite, and always rushed to leave. We unfortunately had a spill at the table and the server walked by, said ""oh no!"" and kept walking. No cleanup, no help. We had to clean the spill and ask for a rag to wipe up the sticky pop!  After that I asked 3 separate times for silverware and replacement napkins. After waiting 30 min for my salad, our food came out. No salad still. I asked about it and they said oops...I said to not bring it, my food is here now. A manager came over to explain that this would be taken off my bill. (As if an explanation was needed?! I didn't get it so just take it off!)  Also. No apology again. I wouldn't go back or recommend this place until they get their managers and wait staff figured out."
Corey H.,"Bridgeville, PA",0,7,,1.0,11/24/2015,Worst service I have ever had at any establishment. Waitress was rude and made it clear she was annoyed to be there. Waited 15 plus minutes to get a refill on a beer. Food was mediocre at best. First and last time I will ever step foot in this place.
Amber L.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",0,3,,5.0,9/2/2016,our general manager popped in at our location and bought us all lunch from bjs. first time trying their food and LOVED it!!!
Darci H.,"Canton, OH",0,53,8,5.0,12/5/2015,I had lunch at bj's and was very surprised how good the food was! I thought it would be more of a bar atmosphere but it was a great meal!
