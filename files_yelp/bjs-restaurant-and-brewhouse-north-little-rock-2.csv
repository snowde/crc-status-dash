Misty S.,"Sumter, SC",2,3,3,5.0,12/28/2017,"Will was absolutely fantastic! I can not believe what an amazing experience this turned into! It started out with a great server who was nice but our drinks were not good! Not even in the slightest. So we flagged Will down and let him know the situation. He was amazing and fixed the drinks himself and brought them back and waited until we tried them, they were phenomenal! That being said one of the girls in our party didn't like her drink because she is particular on the alcohol flavor and he took it as a challenge to find her something amazing... first try, NAILED IT! He is absolutely fantastic and made sure we were taken care of and that we had drinks in our hand. He is a fantastic asset to the restaurant and because of him we ended up staying quite a while and racking up a good bill. He made us feel welcomed and cared for! Absolutely amazing! We will be back time and time again! Hold onto the good staff!"
Paul D.,"Houston, TX",204,710,16,3.0,12/24/2017,"Traveling to the family for Christmas, I usually end up stopping in Little Rock.  This time was more of necessity because of the weather.  When in the area, I try to explore either the downtown area or one of the breweries that are always popping up.  As a huge storm was passing through, I was only able to check out some of the chains around the hotel.  BJ's was just down the block. I am no stranger to this brewpub franchise as it has been open in Houston for years.  Saint Arnold use to contract brew for all the Texas locations, and many states beyond.  I know SA has basically cut that out all together, and as this is a relatively new location, I doubt any of the offerings here were ever from SA, and I don't know who has taken up the contract stuff now? Anyway, like most in the franchise, a long bar, plenty of TV's, and plenty of seating spread out.  All in that comfortable chain vibe, that is pretty predictable.  Lots of beer options, from their own ""house"" beers to a pretty good list of regional and local crafts.  Actually, pretty comparable to the Saucer downtown, and way better than I remember the chain having. Their own beer options range in all styles.  Some I like, the Porter is very good, and a one off Barrel Aged Stout is pretty solid as well.  I was not very impressed with their Anniversary Grand Cru, being a 10% imperial wit, and that just seems like overkill for a style I should be able to come back to again and again.  Like most breweries, you will find something you like and something you don't. The food menu is huge, at over 20 pages.  For the chain as a hole, I never really found the food to be that great.  Though filling and well priced for what it is.  The Prim Rib Dip was OK, I would have like actual horseradish instead of a ranch like sauce with a vague hint of the pungent root.   The bartenders are great.  They were all on top of things, able to give recommendations if need be, and food coming out quick and hot.  All in all, a good chain, that will do when nothing else is viable.  I would rather check out more local stuff, but nothing wrong with this comfortable spot."
Patricia J.,"Frisco, TX",556,418,5964,4.0,11/26/2017,"Great service, clean restaurant and nice atmosphere. We started with the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. They are so tasty, the lightly spread sauce is just the perfect combination for this delicious dessert! I love the fact that they are light and crispy (just the way I like it).  We shared the NEW ENLIGHTENED SPICY PEANUT CHICKEN WITH SOBA NOODLES. I Highly recommend it! This entree is so tasty, but it does have a kick to it. We split it, not A huge portion but it is shareable.  We also had the BJ's Strawberry Beignet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, The Bread does NOT taste like a beignet at all, it's more of a sopapia taste. Also they do not add strawberries (as advertised), it's more of a strawberry sauce. Wouldn't order this dessert again."
David K.,"Beebe, AR",0,15,,5.0,1/10/2018,"This is my favorite place to go when I have a day off.  Today,  I had the calimari appetizer and the barbeque bison burger for lunch.  Both were excellently prepared and served quickly.  Omar, my server,  was friendly and attentive.  The beer, as usual,  rocks! Excellent experience!"
Chloenator M.,"Austin, AR",18,149,349,2.0,12/10/2017,I have tried to give this place a 4th try and I just keep getting disappointed. Service sucks. Food was ok. Pricey for the servings you get. The chips were very greasy. It looked like they were dipped in oil and put on the plate. The wings were not very meaty. The burger was the only good thing we had. The queso was subpar. It was a little grainy. It took for ever to order.
Dave B.,"North Little Rock, AR",19,1,,5.0,1/6/2018,"Great place to eat. I've had several dishes and none have disappointed. Love the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts!  Will B. Took care of us today, and was great. Awesome recommendations and service. Come see him!"
Wina B.,"Little Rock, AR",2,51,19,3.0,11/28/2017,"Great place for drinks, I had appetizers, I tried the yellow beets with goat cheese it was ok, I also had the ahi tuna which I loved paired with my sample set of beers, Love the atmosphere. Some of the Waiters though is rude."
Dana B.,"Athens-Clarke County, GA",1,4,,5.0,1/9/2018,"Delightful experience tonight with Will! He's the only one around so he's the only one you need to know. Came correct with all the best recommendations. Honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts are excellent! Food is good, service is better!"
Wayne L.,"Sherwood, AR",0,1,,3.0,12/29/2017,"Kitchen was very slow and there were not enough waiters to handle the number of customers. A bright spot was Will, our waiter, who was very good in what could have been a frustrating situation."
Felicia L.,"Memphis, TN",274,96,254,3.0,10/15/2017,Don't bother ordering the Brussel Sprouts they are over cooked the ribs were just okay the Staff was very nice... But the food is just OKAY
Robby G.,"Orange Beach, AL",39,59,11,4.0,12/14/2017,"Could score a 3 but I went with 4. First the negative. Edna got the Asparagus Shrimp Penne pasta. She was not impressed at all. The asparagus were all tough like it was all bottom pieces that should have been cut off. Flavor was decent. The positives: my jambalaya was great!! Definitely get it again. Our waitress Michelle was super! Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. Very wide range of choices and prices on the menu. Give it a try!"
Rhasheeka L.,"Memphis, TN",2,18,8,3.0,10/15/2017,"I dined here for the first time while in north Little Rock for the breast cancer run and it was decent . I asked for my Wings to be crunchy and when they came out I wasn't impressed at all . My dad enjoyed the nutty brunette beer in fact he had like 3 glasses , the spinach artichoke dip was decent . They burned my moms Brussels sprouts the first but brought them out the second time correctly z . The ribs she ordered seemed like they were good , I didn't hear any complaints from her so they must've been good . Not sure if it was because it was a Saturday night and super crowded but it was okay . I may dine again . Who knows ?"
Craig B.,"St. Louis, MO",0,12,,4.0,9/18/2017,"This is a decent chain restaurant.  Lots of options for vegetarians - they have salads, pizza, and all of their burgers can be subbed for a veggie patty.  Imagine tgi Fridays but a little nicer.  Gluten free pizza was good - although a little overpriced. The beer selection is decent, although the house ipa I tried tasted like seltzer.  Rating is for the food only.  Beer rating would be one star for their house brew."
Keith T.,"Long Beach, CA",0,13,,5.0,10/8/2017,"Great, fast service. Food was fresh, excellent tasting, and reasonably priced. Squeaky-clean from the front door to the kitchen, halls, and restrooms. Every single item was something special and the portions were perfect for a healthy/normal-sized person's appetite.  Have visited BJ's -NLR every visit to Arkansas over the past four years. It's perfect. Energetic atmosphere, but not so loud that you have to shout to carry on a conversation over your meal."
Chris S.,"Cabot, AR",76,60,12,5.0,8/14/2017,"My wife is not a fan but I absolutely love this place. I get the same thing everytime I come here. They probably have the widest variety of food to choose from of any restaurant I've ever been to. Their house beers are a great and do yourself a favor and save room for desert. Their Pizookie's are ridiculously good!!! Another high note of this place is the atmosphere and the space. Their ample seating has never caused us to wait long for a table, even with a large group on a busy night."
Michael I.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,5,,5.0,10/2/2017,"Very friendly staff, the flights where reasonably priced. My cheeseburger was juicy, and we'll seasoned.  I love this place"
Matt B.,"Little Rock, AR",21,61,15,2.0,10/9/2017,"Well, I can see how this one has a cumulative 3 star rating as of today. It's not good. I had the lemon thyme chicken. The chicken was very sodium-y. The brussel sprouts that came in the sauce were so hard I couldn't even cut through them. Entire dish tasted like it came out of a bag. Service is not that great, our server NEVER once came back to do drink refills or to check on us except to drop off the final ticket. The entire menu here seems forced, like some corporate chef seems to think more ingredients in a dish will make it better. Some dishes seem yucky just on the menu when reading their ingredients that don't complement each other. I might come back here for drinks--but food? No way, buster. Verdict : 2.5 stars.  Non Appétit-o!"
Brad B.,"Little Rock, AR",83,92,39,2.0,6/16/2017,"Some of the worst service in Little Rock. If people did not want to continue to go there for going aways, I would not go back. My solace lies in a huge beer selection of good beer, and some good appetizers, although nothing is usually prepared right after I place my order. They have great chips and salsa, so I would stop in and have a beer and some chips and salsa no problem."
John M.,"Birmingham, AL",1,18,1,1.0,7/23/2017,"My wife and I are from out of state and just came through for a couple of days to celebrate our anniversary.  Tonight we went to the BJ's in North Little Rock.  I've been eating at various locations since around 2009 but my wife had never been to BJ's before or even heard of it until today.  She ordered a mini pizza with two toppings, I ordered a small with a couple of changes made to the toppings listed on the menu.  My order was not complicated--take off two of the toppings listed and substitute two other ones--and please bake it well done. Our pizzas were brought out in a reasonable amount of time, and my wife absolutely loved hers.  I, however, could not eat mine because it was covered with one of the toppings I specifically stated that I did not want.  I pointed it out to the server and he said that he told the kitchen staff at least twice that I did not want any of that topping.  He sent the pizza back and asked them to make me another one.  The manager came out to the table and also apologized, which we appreciated.  But then we waited and waited and waited and waited.  My wife had long since finished her meal (and she is a slow eater) while I sat there waiting for my food to arrive.  When it finally did arrive, over an hour after we sat down, it was made correctly.  However, while the incorrect pizza had a generous amount of pesto sauce on it that was clearly visible, the corrected pizza had almost none at all. I ate my pizza and then waited for the server to bring me the check.  As someone who eats out far more regularly than I eat at home, I am used to having at least some sort of compensation offered when the restaurant makes a mistake on their end.  Not necessarily my item for free, but at least a discount for the wait, or a free dessert.  Something to let me know they are sorry and genuinely care about my business.  The only thing they did for me was to correct a mistake on the bill where I saw that I was overcharged (charging me for extra toppings rather than substituting them for other toppings left off). My wife also posted a negative review of our experience just over an hour ago (while we were still seated at the table).  By the time we got back to our hotel the manager had replied to her review with an apology and a request for her to call, as well as an invitation for us to return so she could make it right.  While it was nice of her to do that, why did she wait for a negative review to be published on Yelp before doing something?  She knew enough about the problem to come and apologize when I initially sent the pizza back.  The apology was nice, but it doesn't take away from the fact that we had to spend far too much time in the restaurant due to their mistake.  If she's going to offer something, why not offer it while we're still there?  Does she not care about customer satisfaction unless the customer goes out of the way to publicly criticize the service? As I stated at the beginning of my review, we are from out of state and don't live here.  We don't have time to come back to eat again before we go home.  And a gift card will be useless because I don't know of any BJ's locations in our state.  Please read the note I left on the receipt.  We had no complaints about the server himself.  He deserved a better tip than the one I left.  But I think that our wait deserved at least a $5 discount, which we were not offered, and so I would suggest you give him the $5 to make up for the low tip.  If you do that then we will be satisfied."
Brad V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,7,1,3.0,10/16/2017,"I've been to Bj's in pittsburgh and love it. Here not so much. The burger was just a burger, nothing special. I made sure that I looked at their happy hour specials on THEIR website as it's different per location. Monday was $6 brew house burgers (which is my go to) however when I got my bill it was the standard $8.25. Bartender wasn't the friendliest even though I told her I was from out of town...and i was the only person at the bar. Never introduced herself or ever asked if my food was ok. Pretty service standard stuff. The beer was cold to that's why it's 3 stars and not 2."
Blake R.,"Conway, AR",69,218,213,2.0,9/21/2016,So this experience was a little disappointing.  Server was new and a little slow. Ordered sweet tea but instead I received tea made with salt instead of sugar.  The avocado roll appetizer was not good at all. Flavors didn't really make sense.  Ordered the mahi and shrimp south beach plate.  Was ok but drowning in watery tomato sauce...  Only thing that was on point was the cold beer.  West Little Rock location is much better.
Athena D.,"Russellville, AR",31,2,,1.0,10/8/2017,"I love this chain but we had a particularly bad experience today. We asked for silverware and they didn't have any rolled. We sat at our table for about 10 minutes with food waiting for utensils. After dinner, we ordered the famous dessert. Our waitress came by when we were expecting our desserts to tell us that someone had to go to the store to buy ice cream because they had ran out. Ten minutes later, we asked for our ticket because we had to go. -- We spoke to the manager but she did not seem to feel that our visit was that difficult. She seemed annoyed by having to speak with us."
Tam Y.,"Sherwood, AR",0,19,11,5.0,9/17/2017,"I can't believe this place only averages three stars. I have been there several times and the food has always been fresh and delicious- much better than any of the other restaurants in the McCain area! I guess people around here are just accustomed to heavy meals microwaved and overloaded with sodium like Applebees, Chili's, etc. No thanks! The garlic knots and stuffed mushrooms are so good, and good stuffed mushrooms are hard to find."
Tom W.,"Levittown, NY",65,16,,4.0,8/14/2017,Great beer great food bar service was on point only 4 stars bc i have had better but its more like 4 and half. Super clean facility. Best cream soda i ever had try it with pinnacle whipped. Bjs if u make ur cream soda with pinnacle whipped and advertise it i guarantee people will love it. I will be coming back for more might try the ribs next time i went appetizer crazy last time and was there for a good 4 hours. I like there wings and asparagus a lot.
Isabel T.,"Nashville, TN",115,5,2,4.0,4/1/2017,"First of all, let me start out by saying I am the sort of person who goes to a sports bar and orders healthy food. This place has PLENTY of options. I ordered the quinoa bowl with spinach and chicken. It was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend's parents adored their food as well - one of them got the lemon thyme chicken, the other another quinoa bowl. Both raved about the flavor, and tried to figure out the ingredients to recreate at home.  Only knocking a star off because the service was pretty slow. It probably took about 25 min to get food. It was also a bit noisy (which is to be expected). But our server was friendly, and the atmosphere was great. Overall would recommend!"
Beth C.,"Buckeye, AZ",43,247,234,2.0,7/6/2016,"We have a wonderful BJ's back in Peoria, Arizona, and this place was such a stark contrast, I feel embarrassed for the chain. However, we came here because we had just departed the airport, wanted to avoid downtown, and we felt BJ's had a reliable menu. Yeah. Service was terrible. Our server would literally jog by about every 20 minutes and snap, ""Do you need anything?"" and not wait for an answer. Mind you, this was 2pm in the afternoon! A big party was seated near us but otherwise it was pretty empty. Our water was never refilled, though she did bark at my husband to see if he needed more beer. At that point, after about 40 minutes, we knew we just wanted our food and a quick escape. I ordered the ahi salad, my ""reliable favorite."" It was the worst ahi salad I have ever had. The lettuce had little flavor despite generous oil dressing. [Edited to clarify.] The wasabi dabs were tiny. It really peeved me that the avocado adornment for the salad consisted of two chunks about the size of my thumbnail. The ahi was okay and it didn't make me sick, so there is that. My husband had the meat piadina with fries. The fries were good, but the piadinia was decidedly meh. It was wrapped into a tighter style like a taquito, not the fold shown in the picture, and everything fell apart in a goopy mess. Our son had plain tortilla chips, what we always ask for my BJ's, and they brought out a tiny bowl. Editing to add: I was contacted by management (see comment below) and I am very impressed by how they addressed the concerns in my review. Much respect to them for their quick response. I really hope this was a case where my family visited this location when the server and kitchen were having a seriously off day."
Frank B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",122,7,2,2.0,7/23/2017,Very poor service took over 10 minutes to get my food order after my drink. Food has always been outstanding but the service is so poor I wouldn't tip these people if my life depended on it. I have been to Bjs in California and it's always treated me well . Guess it's time for this bjs to get better management.
Laura M.,"North Little Rock, AR",31,2,,1.0,7/23/2017,"My husband and I went to dinner here for our anniversary.  We each ordered a mini pizza. My husband had some special instructions, some of which were ignored by the chef so he sent the pizza back to be redone. We got to the restaurant at 7:30 pm.  My husband did not get his correct order until after 8:30pm and we had to cancel our plans that we had for after dinner. Then the waiter messed up on the check and had to reprint that.  The manager did come by the table after my husband sent the pizza back and said they were going to get a new pizza, but for our hour+ wait, we should have gotten another apology and something off our bill. Nada. We were very disappointed."
Chuck F.,"Cabot, AR",35,17,26,4.0,8/14/2017,"With all the negative reviews regarding the service at BJ's. Wanted give you an idea on how our visit went this evening. Greeted at the door, sat promptly and then William B came by to ask about drinks. He took our drink order, then brought them back and took the rest of our order. A couple of issues arose, first saw something in my wife's drink. He promptly returned with a fresh drink. Also, apparently there was a rather large group of wing eaters as they had run out of the Nashville cherry chipotle sauce. He came out and asked for me to replace it. As I wasn't worried about it I ordered the prime rib dip. William B brought me the wings too, I was surprised by this and said he didn't have to bring the dip too. He said no it was paid for, he was a fun guy and took great care of us. Thanks for a great visit. Oh, by the way the food was really great too and I have lunch for tomorrow"
Sandi H.,"Sherwood, AR",0,9,,5.0,11/13/2017,"My husband and I went here for Veterans Day.  We had been here before...opening evening....and food and service were both horrible.  We waited all this time to try the restaurant out again.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The food was great!  We both got the double boned pork chop.  It was the best chop we have ever had.  The service was excellent.  Our server, Omar, was very professional, friendly and made sure we have an very enjoyable meal."
Ian H.,"Mayfield, KY",1,6,4,3.0,7/27/2016,"First time here. Mixed review. Beer was great. Servers were friendly and helped get the ball game I wanted on screen. Ordered the BJ special pizza and asked for it to be well done. Extra crispy. When it came out, the cheese wasn't even melted. Major bummer.  Also the toppings were just ok. The menu touted homemade meatballs and all I saw was pre made sausage chunks. Just a big meh."
Shannon H.,"Sherwood, AR",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2017,"Disappointed in our visit yesterday. A couple months ago we swore off BJ's restaurant because it is a time warp. The service is always incredibly slow, a 1 hour lunch turns into two hours or more. Yesterday we went for lunch at 1 pm. We ordered our drinks 3 waters, 1 mimosa and a child's sprite. We got 1 water, the mimosa and a sprite. My husband ordered the gumbo and my daughter and I ordered mini pizzas. When our food arrived we did not have any silverware, the guy that delivered the food said he would go get some. He never came back, I had to walk around the restaurant looking for a server or silverware.... no one was available on the floor nor was there a hostess to help (there were several people waiting at the front door to be seated). I spot our waitress coming out of the kitchen and she comes over to the table. I tell her we need silverware and she immediately says oh your pizzas wrong takes it and walks off..... mind you I didn't complain about my pizza....and we still need silverware. She comes back from the kitchen (after what I am assuming is the entire kitchen staff poking and prodding my pizza, gross) with my now cold pizza, no silverware. She's complaining about how she has been irritated with the kitchen staff all day (again she complained about the pizza not me).  After we finish our lunch she finally realizes that our one glass of water is empty and goes to get 3 glasses of ice water. When she arrives back at the table all three full glasses of ice water get dumped directly on top of me and my pizza. I understand that accidents happen, but I did not get a table visit from the manager, did not get a towel to dry my soaking clothes off and was not even given another pizza since my was swimming in water.  I have worked in the restaurant industry before and will NEVER return to BJs. I understand mistakes happen but not one single person that worked at BJ's cared that a ton of water and ice was dumped all over me and my food which I had planned on taking to go."
Patty B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,21,,1.0,7/17/2017,"Well, another failure. I visit North Little Rock at least once a year. This restaurant chain also has locations in my home city of Las Vegas. I like the numerous choices on the menu, and have never had a problem at my home location.  Today my brother and I were looking for a place nearby for a late lunch, and decided to give BJ's another chance. Once again, the experience was unsatisfactory starting with our drink order. The waitress dropped his first drink. When the replacement was delivered it was incorrect, and was finally delivered to the table on the third attempt. I ordered an entree salad that was not prepared as described on the menu, and, in addition, was missing some ingredients. The waitress returned the salad to the kitchen to be prepared properly. Of course my brother continued to eat his meal while I waited for a new salad. In the end I was required to have my food prepared ""to go"" because it took so long. I had problems with waitstaff and food the last time I was here. I was hoping it had improved over time, and was disappointed. Today was my last visit to this location, and if asked by others for a recommendation, this restaurant will not be included."
I Am K.,"Jackson, MS",0,2,1,1.0,10/9/2017,Poor customer service they treat their guest like criminals in they have a out of state ID. I will would not go back to this place it take them 15 mins to check my ID because it was out of state. Managers need training in people skills... I would not go here
Janell F.,"Kansas City, MO",2,8,,3.0,11/1/2016,"First time at BJs and it was okay. Menu was huge..I came in a party of 6 and 3 of us had something mixed around with our order. Nothing to ruin the meal but sub par execution of our orders. The wings and chili cheese dip were great. Mahi mahi and shrimp tacos were smothered in sauce, I should have asked for it on the side.  Over decent experience but nothing to rave on, from my experience. One try is worth it but no need to return."
Carl C.,"North Little Rock, AR",17,70,6,4.0,8/14/2016,"I have been here a handful of times since it opened. I have had decent service, sometimes slower than I would like, good food, and good beer.  I switch between Tatanka Stout and the Nutty Brunette. I do try their seasonal beers as well and find most of their beers to be well made. Their food has always been pretty good to me, their menu is a little too thick for my taste (Need to separate the food and drink menus in my opinion).  The service though mostly adequate, can be a little slow, even in the slow times. They have never been rude, or disrespectful in my presence.  If you ever have an issue that the server cannot resolve, just ask for a manager they will come and help resolve the issue in a timely manner."
Kelli S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",39,88,3,4.0,4/1/2017,Service was quick and friendly. Son had the buffalo chicken grilled cheese and loved it. I tried the ahi tuna salad and it was ok. A little too much dressing and watch out for the Wasabi!  Really wanted to try a pizookie but didn't have room left for one. My son is looking forward to coming back before we head back to Indiana.
Austin B.,"North Little Rock, AR",120,13,14,5.0,1/30/2016,Every time I come I'm never disappointed with the food and drinks! The ribs are some of the best you can find. The mozzarella sticks are plentiful. Service is usually pretty good. It's usually packed but the bar often has tables you can grab. Here's my break down: Baby back ribs 9/10 Mozzarella sticks 9/10 Cream soda 10/10 Lettuce wraps 7/10 Chicken California club 8/10 The only complaint I have is its a little pricy. $19 for a half rack of ribs but $21 for a full rack. The full rack is worth it but the half rack doesn't need to be that high. Same with some other menu items. Overall you have to come here!
Brian P.,"Hensley, AR",0,5,2,5.0,5/19/2017,"Love this place. Pizza is top notch, fish and chips are some of the best I have had, and the bison burger was great. I always get a long island as they make them strong, but the price is a bit high in my opinion. My wife and I go there often as they have a vast menu! We have their rewards card and have been building points!"
Adam T.,"Mount Holly, NJ",8,41,,3.0,2/28/2017,"This place isn't too bad to go to, once or twice. The staff both times I went was pretty rude, the food is decent but way overpriced. I've seen better deals on food in NYC, and the taste doesn't match the price. Overall it's just a meh, and if other people want to go I won't complain but it definitely won't be my first pick."
