Tim J.,"Fayetteville, AR",0,6,1,2.0,2/11/2016,Wait staff was good ordered the salmon and it came out looking like a mashed down chicken breast.  I have had dinner at another BJ'e and got a nice plank of fish. This one by Mc Cain mall needs to step it up. When I mentioned this to staff she said she noticed the filet but served it anyway. Go figure.
Wendell B.,"Rome, GA",101,296,2,5.0,11/20/2015,"The beginning of our cross county summer trip to Arizona.  We have seen BJs in Florida but with all of the other choices we always chose something other than a chain.  Well, we were wrong.  This new location was beautifully decorated and Chase's service was impeccable.  BJ's serves its own brews, so of course I had to try my usual sampler, choosing their blonde, red, hefe and IPA.  All delicious and after tasting mine, my wife ordered 2 blondes and a hefe to accompany her meal.  She chose a favorite dish:  Mediterranean soft tacos, and I went for the jalapeno burger, a regular favorite of mine.  Food was hot and delicious and the beers were good and cold, and just what we needed after a long drive and skipping lunch.  We had planned to go to a dinner theatre we had discovered, but had elected the play only ticket due to other badf expeirences with steam table dinner theatre food.  I think we made a good choice."

Patrick L.,"Sherwood, AR",2,24,19,2.0,10/29/2015,"The bartenders and managers are ridiculously stupid. This is my opinion as a local and visiting now 6 times at the bar for dinner and drinks. The food is good. Beer choices many - liquor choices few. It's Thur night, NE Patriots are playing and they are on 2 of 10 big screens and I'm looking at a taco bell commercial."
Scott K.,"Cabot, AR",0,6,,1.0,10/3/2015,"One star is being generous. 30 minutes between drinks, 2 people at our table got their food 20 min before everyone else, our waitress would disappear for 20 min at a time and the manager tried to blame us even though we said she was doing fine. Then the bottom fell out, it took 45 min for our 1st bill which was so wrong it wasn't even funny, then I had to complain to the manager who then said I was out of line when I told him everything that went wrong. Plus it took him 30 more min to get another bill that was way off and then he told us to leave because even he couldn't figure out the correct bill! Needless to say, I'll never back. Horrid service and will not recommended to anyone."
Leslie K.,"Sherwood, AR",0,36,8,1.0,10/9/2015,"We were so excited to go here after it opened. We were there within a week of the opening. One visit is enough, we will never go back. We were there for two hours. The place was not even that busy and we had to practically flag down the waitress. She took our orders after probably 30 minutes. When our food finally came the one dish was wrong. We ordered shrimp and got chicken.  One order was a bison burger and when bitten into, it was raw. Took forever to get the waitress back. She took the burger back and offered to bring shrimp. The second burger arrived after everyone else has finished their meal and still, and it was still not cooked to satisfaction. After all of that, the check was over $60, no offer of compensation for anything.  I have never paid so much for such a bad experience. She offered to go drinks. We waited for 15 minutes and never got them. Finally were tired of waiting and left. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I've talked to others with similar experiences there."
