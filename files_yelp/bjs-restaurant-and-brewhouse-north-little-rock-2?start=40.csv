Gary B.,"Little Rock, AR",0,14,,1.0,11/2/2016,"The food was decent and the menu has a nice variety but the service was awful.   First it took a long time to seat our party even though the restaurant was not full.  Then, our waitress was not attentive.  It took forever for our order to be taken and then she did not come back to check on refills or to give us the opportunity to order more drinks.  I had to flag her down to order another beer. I was the only one in my party who decided to order desert.  When I did flag her down (again) to place the order, within a matter of a few minutes, she brought checks for the table with no explanation or saying ""no rush.""  We took it as her telling us to ""leave.""  I changed my order to a take out order, we left and will not be back. The food was not bad.  I had a pasta dish which was good and their beers are good although I am disappointed that they are not brewed on site. There are plenty of other places nearby that would appreciate your business much more than this place...."
Andrea W.,"Cabot, AR",4,26,2,1.0,7/14/2017,"I am currently waiting for my check and this experience here today has been awful. Myself and 4 others arrived around 3:00 to a basically empty dining room. Jamie C was manning the hostess station and gave us grief about asking for a booth that was ""not in her area"". Even though there were only ppl dining in the bar area and there was ""only one other server"" (not my problem). She then proceeded to bring the iPad which she didn't know how to use or was u willing to try because we weren't in her area. She took our order and food came (pretty good except my chicken sandwich was basically a tender on a bun). We aren't offered drink refills and she asked us once as she walked by if everything was ok when we hadn't even taken a bite. We weren't asked if we needed a split check and had to wait far too long for that to them happen after we asked for it. Also, we had a 9 year old birthday girl in our party and Jamie simply replied, ""really?! My birthday is tomorrow!"" Jamie was not a pleasant server."
Jenny P.,"Mililani, HI",54,47,51,3.0,5/15/2016,"I'm giving this place 3 stars for the benefit of the doubt, because I feel like this place has great food, but maybe my husband and I ordered the wrong things. It was our first time here, and we were excited to try the deep dish pizza and ahi poke. We're from Hawaii, and my husband, like many other locals loves fish-especially poke.  The poke was disappointing. The fish was not fresh and it was a very small serving. It was served with some kind of wonton chips or something...we both didn't care for it. He didn't even finish the fish. The pizza was especially disappointing. We ordered a small, and I'm glad we did. It looked shriveled up and dry in the ""deep dish pan"". What we disliked about it was the fact that they didn't use marinara/pizza sauce on the pizza. Instead, there were chunky, diced tomatoes-and not very many of them. This made the pizza even more dry. It was basically OK pan pizza dough topped with toppings and no sauce. There wasn't even a lot of cheese either. Domino's pan pizza tastes way better than BJ's deep dish pizza :/ The only thing my husband and I thought was good was the clam chowder. We'll still eat here again and get different menu items. Also, the clam chowder would probably be better in the bread bowl, so we'll try that too."
Dan S.,"Godfrey, IL",0,2,6,4.0,8/22/2015,"Who said there is no such thing as a free lunch? I was passing through North Little Rock, Arkansas and I came across a restaurant that I couldn't remember ever seeing before: BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. So decided to stop for lunch. My first observation was the number of vehicles in the parking lot. It seemed extremely busy (must be good). When I walked up to the front door I was greeted outside by a host. He informed me that the restaurant was not officially opened to the public yet and that the guests were all on an invitation list (that helps to explain just how busy the restaurant was). He then told me that if I was willing to sit at the bar that I would be more than welcome to have lunch there. That was perfect considering that is exactly what I was planning on doing. I bellied up to the bar and was immediately met by one of the several bartenders. She began by telling me that the restaurant was having a ""soft opening"" and that the meal would be complementary. All of my economics professors were wrong. There is such a thing as a free lunch. The menu that was presented to me was limited; however, I didn't care because it had a number of pasta dishes on it. The bartender offered me a hefeweizen, but I regrettably declined and ordered an iced tea instead. My iced tea came moments later and I then ordered my free lunch. I decided to have Cajun Pasta. The bartender asked if I wanted chicken or shrimp - I chose shrimp. She then asked if I wanted the shrimp grilled or blackened - I chose blackened. Who knew there would be so many questions? The dish also came with a salad - I chose a house salad with Italian dressing.    The salad arrived in less than 5 minutes. The greens were fresh, crisp, and cool. The dressing was vinaigrette-based and I believe it had grated parmesan cheese in it. I liked the dressing a lot. And while the house salad was fairly basic, it was much better than what you get at many restaurants for a house salad. And the quantity was just right . . . not too much or too little. The Cajun Blackened Shrimp Pasta arrived a few minutes after I had finished my salad (a picture of the dish is attached). Therefore, the timing between the courses was very good. The pasta was linguine with a tomato based Cajun sauce that had tomato chunks and finely diced onions and green bell pepper. There was also a white cheese sprinkled over the top of the pasta (probably shredded mozzarella). There was enough cheese either on top or within the sauce that it gave the dish a very nice ""cheesy"" taste. I enjoyed the taste of the dish very much. It was slightly spicy, but not overwhelming. I only have two criticisms: the first is the chunks of tomatoes (I'm not a fan of chunks of tomatoes) and the second is that the shrimp were only average sized (I would have been impressed if the shrimp would have been larger). All in all, it was a nice lunch . . . and it was FREE. If it wouldn't have been free it would have cost $16.25 before tax. The cost included the salad, pasta, and iced tea. By today's standards I don't think that is a bad price for the product that I received.  This was obviously a new restaurant (they are still conducting ""soft openings"" in order to train the staff). Therefore, the restaurant is very clean and very new looking. I have attached a couple additional pictures that show the bar and the dining area.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The service was very fast (but not too fast) and extremely friendly. In addition, the staff was very capable of describing the items on the menu in detail. I look forward to trying this restaurant after it is formally opened on Monday, August 24, 2015 so I can see the entire menu and imbibe in the numerous craft ales that are on tap. I will definitely have lunch or dinner here the next time I am in North Little Rock. I rate BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse a 4 out of 5."
Michael E.,"Sherwood, AR",280,102,110,2.0,11/17/2016,"Went here with a vet friend of mine on Veteran's Day. The service was pretty good and the place was packed. The food was just ok. I usually get the California chicken club (Great Sandwich) but I decided to switch it up and I ordered the Triple Decker sandwich. The description and the pic of the sandwich is what lured me in ""Sliced turkey, roast beef, ham, cheddar and swiss cheese, tomato and lettuce drizzled with Italian dressing, piled high on a hoagie roll, finished with mayonnaise and mustard and topped with dill pickles.""  The sandwich is way over priced for the quantity and quality of the sandwich. When I tell you the sandwich came out stone cold I mean there might have been a layer of frost on the cheese. It was so cold I couldn't eat my other half of my sandwich, I took it home and warmed it up in the microwave. I think I'm going to go back to my old sandwich of choice when I go there. I'm still feeling chills."
Kimberly W.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,5,,5.0,2/25/2017,"My husband and I had dinner here this afternoon. Our waiter was great- he was very attentive and kept us updated on our food at all times. The food was wonderful! I definitely recommend the peanut butter smore pizzoki!! We also had a deep dish pizza, root beer soaked ribs, and the baked ziti. Everything was perfectly cooked and full of flavor."
Brian H.,"North Little Rock, AR",56,1,,5.0,2/25/2017,"They just started a Prime Rib dinner tonight and it was AMAZING! The meat was tender and juicy and full of flavor. Along with that your dinner comes with two sides, soup or salad and a dessert! All of this for $26.99! I highly recommend this to everyone!"
Christopher M.,"Benton, AR",39,6,,1.0,1/2/2017,Poor service and poor management. Our table was not the only one receiving poor service. Another table waited an hour for food and ended up leaving. The sad part is that it was a week night with light traffic.
Bob W.,"Memphis, TN",0,45,21,3.0,11/18/2016,Expensive for what it is. The trendy thing now is beer and they do have a variety but at the end of the day it's just overpriced. I believe it was about $35 for 2 of us and I only had one beer...
Alexis D.,"Conway, AR",129,1,1,5.0,7/18/2016,I love going to bjs. The deep dish ziti is amazing and their berry burst cider is the bomb. Go to the bar and sit with Geoffrey M. He is so nice and gives great service. Great food and service makes bjs my top choice in restaurants in nlr!
Russell S.,"Hewitt, TX",0,4,,4.0,5/31/2017,"good experience. on par with other BJ's I've been to, with the exception of the East El Paso Location"
Jonathan D.,"New Orleans, LA",47,7,,1.0,2/20/2016,Been here over three hours. Still haven't seen any food. Service staff seems to be trying their best but something seems broken at this place. Way too slow.  I've eaten here before and the food is decent and service is always good but not sure it's worth the wait times.
Leo C.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,1,,1.0,6/14/2017,"Waited for more than 10 minutes before I even got the menu. Waited for 40 minutes for salmon and asparagus only, and they only came out to try to tell me an excuse. I actually walked out of the restaurant without eating after over 50 minutes. Don't waist your time."
Justin R.,"Sherwood, AR",13,1,,2.0,2/13/2016,"I began my visit by waiting at the bar for our table to become available. I ordered a dirty vodka martini. As far as martinis go, it tasted a little watered down. We started our meal with the potato skin appetizers. They were good, but nothing special. I ordered the sirloin with a baked potato and house salad as my sides. The salad wasn't much more than lettuce and croutons with a scant bit of ranch dressing. The baked potato was just barely done enough and came with nothing except for two small cups of butter and sour cream on the side. As for the steak itself, it was cooked perfectly to the medium rare I asked for. Despite that, it was still extremely bland and tougher than it should have been. I would give this place three stars if not for the fact that everything was way overpriced. I could have spent less money at Outback and gotten a bloomin' onion, a robust house salad with onions, tomatoes, and plenty of dressing, a fully loaded baked potato, and a great tasting steak."
Jessica K.,"Sulphur Springs, TX",26,1,1,1.0,1/23/2016,"My first visit to this branch was pretty good. My second visit was pretty terrible. Initially, it took around ten minutes for our server to make it to the table. We ordered our drinks and when she brought them she forgot the water we ordered. The whole experience we felt unimportant because we didn't see Our server for large spans of time.  We ordered an appetizer, and when it arrived 20 minutes later it was lukewarm and inedible. Even my 10 year old son was displeased with the cheese dip. He's not typically picky, either.  55 minutes after the hostess brought us to our table our order came out, but the service staff completely forgot about the salad I ordered which usually comes before the entrée, in the rest of America, at least.  Also, my daughter's cheese burger was incorrect. All of the food was pretty tepid, as well. I don't know about you but I like HOT food and expect it to be hot when I'm paying money for it.  This was not a good experience and was thoroughly disappointed on more than one account.  I will say, I enjoyed my beer, but I like beer and appreciate a good brew house. Too bad the service and food sucked. I won't be going back, except for a growler here and there. But then again, I got Vino's for that. So, suck it BJs...that's why your name is BJs...right?"
Jason T.,"Salem, OR",12,16,21,2.0,8/11/2016,"Just your typical chain restaurant but the staff is super nice and do their best to take care of you. I ordered the mahi and wasn't impressed with the portion size so I ordered something else to go with it. The waitress tried to convince me to let her get me another plate free of charge but I didn't want it. Also ordered a margarita and it came surprisingly quick. After my first drink I realized why, it was super sugary, barely drinkable I'm assuming it was pre mixed. Again the staff was very friendly but people don't go out to eat because the staff is friendly."
Andrea K.,"Sacramento, CA",37,24,14,1.0,11/28/2015,"Fiance and I were visiting family here in LR from California and wanted a small slice of home since we were feeling homesick. Worst. Idea. Ever.  Initially we were excited. Found seats at the bar immediately. Got our beer and looked through the menu. Knew before we walked in we wanted avocado eggrolls as its a favorite at BJ's.  Ordered app and meals. Finances meal and app came out... No soup and salad for me. Really? The easiest thing on the menu to order and no soup or salad. Apparently the bartender forgot to ring it in. Ok, I'm patient. Won't take more than a minute. Nope. Finances entire meal was consumed before we even asked if I could even get my salad. Was then also told the soup had run out an they had to heat a new batch.  More than 10 minutes later still no soup after kind of picking at my salad in frustration. When the bartender asked if something was wrong I voiced my frustration. Bad idea. She was clearly angry. Said she would get it comped then proceeded to stay at the opposite end of the bar. BTW, still haven't seen soup at this point.  Finally the manager came over and apologized and offered to give me the soup to go. She was sweet enough and I truly wasn't trying to be rude but the service was terrible. Please don't go here. It's a joke of customer service."
Jerry M.,"Maumelle, AR",21,11,,4.0,9/26/2016,"Been there both to eat as well as to enjoy Happy Hour - would recommend either, but especially Happy Hour - great food/snack prices and always good brew"
John C.,"North Little Rock, AR",6,19,,2.0,12/3/2016,"When this place opened, the service and food was awesome. Sadly, now it has become just an ordinary chain restaurant that is impressionable! The beers they have are great, but the wait staff and front of the house people (Which I Never Saw) was very bad! Not going back! Not worth the money!"
Kathlen J.,"Tulsa, OK",1,15,,4.0,4/28/2017,"This restaurant was very close to our hotel so tried it since we've been to several of this brand at other cities. We were not disappointed. Atmosphere was upscale sports bar. Food was great, both selections and quality.  I love that they offer gluten free options. Had their gluten free dessert and it was a treat.  The music was at just the right level so you could listen if you wanted, but still talk to your table mates."
