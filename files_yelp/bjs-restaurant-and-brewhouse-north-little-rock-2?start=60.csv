Kelli B.,"Little Rock, AR",42,5,,1.0,4/20/2017,"Food is good, but worst service in NLR! We are rarely in and out in under an hour with 2 people. The last time we went, we walked out after being ignored for 20 mins by every server who walked by. We never had our drink orders taken and were never acknowledged. There were only 3 other tables occupied in the whole restaurant. Not likely to return."
Mark W.,"Searcy, AR",0,1,,2.0,4/15/2016,"Totally disappointed with our meal. Especially for what I paid. To be straight, the drinks we had were great. But the food was a different story.  We ordered the fried calamari appetizer and it was terrible. It would have been easier to Chee a bicycle tube.  Out of the four meals ordered, two were good. The bacon Mac and cheese and the spaghetti and meatballs. The fish and chips was ok if you like extra greasy fish and cold fries. The chicken Alfredo had chicken that was inedible. It or something else had been burnt on the grill so the grill marks made it taste like burnt charcoal. And even the noodles were burnt. Called the manager over and he replaced it to his credit and it was a little better but still not great.  Needless to say we won't be back."
David B.,"Jacksonville, AR",0,1,,4.0,9/29/2016,"Had a nice experience...Markeisha was our waitress and made the experience worth repeating, or was that the Monkey Bread Pazookie"
Dean G.,"Duluth, GA",28,39,7,5.0,9/4/2015,"Excellent restaurant and service.  Their own draft beer is awesome, the food was prepared just as it showed in the picture, and the service was 1st class- very attentive but not obtrusive.  I highly recommend this location. I'll be back on my next visit to Little Rock!"
Debbie H.,"Gretna, NE",90,415,17,4.0,12/17/2015,This is a typical BJ's.  I like the casual atmosphere.  The menu (food and brew) is extensive and the pizookies are to die for.  Today I just sat at the bar.  Enjoyed cherry chipotle salmon with quinoa.  That will definitely be a standard.  It was both delicious and filling.
Eric N.,"Mountain Home, AR",61,6,3,1.0,7/7/2016,Food was nothing like described and overcooked to almost raw. Meatballs. Waitress was very nice and friendly. Won't be back very unhappy
Jo H.,"Sherwood, AR",0,2,,4.0,9/13/2015,"Have eaten here twice. We all share a bite to try as much as possible. Pizza, burger, fries, chicken pesto sandwich, Mediterranean chicken taco, Parmesan crusted chicken, house salad great. Jambalaya- spicy but good too!   Service needs a little  work. Waited too long both times for our server.  First visit we had other staff tried to cover and answer questions until our guy showed up and this time was told it was told it was shift change. Despite this we will definitely return and hope this is just part of just opening."
Robert T.,"Sherwood, AR",7,29,40,5.0,8/20/2015,"Popped in twice this week. They are still in a soft opening period and officially open Monday 24th August.  Large square building with 2 separated areas: main dining and bar (also with tables to dine).  Obviously this is brand new so the staff go out of their way to be friendly, hopefully this continues.  I sat at a vey large bar (see photos) that has 3 huge TV's on the wall so watching sport here is very enjoyable. There are also several other TV's on the other 3 walls for all around coverage.  I asked for a flight of beers and was presented with a menu that lays flat on the bar and has 10 of their brews all marked with brief descriptions. They placed 4oz fluted glasses on the corresponding marks and I proceeded to try them all. I love beer but I am in no way a connoisseur but they all tasted pretty good to me with several standouts: Brewhouse Blonde (light pale, 4.7% abv) which is the top seller; Oasis Amber, underrated imho (smooth, not to hoppy or bitter 4.7% abv); PM Porter which is an award winning dark ale (6.4% abv) also my wife's favourite and lastly my fave, Tatonka (imperial stout 8.5% abv).  They have a great selection of world beers on tap including Guinness, which is poured correctly, Newcastle and Stella Artois and also Diamond Bear, a local Arkansas brewery beer. There are no Buds/Millers etc on tap but they are available by the bottle. If you want a handcrafted brew that is similar to the Bud/Miller beers you should try the LightSwitch lager (3.5% abv 103 calories).  We also had the Portobello Swiss burger which was fabulous.  They also have a great wine selection (see photos) and liquor selection. For whiskey aficionados I have to point out that all their bottles have pour spouts which does affect the taste slightly but this is a policy for all BJ breweries and I can't see it changing. I had a very nice Macallan 12. We also purchased 2, 64oz growlers of the Blonde and Oasis (Sadly the Porter and Tatonka are not available in growlers).  I can't rate this BJ's location high enough and being smoke free a great alternative to Fox and Hound. This will also give Hooters across the street a run for their money. This will be my go-to bar for sports and the odd stop on my way home.  Try it, you won't regret it."
Alex S.,"Omaha, NE",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2016,"Not impressed. Maybe the worst customer service I've ever had. Firstly, not all of the meals came out at the same time. Some people were finished before others even got their meal. Secondly, my order of shrimp and asparagus penne (VERY simple may I add), came out wrong. So when I asked for a new one, the waiter didn't even apologize and it didn't come out for another 15 mins. Everyone at the table was finished eating. Still no apologies, plus it wasn't even good. Skip BJ's."
Patti B.,"Sherwood, AR",21,22,3,3.0,12/6/2015,"Update - This restaurant needs to be more consistent with food quality. I've had some great meals here and some really mediocre. Please up your appetizer game.  HUGE menu - easily something for everyone's palate. Handcrafted sodas were a nice surprise. Some really nice sides (like roasted asparagus or roasted brussel sprouts). The service is friendly but a little on the slow side. Management - keep working on your service and turn the music down a little. This could be a ""go-to"" restaurant once the kinks are worked out."
Robert W.,"Fort Smith, AR",38,26,24,4.0,5/1/2016,Had a great dining experience here. I had Fish and Chips. Cooked to perfection. Wife had a sandwich. It wasn't quite right but the staff addressed it quickly and got it taken care of. Customer service is on point.  Pay this place a visit.
Ian C.,"Haughton, LA",43,11,9,1.0,4/30/2016,"I don't know where to even start. Let's start with the good I guess, since that won't take long. The good:the floors weren't sticky, they have a nice draft selection, and it looked clean even though it was dark and had very low light.  The bad: let's start with service. The service we had was horrible, it started from the hostess who seemed bothered to have to stop talking to her friend and even more bothered that we didn't want to seat ourselves at the bar area. Let's move on to the waitress, Angie, because a bad hostess doesn't always mean a bad waitress or bad service all around. Angie seemed like she had no idea how to be a waitress, she was slow, confused, kept making errors, forgetting to check on us, she didn't bring the food out to our table because she was stuck hiding in a wait station. I can understand these problems when you're busy, I've been a waiter and ran a restaurant and so I know how it goes, but to act this way when you have 4 tables in a 8 table section and 3 of the 4 tables are 2 tops just doesn't make sense. After we first sat down to the table it took 20 minutes for her to even acknowledge us and take our drink order, again this could be the hostess I spoke of earlier, once she got our drink orders it took her at least 8 minutes to bring a glass of water, a dr. Pepper and a woodchuck draft. She gave us our drinks and we ordered. We ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and we both ordered ribeyes for our entrées. Angie was in clear view standing at the wait station when a runner brought out our appetizer. The mozzarella sticks were decent, much better than fast food sticks but not the best I've had, and you get 10 in an order which was surprising to me. Angie hadn't moved in at least 15 minutes after our appetizer was delivered. I finished my ale and started on my Dr. Pepper, but my wife had been out of water for most of that time. When she finally stopped by our table to see if I wanted another drink, I had to stop her and let her know I didn't but my wife would love another. While she was gone for 17 minutes to get some more water, our steaks were delivered to us, again by the runner. The steaks were cooked medium rare and medium and looked appetizing. I asked for roasted asparagus and white cheddar mashed potatoes and my wife asked for roasted asparagus and steamed vegetables for our sides. The asparagus was not roasted, they seemed to be steamed. The steamed vegetables my wife received was definitely from the bottom of the bag of mixed vegetables, since she got one broccoli floret, no cauliflower pieces larger than a pea and no carrots larger than a pea. My mashed potatoes were ok, definitely not made in house and couldn't taste cheddar in them at all. The steaks were horrible, and it's a shame for a nice cut of meat. Cutting the steak with my knife I had high hopes, it felt tender and cut easily, they looked well seasoned, but unfortunately none of that was the case. I have never had a steak come to me so bland. It was cooked to medium like I asked but it was the toughest steak I've had in a very long time. They say the steaks are dry aged for at least 28 days, but the flavor did not back that up. It was a steak, but the only way you could tell was by looking at it. The burnt parts on the steak were a nice touch as well. We finished what we wanted and started waiting, about 20 minutes this time. Angie finally returned! We asked for our check as she was clearing the table and trying to sell us on dessert. We waited another 9 minutes for the check, and I know what you're saying, maybe she got more tables while we were doing all that waiting. Well she was seated 1 more table but 2 tables left. She brought the check and said ""don't worry I'm not going anywhere"" as she took a step back to wait for us to pay. We paid cash just so we didn't have to wait any longer.  The whole ordeal took us over an hour and a half, for poor service and bad food.  I didn't ask to speak to the manager because I had already seen her speaking with 2 other tables, and I believe in paying for what you get. So I paid for what I ordered and will not be bringing my business back and will warn others of this place.  All times are accurate. The times were recorded on a stopwatch on an iPhone 6."
P C.,"Sherwood, AR",0,26,171,3.0,1/5/2016,"Atmosphere was good, better than Chili's or Bar Louie. Food was good. I had the Salad with Seared Tuna. Ambiance was excellent. My only beef is the price. It's about 25-50% higher than Chili's, Cheddar's, or Johnny Carino's."
Andrea J.,"Miramar Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2016,"We will not go back. I ordered a Mojito and received a glass with Mojito mix static out of the bottle. Simple awful. So,I had the server take it back. She said, yeah we don't muddle the mint and lime. Well, don't put it on the menus if you can't get it right.   Parmesan crusted chicken was dry and pretty tasteless, especially the Parmesan was missing. Steak was dry as well. The service was slow.  We waited a long time for an almost empty restaurant to pace the food order. Not a good evening. Sorry."
Tyrell F.,"Chicago, IL",1,12,2,5.0,12/14/2015,"We were traveling from Chicago and just happened upon this place. We were pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the food. We had food from the Enlightened Menu, and wow, was it tasty! The beers were nice as well. If you do go, ask for Jackson; he was our server and did a fantastic job! Overall, great experience!"
Deniece M.,"Panama City Beach, FL",119,27,32,3.0,3/18/2016,"I started off with the beginners appetizer, the avocado egg rolls were the best part. Then I had the north beach mahi mahi and shrimp. The broth was extremely salty, almost inedible. The mahi mahi was a bit overcooked and dry. This is definitely the smallest BJ's I've been to. Also had the salted caramel pizookie. It was fucking amazing but wayyy smaller portion than i remember. If you like margaritas definitely try the watermelon basil it was really good the basil was a nice touch. Overall it was overpriced and just okay. I might come back but only for drinks and dessert"
Caleb S.,"Ward, AR",10,4,,1.0,1/17/2016,Food wasn't good. Waited almost 2 hours to eat and they weren't full or even close. Asked for a high chair 3 times and never got it.
Kwee L.,"Cabot, AR",4,23,42,5.0,2/7/2016,"This was one of the best dinning out experiences we have had in a while.  The food was delicious.  But what really put it over the top was the service we received.  William was our waiter.  He had our table and I don't know how many other tables, plus a really big group, to wait.  He had his hands full, but it never showed up in the quality of attention we received.  He even took the time to explain how BJ's strives to maintain consistency in quality and style in all of their restaurants so you can expect the same everywhere.  My son collects bottle caps.  William provided him with a nice quantity of bottle caps and with coasters depicting each of their specialty beers from the bar.  We cannot say enough good things about our dinner here Saturday night, and yes, the place was full and busy.  We had the Crispy Calamari appetizer - delicious, and some of the best Calamari I've ever had anywhere.  I had the Baby Back Ribs (and a glass of Blackstone Merlot) - tender, delicious, perfect.  And the roasted asparagus I had with them was really good.  My son had the North Beach MahiMahi and Shrimp - delicious!  We traded some from each four plates so we could try some of both orders.  That MahiMahi defined great fish for me.  The shrimp with it was just fantastic.  The whole dish as so well done with amazing flavor and taste.  We got Pizookies for dessert.  My son had the Cookies 'n' Cream and I had the Salted Caramel.  OMG good!  Save room, make room, they are wonderful.  We had ours with coffee and no regrets.  We will most definitely and frequently be back here."
Hallie S.,"Cabot, AR",26,69,38,4.0,3/8/2016,"There's lots of variety. Everything I've gotten has been good quality. The staff is friendly and competent. I like the music and decor, it has a nice atmosphere. There is a fantastic beer menu and the other alcoholic beverages are good."
Mona G.,"Haynesville, LA",14,21,3,1.0,2/4/2016,"We were in town for business.  We decide to go check out BJ's.  Service first night was great and food was pretty good.   Well a friend came meet us and he wanted to check it out.  Service suck.  We got the Brussels sprouts they were burn and over done.  My chicken dish well, black beans were dry and over Micowave.  Chicken was to salty and over done. The dish suck was the Barbara chicken.   I would not recommend this place scale of one to ten a 1. I will not be back."
