Megan R.,"North Little Rock, AR",43,85,442,4.0,12/8/2015,"The food I wasn't so much impressed with. The atmosphere however is nice. It's a huge place with tons of t.vs, great beer/drink selection and plenty of people for watching. The menu also has a little bit of everything for everyone. The NLR location was much better than previous experiences I've had in Little Rock. When I went here to the NLR location it was pretty new (just opening) so they were running around like crazy and maybe a bit lost. But they did however make up for it in the end. Service was great. If I go again it will definitely be to this location and I'll try someone besides the pizza. (Bad choice) But hey maybe I'm a pizza snob."
Coleman A.,"Vilonia, AR",0,16,,2.0,2/28/2016,The food was average at best.  My burger was bland.  The wait staff kept trying to give us the food for the table beside us.  Food was cold.  When time to pay it took about 10 minutes for the waitstaff to return and get my card.  For the price you pay Wendy's is a better alternative. Its very disappointing to eat out and get okay service with just okay food
Aj F.,"Euless, TX",0,2,,2.0,4/9/2016,"We Just ate here about 5mins. ago!  We got there and had to wait 15 mins even though we could clearly see 5  tables empty and available, lol. Our waiter was the only one that was  awesome and helpful so for his service Id give it 4 stars but the food trumps the rating scale and I have to say it was lacking... When I say lacking I mean flavor, time and quality. If you thinking about eating here do yourself a favor and drive the extra mile or 2 and find something else. Or even eat your wife's cooking.(She wrote the last sentence, not me)"
Jeff N.,"Irmo, SC",3,84,17,4.0,11/11/2015,"Ate dinner tonight at BJ's. When I walked in they were packed and it was Thursday night. They told me a fifteen minute wait but I was taken to my seat in about 2 minutes. I had pizza -BJ Famous, wings and the beignet. All the food was good and my server Christopher was good. The only problem is he was crazy busy and did not have enough time talk much. This was my first time and was trying to get a feel for the place. I would definitely come back, they could use some more servers."
Paul H.,"Fayetteville, AR",0,10,,1.0,4/2/2017,"I've been to BJ's in other cities but have never encountered anything like we experienced in this BJs. We arrived with about an hour and a quarter to eat. Since the restaurant was not busy we felt we had plenty of time. After forty five minutes I had to search for our server and try and get dinner. By the time our dinner arrived we only had twenty minutes to eat. My prime rib and asparagus were not warm, they had probably been sitting out on the counter waiting for our disappearing server to pick them up. After complaining the manager gave us a fifty percent discount on two of the dinners. That was appreciated but didn't make this situation more pleasant. In addition, since we were running late we asked that the dessert that was included with our meal be served right away. It didn't arrive for quite a while and we weren't able to eat it before we had to leave. One last note, my baked potato was never served. Avoid this restaurant, we will never return here."
Peter M.,"Cabot, AR",60,42,6,5.0,9/11/2015,"My wife and I have known and loved BJ's for the last few years, so we were really excited when we saw they were building one on McCain. This location lives up to the brand we know. First, let me say that the building is really sharp. I know BJ's is a chain, so the atmosphere is a little cookie-cutter, but the actual building has nice high celings and big windows, and its just...nice. I like new, clean spaces. The food was great, as expected. We had the Carnitas Fries and Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts to start. Both were great, but a little acidic. I think the Carnitas Fries would be better with a dollop of sour cream. We shared a pizza for our entree. The deep dish was fantastic. We got half spicy Hawaiian, which was amazing, and half Mediterranean, which was a little too salty, but well-meaning. We finished with the S'Mores Pizookie (HATE the cheesy name, but that's hardly a serious issue). It can only be summed up with one word: FUGGEDDABOUTIT. You can't talk about BJ's witjout mentioning the beer. But there's not much to say. It's great, classic microbrew in a refreshing variety of styles. A beer for every taste, and they're all top notch. Service was great. Our server made some recommendations, and gave her honest opinion about the questions we asked. She was friendly, outgoing, prompt, and not too perky or upsell-hungry--everything you want in a server and nothing you don't. My wife and I like a sure thing when we go out, and BJ's is always a sure thing, and a welcome addition to this neighborhood."
Nikki G.,"Little Rock, AR",33,12,1,5.0,9/11/2015,I've been to BJs on the other side of LR so for it to be close to me everyday? Yes! My fav dish is the grilled shrimp tacos- my kiddo had the spaghetti. We've also had the siracha queso dip which was good but could be more dip or less in price. Still- overall BJs is warmly welcomed to the NLR community! The curbside takeout is super convenient when you don't want to go inside.
Wiley W.,"Liberty Hill, TX",37,4,,1.0,12/31/2015,Very poor service. Waitress was slow and Manager Bruce Webb was rude other customers! I'm amazed he can hold a job in the service industry.
Elizabeth U.,"Cabot, AR",63,22,4,4.0,3/15/2016,Everything I have had from this place food wise has been amazing. I know it's ordinary food but it is done right. Drink selection is awesome. Sometimes service is lacking though.
Paul R.,"Arlington, TN",1,16,8,4.0,12/10/2015,"I had to bail on the place around the corner,  as service was atrocious. I should have come here to begin with! Great service, clean lines,  and really good food. The brew is good as well. Next time I just come to BJ's!"
Luisa L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,6,4.0,9/5/2015,"First of all, great beer! Plenty to choose from. The food here is awesome. So obsessed with the Ahi Poke appetizer. If you sit at the bar ask for Molly!!! Coolest bar tender there so far :)"
Amanda L.,"Jacksonville, AR",1,8,,4.0,7/29/2016,"I like this place for a casual meal or a place to go with friends to watch a game. The restaurant is really open with a nice bar and tvs that are always on sports. They have fun drinks and decent food with a great happy hour that has discounted beer and wine with half price mini pizzas. The menu is like a novel though, so if you have never been it might take you a while to browse everything. It might actually be better if they made the menu smaller and more focused."
Trisha D.,"South Burlington, VT",50,1,,1.0,10/19/2015,Food was average. Waitstaff got orders wrong Food came out fast. Would not recommend.
Eric J.,"Jacksonville, AR",3,5,2,4.0,1/6/2016,I went there today with my friends. The restaurant was very clean very organized the jalapeno burger that I ordered medium rare was done right. The only negative I have to say was the service was slow expecially ordering a beer that should be very easy I had to wait 5 - 10 minutes to get a beer but overall the food I give 4 stars the service I give 3 stars I will try them again with my wife and I might get better service. Overall the food made me happy. olllllllo
Dave J.,"Sheridan, AR",11,1,,2.0,12/26/2015,"We have eaten here a couple of times with the same results. The food is OK but the service is bad. We ate there on the 24th , first we sat at the table 15 minute with no water no service. Had to go ask the hostess to get us a waiter and is wasn't busy. I ordered a stake but the waiter put in the more expensive one and it really didn't have a lot of flavor. I had flat bread the first time and it was better.  We probably won't go back ."
Viv T.,"San Jose, CA",47,1,,2.0,10/16/2015,The food was good but the wait was outrageous . Not only that but we made a reservation to dine in but it was canceled even though we came before the appointment time.
Calvin K.,"Sherwood, AR",44,4,,1.0,5/4/2016,"Just downloaded the app, but ate here yesterday 05/03/2016 for lunch. I don't know why my wife and I decided to give this place a third chance though. It was her birthday and she was on a lunch break and figured that this place ran a lot better during lunch hours. We were wrong. For the appetizers we had the spinach and artichoke dip. It was the smallest serving of dip imaginable. I literally ate maybe five chips with dip, the plate was still covered with chips when the dip was finished. I highly recommend never to get that appetizer since you have to pay even more for more dip. Then my wife's Caesar salad comes out, and it's extremely wilted and brown. (Ice berg lettuce) they replace it, the manager hovered over her shoulder as he waits to hear if it's ok and it seemed to be at first. So after eating through it, there was more wilted, brown, rotted salad. The food took forever as if they only have one chef working in an establishment that big. The food was fine this time. The previous times nothing was fine. Food, service, anything. I won't ever be going back, the only way I would is if I was drunk and wanted to keep drinking, because the beer is the only thing this ""restaurant"" has somewhat to offer."
Gayle S.,"North Little Rock, AR",20,3,,2.0,8/4/2016,"We have dined at this location several times and had positive experiences. Tonight, however, we had a less than enjoyable meal. My husband ordered a ribeye with a baked potato and broccoli. He enjoyed the steak, but the potato was too cold to melt the butter. The server (who was pleasant and efficient) brought another, which she said had been tested and found to be 113 degrees, but it also was not at all hot. Once again, the butter would not melt. The ""side"" of broccoli consisted of four tiny florets that made an attractive garnish. When my husband pointed this out, the server brought more broccoli from the kitchen. I ordered chicken lettuce wraps as an entree.   The chicken filling was tasty, but the iceberg lettuce was unacceptable. I had to tear off lots of hard, colorless core from my lettuce leaves prior to eating. Iceberg is too brittle to use as a wrap. Butter lettuce would be far better. We hope that kitchen problems will be corrected, as BJ's is usually a fun place to have happy hour or an occasional meal. We've always had good service and food prior to this visit and were quite surprised at the poor quality of the meal today."
Steven G.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,2,,1.0,9/2/2015,"So we didn't even get to the food. We simply asked how much a Jack and coke was, the waitress said she would find out  and 10 minutes later a few Jack and cokes arrived via the MANAGER. After explaining that we were just asking for prices, the manager told us that what we did was ""dirty"" and was frustrated that we wouldn't take the drinks. We left and went down the street to another restaurant where they knew what THEIR prices were and the whole staff was friendly."
Jason S.,"Jacksonville, AR",50,46,9,2.0,12/5/2015,"Wow, where to start the front end is ridiculous heavily loaded with people just standing there even though there were lots of open tables. After finally waiting 30 minutes for a table we were seated...the table was dirty and had to tell the hostess it needed to be cleaned she acted as if she was too good to clean it...ugh. We ordered our drinks and food and an appetizer. The appetizer never came and our drinks took forever (you have a fully functional bar!) The hostess just glared at us the whole time...pathetic and petty. We won't be back..Too bad this location doesn't have the good customer service like the LR location."
