Sara W.,"Cleveland, OH",67,44,86,4.0,11/30/2017,"OK so I love beer and I love pizza, both things that BJ's has and, I think, does well. However, I've been here a few times and every time the service was slow and a bit scattered. Let me explain what happened this last time: I came here with one of my friends to have lunch before we went shopping at the mall one Sunday afternoon. The place was kind of busy but they had a lot of servers on the floor...it looked to me like each server maybe had 3 or 4 tables (I could very well be wrong here though). My friend was already waiting at our table with waters when I got there, and explained to me that our server would come back and take our drink orders once I was ready. I really don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that we waited for at least 10 minutes before she came back. When she came around, I asked her about this beer they had on special and asked if I could try it while my friend ordered a Fathead's Holly Jolly. Our server was more than happy to bring me a tasting of the special and I ordered it since it was delish! I really don't think i'm exaggerating again when I say that it was at least another 10 minutes until she came back with my drink, and at this point my friend had already finished hers. The downside to all of this is that we hadn't even ordered our food yet and we'd already been there at least 20+ minutes.  By the time we were able to order our food, we were starving and opted to each get a side salad and split a flatbread pizza...pepperoni on all of it and banana peppers on just half. BJ's is fancy and the servers are able to put in the orders on these touchscreen pads at the table so they go straight to the bar/kitchen. Now I don't know if our server put in the pizza wrong or if the kitchen just messed up but there was only pepperoni on half and banana peppers on half. Not a huge deal since I could've done without the pepperoni anyway. Now the salads: mine was a delicious garden salad that had an abundance of different veggies, while my friend ordered the caesar...it ended up being probably half the size of what mine was.  I know I could've given BJ's a 3-star rating for this experience, but I really do like their food (when it comes out right). The service is definitely on the slower side, even when they're slow (I know because I've been there when it's slow...and they're slow). I love the space of the place, especially in the summer time when the patio is open. I will definitely go back and enjoy something from their huge menu, but I will make sure to bring a little patience with me next time. :)"
Gregg T.,"Cleveland, OH",29,63,33,3.0,11/21/2017,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is what I'm sure most of us have come to expect from one of these chain-type American brew houses; good, not great. If it were up to me, I would change the name to BJ's Brewhouse and Restaurant since the beers are definitely the stars of the show.  I went on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and was later joined by a mutual friend. We say at the bar, had a couple of beers (their house IPA is really good) and dinner. The menu is too much. I chuckled to myself when the bartender said something to the effect of ""there's 120 different items on the menu, so we have something for everyone."" While I'm sure he's just towing the company line, we all know better. A large menu doesn't typically translate into great food. BJ's was no exception.  On the off chance that I was mistaken, however, I ordered the roasted shrimp Peruvian quinoa bowl. Trust me, I've been around the proverbial block a time or two, so I know better than to try to make a place something that it isn't, but I just had to see what would be served. In all honesty, it wasn't the worst ""entree"" that I've eaten in one of these types of places. The bowl came out with about a dozen shrimp piled on a bed of sauteed spinach, tomatoes and quinoa. While the dish had way too much lemon juice (or something?), and I'm sure the shrimp were frozen, and certainly overcooked, it really wasn't all that bad all things considered. I wasn't expecting a Michelin star dish or anything.  The service was friendly, the bartender attentive, and the vibe of the place was pretty good. It's a bit out of the way for me, so I don't expect to be back at time too soon, but that said, I would return, have a beer and maybe an appetizer or two. As for the rest of the menu, it's nothing out of the ordinary."
Michael K.,"Independence, OH",0,8,,2.0,11/11/2017,Will update review ASAP but 2 times previous the pizza and salad I have been very disappointed. Why?? I have been to several BJS all good deep dish.  This place has not proofing pizza correctly. Flat flavor... Over and over.  I will try again seriously hope for better.
Tom N.,"Brook Park, OH",12,11,1,5.0,1/10/2018,The fresh Atlantic salmon was great! Came with rice asparagus. The server was good and the place is clean. Not a huge fan of the parking area though but it is what it is.
Mark N.,"North Olmsted, OH",68,12,1,5.0,1/6/2018,BJ's is close to home so I go frequently. Always friendly staff and I've never had a bad meal!
Bob L.,"Cleveland, OH",446,371,2924,4.0,5/3/2017,"I can still remember the first experience I had at a BJ's Restaurant. It was in Arlington, Texas back in 2008. I wasn't nearly as big of an annoying beer snob back then and, more importantly, I wasn't so hung up on eating healthy food. This made BJ's a pretty damn good joint for me. My wife and I loved their pumpkin spice ale and the pizookie, c'mon, nothing that good should be legal. Anyway, fast forward to 2017, we're back in Cleveland, and we'd all but forgotten about BJ's. That is until we heard they were opening a location in North Olmsted. Gods be praised. (angelic choir, light beams). Yeah, yeah. It's a chain. We all get it. While I don't go out of my way to frequent chain restaurants, I also feel that if a chain is done right, there's nothing wrong with it. More of a good thing, right? And as far as chains go, BJ's is about as polished a concept as you're likely to find. Big menu, good beer, clean and modern design. We stopped in at this location around 5pm on a Wednesday with mild trepidation and vague recollections of pizookie-induced pancreatic spasms. We were also aware of everyone's complaints about wait times, so our expectations were managed accordingly. If you've never had a BJ's experience, one of the first things you'll probably notice is the sheer size of the place. It's pretty damn big. I hadn't noticed so much in Texas because, well, because everything in Texas is freakin' big, but in tiny Great Northern plaza, BJ's is a monolithic structure of epic proportions. It still has that new restaurant smell. We were greeted by a group of smiling young ladies as soon as we entered. We were told it'd be about 30 minutes our so. A quick assessment of the surroundings and we spied seats at the bar. Wait averted. BTW, the guy working the bar was a consummate professional. Service industry folks that take pride in their job and exude confidence and friendliness are a rarity. Celebrate (and tip well) when you encounter them. Our beers were always filled, our plates cleared toot sweet, and waters without asking. Overall, service was excellent. The beer. While it's not really brewed on site at each location (they own 6 breweries in 5 states) it is really tasty, expertly brewed and styled more toward the middle of the bell curve. They've got styles to suite just about every taste - pilsner, wit, stout, IPA, pale ale, hefeweizen - and they do seasonal and limited run beers like the aforementioned pumpkin ale. I've had just about every beer they brew and they are all solid. Annoying beer geeks may knock 'em, but seriously, I have no complaints in the libation department. Besides, they've won multiple Great American Beer Festival awards so they've gotta be doing something right. The menu here is sizeable but well laid out and organized with beautiful photography. It's like it has been scientifically designed to appeal to just about everyone and, lo and behold, they've even got ""enlightened favorites"" living happily next door to the usual, more indulgent suspects. Really, it all looks and sounds great, so you'll have trouble deciding. If it were in any way possible, I'd love to try everything. We had a pizookie in our sights, so we tried to eat conservatively. Here's a rundown of our selections: Twisted BLT Salad: Probably the most disappointing dish of the meal. Baby spinach, diced tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles tossed in honey sriracha vinaigrette and topped with smoked bacon and chopped hard-boiled egg. It tasted OK, it just wasn't tossed, stingy on the dressing, and the goodies seemed in short supply. Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts: Tossed in the same/similar slightly sweet & spicy dressing as the Twisted BLT Salad, most of the sprouts were cooked properly, a nice char throughout. Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms: Mini bellas stuffed with spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Yum. These poppable apps were delicious. The lemon pesto sauce really brightened them up. Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl: I know. Way too healthy. The chicken was roasted perfectly, a nice crispy, spicy crust. The quinoa was tender, well-seasoned and plentiful, but the bed of spinach was raw instead of the advertised sauteed, the mushrooms were also nearly raw, and the ratios were just off. Enlightened Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos: The roasted salmon was cooked perfectly, the maple cumin glaze was tasty albeit quite sweet, and the broccoli slaw and candied pecans (more sugar) added nice textural elements. The side of seasonal bistro grains was OK - a cold salad of quinoa, black beans, tomatoes, corn and cucumber. The pita shells are also quite hefty, so I'm not really sure how ""enlightened"" this dish is. Tasty though. The Pizookie (small version, perfect for 2) - If you haven't had a Pizookie you haven't lived. Restaurants all over the country are emulating this dessert with its warm, sorta underbaked cookie underneath ice cream. BJs has mastered this treat."
Cliff L.,"North Olmsted, OH",23,1,,3.0,1/6/2018,Place has really good food. But the service is not good at all. Took 15 minutes for us to get are drinks then the waitress brought out 6 glasses of soda when we only ordered 3 food so she wouldn't have to keep checking on us  comes out quick as it usally does. But this time they didnt have any silverware it was a bad experience the first time we took our friend there telling him how good it was
Yasmin J.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,10,32,4.0,11/18/2017,"Heaven!!! On. A plate!! Sorry no pics, I ate them all! I got the avacodo egg rolls w dipping sauce! Amaze!! Also a salad arugala and beet w these pine nuts! Hubby got sliders  their fries were good too! Mmm the steak dinner w mashed potatoes! Garlic mashed potatoes too . And for dessert! Drumroll pleaseeeeee......pizzacookie?!?! Something like that! I'll show u! Also, so many menu options. That was a bit overwhelming, I couldn't decide! We ordered take out n it wasn't as good. But the atmosphere was really cool too. I would def go back!"
Ashley M.,"Cleveland, OH",235,348,782,4.0,3/7/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised b y this place.  I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants. But, I was literally about to eat my arm and I had never heard of this place so, we decided to give it a shot.  So glad we did. I got the seared ahi tuna salad and it was fantastic. So packed with flavor, like seriously so many flavors I couldn't put my fork down. The tuna tasted delicious and I loved the seasoning they used. The pickled cucumbers were a crunchy delicious sweet surprise. We ordered some dessert as well. I forgot what they were called. But, we ordered 3 of them. Warm gooey cookie types. One was monkey bread with vanilla ice cream, the other two were peanut butter with vanilla and the last was salted caramel with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips.  I have never enjoyed something as much as I enjoyed those 3 little deserts. Lol. My sister was actually laughing and saying she would like to motorboat them. Bravo guys, can't wait to return."
Akhilesh R.,"Westlake, OH",11,102,332,4.0,3/6/2017,"Happened to see a BJ's in Roseville and realized that this is a national chain. It was busy on a Sunday night. Seated immediately and the service was quick and efficient. The kids menu is available and the 3 items for $6.25 had a generous portion and filling for the kids.  Ultimate Long Island ice T was a concoction of various liquor with a splash of Pepsi. It was nice.  Barbacoa cauliflower tacos was very flavorful, the base was more like naan bread, this came with a quinoa based cold salad which was quite tasty. Peruvian quinoa with shrimp was a little bland however the shrimp was cooked perfectly and nicely spiced.  The menu is extensive and some items are repeated to bulken up the menu book."
Joey W.,"Parma Heights, OH",7,20,36,4.0,7/31/2017,"Me and my buddy were meeting up at the mall for dinner but we were not sure where to go. He suggested here because they have a diverse menu, ""which can be bad and good"". After deciding to go here we started ourselves on the patio outside. We went ahead and ordered some beer which was delicious! Hefeweizen was our choice. After looking over the menu and unsure what we wanted he suggested the avocado egg rolls, my oh my how they exceeded my expectations, very delicious, flavorful with a great spicy mayo or some sort of spicy condiment inside served with a thick teriyaki hybrid dipping sauce. For our meal we both went with the same thing although it technically was not a menu item. We had ordered the chicken fried burger, but substituted with the Nashville hot chicken breast. It was topped with Monterey Jack, a fried egg, sausage gravy, tomato and avocado. It was tasty and VERY messy, however there was so much going on with this sandwich that all the flavors mashed together and nothing was too distinct. But then again we are the ones that altered our sandwiches. I will say it was filling and very tasty, just not as much flavor depth as I wanted due to so many ingredients on the sandwich.  I will say that I will be returning though!"
Nikki T.,"Cleveland, OH",3,60,57,4.0,10/27/2017,Large menu with tasty food. Also their pineapple moscow mule and long islands are pretty good. Nice outdoor area and modern interior. This place is good for a casual meal.
Victoria H.,"Parma, OH",37,10,4,5.0,11/21/2017,"Soo we came here for my son's  21 am We orderd the flight of beers , papas an drinks, even though We waited a half hour after making a 630  reservation. The food is very good  t her service was very good. The atmosphere  is very Good ,..im glad we decided on this place for my sons 21!"
Eveline Q.,"Cleveland, OH",0,9,,5.0,1/7/2018,"I love this place. It has a great atmosphere, and a great menu. Servers are always very friendly."
Patrick J.,"Lakewood, OH",85,24,26,2.0,10/7/2017,The manager reached out and wanted to make it right because the last visit here they were out of both the prime rib and pork chop. So about a month later I came back and tried ordering the prime rib again. This time I came at 730p on Saturday. They were out again hahahahahah. Its so hilarious I came in with low expectations so I wouldn't get upset.  I give up. :( By the way I ordered the pork chop this time because they weren't out yet.
Amanda F.,"Westlake, OH",79,34,20,3.0,7/11/2017,"We have visited this restaurant in Columbus before but it just recently opened in North Olmsted. The food is pretty good, especially for a brew house, but definitely American, regardless of what you order. The menu is quite large but don't let that fool you- its half beer. The Mahi Mahi and Jambalaya were both delicious. Reasonable prices and its massive inside."
Jodi L.,"Wooster, OH",69,66,6,5.0,12/2/2017,Love the chicken flatbread. Extensive beer and food menus. The pizookie is phenomenal-get the s'mores one. I believe they are discounted after a certain time in the evening. They offer a variety of seating options for small and large groups!
Karen R.,"Cleveland, OH",19,191,132,4.0,4/12/2017,"I am not a fan of chain restaurants and try to eat and shop locally. However, I was meeting friends who had arranged BJs as our meeting place.  The food was decent although I can judge only on the artichoke appetizer. What really made this place stand out though is our server Ryan. If ever I go back I would request him. He was charming, funny and helpful with suggestions. Ryan is what made me give four instead of three stars."
Me So Hungryy Y.,"Westlake, OH",1,80,97,3.0,5/22/2017,"Packed Friday nite. Cool server dude. My turkey dip was kinda plain.. still enjoyed it.  Tomato mozzarella salad is De-ludicrous! ..That good.  Wife's tacos Ok, and mystery side dish was tasty.. I crushed it.  Moms small plate of creamy couscous mac n cheese was indeed small!! And kinda burnt (I woulda sent it back) -she liked it.  Broccoli cheese soup not appetizing.  Special teas were just fair.  Not great but 'Owl be Bock!'"
Drew E.,"Westlake, OH",35,29,25,2.0,8/21/2017,"Super disappointed with this branch of the chain. We visited one in Florida and had a really good experience.  Not so much at this one. Not that it affected my food but the floors were slippery like someone had left soap on them. That was the initial impression. Not the best start. The wait staff seemed pretty burnt out and they were busy. Our waiter was probably one of the best and made sure our appetizer came out on time and our drink orders were rapid. He had to go get the chili to go with our queso because the kitchen didn't put much in but he made it right.  I got a flight of beers and it was good. Wife's mixed beverage was overpriced and weak.  Entrees were a big disappointment. Seared ahi tuna salad was half-heartedly slapped in a bowl and presentation looked like something I could have done at home. Tuna was chewy in several places and wasabi crust was not evenly distributed. I ordered this dish because I had it once before and it was awesome...not so much here. Greens were not rinsed well and led to an overall disappointing meal. Pizza was average, piadina was average...average average average.  When shelling out $100 plus for a family dinner, there are 10 other places in the immediate area I would recommend over this place."
Andy E.,"Glen Allen, VA",8,284,63,4.0,3/17/2017,"This is my new favorite brew pub in Olmsted. Great beer and great food.  They offer their own beer (they make a killer hefeweissen) as well as other popular microbrews and national brands. The food menu is extensive - with everything from pub grub to salads to Asian dishes to ribs to sandwiches to steak...and the list goes on. During my recent visits I enjoyed the fish tacos and the spicy Asian peanut noodle dish with chicken. Both were outstanding and paired perfectly with my hefe.  The decor is classy, the bar area is large with plenty of seating, and there are a bunch of wide screen TVs showing whatever sporting event is on at the time. The dining area can fill up quickly, so expect a bit of a wait for a table on the weekends. Seating in the bar area is open."
Michele R.,"Cleveland, OH",67,252,47,3.0,3/21/2017,"I enjoyed my meal at BJ's, but for some reason I'm feeling like I wont be back. I can't quite put my finger on it. I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. They were a good size (you get 2 per order) and had lots of flavor. It was served with a side of grains (rice, red quinoa, cous cous maybe?, cherries?) It was different, but very good. Nothing bland about this meal! My iced tea was fresh and I was content with the price. My friends also seemed happy with their Ahi (Tuna) Poke Bowl and Artichoke Tavern pizza. A stand-out appetizer: The Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts. Wow. So delicious. Crispy and spicy and flavorful! Our server was a riot. Very attentive, loved her job, tried hard to sell us on the downloadable app and pazookies and very, um, present. I think what I didn't love was the menu. It was way too much to look at and decide from. Some menu options were repeated which just unnecessarily bulked up the heavy book.  Another down side is because the restaurant is in the mall parking lot, parking was scarce. On a Monday evening."
Raquel G.,"Elyria, OH",183,46,41,5.0,1/16/2017,"Everything we ordered was delicious! From the breaded asparagus, the fried brussels sprouts, the sandwich with pulled pork on top of a bbq bacon cheeseburger, the salted caramel pizookie, everything was out of this world!! I cannot wait to go back!! My mouth is watering just thinking about all that amazing food!! My boyfriend and I ordered all that to share and a flavored sparkling water, and our bill was about $35. We left full and satisfied."
Sabrina H.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",0,26,1,4.0,11/26/2017,I enjoy this N. Olmsted location. The table with the fire on the outside patio is a nice touch. I love the service and food. The chicken dishes are really good. The stuffed mushroom appetizer is amazing. I want to go back!
Kerry A.,"Lakewood, OH",85,106,92,5.0,12/30/2016,"BJ's Brewhouse is exactly the type of place that this area needs. Located right in front of a mall, all you usually see here are chain restaurants that all feel the same. BJ's is different though. With a huge menu and a great selection of beers, you really can't go wrong here!       I have heard a lot of hype about this place recently, as it just opened, so I had to try it for myself. Being in front of a mall, parking was a nightmare. I drove around and turned around 3 times in mall traffic before I finally gave up and made my own parking spot. Once we got inside, the place was decently crowded but we were seated right away.       There is plenty of seating inside, an outdoor patio for warmer weather, and a decent sized bar. The atmosphere is very comfortable and what you might expect from a brewhouse. The hosts and our server were all very friendly, so no complaints there. While we were eating, food runners came up to us two times with food that wasn't ours (before we ordered, just meant for another table). I chalk this up to just opening and serves not yet having the hang of the table numbering. Nothing major.       As for food, they have pretty much anything you could want. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious. It came with tortilla chips and was exactly what I wanted. My mom and I both ordered a soup and salad combo, with tomato basil soup in a bread bowl (2.75ish surcharge). The soup was delicious and the bread bowl was amazing. The top of it was toasted and tasted like garlic bread. On the side, I got a Caesar salad and my mom got the wedge salad. Both were very good.       They have a great selection of house brewed beers, as well as cocktails and many other drinks. I went for their house brewed IPA and was very pleased. It was very smooth and went well with the food I was eating. Overall, this was a great experience and I will definitely be back soon!"
Christina M.,"Strongsville, OH",53,5,13,4.0,11/14/2017,"Have been here twice now for lunch and both times have been great! Both in the dining room and seated at the bar we have had great friendly service. The memu selection is huge! I haven't stopped raving about the Tomato amd Mozzarella salad since I had it! Also, as strange as this may sound,  the Hot Ham and cheese sandwich is the best I've ever had! The alfredo sauce on it gives it a unique twist and it really works! 4 stars only because my friend was brought the wrong food but they fixed the problem immediately and efficiently. Mistakes happen and we understand that! Will definitely be back soon!"
Chris K.,"North Olmsted, OH",75,67,12,2.0,9/16/2017,"Not my first visit here, but it's time for a review. First visit, shortly after they opened was fine. Each subsequent visit has gotten worse. Today was the icing on the cake.  In for a very late (3 pm) lunch. Not very many patrons, plenty of wait staff. Seated for several minutes before the server came to our table. That's as good as the visit got. Lukewarm cheese sticks with about a tablespoon of marinara. We asked politely for more marinara, and my wife ordered a specialty tea. When the tea came, the glass was maybe 3/4 full. It was a basic iced herbal tea, and my wife wanted sugar. Okay, we'll ask when the additional marinara comes. Nope. No sign of marinara ten minutes later. No sugar (or salt and or pepper) at the table. Twenty minutes after ordering, we still haven't seen our main course, two hard-to-prepare salads. My wife was trying to be patient so we waited. Good thing, since our server was chilling against an empty table for at least ten minutes while we were waiting. It was apparently the thing to do. I like bucking the system, though. We asked for the manager. When we asked for our check, he apologized and covered our cold appetizer but didn't really seem surprised.  Every aspect of this visit was miserable. With ample dining choices in the area, we may have visited for our last time."
Rob H.,"North Olmsted, OH",4,56,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Update: I can now officially say I am completely disappointed by this place. The case of BJ's is why I generally hold off judgement of a place until some months pass and their true colors come out. We went there on their burger night and they simply could not do anything but char my burger after two attempts I said I'd just get something else. Third attempt mahi mahi tacos. Guess what that was overcooked too. This place just kind of is not great and is way over priced for what you get. It is unlikely I'll be back.  The place has exciting sounds and visuals. The server we had was wonderful and generally seemed to care about how much we enjoyed our experience. I do however echo some of the sentiments of other reviewers. The menu is huge which is good for choice, but you know all that stuff isn't made fresh. Also, it is a little pricey the ""Bj's"" brew i had was nearly six bucks. The food was ok. Overall I think it is an ok place. I am glad to have another option close by.  Just visited again and got a ""sweet baby Jesus beer 7.95 WHAT? Get out of here. The beer prices are jut insane and at least part of the reason I am not a regular. I will say I respect their desire to make things right. I cannot always say that about other places."
Jeff E.,"Youngstown, OH",0,4,1,4.0,12/16/2017,"The appetizers were amazing and had a great selection of beers on tap.  Did. It try any of the entrees, but they looked delicious as well.  I have four stars because I didn't try the entrees and the wait time was crazy."
Adam M.,"Cleveland, OH",0,7,,2.0,7/17/2017,"It's a cool place. I had one very cool server on my first trip, Dino. I remember his name because he was so flamboyant, I mean that in a good way. Like he actually wanted to be our server.  The food was pretty good. Not great.  Second visit was pretty terrible. Our waitress was obviously just having an off day, and I get that. Food took 45 mins. They were not that busy. I know how long it takes to make some chicken tenders with fries, boneless buffalo wings and a salad. It's much less than 45 mins. The fact that my food was cold makes me think it was the waitress and not the kitchen, but who knows.  Overall I wouldn't choose this place as my first choice. The menu is like the Bible, and there is no reasonable way to offer that vast of a variety of ""fresh"" food.  Wouldn't avoid like the plague, mostly because of Dino being so cool on my first visit."
Michaella H.,"Lakewood, OH",144,18,7,4.0,11/14/2017,Only giving 4 stars because of the food. Ahi Tuna salad was perfect... beyond expectations actually. My friend got the thin crust pizza which was amazing and not too heavy!!
Anne H.,"Cleveland, OH",0,7,,4.0,9/26/2017,"Enjoyed a nice meal this evening at Bj's. We make a point to go on Tuesdays for the wine specials. They have a good selection at half off. Our hostess greeted us warmly and really took time to seat us in an area that we preferred. Our server Ryan was top notch. Poured our wine with the skill of a sommelier. He was, accommodating. Checked on us throughout the meal without being intrusive. Genuinely kind person!!! It's a busy place  to be sure but the staff treat you Well!  The salmon was nicely seasoned and grilled right. The kale and Brussels sprout  salad is my favorite. They have hearty selections and terrific healthy selections too. Try it!!!!!"
Heather B.,"Avon, OH",81,89,84,4.0,1/24/2017,"Great atmosphere and food. Our server was very attentive and helpful. The only thing I didn't like is that the floor was slick everywhere as if it was oiled. Dangerous! I have the bison burger which I would certainly have again. My companions also enjoyed their meals and remarked that they liked this as a future option to meet up as well. The bar was nice and even with the high ceiling and warehouse feel, it wasn't overly loud like Yardhouse gets."
Kristen C.,"Avon Lake, OH",6,79,4,5.0,1/12/2017,"I love love love BJ's!! I've frequented this chain both in Florida and Columbus, OH and I've never been disappointed. The North Olmsted location delivers just as well! The ambiance of the location is fantastic - it's a large and usually crowded restaurant but I never find it overly noisy, which is nice.  The menu is extensive and I have tried many things including the jumbo meatballs and spaghetti, hickory brisket and bacon cheeseburger (SO good), almost all of their chicken dishes, and their steaks. I've not had a bad meal here yet. I HIGHLY recommend the chips and salsa appetizer. Their waitstaff is friendly and personable and their prices are reasonable. I'll agree with other reviewers who say that the wait for food to come out can be lengthy. I don't find it overly long to the point that I get annoyed but this certainly isn't a restaurant that you should choose if you're in a hurry."
Jess F.,"Strongsville, OH",41,154,453,4.0,1/29/2017,"We have been a huge fan of the BJ's franchise in Columbus and despite the negative Yelp reviews were looking forward to trying this location too. We arrived on Saturday night at 6pm and the place was packed and we were told about an hour to 90 minutes for a table for 2.  Pretty typical when you don't make reservations on a Saturday.  Luckily while we were grabbing drinks from the bar 2 seats opened up.  We ordered avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, a  crispy jalapeno burger, and parmesan crusted chicken.  After about 20 minutes our dinners showed up and we told the food runner we were still waiting on our appetizers - a few minutes later our appetizers arrived.  The bartender came over to apologize and then sent the manager over to apologize - and ended up  taking off one of the appetizers from our bill which I thought was a nice way to handle the situation. The stuffed mushrooms were just Ok - probably a 2 star item.  They were bland and no particular flavor stood out.  The avocado egg rolls were fantastic & I would recommend.  I loved the crispy jalapeno burger - 5 stars - (Fried jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro on a toasted bun) and it was cooked to perfection.  The parmesan crusted chicken - 5 stars - (Topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli). We also tried the skinny margarita (5 stars) and you can't go wrong with any of their in house craft beers.  If you download the app and join their loyalty program you receive a free pizookie! I would recommend downloading the app to add your name to the waitlist before arriving to the restaurant.  We never got the text that our table was ready until we were in the car on the ride home - thankfully those 2 spots opened up at the bar or we would've been waiting the full 90 minutes. Side note for those with gluten sensitivities - I did notice many items were gluten free & they did offer gluten free buns for $1 up charge."
Denise M.,"Elyria, OH",4,63,147,5.0,1/20/2017,"We have nothing bad to say about BJ's Brewhouse. We did not order the Brussels sprouts appetizer though it took all our might not to! Hubby had the Jalapeño Burger medium rare and I had the BBQ Brisket Burger medium rare. We both loved, loved, loved our meals. Our fries were smoking hot. Our burgers perfectly done. The brioche Burger buns were soft and fresh.  The White Chocolate Macadamia pizookie was warm and delicious! Our waitress was friendly and on point. We will most certainly be going back!"
Cortney M.,"Lakewood, OH",49,10,,1.0,12/26/2016,"The Monday half-priced deep dish pizza was amazing. However, the service was terrible.  We waited almost forty minutes for our food and after our leftovers were boxed, it took over thirty minutes to get our correct check. The entire agonizing experience was almost two hours. The waitress also bumped into me with her tray, multiple times.  When you start a new with lunch specials and end with ""have a good evening,"" there's a big problem.  BJ's might be great in a few months, but they certainly have kinks to work out."
Debbie N.,"Cleveland, OH",0,20,41,2.0,2/11/2017,"There were 4 of us that decided to try BJ's on a Friday night - we knew we would probably have to wait for a table.  Arrived and parking was terrible.  Once inside, we had to wait about 5 minutes to put our name into the wait system.  Gave our phone number for them to text when our table was ready and was told by the hostess that our was t time was 30-40 minutes.  Then received a text saying that our war time was 40-50 minutes.  After waiting 60 minutes I walked up to the hostess table where I was told that it would be another 25-30 minutes.  A BIG difference between 30 and 90 minutes!   On to the food: Our orders were Fish and Chips, hamburger, pasta and California Chicken club. The food was average at best.   Pasta, for some reason had a stalk of celery in it, however the flavor was ok Hamburger had virtually no flavor at all Fish and Chips were ok California Chicken club was average, although the chicken was a little dry On the plus side - French fries were amazing, we got a pizookie which was delicious and the server (I wish I remembered her name) was excellent."
Cory M.,"North Royalton, OH",206,17,1,4.0,2/21/2017,"I visited a couple weeks ago with my family. We went on a Sunday around 5:30, the wait was about 20 minutes for a party of 7. After we got seated, around 6:16/6:30, the crowd REALLY started showing up! The service was pretty good, I cannot remember our servers name, but she was pretty attentive with drinks and quickly taking our order. When my salad arrived, I did have to go to the hostess to get silverware for myself and my family. When we did receive our silverware, I'm assuming they were waiting on them to get out of the dryer/dishwasher because all of our napkins were damp.  BUT the food was awesome. I had the California Chicken Club and LOVED it. A couple of my family members had the salmon quinoa bowl & really enjoyed it, and another couple had the bacon burger! The BEST food were hands down the French Fries. In mine and my husbands opinion...the best fries we've EVER had! Can't wait to be back, just for the fries!  Food was a 5 star, only giving a 4 star due to all 7 bundles of napkins being damp, just wasn't a great feeling!"
Mary J.,"North Olmsted, OH",1,25,3,3.0,3/20/2017,"Food is good.  Portions are reasonable.  The staff was okay, not the best but I think working on it. Too bad they decided to put it where they did.  Parking is lousy."
