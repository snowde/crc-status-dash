Amanda O.,"Rocky River, OH",0,2,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Bruh. This place is awful. We made reservations and still waited a half hour. When we sat down the waiter was friendly and took our drink orders. 15 minutes later, he showed up with HALF of our table's order. (We had 4 people) so we told him and he said he would have them ""right away!"" 15 more minutes later, he shows up with the remaining two drinks and then takes our orders. I ordered some bacon guacamole burger and asked that they do not include the jalapeños. My beer tasted like someone had diluted it with water and my friends drink didn't even have the alcohol in it. Our food arrived 40 minutes after we ordered. My burger wasn't that great and it had the damn jalapeños on it. When we went to pay for our meal, we paid cash and the server never brought us back our change ASSUMING the remainder of the cash was his tip (which was the plan but it was rude to take ALL of it.) we won't be back. This place reminded me of why we don't eat at chains."
Shawn K.,"Elyria, OH",0,4,1,1.0,1/29/2017,"Average chain restaurant trying to be disgusted as a micro brew pub!  Service was very slow and although I wanted to like our waitress Amber, she did a mediocre job at best.  My beer should not stay empty for over ten minutes before asking if I want another.  Several tables seated after us received their food before we did.  There are carpet runners throughout entire place because the tile floor is so slippery.  Menu is large and my Mahi Mahi tacos were extremely good, unfortunately the chips that came with were swimming in grease and a big let down.  What really put me over the edge of not wanting to go back was the wannabe hipster manager with the beard that walked out from the kitchen chewing on food and wiping his mouth while carrying some customers food, very gross and borderline disgusting!  The decor at first glance looks great but after you sit for a few minutes you notice everything is so fake and a really cheaply done.  The fake brick wall paper, is well, fake brick wall paper.  Very cheesy!  I am really let down because I was so looking forward to going.  Pricing was reasonable, although I'd rather pay a few dollars more and go to a real micro brew pub."
