Jim C.,"Cleveland, OH",1,70,2,3.0,8/2/2017,"Nice patio which is open seating!  Pricey but join their club and you'll get some BOGO coupons sent.  Makes it reasonable. Decent beer but during Happy Hour, buck off."
Michael M.,"Lakewood, OH",0,7,2,3.0,8/20/2017,"Thank goodness for the Pizookie or I would never come back. Don't know who runs this shack but the service leaves much to be desired, slow, not super courteous, just didn't seem happy to be here. Was drinkless for about half my meal. BBQ brisket burger was really good. The spaghetti and meatballs was good but nothing to write home about. I thought I was supposed to get a salad but the server never said anything so I guess not. Other locations have been great. Must be New management and working on changing the culture."
Anne R.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",10,20,,2.0,3/25/2017,"We like to try new places. We are not too impressed. The service was so so, prices pretty high, food ok, but I expected more, and the ambiance wasn't to my liking."
Jane M.,"North Olmsted, OH",7,6,2,5.0,9/3/2017,"OMG! My new favorite place to go. A very diverse menu and the service is outstanding. GREAT drinks too. Good atmosphere. We just love, love this place.!"
Diane B.,"Westlake, OH",8,10,,5.0,8/12/2017,Love this place.  It has almost anything you're hungry for.  I am a picky eater and like to eat on the healthier side.  They have many healthy vegetarian dishes to choose from along with a full range of great beers!!
Walleye W.,"Put-in-Bay, OH",0,42,1,4.0,7/20/2017,"Very good service from our server, Dino. Very nice and on top of all our needs. Our bill was 38 bucks and change, which I did not feel was overpriced for all that for all we ordered. That included a beer each, a shared app, two sandwiches and a shared pizookie. ( Which was worth a return in itself). All of our food was good, service was great and our waters were never allowed to get empty. Both of our beers were BJ brands and were both well done. I can't really say anything that was bad but I can't say it was a solid 5 star. I only reserve those for the very best but if there was a  4 1/2 star rating I would give it to them."
Henry C.,"Rocky River, OH",1,15,,5.0,2/21/2017,"Three of us went in on a Saturday for lunch. We started with the tortilla soup and the root beer wings. We then got the French Dip and the California Chicken Club. Everything was incredible! The service was in point, just need a little more ice.  Cannot wait to go back and try something new."
Debra H.,"Auckland CBD, Auckland, New Zealand",2,18,,3.0,6/19/2017,"I reluctantly gave 3 stars but probably 2 might have been more accurate.  We sat at the bar while waiting for a table. The bar person was one of the rudest people I have ever come across.  Usually people in the US are so nice and friendly but this guy made me feel like I was imposing by being there. We got a table.  The server was lovely and very obliging.  The food was fantastic - we were there on half off pizza night.  However my daughter ordered a salad with dressing on the side and it took over 20 minutes from when the salad arrived to when the dressing arrived.  Disappointing.  As much as we like the food, I would think twice before putting myself in a situation with such bad bar service."
Larry J.,"North Royalton, OH",0,19,1,4.0,10/19/2017,Absolutely recommend this place.  The prime rib sandwich was melt-in-your-mouth tasty.  Cheese curds appetizer was on par with what I had in Madison WI earlier this week.  Pot stickers also very tasty.
Rob L.,"Parma Heights, OH",2,27,12,3.0,6/22/2017,Went there on fathers day with family we had reservations but they could not find it. The manager did get us a table pretty quick though. The food was not bad and I did try one of there ipa's and I was not bad either. Huge menu prices are okay and the food is not bad.
Breanna L.,"Avon, OH",72,28,7,5.0,6/11/2017,"Four of us went here for the cavs play off game Friday night. We were expecting it to be packed but luckily they seated us right away. Mariah was our server and she was so friendly! We took up one of her tables for four hours so of course we tipped more than 20% but she honestly deserved every bit of it. She always made sure our drinks were filled, had more ranch then we needed without us even asking, and her personality is why I chose 5 stars. She was super personable and always had a smile on her face. The food was really good too. Their wings were incredible and one of our friends had the prime rib and ate every bit of it. The mojitos were one of the best I've ever had. Absolutely no complaints. Definitely will be back!"
Krystal T.,"Lorain, OH",28,5,4,1.0,5/11/2017,"If this place could get 0 stars it sure would. I have been to a few bjs that have been incredible both food and service.   Today was some of he worst service I have had in a very long time. I went there today with a girlfriend and my 2 daughters. We wanted to honor our girls day tradition of getting to have dessert before our meal.  We sat down in a not to busy restaurant only to wait 15 mins to even have our server show up to great us. That is where she left one small drink napkin. We ordered our drinks and our dessert. She returned with drinks and quickly left to tend to the table of four business men behind us. Our dessert came and we only hand the spoons given to us to eat with and a single tinny napkin to clean two small children with. Then my friend decided that she wanted a berry hibiscus tea which I guess just came out today. The tea was totally forgotten then when we asked about it there was major attitude like she never ordered it, but it was the server who forgot about it The sunset peach and the berry tea were so bland with little to no flavor. We got our appetizer and still had no napkins or silverware. By the time we finally got them our avocado egg rolls were very cold. Food came and was missing things or had things we requested not to. The Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were ordered with on onion and came with them. My salad the BBQ chicken chopped salad came with no dressing at all. We finally got the manager and asked for her to help correct the wrongs. We told her that we were sorry to bother her but our server did not seam to be able to attend to us. The manager said sorry and that was it. By then I was just ready to leave. The server came with the check. She had to swipe the card at the table and leave to retrieve our paper to sign. She was gone like 5 mins. The manager stopped once more and asked how it was we responded with ok I guess. And she left again. We left and stopped the manager once more on our way out. We told her that the food was ok and the service was the worst since our server wanted to ignore us and pay attention to the businessmen. She said well come back and see me again ask for me then as an after thought gave me her name. I can tell you that im not rushing back. I fell like I could have lit my money on fire and gotten more pleasure from that then spending it here."
Taylor L.,"Freeport, FL",26,11,,3.0,7/10/2017,"Cute restaurant, love the format and layout of the place. Many options for food, almost too much! We have tried and tried many different meals here, and nothing seems to be good. Disappointed with flavor of food. I do, however, love the way they serve the children's meals with a fruit starter and bread."
Angie H.,"North Olmsted, OH",70,1,1,1.0,5/24/2017,"Stood by the host stand for well over 5 minutes and had multiple employees walk by without even acknowledging us. Guarantee with service like that, you wont be open much longer."
Allison G.,"North Ridgeville, OH",41,16,1,1.0,6/30/2017,"The food here is wonderful! We haven't been disappointed with anything we have ordered. Beer is great. Atmosphere is great. I'm giving a poor review because the service is a hot mess. I've been brought wrong dishes, wrong beverages, dirty plates, no silverware and I'm now 45 minutes into waiting on a deep dish pizza. If they can work out the kinks, this place will be a gem.  Update: We went back one month later because we just love the food, but... that service again.  We arrived at 8pm and did not get drinks until 8:30. Salads came out at 8:45 and food came out at 9:15. We received our checks by 10 and got out by 10:15 pm. Their kitchen was slow, the wait staff forgot about us, and despite the great food we have decided that we are done with this place. Sorry BJs- you lost a couple of regulars that will spend their money somewhere that values customers."
Joshua S.,"Cleveland, OH",1,10,9,5.0,6/29/2017,So very good everyone was nice great food and for the wings you might want 2 orders of 5 wings. I have had 5 wings and one huge burger and fries and the wings caused me to take half my burger home along with the fries which I partially ate as well. The meal as one was very very good. They even asked for dessert.
Racheal W.,"Brook Park, OH",0,3,1,5.0,6/22/2017,"It's been a while since I've discovered such a great restaurant that I find myself craving their food. A friend and I decided to come here on a whim because it was built at this location somewhat recently and we wanted to try something new. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. Service was fast and our waiter was helpful and knowledgeable about any questions we had. I thought they had a pretty interesting and large menu, plenty of great sounding dishes to choose from. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as our appetizer and we absolutely loved them. They were so perfect we get them every time we go! Our entrees came out quickly and we're just as delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. It easily became one of my favorites!"
Sarah H.,"Cleveland, OH",3,72,56,1.0,1/23/2017,"Horrible service by our waiter, food was very mediocre. The menu was huge, there's a lot of different options to choose from. A very so-so establishment. The ""craft drinks"" were watered down and sugary. I had to send my drink back to be remade which took 15-20 minutes. Very disappointed in my experience at BJ's in north Olmsted."
Mike R.,"Andover, OH",0,4,,1.0,5/30/2017,I thought we would try a new restaurant are friends wanted to go somewhere else and my wife and I wanted to try BJ's we should of listened to them. First thing I wanted the Double Bone IN Pork Chop the menu said after 4:00 it was 5:00 they were out of them ok bummer so i ordered Chicken Alfredo big mistake the sauce was dry and tasteless the chicken tasted like it came out of a can my wife ordered a salad with chicken on it the salad was shredded so small it looked liked it came out of a paper shredder. She had them take it back. The only thing they have going for them is the desert. This is one restaurant I won't be going back to
Daryl L.,"Cleveland, OH",5,1,1,5.0,1/10/2017,"Ate there last night for the first time with a couple friends. I know the place is new and they are still working out some kinks. Service was fast and our server was extremely nice and laid back. He took the time to explain some of the menu and suggest some of the BJ beer. The best part of my meal was dessert. I had the ""triple chocolate peanut butter smore"" absolutely amazing. I'm hopeful I can go back this weekend. The menu is huge and has something for everyone's taste."
