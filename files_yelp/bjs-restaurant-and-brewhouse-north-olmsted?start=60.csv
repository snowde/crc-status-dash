Roger P.,"Cleveland, OH",17,2,,5.0,5/24/2017,"I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile but it was always so packed and I didn't feel like waiting for an hour, fast forward to may 24th and it's finally no wait!!! I come in and am thoroughly surprised at the size of the menu. They are their own brewery and the beer is EXCELLENT. I came with 2 friends and we all ordered different things, I tried everything we ordered and every single item we ordered was superb. It's a little pricey but not overly pricey, you get what you pay for definitely. I would totally recommend this place to anybody and I will most certainly be back in the very near future."
Brittany R.,"Brook Park, OH",2,37,7,3.0,3/21/2017,"The food is good, but nothing that draws me to go there, besides the nice reward system they have. Also I love that every time we come they bring my daughter a garlic knot and some fruit! So smart considering kids are more behaved if they are not starving."
Adrienne F.,"Cleveland, OH",0,14,,2.0,1/8/2017,"First of all, the floor is so slippery that even wearing hiking boots didn't prevent my boyfriend and me from nearly falling. Later on, I saw a man with a cane completely fall and none of the staff seemed to notice or offer assistance. Even when I mentioned it, none of them cared. I'm betting if they don't close due to lawsuits within a year, they'll be lucky. The food was bland and greasy. My boyfriend tried a burger which was oily from top to bottom- even the lettuce was soggy. I had the chicken club and did not like the garlic bread, which was also soggy upon arrival at the table. The bright spot was the sriracha Brussels sprouts, but again, they were drowning in crema sauce, quite unnecessarily. Everything is overdone and not really worth the effort. Likely won't be coming back."
Jeremy H.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",95,1,,1.0,12/30/2016,As I walked up through the back. On 12-28-16 The employees were out by the dumpster yelling and screaming at each other..  It was busy got a table for two right away. Our server was awful. As soon as he walked up and greeted us all you smelled was cigarette smoke all over him!!!!! Nasty. I ordered the Thai chicken bowl ask for sauce on the  side and it came out wrong. There was hair in my girlfriend soup..  Our waiter never came and asked us how are food was or refilled our drinks.   We will not be back.
Alyse M.,"Garden City, MI",41,12,3,3.0,3/4/2017,"Burger was wayyyy over cooked and dry, fries were also. I'm assuming my food was left to dry out in the window. Wait staff was super forgettable. Only reason I would come back is for their good drink selection. Stick to other locations, You're better than this BJ's."
Janet R.,"Westlake, OH",120,43,26,4.0,3/27/2017,Great food options including healthy options. The service is pretty slow.  I was attributing it to the fact that they are a new restaurant.  But we've been there 4 times now and it is still very slow. We ordered a deep dish pizza to share and house salads. We were there for an hour before our pizza arrived.
Jeff S.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,9,2,5.0,1/10/2017,I always loved this place when I lived elsewhere and it is even better in this new spot. The bar area is much larger than most BJ's that I have been to and the beer selection is great. We got very good food as well.
Xela N.,"North Olmsted, OH",7,207,,4.0,12/13/2016,"Let's face it.  It's hard to impress 'the average Joe' these days when it comes to new dining establishments.  There is so much competition, especially when it comes to overpriced (my opinion) national chains, thus expectations are ultra high to begin with.  Really, all people want is good quality, good tasting food at fair prices.  My wife and I had been driving by the BJ's location as it was being built, wondering what kind of restaurant would be replacing 'Smokey Bones'.  We stopped by on opening day, and frankly left unimpressed.  My wife had the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which she thought was OK, but the veggies and rice were very bland in taste.  I had the Ahi Poke as my appetizer, which was gross to say the least.  The 'poke sauce' tasted rather anemic, and the tuna was bland and flavorless, and seemed to be a 'lower grade'.  It's consistency was 'way off' as well, being very soft and limp.  Which makes me wonder if it was actually tuna at all I was eating, or some other cheap seafood filler masquerading as real tuna.  At this point, I thought to myself, well at least my medium deep dish pizza is going to taste great.  Wrong!  The dough was way too chewy in spots, and clearly not baked or crispy enough.  The cheese and tomato sauce tasted processed and bland as well.  I've tasted much better frozen pizzas, truth be told!  I took the pizza home anyway, and tried re-baking it, and added my own mozzarella cheese and spices.  It tasted much better.  At least the Pizookie desserts tasted great.  On the plus side, the interior layout is top notch, with a nice mix of bar, tables, and booths.  Our server was excellent too, as was the manager, who listened to my concerns, and ultimately 'made things right'.  I will probably give this place another chance in the future, but not anytime soon. 2/21/17 We returned to this location, and gave BJ's another chance, and it turned out much better.  The shrimp tacos and calamari were good, and our server was amazing!  My guests and I had a great time, and everyone left happy.  All I can say is that if you've ever had a bad experience at a new place, go back again and give them another chance at a later date.  Oftentimes, it takes a few weeks for a new place to find it's mojo, and reach optimal service and potential.  I hereby change my original 2 star review to 4."
Ray T.,"Strongsville, OH",5,73,,3.0,2/11/2017,As much as I want to say I love BJ's it is just an average place. Been here twice now and both times I would say just average. I had Mahi Mahi tacos and they were frankly below average. Stale shells and the fish was eh. Wife had a salad and some pizza.  The pizza was average too. Decent beer selection. Location at Great Northern is decent and convenient.
John D.,"Cleveland, OH",0,4,,5.0,12/15/2016,"I've been to BJ's elsewhere and enjoyed them, so I was happy to see one open locally. I stopped in yesterday, and it's the first week of opening, so I'm sure things are still shaking out. In spite of that, service was very attentive. Food and drinks arrived quickly, and we had an enjoyable experience. In terms of the beer - I tried both of their seasonals - Grand Cru and Bourbon Barrel Stout. I enjoyed both, but the Bourbon Barrel was the superior of the two, IMO. They also brew their own NA root beer, and it's got a very flavorful blend of seasonings.  In terms of food - We did salads and the pizza. Yes, the menu's a mile thick, but if you go here and it's not for pizza, you've made a poor choice. Their pizzas are excellent. I prefer the deep dish, but the thin crust is more than passable. They also have a GF option, which I'm told is excellent."
Nicholas S.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2016,The deep dish pizza is actually pretty tasty. We had the spicy Hawaiian and I really enjoyed it. The service was abysmal. Lunch took almost 2 hours. Most of the time was waiting on our checks which were wrong. The server didn't understand the daily special on pizza. This may be a function of the new staff but is unacceptable as is. I won't be going back until they get it together.
Debra S.,"Westlake, OH",2,46,3,3.0,12/21/2016,"We've been to the Polaris BJ'S many times, so we were excited to see one go up at Great Northern. Decided on take out given the holiday shopping parking extravaganza.  Very disappointing.  The app to order pizza is confusing. We thought we were ordering 5 Cheese Pizza, but we got no cheese. Just crust with tomatoes.  The Caesar salad for $10.50 was pitiful. A couple handfuls of romaine, a few croutons and a very light sprinkle of cheese. The boneless wings were soggy, and food was cold. Apparently, no one figured out that the baked potato takes longer to make than the sandwiches and fries. Everything was done, but we had to wait 10 mins for the potato. We won't do take out there again. Too bad, because the food dining in, at least at Polaris, is always good."
Dena D.,"Cleveland, OH",0,5,,1.0,2/3/2017,I would rather go to Fat Heads and wait an hour than go back here. Food is ok and the service was awful.
Carrie K.,"Olmsted Township, OH",27,6,,4.0,12/18/2016,"We've been anxiously awaiting another dining option after Smokey Bones closed so we tried BJ's for lunch only a few days after opening. First impressions were bland. The restaurant was loud and somewhat overcompensating on staff. (I don't need a refill on my drink when it is 3/4 full). We had pretty much counted this one out after our food took forever, however once it did we changed our mind.  We ordered a burger for me (no bun, declined the gf free bun) and he got the pulled pork. I will say that was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. It was a bit greasy, but I was not ordering a burger to be healthy anyway. My husband really enjoyed the pulled pork and we both loved the fries. The prices were reasonable and we left happy. I will probably wait awhile until the staff is better trained, but I will definitely be back."
Robin A.,"Cleveland, OH",0,5,,2.0,7/24/2017,"We were very disappointed in the customer service of the host, Sam. She was extremely rude and due to her lack of clarification, we had waited 45 minutes to be seated when we were told about 20 minutes. When we asked how much longer our wait time was (after expecting to already be sat) she continued to say we were next, as minutes went by. The manager came over and sat us immediately and was confused why we weren't seated yet (as were we). The manager however was great, as was our waitress. The food was also good. Honestly though, I probably won't return. Nobody has time to wait nearly an hour due to a hostess with a poor attitude."
Richard S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,3,3.0,1/30/2017,"I've been to a few of these around the country, it performed as expected, middle of the road. Three stars says it all. Got the asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan cheese, guess the cheese was in short supply, a tiny sprinkle across the middle of the plate. The bartender was nice enough to ask how they were but really did not care to bring more cheese. Beer? It's ok. But then it's shipped from Arizona. That's according to the bartender."
Gabe S.,"Grafton, WV",0,3,,5.0,3/11/2017,Both our entrees and the appetizer tasted amazing! The fresh brew beer was excellent too. This place has a real clean vibe with interesting art work everywhere. The hostess was not friendly. It seemed like she was annoyed people were going there. Overall it was a great experience.
Sarah M.,"Cleveland, OH",3,34,1,4.0,7/22/2017,"Surprisingly great food. Especially loved their veggie options. The sriracha Brussel sprouts are not to be missed; give them a try even if you don't like normally go for them. Beer was ok, in house sodas great."
North Olmsted V.,"North Olmsted, OH",33,7,,4.0,12/16/2016,New place with a good vatiety of either hearty bar fod or light healthy options.... i  had the spicy soba noodles ...and calamari....the wife had soup and salad and chose from different soups and salads with free refills. ..... there was so mny people wotking there i expected someone to explain about this new place or even ask how everything was but they all kept to   themselves..... the food was great....
Monica C.,"Strongsville, OH",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2017,I have tried this place three times. I really wanted to like it. The food is overall good. The service is terrible. I sat at the bar each visit and the bartenders act as though they are too good for the customers. My last visit is my final visit. The bartender (I think her name was Bailey) was rude and arrogant. I was a server for years and I always said hello and treated all customers with respect. The bartenders act like it's a big bother for them to wait on customers. I won't be returning.
