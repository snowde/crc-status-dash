Kim M.,"Jefferson, OH",0,3,,5.0,3/1/2017,This was my first time dining at BJ's Steakhouse and Brewery. The food was excellent. I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls and the brisket burger. Both were tasty and the burger was huge so half went home as my midnight snack. Our server was awesome as was the rest of the staff. I'm sure we will dine there again.
Jeremy E.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",100,65,,4.0,5/22/2017,"What a menu! It reminds me of cheesecake factory (minus the desserts) in the fact that there is literally something for everyone. We had the calamari appetizer (good, not great, but dipping sauce was to die for) and the mozz sticks (better than average) and had a few of their own beers, which were very good. I had the jalapeno burger and sweet potato fries and can't complain at all. The sauce that was on the burger was amazing and I could have used more of that, but the burger was cooked just like I wanted it and the fries, which I normally don't finish, were gone because they were awesome. The others at my table also enjoyed their meals. It was a Sunday afternoon/evening, so it was busy, but there were open tables so we were a little upset that we had to wait over 30 minutes for table but not enough to take this rating down. Our server was very polite and friendly and although she didn't come by often, when she did she got us what we needed. We will go back, possibly to try the deep dish pizzas which looked pretty amazing."
Chris V.,"Lakewood, OH",0,6,,1.0,7/22/2017,Came here on a Saturday for quick bite at 4pm and half the restaurant was empty and still a 20 minute wait. Staff accordingly for a weekend.
Mark S.,"North Ridgeville, OH",8,21,,2.0,5/17/2017,"Very slow service. Drinks took 15, app took 20. Entrees took 35. No sense of urgency from staff. Rarely saw staff and never saw a manager. Disappointed."
Katie M.,"Elyria, OH",0,17,,4.0,6/25/2017,"Like any typical chain restaurant, it can be pretty loud during their peak hours. The menu has a ton to offer and everything that I've gotten there has been delicious. The prices aren't bad for the amount of food that you get."
Kate J.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,3,1,3.0,6/23/2017,"We have been here 3 times. The food was good and reasonably priced. Lots of options. We have had good service. I just don't know why all of their wine, cocktails and beer is so overpriced. Actually more than restaurants that we would consider high end. If we are planning on cocktails we will go elsewhere."
Lisa G.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,3,,5.0,6/8/2017,Went to BJ's in North Olmsted. Loved the pizza tasted. The order I got was BJ's favorite. So good. Definitely one of my favorite pizza places and will be
Tyer D.,"Lakewood, OH",0,9,,1.0,5/21/2017,Need some sort of management here. My review is based upon my inability to eat here. 30 minute wait quoted so we wait 4 adults 2 children. Then after 45 I ask where we are at and they tell me 30-40 more minutes. All the people that walked in at the same time were already sat. So we left. Thanks for wasting our time.
Dave M.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",0,6,2,4.0,5/10/2017,Fresh ingredients made for very good food.  Their beer was great especially during happy hour.  Got our food quickly and had very good service.  We will definitely be back.
Aris F.,"Cleveland, OH",1,12,,4.0,1/2/2017,"I love the interior decor of the restaurant. Drinks and food are good, prices are a little marked up but it wont break the bank. Family and kid friendly, wait staff is okay need some work but it's a newly open restaurant so it's understandable. I'd definitely come back though!"
Mike K.,"North Olmsted, OH",44,58,,3.0,12/14/2016,"The atmosphere is very friendly, energetic bar atmosphere, the menu is about 2"" thick offering pretty much any type of food you'd like. You can definitely get the ""chain style restaurant vibe"" the menu is too large to be all fresh food, I'd imagine a lot of it is frozen. The service was bad, but I won't judge them off that due to the fact they just opened 24 hours ago past my visit. The beer menu is pretty large, offering many local craft beers along with your typical ""commodity brands"". The beer that BJ's brew is decent, I personally expected mediocre beer from them since they are a chain. The menu also includes healthy variants that can be substituted for regular beef & breads. There's nothing you will get from here that you can't find at any other chain restaurant. BJ's reminds me like Yard House, it's classy higher end than an Applebee's. All in all I'd definitely go back just because it's nice to have a bar that offers more craft beers that is nearby where I live."
Lee G.,"Cleveland, OH",0,1,,1.0,4/14/2017,I visited this location in hopes of having a nice date night and it was the complete opposite. My husband ordered a Long Island which was horrible and when we said something the bartender said it's the sour mix... it's too potent. He didn't even offer to fix it or offer a different beverage. Then we ordered jambalaya and the rice was hard. We ordered avocado egg rolls and they were not cooked right and came out soggy. We ordered calamari and thank god they were cooked perfectly. The waiter then comes with another Long Island and said he added more alcohol which still didn't fix the flavor of this premium drink. They didn't come to check in or ask how the food was so we wasted $70 on food we didn't eat and drinks we could not bare to consume. What a horrible experience!
Michaela C.,"Cleveland, OH",0,6,1,2.0,12/28/2016,"I wanted to like them but nothing went right. The worst is when you give management feedback and they don't respond. Our beer was flat from the get go. Upon acknowledgement of that they have us new beers. But later we realized we were charged for the noncarbonated beers. When we complained our server told us there was nothing she could do. We attempted to escalate but it would have been the third time we spoke with management so there was no point in waiting. Our food took forever. We had the kids so we ordered theirs first, shortly after our app and then our food. Their food looked and was excellent hence the 2 stars. Wish I could give more on that account. Our food forever took another 30 mins for a super basic/cold queso app. And then another 40 mins after that for our food, a California flatbread and spicy pig tavern pizza. His actually looked great. Mine had more brown avocado than green. It was just frustrating to try and explain to management the slow service and food and just have them stare with no response. Seems like super young and inexperienced staff all throughout from management, servers and kitchen."
Tim S.,"Elyria, OH",25,3,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Have eaten as BJ's locations throughout the country. Was happy to see one coming in nearby. Made trek out there today. Was a disaster in every way. From the hostesses to the servers, no one presented themselves in a customer-friendly way. After more than an hour in the restaurant, I finally received my food...only to be brought something that wasn't what was ordered. Given my positive experience with other BJ's, I'll give them another chance. But if I had to lay odds today, I'd bet this location closes within a year."
Cathy F.,"Berea, OH",0,1,,5.0,1/3/2017,"We were excited to see BJ's was finally open.  We called ahead so we wouldn't have to wait to long, which worked out great.  We had the wasabi Brussel Sprouts - which was excellent    My daughter had the Seared Ahi Tuna salad which she truly enjoyed, I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - which was delicious.  My husband really enjoyed the Chicken Club Sandwich and fries.  They both enjoyed a few of the craft beers.   Service was great.  It was a little higher priced but much better quality food than Applebee's.  Loved the extensive menu and are definitely planning to return."
Marty C.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,9,,1.0,12/23/2016,"Just plain rude! My wife just finished her nights shift at the hospital and stopped by to pick up some gift cards. It was around 10:15am and workers were arriving and she walked in and said she just need to pick up some gift card, they said they're closed and to come back at 11am. How about we don't come back at all! Who the hell says that? Especially at this time of year and with a brand new business."
Melodie W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",2,10,1,3.0,3/22/2017,"Went to eat here with my husband and another couple. The wife had the pepperoni extreme flat bread. She said it didn't have as much pepperoni as the location in Canton. The husband had the blacken salmon and he said it was good. My husband had the brisket burger and fries. He said it was good. I had the triple decker sandwich with fries. The sandwich was to have Italian dressing on it. It was on the hoagie bread but not on the meat. Very dry. The fries I had were very good. I asked for water with lots of ice and that is what I received. The restaurant didn't seem crowded, we were seated right away. But we had to park almost to the exit driveway to Brookpark  Rd. There was nothing outstanding about the food."
Gee W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",2,5,,3.0,3/22/2017,"We were a party of 4 having a 6:30 pm dinner (Wednesday).  Tomato bisque soup was very good with subtle flavor.  Our meals: bacon brisket burger, pizza, blacken salmon and triple deck sandwich were all good and tasty, but nothing really special to rave about.  The bbq sauce on the burger was very good. The pictures at the top are just what our meals looked like when served so I think they represent very closely the look of all the meals served.   Tho the restaurant was not crowded, as others have noted, finding a parking spot within 3 aisles of either side of BJ's is near impossible with the mall entrances so close.  We finally found a spot near the shopping center entrance on brkpk rd.   Our server must be new as she couldn't answer some of our questions on drink prices or menu items. Food was presented in a reasonable time after we placed our order.  The menu is a tome about the size of war and peace...and took us a bit to look it over. Meanwhile our server kept coming back every couple of minutes asking if we were ready to order.  I guess she thought we'd been here before and would know what they offered. So in my opinion, this is just another chain restaurant in the area to choose from.  Nothing special other than the beer selection to set it apart from other restaurants in the mall area."
Terri K.,"Cleveland, OH",27,1,,5.0,3/5/2017,"I've benn there twice and so far so good. I have gotten take out twice for their crispy hobey sriracha brussel sprouts...those are to die for! I crave them, I  will keep going back just for the brussel sprouts! Keep up the good work, perfection takes time and practice."
Bob J.,"Elyria, OH",0,8,,2.0,12/13/2016,"BS over priced chain.  Beer is good but over priced.  No samples allowed, a mouthful will cost you just to try before you commit to a full.  I'm not impressed.  It's just a copy of Yard house or other chains."
