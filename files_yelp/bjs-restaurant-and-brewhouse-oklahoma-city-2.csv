Matt M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",430,1101,252,4.0,12/13/2017,"Here I am, a solid foe of chain restaurants in general, writing a good (albeit not five star) review for a (!!!) chain restaurant. Oy. I went here with one of my nieces after she kept begging me to stop in here with her. (I have a hard, guncly crust, but -- at the end of the day -- this guncle is essentially a big old softie.) I was impressed by the selection of craft beers and hard ciders, and ended up settling on a Jalapeño Burger with fries. (My niece had her usual nachos, and THAT made her as happy as a little pig in shit.) I've heard some less than pleasant anecdotes about this restaurant; it's true. (Chain restaurants can, after all, be spotty depending upon location, franchisee, management in general, et cetera.) And, to be candid, I can't imagine coming here often. (I'd rather support locally owned places. Period.) That said, I had a very, very nice little meal here, and so I can't complain. One thing -- and this IS important: Someone needs to send a memo out to all the employees here that being on your cell phone during work hours is simply NOT acceptable. Period. I saw about a third of the staff here fiddling with their phones in lieu of working. THAT, my friend, is simply not acceptable. (Were I the manager here, I'd ban all cell phones, iPads, and other personal electronic devices during work hours. No exceptions.) OK, grumpy old man rant over here now. I'm hungry for a Jalapeño Burger and hard cider."
Jess M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",25,77,96,2.0,11/15/2017,"Have you ever watched 'Kitchen Nightmares'? If you haven't, it's a show where Michelin Star Chef Gordon Ramsay goes to struggling restaurants to see what they're doing wrong and tries to fix them. A lot of times he'll see that the kitchen is disgusting or the food is rancid and expired. BJ's, I'm sure, doesn't have any of those problems, but Chef Ramsay would have an issue with the size of the menu. After looking at their menu online, I counted ~150 items. I understand wanting to have something for everyone, but 150 seems bonkers. It's a bit overwhelming to have to thumb through 25 pages of food that all seem like they would taste fine. Luckily, I didn't have to think very hard about what to eat. On Mondays, BJ's offers their large Deep Dish Pizzas at half price, so my brothers and I chose that.  We decided to do half Chicken Bacon Ranch and half Gourmet Five Meat. The Chicken Bacon Ranch was easily the better of the two that we chose, but still nothing amazing. The Gourmet Five Meat, while meaty, was pretty dry. We asked for extra sauce, but it was still pretty parched. Also, BJ's Deep Dish Pizza is nothing close to actual Deep Dish Pizza. Deep dish is supposed to be more like a pizza lasagna/casserole. BJ's pizza more closely resembles Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza. In fact, it pretty much has the same topping and crust ratio (2/3 of the pizza is just crust) and tastes almost identical. If we had shown up on any other day and bought the pizza for full price, I would be disgruntled. Since it was half off, I'm slightly gruntled.  Despite all of the bad things I have to say about their pizza, their Pizookies are delicious! Sure, they may be over 1000 calories each, but who cares? If you have the room for it, go for it!  In conclusion, avoid the pizza, eat the Pizookie."
Katy C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",101,93,55,3.0,9/6/2017,"Great for groups and kids. Huge variety on the menu-no stand outs. If you never know what drinks to order, it's a good place with an extensive cocktail menu (takes the pressure off).  They don't always honor the email promotions. Best to call ahead and check."
Bryce D.,"Edmond, OK",118,4,3,5.0,1/10/2018,This place has always been a good place to stop by after work or during lunch the food is just amazing and have always enjoyed the in house brews. Nutty brunette has always been a long time favorite of mine.
Tracy M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",25,50,42,3.0,9/10/2017,"I rarely write an ""unhappy customer"" review because I genuinely believe that everyone deserves a second chance, but this particular BJ's location needs help in the service side. The food is always good but they never staff enough servers. Again, I believe that from time to time, people and businesses will fail you but this is the fourth time I've been to this particular BJ's and the service has been poor. Not due to unfriendly servers by any means but by the nature of management not scheduling enough staff. I would hate to see this location suffer long term but hopefully the management can figure out a better solution. There's zero reasons why any guest should wait more than 3-5 minutes before being greeted. There's zero reasons why any guest should have empty water glasses for 10+ minutes. Like I said, this pretty much is the norm every time I frequent this place. Boo. :("
Karen H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",32,22,8,2.0,12/7/2017,"This was my first visit to BJs.  The food was horrible. I ordered a sirloin steak and asparagus.  I should have taken a picture.  The asparagus was over cooked as was the steak.  The steak was seared way too much. It was not tender or juicy.  My friend had the shrimp quinoa bowl and she said the shrimp was over cooked.  The 2 stars are for the service which was good.  I also had clam chowder which was not bad, but not very flavorable."
Candice H.,"Mustang, OK",97,53,105,3.0,8/13/2017,"Hadn't been in a while so we thought to give it a go. We were terribly disappointed in the service. Seemed to take forever to get drinks, to order, and to check out. Then the food...not sure if they changed their chefs and/or recipes but the food was subpar. The Buffalo pizza was very dough-y and the Buffalo sauce wasn't tangy or spicy. The flavored tea was not sweetened like we were told either. I don't think we will be back. Too many Restaurant options to get the low quality food for the high dollar prices."
Andrew B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",39,14,1,3.0,12/2/2017,"This is my favorite place to eat when I can't think of anywhere else to go and/or I'm eating with a group of picky eaters. I really do mean that in the best possible way. I am never enraptured by the gastronomic pleasures of the Pizzookie, but the food is always more than edible, the service is always quick, and anyone can find something to enjoy on the Tolstoy-inspired 10,000-page menu. They have their own beer which is always pretty good and I always get some because it's something you can't get anywhere else and I'm a sucker that way."
Tania S.,"New York, NY",282,70,52,5.0,3/21/2017,"Been on a strict diet lately and have been trying to find places with some diet friendly options.  Luckily, this location has a section in their menu dedicated to ""lighter options."" I'm usually skeptical on trying these options since foods on these menus aren't the speciality of the restaurant.  I was surprised on how flavorful my entree was! I ordered grilled chipotle chicken with brown rice and black beans. Wow. For being on a diet, this hit the spot. The flavors were more than what I expected from BJs. My food ended up being better than what we both ordered.  Good job BJs!"
Shay B.,"Edmond, OK",126,531,396,3.0,9/4/2016,"When it comes to appeasing my large extended family on where to eat, BJ's usually does the trick. After all, their menu is practically a novella with how extensive it is. There's truly something for everyone here.  Last time I came, we were a hefty crew of 13, which the BJ's staff handled well (especially when you throw on the antics of my dad and his siblings bringing out the sibling in each other...). Both drinks and food came quickly, which was much appreciated.   Do note that the portions for BJ's meals are H U G E. I ordered the Santa Fe salad, and it was practically 3 salads in one. If you have a small appetite, definitely go splitsies. Which I also recommend for their delicious, signature dessert: the Pizookie. It's a cookie cake topped with ice cream and quite tasty.  Overall, I'll take BJ's over some of the other places that get veto'd in the dining discussion!"
Tim S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",43,184,266,4.0,3/27/2016,"Slight downgrade for old faithful.  Started out the meal with the fried calamari appetizer.  The Aoili sauce and marinara dipping sauce that came with it was really good and helped a lot.  I didn't feel the calamari was breaded or cooked very well, there were actually 3 or 4 pieces that barely had any breading at all on them.   My wife and I could be a little spoiled though, both having had fresh fried calamari though in Seattle and Alaska.   Guess I should've expected this from a restaurant in Oklahoma.  Also, ordered the New California Redwood punch.  I'm a bourbon guy, so the alcohol listed was one of my favorites, woodford reserve.  I could barely taste the bourbon, though which was a turnoff.  So I would suggest a little more woodford, less fruit punch, but the mint leaves were a nice addition.  It was a perfect evening for their outdoor seating and despite being somewhat busy the waiter was on top of everything.  My Italian penne w/ Cajun shrimp was superb though and came with a garlic knot.  Overall, I'm just bumping then down 1 star since this is the first time I've been slightly disappointed."
Mindi A.,"Everett, WA",67,490,672,5.0,2/18/2016,"They have a pretty extensive menu so there will be something for everyone-- appetizers, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, beer, cocktails. Service was also excellent.  I was able to have 3 small tastes of beers before choosing which pint I wanted. They have 4oz tasters for $2 each as well. I ordered their Hopmaster IPA and enjoyed it. For an appetizer, I was really excited to see they have poke. Poke is incredibly commonplace in Hawaii and I don't see it often here on the mainland. I was very pleased with how tasty BJs was. (For those unfamiliar, poke is marinated raw fish, kinda similar to sashimi.) I ordered a burger for dinner and it was prepped beautifully. I ordered it medium and it came out medium! Def recommend the skinny fries, super crispy."
Chad K.,"Potomac Falls, VA",133,218,267,3.0,9/17/2016,"Some coworkers and I stopped by for dinner here a few days ago. It was a great choice because it offered a wide variety of food selection to make everyone in the large group happy. The inside reminds me of a manly cheesecake factory. Almost like a cheesecake factory and a sports bar had a baby, this restaurant being the result. It is decorated in a contemporary traditional decor that is trendy and comfortable. The staff we encountered at this restaurant were great! They are very friendly and quick (which in Oklahoma isn't really the norm). We started off with drinks and they have a wide variety of beers to choose from as well as specialty drinks. Some of my coworkers got stouts and they enjoyed them thoroughly, and I got a martini and it was made almost perfect (minus some points for  the lack of blue cheese olives). Drinks were brought back quick and we placed our order. I went with the Cobb salad and it was so good! The avocado ranch dressing was a little disappointing but I made due with some oil and vinegar.  Overall I would recommend this to a group of people going out for dinner with different palates. I wouldn't go here with my significant other unless it was the only option, mainly because it is nothing majorly special. Everything was good but it was standard, which isn't necessarily a bad thing"
Teppi H.,"Wilmington, IL",0,1,,5.0,9/17/2017,"The food is great and the pizzookie is life changing. I love going here alone, with family or with a group. The menu has many options and the staff is friendly."
Jennifer H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,14,23,4.0,4/15/2017,"Service was good, pizza was very good. The crust was light and fluffy with a buttery fried edge. The sweet tea was not sweet and basically flavored water. My bill total was $15 pretty good for a small deep dish pizza and sweet tea."
Kristi S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",4,128,96,3.0,1/2/2017,Over cooked steak. Undercooked vegetables with no seasoning. Bland and blah. Has nothing on Texas Roadhouse for price and quality.
Sean P.,"Norman, OK",42,5,1,5.0,2/9/2017,"BJ's is amazing. The food and service in stunningly great. The employee are very helpful, ordering and offering great advice on food choices. The service is quick, employees check on you often to make sure you appropriate accommodated. I will definitely be coming back. The menus are big enough to try many different things, so you can keep coming back."
Lavel L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",10,137,582,2.0,3/28/2015,"Nothing special! I ordered the hot wings as an appetizer.. Came out hot, but then seemed kinda fatty, so they were just MEH.. I had better, and I had worse, they were decent! I got the turkey burger with jalapenos, pretty much a jalapeno burger but made with a turkey patti..  The turkey patti was kinda small.. The skinny fries weren't good, I should of gotten another side, lesson learned Again, I've had worse places, but this place was just MEH.."
Eric U.,"Central Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",0,1,,2.0,9/15/2017,Poor customer service...waitress didn't even ask if we would like an appetizer. Food was ok...Chef Ramsay would not approve of this place.
Mary F.,"Atlanta, GA",25,22,10,5.0,2/11/2017,This is my absolute favorite place to eat. Parmesan crusted chicken is the best. Pazookies are yummy for desert so save room. Mid range on price.
K S.,"Dill City, OK",1,9,6,5.0,12/15/2016,"One of my favorite places to eat. My ribeye is always cooked to perfection. Great menu, great wait staff and great atmosphere!"
Taber W.,"Yukon, OK",83,3,,4.0,12/10/2016,"I have eaten here several times and have never had a bad meal. The menu is a little overwhelming, it is huge! Favorite so far is the Salmon, it is amazing! You can't go wrong with the burger either, but only order it if you're pretty hungry! Service is always great and the wait staff is well versed on the menu. It's a little pricier than it should be in my opinion but I'll keep coming back."
David H.,"Seminole, OK",0,31,17,2.0,10/8/2017,"We were going to try and go to a different restaurant nearby. The wait was long so we decided to try BJ'S.  Big mistake. We were seated by a nice friendly young lady. We were given our menus and everything looked great. Good looking food, good prices and great selection. That is where it went bad. We were ready to order our food and looked over to see our waitress, the bartender and another waitress at the bar. They were on their cell phones. We got our waitresses attention and placed our orders. The food came and looked good. My wife ordered the jalapeño hamburger and fries.  It was very good. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was far from good. It was greasy and tasteless. I was very disappointed.  My grandson ordered the grilled cheese sandwich. It was horrible.  I don't know how you can mess up a grilled cheese sandwich. As we looked around the restaurant, we saw staff hanging and texting instead of waiting on their customers. We heard 2 different tables complain and about getting their orders wrong. This was definitely a big letdown."
Robert W.,"Corona, CA",20,20,8,1.0,8/4/2016,"We stopped in on our way to Tn, I was shocked to be told by the hostess we could not have our small dog on the PROPERTY if she was not a service animal. We lived in California and have gone to Bj's, and many other restaurants with her that have allowed us to use their patio while dining. This is the first time we were told she could not be on the PROPERTY! Not inside the restaurant, but specifically the PROPERTY! I am so saddened to be told this, we really hope Tennessee is more accommodating to pets. I did not want to lie to the girl, but to be told you can not be on the PROPERTY with a family pet, that is calm and not aggressive. I am very sad, for those who are traveling with pets. Beware if you choose to stop for lunch here, did I mention no dogs allowed on the PROPERTY."
Brian B.,"Chicago, IL",34,1020,913,4.0,9/7/2016,Been to a few of these before in California. Had lunch here recently and the thin crust lunch pizza was real good. Washed it down with a couple Oktoberfest beers which were very drinkable. Service very good. Would always go to these when possible.
Mb A.,"Memphis, TN",16,52,35,5.0,2/27/2016,"Excellent food, atmosphere & service.The beer choices are really nice-something for everyone. Chicken cutlets with the sundried tomatoes are an excellent choice-had some left for lunch the next day!"
Antonio R.,"Kalamazoo, MI",24,184,1289,3.0,11/19/2015,OMG! How many options you have in the 16 page menu! Definitively they have what you want. I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and it was spicy and tasty. Not the best one I have had though. Appetizers were good...service was also good and beer options were also great! I had a Hefeweizen and it was just like I wanted it! Good choice for a business meal or for a couple of drinks if you are in the area.
Lyndi Z.,"Yukon, OK",217,185,62,4.0,7/7/2015,"I know, I know, I know... It is a chain with a giant menu that requires page numbers.  It has giant calorie bomb deserts and a loyalty program.  So on the surface it sounds like a Yelper's worst nightmare.  But here's why it isn't:  The signature beers are solid and the wine list is good.  The waitstaff are always friendly, prompt and knowledgeable.  The restrooms are clean and baby changing-friendly.  And surprise:  The food is good!!  I've had everything from flat breads to deep dish, salmon and couscous to soup and salad and I've never been unhappy with my order.  You can of course do the artery-clogging trifecta of a deep fried appetizer/giant burger and fries/pizokie dessert but you can also pick some of the lighter options and not leave hating yourself.   Overall, I really can't complain about this easy access, family-friendly spot by the outlets.  If I join the loyalty program, do y'all promise not to pull my Yelper card?!"
John O.,"Little Rock, AR",94,17,28,1.0,7/28/2015,I ordered a 1 topping pizza and Initially it looked good until my second slice when I noticed the severe lack of cheese all over the pizza. What I thought was extra pepperoni turned out to be patches of sauce with no visible cheese. Needless to say this was by far the worst pizza I've ever had. You'd think for $19 they wouldn't be so damn stingy on the cheese. If I felt like waiting another 30 minutes for another pizza I totally would have brought it to their attention.  Personally I've had better Totino's frozen pizza. Just saying
Mary S.,"Miami, FL",0,45,,2.0,7/27/2016,Service good. Restaurant smelled like dirty nasty mop water.  Food was not good. Everything very greasy. Took s long time to get food. We got there at 11am and took over an hour. We barely ate any of our food. $50 not well spent.
Jp P.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,7,1,2.0,2/1/2017,"Not good   kid had the pasta over   fries were brought out cold!I thought they were like chillies or fridays,but far from it.save your time and money if you like good food this is not the place!"
Mary K.,"Tallahassee, FL",118,175,152,2.0,3/14/2015,"I tried BJ's for the first time nearly five years ago and came out unimpressed. Tonight was my second time, and the experience was not any better.  I ordered the Santa Fe Salad, which comes with romaine lettuce, blackened chicken, red onions, fire‑roasted red bell peppers, jack and cheddar cheese, avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crispy tortilla strips, and Santa Fe dressing. I asked for the red onions to be left out. I suppose to the chef, that meant leave almost everything out because all I got was the lettuce, cheese, a few tortilla strips, and the dressing. No red bell peppers. No tomatoes. No avocado. No corn. And most importantly, no chicken. When the waiter came round again, I explained that almost everything that the salad was supposed to have was not in my salad. His response? ""Oh."" Instead of asking for a new one, I simply asked for what I wanted most - the chicken and the avocado brought out to me so I could add it into the salad. It came out within a few minutes by someone else entirely. I added it in and the salad tasted decent after that, even though it was still missing a few items. There was never an apology offered, not even an offer to discount the price of the salad at all for basically just giving me a plate of lettuce. Did they really think I was going to be ok with being charged about $13 for lettuce and that I wouldn't notice they left out quite a bit of what was supposed to be included? Stuck around for dessert which was the baked beignet. The flavor itself was good with the strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and cinnamon sugar. Unfortunately, the beignet itself was very tough and we had to pretty much saw at it with a knife just to get a piece. I couldn't remember what it was about BJ's that kept me away for so long. Now I know."
Jeff M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",422,586,1161,3.0,4/30/2013,"When people say they really like BJ's Chicago deep-dish pizzas, what they actually mean is they really like (overly starchy and doughy) bread, with some toppings for the sake of color. What they have at BJ's isn't pizza. It's a way to carbo-load prior to a marathon. The Moroccan Spiced Salmon (or something) was not entirely terrible. Well, that makes me sound snooty; it was actually pretty good. The roasted red pepper sauce was kind of watery, and not spicy enough for my tastes (remedied by liberal amounts of red pepper flakes), but there were bites where I was reminded of my mother's cooking (she's not Moroccan, but some of the spices used in Moroccan food is similar). The pickled cucumbers on top were quite yum, and there was the occasional crunch of toasted almonds, which was surprisingly pleasant. But it was something like $13.00-14.00. Not at all worth that price point.  Personal pizza + Moroccan Spiced Salmon (+ a drink maybe?) = $32.00+ Worth it? Sort of? Maybe? Not really. I probably won't be back for a very long time, but if/when I do, I'd definitely get the Salmon again. If you're a big fan of of overpriced and sub-par pizza, small portions, or shopping at the Outlet Shoppes nearby, you'll probably love BJ's pizza. Okay, that time I meant to sound snooty.  Get a Pizookie®. If you're going to get fat, you may as well enjoy yourself."
Charles H.,"Arlington, VA",313,630,786,3.0,9/24/2013,"Dining at BJs reminded me of a casino restaurant typically found in Vegas!  Its HUGE inside with plush leather seats and huge TVs everywhere!  It doesn't stop there as the dishes are HUGE as well.  My padre order Jambalaya and step madre order the scampi pasta.  I took a chance on the rib eye steak.  Unfortunately I should've played it safe with their infamous pizza as the steak did not stand out.  It was a bit over cook per my preference and somewhat bland with no special seasoning.  My dad and step mom did enjoyed their food.   All was not lost as we all enjoyed BJ's renown Best Beginnings appetizer.  What's not to love when you had a choice of Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls, and Santa Fe Spring Rolls!  Before tabbing out we used a $5 off coupon since my dad has a membership with BJ's premier rewards.  Overall I thought BJ's was a nice restaurant comparable to a Vegas style restaurant (as mentioned above) or even Chili's or Applebee's on Steroids with huge portions and fancy bar.  I would give BJ's a try again but skip out on the steak."
Renee H.,"Asia District, Oklahoma City, OK",0,57,1,5.0,12/27/2014,Had the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad with grilled chicken- excellent!!! I highly recommend it. Hot tea is served with honey -perfect on this cold afternoon.  Paige our waitress is the best.
Brandon R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",29,39,8,2.0,7/4/2015,"I have tried this location several times now, I intentionally waited to write a review. I kept making excuses for them as to why the service is so horrible. However, I've run out of excuses and have come to the conclusion it's nothing more than just bad service.  Let me start by saying the menu is great. Everything I have ever ordered tastes wonderful. The signature pizzas are obviously great. The steaks are good. Nothing to write home about but not disappointing either. The calamari appetizer is a must order and for dessert the pizzookie (spelling?) is amazing. We have never been disappointed with the food. Now to the service... This is consistently the worst service I've had and I'm including fast food! They are extremely slow with beer orders which is crazy considering the fact that they claim to be a brew house. I can only imagine how much money they have lost from not being faster. We finish a beer and order another and it can be 10-15 min before the next round arrives. The wait staff is very friendly and it may not be their fault maybe the bar staff is where the problem lies. We had my birthday dinner there recently and there we approximately 16 people in our group. Several people had not been before and they told me even though the food was good they wouldn't be back. After the meal we were sitting waiting for the aforementioned pizzookie we had ordered. After 20 min it became apparent our server had forgotten about them. I don't know how else you could explain it taking longer to make a pizza and deliver to my door than it took them to put a scoop of ice cream on a cookie and walk it across the room to our table. Our party was there for approximately 2 1/2 hours and we were only served 3 beers in that time.  You can look back at all my previous reviews and tell I'm not a person that typically writes bad reviews. I truly wish the service was so much better. This location is very convenient and the food and beer are great. I just don't think I can suffer through the poor service again. I hope that your service is better because the food and beer are definitely worthy of a four star rating."
Wendy W.,"Broken Arrow, OK",34,3,,5.0,1/29/2016,"From the appetizer (egg rolls beat the neck out of Chili's), to the pizza and flatbread pizza to the Pizoikies, everything was delicious and service was very attentive. Worth making the trip back!"
Jana N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",90,69,46,5.0,4/18/2015,"Been here twice , each time with a large group. Wonderful service, amazing food- love this place. Was worried they would not like me bringing my own dessert for a birthday party, hostess asked if she could take my homemade cupcakes I brought to the cooler while we ate & bring them out whenever we are ready. I thought that was very nice they they accommodated our party. Everything was on point! Everyone's meals, from salad to pizza to pasta tasted amazing. !"
Darci M.,"Mustang, OK",56,73,20,4.0,5/3/2014,"This was our first visit to BJ's. Liked the ambiance, it was noisy but we could carry on a conversation without problem. The Jeremiah Margarita was quite tasty. We has the calamari and artichokes. They were both tasty but the calamari wins the race. I had mahi mahi tacos which were quite good as well. My other half had the Tuscan Chicken Limon pasta which he enjoyed well enough not to share, although he does watch his salt and was concerned it was a bit too salty. We split the dessert which name escapes me. It was pricey but no more so than say Applebee's or Chilis however the food was better and tastier. I would happily return to BJ's."
Laurel S.,"Shawnee, KS",61,405,3,2.0,4/14/2014,"I was sad after this visit.  I had gone to a BJs in Dallas and really liked it but this visit was just so-so.  Our food was not great, the service was poor.  In general a pretty bad experience."
