Makenna S.,"Mustang, OK",31,19,16,5.0,3/15/2015,"Love this place! The food is delicious. The jambalaya is exceptional and they are very accommodating to your meal preferences. The wait staff is quick and makes sure that drinks are constantly refilled. Only suggestion: if you're going to have a casual, quiet sit down meal, make sure you aren't seated in the bar section... It can get pretty loud on game days (game days meaning if any sports event is on the TV)"
Tom H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",6,65,,4.0,6/25/2015,For a chain this place is really good. Great beer selections and endless food options. They have a great selection of small to huge portions. Killer pizza as well. Great option for late night dinning.
Annie D.,"Honolulu, HI",6,9,,5.0,9/7/2015,"Every BJ's I have ever gone to has been on POINT!  I just ordered some carnitas fries and they were SO good!  The meat was tender and the fries were fresh.  I'm really commenting  though because our waitress, her name was Krista or Kristen I can't remember (it was Friday, 4 Sept) was phenomenal!  Probably the best service I've had in years.  She was attentive, friendly and genuine.  I drank SO much water but she was always there to keep my glass full.  Also, she came around just enough and only at the appropriate times.  I'm not too picky about that but I can recognize when someone is so good at their job that they pick up on those cues.  Great restaurant, great food, great staff."
Iris T.,"Grand Prairie, TX",131,79,19,3.0,7/1/2015,Food was ok  but what was quite annoying was that they insisted on seating people across from each other even though there is plenty of seating. I obviously requested to sit in a different seat when she tried to seat me across from this other couple. But they left and the new arrivals were seated directly across from me. They had two empty seating booths in front of them and in back of them and so did I and we didn't even have the same server.
Kim N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",78,100,307,4.0,2/18/2014,"We came here for happy hour specials and to take our friend out for dinner. Our server was friendly and helpful, and the food came fairly fast and was good. The food wasn't amazing, but it was what was expected. We ordered the happy hour spinach artichoke dip, avocado eggrolls, four of the mini deep-dish pizzas, strawberry mojitos and white peach margaritas. Birthday girl also chose a red velvet pizookie. The drinks were great and the dessert was really good too, especially the ice cream. I'd definitely return for specials and drinks."
Matt B.,"Bethany, OK",39,32,,4.0,8/10/2014,"I come here for the excellent pizza.  If you like deep-dish pizza, this great- in fact, I'm not sure there is pizza in town that I like better.  They also have a big selection of beers, including their own brews.       The dining room is trendy, warm and inviting, clean, and the service is great.  Never had a bad experience here- and I've never had to wait for seating, as contrasted with the Memorial location, which stays packed, probably due to its location next to Quail Springs Mall."
Alexis L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,25,,4.0,7/24/2015,"I try and avoid chains at all costs, but BJ's is one of my exceptions.  I love their in house brewed rootbeer, cream soda & orange cream soda in the frosty mugs.  And the pizookies are the best-cookies in a pizza pan with ice cream.  Lots of menu options that will please anyone."
Billie W.,"Yukon, OK",9,10,1,5.0,9/6/2015,"This place has the best menu! Great tasting food that is only prepared after it is ordered, so don't get in a hurry for your food, because it is well worth the wait! Always great friendly service. We go here at least once a week and love the food quality and willing to wait for fresh delicious plates of perfectly cooked food."
Eric F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,48,2,3.0,5/9/2013,"We've had BJ's before in Norman, OK.  Still get some immature laughs every time we discuss the place, what can I say? Wife and I went with our 20mo old daughter for my birthday.  The entry is kinda cool with it's big revolving door.  The prices are a bit higher than I would like to pay for the amount and quality of food, but not absurd by any means.  The Calamari was delicious, and felt like a nice size for an appetizer, though I am personally not a fan of the chewy tentacles.  For those wondering: yes the calamari at BJ's includes little creepy tentacles as well as the body meat I love so much. House salad was pretty generic.  What can you really expect though?  It's just a salad.  Wife and kid seemed pleased enough with it. We split a 9"" (small) deep dish ""Great White"" pizza.  (basically chicken alfredo pizza)  The chicken was amazing, though I kinda wish there had been more on it.  In fact all the toppings were delicious.  The crust had a hint of crispy-cheese flavor around the edge which I liked, and it was light enough that I didn't feel bloated after eating 2-3 pieces.  I can see why the other reviewer seemed less than keen on it, as it wasn't perfect by any means.   Since it was my birthday they brought out a mini pazzoki (sp?) which is really just a delicious and hot cookie in a tin with a scoop of ice cream on top.  It was incredible, and I could feel it going straight to my love handles.  To be honest, I feel like the last time I went to the BJ in Norman it was a birthday as well, and I could have sworn the pazzoki was much bigger, but who can really complain about free birthday chow? Sadly being new the place still has a few kinks to work out, especially with the small book they call a menu full of beers and food.  I had asked our waitress about ""flavored teas"" because I love a sweet fruity iced tea, and she only knew about the icky raspberry tea from the fountain (I can't stand the stuff, doesn't taste anything like tea to me). I noticed later that they have ""mocktails"" which are fruity drinks without booze in them, including a Peach tea, and a Blackberry tea.  Both made with Monin syrup mixed into tea.  I've had these before and love them, but having already resorted to ""just water,"" the $3 price tag for said teas seemed unnecessary. Fun place with decent enough food.  Seemed ideal for parties of 2-4, with the potential to push some tables together for larger parties.  Also they had advertisements saying ""call ahead and skip the wait"" or something like that, so it appears you can make tentative reservations if you like."
Vinh N.,"Bedford, MA",40,198,996,3.0,7/7/2013,"I seldom go to fancy places and this place looks pretty fancy to me.  The place has a nice atmosphere but it seems a bit dark.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this or not.  I ordered the Supreme Pizza and it was around $20 which I thought was a bit expensive.  The pizza was alright but it didn't have enough sauce for my liking.  Especially for leftover, it was dry as a brick.  The Mac & Cheese was average. They made it too fancy and I thought that ruined it.  They crumbled some cheap gold fishes to try and make it look sophisticated (I hate gold fishes, too dry!)."
Lauren W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",28,30,1,4.0,5/14/2013,"I really think BJ's deserves 4 stars, for a few reasons. No matter which BJ's I go to, the service is great and the food tastes exacty the same. Conistency in a chain restaurant is great. My faves there are the Tuna Tartare, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Their beer isn't bad at all, either."
Karen S.,"Frederick, OK",26,44,9,3.0,11/2/2014,"We ate there yesterday. It was ok. I had the beer battered cod. It was ok. My husband had the blue cheese burger. It was pretty good. Our son had the Grilled Chicken Pasta, and it was just meh. The stuffed mushrooms were great as were the fried artichokes. the service was the best. It was loud, as one might expect in such a place."
Ashley S.,"Austin, TX",101,24,191,5.0,5/29/2013,I'm a fanatic. Anyone who knows me knows that if they ask where do I want to go eat I'm saying BJ's! My rewards card has earned me a lot of free food because I spend a boatload there. They have a great drink menu for starters. I'mnot a big beer person but they have a wide selection so I can take my beer drinking friends there and not get ugly looks all night because they only have domestics. The Very Berry Margarita is my favorite. I'm really glad they come out with the small appetizer plates because I kill the Feta and Watermelon Salad and the Chicken Wontons. The menu is huge but not overwhelming. I've been to places where they have so much that you can't even figure out where to start but for some reason their menu just flows and it's never hard.
Joseph G.,"East Meadow, NY",9,10,,3.0,7/20/2014,Good food as usual. Service was NOT A+. Wait for a server and drinks was extremely long. I found they did not treat their standards of service nearly as good as other BJ's restaurants that I have been to. Did not follow the correct reward card member procedures. Good thing is it is not nearly as busy as other Bj's locations; which I can see why now.
Angie C.,"Yukon, OK",0,11,3,4.0,7/7/2014,"Came for Happy Hour portions. I am a fairly small eater and the portions are perfect! Wait staff has always been friendly and helpful. My fav is the Saints Fe Spring Rolls but haven't had anything I didn't like. Just remember that if you want the Happy Hour Specials , you have to sit in bar area. They won't give them to you if you sit down on the floor area. 2 steps makes a difference to them."
Ben G.,"Blanchard, OK",1,7,3,3.0,12/18/2013,"43 minutes to get our lunch......normal noontime crowd, food is OK, not great. Need to get the kitchen times worked out if they are going to attract business lunch crowd"
Jaci W.,"Bethany, OK",29,25,,4.0,8/21/2013,They have a giant menu with options for any craving. BJs has a great lunch menu that includes a salad or soup and is fairly inexpensive. Nothing beats there desserts! Pazookis are my new favorite! A thick skillet cookie with a mound of ice cream! You have to try one!
Jacinta J.,"Roswell, NM",16,19,32,4.0,2/8/2014,"Very fancy looking, customer service matches, and so does the price tag. The appetizer we had calamari, was fantastic, but if I were you avoid their pasta, it's dry and noodles are undercooked. My husbands was the same way."
Sara T.,"Springfield, MO",1,6,1,2.0,2/10/2014,They got my order wrong twice. Neither the food nor the service was that great.
Scott I.,"Mustang, OK",0,7,,5.0,8/19/2013,"It's pricey, but the food is consistently excellent and the restaurant is clean.  I've loved everything I've tried so far, including pork chops, all meat deep dish pizza, and salmon.  Definitely recommend!"
