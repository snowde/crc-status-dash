Enrique O.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,66,,1.0,11/15/2015,"I went with friends for dinner and drinks, when I got my bill I didn't look at it I just put my card on it, paid and left, I got home looked at the receipt to throw it away and there were items I didn't have totaling over $75, I called my friends just to check if they were charged properly, I would have happily paid for them, however if BJ's staff was negligent it's not going to be at my expense.  In fact the waitress apologized and told me she was aware of her mistake, she put another tables items on my bill.  She gave me to a manager and he said he would call me the next day to take care of it, he didn't so I called, he was very rude and told me he was busy then hung up on me.  I called Corperate and after 3 weeks I got my money back.  It all starts at the top with management, they are bad so you can imagine how bad the rest is.  I don't like to leave bad reviews however I'd want to be told before I went into a mismanaged business so I could prepare."
K G.,"Elgin, OK",0,60,14,2.0,6/23/2014,Hubby got cherry chipotle salmon... Hardly any sauce...asparagus was dried out on ends...won't be back. I just got a house salad and the waiter just added to Hubby's meal which made it cheaper. Which was a positive.
Dani W.,"Kearney, NE",28,123,1,4.0,6/6/2013,"Delicious!! Had a red ale that was perfectly smooth. Bison burger off the light menu was good, not great. Tangy slaw was phenomenal. Our table also had chips as salsa and the salsa was fantastic, loved the roasted taste.  Our server was great as well."
Marilyn R.,"Edmond, OK",10,5,,3.0,10/9/2013,"Disappointed.  Husband had the salmon which was outstanding.  Worth going for. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad.  Came to the table with no chicken.  Called the server over and she said I can take the salad back or just bring the chicken out.  It looked like just a big pile of lettuce.  Told her my concern that it didn't look right, but she assured me it was right except fir the forgotten chicken.  Not worth $13."
