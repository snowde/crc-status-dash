Ashley W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",341,28,92,4.0,12/29/2017,"One of my favorite chain restaurants around town. BJ's is the perfect place to watch a sports game or to catch up with a friend you haven't seen in a long time. And I did both tonight!  I'm always happy with the food I get but tonight specifically, I just ordered dessert. And if you go to BJ's and don't order a pazookie, did you really go to BJ's? You can't beat the deliciousness that ensues when you eat the warm cookie and ice cream. The best.  The service was also top notch and the waitress was on it even though it was super busy! Impressive."
John J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",38,7,10,2.0,9/1/2017,"I have been to BJ's many times and early on things were quite good.  This has all changed in the last 18-24 months.  Of the last 6 take-out orders we have gotten, 5 have been wrong or missing something.  We decided to stop getting take-out from there after the last major mistake. As for the in-house dining, well things aren't doing any better there these days.  During my last visit, I ordered a steak medium rare.  It came out a very deep shade of purple.  Our waitress what shocked by how undercooked it was.  She brought my steak back, but it was a different steak.  She said that ""the chef didn't like the look of the first one.""   Geez, I am glad I didn't eat it, but why didn't they notice earlier?  The 2nd steak was cooked properly but turned out to be 1/3 fat.  Not marbled, but the entire end of the steak was just fat.   For a $25 steak, I had hoped for a little better cut.  Granted they aren't a steakhouse, but they are a restaurant that does mixed grill.  They should have known better. As for the rest of the family.  Wife's salad was par or below and neither of the kids were happy with their meals.  Things they had ordered in the past but didn't pass muster on this go around. Needless to say, we going to give BJ's and extended break.  An almost $100 (including tip) lunch, should at the very least leave you sated.  The kids went home and made sandwiches. I gave them 2-stars instead of 1 because the service has nearly always been good."
Angela M.,"Edmond, OK",52,138,318,4.0,8/10/2017,"The food is good, but not exceptional.  It's on par with a chain restaurant, but slightly better in quality. The price seems higher than the quality dictates.  It's usually quite loud in here as the bar area is open.   The pizza is the winner here."
Bea D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",36,56,30,5.0,11/10/2017,"Thank you for the complementary dinner for Veteran's Day.  Our server, Nelson was a ""hoot""!  My family and I enjoyed the array of entrees to chose from and the adult beverages.  Fantastic service, delicious food, and beautiful decor. Thanks again!"
Nancy R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",647,273,1892,5.0,7/22/2017,"I love BJ's, the food and the service is always excellent. From California to Oklahoma, you can count on consistency. Today my good friend Kim and I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken served with sautéed onions, brown rice, tomatoes, brussels sprouts in a delicious Lemon sauce. The chicken was so tender, it cut easily with a fork. We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder soup, it was thick and creamy full of clams and diced potatoes-delicious. Since I had to go back to work, I ordered their New Sunset Peach iced tea instead of a cold brew, The Peach iced tea was made with all-natural flavors (sugar and artificial sugar served separately)  - very refreshing. I can't leave BJ's with ordering a Pizookie, so today we had a Salted Caramel Pizookie - Worth every calorie - Yum. Our server Bryan was friendly, helpful and very fast - excellent customer server!!"
Don N.,"Edmond, OK",28,50,97,3.0,8/16/2017,"Excellent choice of pizza, burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc.  i like their deep dishes but they also have thin crust.  I got a large with 1/2 BJ's favorite and 1/2 gourmet 5 meat.  Also got the artichoke spinach dip which was pretty good but not spectacular.  The chips were pretty good. They have a nice beer draft beer selection which they brew themselves.  Open late til 1AM on the weekends.  The servers are very friendly.  Only gripe is I wish the crust was crispier.  I'll ask them to do that next time.  They're famous for their pizookies which are large cookies in a pan with ice cream on top. We got the churro pizookie and it was great, nice and crispy."
Kimberly M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",203,118,110,4.0,11/18/2016,"For the most part I love this place.  The pazookies are to die for and they're gluten free so bonus for my family's diet needs. My favorite server is Drew.   I would ALWAYS ask for him.  He has great follow up which is key to a great dining experience. One option I was stay away from on the menu is the super salad.  The description on the menu made it sound like it would be the best salad you'll ever have - cue the loud buzzer.  NO!  Maybe it was just mine, but it was nothing more than lettuce that tasted like dirt and quinoa that would stick in your teeth. I actually ordered this salad yesterday when I came to dine there for a business lunch.  Because it tasted so bad, I asked the server for more dressing so I could top it with anything to make it taste better.  The dressing never came.  This server, which was obviously not Drew, never refilled my water and did not bring any dressing for my salad.  I didn't want to ask a second time so I ate it thinking, 'at least it's healthy'.   Besides this one disappointing experience, I would recommend this place for any occasion.  It's great for birthdays, date nights, game nights, girls' night out ... you name it and they'll have the perfect item for the occasion.  (JUST NOT THE SUPER SALAD) Trust me on that one."
Katie G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",52,117,162,2.0,3/11/2017,"I am sad, so sad, to have to give them 2 stars. They used to be my go-to for a place where everyone could get what they wanted.  Alas. The last few times I've gone, food has been wrong, service has been slow, and things have just overall not gone smoothly. In addition, they recently got rid of their amazing super thin crispy fries, and replaced them with crappy fries. Won't be back anytime soon, unfortunately."
Tony S.,"Edmond, OK",0,5,,5.0,9/9/2017,"Came here for my girlfriends birthday, and we had a blast! We had a huge party and usually the server seems annoyed by it. But he had fun with us and catered to our every need! We weren't too picky on anything but he still did amazing He brought us out desserts and our girlfriend had a blast. We'll definitely be going back soon"
Michelle T.,"Moore, OK",36,2,,1.0,6/25/2017,I took my mom who was in from out of town Texas To have dinner for her Birthday.  We sat a good 15 mins with no one waiting on us.  We finally got up and left.  Told them at the door.  They didn't care.   They had plenty of servers available.   We won't be back.
Nigel P.,"Oklahoma City, OK",30,142,109,4.0,4/19/2016,"I never liked BJ's pizza much; I found it really doughy and greasy, so I kind of discounted the place, but now I realize I should have branched out. The last time we went here, we ordered the calamari appetizer, the portabello burger, a chicken quinoa dish, and some sort of fancy salad. All of the items were very tasty and creative. From what I could tell, BJ's has an order of calamari every two minutes. They mass-produce the stuff. It baffles me how Gordon Ramsay seems to find every mushy calamari dish in the country on his show, Kitchen Nightmares. It's basically fast food, how do these places supposedly mess up frying calamari? Anyway, I degress. The calamari was not mushy. The presentation has improved greatly since last time I went to BJ's. Everything had that sort of faux-gourmet feel that mid-range restaurants seem to be capitalizing on lately. Altogether, it was a good experience and I will return."
Sean T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,101,119,2.0,9/8/2016,I've been to multiple BJ's in OKC. I recently visited this location and I'm out! I ordered a pizza. It was nearly inedible because it was so salty.  Their in-house beers are pretty good. Food is poor and service is pretty mediocre. Definitely will go to other places in the area if I have the choice.
Dominic D.,"Florham Park, NJ",221,165,43,4.0,2/3/2017,"About 3 1/2 stars. Corporate chain restaurant with a pretty big menu. I stick with the basics (deep dish pizza, burger) My son loves the flatbread pizza and eats it all so I will give it four stars. It's a huge spot so never have to wait long for a table"
Matt M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",201,155,202,4.0,7/23/2016,"Holy pizza!  How can it be that a place with so much on the menu has such wonderful pizza.  Great flavors, nice chewy crust just like I like it!  Heaven help me! Dessert.  Oh the sugary goodness of a still-warm baked cooki....oh, the ice cream on....salted...carmel....OK, let's not talk about the Pizookie, because I am still in a sugar-induced coma.  It's why I didn't write my review yesterday after I went to BJ's.  I've been recovering ever since cause I inhaled it - it was SO GOOD.   I also split a Triple Decker sandwich with a friend.  It was tasty, with turkey, ham, roast beef.  Unfortunately the pickles were speared on the top to make it look pretty, making my entire sandwich bun somewhat pickle-soggy.   But the great service, pizza, and dessert are enough to hold BJs at a solid 4 star!  Woo hoo! Have you ever known me to like a chain so much?  I must still be woozie from the Pizookie."
Chris M.,"Columbus, MS",87,6,2,5.0,11/11/2017,Great chicken sandwich and my buddy loved the pizza and beer. We went on Veterans Day and we both received a free meal for being active duty military. We really appreciate when a business does this or offers a military discount. Many thanks.
Bart T.,"Edmond, OK",266,7,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"Eek, Me Thinks Not (one star) is so fitting. I have been here before and food has been good but somewhere along the way BJ's found shortcuts to serving food quickly based upon the crowds and popularity. BJ's is a dressed up drive-thru with mediocre food... (the food came out so fast, and they were slammed on a Friday night, that I found it to be very odd)... Well, the food spoke for itself, it was horrid. This has to be the worst restaurant experience I have had in recent memory.  The BJ's famous Pizookie used to be better - and that one menu item took the longest to cook (or heat up). It took longer to heat up a cookie and top it with ice cream than it did to cook tuna, shrimp, chicken or make Alfredo... the garlic knot even seemed 'day old.' Pizookie has been hacked by other brick oven pizza joints and much better. So, I have zero reason to ever return."
Kelli D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",62,224,249,4.0,12/16/2016,"I give BJ's four stars on the beer selection (I always get a taster flight!), 5 on the atmosphere, and 3 on the menu items. My most recent visit involved drinks, a DELICIOUS brussel sprout appetizer, and dessert. I do appreciate the eclectic menu and wholesome ingredients. Perhaps because of the location and general expense, I save this one for a nice occasion like business meetings or out-of-town guests. They have a separate section for large parties (20-30 ppl). The atmosphere can be casual or intimate."
Eve B.,"San Antonio, TX",2,8,1,5.0,10/7/2017,I always enjoy coming to BJ's. The waitress today (Megan D) was amazing. She was polite and attentive to all our needs. Food was delicious as always. Tried the spaghetti today for the first time and sauce had a really good flavor.
Paul K.,"Litchfield, OH",0,3,1,4.0,1/9/2017,"First time here, will definitely come back. Menu selection is unbelievably diverse.  Atmosphere the perfect balance of classes and relaxed. Beautiful decor.  Asparagus and shrimp penne was exactly the unique dinner I was looking for and pasta cooked perfectly.  The pizookie comes in a mini size. You will have room!  Cannot wait to try some of the other types and flavors."
Jessy I.,"Woodland Hills, CA",167,163,49,4.0,9/10/2016,"I'll be completely honest. We come here for one thing and it's the pizookies. There is something magical about a large warm cookie with a nice cold scoop of ice-cream on it and they do it right! The white chocolate mac, the cookies n'cream, the salted caramel, triple chocolate, the good ol' chocolate chunk...they are all wonderful. If you have trouble deciding...go with the trio and pick three flavors to try. Hats off to you BJ's for this delectable creation!"
Andrew W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,7,,2.0,10/9/2017,Ordered 2 salads when we ordered pizza. One salad came right away. Second salad came about 2 minutes before the pizza. Pizza was cold by time the salad was finished.
Fran V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",325,156,320,5.0,9/5/2016,Really friendly staff and well decorated and clean restaurant. The food was great I ordered a pizza and while the attendants weren't as attentive with bringing me extra cheese I still had a great dinner here. They have great full stocked bar area and a wide variation of food to pick from their menu. It is a great place to go eat with friends or a date. I'd definitely recommend it
Angela B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",98,60,136,4.0,10/17/2016,"My daughter picked this place.  I was craving a huge salad so I got a Southwest chicken something .. It was missing flavor, huge mistake picking that one.  My 20 year old ordered a ham and grilled cheese, she said it was amazing!  Then I got a gluten free pizookie .. that was bomb as usual! We should have skipped the main entrée and went just for the desert! Lol    Good Comfy seating, tables and booths. It was a nice and cool temp, cool decorations atmosphere was on point!"
Mb A.,"Memphis, TN",16,52,35,2.0,8/6/2017,"I really love the food here but bar service is bad. We've come in 3 times in the past 2 months & had the same issue. We like to sit at the bar. Each time we've had a blonde female bartender who just doesn't get it. The first time we just assumed she had a bad day. There are only five or six people at the bar and she seemed like she did not want to be there. She was short and rude  and only asked how things were when she gave us our check.  We had to ask for service, silverware, app plates & dessert.  second time we came in, again bar wasn't full or busy -she didn't greet for 11 minutes & literally looked right at us multiple times. We knew this could be trouble but we were willing to give her another chance. We were cordial friendly & enjoying our time out. Both my husband and I have been in the restaurant business; we understand things can be stressful and busy, but that was clearly not the case either time. It may be she doesn't care about being tipped & if that's the case put a sign on the bar saying so so I don't waste your time or my money.  This lady does not need to be behind a bar. Or in the service industry. The third time we came with a friend and once again, we looked at each other questioning our seating option when we saw her behind the bar; we gave it one more shot. after sitting at the bar for 9 minutes and her not even acknowledging us  our friend said let's go elsewhere. we got up and left. Note to management: if you want to fill the bar and make money at the bar I suggest you find a professional bartender with a good attitude. we may be back but will definitely not sit at the bar"
Luis G.,"West Oaks, Houston, TX",7,1,,4.0,5/7/2017,"Ordered the black and blu burger. It was very good. But the home run was for the dessert, you must order the Pizzokie Trio, Amazing!!!!!"
Quijana B.,"Silver Spring, MD",407,478,4018,3.0,11/6/2014,"Ahi Poke I just needed to leave that there, all on its own for a moment. Ahi poke is one of my favorite foods from Hawaii, and friends enjoy teasing me with amazing photos of their simple lunches. I had to make the trip to BJ's to order the closest thing I can find in a restaurant in this landlocked state.   The good news is that the poke is not at all bad, and is probably delicious for those who don't know how much better it could be.  The bad news is that it left me more homesick than ever, and had me wanting to run to the kitchen with Sam Choy's cookbook in one hand and some sesame oil in the other.  Really, the sesame oil would be enough. Maybe I'll bring some with me next time. And some rice, because the tortilla chips simply confused me. We also ordered salads and pizza, and I can see why people return.  The deep dish crust was good and greasy, and held the toppings well. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but was tasty enough that we would order it again.  Side salads were a standard size, but had a few nice twists.  I particularly liked the pear and walnut salad, which had plenty of texture and flavor throughout.   And I had to try the Pizookie, which looks much bigger than it is, but is easily enough to share with someone. Ours was half chocolate chip, half dark chocolate salted caramel. The ice cream did its job by melting all over the cookie, which made it difficult to know how much had been consumed. What started out as ""just a bite"" quickly became ""I'll skip dinner and head to the gym!"" and then it was gone.... Will we return? Maybe. I would not go out of my way to visit, but would pick BJ's over other chain restaurant options if I was in the area. I'll order the ahi poke and then drown my sadness under a pool of molten cookie goodness. And then I'll head to the gym."
Angee M.,"Wellston, OK",36,42,47,4.0,2/12/2017,"The server was very attentive & knowledgeable about the different brews. I tried the ginger beer and it was delish! I also tried the Goliath, which was a yummy dark red beer. I ate the California Club with fries and it was so good! Loved spending time with my sis-in-law too!"
Chelsey G.,"Edmond, OK",0,12,4,5.0,10/11/2016,We love this location! BJ's is a chain but the service and food at this location ALWAYS excels. If you haven't had a Pazookie you're missing out! Everything on the menu is delicious and I love their lighter offerings menu. Great for lunch or a night out.  Also...not a beer fan but I highly suggest trying some of their brews. VERY GOOD!
Hannah V.,"Edmond, OK",131,4,,4.0,1/21/2017,"So yummy, and very helpful wait staff. Sometimes takes a little while to get the food, but usually it's good time-wise."
GinnyBug M.,"Goose Creek, SC",0,14,4,5.0,12/30/2016,We love this place.  I always intend to order something different but end up ordering the salmon from the Light menu.  It is so darn good.  My husband loves the Ziti - like he would love to lick his plate!  The flatbreads are delicious too.  We've never had bad service or food. Our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves going there too.  They fix her the best cheese pizza.  We all love it.  Highly recommend this BJ's!
Jennifer B.,"Edmond, OK",41,3,,1.0,4/30/2017,Only restaurant that I know that does not allow postmates to deliver. Ridiculous! My order was made and ready to go. My postmates arrived to pick it up and their manager wouldn't let my postmates deliver it to me. The manager just lost my business not to mention wasted food. He said something about his to go girl not getting tipped this is why he will not allow postmates. Sense when do we have to tip the to go person. She is not doing me a service. Waiting on me at a table or delivering it to my house is a service. I will never order from this place again.
Tamara S.,"Northwest Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",170,1,,5.0,1/22/2017,"Came in late after long day looking forward to a delicious meal, Justin took great care of us and the food was perfect. He recommended avocado egg rolls and rootbeer glaze wings and they are now our favorite app!! Will definitely be coming in more often!"
Lauren W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,30,,1.0,7/17/2017,What happened BJ's? Your restaurant was wonderful but the past year or so has really declined. The quality and presentation of food has decreased. We ordered to-go last weekend and were very let down. The side on the pita tacos was about 2 spoonfuls in the cup. The Diet Dr Pepper tasted like carbonated water like the syrup wasn't replaced. Also let down by the shrimp quinoa salad. Sadly that will probably be my last visit.
Matt P.,"San Francisco, CA",259,164,233,4.0,5/19/2015,"One of my favorite places to go with one of my closest friends. They have such a wide selection of food, my favorite of which is the Parmesan crusted chicken. I also always get a wedge salad- they're so hard to find around here and I always love the ones they prepare. If you've never been before, one of the greatest things they have is the Pizookie. It's my favorite dessert anywhere. The cookies and cream is the best (basically a hot cookie with ice cream and cookies and cream on top). Also, they recently added the ability to pay with Apple Pay from your iPhone through their mobile app, which is incredibly handy and makes the checkout process so quick and seamless.  I'm top of all of this, the inside of the restaurant is so nice and always so clean. It's dimly lit which is nice, especially for a nice dining experience.  Recap: excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, and quick checkout for those with Apple Pay!"
Daniel S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",38,18,9,5.0,2/11/2016,"Amazing Price point, great atmosphere, it doesn't get any better! My go to is their chicken bacon ranch pizza, or their sirloin.  Great value,great food, and they always have cool cocktails/beer specials going on!"
Jin Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,141,80,5.0,3/21/2016,Great food and atmosphere.   The Chicken Bacon Ranch Piadina and Meat Lovers Piadina are awesome for lunch.   We were promptly seated and served.  Try this location...won't be disappointed.
Lucy H.,"Concord, CA",1,20,1,5.0,11/30/2016,"Go during the week they have a all you can eat soup and salad, it's absolutely wonderful.  You are able to try all their different soup and salad."
Deepika G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",440,114,671,4.0,3/20/2016,"I honestly only go to this restaurant for their amazing pizookies which are warm baked pizza-cookies topped with a scoop of ice cream. The cookies come in different flavors depending on the restaurant location and season, such as chocolate chunk, salted caramel, and peanut butter to name a few. You can order the original size, mini size, a trio of minis or a huge family-size pizookie platter where you can choose 4 different cookies. BEST dessert place, ever!"
Neal J.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,4.0,3/28/2017,Have been here a few times and the service is always great.  Big fan of the Pizookie and the Roast Beef Dip.  Their wings are also pretty good.
Jeff M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",422,586,1161,3.0,2/9/2013,"*shrug* It's fine. It's a standard chain, but I've always been impressed with the service.  Distrust the opinion of anyone who thinks really highly of the pizza. It's not bad, but you should stick your nose up snootily at anyone who tells you that this is the best pizza they've ever had. Your best bet is the Pizookie®. It's about the only thing I get when I go with some friends who are unnaturally obsessed with this place. They will let you split different flavors in one pan (in my personal experience anyway), so that's always useful if you want to try a couple of different things. Red Velvet. Triple Chocolate, etc. Refuse to share. Tell your significant other to get their own damn Pizookie®."
