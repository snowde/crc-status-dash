Scott R.,"Dallas, TX",14,54,4,1.0,2/21/2011,Terrible service. We came in late to find out they only have appetizers after midnight. Then they locked my friend outside when he went to make a call. The manager did not even apologize when we told him. In fact he argued with me. Apparently him 'forgetting' to unlock the side doors is somehow not his fault and its annoying that we bothered to tell him about it. What a great way to treat customers! The food here is decent for chain food but avoid this place unless you really enjoy terrible customer service.
Martin D.,"Knoxville, TN",0,3,,3.0,7/14/2012,"Not bad for beer and a decent meal, but ""too corporate"" in it's feel and the prices are too high.  Recently, they increased the price on a beer such as a Stella from $5.50 to $5.75.  Give me something with a little more atmosphere."
Senushi J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",59,101,194,3.0,2/24/2012,"We got together with a big group of friends last night, and I've gotta say it's a great place to get a wide variety of tastes together to watch a Thunder game. Normally, I'd give a place like this 2 stars based on the food because it's just mediocre chain restaurant food (think Applebee's or TGIFridays), but this place gets an extra star for their wide variety of beer and because they have a gluten free menu! I wanted to get something a little healthier [read: lighter in calories] and opted for the Chicken Lettuce Wraps as my entree even though it's listed under ""Appetizers to Share."" They're tasty and even though they're only 272 calories, it filled me up. If you are watching calories, don't be fooled into ordering a salad...some of their salads are over 1500 calories because of all the toppings and dressing! Because my boyfriend has Celiac, we're always happy to see a gluten free menu. He ordered a gluten free pizza, and it was actually very good! The crust was great and the 10"" pizza was satisfying. Everyone kept talking about the Pizookie, which is basically a large chocolate chip cookie baked in a mini deep dish pan until it's slightly crunchy on the outside and ooey-gooey on the inside. It's topped with two scoops of delicious vanilla bean ice cream. Split in half, it's about 850 calories for a portion...but since there was a gluten-free pizookie, we HAD to try it...calories, schmalories. Since I've taste-tested a lot of gluten free deserts and make them a lot at home, I can honestly say that BJ's did a great job on their gluten free pizookie! You can't tell that it's gluten free!! My advice: split an entree because the portions are large, and if you're dying for dessert split a pizookie too."
Andy C.,"Cary, NC",84,413,913,3.0,3/25/2010,"Perfectly adequate dining experience.  I would give this place 4 stars but for the lackluster service that we received.  Perhaps it was due to the Sunday afternoon crowd, or just inexperience (as one of our servers was a trainee), but please note that the three stars is an overall rating and not indicative of just the food.  On with the review: Location: 4 out of 5 This is subjective depending on where you are coming from.  It was down the street from our hotel when I stayed in Edmond, so no real complaints.  And if you want to walk off the calories, the mall is nearby.  Service: 2 out of 4 As I've already alluded to, this was the low point of the dining experience.  I admit, it WAS a Sunday afternoon, and as all God fearing Oklahomians do, they were getting their beer and food on.  Interesting note as I found out: the grocery stores in Oklahoma City (and maybe the State?) aren't allowed to sell beers past 3% abv.  Anyway, service was slow, and there was a disconnect between who our real servers were versus who was able to refill our drinks, etc. etc.   Quality of food: 4 out of 5 Honestly, quite impressed with this chain.  I had a burger and the pale ale chili, and I was supremely impressed with the chili.  Probably one of the best bowls I've had in the past 2 calendar years, so good work on that!  The burger wasn't anything that I'd distinctly remember, but it was definitely good.  Yum, bacon and cheese.  I think others at my table got the flatbread pizza, and they seemed to enjoy it.  Bottom line - I don't think you can really go wrong with the food here. Quality of beer: 3 out of 5 Ooooh, and this is where the wheels almost fell off of the bus.  When I have a burger, I want one beer and one beer only, and that's a pale ale.  Don't care what variation: India, American, English - I just want something bitter and bold, but without overwhelming my palette at the very end.  The house version of the pale ale was I thought, a little demure in its flavor profile - similar to something that I've been able to brew at home.  However, I found that it was also quite easy to drink, and because of my good experience with the ale in the chili, in the end I didn't have anything to complain about.  Am I saying that I can't buy something similar in the stores?  Absolutely not.  Give me a Dogfish Head 60 or 90 minute IPA any day, or even a Sierra Nevada.  But I am saying that when local, it's good to drink local beer, and in the end, the pale ale here wasn't terrible.   Pricing: 3 out of 5 Commensurate with anywhere else you'd eat that resembles a restaurant/brewery.   Overall: 3 out of 5 Again, the service was untoward, the food was decent, and perhaps next time I'd like to try a different beer.  Can't say that I was unhappy with the experience, and I'd definitely go back again to give them another try."

Heather B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2014,"Our experience here was unacceptable. Right after we were seated we hear the waiter tell the manager not to seat anyone else in his section. Apparently he wanted to go... So the manager says that he will cut him, don't worry. As we were waiting for the waiter, who's name I believe started with a K, I noticed food on the table. Call me crazy but that's not clean to me. I asked the waiter if he would wipe it down. He then begins to inspect where I'm pointing and kinda laughs as he says ""ok"" he did clean and dry the table. He took our drink orders and came back with the drinks, threw our straws down and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered an appetizer and he left. I went to grab my napkin and there was a long hair on it. That's disgusting! So my boyfriend asked the waiter who brought out the appetizer for a new set. The waiter PICKS OFF THE HAIR, puts it back where they get the rolled silverware and gets us 2 new ones from another area. Our waiter takes our order and leaves. We examined the silverware and surprise surprise food was on both the fork and on the knife. I was further grossed out so we ate the appetizer by hand. And asked for a new set when the waiter finally returned. He then goes over where the previous waiter had put the dirty one with the hair, and grabs us 2 more which CLEARLY had food on the napkins! Our food arrived and looked fine but we decided we wouldn't be eating there. The waiter finally comes back to ""check on us"" I asked to speak to a manager. Prescott was the manager and he was courteous and comp'd the meal (which I didn't request) I just wanted him to be aware of things. So warning! If you go to BJ's be aware of their sub -par cleaning. Who knows what the kitchen is like..."
Donnie T.,"Wadsworth, OH",15,58,14,4.0,12/12/2012,Had the Atlantic Salmon last night. It was pretty good.  They have a great beer selection
Mike S.,"Austin, TX",12,14,1,3.0,11/27/2009,"Better than Rockbottom, not as good as Gordon Biersch. I was a bit surprised to find one of these in OKC when I came to visit; it may be the best brewpub in OKC, but I don't really know. Wedge salad was good; pizza was OK.  I didn't have any beer so no help there."
Lisa C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",27,31,,3.0,7/29/2008,"I normally don't do chains, but I have to mention BJ's because they have very good beer.  Go get yourself a 7-set taster and see what I mean.  Their pizza's are decent.  Sometimes we get food, but usually it's just a pitcher of Jeremiah Red."
Matt W.,"Oakland, CA",0,101,,1.0,5/9/2011,"This is the 2nd BJ's I have been to and I am surprised why this chain is still around. The food was served cold buy a horrible lazy waiter with an attitude and the manager didn't think anything was wrong. We were presented with a bill for our food and drinks, and when the credit card was run the waiter added a gratuity. When the waiter was questioned on this, he said we should have paid attention to the menu closer and then states he is done with us and walks away. The funny thing is, we were going to leave him more than what he added to the credit card bill. Avoid this restaurant and this chain."
Brian W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,3,,5.0,7/23/2011,"I eat here a lot, mainly on weekdays, for both the food and the beer.  The staff at the bar are attentive and friendly.  I have a rule about long lines so I never go there on a Fri/Sat night--too many people with the same idea on date night."
Beverly R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,6,,2.0,12/3/2013,"we've been here before, and it was excellent.  yesterday was my daughter-in-laws birthday and i brought her and my grandson in for dinner.  first - the water took about 10 minutes to make it to our table.  the sampler appetizer, amazing.  the deep crust pizza, just ok.  we asked for marinara sauce because it was kind of dry - took about 10 minutes.  my grandsons mac and cheese??  cold and dry, and they forgot to bring the potatoes with it.  i was a waitress for over 20 years.  these are things that you notice - because your tip depends on it.  they do have multiple servers working the same table, and that's okay, but the mac and cheese that was clearly cold and dried out should never had made it to the table.  perhaps if we had a manager in there who table-touched, the experience would have been better.  i actually felt bad for leaving a tip as low as i did, and decided to write this in case the server wondered why."
