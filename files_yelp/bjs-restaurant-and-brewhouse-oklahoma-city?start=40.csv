Jim H.,"Memphis, TN",18,98,237,4.0,1/2/2015,"When we are in town to see in-laws, this is one of the places I was want to go. The food is good and I love the pizookie dessert. This visit was at 4:30 PM on Wednesday afternoon, which was New Year's Eve.  We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer. The first one that came out was overcooked and we had to send it back, but the second one was cooked well and tasted great.The funny thing about this is our in-laws said that in the past, the calamari had been variable, where on one visit it would be cooked perfect and the next visit, it would be overcooked and have to be sent back. So, when we ordered the calamari, we had even told our waiter that if it's overcooked were sending it back and he still decided to deliver the overcooked one to our table and we immediately send it back. Go figure! So, onto the entrées. My wife ordered the roasted vegetable flatbread pizza, minus goat cheese, to make it vegan - (thanks to the waitress, who is vegan, for the suggestions to my wife on vegan items!). My wife thought this was very good. My father-in-law and I ordered a large pizza, 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage with black olives and mushrooms on both. He thought this was good, I thought it was alright.  My mother-in-law ordered Chipotle honey glazed salmon and she thought it tasted very good And now the coup de grace, one thing that has  always been outstanding on my previous three visits to BJ's, is the chocolate chunk Pizookie. This is a large chocolate chunk cookie served hot, in a cast iron skillet with two scoops of ice cream on top. This is outstanding! So, this was at least my third time visiting here and despite the server bringing out the overcooked calamari the food was all good, as it has been on previous visits, and I'm sure I'll be back here during our next trip."
Kendra Y.,"Edmond, OK",200,312,504,5.0,10/17/2015,"I love this chain! & I don't say that a lot. I usually go for more one of a kind, privately owned places, but this place is rad.  The pizookies are a cookie and ice cream bomb in my mouth! I've had the salted caramel one as well as the pumpkin pizookie and they were both delicious! The food is mediocre, nothing special, but not bad at all for the price!  I absolutely adore their selection of privately brewed beers! Their pumpkin beer is to DIE for! I've had a huge selection of pumpkin beers, there's no pumpkin beer seen that's gone un-tasted, and this one is by far my favorite! The price is very reasonable too, only $15 for a pitcher! Most all their beers are reasonably priced.  Much appreciation from my husband and I for their large selection of televisions to watch your sports games on. We called ahead to make sure they'd be playing our game (made sure to show up early) and just as told on the phone, we were allowed to have a television designated to our desired game. That is important to us and they followed through on their promise, so we were pleased! The televisions could be bigger... considering how high up they are on the walls, but... whatever... I'm just glad they have tv's.  Our service was attentive! Orders were taken in a timely manner, drinks were delivered promptly and our waters were never empty! Which is saying something because my husband and I went through three waters each in like a half an hour. Our waitress was on it!  Overall, I would recommend this place, and we'll most certainly be back."

Natalie K.,"Oklahoma City, OK",59,16,,5.0,4/21/2015,"If you want to be served delicious food by the nicest people in the city, go ahead and eat here. We went to eat on a Saturday night, and I couldn't believe how genuinely nice every single person on the staff was. From the hostess, to the employee who seated us, to the waiter, everyone just seemed happy to be working there. And not only was our waiter friendly, but he was prompt with the food and knowledgeable of their extensive food and beer menu. The wait was projected to be about 20 minutes by we were seated in ten. To start, we ordered the Ahi Poke. The flavors were great and the wonton chips were warm and crispy, but the quantity was less than I was used to (but still tasted great, which is the important thing). For drinks and entrees, I ordered their Hopstorm IPA which is a great all-around IPA, and a burger which came with a very large side of fries. My partner ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which came out huuuuge! The service I experienced that night left a lasting impression on me. I definitely plan on visiting this location again!"
Nancy H.,"Edmond, OK",28,22,29,3.0,4/16/2016,"I love the atmosphere because it's very classy and grand. The service was okay since we did not see our waitress many times that night, but our food came out really fast. Maybe I just didn't order a good meal that night because I ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and I absolutely hate it.. I'm a very big fan of pasta and this wasn't for me. The noodles was so hard and stale and my food was cold. I might of came on the wrong night; although I'm willing to give this place a second try next time."
Thomas O.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,51,,4.0,10/9/2015,"For my monthly lunch outing I chose BJs for several reasons. My Daughter in Law Bridget was visiting from Oregon, and she is gluten intolerant. She was exuberant over the varied and extensive gluten free menu offered, and all the help offered by our server Anessa.  Bridgetsavored some Broccoli Cheddar soup, and a classic burger with pepper jack. I opted for the Jambalaya, and it was a delightful dish,both visually and tastefully .Daughter Robin, and Granddaughter Heather had a Scampi Pasta, and a BBQ chopped salad. All plates were cleaned out so thats a statement in itself.  I asked Anessa for a gluten free desert we could all share...Everyone at the table claimed they didn't want any dessert, but somehow when this PIZOOKIE, (a hot chocolate chip cookie with a large gob ice cream on it) arrived all the spoons got busy and it vanished.  I only have two things to fuss about, one the place is kind of noisy so conversations can be a bit strained. Two, I had the house IPAs tasty and well crafted but the hoppiness level was more on the level with a Bass Ale rather than say an Abita IPA."
Al G.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,11,9,5.0,7/28/2015,"Excellent steak and the white cheddar mashed potatoes were awesome.  Lots of choices in beers as well, which you can sample ahead of time. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in OKC."
Chuck L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",151,64,4,3.0,8/18/2016,"Not too impressed. I have been here 3 or 4 times and it's always ok. Tonight I came in to try the pizza and cucumber jalapeño margarita I had heard someone talk about. The drink was ok. The pizza I ordered was the buffalo chicken pizza with celery!? Disgusting! Why would anyone put basically raw celery on a pizza blows my mind! I know shame on me for not reading the description, but I'm not a picky eater and it's never been a problem especially with pizza! I would eat any topping but I guess not celery. It was way to much celery too, I had to tear the pizza apart to not avoid all the celery. Overall without that pizza 3 stars, if I had only ever tried the pizza 2 star it was that bad. Almost forgot to mention the small pizza was around $16. Doubt I will return and if so not for pizza. Also one last thing the menu is completely overwhelming! There is way too much going on with that menu, I like to have options but geez why soooo many! I take a ridiculous amount of time to go through."
Jeanette T.,"Dousman, WI",5,7,6,5.0,6/2/2015,"The tomato/mozzarella salad was very yummy. The tavern cut pizza has a cracker like crust which is so good if you like thin crust. The salted caramel pizzookie is a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and salted caramel sauce....to die for! Nice atmosphere, good service.Will definitely go back when we go to OKC."
Rachel S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",64,400,539,3.0,2/9/2013,"Whew, okay. So this experience was a roller-coaster of emotions for me. That phrase is dumb. I like roller-coasters. We went here after an early D&D wrap up, and if I know I'm going out to eat, I try to choose somewhere I haven't been because I have a review problem. Also, it was late enough that there wasn't a plethora of choices. I'm not big on beer but normally places like this have a giant selection of ales and such that they don't have in your average eatery that also happens to have alcohol. So I ordered some sort of cider, and when she looked at my I.D., she said she couldn't serve me because it's expired. Urrrgh. I didn't even really pay attention to my I.D., because it's ONLY an I.D. -not a driver's license. And I've been getting alcohol no problem so it didn't even cross my mind. I wasn't upset with the server by any means, it just kind of... sucked. There are probably more eloquent ways to word that, but that's what encompasses how I felt most. I swear by my pretty floral bonnet... (not looking forward to a tag agency trip).  That was just a little experience side note, nothing to do with my actual rating. Though my emotions started here. For my meal, I ordered the mahi-mahi over pineapple fried rice and vegetables. It sounded amazing! When I got it, the rice was slightly undercooked and the taste was... jumbled. It reminded me of a few times when I tried a new rice mix at home and it didn't turn out well. The fish was bland and chewy. I couldn't eat the rest in good conscious. It was just so awful. My boyfriend insisted that I say something, but I just -can't-. I have this weird block that makes me panic up if I feel like I have to send something back or complain. More often than not I suck it up and eat it, or pretend to take it home to eat and still pay for it. It hasn't happened at all often, which is of course a good thing, but it sure is a moment of sheer TERROR for me. Finally, my boyfriend said something and our server was very nice about it and said she'd take it off our ticket and I could get something else. By now, my sympathetic nervous response had kicked in because of the stress I was putting myself through and I wasn't very hungry anymore. I'll admit, I cried a bit. I really do hate doing that. The manager came to our table to make sure everything was alright and apologized about the food and such. I felt like I was going to die. How embarrassing (to me)! But she was most kind and helpful. I chose the spring roll appetizer, though and liked it quite a bit. So my rating started at 2 stars, but after composing myself and analyzing it more closely, it got to 3 stars: I tried my boyfriend's fries that came with his burgers and they were delicious, and he really enjoyed his burger. I did taste my boyfriend's beer, and it was tasty. The spring rolls were yummy. The staff handled the situation way better than I did."
Bre R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",69,6,,5.0,3/19/2016,Great appetizers at a nice price! Staff is knowledgable and there's a variety to choose from. The atmosphere is fun and classy.
Amy P.,"Edmond, OK",89,124,151,4.0,9/26/2013,"Between my husband's managerial keys jiggling and my heels clicking, everyone knows you can find us here to unwind! The most amazing mojitos/margaritas for a chain...what can I say I love my Patroń. We love meeting friends and having get togethers on expressway. The staff is friendly and they accommodate our child's unusual requests. I know the food will be delish and the drinks cool & refreshing. We tried the spinach dip with added chicken(suggested by jason) for a protein jump and it was so-so and he took it off our slip. We always tip appropriately... For my husband's birthday we tipped 40% because the staff was amazing and the bartender is just drop dead gorgeous! Have fun and check their website for promos regularly :)"
Heather S.,"Tulsa, OK",0,6,,5.0,8/6/2016,"Love B.J's! The menu is outstanding, and there is something for everyone.  You honestly can't go wrong and the desserts are phenomenal!"
Chanda E.,"Live Oak, TX",13,28,1,1.0,8/29/2015,I use to LOVE this place. I had not been in almost six months so when I got there I was definitely disappointed to see that the menu had changed. But I pushed on. The waiter was terrible sat there for 20 minutes waiting to give our drink order even when it wasn't busy. We ordered the 20 dollar steak and got a slab of fat. I'm not exaggerating either. Both steaks were bad the manager tried to fix it but my sister had to be at work soon so we ended up leaving hungry
Carly N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",228,613,3460,4.0,11/13/2012,"I dined here on a Monday night so the restaurant was not packed at all. I liked sitting in the bar area because there was a Thunder game going on. The TV had one big screen and 3 smaller ones below so you can keep up with other games. Our waiter was pretty nice and kept up with refills. I ordered a jalepeno burger which I really enjoyed, especially the thin cut fries that came with it! I ordered it well done but once I bit into the burger, I noticed one part of the meat was still pink. I just pulled the pink part off and ate the rest so it wasn't anything to make a big fuss over.  The restaurant was clean, roomy, and had nice decor so I think it's a great place to dine. Plus, the menu is 16 pages long so you'll have plenty of options!"
Matt B.,"Bethany, OK",39,32,,4.0,8/10/2014,"I come here for the excellent pizza.  If you like deep-dish pizza, this great- in fact, I'm not sure there is pizza in town that I like better.  They also have a big selection of beers, including their own brews.       The dining room is trendy, warm and inviting, clean, and the service is great.  This location stays packed after about 6pm, so you will have to wait for seating, and parking can be difficult."
Cassie L.,"Lawrence, KS",0,86,3,4.0,6/20/2016,"This was our early lunch stop during a day of trying out breweries in OKC last weekend. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beers here. While I was disappointed they didn't have a sour or a wheat, everyone else really enjoyed every beer on their flights. The food was pretty good, but it's a chain, so it's pretty much all the same. They try to make stuff that everyone will like, nothing too strong, but that tends to end with lack of originality too. Overall, we would go back again, especially if we can make it to one that sell growlers (Kansas and Oklahoma cannot due to brewing not taking place on site)."
Justin B.,"Springfield, VA",189,2,,5.0,11/11/2015,I feel bad for the bartender tonight.   They got their butt's kicked tonight and the manager is just over there gossiping with the waitresses that just got off at close.  Get back there and help them.  I would.  I run my own store.   Bjs should be embarrassed.  Not good management.   5 stars for the help 1 star for whoever you are
Eric M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",27,2,,5.0,8/15/2015,I've been to hundreds of Steakhouses across the country but this was the most perfectly cooked MR Ribeye I have had in years! Split with my partner and flatbread pizza with a nice Blond Ale!
Megan D.,"Edmond, OK",78,12,,5.0,10/21/2014,"A great dining experience. Great service, the presentation and taste of the food was divine. Good quality, good prices. I can't wait to return with my family :)"
