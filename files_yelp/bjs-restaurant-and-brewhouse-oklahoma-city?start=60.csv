Anna M.,"Edmond, OK",12,13,7,4.0,10/12/2014,"I usually am not a fan of big corporate chains with huge menus... I was pleasantly surprised by BJ's.. We have only ordered take out so I can't tell you about service.  But everytime we ordr Togo our order has been correct and all the condiments have been in the bag! I like they have an enlightened menu with lighter meal choices! I have had the salmon and their mediterranean chicken tacos and both were really good! They post all the calories for entrees on the menu so this is good .. Well and bad . Lol.. U realize how much you are eating and some items I never knew were so high in calories I was able to stop ordering! They are open late so that's a plus too! So while I would rather dune local., BJ's is a good chain and reasonably priced , so definitely worth checking out!"
Tiffany W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,9,1,5.0,4/7/2015,"Have the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. Everything was fresh and delicious and I will definitely be back. Our server was delightful. Ask for Jennifer. A great environment for couples, families, or even just having a lunch by yourself."
Melodie H.,"Agawam, MA",36,115,2,3.0,2/12/2014,Went there with a friend for dinner. I wasn't hungry but I can always eat dessert.  Service was ok. The Pizookie White Chocolate Macademia Nut is amazing!  I went there the next weekend just for the Pjzookie!  You just need to try it!
Leah M.,"Yukon, OK",0,1,,5.0,11/26/2016,My review will mainly be over our server Shaun.  It was the day after thanksgiving and we went in after some shopping. I have diabetes and my blood sugar had bottomed out from all of the walking in the mall. I was at a dangerous low of 23. My husband told Shaun the situation and he immediately went and got me a drink with no ice as we ask as well as some garlic rolls. He then came back and got our official drink orders. He was working a double shift and was very up beat and friendly. He came by and ask if I was good or if I'd need any more sugar.  My husband ordered a beer selection and a salad I ordered a salad and our daughter got spaghetti. Shaun brought our daughter some fruit to snack on till the food arrived.  Service was quick with the food and all tasted great.  While we were sitting and eating Shaun's family came in and sat at a table behind us. He had a brand new baby as well as older children. The interaction between him and his family was very sweet and loving. He never ignored his other customers while his family was there. He was still working just as hard making us all happy.  We were very impressed by this man and his service.
Sofia L.,"Edmond, OK",42,169,221,1.0,10/15/2014,Absolutely terrible food and service. My friends always drag me here because they love their pizza and beer. I have yet to receive a correct order at the same time as theirs in 3 visits. Boycott!
Gaia S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,1,1,5.0,7/14/2014,"We just moved to the area and had passed by this place when we were driving around. The overall feel is laid back and comforting. The food smelled and looked great, so when we got our plates we were expecting it to taste just as good. AND IT DID!!! The food was unbelievably good!!! We had the rib and the fish tacos!! You definitely have to try those two things. The drinks were great as well. We will defiantly be going back here on a regular basis now that it's in out neighborhood!!!!"
Joshua B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,24,,5.0,3/15/2015,"BJ's has become rather iconic for their Pizookie dessert and for brewing their own in-house beer and root beer (which is exquisite). The pizzas are delicious and the burgers are very filling. The only thing keeping me from being a regular is the price, but it's not bad for the occasional treat or date since you can always split a pizza. The ambiance is always cool, with really well-painted murals and nice mirrors, and of course TV's everywhere, particularly the bar."
Cheryl H.,"Conyers, GA",0,27,1,5.0,3/13/2015,"Dinner here included Parmesan Crusted Chicken and Mediterranean pita tacos and a Chicken Club Flatbread.  Wow, we loved all three so much we came back the next night. We had two great servers, Beth and Rejeana.  Loved the atmosphere too, good place in the bar to watch sports."
Paul M.,"Mountain Home, AR",1,7,,4.0,5/23/2015,"I really like the beer at BJ's.   Coming from an area full of microbrews, Oklahoma doesn't offer a ton of selection.   BJ's is close and like I mentioned, have a very nice craft beer selection.   The menu is perhaps a bit too extensive, but the food is generally always good.   The pizza is much better than I would have expected.   The wait staff has always been good, but I did manage to get one server who was rather impatient with my father who was overwhelmed by the menu and hard of hearing.   Not sure why she was so distracted, the place wasn't busy, but I just ordered for my father and moved on."
Tom F.,"Durham, NC",0,8,1,1.0,12/21/2012,"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants to visit when we come to OKC but tonight was one of the worst dining experiences we've had there.  It was on Friday night.  We called in ahead to get on the the list and informed that it wasn't crowded and we could be seated immediately.  We arrived and waited over 30 minutes while people who even came in after us were seated first.  The hostess was rude to us and we talked to the manager who took care of us. It took a long time to get a server, drinks, order taken.  The food was horrible.  The Ahi tuna salad is close to $15.  It was a huge plate of lettuce with maybe an ounce of tuna.  The pizza was good but we had to go get plates ourselves to serve the pizza on.  After the meal was over, our waiter, Kenneth, didn't ask if we wanted dessert, but brought our check.  Once he returned our checks, as soon as we signed them, he came over, reached across all of us to get the receipts and made a point to retrieve his pens and headed back to the wait station to see what we had put on the ticket .  We felt very rushed and was not a pleasant experience, we won't be back, too many other places to choose from."
Steve M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",83,84,3,2.0,7/15/2012,"OK, this place really surprised me-----left me speechless which doesn't happen very often. First of all, the service was decent, it took us a while to go through the menu of about 16 pages. My son and I decided on the sirloin steak---we both got a caesar salad which was good and I got the white cheddar mashed potatoes and he got the horseradish white cheddar potatoes. My wife had some pasta dish with chicken which she liked but this review is more about what my son I ordered. They bring our food and on the plate there was the steak and a mound of mashed potaotes. Period. Nothing else. Not even a pat of butter or a smidgen of gravy for the potatoes. No bread. Not even a sprig of parsley for a garnish! Hello-----have you ever of the presentation of a meal? to make matters worse, my steak was undercooked and had to be sent back. After what seemed to be a long time, the steak was brought back cooked the way I ordered it but they didn't even bother to put it on a clean plate. My white cheddar mashed potaoes were nothing special--I couldn't tell if there was any cheddar in it. To be fair, my son liked the horseradish potato version. We decided not to try dessert opting for an ice  cream cone from Braums. Based on this visit don't look for me to sign up for their rewards program."
John T.,"Ada, OK",3,6,3,4.0,5/30/2014,Had the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer and it was delicious. Also for the main entree I thoroughly enjoyed the roast beef dip.  The AuJus was perfect as well as the ranch infused horseradish dipping sauce. I will coming back soon.
Ron P.,"Edmond, OK",66,50,9,4.0,3/16/2012,"If you wanna get your alcohol fix that is above 3.2%, then B.J.'s  Restaurant & Brewhouse has your flavor!   I would recommend sampling a pint of the Jeremiah Red!   Good times!"
Evan C.,"Austin, TX",609,13,,5.0,3/1/2015,"I usually go for the mom & pop restaurants instead of the national chain ones, but I have to make an exception for BJ's. Their steaks are selected from the finest cuts and well-done and seasoned to perfection. Pasta is sauted with the finest herbs and cheeses and served with a crunchy garlic bread. You won't have to worry about picking the wrong item because you will find something special in all of their menu items. I am one year away from being able to indulge in their handcrafted beverages, but all of my friends think they are smooth, refreshing, and unlike any that you'll find in your local convenience store. Wait times can take up to an hour during the weekends. This is the absolute top spot for birthdays and reunions. Their friendly staff will make sure that you have the ultimate experience that you wanted."
Frank W.,"Edmond, OK",252,46,10,3.0,2/11/2014,Eh I had the bbq bison burger with slaw and it was eh lol. The burger was dry and was suppose to be medium and my slaw was basically lettuce in balsamic vinegar SERIOUSLY. I am sure they have their good day but yesterday was not it.
Kim G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,29,,3.0,2/8/2014,"Food was decent. Went here with a couple people from work. 2 in our party had the parmasen crusted chicken. The cheesey potatoes were the best part of this meal. Chicken was flattened, like it had been pounded with a hammer, which caused it to be a little dry. Still tasted ok. The rootbeer was delish."
Cynthia S.,"Gardner, KS",22,10,,4.0,6/16/2015,Amazing!!!!  We only tried this place because a place we love right across the street had horrible service.  We went on a Friday night but were seated right away.  The greeters were very helpful and even helped us with signing up for their frequent customer program.  Waitress was helpful with what to order and let's not forget the beer which is amazing.  We will be back!
Vanilla P.,"Castro Valley, CA",154,1022,32,2.0,5/31/2013,"Waitress was fantastic, appetizer was good. Unfortunately, my flatbread tasted like shit and there were ants, yes ANTS, cruising along the windowsill and side of table. Gross. Fail."
Adam T.,"Norman, OK",5,14,10,5.0,5/18/2014,"They are very professional. Try their Tuscan Chicken, calamari, Jambalaya, and their BJ Pizza. Do not forget trying Pizooki!"
Hugh H.,"Edmond, OK",634,12,1,2.0,3/22/2014,"Overrated.  Long Island iced tea tastes like lemonade (not much alcohol). Huge portions of salmon in menu, but three little filets they brought out equaled one filet shown in pic. Then the manager justified photo...wanted to show detail. Uh huh. They did, however, bring me another filet. I probably won't be back though."
