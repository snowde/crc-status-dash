Stephen L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",481,342,120,1.0,2/15/2011,"My review of this restaurant is not based on the food. It is based on the awful experience that my girlfriend and I had on a Friday evening. As I said, we were going to eat at a chain restaurant on one of the busiest nights of the week. With this in mind we expected a bit of a hassle when it came to getting a table, but nothing like this. When I called ahead to find out what the wait time (at 6pm), I was told the wait was about 25min. The hostess said that they did not accept reservations, but they do ""call ahead waiting."" She explained that this is where you give your name, and as long as you checked in with the hostess in less than a half hour the time would go toward your wait. We were about 15mins away. So by the time we got there, as it was explained by the hostess, we would realistically only have to wait 10-15mins.  We put our name on the ""Call-ahead waiting"" list and went to the restaurant. When we arrived at BJ's I was told that it would be just a few minutes, but they didn't have anymore vibrating pagers, so I needed to come back in a bit to get one. I went back about 20min later, and was given a pager. She proceeded to tell me that they were really pack and it would be another 10mins. Another 20mins later I went to the hostess and was told that there was still 2 people ahead of me, but since ""they didnt come get a pager till after me"" that I would get to skip them. A little shady, but I went with it. The hostess then said it would be another 5mins. At this point a man and his girlfriend came up to the hostess and asked to speak to the manager. The manager came out and enthusiastically greeted him, as apparently they were good friends. The man asked the manager ""can you put me on the list for a table?"" To which the manager replied ""I'm not sticking you on the list, you can have the next table."" So after many people had been waiting over an hour, the manager bumped everyone for a friend. Not only low class, but while bending the rules is ok, its flat out dumb to do on one of your busiest nights. I then go back up to the hostess and explain that, with my ""call-ahead"" time, we had been waiting well over an hour and 15min. I was then told that putting your name on the call ahead list is different than the regular list. I was informed that my ""wait didn't begin until I showed up."" I then asked what the point of it was and was rudely informed that it was a technique developed by their parent company to get more customers to come in to eat in spite of a long wait. So the ""call ahead waiting"" is completely useless and dishonest.  She proceeded to seat us when I began to explain to customers that were walking in what the ""real"" wait time was. My girlfriend and I were seated immediately in a booth for 6 people. On their busiest night they sat 2 people in a booth, when there were huge parties waiting longer than us. Other than that the food was a typical performance by that of a chain restaurant. However, while I used to enjoy BJ's, I will never go back to this location. The manager is dishonest and so are the companies' policies."
David E.,"Edmond, OK",38,12,,5.0,8/8/2012,"This place is a staple in my go-to restaurant list. Like many people, I've dined there many times and my experience has been consistent with every visit. The parking can be a hassle if you're coming in on a busy night. Most people park in the mall parking lot and walk over. Luckily, I've not had to do that.  The waiting area is a bit smaller when you fit a few parties of 3-4 in there with your usual smattering of couples waiting for a table. We typically dine around 5:30-6ish since we get off work early, so the crowd usually isn't that bad. Though when we're on our way out, we have to say ""excuse me"" a few times trying to get out the side door instead of the revolving one.  Service is actually not that bad. There's been a few times when the waiter/waitress' mind was elsewhere or simply un-entertained by us. Though you'll find those people anywhere. Maybe they're not normally like that either. Anyhow, the wait staff is quite friendly and very informative when it comes to questions on the menu.  As for the food, my girlfriend loves their Santa Fe Salad as well as many other items. As for myself, I'm a one dish wonder. I've tried all of their burgers and would recommend any one of them. Though the reason I get the burgers every time isn't because of the way they cook them or prepare them. No, it's the crispy thin fries that come on the side. You can get the larger fries, but if you've tried the crispy thin ones, I don't know why you would. They're perfect. Ask for some ketchup and you can just sit back and enjoy your fries with or without it.  As for their selection of beers, you can't go wrong with a Jeremiah Red. I like to try their featured ""seasonal brew"" when a new one pops up, but I haven't gotten many. They're not bad though. Pumpkin Spice in the fall was a bit....interesting though.  Also, they offer online ordering and pickup of to-go orders, but you have to pay at the restaurant. No online transactions as of yet. The to-go area is usually very accurate on their pickup times as well. I showed up a little before it was time and they had just finished putting my order together. If you don't feel like going in, you can call the number on the sign that is posted in their to-go parking spaces. I used it once in the winter (felt kinda bad for the girl who brought it out to me though) and they're very compliant. Though good luck even getting into the to-go parking on a busy night. Some people just can't park and walk and would rather take those instead."
Joyce D.,"Tulsa, OK",240,257,629,3.0,2/10/2009,"So I don't head into the Oklahoma City area too much anymore.  But I went to visit my sister and we decided to grab some lunch.  She suggested BJ's. BJ's is similar to Gordon Biersch.  They brew their own beer and have a variety of 7 different beers.  The food here isn't as good as Gordon Biersch, but this is still a cool place.   It was funny to see my mother order the flight of 7 beers.  We were thinking they would just be samples, but they were about 8 ounces.  I ordered the Jeremiah Red and was pleasantly surprised.  This was a great red beer.  It was smooth, didn't have too much hops and was very tasty. I also ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger with Sourdough Bread.  This burger was super disappointing and really didn't do it for me.  The texture  was all wrong on this.  The bacon was dry.  The beef was dry.  The sourdough was toasted too much and the whole thing nearly dehydrated me.  The flavor wasn't their either. I had a slice of my mother's pizza, I believe it was the Mediterrianin it was surprisingly delicious."
Jennifer K.,"Oklahoma City, OK",8,10,,4.0,5/18/2011,"Great food.  They have their own beer all which are good.  They offer a beer tasting on the menu which is good for the indecisive.  I love their clam chowder, very creamy, fresh, and rich.  they make their own root beer which is absolutely lovely.   however...their call ahead seating is non-existent.  it is a separate list that they slowly work in with the regular list.  My boyfriend and I did the call ahead and still had to wait near forty-five min before getting the ""only one person ahead of you"" deal.  so good food, good drinks, but try to aim away from game days and weekend nights if you want less-stress meal."
Chris G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,7,14,4.0,12/28/2010,"I just wanna get this out of the way from the get-go: this place is kind of like a more casual version of Cheesecake Factory. Both of them feature a large variety of excellent menu selections (bound together in a spiral book, no less) and the atmosphere of each one just seems....nicer than your average restaurant chain. The main difference lies in BJs' emphasis on beer selection rather than Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake choices (alliteration is always awesome!), but I'm not really much of a beer drinker so I'm not really the one to review that side of things. If I WERE a beer drinker though, I'm sure I'd be pretty excited about the large selection these guys offer, especially since so many of them are on tap. They even give you a nice little menu that shows a sort of beer gradient from light to dark so you can easily tell what's what. Anyway, on to the food. The menu selections at BJ's are pretty diverse, including deep dish pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, soups, stuffed baked potatoes, seafood, fish tacos, pork chops, and more. I've been here several times and I've had a lot of different entrees but I still haven't come close to trying everything on the menu yet! By far, my favorite dish here is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which is a pair of chicken breasts coated with Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs before being pan fried. The white cheddar mashed potatoes they serve on the side are excellent. Yummy stuff here, guys. Thanks to the cold weather recently, I've also discovered a nice combination of items that warm me up every time: the Pale Ale Chili and the Gourmet Mac & Cheese. The chili alone could count as a meal because they serve it in a huge bowl, plus it has beans and chunks of pork and beef. Very hearty. The Mac & Cheese includes a few different cheeses and rotelle pasta (not actually macaroni) with bread crumbs and bacon on top. Also served in a tall bowl and is pretty filling on its own, and delicious besides. I've also tried their BBQ sandwich, a couple of different burgers, and their deep dish pizzas, all of which are tasty enough to recommend to others. I would also recommend the Pizookie for dessert, which is a big fresh-baked cookie with ice cream on top. They serve it in the little metal dish that it was baked in, which for some reason reminds me of something made in an Easy Bake Oven haha. Still, each type of Pizookie is pretty good although my two favorites are the chocolate chunk and peanut butter (which has actual peanuts cooked into the dough, mmmmmm). Service here has always been pretty good, especially the last time I was here a few weekends ago. It was a busy Sunday afternoon and our waiter was dealing with like 6 or 7 tables at once, but was handling it all very well. Even though he never seemed to stop moving, he was very genial and we were never left wanting for drink refills (nor was anyone else, as far as I can tell). Overall, definitely a restaurant I would recommend for people to try."
Ryan C.,"Edmond, OK",11,18,4,5.0,10/6/2013,"Really good food. Amazingly clean, even the duct work was dust free. Our water was nice and didn't rush us and gave us suggestions that were great! I always love this place."
Melissa S.,"Honolulu, HI",165,34,,5.0,8/26/2011,"Visited for the first time last week, ordered a small 5 meat pizza. The pie was delicious, toppings were portioned well. The ambiance and food were a 5. My brother ordered the mac and cheese as an appetizer and found a piece of 1/2 cooked plastic. He notified our server who apologized and replaced the item. The replacement was a 5 - served hot, delicious and tasty (and without plastic bits this time). What left a great deal to be desired was the way in which the restaurant manager handled the situation she approached our table looking frightened and said she was sorry, she didn't say what she was sorry for nor did she explain that we would not be billed for the mac and cheese. Before leaving she turned to my brother and said ""is there anything else?""  Our server returned to the table and asked if everything was to our satisfaction, she checked on my brother's mac and cheese which he said was yummy, she smiled and said ""good, is there anything else I can do to take care of you today?"" If I could give her 100 stars I would. Our server continued to check on us and made a point of refilling our drinks 3 times during the meal eventhough we didn't need them refilled. She was attentive, polite, responsive and she cared. The manager clearly mishandled the situation and needs retraining. This isolated incident didn't ruin our meal or my brother's birthday.  We intend on returning to the restaurant and hope the foreign object in the mac and cheese was an isolated incident."
Mac B.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,55,8,3.0,6/25/2011,"Have eaten here many times. Like most places along Memorial Rd, it is busy on Fri/Sat. They have added a bunch of smaller two person tables which may have cut down on wait times on the weekends. Big menu. I can't say I have ever really had a complaint about anything we have ordered. Service has always been good. The pizzas are good. But be aware they are very LIGHT on sauce. So if you like sauce, ask for extra. Otherwise you may be thinking there is none on there. The dessert beignet is very good. Not overly filling like some desserts and satisfies that sweet taste after the main meal."
Deena S.,"King of Prussia, PA",21,41,,5.0,11/25/2012,"best service. and i've tried several things on the menu but to be honest, nothing is better than their pizza! if i could afford it, i would eat here everyday!  just one thing.. one time i had the Creole Tilapia. and the olive sauce was wayyyy too much. everything was just way overwhelmed with the taste of olive. it almost made me feel nauseated."
Kelly G.,"Edmond, OK",0,14,,4.0,1/17/2015,"I have been here twice.  Both times I got the pork chops with apples.  The chops are tender and juicy.  I love this dish.  My mom got a burger once and the tomato bisque once.  She said both were great.  We got the potato skin once.  They had a lot of potato on them but, very little in the way if toppings.  Oh well, cannot expect to like everything on a menu.  Nice friendly atmosphere and service.  This is a place I will go back to."
Joshua D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",55,85,26,5.0,9/27/2012,Always great food and service at BJ's. The homemade rootbeer is a must. The blue cheese steak salad is awesome and I definitely recommend the flatbread pizza as an app.
Reuben R.,"Edmond, OK",3,12,,3.0,1/29/2012,"I have dined at BJs many times and every time it is great. However this one time I went with my friends during lunch. We called ahead to ask if we could order a desert to go and eat it there. The lady said no, so we ordered it togo anyway. When we got there, they hadn't packaged the desert up so we asked if we could just eat it there. She said ""Oh like you asked on the phone? NO (in a smirky attitude)."" We then asked a waiter and he said that would be fine. Then the manager came and gave us crap because we were minors. I called the corporate office and they gave me crap too. BJs is a good restaurant, but over priced. Do not go there without being ready to receive smirky and rude comments. 3 stars for previous experiences, but that is very generous."
A S.,"Bloomington, IL",0,16,,4.0,9/16/2014,"Was always a favorite place to stop when traveling to that area for work.  Good food, quick service and excellent atmosphere.  Are there for lunch and dinner.  Had appetizers, main courses and dessert, never a disappointment."
Last L.,"Omaha, NE",19,37,4,5.0,12/8/2010,"This place just has an awesome atmosphere from the start. Great bar area with nice TV's.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and fries. This was an awesome pulled pork sandwich. And gigantic. Surprisingly it didn't come with BBQ sauce on it, but it didn't need it, the meat was so tender and juicy. I added BBQ sauce anyway because I like it.  The beers they craft here are tremendous."
Francis F.,"Edmond, OK",99,20,2,4.0,5/4/2012,"Every time I've visited BJ's has been an enjoyable experience.  The wait has never been too long, and the service is prompt and courteous.  They specialize as a microbrewery, of which I am a fan, and their beers are all very good.  They also highlight their pizza on the menu and every time I've had it, it's been great.  I've also had their burger, very good, and a salmon dish that was excellent.  My daughter loves their house brewed root beer; say's it's the best.  This is great place for a date or to take the family."
Todd T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",3,121,,3.0,3/16/2012,Fun atmosphere but food average.  Reminds me of a place trying to do too much but not quite getting it right.  Good beer selections and you can mix some fun combos.   All in all not a place I can get very excited about.
Willie W.,"Edmond, OK",216,110,12,4.0,10/22/2013,"I call this place good ole trusty.  Let me explain, i usually go to this place when I cant decide on a new restaurant to attend or when I simply want a nice whiskey (in a glass) in a somewhat trendy environment.  I've been coming here for years with my wife and we've had nothing but rave reviews about BJs.  We usually start off with the chicken wings appetizer drizzled in hot sauce and ranch.  Just a tip though, If you decide to order this appetizer make sure you tell them that you want them well done.  When this place first opened up on Memorial I used to order the half chicken but since then the portion has dramatically decreased in size.  Not to worry YELP family, this place always has great food on the menu.  This is a great place to go and kick back and watch their massive television over the bar.  It's also a great place to go and get pre-drinks before you head out the the MAIN EVENT (night club).  So if you cant decide where to go just remember BJs is always open with great drinks and great food selections."
Mark H.,"Dardenne Prairie, MO",8,377,3,5.0,1/11/2012,"Awesome shrimp tacos!  Was here for lunch and the beers looked awesome as well.  Too bad I had to work..lol.  We need one of these in O'Fallon, MO!!  I was told the Flat Bread Pizza us phenomenal too."
Laura B.,"Berkeley, CA",2,10,,4.0,3/17/2014,"We had exceptional customer service during  our most recent experience! The restaurant was packed, the service was understaffed and the wait for service was ridiculous. However, this was a management issue, our service staff was outstanding. Melanie provided wonderful customer service while we dined in the bar area. She was working incredibly hard and had more customers than she should have had to manage in her section. She was friendly and hard working.  Additionally, our pizza order was made incorrectly. However, a man informed us of the mistake and provided the pizza on the house even though we stated this wasn't necessary. The staff was working hard and efficiently and I hope management provides additional staffing in the future."
Caroline V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,8,,4.0,8/2/2013,the oreo pakoozie was very good the ice cream that they make is fabulous. I had the pork chops that were nothing to brag about and will not order it again but the crispy jalapeno burger was to die for the bun was so soft and just looking at it immediately new I should have ordered it .
