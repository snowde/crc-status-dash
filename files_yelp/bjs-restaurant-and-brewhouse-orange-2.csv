Celeste C.,"Orange County, CA",7,13,5,5.0,12/30/2017,"My sister & I came to have dinner at this location this evening and we had a great experience! The wait time to be seated was like 15-20 min, which was fine considering they were busy, so totally understandable. We finally got seated and our waiter Alex Vargas took care of us immediately. He was very attentive, kept checking on us, and was very informative about the menu! I think it was great how well Alex's service was even though it was a really busy night at the restaurant. He deserves some sort of recognition. Great job, keep up the good work, and we will definitely be back.  Thank you for everything."
Victor G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,1,1.0,12/31/2017,"I have been going to this BJ's for a few years, and was good, but on my last few visits, (unusually go ones or twice per week here) service has been terrible, the wait takes long time, and when finally get seated takes for ever for someone to come and take order, and to bring it.  today 12/31/2017 we sit on bar side and was the worst ever, 15 min for someone to bring menu, and after an additional 15 no one came to take even drinks order and we are at bar side,.  i ask front desk why? and i was told that they were short on servers, same story i got other times, maybe they don't call them or what ever it is, service at this location is horrible. i had to leave and went next door TGI FRIDAY,  we were eating there 15 mins after we arrived there. unless you don't care about this don't go to this location."
Julianne M.,"CA, CA",154,12,4,1.0,12/4/2017,"This review is solely on a server's service. My husband and I met here on our first date and as tradition, we visit this restaurant every year on the day and time of our first date.  We had made reservations but had to wait 15 additional minutes as they didn't have seating available as it was a slightly busy night. We were seated in the outdoor area where there weren't many others as it was a chilly night, our server is a young male, in his late 20's to early 30's, shaved head with horned rim glasses. You could say that this dude was your typical hipster looking server. He asked us what we would like to drink and I requested a Sierra Mist with mint leaves. About 15 minutes later, we get our drinks and my drink has 2 small leaves which looked more like lettuce pieces. I called our server back and asked if I could get a few more mint leaves and he then goes to tell me that he would need to charge $1 for mint leaves because it's not standard to the drink. Okay? I dropped the issue and asked if I could just get a different drink as I didn't want to get into an argument over mint. We ordered our food and I ordered their prime rib special.  It took both my husband and my food about an additional 45, 50 minutes to get to our table but it's not a big deal. We weren't ""that"" hungry and we were celebrating our anniversary. Now, by the time we did get our meals, our drinks are empty and need a refill and our server took our cups and disappeared. Slightly uncomfortable to eat without our drinks but we weren't going to complain. We flagged down a busser and asked for our drinks and he came out a minutes later with our drinks. About 10 minutes later, our server comes to our table and is like ""I got you your drinks! Oh someone already brought them?!"" Seriously? At this point, I am starting to get bugged out by the server but I don't want to ruin the night. My Prime Rib meal comes with a Pizookie and I had to flag down a few hostesses to grab my server. Finally was able to tell him that we wanted our dessert, he brings out the mini size Pizookie and our bill. We were pretty full so a mini size was fine but my meal comes with a full size Pizookie, not the mini. As we are eating our dessert, I begin to discuss business with my husband about upcoming filming schedules and production editing when our server who has been nearly absent our entire meal butts into our conversation and asks ""Sorry to interrupt but are you in the film industry? I work in the film industry too! I'm a camera man... etc."" Up until this point this guy has been rude, can't get our orders right, slow service and he's been snooping around listening to our conversation? He overstayed his welcome at our table to tell us about the ""experience"" he has, how he only likes working indie smaller crews, and how serving isn't his ""real passion"" and that it's important for us to network? Kid, get out of my face. It was the most uncomfortable dinner we have had in a very long time. He asked if we could exchange information and we politely declined as we are not interested in working with someone that only lights up to be helpful when its beneficial to them. We took a look at our bill and he even charged us for a full size Pizookie when it should have been included in my meal AND our server gave us a mini size one. We asked another server and she fixed the bill right away. I almost left without tipping due to how arrogant the server was and how uncomfortable we felt at the end of our meal. BJ's, if you're reading this, please tell that server to mind his own business!"
Katelynn M.,"Orange, CA",291,72,208,3.0,11/27/2017,"Good, bad, but mostly inconsistent. I have come to this location about 4 times now and each was very different than the others. I sat at the bar twice and in the dining area twice. Both bar area experiences were great, but when I was put in the dining area, the service was much slower. At one visit, we waited an hour to get our food and 30 minutes for our beer to come out. We were not checked on, and it seems like they forgot about us for a while.  Glad they changed their menu because they now have some great new items that I am excited to try!  I ordered the pork chop off the specials menu and wow! It was delicious! This made me believe that BJs can do more than just make bomb pizza.   The monkey bread pizookie is arguable the best dessert they have. I order this 3 times at this location and twice it tasted like a freshly cooked sticky bun without the icing. The third time I had it, it was dry and almost stale. I used the ice cream to soften it to eat it and I didn't complain because I was too shy to do so. This is one example of why I say they are inconsistent.  The only thing that is consistent is the wait staff. They have some great servers who are kind and pretty funny! One in particular was a gentleman who helped us in the bar section on a Monday night. He was very attentive to our group and he had an awesome cherry blossom arm tattoo. His jokes made our night! Never got his name, but kudos to you sir!  Hopefully when you come here, you have a positive experience! I will be back for the good food and great bar service."
Veronica C.,"Orange, CA",22,63,20,5.0,1/6/2018,"Always good food and service. We've been to this Bjs 20-30 times and never disappoints. Bjs has a fair amount of Vegan offerings found by doing a google search. Tonight I had chips and salsa with a soup/salad combo. Vegan lentil soup (a good lentil as lentils go) with the asparagus and portobello salad (minus the goat cheese). My husband had the Peruvian quinoa bowl that required no alteration to be vegan although he added salmon (he is plant based + fish).  The wait was 25-30 mins but we got called after 18, 5:30 on a Saturday.  :-)"
Earl S.,"La Habra, CA",31,20,26,5.0,1/6/2018,I came here on a whim. I miss her still. I decided to get house meatballs paired woth a side of Dark side. Very good.  For 13$ you cant beat this deal
K M.,"Whittier, CA",10,68,48,3.0,12/23/2017,"One of my favorite spots, especially for happy hour!!!  I went there for lunch today & had the mini pizza with soup or salad!!! Had the clam chowder soup which tasted exactly like Campbell's clam chowder!!! I ordered sausage & peppironi pizza (paid extra for the second topping) & they generously gave me lots of sausage to makeup for the pepperonis (well worth the extra $1.25)!!! When my cookie's cream mini pizookie came out there was a hair in it, so they remade it & didn't charge me for it!!! The waitress was really good!!!"
Jen E.,"Orange, CA",110,376,100,2.0,11/28/2017,"I have to admit it's been a fair amount of time since I last entered into a BJ's.  I never was a great fan of their pizza, but they had this amazing giant baked potato with chicken, broccoli & an alfredo sauce -- so I thought, ""Hey why not return.""  In my time away, the menu has gotten a lot bigger & the emphasis on pizzas has wained (also no more baked potato in all those pages of options, sadly). The mozzarella sticks were good, but unfortunately I could not say as much for the chicken sandwich. It wasn't horrible, but it's the same here as with a lot of chain restaurants -- they add so much stuff (ham, on top of bacon, on top of sauce) that you aren't sure what you are eating -- and then when you pick it apart you realize there's so much stuff because none of it has any real flavor.  And then I felt that gross kind of too full, sick, greasy feeling the rest of the night.  That my daughter, who had the veggie burger, felt the same way, and my other daughter who had the sliders only ended up eating one of them -- I'm thinking it's more universal than just me.   The service was okay.  Our waiter, was super nice, but also super busy with a lot of other large tables.  So, I don't blame him on being slow -- I blame management, hire some more servers!"
Rachel A.,"Anaheim, CA",3,13,10,5.0,1/2/2018,"Came here on a Tuesday and had Michelle as our server. Got a plethora of food, which included drinks and because it was happy hour, they had great prices! Ended with 2 pizookies (cookies & cream and peanut butter smores)! The service was great and fast. Would definitely recommend, especially Michelle!"
Nancy N.,"Garden Grove, CA",155,76,162,3.0,11/14/2017,"I went here with my sister and nephew before going to the outlet. Let's see...it's not like I haven't been here before, but it's been awhile.  The service: the servers were helpful in a sense. They got every item we asked, such as an extra plate or spoon. However, they forgot to set the utensils in the first place. But overall the service wasn't too bad The food - let's start off with the clam chowder; the soup was warm ( maybe that's how it is or maybe it was on the pass for too long), which I don't mind, but my sister had a different opinion. The clam had a smell and it wasn't creamy.   The second dish was the prime rib; it was 15 oz (its huuuge). I didn't like the horseradish dip much. In the end my sister had to ask for the a1 sauce.  I think the best part was pizookie because it balanced the saltiness from the food we ate. We randomly went to eat here, but I won't returning for awhile."
Dominick L.,"Garden Grove, CA",246,166,338,3.0,11/14/2017,"We came at dinner when it was extremely busy. We were seated after 20 minutes. Our waitress and, later, waiter were very nice the whole time. Took our order of water and two other drinks, mozzarella sticks and medium pepperoni pizza.  Drinks came in about 5 minutes, the mozzarella sticks 5 later. Drinks were good. The appetizer was ok. Not really hot, ok tasting.  Pizza came about 20 minutes later. Hot and it tasted ok. Not amazing, but filled us up.  We then ordered the dessert I forgot the name of. I got triple chocolate--loved it. Took about 20 minutes for that to arrive. We ate it and then left.  Everything was good and I want to give it 4 stars, but wait time was very long. Decent items and very nice employees, however."
Nikkie P.,"La Palma, CA",5,110,224,5.0,10/19/2017,The best customer service I have experienced at a BJ's restaurant. Our waiter gladly gave us a refund without us asking for it when the dish we ordered was not fresh and tasted bad. He was attentive on a busy Friday night and consistently kept checking on our table making sure we were doing good. Pizzas came out piping hot and plenty left for leftovers. We tried the new churro pizookie and loved it. The churros were fresh and they were bite size - perfect for sharing. This is a hidden location in the Block of Orange so the parking is a bit easier since it is not in the busy section of the shopping area.
Adastelia S.,"Upland, CA",3,5,5,1.0,10/8/2017,"All BJ's are NOT created equally and this is NOT the BJ's for you!  The photo below is the ""new fresh"" avocado rolls we received after sending back the first batch.  When the manager was called for the second time he continually walked past our table avoiding confrontation. We sat long enough for me to write this entire review.  Overall the service was bad, we got an incompetent waitress with a bad attitude, the food was burnt and the manager was undertrained. Please choose a different bjs location, save your money and a bad experience."
Mario S.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,105,73,5.0,12/24/2017,For some reason it's not letting me check in so I'm just writing a shorty Mgr.Miguel definitely makes this establishment shine we need more people like him not only being a good manager but in the whole world!
Vivian T.,"Anaheim, CA",216,86,24,5.0,12/10/2017,We got the family size pizookie. Best foil in town!!! Tin out of tin foil! We'll foil again!
Ronny T.,"Garden Grove, CA",249,76,60,4.0,11/29/2017,"First off, BJ's is so littt. They have a variety of food from burgers to steak to vegetarian stuff. It's suitable for anyone to come by and enjoy a great meal. Since this location in particular is near the outlets of orange, it is generally crowded. Especially on weekends, expect a wait time before being seated. The time varies, but you're going to have to wait hence ""wait time"".   Inside the restaurant, the ambience is pretty mellow, not too obnoxiously loud and not too quiet. Everyone is just having a good time enjoying their meals. For me, the wait time was around 30 min before we got seated. I ordered the house top sirloin with no vegetables cause all you need is carbs and protein right? Just kidding I'm not a big fan of greens that's why. What was surprising to me was that on the menu it stated that it's only 500 calories. Lowkey when I saw that I thought I was tripping because all that for 500 calories is pretty spectacular. I had doubts but didn't want to think about it so I wouldn't feel guilty and stuff. I asked the waiter if I can get my meat rare cause rare is the way to go for meat. Don't sleep on rare. Fortunately, BJ's do have the rare option so that's clutchhh. Anyways it costs around 18 bucks but it's healthy so I can't complain. Since the restaurant was crowded, it took a while but the food is so great you can smell it before it got to your table . I took a bite out of the sirloin and that meat is straight fire I kid you not. The meat is really pink but like you know it's safe and stuff which makes the food even better ! The meat has a perfect mixture of dryness and fat, which satisfies your craving instantly. Each bite you can just taste how fresh the meat and how well it was made. The meal comes with rice and mashed potatoes which taste amazing as well, especially the mashed potatoes. Rice tastes like rice so hard to describe it . Overall, BJ's is a place that has  delicious food that is fit for everyone. It doesn't matter if you're vegetarian, the one term for people who only eats fish, vegan, bulking, cutting, etc... come through BJ's for some amazing food and a great time!"
Amie T.,"Anaheim, CA",259,2,1,5.0,12/10/2017,We got the family size pizookie. Best foil I've ever had!!!!! Tin out of tin will foil again!
Michael M.,"Anaheim Resort, Anaheim, CA",3013,75,587,4.0,12/20/2017,"I've been to numerous BJ's restaurants dotted all around Northern Orange County. The one in Huntington Beach is my favorite on Beach Boulevard as far as overall ambience and location are concerned. Nice little quiet stream to the right of the restaurant is tranquil. Patio seating is desirable here. Hospitable greeters, upbeat and friendly service. Good craft ales (I like the amber the best), and good supply of food entrees to satisfy your cravings. My favorite hot sandwich is the Roast Beef Dip au jus! Thin pizzas here are well seasoned and have a great flavor. Usually not too loud unless it's football Sunday. I never turn down an offer to go to BJ's!"
Tony P.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,32,28,5.0,11/26/2017,BJs.. what a great restaurant. They have a very good selection in the menu. The desserts are just full of taste. I'm not a beer drinker but saw people zipping on some drinks and having a good time. Their patios outside are very nice. Place is close to the theater and to the shopping block.....the block.
Paul G.,"Santa Ana, CA",695,456,2499,4.0,8/15/2017,BJ's pizza never fails to please.  They probably have the best sit down restaurant pizza that one can buy.  Service here is pretty decent if you sit near the bar or the surrounding area.  Been to BJ's many times and have never been disappointed.
Zac C.,"Anaheim Resort, Orange, CA",53,26,,2.0,11/20/2017,Don't come here when it's busy. It took 25 minutes to get our food. The waiter forgot about us and I had to go look for her. We waited 35 minutes for our pazooki. How long does it take to make a tiny cookie with a scoop of ice cream?!!! Finally we waited another 15 min for them to return our cards after paying. As a final slap in the face they gave us free pazooki coupons but you have to spend A MINIMUM OF $10! Outrageous. Just really poor management.
Nicole G.,"Anaheim, CA",210,109,501,3.0,4/14/2017,"I remember BJ's being a very cool place to go to maybe it's just this location but it was kind of disappointing, my friend and I came for happy hour and when we asked about certain drinks she didn't know if they were shot or martinis. Which is fine, but when I asked if she could find out she said no. Which I found really odd. The restaurant is the really nice looking cool atmosphere.  I ended  up getting a drink that was for banana pudding martini and it was really good. We also ordered an appetizer sampler. It really just tasted like a bunch of frozen food warm up and put on a plate. I remember really liking the avocado rolls but they were not very tasty and quite disappointing this visit.  I used to be a major BJ's fan and I don't know if the quality just suffering now or just this location."
Heather B.,"Long Beach, CA",24,86,95,4.0,9/4/2017,I haven't been to a BJs in years and now I want to come here every Sunday lol! Their prime rib is amazing!!!!!!!! You really get your money's worth plus they have a killer bloody marry. The service was great and fast. They brought my sons food out fast- I always order his first thing and they brought it out within 10 minutes! We will definitely be back!
Anish P.,"Orange, CA",148,5,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I don't usually post reviews, but today was something else. Came in for dinner tonight, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had anywhere. Our server initially came by about a minute after we sat down and asked if we were ready. When we asked for a few more minutes, it was more than 20min before he showed up again despite being flagged down a few times. It took another half an hour for the food.. which would usually been understandable except the place was pretty empty. The server throughout was dismissive and uninterested. With all the places around the outlets and area, will definitely give this place a pass next time"
Mckenna D.,"Anaheim, CA",222,157,173,3.0,1/26/2017,"I'm never 100% sold on why people always insist on bringing me here because I'm not a fan of their pizzas, like ever.  However, I am a big fan of their avocado egg rolls and their Pizookies so I guess I'll keep coming back.  Anyways, my group ordered a large pizza: half The Great White and the other half pepperoni, the brussel sprouts, and wings.  Not eating any meat I passed on the wings and dove into those brussel sprouts.   I had a slice of The Great White pizza, which is chicken alfredo on a pizza.  I picked off the chicken and it was far too rich for me.  The crust at BJ's is incredibly buttery (greasy?) and I don't really like the taste of it.  Is it supposed to be deep dish? I think so but it never sits well with me.  I only half enjoyed it when I added red pepper flakes to it.   Brussel sprouts were really good.  Fried to a crisp then topped with a honey sriracha sauce? Yes please! These are a solid crowd pleaser.  Avocado egg rolls are always a delight.  They are exactly as they sound plus a spicy cream sauce inside and topped with cilantro and coupled with a sweet/salty dipping sauce.   Of course we ended with the classic chocolate chip Pizookie. Warm cookie plus ice cream equals the perfect ending to an ok dinner.   This is a good place for a group. You'll find something on the menu, but usually everything here tastes better after a beer."
Ivan C.,"Anaheim, CA",246,75,147,2.0,7/22/2017,"I usually don't review huge chains like this and what not...... but today I will. We went here tonight and used the BJs app to wait for our table... that worked in our favor. Once we got there our table was ready. We ordered a kids mac n cheese with fruit A small pizza: half great white and the other 5 meat. Not gonna lie I felt that our pizza was mushy and under cooked but since we WAITED like 30 min for our food, we just ate it since my 2 daughters and my gf were ""Hangry"" ahahah..... it is what it is. Our waiter was great but couldn't recall on his name... It was wasn't the service staff, I'm sure it was all the kitchen . I'm sure we'd return because of that pazookie :)"
Reyna F.,"Coconut Creek, FL",3,44,64,5.0,10/20/2017,Just wanted to give a big ups to my server Rudy. I was here on October 19th and Rudy was personable and ready to answer any questions I had. The food was great as usual.
Skylar V.,"Lakewood, CA",468,155,532,4.0,3/24/2017,"BJs off city drive is a modernized BJs that provides a great ambiance for brunch, lunch, dinner and date nights. The location is perfectly placed off the freeway inside the Orange Outlets lot. Parking can be a bit busy on weekends and during their 11am to 3pm lunch special during weekdays. BJs has a phenomenal lunch menu that is affordable, delicious, and has numerous healthy low calorie options. Their beer menu is delicious as well! Their blonde ale, red ale, and porter are my favorite beers. Personally, I have not had problems with service at this location, but I've heard some stories from friend and family that they have long wait times for order taking and getting food. They have outside patio seating, nice flat screens, and a stacked lit up bar. The bar area also has nice dining seating and I have had previous experiences sitting at the bar and it was a great experience. Overall, I'll keep returning to this location, plus it's nice because you can take a break from shopping or eat before/after seeing a movie."
Cindee P.,"Garden Grove, CA",22,122,48,5.0,10/31/2017,"We came in and sat at the dining area. Our waitress, Liz, told us that happy hour was only at the bar. And we replied, ""aw."" So Liz asked her manager if we could get the happy hour and her manager replied sure!  Our avocado egg rolls took a while & when we ordered tomato soup - out. Broccoli cheddar soup - out.  Liz felt so bad that she asked her manager if she could let us have it on the house. Thanks so much Liz!! You definitely made our stay worthwhile even when it wasn't turning in our favor."
Ivy C.,"Garden Grove, CA",174,336,1132,3.0,1/14/2017,"BJ's is best known for their pizzas but to my surprise, I ended up like their salad and appetizers more. We ordered the 5 meats and BJ's favorite pizza which were both pretty good, but it was just that the crust was so bready and dry. The Cobb Chicken salad was tasty. I loved the dressing, avocado, and the smoky pieces of chicken.The appetizers we got - cabbage wraps and chips with artichoke dip - were also yummy. All of these were better than the pizza itself.  Our server (I think his name was Casey?) was all around great. He got us everything we needed, helped us use a coupon (Buy 1 entree, get 1 free with the purchase of 2 drinks), and hooked the birthday boy up with a complimentary pizookie. And man, oh man, was that mini white chocolate pizookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream plopped on top was DELICIOUS. I'm telling you that pizookies are not overrated at all and whether it's your birthday or not, you should still order it for dessert.  I give BJ's more of a 3.5 since although everything else was pretty good, their popular deep dish pizzas did not live up to its ""hype."" It's a good thing the pizookie did!"
Victoria B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",66,22,22,3.0,12/16/2017,"BJ's was known for great pizza and microbrew... the menu has changed so much, I feel they have lost touch with what we fell in love with in the first place. It's fine that the rest of your menu items are delicious, but when you order the one thing that brought you to love this place, the pizza falls flat. I would have given two stars but a star goes to my new favorite server, Donovan from WA. Donovan, thank your for your enthusiasm, thank you for making our party smile!"
Jennifer ..,"Newport Beach, CA",0,38,26,1.0,7/1/2017,At the resturant right now.... took 15 minutes to be asked what we wanted to drink.  Took another 10 minutes to get the drinks. The drinks are now empty and we can't get anyone's attention..... service is SO slow. We have empty plates from our starters sitting here and no one has come to check. What happened to the service here? The manager came to the table HE got us drink then came back to refill them. He was so sweet. He kept coming back to check on us and removed the drinks from the check. THAT'S service.
Los R.,"Downey, CA",37,11,1,1.0,12/27/2017,So the manager   replied and asked if I would email him. I did about 2 weeks ago and he hasn't replied! Just when I thought wow at least the manager is doing his job right! I guess not... and for that we will not go back!! I guess he figured by replying to my yelp review everyone would think he's doing his Job...
Marti M.,"Orange, CA",56,27,22,2.0,8/9/2017,"I took home my leftovers (ate 1/2 of everything) Sirloin steak, garlic green beans & bake potato. Steak had no flavor and was NOT juicy... garlic green beans were NOT garlicky.... Dessert was great! We had the baked beignet, mmmmm!! Strawberries, whip cream and ice cream!"
Cody P.,"Anaheim, CA",151,58,132,3.0,6/20/2017,"I've been here a couple of time with family and friends and although I've never been really impressed I wouldn't object if someone wanted to eat here after shopping. ""Meh"" seems like a pretty good way to describe this place. The most exciting part of this place is probably the name. Honestly, it's ok... If you're hungry and tired after shopping at The Block and want to sit down somewhere to eat, this is definitely an option. The waiters don't check in on you that much so you'll be able to get some rest (shade shade shade)  As for food, you should probably get the ribs, some wings, or a burger. I actually liked the root beer chicken wings so give those a shot. Tonight I had the jambalaya which I didn't really enjoy. I didn't really get anything from it but heat."
Alysha M.,"Anaheim, CA",175,8,1,5.0,11/8/2017,"I came in tonight 11/8 around 745. It was really busy but we got seated within 10 minutes. This review is mainly for my server Benjamin B. He did a fantastic job and was VERY attentive. Usually when I walk in somewhere and it's crowded I automatically assume you won't get very consistent service, but, he proved me wrong. I had a long day at work and just wanted to replace and eat with my boyfriend and get in and out and he helped.  Thank you so much!!"
Rus M.,"Anaheim, CA",56,195,1257,3.0,11/24/2016,"Dinner date with my wife while sitting at the bar.  I prefer to sit at the bar now at this location because I feel the service is a somewhat better.  Nothing against the waiters and waitresses in the dining area, but they just seemed to be bogged down with so many tables and are a bit slower. (from past experiences).  Seems like they've changed their menu a bit as well.  I've never seen Brussells sprouts before and it seems to be the new fad.  I was leary about trying them because, well, it's an item I haven't seen before and I've had amazing brussells sprouts elsewhere. So I decided to give them a try, since they were a fairly good price. Surprisingly, they were really good. The Brussels sprouts were a creamy and crunchy and toasty, like the were sauteed in butter, there was fresh grated, melted cheese over top and it was plentiful.  ( BJ'S do not change this recipe!)  My wife had the DOS Tacos Plato's. Well that's what I'm calling it, because there were two tacos on a plate and I don't remember the real name of the dish.  I think they should change it to my name instead. Haha. Anyways I digress. There were two succulent butter sautéed shrimp tacos with dressed with cabbage and onions.  A little on the small side, but it did its job.   If you're in the area and are looking for a quick bite drop in.  Cheers!"
Thomas B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",28,8,2,1.0,11/1/2017,"This just feels bad to share. I just spent the past few hours at UCI with a friend who had surgery. I joked about seeing BJ on the way there. I've never eaten at a BJ before. On the way home I pulled in to order food to go. Nashville Hot Chicken Wings:  My wings were plain. No seasoning, not even salt. I had 3 wings (all the same) before adding tobacco. Somethings off.  Ribeye (medium) and asparagus:  after those wings I'd hope the steak was on point. My steak... again medium... was completely rare. I knew something had to be up when the hostess (she gets this star, she was great) told me my foods already done, just waiting on the asparagus. My first experience at BJ'S. I just wanted some food. I don't know how the experience is table side, but no shits were given, to my food at least, because my food was to go."

Both always made sure I was content and went above and beyond to keep me happy! My server and the bartenders were the best, thank you Bjs for the best experience I've had! Definitely will be back for more!"

She was great and patient with our large party and was able to speak to the kids in a sweet and approachable manner. Thank you Tara! My niece would like to add ""She was a nice lady"".  Thank you BJ's and thank you Tara for a great birthday dinner with my family!"
