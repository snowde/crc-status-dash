Denisse A.,"Anaheim, CA",6,13,10,1.0,1/17/2017,Every time I go to ANY BJs I always get very bad service . Our server (Barbara) didn't really check up on us. We asked for water refills and a box. she went to other tables got their boxes first then walked by us again and took a while to bring us our box and water. She only filled mine and forgot to refill my boyfriends drink. She seemed in a hurry running back and forth . We just wanted to leave after we got our box and she was taking a while to come pick up our payment . We decided we were gonna go pay at the front and then she finally decided to approach us and rudely said we pay with her and not at the front . So I just gave her my card and she processed that quick . I f she can't handle that many tables she shouldn't take on that responsibility! Never again .
StarFruitNinja.com ..,"Orange County, CA",11,63,664,2.0,5/12/2016,No wonder this place is rated so low! Both our pizza and jambalaya came out lukewarm! The pizza is super soggy and the jambalaya has no taste. They call this deep dish? It's more like pizza toppings on top of a loaf of bread! One slice is enough carb for the week.
Kevin L.,"Anaheim, CA",504,168,69,4.0,8/26/2015,"Many times I've been here, good ol' BJs. Service can be slow at times even when there aren't that many customer. If you forget to ask for something when it gets brought to you, you might have to wait for a while till a server comes around.  No complaints on the food, average BJs food. Fan of the pizza but doesn't compare to Chicago deep dish!"
Linda R.,"Orange, CA",0,1,1,5.0,3/26/2017,"One of the best experiences I've had in a long time. Melissa, Barbara, and of course Casey! You guys rock! You made this first timer become a patron for life. 25 people you served at the same time, with great food to boot..sorry we didn't take pics of the food we had..its the service for us that counted the most. Memorable"
Izzy H.,"Orange, CA",282,143,147,4.0,11/10/2016,"Great lunch special and prompt service = happy repeat customer!  This is one of my favorite lunch spots.  Great portions, reasonable price, prompt server, and unavailable value.  I highly recommend their lunch combo, 1 entree + soup.  Make sure you ask for bread bowl and enjoy your lunch!!"
Ryan N.,"San Diego, CA",328,3,,1.0,10/13/2016,"THIS PLACE HAS GOT ME CUTTING WEIGHT DRASTICALLY!! I came in one jam packed afternoon after not eating dinner the day before; needing a pick me up. So I ordered whatever Octoberfest beer being promo'd, some brussel sprouts, and calamari. HELL YA CALAMARI. Only the mental and prude don't like calamari. Anyway, it's pretty safe to say I was feelin myself. Few hours later..I started feelin something else. My body ached more than an old sign language teacher's hands. My insides began to bubble like the mudpots in yellowstone, LIKE the cauldron of an evil wart faced witch! And throughout that SAME night I have passed the point of no return. No priest could exorcise the vile hex that had inhabited my core.  That night I visited the porcelain alter that doubled as a throne, every hour ON the hour, in attempt to rid me of this putrid poison.  And til this DAY. 9 DAYS AFTER CONSUMING THEIR FOOD. My guts still rumble with the remnants of foul play. It grumbles periodically as if I'm about to birth a baby velociraptor waiting to reek havoc. I wish this upon no man. Upon no enemy.  TLDR: Got food poisoned. Ded."
Minkkwan W.,"Los Angeles, CA",242,375,625,3.0,6/14/2016,"Always a great spot to host a large party dinner. They are super accommodating! Love the big screens all over the restaurant showing anything from hockey to baseball to basketball games. Free refills on soft drinks. Great beers on tap. The calamari is well made, and the Brussels sprouts are delicious! The sampler platter is a nice option to feed a large table. The deep dish pizzas are dough heavy and nothing like a true authentic Chicago deep dish pizza, but hey, give the BJs Special a try it's not too bad!"
Ricardo B.,"Montclair, CA",2,45,9,2.0,1/10/2017,Well got here a bit ago checked in told 15-20 minute wait for a table so sat at bar and actually got called /texted bout 5-10 minutes if that while I sat at bar with a RED after being seated for about 10-15 minutes starving I might add I thought I had no server for a bit but like I said 10-15 minutes later here comes this young kid I didn't let him speak and said to him dam thought I didn't have a sever he replied oh I got caught up with this other party I said dam 10-15 minutes there are only two people in that party must be all that dam gossip. He apologized as I'm starving but oh well don't want to complain to much don't want extras on my pizza lmao just ventilating!!!!!
Yanett G.,"Irvine, CA",3,48,248,2.0,7/12/2017,"When I was getting seated I was told I'd be getting a booth but was shortly seated at a table. After having to ask 3 separate people to be moved to a booth, me and my party of 4 were FINALLY moved to a booth. We waited at least 10-15 minutes before a waitress finally came to us and asked if we had been served. She took our food and drink order, because at this rate we were more than ready to order. One of the people in my party is a rewards member and gave her the phone number associated with the account. She appeared to type it into her iPad but when we got the bill it wasn't listed. At this point our waitress is nowhere to be seen so we walked up to the hostess desk to pay but she then had to take the bill to the manager to add the rewards number. We see her run back and hand the bill to our waitress and then she ran off and had to speak to the same manager. After all this running around we were finally able to pay our bill and get out of this place! I believe this will be my last visit to this location because clearly the employees here don't work together as a team and as a customer we are the ones who are affected by this inadequacy."
Desirée G.,"Placentia, CA",261,4,1,5.0,8/15/2016,The tall blonde girl Destiny was very nice and helpful while I was there.She helped me have an amazing experience while enjoying my favorite restaurant. THANK YOUUUU DESTINYYYYY!!
Eva P.,"Orange, CA",25,20,11,5.0,10/21/2016,This BJ's is my favorite. Their menu is bigger then other locations I've been to. The service and food is great and I never have left here and been dissatisfied.
Amy L.,"Oxnard, CA",64,50,13,2.0,12/30/2016,The waiter was great super nice and did a good job as our waiter. However we ordered the lemon thyme chicken and it was ridiculously salty. Not only was the chicken was salty but the rice was also salty. It was completely unedible. They brought us another plate fairly quickly and even though the rice was still unneccessary salty it was edible but i wouldnt consider it good. They said they werent going to charge us for the chicken thyme but when the check came we still got charged. Maybe i misunderstood and they meant the second plate wouldnt be charge but why would they charge us for remaking a plate that wasnt edible? Whatever we paid and left but i dont reccommend this bjs and we wont be coming back.
Julius Patrick V.,"Irvine, CA",385,212,157,4.0,10/11/2015,"Ate here with a group of friends on a chill Saturday night at the block. It was pretty nice restaurant compared to other BJs. The food is of course American Dining at its middle class finest. I was fairly satisfied with the quality of the chicken plate that I got. But I was craving dessert more so, so when they told us they had pumpkin pie; my friends and I had to try it. And it was delicious! Our server however was weird. Coming in to help when we didn't need help, but not being there and leaving work when we needed him. It was an overall nice place to eat at with a group."
Omar R.,"Anaheim, CA",656,144,560,1.0,6/27/2015,Very bad service and gave a lot of attitude.  They told us we were 31 dollar short and then she came back to us saying everything was fine and we just needed to give her a tip. Tip for what? For having bad attitude?  A horrible first time experience and the steak that I ordered was good. I understand my steak was medium rare doesn't mean it has to be cold ha. The waiter droped my fires on me. Probably never coming here again.
Junior V.,"Anaheim, CA",370,10,,4.0,2/24/2017,"They have a wait time but it's worth it , especially to go on a date it's great it's nice and chill vibe that they have and they are quick with the food too"
Rebecca L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",45,24,4,4.0,2/23/2017,Our server Allyson was very sweet she could have been a little more attentive. But being very busy I can understand. The food as always is yummy
James H.,"Los Angeles, CA",298,3,,5.0,3/5/2017,"Anthony Ocampo was our server tonight. He was amazing. Before my drinks were finished, another one arrived. So friendly, attentive, kind... I will be back because of this kid. And the food... OMG! I'm so full right now. This place was amazing. Coming back tomorrow."
Debby U.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,8,,5.0,2/17/2017,Michelle H was awesome great service great food we will be back ! Came in on a whim sat in bar area !
Jasson C.,"Orange, CA",9,74,89,2.0,4/10/2016,"Well... Where do I start... Service was horrible took forever...drinks, food and my sister's food took about 10mins after everyone else had food and pretty much ate. Don't get me wrong the food was great but just the service was poor.... BJs need to work on their service first because the quality of food is high. Maybe next time, I don't recommend for people with large families or parties.."
Mister O.,"Buena Park, CA",0,7,5,2.0,7/3/2016,Food is pretty good but the service was pretty sad. We waited for about 30 mn for only 1 pizza. Drinks after good but service was weak.
