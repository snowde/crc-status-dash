Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",298,1007,958,3.0,6/21/2016,"Prominent for their ""pizookie"", this particular location, resting on ""The City Drive"" amid ""The Outlets"" (formerly ""The Block"") ....within good ole' ""Orange"", CA, bestows yet another arguably meager franchise of this otherwise woebegone - chain restaurant and brewhouse. With their self-proclaimed slogan alleging conveyances to comprise of, ""An innovative, Southern California twist ....."", the verdict is in and my somber conjecture is that NONE of the employees within this particular establishment were presented that memo. I'm electing to cavort right beyond the menu options for this particular review. Let's face facts, we've all been to BJ's at one point or the next. With their ""Buy 1/Get 1 Free"" entree' concession, as well as noteworthy ""H/H"" specials and somewhat impressive weekend brunch options, one would THINK that they'd covered all bases. Having patronized just over a week ago, I'm led to THINK TWICE on all of the above as I question what the value is in one's bestowing any such option(s), when upon visiting and/or being seated, there's NO ONE AVAILABLE TO offer assistance in one's doing so??? * * * Nothing says customer service like the server (or lack thereof) not knowing which table belongs to them and the bear equivalent of this would likely be said server taking his/her lunch mid-meal leaving one to doodle and thumb twiddle all the while attempting to remit payment. - Sure, they offer handcrafted IPA's on tap. - Sure, they offer an admirable variance of cuisine. - ....and sure, they air all of the games by way of their Best Buy ""LG"" mounted flat screens. Trust me yall'...... When your epiglottis becomes parched from an inevitable prolonged wait for a simple beverage refill --AFTER-- you've endured exhausting the duration of your child's secondary education for an unchallenging salad or flight of wings.................... --ONLY-- to commence in doing the very same as you attempt to request your check just to exit stage right in time enough to make ""Orange Is The New Black""................. The restaurant's option of ""take out"" will appear all the more glorious."
Jonny D.,"Tustin, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/20/2017,"My girlfriend and I decided to stop by this BJ's for a little date night. Although we were only drinking, my girlfriend and I felt that Rebekah R, our server, was fantastic. She was friendly, present, not too overbearing, and pleasant. As long as Rebekah is there, you can guarantee that we will be back at this location!"
Irving S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/20/2017,Went here beacause i was craving the chicken chile verde nachos. We sat at the bar and had a couple beers also. Our bartender was Marilyn she was very attentive and very fast when it came to getting us more drinks. Would definately go back. Food and service was great.
Jenny N.,"Westminster, CA",377,8,6,1.0,12/23/2016,"This review is mainly for the service... My girlfriends and I wanted to have a get together before Christmas. The food is delicious, however the service was lacking.   1) We had three waitresses switch to help us. We awkwardly see our first waitress still helping another table even though she said her shift is over. 2) We keep looking for our waitress and keep asking food runners for help 3) the table next to us keeps getting checked up on every 5 minutes and having great service. However, it takes 30 minutes for our waitress to show up with a to-go bowl for our clam chowder and order dessert. At this point, I don't want the dessert anymore Best bet, just order to go. You'll save yourself time."
Maricela A.,"Seal Beach, CA",53,20,5,2.0,8/22/2017,"So normally I like BJs but at this location sucked today. We arrived there around 9ish, and the hostess asked us if we wanted to be seated inside, outside or either, we chose inside.. she also explained to us that there would be a 30 min wait, ok no big deal. It was actually less than 30 so not bad, we were taken to our table-which was OUTSIDE... I guess there was no communication on that part. We asked politely to be seated inside they did accommodate and I appreciated it. Now we've been looking at the menu while we were waiting so we know what we wanted and ordered right away. Our waiter, Brennen was great he was on point about everything, one of those two stars belong to him. Now I ordered my favorite dish Cherry Glazed Chipotle Salmon and my husband ordered the Sirloin Steak. The steak my husband had was amazing!! The second star goes to the steak. My salmon on the other hand was Horrible. When I received my salmon everything appeared to be amazing until I lifted the bottom of it and it was super charred, burnt. I took a bite into it anyway just to see if maybe it didn't taste what it looked, yea I was wrong I had to stop eating it. I wasn't going to say anything and chalk up on the bad dinner but my husband asked Brennen to see if I could get a new salmon. Brennen was kind of enough to have the cook fire up a new one. Yea that one sucked too and came out burnt. I just picked around it, ate what I could and gave up on dinner. I won't be ordering that dish for awhile, at least at this location."
Klarissa M.,"Santa Ana, CA",539,6,,1.0,7/8/2017,I felt like I had to ask for everything from silverware to napkins. It was also A little upsetting on the amount of money we spent for cold wings that some other customer sent back. Hope someone else didn't get OUR left over wings. Those are some pretty pricey leftovers....
Alan M.,"Anaheim, CA",386,2,,5.0,6/23/2017,Got here late at night and my servers Joel and Rudy provided me with excellent service. He recommended all the specials and made me feel like I belonged. I will now be coming to this fine establishment every Thursday for the rest of my life. This will be a new tradition in my family for generations to come.
Jesse P.,"Orange, CA",61,285,330,2.0,8/18/2016,Man what is up with these people how do you give BJ's 2 1/2 stars overall this place is Hoppin it's beautiful the parking is good it's lively not too loud the music is fair and interesting the Decour is wonderful I have these brussels sprouts there was a fantastic seemingly a good value what is going on in this world how could BJ's have 2 1/2 stars it doesn't make any sense Got seated within three minutes at 8:30 staff was polite the waiters were nice I ride all right I take it all back after all of that they bought me my jambalaya and it looked absolutely like nothing like the picture in the menu check my photos and it was warm and it wasn't too bad tastefully wise It was more like 45 shrimp thrown on top of some rice and throwing a bunch of peppers at it is the cook is Mexican and he likes peppers definitely not Cajun definitely not Louisiana more like Guadalajara
jastro S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,63,18,2.0,2/28/2017,"SLooooooooow.  Service. Food of dubious quality  with out the requisite decrease in Price, you are better off going to Carl's Jr. in the same parking lot.  Try TJ I Fridays for a sitdown place or Dave and busters rarely disappoints farther in the complex."
Tyrone K.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,,1.0,9/17/2017,Terrible!  Food was cold.  Service was slow.  Beer was flat.  Managers were non existent.  Usually like this place but last couple visits have been awful.  Oh wait we are leaving and the two managers are talking near the kitchen laughing while all is busy around them.
Cuong N.,"Irvine, CA",7,232,358,3.0,3/13/2017,"I think I had the santa fe chicken salad.  My dish was fine.  The dressing was a bit much.  But the chicken slices were done well.    My Wife had the Salmon Pita Taco's.  She didn't really like her dish that much.  She said the vegetables tasted a bit old and the fish was cold. For desert, we had the pizookie trio.  Monkey bread, white chocolate macadamia nut, and chocolate chip.  The dessert was the highlight of our meal. We had to wait about an hour to get a booth table... this was at about 7pm on a Saturday night.  Service was not bad.  Our server came by and asked us if we needed anything multiple times. I'd give this a 2.5+ star experience.  The wait was long.. so if we had to do it over again, we'd probably do takeout instead (although.. not sure how the pizookie would taste as a takeout order)."
Gracie Ray H.,"Anaheim, CA",1,10,,5.0,3/28/2017,I've been to just about all the Bjs in No OC. But I must the service here was exceptional! We went fir dinner 630pm. Got called in real quick. My husband and I ordered salads and there was a small mistake. BUT David 302 immediately got it changed fast quick and he had a really nice additude. He is a great waiter with a smile. Our dinner was great!! Thanks David!! Totally recommend the Block Bjs!!
Lena P.,"Ontario, CA",21,486,1384,4.0,12/11/2015,"Menu has changed somewhat since I last visited. My favorite veggie flatbread was taken off the menu in the appetizer section. But I was able to make the new tavern style pizzas into a veggie version with no problem.  I got the Garlic Pesto tavern pizza (no chicken) and it was delicious! I loved the artichokes and bell peppers on it and the pesto amount was perfect! It's a huge portion (for me anyway) so I took half home (as usual) but it would be great to share this as an appetizer with a few others or a meal with one other person.  Thursday night is pretty packed and busy, but our waitress/server was always checking in with us and always there when we needed  her. Overall it's a good location and place to eat, just wish they had more healthy veggie options."
John G.,"Sebastopol, CA",9,15,1,2.0,5/2/2017,I had the Brisket with Bacon sandwich. The sandwich and french fries were good. My meal included a side order of Asparagus.  This was a little under done and lacked seasoning. Was served the alcoholic drink: Kamikaze.  It tasted odd.  I brought this to the attention of the server.  She talked with the bartender. The server let me know the bartender admitted they were short one ingredient.  The drink was removed from the bill. They should not have served the drink when they knew it was wrong. Don't like it when someone tries to pull one over on me. Drink service was slow. In the past BJ'S did well. This wasn't one of their better efforts.
Tishie S.,"Newport Coast, Newport Beach, CA",243,25,1,1.0,9/6/2017,Rudest waiter ever.  His name is Anthony.  My mom had to ask for lemon 3 times and she got double than what she asked for.  My mom told the other waiter she got it twice.   How rude for the waiter to say you ask for it twice  you get it twice.  And then the other waiter agreed and said exactly.  What kind of service is this.  So rude.  I do not expect to be treated like this.  Manager make sure you hire experienced waiters!!!!
Ryan S.,"Irvine, CA",2,59,20,3.0,2/6/2017,My party of 4 was seated quickly and our server was friendly.  Only problem was the food took far to long to make it to our table. The restaurant was not very busy so I couldn't make sense of how it took so long to get the food out. Also our drinks sat empty for quite a while before being refilled.
Jazmine H.,"Longwood, Orlando, FL",3,11,6,5.0,8/12/2017,Love BJ and my favorite is the sweet pig pizza. And there beer is great. They need to open more out here in longwood Florida..
Zach L.,"Orem, UT",260,237,166,3.0,5/19/2016,"BJ's is really a hit or miss.  In the past I've loved their pizza; it tasted like a gourmet version of Pizza Hut.  We've also enjoyed their desserts and other menu items.  But this time, at this particular restaurant, we ordered the Sweet Pig and the normal cheese, and what we got was quite different from what we're used to. Sweet Pig: everything looked right, but the crust was soggy, spongy, and oily.  I think the pizza 1). didn't cook long enough, or 2). cooked too slowly, soaking up too much oil.  Texture: like eating a sponge. Taste: canola oil The rest of the pizza was quite salty.  I didn't see much sauce, nor taste the sweetness of the pineapple.  Regular cheese pizza: same as above.  The overriding flavor was salt mixed with canola (or some other vegetable oil).   The good thing is, their management was very helpful, and their servers (we had two, for some reason) were spot on."
Sara S.,"Buena Park, CA",404,301,208,4.0,11/4/2016,Came here for lunch the other day with my office and had a really great experience. We all order off the lunch special menu which was perfect. It was just the right size and their selection was pretty decent. They even offer bottomless fries with their grilled cheeses which was super cool. Our server was really on it and made sure we got whatever we needed in a timely manner. We ordered a sampler pizookie and it was burnt. That was a bummer but our server took it off and the manager gave us free pizookie coupons which made up for it in my book. Overall the best experience I've had at a BJ's to date.
Gwen N.,"Garden Grove, CA",56,8,,5.0,8/18/2017,"Gone to dinner with my two toddler boys during happy hour in the bar area. Our server KIKI was absolutely fantastic!!! She was quick with our order, brought me my beer first (because that's what a mom of 2 boys needs!), super attentive asked every time she passed our table if we needed anything else, and above all it was just her happy and cheery disposition that made dinner absolutely terrific!"
