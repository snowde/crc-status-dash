Fred B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",22,28,1,1.0,1/28/2017,"BJ's pizza is usually pretty decent for their pizzas. However, tonight they hit a new low and I will probably never order from here again. Their pizzas are supposed to be deep dish and what I received for take out is far from it."
Nikita S.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/16/2017,"Karen is absolutely AMAZING!! Truly made our night! Made great recommendations, anticipated everything & was beyond wonderful! Thank you so much!!!"
Jessi V.,"Anaheim, CA",1,5,,5.0,8/15/2017,Today was my son's 12th birthday and we had an amazing time thanks to our awesome  waitress Tara. We went back and forth on how many people were In our party and she was always very accommodating. She made no mistakes with a party of 20 and even gave us separate checks ...that was awesome! Thanks
Amanda L.,"Tustin, CA",134,1,,1.0,8/13/2017,"This is the second time attending this BJ's due to convenience since it is only 5 minutes away from my home. Unfortunately our second time was no different from the issues as before. I try to always be patient, since I've worked in the making people happy business most of my carrier. My purpose of my post is to open up on the lack of quality of food, and customer service that every food business should provide. I don't know if my business will effect in any way, but I think it is safe to say I will no longer be attending this location, I would rather travel 8 miles to our original location in Tustin."
Don S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,23,4,1.0,5/8/2017,"Go somewhere else. At 12:30 pm for lunch, I waited over 10 minutes and no employee acknowledged that I was there. I got a menu from the guy next to me so I was ready to order.  What good is it to be a club member when you can't even get something to eat?"
Andrew B.,"Anaheim, CA",1,3,,1.0,8/22/2017,We were reluctant to go to a BJ's after that whole frog salad debacle. But we decided to give it a try. The server was decent. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my fiancé had the bleu burger. We ate around 6:30 and it is now about midnight that I'm writing this review and my fiancé is puking her brains out right now. We probably won't be going to BJ's anymore.
Dinah R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,32,10,1.0,8/22/2017,"I love BJs but not today. I just left frustrated because we sat at the table for 15 minutes and no one came by at all. Instead of wasting my time, we just went ahead and left. This has been happening the past three times I went to this BJs (last two times I got food but it took over 15-20 just to get our drinks.) I'm not overestimating either. This sucks because I really love the food here. :( Highly disappointed. Going to eat somewhere else now."
Evys V.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,5,1.0,8/27/2017,"Worst Bjs I have ever been to.  Bad service and bad food. Ordered chips and salsa and had to send it back because the chips were stale. They did bring us new chips that were much better. I also noticed the cloth napkins were dirty. The service was also bad. Our waitress never came to check on us. The only time she ever came to our table was to bring the stale chips and salsa, to bring our drinks and then our dessert. She was apparently too busy sitting at another table talking to people as if she was a customer."
Thao G.,"Anaheim, CA",227,26,10,1.0,10/18/2016,"We don't always believe low reviews of bad service as long as the food is good. But this location's low rating is accurate! We've been here before and it was not always like this. We came in with 4 toddlers and 6 adults. They decided to seat us outside, at a firepit marble table that is super high. Their highchairs didn't even reach half way up that table. We were the only ones outside so we asked to be moved or else, those toddlers would be dropping like flies... The server kept harassing us for orders even though we just sat down. They brought all our drinks out three times. My husband was surrounded with 3 Dr. Peppers going flat. But once we ordered, the food came out super sloooow. &They still didn't clean empty plates so with all the drinks glasses, we had no place for food. We had to move them to another table to make room ourselves. The food was mediocre. My gluten free pizza was completely burned on the outside. The deep dish pizza with extra sauce was super dry. But we definitely did not say anything because sitting there waiting for them to remake our food sounds horrifying. We asked for ranch/blue cheese and our pizza had gone all cold by the time they came.  We used the $10 off $35 coupon and the server said a manager needs to come and verify it, ""real soon.""  So ""soon"" that she had to tell us that, TWICE!  Our toddlers at this point were kind of turning into pumpkins. &The manager never came. So thank God, the server just applied the coupon and got us our check. Then we sat for a while again waiting for the card to be returned to us.  Longest dinner ever. I'll come back when ratings go up."
Heather H.,"La Palma, CA",0,6,3,5.0,10/23/2017,It was my boyfriend and mine anniversary last week :) we had decided to go to BJ because I was in desperate need of a pizookie ! Our server was Karen and she was the absolute highlight of our night ! She was sooo attentive to us and made great suggestions in our appetizer and my drink . I must have had 3 of those drinks that's day ! She definitely knew how to engage is a conversation cause she had us cracking up the entire night ! We definitely plan on coming back when Karen is working ! Keep up the good work !
Jessica D.,"Irvine, CA",171,217,150,3.0,4/16/2017,I came here with my cousin after seeing a movie on a Friday night at The Outlet. So to be expected the wait is close to 30 min. So after the long wait we were seated in a booth near the front of the restaurant. Our waiter's name was Ralph. He was just ok to me. I definitely think he could've been more friendly. We ended up just sharing the appetizer combo. This was pretty good but nothing to brag home about. My only complaint was when he brought my refills over for my strawberry lemonade he left all the empty glasses on the table. That's a big pet peeve of mine. I never understood why servers do that. Like who wants a bunch of dirty glasses all over their table when they are eating right?  So my over all experience was just ok. I really think this place needs to step up their customer service. I like their food which is why I come back. So even though it was my first time at this location my experience was nothing special.
Jasmin R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/4/2017,"If I can rate this a negative number I would. Me and my friends waited for 50 minutes to be seated. Then when we did get seated, we waited about 30 more min without EVEN getting offered a drink or water. Ridiculous. To top it off, they attended another group before us and they had arrived way after us."
Kevin S.,"Anaheim, CA",4,8,4,2.0,11/6/2016,"This review is only for the food I ordered.  The service we received on 11/04/16 from Whitney R. was fantastic... 5 stars. Ordedered the House Sirloin with Baked Potato and Cesar Salad, and a Handcrafted Rootbeer. The rootbeer was great. Not too thick and strong. The salad was just as good, actually a bit bigger than I was expecting which was a nice surprise.  For this, I gave an extra star in my rating. The steak and potato... I know BJ's specializes in pizza, but that is no reason to not care about the other menu options.  I ordered the steak Medium, which would typically result in a moist juicy steak.  The steak I received was nothing like that.  It honestly had the appearance of freezer burn.  It was dried out from end to end.  Once cut, which wasn't an easy task, you could actually see a third of it with zero pink, while the remaining was all pink.  Even with the pink, the steak was rough and not pleasing.  I left a little less than half on the plate. The potato was a bit undercooked.  It had its rough spots. I was hoping the included butter would soften it up, but it didn't. The plate this was served on was absolutely too small.  I realize it was a steak and potato, but there was hardly any room to cut my leather, I mean steak.  With each cut, the potato would nearly slide off the plate. Not your best BJ's.  We don't make it often, but now it may even be longer."
Kimberly G.,"Orange, CA",229,61,144,3.0,6/17/2016,"I came here for the 1st time with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his graduation. So the place was packed very loud, people are by the door waiting and standing around until they get a table. We finally got a table, the service was good, one mistake did occur though. I ordered a hamburger and turns out the first waiter didnt write it down..so when we asked the 2nd waiter he told us that and apologized and even came back to ask if i wanted a salad or soup. The food was decent. The lighting of the place frustrated me, it was too dark for me to even read the menu or see the photos. The pricing is very high. I wouldn't really go back just because the place is so loud, the food is decent not the greatest like to pay the high pricing."
Matt N.,"Ontario, CA",1431,192,3094,4.0,6/15/2015,"The visits here have been pleasant. The wait time was a little long but that's too be expected for weekend nights. The staff was always friendly and helpful and were on top of things for the most part. Never been here on a weekday to compare services but will update when I do. I don't expect the best customer service when the staff is getting smashed by a gang of hungry people, but I can tell they're trying.  Our food has been on point every time. I love their deep dish pizza and pizookie!! Can never go wrong with the chocolate chip and vanilla icecream!!  Over all, good place, wait time is long on weekends as expected, and great food!! I will coming back again!!"
Trang B.,"Irvine, CA",366,29,7,3.0,10/29/2016,The service during happy hour was good. They were very attentive and willing to accommodate your order. We came here for appetizers and its not the greatest rate except if you order pizza.  $2 off all appetizers and half off pizza. Not bad. I would come here again.
Liz M.,"Tustin, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/24/2017,Our waiter took forever and we were here for an hour and a half just to eat pizzookies. This place is not quick. We were treated differently than the other tables it was insane. Don't recommend this even tho I love bjs
Lucy C.,"Riverside, CA",13,21,12,2.0,11/6/2016,"Wow I'm all about giving everyone an opportunity but time and time again they have disappointed, BJ'S as a corporate company has great food and that's why I'm giving them a 2 stars, but this place has the worst customer service, whether they need to hire more waiters and waitress or should evaluate the kind of reputation they want to portray.  We didn't see a waiter until 30 min after we were seated. After that we didn't see the same waiter the entire time. Horrible, the BJ's at the Block should really reevaluate how they want to be portrayed."
Kelly K.,"Fullerton, CA",51,42,4,1.0,3/30/2017,"Do you like good service? How about good food? If you, don't come here. Waited 20minutes to order, while the group behind us who arrived after us order and received their food before we could order. Our waiter was excellent at dodging us and not making eye contact. We order a drink and then waited another 15mins for a beer to come 10 feet away from us. We asked for extra salad dressing, never came. So my Un dressed stack of lettuce was some how wilted. So if you have the opportunity, don't come here."
Michael-Anthony T.,"Santa Ana, CA",41,233,13,4.0,11/15/2016,"Service is always good. We always get a server or bartender that is really consistent with the service provided. We never have issue with food not coming out on time, nor do we have issues with water refills. Love the ambience and lighting, sets a good mood in the restaurant. Hopefully next time we come in, service will be just as consistent."
