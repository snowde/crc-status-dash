Mael D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",3,67,40,3.0,10/23/2016,"I visited this location a few times lately.  The first time was amazing, the guy who served us on the patio was fast, efficient, friendly and smiling. He took time for us, we really appreciated it. After that, service was always so-so. We had a woman which I forgot the name, when she brought the check, she gave us the book she took notes into, there were also all her tips of the night inside, I guess. We gave it back to her of course, but she was very confused. Funny but embarassing. Last time, we had a very friendly waitress who had to leave, unfortunately for us. She was very nice. The guy who took over rarely checked on us, we had to use a chronometer to see that there were 12 min gone between the moment our glasses were empty before him to come back checking it, 5 more min before to get the refill."
Tiffany R.,"Orange County, CA",47,34,11,3.0,7/11/2017,"I am not opposed to giving chain restaurants 5 stars. Not this place though. The service at this place is far below subpar. Slow. Slow. Slow. Also, they don't have A1 Steak sauce here? (Wut) however, those Pazookies are redemptive and can eclipse even the most painful of restaurant experiences."
Alisha S.,"Placentia, CA",131,9,5,5.0,7/20/2017,We had the Mediterranean deep dish pizza it was so Delicious.the service was excellent will deffinantly be back
William H.,"Anaheim, CA",5,16,,4.0,7/29/2017,"BJs is always good, they have some people that needs to work in CS but most of them are really good Service and I like BJs."
Amber S.,"Pomona, CA",1,23,26,1.0,10/14/2017,"Ordered online & went in to pick up my food. I didnt know where to go so i stood at the hostess station while 3 workers talked and didnt greet or acknowledge me. After a few mins i finally said ""im here to pick up my to-go order"" she pointed me in the direction where i can pick up my order. I get to the to-go counter i was waiting to be helped,a guy walks up says hi a and answers the phone he proceeded to run down the list of pazooki flavors & takes a phone order while i just stood there. I thought that was so rude. He should have placed her on hold & helped m since i was there first & was waiting. I dont think i'll go here agIn"
Michelle S.,"Corona, CA",58,48,45,3.0,11/26/2016,The service was fantastic today but still slow and our pazookies were burnt.   I love BJ's but this one is my least favorite.  It is always busy and service is consistently very slow.  I much prefer the BJs in Anaheim Hills.  While I was here a waiter was carrying food without a tray.  His skin and dirty clothing were touching the people's food.  He dumped a full ranch down this lady and into her purse.  I was a little horrified watching unfold.
Grace L.,"Brea, CA",482,988,101,3.0,3/7/2016,Happy hour is fun and affordable here. Wide selection of beers on tap and service is friendly and fast.  Plenty of parking although because of the way their building is situated the parking lot is kind of confusing and difficult to navigate. What I didn't like was that we felt VERY rushed. Literally within a second of sitting someone was asking if I wanted to order a drink (I didn't even look at the menu yet) and then about 1 minute later he came back and asked if I was ready... I'm all about good service but sometimes you just feel rushed.
Lupe R.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,6,3,5.0,6/24/2017,"5 stars for my server LEANNDRA. We where seated june.24 a sat. Evening. We waited 10 minutes for our server to maybe greet us nothing I wish I would have gotten her name tall with wavy/curly hair who walked by 5 times and never greeted us. Who I guess had no idea we where her table when it was obviously her side. I bother LEANNDRA to ask who our server was. But first thing she does is ask what we wanted drinks and appatizer.  She's the best! After LEANNDRA brings us our drink the other girl comes to ask us of we wanted appatizer  (yea nooo I don't want any of her service) thank you LEANNDRA even though I bothered you, you took good care of us! I thougj about speaking to the manager but I'm not that person we all have bad days... but just acknowledge.  I'm not a picky or needy person. I just want to eat! Lol thanks again LEANNDRA!!"
Andre G.,"Orange, CA",77,81,60,3.0,8/30/2016,"I was looking at all of the ratings for BJ's here and was thinking, why does it have so few stars? I come here fairly often and always have a good time. However, after my last visit, I saw why. Everything was great, except waiting for the check. As I said before, we visit often, so we know the menu well, and knew what we wanted and ordered right away. No trouble there, we even were offered happy hour prices even though we got there about 15 minutes after happy hour. Nice! The food was cooked perfectly, drinks tasted great, and the overall ambiance was enjoyable. But the waiting for the check part was really a bummer. We asked for our check right when our original waiter was going on break, so we had to wait extra long for the new waitress to process all of the tables and get things going. Now I'm okay with waiting a bit and getting an explanation from the waitress, but as I said, we ordered at around 7:15, finished our food at around 8, and left the restaurant at 8:30. 30 minutes to process and close out a check is way too long for me, I'm sorry. It was almost the length of time we spent eating there! And no apology or even a canned response as to why we waited a long time. My girlfriend had to go up to the waitress when she was at the cash register to give her our cards because we grew tired of waiting.  So overall, I love BJ's Restaurants. I just felt like with it being after happy hour on a Monday night, we shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes to pay for our food."
Joel S.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",1,4,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Me and my girlfriend normally like coming here but we recently had a really bad experience, the host sat us down at or table and we waited over 15 minutes before our server came to our table and that's after we told the host and another server if we could be helped. Nobody even bothered to ask for drinks or asked if we needed time to order we just sat and waited. The food is always great here but our wait time was ridiculous. Will be the last time we come to this BJs."
Brittany P.,"Ontario, CA",4,41,10,1.0,8/14/2016,"Came here once when I was drunk and had really good service and the happy hour was great. Came back tonight and had mediocre service and stale food. Oh and wanting to not sit at the bar top seemed to cause the hostess distress??? We had the flashing light waiting for our server for at least 5 minutes where staff kept walking by but would not acknowledge us. Manager came by and I told him between the service and food I'm not paying for this food and he rudely says ""no you're paying for your drink"" and I said of course, but I'm not paying for overcooked chicken and stale chips.  Slow service, sub-par food, and the manager wasn't nice until I told him that the experience was bad from the moment we walked in the door.  Which sucks because last time we went the server we had was so sweet and great, so we were excited to go in tonight."
Eric H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,37,3,2.0,8/11/2016,"Overlooked twice while being seated.   3 other parties were sat before me who checked in after me.  Wasn't happy at all because I had 2 people only.  The other parties consisted of 3, 3 and 1.   Feeling pissed so, I went to the bar area and the blonde host who was sitting the others before me gave me a ""look"".  Not very good at customer service these days. Expect better service when you pay $30 for lunch and two drinks.  Soon, these will be the $15 an hour wage minimum wage earners.  Will not be back here again.  There food at that location sucks anyways."
Lindsey G.,"Lake Forest, CA",51,2,,2.0,7/21/2017,"I've finally had a dining experience worthy of making a Yelp review for, and that's kinda a bad thing. We had around 10 people gathered for a birthday dinner and we were seated outside. There was a large table for us, but an inadequate amount of chairs available. When I brought it up to a staff member inside that three members of our party were left standing (the table was big enough, just no chairs), this disrespectful individual responded with attitude and mentioned he would have to talk to the manager to see if we could get chairs. He was salty and unprofessional, so we asked someone else and she easily brought us chairs and our server was nice about it as well. I wish I got his name, but he was average height and barely had hair from what I remember. Dinner and the food were good. It was just really upsetting that we weren't treated like paying customers from one member of the team."
Diana L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,56,1,3.0,5/31/2017,"Stopped for lunch with a friend.  I like Bj's generally and this one is pretty good.  Healthy menu choices are appreciated.  He had fish tacos, and I had turmeric roasted cauliflower with a starter salad of beets and greens.  Cauliflower was good albeit somewhat ""mushy"" compared to other Bj's locations."
Skip H.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/17/2017,Slow getting food. Finally asked waiter to check on it and surprise it was ready.   Seems like it was sitting for a bit as it was tepid at best
Joe M.,"Villa Park, CA",16,325,5,3.0,4/3/2016,"I enjoy BJ's. The Brussels sprouts are very good. I had the lunch unlimited soup and salad. The tomato and mozzarella salad is great. The Caesar is just fair. The tortilla soup is excellent.  Ate here again on Sunday afternoon. I always enjoy the food and beer selections. I rate a 3 to 4. Not sure why it has below 3 average rating. Service is consistently good.  The mobile app allows reservations, ordering and rewards. My favorite I'd mobile pay. When you are ready to leave just pay and go. Don't have to wait for server."
Angela S.,"Allen, TX",16,7,,2.0,5/7/2017,This food was great but the service was TERRIBLE. The waitress forgot our appetizer and it ended up coming out with our food. FOOD SERVICE NO NO. Then she came by TWICE and asked us if she had asked us about dessert. We waited way too long for our drinks and our food.
Jennifer D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Worst service ever. We actually had to leave before they brought out our pizzookie because it took them so long and we had already paid. They brought our pizza before the appetizer, and the app looked like it had been under the warming lights for a long time. She didn't bring out plates. No refills for the water until the end of dinner. No pen to sign the check. The worst!"
Masoomi S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",27,2,,2.0,10/6/2017,"My first time! Thought the appetizer (spinach stuff mushroom) was a too small a portion. Overall decent food and service, though I had to continually remind the server to bring me my cup of water and cutlery all in all it was pretty average."
Jevonah K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",108,89,150,5.0,1/24/2017,"Experienced excellent service tonight in the bar. Peter V served the two of us and he was quick, efficient and provided us with great service. Our pizza came cooked well and not overdone and our monkey bread pizookies was not overcooked either like some previous BJ's have brought it. Tuesdays offer 1/2 priced wine by glass or BOTTLE which is such an awesome deal if you drink wine. Next time you are at the block, consider BJ's for a great meal or snack."
