Ianey B.,"Lake Forest, CA",120,5,,5.0,6/26/2017,Our server Hailey was the best part of our visit here. She was so kind and helpful and definitely made me feel like Bj's was the perfect choice for our night. She made great suggestions that lead us to a perfect meal choice and I couldn't be happier with our service. Someone please give this girl a promotion!!
Gabrielle R.,"Corona, CA",17,4,1,5.0,5/12/2017,"Went here last night and had such an excellent experience. Not only was the food amazing and brought out to us promptly, but our server, Patrick, was attentive, helpful, knowledgable about the menu, and really made the experience wonderful. Definitely will be back!"
Shalawn R.,"Harbor City, CA",72,4,,1.0,10/1/2017,"Jared S. Needs some help, not very attentive, I will not come back if he is serving. Took 5 min to get water, the supervisor was amazing, but they need to get rid of him. I thought he was new, bit come to find out he has been with the company 6 years.....who trained this guy?"
Blanca G.,"Garden Grove, CA",92,16,3,3.0,5/30/2017,"I've been here like three times & honestly I really don't have any complaints about this restaurant. The food is good, staff is kind, & the wait for the food isn't that bad. The only thing I don't recommend is to come late at night because the wait is pretty long."
Elsa G.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,36,,5.0,3/24/2017,This place doesn't have a 1hour wait for no reason... not only is the food amazing you get the best service here...  The manager takes his job very seriously because he really walks around making sure EVERYONE IS HAPPY.  Our Surver happen to go on break and even the backup servers go above and beyond.  Love going to BJs and like they say good things are worth the wait!
McMasters B.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,76,221,2.0,1/15/2016,"I wish this bjs provided service like the one Tustin Market Place.  Not only does it lack in service but also never gets orders correct .  So if your coming here for service wrong place .  The waiters aren't friendly . But I must say, if you seat at the bar and Josh the bartender is there.  I promise he'll give u exceptional service, no matter how busy they're. He's always smiling and on top of things. I always tell him that they need to train their waiters to be more like him. I would recommend to make sure the waiter repeats your order ."
Tessa W.,"Alhambra, CA",120,92,18,1.0,8/17/2016,"Read all the bad reviews and that's literally what this place is.  We came here for a work lunch and chat without checking the reviews.  The waitresses were nice, when you actually got their attention that is. Glad we had plenty to talk about because service took its time, including needing water refills.  Food was mediocre. Flat bread nachos-not great; plain, burnt, and I got a stomach ache after. Glad I didn't order the salmon like the other two, one complained about asparagus being old, waitress was nice but only half attentive ? When she brought the substitute of broccoli she didn't wait for a response she put it on the table and walked away even as he said ""wait miss"" and she didn't turn around. Other coworker also got a stomach ache.  Like others said, they looked over us a lot, mind you a table of 6, and we could've EASILY walked out and not paid."
Yasmin D.,"Torrance, CA",17,110,471,3.0,2/1/2016,"1.23.16 review - The call ahead cut the waiting time to 3 minutes which we were really pleased. Nothing fancy about the food...service was good, wasn't busy yet. Pizookie is always the bomb!"
Gabriel F.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/25/2017,"This was an eye rolling experience... when we first arrived my friends and I we greeted and sat promptly. Our server Michelle, was very friendly and attentive she recommended drinks and food for happy hour and was very welcoming... however, the good experience stopped there. Unfortunately due to change over Michelle left and we had two servers who were tending to us, it took longer then it should have to get our food and our drinks went dry. We requested our check, it took 15-20 minutes to receive it. And then it wasn't picked up in a timely manner. It was upsetting to see such a good dining experience go sour so quickly. Kudos to Michelle. She was outstanding. Her peers could learn from her."
Tamara T.,"Santa Ana, CA",413,910,2114,1.0,6/15/2016,"Three words: Shut-it-down Two Words: Millennial employees One Word:Lackluster  Hashtag: #BJSRestaurantShutItDown, #TheBlockAtOrange Website: WWW.BJSRestaurant/ShutItDown E-Mail:  Twitter at: @ShutItDownBJSRestaurantAtTheBlock Instagram: BJSShutItDown Snapchat: BJSIsNowClosed News:  DO NOT EAT HERE! Worst service of the year award goes to BJ's at the Block of Orange (or whatever it's called now)! Unless you're a party of 12, expect long waits that get longer with each interaction with the waitress! My sister suggested we meet up here to discuss her birthday plans and have dinner and also because it was free pizookie Tuesday. I hadn't visited a BJ's in a long while so I was looking forward to trying a pizza again. After we ate here I remembered why I stopped going to BJ's all together; it lost its luster and is pretty much equivalent to dining at Dave and Buster's in the opposite corner of the mall.     We started with avocado egg rolls and they looked fresh out of the frozen foods section and disheveled. I asked our waitress if it came with dipping sauce and she replied, ""Oh yeah it does. The must be out of ramekins back there. Sorry about that."" My sister said, ""We'll take it in a bowl or on a plate or if they want to bring the sauce out here and drizzle it on the egg rolls, that's fine too."" Off our waitress went into the abyss, never to be seen again. We waited for a while then started eating the egg rolls without the sauce but it was inedible without it. Too tangy and not appetizing at all. Finally, alas she returned with a ramekin halfway filled with some brown stuff that was the sauce.      We ordered a medium sweet pig pizza and a wedge salad. We waited and waited....waited, FINALLY! The  waitress brought the pizza over, placed it on the designated pizza holder and asked if we needed anything else. We said we were good and she looked away and walked off. In the past, I remembered the pizza was piping hot and the waitress would always use the pizza spatula and place a slice of pizza on a plate and give everyone at the table their first slice. Not anymore. So the pizza isn't much of a deep dish anymore. The dough/crust used to taste fried with a nice crispy cheese layer around it. Now it's a baked crust but the pizza itself is pretty flat. Looks like it came out of the freezer and into the oven. The wedge salad wasn't appetizing either.    Fifteen minutes go by and we put our order in for a 1/2 chocolate chip, 1/2 salted caramel pizookie. Fifteen minutes later our pizzokie comes out but it's not even good! Everything here lost its luster. The check took eons to get to us and then she disappeared even longer! Where did she go? It wasn't too busy? I must have had that look of ""Kill me now"" written on my face because another waitress or manager noticed it and came over to take care of the check. She came back and said, ""Ok,  your waitress is taking care of that bill..."" and then my sister lost it and yelled, ""PLEASE TELL HER TO HURRY! I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE FOREVER AND I'M SERIOUSLY GOING TO LOSE IT!"" Then she magically appeared and thanked us but we were irritated and ready to go by that time. No tip was left for the ridiculous service and awful food and the final bill was $52 for avocado egg rolls, wedge salad, medium sweet pig pizza, 2 waters and a free pizookie.  BJ's used to be the happening spot with the good food and beer but I can't trust it after going to the Block location."
Anonymous A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,77,1,1.0,2/8/2017,"I'm generally a BJs fan, food, beers and service were great. ESPN --- great. Not great was fox news on the split screen spewing fake news and Trump book commercials."
Chauncey M.,"Long Beach, CA",196,7,,1.0,6/25/2016,"pretty much made up my mind, I'm never going to BJ's to see a game ever again! After Seeing email promo ad and calling this one to make sure THAT GAME was showing (w/sound) , I went this location to see the USMNT-Copa America game. They ended up just having the NBA final game of course, though they put on the US game on the side television - the main TV as well as the sound were just for the NBA finals. Now of course, I GET IT-I GET IT;The finals will always get priority.....BUT, If you guys hadn't advertised it, and if they had specifically told me over the phone otherwise, I would not of had a problem with it-I WOULD NOT HAVE CAME!!! The manager I talk to seem pretty indifferent about it; and just simply maintained there was nothing he could do - after I explained the whole entire scenario to him. He simply said once the sound of the NBA game was on, he was basically powerless to change it. From what me and my friends could see, nobody there was really paying any kind of attention to the games. There were also a handful of other people there with USA soccer jerseys on, so in my opinion making the change of channels would've been completely harmless. So honestly, I found his explanation completely bogus. And naturally, we checked out and left elsewhere. Although he didn't charge us for the wings we ordered, we still paid for the couple beers we had. As I mentioned before, it was just the complete inconvenience and the total lack of regard from him-when I brought it up, as server had even reassured us WHEN WE arrived they would simply put on sound and the game on Main TVs, before we started ordering. Anywho,  that's pretty much all I have to say, about it.....DONe"
Beth G.,"La Habra, CA",133,27,5,1.0,6/12/2016,"Horrible everything. We get seated, our server tells us he will be right with us, I think we waited almost 5 mins for him to come back, we order our drinks and appetizers and took him another 5 mins to bring us the drinks. We sat there for a good 15 mins until took our food order, ok we are patient people but it really wasn't that busy. I timed it another 20 mins for our meals to come out. Our friend ordered a medium steak, it came out raw. So our server sits and explains for about 2 mins how he hate when that happens ( dude go get it cooked more he is hungry) he was a nice enough guy but super slow, so they refire the steak, that thing came back WELL DONE.  I think your kitchen manager and chefs need some help on knowing the difference between the 2.  Really bad experience"
Devon R.,"Hamilton, Canada",10,56,1,4.0,5/23/2017,Was there around 4 and very busy already. Ducks game on and Angels game that evening probably added to crowd. Sat in bar area which was packed. One server on but he handled everything really well. Support staff was friendly and quick. Good food that came out quickly. Was happy with visit
Denise W.,"Santa Clara, CA",29,17,,2.0,7/31/2016,"I have been to three different BJ restaurants in California over the course of seven years or more. My daughter and I came to the BJ's in Orange on our first trip to Orange, 7 hour drive from the Santa Clara area.  We ordered two different salads and a flat pizza for dinner. Before the food came we ask that the table be wiped down because there was quite a bit of stickiness to the table. The waitress said that she would have someone come clean it yet we watched her walk by us 3 times and still no one came to clean it.  We asked another waitress to get someone to clean it. The and Busboy said he would relay the incident to his Busboys and apologize for the fact that the table was not cleaned. The two salads that we had were very very tasty and helped to make our dining experience improve. Would we return? Hmmm...not sure..."
Jessica G.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/21/2017,"This location has terrible service, they really need to work on it, and the food doesn't come out good at all. Just don't go here, every time I have come to this location turns out to be the worst idea, I would say go somewhere else, that's what I will be doing."
Nick P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,14,4,1.0,7/19/2017,"Can you give negative stars?  This place has earned them.  Ordered food at 7, still not ready at 8:05 and the employee was a complete dickhead when I asked what was going on."
Nancy H.,"Westminster, CA",135,221,11,3.0,6/28/2016,"the servers and waiters are kind and friendly, so you should tip them good. the food here here is good, but the steak i got was a bit small. it wasn't really worth the price in my expectations.  however, customer service was good. would i come back here again? sure.  been here more than twice already, but it's a good place to come dine here."
Jennifer M.,"Garden Grove, CA",152,12,9,5.0,1/25/2016,"Just got home from an amazing lunch at BJ's! Upon Alisha's initial greet, we knew we were going to enjoy ourselves. She's easy going, knows her stuff, and is fun to talk to. The food and drinks she suggested were spot on as well. First, I decided on the Harvest Hef, which offered subtle notes of banana and clove, tasty! We started with the lettuce wraps and loved the wasabi mustard sauce. We then split two lunch specials -- the spaghetti and meatballs and the salmon with roasted veggies and quinoa. Both were outstanding, the portions were generous, and we especially loved the spice level of the meatballs. It was then time for an after lunch cocktail. Feeling conflicted.. Alisha was again to my rescue! Being in one of those fickle ""sweet"" but ""not so sweet"" moods, she suggested The Pink Cadillac, which was a match in martini heaven for me. Being in the industry myself, it's usually pretty difficult to leave me impressed as I'm always thinking of what I would have done better. However, Alisha's service was so seamless and phenomenal that it has left me feeling like I need to step up my game. We had a great experience, and will definitely be returning soon! Cheers!"
Amanda M.,"Anaheim, CA",49,19,1,5.0,4/14/2017,"Anthony reached out to me and truly made up for the bad experience, I will definitely be back again. Thank you BJ's and Anthony."
