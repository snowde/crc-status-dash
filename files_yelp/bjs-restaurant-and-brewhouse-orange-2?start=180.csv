Jenny B.,"Anaheim, CA",28,39,6,1.0,7/28/2017,"Speaking purely for their delivery service, I'd give this place -1 stars if possible. After ordering on their app which routes through DoorDash, I called to check the status of an order that was to be delivered at 7:45. When I called at 8:30, I spoke with Jennifer who almost immediately placed me on hold for 4 minutes. Then her manager on duty picked up so I explained I was calling to check the status of an order and he put me right back on hold for another 3 minutes. After that, Jennifer picked up again and said sorry but you have to call GrubHub. I asked her if she was sure it wasn't DoorDash... Yup, you guessed it - she put me on hold again for another 4 minutes to ask someone who I should contact. I understand completely that it's not BJ's fault whether or not a dasher comes to pick up an order, but I am very disappointed in the way they chose to handle the situation. Huge lack of customer service from both the associate and manager on duty. I wasn't looking for a refund or a comped dessert - I just didn't want to wait almost 15 minutes for someone to finally tell me that it wasn't their problem. Luckily this place is good for dine-in orders. Just don't use the app because you might as well just be using the DoorDash app instead."
Belinda M.,"Glendale, CA",141,35,135,5.0,2/9/2016,"We ate here two consecutive nights and both nights the services were AWESOME!!!  The first night our server was Joey and he was very attentive and a very pleasant waiter. The second night our waitress was Sammy and she was so happy to help us with our rewards card even though my husband told her about it after paying. She even offered us if we want our drinks to go.  Im not sure if it was a coincident but at BJ's in Glendale, waitress Tonya served us and she was great as well. She took time explaining the menus to us and gave us suggestions on whats good. I like how they added menus that are healthier choice so I wont feel guilty eating a small size pizookie (did I spell that right?) w"
Julian C.,"Orange, CA",19,29,27,4.0,12/31/2015,Happy Hour menu is worth trying. They have an abundant selection of craft beers including seasonals. Appetizers are half off and there's variety of starters to choose from.  Cons: toppings on the mini pizza slid right off. Seems like the dough is cooked beforehand and then heated with the toppings on it. Didn't get the impression that the toppings are mixed into or with the dough. That's unfortunate. The mini pizza is $4 off during happy hour so I guess you get what you pay for?
Kelly B.,"Pasadena, CA",49,11,4,2.0,5/4/2017,"Two stars only because Joel (cocktail server) was a good server. We got a appetizer platter, everything was lukewarm. Manger came out to apologize and offer chips or fries to snack on while we wait as compensation . 2 of the 4 avocado egg-rolls were sour and had a awful taste, they were inedible( this was our replacement platter). This is the closest BJ's to Disney Land, we came here a couple times after for late dinner. It's not our first time here, but the last. The food is mediocre. We will stick to our BJ's in Arcadia."
Robert B.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,48,76,5.0,9/19/2016,"This is the best BJ's I have ever visited. It is too bad that I have to COME all the way down here from the BAY area. Connors is playing baseball for Santa Ana, so I am down about 2 times a month. The staff is very friendly and never have an attitude. Just a great place to unwind after the long drive, have dinner with your son and enjoy conversation . thank you everybody there. Robert"
Cuahotemoc L.,"Orange, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/28/2017,"First time I've tried the root beer wings, They were awesome! That's what earned the extra star. The service was horrible. The server looked as if she was purposely ignoring us. Asked for a box three time and waited 20 minutes for it. We waited the whole time with empty plates on our table, keep in mind that our server walked by like ten times! The only person who asked if we were okay was the manager who noticed we needed attention and stopped by after she cleaned the tables and picked up plates from the table around us since the employees were not paying attention. We stayed an hour an half at the restaurant, most of the time just waiting to be helped.  Not satisfied, and kind of offended."
Eddie P.,"Riverside, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/11/2017,"Came into this BJs around 12:30 with a party of 3. No wait. The food was brought to our table quickly with no errors. The waitress was very kind and energetic. The only reason I don't give this establishment 5 stars is due to the somewhat rude hostess in the front. When told there was 3 in my party, she told me to wait in the side with a rude tone. Aside from that, all was great."
R S.,"Anaheim, CA",5,3,2,1.0,10/6/2016,My friend brought me here for my birthday I had the noodles chicken my chicken was not cooked all the way through it it was pink then to top it off the waitress took so long then it was my birthday and they took longer time to bring my dessert my cake but it's like really no good
Nhu N.,"Westminster, CA",413,232,195,1.0,9/6/2015,"This place service sucked. Food is good. Walked in, all the girls were huddled at the counter with the GIRL manager, discussing what they did on their day off. Um do I care ? no. You should have seized the chit chat as soon as I approached, and greeted me. Instead, they finish their convo, and then turned around with ""oh how many"" GREATTT! Then we sat outside with the most monotone nonsmiling server there was to mankind. Everything took so long to come out... and all we did was order sandwiches. Wow, must have milk the cow to get the cheese for my sandwich. Their lunch special is pretty decent, would come back for that. But not for you people! I also posted some picture of this poor under kept establishment. Feel free to browse."
Bridget S.,"Aldergrove, United Kingdom",0,7,3,1.0,4/2/2017,"What a waste of money. Hard to say what was worst, the meager amount of pizza toppings  thrown into the middle of my undercooked deep-dish (Why be stingy with onion and cilantro, when the upcharge the actual cost is insignificant.) or the waitress that loudly (as a result of the deafenig noise in the environment) referred to my husband and I as ""you guys"" within each sentence - all she needed was gum."
Chris C.,"El Cajon, CA",0,5,,4.0,9/1/2017,"Happy hour is great. $4 BJ beers, $1 off guest drafts, and some well stocked food items."
L Z.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,257,52,1.0,6/18/2016,We decided to give this BJ's another try. Food took forever and our food came room temperature. We really need a Yard House in this area...
Lana N.,"Garden Grove, CA",1757,312,3307,2.0,9/4/2014,"I've heard really bad stories about the food & service at this particular location. So bad that many of my friends vow to never come back to this location, ever again. From my experience:I came here on a Saturday evening with my boyfriend. We got seated right away because we found a spot open at the bar area. Our server Brianna was one of the best servers I can ask for. She was very efficient and was so good at asking us what we needed that she was almost like a mind reader! She checked on us often and provided us with everything else that  we needed. The food; however, was mediocre compared to other BJ's restaurant. I personally thought everything was slightly under cooked. The mac & cheese & pizza could have been in the oven a little bit longer.  Other than that, the facility looked nice, presentable, and clean. Parking was also plentiful & it's located at a very good location."
Sophia V.,"Yorba Linda, CA",222,171,179,3.0,10/23/2015,"They have great Happy Hour deals on beers, wines, and appetizers! I normally come here just for their pizookie. Darn it sweet tooth. But after a long day, drinks are usually purchased. Boyfriend loves their deep dish pizza here, I'm so and so because I'm not a pizza fan. I however, usually just get their chicken lettuce wraps here. Perfect to snack on! Our service was very prompt and friendly. She always came around to check up on us and get us refills on beers. If you ever get pizookie, get their Orea Pizookie, it's boooombbb. I've had their clam chowder at other locations but if you ever go to BJ's, I highly recommend that! Other than that they have a variety of selection on beers (it is a brewery) so go on and order yourself a beer after a long day of work."
Ale P.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/19/2017,"I used to come here for happy hour quite often  Last couple times service has been terrible, and the mini pizzas were not fully cooked. Also, waitress threw away my already boxed food while I went to the restroom, and when I asked about it ""oh, it is in the trash, I thought you left, nothing I can do."" She didn't offer anything, just walked away. Not getting near this one again."
Amanda M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",241,163,191,5.0,1/5/2017,"I hadn't been to a BJ's Restaurant in a long time before this last BJ's visit. So, while I had some idea of what to expect, I was still very impressed with the food and the service here - Above and beyond what I might have expected from a well-known restaurant chain. We had a large and loud party of 10. I was expecting to wait 45 minutes on this busy Thursday night at 7pm, but my party was called within 15 minutes. Since not everyone had arrived yet, I told them to go ahead and put me back down for another 15 minute wait. This, I was sure would result in us losing out table and waiting a very long time. Instead, 15 minutes later when my party arrived, we were seated right away. When more people than expected arrived, they were more than happy to bring over another table and two extra chairs. The waiter was patient enough and very friendly with my boisterous family members - of which both genders were flirting with him and paying him sincere compliments. We all left feeling full and well-taken care of. I would recommend this restaurant and hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised with the high level of service and good tasting food when you visit too!"
Jordan M.,"San Marcos, CA",275,4,,1.0,12/16/2016,"The customer service was so bad i had to write this review. my sister graduated college, we went to celebrate. the hostess said it would be 45 minutes, we waited. she gave us a thing that let us know the wait would be 45. when an hour went by, we walked up to talk to them and the hostess informed us she never said that. when presented w the evidence, she said she sent the wrong one but never said anything wrong. manager came out to ""handle"" it. nothing happened. wasted an hour. extremely unprofessional."
Geena S.,"Whittier, CA",0,4,3,1.0,2/19/2017,Just left this place is so unorganised we went in a party of 10  after waiting 55minutes they try to sit us in a booth we asked to sit outside just so we can be together but they gave us the run around so we asked to speak to the manager and we could see he Disney even look at us obviously Trying to avoid talking to us so we approached him I felt like he didn't know what to say we walked out of the place. We will never go back and and we are 5 different families. Boooo to the manager service sucked I even felt bad for the server.
Jenna N.,"Norwalk, CA",49,14,21,1.0,1/21/2017,"came in a big group of about 20 ppl. we waited four hours for our table. service was alright, nothing special at all. we told one of our 4 waiters that we had a birthday and that they'd bring a birthday pizookie for her but they NEVER DID. it was pretty disappointing. don't bother coming if you're in a big group"
Michael K.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,19,,2.0,12/6/2016,"I don't eat at BJ's too often and the last time I did it was ok, but this time was not good. We received our drinks after a long wait. The food took a while as well during lunch time. My food came out cold while other's food was hot. Very inconsistent, slow service, slow with drinks, etc."
