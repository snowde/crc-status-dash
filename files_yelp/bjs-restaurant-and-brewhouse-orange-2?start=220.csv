Sunshine G.,"Garden Grove, CA",68,5,1,5.0,1/18/2017,5 stars for manager Melissa. Our take out order was missing a few items and she went up and eying to make things right!!! Thank you Melissa!!! You saved lunch for us.
Jesse L.,"Orange, CA",142,7,13,5.0,5/21/2015,"I stopped in today at BJs to have lunch with my wife and i had the pleasure of being served by a mr JESSE KIM which was totally amazing as well as welcoming the moment he said hello. Shout out to the beer they have on deck. I will surely be back again in the near future.  ""Stay thirsty my friends"""
Conall S.,"North Wales, PA",0,1,,2.0,7/27/2017,"Never been here before because we're from out of state, but even if I lived here I don't think I would return. On the way we called and asked if there was a wait and they said no but when we arrived 5 minutes after there was a 15 minute wait. Food took a while. I got the pulled pork sandwich which barely contained meat and my sister got the margarita flatbread which she described as edible and just that. Overall not a great experience."
Moo Bin L.,"Orange, CA",943,110,200,3.0,4/18/2015,"Got the honey glazed bacon burger. Was incredible but my friend and I both asked for medium rare and it came out well done. On top of that, I asked for condiments twice but they never actually came and the server who I asked never came back around for the two hours I was there. Checks took about 30 minutes to be processed.  Definitely unsure when I'll be going back."
Cori T.,"Cypress, CA",0,17,2,2.0,4/12/2016,"I am so sad that this location is the worst I've been to. I usually love BJ's, but the service was HORRIBLE. We had a larger party, but half was kids...they were going to make us wait 45 minutes for a table for lunch. One person from my group went to the bathroom and saw a booth that was more than enough room for all of us. Because we knew that we would fit in it, we requested to be seated, and luckily we were seated immediately. Then, we waited about 10 minutes to even be greeted and have our drinks taken when we saw four waiters just standing around. Luckily when a waiter did come to our table, he was awesome. I wish I got his name.  Aside from the service, the food was fine."
Connon O.,"San Diego, CA",43,86,45,3.0,3/5/2016,"You're only getting three stars because the manager made things rights.  First off ordered a side salad.. Never came out.. Pizza comes out.. The thing was harder than rhino skin. The crust was literally unchewable. Side salad finally came out 15 minutes after the pizza.  When the waiter Joseph asked how everything was, I showed him the deep ""notional"" cuts on the top of my mouth from the metal they served us with pizza toppings on it.  He promptly told the manager about our less than average experience. Manager then came over, I crumbled the ""fossil"" pizza before his eyes. He said that was absolutely unacceptable. He ended up comping everything except for my sons meal which ""almost"" came out right.  Free pazookie was also thrown in. But of course the line cooks in the kitchen managed to burn that to high hell also.  I don't plan on returning to this location unless they redo the roster in the kitchen, or ceramic factory since that's the texture they seem to like the most here."
Mae F.,"Santa Ana, CA",144,37,12,1.0,4/2/2016,"Never have I been so offended.... Big mistake trying to eat here tonight. My family and I went there and waited about 15 minutes for a table (which was fine). Then they sat us (3 people) and then we waited another 15 minutes before any type of service began.  My husband left the table and approached the hostess letting her know that no one has helped us yet and she said she'd take care of it. As he was walking up, one of the servers finally said that they'd be right with us. She walked by again a minute later saying the same thing, and then started helping the table next to us which just got seated and was still in the process of sitting down...  What was the point of even sitting us?  Very rude!!! We decided to leave which probably went unnoticed as well."
Crystal G.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,9,7,2.0,6/18/2016,I'm usually happy everytime I eat here. Today my lemonade was a bad sour taste. My pasta was ok but it felt a bit undercooked. The veggies weren't as fresh. At least the service was good. The girls sat us quickly and made sure our food was ready. That I can give them. Even my pozoki was ready but unfortunately it felt like the cookie over cooked so it wasn't easy to spoon into.  I hope there food gets better.
Stephanie S.,"Garden Grove, CA",16,35,29,1.0,2/24/2016,"0 stars for takeout service, especially for Chelsea C. I went online to do takeout and ordered the lunch specials for the Fettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti. I got to the restaurant, and it was not busy (dine-in and takeout), yet it took ten minutes to pay and retrieve my order. Chelsea was incredibly slow in getting my order and didn't even offer me utensils like the other customer before me.  There was another customer who came in five minutes after me and was helped first. Two managers/shift leads came by and still didn't offer help.  I scratched the hell off the space where you can tip the server because that was just the saddest service I have ever seen.  Fortunately, the pastas were one of the best. The broccoli in the fettuccine was still undercooked, but still edible.  Overall. Service was complete bs for such a slow day."
Audrey R.,"Orange, CA",22,5,,5.0,1/22/2017,"To Barbara G for fantastic customer service and being completely awsome!  She made sure my salad was made correctly, it was nice that my special order was right.  It is nice to get great service and have such a friendly personality to help us.  Thank you!"
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",395,752,957,1.0,3/7/2015,"Friend and I came here for dessert during Monday Night Football this past fall.  We each ordered one pazookie and the attitude that we received from our waitress was unflattering. Whether a table spends $15 or $100 shouldn't justify different service styles; we are all paying customers. She acted as if we weren't worth her time and she wanted to push us out quickly so another tabletop could spend and tip more. Nonetheless, before we even got our Pazookies, she slapped us with our bill not even few minutes after passed since we ordered. In all the restaurants I have been to in my lifetime (including multiple BJ's), I have never gotten this type of service from a server. She didn't even refill our waters at all.  I wanted to enjoy my dessert at this BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, but every bite I consumed left a sour note in my mouth. I didn't enjoy my experience at this Block of Orange location."
Renee W.,"Buena Park, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/19/2017,"Happy hour here is excellent!! We're here on a busy Thursday night and our server was so attentive and even got our second round in right at the cutoff of happy hour! It's basic American food and the menu is too long, but everything was excellent."
Onkar S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",26,11,28,1.0,7/22/2016,Horrible experience ever in bj's .i can order chicken bbq wings it's half-cooked and the other orders was wrong they give me wrong things.
Caitlin D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/28/2016,This whole company is awful. The people are awful and the way things are ran is terrible. Just called to ask for a phone number the manager gave it very rudely and then hung up.  Thanks for nothing.
Lea D.,"Westminster, CA",3,46,5,1.0,11/22/2016,The service is really terrible... this has to be a management issue my friend ask 3 people a total of 5 times (3 to our waitress) for hot sauce we had to actually get up out of our chair to ask... I mean getting a refill was impossible and most from our group never got one... ketchup with fries? We must be crazy... then trying to explain how we were splitting the bill was the cherry in top of a terrible experience this has been my third time to this BJs and my god they can't get it together.  I had time to write the review waiting for the waitress to come back with change.... I'm gonna be here for a while I hope I'm home in time for Christmas...
Andrea P.,"Santa Ana, CA",19,7,1,1.0,10/4/2016,"Note to self: I will never come back on ""free pizookie day"" & I will avoid server Patrick at all cost My friend and I walk in, and we were greeted by a few friendly ladies at the front desk. They let us the know the wait time is about 40 minutes. That's not an issue, we figure it's 8:30, let's just kill some time and go to do some shopping. We come back to find that our name has already been called but that's not a problem because we are quickly seated anyways. We are seated and greeted by a guy by the name of Patrick. It was very easy to connect with him, sociable guy and made us have a couple good laughs in between ordering our food. Well things started going south quickly. The wait time to order food and get our food was a little long. When we finally got our food, there wasn't any ketchup or Parmesan cheese. So here we are trying to flag down anyone to get us these things and refills. Patrick is no where to be seen so a guy by the name of James attends to our needs. Throughout the entire dinner we're constantly having to flag down people (anyone other than Patrick) We were very understanding, we get it, it's busy. It took 40+ minutes to order a pizookie. I finally had enough and talked to management to see if we could get an extra pizookie given the time frame and how inattentive our server was. Michelle was very great!!! & agreed without hesitation, bringing out 2 pizookies fairly shortly after. Patrick walks by and makes a remark about me talking to management. Then as we're in the middle of finishing up our dessert, Patrick brings out yet another pizookie!! He mutters something and shoves it on the table. We're left stunned because we didn't ask for a third pizookie and we don't even know what he said. We ended up giving it away to the party right next to us. Jokes on Patrick if he tried anything funny! We pay our tab, and let James know we appreciate him taking the time to attend us when we really weren't his intended party to serve. Right as we're leaving, James happens to be at the door and we again say thank you & goodnight. Well Patrick walks by and screams (literally) ""have a good night!!!!!!!!"" Everyone's face was stunned and of course we're left dumbfounded. I end up calling the restaurant and explained to management what happened. Michelle again took care of me and promised to take care of the issue. She even offered to send me a gift card via email. Michelle and James, you rock! I get it, it's a crazy day but the treatment tonight was something I cannot understand. Patrick is a passive aggressive server that I hope I NEVER run into again."
Jory K.,"Mililani, HI",0,10,2,3.0,6/8/2015,Went in with my family for dinner . Got seated right away but our waiter took awhile to get to our table .we ordered our drinks and appetizers . Then our waiter doesn't come back to take our dinner order had to ask another waiter to find him . We order our dinner and got our drinks and appetizers  and dinner in reasonable time. But during that whole time our waiter didn't check on us. Had to ask  another wait staff to refill our drinks which she did and still our waiter was not to be seen. Finally our waiter shows up to give us our bill which was a little over 100$ paid it with no tip . Went looking for our drink server and gave the tip to her.    But the food was excellent we got the ribeye steak and full rack of ribs which was perfect. Will go back cause of the food..
Antonio L.,"Anaheim, CA",553,552,825,3.0,4/2/2016,"Came here after a class. I just needed to refill the tummy and grab a cold brew. So my friend and I charged for a booth in the bar area instead of waiting, and cut off a couple getting there. Faster you move, the more likely you'll get what you want, right? So the server came by very quickly asking if we were ready. Um, slow down buddy, we just sat down. Then it took a bit till he came back. And when my friend finished ordering, I had to stop him quickly cause I had a question. Slow down buddy, what happened to customer service? The bar wasn't even crazy busy. Our drinks came over, got myself a snakebite (if I remember the name correctly, lol), and again it was a quick drop and go and not a check-in. My pizza arrived, and again very quick to serve and not check-in with us. I ordered the Gourmet Five Meat pizza. Love their pizza here. Love the light, airy crust and the quality of the pizza ingredients. The next time we see our server, he drops off the check and takes off! Hold on homie, I wanted dessert and a box for my pizza! Had to wait again till he came by so I can get the box and order my pizookie. Got a regular chocolate chip pizookie and I love how it always comes out nice a warm with that creamy scoop of ice cream. It's always a great way to end a meal. After reading a review on here, she got the same service experience, being very rushed. Service is everything and can make or break our overall experience. So minus 2 stars for being rushed with the lack of service. The 3 stars is strictly for the food. Hopefully they provide a little more training on service before I come back again."
Jasmine W.,"Westminster, CA",0,15,3,3.0,3/26/2016,"I ordered online for curbside pickup at 9:15pm. I got there at 9:15 as planned but kept calling to let them know I was there but no one answered. Then I saw the small print on the sign that curbside ends at 9pm so I went in. Food was ready. Cashier was nice enough. Offered me utensils which is good since I'm eating out of my hotel room.  I got to my hotel room, changed into my pajamas, put the perfect show on tv and sprawled my feast onto the bed for me to devour. I was obviously alone. I had ordered steak, asparagus and wedge salad. The salad dressing cup was covered in dressing before I even opened it. No biggie.  Steak time! I ordered it medium. It was burnt, hard as a rock and dry on the inside. The meat was white like an old pork chop. I love char but I wanted it to be at least somewhat juicy! Now I'm trying to cut it with my plastic knife and fork and it was really hard. Like so difficult that I ended up just sticking a fork in it and eating it like a savage. Steak on a stick. I like beef jerky so that worked.  Pretty bummed. I didn't want to take it back because my bra was already off.  My experiences here so far had been excellent. I prefer BJs when I'm craving steak because it's usually done right and priced good and they have asparagus (but bring back the green beans!). Maybe I need to order rare from now on. I'll still go back because I'm sure it was a fluke. And I rarely order pickup so if it happens again I can bring it up to the server."
Jared W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",126,1,,5.0,12/20/2016,Came here for dinner and usually am not too pleased with some of the service but was very happy with the service I received from our waiter Patrick. He was excellent and gave us our food in a timely manner as well as continued to check in with us and just overall gave a great atmosphere! Very happy with our waiter and hope he gets the recognition he deserves.
