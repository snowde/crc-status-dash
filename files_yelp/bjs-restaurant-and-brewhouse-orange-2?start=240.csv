Sakina K.,"Santa Ana, CA",1207,218,804,3.0,7/10/2015,I like this bjs location. I've never had a bad experience and get seated almost immediately every time. The bar are on a week night is empty so I normally opt for that way. Same service just louder.
Bob M.,"Orange, CA",43,52,16,1.0,9/14/2016,"Horrible!! The service was non-Existent. When we saw our server when he finally showed up, he said sorry? Took our drink order, finally after 15 minutes the drinks showed up, but not by our waiter? Fyi, my dates soda was flat. So where is our server? 15 more minutes go by, he shows up and we ask where did you go. Oh, Sorry. Now there for 45 minutes. Took our order and mumbled something about getting the manager to speed up our order??  So, the food shows up, Salad fine, Pizza was meatless, and we did not go Vegan either. It was a Pepperoni and Sausage with Mushrooms?? The toppings were some tomatoes and very little meat. Needless to say we're never coming back!!"
Josceline V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",13,4,3,4.0,5/13/2017,"I came here with my Dad and brother on a Saturday around 6. We waited like 30-45 minutes, but I'm not the type to really be bothered by waiting- I get it.  Once we were seated we were asked for drinks and they were brought pretty quickly, along with the appetizers we ordered. They took down our order for our meal and I didn't even really realize we were waiting almost 45 minutes for our food until the server switched with a newer server and said our food would be out right away and sorry for the wait. I wasn't too upset, we were pretty understanding. Another 20 minutes passed and I was really hungry so I asked for a refill on our chips and they said it was extra. Replied that was fine. Once he brought our refill the manager (of something) personally came and brought us our food and apologized for the wait. He gave us 2 free pazookies and didn't charge us for the chips haha. 1 star less only because I've never waited more than 1 hour for food , but thankfully we got 2 free desserts."
Shaeleen S.,"Lake Forest, CA",70,70,730,4.0,5/9/2015,"Was here with my 2 high school friends to celebrate a little get together and my late birthday. We got here about 12:30 PM. It wasn't that packed. We were seated right away. Since it is mother's day weekend, we didn't get a big lunch. Our waiter was very helpful and always check on us. I think because he didn't have a lot of tables to take care of when we were there. Wish I would remembered his name. We ordered something to share: the Best Beginnings® Appetizer Combo that a generous assortment of four of BJ's most popular appetizers: Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls. I ordered the lunch special that has a half sandwich, soup or salad, and fries. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and chicken tortilla. Also, one of my friends and I order a mimosa. I love the soup. the sandwich was ok. Overall the service and food was good. :)  oh, after we finished, our waiter gave us a free Pizookie which crave my sweet tooth. :)"
Kaylee L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/3/2017,Michelle H is hands down the best server here. She's on top of everything. She's so sweet and kind. I would totally come back and sit in her section again! Thank you Michelle H for the wonderful experience :)
Kelvin R.,"Anaheim, CA",43,24,20,3.0,4/20/2015,What a horrible experience.  The people behind me were drinking and dropping the f bomb every so often . At one point I called the waitress over and complained about the language . She said that she told the manager about it and told me that she could move me and that they were about to leave. Or you could say something yourself.   5 minutes later they continued to talk like a mid shipman and I had enough and turned to them and basically told them to  watch your langauge.  The waitress came back over and I wanted to speak with a manager now  because I'm pissed that BJ s did not do anything and forced me to confront the drunks. The manager finally showed up and I asked him why I had to say something and they wouldn't ask them to leave The restaurant totally blew it . I will dine there again and hopefully can enjoy my meal without drunks talking like sailors on liberty.
Terry L.,"Santa Ana, CA",160,9,,1.0,11/2/2016,"Zero stars, absolute zero!!!!!! Very disgusted. Ordered takeout. My boyfriend was eating a bacon cheeseburger when he bit into something hard. He spit it out and it was white and plastic with some sort of filling or liquid inside of it. We immediately stopped eating and trashed our food. I knew it was a bad choice to order takeout the moment we got their to pick up our food and they where bringing it over and laying out on the cash register with the fries exposed and food exposed while packaging it right  in front of us. Very unprofessional and gross."
Jenna H.,"Santa Ana, CA",15,21,9,5.0,10/21/2016,"Super great and helpful service! Something was wrong with my dish and they insisted on taking it back for a new one. Manager came out, apologized and offered a free desert! The waitress was on top of all the orders, drinks and overall satisfaction! Highly recommended this BJs."
Eileen P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,12,3,1.0,3/13/2017,"We use to come here all the time but the last two times had to have been the worst!! We went to dinner last nite here around 8:20 checked it waited about 20 mins..our waiter was ok and non of this was his fault we made sure to tell him..we ordered chips and guac which we got before our drnks whick took about 20 mins all the chips were basically all the bottom broken chips, so I asked if we could have new full chips..we ordered our food. About 15 mins he brought out chips that looked even older than the ones we previously got..so we canccelled our order and left. This has happened twice plus the food wasnt the best the last time we came, we will NEVER come back to this bjs again. Mainly seemed like the cooks were just either understaffed and too busy or just being lazy."
Jane A.,"Orange, CA",28,139,182,3.0,3/30/2015,"Stick to the pizza  We dropped by for some late night eats. We sampled the avocado egg rolls, house salad, chicken tortilla soup and a mini 6"" triple pepperoni pizza. Of these items only the pizza stood out. It was truly delicious. This is the only thing that saved their 3rd star.  The service was a bit iffy. The waiter did not accurately list the salad ingredients. I don't like surprises in my food -boo!"
Kevin N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/23/2017,"went there this evening to get some beers and some food... sat at the bar for 15 minutes, not even once did the bartender ask me what I wanted when I was clearly vying for his attention.  Absolutely amazing that a business like this even survives.  I just drove back and ended up going to the Yardhouse near my place where I was served in a few minutes!  This BJs just does not know how to conduct business."
Melissa W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",369,155,125,5.0,2/10/2015,We love BJs! It's my oldest a favorite place. And all the kids like it - which is a big deal for our family!! It's probably the pozookie that keeps us coming back for the kids.  Deep dish pizza is good Ahi poke is two of kids fav   We start with mots sticks and today the basil bisque - it was amazing!! Hubby likes Cesar with chicken.
Johnny R.,"Anaheim, CA",2,9,9,1.0,2/13/2016,The worst customer service. The front desk ladies are the worst BIH's that act as if they dont even want to work there..  The worst no wonder it has such a low rating. No wonder only the rich and idiots go here instead of the one in BREA. WAY BETTER THERE
Katie L.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/11/2016,Love Bj's pretty fast service most of the time. If I order on the app I can pick up my food in 15 minutes usually. Nice atmosphere also!
Angela C.,"Anaheim, CA",364,15,7,1.0,10/16/2016,"This one star is for the ceaser salads we ate. Those were bomb.  We come to BJs all the time. Usually we go to the one in Cerritos but we were closer to orange so we came here. Anyways, we were sat within 5 mins of giving them our name even though they said 10-15. Cool.  We were sat in a booth,as we asked for, and waited 12 mins before we were greeted by anyone. Server finally came by and greeted us without apologizing for the wait. We ordered drinks and decided to wait until those came till we ordered our food.  Drinks came out in reasonable time for how busy the restaurant was. We ordered our food and the wait was adequate. Everything tasted OK. After the food was dropped off we saw our server once (right after it was dropped off) before we finished our meals. Our drinks were empty, our waters were empty and our server was no where to be found. Finally was able to order dessert and another drink... water was still not refilled. He actually took away my empty glass and didn't bring me another one that was full. I had to eat my pizookie with nothing to drink   Pretty much service was crap. We know that we aren't going to be back to Orange anytime soon."
Karla P.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,12,,4.0,11/19/2016,I like this place. I usually go have dinner/happy hours with friends here. Been here multiple times. Very busy casual place.
Brittany D.,"La Verne, CA",13,6,,1.0,2/16/2016,"Came in today not happy at all with the service, it was terrible went to take out and no one was there, a guy walked out notice  me and walk back into the kitchen. Whoever  was in charge of take outs went on break and no one knew who took over for her,..I don't understand  how no one can know who is supposed  to  cover for you... So decided  to order at the bar and go from there. There was an older  women sitting next to me who seemed to be waiting for sometime for some wings, and the bartender was extremely  rude to her, the women asked if she could check on her food, then the bartender  replied you said you would be ok with waiting, when she received  her food she asked for some hot sauce  and the bartender  took about 10 minutes  to get it, seemed like she forgot...."
Betty S.,"Anaheim, CA",14,14,5,1.0,2/9/2016,I remember why I haven't ate here in years.  Appetizer: avocado eggrolls - they are okay nothing special  Main dish: chicken Alfredo- came out cold asked for it to be heated which I assume was then microwaved. Chicken was gross like something you find in your hot pocket ! Nothing fresh about this meal except the bread  Dessert: chocolate chip pazooki- I could of sworn it tasted better years ago  Review of food only not service. Waitress was great
Vincent N.,"Orange, CA",112,275,354,5.0,12/18/2013,"HAPPY HOUR M-F from 3-7 and Sun - thur 10-12pm. Glad there's another one nearby, would always go to the one in HB and it would be packed! Alot more seating here at the bar area. It was kinda busy here and had to wait about 30 minutes for our food, but it was worth it. Beers and appetizers from $4-$6 and small pizzas for $6. Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, avocado spring rolls, sliders with potato wedges and cookies and cream pazookie.  They were all delicious! I would recommend getting regular fries instead of the seasoned potato wedges, got a little bland and overwhelming. The cookies and cream pazookie melts in your mouth, tried the red velvet and white chocolate last time, cookies and cream definitely takes the cake! I also tried the Jeremiah red beer, it was pretty good, can't wait to try another craft beer!"
Mario P.,"Westminster, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/14/2016,"We are a huge fan of BJ's and somewhat of a regular customer at the Irvine location in the Market Place. We've visited this location in Orange three times and this is by far the slowest, worst, most disrespectful service we have ever received. I guess we returned hoping that the service had gotten better and we were wrong. Our order took an hour to come out, the order was incorrect, and our server forgot to enter one of the entrees. I feel bad for the manager, who we've had multiple interactions with because she had to come apologize each time and comp items off our bill. BJ's Orange, get rid of your silly tablets and hire better service. There's obviously something not working!"
