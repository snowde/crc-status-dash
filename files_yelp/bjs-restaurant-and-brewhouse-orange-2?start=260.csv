Erick H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/5/2017,"Service was terrible at this location, I am a member of the BJ's Premier Rewards Program and I've been to many other ones, I am definitely not coming back to this one."
Lisa H.,"Westminster, CA",57,43,250,1.0,3/16/2017,"We come to the Orange location & HB often but have yet to experience such horrible service. As usual, we place our name on the preferred list before come in. As we got there, we got seated a few minute later, which is normal. We like oh yeah, we got here before 7pm it still happy hours but we couldn't order anything off the happy hours menu (drink -appetizer - etc) because our server was no where to be seen! It took them 10 min for another server to come to our table to let us know that our server was back up & will be over shortly & ask to take our drink order. Which is very nice of him to help our server out. It is understandable since I have work in the food industry so I know sometime it get busy. But really, you could come by & say, I will be over shortly. So, after 15 min of being seated, our server finally came over (my gosh, we are only a party of 2). She came over & took our alcohol drink & food order. We both order the daily special (& last night was the burger special for $10 each). Our alcohol drink came (they had craft beer special for the night at $4 - but was upset with the whole experience that we got charge $6.25 for it instead - I know it not much but when it is advertised at $4 for craft beer) After she took our order, I forgot to tell her that I want my burger to be well done. Took us another 6 min to flag her down. Finally, we told her that my burger need to be well done. She say she will go tell the cooks right away. I was so relief that we finally got to flag her down. Finally, our food came out. As usual, whenever I order my burger, I always cut it in half - to check to make sure there no pink. & what the odd??? Pink!!! So, it took us another few minute to flag our server down as usual. She told us that she told the cook -well done. (or so we hope she did) Manager came over & even say oh my it not even close to mediumSo the manager apologize. On top of that, my boyfriend didn't want to eat his food because by time my food come back he be done. So he waited of course his burger is getting cold here. To top all of this, we did not have any utensil or so, no fork or napkins... So here we go again, flagging our server down & guess what? You got it, our server was no where to be found. So my fries came out in the meantime... Yes!!! My food came - the manager drop off my burger & she left. 2nd time around & it was cook perfect. I got to say, the first burger was more presentable than the 2nd burger (the 2nd burger, my hickory brisket was all on the cookie sheet instead of on my burger - no fork - mean I couldn't pick up my brisket ) Finally after another 5 minute we flag her down for some fork and napkins. My gosh did we had an adventure tonight. How could a server be that inexperience or horrible. I mean you mine as well advertised that you serve raw burger then? It was beyond medium. Wow! Top off my burger, my boyfriend burger he could only ate ¾ of his burger. ¼ of his burger was raw - uncook! Wow! Best part, we were both done. Finally!!! But - guess what??? Our server was no where to be found!!! What the odd again??? I tried to pay using the apps with my credit card since we was so furious for all the long wait. But after trying to pay using the app twice it was declined. It not like my card is bad - it just wouldn't allow me to pay. So after many unsuccessful trying to flag our server down - we hate to do this - but we end up asking another server to flag her down for us - We ask another server to send her over to our table. So after about 10 minute of waiting for our check - our server finally came over & ask what we needed - my gosh? Really? Our napkin is on top of our food - can you not see that we are done and want our check so we could be on our way? I wanna cried! We was so frustrated that we did not even bother asking her to fix the craft beer from $6.25 to $4 as advertised. So we just paid cash and tip her $2. She is lucky she got some tip. But honestly, of all the time we went... Not once did our server came by & ask if we wanted to order another drink or get our water refill. Not once did she came back & ask if our food was good or when my 2nd burger came out if it was better. Not once she came over to ask if we wanted refills on our fries. Not once did she just come by without us flagging her down for question/ help!!! Never have we experience such horrible service, long delay, terrible food, took forever to get our check (someone please update the apps version so we could pay via apps). Got off work early - been waiting all week to come in on a Wednesday to enjoy the $10 burger deal with unlimited fries & $4 craft beer. Was in such happy mood - & our night ended up so horrible & disappointed!!!"
Amanda E.,"Irvine, CA",861,185,704,3.0,1/23/2016,"This BJ location needs to improve there customer service. Every time I come here, the servers just can't seem to get it right with just a refill on drinks, getting orders correct, or simply just giving the check. Waiting on food takes forever, and the by the time we get it, it's either not cooked well or it's already cold. The servers don't acknowledge us which makes me question there customer service skills. At least the managers have courtesy, and take care of us at the end of our visit. While take out is probably the best way to go! I order on the BJ app, and within 10-15 minutes the food is already prepared nice and hot; no wait! So the food is delicious if you order take out ;)"
Christina M.,"Westminster, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/11/2017,"Favorite BJs location especially the server, Anthony Ocampo, great customer service and very welcoming. I'll definitely be back."
Edgar O.,"Riverside, CA",117,94,154,5.0,1/3/2016,"I really Like this place, The pizza And The avocado rolls are my number once choice of course I tried other dishes but nothing like this too. Service is getting better they have a couple new staff members and so far when they help me out did a wonderful job. Thanks I'll definitely keep coming back here"
Diana V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",3,14,4,1.0,10/1/2016,"Sadly I had forgotten about the terrible service here (last time I came was 2 yrsago). Came on a Friday night to have dinner with some girlfriends...the slowest service ever, they had ran out of silverware ? Wth..we hardly saw our server..when it was time to pay I had a pizza added to go. The server forgot the order and we waited an extra 40mins until the manager rushingly came to drop it off and apologized and left. I honestly was expecting an apology & how they can make things right to ensure we would come back like any other decent restaurant...NOTHING! Do not come here! There is a LONG wait to get served POOR customer service! Really killed the night for us!"
Sonal P.,"Orange County, CA",180,563,12,1.0,12/16/2014,"I came here for a family dinner on a Saturday night. The place was pretty packed given the holiday shopping season. We waited about 30 minutes before being seated. Our waiter came to our table promptly after being seated.  We ordered appetizers and about 15 minutes later we ordered our dinner. While I completely understand it's a busy time, the restaurant definitely felt a bit short handed.  The table didn't seem clean. Our silverware and napkins didn't come until 10 minutes after our appetizers were put on the table. Our silverware was actually dirty- which is pretty gross to me! EWW!! And of course right when we are about to begin eating the appetizers, our dinner arrives.  Before we could even finish our dinner, we were asked about dessert. We weren't exactly sure what to say since we were still in the middle of dinner. As our dinner plates were being cleared the check arrived. We actually wanted to get dessert but considering how rushed the entire experience felt - it was worth leaving and going somewhere else for dessert and drinks.  I definitely did not like this BJs location compared to others in the area, Save your time and money and head to another location!! I shouldn't have to feel rushed while I eat a dinner I'm paying for!"
Lili H.,"Orange, CA",649,409,2177,3.0,9/5/2013,"More like 3.5 stars, but 3 since we can't give half stars.  New place so this review is far from definitive,  BJ's Restaurant's crew still adjusting.  Disclaimer: this place wasn't my choice (no comments)    BJ's Restaurant is safe and convenient, pretty standard food and service, just as many other chains. But in this particular one, IMO, they are over killing it with the friendliness and the fake enthusiasm of their crew.  Seriously people, tune it down!  What did we have?  Beer: Hefeweizen pretty good.  Pizza and dumplings: OK   and a great Pazooki Yes boys and girls I'm a sugar-holic and I'm not ashamed of it!  Service was good, overly-fake-friendly and kinda long wait for drinks, but otherwise good.   I don't think I'll come here often since it's a chain and I'm more into unique mom and pop places, but still is an alternative to drink and eat. They have good Happy Hour and pre-game deals.  Also a great place to satisfy my gigantic sweet tooth with a decadent pazooki."
Jeff R.,"Garden Grove, CA",117,155,101,5.0,2/4/2015,David M. is phenomenal! He made our date night perfect! He was very quick on the service and even took time to  talk to us and tell us about his army career. David is the exact reason we will be coming back here time and time again. He was simply an awesome server and really fun person to talk to.  David = Awesomeness!
Jack M.,"Upland, CA",16,8,7,5.0,10/14/2016,Our party was amazing. Barbara was super great and treated us like part of the family. Thank you Barbara! Drinks were awesome.
Michelle K.,"Anaheim, CA",57,101,305,4.0,1/7/2016,"I came here with my friend one day and I got the bread bowl soup with clam chowder in it and it was soo good. (Probably one of the best bread bowls I've had) My friend had gotten the full rack ribs and I'm surprised it came with two sides and one of the sides she got was a soup, which was huge. During dessert time, I am disappointed. Well I'm happy I finally got to try the pumpkin Pizookie, which was delicious. But when I ordered it I guess the guy thought I wanted a mini one. So I just ended up eating the mini one even though I originally wanted the regular size. Why would you assume someone wanted the mini one unless they said otherwise?"
Jay B.,"Cerritos, CA",43,129,31,5.0,12/22/2015,Came in here just to get a couple of beers. Bar service was quick and personable. Restaurant was clean and David was awesome!  Definitely coming back! Visited 12/16/15 23:52
Tasileta R.,"Santa Ana, CA",18,37,12,5.0,1/24/2015,"We had an awesome waiter- Christopher. He had such great customer service, very social, great sense of humor and was very patient when my mom, sisters, husband and I were ordering. I felt like we jumped at him all at once, (not our intentions, but we were just so hungry) when we ordered just our drinks, desserts (yes, we eat our desserts before our meals) and appetizers. Only because we were talking all at once, BUT he got it all down. Anything we needed and asked for- he was there with it. Checked on us a few times after the food was served to make sure we were okay if anything else was needed.  After a few bites that my sister took into her jalapeno burger she noticed her meat was red after ordering well done (curr. pregnant), so we obviously wanted to make sure Christopher was aware of it. Again, we only wanted to make sure he was aware of it. Not wanting another burger made or ask for anything else, we just simply notified him and he came back letting us know that he didn't charge us for the Jalapeno burger. Without even asking to do that!  So thank you Christopher for everything!"
Eve C.,"Yorba Linda, CA",148,34,27,1.0,12/14/2015,"**update** I went back to see if the service was any different on mothers day weekend. The server was simply OK. One thing we didn't like was when we ordered mozzarella  sticks and we asked for more marinara sauce, Well the server instead of taking away the empty marinara dish we had finished she placed the new marinara sauce on top of the dirty dish. Very unprofessional. So i will not change my star rating for this location. I think their service is mediocre."
Brandon J.,"Irvine, CA",0,64,,3.0,5/28/2017,"Disappointing burgers, but a cool place to hang out if you just want a few beers."
Teddy P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/18/2016,I reserved a table through the mobile app. We got there and waited less than 5 minutes. The food and service was great. Our waitress Allyson was very polite and attentive. She was perfect. We all had a great experience. Thank You!
Michael T.,"Dublin, CA",48,31,37,1.0,12/20/2015,"Absolutely the worse BJ I have ever been to. Waitress: Did what she could (or else 0 star) Food Quality: Ribs - no bbq sauce, no wet naps. Taste is average. Baked Potato - only came with sour cream. Nothing else was offered. North Beach Mahi Mahi & Shrimp - simply awful. Water down ketchup sauce with boiled shrimp and slab of Mahi thrown into a bowl.  Kids menu spaghetti - plain spaghetti and Ragu sauce. Too watery. Mojito - water down, almost little to no alcohol. Don't ever go there! Crazy and sad!"
Rebecca R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/14/2017,We had a grad party here in a semi private room. It was awesome!  Our guests had a great time. Barbara and her team did a great job making sure our guests had their glasses filled and also made sure the buffet table had plenty of fresh hot food. Melissa was very helpful in planning the event and making sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend BJs at The Block in orange.  It was a great place for a big party. Thanks!
Page N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",53,54,1,2.0,7/9/2016,Not sure I would return to this BJ's. Very dry bison burger. The slaw was tasteless. Waitress was good though.
Brian W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,43,47,2.0,1/6/2016,"The customer service was poor, the drinks never got refilled, the food was below average. The bazookie was good as expected though. Or whatever the pizza cookie ice cream thing is called.  Went with a party of 6 even the sodas were under-carbonated and tasted weird and the server gave us different drinks 'no charge'.  Short review, bad service, mediocre food, high prices."
