Frank Y.,"Anaheim, CA",92,58,45,1.0,10/19/2015,"I've been to several BJ's Restaurants, this was shockingly the worst experience, hands down.  Chicken Fettucine was horribly dry. My wonderful GF's steak was warm/cold, the baked potatoe was not fully cooked through. - I got a tad sick for 2 days after eating this food. Pizooki arrived COLD, cookie had hardened and the ice cream did not melt on the pizookie.... Was given a set of dirty spoons, replaced them and got ANOTHER dirty spoon with still warm chocolate on the bottom lip that I smeared easily with my thumb.  Service was horrible. It doesnt take 15 minutes to get a clean spoon, and it shouldn't be hard to find a CLEAN one. Who gives 3 dirty spoons?  I'm done talking about how bad the food was. This BJ's is an embarrassment to the Company. * I believe our food was left out cold for long-enough for this to happen..  If you come here, just come for drinks - you don't want to risk getting sick, getting cold food, a cold pizookie thats hard to eat, or dirty spoons for 20 minutes."
Jacob B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/11/2017,"5 Stars, outstanding food and service! I always go to this BJs location to enjoy a delicious meal with friends and family. The server Anthony Ocampo is very informative and knowledgeable of the menu. I have tried a variety of foods at BJs and have never had a bad experience."
Martha G.,"Orange, CA",4,8,14,5.0,9/29/2016,"Came with the office, in celebration of all September Birthdays. The food was delicious, service was quite fast not to mention we went in pure rush lunch hours. Out waitress was amazing! On top of our every need and such a charming attitude! Unfortunately I don't recall her name, but I'm aware she was new, is from Jalisco, and apparently also speaks Spanish...lol! Awesome attitude with awesome service!"
Mark W.,"Templeton, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/7/2017,"Went here yesterday while on trip to see an Angel's game. The waitress we had was very friendly and talked to us about our trip. She was also very good at making sure we had what we needed and that we were enjoying our time at the restaurant. I had the Jeremiah Red and it was a very tasty beer, and when cherry Pepsi wasn't on the menu she went out of her way to get us a non alcoholic mixed drink that would taste similar. The food was also great and the prices were very reasonable. The spinach and artichoke dip as well as the crispy portobello strips were delicious. We were also celebrating a birthday and the salted caramel birthday cookie with ice cream on top was mind blowing. The environment of the restaurant was very enjoyable and laid back. It wasn't too loud but also not dull. Having never been to a BJ's before, I can say we definitely want to try them again."
Victoria V.,"Fontana, CA",6,67,10,4.0,9/25/2016,"Good pizza, deep dish pizza selection. Super tasty! I also got a side salad which was kind of small, but I guess that was good because that meant more room for pizza. I also had some red wine and that was pretty good. The environment was fun. Good date environment."
Kristin C.,"Fullerton, CA",169,4,1,5.0,10/14/2016,"I came to BJs tonight for a huge birthday party. More than 30 people. I definitely expected a shit fest when it came to the ordering and paying. Thankfully, we had Barbara as our server. She is hands-down the most badass server I've ever had. She's organized, methodical and super friendly. Thank you!"
Larry L.,"Tustin, CA",136,123,751,4.0,10/17/2014,"Bjs is good, a lot of televisions, food is pretty decent, tuesdays is half price on the glass or bottle of wines, beers are good specially the brunette...their flat bread pizza is pretty good. Some locations are better than others( so their standars are not great) Happy hour gin and tonic is with tanquerai..."
James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1106,935,1830,1.0,9/18/2014,"After swearing off BJ's after my dining experience at the Huntington Beach location (on Beach and Edinger), I hesitantly found myself at a different BJ's restaurant to meet up some friends. Unfortunately, this one was the same story. Strike #1: a hostess told us it was happy hour and instructed us to sit in the bar area. When we asked the waiter whether it was happy hour, that notion was struck down immediately... hm ok. This was really minor compared to Strike 2 and 3. Strike #2: the food was underwhelming. The fish (for the fish and chips dinner) was very oily- there was nothing light about the batter as described. At points, it was just easier to peel away the batter and eat the fish inside. I wish this dish came with coleslaw or something pickled because after a couple of bites, it would be difficult for anyone to take in all that oil/grease. My friend got their spicy spaghetti which I took a few bites of- holy moly, there wasn't anything remotely spicy to it. In fact, you could call it a bland spaghetti. Fortunately, generous portions of parm and red chili flakes somewhat saved the dish, but by then, it felt like we prepared the meal with how much we had to add to the dish. Sorry for all of you Chef Boyardee fans out there, but I'd rather have a can of that at home than order this again. Strike #3: service was painstakingly slow (around 9pm on a Wednesday). It was difficult to flag our waiter, it seemed like he was trying to avoid our table or something. When we asked another server to get us ketchup, she straight up dogged us and made it very apparent we were inconveniencing her... and here we were asking someone else in the hopes that our request would come out a bit quicker. Alas, when we were trying to retreat from the restaurant, it took a total of 30 minutes (yes, by this point we felt so inclined to time it) from the time the check came out to our table until we were able to get our bill paid.  So really, I have been so let down by you BJ's. When you were at your prime, I really enjoyed it but lately, it just has been a huge disappointment. The last time I wrote a review and was contacted by someone willing to make it right, I actually responded but never heard back- their customer service in general is just beyond me. I have zero intentions on bringing my business back here and hope you steer clear too."
Lasty K.,"Santa Ana, CA",174,175,30,5.0,10/5/2015,"*Note - I sat at the bar, service may be different here than actually sitting down. Will also include my experience with take out. + Bar service was great + Food tasted great + Their beer selection is nice I came here on a weekend to just chill and hangout, mainly get some beer. I had the Thunderstorm IPA? I forgot which, but it was recommended by the bartender and it didn't disappoint. Prices were about as avg as any other spots around the area. I believe $5~ for a cup of beer? I forgot. Either way, food didn't take long, and bartender was attentive. I also had ordered take-out during their free pazookie promo. It went well, I ordered online and mentioned that I'd be picking up in 30 minutes. I arrived, and sure enough, my food was ready just on time. No hiccups or issues, just an easy in and out transaction.  Overall, I'd come here again and again. This place hasn't done me wrong, yet. :)"
Steve B.,"Torrance, CA",18,255,26,2.0,1/25/2016,"As everyone said; they are busy even at 9-11pm at night and that seems to affect the service and wait times immensely. Maybe it trickles down to the employees being stressed with the workload which causes the long wait times and drinks not being refilled as I noticed 1 waiter covered a decent size area. Even saw smashed food under the table entire fries; again assuming a hiring issue causes this; forcing less staff to do more work; something has to give. Our server was nice enough but definitely running constantly with orders. That being said, the food was OK, had the hickory brisket and bacon burger; which was decent and the plate seemed to lack more fries..who doesn't expect more fries? The pene pasta didn't seem overwhelming in size either; for portion pricing of 12-16 for plates, you might expect more. But again the place was full; so either not many places open at that time of night that have a bar to congregate and eat food as well or people have accepted what it is. Bathroom heat is crazy hot like a sauna for some reason. Management; get on this; hire some more wait staff and bus folk."
Nic V.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,38,14,1.0,8/6/2016,"When you do your hiring for the host/ess staff, make sure you find yourselves people-friendly employees that know how to say hello and smile. We encountered a total _______ last night at your front counter and she didn't have the decency to say hello, look up at all fit a single second, or smile. And when she took us to our table, not a single word as we got in the booth. She STARED at the tv screens as I stared at her. Â Your food is mediocre at best... I worked at a diff bjs 8 yrs ago and it seems things have gone downhill. Also, have u tried your basil watermelon margarita? It's one of the most vile drinks on earth... Had to send it back and get a vodka soda. Ur like cheesecake factory... Food that looks good, but doesn't taste good. But seriously, nothing was as bad as that awful hostess in the front. That's how awful she was."
Jackie L.,"Anaheim, CA",231,203,226,1.0,10/4/2015,"Been here twice and both visits the food was mediocre. I would say the only thing good here is the selection of beers & the fried artichokes. The pizza I ordered was soggy, and lacking toppings/sauce. It was really bland for a Alfredo style pizza. The ahi poke dip was fishy tasting and not fresh. After a few bites I was over it.. I doubt I'll be coming back here. Service here also needs to be worked on, they don't constantly check up on you and our table didn't even have utensils until we had to mention it to our waiter."
B M.,"Malibu, CA",38,51,174,5.0,1/31/2016,"I can not understand the low rating on this BJ's. I have always had a great time at BJ's...actually any BJ's I have eaten in. My cousins came down from New York and I felt so sad upon hearing that they had no idea what I meant, when suggesting BJ's as a place to grub down on. So we went! Nothing quite beats out my Graduate status pizza, The Great White, when I come here. I like to split it with friends and nibble away at its little comforts of home cheesy goodness. We had, a lot of of food. From cheeseburgers, to fries, with steak, differing salad mixtures, and desserts to tie someone's stomach off in days. Our waitress did a great job, and even on a super busy Sunday night. My cousins loved this place. I will surely be back. Thank you for always giving my stomach and family a most appetizingly delicious satisfaction, every visit!"
Skyler O.,"Atlanta, GA",42,50,63,1.0,5/14/2016,"Called ahead at 5:22pm on Friday night. They said that they don't take reservations and that there was no wait as of that moment, but they would place our name on a list and we will have a shorter wait time than others. Arrived 5:45 pm went to the front and was told 45 mins. So we waited. They starting to seating walk-ins and other guests, still waited, 35 mins later they call us. Finally seated, it takes 10 mins for the server to arrive and ask us for our drinks. Mind you it's barely still happy hour so we ordered drinks and apps. Server says it's only at the bar not at tables, but he will make sure we get the discount...okay fine. 15 mins pass finally drinks and apps.  They messed up on my girls pinacolada and I ordered a dark side of the moon, but they gave me a dark castle (which is not made correctly either), and I ordered three apps but only two came.  All in all I love bjs but this location has some of the worst wait times and it's seems like the bartenders need to be trained better. We have come here multiple times with the same results. Thus the review."
Jay M.,"Santa Ana, CA",9,38,28,5.0,2/7/2016,"We arrived on a Thursday evening for dinner! It was about a minute wait and we were instantly seated. It seemed like a full house too! So we appreciated the awesome teamwork from the hosts!  There are TVs everywhere! Perfect for you sports enthusiasts! And for the aesthetics loving crowd, the bar is pretty, too! You got them usual drinks glowin' and they're all neatly organized against the wall! Photo frames also litter the walls, but not too overwhelming that it causes an eyesore (like other restaurants cough cough). The floors looked clean and everyone around seemed to be having a good time chatting away with their groups!  The server arrived soon after we got seated. I believe her name was Miranda. She was sweet and young, but that didn't tamper with her professional customer service skills!!  Our food arrived in a timely manner. My friend ordered the sriracha mac and cheese - it was good, not spicy in our opinion but still tasty! Recommended if you're a mac n cheese and Sriracha fan! The other had a chicken thyme rice dish, the chicken tasted really good! Seasoned with the right amount of zest! And I ordered a chicken club sandwich! The chicken in the sandwich is a good size too, they ain't shy with the slab of chicken, woo!  Miranda brought over a new server since she was leaving (sorry I don't remember the name but he was nice). He constantly checked up on us and refilled our waters cups.  To finish, we ordered a chocolate chip pizookie! It took a while to come out though.  They kindly split the bill according to our order, which was much appreciated! Miranda mentioned this before we ordered!"
Nae A.,"San Jose, CA",37,63,34,1.0,5/28/2016,"They forgot about our appetizers. Brought out our food cold and over cooked. When I asked to speak with a manager she brought our appetizer and just apologized because ""it's very busy!"" As a regular at bjs, I do not appreciate the lack of customer service. Never again will I be back here."
Jackie G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,2,1.0,9/28/2015,"#BadServiceHere. they served my burger on top of a cookie sheet. Weird huh? When my husband & I went for dinner, our waiter (white male) forgot my husbands salad & he forgot about my beer. He didn't charge us for it, But! BJs brewery forgetting to serve their patrons beer? Bad. ATTN: to the Yelpers who have had similar experiences like mine: before u decide where u will dine out, let's make a pact: TIP LESS or DO NOT LEAVE A TIP IF THE SERVERS DONT SERVE. Don't feel guilty. I did but then it hit me: They didn't have the bad dining experience, YOU did. & you aren't taking home a $200+ tip-cash for working half-assed. They are. Other than that, great Pizookies. Final review: my burger came out on a cookie sheet, & you forgot my beer& side salad. One star."
Esteban B.,"Phoenix, AZ",84,155,237,2.0,8/23/2015,"Awesome selection of beers, too bad our server made recommendations based on her personal taste instead of trying to understand what we liked. Â I tried a Jeremiah Red, delicious. Â I was talked out of the pirhana pale ale, she described it as ""Hoppy to the point of bitter, with a strong finish"" Â Yes, it was hoppy, and delicious, I would have had more. Â The Jeremiah Red was pretty darn good as well. Why do I talk about the beer instead of the food? Â Because the food was not that great. Â The food server even worse. Â Here's how it plays out. Â I ordered a ribeye steak, medrare, with cheddar mashed potatoes and a wedge with Blue Cheese dressing. Â What I got was a steak that was medwell at one end, rare at the other and tough all over. Â Barely seasoned, there was no salt/pepper on the table, but after chewing on this for a while, I understood why she brought the A-1. Â I held out as long as I could, but I finally gave in. Â  The wedge of lettuce with Blue Cheese dressing never appeared. Â That is, until the steak arrived, accompanied with mashed potatoes and potato wedges. Â Really?? Â Does anybody from the server to the chef to the expediter actually read the tickets, then think about the order? Â Wouldn't you question the dueling potatoes? Â I called this to the servers attention, and she claimed ""well, I ordered the lettuce wedge! Â Um, yeah, okay, where is it and why am I being served wedge potatoes? The salad arrived shortly and it was the best part of the meal. Â My beer glasses started stacking up on the table as the server came by to check back, then a few minutes later, with a bite of A-1 covered steak halfway to my mouth, she comes back to see if we want dessert. Â Timing. Â You need it. Â After we turned it down, she went away again. Empty beer glasses still on the table. We were still chewing on our dinner when she dropped the check off. Â ""No hurry, she says, Take your time"" Â  OMFG, are you really trying to get stiffed? -5 stars for the service. Â -3 stars for the food. Â +2 stars for the beer."
Jennifer H.,"Orange, CA",45,151,17,1.0,9/27/2015,"Horrible service. After getting seated I waited for over 15 minutes and still no sign of my server. Didn't get my drink till at least half an hour later. I only ordered three appetizers to share, and that took about another 45 min. Then when she brought it out, all of our food was not even hot anymore. Especially my calamari. It was cold and all soggy. Of course, it took probably another 20 minute just to pay. As I left, the two hostesses up front saw me leaving but just decided to chit chat with each other instead and completely ignored me. Did not even acknowledged me at all. Not even a nod or a thank you. Service was unwelcoming from beginning to end."
Abby I.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,35,43,5.0,7/25/2016,"Not sure why this location has such a low star rating. My boyfriend and I were in and out in an hour, had great service, and the food was amazing! BJs is always a good place to visit in any state!"
