Lori G.,"Whittier, CA",3,9,,1.0,7/6/2016,"It's truly a shame that such a reputable establishment such as this one would have a location with TERRIBLE service. If you are craving something off the BJ's menu, but have all the time in the world, won't get put off by a long wait for a table; won't mind going thirsty for extended periods of time; won't mind getting your party's food out at different times and don't mind making repeated requests... then this is your spot!"
Aaron M.,"Garden Grove, CA",148,7,9,5.0,12/24/2015,This has become our regular go to restaurant as food and service are always top notch! Highly recommend! On a side note just wanted to thank our server Toni (excellent service!) and all the staff at BJ's for working on Christmas Eve and giving me and my wife a place to go for dinner on this beautiful evening! Thank you! Merry Christmas and Happy holidays to you all! :-) \m/_
Poi S.,"Clovis, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/25/2017,Really horrible waited 45 mins food was cold sucks. Never will go back. Thanks For Nothing
Diane P.,"Culver City, CA",0,17,,1.0,7/4/2017,"If there was an option to give zero stars, I definitely would. My fiancé and I went here this evening to have dinner before going to Disneyland. We were seated very quickly and our server did not speak to us or look at us for FIFTEEN minutes. My fiancé and I sat there wondering if we should just get up and leave or get up and find the manager. The waitress finally came over to us and didn't apologize for the wait and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered our drinks, apps, and entrees all at once, fearing she would never return! We tried to order ribs and they were all out- so weird! She asked us if we wanted our apps to come out before our entrees and we agreed. Literally two minutes later, she brings out my fiancé's Irish mule and my house salad, which had the tiniest amount of dressing. We sat there waiting for my drink to arrive and my fiancé's Caesar salad. A few minutes later I received my drink but still no sign of the salad! Our appetizers arrived and the artichoke was good but our flatbread was soggy and undercooked! Still no sign of the Caesar salad! The waitress walks over and asks if everything is alright and I told her the salad had not arrived and she admitted she never put the order in!! My drink was empty and she did not offer to get me a refill, I had to ask her to please get me more iced tea! She did not ask my fiancé if he wanted another cocktail, which could have increased the check total and her overall tip. Our entrees arrived right after that and my pizza was doughy and messy. The waitress came back over and asked if we got the salad yet, and since we did not we just cancelled it because our meal was already at the table. The food was alright, definitely not the best we have at at BJ's. As we expected, our waitress took forever to get our check and to run our card. I definitely would not return to this location."
Leasha C.,"Olympia, WA",261,584,688,5.0,12/4/2013,"I am so happy they put a BJs at the Block now. The location is nice, parking is a bit annoying but when isn't parking at the Block annoying? Walking in, the place is very clean, the staff are nice and greet you right away. We decided to take my brother-in-law out to dinner for his bday on Sunday the 1st. Parking was crazy but walking in, it wasn't that busy. My fiance and I ordered the 2 for $35. He got the pork chops and tortilla soup while I ordered the salmon and house salad. I have to say, we were both very pleased. He has a big appetite so we tend to stay away from the 2 for $ deals because he never gets enough to eat. These were full portions. The salmon was amazing, I typically don't like ordering fish out because most places over cook it and dry it out. Not BJs, it was perfect. Exactly how I would have cooked it at home. Moist, nicely seasoned and everything. My fiance had no complaints about the pork chops. My Brother-in-law and mother-in-law both ordered a burger with blue cheese (yuck) they were both very happy with no complaints. All-in-all, I'm very happy with this location and think they've finally brought something new to the Block, it was much needed. There is only so many times you can go to D&B and Fridays before you're tired of both. Happy to see something new. :D  **Update** our server was Johnathan. he was amazing, always on top of things and fixed anything that went wrong. Its a new location so the kitchen is still trying to work out the kinks and communicate with the wait staff. Nothing to deduct stars over though. They see the mistakes, they acknowledge them, and they're fixed immediately.  Perfect customer service. I'll pick this location over the others. 2nd visit: Dec. 21 for our 8th anniversary.   We decided to sit out on the patio. Oh man, if this was our first visit, it would have for sure been our last. Eulises was our server. We both ordered tea. I ordered the fruit flavored tea and me fiance got black unsweetened. The entire meal my fiance was lucky to get 1 refill. Not to mention, we had to basically bombard them to get them to stop so we could get a refill.  A girl we stopped to get a to-go container from did more in the 3 seconds she worked with us than he did along with the person that released him for his lunch did the entire hour or so we were there."
Sean O.,"Garden Grove, CA",34,63,,5.0,9/30/2016,"I don't have too much to say about this restaurant. BJ's has become a traditional favorite with my family. They have a very wide assortment of food; I'm not a big fan of their pizza, but their burgers are really good. Their Pizzokies, however, are amazing!  Their service is really slow, but understandably, they are frequently very busy, so I don't recommend coming here if you are on a tight schedule!  Another warning: their food is really heavy!  Other than that, I highly recommend BJ's."
Ray S.,"San Diego, CA",28,2,5,5.0,8/4/2016,"I don't understand why this place is rated so bad! Crazy! However, our waitress Christina went out of her way to make things happen for us. The guacamole burger was made just the way we ordered and OMG on the Mac and cheese! Definitely coming back and the service was fantastic!"
Edd P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,33,1.0,11/22/2015,"You don't start off telling the guess that's how it is. The picture shows the dish and the menu says drizzled with soy ginger sauce. I don't see the sauce or smell it or taste it. So I ask the waiter and all she did was tell me that's how it is. And brings me a menu, until I point it out she offer to bring me some extra sauce on the side. But the worst part is everyone is like on a rush or something that they don't even stop for a second to talk to there guess. So the food runner drop off the food and ran off before I could even ask him for silverware, so I waited 5 minutes before a waiter drops by to give me silverware to eat my food. Only to eat a dry up over cook salmon. Sure it's the roasted salmon but look at the picture and look at there picture tell me if that's the same."
T M.,"Orange, CA",2,7,7,2.0,5/11/2016,"We were watching the St.  Louis and Dallas Stars hockey,  and they change the channel to watch a fricken basketball game that was already over.  It was like the Raiders football game ""Heidi"", fiasco all over again."
Uri R.,"Garden Grove, CA",54,37,116,4.0,7/25/2016,"So I came for my birthday I always like this place because of the pzookie obviously no one else has it but the food is always good as well. I got the appetizer platter it was really good actually I had never tasted the avocado rolls and they were amazing I will get them from now on and then my dad got the lemon chicken my girl got the ravioli which was amazing and is now my favorite dish and I got the steak the one for like $26 which is suppose to be the best one but I was really disappointed with it, the taste was bland even the mashed potatoes kinda sucked honestly if your looking to eat steak might as well go to Lucile's way better for the same price. Thats the reason for the 4 stars if the steak was great I would of given this place 5 stars because service is good as well as all the other food oh one other thing that kind of sucked was my kids pizza he didn't even eat it. They have to make a better pizza for kids overall though it was a good experience."
Ismael C.,"Anaheim, CA",110,66,20,2.0,9/19/2015,"Oh man, the service here needs so much work. The server either just came back from a funeral or didn't care. I'm not saying you have to be a cheerleader, but a smile wouldn't hurt. The food came out lukewarm, so that was disappointing.  At least they have a good beer list!"
Michael W.,"Anaheim, CA",193,7,,1.0,5/7/2016,"Inaccurate online order service. I ordered the food with a thirty minute ready time. Arrived on site by the ready time and the order was not ready for another thirty minutes. Upon arriving home with the food picked up, there were two missing orders and all the food was cold. It may have been my fault for trusting the accuracy of BJs employees' competency, but next time I would take the extra time to double check my order or just go to another restaurant with better service. I called back to request my money back for the missing orders."
Tina T.,"Orange, CA",4,61,56,4.0,1/21/2015,"I've only been to this location twice and overall it's a nice place to dine at with company.  The first time I went was for dinner and I received excellent service. My server was very attentive and checked up on us constantly. I wasn't sure about which salmon dish to order, but my server was very detailed in explaining about each dish so I ended up getting the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon because it was on the sweeter and saucier side rather than the buttery baked Atlantic Salmon. It was about $15 and I was very happy with my choice! The second time I went was for lunch with a large group of nine people and our server was excellent also. I ordered the classic bacon burger for about $11. For dessert, of course you have to order a pizookie! They have about 8? 9? flavors of the pizookie. My favorite is the cookies n cream one! The regular single pizookie is about $7. It comes with the baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top and whip cream.  I took off a star in my review for this place because one of my friends found a piece of hair in his pasta. It was taken back and redone but it took forever! We were all done with our meals before it came back again. I felt bad because he was starving while all of us ate and finished before he even had a bite of his dish."
Reneesha R.,"Anaheim, CA",70,65,14,2.0,7/20/2014,"I've eaten at a number of BJ's locations, and this is by far the worst. What a shame.  I came here right after I got off of work from a store in the mall I just wanted a nice cool drink and a pizza to wind down from a long day at work. It was about an hour from closing, so I did not expect any problems. I made a note to the hostess that my boyfriend was on his way and was using crutches, so she seated me accordingly. So I sat alone for awhile hoping the server would come around and get me a drink while I waited. However, she didn't show up until 15 minutes later when my boyfriend had already arrived.  So I ordered the berry burst cider and a Jeremiah red for my other half. Then we ordered the BJ's classic pizza in a shareable size (14 inches). The drinks came first. It kind of took awhile for them to arrive, but when they did, they were ice cold and delicious. Then we waited for the pizza. That also took awhile. When it arrived, my boyfriend and I looked at each other and gave a look of 'this isn't quite right'. The pizza looked small and was quite misshapen. It was also cut horribly.  We called the server over to make sure we actually got the shareable pizza rather than the individual (which is 11 inches). She assured us that it was the correct size and even counted the slices (the shareable is supposed to have 10 slices while the individual has 6 slices, but come on, you can cut 10 slices in a smaller pizza and call that the bigger one, which is what I believe they did). Kind of bs considering that the shareable is $20 while the individual is $13, so we completely got ripped off.  So we ate the whole thing fairly quickly, which is much different than all the other times we've ordered pizza from BJ's. Usually we have some leftover to take home even when we are super hungry, but not this time. Then, for some reason unknown to me now, we ordered dessert. I wanted the new peanut butter smores pizookie, but my boyfriend didn't want to get it here because they ""might f**k that up too."" So we got the new peach cobbler instead. That ALSO took way longer to come out than expected, which by this time was just getting ridiculous because there was barely any people in the restaurant when I got there and I know the kitchen wasn't shutting down yet, so there was honestly no excuse for food to be coming out so slowly.  While I do have a complaint about the cobbler, I don't believe it's the fault of this particular BJ's. All the components eaten together made it taste like a mouthful of ginger. Perhaps that's my palette, but it just tasted off to me.  I'm seriously not a picky person, especially when it comes to food and I tend to give services the benefit of the doubt, but I hold BJ's to a certain standard having eaten there so many times. If you're going to charge $7 extra for 3 more inches on the pizza, it damn well better be the right size and not look like the chef just smacked it down on a plate and haphazardly sliced it. And please train the staff! It seems like they were all new hires with no experience in serving or cooking. While the decor was just lovely, everything else felt flat.  I think we'll just stick to the Cerritos location where the manager, Ulf, is a sweetheart who cares about the guests and the servers give you an enjoyable experience. Corporate, I hope you're reading this."
Jazmin R.,"Santa Ana, CA",22,16,8,3.0,12/18/2014,"Okay. I've been to this location plenty of times and I'm certain now that the service is not very good at all. In my experience waiters have always been so inattentive, my food has taken forever to come out and just slow service overall. I can say however attitude has never been the problem. All staff I've dealt with has been friendly for the most part.  I'll give it 3 stars though because the food itself was great even though it took a while to come out."
Aamir R.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,25,,3.0,10/18/2015,"Went in early on a Saturday to watch some college football. It was nice that they were open and offering a full menu. Unfortunately they decided to have only 1 screen on college football (the others were NFL network and MLB network). When requested to change it up, the bartender said she had to ask the manager. He didn't do anything and eventually the bartender tried to do it herself. After 1 hour still only had 2 games on.  They have a large video board over the bar which shows 1 game on a good size and three tiny games below it. Those sub screens are a waste and can't be seen from anywhere.  The food was average (no better or worse than any other BJs) and the beer is always nice and cold. This place is good for hanging out but if you want to watch sports forget it.  This review applies to this location only."
Rinchen N.,"Corona, CA",2,7,2,2.0,7/8/2015,"Wish I could give them more stars. They need to improve their service, attitude and organization. Manager had to comp part of our food. We had to remind server of our drinks. They had to remake our food....  Sadly, for what you pay the food really isn't all that great. It's decent, but no where close to wow."
Katie R.,"Whittier, CA",51,67,3,1.0,6/11/2015,"I love the BJs I usually go to in Lake Forest, and I suggested to come to this location for everyone's geographic convenience with a group of seven for what was supposed to be a fun night out. Instead, we all ended up leaving angry due to the sorry service we received.  It was on a Monday night and it wasn't exceptionally busy, yet it took 45 minutes to get a table. When we finally were seated there were six of us squished into a booth designed for 4, and a member of our party arrived shortly after us had to find a chair and pull it up herself to fit.  The waitress took forever to get our drink orders, and by that time happy hour was long gone. She was super rude when we asked about getting happy hour prices after waiting for her for so long, and in the end we only got one round at happy hour price. She had an annoyed, pissed off expression the entire time she was serving us. It's obvious that she hates her job. Soup and salads started to be brought to our table, and I thought ""oh, did you guys order appetizer salads?"", and they said ""no, this is all we ordered"". I thought it was really dumb that they would bring out the food at different times. Half our party had already finished eating by the time everyone else's food was brought out.  Our dirty dishes sat at our table the entire meal, our water glasses were never refilled, our waitress was impossible to track down. When finally someone made eye contact, we told her we wanted to order pizookie. The pizookie was brought out 20 minutes later. By this point I had enough, and sent it back because we were just anxious to get out of there.  Someone called over the manager, who was useless. He just stood there befuddled by the whole situation like he didn't even know how to do his job. When someone has a bad dining experience, you should be doing everything you possibly can to make it right. The manager finally cleared our table of dishes after we pointed it out to him, and we never saw our waitress the rest of the night. Our checks took an additional 15 minutes to get to us, and there was no discount, no offer to come back, no free appetizer, nothing. It was really disappointing, and a complete wet blanket on our night out. I can't remember the last time I received such crummy service at an industry that should be based on customer service. I'm paying for the experience, I wouldn't normally go and spend $20 on pizza. Take some notes from the Lake Forest"
Adele T.,"Anaheim, CA",81,2,,1.0,4/21/2016,"We had the worse experience at this location.  Beer spilled on my husband, terrible service, and sticky menus. It was crowed but that is no excuse, they were not short staffed, but lacked attention to detail. We have been eating at BJ's since 1993 in Seal Beach and sad to say this is another chain restaurant that has lost their way in providing excellent service.  You cannot go wrong for happy hour or dessert, otherwise, don't go here."
Yesenia N.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,21,3,2.0,1/17/2016,I went for lunch and let me say it was very nice and clean. The host was nice and friendly. We waited around 2 min to be seated. The waiter we got was bad. I asked him a question regarding the menu and he said he didn't know what each plate contained and he only tried one or two before. My group and I ordered and he brought us our drinks. We waited around 45 min for the food and we wanted refills but he never came around asking if we needed anything. When we finally got our food it was not exactly what we ordered. We ended up just eating and leaving. Not coming back here! Staff should be trained a little better.  P.S we still left a nice tip
