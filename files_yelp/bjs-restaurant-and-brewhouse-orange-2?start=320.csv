James B.,"Maylene, AL",0,11,,2.0,6/5/2015,"We had a large party (of 9), and we understood that it takes time for a table to be available. But when our ""reserved"" time had past, and a party of 7 had been called ahead of us, the downward spiral of poor service began. We were offered outside seating on a cold night, with children; I don't think so. They pushed tables together to accommodate us, with end positions falling off the table. The wait staff took almost 10 minutes to fill drink orders. When the food was finally delivered, one member of our party was missing his plate.  After another 10 minutes he was told they could not locate it, another server had taken it. He was comped dessert after declining a replacement meal.  Food was good, but service sucked!  The manager's apology was weak and empty. I'll go to a BJ's again, but not the one in Orange."
Vicki V.,"Los Angeles, CA",229,458,145,2.0,6/4/2014,"One of the worst bjs experiences and this was my first time at this location. Got seated promptly by a nice host but then I waited and waited and nobody ever came by to take my order... Mind you I'm on a lunch break and I had to get back to work!! I decided to do take out instead. So I let the hostess know I wanted take out. She just pointed over to the left side and told me to order there. So I go over there and nobody is there to help me. I am about to walk back to the hostess table but run into food runner and they said they'd get somebody to help me. I wait a little longer and someone finally takes my order. I paid and wait another 14 min for a mini pizza and salad (arugula beets salad is an extra $2! Pricey much?). Now lunch specials are about 6.50 m-f before 3pm, just be sure to read the fine print about extras. Though I'd give the food 3 stars, I give service 2. Total 2.5stars.. In the future I'll be sure to just call in an order to go."
Angiie L.,"Santa Ana, CA",142,6,,5.0,9/4/2016,I absolutely love bjs I always come here with my girls and we never leave unsatisfied. We usually get the same thing broccoli cheddar bowl and spaghetti. The water taste delicious too. Will continue to keep eating here.
Thu N.,"Garden Grove, CA",36,7,7,1.0,12/24/2016,"This place has one of the worst service ever. My friends and I have been here for almost 3 hours and we had a our servers continuously switched and each new server gets worst then the last. One foodrunner almost dropped a plate of food on me and didn't bother to apologize or anything. The food took half an hour to arrived and not once did the server come by [voluntarily] to check up on us. We had to literally try to make eye contact with the servers if we want any service. Other workers would look at our table and completely ignored our table. I don't expect a five stars restaurant but I was hoping for better service then a low class diner. Our waitress had the nerve to ask if one of her table left without paying. Like wtf. Hopefully they improve their service because it's ridiculous and this whole experience was a joke. Honestly, go to Cheesecake Factory or something alike because chances are you will receive a better service."
Heather S.,"Orange County, CA",0,53,8,1.0,6/9/2015,"Terrible service! The problem is that there was no service at all.  We were seated for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us to take drink orders. The waitress was not knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. We had to wait quite some time before anyone appeared to take our dinner order. The waitress even talked back with a fresh attitude when we asked questions! No one ever took care of drink refills or clearing dirty dishes. The food did not come out at the same time when it finally decided to show up. No one ever checked up on us to see if we needed anything. It's like no one actually works there! People in our party asked for missing utensils and never received any. They had to grab some themselves from a nearby table. It took forever to even receive the bill even after trying to hunt someone down to deliver it. I have never had such a bad service experience at a restaurant before. The staff is completely negligent. All the manager did was give a weak apology. That's all. Unbelievable. Thank goodness the food was at least average. Do not go to this location. They are incompetent, rude, and understaffed."
Alex K.,"Whittier, CA",3,30,1,5.0,6/24/2016,"John R. provided the BEST service! It was top notch. He did a great job, was funny, and intelligent. It's probably safe to say it was some of the best service I've received at a restaurant. Management staff, give him a raise and/or promotion!"
Chago M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,15,1,2.0,8/17/2016,Bad service. Long wait even though there were lots of open tables. Pizza took forever and arrived warm as if it had been sitting a while. Pizza was badly sliced and almost impossible to serve.  We had some left over and asked for a box. The waitress brought a small Styrofoam container too small for the amount left.
Kathy A.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,62,2,5.0,2/10/2017,"Steak dinner for under $25 was way better than any Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Fleming's steak I've ever had. Our server Michelle H got our order perfect (we are very picky orderers) and the chef did an excellent job of fulfilling our requests. From start to finish the service and food were perfect! Thank you Michelle H and BJs!"
Mia L.,"San Diego, CA",578,1138,1507,3.0,4/15/2014,3. Brunch at BJs for my friend's bday. It was interesting we never knew there was a brunch menu at BJs.  It was a really big party about 15 people. I had their Veggie Omelette and the main reason I ordered it was because I prefer egg whites. I didn't realize it but when the food came out the portions was super small. I guess that's why the title was enLIGHTened. The light part was in red. I didn't pay attention until my meal came and looked at the menu again. Dang it. LOL. Not bad the Omelette was good but it would have been nice if I have gotten more of it. Oh well lesson learned.  There are so many great tasting brunch places so its hard to give a good review for BJ for their brunch. They are definitely a higher rating when it comes to the Pizookie.
Wendy A.,"Orange, CA",31,6,4,5.0,7/20/2016,Love Bj's! The food is always delicious. Just when you think what you want to order...you find a new item in the menu. Our server Ralph was amazing' didnt miss a beat. Will be back and asking for Ralph by name. Thanks Bjs & Ralph for exceeding our expectations...
Dana M.,"Pasadena, CA",11,75,40,4.0,9/28/2015,"Ah. The restaurant chain with the pornographic name. Somewhere inside my head I feel a bit pervy when I offer ""BJs"" as a suggestion for a place to chow down. As I'm certain at least half the of the U.S. already knows what it's like to dine at one of their 159 locations, I'll strive to avoid repetition. As someone pretty much over the ""let's try new restaurants just for fun"" phase of my life, BJs and/or Yardhouse are generally the establishments I fall back on. Burgers, pizza, pasta, salads, beer, sandwiches...you know the drill. The chain is pretty consistent in terms of taste, quality (eh...that's 'sports bar' quality, not Jack's Bistro...), and vibe. If you actually want to talk to and hear the people/person you're with, keep in mind BJs has pretty raucous noise levels. Then again, if you're on a blind date with a real tampon, the decibel level could work in your favor.  This is the first time I've been to the Orange location...came here on Thursday after playing hooky from work to spend the afternoon at Sunset Beach. Located at the Block in Orange (now the City...I think), the parking may be a bit hairy depending when you go. Shopping center madness. But after the mass of calories you will most likely consume, it may not be such a bad thing to hoof it an extra half mile back to the car after dinner. Listed are some notable points from my most recent visit:  FOOD/BEER: -Avocado Egg Rolls - Deee-to-the-lish. -Pizza - I wanted to like it but it was only a meh. Couldn't decide so I got 1/2 Pepperoni Extreme and 1/2 Chicken Bacon Ranch. When I questioned our server about the CBR, he built up the taste sooooo much I felt mighty disappointed when it I discovered it to be practically void of taste. AVOID this one. Greasy and bready. Carbocide. Zzzzzzz. :( -If you're into IPAs - Go for Jeremiah Red. If you like something lighter - Go for the Lightswitch Lager. I generally fluctuate between the two, depending on my mood. :) -Check out the beer blends - 1/2 beer and 1/2 cider - saw this after I ordered my beer. Note to self: try next time. TIPS:  -BJs almost always has a guaranteed 20-30 min wait time. Don't feel like waiting? Try this: put your name down w/ the hostess, then scope out the first come, first serve bar area - they offer the same menu. You may get lucky."
JB J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,2,1.0,8/5/2016,Horrible place.  Bartender can't add if his life depended on it.  Charged me other people's tab.  They ran out of my fav beer.  Complete incompetence going on in this place.  Plenty of other and better places to eat and drink at the block.  Avoid avoid avoid this place.
Michelle T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",480,472,701,4.0,7/30/2014,"Came here on a double date for brunch. We came right when they opened, so no one else was at the restaurant.  Service here is great (as it should've been, since we were the only ones there for a while). I ordered an omelet dish, and it was definitely filling. My boyfriend ordered a similar omelet dish, along with the coffee. He raved about the coffee, saying it's delicious and flavorful. So, does anyone know what coffee BJ's uses?!"
Ivan V.,"Covina, CA",0,6,4,1.0,1/28/2017,"Service was zero star material. Waiter was impatient and frustrated because he mixed up the orders. He wanted me to tell him what was in the mashed potatoes and he walked away laughing before even checking. The fact that we spilt the bill seemed to upset him as well. The food took too long. They finally brought all the main entrees but couldn't manage to bring out someone's wing order (appetizer). The dessert still hasn't made it out. We don't ask for much or complain to management, just pretend to care somewhat."
Jessica L.,"Anaheim, CA",57,29,7,3.0,5/15/2015,"***Update*** **Tiffany contacted me to try to make the situation right.  We went back the other night and did have a much better experience.  We actually got the right pizza this time and our waiter was nice.  I really appreciate that BJ's listened to my complaint.  Thanks again Tiffany!  ** This server was extremely RUDE.  He did not refill my drink at all or come by to check on us.  When he did come by he would keep saying that he can put in a pizookie and we politely declined.  He came back 2 more times with an attitude making sure that we didn't want one.  Both times he came back I still had an empty glass on the table waiting on my refill.  They also brought us the wrong pizza and I told him.  We always order the great white so I know what it looks like and what ingredients are on it.  The server told us this was it!  We were so hungry we weren't going to argue.  I had a $5 off coupon and I could tell he wasn't thrilled about that either. The food is good, but the service is not.  We will go to BJ's in Brea instead.  This service is the worst!"
Simar G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/7/2016,Horrible service. They can't even get their seating arrangements organized. We came in with a party of 12 and she called us to seat 2 after we waited half an hour. Worst part was she simply smiled and said oh sorry we won't be able to do that.
Gail F.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/8/2016,"Not sure what happened to the customer service. It was TERRIBLE! Our food was delivered with no plates or silverware. We tried several minutes to get a waiter/waitress' attention to no avail. I finally got up and chased down our server who unapologetically informed us that they were ""out of silverware"". We could only eat some of our meal and had to box the rest and leave!... They did not offer us a discount for our meals that got cold w/o utensils. BJ's food is very good but they need to invest in serious customer service training. We will not go back."
Dr. Kevin K.,"Norco, CA",2,19,7,3.0,6/7/2015,We were seated at a clean table but there were a lot of crumbs of food on the seats. That is quite disgusting.  My family and I ordered pastas and steaks. The food takes about half an hour to make them. I don't think that it will take that long. The restaurant is not that crowded though. They did serve our drinks and calamari very fast. I did love the decorations on the food by the way. The Asian man with the hair bun did a great job taking care of us.
Jeong P.,"Irvine, CA",275,430,1044,2.0,4/4/2014,"I've never been a fan of BJ's, because it's just a run of the mill chain restaurant and their beers are not very good. But I thought that stopping in for a quick happy hour would be decent. I was wrong. We ordered a few things off the happy hour menu, and it seemed like a pretty good deal. But in reality, the food is crap. What's the point of even having a happy hour menu, if the items are gonna be this half-ass? I suspect they have gotten complaints about this before, because I noticed that they write ""happy-hour size"" above each selection. The portion sizes are pathetic, even for the $4-5 that they charge. Do yourself a favor and just order a regular menu item. At least you won't feel insulted when they bring you the cheapest constructed food known to man, that they call their happy hour food. Also, our server was a douche. Just because you don't actually say anything rude, doesn't mean that you're not being rude. I understand people who don't like their job, but sometimes you just need to suck it up. This place sucks. But it must be nice to know that you can be this bad, and still continue to get customers."
Michael B.,"Santa Ana, CA",7,58,8,2.0,10/8/2015,"I forgot to write a review the last time I was in here.  I was a few months back.  The service was horrible.  Just simply excusable.   I've been going to BJ's Pizza since way back in the 80's when it was just a little place on Balboa with the best pizza in Orange County. Too bad corporate thinking ruined the place. As a side note:  I've gone a few times to this location in the last couple years by myself for a quick bite to eat in the bar, those experiences have been good.   The food is usually good. My last experience in Brea was great. But, boy, the last time in this BJ's was too much. I'll have to be bribed to try again.  Or be stuck with a group decision to go."
