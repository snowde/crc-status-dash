Sara D.,"La Habra, CA",120,51,16,3.0,3/8/2015,I went here for dinner last night with my boyfriend.  It took over an hour to get a table.  While waiting we took a seat at the bar.  The bartender was really busy and while this has absolutely no bearing on the restaurant I got sucked into a half an hour long religious lecture by a guy sitting next to me at the bar... It was just a really busy night but it was over an hour and a half before we were served our food.  We both got burgers which were really good!  The meat was cooked perfectly!   I feel very meh about this place.  It wasn't awful by any means but I also don't feel like I found a gem.  Just pretty standard.
Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,8/4/2014,"Located off to the side of the Orange Outlet. Plenty of parking. Nice place inside! They have happy hour, but it's only in the bar area so go and seat yourself. Berry Sweet Limeade Mocktail ($3): pomegranate syrup, sierra mist, and lime slices. Nothing too special about it all, but it comes with free refills! Southern Fried Chicken ($13): 2 pieces of fried chicken on top of mashed potatoes with gravy and corn. I enjoyed it. Chicken was crispy, but a little too salty. Mashed potatoes and corn were definitely my favorite part of the whole dish. Ribeye Steak ($20): 14 oz steak with choice of 2 sides. The 2 sides that my BF picked were green beans and clam chowder. He asked for the clam chowder to come out before his entree and the soup alone could fill you up! Plenty of clam pieces and I didn't have any sandy bites. Steak was cooked rare, just how he wanted it. It could have used some more flavor though. Service:  It was good. Our waitress was super nice. She was quick to get things done. Food was brought out pretty quick. Drinks were refilled before they were even half empty."
Blake L.,"Issaquah, WA",380,31,9,3.0,7/20/2016,"Pretty average restaurant in theme and feel, like many other places, but they do have a great selection of beer. Whether you sit up at the bar or in the restaurant the beer selection is wonderful. The service is decent and the food is good, not great. I would highly recommend their famous pizzookie if you have room after dinner!"
James L.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/3/2016,Very Lousy Service ... There's only 1 waitress per row & manager doesn't give a damn.  We waited for 1/2 hour without a waitress taking the order.   We went to the bar to get Better service & the bartender was so busy doing drinks.  She didn't bother taking our order. We complained to the manager & she just shrugged her shoulders
Cornelius R.,"Placentia, CA",18,32,68,4.0,9/28/2015,"BJ'S is a great little spot.  The food is delicious.  Me and my wife had the dinner for two: (pan pizza, salad and pizoock). One of my daughters had the French Toast breakfast and the other had the California club."
Stephen L.,"Placentia, CA",8,15,4,1.0,3/16/2016,WtHeck. Management been waiting for our order for over 40 min. Pls get off your arses and either help or make appropriate changes. This is ridiculous and I think you guys should be at 1 star and corporate takes this location away.
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,7/17/2014,"I've been to this location a handful of times and I've never been disappointed.  Most recently we were here on Sunday which also happened to be the World Cup Final.  A group of six were here celebrating my birthday and they were very accommodating getting us a table right away. Even though it was crowded for the World Cup game we received excellent service and the food came out fast and delicious.  We ordered pizza, wings, a few small plates, lettuce wraps and everything was wonderful.  Then we had a variety of flavors of their pizookies and they were delicious.  We all left full and happy.  They also offer patio seating outside which is really quite nice.  Maybe we'll eat out there next time."
Ben N.,"San Francisco, CA",247,129,139,1.0,5/6/2014,"Worst food ever. It's expensive and bland tasting. I got chicken Alfredo, how does someone mess it up? The pasta was under cooked and hard. The chicken was dry and over cooked. There was no sauce. The frozen dinner chicken Alfredo would have tasted even better than what I had. I am just giving one star for the decent service and cleanliness of this place. Other than that I would never come back."
Kayshya S.,"Lahaina, HI",132,5,2,4.0,9/23/2015,"Got the Brewhouse Burger with bacon and cheese for roughly $9! Came with a side of fries and it was awesome :) The wait wasn't too long and they texted my cellphone when a table was available! How convenient! Service was awesome, many different servers came to stop by to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything.  It was my first time there and I would definitely go again!!"
Jake B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,2,1.0,12/22/2016,"My food never came out! Check came and then the waitress tells me ""your food got burnt""? After, waiting 20 minutes with no explanation. Never coming here again!"
Patty G.,"Anaheim, CA",8,16,8,4.0,8/10/2014,"So decided to try this place again even though I said I'd rather drive to the one on beach, didn't feel like wasting gas. We sat in the bar section, our waitress was great! She was very friendly and attentive ordered a strawberry mojito very delicious it was just missing a strawberry garnish!  our pizza came out before our wings so I was getting skeptical , our waitress checked on that right away she apologized for it but since wings and pizza go together we didn't really mind.  Finally! The pizza taste delicious, the crust is nice and crispy the wings are nice and spicy! Over all great lunch!  Will be back for the pazookie !!"
Brooke H.,"Garden Grove, CA",296,1,,1.0,1/20/2017,This place doesn't even deserve a star. I cannot believe when you have a big party how long it takes for a table. We came early and everything & we've been waiting for four hours. The service ducks don't come here.
Elizabeth K.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,470,817,5.0,6/15/2014,"COBB SALAD, I love you!  Makes me so happy whenever I eat you!  I also tried the Avocado Eggrolls, Yumm these are yummy so fattening though!   Customer Service is always Great here, no matter how busy they are!  Bathrooms: Are A-Okay!"
Christina G.,"Lakewood, CA",130,334,3802,1.0,3/1/2014,"Worst Happy Hour Menu I have ever seen. Walked in the bar took a seat, looked over the options and walkedover to TGIF's.  BJ's has 1/2 price apps and 1/2 the size. So arn't I paying full price to eat during your down hours?"
Cris L.,"Anaheim, CA",2,17,8,5.0,10/9/2014,Great! Love sitting outside at night by the firepitt .. So romantic Also the waiter we got was on top of everything great service. We were there around 9:40ish  a table of 6. Oh and thier shrimp scampi bowl was delicious and there was enough for me to take home.
Yasmin R.,"Fullerton, CA",77,19,2,5.0,4/17/2016,"I came her last night (4/16/2015) with my boyfriend for dinner. Wait was about 25-30 mins. Wasn't too bad. But our server Jose was amazing! He was so kind, courteous and attentive. Always refilled our drinks and made sure we were taken care of. Food was good too. I'll be coming back for the awesome food & amazing service! Thank you Jose for the first experience!"
Robert T.,"Oceanside, CA",22,127,48,5.0,4/7/2016,"I think people only write reviews of BJ's if they have something negative to report.  I had lunch there, and it was great.  Very good lunch specials...you just have to dig through the book of a menu to find them...sandwich, soup, fries for $8, not bad, and everything was good tasting.  Place is busy, for a reason."
G A.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,16,49,3.0,2/7/2015,"The 3 stars is for the upbeat and friendly service. The food, as at all BJs, is OK at best (it's never awful), but always overpriced. I ordered a pizza for the first time - a ""mini"" (vegetable) pizza. Nearly $11 for a cookie-sized pizza? Really? Certainly enough for a small eater or child. But in terms of price/size ratio, this was pretty awful. And the pizza was completely shoddily made. There was a bit of cheese on one part, a bit of tomato sauce on another, and couple of random vegetables randomly strewn in corners. Taste-wise it was OK. But for that price (and size!) I'd expect a teeeeensy bit more effort. Server was super duper nice though. Thanks :)"
Roy J.,"Irvine, CA",0,51,13,1.0,6/29/2016,"Bug in the food not cool it was so nasty I'm never gonna go to bj Nasty nasty nasty I got there as I was seating at the bar having a beer and waiting on my food the food came and I was eating till I see a BUG yes a BUG in the food I almost threw up tops the bartender she was very fast took the food and told the manager the manager came to my ask I guess there was a little friend in the food like really WTF is that's mean and told me ""don't worry I take it off your bill"" like are you kidding me you think I worry about the bill at this time cuz I'm thinking I may have eat a bug cuz it was a small bug like a flying bug"
Sammi K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",319,10,3,1.0,4/25/2015,"I LOVE eating at BJs. but I will NEVER go to this one again. it took 25 minutes just to get us water. it took almost an hour to get our food. then once we got our food, mine was all cold in the middle. and I ordered my steak medium well it was like extra extra well done I couldn't even eat it because it was so over cooked. we asked for refills 3 times and never got them once and whenever we'd ask for napkins or utensils and even or sides of ranch and sour cream, we never got anything. and on top of all of that, EVERY. SINGLE. table around us complained to the manager as well. EVERYONE. I understand some waiters have their slow days but when the whole dining area complains, you know it's not just the waiter, it's the restaurant."
