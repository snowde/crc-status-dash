Dulce G.,"Santa Ana, CA",102,32,71,4.0,1/30/2015,Melissa took care of us! She is awesome and has great customer service! The food is okay. The drinks are Delish! Love this place! :)
Donna A.,"Tustin, CA",0,8,,5.0,12/22/2016,"The food was great, but it was the service that was outstanding.  My girlfriend and I met up at BJ's in Orange as per our monthly lunch get together on 12/21/16 as per our monthly  and Eric N. took care of us very well.  However, we ended up at his table for over TWO hours and he never complained!  In fact, he offered to get us a dessert menu and refill our drinks.  We realize we used his table longer than we should have, but he remained friendly and gracious.  We also made sure he got a well deserved tip.  Thank you Eric for your fabulous service!  BJ's should be proud to have you on staff."
Chantel H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",136,183,270,4.0,6/4/2015,I love BJ's! The deep dish ravioli is fantastic. It comes with sausage and pepperoni which adds so much flavor. The pizookies are the main reason I go to BJ's whenever in California. I love cookies and cream and you can't go wrong with a chocolate chip.
Ada J.,"Buena Park, CA",845,488,2391,4.0,6/3/2015,"After an Angels game this Location can get overcrowded, a bit of patience will go a long way here. The service, at times, can be slow. Beers are pretty solid and the happy hour is cool too. I only like coming by for happy hour beers."
Ian G.,"Kailua, HI",102,143,107,3.0,6/1/2015,"Great place to eat and talk with friends.  The food itself isn't spectacular but the environment and atmosphere is great  The restaurant is well kept including the outside.  The outside has heated warmers, so you're not freezing.  The server we had wasn't smiling, but she was fast and quick."
Wil S.,"Monterey Park, CA",28,164,219,5.0,7/11/2015,"I really like their jambalaya from BJs, they have a unique blend of spices along with a generous amount of shrimp and hot links.  You can never go wrong a personal size bazooki (cookie with ice cream on top)"
Kim B.,"Portland, OR",361,108,55,4.0,2/26/2014,"3 stars for the food. My boyfriend and I ordered the classic deep dish pizza and the pizza was really dry. We had to ask the waitress for a side of marinara sauce to dip the pizza because it was THAT dry. Probably won't be coming back here for pizza, but may come back to try something else... 4 stars for service. We came really late at night and thought the server would be dying to go home, but she was actually really attentive and friendly. We were taking too long to decide whether we wanted a pazookie so she anticipated our sweet tooth and put in the order. Although we didn't end up wanting it after the pizza, she gave it to us on the house. Thanks Lauren! 3.5 stars overall. Quick and easy place to grab drinks and a pazookie!"
Jane G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",89,271,16,5.0,5/8/2016,Came here with the family for mothers day..ended up sitting in the bar but we got really prompt and friendly service from Christine.  I'd come back to this location for sure when visiting my family.
Ann H.,"Anaheim, CA",0,10,10,1.0,9/25/2015,"If there is an option to rate 0 star, I would do that. The service here need a major improvement. We went there for lunch with 7 people. Took tables at the bar to avoid the wait. Ordered within 2 minutes from sitting down and had to wait 55 minutes before we could get the food to-go. We all agreed that the food quality is also as bad as the service.  The table next to us ended up to-go their food same as us. The funny thing is the manager never showed up and apologize or doing anything to comfort our stupid waiting for nothing lunch. They still charged us the full amount - no apology - no sympathy - nothing. So I guess this kind of situation has happened there everyday to the point that nobody cares. Don't go here for any reason especially when you are on your lunch break. It's a mistake for our group. Don't repeat the same mistake as us."
Dana C.,"Orange, CA",149,100,47,1.0,12/30/2015,Happy hour in bar only.  No help with seating.  No option to bring a baby with you.  Do these people not realize that moms need a drink after shopping with a little one?!?!  Taking my business to TGIF - the service there is better anyway
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,2.0,11/4/2013,"With all the other options at City Drive, we chose BJ's for lunch.  Trust me, there's plenty of other options at this mall.  BJ's was chosen because someone in our group was in a mood for a Pizookie and another person thought BJ's would be quicker than the other restaurants. I got their Blacken Salmon and added a plain baked potato for extra carbs.  My meal was decent, not worth bragging about.  To be honest, I probably wasn't originally going to review this restaurant.  I decided to only because I feel that we received poor service.  It started out well.  We got seated right away and our waitress was on her game.  She made us feel like we were the only ones here.  You know what? We were at the time.  Once 12 PM hit, our waitress was nowhere to be seen.  Our orders took some time and the check took even longer.  So much for a quick lunch between work.  Overall, I will probably choose something else the next time I'm in the area. PS:  This is one clean BJ's.  They got that right, at least. YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (478/500)"
Bothtwoo H.,"Anaheim, CA",75,13,30,5.0,9/21/2015,"Pizza,.wingz, slider, beer all good. All good great place to kick it. Clean place but need more tvs"
Andrew S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,11,5.0,9/21/2015,"The best BJs I've ever been to my far! Being conveniently located right off of the 22; this is a great place to have a drink, watch the game, and know you're going to be taken care of.  The avocado eggrolls are a MUST! R"
Daisy G.,"Anaheim, CA",36,2,,5.0,4/8/2016,By far best service I have ever received. Issy was phenomenal! She went above and beyond to ensure my girlfriend and I were taken care of! Not to mention their happy hour is the best. Thank you Issy for being so great!
Greg H.,"Cambridge, MA",852,19,23,3.0,3/3/2016,"Chain restaurant with a good in-house beer selection. We came late (10pm) which is their late-night happy hour. Their pizzas are more than decent, appetizers were tasty if uninspired. The price of drinks was more than I expected, but the happy hour pricing made it a little better. Good for a group that wants a nicer-than-sports bar experience with similar fare and feel."
Kris B.,"Oceanside, CA",399,602,4414,4.0,9/28/2013,"Everyone loves BJ's!! Hapyy Hour dinner is the best! $5.00 appetizer menu, $6.00 house wine, $3.50 brews. This place is so good, it put Alcatraz out of business!"
Brian G.,"Canyon Country, CA",135,49,28,1.0,2/1/2015,"Management is the worst! Our food came out wrong twice and undercooked. We asked for a manager and they handled the situation like it was our fault. We got tired of their abuse and wanted to leave with a refund, but they refused. The only saving grace were the hosts that were compassionate towards our situation as we left."
Ludin J.,"Santa Ana, CA",67,90,193,2.0,12/15/2013,"This is a new Bj's that is conveniently located closer to my house than any other BJ's. I decided to go here with my family for dinner after some shopping at the Block. The wait was too long and there was plenty of open tables for the amount of time that we waited.  I do not understand why were given two waitresses who both seemed like they didn't know what they were doing. There was no silverware on our table (we didnt notice until we got our food because we didnt get an appetizer). Once we realized there was no silverware it was impossible to track down our waitresses. So we had to ask another waiter who seemed like he was really busy, he was nice enough to bring us our silverware and pepper/parmesan for my dads pizza (he's the only reason I'm giving two stars).   My little brother and I split the grilled chicken pasta. Since I was not eating chicken for the day I didn't notice our dish came without chicken until after I was done with my half. My little brother didn't mention it until after I was done. I was so upset. I didn't bother complaining since I was finished with my portion. We asked for refills and never got them.  Overall, I was not pleased with my experience. I would rather drive to Huntington Beach or Tustin than return to this BJ's."
Greg E.,"Henderson, NV",0,47,8,2.0,7/21/2015,"Yeah. Have to agree with the other reviews. If sitting in traffic for 2 hours to go 20 miles is your idea of fun, then you'll probably be ok with the service here. Sloooooowww. Everything took so long and the waiter, Patrick, made it seem like he was running around like crazy when truly he wasn't.  The Santa Fe Spring Rolls were really good, the pizza was very dry.  I asked for no mushrooms and I think they kept off the sauce too."
Darin W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",31,40,64,3.0,5/3/2015,"This location's Yelp page is riddled with comments and reviews about awful service, to the point where the location is only 2.5 stars. We experienced some of that today during lunch. We were for some reason given a different waiter after only a couple minutes, and he quickly showed service was not his strong point. The meal had odd proportions, one being only 6 pieces of broccoli, and the potatoes were served on the plate from a dishes like ice cream, I hate that. The breaded chicken was also not breaded very well. Overall this location certainly earned it's 2.5 stars today, I gave 3 because I do love BJ'S, but corporate is out of touch with their restaurants I feel. The best part of the meal was the two pazookies we shared and the house root beer."
