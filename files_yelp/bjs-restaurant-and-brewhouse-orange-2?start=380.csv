Clara C.,"Irvine, CA",2017,776,2655,4.0,9/19/2013,"I always love BJs because of their variety of food and drinks!  Their food never disappoints.  But as always, you can expect it to be crowded, even at the bar! This month they're bringing back the 3-course dinner for 2 for only $20!  You and your partner get to choose soup or salad each, then you share a pizza (you can get half and half, too!), and then you share a pizookie :)  Yum!"
Dan S.,"La Mirada, CA",0,11,2,2.0,2/6/2016,"I love the avocado egg rolls, but they made me wait for 1 hour just for egg rolls. I know they get busy but an hour? Really?"
Steven F.,"Anaheim, CA",80,31,72,5.0,1/24/2015,Really love the great white pizza and the chicken ranch.  Go half and half.  Love the salad with EXTRA croutons.  Don't miss the chance to wash down a nice cold buffalo bite beer or a cold refreshing mountain dew.
Travis W.,"Orange, CA",221,551,371,3.0,3/29/2014,"I was pretty happy to hear that they were putting in a BJ's at the Block. (yes it will always be the Block to me) I am not the biggest fan of there pizza based on trying other BJ's restaurants but there other dishes are happy hour deals are pretty great here.  This place is a very clean and nice establishment that offers a wide variety of great brews on tap. Now they don't brew on site which is kind of a bummer but still BJ's beer has gotten a lot better over the years. My wife and I love coming in during football where they do happy hour all day. They have pretty good wings although ask for extra crispy. The Corn Fritters are pretty good and you can grab them for cheap during happy hour. Also my wife is a fan of the Avocado Egg Rolls, these are always great.  The brews here that are made in house varies from season. I recommend the Hop Storm IPA if they have it. Piranha Pale is also pretty tasty but not as hoppy as a IPA. If your a dark beer fan check out the BJs Porter. Oh and to the reviewer that had bad service I have been in here a few times and always sit in the bar area I have had amazing service every time. CHEERS!!"
F P.,"Seal Beach, CA",3,375,46,4.0,3/6/2016,"I don't know why the reviews are low. Yes, there is usually a little wait, but so do most restaurants. yes, the prices are kind of high for most, but overall, service is great, food can be good, and beers are great.  They open late so it's a great place to come by. There is some type of happy hour everyday of the week except saturdays. Late happy hours are 10pm-close."
Nicole P.,"Mesa, AZ",259,43,36,4.0,10/28/2013,"Came here the other day for lunch with a friend. It was my first time to thus location and my friends first time to a Bj's in general. Our server Jessica was fantastic! She had incredible customer service, answered any questions we had and provided perfect suggestions. We got the 2 four $20 w soup and a medium pizza and a delicious pizookie.  Basically service was awesome, fast and the food was really good. Will be back again but only when Jessica is working."
Diana Marie F.,"Carson, CA",5,46,4,1.0,6/9/2015,"We were done shopping at The Block and decided to come in for a bite to eat before we make our 30 minute drive home.  Our waitress, Toni, was great at the beginning. She went on break and then left Maria to wait on us. I'm sure Maria is a hard worker, but she is a hard worker who neglected our table. Our table was full of empty dishes, the pizza we ordered to go looked like someone shoved it in the box. We have enjoyed BJ's for almost 30 years and never saw a pizza boxed the way saw this pizza boxes. When we questioned Toni (who was now back from her break), she paused and didn't offer to just get another pizza made. We had to ask for one. In almost 30 years of eating BJ's in various states, we have always been offered whatever it was that needed correcting by the BJ's staff.  So I asked Mike, the manager, and he clarified that we should not have been asked and handled the situation in a very professional and respectful manner.  I am going to have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the service. But when the manager is called upon, he shows up with the professionalism that we usually get when something happens at a BJ's location.   The service? Not so good. And my husband still gave them a good tip.  The one star is for the service. But the manager, Mike, should receive 5 stars."

Ericka G.,"Columbia, MD",260,419,1625,4.0,2/21/2014,"Move over Cheesecake Factory, Friday's, Houlihan's.... The food was truly amaze balls. I'm regretting the fact that I never took a picture. The really good news is, although I was in California when I first tried this restaurant, I am happy to discover they have locations in quite a few states so look them up.  I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken that's served with mashed potatoes & broccoli. The chicken was so moist, so delish. The mashed potatoes were a little dry, but not too dry that they weren't palatable. I didn't touch my broccoli ;don't judge me) My colleague ordered the Mahi Mahi and cleaned her plate. She said it was the best she's ever had. The only disappointment of the visit was that the appetizer came out after the entree and was overlooked and slightly burnt upon arrival. The manager was apologetic of the mix up in timing and the price of the app was removed from our bill.  If you are a beer lover (I am not, my colleague was), this place has every type of beer and even has a sampler."
Eric L.,"Anaheim, CA",113,21,5,4.0,11/14/2015,I only come for the giant pizza cookies. It's a little pricey for what you get but it is definitely the best thing offered here on their menu. The food is like any other generic restaurant so don't expect much specialty foods.
Lupe S.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,3,,2.0,1/10/2016,"I've been to his location frequently and it's always been good to me. However, today, it let me down to the extent that I'm actually reviewing the place. We got our table around 1140pm and ordered drinks. We waited roughly 30 minutes before we got them. We had ordered calamari and never got that. When our food showed up we were extremely disappointed. My pizza was cold and my friends salad looked like it was something from Carl's Jr. Sad to say but I won't be returning to this place because everybody around us who arrived after we did received their food before us."

Adriana V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1,12,3,2.0,6/13/2016,"First bad experience at BJs! I went on a double date (keep in mind we are all in our early 20's) and literally lost my appetite. The server, Michelle, seemed very friendly at first.... But no. She took a while to get us our drinks and appetizers. Overall, she was just very inattentive with our party. And it was noticeable since she would only keep checking up on the tables right next to us. Long story short, it took more than 40 min to get our burgers... 40 min! At first we were very patient. I get it, it's a Saturday night, it's prolly not her fault. I called a manager over and told him our situation. By then we barely got out food. Michelle asked if we needed anything else, and we said ranch and BBQ sauce please. The guy I called over called the general manager I guess, Ryan. He was very concerned and helpful. They even offered free dessert. Let's forward... 20 min pass and we still haven't gotten our ranch. Now the server is avoiding us. She might have gotten mad for us complaining, but if I'm going to BJs and paying for great food and service, i expect that and nothing less. She finally gets us our ranch and THROWS AND SLAMS THE PLATE FULL OF RANCH AND SAUCE ON THE TABLE. I AM DEFINITELY NOT OKAY WITH FOOD THROWN ON MY TABLE. Still, we thanked her and she didn't even turn to look at  us. That's when i stood up and personally had to find Ryan. I explained the situation. He realized that not only was the food service not good, but our server was incredibly rude and disrespectful. I asked for a change in server and I do appreciate Ryan taking care of the situation and personally bringing us the check. Side note: we didn't get dessert. We all had lost our appetite and decided to leave ASAP! I understand that as younger customers we usually are thought as bad tippers, but honestly that was not the case with us. We didn't complain to just get a ""free dessert"", we just needed to speak up. I didn't make a scene, but I do appreciate the Manager Ryan and how he handled the situation. Will I be back.... Eh. Probably not this location."
Phillip V.,"Santa Ana, CA",167,44,10,3.0,3/4/2015,"This service is hit or miss depending on when you come here. We sat for about ten minutes before our server even acknowledged us and it wasn't even busy for a Wednesday evening. My girlfriend almost wanted to walk out soon after. We ordered the deep dish lasagna with the side salad, and the Mediterranean pita chicken. The salad came out without any utensils so we had to wait again before we could flag down another server because they keep disappearing somewhere. Apparently, our initial server just ended his shift. So he just rushed when he took out orders, never bothered to transfer us to our new server and pretty much left us hanging.  Overall, food and drinks were great.The server that took over was outstanding. The other server needs to be retrained. Only three stars because experience was poor due to service. Maybe that's why he wasn't scheduled a busy shift"
Esther S.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",133,17,2,5.0,2/27/2016,"We stopped here after our trip to Disneyland & celebrated my cousins birthday! I'm only writing a review because we had the best waitress ever, Samantha D! Thank you so much for all of your attention & great customer service! Bj's is lucky to have you as an employee, keep up the great customer service!"
Steve G.,"Star, ID",0,19,5,5.0,8/4/2015,I read the reviews and nearly didn't go but it was close to my hotel.  I had the deep dish pizza with a guiness.  The pizza was very good and the beer was cold.  Service was great.  Menu choices looked good and varied enough I likely will go back.
G P.,"Downtown, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/2/2016,"Spent 20 min to get a table, no biggie but another hour to be served, French fries had an extra cup of salt and French dip had acouple of doses of pepper, wanted to like but rude service and bad food make this a miss"
Tina B.,"Garden Grove, CA",19,17,1,1.0,11/5/2014,"Came here after work because it's closer to home than the Huntington Beach location. All I wanted was an Irish Rootbeer and a Pizookie. It took 15 minutes just to get water. That should have been my first warning sign. However I was too stubborn to leave and ended up waiting over 45 minutes for the pizookie and my drink to arrive. My pizookie was room temperature with the ice cream completely melted. Thank god i asked for no ice or my rootbeer would have been watered down. Never coming to this BJ again, I should have known better.  P.S. I'm writing this 'essay' from my phone as I'm waiting for the bill to arrive. 10 minutes and counting...."
Tim R.,"Corona, CA",33,65,144,2.0,5/15/2016,"I did not have a great experience at BJs restaurant. Firstly I signed up for the club and got the app. Tried to call ahead to Make a reservation and was told they don't do same day, but I could use the online app 30min before I go to st up the reservation. When my date arrived at 1030 pm they didn't have the reservation I made at 10pm. So ball dropped there, but they made good and seated her. Now on top of that we preferred the chicken ranch pizza with the dinner for two special that's being promoted. It comes with 2 soups, a medium pizza, and a pizzuki.  Now the chicken pizza had way too much cilantro and it was clumped weirdly all over. I saw right away that this would make it inedible and my date hates cilantro. I had to ask them to take it back, this they did reluctantly. My date was sure that they would spit in the food and I assured her that this was not the case in such a big and busy kitchen.  Also my date had ordered the creamy broccoli soup and by her face when she tasted it, I could tell that it was disgusting. She had mentioned it was Luke warm. I'm just glad that we didn't get food poisoning. My receipt number was 754 on 5/14/16.  I am very disappointed in BJs customer service."
Gii E.,"Orange, CA",19,13,12,5.0,5/8/2015,Great BJ's Restaurant to eat and relax. The pulled pork sandwich is great. The Pizookie sampler is awesome!
