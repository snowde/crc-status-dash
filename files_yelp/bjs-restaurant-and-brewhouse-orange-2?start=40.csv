Dang C.,"Anaheim, CA",125,4,1,5.0,12/10/2017,Best foil I ever had. 10 out of 10 will foil again. No joke. Ordered  at the bar ended up getting a table... they were cool with moving us around.
Susan T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",83,8,25,5.0,10/3/2017,"We come after our soccer games on Tuesday nights. It's usually busy but not ridiculous packed. Got seated quickly and got our food fresh and quick. It's a group of 7 and no one got the same thing yet all of us were happy with our food and that's hard to do.  On occasion we get Caren as our waitress and it's always the best of service when she gets our table. Seriously one of the best people doing their job here. Always pleasant, speedy, and is able to take jokes when we all throw them her way. Kudos Caren!!! You rock. Thank you for having a sense of humor.  Now for my (future) complaint. They are taking away (beers) Big Wave, Space Dust, and other beers from their menu. So sad to see them go. Wish they would at least keep big wave."
Parisa V.,"Long Beach, CA",6,35,3,5.0,11/22/2017,"Came to BJs around 7:30 the night before Thanksgiving for my husbands birthday. We waited about ten minutes to be sat, pretty standard. We ordered spinach artichoke dip and a medium pizza. Our server Kelly was suuuper chill and accommodating. We (I mean I) was so hungry so she got our order in right away. Just a super pleasant visit and fast service from our server and the kitchen, despite such a busy night. Thanks Kelly!"
Jessica L.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",624,276,732,2.0,2/22/2017,"It really surprises me of all the bad experiences that I have had at BJs since I have moved to SoCal. You can't really go to any major shopping area or any food area without running into one. You would think this means they have their shit together.. Oi how wrong I was. I honestly only ate here because I got a coupon from the Yelp Elite event. And I still don't think it was worth it.  We came here at the tail end of brunch on a Sunday morning, about 5 minutes until it was over to be exact. We were quickly seated and the hostess was nice enough to allow for us to order off of the brunch and as well as the lunch/dinner menu. Unfortunately that is where the meal fell flat. We waited around for quite sometime before our actual waiter came over, by that time we had all decided on what we wanted to eat but for some reason he would only take our drink orders. Fine, whatever its fine.  Time droned on and then he finally came over to take our order. My sister and I ordered off the lunch menu and husband ordered from their brunch menu. With the restaurant being about 50% empty, we didn't expect for there to be such a delay in getting our food - boy were we wrong. And what made it worse is that while we were waiting our waiter didn't even bother to check on us, our cups were left unfilled as we waited. What bothered me most was the he didn't even seem to acknowledge our existence, he would casually stroll by and not make any contact  - not even a ""your food will be right with you."" When our food finally did arrive, of course most of it was wrong. My sister, who driven by her weird cravings only wanted mashed potatoes and french fries - had ordered a side of barbecue sauce when she originally ordered was missing. My husbands simple sunny side up eggs, ham and sourdough toast was completely wrong. The eggs were over hard and the toast was white.. he was content to just suck it up and eat the meal and was midway through chewing on a piece of toast (it came with 4 pieces) but miraculously our waiter decided to come check on us. We informed him of the error and without an apology he simply dismissed it saying ""oh, they must have grabbed the wrong plate."" He grabbed the plate and again the waiting commenced. Again, many times throughout our wait we saw him walk by, never once did he apologize for the delay or even acknowledge us. He came back about 10 minutes later with the exact same plate - I know this because the 3 pieces of white toast were still sitting there with the now cold ham and finally sunny side up eggs. Again no apology was given. He just set down the food and walked away.  The only redeeming thing about my experience here was my chicken soba noodles, they were delicious. The noodles were soft and delicious, chicken and vegetables were plentiful and sauce was just right.  Toward the end of the meal, I was just over it - I wanted to get out of there I was so annoyed. I presented him with my coupon and my credit card and wanted to get things done. He took the coupon and said that he couldn't run the card just yet.. Ugh.. sure? He came back with a receipt but of course it wasn't itemized so there was just no way for me to know if he actually honored my Yelp coupon.. Not wanting to waste anymore time here I ran my card and left.  Not exactly sure what is going on with BJs, their service is just horrendous - even if your food was delicious the service itself leaves a nasty taste in your mouth."
Megan P.,"Orange, CA",2,22,4,1.0,11/19/2017,"For being a corporate company I find it weird that they apparently they don't do ""same day reservations"" Been to this location a few times and service is slow but they can't even take reservations so I'm confused as to what they do"
B G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,11,2,1.0,9/29/2017,"This place sucks.....John was a pretty crappy server. I ordered a beer, nothing......I had to go to the bar and get my own drink. Yay for being ignored. Always the best part of dining. This place is only here cause it's in a big shopping center. This place is really no good."
Sharon A.,"Orange County, CA",3,35,16,2.0,9/5/2017,"This is like the 3rd time I've had a bad experience at BJs and I'm not sure why I keep giving them another chance. This review is for the Curbside service.  Every single time I've come here, they pretty much tell me that they'll come out when they can because they're busy, which is fine but please communicate that so I'm not wondering what happened or if you forgot about us outside. If you offer Curbside, but can't handle the volume on a busy night, maybe you should stop offering it.  Just a suggestion.  I'm still sitting in my car as I write this review. I called and they said they will be out soon... about 15 mins later, I walked inside and no one was at the register, so I left again. Now I'm still waiting 30 mins later and still no service.   UPDATE - they finally came out 35 mins later and I closed my Yelp app and drove home.  This was on Sunday.   The time before this latest experience, the person who picked up the phone for Curbside actually said that they were no longer coming out and I could come inside to pick up my food if I wanted to (thanks, I guess).  It was about 8pm and the Curbside cut off is 9pm. I walked inside to get my order and there were 3 servers standing around at the register chit chatting. So they weren't busy, they were just lazy.  Not only were they lazy, my food order was wrong and things were missing from my bag... which I noticed when I got home.  The labels that they read to me had the correct food items on them, so I thought the food inside the container was correct.  It wasn't.  So disappointing.  The BJ's on Beach and Edinger might be super busy and further away from my home, but the service and communication have always been good, so next time I'll definitely make the drive out there before I come back to this location."
Heather N.,"Garden Grove, CA",122,168,164,4.0,7/19/2017,"Today my server, Karen S (as stated on the receipt), was hit and miss with my group. There were times where she was very nice and others where she gave off some bad vibes, in the manner that she spoke. I wasn't sure if it was just me but it turns out the rest of my party agreed. Other than that, the manager was awesome! He checked on us twice making sure everything was good!  My experience could have been 5 stars, but because of the bad vibes I received from time to time from my server, I docked off a star. The food was great! Everyone liked what they received (shrimp & asparagus penne, chicken club sandwich, flatbread pepperoni extreme, peanut butter & cookies n cream pizookies). The wine, on the other hand, was just disgusting. If you are adventuring into the world of alcohol, the Kim Crawford wine is just terrible and I wouldn't recommend it. Of course, this is based on preference and you might end up liking it. Just a fair warning though and it wasn't cheap! It was originally $40 but there was a 50% off wine deal making it $20, so that didn't hurt so bad. What's funny is that when my party took the bottle home, we were passing it around trying to make someone take it home because we all hated it.  I would come again. The food is great and you should check for the deals specific days and you could save some money!"
Quentina W.,"Walnut, CA",135,13,2,1.0,9/2/2017,"Worse experience here at BJs. Came here on a Friday night around 10 with my boyfriend. Waited about 10 mins to get seated, which was understandable since it is a weekend night. Took about 5 mins to order since my boyfriend and I were starving...I was HANGRY tho..  Then a party of two sat down next to us and ordered after we ordered...  About 10 minutes later the couple next to us already got all of their foods..I wasn't too furious since I did order the rib eye and my boyfriend ordered the overpriced pizza.  About 20 mins later, so total of 30 mins of waiting pretty much the serve came and checked up on us telling us he'd check the food. Waited about another 10 mins so total of 40 mins now.. the fucking food finally came.  And the pizza was just on a small ass plate that you'd give to a kid... and as for my steak..LOOOOL  they literally put like 5 steamed broccolis on the plate and literally the plate was half empty..  The server came back saying he'd give us a free dessert and when my boyfriend asked for the check, the server said ""oh did you get your dessert yet?"" Like uh no obviously lmao no point of sucking up anymore especially if the girl is hangry...  All in all, I would NOT be coming back. At least not this location."
Tony C.,"Cypress, CA",1,17,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Worst dinner experience in years. Bad enough that we won't return to this BJ's again. Been to a couple others, they were FINE. But the wait for our food was long. Steak was way over cooked, asked for a new one, never got it.  When we were all finished eating, we had to wait another 20 min to get it. The service was not good either. Manager sucked too"
Jennie L.,"Orange, CA",313,1,,3.0,8/13/2017,"*UPDATE The day after I posted my original review, the manager Anthony had reached out to me. He apologized numerously and promised that the problems I had experienced were already discussed with his team. He asked me to give the restaurant a second chance, and gave me a $50 gift card as well, wow! I did return and this experience this time was much better! We sat on the patio with Whitney, and she was great! We started with the big appetizer plate, which had a combo of 4 things. The boneless wings were definitely the star, so good! I also had a small tomato and mozzarella salad, which was amazing. So fresh and the perfect amount for a side salad, I'll probably get it every time now. We did ask for no mushrooms on our pizza, and they put mushrooms on it again, but Whitney noticed and got a new pizza in the oven ASAP, and the manager Michael came over to apologize. I was happy to see that they were acknowledging the mistake."
Laura M.,"Garden Grove, CA",103,21,13,5.0,11/25/2017,"Wow what an amazing experience we had, thanks to Barbara who was truly an amazing server. She was very friendly and connected with us on a personal level, she made us feel very welcomed. The food was amazing too! Thank you again"
Damian E.,"Orange, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/25/2017,"My Girlfriend was having a bad day, so I decided to bring her to one of her favorite places which was BJ's. I have never been to this location but it was closest to where we were at.  When we first got here we got sat down immediately, while walking to the booth she almost slipped because the floors are very slippery.  We waited for about 30 minutes, and we were finally asked to order our drinks. 15 minutes passed and we receive our drinks and then we ordered and it took approximately an hour. While we were waiting we had seen a big spider coming down onto the floor.  The waiter also had and unpleasant attitude To top it off at the end of our service we had asked for two boxes and to even get two boxes it took 20 minutes. When she finally brought the boxes she dropped off the check and took her another 30 mins to bring it back. This is probably will not probably this is the worst service that I've ever had anywhere Will not be attending any other bjs after this ."
Leilani Laisa T.,"Anaheim, CA",460,281,1456,1.0,6/14/2016,"The service here is the worst I've received in a really long time.  I mean the WORST. I couldn't even go home without stopping to tell you that you should go eat somewhere else.  I'm in my car writing this because maybe tonight someone thought of coming here but will read this review and I'll have saved that person from spending hard earned  money at this place.  Reasons why you don't come here: 1.  The hostess took our party of 2 to a table after asking for a booth. She said 'wait here and you can move there when he's done bussing.' Then took off.  Probably could have waited until it was clear to seat us instead of making us watch the busser waiting for the head nod to come sit.  2.  15 min wait for water.   3. Ordered the avocado egg rolls-another 15 min.  When it did come,  no sauce.  Asked the waitress about the sauce and she said they ran out of sauce cups so they just didn't put it on the plate.  Amazing.  15 min wait for sauce.  4.  25 min wait for 1 pizza and 1 salad.  Salad dressing was gross and the only good thing on the plate was the chicken.  Couldn't finish it.  Pizza looked weird and was dry.  Def not the quality I'm used to at BJs 5.  Ran out of water 4 times.   6. Asked for a box for pizza and salad and waited  for awhile for just a pizza box...none for salad.  7. Pizookie took another 15min and was lukewarm 8. Check came and took 15 more minutes to run it.  Our server wasn't even the one who came to collect the credit card. We could have walked out and not paid if we wanted to but we're better than that.   9. We didn't even see our server serving other tables.  What was she doing? The restaurant was moderately busy but there were three servers in our section.  One group of 20 right next to us.  They got great service! 20 people!!! (Different server) We were 2! They got shots,  refills, boxes, and the servers had time to sing happy birthday to these people.  Our server wasn't in the chorus so wtf!?  Where was this girl? Did I make her up like fight Club? Was I giving myself bad service?? Am I Bruce Willis in the sixth sense?  10. This is unrelated to the restaurant and they had no control over this but:  there was some massive car meet tonight at the block which completely clogged all roads in the parking lot in addition to city drive all the way to the 5 fwy. Racey McVapefaces were  revving their engines and cutting people off and blocking all intersections making it very difficult to even get to BJs to get the worst service of my life.   Not sure how often this car thing happens at the block but consider it a sign from the sweet baby Jesus himself that you shouldn't come eat here.   Total we spent about 2 hours to dine here.  Think of all the things you can do in two hours.   Do those things instead."
Ben T.,"Santa Ana, CA",129,14,3,5.0,11/1/2017,"So I come to this location often, tonight I was greeted by a server by the name of Liz. Already she put a smile on my face, when I asked her about the happy hour, she asked her manager if we could get the discounts even though we were sitting in the regular area. There was some slight complications with the food, she later came out and being the 5 star service she is, told us that it was on the house before we said anything at all. She was so sweet, even though she felt bad some servers will just say that and she did it again! Told us dessert was on us! Thank you for making our night Liz, it wasn't the fact that the food came off the bill, but her concern for us being customers she understands and that's all customers really want. Definitely will be coming back for her sincerity and generosity! Amazing service!!!"
Jonathan C.,"Waipahu, HI",35,1,,5.0,11/26/2017,"Great service, really catered for my son. On Black Friday was not very busy. Large portions at a reasonable price. Specialty diet pepper was delicious."
Danielle B.,"San Francisco, CA",283,96,645,4.0,12/11/2016,This review is mostly about the experience. We came here for a quick drink and snack while we were waiting to meet up with people. We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks and an appetizer. They have several beers on tap along with their own site or seven of their house brews. My wife was deciding on her drink and was taking forever as usual. The bar tender noticed her struggled and asked if he could make her something. He surveyed her likes and dislikes and came back with a concoction. She enjoyed it. The bar tender was really friendly and make good cocktails. He did the same thing for her second drink and made something completely different.  As far as the food goes we onky shared the chicken poststickers. These were decent but pricey. I think there were about 6 of them for over $10. All in all I'd stop back in for a drink or two before bearing the madness of the block.
Laurie C.,"Santa Ana, CA",89,6,1,5.0,12/25/2017,"Rafeal! I'm sorry we're posting this up late but you know, the holidays. Anyways! My husband and I just want to thank you for your AMAZING service! We've never had a bad experience at this location before but this time was just great! You have wonderful costumer service. You were on top of our meals and kept us smiling. Good job and keep up the great work! We'll be going there soon and asking for your service!"
MK M.,"Fullerton, CA",21,46,25,1.0,10/21/2017,"Our visit today was long and annoying.... my fiance and I sat in the bar to get a fast paced  lunch since we were starving. We assumed that by sitting in the bar we would get attentive fast service but we were wrong. Their  bartender today was indeed in no urge to make money nor attend customers. His high desire to high school chit chat and gossip was more important. I literally had to ask for To-go boxes twice, I had to hand held high my empty glass for a refill and in the mist of trying to close out I had to call him out on his gossip chit chat to let us pay and go. TAKE ME OUT OF HERE DUDE! ridiculous to pay for midiocure service ....i should had just cooked at home . This place needs a high school ring bell to regulate the gossip bc customer service is so neglected. I am not  returning to this Bjs ever."
Gloria W.,"Anaheim, CA",1,6,15,1.0,6/20/2017,Worst service at (any BJs you go to)!!!  My son really wanted to have dinner at BJs for some odd reason he likes a pasta dish here.  At  first I was hesitant as I had the worst experience at BJs grill in Anaheim Hills. Turns out this is by far worse than any other BJs we have been to. No silverware to begin with. I've order a drink and 24 minutes later we had to ask again where was my drink! I guess the server forgot about it! I don't like leaving bad reviews but this place deserves a negative 5 stars! I had to at least give them one star to be able to post this review. Believe me I do not thrive on leaving bad reviews but please know the service is very very bad!!!
