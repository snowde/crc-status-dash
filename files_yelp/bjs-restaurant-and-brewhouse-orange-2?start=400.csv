Michelle V.,"Anaheim, CA",136,37,27,2.0,5/16/2016,"I'm a firm believer in second chances, sometimes even 3rd ones, but oh God, this place has ruined that for me. I've been here 3 times and every time it disappoints. The first time I came was to celebrate my birthday and they took about 45 minutes to seat us (4) and took about another 45 to bring out our main dishes. Second time I came I order some shrimp pasta and the shrimp still had its shell! Third time I came which was a few days ago, I knew I had enough of this place. I really wanted to like this place but not after the service we received. We walked in to check in and the host looked so miserable, does she not know her job description? She was so unwelcoming and monotone but either way I decided to look past it. We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated and the guy that took us to our table just sat us down and was like your server will be here and walked away, he too looked like he hated his job. So finally our server comes and it's this young girl, she asks us what we'd like to drink and that was it, not once did she greet us or anything. We knew what we were going to get, which was the 2 for $25 deal. So we tell her and when she asks what pizza I had no idea that we had a choice I thought maybe it was like a preselected one, which I proceeded to ask her if it could be any and she's like well yeah, with some snippy attitude. She then walks away so we could have ""time to look at the choices"" which wasn't necessary at all because there weren't a lot to choose from. So the food comes out and what not and she comes to tell us she's going on lunch and that this other girl will no be our sever. This new girl was more positive and attentive. But that wasn't enough to shake off the sour experience I had had with our previous server. Overall the food isn't great and the service is horrible. Definitely sticking to Cheesecake Factory instead!"
Zavanna P.,"Long Beach, CA",153,40,57,1.0,5/30/2016,"Where do I begin...My husband & I came here for our friends bday dinner at 6:50pm & were told there would be a wait of 60 to 70mins to accommodate our party of 12 which was understandable. We were finally seated at 8:20 and waited for our server to take our drinks. (10-15mins for him to take our drink orders). I kindly asked for water with lemon & an iced vanilla coffee. Our drinks came 15mins later and forgot my water with lemon. No biggie, so I kindly asked again for my water with lemon and he apologized. 15 mins later my water comes, no lemon. I kindly ask him again for a lemon while he took my food order. He apologized again and said he would be back with the lemon. For reference I ordered A bowl (not bread bowl) of Clam Chowder and fish and chips and my husband ordered a medium rare hamburger. 2 servers from the kitchen I believe come and hand out everyone's soup or salads but the order was semi mixed up. My friend had ordered a bowl of clam chowder as well as I but the servers had a bread bowl clam chowder and a bowl of clam chowder. My friend and I told them we both ordered a bowl not a bread bowl. They offered the bread bowl to either of us no up charge so my friend took it since I didn't want bread. Mix up not so bad, it happens. As I lift the spoon off my bowl I see black and brown crusty stuff on it. GROSS. I flag the waiter and he doesn't see me. I try calling for him but no luck with all the noise going on a saturday night. Waiter disappears so I patiently wait while everyone enjoys their soup or salad. 15mins pass and our waiter finally shows up and I finally get his attention. I ask him for another spoon and show him the crud on mine and he apologizes and says he would get me another one. Again I sit and wait and still no waiter. 15 mins pass and my friend flags down another waiter/server and says ""Excuse me, i'm sorry I know your not our waiter but my friend has been waiting for a spoon because the one that came with her soup had stuff on it and our waiter hasn't came back yet. All our friends are already done with their soups and salad.""  The waiter/server looks at me and says he will get me a new spoon. Before he leaves I kindly ask him ""Also, is there any way I can get my soup warmed up? Its been sitting here and has cooled down."" He looks at me annoyed and rudely says ( I SWEAR ON MY CHILDREN!) ""Sure I can warm it for you, actually do you want it like really really hot? I can make it really hot for you! Actually I'll just get you a new bowl and i'll make sure it's really hot for you! Do you want it really hot?"" I looked at him like wait, what? Was he trying to be funny or plain rude? I laugh a little and tell him ""Well no I dont want it really hot I just wanted it warmed up because it cooled down while waiting for a spoon."" He says ok and leaves. 10 minutes later he comes back with my bowl and says to me in a smart ass tone ""Here you go, is that hot enough for you? If not i'll take it back and make it super hot for you if you want. Try it and let me know if it's hot enough for you I mean thats what you want."" By this time I was fed up and just told him ""No its fine thanks."" I LITERALLY look at my husband and said ""I hope to GOD my entree doesn't come out because I barely get my soup to eat!"" 2 spoons later of soup guess what arrives...my ENTREE. I was irritated at this point. My husband tells me we will just pack up the soup to take home so I can eat my entree. Next thing you know my friend next to me flags down our waiter and asked if his meal came with 2 sides. Waiter says yes it does, my friend says he only has 1 side on plate and that the mashed potatoes were missing. The waiter apologized and went to get him his missing mashed potato. I slice into my fish & chips and guess what, the batter was soft and soggy, and the fish was wet and bland. I literally shook so much pepper and salt on it and STILL it was bland. No taste at all. 1 bite was all it took. I ate a few of the fries that were fine and pushed my meal aside. I had lost my appetite. My husband offered to share his burger with me since it was cut in half and I said no thanks. He took his first bite of the burger and was disappointed. The patty was well done, over cooked, AND dry. He was so hungry since his last meal was breakfast and he works on the weekends and barely has time for lunch breaks, that he ate half the burger then shoved the rest. He told me he didn't enjoy it at all but that he was so hungry he had to bare it. By this time we were all highly disappointed in the service and our meal. Our bday friend was the one whose side was missing from his meal. We joked about how come the first half of our table had great service and great food but the rest of us at the end of the table including the bday boy had bad service and bad food. My friend didn't even want to wait for his bday pizookie because he was just over the whole situation. We made him stay and said at least we know the pizookie has to be good! Left @ 10:20pm!"
Jesus H.,"Long Beach, CA",11,5,,4.0,5/2/2015,"The staff is friendly and inviting. Despite them hitting hit with a rush right as we got here, we did not have to wait very long for them to take our order. We got the wings and one of their new burgers, the guac one.  The food was better than to be expected from a chain for sure. I would not recommend their Blond Lager though."
Justin B.,"Anaheim, CA",216,5,7,1.0,1/1/2015,"Good atmosphere and but when I got my food I was sadly mistaken about this BJs. I ordered a medium house top sirloin for 14$ and received a tiny well done steak with a bunch of fries and some room temperature broccoli. The server was good, but I had to sit for a good 10-15mins for another steak. It was an absolutely terrible steak. I don't need to complain about a steak to get a better one the second time."
Steponme L.,"Anaheim, CA",48,10,,5.0,3/5/2016,"Thanks to the awesome bartenders for making my visit worth it.  I started out with a Jeremiah Red and also ordered a mini cheese pizza and then fried artichokes.  Then I had another Red to finish up.  The house beer, Jeremiah Red, is a fantastic 7.3% ABV so it did the job of getting me nice and buzzed.  I will for sure be back here for more Friday drink sessions.  I loved it."
Cynthia B.,"Santa Ana, CA",66,12,1,5.0,10/24/2015,Maria G. was awesome. She was super nice and fast and she definitely knows how a customer wants to be treated. This bjs is my personal favorite bjs. I've always had great service at the particular location.
Cassandra G.,"Buena Park, CA",179,17,14,5.0,3/24/2016,This was my first time eating at BJ's.  We came as a group of 12 people.  Our server was amazing handling such a big group (plus 4 kids).  We all came in separately and he was very quick to greet them and ask them what they would like to drink. He recommended the salmon and it was amazing.  I would definitely be coming here again.
Fancy N.,"San Francisco, CA",175,132,47,1.0,5/28/2016,"Came here for lunch and I swear every BJ's we've been to has such poor service and the quality of their food is down the drain. Ordered a half sandwich (chicken club with extra lettuce and tomatoes) and a Caesar salad and my order didn't come with extra lettuce and tomatoes. Had to ask for it the second time. When our server finally brought it, the bottom of the lettuce looked as though it had a bunch of dirt on it or looked as thought they plucked it off an old hamburger patty. It was disgusting. Left it on the plate for the server. My sandwich also had avocados in it, but with a huge chunk of the skin in my sandwich. Also left that on the plate for the server. I have been to BJ's in Roseville, Elk Grove, natomas, San Diego, and this location, and they fail every time! Every time! This place needs to have the owners rethink everything out. Service should be started with. Never again will I spend money here. Never."
Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1070,875,388,3.0,8/3/2013,"Brand new location right across from the OC Animal Care shelter. Looks like your typical BJs. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who asked us if we were Premier Rewards members and I said no. I asked her what that was but she totally ignored my question. I say ignored because I was standing right in front of her when I asked.  Then we were led to a two-person booth, but it was one of those that was right in front of the kitchen and one seat was just a chair. Why would you take us there when we just passed about 4 perfectly nice, regular booths and the restaurant is practically empty? Our server was nice and told us about the program, our pizza came out kind of just warm. It was not hot. Our BBQ chicken salad was still overdressed even after we asked for lighter dressing. It maybe it was. Staff was nice and kept checking up to clear plates and refill drinks.  The location at the Block near the freeway is definitely convenient."
Kathy N.,"Orange, CA",3,6,52,2.0,3/14/2015,The bf did NOT want to come here due to horrible service the last time we were here... Service was good this time but the food not so good.  2.5 stars it is. Not sure we will be back.
Cynthia A.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,8,,5.0,3/6/2015,"Wow, service here is one in a million! The servers are so courteous and social (not the annoying kind!). I love their deep-dish lasagna, so tasty and cooked just right, not too dry or soggy. I've never felt so eager to tip someone after my experience here. Definitely recommend the peanut butter and smores pizookie!! Try it damn it!"
P S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",20,53,25,1.0,12/2/2015,Terrible experience here. Took our waiter FOREVER to take our order. The manager was EXTREMELY rude. I'm super disappointed in this location. We frequent Bjs multiple times a month and we will not be back due to the Manager.
Stephanie F.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,6,2,1.0,2/21/2016,Came here tonight for a birthday dinner and found service was terrible. Servers seemed annoyed and unhappy to help out customers. Food came out cold and change for the bill literally took 45 minutes.
Ileana G.,"Downey, CA",1,59,7,5.0,9/27/2015,I went here on Friday and oh my goodness the 2 for 25 is a wonderful deal! We had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table but I loved the outside patio and our server was super generous and sweet. Food was delicious and it was my first time eating a pazooki!! :) I would deff come back. Just one thing I notice is that the manager looks bitchy she didn't really say much when she took us to our table.
Steph H.,"Long Beach, CA",248,1692,1985,3.0,7/21/2014,"This just happened to be a convenient place to meet up with a friend--I definitely knew what I was in for: crowds, noise, and so-so food. As such, it served its purpose. I got the fish and chips and a beer; my friend just got a pepperoni deep dish. It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible--it was A-OK. Our server was super-nice though, and all in all it was perfectly fine. Sometimes you may find yourself at these kinds of establishments and there's no need to fear the reaper here."
Shannon P.,"Lake Forest, CA",49,4,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Not recommended for larger groups at lunch on weekdays. We had a group of about 10 for a work birthday lunch during the week. Once we ordered it took a long time just to get our drinks. We ordered our food at the same time we ordered drinks and asked for our bill, so we could make sure to get out on time. We didn't get our food until about 45 minutes later and two of us didn't even get our food then. We still hadn't got our bill at this point either despite asking for it multiple times. Finally one more meal came with just enough time to eat the main part quickly and grab a handful of fries to eat on the way out. The other meal never came, so one co-worker didn't get lunch. They took it off the bill, of course, but she had to go back to work hungry. We finally got our bill and rushed out. We didn't even get to sing happy birthday or get a birthday pazookie, which I asked for in the very beginning when we ordered drinks and food. It was a stressful bad experience. We will not be celebrating there again."
T. N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,18,15,4.0,2/16/2016,"Love the ambience and food here. Hip, clean and good choice of food and drinks. Only gripe is we sat at the bar area and our server hardly came over to ask what we needed. Other than that I'm a regular here. Love the seared ahi tuna salad"
Jonathan Y.,"Monterey, CA",3,25,4,5.0,5/1/2015,Just had the most pleasant experience I've had in awhile at Bj's. Christophe A. was a delight and gave much more than the average banter of the usual waiters/waitresses. I always love coming here anyway but he definitely made me want to come back again very soon. Food was 10/10 per usual.
Ron M.,"Camarillo, CA",3,65,5,2.0,11/21/2014,Nothing special Super crowded Friday evening Servers couldn't get our order correct  Best part was the carnitas fries appetizer  Wretched service and food for most places but par for the course for a BJs.   I'm not sure if I would come back if I had a choice of somewhere else.
Jesus M.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,14,4,5.0,2/12/2016,Went in for a pick up. A little mishap happened with a transaction that I didn't realize till hours later but I had the pleasure of speaking with Michael who assisted me making sure I was taken care of.  Also had another manager who I can't seem to remember his name. A light skinned Latino(awesome guy too) who made sure I felt at home. Great management to say the least.
