Kevin Bobby N.,"Orange County, CA",385,84,32,4.0,11/19/2013,"I'm really feelin' the vibe here at this particular BJ's. It's dim lit, and the bar is impressively illuminated. It also has a cool spinning door too! Looks like a fine dining restaurant, but still casual; very urban. I ordered the enLIGHTened Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. It was extremely light as advertised. A perfect way to start my new dieting changes. Also very tasty if I may add. I highly recommend this BJ's."
Jaye H.,"Santa Ana, CA",89,48,27,4.0,8/18/2014,"Brought my little sister here for her first Pizookie. One word, Foodgasm!  My favorite is the original chocolate chunk pizookie but the other flavors are pretty good as well. The servers here are nice and very quick with the orders. Parking is great if you get here when they aren't too busy, otherwise you may have to park closer to the mall."
Madison B.,"Garden Grove, CA",50,8,6,3.0,9/19/2016,"Usually I get excellent service when I go to this BJ's. However, we went for football Sunday since they advertised they were playing the games. We sat in a relatively empty area (there were only about 3 or 4 other tables filled around us). The server was polite, but really kept trying to push us out of there. We were only there for the 4th quarter of the game, so for about an hour. We ordered plenty (drinks, appetizers, entrees) but the server kept trying to rush our check. At one point, whenever we looked down from the TV we saw her in the waitress booth just staring at us. If the place was packed, then I would get it, but there were plenty of open tables around us. All in all, good food, but definitely do not recommend to watch any games there."
Sarah C.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,11,,5.0,9/4/2015,I have never had a bad experience here. Dale is a fantastic bartender. Me and my boyfriend go in at least once a week since we usually work later and bjs food is served later then most restaurants. Dale is usually working which is cool to see a familiar face and the one time he wasn't Wendy was our bartender and she was attentive to us and was fun. Whenever I have eaten in the dining area the servers are always great. We're still waiting for you to visit us at work Dale!
Andrea M.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,7,5,1.0,11/7/2015,"Apparently it takes a 45 minute wait plus a talk to the manager to cancel our order to have ANYTHING brought out. Seriously horrible service, our appetizers should've at least been brought out before then. Can't say I'll be coming back."
Jackie W.,"Orange, CA",223,433,243,3.0,10/7/2013,"First off, this place is new so I think they're still working out some of their kinks. Parking was really bad right off the bat (even for those of us with disabled placards).  I went for happy hour after work one day to find absolutely no place to sit in the bar for the group of 6 I was meeting. Not much changed after almost an hour so we put our names in for a table. They told us it would be about 30 minutes. Go forward to over an hour later and we finally got a table (after we asked and they had one open they just hadn't given us). Our server Tyson was great though. Very patient with our indecisive group. The food was good and so were the drinks. I think we went on one of the busiest nights of the week with two sporting events on TV so I'll keep that in mind next time."
Temenah C.,"Anaheim, CA",393,1040,3,1.0,6/22/2014,"I wasn't planning on writing a review for BJ's because I figure you been to one, you been to them all. However, my experience here made me sit down and write a review because the service was something else. We were a party of 6, 4 adults and 2 children, but 2 of us arrived first. I told the hostess that there would be 6 total, 4 adults and 2 children. There were 3 people standing behind the hostess desk and apparently the request to seat 4 adults and 2 children was a lot to handle. They just looked at each other like they had never heard of such a mixed group. There was another party that was behind us so the hostess told us, ""move to the side there are people behind you."" Ummmm ok. So they finally take us to a table and give us 6 regular menus. Again, I said there will be 4 adults and 2 children. Does this type of request not happen much? Our server came by and we asked for waters while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. They must have gone all the way to a sacred spring for this water because it took forever to get to us. We ordered our drinks and when the server brought them over he couldn't tell the difference between 2 of them. At this point, I'm thinking, ""you're kidding me"". We started with appetizers, but were never brought plates to share or napkins or silverware. Apparently this was Medieval Times and we were supposed to use our hands and perhaps, our feet. When we asked for plates and napkins and silverware, they had to scramble to find us stuff. I mean, they literally brought 2 plates and napkin sets at a time. When all of our food finally arrived, they forgot one dish and the server couldn't even remember what it was. Also, my friend's shrimp tacos were a little cold and when the runner brought the food out he didn't know and couldn't identify what we ordered. This happened, ""Uhhhh this is pizza with pesto orrrr something"". It actually wasn't.  So here's the deal. I normally don't have an issue with BJ's. It is what it is. This location though, I'd go to one of the other restaurants in The Block. Oh, the pizzookie was good."
Ryan S.,"Paris, France",18,6,1,1.0,7/14/2015,Was looking to have dessert/pizooki. Would not seat us 30 minutes before closing. Terrible host and rude service so we left.
James B.,"Westminster, CA",22,14,,1.0,9/20/2014,"Came to BJ's tonight for my birthday. Had a bad experience with our service. Jonathan was our server, and took forever to get us food or beverages. Then we had no plates for dinner and had to remind our server twice to three times for an item. Dont think we will come back."
Llanel F.,"La Mirada, CA",3,17,,5.0,2/1/2016,"We were celebrating my husband's work promotion with family. We were a little worried before as we had received bad customer service here previously. However, Joseph P was an outstanding server! He was attentive and great with our kids! If you go to BJ's at the block, then get him as your server. Joseph P had recently transferred from the Brea location. Way to go Joseph P!!!"
Ryan L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",142,14,3,1.0,7/14/2015,"Walked in with a group of ten half an hour before closing only looking for dessert. Was turned away because ""they had already started closing"". Very rude and would not come to this location again. If you don't want to serve past 12 then don't advertise as open"
Chelsea S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",28,68,86,1.0,8/1/2015,"Very disappointed with the service at this specific location, been here 4 times since its been open and always have an issue weather it be the food quality or the service. I love BJ'S restaurant and the brand and have alway tried to let this location prove me wrong as far as the service, and unfortunately this location always fall sort of my expectations. I had to remind my server 2 times after I received my entire for the salad and appetizer I never received. Receiving my salad and appetizer after my meal defeats the purpose of an appetizer. On top of that my BJS REWARDS number was given to the server and was never inputed. I would assume that a restaurant with such a program would at least train their associates on how to add the rewards number to the check."
George D.,"Orange, CA",29,4,3,5.0,9/10/2016,"Excellent service, pleasant atmosphere! Our waitress, Tara was the best I have came across in a long while. Very attentive and great customer service. My brother and I enjoyed every minute. Tara shows all of what BJ's is all about."
Francisco V.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,32,52,4.0,2/19/2016,"Went here for an early dinner on Valentine's day. Our server was nice and gave us fast service always checking if we needed anything. Food was excellent as expected. Pretty sure the only reason it was a good experience, is because people from Corporation was monitoring staff and service that day."
Andria M.,"Orange, CA",53,6,,4.0,3/10/2016,"Ok so let me start by saying the food was on point and the beer was frosty and delicious. However, they need to figure out what is going on in the kitchen as far as timeing. I can only imagine that it was because we went in during shift change however...really, all we orderd we salads and appetizers. Get it together kitchen...if you need help let me known id be happy to show you how its done."
Aden J.,"Detroit, MI",31,172,,2.0,12/1/2014,"On the way into this BJs, there was a sign in front of the entrance that read, 'Tailgate Happy Hour: Dining Room, Bar, and Patio, 2 Hours before Game'. My party of four goes in, and we ask to double check if happy hour is available in the dining room. It is 6 pm and the Ducks vs. Bruins game going on down the street begins in an hour. FIVE HOSTESSES tell us that happy hour is only available outside or at the bar. One of my friends, having just seen the sign, asks again if happy hour is available in the dining area. Again, FIVE hostesses tell us that 'HH' is just in the bar or outside. Our party decides not to the press the issue, and sits at the bar. We ask our waiter at the bar if tailgate happy hour is going on in the dining room. He says it is going on the whole restaurant. We decide to just sit at the bar because the server at least understand that tailgate happy hour was going on throughout the restaurant. The male server who helps our table at the bar is very nice and prompt, and so is the female server who takes over for him when he goes on his dinner break. Three times other servers bring food to our table that is for the table next to us. They're nice though even with whatever communication problem is going on. The food and drinks are all fine. This BJ's clearly has some organizational issues if five hostesses are telling customers that tailgate happy hour is not going on in the dining room when a sign says that it is and the servers at the bar (doing their job) are also aware of this."
Chanel N.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",329,25,19,1.0,8/22/2015,"Waiter was fine, establishment is disgusting. Poor service from hostess (how is that even possible?). The second we sat down we probably should have left - the table was wet and sticky, our menus were disgusting and sticky as well. Mine had some cheese crumbles stuck in it. BELIEVE the reviews and don't waste your time coming here. I love BJ's restaurants usually and have generally found a level of consistency and good food. Not here. Food isn't on par, it's dirty.. Bleh. I'll listen to Yelp reviews next time. Expected more from a BJ'S in Orange."
Julia R.,"Fullerton, CA",173,8,3,5.0,9/18/2015,They said it was a 30 min wait and we got called 50 mins later. What I really didn't like was the party before us  was  called first. Iam pregant and with a four year old Daugther. Not acceptable. But  the manager names Louis made us feel every great!! He apologized for such a long wait and requested for us to have desert on the house twice. The lady who serves us was such a sweat heart her name I believe was Marlena. The food was very good as well/ like the manager said we want to make sure you leave happy today. He made the night and we left very happy. Those are the type of people you need as managers.
Amanda A.,"Los Alamitos, CA",63,15,13,2.0,6/29/2015,"Stopped in for a quick early dinner with my sister after our mom's surgery. When we first walked thru the door, the hostess told us she would seat us shortly and told us to stand aside. We stood there for awhile, long enough for me to think that we might just go sit in the bar area.  Once we were seated, we sat and waited awhile for a waitress to take our drink orders. She took our orders and before coming back with the drinks, came back with another waitress amd said, "" i'm getting off eight now and coco will be taking over"". For the next hour we continued to see our original waitress servong other tables. Got our drinks amd ordered a small pizza for the 2 of us..seemed to have taken quite awhile to get our food. The pizza was good, a little heavy on the onions but good,  and the guy who brought out the pizza was nice and quick to bring us out cups of ranch. Once we finished our pizza we wanted dessert. The waitress comes by and asked if we would like to pay..we said we want a pazookie. And she says ok what kind. Never offered a menu to help choose and its odd for a server not to ask if you want dessert, especially at a place with a signature dish. We got the cookies and cream and it was quite tasty. Paid the bill in cash at the table and walked out...not even a have a good night or anything from the hostess. In conclusion, it  took over an hour and a half to get a small pizza and a pizookie. Poor customer service from hostess amd waitresses. Busboys and food servers were nice and efficient."
Victoria N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",514,142,493,4.0,7/15/2014,"Omg salted caramel pizookie is so good! There's pretzel in the middle! Perfect combination of sweet and salty. I usually come here for drinks because they have the pearl cocktail onions that I can garnish with my dirty martini. Also love that they have a small bites menu so I usually get the caprese salad for only $3.50, good to munch on. I'm not big on these chain restaurants but this has to be one of my favorites in terms of drinks/food they have to offer. It's also conveniently located off of the freeway exit so it's a quick and easy stop. Sit at the bar and you don't have to wait for a table."
