Eve L.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2015,"Today is my birthday and our family decided on BJ'S for lunch. It took about 10 minutes to be seated which was fine since we were a party of 9. Our waitress took our drink order, brought the drinks, put in our food order, then went home for the day and left us with another waitress. When they started bringing out the food we noticed our orders were all wrong. My nephews had ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with sides and were only brought small bowls of macaroni and cheese. When we let them know their order was wrong, she took away the mac and cheese and the kids didn't receive their food until we were more than halfway through our meals. My little niece never received her fruit side. Half of us ordered burgers and ordered them medium, when they got to us however they were burnt and dried out. My husband and my mother in law received the wrong burgers. They were dry with no sauces, as they were described in the menu. Our waitress came by twice in the beginning and that was it. We did not receive any refills so all of our drinks were gone by the middle of our meals. Overall I was very disappointed. Being my birthday lunch I wanted it to go well and it was the worst service I've ever experienced at a BJ'S restaurant. I definitely will not be returning to this one. Update: I emailed the BJ's employee who had commented on my review over 2 weeks ago and have yet to see an email in response."
Luis F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",32,6,4,2.0,4/9/2016,"I haven't been dissapointed twice in a row when dining out. I came to dine at this location last night and was excited to dig in on a chicken Alfredo plate. When my meal came out the pasta was under cook and hard. I informed the waiter and he called over the manager. The manager politely apologized and reassured me she would speak to the cook. The waiter asked me if I would like something else, since the manager reassured me, I ordered the same dish. My second dish came out and  to my surprise the pasta was under cook. The waiter apologetic informed me I wasn't the only table that received under cooked pasta. Yay? The manger didn't apologize a second time nor check up on us. I assumed she was busy apologizing to the other customers with under cook pasta.  I guess the waiter also lost hope in me because he didn't offer me a third try in ordering a dish so I left hungry. Good thing for Carl's Jr being next to this location."
Riley P.,"Sunrise, FL",95,31,1,4.0,1/20/2016,"ALWAYS BUSY. If you don't have a reservation you're not going to eat for at least 45 minutes. But if you're willing to wait, try the salmon. It's amazing! Wait staff is always friendly despite being so busy."
Rob R.,"Boise, ID",1,218,5,3.0,6/28/2014,"Been here three times since they opened and it's been a mixed bag.  First time, ordered the corn fritter app. They came to the table a little cold. Tried to cut one, but they were so undercooked, the mushy dough just squirted out like warm butter. When the waiter came back, they said that's the way they cook them here. Uhh, no. The oil wasn't hot enough and they were severely undercooked. They offered another, but it had taken so long to get the first round, I passed. Food took a long time to come out. The wait staff tried to keep our glasses full, but we wanted food. It was busy, but they were well staffed - at least on the floor.  Second time, got seated right away. Drinks and app came out fast. Food followed and everything was on point. It wasn't busy though. Third time, drinks came right away, but after that things slowed way down. They did get the corn fritters right this time. Nice and crispy outside, light and fluffy inside. Food took awhile to come out, but it's usually done right.  Bottom line, this location is inconsistent for service and food quality. Sometimes it's fast and on point. Sometimes is sloooooooooow and the food is off.  We knew one of the waiters, and he told us he was quitting because the managers are impossible to please."
Sara L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",264,6,7,4.0,12/24/2015,I recommend the sailor Jerry black cherry soda! Strong & delicious! Toni was a great server!
Danh N.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,3,,3.0,8/30/2014,"We ordered 2 pizzas but then when they came out, they were still doughy a little bit and undercooked so we called the manager and he gave us another 2 pizzas. My cousin ordered a dish of spaghetti with scallopbut  as she ate it, the pasta tasted like it was overcooked.  I gave it 3 stars because of 2 reasons: - the manager always presented after the pizza incident and he always checked on us every 10 or 15 minutes.  - We all have food orgams with the Pazookie. It was like you are living in heaven"
Sandra W.,"Goodyear, AZ",3,2,,5.0,9/6/2015,Came to to eat a fabulous Pazookie after the Disney run! Had a great waitress kiki!!! Love this place!
Melissa M.,"Boise, ID",1,17,8,1.0,10/17/2016,"I love BJs but not on this trip. In town for a girls weekend. Arrived at close to 8pm and were told it would be about a 30-40 minute wait. 50 minutes later we are called back and table hoped for about 5 minutes while looking for a table that either was bussed or didn't have sticky something underneath. I ordered the soup and a baked potato, then went back and changed my soup order to which she went right back to make the change. When the soup came out it was the original one I ordered. When I said I'd take it since I didn't want it to go to waste the server looked relieved and agreed apatheticly. The food is usually good but tonight the service was the biggest issue. I don't COMPLETELY blame the waiters, servers, and hostesses, although I think they could have done a better job at handling the situation. I'd say the management could do better at streamlining and teaching staff to cater to customers better."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,5/10/2014,"It was pretty empty which was a surprise for a 12.30 Saturday lunch, but I guess there are just so many options in the area and BJ's isn't exactly new or exciting. For starters, none of us drink so the brews are not all that enticing. The menu, a big notebook should have been the indicator that if you offer that much it can't all be good. We had the perfect beginnings, sliders and wontons to start. Meh. Nothing disgusting, nothing worth eating again. At the table we had the ribs (too soft, tasted fake and precooked) Deep dish and hand tossed pizzas (pale, too much crust, no sauce, dry, toppings cut so thin I could not taste anything on any of the 3 pizzas) I had the salmon, salty, tasted like out of a can, with couscous, which was little noodle balls, nothing grainy or healthy at all with veggies, really really bad. I wasn't paying but this wasn't even worth one dollar or calorie. BJ's you're right there with TJIF, Chili's and all that other straight garbage!"
Emmett B.,"Placentia, CA",23,29,18,5.0,1/14/2016,"This is my ""go to"" spot to just chill and post up at the Bar. 2 of my Fav bartenders of ""All Times!"" Work here. They welcomed me with open arms with great service, superior attitudes, and did I mention fabulous drinks! They always conversate even when they are super busy but customers never wait long at all for anything, not that hella cool! Love this place to unwind and kick it a bit. Appetizers are better here than the other BJ's I've gone to around OC."
Chau T.,"Garden Grove, CA",252,33,57,3.0,5/24/2015,"This BJ's location is okay, it's a hit and miss for me sometimes. Sometimes there's great or terrible servers. You'll get great service or you'll be forgotten! So they need to step it up! I would also say the food is very hit and miss as well. Very inconsistent with their quality food. I just come by for happy hour and get a pizza. I was very disappointed when they took away the red velvet pizookie!! That was one of their best flavors... but yeah nothing to brag about this place, it's just a place to dine every now and then."
Angel G.,"Santa Ana, CA",20,39,14,5.0,7/28/2015,Brian took care of us tonight. He had the perfect drink recommendation and was really quick with our orders. LOVE THE PAZOOKIE!
Laila R.,"Anaheim, CA",132,45,20,5.0,10/15/2015,"There are not words. This place consistently delivers quality, convenience, cleanliness and a chill vibe. The waiters, waitress's, host's and the two different managers that have reigned for the past few years, know what they're doing. They know customer service and they make it an art. They have beer tastings which Steven and I LOVE. We learn a lot every time we go. We go away happy, warm and well fed. The salads are filling & good the next day. Pizza is phenomenal and the beer is refreshing and brewed in house. We have a card that accumulated points and so on top of all of this, we often get a free desert! Happy hour IS a happy hour with good deals on food people actually eat. (Not stale taco shells and crummy drinks) The mini barbeque pizza is enough for me to easily get two meals out of. I'd eat here everyday if I could."
Rianna B.,"Fontana, CA",57,7,3,1.0,7/31/2016,"No stars. So, my date and I could not wait to get off for happy hour. True enough we get in at 640pm.....happy hour ends at 7pm. I walked around for bar seating their wasn't any but what I found was ALOT OF TRANSIT seating. So upsetting"
A.j. M.,"Orange, CA",62,4,1,5.0,8/27/2015,I had an amazing experience with our server Liz Jimenez .   For being opening hours she was on point.  I would definitely come back to this location.  Thanks for great service!!!
Joe F.,"Placentia, CA",188,266,896,1.0,7/10/2014,"Man this BJ's needs to get it together. Hints that this night would be a mess were present right from the start. The hostess was calling out the wrong names (don't know why they are calling names when they have out pagers) Then a dad and son came up with lite buzzer and they took it and said ""oh sort we gave you the wrong one"" and gave them another one and sent them away. Kinda messed up. We sat down and right away we got new server, turned out we got the one that does laps but doesn't bring refills or remembers your drinks. It was a complete pain to get his attention to try and get even our water refilled.  So our spin dip arrives, they just forgot the flavor with it. We get this as a staple at BJ's and this one just lacked salt and flavor, we were seasoning our own food. The app went and again we were wishing our server would come by for any kind of refill.  On to entrées. Again messed up, my wife's gluten free pizza had extra white onions that she didn't order and was missing the artichokes she had asked for, but she was willing to live with it. (They still charged us on the bill for them, unreal) My dish was all kinds of lack of caring. I had for the honey lemon scallops. The scallops were over cooked on one side, rubbery and bland. The asparagus is limp and lame. The rice was as if it came off the bottom the of the pan, it was dried our hard and clumped together... And you guessed it missing the flavoring honey-lemon flavoring.  We got the manager, he could obviously see that my dish was a careless, rushed failure.  He offered a refire, which I took because I was starving and it wasn't a big dish to begin with. It took another 10 mins and wow what a difference, scallops looked better, asparagus was better, rice was flavored but under cooked (at least it wasn't a solid bunch of rock hard rice). I'll never be back to this location, they over charged, lacked any sort for lack of a better word...caring. No credit for two messed up dishes or lack of service. Get it together for the sake of those who will be back."
Ralph C.,"Signal Hill, CA",43,191,2,4.0,11/5/2014,I have been here several times now and have not had a problem. Service has usually been very good and I love their pizza. Although I wish they had a little more sauce on the crust. I will come back again!
Karly W.,"Garden Grove, CA",197,83,43,4.0,7/9/2015,"My girlfriend & I went here the other night for a late night dinner with our boyfriends. Service was great, but something really unfortunate happened. The server that brought my girlfriend's food dropped her burger when he was placing her plate down. They cleaned it up really quick & brought out another burger. The manager came out & apologized to our table & we got a free pizookie (: & took off her burger from the bill. They handled it extremely well & I just want to say thank you! Things like this do happen, & I thought they did a really great job handling this situation (:"
Mario P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,17,5,4.0,8/29/2015,"Idk about others people opinion on bjs customer service but I never had an issue coming here. I have to say their menu selection is pretty large which makes deciding on what to eat more difficult but buffalo chicken pizza is my personal favorite as a main dish and my girlfriend and I usually split their chile verde fries which are extremely tasty for this place not being anything close to a ""Mexican"" style restaurant. And the pizzookies are an awesome dessert to share!"
Becca H.,"Lake Forest, CA",72,201,131,3.0,9/21/2014,My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday for some drinks and good with another couple. The wait was only about 10 minutes- we went to the bar and grabbed a beer. The service at the bar was great- very friendly and attentive right away to us. We got seated maybe 5 minutes after- once we were seated no body came to check on us till about 15 minutes after !! I had to personally ask a server if we were going to be helped. They looked confused did some side chatter and finally decided who it would be to take care of us. He was very pleasant- but maybe the hostess ladies need to communicate it better with the server before we get seated and way 15 minutes to be attended to...  Food is great as always- I love the variety they have. I got the Mediterranean tacos- very good. We shared some appetizers as well. This place would definitely be at 4-5 star joint if they could get their service together.
