Shah M.,"Orange, CA",15,60,8,3.0,6/6/2015,I don't know how to put it in words nothing was wrong per say but it just didn't add up to a better rating than 3 stars.
Robert M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",7,16,64,4.0,12/16/2014,Great place great food..I always tend to go for the Jeremiah Red! By far my favorite..food is bomb
Cygnet N.,"Laguna Hills, CA",18,17,2,2.0,4/6/2016,"I tried to calling in twice for pick up order, no one picked up, so I went online to try the online pick up... I ordered what I thought was a chicken Caesar salad online for pick up.  When I arrived to pick up my food, there was no chicken on it. The cashier said it does not come with chicken and I have to add it. I told her I thought it came with chicken, because online it shows a picture of a chicken Caesar salad and I selected it. I asked for chicken, and it was about 5 bucks  in addition to the 11 dollar salad. She stuck her head into the kitchen, and brought it out right away, which means the chicken isn't cooked when ordered...The chicken wasn't even sliced for my salad.  I paid 16 bucks for a chicken Caesar salad that wasn't prepared fresh.  I'm mostly dissatisfied that the online photo depicts a picture of a Chicken Caesar salad, but does not come with chicken.. in which wastes everyone's time.  BJ's should update the website and photos to depict the actual entrees and food items. I paid over 16 bucks for lettuce, croutons and a chicken breast.  I guess lunch prices are different online.  Maybe this complaint is more at a corporate level, but the employee wasn't responsive when I showed her that its a chicken Caesar salad online... She just told me to add chicken for 5 more bucks... aside from that, the salad isn't prepared fresh... that's a no-no for a 16 dollar salad. I wish I could post the online menu...."
Corrine G.,"Huntington Park, CA",110,24,8,1.0,4/9/2014,"So here's my update! My previous review was left right after we were told that we couldn't be seated promptly as another 7 person party came in and bjs gave our table away. We had to wait a half hour by the way! Point of making the reservation??... none. Ugh!  Anyways my friend and I ordered small bites Corn Fritters with Bacon Aoli which, SHOCK! Did not come with my Aoli! How do you miss a pertinent part of the dish!? My friends side of fries was one of the first things ordered, and came out right before dessert.... they are fries for godsake! Luckily our small great white pizza order was delicious along with our pizooki and avocado egg rolls. Yummmm. To add, our water cups were empty for a half hour.. twice. *rolls eyes* and yes we reminded our server on more than several occassions. She was just on the borderline of nice and meh, didn't seem like she liked her job very much.   Needless to say I won't be giving my business to  this particular bjs anymore unless they decide to switch out their mgmt and staff to one that can provide better customer service. .. Rant End."
Joseph Z.,"Anaheim, CA",91,19,4,1.0,7/17/2015,"Avoid eating here at all cost. Went with a party of 9 the hostess looked at us and told us that they weren't seating anymore big parties it was about a hour before closing we got there, when we asked if we could split out party so it could work out for them and we could eat she said no and proceed to ignore us. Terrible service and no management to be found not recommended this place to family rather drive to the one in Brea."
Michelle M.,"Irvine, CA",1220,350,2397,3.0,3/31/2014,"I have 2 words for you - PIZOOKIE TRIO.  Although the trio comes in smaller portions, you get to try 3 different kinds of pizookie flavors.  Chocolate chip, white chocolate macadamia nut and my FAVORITE one of all - the SALTED CARAMEL.  I cannot even BEGIN to express how good the salted caramel was - the perfect balance of Vanilla bean ice cream sweetness paired with the warm chewy cookie with just a hint of salt...Mmmmm.... As soon as the dessert came out, I seriously ""CLAIMED"" the whole platter (Think Darryl Dixon ""claim"" from The Walking Dead).  So sorry for the rest of my group who didn't get a chance to try it ... He he. THE 'TUDE: Service here was excellent!  Our wait time was almost about an hour, but there really wasn't any other restaurant at The Block on a Friday night that had less of a wait time.  The good thing about our wait was that a waitress walked around with free mini pizzas and gave them out for free!! Thanks for holding me over :) Our waitress was friendly and was on point with bringing out our food items and checking on us.  Our waters were refilled and our plates were cleared out before our dessert came out. THE MOOD: It was a Friday when my group and I went and it was BUSY - SUPER BUSY!  The parking was hard to find and the wait can get quite long.  But, if you can get past the hunt for a parking spot and wait time, this is a good place to unwind with friends after a long week or day. THE FOOD: The food was greasy goodness - I got the deep dish pizza and the cheese, sausages, and veggies were all melt in your mouth goodness.  But the PIZOOKIE TRIO - I won't get into it again...but that alone will make me come back here again :)"
Rosario B.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,2,,1.0,7/12/2015,"Waited for 15 minutes after our pizza arrived to get utensils, the ranch, red crushed pepper we asked for (at the time of ordering). By the time our ranch and red pepper arrived our pizza was already at room temperature. Never got the water we ordered, twice. Awful."
Wendy D.,"Orange, CA",45,18,,5.0,12/2/2015,Excellent customer service. I work in the merketing Industry and I know how important is customer service. And this place is a good example of that. I love to eat there I always have a great time!
Darci Lee S.,"Honolulu, HI",80,99,242,3.0,9/5/2015,Purposely didn't eat at the baseball game because we wanted to eat at BJ's since we don't have one in Hawaii. The service John M provided is pretty much the only reason I'm giving this a 3 star review. It was very busy as there were a lot of people who came after the baseball game BUT it doesn't give the kitchen any reason to let food leave the kitchen cold or sloppy. Our experience at BJ's in Vegas was so incredible that we wanted to return. Sad to say that this location wasn't that wonderful except for our waiter John's service and cheerful personality.
Diandra B.,"Whittier, CA",106,74,26,1.0,9/5/2015,"I have been to many BJ restaurants but this particular visit was horrible. It took over 30 minutes to have someone come to our table. Ordering our drinks and food at the same time. Another 20 minutes before we got drinks, 2 waters and a lemonade. They our appetizer did not show up. Finally our salads came out. 5 minutes later the rest of the food came at the same time. To my knowledge appetizers come before the main course. Had to wait 10 minutes for refills. Finally time to pay and I had a $25.00 discount and the rest of my party heard me tell him to use it. Check comes back and only $5.00 were taken off. Pour server was Trey and I do NOT recommend sitting at his table. Not sure if we will come back to this location again. Attention manager, please re-train him!!!!!"
Jarryn H.,"Fullerton, CA",70,11,2,4.0,7/7/2014,"With some of the bad reviews I was reluctant to go. We'll I sat in the bar area and was acknowledged in a very timely matter. The server was very nice and recommended several beers I can enjoy.  Thanks to her I got a Blonde Ale brew, it was delicious and refreshing. After we ordered our food it came out pretty fast. I got the top sirloin steak medium well and it was nicely seasoned and went great with my beer.  Overall I had a good experience,  I guess when the employee's see the reviews they step their game up lol."
Calvary D.,"Westminster, CA",10,395,2,5.0,9/2/2014,"Everything here is good. I practically have tried all food items on their menu.  I loved the avocado egg rolls with tamarind sauce and love their clam chowder. Great place to hang out and watch games with your friends at the bar. You can't go wrong with deep dish pizza. As for pizookie, stay away from Smores peanut butter. It is just way too sweet. :)"
Dodie V.,"Whittier, CA",82,28,4,5.0,8/8/2015,"Came for an early lunch. Was greeted by the hostess promptly and asked if we had a Rewards Card.  Glad she did because we usually forget. Was seated immediately. Our server came quickly for our drink order and we had them in a few minutes.  We did not see our favorite appetizer on the menu, Piranha Nachos, and when asked about them, was told they were taken off to make room for new items but we can still order them. They were as good as ever. I had the grilled Mahi tacos and they were delicious.  Hubby had the new Hickory Brisket and Bacon burger. Lots of flavor and cooked perfectly. Server always checking on us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  Will certainly be coming back."
Estee B.,"Orange, CA",322,5,1,3.0,7/3/2015,Our server Michelle was awesome! Had a great vibe and very happy to be there. But I will say the hostesses were kinda idk rude? They gave us very weird looks and sized us up and down. We noticed they were doing to almost everyone they seated. Not professional at all. Shouldn't be judge mental of your customers or their appearance. But other then that the food was good as always!
Eva M.,"Santa Ana, CA",48,18,9,5.0,9/10/2014,I'm actually taken back at some of the bad reviews I am seeing. From my past visits I have not had a bad experience; great food and service. Yes it's a new bjs location and have many new recruits but as a consumer whose familiar with bjs menu I try and help them if or whenever there is any confusion on my orders:) they have overall friendly staff.  And they always get it right at the end.
Lucy E.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,2,1,4.0,6/20/2016,"Me and my husband went in to pick up an order we had placed throughout the phone, a great white deep dish, when we first saw it we were shocked a whole side didn't have cheese on it as if it couldn't get worse the cashier who took our order tried to argue with us that it did have cheese even though you could clearly see the bread lol. After another waitress saw our pizza and saw what a sorry state it was in she offered us a new one. At the moment all i was thinking about was not returning there ever again but not long after the manager not only apologized for the whole ordeal she quickly took out our order gave us a free pizookie and offered us 2 free appetizers and 2 free desserts the next time we came in.  The pizza tasted great and who doesn't like free dessert we will definetly be returning. I only wished i had gotten the managers name who helped us so i could thank her here."
Kristina S.,"Brea, CA",18,14,16,3.0,11/19/2014,Food was good. Waitress was friendly but both times we asked for a menu she forgot to bring it. She did pack our food into the box. They don't clean tables that quickly so looks a little messy because of that.
Alex V.,"Anaheim, CA",154,1,,1.0,1/24/2016,"Horrible service they took forever for everything our food took forever it was slightly cold refills took more than 10 minutes, my friend asked for jalapeños for his nachos and got them when he finished his nachos, finally when I asked for them to split our check into three different checks it seemed like I was asking them to preform brain surgery I had to explain 3 times how to split it but apparently that wasn't enough because another person in my party had to explain it again I don't ever plan on coming to this location again... should've gone to tgi Fridays lol"
Ben M.,"Brea, CA",12,4,,1.0,10/15/2014,"I guess you can't mess up beer... But anything else you get at this BJ's location is fair game for the cooks to screw up!  Sorry BJ's, I've been a loyal customer over the years, and I've been to several of your locations, but this one can't even serve a decent pizza !!  And What ever you do, DON'T order the Cob Salad unless you want a head of lettuce through a wood chipper! And there are no ""key"" ingredients of a standard Cob salad to be found  You might also wanna steer clear of the ""honey lime seared scallops"" !! Unless you like a big handful of sand in your over cooked seafood  So, once Again, I've been a loyal patron of BJ's for a lot of years, but THIS location (at the block in Orange) has THE WORST cooks !!"
Park N.,"Westminster, CA",105,72,,1.0,3/27/2016,"well don't know if all corporate bj are downgrading on their food quality. just had the worst tasting pie ever. order a large bbq pizza. apparently I think the waitress forgot the pizza on the counter and it sat there for awhile. when it did arrived the pizza was cold the sauce dried and the pizza pan was stone cold. I would rather eat Pizza Hut than to subject my taste buds with this ""pizza"" I would not recommend this location"
