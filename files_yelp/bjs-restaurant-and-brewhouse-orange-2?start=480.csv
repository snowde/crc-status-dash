Vanessa E.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,12,,4.0,1/23/2017,"This is mainly about my experience about a month back before Christmas. My friend and I were having dinner on a Sunday night on, 12/11/16. We sat outside since it was so packed inside, but we didn't mind because it wasn't as cold and they had heaters also. This is mainly to compliment our waitress who did a phenomenal job serving us. Her name is Hailey G. She did a great job communication with us about our food and was very honest when I asked her about her opinion on a certain dish I was debating about getting. She made the stay very personal and I absolutely loved her customer service. My friend and I order a pizookie, it did take a very long time to get it but because there was a big group of people in front of us who ordered pizookie's also it made sense why ours took longer. Hailey did a great job communication with us about our order, just so we wouldn't feel as if she forgot about it. I don't come here often (maybe once every other month) and this was by far the best customer service! I hope next time I visit I get her again."
Karen E.,"Anaheim, CA",97,55,183,1.0,3/10/2014,"I am very disappointed on the service that we received from Brittney B. (African American from Jamaica) If I would I would give 0 stars for her service.  Okay I don't really go to BJ's so it took us a while to order. We ordered drinks and then was asked if we wanted an appetizer but we weren't sure so she gave us more time after who knows how many minutes she asked us what we wanted. I told her ""for appetizer we will have the California club pizza"" then can I have a bacon cheese burger with no pickles she asked me how I wanted my burger and I told her well done. It seemed like forever to get our appetizer.  Please note brittney did not write or take notes of anything we ordered.  We finally got our drinks but never got our appetizer since they brought us our food first. My hamburger was not well done! It was pink. I would have returned it but I just ate it. Brittney was more involved giving her customer service to the bigger parties especially to the table who had a guy that was a sales car person. She was more interested in making tips. She barely came to our table since we were in the middle tables. She refilled their cups of water 2-3 times while my bf and I were there, and only came once to see if we wanted anymore drinks and my bf said he wanted another beer. Well that beer took forever!  I understand that maybe she had 4 tables to assist but my boyfriend and I agreed that her service was better with the others, that had a bigger party. And this time him and I both agreed that she deserved $0 for her tip. & that's what she got I would have talked to the manager but why make a big deal out of it I'll just post it on yelp. Note to Britnney: please write down customers orders and attend them even when u have a big party. $ is $ and we would have tipped you well if you did a great job but u didn't you practically ignored us!"
Curt R.,"Orange, CA",0,7,13,1.0,7/25/2016,"Well, the kids wanted to go to BJ's and against my better judgement we gave it a try. If you are young and have not been around long enough to form an educated opinion of what good food is, or, you are an older person who just wants to be seen with the trendy crowd, then this is the right place for you. I figured it a safe bet to go with the BJ's deep dish pizza ($25) that made them famous. Well, it probably was good at one time but that time has come and gone. You would be much better off going to a place like Blaze for a third of the price for pizza. The buffalo wings were awful. In the words of my nephew ""the mashed potatoes aren't what they used to be"". I did enjoy my beer so to sum it up, hit BJ's if you must for a beer at happy hour then head out elsewhere for your dinner."
Jenn J.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,31,4,2.0,4/2/2016,"The service here has definitely gone down. I last gave this place a 5 star rating. I've eaten here twice since then with bad experience. One was dine in and one take out. When I came to dine in with 2 friends it was a Tuesday night and the place wasn't so packed, yet no one was happy. Not one person smiled at us from the host to the server. We even told them we were celebrating a birthday and they just said ""cool"". Next when I ordered pick up it was the weekend. And my order took 20 minutes over the initial time. Then the server tells me I need to pay again even tho the app showed I had paid already. I had to pull up the receipt through email and then she told me I had to repay because I had asked for an extra scoop of ice cream and she had to recharge me for it. I told her just forget about it. I hope your staff becomes more polite in the future."
Karen C.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/1/2016,It's a Friday night and I understand it's busy but the wait was over an hour. I don't mind the waiting part because like I said it's a Friday night. We were seated and we put in our appetizer order. Menus weren't taken from us and our appetizers were brought out with out plates. Server still isn't anywhere to be found. We asked another server if we could have refills on our beverages and we were told to hold on. It's been 15 minutes and they still aren't here. The other waiter is looking for our waiter to get our refill... The only reason I haven't walked out is because I'm with my kids and they just want to eat... not happy about this service at all.
David T.,"Garden Grove, CA",248,4,,1.0,10/5/2015,"The food is great, but don't bother calling in for a table. It is a trick to try to get you there. On 2 occasions I have called in and been told my name was on the wait list and I might have to wait a few minutes when I got there but I wouldn't have to start at the end of the list. Both times when I got there I was told oh sorry your wait time doesn't start till you get here. I will never eat inside a bjs again. I will to to go orders."
Cristine S.,"Fullerton, CA",4,25,7,2.0,11/4/2015,Would honestly give this BJ's zero stars but the food was good so 2 stars for that. Our server was training which might be the reason for the poor service. Been here for lunch several times and volume of people is the same as tonight. Friendly but inattentive and slow service is the turn off.
Alice T.,"Long Beach, CA",25,63,143,1.0,3/18/2014,"I was too disappointed one too many times. :( it took about 5 - 10 mins for a waiter to attend to us, the food came out pretty dry, and our waiter basically disappeared. We had to make a list of what to ask him if and when he showed up so we wouldn't have to wait another 20 mins for him next time around.  Luckily, there was the food runner who saved the day and gave us everything we asked for, apologized for the food and waiter, and wished is a good day.  So sad that this would be our first and last time eating a meal here. :( I'm just happy that the nephews enjoyed their mini pizookies."
A L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,23,7,4.0,9/27/2014,Great food!!!! Needs a little work on serving. Thats all Folks!!! I would still recommend this restaurant regardless of there flaws!!!!
Hungry D.,"Brea, CA",17,158,381,3.0,8/14/2015,"The service is good.  However, waitress is very slow giving us the check.  Main course meal is not hot although appetizer come out nicely with the exception to arch and spinach."
Rosalynn H.,"Cerritos, CA",23,82,1,1.0,3/6/2014,"I will never come back here for lunch unless I plan on having dinner there as well all in one trip.  It always takes two hours to get in and out regardless of the size of your party (2-8). First time the waitress disappeared never to return.  Granted, she did tell us she was going to go back to the kitchen for a bit but 30 minutes later we still did not see her.  We were there for 2 hours. Second time it took us almost two hours to get in and out as well.  Took so long for the food to come out that we went through 2-3 glasses of water while waiting. Both times I had to walk the check up to the front where all of the girls working there would congregate. Terrible and SLOW service."
Anthony A.,"Fullerton, CA",1,19,7,2.0,9/26/2015,"This place has 2 1/2 stars! There's a reason why! I've never been to a BJs with bad customer service! I use to serve at Bjs in Brea and never once took 30 minutes to check on a table! The food was cold and the scampi pasta was dry! Once telling the server, she didn't apologize but got a manager quickly! First thing you do is say sorry! BJs has great food don't get me wrong, but Sept 12 was not the day."
Fred H.,"Anaheim, CA",45,91,50,3.0,8/31/2014,"We came here on a Friday night with 5 people.  It was a 25 minute wait until we got seated.  The AC was cranked so high that some of us were shivering.  I know servers may be hot running around, but keep the temperature comfortable for customers. Our server is best described as uncaring.  We didn't have silverware and we had to ask twice before getting it after the food had already come out.  We asked her to take a picture of the group and she said in a minute, then went to other tables and didn't come back.  When she came back, of course she forgot and the moment was over. We ordered: 2 orders of wings, corn fritters, angel hair pasta, a Medium BBQ chicken pizza and a BJ's specially pizza. The wings are good as always, my favorite.  The corn fritters are slightly over fried and on the verge of turning burnt.  The angel hair pasta is over cooked to a point of mushiness and violating the cardinal rule of pasta.  Both pizzas were undercook and doughy.   The pizza needed to stay in the oven for a few more minutes.  We immediately brought it up to our server, who offered to have kitchen put it back in the oven.  After realizing we were not happy with her response she asked if we wanted to see the manager, we told her yes. The manager is very nice and offered to re-make the pizzas right away.  15 minutes  later, fresh ones were brought out.  The dough was better but the pizza didn't taste very good.  It's nowhere near comparable to the HB location.  At this point, we all regretted and vowed to only go BJ's in HB moving forward.  Throughout, the manager came back a few times to check up on us.  He offered us complimentary dessert on the house as an apology.  We had the undeniably delicious pizookie.  Because of the manager's efforts, i gave it a 3 stars, otherwise would have been a 1 star. Summary:  terrible pizza, terrible pasta, didn't enjoy the service from waitress, but the manager is very nice and accommodating.  I would not come back to this location.  Until they change the quality of the food and service, we'll only visit Huntington Beach location."
Amira C.,"Anaheim, CA",8,11,,2.0,6/22/2015,"Went here for a anniversary party a week ago. The waiter was awful from the start and he had a very rough attitude from the start. Couldn't help with the menu and had no suggestions to give. Hah it's like who hired him? Too bad I didn't get his name. I later got my chicken marsala dish, and the photo had mushrooms in it. I asked him why my dish doesn't have mushrooms and he said because its in the sauce. Umm then why is it showing in the photo on the menu? So in a RUDE way, he said ""do you want mushrooms?"" I said well I wanted it cooked with my meal, not on the side what the heck am I gonna do with a side of blan mushrooms. Then again with an attitude and rolling his eyes looking annoyed he asked if ""I want mushrooms or not."" VEEEEEEEERY rude considering it is not my fault the maker of the menu included mushrooms in the dish. He completely forgot about our table of 10, never got refills nothing. And we were later charged with a $22 tip he did not deserve. If anything we should have gotten a comp for his nasty attitude. Cant remember his name but hopefully no one else have to deal with him."
Sylvia P.,"Irvine, CA",0,33,7,1.0,3/28/2016,"Horrible customer service.  Soup was horribly salty.  One day it's decent and the next it's too salty.  One time, they never brought out our order until we spoke to management and found out the computer system lost half the orders.  On another visit, the food never came until after a 45 minute plus wait after we complained to management.  Pizza is not bad but the wait is ridiculous."
Rachel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",669,31,59,1.0,7/30/2015,"Horrible customer service from the beginning. My sister called to do an early reservation 20 minutes before to alleviate the wait time. When we got to the restaurant, the hostess in the front said it would be a ""30 minute wait."" I understand the dinner rush and I have no problem with waiting, but my patience is thin when the hosts seat other large groups BEFORE us who checked in minutes after we arrived. My family and I waited for an hour until I took the liberty of walking through the restaurant to the restroom to see how busy it is. SO MANY BOOTHS AND TABLES were open and just as many waiters and waitresses walked around casually as if it is a slow night. I finally requested for one of the empty booths and they hesitated and wanted to make us wait more for a table that is ""currently being cleaned."" I hate being THAT person, but I was stern with the him and said the empty booth is fine. When the host directed another hostess to finally seat us, my mom asked why it took so long to get seated. I'm furious about the fact that (1) my mom was ignored and not given an answer, (2) the curly haired hostess rolled her eyes at my mom and had the indecency to not smile the entire time that she brought us to our table and give us our silverware and menus, and (3) its my mom's birthday TODAY... (Thanks for making starting off our dinner horribly.) On the brightside, our server Alicia G. was very sweet from beginning to end. She took care of us and helped make my mom's birthday special. My family and I LOVE BJ's. We always go to this establishment for fun family dinners, but we will NEVER go back to this one."
Nancy P.,"Anaheim, CA",56,301,36,2.0,3/11/2015,"I've been on a losing streak. I took my two nieces here to celebrate their bdays. We came right after school so, it wasn't busy at all. I asked about happy hour and the waitress went and got the hh menu for me. When she took our order,  I ordered  3 items from the hh menu. The girls ordered a burger and pizza and hubby had a pizza, too. She asked what I was having and I said I'm eating what I ordered from the hh menu. She brought out my order from the hh menu. Which was 5 buffalo wings and 2orders of avocado eggrolls. Which one order of eggrolls was for the girls to try. Everyone started eating my wings...grr! Ah, hello...those were my meal. Whatever...they were barely warm. Not good. It took forever for everyone's food to come out...like almost an hour. Then when it comes...its wrong. I was pissed to say the least. We had to leave soon and my neice was starving.  The reason why I was so pissed is because we stopped the waitress before putting in the order to inquire about what was on the burger my neice ordered and then she ends up with a completely different burger. I don't know many kids who would order a blue cheese burger.  The manager came to say sorry and offered dessert but we were running so late.  Then the bill comes and she doesn't apply the happy hour price. Ugh! They comp'd an eggroll order but it doesn't fix our dissappointment. The service here needs major improvement."
Joanne D. M.,"Orange, CA",2,9,5,1.0,9/20/2015,"We are frequent customers of BJ's in Laguna Hills.  We decided to try the location closer to our home. What a mistake!!! Callled ahead to make sure they were showing the Raider. Also got on the priority list to be seated. And confirmed that they could change channel to the Raider game wherever we were seated. Got there 20 minutes later. Even on priority seating, it was a 20 minute wait. So we waited, and waited to be sat. 30 minutes later, the game had started and we were still waiting. Finally, the hostess seats us. None of the TV's in the back room had the Raider game on so my husband asked the hostess if she could get the TV to the game we wanted to see. No possible. The TV's are all programed to show specific games. My husband said we called, we confirmed they could change the channel. No, not possible. We left to find a place that want our business. Never again will I enter any location of this restaurant. The hosting staff was rude and obnoxious.  If I could give them negative stars, I would."
Janet D.,"La Palma, CA",163,31,46,4.0,8/5/2015,Had an appetizer roasted Brussel sprouts.  Ummm so good highly recommend.   Also enjoying a peach margarita a little on the sweet side.    Now waiting for my Mahi Mahi fish. I'll keep you posted
Scott H.,"Navarre, OH",79,81,106,3.0,10/18/2015,Went here with a larger group of people. We sat at a beautiful table outside that had a built in fire pit. Food was great but service was very slow. I'm not sure if being outside we we on back burner ? They did seem very busy inside. Still had a great time with family though.  (And it was a great perk seeing all the Dallas Cowboys jerseys and fans show up to view the preseason game against San diego!)
