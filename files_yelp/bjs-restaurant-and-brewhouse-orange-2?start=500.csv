Mireya H.,"Orange, CA",3,32,5,1.0,8/19/2015,Waited 30 minutes for food.  The waiter forgot our order twice. Disappointed in the  service at this location
Vicki E.,"Brawley, CA",82,201,62,4.0,8/19/2015,Great casual ambiance. Varied menu so sure to please most diners. Great selection of beers. Save room for their Pizookie dessert or one of their other offerings. Easy to make a meal with a few appetizers and drinks.
Donny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,12,6,2.0,9/12/2015,"Wow. Food is mediocre at best, but the best part is being ignored repeatedly by your waiter. We were finally able to flag down someone else's waiter."
Mark S.,"Stockton, CA",6,39,1,5.0,4/2/2015,I just wanted to say this place was a blessing the staff was very friendly and great. My server Alicia you rock girl. The food was outstanding and the drink were great. Would come back in heart beat
Eddie C.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/18/2016,"I've been to BJ'S a number of times over the years.  I never leave disappointed thanks to the great food/craft beers/dessert. I would like to highlight the orange location on the city drive. I've never had a bad experience at any BJ'S in regards to service and this location is no different. I had an unfortunate incident occur when my 3 year old son got stuck in one of the high chairs, where one of his legs was pinned up against the front guard. Not only was the staff helpful in trying to fix the situation, but also helped in keeping my little guy calm and happy as they rushed to get the proper tools needed to disassemble the high chair. Unfortunately, they did not have the correct tool, at which point I remembered I had tools in my trunk. After a few minutes my son was out and on his way to eating his favorite deep dish pepperoni pizza along with a complimentary pizookie. The manager made sure he stopped by our table a few times to check if we needed anything and to make sure my son was doing ok and was happy. Keep up the good work guys and girls."
Kimtsy S.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,4,2.0,8/13/2015,"My boyfriend and I came in here Tuesday afternoon for a early dinner. The hostess sat us quickly and was friendly. I can't remember our servers name but he was friendly. I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and my boyfriend ordered the pepperoni deep dish with no tomatoes. I'm not quite sure who got this wrong if it was the server or the kitchen, but when we got our food my boyfriend's pizza had tomatoes and my Mahi Mahi somehow turned into a salmon. How do you get Mahi Mahi wrong? It's in the name and it also didn't taste very good. I wasn't feeling very well so we left fairly quickly but if we had more time I would have sent the Salmon back."
Kat N.,"Santa Ana, CA",115,17,7,5.0,6/11/2015,"I went to BJ'S tonight for dinner and was served by Patrick !! Man!! What an awesome server. He did everything a server should do. He was very personable, friendly, and polite! If I could, I would ask for him every time ! It's not always about serving your customers but when you're friendly and go that extra mile, it's so worth it. Food was good today, had the salmon and asparagus with couscous ...and tried some of the bjs fav pizza ...delish! Also shared the mini poozookie. .AMAZING!  I'll definitely be back! THANKS PATRICK!!!"
Ulises C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,11,7,1.0,11/16/2015,Don't try the jambalaya. It was insanely salty and gave me a horrible stomach ache the next day. I don't know if it is food position or just a bad dish. But I have had a really upset stomach since eating there. Sad to say I might not go again. Disappointed.
Alex G.,"Anaheim, CA",3,21,3,5.0,9/5/2015,I've become a regular because the choices of beer is endless and the quality of food is beyond my expectations. It's a restaurant be patient. For faster service with beverages sit at the bar.
Tony N.,"Westminster, CA",296,204,63,4.0,6/20/2014,We came in and we got seated promptly. Our server took our order and got our appetizer out quickly but I had to remind her we didn't have any setting which was a problem I had with the Huntington Beach one in which I just left because I never received setting to eat my steak. Our food is taking a while to come out but our server has checked up on us about six times now assuring us that she hasn't forgotten us. In conclusion it has been a good experience for us. I would highly recommend coming to this place.
Brian P.,"Anaheim, CA",22,17,31,3.0,8/21/2015,"Great food, great place, asked one of the waiters to change the channel to the football  game which he did, thanks . Although I was a. little disappointed but overall it was ok , server Trey did a great job, little miscommunication had to wait a little longer for my son's food but gave us a desert for the inconvenience which was cool.  I received the bill and I notice I was being over charged server fix that..."
Allison H.,"Orange, CA",0,19,5,1.0,4/30/2015,"The slowest service of any BJs, or restaurant for that matter. Avoid at all costs!!!!"
Ruben M.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,15,1,1.0,5/31/2014,"The service here was less than satisfactory, I have been to many bjs locations and this one always seems to disappoint. Uncoordinated and poorly managed servers are the cause of this establishment to be very unprofessional and inconsiderate, I will never return to this location again.  FYI they won't give to silverware for your food so I would assume bjs wants you to eat like an filthy animal  and eat with your hands."
Robert S.,"Glendale, CA",1,3,6,1.0,10/25/2015,Terrible experience at this restaurant. Dirty restrooms and dining spaces... Slow service. Inexperienced managers...
Jen L.,"Irvine, CA",894,652,69,2.0,1/6/2015,"Probably the WORST experience I've had at a BJ's Restaurant EVER. The service was mediocre, we kept having to wave down people for service and the food was bad! The pizza that came out was undercooked and mushy! How can you mess up pizza??! Everything else we had ordered was forgetful. By the time we saw the bill (for a party of 4) we kind of cringed that the quality of food we just had cost that much. Won't be coming here again."
Alberto D.,"Garden Grove, CA",27,30,25,4.0,3/9/2014,"The pizza is good and they also have Negro Modelo on tap! Modelo is such a good beer and it's rare to find a place serving it on tap, aside from the beer the pizza here is amazing, the meat lovers and Buffalo chicken are my favorite. The service is good and they also have many specials during the week."
Jondre M.,"Reno, NV",13,17,4,3.0,4/6/2014,"Meals Overall: 2 stars. Served us cold meals when they were supposed to be hot. Forgot the bread that we ordered and the sandwiches were made with stale bread. Service: 3 stars, our server was great. The meal runners were terrible. They failed to check the meals before they served them to us. The manager came to visit and tried to smooth things over which was nice, but the initial shock of cold soup being served was too much to overcome. Will probably give them another chance, but this was a tough meal experience to go past three stars."
Susan H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",20,6,4,4.0,9/13/2015,I was really concerned about making reservations for 19 at BJ's after reading all the negative post I was very pleasantly surprised when we arrived our reserved table was ready for us to be seated Miranda was our waitress and did an amazing job seeing everyone's drinks were refilled in a timely manner everyone's order was correct and she even offered to stand up on a chair and try to get all 19 of us in a picture .so  you can't always believe what you read on Yelp... and we were there on a Sunday night. .
Jenny K.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,13,2,1.0,9/9/2015,Waited too long on a weekday. Finally seated and we were ignored for over 10 minutes. We walked out and the front staff didn't even say anything to us; they were too busy socializing. Obviously they did not have enough staff. Not returning. That's a shame because other BJ's have never been a problem.
Jerry J.,"Hawthorne, CA",131,16,,2.0,10/18/2014,"""Ruined my 30th birthday celebration"" I came here in September to celebrate turning the big 30 (I'm old now LoL). I had some friends come down and along w/ my girlfriend & we were looking for a good time...We were horribly wrong. The waiter jokingly stated while taking our initial order, ""I'm not that good honestly"". He was right. After waiting 15 minutes for drinks, he forgot to put our appetizer order in. ""Oh I'm sorry I forgot, i'll be right back"". Okay so I can forgive that...at least he brought my drink!  We finally enter our main course order...my girlfriend SPECIFICALLY made sure she stated her order to our waiter. He even read it back to us. After waiting what seemed like over 30 minutes (mind you the restaurant was maybe at 55% capacity), her order was wrong again! He again stated, ""Im sorry guys its my fault. I said I'm not good haha"" I half-jokingly said ""Yes...we are starting to see that""  Meanwhile another young lady seemed to clean up his mess pretty well after coming off her break by completing our dinner service with a more experienced feel. All the meanwhile our other server was taking selfies with other customers...Guess some people don't realize who exactly you may be serving.. All in all I've normally never experienced bad customer service since I am a pretty frequent diner at BJ's but this one I definitely will not be back to. Most of the staff sat around talking while you could clearly see the other servers struggling w/ orders, seating, etc. If your looking for something quick and easy try Dave & Busters or El Toritos. This is one BJ I will glady skip on...."
