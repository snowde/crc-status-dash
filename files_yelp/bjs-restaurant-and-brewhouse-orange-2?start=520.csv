Darlene P.,"Long Beach, CA",15,19,2,2.0,8/4/2015,"My husband and I stopped by yesterday around 5:30p to have drinks and appetizers.   We sat in the bar area.   While my husband went to the restroom the server came up to take my order.  I asked about the happy hour menu beer ""class one"" and what that meant.  He said ""anything we don't make"" so I asked for two Budweisers.    He said we don't have that.  So, I craned my neck around to see the taps and ordered two Stellas.   He said cannot bring two beers if you are waiting for someone.  I was taken back.   I said so I cannot order a beer for my husband in the restroom?   He said, oh that's ok yes I can put that order in.  Weird.   I had a very strange feeling after that and wanted to leave, however my husband wanted to stay.  We ordered two appetizers and a couple more drinks.  The sliders did not have cheese and bacon as ordered but we ate them anyway.    Next time we'll go to Dave and Buster's."
Audrey R.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,8,2,1.0,9/2/2014,"So i decided to go back again  And yet again it was horrible  They always seem to lose our ""ticket"" First of all it was pretty fast seating we got the 2 for 20 something deal which is really good!!!! We ordered the soup the waiter that brought them forgot the spoons so we waited and waited so I saw another waiter and asked her she forgot too!! Finally when our waiter came by to asked how it was he realized there were no spoons it took 15 mins to get 2 spoons really -_- We got new hot soups and spoons finally so that was nice After an hour of waiting for our pizza out waiter comes by and says they made a mistake but it will be out soon!! We waited and finally the manager came by and said they made another mistake and made 2 personal pizzas instead and will be out soon We waited and waited and the manager came back with one pizza cheese and chicken ( we ordered BBQ chicken) with no cut marks so he was cutting pieces for us And walked again before we can notice there was NO BBQ sauce one the pizza no cilantro  I was starving it was cold out waiter came by and asked us how was it was it worth the wait -_-  he brought us sides of BBQ and cilantro  Our pizookie came out I think that was the best part  We got our whole meal for free  2 times already  I didn't not proof read this bc it makes me so mad so I apologize now"
Ian K.,"Santa Ana, CA",182,262,963,1.0,3/5/2014,"200th Review - Disappointing experience for my friend's birthday. This past weekend my friend decided to have a group lunch for about 20 people. I had a bad feeling but hoping I was wrong, and was I? Nope! So if you have a large group, half of the group has be present, makes sense no issue there. I kindly asked the waitress to change the channel to the NHL Heritage Classic (Senators vs. Canucks). She said she'd check with her manager, fair enough but didn't bother to get back to us. My friend had to ask another waitress, and guess what it got changed. Just say no, if you don't want to do it (Haha). BJ's is known for their pizza, but I decided to choose something else - Mahi Mahi Tacos. Oh boy, bad decision! The Mahi Mahi is a new menu item and needs to be removed from the menu. The tacos were not flavorful, chicken was undercooked, and just plain disgusting. I should of went with the overpriced pizza or just stayed away from all the food menu items. The group ordered various items from burgers to pizzas. My friend sitting next to me ordered a calamari sample, and that was horrible as well. It wasn't only me because she told prior to me trying it wasn't good. When it came time for the bill, the waitress added 3 ""Scooby Snacks"" to our bill, which we didn't order. Thankfully we checked the bill before just handing our credit cards over. The waitress asked us if we wanted to close out with here or pass it someone else. We told her we would with her since she was the server and guess who shows up someone else. So we had to re-explain the bill to her and ensured $5 was taken off because I had an online coupon. Why ask if you are going to do what you want? Moving right along, it was an unpleasant experience. BJ's will not be on my list to have a drink or get a bite. FYI - the HH menu sucks. It shouldn't be called HH. This place is overrated, avoid. Go down to TGIF's. Much better menu items and service!"
Dawn L.,"Garden Grove, CA",17,13,4,5.0,7/24/2015,Our Server Katie gave great service! Even Jose who was cleaning off the table next to us was helpful when I asked him a question! I am giving 5 stars because the Manager Jesse came over to make sure everything was good.
Andrena S.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,4,12,2.0,8/26/2015,"My boyfriend took me to here to try the best pizza which he had tried before. I give 4 stars for the pizzas but give only 2 stars for the service. I ordered one half-half medium pizza. They did not put it in a plastic bag, or even a piece of napkin we also did not have. Before that I saw them took out many deliverable food out of the restaurant with the best preparation. I got a little bad feeling about the caring and love from staff to international guests like us. I m now considering that we should visit this brand name again or not. The small thing can change customer's feelings u know???"
Ryan T.,"Brentwood, CA",0,16,6,5.0,9/29/2014,"Thanks after a bad experience at TGI, we had a great meal.  Service was great food was great. The pepperoni dip was so good I wish it was bigger. I had the Samon. I wish Bj's in my hometown of brentwood was this good."
David C.,"Orange, CA",344,14,,5.0,2/19/2016,"Great food, amazing craft beers, cool atmosphere and one of the best desert options in Orange County. The infamous pizookies will leave you satisfied after any meal, and their food is perfectly cooked. Although you may leave with a somewhat pricy tab, it's always worth it."
Taylor L.,"Montebello, CA",1,6,,2.0,1/12/2015,"I love Bj's and I usually have a really great experience when I have dinner at the Brea location. I went here with my boyfriend for a romantic date and while our waitress was really sweet and the food was decent, the behavior and attitude of the hostesses that were at the front soured the whole experience.  I understand getting friendly with your coworkers and talking to each other during your down time but they were extremely inattentive and rude. We walked in and they barely paid any attention to us and kept talking to each other and then when they finally noticed us one of the girls just dropped us at the nearest table and rushed back to finish her conversation without saying anything to us.  This Bj's would have better reviews  if they trained their staff properly and reminded them that they are there to work and not to socialize.  Maybe they should ask the brea location for some pointers because I've never had issues there."
Russ H.,"Corona, CA",107,124,117,1.0,12/30/2013,I went to this BJs location to celebrate my friends birthday on the 26th of December.   First of all the service was TERRIBLE the main entrees came out before the salads and or soup.  Two of my colleagues had to wait additional 10-15 minutes for their entrees after the rest if us were served.  Good was alright.   If you want BJs and you want great service I highly recommend the on in Huntington Beach or in Tustin/irvine.
Luis R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,13,,4.0,10/29/2015,"The food was great as usual. Service at such a large company is pretty hit and miss. It was not up to par with what is expected of BJ's. Way better experience and a regular at the Downey location. The happy hour seems to have changed and not such a great deal anymore. Gone are $4 beers and $6 appetizers. Instead they offer $1 off beers and $2 off appetizers. Will still come for the great food, but won't go out of my way to make the late night drive for the new happy hour."
Sadie H.,"Santa Ana, CA",98,10,,2.0,7/7/2015,It was my first time ever at BJ's and I had heard all these great things about the place. My boyfriend and I went out for lunch. A server comes running up asking if we would like anything and we ask for water. He doesn't introduce himself or nothing... Then he takes our order. It took a good 15-20 to just get our food... We got a burger and a salad... Then we ordered desert... It took another 15-20 to just get our desert we ordered a pizzookie. The manager was kind enough to take off the desert but when the manager left the server came running over with our bill and he tried to get us to pay before the manger even took the deserts off. Just wasn't a. Good first experience and probably won't go back.
Lori B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/9/2015,"I met a girlfriend here for lunch that I had not seen in a long time.  We chose this location as it is equal distance for both of us to travel.  The server was friendly, attentive (in the beginning)  and we didn't feel rushed at all.  When we finally ordered I said to our waitress ""I'd like the lunch tacos"", which were obviously from their lunch menu.  She asked me ""would you like the fish or shrimp?"",  to which I responded ""I'd love the fish, I didn't realize that was one of the options"".   She said nothing to that comment.  Our lunch came and the food was very disappointing.  The tacos were dry, probably from sitting under the heat lamps while my friends food was being prepared.  No big deal as I was really there to see my friend, not for the food.   Then the bill came...she charged me $9.50 for the tacos instead of the menu price of $5.75!  I asked another employee about it, as my server had already left, and she said the extra $4.00 was for the fish.  I was shocked!!  I specifically ordered ""lunch tacos""... She tricked me by asking if I wanted the fish or shrimp, which I now know are not part of the lunch menu. (apparently lunch tacos are only chicken which I would have been fine with).   I did not want to get into an uncomfortable situation with my friend there so I paid the bill, left her a very small tip and wrote a note on the ticket telling her I didn't appreciate the 'bait and switch' game she just pulled on me. Be prepared if you go in to BJs, she was a master at how she manipulated this situation, almost doubling the price of my lunch...so disappointing!  My friend and I will be finding another place to meet in the future."
Sandra R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2015,Horrible place long wait and place was not even full and horrible waitresses  dirty glassware. .I do not recommend this place and not friendly employees. ..
Kevin L.,"Corona, CA",23,24,,2.0,6/29/2015,"Didn't get good service here, nor was the food impressive... thought I was going to a professional restaurant... Came in a with a group of 5 , seems kinda busy so i have patients . Got some appetizers which came out on time . Asked for some one thing extra which was sliced lemons, never came out, so I asked someone else... Food came out super late and most of it was almost cold. Waitress never asked if everything was ok. Just asked if we need anything else and tried to sell us dessert.... They gave us the check before I was half way done with my food ( they said no rush though)  ..."
Rhiza D.,"San Diego, CA",409,88,55,3.0,10/29/2013,"Long wait in a Saturday night, waited like 30 mins. Got a deep dish pizza that wasn't too bad, but I dislike how there was barely any sauce. It's a little pricey for the quality of food, but it's more known for the beer I guess and the pizookies, which are delicious and incredibly filling.  Our server was awesome. She was very kind, speedy, and on top of her game. Great customer service."
Janice K.,"La Mirada, CA",72,52,56,1.0,5/4/2014,Came here for pizza and beer :). My husband and I can never order a big pizza so we order personal sizes. I ordered the BBQ chicken and he ordered the 5 meat.  Both came out dry and very little sauce and had to look under the cheese to see if there was any sauce. This is my first time at this location and I will not be back! I will stick to the brea location.
Lydia R.,"Orange, CA",2,9,,2.0,5/15/2014,"OH the pizookie is the only reason I came. The food was alright but it sure took forever......to get! All the other parties that had arrived after us were getting there food before us. Also we got our pizookie before we even got our meals, hey dessert before lunch is always good I guess."
Adam G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,19,,4.0,7/30/2015,"Great food, amazing beer, what's not to like?  Love the different micro-brews, especially the seasonals.  The wait time at lunch is kinda painful, but it's only because it's usually packed.  Hard to be mad that everyone else likes to eat here too.  Anyhow, the unlimited soup and salad lunch special is epic, cannot get enough of the chicken tortilla soup!"
Grace M.,"Orange County, CA",42,180,80,5.0,1/21/2014,"Came to the new BJ's location at the Block to catch a football game since ESPN zone at Downtown Disney was insanity. We sat at the bar and were greeted by a wonderful bartender (Don't remember her name, she was fantastic!). Service was prompt, friendly and timed well. We ordered appetizers and drinks to enjoy the game (Go Seahawks!). I'm really enjoying the PM Porter these days, so smooth and delicious. I will definitely revisit this location, their bar is beautiful (and the restaurant is less than 6 months old)."
R. B.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,16,8,1.0,4/11/2015,"Excuse my English, but, FUCK... THIS... PLACE... If you thought the one at the Tustin Marketplace was bad, this one takes the pizookie. FOOD: Half an hour DRINKS: Another half an hour REFILLS: NEVER! CHECK: Another half an hour. Condiment: Wrong one! Would I give this guy the benefit of the doubt cause it was crowded, yes. If it was crowded. It was a bit, until the folks next to us left due to being unattended to. We complained to the managers, there were two, one was fair, the other a dope. It you have time to kill, go for it. The food is good, just try eating it after your appetite leaves though..."
