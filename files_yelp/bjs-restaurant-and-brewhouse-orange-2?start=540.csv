Mark A.,"Diamond Bar, CA",70,157,1,1.0,9/21/2013,"I came here on a Saturday night with a fairly large party (12 people) to celebrate my friend's birthday.  We had reservations for 5pm, and we got seated by about 5:20.   It took about 20 minutes or so for the entire party to show up, but after that, there weren't any delays or anything.  We ordered our food promptly, and the only time wasted was us waiting for our food. Our waitresses were friendly but never came around with any refills of any sort.  The food was typical BJ's - good, but nothing much more than that. But the biggest insult came when we were paying for our meal.  After we got the check, we took about 15-20 minutes for everyone to figure out what they had to pay, but with our group (a bunch of math teachers/techy types) it didn't take too long to get everything squared away.  As we were waiting for the waitresses to charge our credit cards and square out our bill, the manager of the BJ's came to our table and told the birthday girl herself that there was a 2-hour limit, and basically told us to get out. Hey asshole, why don't you at least wait until we get our credit cards back before you start kicking us out of the joint?  I looked at my cell phone and it was 7:35, so almost exactly 2 hours since we sat down.  You really couldn't wait another 15 minutes or so for us to get our cards back so we could leave on our own? F you, BJ's.  I wasn't a fan of your food to begin with, but now I'm never coming back, especially not to this location."
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,4.0,4/17/2014,"Well, I finally have found a way to have good chicken at BJ's.  Do not get the BBQ as it is always over cooked and done like leather.  The lemon Chicken breast was VERY good!!  Incredibly moist, cooked to perfection and tasted great.  Why can't BJ's do this for all of their chicken?  This should show everyone that the BBQ chicken is cooked ahead of time as the chicken breast is the same cut.  If you want the BBQ version, tell them to cook the Chicken as if it were going to be the Lemon Chicken breast and instead of Lemon, slop on the BBQ sauce.  I promise you will finally get a well cooked, moist chicken meal from BJ's!"
Christopher M.,"Fountain Valley, CA",246,42,55,2.0,5/24/2015,"I'm writing this while sitting in the restaurant its been about 15 minutes or so and Noone has no one has came to ask if we drinks, if we were ok or anything at all. Service really is terrible; I probably won't be coming back to this BJ's"
Jonatan M.,"Garden Grove, CA",458,137,71,4.0,4/20/2014,Great service shout out to Jacob out waiter! We went in for brunch on Easter and was not crowded we got seated quickly because of the call ahead service!  Food was great we had a small accident with food which the waiter and manager  quickly took care of!  Look forward to coming back!
Nabeel Q.,"Buena Park, CA",255,8,2,5.0,3/19/2015,Nvm you guys are best restaurant ever! Food is delicious and service is amazing! I totally mean it!
Desiree H.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,10,35,1.0,6/13/2015,One star is too much for this place. Great food but absolutely terrible service. We got seated fairly quicked but then had to wait for over 15 mins for someone to come by to get our drink order and this was in the afternoon and there was hardly any other customers there. We order four waters and she brought us one for us to share? And she never came back around the whole time we were there except to put the check on the table so we couldnt request again drinks for all of us or even a refill for the one.
Omar S.,"Anaheim, CA",40,36,8,3.0,5/18/2015,"This is an update: after complaining with straight forward truth, they refunded my money and they did throw in an extra few dollars. As bad as they were at this location, management stepped up like they should. I just hope they push the staff harder to keep them from cutting corners."
Michael V.,"La Habra, CA",5,8,,1.0,9/30/2013,"Stopped in here with my wife for a happy hour nibble and sip. She ordered the raspberry lemon drop martini; I ordered the white peach margarita. Hers = overly sweet, no hint of lemon. Mine = so sour I literally couldn't drink it. Round 2, she switched to a Pinot Grigio. Served in a red wine glass. I went with the Jeremiah Red craft beer, which is nice, if not a bit thin for a red.  Opened up napkin and silverware is spotty.  Ordered mini deep dish--mostly soggy. Boneless chicken wings--dry and rubbery. Chicken potstickers--not horrible. Avocado spring rolls--meh. Nothing was served hot, basically all warm, which colors this review.  Bottom line, we won't be back."
Jennie N.,"Santa Ana, CA",337,321,294,5.0,8/28/2013,"A waitress who brings you a refill before your last sip without having to ask is a great waitress. I enjoyed my deep dish mini, but the pizookie trio was out of this world. Would you like some dinner with your dessert? Good times!"
Kevin N.,"Anaheim, CA",0,16,3,2.0,9/28/2015,"It's okay, the BJ's on Beach Street is WAY better! The dough on my deep dish pizza was a bit cold. Took forever to get a refill on my soda."
Ryan B.,"Orange, CA",39,22,1,4.0,7/9/2014,"I love this BJ's because it's really big and it feels very new and clean. The outside patio is really comfortable and fun to sit at, but there isn't much of a view. I have been to this BJ's 4 times. I give this place 4 stars because it gets crowded and loud on the weekends (although the wait time is not bad), and the wait time after you place your order is somewhat long. Lunch specials and happy hour are a great deal, and if you are a frequent visitor, you should definitely sign up for the rewards program. The service is great. The staff is very friendly. I always seem to have weird questions at this place but they always answer and never make me feel like I'm asking a weird question."
Lily F.,"Anaheim, CA",10,62,18,1.0,6/5/2015,"Foods suck ! Waiter was great ! Jesse Kim saved them, he did not charge me for the pasta with shrimp, yuck ! Greeters were not trained right ! Very racy ! I tipped 100 percent, 18 dollars for the bill of 9 bucks !"
Kevin C.,"Anaheim, CA",11,30,2,2.0,6/4/2015,Super busy even during the week. Staff was friendly but forgot a part of my order. Food wasn't all that great. Nothing to special or outstanding about this place just your regular ol BJ's
Annie L.,"Anaheim, CA",3,83,1,2.0,10/17/2013,"I really LOVE BJ's, but this location is probably one of the worst.  I know you guys just opened not that long ago, but your lunch service is really slow. After we order, the food takes over 20 minutes to come out. I ordered a sandwich and fries combo, asked for toasted bread,  but what did I get? My fries came out COLD, not even luke warm, and my toasted bread came out luke warm borderline cold.  It's not like I ordered a damn pizza. I see so many servers just chit chatting with their friends here. Flagging down the waiter to ask for the check takes over 5 minutes, getting the check takes another 10, and finally getting my change takes another 10. Seriously? You guys are not busy. I know most of the people working at this location have worked other BJ's (I can over hear the conversations). What's funny is the waiter acknowledges I'm on lunch because of the clothes I'm wearing yet they take forever when I ask for the check. I generally ask for the check right when I get my food so I can pay for it and be done with it when I'm done eating."
Gina M.,"Newport Beach, CA",18,50,15,1.0,5/6/2014,"We've ordered take out from their call center and online order system and for the past 3 times they have not received the order or even had the order in their radar.  You would think we would learn, but we keep trying them and it is not good.  We have a standing meeting on Tuesdays in our office and we are ordering basic salads, nothing fancy.  But they can't seem to get the call in order thing right.   Besides their menu is way too big and with all the options it's no wonder they can't get it right.  I feel they are way too unorganized and can't just simply serve their guests properly."
Ale C.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,12,5,1.0,1/27/2015,"Im giving this BJ's 1 star because you can't give zero stars!! I came in at around 10:50pm (now keep in mind they close at 12am) and the whole restraunt was ""closed down"" said this rude host or what ever she was and directed us to the bar where we had to wait 10 min for someone to acknowledge us and finally sit down... I've been coming to BJ's forever and a day and i know they pride themselves on amazing service but i dont know why they even build one in a shopping center if they were just going to have shitty people with fucked up attitudes deal with guests... I really hope this BJ's gets some serious help!!!!"
Victoria R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",78,8,1,4.0,6/27/2015,"Me and my cousin came here on a Friday afternoon and got seated right away. My cousin kept wanting to move to a different table and the servers were really nice about it and let us do so. The food came out really fast and even though our server Jade had a party of 15 as well, she gave us really good service. The food quality could be better, it made me a little sick tbh or at least the chicken California club and salad did. Wouldn't recommend getting that, and would probably just come here for their pizza next time because that's the only thing they have going for them in my opinion."
Andrea L.,"Orange County, CA",463,353,106,2.0,12/7/2015,Came here with my husband today and boy was I disappointed. Never left a BJs location with such regret. Found a hair in my food and the waitress reluctantly swapped it out. Managing to still charge us for it. Lol from all the places I've eaten at if theres a hair or insect in your food they will replace it and eat the cost. I was really nice about it but she didn't even seem apologetic about the incident. Ordered two Mojitos and the first one was great however the second time around it was extremely sweet. Completely off balanced from the initial beverage. We waited and waited for the waitress to come back however she was either extremely busy or she just did not want to come back and help us. I got fed up with waiting I brought it to the bartender and asked for a replacement. She asked who my server was and I told her she hasn't come around for the last 15 mins. After another 5 mins of waiting (still without my drink) another server comes to our table and asked if he could provide some assistance. I explained to him that there was an issue with the drink so he brought me a new one. Whenever I go to places that serve food and beverages I try to be as nice as possible since I don't like other peoples saliva in my food lol. But at this point it was just getting ridiculous. No one came around to ask if we needed any condiments or if we wanted to clear some of the (obviously empty) dishes off of our extremely tiny table. After the incident with the beverage I never saw the girl come out again. From then on it was just the male server who took care of us. I just find it a bit ironic since usually if a waiter goes on break or if there is a transition they usually come together to introduce the new person responsible for your table. Meh I guess you can't expect much for people who do not take their job seriously. The happy hour deal/hours have changed so if you're a veteran happy hour attendee for BJ's be aware of your orders. Overall I am disappointed with the services and quality of food & beverages rendered. I hope that they try to fix internal and external issues since we love BJs.
Karen H.,"Santa Ana, CA",147,42,88,4.0,4/8/2014,"Yummy medium size pizza! We got Bj favorite & my 2 boys got to pick their kids meal. Jc got sphagette, garlic bread & pink lemonade. Joshua (15mos old) got Mac & cheese , apple sauce & apple juice. The kids enjoyed their food. Great service!"
Anthony C.,"Orange, CA",113,9,9,3.0,11/9/2013,"Stopped in for a bite last night, here is my review: it was about 6pm and it was packed. Had to wait about 20-25 minutes to be seated so we thought we'd grab a drink at the bar while we wait. The bar was packed, took about 10 minutes before there was any sort of opening, even then it was just a small split between some people sitting at the bar. I had wave down a bartender and then shout my beer from 2 people back. She asked me to come around to the side so she could hear.  They have these cool electronic boards next to the bar that rotate between the happy hour menu/times, special deals, seasonal beers, and their own bottled beer so you can take home your favorites! I asked for their seasonal Nit Wit that I saw on the board. She said they didn't have it because it was a seasonal. I guess I should've known better that their witbier was not a fall seasonal. She proceeded to inform me that the seasonal was a pumpkin ale or an oktoberfest. Neither of these were on the board at all. I had the Pumpkin ale and was satisfied. We were seated, and I was alarmed to see that their Filet Mignon (which is why I came here) was not on the menu. I asked the server and he confirmed that the Filet was being removed from the menu. He did offer to check if they still had some because it was a recent change. We ordered the Jeremiah Red and Santa Fe Rolls. He came back with the appetizers and beers as well as bad news: they were done with the Filets. We ordered the Ribeye with red wine mushroom sauce and a peanut butter pazookie. The service was great! He was attentive, went out of his way to help us and made great suggestions for beer and food pairings. Overall:  Service at the bar could've been better (possibly due to the volume of customers) Service in the dining room was fantastic! Beer was great as usual Bad news: Filet is gone :( Good News: Thursdays have affordable brews in addition to the Happy Hour Now you can get Jeremiah in a bottle! -Chewie"
