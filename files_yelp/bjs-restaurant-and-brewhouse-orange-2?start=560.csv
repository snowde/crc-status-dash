Josephine A.,"Columbia, SC",9,98,26,1.0,1/1/2015,"I love BJs. But this was absolutely the worst service I had ever seen in my life. It took about 15 minutes before anyone asked to take our order. He was nice but failed to see we didn't even have menus since we were sitting at the bar side. And failed to introduce himself. When our table was ready, our new waiter never introduced himself either when he showed up 20 mins after we were seated. Once we ordered, it took an hour and 15 mins before the food came out. Within that hour and 15 minutes, he never came to check on us. Water and beer glasses weren't refilled and the empty ones weren't taken off the table when we finally got more glasses of beer and water. If you're a waiter/waitress, your job is customer service. Do your job."
Peter V.,"Orange, CA",48,25,59,5.0,7/23/2013,"Excellent service!! Beer is super cold, wife's Strawberry Margarita is beautiful like her and food is delicious!! TV Screens around me but it not too much, the bar is very nice. Can not wait to come back !!"
Diorin D.,"Orange, CA",254,40,25,3.0,10/7/2013,"Can't go wrong with BJs food! Love the pizza and the pazooookies! Parking was crazy but that's to be expected on a Friday night. The wait when we got there was 45 minutes and for others after us it increased to one hour and 15 minutes lol that sucks. This location is actually pretty small to the ones I have been to!  I loved out waitress. She was efficient, nice and did her job well! I was sick and was so glad that my ""off"" attitude didn't bug her! I wish I remembered your name so that I can say thank you! Lol The hostesses though seemed like they hated their job...there was also so much chit chat gossip right in front of those waiting for their seats. Unprofessional - ESP since management was right there with them.  I like to ppl watch and the other servers were so dead and always made faces as they walked away - gaaaa I hope ours didn't make a face as she walked away lol.  This location is still new though...so I'm sure some type of changes will be made...we will see. Until then...it's BJs come for the food ;)"
Phuong L.,"Anaheim, CA",54,66,8,4.0,10/13/2013,"Just as good as the one on Beach Blvd. I got a two people deal for $20, soup and salad, a medium pizza of your choice and a pizookie. They were delicious. We also ordered the calamari and that was really good too. Total came out to be $35 including drinks and tax.  Food were fresh. We didn't have to wait long at all. It was a bit crowded though.  Very good customer service, the waiter was very nice too.  Those pizookie is definitely worth dying for hihihi."
Brian K.,"Anaheim, CA",103,246,404,4.0,3/12/2014,"Love BJ's brewery!! They have some great beers on tap with a wide variety of the beers they brew in house to choose from! I always like to drink the Pirhanna Ale! It's a great medium ale which goes great with any pizza. BJ's food menu is also very delicious! They have a wide selection of food to choose from. With appetizers, salads, sandwiches, or burgers....but my favorite here is the pizzzza!!! The House Salad with The Great White Pizza is by far the best!"
Jackie N.,"Garden Grove, CA",103,77,87,4.0,3/11/2014,I actually like this place a lot! Waiting like isn't that bad. It's about 15-20min wait. They have some pretty good lunch specials on weekdays! I also came here for dinner and their meal is absolutely  delicious . They also have fast service as well. However the booths are quite small.
Kimberly N.,"La Mirada, CA",324,362,4724,5.0,3/8/2014,Ive been here twice now and I like this location.  I like going at 3 on Fridays for happy hour where food and drinks are discounted. It is conveniently located by my job which is great. We had to wait for silverware which sucked because our food started to get cold.  But all in all the food tasted good and it is a very clean location.
Randy I.,"Garden Grove, CA",752,377,271,4.0,9/19/2013,"Pizookies!!!   I think I should say more, but I think I've made my point. Aside from that, I'd say the rest of the food is for the most part solid but has room for improvement.  The portions are fair and the presentation is nice but for some reason I just can't give it  a 5.  Maybe its a lack of freshness or maybe its because I'm not a big fan of American food.  I know one thing for sure is that I ordered a chicken soup and was very disappointed at the little amount I received.  On another occasion, I ordered the pulled pork bbq sandwich and it was enjoyable The main reason I go honestly is for the dessert.  I really enjoy the beignets with ice cream as well as the pizzookie.  Which is basically a cookie with ice cream on top. Service is very polite and friendly. The food  however takes quite a while to bring simply because the restaurant is so big and busy. Pricing is a little on higher side of fairly priced but I suppose you are also paying for the environment and ambiance. Regardless of those things, I still really enjoy this place because its a great place to go with a large group of friends where everyone can order something they want and can be accommodated."
LaShonda A.,"Long Beach, CA",1,21,1,3.0,6/1/2014,Well I go to sit down and the seat is dirty..  then she brings the plastic mat to put the drink down- THAT TOO IS DIRTY!... their saving grace is this free WiFi that I'm usingjust right now to post this Yelp! Ahhhhhaaa  But seriously though everything is just ok. I am a stickler for cleanliness so the first impression wasn't the best... Especially for the location.
Liliana L.,"Santa Ana, CA",56,1,,1.0,7/10/2015,"This has to be my worst experience at any restaurant ever! We waited for 2 hours!!! People that had been there the same time as us were all in already and I expected us to be next, but then people that got there after us were being let in, even people with bigger parties or the same amount as us! I only had a party of 3! I went in to the host and asked why is it taking so long and she said I'm still on the waiting list, I waited an hour longer and nothing! And I actually never got the text one is supposed to receive when your table is ready. What made it worse is that it ruined what was supposed to be my younger sister's birthday dinner. We ended up going home upset and just ate cereal. Thanks a lot BJ's we now forever hate you for ruining a birthday! If I could I would give you negative stars."
Jordan Bennett S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",249,171,28,5.0,11/7/2013,"I dined here tuesday night (11-5-2013) with tow friends, we had to wait about ten min for a table, it was very busy for a tuesday night. After our buzzer went off, they were still not ready for us and to wait a noter few min.  After we had been seated our server (Jessica) came up and recommended some seasonal beers and gave us the menus. She took our drink orders and returned very quickly. She was the best server ever, she was very nice, prompt and best of all she had a great sense of humor and kept us laughing all night. Our beverages were never never empty and every thing we ordered came out just as requested.  I ordered the spinach and artichoke deep dish pizza, it was perfect, the crust was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. all the topping stayed on the pizza was easy to eat even though it was huge!  After we all finished out dinner our server asked if we wanted dessert and we decided yes. She named them all off and  the second i herd White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie i was ready. they brought them out and they were amazing!  Thanks again Jessica you were great!"
Fanny L.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Horrible experience here! When my boyfriend and I went we waited to be seated for 20 minutes which was reasonable so we didn't complain, but once we got seated and orders some drinks we waited an HOUR to get our food! A whole HOUR!!! Not only that but when our food finally came, my boyfriend got the wrong meal and his food was served in a pan! Not a plate, but a PAN!!! So disappointed with the service here!!!!"
Matthew W.,"Cypress, CA",122,2,,2.0,8/16/2015,"Service was  horrible, no refills, server gave our food to the wrong person TWICE.  I tried waiving down our waiter twice with no luck just for a refill on my water. This wasn't even a busy night, I wish I could of talked to the manger"
Swathy S.,"Chino Hills, CA",137,87,30,1.0,8/31/2013,"Me and my bf love the pizza at Bjs so we go here pretty often. This was our first time at the location in Orange. I knew it was a new location as I work across the street. We went to the movies and got out around 11.00 and we knew Bjs was open till late so we decided to head over to get the gourmet veggie deep dish pizza. My bf was craving it all day so I wanted him to get it before we headed home. We got seated in a timely manner. Our waiter was very friendly as well. He just wasnt too aware of the vegetarian options they had. I ended up ordering a pasta and my bf got the pizza.  Our food took about 40 mins and when they brought it out I saw a piece of chicken in my plate when I actually ordered a veggie pasta. On top of that they forgot to add artichokes and basil to my bfs pizza. So they took it back and the manager came to us apologizing, almost every 5mins we had someone come up to our table and apologize for the mistake. It kind of got annoying  because everyone around us kept watching.  Finally after another 30min wait, they brought the right order and as the guy was serving us he drops the first slice of pizza on the table AHHHH!!! how bad can this experience get. We just stayed quiet and tried to enjoy our dinner. Our waiter then comes to inform us that the dinner was on the house and that they were sorry for all that happened. We just paid for the 2 drinks we ordered and left.  I remember checking the time we left and it was 1:30am. So warning for everyone going here: waiters are barely learning their menu, they are very sloppy, expect a long wait for your food and drinks and do not expect the best service either."
Blake K.,"Orange, CA",0,9,4,2.0,1/4/2015,"Dear BJ'S brewery,    Where do I begin... The only positive thing I could say about this restaurant is that every once in a blue moon I might have to send my order back only once. I have been here thirteen times now including two birthdays. There has been one occasion where everything worked like a charm and everyone was happy. I am sitting here now waiting for my pizza to be cooked. Oh wait this was over an hour ago. The first time waiter error (ok I get that it's fine). The second time they put the wrong toppings on the pizza. It's a very slow night so I figured they were just goofing off. The waiter claims it was mixed up with someone elses. The third time the crust was so crunchy the texture and bite felt like I was eating Pringles, PRINGLES!! Anyways over an hour and a half in and I was expecting to be in and out in half an hour. On a good day expect an hour minimum. When the final pizza came it was undercooked and had an excessive amount of cheese on it. I won't even bother coming back to this location nor order desert because all of my night is now wasted.               Sincerely,         A dedicated member of bjs with 1500+ loyalty points.       Ps: I won't miss the undercooked food!"
Christy N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",28,15,1,5.0,1/17/2014,"Love this place. Love the atmosphere. love the food and love the people who work here. I go here often with my colleagues after work and it is such a welcoming environment all thanks to the very attentive and friendly manager, Kevin. He is a true professional and he makes sure that our orders comes out perfectly. We usually order a bunch of appetizers to share: boneless wings, ahi poke, avocado egg rolls, spinach stuffed mushrooms. Well, our server accidentally brought out the traditional wings instead and Kevin immediately came to the rescue and like a true professional fixed our order while managing to convince us that the traditional wings were better. He was right after eliciting a few laughs from us and we ended up ordering another round of appetizers based on Kevin's enthusiastic recommendations. (He was too convincing and likable not to disagree!)  BOTTOM LINE: if you want to relax after work with good food, good company and a very welcoming atmosphere, come to BJ's and make sure that Kevin is there... Because he WILL take care of you, will engage you with his personable demeanor AND will make sure that you are having a good time!!!  A true professional in every sense of the word."
Den M.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,44,9,2.0,5/18/2014,"Compared to other BJ locations, service here seems to be disjointed and uncoordinated. Had to remind them about utensils, teaspoon at least twice.  Hope they improve."
Anastasia L.,"Fullerton, CA",250,73,130,4.0,1/15/2015,"I was hesitant to go here after the reviews but I was with a group and they wanted to come. We were seated quickly even though we were told there was a 30 minute wait. The waitress initially was super attentive but as the restaurant got busier, we had to wait to get our check. Not my favorite place but don't let the ratings scare you away. Not bad place for dinner and drinks when you are in a pinch."
Tan D.,"Santa Ana, CA",35,36,93,1.0,1/15/2014,"Came to this BJ's last night to watch the lakers and a bite. Sat down at the bar. Ordered my beer and food. Suddenly I hear voices behind me.  I Turned around and see a guy standing behind me talking to his friend sitting to my left. I found out that the guy standing behind me is the manager there. His name is Kevin. Normally it wouldn't bother me, since I'm at a bar. However; Kevin was having a full on conversation with the guy to my left. Fine, but manager Kevin put his arm on the back of my chair hitting my back. I pretend to sit back so he can leave my chair alone. But as soon as I lean forward, he'd be on my chair. So annoying. He apologize to me every time he bumped into me, but still. You're a manager talk to your friend another time. How can I enjoy my meal if you keep bumping into me. -0- California burger - tasteless. Bland. Heinz did however came to the rescue. At that point it was eatable. -0- Clam chowder - decent tiny bits of clam not bad -3- Caesar salad - nice but not great. Croutons were stale. -3- 0+0+3+3=6/3=2-1 for terrible time =1 That will be the last time I come here. I'll drive to the one on beach."
Jennifer H.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/3/2015,"Staff had horrible attitude! I love bjs food but couldn't get past how horrible all the staff was. The hostess's both acted like I was an inconvenience. They didn't greet me or act friendly in anyway shape or form. When discussing where to sit me one even said ""where should we put her? The other- ""I dunno, I don't care,  just put her over there."" Both servers we had also seemed annoyed at having to serve us and quickly gave us the bill to pay. Frequently checked if we had signed the credit card receipt but not once asked how the meal was or if we needed anything. Great food couldn't over come how unwelcoming each of these staff members made our visit feel. I have been a hostess and server and would not have behaved the way they did. It wasn't even during rush hour not that it would have excused any of this. I do not plan to return to this location or would ever recommend it to any one."
