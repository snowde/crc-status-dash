Karen L.,"Tustin, CA",3,3,,1.0,5/13/2015,"Will never come to this location again! Horrible service! My first clue should have been when I walked up and saw several employees parking in the front parking spots. Our waitress was not friendly at all. We had a party of about 5 and asked for separate checks, she stated it would not be a problem. She delivered our food then we never saw her again. Someone dropped off one check, never got refills on water or offered dessert. We were there to celebrate a birthday! Again they lost my business!!"
Danielle D.,"Lakewood, CA",48,47,44,1.0,3/8/2015,I wouldn't give it even a whole star. Hostess didn't i knowledge we were standing there. Then we waited 15 min just for the server to ask for our drinks. The steak was half fat. Chicken tasted like paper. The server didn't ask if we were okay or give me a refill on my ice tea. Terrible don't come to this bjs. Other locations are better.
Art S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",108,73,10,1.0,8/18/2013,"For a restaurant that just opened in a new location it does not help itself by hiring bartenders that take forever in serving you a beer. Ten minutes for me to sit in the bar area and still not have my beer that I asked for is unacceptable.  Not sure if our bartender lacked the communication skills to serve us or hated his job all I can say is that we did not expect the type of service that I received on Thursday night.  For a BJs restaurant, I always enjoyed their freshly brewed beers and their delicious plates at other locations including the customer service.  I know this restaurant is in a new area and all, maybe they don't need to worry about the demand but once people start noticing that the service blows here, customers are going to take their cash elsewhere.  Anyways, I will not be returning to this BJs and if I do, I will demand that I get a different bartender, that's for sure. I will continue to go to the BJs like in HB and brea but never again in this place until it gets it's act together."
Popeye V.,"Irvine, CA",161,59,20,2.0,2/15/2014,"Gave them 2 stars because the service was exceptional. The food just sucks. Of course their beer selection is decent, they are a brewery. Stick to the beer BJ's, food is definitely not your best quality! Employees are awesome though!"
Edgar A.,"Santa Ana, CA",134,58,53,4.0,3/29/2015,This location is closer to my house. So far don't have any complaints. Liz helped us out today and was on top of everything. Pizookies are a must.
Arnold S.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/20/2015,"This review is from my visit 3 months ago. The service at this place definitely needs improvement. In my experience, the hostesses told me 25 minutes of wait which became 50 minutes. Apparently they had ""accidentally"" skipped over our party, yet I noticed they were simply busy chatting with each other. The waitress was better at her service. Food is basically what you expect from any BJ's."
Paul T.,"Tustin, CA",5,55,7,5.0,3/2/2015,"Awesome experience last night. Thanks guys!!  Our waiter Rafael was incredible. Great service, great conversation, and just overall - pleasant. Thank you again, Rafael, for making our dinner the perfect cap to our already great day.  Be back soon for sure"
Sara J.,"Orange, CA",30,23,4,1.0,9/11/2014,"I would give it zero stars if I could.  I work down the street from this new bjs and ordered a California chicken sandwich (which they no longer have it's a California chicken club now) on the curbside take out for my 30 minute lunch break. I got the sandwich and it was completely the wrong sandwich, not even close. So I went back in and talked to the lady at the to-go station. It took FOREVER for me to get my sandwich (mind you I only have a 30 minute lunch.) When I did get the sandwich I started to drive over to my work which is literally down the street and I only had about 10-15 minutes to eat now so I started to eat on the way back to work. THANK GOD I opened the sandwich. There were hairs ALL OVER. Now, I shouldn't say hairs because only God knows what it was but there were TONS of auburn colored hair-like things all over the sandwich. Because they were tiny straight hairs, it could have been mistaken for pubes. So extremely upset and NOW NOT ABLE TO EAT FOR 8 HOURS, I went back to the manager who went back to the cooks and said there were no cooks there with that color hair so she had no idea where it came from. She gave me a 30 dollar gift card and offered me a free salad or soup to go since I had not eaten on my lunch but I just didn't have time. SO THERES MORE. Me and my boyfiend decide to go to the Cerritos Bjs and to no avail.. The gift cards don't work!!!! We had to wait another 30 minutes just so that the Cerritos manager could get in contact with the Orange manager. Finally we had gotten everything cleared and we got our free meal. Honestly HAIR IN MY FOOD IS A HUGE DEAL BREAKER. Never will go to the Orange BJs ever again. And Managers.. really? Learn how to give out giftcards! Youre a manager!"
Nakia B.,"Honolulu, HI",173,10,2,4.0,4/20/2015,Great ambiance. Good service. There is a good selection of beers at this location. Prices are good. The service was nice. Could have been a little quicker but no real complaints. Only had the goat cheese flatbread. I'd come back. Lightning needs to be brighter.
Amethyst P.,"Anaheim, CA",7,13,2,5.0,3/12/2015,"This place is always busy for a reason. Great prices. We have a giant Italian family and folks are always visiting us in Southern California. BJ's has great food, great drinks and plenty of TVs for sports fans and is an easy way to guarantee a good night out with friends and family."
May V.,"Irvine, CA",53,7,,1.0,4/10/2015,Told the wait was 30-40...turned into 2hr wait... nice gals at the front but dont tell me 30-40 when my party and I have been waiting for 2hrs. You are lucky that we still stay around instead of leaving...
Roman M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/11/2014,"My biggest mistake was returning to this BJ's location. I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant in my entire life! It began with waiting for about 45 mins to be seated, next taking another 15-20 mins to get a water and then having server spill the water all over our group, I'm sure it was an accident but he didn't really seem remoursful and just left towels for US to wipe up the mess. Next my group of 5 ordered some beers with the exception of 1 he is under 21, the server then got us the beer and took down our food order, next thing we know he accused us of giving our under age friend our beer simply because the beer was near him! (um yeah I'm sitting next to him where do you want me to put my beer?) i mean he could have just asked that i move my beer or something but he was almost yelling at us. And once our food arrived he didn't give us utensils to eat with had to ask him twice all the while our food is sitting getting cold! Any way our night out here was honestly my WORST experience eating out in my life (except for that one time in Mexico lol) but i would never recommend this location to any one AVOID at ALL COST.  I have reached out to the BJ's company and i have yet to hear back which is very disappointing considering they have a cooperate office in HB, I guess they don't care about their customers or customer service."
Andy R.,"Murrieta, CA",9,23,2,1.0,3/5/2015,"The host was extremely rude, waited 10 minutes after we were seated to even get noticed. The manager came by to make it right, we got our food and waited 7 minutes to get 2 silverware sets and  plates. Worst BJ's I've ever been too by far. The restaurant was not that busy."
Nora S.,"Wilmington, CA",113,15,8,5.0,9/22/2015,"i was at your location for the live taping of petros & money show am570 and we were served by tara. she did an amazing job with serving us and david was great as well convering her while off on break. two great working servers. will def come back to this location. traveled from torrance, ca"
Adrena R.,"Tustin, CA",51,44,16,5.0,3/2/2015,"Rafael Is the most awesome server! We came to this BJ's for the first time and were BLOWN AWAY, he knows the food, he knows the drinks, we never had to ask for anything... I would ask to sit in his section. I live close by and work even closer and I will be back for sure! What a great time! It is really amazing how much of a difference a good customer service experience makes a meal. 5 stars all the way!"
Jane L.,"Whittier, CA",0,12,3,1.0,8/6/2014,"Only one star because the calamari and corn fritters were good. I'm just going to put what I wrote to corporate: I'm writing to tell you the worst experience and worst customer service I have ever had at BJ's. My bf and I decided to go to BJ's in Orange yesterday at 3pm to celebrate my new job. We ordered calamari and corn fritters for appetizers and those were delicious and came out to us in no time. Disaster struck when our small half bbq chicken pizza and half bj's favorite pizza was brought to out table. Melissa M. our server placed it on the table and my bf and I spoke up and said the bbq chicken side does not look right. It was missing cilantro and red onions. And her solution was to bring us some cilantro but said if it tasted weird she would replace it for us. My bf and i were starving so we decided to just try it anyway since the other half was okay. IT WAS DISGUSTING. Worst pizza ever and you could not even taste the bbq sauce. When Melissa came back to check on us we told her it was disgusting and said, ""I'm sorry guys that sucks,"" and walked away. As a loyal customer to BJ's for 4years it was extremely insulting. And every time I've had problems with my food, the server would replace it with no questions asked. But at this one, she said she would replace it if it was disgusting, we told her it was disgusting, and she did  nothing about it. And to top it all off when she was leaving the check she tried so hard to upsell us on dessert because she knew the pizza was so bad so ,"" have some dessert to make it better."" NO THANKS. The only reason we didn't bring this up to a manager is because our appetizers filled us up enough to just say f"""""" it. I'm not one of those people who tries to get free things but I only want to pay for the right thing i ordered. Rude server, shitty food. Thanks for ruining my celebration day Melissa. tl:dr This location sucks and fuck your cilantro."
Gabriel R.,"Studio City, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/17/2016,"Worst dining experience in the last 10 years. Sat in the bar. The only table available was dirty. No problem. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Finally sat down anyway. Dirty dishes still there. Watching the game. Dirty dishes. Waiting. Finally cleared. Want a beer. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. We are finally noticed. Order beer and artichoke hearts. My beer comes. I ask for a chilled glass. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Beer now warm. No glass. Artichoke hearts come. Bite into them. Middle is frozen solid. Flag down our ""waitress"". Tell her the artichoke hearts are frozen. She says ""oh.""  Takes them away. Still no glass. I get up. Walk to the bar myself and get my ""chilled"" glass. It's burning hot, right out of the dishwasher and smeared with who knows what. Say thanks but no thanks. Walk back to my table. Now my beer is warm. Fine. Order the Parmesan chicken. Finish my beer. My warm beer glass comes. New order of artichoke hearts come too. Outside of them are burned. Fine. Chicken comes. I ask for a water. Chicken is a chunky mess of grizzle and who knows what. Totally under cooked and almost raw. I ask a second waitress for water. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Eat a few burnt artichoke hearts and some of the mashed potatoes. Still no water. Ask for the check. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Water comes from second waitress. Water also comes from first waitress. Now I have 4 waters and I'm paying the check. Maybe I was being filmed for one of those funny shows. I don't know. But I can tell u this, my dog would turn her nose up to their slop on a dirty plate."
Yesenia H.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",53,1,4,5.0,8/26/2013,"Went on a Saturday 8/24 around 9pm. The wait time was short, greeter and server were really good. The waitress got our food right, got it in a descent time nice & hot! Food tasted good! Drinks were delish! The waitress came and checked on us the right amount of times too, if i know what i mean! Overall good experiece, will be coming back!"
Brent L.,"Anaheim, CA",6,21,1,3.0,1/26/2015,"Typically, a 4 to 5 star experience.  The service was 5 stars, as usual.  Very accommodating even switched the TV so we could watch the Australian Open.  The food ... specifically the pizza has decreased in quality.  Twice, the pizza was mostly dough.  Bad dough to cheese ratio especially for the price and for it being one of their signature items.  I never ask or will accept a comp, just correct and I will be back to hopefully give a 5 star review."
Shirin M.,"Santa Ana, CA",263,51,68,3.0,1/26/2015,"I'm writing this review as more of a warning for online orders than anything else. I've had great service at this restaurant when dining in but have never had them receive an order correctly when calling in a pickup order. However, I can't blame this particular restaurant itself. Turns out that BJ's has a call center when you call them. You do not automatically get connected with the restaurant you are ordering from and there always seems to be some mix up between the call center and this particular restaurant. This is why I'm giving it an average of 3 stars."
