Michelle R.,"Anaheim, CA",1033,1879,9616,4.0,5/27/2016,"BJ's is a casual eatery, known for their deep dish pizzas, their beers and their pizookie. The restaurant started in Santa Ana, California and now they have locations nationwide. Over the years, their menu expanded, and added things like sandwiches and even fish n chips.  I was craving fish n chips, and stopped by the Orange location, at the Outlets of Orange. Our server was bubbly, and started off with drinks. I didn't come for the famous pizzas because wanted the fish n chips, and I also knew we had to end our meal with a pizookie, a dessert that is a combination of a pizza and cookie (hence, pizookie) The fish n chips were nice, hot and fresh, and their skinny fries (the width of a match stick) was so addicting.  Some people may like ""regular"" fries like McDonalds or the thicker fries you would get in a traditional fish n chips, but I really liked the skinny fries. After dinner, Karen and I decided to share the mini trio pizookie: 2 signature chocolate chips for each of us, and a monkey bread pizookie to share.  The chocolate chip is their original pizookie, and it wasn't until recently they added the monkey bread, which is a cinnamon bread (think cinnabun) without the icing.   Overall a good meal, and decent service.  When we left, the place was packed and the line was out the door.  Plenty of parking, and food was good, although I thought it was a bit pricey for what you get."
Jazmin M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,12,,2.0,12/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I love Bjs. We always get the same thing when we go just because we can never get enough: boneless wings as an appetizer, half buffalo half BBQ. A mini great white pizza. Two, maybe four beers. Depends who's driving. We normally go to the HB location on beach Blvd, but we decided to stop by here after a movie a couple nights ago on a Sunday. We walk in and there's only 1 other couple waiting and we ask for a table for 2. The hostess tells us it'll be about 10 minutes. No problem. She takes our name down, or at least acts like she does. Around 15 minutes after sitting there we haven't been seated. We choose to be patient, I've been a hostess before and I know 10 minutes isn't always exactly 10 minutes. After having waited like 25 minutes another male host asks us ""are you guys waiting for a table?"" And we say yes. He asks for the name and he can't seem to find it on their list and when he asks the other hosts she just shrugs her shoulders and walks away. He then immediately seats us at at table closest to the host stand. Keep in mind that all the that tables around where were seated are empty. There's only a party of 3 next to us. The server then comes over and takes down our drink order. We order waters since we haven't decided on which beer to have. It takes her about 15 minutes to come back with the waters. By this time we're ready to order drinks and food. We always know what we want. Like I've stated earlier, we always get the same things. When our wings arrive, they hardy have any sauce on them and they're cold. They've definitely been sitting on that window for a good 10-15 min. We send them back. We don't mind them being microwaved, we just don't want cold wings. Our pizza then arrives and we're sitting on the table without sauce and with out extra plates. Our server doesn't stop by for about 10 minutes after our pizza has arrived, we've been waiting to order ranch off her and extra plates. We finally get the plates and ranch and we eat the pizza. Our wings arrive afterwards. Much better temperature and all. We then sit there, and sit and the waiter doesn't stop by at all. We then flag her down and we ask for the bill. I watch her walk over to a computer, print out something and then stare out into the distance and walk into the back of the restaurant. 10 minutes later our check finally arrives. She tells us ""thanks for waiting, I got you guys some sweet discounts for the wings coming out bad."" We look at the bill and the only discounts are for my beer and the pizza, which naturally are already discounted for us dining during happy hour. Like do you think were dumb? Lol  The hostess service was bad and the server was just plain slow. Probably not coming back to this location. The HB location is always amazing."
Ema V.,"Fullerton, CA",43,124,72,2.0,7/17/2017,"Came here on a Tuesday during happy hour. There was open table in the bar that needed to be cleaned. So I walked over there to wait for someone to help clean it. A couple servers and a manager walked by and nothing happened. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was happy hour and you can clearly tell they were busy. Finally I made eye contact with a manager and he asked a server to come bus the table. As we were waiting for the table to get bused the server dropped a knife on my foot, which wasn't the best feeling in the world. Yeah I know you are probably thinking that I shouldn't have been so close to the table, well I wasn't, he was rapidly wiping down the table and didn't notice the knife, so it flew a couple feet over to where we were standing.  We get sat and they bring our drinks out. We order our food, and food was meh. I am totally okay with going to places if service is whatever as long as food is great. But service was meh and food was meh. I might have felt differently if we came at a slower time, but BJ's food really doesn't wow me anymore. Even their staple pizzokie, was over cooked and my ice cream was melted before it came to the table. Basically didn't have the best experience this visit and it makes me not wanna come back."
Chris P.,"Anaheim, CA",1,105,26,4.0,10/15/2017,Food was good nothing special though they changed the menu again but still needs more chicken entrees that aren't-deep fried. Our waitress was wonderful and very helpful.
Jonathan Q.,"Anaheim, CA",482,77,10,2.0,5/15/2017,"The first time I ever had BJ's was in Temecula, and I remember their service, the food, the atmosphere, everything about it was great. They were still figuring things out but I remember having the bar set so high and every other BJ's matched that... Until this one. I've been here three times now and honestly if it weren't for the food I'd just stop coming altogether, and for how late it's open. This last time we got seated, it took almost 10 minutes for someone to realize we hadn't been helped and it wasn't even our server. Then my drink came out, but not my friend's and there were no waters which we had ordered. Then our actual server comes out with the wrong drink for me but has the rest of the drinks, our two glasses of water and my friend's drink. Awesome, now we just wait for the food. Couple minutes pass and our food gets here and is correct and great-tasting. My friend didn't say much about the pizza other than it was good. But as for me with the Parmesan crusted chicken, it felt there was no flavor to it, as well as the cheddar mashed potatoes. Not that it was dry, just lackluster. I still ate it because I was hungry and wasn't going to order something else and wait longer, but just wish I had more of a better taste in my mouth than a full stomach of no taste. Consistently though, the service hasn't been the greatest with waiting for more than a couple minutes for a waiter to take our drinks. As well as our regular order. The food and drinks come out at a reasonable time, but given the wait time just to get a server is pretty bad. I'm not sure if it's just because of our age and nobody wants to take our table because of that, which I think is unfair, or just lack of communication. Either way, it needs to be addressed as it wasn't that busy when we had gotten in."
Jake S.,"Newport Beach, CA",40,4,,5.0,11/13/2017,"BEST EXPERIENCES. The staff here is amazing and is very quick. I can't even begin to say all the wonderful things, but this has become my favorite place to go out to at night and even just to go pick up food. My favorite is the Hickory Brisket Burger. It makes my life complete.  And they once offered us drinks on the house just because the fries were like 2 minutes late.  So yeah, if you're going anywhere for great food and great service this is the place!"
Diane T.,"Chicago, IL",4,37,,2.0,7/12/2017,"Not the greatest chain and there are plenty of reasons why. Let's start with the limited good points: lots of parking, decent beer selection Now onto the cons:  Ordered drinks, friend ordered a Patron tequila drink and when she got it she noticed that it was not Patron. The waiter then asked her if she was sure and if she had had a cocktail from Bjs before. She knows her Patron, trust me. It would've been nice if he didn't actually question what she tasted.  The quinoa side was really dry, and very unappetizing. The peanut soba noodles were extremely saucy and salty.  Ordered a clam chowder and didn't get any oyster crackers to help cut the saltiness of the chowder.  Ah well. I sound like an old grumbling pessimist, but it really wasn't that great. It's located in the outlets, there are plenty of other places to eat. Won't be going back."
Zachary M.,"Santa Ana, CA",93,3,1,5.0,4/14/2017,The systems were down but the entire staff kept their cool! Still exceptional service! Joel behind the bar was great! Other guest were aggressively rude. Food took awhile but still amazing! The manager on the floor was Keeping everybody calm and he was very professional. I think his name was Josh?? Keep up the great work guys! Service like this Keeps me coming back year after year!
Shanice J.,"Garden Grove, CA",113,28,33,4.0,6/14/2017,Love coming here on Tuesdays for the $3 pizookies .. Got a decent parking spot too. Our waiter was nice to me and my friends too
Truong T.,"Orange, CA",643,1245,3079,3.0,4/10/2016,"I'm told they have great happy hour here.  However I just wanted to try this pizookie everyones been talking about.  I actually live really really really close to this place but I've never exactly been here.  I'm not sure why.  So anyways on this particular night I made my way through for a tasty treat.   The atmosphere wasn't bad at all.  The décor is nice and the service was excellent.  Completely the opposite of what I was anticipating.  The pizookie was pretty good.  It definitely didn't disappoint at all.  It was too much, however, and I couldn't finish it myself.  It is overly sweet but that was already expected.  Nice texture and the presentation was pretty solid.  I however, wouldn't get it too often as it is a bit too much of sugar rush for me.   Overall, its a nice place to chill out and hang out.  The beer selection is nice, the service is good and the décor is pretty clean and solid.  There are some better options in the area but pizookie though will probably have me coming back again."
Sophia L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",256,5,,1.0,10/23/2017,"Had the worst customer service experience ever at this location. Order was taken by the server, and the food was brought out by other people. There was a problem with the food so we waited for our server to come by again-but she didn't. We were starving so ate and waited over 20 min after eating, no one showed up. We decided she may have left so went up the the waitress station to ask if we could get the check. Meanwhile-our waters were not refilled even once and our server seemed to be MIA. Finally, we saw her (for the first time since ordering our food), and she brought the check. Have no idea where she was the whole time. We wanted to order dessert but was sick of waiting so we ended up paying and leaving. Very disappointed in the lack of attention or service, and neglect overall."
Nancy V.,"Anaheim, CA",4,33,9,5.0,7/13/2017,Good for date night or even if you just want a drink at the bar. Staff is always nice and attentive. The bartender today joylynn was especially friendly and attentive. She recommended me a vegan lentil soup and it was truly amazing !  I had golden road wolf IPA bomb !!!!  Always nice and clean !!!
Alejandro C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",35,6,,1.0,10/28/2017,We've been sitting at a dirty table for over ten minutes and servers have just been walking by not even acknowledging the fact that we've been sitting here with a bunch of dirty plates and cups. A busboy then comes and snatches a to go container that was left her previously without saying a word to us. We must be invisible
J R.,"Rego Park, NY",0,5,,1.0,10/27/2017,"This BJs is the absolute worse. We were seated quick but it took 15 minutes for a server to come to our table, her order computer froze and it took her an additional 17 minutes to find a replacement. Upon returning to our table she did not ask for our order she told us she was going on break and someone else would be helping. 10 minutes minutes later we were introduced to the new server but our order was not taken, 10 minutes after that she came to take our order.  This is ridiculous, not only did we experience horrible service the table was dirty and there were dirty napkins under the table as well. Management should be embarrassed!"
aaron m.,"Orange, CA",1,14,,5.0,6/26/2017,We stopped in for a quick bite and craft beer.  Alli was our waitress and she took very good care of us  Loved the sour beer
Kevin H.,"Anaheim, CA",2,2,10,5.0,12/10/2017,Great selection of vegan and vegetarian options..the barbacoa cauliflower tacos are amazing.. service is great at the bar and very friendly bartenders !! Especially Miranda...she is awesome !!!
Andrew D.,"Teaneck, NJ",96,82,40,1.0,9/21/2016,"So, tonight was my first time here at Bj's restaurant. My partner insisted to go because of their dessert. We were greeted by Whitney, who was very friendly and energetic. That was great! I ordered vodka cranberry, they make it the way I like it!'  Now for the food. It took more than 15 minutes for two appetizers to come out. Ok no big deal, we were just hungry. They were good. Now for the entrees, I ordered the roast beef sandwich no onions. I emphasized no onions 3 x!!!!. Finally our food comes and guess what onions. No big deal we told Whitney and said sorry and would take care of it. My partners burger got cold while waiting because it took 15 minutes for it to come out. During that time no manager stopped by to apologize. It made it seem like this was a norm. But my biggest pet peeve we were eating at an un prebussed table. All the dirty plates were still there. You guys need to train staff on prebussing.  Anyways, the only reason this is such a big deal is because I'm in restaurant management and my first time experience was extremely underwhelming.  Will I try it again? Yes, but not at this location. Train your staff! Prebus! Manager table visits! 2 minute check back! Go back to the basic steps of service! Attached are pictures of our dirty"
Alexa R.,"Orange, CA",340,27,6,1.0,2/28/2017,"Honestly, I used to love Bjs because of the atmosphere, food, and service. But this location has to be the worst one open, which is sad because this is down the street from my house. My family drove 2 hours to eat at a fun place and we decided on this location because of proximity to where I live, but unfortunately this experience made my aunt's birthday not the best one. Instead of naming every detail, I rather just list them so you can just get the idea how  unpleasant our experience was. We were a party of 8, you would think they would pay more attention to how they serve a medium sized party.  1. Our drinks were always watered down with ice because our server had to be reminded 2-3 times about refills 2. Our server failed to mention that you ""cannot take out the jalepenos"" on a specific burger, and my brother didn't receive a new order burger until everyone had completed their meals. They tried to ""customize him a burger"" to fit his needs and attempted to be nice BUT ended up charging us double the price as the original burger he had ordered 3. I told the server it was my aunt's birthday and asked her to bring people/candle to sing-- she forgot and just brought out the pizookie, then went BACK to go look for a candle, then left without any regards to what I asked 4. They billed us wrong and duplicated orders on the menu 5. (This wasn't to us) But we witnessed the manager move a small family to another table as they were eating to fulfill the needs for a ""bigger party"" Basically, the food is okay. But the servers/service is very unsatisfying. Will not be coming back to this location or recommending it. We will just go to Brea Bjs instead."
Keyrah T.,"Lake Forest, CA",65,25,4,4.0,6/28/2017,"Our server was Brian and he is the type of server that makes you want to come back. He was warm, friendly and attentive. I arrived slightly earlier than my companion and Brian got my drink order and a couple of waters. When my companion asked about a menu item they used to have, he had a great system that he could look up offmenu items right at the table. This made my companion extremely happy since he had been talking about it all day (open face chili burger). Brian was quick and efficient while making us feel like a priority.  The food was excellent. I used this as a last supper so to speak before going in to surgery and they did not dissapoint! Great food and amazing beer selection. The only reason they get 4 stars is maintenance issues. Many of the umbrellas outside had large rips or tears in them and the womens bathroom was a bit messy, but I chalked that up to the lunch rush."
Vivian C.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,4,1,5.0,10/2/2017,"TARA IS THE BEST! She was so funny, lovely, and patient  with our big party of 12 adults and 7 babies all under 4 years old. She made our whole experience so awesome and really went the extra mile to make our out of the country family member very happy. We will definitely be returning for the great pizza and our delightful server. :)"
