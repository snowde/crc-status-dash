Talia P.,"San Diego, CA",2,7,1,2.0,3/24/2015,"My boyfriend and I ate there and we did not have a good time. We were seated quickly but then our food took a longer than usual time to get to our table. We didn't get utensils and had to walk to the host since we couldn't get any of the waiters attention. I got the Cajun Pasta, kinda bland. It's a lot better at CPK. Then we decided on getting a pizookie. Afterwards the waitress came with our check  because her shift was ending soon and she assured us that some other guy would take care of us. We waited another long time for the pizookie. We flagged down someone else. Then they brought the wrong one. It took another long time to get the pizookie we actually ordered. We left unsatisfied and pretty much crosses that off our future options to eat later."
Chelsa C.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,36,5,5.0,3/23/2015,"I dont see why this BJs has such a low rating.. My server was very nice, and no problems with my visit at all. Very was very good as well. I was actually surprused how nice the people were and the interior, just because of the location. Definitely will be returning"
Willy M.,"Cypress, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/1/2014,"HORRIBLE. I came here with some co-workers after work on Saturday night to get a nice meal and hangout. Bad idea to come here.  BJ's is known for a nice restaurant with good food and service but when we were seated it took about 20 minutes for us to realize no one had even ACKNOWLEDGED us so we called over a server to at least bring us some water and order an appetizer. Then our server CALVIN introduced himself and walked away. Some the same first server (not our own) brought us our appetizers and we just decided to order from him because it was a while since we've seen Calvin. Then another server brought us our food and we ate. Food was good but nothing will raise this 1 star due to the service. Calvin still failed to serve us but had time to serve all his tables around us. He then came back and. Without even asking us how we're doing, asked how many boxes we needed and we just said 3. He dropped them off and walked away. We spoke to the manager and just told him we weren't satisfied with our server Calvin and he apologized. Calvin then took our check and didn't split it like we asked then when he returned he literally THREW the check over my shoulder and it plopped on our table and he walked away without saying a word. HORRIBLE I hope He is gone because no one should have to be ""served"" by him. If I could I would give this 0 stars."
Joe A.,"Anaheim, CA",1,3,,5.0,6/7/2015,"Bjs is always our favorite restaurant to come to when we are close to home. I'm currently a new ""yelper"" but id like to take a second and say on the countless times we've come to this location the servers are always friendly and a great help as far as giving some advice on whats new or their favorites. Have been her for birthdays, date nights, after work at the bar with co workers to catch a game and always leave satisfied! Tonight our servers name was Samantha D! she was friendly, very attentive and provided great customer service to my girlfriend and I.  We are leaving extremely full and satisfied as well!!!"
Jessica I.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,2,,1.0,4/4/2016,"Being 3 months pregnant, ordered a heavy fully craved dish. They got it wrong, so I got an extra side of the correct order. The waitress asked me if I was sure I wanted to eat so much carbs Looking at my torso. It ruined my day! I got called fat when I was trying to subdue my cravings. Didn't eat much. Almost cried probably the hormones."
Steven U.,"Honolulu, HI",1031,244,1843,1.0,10/17/2013,"I am a big fan of chicago style pizza and the closest west coast substitute is BJs.  Most BJs restaurants are a machine, meaning they have everything pretty much down to a science.....this one?  Not so much.  Service was terrible.  The waiter couldn't even remember to bring water.  Our food order was right, but it took a long time to order, having been sat right away.  The worst part was my pizza was under done.  I have never had an under cooked pizza from a BJs restaurant before.....not tasty. Never saw a manager the whole time we ate.  I got up to let one of the little girls out to use the restroom and as I was watching her slide out an older man confronts me and gets in my space and says 'Can I help you' It was sarcastic and rude and he was not smiling.... I thought it was a drunk guy or someone looking to brawl.  The Spidey sense went off right away and though my fists clenched right away, I thought better to talk my way out of it because I had little kids with me.  I just said 'Oh sorry just getting up to use the restroom'.  His reply was ' Ok well just let me know if you need anything.'  It was the flippin manager.....the scary guy was the manager.....I was so shocked I didnt know what to do.  Used the bathroom and got out of there. 1 star....yeah not going back."
Alex P.,"Long Beach, CA",10,58,20,1.0,12/23/2014,"Piss poor service here. Staff is rude, service is slow as all hell. Food was nasty and burned. Don't even bother telling staff about service they will simply tell u they can't help you and not help you with anything. Don't bother with this place."
Chautaqua C.,"Orange, CA",5,37,15,4.0,1/25/2015,Great service tonight. Waitress was excellent and the spring rolls and artichoke bites were yummy!
Hughes H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,7,5,1.0,10/13/2014,"We arrive and find seats in the bar area. The waitress took 12 minutes to get us menus and another 12 to get place settings. The blonde waitress asks us what we want to drink and leaves abruptly before we finish ordering. When she comes back ten minutes later, We order appetizers, a large deep dish, and a custom pizza. Our appetizers come out quickly followed by large pizza. Half way through the large pizza, we ask the waitress for the individual pizza for our friend and she replies rudely, ""What pizza? Oh it will be right out."" We finish all of our food and the pizza has yet to show after 40 minutes. She avoided our table until the pizza was finally ready which she brought over and said, ""here it is.""  There was no apology or explanation for the delay. If it was a packed house, it may be understanding though there were only a few tables here and there. The service was a grand disappointment.  BJs are generally good, though I would not recommend this location to anyone unless you want your food late on an empty night."
Mary M.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,1,1.0,10/1/2014,"We've been here since 7pm and it's 9:25, our server was Jay Tee, we ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, not complicated at all. It took over about an hour for our food to arrive, we did get offered a soup but arrived the same time the pizza got here. Other people ordered pizzas and got there's, even though we got here before them. At the end, we didn't get charged for the pizza we asked for a box but Jay Tee is currently to busy talking to other customers, right in front of us. We are better off at Olive Garden next time. If you're in a rush, this isn't the place to go on a slow night."
Erin F.,"Los Alamitos, CA",197,29,6,4.0,1/20/2015,"Came here on a Wednesday during lunch hour. Party of 3 got seated right away. I order the cherry chipotle glazed salmon, served with asparagus and cuscus; IT WAS DELICIOUS, so good!! I drank about 5 glasses of water while we sat there about an hour and the waitress always came to refill it, thank you! Oh, I also started with the beet and arugula salad, which was also very delightful and tasty! Definitely try that! Seriously, the food was great. Not just because I was starving; it was good!"
Bob D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,25,,1.0,9/29/2015,"We went on Saturday afternoon about  2 pm . They were busy. This is the second time I have been to a BJ's , The service is bad ( seems like they are understaffed on purpose) Our pizza order came out wrong. We finally got a new pizza. It was mediocre at best, Took forever to get a check or get water refills.. I would go somewhere else"
Johnathan n.,"Huntington Beach, CA",32,38,11,2.0,12/5/2014,"I always had good experience at this location except for tonight. I came and at the greeter, Adriana, if happy hours were still happening, well she said ""We don't have happy hours anymore."" I was like ""you guys don't have happy hours anymore ?"" Then she turned it around and said ""it's Saturday!"" Then I replied: ""Isn't it Friday tonight?"" I also asked for a table of 6 & she said: ""Can you check in over there ?"". Sure, I would never expect that kind of service from this kind of restaurant. However, when we got seated, our server, Rachel, who is super nice."
Silvia D.,"Santa Ana, CA",69,200,46,1.0,6/14/2015,"Worst customer service ever!  I came in with my husband and baby this afternoon. As soon as we walked in, we noticed there were no people waiting for tables, so we figured it'd be fast to get seated. Well, fast forward to 15 minutes later, we finally get seated. Supposedly, they were waiting for a table to accommodate a high chair. However, once seated, we noticed multiple booths and tables that were able to accommodate a high chair. We also noticed people seating outside... Which, the hostess explained to us that there was no servers outside. I asked to speak to a manager, because of that observation. Jesse, the manager on duty, came over, and I explained my frustration. He apologized, but his reasoning didn't seem to make sense. We were not satisfied customers at that point, but we decided to stay anyway. Once he took our order down, our actual server didn't come check on us. Our food too too long to arrive, our server only came by twice! Once, to bring napkins, and for the check. I even had to make direct eye contact for him to come pick up the check that had been tests for him for a while. It's safe to say, I won't be returning to this BJ's. They need to step up their customer service. It was ridiculous!!!!"
Terry M.,"Seal Beach, CA",277,15,2,5.0,3/28/2015,"Not sure why this BJ's is getting a low rating. My girlfriend and I are regulars and we have not had one bad experience. The staff has always greeted us with smiles and each waiter we've had has been above par. I love the Great White with a Tatonka. We don't mind the wait, although it's never been more than 20 mins. Great job staff!"
Lisa C.,"Orange, CA",25,159,,4.0,9/2/2013,"Went for lunch today. I was impressed. Our server Zach was awesome, very knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The beer was good as always, get the hef. The sampler appetizer is huge and very good. I loved the southwest egg rolls. We each got our own small/mini pizzas and I got a small Caesar too. My salad was so yummy. Pizza was very good as well. Overall great experience, will have to come back."
Dustin A.,"Newport Beach, CA",15,7,1,4.0,2/10/2015,I like to go here before my classes or after and enjoy a brew with some good appetizers.  Always friendly great service.
Sharon D.,"Garden Grove, CA",195,5,25,2.0,8/30/2015,"Seems like it's always a miss whenever i go to BJ's... The service is subpar. Our table was not wiped down enough so the host had to come back with a towel. Menu was STUCK. There was so much grime in between the pages of the menus we received, you could feel all the stickiness and hear it too.Our ""server"" took our order and then he wasn't our server anymore? I'm just as confused as you are. Our order was taken and many times he walked by not acknowledging us and our empty drinks. I also asked for horseradish and steak sauce which never came as i'm 3/4 done eating. Yeah, it's a Sunday night I understand that it is busy but if you are working a Sunday night, you should know how to do it right. It was hard to get anyone's attention. When i finally got another server's attention at the END of our meal she then told us ""oh i'm actually going to be your server now"". Note: it's not like the guy who took our order went home, he was still in the restaurant walking back and forth. It would have been nice if we were informed beforehand instead of being left hanging."
Iluvmyporkies I.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,70,24,2.0,6/18/2014,"The food is like all the other Bj's what makes this location horrible is the service it tooks us over 2 hours to eat dinner at 7 pm on a Monday! Just in waiting for our waitress, drinks, food all we did was wait wait wait and service was horrible by the waitress and the people bringing our alcoholic drinks and food I will never go to this Bj's again"
Taylor A.,"Temecula, CA",3,23,2,5.0,1/4/2015,"Our server was Patrick, he was wonderful, he was very attentive and provided great customer service. He always had a smile on his face,  he made sure we had everything.  If we lived closer to this one we would go back. Food was great, drinks are alway superior.  All in all great time."
