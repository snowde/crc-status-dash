Hilda A.,"Burbank, CA",271,271,77,2.0,12/9/2014,"Very unfriendly and unaccomodating service. The place says open until midnight but if you come in after 11 they treat you horribly. We came at 11:30 and there was no seating hostess, and the waitress told us we have 15 min before last call. I told her we were there for just an appetizer and a desert for my boyfriends birthday. I asked for a pizookie and a candle and they brought it out with the beers before the appetizers. She didn't bring us utensils, napkins, or waters. We felt uncomfortable and rushed the entire time and we left by close when others were still there. Not the kind of service that should be given to customers, especially considering there are plenty of other places at the block that are open late and actually care about customer service."
Valerie H.,"Hemet, CA",65,20,1,2.0,1/21/2016,"Went here last night after a Ducks game. Not the typical BJ's.  The employees seem angry and put out serving you which really makes for an uncomfortable dining experience.  I ordered a Pepsi and I could taste the aspartame and knew instantly it was a diet drink. I can't stand the after taste of any diet beverage and I recognized it instantly. I asked the server if I could get regular because I accidentally received diet. She was instantly annoyed and offended. The second drink tasted the same. I had my son, daughter and husband taste it and they all confirmed it was definitely diet. I literally did not want to tell the server because I knew it would be a problem.  When she came back I asked for an ice tea and said there was still something wrong with it. She got very defensive stating aggressively it was regular Pepsi causing my whole family to respond that it was definitely diet. I said I can definitely taste the aspartame but maybe the lines were switched to the machine.  She seemed baffled by that comment and my husband and I both said we used to work in a restaurant where that happened often, but either way, can I just get an ice tea? Begrudgingly I got a tea. My husband ordered broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl which had 3 full spoonfuls of soup. Total waste of money there. He asked for crackers to go with the soup and never received them. The final cherry on the cake was the server talking to other employees and pointing  at our table and laughing.  Keep laughing because eventually you won't have a job when you no longer have customers.  I won't ever come back to this location. It's expensive enough eating out and tipping a crappy server.  Why waste my hard earned money on this type of service. We could not wait to get out of there. My son has a slight studder  and when he asked the server for ketchup she was rude to him and essentially made fun of him because she couldn't understand him.  Pretty horrific service."
Stephanie B.,"Downey, CA",2,21,15,4.0,12/26/2014,I've been here a few times since my last review and they have all been pretty successful.  The waitresses/ waiters were always prompt and my food has not come out cold.
Ray W.,"Orange, CA",33,28,20,4.0,1/21/2015,"Great service. Fresh food. Nice vibe. Good place for a biz lunch. And the wifi works! I like the soup lunch deal - free soup and beverage refills. Can't beat that. And the service was excellent the last time I was there. Easy to miss - BJ's is next door to TGIF, at The Block."
Jess S.,"Chino Hills, CA",69,100,1,4.0,10/24/2014,"I don't know why this place has really bad reviews. I came during a week day lunch and the service was good. The food was also good as I got a half sandwich and soup. Their lunch specials are worth the price. Maybe the service is really bad on weekends? No idea, but I had a good experience here."
Mely D.,"Anaheim, CA",5,8,,4.0,2/27/2015,"The food is so good here , I would definitely recommend the pizookie, they can work on their customer service tho"

Vanessa S.,"Anaheim, CA",9,9,5,2.0,7/15/2014,"I've been to many BJ's restaurant locations and have usually had a great time with food, drink and atmosphere.  My friend suggested we try the new location at the Orange Outlets last Wednesday night. It was a hot day and I thought it was a great idea to get a frosty drink and perhaps a pizza.  The location is beautiful and bustling.  Seated right away, already noticing not much air conditioning, not so great. Had a first day waiter but he had his trustee trainer along for the ride.  We ordered the handcrafted sodas which took some time to arrive and tasted great but were served with NO ICE, WHAT?  I ordered an individual pizza with a topping you can't get just anywhere: roasted brussels sprouts and a wedge salad.  My friend ordered the ribs and asparagus.  First the wedge comes out on a plate the size of a small teacup saucer, hanging all over the edges.  If you're a wedge salad fan you know you need to cut it up to eat it, right?  No room on this wanna-be plate to do anything.  So I waited for my pizza to come so I could use that plate.  The pizza comes, it is all misshapen, sort of like a hexagon where the two halves were sliding in different directions.  The waiter says ""Oh, sorry, they were playing around with it back there in the kitchen.""  WTF?  Okay, the shape shouldn't matter if it tastes good, yes?  No sauce, little sausage and the star of the show brussel sprouts were  only cut in halves and burnt like bad toast.  No flavor, little rocks, they were.  I ate enough to make room on my plate for the salad and ate the rest of that.  Over on my friend's plate, the asparagus were skinny and so limp it was sad.  She did say she enjoyed the ribs.  First time I have not taken the rest of a pizza home!! Not planning to return to this location, even though it's the closest for us.  Back to Brea, hopefully the quality has not dropped off there."
Moses P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/16/2014,"Go for deep dish pizzas, drinks and desserts. Steaks, burgers, sandwiches are also quite good. Truly, the service is not anything special. Stick to the basics and specialties and you will enjoy it well enough."
Be E.,"Anaheim, CA",0,20,4,2.0,2/11/2015,"Came here last night. I'm usually a fan of the place but the service was unexpectedly slow. I've had good service even on busy nights. It took a long while for our orders to come in. Also, I came for a birthday event and the waitress had forgotten our pizookie.  Other little things include not providing bags as we left so we had to stack our to-go orders. The lady at the front who takes our orders provided them for us.  Also, our original waitress said she was taking a break and had a new girl cater to us. Our original waitress never came back but she was still working within the area. New girl wasn't that great."
Elena B.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,17,3.0,12/31/2014,I always come here for quick dinners and to hang out with friends. I would say the beer and pizza is the best. Everyone is usually nice.
Victor G.,"Santa Ana, CA",187,11,23,1.0,6/12/2014,"Tried to use the call ahead service, the guy that answered the phone states that it's for parties of 5 or more so I reply, I need a table for 10, his reply, sorry sir the service is only for parties of 5 or more but we don't have a wait so if you'd like to come in we can sit you right away, last I checked, 10 is in fact a greater number than 5! 10 mins later, walk into the restaurant and we were quickly advised that it would be a one to one and a half hour wait!!! Seriously!!! BJs get it together!! Will not be back at all!!  Thank you  for wasting my time ""guy that answers phone""!"
Tracy E.,"Palm Springs, CA",90,166,128,2.0,9/21/2014,"Wow, not a good wow either. My friends and I went here for a late night meal. The service was extremely slow and our waiter seemed as though he didn't want to be there. He took our drunk order and we didn't see him again for close to 30 mins. When someone did come to the table again it was a different waiter. We placed our food order and waited another 30 mins for the food to arrive. When it did arrive it was cold."
Opinionated O.,"Westminster, CA",19,26,62,3.0,11/21/2014,"We called ahead of time and reserved our place but was told if it's more than 30"" then our names are removed! Unghhh! So we left our phone # so they can text us when table is ready. We came back about 5"" after receiving the text and still had to wait another 10"" so I'm not sure what's the point! But the most annoying thing was when we checked in, they made us wait and 10"" later another lady said ""last call"" for our name! Helllllooooo !?! Lack of communication here or what!?! I would have given them one star for front desk but our waiter and food/dessert was much better then the stupid imbeciles working in front so there you have it!"
Kevin W.,"Glendora, CA",23,4,,1.0,11/16/2014,"Worst BJ's I've ever been to, will never ever come back to this crap location!"
Danny N.,"Anaheim, CA",24,20,8,1.0,10/22/2014,"Terrible service! The hostess seated us and we waited 10 minutes for a server to greet us. No one came, so I went to the hostess and informed her. Waited another 5 minutes and still no service. I decided to leave after that. I would not recommend this location."
Paige O.,"Corona, CA",19,10,,4.0,1/27/2015,"It was my first time at this location and I enjoyed it very much. Food and service were both good. I was a little upset that they don't have calzones, but the pizza was good enough. And don't forget to save room for the Oreo pazookie."
Sydney P.,"Orange, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/7/2015,"I called in to make a reservation for my birthday dinner. I spoke with the MANAGER, gave him my information. He then gave me a confirmation. Had the table for 2 hours, all on one check, half my party must be present to be seated etc. Got there and my reservation was not on file. Had to wait the normal time for a table for 10, which was still forever. Once seated my waitress was very attentive, friendly, and served us very well and food arrived fast. I have always had good service here and I still stand by that, however the first and only time I have spoken to a manager, NOT PLEASANT. This is the only BJ's I go to, and I do not plan on having any more group parties there."
Sofia A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/1/2015,"I ordered a watermelon salad and a grilled salmon. The salmon came out burnt in the outside and raw in the center. I'm not a big fan of sushi; so, raw salmon is very unappealing to me. I started to eat the salad and asked our waitress if she could please ask them to cook the salmon a little more. She said I can ask them to make you another. I refused and said it is okay if they cook it a bit longer on the grill. I should've listen to her.  When the salmon came back, it was piping hot. I sure sign that it had been thrown in the microwave. The top was burnt and dry. The salad was covered in waterlike red substance and the lettuce once crispy was a soggy cooked mess. The watermelon chunks had shrunk to half their size and were hot, further proof that the entire plate had been thrown in the microwave without regard of how the crispy greens or watermelon would be affected. Frankly, I don't know why people work as chefs in a restaurant if the passion to cook is not in them. Why serve your customer something so gross?! Our server was nice and did a good job taking care of us; so, I didn't want to make an issue about it. But if you go to BJs at the Block of Orange, and you do not like your food cause it is raw; take your server's advice and do not send it back. Ask for another one or for a refund."
L A.,"Whittier, CA",1,36,3,4.0,11/3/2013,"I went last night. Overall, the food is okay and the service was descent. We waited for about an hour on Saturday night (which was fine), but the frustrating part was that many people were seated ahead of my party (7 people).  I had the bread-bowl clam chowder. I was surprised with how tasty the food was, as I never had anything but the pizza before."
