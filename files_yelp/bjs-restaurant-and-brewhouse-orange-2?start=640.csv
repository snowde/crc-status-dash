Adam J.,"Garden Grove, CA",47,20,1,2.0,9/19/2014,"Pretty disappointing experience here. We've been going to the Huntington Beach BJ's for years but just moved to this side of town and decided to come here for dinner. To begin, the service was pretty poor. Refills were slow, and at one point someone took my drink and didn't refill it before the main course had arrived. When food arrived, he left without giving utensils and napkins for the table. My sister got a buffalo chicken pizza and it came with more bbq sauce than buffalo... And when we asked about it, they explain that's how it's made. Again, we've been going to the Huntington Beach location for YEARS, and never has it come with bbq sauce on the buffalo pizza. That doesn't even make sense and it certainly doesn't say anything about it on the menu. Our pizzuki got here before the corrected food did. Pretty big bummer"
Thang V.,"Santa Ana, CA",379,34,24,1.0,6/24/2014,I have been to other bjs but this bjs had the worse service ever. My wife and I were seated. And after waiting for 30 minutes I had to raise my hand in order to get a waiter over to order drinks. Food took an additional 40 minutes to come out on a night where seats were literally empty. Do not recommend
Haylee T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,2,1.0,6/20/2016,WORST SERVICE EVER! DO NOT COME HERE. Our server was so slow! Finally got to order and the food took a while to come out. I also put in a mini pizookie order while I was still eating my pizza because i know it takes foreverrrr to bake. We waited and waited and the server didn't even come by our table to give us any updates. At times she was no where to be found!! Plus no one else on the floor to help. Finally was tired of waiting and needed to leave and she finally comes with our check. No mention of the pizookie until i asked and she said it was coming. Really?? I cancelled the pizookie and we wait even longerrrrrrrr for her to give us our new check. Surprise surprise she finally comes with our check and the pizookie magically appears. We didnt get charged for it but she said with attitude that we can have it or they'll just throw it away. Um no I dont want the pizookie anymore because i was so mad at how long we waited so we didn't eat it and left. Such bad service and everything is soooooo slow. Barely anyone in the restaurant!!!! The couple behind us with same server also complained because they were waiting forever for their flat bread. Will never come back to this location
Robert T.,"Anaheim, CA",11,45,79,1.0,6/6/2014,"Very poor service experience tonight. Upon entry at 9:45 PM, a 15 minute wait time was quoted, 15 minutes later we were seated. We were told by the friendly hostess that our server would be right with us.  We knew what we wanted and sat in our booth for 20 minutes while we watched three other tables seated after us receive service, drinks, and orders taken.  No one even acknowledged our presence, we got up and left, on the way out I told the hostess at the podium what had happened and her response was, ""Oh, I'm sorry, goodnight...""  What the heck has happened to the service at the Orange BJ's?"
Kevin C.,"Anaheim, CA",3,26,5,2.0,6/3/2014,I've been to a few BJs locations and this was by far the worse.  We ordered a chicken pasta and the order cama out wrong.  We had changed the sauce and it came out with the sauce we specifically said we wanted substitued. No refund or even an offer to take it back and get it right. On top of that the chicken was cold. It felt frozen which is weird because the waiter told us all the meat is never frozen which seems like a lie if our chicken was blatantly cold. Again no compensation. Other BJs locations are not bad but this one I will never visit again.
Jose R.,"Placentia, CA",5,4,3,1.0,6/23/2014,Worst restaurant ever. Terrible service the servers don't know what they are doing. Had a complaint about my cold pizza. Manager came out and said okay I guess we will comp your food. Food sucks always full and terrible service.
Dianna D.,"Orange, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/15/2016,"I have to give a one because Yelp won't let me rate this place a zero. Took a little more than an hour to receive some of our food. The people who did receive their food at my table couldn't start eating because we had no utensils. We finally flag down somebody for utensil and it took way too long for them to get back. They have a promotional deal on pazookies that we requested. We we're told that it was only one pazookie per table when on the promotional ad it says per check and we were all paying separately. Then we were avoided for another 20 minutes until they brought the last dish to our table. We flagged down our waiter and asked to speak to a manager. The manager takes another 20 minutes to approach and she seemed like she had a bad attitude the minute she approached our table. We told her about the poor service and how unsatisfied we were with it. She apologized grudgingly and offered us boxes for our food. She judged wanted us to leave which seemed pointless for us because we just got our food. We then asked her to put in the order for all of our pazookies ( this is the second time asking because we had already told our original waiter sam to do it) and she gives us the "" it's only one per table but because of how long the wait was I will do that"". I wasn't going to further argue that she wasn't doing me a courtesy and that she obviously had no clue what the promotional ad promised. 15 minutes later we ask another waiter to get us our waiter since we were being avoided. Now we have a new waiter and we asked him about our pazookie order that was suppose to be put in by the manager. This is our third time ordering the pazookies and we are being constantly told that it's ""almost"" out. We asked for our check and again we were avoided for another 20 minutes. Then the waiter comes with no pazookies and only our check. We never got the pazookies and it was ridiculous how the manager handled the whole situation. Very poor service , this is a chain restaurant so avoid coming to this location if you can."
Kenia C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,4,,4.0,7/25/2015,I'm so happy our table had James as a server. He seriously was a great server! He was extremely kind and helpful. I've been here before and I know there is generally a long wait for a table and then the food. I think the experience is a lot better when you have a good server and James was the best. Thanks James! (I give him 5 stars)
Abdul B.,"Anaheim, CA",3,14,,2.0,6/4/2014,"I love BJ's but there is something wrong with this location. I've been to BJ's in many different places but this one is definitely the worst. The service is always slow, and on top of that last time I was here the food was horrible. I always order their pizza in a different BJ's and I love it, but this time it was so bad to the point that I wouldn't pay $5 dollars for it."
Ti K.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/29/2016,"So i wasn't happy which goes to show you that even chain stores are run differently by each management team. I am a regular customer at bj's in general and like the place to eat. When I arrived, I was greeted by a tattooed gang member who had obviously just been released from the jail across the street aggressively panhandling. The employees should have seen this as it was 5 feet from their front door. I ordered an appetizer which was dropped off by a server, but without utensils. It sat on the table for 15 minutes getting cold before any server came by. The utensils showed up a few minutes later, and I sent the cold appetizers back. The meal showed up, which was a salmon dish over Cous Cous and asparagus. The asparagus was NOT trimmed, so I had to fight with the woody stems with every bite. The Cous Cous was over cooked and the bottom of the dish was under water, as if the salmon was served over wet, undrained pasta. After my meal was finished, the appetizer showed up again for dessert. There was no offer to comp that item, and again, at least one of us at the table had no utensils to eat the appetizer with since he had ordered a sandwich and no utensils were ever delivered for his meal. I paid full price for a total amature presentation, poor execution of the food and service that made me feel like no one could give a rip. I gave 2 stars only because of my prior food experiences at other bj's. Note to server, if a customer looks pissed, don't avoid the conversation...just go get the manager"
Samuel K.,"Garden Grove, CA",823,572,346,2.0,7/27/2014,"Came here recently for lunch hungry as hell. Large, elegant interior. I ordered their Brewhouse Double Deluxe Burger. It was one of the worst burgers I've ever put in my mouth. The double patties were oozing with grease with absolutely no flavor. All you tasted was grease. Everything else on the burger was hidden because of the overpowering crappiness of the meat. I ended taking out a patty but still same crappy taste. (0 stars). Drenching the burger in Ranch dressing didn't help.  The string fries were great and the veggie pizza was alright."
Christina U.,"Irvine, CA",136,12,,5.0,1/14/2015,Their takeout service is amazing. I ordered online for my food to be picked up an hour later and I got there and it was ready and packaged. Very impressed with their takeout service and the food was great.
Amber R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,19,7,1.0,8/26/2014,"Tonight was our first night here and prob our last. The service was horrible, the restaurant was pretty empty and we still waited a long time just to order. I didn't think we even had a waiter. We ordered drinks and our appetizer but the appetizer never came, it finally came with our dinner so we told the waiter to take it back. He still tried to charge us for it. I asked to speak with a manager and during the conversation he said I'll take care of it and walked away! While I was still talking to him. One of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. I can't believe this restaurant chain had service like this, even the manager was rude and inconsiderate."
Wythe D.,"Temecula, CA",3,54,3,3.0,5/8/2014,Three stars for me means: I wasn't pissed and didn't ask for the manager but I won't be back. Calamari was not crisp and yet it tasted like it was overdone - maybe the oil was old or had gotten burned but this was not good. Then the crispy veggie flatbread pizza was only crisp on edges and kinda soggy and limp in the middle - I eat a lot of pizza and a lot of vegetarian and this did not measure up. Server was attentive and my partner's BBQ chicken salad was good but it seems this location does not uphold BJ's standards. Even beer needed to be 5-8 degrees colder. Next time in the OC I'll try to find a Yard House.
Kaitlyn P.,"Santa Ana, CA",131,30,15,5.0,8/25/2014,"We sat in the bar, server was Janell, such a great server! We came during lunch and got happy hour and the 2 for 22 deal is back!  However....Yelp says that this location closes at midnight. I came here on Sunday at 11:13pm and the host told me they stopped seating and I had said, ""don't you close at 12"" and he was like ""ya but not today."" If the hours have changed there should be a sign somewhere.  That is so rude. But I'm not going to do a review on that day, since I had a great time this afternoon."
Mario P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2014,"Horrible service. Never I had I had to wait so long for food(about an hour) and then when the rest of my party was served I had nothing in front of me. The idiot waiter misunderstood me and didn't take my order so while everyone ate I just there. Then comes the enabling jackass manager and offers me a little soup for my troubles. I made an effort to be civilized and they brought me the soup I ate it but I still had to wait another hour for my meal even though they had assured me it would be quick. To make matters worse the waiter disappeared continously. I had to go to the front desk for the check and the manager, waited another 15 minutes and got my check but no manager. Left angry and hungry and left no tip on a group of 8 people. What a joke!"
Tony A.,"Anaheim, CA",54,1,,1.0,1/3/2015,"Was quoted 30 minutes for a table, been waiting over an hour for a table. Worst experience at a BJ's location, never again will we come back here. Ridiculous! Just paged us, waited another 5 minutes! Took us to a table that was outside, after we requested not being outside since it's 45 degrees out there and we have 3 kids."
Caitlin M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,27,37,4.0,1/3/2016,I've always enjoyed BJs.  The food is above average and the beer isn't bad.  I love the Berry Burst Cider most of all.  Service at this particular one is usually very slow.
Jhonny F.,"Orange, CA",3,3,,5.0,1/3/2016,This is by far my favorite place to eat... The whole staff is friendly and more then willing to accommodate. The food is great too. I will go out of my way to come here. The peanut butter smore  piezookie is the best. I get one every time.
Mike A.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,1,1.0,11/22/2014,Probably the worst service I have ever experienced. It was hard for me to get a refill cause the waiter was absolutely ignoring my table. I work in customer service so I understand at times it gets busy and therefore service is lacking but this place was just horrendous. And to top it all off the waiter charged the wrong amount to my card. Never returning again. Left him no tip because it was that bad but I just checked my bank statement today and he added himself a nice tip lol... Wow....
