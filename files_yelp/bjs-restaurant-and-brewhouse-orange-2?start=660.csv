Cristina D.,"Santa Ana, CA",101,45,33,2.0,7/26/2014,"The only menu items good here are the avocado eggrolls and pizookies.  I can't speak for the beer as I'm not a fan. Pizza is okay.  Breakfast Quesadilla? Yuck. How does one mess up breakfast? Even the salad comes soggy. I do enjoy that they have shoestring fries though. Service is horrible. My last experience 2 days ago, I waited 40 minutes to get my lunch AFTER putting in my order.  The waiter didn't stop by the table to ask how we're doing...until 40 minutes later when my food came - room temperature.  I keep trying to convince myself that I like BJ's or I'll find something I really love since it seems so many people like to eat or chill here. Nope."
Ben F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2015,"I was in tonight, everybody who we dealt with was professional and polite.  Unfortunately the Ahi Poke appetizer was off- the tuna was old and fishy with a mealy texture.  Then we found dark black specks in a soft drink glass.  We didn't wait for the entrees.  We paid and left.  The front of the house looks ok- but there is a big problem in back."
Bibiana L.,"Oceanside, CA",1,3,,1.0,11/16/2014,"This is the not the worst but one of the worst restaurants I have ever been too. We sat at a table outside Where it was really cold and windy. When I asked to have the heater turned on, that's when the server decided to let us know that the heater was broken. Awesome. I asked the host to get our party moved, she said anywhere outside would be fine, which that's whAt we did.after we moved to a different table, our server disapeared, and we didn't get our food for 40 minutes. When the food came out it clearly everything was over cooked and it clearly seemed like it was sitting on the window for quite a long time.  Overall really bad"
Gene S.,"Ontario, CA",17,8,4,1.0,2/7/2014,"What is the point of having a ""lunch special"" menu if it takes you over 2 hours to get in and out of the restaurant?  How many jobs do you know that give you and 2 hour lunch break? Seriously,  the service here was a joke today. my co workers (8 people total) took me here for my birthday lunch, big mistake. We were seated immediately, out on the patio, where it took about 15 mins for our waiter to come and take our order. We ALL ordered off the so called  lunch menu, which took 45 mins before the first dish arrived. During this time we asked about 15 times for refils on our water (everyone ordered water to avoid confusing refil orders) but to no avail. About 10 mins after the last bit of food was consumed, a waitress poked her head out of the door 20 feet away and shouted ""you guys want water?"" Didnt even come to our table to ask. So damn lazy. We asked for the check, our waiter asked if we wanted single checks for everyone, we said whatever was fastest we would take, he bragged about how smart he was by putting numbers next to our orders so he could split the check super quickly, we said ok to that. He left and never came back. 20 mins of waiting for the check we finally flagged down the manager, told her what was happening and how bad our experience had been, and she half heartedly apologized and said she was gonna give us some gift certificates for free meals in the future. She came back 5 mins later and told us she didnt have a gift certificates but would make take one dish off our total bill. Wtf. Seriously?  She clearly doesn't know what customer service is, nor does she care about getting return service. Anyways, the funny part was, my coworkers had ordered me a pazookie for my bday, that the absent minded waiter brought out to the table after we literally had already got up and started walking to the door, he looked at us weird and said ""so you guys dont want your pazookie anymore?"" Seriously bro? We didnt leave him a tip at all, but ill leave him one on here. FIND A NEW OCCUPATION BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT CUT OUT FOR THE SERVICE INDUSTRY.   Will never return to this establishment unless there is a giant sign out front that says ""under new management and staff"""
Caselyn I.,"Carson, CA",2,16,8,1.0,8/30/2014,"This review is on service... when walking in, we were greeted by a person that does not know how to smile... wow... i was pretty upset because I came in with a huge smile and got an expressionless face in return. Our waitress knew how to smile so great! But we waited FOREVERRRR for our food... we were going to leave because we were starving and couldnt take it any longer, but as we stood up our food arrived...probably took over 25 minutes to get our chicken lettuce wraps.... Pretty disappointed cuz this never happens at the other locations..."
Mary N.,"Anaheim, CA",136,93,17,4.0,8/25/2014,"First of all I love going to Bj's restaurants. My fiancé and I are big beer fans. And my friends and I came here to have dinner. Our waitress was a little slow, there were a couple times my friends soda was low and we had a steak that was asked to be cooked medium rare. The steak came very well done. We let the waitress know and right away she took it back. The manager came and apologized. That really impressed me. They brought back a bigger and cooked perfectly steak. They even took off one of the pazokiies we got on our bill."
Katie M.,"Buena Park, CA",1,11,3,5.0,11/3/2014,"I like going to BJs but this specific one honestly has the best service and food. First time we came here the service wasn't that good, not gonna lie the waitress was kinda sorta a bitch but it was a busy night so it doesn't count. But I've come back here and it's way better than the brea venue."
Ulysses R.,"Santa Ana, CA",16,16,5,1.0,5/31/2014,Horrible service! No utensils ... No napkins.. Long wait... Wrong pizza order... Cheesesticks no cheese!! No!!
Steve T.,"South Pasadena, CA",2,8,,5.0,11/2/2014,"We just had an awesome experience at BJ's orange county, the city drive. Manager Steve White and waiter Chris did an awesome job to take care of our party of 12 on the patio. They were attentive to our ambience in setting the table and lighting the fire. The service was prompt and professional. We were informed of their cool sound system that you can download for the football games to hear the audio over your phone . They researched and found our rewards card when we didn't have it. And most importantly they made my brother smile after a devastating 2 days across the street at UCI hospital.  Our family thanks Steve and Chris and the whole BJ's team what a way to earn business."
Alex D.,"Tustin, CA",1,4,2,1.0,5/30/2015,Pretty sure my clothes went out of style before I was served by the waiter. I was without a drink for about 10 minutes. Our waitress only came by about 2 times. Food was good on the plus but a lot of work needs to be done
Imran S.,"Queens, NY",125,113,47,4.0,3/28/2014,"What can I say about chain restaurants? There is usually a standard that needs to be held at these establishments and for as long as they uphold it then I can only state the obvious and that is: great ambience, great service, food tasted great and waitstaff was great. But, it's good to know that our waiter was understanding, gave us suggestions and very accommodating when our group of 6 couldn't make up their mind even for 10 minutes. The final icing is the infamous Pazookie! Order a small for taste appreciation and portion control ; it's rich and tasty so savor that last taste in your mouth for the day or for the rest of the evening. Great spot to go with the family and / or friends."
Huey L.,"Westminster, CA",34,3,,2.0,10/23/2014,"Went in for dinner today, ordered an medium rare steak and the steak came out well done, I been to this location multiple times before and every single time, there seems to be an issue with the service here. The food always comes out wrong or being ignored by the server. I spoken with the manager at this location before and I was hoping this location would get better like the hb location near Bella terra. I don't really want to write an review about this location, but after spending a lot of money here. I had to leave one, the manager who came out tonight was not as friendly as the other manager who apologized in the past for the service. I highly recommend driving an extra 15min to a different bj location with better service than this one."
Craig S.,"Chino Hills, CA",10,1,,2.0,10/19/2014,"So far a pretty horrible experience. It's 12:30 half the restaurant has open seating.  When we asked why they can't seat is it because they don't have enough staff. Wtf, it's lunch and you don't have enough servers."
Bryan L.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,15,3,3.0,2/9/2014,"First off, I'm a big fan of BJ's - I usually go to BJ's in Irvine on Jamboree Road.  Everything was great here besides the service; however, the manager sees this and is genuinely working on improving this, at least I hope. Our server was initially good: she took our order, got us our drinks, and continued to refill our drinks. Nonetheless, as time progressed her enthusiasm dwindled. After we got our pizzas she basically disappeared - at times she walked by us and completely ignored us. This was a bit saddening, as we couldn't fully enjoy our pizza without the parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, ranch, or refills. Granted, this might sound like we were overreacting, but if you're going to pay $24 per pizza, you want to be able to enjoy it to the max. Furthermore, I tried giving our waitress the benefit of the doubt, but there was a family right next to us who was getting quality service and all her attention,  so we couldn't understand why we were being ignored. Finally, my friend got up and went and talked with the manager. We got a new waitress almost immediately and everything was set right: cheese, pepper, ranch, and refills all came speedily. This would have been enough to satisfy us. The big surprise came when we got the bill. The manager essentially discounted our appetizers ($17 value).  We appreciated this kind gesture because it displayed effort on the managers part.  I'm giving a 3 star because the original waitress was horrible and it affected our entire experience. This BJ's location needs to ensure all servers are great, not just some."
Uriel ..,"Houston, TX",0,14,11,1.0,10/12/2014,"Came in for dinner on a Sunday night, it wasn't all that busy. We sat at the bar and at first everything was great, friendly bartender. The Lakers were playing so we asked if we could get the game on the larger screen. Asked the bartender a second time and she seemed annoyed that I was persistent with my request. 10 minutes passed...no Lakers game on any of the large screens. I ordered Cajun pasta with chicken and shrimp. The bartender asked if I wanted the chicken grilled or blackened; I said, ""grilled please"".  Once I got my plate...no chicken, only shrimp. I told the bartender that they forgot to throw the chicken in the pasta. Bartender then goes, ""oh its because you said to substitute it for the shrimp"". Hmmm, didn't you even ask me how I'd like the chicken cooked? And to make matters worse, my Lakers lost. I was over the whole pizookie dessert and left right after eating."
Eddie G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,22,2,5.0,8/30/2014,"We have the BJs app so I got the preferred seating, but since parking is incredibly difficult (on Labor Day weekend) I got there 15 minutes late and my place was lost but they were able to give me a 20 minute wait which wasn't bad considering how full it was, while others were being told 1 hr. But we actually got seated after five minutes, which I appreciate since I had kids with me. Had a small BBQ chicken deep dish, kids meals and of course a poozokie. Food was good."
Michele W.,"Humble, TX",160,59,9,5.0,7/2/2014,This is the second BJ's we've been to. Great menu options...lots to choose from. We loved what we ordered and will have no problems going to other BJ's when we come across them.
Elizabeth A.,"Santa Ana, CA",9,6,,1.0,4/5/2014,"Where do I begin? So last night my friend and I decided to go to BJ's after work. When we got there, we were told it was going to be a 15-20 minute wait, which of course we didn't mind. It turned out to be a 5 minute wait, perfect, can't complain there. So our host walked us over to our table and then mentioned to us that our server will be with us shortly. Normally when I go to restaurants, servers come over to greet and ask for our drinks within 3-5 minutes, maybe less than that, but our server took about 20 minutes. I had to walk to the front desk to remind them that we've been waiting for someone to take our order. Finally, we had a server. Yay! We're finally going to get our drinks and food. When we got our food, another server brought it to us but immediately walked away without giving us napkins and utensils. I looked around for others servers, perhaps they have extra utensils, but of course they were all occupied, I'm not going to wait another 5 minutes for them to bring us some. Again, I walked over to front desk and asked for them. I know this is a long review, I'm almost done. I ordered the Extra Hot wings, however, the wings I got were not spicy at all. At this point, I was fed up with this place, I didn't even bother to let them know that they took my order wrong and had given me the traditional wings instead.  Food: Not that great. The wings were tiny and dry. The strawberry lemonade was delicious.  I don't know if I'll come back to this BJ's again, bummer because this one is the closest to my house."
Angelica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,5,1,5.0,11/15/2014,Good service. Good food. With great Friends.  I will definately return. Pizza and staff are swedome
Amy W.,"Orange, CA",5,29,,1.0,10/2/2015,I used to love BJ until I got frozen tomatoes in my salad. Wth... salad was supposed to be fresh not frozen!! Sooo disappointed. . Customers suck too u had to wait at least 10 minutes to get the waiter come to u.  Im not sure if the ran out of plate and bowls... because my friends got bigger plate then mine even though we order same thing.
