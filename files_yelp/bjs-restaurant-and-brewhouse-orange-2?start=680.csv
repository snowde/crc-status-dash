Kristina M.,"Orange, CA",129,52,13,1.0,3/8/2014,"Very disappointed. First let me say that I love BJ's food... With that being said and since there are so many to choose from in the area, I will never return  to this location. We were sat very quickly but everything from dirty glasses, not clearing finished salad plates even while we are lunch they still sat there to having to get up and grab silverware off another table because although we asked twice still did not receive. Drinks and food did not come out timely or correctly.  Took almost 2 hours for lunch and anyone with 3 kids at lunch knows that feels like a lot longer!!"
Bill M.,"Anaheim, CA",6,19,,3.0,9/30/2014,"My best friend loves to come here for lunch so we come here together fairly frequently.  The food is decent and relatively inexpensive so that's good for seniors on a fixed income.  I particularly like the soup and salad lunch specials but occasionally switch it up and offer something different.  I'm not a beer drinker, but Bill loves to try all the different beers."
Daniel S.,"Santa Ana, CA",11,11,1,1.0,4/3/2014,Our hostess sat us. We were waiting 20 minutes and our server never came. So we left. This is the second time this happens at this exact location.
Edward G.,"Santa Ana, CA",18,13,1,1.0,4/3/2014,Worst service ever. Came with a party of 5 waited 15 to get seated. After that we waited 15 minutes of waiting around and seeing waiters just standing around playing grab ass with each othe. We finally got fed up and walked out. I hate that no one aprouched us at all not to say hi ask us for drinks NOTHING. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Bad service.
Alexis B.,"Fresno, CA",224,239,12,2.0,11/24/2013,"This place is a chain. The food is the same as all its other chain counterparts.  What I'm rating on is the service.  Came here with my family (party of four) on a Sunday night.  The wait was fine, only about 15 minutes. But our server was not very pleasant.  She didn't really smile and wasn't really helpful. She was also really bad at refilling our drinks.  She didn't ever come check up on us and we had to flag her down for refills.  Then she would act like we were bothering her. It took a loooong time for us to get our pizzas and when we did, they were COLD! We were all hungry so we just ate them cuz who knows how long it'll be before we got another one. Definitely not good service here! But as always, the pizzokie was amazing!"
Richard And Elainne S.,"Garden Grove, CA",11,132,39,4.0,5/11/2014,Late night snack with the bestie. This was our first time at this location and its pretty nice. We sat at the bar since there were open tables. Our waiter (forgot his name) was very nice and very attentive. He noticed we were chit chatting more than looking through the menu but didnt rush us to order. Thats a plus! And he kept checking up on us. We ordered the mozzarella salad and spinach dip. The food was good. Normal bjs food. Of course we had the pazookie. We ordered the mini but ended up with the regular size. But hey! Why complain. Its a pazookie. And of course it was delish. Food was like any other bjs location. Nothing special. But the service was great. Would come back again.
Claude G.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,25,4,4.0,7/2/2014,Best BJS . Food and service great compared to the Tustin location. I actually eat there regularly but won't go to Tustin . Wait is short and servers friendly
Kendrick H.,"Orange, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/1/2013,"Probably the worst BJs I've ever gone to. Came here twice and each time walked out feeling super whatever. Service here blows, they ran out of their own beer, bartender gave the guy next to me 20 in ones because he was out of change. The waitress in the bar section gave us the wrong drinks. She also took the high top tables next to us and gave them to the guests next to us without asking if we needed them for anyone who might be joining us.  Honestly the rating at this place is well deserved and probably generous. Avoid coming here if you enjoy good service or the food you order."
Gloria K.,"Anaheim, CA",0,27,3,2.0,9/11/2014,We cane here for lunch the service is EXTREMELY SLOW. We ordered the lunch special (flat pizza and salad) how can this take 40 minutes to make! ! The food was not worth the wait.
ChrisTina Y.,"Westminster, CA",209,43,39,4.0,1/3/2014,"I want to thank my waiter who was so pleasant and helpful with the food and drinks. The 550 and under calorie. ..PERFECT AND TASTY! (; customer service is key, The  ambiance was very casual and the environment for 6pm dinner was comfortably busy. One thing is for sure all BJs have a signature for their flooring..."
Joe S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/14/2015,Great place to have pizza with the family.  Service is always great.  Food is even better.  Only negative issue was the cleanliness of the restaurant.  Our table was dirty and the floor looked as though someone dropped their leftovers and BJs forgot to clean up.
Ashlee And Nicholas F.,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",30,144,31,1.0,10/1/2013,"Reviewed by Nick- I don't often find the need to vent on Yelp, in fact, I often choose to let myself cool off before writing any negative reviews. That being said, I'm writing this a week after my visit on Wed (9/25/13) at about 5:30pm. The place was pretty full, but by no means packed, nor were the servers swamped.  We were sat at our table and it took a good 10 mins for our server (Lorenzo C #363) to even stop by our table to introduce himself. Yeah... I'm calling out names! We asked for some water to start with (and a beer for me), and asked for a Gluten free menu for my wife. Another 10min later, Lorenzo drops of the menu and disappears for another 10min. He finally comes back with the water, only to quickly leave again...  the beer follows shortly. This is about 30min after being seated and we only have water. Keep in mind we are sitting there, menus closed waiting to order, and Lorenzo is nowhere to be found. At this point, I'm really getting pissed about the lack of service, so start keeping my eye on our waiter as he travels about the restaurant, talking with fellow servers and having a blast! At one point, we make eye contact and he's walking straight towards me. I'm thinking, ""Wow... we might actually get to order!"" But no, he literally takes a 90 degree turn and goes out to the patio. It was almost comical... I got his attention after he returned from the patio (and ordered) and was watching him the entire time we were waiting for our food. It seems like the staff here is straight from the movie ""Waiting."" Young people, ungrateful for a job, talking, gossiping, and fraternizing with the other servers rather than tending to customers. When the food arrived, it was dropped off by another member of the staff and we were offered no condiments or even brought out any place settings. When Lorenzo came by again, I had to actually lean back into the isle and block him to get some ketchup. I was never offered a refill on my water or even asked if I wanted another beer (rare). To add insult to injury, my wife ordered a wedge salad with Italian and Lorenzo brought us one with blue cheese (looks the same I know). We were eating out with our 15-month daughter, so we had a narrow window to eat before bedtime. Needless to say, by this time she was getting cranky, and rather than wait for Lorenzo to bring another salad, my wife ate what was brought to her. Next time Lorenzo came by, I brought up the fact that the salad was wrong, and it seemed like he could care less. Didn't offer to take a side salad off the bill ($2.99) or comp a beer... nothing. I had to ask for more water when I requested the bill, paid promptly and left this pit of misery.  My bill said 7:22pm on it, so we were there for almost 2 entire hours.  Food gets a 3- Average chain brew house food, but the service gets a 1. Terrible waiters more concerned with catching up with friends, than serving guests. It wasn't just Lorenzo, I noticed all the waiters back by the patio exit grouping up, talking together and generally ignoring guests on several occasions.  I REALLY hope the management re-evaluates the waiters they hired at this place. I know several, personable people that would LOVE a job at BJ's were they can earn good tips. Sadly, the crew here seems like they have better things to do than serve paying customers. The management should take this behavior as a sign as just that... these people DO NOT CARE about serving customers, so please do them a favor and fire them!  I was actually going to wait to speak with a manager before we left as the level of service left me speechless, but again, we had a cranky baby and had to leave quickly."
Loren R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,15,6,5.0,3/29/2014,"Awesome food, service and beer!  So happy to have a BJ's at The Block.  Love the Beef Dip and Mediterranean Tacos and the Pork chops were perfectly cooked."
Michelle N.,"Garden Grove, CA",184,152,515,1.0,1/29/2014,"Where to start...The hostess were very friendly tonight, but that's the only good thing I can say in this review. There were too many servers waiting on us and everyone seem to be all over the place. The calamari were ordered weren't even crispy and more chewy, pretty disappointing. Our waters were never refilled either. I prefer the one in Huntington beach instead"
Sandra C.,"Orange, CA",0,3,1,1.0,7/18/2015,Worst service ever. The food is good  but the service here is terrible. The manager is super unprofessional. He has no respect for customers.
Diana N.,"Westminster, CA",178,150,13,1.0,4/19/2015,"this location is alot nicer and bigger than the one in HB and alot worse. it was just me and my boyfriend and we came during late night happy hour. we asked to get seated at the bar area for a reason (again, happy hour) but apparently our server didn't get the memo.  we ordered off some appetizers off the happy hour menu which was the avocado egg rolls and buffalo wings. and also the hawaiian deep dish pizza which was dry as hell and the meditteranean chicken pita wrap. the wrap was the worst wrap i ever put in my mouth.  it was missing all the feta toppings and it was so gross i had to send that back. i rather have mcdonalds snack wrap, thank you very much.  anyways our bill came out to be $50. ok thats alot considering if i planned on coming here to spend half of that. i thought our server made a minor mistake of forgetting to charge us happy hour price but she says ""oh you guys ordered a full order of the avocado egg rolls and buffalo wings.."" Me and my bf looked at each other and was like what? lol why would you give us a full order of these items when we clearly ordered from the happy hour menu AND we didnt even finish it! not even close! its between two people and youre going to assume we were asking for a full order??? on top of that, service was painfully slow and terrible. i think i waited 30+ minutes. never coming back here ever."
Kellie H.,"Temecula, CA",0,13,9,1.0,8/22/2015,"Ordered a pizookie an hour ago. That's all we ordered. Still waiting for it. According to another worker talking to another table a waiter up and quit or something. The lack of a professional attitude and care for employment is shocking. I mean... it's a cookie and ice cream... not that difficult. Not busy and we've been waiting an hour and ten minutes for this. On top of it, we had to prepay the bill, how trashy."
Richard G.,"Downey, CA",5,25,11,1.0,8/22/2015,"Really excited to get to BJ's and watch the Raider Game  At 5pm. Well i get there at 5:05 they do not have one tv with the Raider Game on. I ask if they can put it on the TV in front of our table. They said sure, about 10 minutes later i ask again. 5 minutes later they come back and tell me the manager said they don't get that channel. The Raider Game is on channel 5 I've told them both times when i asked them. So it's been about 17 minutes now and i still don't have my pitcher of beer. I tell the server we are leaving Since They don't get channel 5 and i still don't have my drinks. They some how Figure out how to get channel 5. So we end up staying, and for 5 minutes they play the game on the tv in front of us. Then they Change the channel to Golf and tell me some one requested it. They put the game on a tv all the way to the rIght where it's hard to see. I got to tell you, this it's not the place you want to go to to watch the Raider game while you are enjoying beer and pizza. I'll be spending my money where i can watch the game."
Jennifer B.,"Orange, CA",1,8,3,1.0,8/22/2014,"The food is ok here, assuming they bring out the correct order!! Came here with a group of 5, not 50 and it took 2 hours!! This is ridiculous!!!"
Brandon V.,"Santa Ana, CA",4228,75,143,4.0,8/26/2013,"I am so happy to finally have a BJ's close to my home.  This location is  brand new construction and pretty smart they built right on the corner at City Drive and 22 and they completely blocked the view of TGI Fridays.  It's a standard BJ's but this location seems to have much more craft brews on tap.  Not only the BJ's brews but numerous additional craft beers.  Based on the previous reviews I did notice a week ago the service was a little disorganized but coming back a week later it appears they are working out the issues.  It's BJ's - everything is pretty good but I love the pizza, giant baked potatoes and beer.  They do have a rewards program which I was just made aware of at  this location.  They do have an awesome happy hour as well."
