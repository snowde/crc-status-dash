Stas O.,"Fountain Valley, CA",305,243,83,5.0,4/21/2014,"Came here to get their thick crust pizza! It was Delicious! We got the combo pizza, and a few beers. The service was excellent, the food was great, no complaints here!"
Madiya M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,53,7,1.0,8/13/2014,"Let me start by saying that I've been coming to BJs for a while now.. 5 years to be exact. And I've noticed a continued decline in their customer service over the years. But this location has to be one of the worst ones I've encountered yet! I give it a 1 star because the manager ""tried"" to rectify the problems (plural) Short version: rude staff (hosts and servers combined), major communication issues between servers and cooks which results in incorrect orders, inability to cater to large parties and lastly, slow inconsistent service! Long version: Party of 20.. Took about an 1:40 minutes just to be seated (random Tuesday with half the restaurant empty) not a big deal.. Since there were 20 of us, we entertained each other outside on a beautiful evening. Once we get seated, we get introduced to Juan and the drinks start rolling in. We order apps and while they tasted good, they took about 40 mins to come out to us. We ordered about 4 spinach and artichoke dips, all of them were half empty. No worries, we ask the waiter to fill them up. He takes the dips away and disappears for another 20 mins while the chips get cold. And the only reason it took 20 mins was because we had to remind him. Food starts coming out (most of the orders were wrong). And then were told the missing dishes would be on their way (another 20 mins) so half the party was eating and the other half was watching. Our waiters response ""umm yah this was big party"" so ur establishment can't cater properly to a big party? The biggest failure of the night, bits of pepperoni on vegetarian pizzas that we accidentally ate!!!! Any vegetarian will tell u how big of a no no that is. Not only was our meal ruined but our snooty waiter tells us ""oh that happens sometimes since the toppings are next to each other"" ummmm wat???? That's the best bs u can come up with?? By the end of the night, 5 hours wasted, food was subpar, and evening ruined by rude and incompetent waiters!"
Mike A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,5,,1.0,8/5/2013,"I've been to several other BJ's in the area, but this one is certainly the worst experience I've had. Mainly, it's because of the manager they had on Friday night. I don't know if he was inexperienced or just plain incompetent. Long story short, we were told that there was a 2-hour maximum on tables, even though they don't take reservations to begin with. The waitresses and bartenders were great but the manager was mostly rude. He  stopped by our table twice for something that I've never experienced. He said he was unable to serve us more drinks unless we identified our designated driver. We identified her and then he said ""OK"" and let us start ordering again. (one shot later) He then stopped by the 2nd time and said that he was unable to serve any more drinks for the remainder of the evening. He did not give any reasoning as to how he arrived at this decision. Mind you, we weren't loud or obnoxious. It was pretty disappointing since we were looking forward to having a spot to hang out after a long week of work on Friday nights. Hopefully this clown gets replaced soon... Bottom line, go to the HB one. Beach & Edinger or Main St."
David N.,"Fullerton, CA",264,3,,1.0,8/12/2015,"So about 2 months ago, we went to the BJs in Brea and had the worst service. They gave us a courtesy card to make up for the bad experience we had. We finally decided to give BJs another shot tonight but the one in Orange to avoid bad service. We were unable to avoid the bad service. We got sat and didn't get started until after a table that got sat after us had been started. Why? Who knows. We ordered an appetizer and sides for our meals, the sides came out with our appetizer. The person bringing out the food, was sweating, he wasn't carrying a tray and his hands were all up in our food. One of our dishes (the actual food) was even rubbing up against his shirt. Extremely unsanitary! After we received our food, our server checked on us once and we never saw her again until she came to tell us it was last call. To finish it off, when we tried to pay, she took over 15 min to come back and pick up the check to run it because she was doing her side work. I'm not sure if it's bad luck that we have received bad service twice in a row or if Bjs in general is just lowering their service standards. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
Heather G.,"Long Beach, CA",4,50,5,5.0,5/6/2014,"We went for happy hour on a Sunday night and ordered Chicken Wings, sliders, and a mini pizza. Everything was delicious, but the best part was Peter our bartender. He was so helpful with ordering and was so delightful. It's hard to find good service. I think he was the best server/bartender I've had anywhere. Thank you Peter! We will be back to visit soon."
Jerry T.,"Anaheim, CA",218,40,62,1.0,9/27/2013,"BJs Restaurant chain is my favorite by far. Unfortunately, Out of all the BJs restaurants that I have been to in throughout Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and San Diego counties, this one is the worst one. I've been here many times. The restaurant itself is very nice but service is outright terrible.  On many occassions, the restaurant area, is understaffed. It took them 30 minutes to get my beer after seating sometimes. Do yourself a favor and stay in the bar area during happy hours. Its cheaper and service is a whole lot faster."
R G.,"Brea, CA",3,16,1,5.0,1/17/2014,"As a researcher in the industry of customer satisfaction, Kevin is an awesome manager who is focused on the customer needs & along with balancing the employee expectations. He took the time to ensure the quality & efficiency of the food we (group of 4) ordered such as Buffalo wings, stuffed mushrooms, avocado egg rolls & the ahi poki tuna along with the drinks arrived on time & to our satisfaction. This group wanted separate checks along with all that satisfaction.  That's what I call tailored, patient & really listening to ur customers needs!!  Will return for the 3rd time juts to experience Kevin's focus of customer service!!!  BJs is lucky to have an employee like him."
K. S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/8/2014,"1st time to BJs, NO problems, 4 stars,.. However,.. 2nd (this time) took 20 minutes, for cokes, another 20 minuets to see our waiter, then he ""disappeared""1/2 hour after taking our order, soon after , another waitress came by asked if we wanted dessert! pizza order wrong, wasn't busy really, except larger groups(bigger tips perhaps) the 2 of us asked for manager , he came, rolled eyes, looked impatient, gave us the bill!  HEY,,, its the staff, NOT the restaurants problem.....  nice 1st trip , bad 2nd trip, management was poor that day,,.........this locale: by the ' block' in orange.   thanks"
Kaitlyn M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",4,55,3,5.0,6/18/2014,"I was impressed with how they handled the waitlist. Instead of using the traditional buzzer to tell you that your table is ready, they have you put in your cell phone number and it sends you a text instead. I just wonder how that would work for the people that do not have cell phones lol. Anyway, the food was great but you could definitely tell the server was new."
Christal W.,"Orange, CA",51,3,1,1.0,9/6/2014,"I was very dissatisfied with BJs today. From the time we walked in to the time anyone came to take our drink order, it took 15 minutes. By the time we actually got our food (which was only pizza), we had been waiting an HOUR. And not once we were offered refills on our drinks. I would have said something to the manager but not once in the entire hour and half it took to order and eat a small pizza, did one walk by our table. Then I tried to email the restaurant instead of using Yelp, but I couldn't find any where to personally contact them.  So Yelp it is."
Guy W.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,6,1,5.0,9/6/2015,Was in town from Arizona stopped in at the BJ'S in Orange. And had superior service from our waitress Liz. Will definitely come back!!!
Stephanie E.,"North Hollywood, CA",19,59,18,1.0,3/30/2014,"Food is not very good. Ive been here twice now and my food is always barely warm and either too salty or too bland. Even my pizza was cold and tasted like the toppings were added cold on top of a premade pizza. It looks beautiful and the bar is great, but slow service, mediocre food, ehh."
Sharon H.,"Irvine, CA",124,122,101,1.0,3/29/2014,"Service is really slow. Had to ask for water and utensils twice. All I hear are excuses on how they have to et it in the back. Food finally comes... We order pizza, which has no sauce on it and the dough wasn't cooked enough... Caesar has too much dressing and the chicken is dry. This is the last time my friends and I come here."
Kevin H.,"Garden Grove, CA",4,10,18,1.0,11/29/2014,Came here wanting some deep dish pizza.  They got our pizza order wrong.  Then got our chicken limone dish wrong also.  Last straw was when we ordered the pazookie and it took over 15 mins to arrive.  I doubt I will be back here again.
Bryan G.,"Hesperia, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/1/2015,"Went to BJ's recently to celebrate a friend's birthday, and was not let down. We were a group of 5 guys, in our late teens (18/19), and were of course, hyped up. The service dealt with it surprisingly well, the only real issue was we had to wait a half hour to be seated. The real highlight was our waiter, Joseph L (I didn't get the last name). He was cheerful, patient, and very friendly, provided service with a smile, and went along with the John Cena jokes all night. I wish I had extra money to tip, but I definitely recommend going for service like his."
Jimmy K.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,11,4,1.0,8/29/2013,"We went here for happy hour. When we asked the hostess if it was happy hour, she stated only the cocktail area and outside patio seating. The cocktail area was full and she said we can wait around for a spot. She said we can go to the patio area. It was 90 degrees today and she said its not that hot. Bitch, who u kidding. Asked if we can have happy hour at the regular dining area, she said no. Most restaurants I've been to will accommodate but not this one."
Tish Y.,"Anaheim, CA",35,58,165,4.0,4/6/2014,"We came to this bj's because it's the closest to where we live, it looked busy when we got there but once we came in we waited like 3 minutes, not bad. Service is just average hi my name is.. Can I get you something to drink? Etc...we ordered ice teas, calamari and the bj's  deep dish pizza, they were all really good! Decor in this place is nice and welcoming, tv's everywhere and a big nice bar. We were there around 4pm so it was busy but not to the point that we had to wait for ever."
Jason C.,"Escondido, CA",25,155,183,3.0,4/3/2014,"If you like Root Beer get the Irish Root Beer without the Baileys cream. The food was decent, nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about really. Had a nice meal."
Alicia B.,"Garden Grove, CA",27,30,21,5.0,3/15/2014,My boyfriend and I love Bjs it is our second favorite restaurant when we go we always get the chicken bacon ranch pizza and for dessert we get an oreo pizokee which is the best combination! Most of the servers are really good and friendly when it is usually busy they might forget about you but that has only happened to us once but besides that we love BJ's !
Susie L.,"Santa Ana, CA",137,38,35,1.0,11/26/2013,Went on a friday night about 7pm waited 30min for a table for 3. We ordered a large pizza waited another 30 min for that. And when it came out it was COLD. Very disappointed. It hardly had any marinera sauce on it.  I doubt ill ever go back during busy hours. And the manager looked stressed out. He should walk around with a smile. And ask people that look irritated how he can make it better. Seriously if u cant handle go work at pollys
