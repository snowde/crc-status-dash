Jackie D.,"Santa Ana, CA",465,88,100,5.0,8/30/2013,It seems like the service before was not so great by all the reviews but today I had a wonderful server named David. I'm not going to lie I did come in with low expectations because of all the negative reviews but David was attentive throughout the entire time I was there. Hopefully this Bj's is reading the reviews and are improving their service because so far I was one of the lucky ones.
J G.,"Anaheim, CA",1,27,,3.0,7/3/2014,"the actual atmosphere is nice, had the outdoor setting.  There serve was really nice.  Unfortunately the food was not the great, first time at this location.  I had gotten sick from the food, email the company and they had gotten back to me right away.  If it wasn't for the customer service I would not recommend BJ's period.  I don't know if that day the kitchen just had a bad day but again the got cold food and had gotten sick from it."
Daisy T.,"Garden Grove, CA",324,6,,5.0,12/28/2014,"I love BJ's! Especially this one. I've come so often that I think I've been helped by most of the servers. I went there a few weeks ago and found out they discontinued the boneless wings and was pretty bummed. Then I went in again and told my server about it and he said he would surprise me with something similar. Turns out you can get chicken tenders dipped in an wing sauce and it tasted just like the boneless wings. Thanks James!! You made my night! Everyone here is so friendly, and their drinks are some of the best I've tried in OC!!"
Jennifer Z.,"Placentia, CA",8,9,2,1.0,11/23/2013,Worst experience ever. They were out of berry cider and out of framboise. I can deal with that. Our steak took 30+ minutes to come out. I can't deal with that when i have an impatient toddler. We were told our steaks took so long because they didn't have it or forgot to put it on the grill. Waitress never came back to check on us so we couldn't ask for water or a least have out son's meal brought out first. When our steaks finally came out it was dry and tasteless. To top it off they didn't bring out the kid's meal. It wasn't ready. Waste of money and most importantly waste of our time. We should have just driven out to Brea.
Jerry D.,"Orange, CA",0,6,,3.0,8/9/2015,"BJ's was okay. The pizza looked like the toppings were applied somewhat sloppily, and the crust was decent at best. My friends and I shared a few pizzas. It was decent, but I probably wouldn't go back because there are many other places to get good pizza."
Gelene G.,"Fullerton, CA",29,7,1,1.0,10/28/2013,"Tried this place out twice and the service was horrible. We were there for two hours and two out of the party of five did not get their lunch. Further we couldn't find our waitress to complain. The manager apologized and provided courtesy cards for $15.00;however, I won't be going back there to use it!!! The kitchen also has a reputation for screwing up the order when it finally makes it to the table. Hopefully they take the service more seriously as they will lose clientele and will be closing the doors for good!"
Diego R.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,1,,4.0,6/15/2014,"Not a long wait to be seated. But it takes a while to get your food. The employees are super nice! They made a mistake with my brother's food and mine but they were super nice about everything. Overall, good restaurant!"
Gabriel P.,"Lakewood, CA",16,7,,5.0,6/14/2014,Great service by Rachel and great food at a great price. Don't forget to get the Caramel Pizookie & hopstorm IPA. #goodfood #beer
Cindy M.,"Garden Grove, CA",17,54,158,3.0,2/19/2014,We ordered two drinks and they were $10 & $11. Tasted good but it seemed weak. I didn't feel anything. Usually I get a little fuzzy but not with the drink i got. I didn't get my mini bruschetta didn't come out before my soup n mozzarella tomato salad. Kitchens fault. Our server was nice and patient with us since we were al large group.
Lauren F.,"Anaheim, CA",16,6,2,1.0,3/8/2015,"I only put one star because when you don't put any the review isn't shown. So they do not even deserve one star. I came here after work with some coworkers to celebrate my birthday. Might I add, we all work in a restaurant over at disneyland so we know the loops. Never have I ever had such terrible service in my life. As soon as we walked in we didn't feel welcomed at all and was told the table was going to be just a moment, to there was no tables, then it was going to be 30 minutes. Then there was immediate seating when our sixth person arrived and she asked for the table? Confused yet? So were we. Anyways it took Lucas, our absolutely awful server, twenty minutes to not even greet us but to rudely walk up to the table and ask ""what do you want to drink?"" As our time went on we never once received refills, plates, silver wear, napkins, anything. Nor did he ask us if everything was okay, which it obviously wasn't. This calamari was oddly off that night to say the least and we weren't pleased at all but he didn't know that until we asked to speak to a manger finally. After getting yelled at by his manager, he decided to bring us refills where we found spit, literally a lugie, in our soda. Never will I return to this Bj's even with the offer of a free recovery meal. Lucas was the most terrible, careless sever I have ever encountered."
John B.,"Cypress, CA",31,156,311,4.0,2/17/2014,"I love this place for so many reasons, they have a extensive menu which is great for large parties.  There is pretty much something for everyone all of the time.  Although I do enjoy their pizza this is not the first place I would go for pizza.  They have a some great lunch specials including all you can eat soup and salad. Also their customer service is superb, they have always been excellent and I have been comped on a number of ocassions when there was something to complain about."
Xans M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/28/2013,I love eating at BJ's but this is the first time I visited this location and it will be the last time I will come to this location.  The waitress we had was very attentive and friendly (which is why I gave 2 stars). The drinks at the bar on the otherhand were not so good. I ordered a mudslide and it came out frothy and a bit chalky. The beer we ordered was also a little off. Not sure what caused that. Maybe soap?  The food was okay. I've ordered the same at other BJ's and had better.  Sticking to my other BJ's.
Nathan E.,"Eugene, OR",2,88,8,2.0,5/30/2014,"The food is pretty good here and that's about it. It's always a ridiculous wait. It's extremely loud (but y'know, sports bar, what can I expect). But my main problem is with the servers. Multiple times now, waiters and waitresses have called my roommate and I ""ladies"" or ""miss""... we are both male. I really don't get it. I figured the first time was a slip-up, but it has happened several times now. Last time we were there, the food took FOREVER. I ordered a gluten free pizza and the waitress asked if I wanted cheese on it... uhhh..."
Maritza L.,"Pomona, CA",2,19,3,4.0,5/24/2014,"Standing by the bar waiting on an opportunity to be able to sit down  a barista attended us and got us seated right away,which was pretty awesome. His services were on point all night never ignored us, I gotta say bj's impressed me a bit last night def would go back when I'm out in the city of orange. Thanks Cortez."
Michael B.,"Anaheim, CA",111,85,6,2.0,8/29/2013,While being sat was offered to sit down with food on my chair. The server seemed to be in a hurry as well talked really fast. Seems my food was taken by another server so my friend got her food and that's when they noticed so took about 5-8 min to get my plate. The manager did bring my food and was very apologetic but also talked really fast and seemed nervous. The food was really good though once we got it. Not sure if ill come back to this location. Being new and knowing there is bugs to work out this location was a mess from start to finish and that's hard to fix.
Anna Y.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,7,1,5.0,5/23/2015,Great place all the food is good friends took me there and don't for get the dinner omg it's delicious...
Karen F.,"Tustin, CA",96,116,17,2.0,1/14/2014,We work close by so a lot of us have come here. They NEVER get your full order correct. Food is still good when they get you the right order.
Dennis D.,"Anaheim, CA",1,15,1,1.0,4/11/2015,"Really?  I stopped in tonight for a quick bite after the baseball game.  I was seated in about five minutes with ease; sometimes the wait can be quite long, even late in the evening.  The food server came to get my order within five minutes.  Again a good sign.  I ordered the deep dish lasagna - which is not lasagna, it's some stacked ravioli, but is a good dish I have had at another location about a month ago. The server disappeared having done her duty in the failure of a ""team service""  concept. Fifteen minutes later the team food slinger plopped down the dish with the welcoming, cheerful and unconscious service-oriented phrase, ""lasagna?""  and then also quickly disappeared.  So quick after the fling that it was only then I realized I had no silverware, no napkin, no nothing. Really? Is this anyone's job ""on the team"" or am I supposed to eat with my hands? TEN minutes after staring at my food and trying to hail a ""food server"" of any kind from any where, the original food server - at least I think it was she, our interaction had been so brief 20 minutes earlier during the ""ordering"" phase - stops by and says ""Oh, they didn't bring you any silverware?""  No apology, no concern... really?  I was so disgusted tha all I could do was ask for a box.  I could have taken the now cold food home and reheat it myself.  And I have forks and napkins at home...  Then my good sense kicked in.  Hey, wait a minute... this is supposed to be a restaurant... I simply got up and left the cold, utensil-less, uneaten food on the bare table for the food server to figure out.  Maybe they could find a patron who brings their own utensils and napkins and a microwave and serve it to them.  She probably never knew; most likely the team busser came by and just threw the food and sinful service away. Really management?  This is your idea of training and service? No thanks.  Never again at this location.  What a disappointment."
Patricia G.,"Orange, CA",3,5,2,1.0,4/9/2014,"Agree with all the other reviews, worst service and happy hour ever (except for the bartenders who are great). So if you want good service sit at the bar otherwise good luck. Our server (didn't get her name) was awful."
Jazlyn V.,"La Habra, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/26/2015,Samantha D was a great server! She was super nice and attentive! She didn't leave our glasses empty and she made sure we had everything we needed. She was awesome!
