Angela N.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,14,9,3.0,6/25/2014,"Came in this afternoon with two friends and we were seated right away. We just got our menus and the waitress immediately asked us for drinks and what we wanted and we felt rushed, like she was going to attack us if we didn't order right away. Uh, no. Anyway, the food was good, waited about twenty minutes at most. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, well with my order at least. I had the Cajun Pasta lunch combo with Caesar salad. I love spicy and my waitress added more Cajun spices for me. There was no kick in the beginning, but the spiciness builds up as you eat. Service is somewhat slow, my friend waited half an hour to get a refill on her water. Oreo pizooki was okay, too sweet for my taste, I prefer normal chocolate chip pizooki. I will try triple chocolate next time. Good lively environment with the World Cup tournament being on television. The one in Huntington Beach is better though."
Jason P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/2/2014,"Food is great but service is bad during their busy nights. We waited in line for 45 mins then when we were called and were sitting on our table, the waiter got our orders. Just simple ones mind you, mac and cheese for my kids and a bj favorite pizza. And yet, we waited for another 45 mins. Wtf. Great food but pretty slow, turtle-like service."
Sally S.,"Irvine, CA",65,29,8,1.0,10/15/2014,"Came here after a very long day, Wednesday.  Not packed, but sat at the bar where there was only 1 server, so service was quite slow.  Ordered the new kale and brussel sprout salad with chicken, salad was good, chicken was dry.  My BF ordered the wings, very tasty.  My cousin ordered a burger and fries.  Burger was great; fries tasted tough, they obviously used old fries and ""refried"" them to warm them up.  Since server was attending to others, my cousin, who was starving, finished his burger before we could complain.  Server finally came by, we complained and he did comp us with a small plate of fresh fries.  What stunned us was a different server came by to drop off another small plate of old, stale fries saying ""they""-meaning the cooks in the back-wanted her to bring these out for us.  Did they think we were that desperate for more stale fries?  Were they just trying to get rid of leftover fries from lunch or were they trying to insult us by thinking we were obese little turds and we would finish off their trash?  Shame on you BJ's.  You used to be very good but over the years, you've gone downhill.  By the look of other reviews, another one from tonight, you won't be getting much service any time soon."
Jim M.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/17/2014,"Been to this location several times and have always had great service and great beers! The Moroccan salmon is fantastic! If you're a hop-head like me, you can't go wrong with Hopstorm IPA or The Piranha pale ale!  P.S. Never write a review until you have been to a place a few times!!!!"
Jason R.,"Orange County, CA",109,16,11,4.0,11/6/2013,Came in with a coworker for an extended lunch and was attended to immediately. This restaurant just opened up a month or so ago and looks great. I had a tall glass of Black and Blue (Guinness/blue moon) and one of their signature brews to go with an appetizer.  I won't rush to visit again but it would he a great Plan B. Cheers!
Abraham R.,"Perris, CA",0,5,,4.0,6/14/2015,"Had a reservation for 8pm with 10 people. We had requested the outside table with the fire across the center of the table.... People who were there before us sat at the table for 5 or more hours.... The manager came and explained the situation and offered us a different tables and appetizers on the house! We sat ordered drinks and within minutes 2 samplers, carne asada fries, wings, and potato skins show up at our table!!! Talk about awesome customer service!! Will recommend this location to all my friends and family."
Craig M.,"Anaheim, CA",25,8,1,2.0,9/26/2013,I normally like this place... But had the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. Everyone's food came out before mine they told me it would be out in 1 min. 20-25 min later everyone was almost done and my food arrived how awkward. Then the waiter brings us the check... I wanted dessert but I guess I wasn't getting any. So my friends an I are talking and hadn't looked at the check yet.. 10 min later and the waiter comes over can I take that? We reply not yet! He then says well your my last table before I get to leave... Then he walks away. On top of not getting dessert the pizza was slightly burnt.. It was just a really bad experience.
Elisa Q.,"Anaheim, CA",1,11,9,1.0,3/23/2015,"This place was horrible for large parties. They broke up our group of 25 that was reserved a week in advanced all because they sat a group by our reservation that ""won't leave"". They brought out our food at different times resulting in meals to sit there cold for at least 20 minutes. Some orders weren't what we ordered. The checks were all screwed up. The largest pizookie came out with not enough plates for serving, having to wait for more plates the ice cream melted. Management was not attentive, welcoming, or apologetic. Waiters were fine so the food coming out and seating arrangements were beyond their control. The food was ok. But next time we will go back to TGI Fridays in Costa Mesa were they always handle our large parties perfectly."
Michael B.,"Westminster, CA",99,97,52,4.0,11/25/2013,Certainly better than the Huntington Beach location.
Lydia R.,"Placentia, CA",2,9,5,1.0,3/15/2014,"Service was terrible! Went here to meet some old friends for dinner and catch up. Our cocktails were horrible from the bar, we sent them back. Food was ok, nothing special. Only reason I gave them 1 star was the pizookie is always the bomb! Would not go back to this location but maybe another."
Tiffany N.,"Newport Beach, CA",144,87,12,2.0,2/10/2014,"To be honest I never liked the restaurant for their food. Their drinks are great, granted it's like $10 each which is in all honesty not worth it no matter how delicious it was. The service was okay she only came like twice? Never came back to see how we were doing and we were a party of 7 towards the end of the night so she should have been more attentive. Most of us didn't even want to tip her. My boyfriend and I got the crispy calamari and a small deep dish pizza. The calamari was not crispy so we actually had to send it back. The pizza was warm, not out which is weird since they just made it right? It was to the point where I pointed out the cheese was melting, it was melted as if it was made and then reheated. We got home and said we're never going to eat there again. It didn't help that I got nauseous and then threw up. Sorry BJ's. You're just not cutting it out for us"
Bob D.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,3,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Very poor service. 10 minutes after seating no sign of waitress.  I asked two other waitresses for service, they responded it was not their area and walked away. Then went to hostess station to ask to see the manager. They looked for him or her and after 5 minutes indicated they could not find them. As we started to head out the door someone finally appeared.  A few nights later we went to the Lazy Dog in Anaheim. Much better service. So save yourself the aggravation and go there."
Derick H.,"Tustin, CA",0,9,,5.0,5/30/2015,"Just had dinner with friends. Food was good, service was very good. It took 40 minutes for a table but Saturday night so I guess not bad. It was a little louder than I expected it to be but that is part of the fun."
Cleo J.,"Compton, CA",140,10,9,4.0,1/12/2014,I love coming to BJ's and getting the Pale Ale Burger!!! It's my go to choice everytime and it hasn't let me down yet!!! Yummmy delish!!!
Dinner T.,"Norwalk, CA",1,10,,5.0,3/6/2014,"This place has the most amazing desserts.  The pizookie is delicious we all loved it. The service was good, we will definitely come back."
Bao L.,"Garden Grove, CA",231,40,,4.0,1/2/2014,"I generally dont review franchise reataurants. My server (peter, bald dude) gave my girlfriend and I exceptional service. Franchise restaurants I expect mediocre service and decent food. Food was good. Service was beyond awesome (server was attentive and informative). Food kinda took long to come out. Overall im happy. The busser hustled to give us a seat as well. We came during late night happy hour and there were no clean tables. He saw us standing there and wiped one down immediately."
Isable M.,"Santa Ana, CA",19,8,3,3.0,4/12/2015,"The food is great! Love their pizza! The hostess on the other hand was not very friendly. It was not very busy and it took too long to get a table. Love the place, front of the house could use more training on costumer service!"
Lillie K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,4,5.0,8/3/2013,Love this restaurant soooo much! I don't think I can say one thing bad about it :) there was a little bit of a wait but everyone was served a delicious pizza and waiters going around asking if we want drinks (free refills)! The menu was huge with so many options for every taste bud!! Service was fast and the staff was incredible but not pushy like annoying! You felt like they were there to serve you and not to mention there were some super cute waiters!! I had the fettuccini Alfredo which was the best I'd ever had! I'd totally recommend BJ's hands down!!
JoAnn H.,"Santa Ana, CA",94,1,,5.0,2/28/2014,"Had a great time at BJ's tonight with my husband. Over the last year my husband and I haven't been able to go out by ourselves. We had Allyssa T. for our waitress and she was great. She checked on us frequently made sure we were ok, had everything we needed and recommended a couple drinks that were right on target with what we wanted.  Service was great and the food was good also."
Joel R.,"Orange, CA",1,17,,1.0,2/28/2015,"It pains me to write this review, but you deserve it.  I like BJs very much. I eat there frequently. Because I eat there frequently I joined their rewards program. I have a smartphone app that let's me check In at the hostess so they know I'm in the rewards program and it keeps track of my points. What's really cool is the mobile pay feature. It let's you pay your check from your phone and just leave. At least in theory.  Today I had lunch with my family at this location. Checked in with my app at the hostess. We ordered and ate a tasty lunch. I asked the server to apply the $10 off I earned with reward points. I paid the boll with my mobile pay app. I even calculated the top I gave the server on the prediscounted amount. Didn't want to short him. My family and I leave to get in our car. WHY IS OUR SERVER CHASING US INTO THE PARKING LOT LIKE WE STOLE SOMETHING? Because he thought we skipped out on the check. I told him I used mobile pay. He wanted to see it on my phone. At that point, I got angry. I asked for the manager. After a protracted wait, a young lady came out to speak to me. I explained what happened and asked why I was chased into the parking lot by the server. She said ""sorry, he should have known you paid."" That's it. Thank you Captain Obvious!   Attention BJ's Corporate folks: You need to do a better job training your servers how to handle mobile pay transactions. Chasing your loyal customers into the parking lot after they pay their check really leaves a bad taste after a nice meal. And before you let anyone in your store represent themself as a manager, how about a little customer service  training. Just a little. The young lady I encountered had none.  Overall, your great loyalty program upset a loyal customer today because your people were unable or unwilling to do their jobs properly. Congrats!"
