Leslie T.,"Long Beach, CA",388,14,28,4.0,11/13/2013,"I got the cajun pasta here the other day and thought it was just okay. The sauce seems to be very thick and  lumpy as compared to Cheesecake factory's cajun pasta. Overall, the portion fit the price and I was left satisfied after finishing off my meal with a half red velvet and half  cookies and cream pizookie. I definitely recommend any pizookie for anyone who's looking for a light dessert."
Patricia B.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/12/2014,"So disappointed in our meal and service tonight. Server was slow, we had to ask for silver wear, napkins and not once did he refill our waters. Only once did he check on is during our meal and the table was overflowing with dishes since he never removed our appetizer or our main dish plates once empty.  Then there was the food.  My husband and I each ordered a deep dish pizza and both were pretty substandard compared to what we are use to receiving at Bj's. Some slices were huge while others were a tiny sliver and it was 3/4 crust with a small circle of toppings in the very middle which made the pizza very soggy since everything was concentrated in one spot. Then at the end of the meal we asked for 3 pizzokies... Meaning the trio however our server brought out 3 separate and large pizzokies which upped our bill another $20 so that was sucked but partially our fault since we must not have communicated what we wanted well enough.  My mother in-law ordered salmon and seemed happy with her meal so at least one of us enjoyed our meal. Next time I think I would rather drive to the Bj's on beach where we have always gone and always been happy."
Linda T.,"Irvine, CA",2,24,12,1.0,9/28/2014,"Love Bj, but not this location!  1st time was the week of opening.  Benefit of doubt it just open so can't complain much..but took waiter 20 mins to get us water...another 10-15 minutes to take down our food. Ordered BJ's favorite w no olives and it came out to be completely different pizza. They fixed it...bringing out BJ'S favorite w olives..... manager asked for our opinion...told him what happen n they did apologize n gave us free desert. 2nd time Me and my friend each ordered an ahi salad and finished it.  Our server walked by and stated ""dang you killed the plate didn't you. "" she smiles then said ""I'm going on my break should I grab your check?""  I felt she just wanted the entire tip and rushed us to pay.  also, you shouldn't comment whether someone finished their food...that's just rude! 3rd time sat down 20 minutes & no server. Was sick of waiting so I flagged someone down to order our food and drink. (Went around 11ish am, when there was practically only 5 tables being served, so there's no excuse of being busy..Esp when I saw at least 3 diff servers walking around). Ordered Cobb salad & bjs favorite no olives.  BJS came out w olives and they brought out house salad. Told the gal (let's call her Gal A)  that we ordered Cobb. She brought it back in and few minutes later our server came to us blaming the kitchen stating she put in Cobb salad. We finished our pizza waited n waited and finally Cobb salad came out w the wrong dressing.  Gal A then apologized stating our server had written down house salad before. (This is a HUGE deal. Shows this place has no teamwork and everyone points finger). Manager then walks over & asked for our opinion on their services. Both my bf n I didn't want to say anything but he noticed we didn't touch our salad. My bf decided to tell him what happened n he wanted to give us free desert. We told him no thanks. We then flagged down our server and she still acted innocent. ""What kind of desert do you want? It's on me!"" We told her no thanks. She then states ""it's free! U don't want free desert?"" Told her no. During this whole mess,  all she had to do was apologize for the mistake (whether it was her OR the kitchen). They need to have better teamwork."
Elizabeth R.,"Whittier, CA",175,59,18,1.0,12/21/2014,"Thoroughly disappointed! My wife and I had planned on eating breakfast and watching our favorite NFL team play this morning before we hit up the shops at the block! We arrived at 10:45am and were seated in the bar where we asked if the Packer game was going to be on any of the large TV's. We requested to have the packer game played on one of the big screens and were told that she would check because someone may have requested their game. At that time there were six people in the bar area, my wife and I included! As we sat and waited our waitress told us that her manager was on the phone and would ask her when she is off if she could change the game on one of the screens... As more people came in they also asked to have the packer game played on one of the large screens! This did NOT happen! However, after 25 minutes of waiting, without our food coming out either, a group of three people came into the bar and asked for one of the TV's to play their game, the Jets!!! And they changed the channel for THEM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY! My wife and I were so upset we walked out and walked over to Saddle Ranch! The games were evenly spread out and the service was much better! BJs in Orange has lost our business clearly for the fact that they did not show any urgency to customers who had been seated first, waiting and making clearly simple requests! No communication, no apology, no attempt to even offer us another table in the dining room by a tv that could also have been changed to play the Packer game... Over 30 minutes and NO FOOD, NO GAME, terrible customer service as a whole!"
Enjoli P.,"Tustin, CA",32,18,10,4.0,11/24/2013,although our appetizer wasn't quite right and they ran out of the steak let me say this location excels at customer service. Our server Gabriella was amazing and really took care of us and sent Kevin the manager over to ensure we had a great experience. They went above and beyond to make it up to us. I cannot say enough about how impressed I was with their service when things don't go perfectly. That is how you can tell the true value of customer service. We will definitely return to this location
Breesa L.,"Brea, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/29/2014,"Went to bj's tonight . Our server didn't even greet us or come by for about 10 minutes till finally I had a feeling this guy was it since he kept walking by and looking back. It's a Monday night and the place was NOT busy. Finally Juan was our server and came by. First thing that happened he acted like we had just sat down and was over all just RUDE. I may be a younger adult  but I am in the business and still deserve to be treated with respect. Secondly he drops our silver ware roll up on the ground, picks it up and puts it back on our table. He asked me what I wanted to drink and I asked for a ""de-caffeinated"" iced tea. He asked me what's that?"" I then said most iced teas have caffeine do you have one without. He  said none of them did which I KNEW was wrong. I just ordered the tropical because he was so clueless. Sorry if you work in the restaurant you should know which, if any teas are de-caffeinated . Finally we ordered our food, and had the food runner or expo get us everything we needed. He then came by and asked if we needed anything else. Both our drinks were a sip away from empty. Should you really have asked??? We finished quickly because our service was so bad. Food was great as always but wow we were treated so poorly. Safe to say if we go back we will be making sure our server is someone else."
Stephanie D.,"Anaheim, CA",4,27,12,3.0,11/20/2013,"Treat night out with my daughter! Had a fabulous mini make-it-yourself - LOVE the deep dish crust - omg! Sooo yummy! Very nice server. Piranha pale ale - pretty good. Nice flavor. However, one of my biggest pet peeves is when someone brings out a kids meal and says, ""careful, the plate is hot"" - really? Then why would you give that to a kid? Just plain stupid. So I asked for a cool plate to put the dinner on so my child could eat her meal without fear. Then, we both enjoyed the rest if the meal - and an absolutely amazing Bizookie! Other than the bonehead who served a child a hot plate (mine was cool, figures), the meal was great! Note to Management, family-friendly restaurants don't put kids in danger of hurting themselves - better training please."
Rob J.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",0,14,2,4.0,5/25/2014,Prompt curbside takeout. Fresh food. Good atmosphere. I like their pizza a ton. If you haven't tried the pazooki (auto correct doesn't like that word) it's a must. I like the chocolate chip or red velvet. All are good. Mediterranean pizza is to die for. Seriously about died when I ate it. Try their avocado or avacada (depending on where you are from) eggrolls. Boom. Delicious. Gone. Where are more? Great place. Great atmosphere. Love to catch sports here. Great brews too.
Breezey K.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",6,31,70,2.0,11/9/2013,Love B J's pizza but this location needs a lot of work..  I was thrilled they were opening one so close to work but service has been lousy every time.  I'll stick with the Brea BJs thank you.
Nhi Thao M.,"Santa Ana, CA",110,243,1810,3.0,8/31/2013,"My co-workers took me out for a birthday luncheon a couple of weeks ago at this new BJ's restaurant.  We had a reservation for sixteen people.  When we arrived, we ended up being seated at two separate tables of eight that were parallel to each other instead of one long table of sixteen.  My co-worker who made the reservation was a bit disappointed and told the hostess that she was told that we would have one table, not two.  The hostess went to ask the manager, and the manager came out and said that it was easier to seat our group at two different tables because it would be easier to have two separate waiters to each take care of one smaller table than to do one big table, which would take longer to serve.  I didn't really understand that explanation and neither did some of my co-workers (honestly, it just seemed like bad customer service), but we ended up sitting at two separate tables because we didn't want to make a big deal of it.  The waiter who served the table that I ended up eating at was pretty friendly and funny.  I ordered the Black and Bleu flatbread pizza sans the cheese (so it had marinated skirt steak, caramelized onions, flame grilled Portobello mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers and fresh thyme).  It was a good portion for lunch for one person - I originally was going to get the half-pizza with salad, but my other co-worker said that a half-pizza might not be enough, and I ended up being glad I ordered the full pizza because I finished the entire thing and didn't feel overly stuffed at all.  The pizza itself didn't taste bad, but the steak was a bit tough and chewy.  A few of my co-workers shared a large deep-dish pizza and they seemed to like it.  The food took a while in coming out, though, and our waiter actually came and apologized for the delay.  Our waiter also sung happy birthday to me and brought out a mini pizookie (cookie topped with ice cream), which was nice. Overall, I had a good lunch except for the table issue and the long wait for the food, which could have been handled better."
Robin C.,"Yorba Linda, CA",87,11,4,1.0,4/21/2014,"I LOVE Bj's and have been going to their restaurants for years. I was so excited when this one opened up as it is close to my work, however I have been soooo disappointed! The service is awful, I have to ask for refills, they never give me what I ordered, one waiter ran my card and over charged me by $40, I told the manager and it took them 30 minutes to correct the bill!!!!!! I've talked to the manager several times and keep coming back in hopes they change, but they don't. I will not ever go back to this place again!"
Guillermo O.,"Anaheim, CA",331,125,29,4.0,9/18/2013,Is new is nice and the the orange block was in need for something like this great place
Maurice L.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,1,,1.0,4/10/2015,"This place sucks balls cold food, mis served food, 45 minutes for a beer and this is the last place on my restaurant list too ever eat I'd rather go too Mc Donald's to eat so sad...."
Yousef H.,"Cypress, CA",241,13,2,4.0,10/3/2013,"I was in the area so I decided to check out this BJ's. I stopped going to BJ's because of the crappy service I get at the ""Huntington Beach Bella Terra"" location near my work. Surprisingly at this BJ's I was seated right away without a reservation! Yea I know shocking when comparing to my previous experience. Our server Chantal did a excellent job making sure we had our refills and food actually what we ordered. I am giving this BJ's a 4 star which in my ratings book is really good.  If I am ever in the area again I definitely will come back! A from me."
Alex P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/5/2014,"I have been reading some of the reviews from previous customers and majority of them  have been negative and to be honest it's the truth.  Perhaps having that job may not the greatest but at least have a smile on your face while on the clock since the facial expression says a lot from the customers perspective. I didn't feel welcome and maybe it was the fact that our server was more focused on bigger parties to get the biggest tip possible. It would be nice to get good service by trying to make your customer feel welcomed and perhaps she will get more tips. I still tipped her but not because of the service I was given.  Next time If I get poor service then no tip will given.  So far, my day hasn't been going so well specially after the service I have received from Brianna or brittany (I can't really remember her name.) My sister ordered the Brewhouse burger and I did as well; unfortunaly both were lacking flavor and the meat tasted as if was just reheated in a microwave.  Im not sure if these patties are frozen but a whopper from Burger King has better quality ingredients. Im really dissapointed because it is so close to my house.  Im not going back specially if i will be getting bad service along with food lacking flavor and still paying more money than its worth.  I really hope someone can fix the service quality."
Megan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,36,9,2.0,8/14/2013,"I can cut them some slack because they just opened, but their service is still quite poor. They often sit parties by calling out the number of people instead of the name and this can be quite confusing during the lunch rush. And when we were finally seated, we weren't quite sure who our server was as three different people greeted us. The real problem occurred when our vegan friend ordered a veggie pizza with extra sauce to compensate for the lack of cheese. What he got was a pizza with absolutely no sauce. He then asked for sauce on the side and they brought him spaghetti sauce after asking for it twice. The server apologized at the end but didn't seem too concerned. I really like BJ's as a whole and I hope they get their act together soon so that I can go again."
Tanya M.,"Corona, CA",69,4,1,5.0,3/30/2014,Server was attentive and the salmon with rice and vegetables were tasty with a touch of lemon. Not a long wait either for a table of 6. Will definitely go again. Also mini pazookie is my favorite!
Kelli M.,"Irvine, CA",6,32,4,2.0,6/5/2014,"Have to agree with the previous reviewers.  There is something wrong with this BJs.  Really, really poor service.  I go to the BJs in the Irvine Marketplace frequently and they are on the ball there. If you are in the area of the Block, avoid BJs.  Go to Fridays instead."
Judy J.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,14,,1.0,1/22/2014,"Came for lunch will not come back. The waitress was horrible, not friendly, no smile, acted like she did not want to be there. She took our orders and after 15 minutes came back and told us that she threw our orders away and could not remember what we ordered. No apology nothing. She finally brought out the burger and it was dry as dirt, the meat patty was crispy and crumbly. The salad was wilted and brown. Ordered a salad to go and they did not include the dressing with the order."
Deya A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/21/2015,"The way I was treated at this location is not okay. I ordered a veggie patty for my hamburger and when I went to pick it up there was red meat on my burger. This is not the first time they don't get my order correct so I decided to speak to the lady that brought out my order and explained to her that I asked for a veggie patty she then told me no see on the receipt it says hamburger no veggie patty... how is she going to tell me that the receipt is correct and i am not. I told her I understand that's what the receipt says but I asked for a veggie patty and they must of took it down wrong or forgot. She then goes to speak to the manager and my friends and i hear the manager say ""What the fuck she didn't say that"" how unprofessional is that to curse in front of a customer!! I was now really angry and they told me they could give me the burger for free but to change it to a veggie patty would take up to 20 min. I no longer wanted them to help me with anything after how horribly I was treated. I will never be coming back to this location especially with such an unprofessional and rude person running the place."
