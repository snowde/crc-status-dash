Sara B.,"Tustin, CA",202,125,,4.0,9/10/2014,I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed BJs as much as I did at this location! BJs is usually ok but I really enjoyed the service at this location and had the joy of not being frustrated by lack of parking which is almost always what happens when I head out to the Block for dinner! Peter was our server and he was very understanding when I said I had friends coming but they'd be a bit. The hostesses were also very helpful in making sure our visit with a very young baby was given consideration. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps and they were very good! The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the lettuce was all fresh and crisp. The sauces combined were excellent on the wraps! I had the mahi mahi tacos and they were ok. Fish was cooked well but the tortillas were really dry. One friend had the chipotle salmon and she really enjoyed it. She said it had more heat than she had planned but she still liked it. My other friend had the hawaiian mahi mahi and she also enjoyed her dish. Enough so that she ate much more than she normally does. We finished with the peanut butter smores pizookie. It was tasty but so sweet that we each only had a few bites and then we couldn't eat any more because it was too sweet. BTW we usually get the bacon chicken ranch pizza and always have enjoyed it. We ventured out of our comfort zone and we were pleasantly surprised!
Vo T.,"Westminster, CA",237,5,1,4.0,9/3/2013,Thursday night sat at the bar. Felipe worked hard to make his drinks to satisfy all his customers! It was busy but we got everything on time. Thai mango salad is bomb :) Nice location as well.
Glenn M.,"Long Beach, CA",14,8,,1.0,1/13/2014,"Staff is very friendly, extremely attentive and helpful.  The servers however appear to be stoned and kept coming to our table with the wrong food.   This is the second time that i have been disappointed with the food.  This time my grilled chicken club sandwich was warm and soggy.  The thinly sliced fries were cold. - obviously it was sitting there for a while to be delivered to our table.  The majority of our group was served before me and my colleague.  Very disappointing. In my opinion they need a new kitchen manager who focuses on the quality of the food and the timeliness of delivery."
Bradley P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,3,2,5.0,1/3/2014,The food was great but what really stood out was the service. Our server was Jenelle. She was awesome! Anything we needed should took care of right away. She was super friendly and even joined in our conversations multiple times. Best server and service in along time. Thanks Jenelle!
Stephanie S.,"Anaheim, CA",3,7,5,1.0,12/28/2013,"My boyfriend have been to this BJ's a few times since it is a little closer to us. We usually sit at the bar and have no problem with service we receive from the bartenders. The day after Christmas my boyfriend and I decided to meet my family here for lunch. I gave the hostess my name and told her I needed a table for 5. She said it will be about 20 minutes. She didn't give me a pager or tell me that she will be calling my name. Before I could tell her that we will be waiting at the bar, she already acknowledged the people waiting behind me so I justed moved to the side. I figured my boyfriend and I could wait at the corner of the bar next right next to the entrance so we could see and hear them call my name while we wait for the rest of my party to get there. As we sip on our beer at the bar about 10 minutes in, I see the hostess taking people to their tables and these people came in way after us, then 5 more minutes pass by and they are seating people as they walk in.  Then my family arrives and I see a hostess with a few menus walking around asking 2 different parties their names. I assume she is looking for me. So I approach her and ask her if she is looking for Stephanie. She replies ""Uh...no"" as she passes right by me. I thought her response was a bit rude. So I approach the hostess who initially took my name and asked how much longer it would take to seat my party. She then looks one of the hostess and says ""Oh here's Stephanie!"" I looked at both hostess and told them that I have been waiting at the bar and no one has called my name. One of the hostess replied ""We called your name twice"" and I told her that she didn't because I have been staring at them the whole time from the bar which was only a few feet away, and I didn't see one hostess go outside or walk around the front calling my name, but only one time and the hostess who was doing that wasn't even looking for me.  I give this BJ's 1 star because something so simple in reference to find where the party is located after putting their name in and even telling the party to wait close by the hostess booth because they will be calling my name shortly would have been nice. Oh, and the rude hostess who brushed me off needs to learn customer service and instead of replying to me with a ""Uh...no"" she could've said ""I'm sorry I'm looking for another party but what is your name and I can let you know how much longer your wait will be.  I don't recommend this BJ's for dining in and dealing with the lazy and unprofessional hostesses. I'm going to continue eating and drinking at the bar were the bartenders know how to be professional and serve you. If I do decide to dine in at a BJ's I'll be going to Brea or Cerritos."
Geoff H.,"Anaheim, CA",29,8,,1.0,1/2/2015,"Just a plain and frustrating experience- the service was pretty bad and food was nothing special. Waited over 30 minutes for a table (when there were available tables open). The sever took over 10 minutes to come by and offer drinks and waited 10 more minutes to receive them. We asked for some kids menus and the staff didn't bring them, we had to walk up to the hostess desk and get them ourselves- while the manager with their headset on ignored us...the food took 25 minutes to arrive and it was just so-so in quality, missing some condiments, such as BBQ sauce- so we had to ask for it and wait 5 more minutes while the food got cold...the management didn't come around to the tables at all. It seemed that the staff was inexperienced, understaffed and didn't really care about the customer experience or food. Mostly seems to cater to people drinking. Won't return...and we frequent the Outlet Center weekly. There are mush better places there to enjoy."
Marcus W.,"Santa Ana, CA",33,9,,5.0,8/1/2013,"Took the wife and in-laws to dinner last night. Everything was wonderful. Food was good. Service was Great! Big thanks to Courtnie. Very sweet, charming, attentive. We'll be back..."
Nicolle D.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,48,21,5.0,10/10/2014,the five stars are for our unbelievable waitress Coco.   definitely great service and yes the food was great too.   seems everyone here had a great attitude.
Amanda B.,"Orange, CA",1,4,,2.0,12/1/2013,"Do not sit at the bar!!!!! The bar is self seating & we sat at a dirt table for 10 minutes. We alerted another server of the mess & was advised that they would ""send someone"". Our server took our order & my friends food arrived and after several moments our server came over & asked if we needed anything else? I asked the server what was going on with my order? His face was priceless. He clearly forgot my order & blamed the kitchen staff for running behind on orders. I told him to remove the order from the check & to bring our check so we could leave. I've been to many BJ's locations & have never had a problem. If you go here skip the bar seating!"
Yoli L.,"Glendora, CA",0,17,,1.0,1/27/2015,Stopped here to get a quick bite before my meeting. I walked in about 5:00 PM and the bar was not busy at all. I cannot tell you how terrible my dining experience was that night. CHANTAL was my server and I have never been treated so rudely in my entire life. I have always enjoyed going to BJ's but this location will never receive my business again.
Paul D.,"Santa Ana, CA",302,2,,3.0,8/26/2013,"Rheannon, Brett and Heather were awesome! kept our glasses full and our good times rolling!!! can't say the same about my itty bitty chicken Cesar salad :( was barely any different than my buddy's side salad she ordered with her food... and  it was basically a shredded chicken nugget instead of a chicken breast lol but overall, these people made the visit worth it! KUDO's!"
Anna S.,"Garden Grove, CA",31,20,,5.0,1/21/2014,Love this place. Food and atmosphere was awesome. Jacob was our waiter and he was on top of his game. Will definitely come back.
William N.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,39,10,1.0,8/14/2014,What a joke. Went in for lunch. Only 6 tables here. Took 30 mins to get our food and another 20 minutes for the check to be picked up because i had to grab someones attention. Never coming back again.
Donna H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",3,7,,5.0,10/22/2013,"My girlfriend and I decided to meet up here for dinner and a good chat on Saturday evening. I had read the negative reviews but always enjoy Bj's so thought we would still give it a try. Too many people only write reviews when something goes wrong, but overlook all the good times that would be great if you did write a positive review. So we met up and  went to the bar and found a seat to begin the evening off with a great martini...yumm!  We didn't wait to awfully long and was seated, our server Jessica was Awesome...she didn't rush us, but was there when we needed her. I Luv the Santa Fe Salad w/blackened shrimp and my friend had the bleu cheese bacon burger and everything was great! We sat and had coffee and still wasn't rushed and was still taken care of...Thanks again Jessica and Bj's for a great evening...we will be back!"
Crystal P.,"Orange, CA",17,28,45,1.0,3/6/2014,"Came here tonight for a friend's birthday. There were about 14 of us. The service was pretty bad. The waitress looked very annoyed with answering any questions we had.  I'm pretty sure she was new.  We waited for about an hour to get seated, another hour to get our food and another hour to figure out how to pay.  My boyfriend also asked for some hot sauce and ranch and by the time they brought it to him, he was pretty much done with the food.  The waitress didn't really bother to bring us refills either.  My friends had to ask for refills and had to wait at least 20 minutes for them.  She never asked me if I wanted another refill, so I was just over it and didn't want to wait any longer.  We each wanted to pay for our own orders separately and most of us had our debit cards.  When we told the waitress, she said we could only split the check 2 ways.  After my boyfriend argued with the manager, he let us split it 3 ways. It was all just a huge mess.  They made it more complicated than it should have been.  How can you not do split checks??  This waitress didn't know what she was doing.  We each had to figure out how we were gonna pay it all in 3 checks and after we paid, the waitress comes over and tells us we still owe money.  I looked over the receipt thinking how that was possible and they had over charged us.  She finally fixed it and then came back saying we needed to pay the tax still.  By this point we were all beyond ready to leave.  None of us even felt like leaving a tip, since the service was so bad.  We all left one anyways.  After what seemed like forever, we finally got it all taken care of and left.  I don't think I'll ever be returning.  The pizza is expensive and tastes pretty mediocre.  It's really nothing special.  As for the service, this is the 2nd time I go to a BJ's (last time was the one on Jamboree) and the service has never really been good.  I understand this is a pretty new location, but they have A LOT to work on.  We were all so frustrated.  I will not be returning."
M P.,"ELKINS PARK, PA",5,68,,2.0,9/2/2014,"Well, we were seated and then our waiter came by about 10 minutes later to tell us he was a bit behind.  Ok... that can happen.  He took our drink orders and our app orders and we didn't see him again for a bit.  It was freezing in the restaurant too.  The waiter came for out dinner order but then he didn't have a pen so left us again.  In the mean time, we overheard a table behind us complaining that they didn't see the waiter either.  He took our dinner order and the apps came out.  They were ok. Nothing great.  It's like the oil temperature wasn't high enough because the fried calamari wasn't very crispy and it did lack a lot of flavor.   It took 45 minutes from the time we were seated til our dinner came out.  The food was decent but the service was just horrible."
Kathy K.,"Irvine, CA",0,10,1,3.0,11/13/2014,I went there tonight. The fish was very overcooked and the service was very slow. I dont think ill be coming back soon.
John P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,4,2,5.0,11/29/2013,"Fantastic service from Brittanasia, Jessica and manager Chris! Food was outstanding as  always! BJ's is a MUST when visiting The Outlets at Orange!"
Jenna L.,"Orange, CA",2,21,5,1.0,8/25/2014,"This specific BJs sucks. They have the slowest service ever, and I've been during the off times (4:00pm on a Monday). Today it took 10 minutes for us to get two waters then another 30 minutes to get our food which was only a pizzookie and chicken wraps. Terribly frustrating."
Alexandria C.,"Anaheim, CA",4,11,,3.0,5/24/2014,"Been here a couple times for drinks at the bar, but never for food. Service at the bar I have to say is way better!  The host at the entrance was rude. They took way longer than estimated time to seat us. When I approached Kevin, the manager, about the situation he seamed very careless and said ""well we are seating you now.""  After being seated, I ordered my food and was specific that my Grilled Chicken Club sandwich had no bacon (because I am allergic) and it came out with bacon. They took it back and made me a new one.   By this time Kevin was aware of the situation and offered to make me ""the best Caesar salad."" The salad was very bland. So I asked the waiter to take it back. When my sandwich came back, it had no avocado. So they took it back again. By this time I was just annoyed and lost my appetite.  The only reason why I am giving them three stars instead of one is because Kevin tried to fix the situation by paying for my meal, drinks for everyone At the table, and for dessert. I appreciate the effort, thank you, but next time I will just stick with the Yard House"
