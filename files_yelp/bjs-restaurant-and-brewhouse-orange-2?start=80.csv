Mike G.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,96,10,1.0,3/10/2017,"So , I ordered a pizza there!  ALL DOGH ?  Was there last week,  I would just like to inform all other patrons that go here,  don't make the mistake I did , getting a pizza to go.  It's all dough!! no cheese and very little sauce ?  Extremely disappointed!!!! I get pizza once a month,  the pizza I got from little Cesar's  had way more cheese and sauce! That's sad!  Maybe the management team for this restaurant will  improve this prob?     29.00 for an all dough deep dish is sad.,..."
Arvin T.,"Long Beach, CA",60,6,2,2.0,4/15/2017,"2 stars only because my girlfriend liked her spaghetti.  So while choosing a place for dinner I thought, ""hey we haven't been to BJ's in a while"" now I remember why.. Drinks came out 20 minutes after we ordered them, said he'd be right back to take our order, 20 minutes passed, came back in another 17 minutes and said ""oh your food hasn't come out yet?"" Waited for another 15 minutes. Asked for a refill on a Dr Pepper and Parmesan and pepper for the pizza, another 8 minutes and this place wasn't even busy!! I swear our waiter had short term memory and stood at the bar where we could clearly see him having a conversation and ear rub from a co-worker. Another thing, don't advertise it as a deep dish when it's dough halfway up and barely any toppings. You seriously disgrace the name ""deep dish"" and need to cut it out, this is coming from a native born Chicagoan! You're dropping the ball big time BJs. I won't be back again until I forget how bad this trip was."

Kieu T.,"Irvine, CA",181,116,203,3.0,10/22/2016,"BJ's is one of those places that you go to if you want to hang out with friends, drink beer and eat something mediocre.  I come here a lot because it's a five minute drive from the hospital that I work at. We usually come after work for their happy hour which ends at 7pm. The drinks are great; they have a good assortment of beers and cocktails. Some of the appetizers are great like the wings and the calamari, but I would say the rest of the food is not that great.  I've had ever pasta dish they make; the best one is the angel hair pasta with shrimp; and it was just ok. I recently had the penne with shrimp and asparagus and it was not good at all. The pasta was undercooked and asparagus was overlooked. It had no seasoning what so ever. My friend got the steak with Brussels sprouts. He asked for medium rare and it was over cooked to medium well. The Brussels sprouts were so overlooked that it was mushy. It was also underseasoned. The other negative thing about this place is the wait to be seated. It's always so ridiculously busy that the wait is usually over and hour. We never wait though, we try to find a seat in the bar/lounge area and if there is none, we go elsewhere. It's the place is not really worth the wait."
Hannah N.,"Santa Ana, CA",16,37,15,5.0,6/30/2017,"I'm surprised with all the mixed reviews! I love coming to this BJ's and have been here quite a few times in the last month or two. We've always had GREAT service and insanely amazing waitresses. They've always been so nice to us. I went on Monday night for dinner with my best friend and boyfriend and their food is always so good. I ordered the baked ziti (always a favorite), my boyfriend got the Great White pizza (and on mondays, deep dish pizzas are half off!!) and my friend got some lemon chicken dish. We all loved our food and I ordered a Pink Cadillac and it was AMAZING. I don't really like alcohol but that was so good.  I'm sad to see such bad reviews from others. Maybe we just get really lucky with our servers."
Simon C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",240,66,108,4.0,10/16/2016,"BJ's is just one of those good feel/bar places to relax, chat, and watch football or basketball.   The reason it deserves a 4 star is because of the food and service. The quality of the service was amazing.  I never ran out of water, and I didn't need to ask for refills.  For me, that's huge.  Also the waitress was very energetic and willing to get things done for us as quickly as possible.  We ordered a BJ's special pizza and it tasted great.  However, I took off one star because the pizza was a little more on the dry side; it lacked oil.   Other than that, besides the food and service, there really isn't much that could go wrong by going to BJ's."
Joseph V.,"Santa Ana, CA",57,5,2,5.0,6/23/2017,I typically come in and sit in the bar area. Whether with friends or on a lunch break. I have absolutely no complaints about this location.  On a weekend night it is very busy and there may be one or two bartenders for the whole establishment. I can see how this may be frustrating to some.  Based on the reviews I've read I feel like someone has to say something positive. It's easy to get mad and write something negative. A full bar top and a whole restaurant to make drinks for makes for a busy night for bartenders. Maybe management should consider a back bar for tables. Just my two cents.  Keep up the hard work!
Paula V.,"Garden Grove, CA",212,86,203,2.0,4/11/2017,"My least favorite BJ's location. I appreciate the food and relaxed ambiance that generally every BJ's Restaurant has to offer, but ever since this one opened in Orange, I feel that it hasn't been able to get on its feet.  Service has consistently been slow and confused in my experience. My parents wanted to eat here for a family dinner, and it was the general consensus that we should have eaten elsewhere. Most BJ's that I frequent have a more laid back vibe over the sports bar vibe, however this restaurant was so loud that my family and I constantly had to repeat ourselves to the waiter and to one another just to have a conversation. The service left much to be desired as my dad's beer came out before all of our waters, our food came out before the silverware, and my brother's Sierra Mist was accidentally refilled with water. I never had any particular problems with the food at this location, however my mom was quite disappointed that her steak was dry. I ordered the Peruvian Bowl with Salmon which was okay--I was satisfied. Despite the overall negative experience, our order of the Monkey Bread Pizookie saved the night. The only reason this review has two stars is because of that tasty and sweet dessert.  I visited this location the past few times out of convenience and proximity to my home, but in the future I will opt to drive to the Cerritos location."
Nicole C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",148,3,,5.0,10/1/2017,Jared is an amazing bartender. He has been so help and attentive and i honestly plan on making my sunday morning football games to be here. Great food and great service. Thanks jared.
Julisa Y.,"Oxnard, CA",55,30,93,3.0,3/16/2017,"I just coming back out the town I decided try Something different so I have a clam chowder with the bread also I have a pasta without meat and steak, great customers service but  I have a pasta not that taste and too salty hopefully will change to not too salted thanks BJ"
Michael H.,"Buena Park, CA",7,5,2,1.0,3/21/2017,"I have not been here before nor will I ever go back! Our server was cool totally forgot his name but, a colleague and I ordered the ahi poke and the first bite was super fishy  tried to not complain and really didn't want to say anything since we were there celebrating her birthday!  She ordered the same thing and spit it out right away so it wasn't just me. The server placed our order on the fly with the kitchen so it came out super quick.   A manager came out in between that and apologized and said they were having a chef look into it and assured us our meal was going to come out quickly and asked if he could do anything for us and commented before walking away that the fish was cut fresh daily.   My husband is a professional chef in the business for going on 15 yrs now and we eat alot of fresh poke and sushi and it was either just a end of tail shit cut or just a poor quality tuna. It was not even properly cut left in long strips of scored up tuna.  We ordered the cherry glazed salmon and the spinach isreali couscous with asparagus. It was pretty good until I found a STUCK to my plate tiny black hair on the edge of my plate.   After discussing it with the people we went with we decided not to say anything else because I didn't want anyone to think to think I was complaining just to get a free meal and just post my review. This is not the topper yet!!!! You ready.................douche bag doesn't even discount our meal I mean really with your stupid comment the fish is cut fresh daily. Well guess what go tell your chef or whoever places your order if your serving raw fish make sure it's quality and/or center cut pieces.  It's okay your young and and have alot to learn. I asked our srever for the mangers name that came to speak to us and he stuttered and said one name I didn't understand and then he said Tanner it's Tanner. Either he didn't want to give up his manager's name or he didn't know it which I highly doubt.   So I left feeling nauseous and disappointed!!!  Eat at your own risk..."
Carlina B.,"Santa Ana, CA",26,30,2,1.0,8/12/2017,"Waited a hour for our food  thats crazy, specially when the place is not even packed!   Never again coming here very disappointed...."
Aarron W.,"Orange, CA",473,526,407,4.0,1/3/2016,"I can only share my experience, so for me I had a really good time eating here with no issues whatsoever.  I think if you come here you really have to level set your expectations--- this is a chain restaurant that specializes in the basics ( pizza, burgers, tacos), so I don't recommend ordering  anything complex ( rib-eye steaks, ribs, etc)--- just stick to the basics.  We ordered tacos, burgers, and the kids had chicken tenders.  BOOM. Came out perfect-- I really liked the grilled mahi mahi tacos b/c I didn't leave feeling like I just ate 2000 calories.   Perfect for lunch.  The manager checked on us, and the waitress was on point.  We came here during the off hours ( TIP)  so we got in and out.    Looking forward to going back when its not busy :) #3"
Melena M.,"Anaheim, CA",0,29,3,2.0,8/12/2017,"The food was great, the desserts are the best. but my waitress, took a very long time just to bring water. then we waited another 15 minutes for her to come back and take order. When our order arrived, it was wrong. all three of us got another families order. we usually go to the BJ's in Huntington beach. But wanted to try this one at the Block, and was disappointed at the service. Again the food tasted great, but we waited almost a  full hour to eat something , on top of our 30 min wait just to get a table. if you don't mind bad service and waiting to eat, the food is great. but if you are hungry or have hungry kids , this is not the place for you ."
Taj S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,16,1,1.0,2/11/2017,"I cannot believe the service I received tonight.. TERRIBLE!  First off we asked for ranch with our appetizers it took 15 mins for the ranch to come out... so our apps got cold. Then the main dishes come out my girlfriends meal is missing her French fries. My food came out I didn't even have any silverware and the waitress finally noticed something was wrong when I didn't touch my food we were already fed up by this point. So we didn't even wanna get a pizookie when she asked we said no literally 4 are times ... ""are you sure"" yesssss we are sure we told you 4 times before. This bjs sucks go to the one in HB where they actually seem to give a crap about their customers. Never again"
Tom S.,"Westlake, OH",0,34,13,3.0,9/18/2017,"Stopped in this place when I was in orange county for the day.  Set down in the bar for happy hour and ordered the brewhouse burger, their hopstorm ipa and their amber. Bill came to ~16.  The service was good. Gave 20 for food service even though they were busy with football games going on. When you order, The orders go on some sort of handheld device which I thought was kind of unusual but fine.   I didn't really care for the burger. It was a little slimy & oily even on the bun. It wasn't bad I guess. Pretty standard bar burger. Fries were good.  The place is ok. They had a good selection of beer to choose from although  i thought their beer (which was on happy hour) was just ok. Not bad just ok. Overall not a place I'd recommend but solid if you're hungry. I felt the happy hour pricing was good.  6 dollar hamburger (cheese extra) 4 dollar all bj pints.  Skip the hopstorm. The amber is better"
Ivy W.,"San Diego, CA",196,22,8,5.0,3/4/2017,"Omg. I love this place. Found this place on yelp and glad we came in. Many Korean BBQ places in the area and though I haven't tried the others I'm definitely coming back.  Food: very high quality and I great how they cook and cut it for you. There are many side dishes and my favorite was the raw crab. Service: quick, waited no longer than 3 minutes to be seated and the food came out right away with the side dishes already on the table. If you need something they'll bring it right away and it may be because it's busy so they have a lot of people but its great how they accommodate the business traffic. Will be back soon."
Lexi M.,"Orange, CA",16,55,28,4.0,4/17/2017,This was my first time at BJ's and it will not be my last. Came here with friends for free pizookie day and ended up drinking and eating our weight in $4 craft beers and $10 burgers because it was Wednesday! Our waitress was super personable and attentive. ( if she is reading this we were the table that the weird kid took a shot of ranch dressing ) The food was hot and delicious and prepared as asked (medium and medium rare ) Their craft beers were excellent and there's a pint to go with whatever you order.   I can't wait for payday so we can come back.
Carmen M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,1,5.0,11/30/2017,"This particular location is the nearest one to me so I've been here many times. This last visit however, our server Rick!!!! Hands down the best customer service in all my visits to any BJ's. He was super friendly, personable, genuine and efficient!!! Thank youuu Rick for the great service!"
Lindsey M.,"Burbank, CA",7,18,3,3.0,2/4/2017,Don't order the side of asparagus. Not worth the money. The portion size is ridiculous.
