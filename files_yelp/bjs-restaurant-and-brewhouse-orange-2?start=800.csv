Jeremy D.,"New Lenox, IL",1,5,,3.0,11/1/2014,Sat at the bar. The service was attentive enough for a Saturday night. I ordered a Negra Modelo draft. I saw the bartender pour it from the Negra Modelo tap but it didn't taste like Negra Modelo. Either the wrong beer hooked up or the lines need to be seriously cleaned.
MR. T.,"Fullerton, CA",5,57,5,1.0,8/20/2014,"WORST DINNER EXPERIENCE EVER!  Terrible experience.  25 minutes to get food order.  Next burger was well done when asked for a medium.  Returned 10 minutes later charred and harder than before.  Returned burger AGAIN!  They took it off the bill and gave us a free ice-cream dessert.  Wow that really makes up for me not eating dinner.  No refill until an hour into our meal.  Finally had to request a refill and that took ten minutes.  Then asked for extra bbq sauce, another 10 minutes.  I timed this on my phone because the wait was ridiculous.  TOP IT OFF, my son threw up in the middle of the night and my wife's stomach is achy too.  We shared the pizza and my stomach hurts as well.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PLACE.   They gave me $20 card to come back, HECK NO.  I will be calling them again tomorrow morning and letting them know once more how terrible our experience was.  I have my receipt by the way and the things you took off just in case you think I'm wasting my life by just randomly making this up 1:37 in the morning."

Angela K.,"Lake Forest, CA",13,11,3,1.0,9/20/2014,"The food was good, it's BJ's, pizza and pizookie, of course it was delicious! The Irish Root Beer was fantastic! The service however was TERRIBLE. We got water while we reviewed the drink menu to make our cocktail decisions. While it was humorous when the waiter accidentally poured iced tea into my husbands water to refill it, that was the beginning of the horrible service. We waited for about 20 minutes after beers were ordered for the beer to be brought to the table. Then after the beer was finally delivered it took about 20 more minutes for our order to even be taken and only after flagging down the waiter. The food came out in average time, however the pizza was delivered, then 15 minutes later came the plates, once again after flagging down the waiter. My Irish Root Beer was ordered before the food, then I had to order it again when we asked for plates for our pizza. Not sure what happen or why it was like this, the restaurant wasn't very busy. The manager on duty was understanding and apologized profusely. Can't say we would be in a hurry to revisit this location."
Erika B.,"Bellflower, CA",90,6,1,1.0,9/9/2014,"Server was slow, took 30 minutes for a bowl of soup, that was cold, then another 20 for the pizza..the new bowl of soup brought out was brought only after i had eaten most of my pizza... order two pazookies one came out after 20 min, the other never made it to the table until we called on the manager. He then got the pazookie and it was not the one we oredered. The manager did not care that the servce sucked, and then told us ""well if you didnt want to pay for the meal you didnt have to""  the meal was less than 40 dollars smh. Bad experience i will continue to go to the one in Cerritos fom now on."
Laesh P.,"Orange, CA",0,7,2,1.0,9/7/2014,"This review being written after my second unpleasant visit to this BJs location. The customer service was mediocre, the food definitely not fresh.  Pizza was cold we sent it back and got another which was a tad bit hotter... Salad was wilted and the chicken wings were also warm (not very good) our pizookie was definitely not freshly baked and the ice cream was very melted by the time it reached our table. Unsatisfying meal we will not come back to this location again nor would I recommend it to anyone !"
Wen H.,"Anaheim, CA",277,78,49,3.0,6/19/2014,Great Location...especially after visiting UCI Medical Center
Joe M.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,15,,3.0,10/11/2014,"I received what I felt was a heart-felt apology from ""Tiffany"" at BJ's, and have since tried it again.  Although I still feel it is slightly over-priced for the amount of food you get for your money, the service as well as the food itself had dramatically improved on this visit.  I feel it's important for me to acknowledge BJ's attempt at rectifying my prior concerns and applaud them for their efforts in doing so."
Melissa S.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,10,1,2.0,10/9/2014,I love the food at Bjs in orange and the atmosphere. .BUT.... the service is horrible. .it is always is slow..no matter what I order it takes for EVER..I have been there for lunch and dinner at it is always the same..If your in a hurry forget about this place!!!
Shelby D.,"Salinas, CA",3,11,22,2.0,3/15/2014,"We came last weekend on a Tuesday and requested a table outside because it was insanely hot inside the building. So they told us the wait would be 30-40 minutes, which was not a problem at all. There was only two of us so we figured it shouldn't take too long. We then watched as all the parties before us and even parties after us got their tables. You'd think that would be because we had requested a table outside but we sat there for about 20 mins watching about three tables outdoors sit empty with dirty dishes on them as all the employees just walked by them and completely disregarded clearing them off. I also saw an employee walking around on her phone carrying a rag. And to make matters worse all the employees were gathered inside talking and laughing. Then when we finally got our table and ordered our food, my husbands salad came early and was only the size of a side salad. I would expect a Cesar salad to be much larger for the price. We also ordered pizookies which took about 20 mins to get to us because our server had forgotten about us and only noticed we were still waiting when she came to let us know she was going on her break."
Chelsea E.,"Orange, CA",1,24,4,3.0,3/10/2014,"Been here a few times always mediocre. Came there other night with some friends, our server was Alan, he got everything right, just had no personality, very textbooky. I'm a server at another restaurant, I know how hard the job can be, but I always try to make it fun. One of my friends ordered a turkey burger? Something on sourdough and he didn't care for it. Said there was no flavor so he kept the fries and sent it back, Alan apologized for it and offered something else (textbook). The thing that surprised me was that no manager came by. If there is even a small problem we are supposed to get a manager right away. He brought us boxes as we finished up and then I could tell he got pretty busy. Our empty plates sat in front of us for over 20 minutes. I even stacked and organized them as best as possible. Several other servers walked by, even a manager and no one grabbed our plates. To me that is unacceptable. I think they definitely need to work on team work. Everyone should help everyone out"
Ryan S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/20/2013,It's a big weekend. My girlfriend is in town from Detroit and I want to gather all of my friends together to introduce her to. What do I pick? BJs!  We had a 12 party group with no reservations and we were seated in 20-25 minutes. That's extremely reasonable. Gave us a lot of time to catch up. The manager Kevin came out and introduced himself to us and told us the seating arrangements he could make for us. He even put out a few pizzas for us to munch on in the mean time. I've never had that happen before.  The food was great and the service was good. Our servers had great senses of humor and delivered the food promptly. They even suggested some seasonal IPAs that me and my friends really enjoyed.  Kevin came back and checked up on us. My girlfriend was in love with BJs. They don't have one in the city she lives in but she's definitely excited to have another Pazookie when she moves out here with me next year.  I'm looking forward to coming here again with her next month when she visits. Thanks guys!
rachel b.,"Anaheim, CA",5,14,2,1.0,7/15/2015,Terrible I wish I noticed all the horrible reviews before I decided to go today. We arrived and the hosts just kept talking and whispering amongst each other. We ordered and had to keep calling other servers over for help. I ordered a Cajun pasta that had no spice or blackened chicken. I sent it back and they NEVER came back! 3 servers knew about it and not 1 came back to our table after that not even to refill our drinks. After waiting over 20 minutes for a remake I called the manager over. I was so pissed at this point. I just wanted to leave the restaurant. Horrible horrible service. We ordered a kids pizza that had no sauce literally peel back the cheese and no sauce! Fish and chips that were so dry and tarter sauce that I believe has ketchup in it because it's literally pink. We walked out without paying a dime. There is no way I would recommend this place to anyone! The manager offered me a gift card but I would not even take it because I would never go back. Save your money and go somewhere else. Horrible hosts.... Horrible servers...Horrible food. I would literally give it a zero!
Eric P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/13/2014,Jeez... Wait for 40 mins? With no definite timeframe of being seated. They kept telling us we would only wait for 20-30 mins and we ended up waiting close to an hour. No complaints about our waitress though.
Laura M.,"Anaheim, CA",116,10,1,1.0,1/5/2014,The last time I will ever go to BJ's this use to be my favorite restaurant. But after my last visit it's no longer an option on where I would even go eat.  There customer service was horrible.  The hostess were very rude. I waited for about 2 hours to get seated.  They kept tellin up we were gonna get seated but then the manager ends up giving our table away to someone else idk who maybe someone he knew but that was very unfair bc we had been waitin for 2 hrs. Then he trys to apologize by giving us a bunch of appetizers after I finished eating my food. My stomach was feelinf weird and I went to the restroom and started puking everything I ate. BJs isn't the one I would ever go too again and I tell that to everyone  I know.
Claudia O.,"Orange, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/6/2014,I came to this BJs and had the worst service and food. After being seated we waited 15 mins until our waiter finally came to ask what we wanted to drink. Since we had been sitting for awhile we already knew what we wanted to order. When our food finally came it was cold. The pepperoni pizza seemed as if it had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile and the waiter forgot all about our other order. My husband had to remind him and when they brought it out it was cold as well. It was all disgusting.
Montserrat G.,"Santa Ana, CA",61,74,22,2.0,8/16/2013,"Out of all the BJ's that I have been this one has been the worst experience ever! Came here for lunch with some co-workers at first everything seemed one, until we found ourselves waiting, waiting, waiting and waaaaiting for our food to come out. The waiter was no where to be seen and when he finally approached our table he said that everything was ready with the exception of the mahi mahi tacos, he said that was holding up the order...really!!? fish takes 45 minutes to cook? and it's just two tacos!? since that was actually my order, I tried to keep calm and nicely told the waiter to go ahead and bring out the rest of food so that my co-workers could start eating, he said ""Sure, It will be right out in two minutes!"" then suddenly again we were waiting, waiting and waiting....after 20 minutes (by the way our lunch hour was already up), he brings out the food and turns out my tacos were made but there was a flatbread that was forgotten for another co-worker!!! The manager came and apologized and what not and the flatbread was not charged but the service was just beyond ridiculous! by the time we got our food it was cold and we had to eat in a rush. I understand that the restaurant is new and I am sure things are getting settled but don't lie about what's holding up the food and at least bring out chips and salsa while you have your guests waiting for an hour to get their food!"
Bobani I.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,9,1.0,8/27/2013,"Service was good that's why gets a star but the food was horrible, can food taste better than that. If u go only for drinks is fine but NO FOOD unless u want to eat garbage food!"
Lorie S.,"La Habra, CA",36,10,,1.0,7/25/2014,"Like a lot of these reviews our experience was bad. My daughter was in town and wanted to go to one of her favorite places and she was really excited which quickly burst her bubble. We ordered drinks which took awhile, then ordered an appetizer which too awhile and ordered lunch. I ordered a kids cheese pizza (as I can't eat a lot of food at one time since I had a surgery and also I am a senior). I ate my daughters salad which was the wedge and I have never had a wedge salad with the core in it so they brought me another one which looked all torn apart. Then the lunches came and my daughters BBQ chicken pizza came with tomatoes which she ordered without so that had to go back. She got her pizza when all the rest of us were done with our lunch. Then we get our bill and I was charged for a regular pizza and there was another issue with the bill so we asked to speak to the manager. My daughter started to explain to him the problems with the bill starting with my pizza and his comment was ""she isn't a child"". If they don't allow seniors or anyone other than kids to order off the kids menu they should have said that when we ordered. He totally had an attitude and took the bill and made the adjustment. Then to go in the restroom and it was a mess. I would not go back to this location again!"
Kathleen T.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,9,,2.0,4/12/2014,What is the deal with BJ's? The food is decent but the service consistently SUCKS!  Took over 60 minutes after my daughter and I ordered for us to get our food!  Turns out they forgot to submit our order! They got to buy our meal!  They tried to get away with just buying our dessert- but after waiting an hour- I wasn't having that!
