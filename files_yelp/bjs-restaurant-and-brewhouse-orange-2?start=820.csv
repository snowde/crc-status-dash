Anthony S.,"Long Beach, CA",1,3,,5.0,1/21/2014,"Good food, nice atmosphere, and good service. The real reason to visit this particular BJ's though, is the manager Kevin. Not only did he single handedly solve every issue in the restaurant, world hunger, and cure cancer while delivering my wife's first child; but he then turned around and disarmed a 10 megaton thermonuclear device set to go off during this year's Superbowl using only a herring, some duct tape, and half of a plate of leftover spaghetti. As if that weren't enough, he then kicked a record distance field-goal that won the Superbowl for both the Broncos AND the Seahawks AT THE SAME TIME! This elicited cheers from the exhuberant crowd at the restaurant, and I pee'd my pants with excitement. Though I am male, I want to have his baby. I'm sure his manhood is impressive. So impressive in fact, that I now declare it the 8th AND 9th wonder of the world. Bottom line: if Kevin puts a steaming turd-on-a-plate in front of you, his powers of pursuasion are such that you WILL be convinced that it is filet mignon, and you WILL take it and say thank you. Kevin should rule over all of us in magnanimous glory for all time. ALL HAIL KEVIN THE PROFESSIONAL!!!"
Wade M.,"Orange, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/23/2015,"My daughter came home for a week from college in Boston. On the day she arrived home she wanted to do family dinner at BJ's with her grandma and myself.  We were seated and our server, Patrick, introduced himself and took our order. The food was good, the environment was clean, and it was an overall good experience... except for Patrick.  I have been to restaurants around the world, and I can honestly say that Patrick was by far the greatest example of customer service that I have experienced. He related well with each of us, great sense of humor, and went above and beyond to make sure we had an awesome experience. I was so impressed by the service received that, upon leaving the restaurant, I stopped and asked to speak with the manager. So often managers hear all the complaints that I felt it so very important to let him know of what incredible service that Patrick had provided. It was a special evening for our family and Patrick made it even better - thank you Patrick !!  We will most definitely be requesting you the next time we visit BJ's in Orange!"
Lauren H.,"Orange, CA",103,19,6,1.0,9/26/2013,"This place is a disaster. First off let me say I have worked in the restaurant industry for a good while now. I actually was an ex bjs employee. And I love the policies of how to expedite amazing customer service to the paying guest at the restaurants. But let me say this place is a disgrace to the bjs  corporation. The servers are absolutely rude, and do not know how treat their own customers who are tipping them. Not just that, the manager was rude as well. My friend from out of state, she had ordered a drink. Mind you she is 23 years old. The server took the ID and the manager came over Did not say hello and say what was the problem, and began to interrogate her. Then Gave it back and left. The food and drinks too forever and was tasteless. Though the hostess and host were sweet. There were so many things done wrong that I would write an essay to explain everything. But in a whole, do not go here."
Buck R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/16/2014,"I come here sometimes at lunch, and I would give more stars if it wasn't for the deplorable lunch-time service. This place is poorly managed and not logistically equipped for high-volume customers, they quickly become overwhelmed. Last time, on a quick lunch break, we placed out order 4 minutes after being seated. After 45 minutes, still no food. Our food came out after 50+ minutes, so we tracked down the manager and he told us our food came out 13 minutes after the server turned in the order. We told him we placed our order 50 minutes prior, but we were more or less dismissed without even an apology or discount. We didn't have time to eat, had to take it to-go, and went right back to work without eating lunch. This happened just like that 3 Fridays in a row. My work group learned our lesson and will no longer be returning."
Leo R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,,2.0,2/8/2014,"Good selection of beers, but he food is mundane at best, and the service is horrible."
Ramy H.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,30,6,4.0,12/22/2013,"Loving the fact that they are now at The Block! Came in an was quickly seated! I was delightfully surprised when I ordered pasta here. American places usually make pasta filled with a chedder or nacho-like sauce.. But at BJ's its pretty good! After that my boyfriend and I ordered a pizzookie as usually and was not let down, every bite was full of gooey, crispy, and sweet goodness."
Diana L.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/17/2014,I ordered a pulled pork sandwich to go. While eating my sandwich I pulled out a six inch hair through my teeth. The hair did not belong to anyone in my household. I'm pretty sure the cooks/food preps are supposed to wear hats or hair nets. YUCK!!!!!!!!
Rachael T.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,7,,5.0,2/20/2014,"How can you not love bjs?Amazing bar, beer, food and dessert!!! Always a good time here :)"
Brittany N.,"Westminster, CA",252,21,42,3.0,10/25/2014,"My boyfriend and I were craving for some oreo pizookie and decided to get a flatbread pizza while we were at it. Finding convenient parking was easy, getting seated was quick,  but waiting for our server took forever. After taking so long to take our order,  Natasha (I believe that was her name) continued to neglect our table. We had to ask for tobasco sauce 3 times, for napkins 3 times, and for our bill twice. That's right. We had to ask for utensils which didn't even come out until I was finishing up my last bite along with the tobasco sauce. And to make it worse, my hot chocolate came with hardly any chocolate; just chocolate flavored water. When I finally did get her attention, she offered to bring me another pack of chocolate so I can mix it myself?  No thanks. That's just awful. Also my boyfriend's peach berry iced tea had warm syrup still at the bottom. Gross. The next one they brought out had the same problem and for some reason they brought out two. Whatever we didn't even touch it after he tried the second one. Needless to say she only got a 15% tip. All in all 3 stars because the whole experience wasn't all that bad. Very clean and beautiful patio out back. Heaters made the night very nice to dine outside. I do want to come back to try their new s' mores pizookie though. Maybe I'll just request one of the other servers that helped us out, Juan."
phil p.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,20,20,1.0,8/5/2013,"1st I love other locations I have 2 near my home. The one in orange happens to be near my work. I arrived 30 min early and requested a table for 15 (we were there for happy hour). The staff and the manager told us that happy hour only applies to the small bar area ( the bar is long but the bar seating area is not so spacious). Then the manager told me that there is a 2 hour time limit for our table (really? a time limit? wth!)at the 1:45 mark the manager tells us that the happy hour applies to our table also unfortunately that was 15 min before it was over and our party was walking back and forth from the bar.  at 2 hours we're still ordering food and drink and he said our 2 hours was up and there was a party of 20 waiting (oh they take reservations? they don't) the party of 20 was sat next to us and we remained. i eventually left and some of our party remained the food was good, our server was awesome! the manager had the worst customer service i have seen in a long time!! i will not be back to this location. they are not large party friendly. all members of the party work within walking distance of this place and all were upset at the managers lack of customer service. TGIfriday's is 50 yds away I'm sure they will appreciate our business in the future."
Rajvir K.,"Orange, CA",1,2,,1.0,1/5/2014,We waited 15 mins after being seated and no sign of our server! This was the worst service at a BJs ever!
Sarah G.,"Santa Ana, CA",83,4,,1.0,1/31/2015,Seriously the WORST service I've ever seen! I have been to this BJ's multiple times and every time the service is bad. I continue to give them another chance hoping things would change for the better but tonight was the final straw. My friends and I came after work at around 8:15. When we got there the rude hostess told us it would be about a 25 minute wait. Fine for a Saturday night. Once we were seated our waiter came right away to take drink orders which looking back on the evening was a miracle. He came back with the drinks and I asked him if I could get a water to go with my cocktail. That never came and I had to ask someone else that I saw 30 minutes later to bring it to me. Long story short we had to get the waiters attention for everything and he never once came to our table to check on us. Our plates sat at our table for a good 45 minutes after we were finished eating and we actually had to ask another server to take care of our bill because our waiter was nowhere to be found. Two and a half hours of terrible service and I am never coming back to this BJ's again! I sure hope these employees get their act together because this was ridiculous!!
Mike F.,"Redlands, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/13/2013,Horrible placed an order on the phone and they got it wrong .. Put ur strongest members on the phone not your weakest links !! 45 and still waiting as I wrote this
Priscilla M.,"Artesia, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/20/2013,"I went to BJS with a party of 40 people, although it was overwhelming for them they were extremely nice. Our orders did all arrive extremely apart, so half the party finished and left at least 15 min before. I reserved my party three days ahead and did not receive the call with the menu until that same day."
Jacob J.,"Westminster, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/27/2013,"NEW MANAGEMENT PLEASE!! I love BJ's, I go to Huntington beach religiously, but I will never go back to this one. I have been three times since they opened and it is closer to home, now that we live off the 57 and every time has been a nightmare. So unorganized, Just yesterday I decided was our last time going there, I went with a party of 9 (3 of which were children) and after waiting 1 and a half hours and arguing with KEVIN the worst floor manager ever, we left. When we arrived, the hostess said it'd be 45 minutes for a booth (which was fine with us) when we went in to check she said we were next up as soon as a booth was available, WRONG! after three booths were given to other parties OF THREE! I asked the hostess why we didnt get the booth and she said ""because your party is too big for a booth!!!!) What the F...?! THEN WHY WERE WE WAITING FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF!!? thats when my head almost exploded and I spoke with Kevin (floor manager) who told me IT WASNT HIS PROBLEM!! After I explained why I was upset, he say's ""I'm sorry it's game night and we will get you seated as soon as possible, it's not my problem"" like he didn't even hear what I had just finished telling him. As you can tell I was fumed and will never return, that was the third and final incident. The first incident the hostess forgot our party all together. and the second was the non existent waiter,  SO BEWARE! this is coming from a BJ's Brewhouse lover."
Elia P.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,4,1,5.0,9/20/2013,Love this place! Deep Dish and pazooki are the best! Their service in this location is great
Jeff Z.,"Garden Grove, CA",40,58,,3.0,11/7/2013,"Still going through its growing pains- I'm sure it will get there just like all of BJ's do, currently the staff is great. Manager took care a problem with a food order without us even having to ask. Kitchen is definitely the weak link here- Chefs are struggling to handle the menu items and are not preparing them right- got a small pizza that seemed the be hit and miss for how the topping were adding (one slice dry as a bone no sauce, one had all the toppings etc..) Calamari was completely destroyed by the kitchen 1st way under cooked then happily turned to rubber.  Also hostess struggled with seating and understanding how and where the happy hour pricing applied- Once again just small growing pains- look forward to giving them a 5 star once the settle into their groove :-) but for now only a 3 mainly based on the kitchen and chefs. All other food we ordered and it was a lot :-) was spot on and delicious -"
Bre A.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,3,,5.0,10/21/2013,"My friend and I had a really great experience this past Friday. Yes we had to wait a bit before being seated but it was well worth it! Food & drinks were delicious Employees were very nice I have never been to a restaurant where so many waiters made the effort to check in on us to see if we were doing okay even if they were NOT waiting on our table. They also had a good sense of humor! When a waiter would be cleaning off the table next to us, they would casually check in with us and were friendly. Instead of just clearing off the table and getting on with the next thing on their list, they would make an effort to amuse us. One waiter accidentally knocked over some drinks on the table he was cleaning next to us and he apologized even though we did not get splashed a bit! Instead, he started making jokes with us about how much worse it could have been. With it being a busy Friday night, the staff was very friendly and offered fantastic service :) well worth the wait!"
Alyssa T.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,5,,2.0,11/18/2014,"This is the worse BJs I've ever been too. I've been to the ones in brea and in HB and those are by far the best. Nothing was wrong with the food, it was the customer service that makes this restaurant the worse. We came on a busy Sunday night and were told it would be 20 minute wait for the 2 of us. Not a big deal, we waited. 45 minutes later someone who walked in got seated right away! So I asked how much longer since it was now double the time we were told and one of the hostess tells me ""oh sorry we had a big party so we are giving the kitchen a chance to catch up before seating people again in another 30 minutes.""  Once again, not a big deal, things happen. The big deal is instead of the 3 hostess' standing around talking for an hour they could have let everyone know it would be a longer wait. FINALLY as I was walking out I got a text my table was ready.. And it only got worse. We waited 10 minutes for a server to come by. Then another 15 minutes to even get our drinks (not even alcoholic so no reason for the long wait).  By the attitude of our waiter, Tony,  he was obviously having a bad night and was walking around socializing. No need to bore you with the rest of our night cause it dragged along exactly the same. Needless to say... WE WONT BE BACK"
Sherry T.,"Signal Hill, CA",51,74,5,2.0,7/17/2014,"I generally like BJ's for their food and beer selection but I've not been a fan of the service at this location. The restaurant itself is in a great place and very clean. Went for lunch at 2pm 7/16. It wasn't crowded so I figured service should be good. Not so much. Our server was slow and inattentive. We had to stop her everytime we needed a refill or something. And she'd acknowledge with a look of annoyance.  She didn't come by to check on us even though it was a slow time. My friend got double fries but his entree came out with a teeny tiny portion. Another server said, ""oh there's a fresh batch that will be right out"". yeah so as we are all almost done eating, still no fries. We asked someone in a shirt/tie (assuming a manager?) who went to check. He came back shortly after and put them on the table almost as if we inconvienanced him. Not a ""hey sorry for the wait"", ""enjoy your meal"" ""can I get you anything else?"" I probably visit this location 1-2 month as I work nearby. I feel as if the staff have not all been trained very well on customer service skills. They seem indifferent and not particularly happy to be there."
