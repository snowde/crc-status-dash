Rosie G.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/16/2013,"I personally haven't been to a BJ's in years... This place/location actually reminded me why. It's Friday, in the middle of the day and its just me and my boyfriend.  We were seated quickly but didn't see our actual waiter until  like 10-15 later. She took our drink order and didn't receive them until like 15 minutes later. Frustrating because she didn't even bring us water and it was pretty warm outside. She walked out to the patio several times approaching other tables and completely not even looking the other way to see if we needed anything. I had to ask another waiter for service. She looked miserable as if she was having a bad day. Personally some people should really not be waiters if they are incompetent  of smiling and having communication skills. I didn't get the waitress name but only because she didn't give it to me when she approached us lol screw this place!"
