Pam A.,"Miami, FL",20,51,66,4.0,8/23/2017,"This is a go to for a quick meal for a Friday night. They have a full bar and brew their own beer.  If I am feeling skinny my husband and I indulge in their deep dish ranch bacon pizza! And a freshly brewed beer. Their kids plates look like adult plates and both my kids order a pasta that comes with bread knots that are amazing. Their mixed cocktails are also quite good. If we order a pizza , two beers and two kids meals the bill is under 50! Now that's not your healthiest meal but for a Friday treat why not!! They have more variety on their menu and we have tried their tacos and pita wraps which are good to. We definitely enjoy this place as a family nice and large room to make noise and you can even catch a game at the bar."
Idalia D.,"Orlando, FL",96,280,48,2.0,12/20/2017,"Stopped by for my father in laws birthday. There were 9 of us for lunch on a Saturday. They were empty, for a Saturday (lunch time) and I mean empty. Our drinks were never re-fill until we asked so that was a bummer.  The food was over cooked. My sister in law order shrimp and didn't eat them because they were so overdone. I got a salad and it was ok not something to brag about. It definitely could have been a better experience."
Stephanie W.,"Davenport, FL",197,419,116,2.0,10/4/2017,"My family came here for my step-dad's birthday. There were 9 of us for lunch on a Saturday.  They were empty, but service was so slow and my drink sat empty unless I asked.  The food was over cooked. My sister order shrimp and didn't eat them because they were so overdone. I got a flat bread pizza, but didn't even want to take the leftovers home because I just didn't enjoy it. It just feels like they don't take any pride in what they do.  It could be better."
Robert M.,"Alexandria, VA",10,22,4,1.0,9/19/2017,"I'd give this place 1/2 a star but sadly it won't let me.  We ate here last night for dinner and it was one of the worst experiences I've had.  It took over 15 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge we were sitting in his section,  and to ask for water.  Eventually when he came back for our order, the waiter had to come back to verify my order (a simple flat bread pizza) and when the meal was finally served to the table I had the wrong item as did my wife.  They brought me a deep dish pizza, a style and type I did not order.   He never returned to even ask if we wanted drink refills.  It took 30 minutes for him to deliver our checks and, yes, you guessed it, they were wrong.  Which we brought to his attention and then it took another 15 minutes to bring back a corrected version. The quality of the food?  Terrible.  Even though the food was wrong we hoped it would still have taste.  Rather it was tantamount to warmed cardboard with a few pieces of meat thrown on it.   Do yourself a favor and find one of the far better alternatives for a meal.  Avoid this place at all costs."
Lou Ann S.,"Benton Harbor, MI",39,2,1,3.0,1/8/2018,Here with a big group. Salads are out...wedge salad drowning in dressing. Service a little slow but it is a busy night.
Emma B.,"Orlando, FL",52,283,429,4.0,11/8/2017,"Ate here on a Saturday night, managed to get in there before they went on a wait. Service was decent. I had the fish tacos, I had one shrimp and one mahi-mahi. They come with tortilla chips. I preferred the mahi over the shrimp. They were pretty good tacos, I have them again if I was at BJs but wouldn't rush back for them. I also had one of their house beers, which I enjoyed. Not a bad place, better than I expected."
Jason P.,"Saint Cloud, FL",24,61,149,4.0,5/21/2017,"Met up with Friends to eat before heading into a Disney Park.  We picked BJs because it is simple and pretty solid.  Today we arrived and this location was very empty,  so we were sat very quickly.  I typical enjoy a Brew or two but decided against it with the weather and walking a Park.  Their beer selection is pretty big and very good. Food:  As an appetizer, my wife and I got the Mozzarella Sticks.  The plate came out with a lot of Sticks and were very shocked.   Their sticks are very standard but have a great taste.  Always safe ordering these while out. For Dinner my wife got a thin crust Cheese Pizza, she usually orders their deep dish because it is so good but wanted something new.  She was very happy with her choice and said she would get this again.  Myself, I ordered the Boneless Wings with a sauce mix of Garlic Parm and Hot Sauce.(Waitress was very shocked with my request).  These were very good and the mixture was amazing.  I enjoy garlic and love the kick hot sauce provides, so I usually try for this with Wings. All in all, solid food that never disappoint.  Wait staff was extra friendly as well.  Only complaint was the lighting was very low, had to use our phone lights to read the menu"
Frances T.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,6,6,1.0,12/30/2017,"Service NOT GOOD!! Since we enter, they did not even know where to sit us. Hostess.sent us to a table and after 10 mins. I had to look for any kind of service..there excuss was that we were.sitten at a table without the server even being at the restaurant, something that not made sense. So we went with the flow. Beer was warm, pizza with almost NO sauce, server.named JOSH was really rude and felt like a little racist with a somekind.of.ackward.comment and was very hostil. WILL NOT COME.BACK TO BJ ANYWHERE! BAD EXPERIENCE.EVER."
Marta R.,"Orlando, FL",0,5,13,5.0,11/19/2017,Great turn - around experience. I come here all the time for To Go orders after work. Last time though it was super disappointing. I took a chance and called the Manager late night and explained that everything was completely wrong and I actually had to cook the steak myself in order to eat it and I had throw out the sides because they were spicy because it was not specified in the menu that they were. Mr. Rolando offered to pay for the same meal and a couple of extra things if I came in the next day and I did ! Such a sweet gesture great server and Mr. Rolando was very professional and delivered on his promise. Still the best place to eat in LBV. Thank you !!
Jaymie G.,"Redwood City, CA",141,144,17,5.0,12/5/2017,"Thank you so much to Jennifer at the to go Area!! Talk about amazing service and great patience!! Thank you so much for taking the time to get our order (we had 30 different phone orders) and making sure everything was correct!! Being from out of town for an event, we didn't know how to get food for our whole group. But Jennifer made it quick and Easy. Thank you oh so much!!!!"
Amanda H.,"Winnipeg, Canada",10,19,18,5.0,10/8/2017,"We debated whether to go here or not because of the mixed reviews on here. We ended up very satisfied with the food and service! We had no trouble getting a table. We were told the special was half price large or 'Tavern Cut' flatbread pizzas. My cousin and I decided to share a flatbread pizza while my husband ordered baked ziti. We ordered three appetizers between us: avocado egg rolls with tamarind sauce, deep fried artichokes, and Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were slightly over-charred but other than that we enjoyed everything. I really liked the avocado egg rolls. My cousin decided they weren't for her. As others have mentioned, they are an acquired taste. The artichokes were fantastic! We all loved them and had never had anything like them before. I didn't know what they would be like but they were bite sized and battered."
John E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,27,,1.0,12/8/2017,"Left after waiting 15mins for service. The manager and about ten staff members just sat watching. 90% of the restaurant was empty. We walked across the street to Bahama Breeze. Had wonderful service, food and drinks. We will never be back to BJ' s."
Douglas D.,"Orlando, FL",182,81,326,4.0,5/22/2017,"As a usual weekend tradition we decided to stop by this Bjs before going to Hollywood studios. We got there around 130 and we're surprised at how dead the place was. As far as chain restaurants go, BJs is one of our favorites. They are always a safe bet for a good meal. This was no exception. Their menu seems to get bigger every time we come here which usually means it takes me a while to pick something to eat. As usual we ordered the avocado egg rolls as an spirited. They seem to have changed the recipe and it was a positive changed. We both agreed that it tasted better.  For entree I went with the spicy peanut  chicken soba noodles ( i know that's weird to order at BJs). It had just enough kick that made it tasteful. Everything came together to form a fantastic dish. My gf got the bison burger and she thought it was very tasty. Food is always very good for a chain restaurant. I was excited thinking I had a coupon for a free poozokie but sadly I did not.  If you are looking for some good food for the outlets then I highly recommend this spot. It is a little hidden but worth it if you are around the theme parks or outlets. Def better than a lot of other places around"
Steven C.,"West Dennis, MA",132,475,27,4.0,3/25/2017,"Dear Lord, I'm giving 4 stars to a chain.  Normally I wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this. Late dinner needed and staying within a healthy eating plan.  I chose the Peruvian quinoa with grilled shrimp.  First, it's really rice but I digress.  It was good.  Partially felt like a chain thing that came out of a bag but under 600 cals and the shrimp was nicely cooked (as opposed to overdone rubber).  The bill was just under 13 bucks and I gave Ben a big tip for being a solid server. Ya, I'm not going to chains and will be dead before an Applebees sees me.  Chomp on folks!"
Bob W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,6,1,1.0,1/1/2018,"So we show up to dine at 8 on Jan 1.  We order 6 meals.   2 are pizza.   Sliders, a steak,. Etc.    She comes back 15 minutes later and says we are out of pizza.     Also they have no buns.   What moron forgot to order supplies.  Bj is a pizza joint.  And service was slow."
Krystal J.,"Estero, FL",9,12,8,4.0,10/15/2017,"Food is very good like every other Bj. However service is slow, probably due to tourist area and the restaurant was very packed when we stopped by for dinner."
Dan Z.,"Brentwood, TN",111,110,149,4.0,8/3/2017,"The Good: Large selection of beer; good menu selection; nice environment. The Bad: nothing The Rest: Had wings; pizza; Calamari appetizer; cops, salsa and a home lager. Everything was great. The calamari was tender and very good; pizza was thin crust and yummy. I thought the beer would be week but it was very good with notable flavors. Wings were good. I recommend this place if you want great tavern food with good beer."
Jamie M.,"FL, FL",1,5,7,5.0,4/6/2017,"Stumbled upon this restaurant and found a real gem. I've eaten here numerous times in a week. We have had the bacon, chicken ranch wrap, the quinoa bowl with salmon, the fried shrimp and everything has been great. If you go, sit in Joanna's section. She's amazing and friendly.  The pazookies are EVERYTHING! My favorite is the cookies and cream. The salted caramel is a close second. The monkey bread one is good (kind of like a cinnamon roll. The triple chocolate is very savory.  Make sure you join the rewards club for a free pazookie."
Dana M.,"North Tonawanda, NY",62,133,587,3.0,12/27/2016,"It was okay. Calamari was rubbery, but well-seasoned; their beers were all lackluster, so we ended up ordering regular draft (good selection!); staff was friendly; Blackened Ahi Tuna was a tad overdone, and did NOT need to be fully coated in creole seasoning. Not a great meal for the price."
Renee W.,"Mableton, GA",148,256,113,4.0,10/30/2016,I fell in love with this place. There is a variety of food to choose from and it did not cost us an arm and a leg. We loved the crafted soft drinks and I tried the blond beer which was good. They also have great drink specials if you are into that thing. My favorite though is the Salted Caramel Pazookie omg so good. For our meals we ordered the flatbread and Thyme Chicken. The other time we went I had the ribs and hubs had the bison burger which were all very good. We also used the 10 dollars off 35 dollar coupon they have online which helped us enjoy more stuff. Will be back!
Wendi W.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,15,8,5.0,10/25/2017,"Absolutely wonderful server. He was helpful! As a family of five, he gave us tips on how to save $$! We ordered garlic knots and berry ciders to start. Both were delicious. Shrimp & Mahi -mahi tacos were to die for! I ordered both grilled and they were great with the smoky salsa & chips. Others ordered shrimp & asparagus pasta, chicken strips, brisket sandwich plate, and a burger. Everyone enjoyed their options. Dessert was a hit too. There was a special so we tried the cookie dessert (there is a cute name but I cannot remember it). White chocolate macadamia nut, chocolate chip, peanut butter and salted caramel. There are two sizes to chose from and macadamia nut was the favorite for our table."
Souk S.,"Oshawa, Canada",5,83,4,4.0,10/11/2017,"Huge menu and great service. I had the deep dish pizza, my wife kale salad and the kids had chicken fingers. That cookie dessert was also good. Great for families and large groups because everyone will find something on the menu."
Tanya B.,"Homestead, FL",35,44,25,5.0,4/8/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I took my daughter since she is with me for my business trip! She had the kid's mac and cheese and I had the salmon with quinoa and brown rice with veggies. It was ALL delicious!  This is my first time having the salmon and it was delicious. Our server, Josh, was awesome and attentive. I will always return to BJ's. Every time we visit, it's usually a great experience!  Oh, almost forgot. ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with the Monkey Bread Pazookie! My must have dessert!"
Kim R.,"Salem, MA",5,54,7,4.0,10/9/2017,"In an area filled with mediocre chain and fast food restaurants, this place is a gem. Great vegetarian options and the monkey bread is DELICIOUS. Highly recommend...especially in comparison to other nearby options. But avoid the mini deep dish pizza from the happy hour menu - tastes like microwave frozen pizza."
Chris R.,"Ballwin, MO",273,11,3,4.0,10/8/2017,"Beer was on point, Spicy Hawaiian pizza was amazing but I felt the fire aftermath the next day. Service was awesome specially for our big group (15)"
Jessica H.,"Orlando, FL",82,15,1,5.0,8/10/2017,"Service: excellent. Writing this because Elijah was wonderful and deserves to be recognized. Hopefully I spelled her name correctly, she was prompt and professional and helpful. When I return, I will ask to have her as my server."
Mark Y.,"Santa Barbara, CA",6,160,51,3.0,5/26/2017,Average food and decent beer. Considering the few customers (I was the only one at the bar) the staff could have been more attentive.
Lyndsey R.,"Orlando, FL",16,70,40,3.0,8/12/2017,"I've never really had an outstanding experience with this place. First off, when I walked in, the hostess didn't say anything to us and just looked at us walking towards her. Once I got to her, I said hello and I asked if we could have a table for x amount of people. I thought it was weird that I had to ask and she didn't. When we sat, the lady who gave us our menus kind of threw the further ones down as well as the silverware. The next thing that is kind of an annoyance is their menu. Their menu is a mini book. I believe places should not have so many options because it's hard to choose something to eat. Once we received our food, it wasn't all that hot. It was kind of lukewarm. We ran out of all of our drinks and I had to ask for refills. I noticed the table behind us had to ask for refills as well. Overall, the waitress wasn't bad but I felt like the overall experience and the food wasn't worth the money we spent."
Nathan K.,"Houston, TX",38,5,,1.0,12/4/2017,"A friend and I decided to get dinner here after a whole day of Disney. It was a Sunday evening and the place wasn't empty, but definitely sparse. We waited on a host to seat us because bar seating after walking all day was definitely not a first choice. Host was nowhere to be found and she eventually showed up 10-15 minutes later. We were seated at a table with a big puddle of water in the middle; she didn't seem to notice so we just mopped it up with napkins and wrote it off as inexperience. Then we waited on our waiter to show up. When he did, we waited another 10 minutes for water even though his section was empty, apart from us. When he did show up, he did manage to take orders effectively. The food came out within a reasonable time, but the steak was basically raw and the tomato soup had separated, leaving puddles of oil/grease interspersed throughout. It wouldn't even stay on the spoon (I should've known better than to have ordered soup at a restaurant). We had to flag the host (who was probably serving as well?) to find our waiter, but when he arrived he offered to exchange the food for something else. At that point I decided to cut my losses and just eat the mozzarella sticks for dinner and cancel the soup (which he did without question). They were ok, pre-frozen, but I expected nothing less. At this point, it's just a funny story, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't pay for another one. Ultimately, this restaurant is just poorly managed - diners beware."
Jason S.,"Willingboro, NJ",222,135,515,5.0,3/11/2016,"Found this gem through our hotel manager. We came in for lunch and a few beers. I'm glad we did. Jennifer M took care of us. She was very pleasant and well versed on the menu and beer selection. Great job. I opted for the endless soup and salad lunch special. Started with the chili and Caesar...chili was surprisingly excellent. Caesar was very good too. Round 2 I went with the chicken tortilla and the tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were extremely good. I was totally surprised by the quality of the food for a chain restaurant. Finished off the meal with the wedge and clam chowder. Both solid choices. The soups and salads here are all very good. Service was excellent. Beer selection was way better than expected as well. I had all house brews, but they have many more options. Irish Red was my favorite. Stop in and check them out! Solid job BJ's Brewhouse!"
Sharmain R.,"Altamonte Springs, Orlando, FL",42,73,286,5.0,9/7/2016,"If you're into desserts, definitely try the Pazookies.  They are to die for.  I love the Salted Caramel and Monkey Bread Pazookies.  And what makes this place perfect for dessert is that they offer mini sized portions so you don't feel so guilty.  Just perfect!"
Dani E.,"Pompano Beach, FL",24,25,18,5.0,8/29/2017,"Oh boy.... all the options you can ask for and the cookie.... that is one of the best desserts ever invented!  This particular location didn´t have the best service I´ve seen in al the BJ´s I´ve been to, but they´re ok."
Antony M.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,17,1,1.0,2/21/2017,"It took 45 minutes to make takeout chicken Alfredo. 2 morsels is all the chicken that came with this ""grilled chicken alfredo"". Pasta was under sauced and completely bland. I just threw it away, not even worth eating."
Misty W.,"Woodstock, GA",59,175,89,4.0,2/22/2017,"Get ready for an extensive menu of both beers and food. They offer specials each night that includes drinks and foods. We had the avocado egg rolls. They were not the best so I would skip them next time. Everything else was great including the guac burger, Bert salad, mahi tacos and club sandwich. It is definitely a place we would return to. If you hit it during one of the specials you can get a great deal."
Scott M.,"New Hope, PA",2,13,2,5.0,3/31/2017,"Was in town again this past week and stopped again for dinner at BJ's. Sat at the bar this time and once again had a great meal. I had the Ahi Tuna salad and the Beef Sliders, odd combination but that's what sounded good. Both were great and the fries were really good. Good to see a consistent experience year after year. See you next year!"
Stephen F.,"Apopka, FL",116,647,692,3.0,2/13/2016,"Second visit to a BJ's (the first one was in Coral Springs) and it was a huge improvement. Since it was lunch we didn't hit up the beer taps, sad face. Started with a few orders of the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, thumbs up, and then dove into the lunch specials. The Lemon Thyme Chicken was tasty and just the right size. Our waitress kept our glasses full and the bathrooms were spotless."
The Queen B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,43,61,4.0,7/28/2017,"We recently dined here. The food was great but the service was a nightmare. It took our food, nothing special, about 45 minutes to come. I recommend a burger or pizza, although I have had nothing bad tasting here. They seemed to be short staffed but it wasn't a wait when we arrived. The waitress was doing the best she could but I think it was more of a staffing or kitchen issue. We seen the manager on the floor but they didn't seem to be helping pick up the extra slack. The food is always great, we will try another location next time."
Ken P.,"Twinsburg, OH",0,71,5,2.0,1/26/2017,"PRO's: Went with a co-worker, sat at the bar. Friendly service, beer selection is huge and fresh. Highly recommend the house brand IPA.  CON's: food not very good. Co-worker ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Meatballs we're all Breading. I order Cajun dish-it was all processed meats.  Took 30 minutes to get desert. Think bartender forgot to put order in. It was busy, no harm. Just worth noting.  Give the place a C- for food, A for beers."
Julian R.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2017,Manager did not bother to even ask how many people because he was too lazy to tell the customers they did not have any servers for such a large restaurant.  I would not say it's bad service...it's no service.  Will never come to this place EVER!!! I can just imagine how bad the food and service must be once seated.
Jessica G.,"Lakeland, FL",48,53,13,1.0,7/25/2017,"Never had such an awful experience anywhere in my life.  Server was utterly clueless!!  As we finished our meal I figured someone would pick up the dirty plates and refill drinks before we ordered desert.  NOPE!  Dirty plates sat at our table for OVER an hour, server never ONCE refilled our drinks.  We received our deserts and still not one single plate lifted from the table.  I asked another server for the manager and he said that he would get him and never did.  It was an awful culinary experience that I will never DO AGAIN!!"
