John R.,"Ballwin, MO",0,15,,3.0,7/2/2014,Service was good.  Food was just ok.  The dipping sauce for the Avocado rolls was not good.  It was very sour and too much soy or hoisin sauce.  The Buffalo chicken pizza had BBQ sauce on it and too much ranch over the top.  Other pizzas were good.  Beer selection was excellent! I think they need to improve some of their menu items.
Steve R.,"Dacula, GA",43,30,11,2.0,6/22/2014,First visit to BJs tonight and was not impressed. Mostly with the service. We sat on patio and the entire night there was only one server for all the tables on our side. The kids meals came out first and we found out 30 minutes later it was because they screwed up my burger. So when it finally came it was not cooked properly and my wife's meal was cold. They didn't remake hers but let it sit while mine was being remade. Server wasn't forthcoming with this info until I asked why it was taking so long. By then the kids were restless and it was hard to enjoy it. The server offered no concession for this mistake. I think you can do better in this area.
Katie H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,14,1,1.0,5/2/2015,"Definitely one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. We were seated At a booth that was full of garbage underneath the table. My foot was wet as soon as I sat down. I had to  use a flash light to investigate why my foot was wet. When we asked to be moved to another table the hostess was not even phased by the fact that there was used napkins, oranges peels and garbage under the table. In fact, there was a party seated not long after we were relocated. The service was horrible. Took 25 minutes to even get alcoholic beverages brought to to our table. We asked for separate checked for a party if 4 and this took even longer. Keep in mind this was at 1030 at night. NEVER again will I come this this location. The location at Millenia is way better. Never again. There's no excuse for this lack of service."
Rob F.,"Billerica, MA",150,35,30,4.0,4/5/2014,"Really good. I used to frequent them when I was living in TX. I moved to Boston and I miss this place. The menu is like Cheesecake Factory with something for anyone. I'm in Orlando for business and brought the family and this place has been an awesome go-to. Great service. Lots of smiles and great food. I'm not into beer but their other drinks are ok. Great for families when you are looking to eat ""off the reservation"". Happy to hear they will be opening a franchise in Beantown in the near future. You were missed BJ. No matter where you are, you are Wicked Good!"
Vicki P.,"Orlando, FL",1,8,3,2.0,5/27/2014,"This was my second visit to BJ's, first time at this location. My first visit was great but this one left me not so happy. We were seated right away by a not so happy with his job host and waited longer than normal for our waiter to appear for our drink order. I ordered a margarita which was really sour. I should've sent it back. For dinner I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which was good but the mashed potatoes that came with it had a distinct instant mashed potato taste to them. Over I got the feeling that the waiter was paying attention to everyone else but us and he also did not ask if I was a member of their rewards program for which I did not earn my points for eating at their lovely establishment. I will return to BJ's, just not this location."
Delores G.,"Largo, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/28/2014,"I have Celiac Disease and must eat gluten free.  BJ's has become our go to restaurant because of their gluten free menu and the steps they go to to ensure the meal they serve is truly gluten free. Last night was anything but a safe, gluten free meal My husband and I both ordered gluten free to lessen any risk of cross contamination, even though I am the only one required to do so, talked in detail to the server to let her know I was extremely sensitive and would get sick quickly. We have eaten at many BJ's in many states with never an issue.  I had a side salad with bleu cheese dressing, House Sirloin Steak, Asparagus, Baked Potato with sour cream which had cheese in it......I questioned the server about the cheese and was assured it was gluten free. An hour after eating I had all the classic symptoms of being glutened, and almost 20 hours later, am still sick. I have never had the Sirloin steak, so maybe it truly isn't gluten free.  Maybe it was cross contamination.  I don't know and never will....but I will not be comfortable the next time I go to a BJ's.  Bad enough you get sick for several days and even worse when you think you paid someone to make you sick!"
Laurie G.,"Madison, OH",2,5,1,4.0,7/6/2014,Had a really enjoyable lunch on the patio of BJ's Brewhouse with my daughter. She was familiar with the chain. I had never heard of them but would love one in my hometown now!  Very extensive menu.
Dan V.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,9,,1.0,5/2/2015,"Don't know that the gluten free cheese pizza can really be referred to as food. Perhaps ""food-like"" is more appropriate. Might as well have been eating a pizza lunchable. Actually, I would have preferred the lunchable. I wouldn't feed it to a dog."
David M.,"Bradenton, FL",1,203,9,4.0,6/29/2014,"We went to BJ's for dinner and to watch the game. Things could not have been better. We got a great booth in front of the LARGE screen TV.  The server was always right on time with what ever we needed.  She gave us some recommendations, after we ask. We had boneless wings as a starter. They were just the right amount of heat and came with ranch.  I got a burger and fries, my wife had the Santa Fe Salad, our daughter had the Mahi-Mahi Tacos. Everything was very good and seasoned to our liking. This is a great place if you want to watch the game, have some drinks, appetizers, dinner or all of the above."
C L.,"Wrentham, MA",0,6,,5.0,4/24/2015,"Outstanding food, service, and prices.  Great drink selection, extensive menu-including lighter menu options.  A good break from Disney."
R.H L.,"St. Cloud, FL",0,4,,1.0,8/31/2014,"I came to the same BJs two days in the row, ordered the same thing both days. The drink I ordered was wrong four times. Really! The salad I ordered didn't taste like the one I had the day before. So have to say don't think I will be back. Service was the only part of my visit that was good. Maybe they need to focus on consistency now! Disappointed"
Larry G.,"Midlothian, IL",1,12,5,4.0,4/17/2015,"Good Beer Selection.(took a long time to get drinks) Lots of choices on the Menu,  Everyone enjoyed their order."
Julie M.,"St. Peters, MO",0,2,,5.0,7/26/2014,"Classy atmosphere but still very kid friendly. Good service, great food and great beer."
Jerry V.,"Mount Dora, FL",0,76,3,4.0,11/15/2013,"Had the Seared AHI Salad which was excellent and huge!  Service was good.  No complaints.  The menu is so large that it takes a while to make a choice, a little overwhelming."
Vince D.,"Stowe, VT",0,7,,4.0,6/24/2015,"This place takes you by surprise. The menu is incredibly extensive with plenty of options to chose from, including a large variety of lower calorie meals that were very tasty.  The beer selection is solid as well with their own brews meeting typical craft beer standards. The prices were reasonable and the service was excellent. I would eat here again."
B M.,"Orlando, FL",0,12,2,5.0,5/22/2015,"brief wait to be seated.  Our server was good, he had six tables. Handled them well.  The tables  in the bar area has plug ins to charge our phones. Food was great, delivered in good time. Something for everyone on the menu. Handles large parties. Highly recommend."
Jennifer T.,"Herndon, VA",0,6,,5.0,3/16/2015,First time customer. Hard to find a gluten free pizza that does not taste like cardboard. Finally found a fantastic pizza here. So good we ordered a second one. Bravo!!  My husband even ate it.  Thank you for making out trip so great!
Chad W.,"Watertown, WI",1,4,,5.0,12/11/2014,Had the best ribeye ever yesterday. Apps were good. My wife's Parmesan chicken was great. Beer was good. Prices were very fair. Would rate a step above Ruth Chris which is overpriced.
Michael D.,"Haverhill, MA",0,5,,4.0,12/10/2014,"My wife and I returned to BJ's to give it another try. This time our experience was a lot different. We were greeted at the door not only by a smiling and friendly hostess but by a man who I think may have been a manager. The wait staff were well coordinated and while they were busy, they still were able to cover their tables properly so that you didn't feel neglected in any way. We tried different dishes this time and were again happy with the food. We will be dining here again."
Chad L.,"Rochester, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/1/2014,"We had a group of 14 Deaf people.  We requested to sit together, there was no room and we were split into three tables as we sat separately.  There was one long row of table that we thought we could use but the manager claimed it was reserved for group of other people.  We dined and we left - this reserved table remain empty the entire time.  We felt we were being lied and that he did not want to allow us sit together.  We tried to have written communication with manager at two separate occasions but he does not understand what Deaf means - he kept on speaking toward our Deaf ears and thinking miracle we would hear him. This manager is so native and purely dumb!  The waiter came to us asking if we wish to order coffee and dessert, I asked for menu so I could see what they have but I received a check instead.  I was appalled by the service provided by this place and I will not go back there or any other place that bear the same name - BJ Brewery Restaurant again."
