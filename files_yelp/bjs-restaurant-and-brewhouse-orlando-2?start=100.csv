Jennifer W.,"Greensboro, NC",1,9,4,4.0,10/18/2014,Food selection is pretty good. A lot of different things on the menu.  Food was prepared nicely. Presentation was very nice also.  My friends enjoyed the beer selection and loved the pumpkin ale.  Server was WONDERFUL! I am pregnant and took an order to go and when I arrived home I opened my Togo order and the server had hand written me a sweet congratulations message. Definitely makes it worth visiting again.
Sarah M.,"South Salem, NY",3,30,5,4.0,7/18/2015,"Went to BJs at the recomendation of one of our traveling partners.  Friday night after a day at Disney.  Short wait, about 25 minutes so we went to the bar which was large with a great selection of beers.  Matt the bartender was very knowledgeable and helped us select flights that would match our tastes.   Dinner was fabulous and our waitress Chelsea was knowledgeable, friendly and helped us learn a lot about Disney Parks.  Very ample menu with plenty of choices for any pallet.  We had the brussel sprout appetizer and spinach artichoke dip and racks of ribs.  Food and service were great, very much what you would expect from a great brewpub. it was clean and had a nice atmosphere.  Definately would come back."
Kevin M.,"Gig Harbor, WA",2,23,23,5.0,7/14/2015,"After waiting 40 minutes for a cab at the Marriott, I gave up and walked next door to BJs.   The service was excellent and the food was great.  I really enjoyed the backed mushroom appetizers.  The Ahi salad was fantastic. The bar was clean and the huge TVs were great - perfect for the MLB home run competition."
Jimmy H.,"Chantilly, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2016,"Horrible front desk, was told we need to wait for 30 mins, after 30 mins, went to check and was rudely told that they are very busy, you can only keep waiting. Had to leave due to her horrible attitude!"
Rose L.,"Rutherford, NJ",187,247,458,3.0,4/25/2014,"We had a newbie waiter. She seemed eager, no issues there.  5 of us for dinner nj a 75% packed house waited 10 minutes to be seated walked past a couple of empty tables.  So newbie takes drink order and well disappears. Like kne was a lemonade and made me wonder if she was squeezing the lemons you know?   One beer and 4 reg drinks.  Ok out they come, order food.  Well tick tock tick tock tock tock  20 minutes later. ....  Vegetarian got her personal pizza.  Hubby got his burger I got my shrimp pasta Kid 1 got Mac n cheese Kid 2 got wrong avocado turkey burger and no side salad  Off it goes back to the kitchen.  Tick tock tock tock. Most everyone is done with meal and turkey burger shows up.  My shrimp pasta was lack luster. Shrimp had no flavor tasted frozen.  Was plain old ehhh Watch out for GPS sending you down the stree just so you can make a u turn. There's a left but GpS doesn't seem to know it."
Jack L.,"Crystal Lake, IL",11,156,27,3.0,3/14/2016,"Glorified bar fare, yes. Decent atmosphere, yes. Friendly service, yes. So what's the problem? It's glorified bar food. Serving size is gut busting but not exactly memorable."
Barry P.,"Winter Haven, FL",0,19,25,5.0,9/9/2015,"Great place to enjoy some of the best beer on draft. Food is always great. Been to the BJ's in Rancho Cucamonga, CA and Daytona. Always happy with service, food and the beer."
Kathleen L.,"Henderson, NV",0,2,,3.0,12/9/2016,At the BJ's Restaurants in Buena Vista FL off of Vineland Ave. came in with a 15-20 minute wait. It took 40 minutes. We had no silverware or napkins to eat the appetizer. They delivered the wrong wine and had no wine glasses so I had to wait for the correct wine and a wine glass. Service was mediocre at best. We live in Las Vegas where service is great.
Mark V.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,204,8,3.0,4/7/2015,"The food was average, the beer was good and the service was great. Very average lunch but our server was an excellent chap. The DIPA was good, for you beer nerds out there. The kids approved of the hand crafted root beer as well. We'd return."
Ilan H.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,5,2,1.0,1/18/2016,"Don't bother to make a reservation, it's a total waste of time. Made a reservation and when we got there had to wait in line with everyone else. Why bother to make one"
Anna R.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,13,4,2.0,3/13/2016,Most BJ'S are fantastic but this one drops the ball. The service is terrible and the food is lacking compared to their other locations. The beer is good.
David L.,"Memphis, TN",1,16,11,3.0,7/3/2015,"Service was a little slow. They seated us out side and may have forgotten bout us.  We had the flatbread pizza. They were mediocre. We tried the margarita , pepperoni and veggie.  Crust was more like a cracker. The  beer was good."
Alexandria E.,"Orlando, FL",115,20,40,5.0,3/1/2016,"The food was SO SO good!! I had a house crafted root beer, loved it!! My husband and I ordered Calamari for an appetizer and it was delicious! For lunch I had the buffalo grilled cheese from the lunch menu it was amazing. The fries were hot and crisp! Our server, Jennifer was phenomenal. She took great care of us! We haven't had great service like this in a while. We will definitely be coming back!!!!!"
David N.,"Rochester, MN",3,6,1,5.0,12/7/2015,"They do a great job!  That have an amazing choice of food, and are good for the calorie-conscious. Their home brewed light beer is delicious!  I was traveling on business, and enjoyed eating and drinking in the bar area. Very nice!"
Kathie D.,"Largo, FL",3,9,2,4.0,9/29/2015,"Tried the root beer ribs! Tasty, had a little kick to it! We love BJ's in Pinellas Park Florida!  This was the first time we ate at this particular BJ's...I ordered the Peach Margarita,  it did not taste that well. I picked up a powdered taste! It might of been a mix that didn't get blended. I passed on another alcoholic drink and went for the ice cold root beer in a frosted mug!  Hubby had the sliders, very good. Passed on dessert, we were full, lol. Service was good and i would recommend this BJ's in Orlando."
Charles H.,"Farmingdale, NY",0,1,,5.0,11/18/2016,Wow a great place! We're from Long Island ny I don't know which was better our waiter or waitress ( had to go back a second time) because it was so good!!! Get the flat bread nachos appetizer
Andrew S.,"Washington, DC",131,480,368,4.0,11/20/2014,"I've never had a bad meal here, and I like the fact they mix other beers on tap with their own home brews (though their beers are tasty and cheaper than the other crafts).  Good happy hour specials, piz-ookies that give sugar rushes, and their mobile app is a great way to order, dine, and pay if you're in a rush.  Highly recommend this place."
Brian F.,"Las Vegas, NV",254,61,1329,1.0,9/27/2015,"Stopped by this location to energize after some shopping and I must say that this is the most pathetic and mismanaged BJ's I've ever patronized. I waited at front for almost 8 minutes to be seated and the restaurant was empty with less than 12 people on the dining side. I finally took it upon myself to seat myself at which time I observe two employees walk back and forth by my table until I actually call one and ask for service. I then get passed onto another Server who I had put our order in with. Then we get passed on to Melvin who took control of the situation and provided us with exceptional customer service. Kudos to him in taking pride in his job and profession in the food industry. There is definitely a breakdown in management as what we clearly experienced is the failure of management at this location. The manager of this location definitely must be put through corporate training and realize that leadership is the problem at this location. As we left the establishment, I observed male and female employees so involved in personal conversation that they couldn't even thank us on the way out. Thank you Melvin for turning this negative experience around!"
Stephanie A.,"Orlando, FL",223,164,63,3.0,10/16/2014,"I normally get the shrimp scampi which is good!  I don't know what it is but BJs never really gives me the most wonderful food but it's not that it's bad either.  The pizookies are definitely worth going for and enjoying!  There are multiple flavors and all are good, but I definitely like the chocolate chip and the peanut butter :)"
Tracy A.,"Orlando, FL",37,9,,5.0,3/23/2016,The food was great. The staff was really friendly. My friend had an allergic reaction and they went above and beyond to ensure she was ok.
