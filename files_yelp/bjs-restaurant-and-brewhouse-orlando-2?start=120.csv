Danielle C.,"Mahopac, NY",3,18,12,1.0,11/5/2014,Just left BJs and the whole experience was eh. Our waiter was not friendly or informed and overall made it feel like we were bothering him. I ordered soup and salad the tomato soup was tasty was just extremely greasy. I saw the grease on the top of my Soup. Don't think I'll be heading back there
Brian G.,"Milford, VA",1,23,,4.0,5/12/2015,Really good menu and gluten free pizza.  Excellent service.  Nice atmosphere. Just what you would expect from an upscale microbrew.  I recommend the Amber.  Very good
Laurel G.,"Pullman, WA",7,36,75,2.0,11/1/2015,"This place wasn't terrible. The food was good and the pizookies are AMAZING. However my waiter disappeared after taking our order so when my sandwich that had basically three ingredients (cheese, green peppers, avocado) arrived sans avocado, I had to wave down someone else to remedy the situation. That's like ordering a BLT and having it show up without the B. It was good food, but I was pretty disappointed with that part of the service."
Deana L.,"Melbourne, FL",0,12,25,4.0,5/1/2015,Cold beer - great lunch ! Thanks to Andrew!!!! Awesome job taking care of us!ed the food and the beer!
Sarah B.,"Channahon, IL",0,9,,3.0,9/30/2015,The food was great! The waitress left alot to be desired though. Def worth a try!
Jack H.,"Gardnerville, NV",24,10,1,5.0,4/24/2015,"Came by last night for their late night happy hour (10 - midnight). It was fairly full in their bar area.  Great drink specials and food specials.  I have a cocktail and their pepperoni pizza which were delicious. It took a little longer than I expected to get my food but it was worth the wait.  The bartender, Yasminah, was amazing. A really cheery and nice lady.  I highly recommend this place."
Steve P.,"Cocoa Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,10/15/2015,The atmosphere was very bad. The French fries were about the only thing good here. The burger sliders tasted horrible. And what I mean by good is it taste like your generic french fries. I mean I would have liked it if the atmosphere didn't feel so country a chance if the food tasted better. To conclude this for you I would have to say that this was not was not very good it would be better if it wasn't so country generic and if the food actually had taste.
Catherine M.,"Miami, FL",0,8,6,5.0,3/22/2016,Raquel was AMAZING! The service she provided is unsurpassed. She made sure our food was perfect. She also made sure our glasses were always full. She was so attentive and knew her stuff. She was very knowledgable about the restaurant's menu and was great at recommending the best foods for us. We had such a good dinning experience. We plan to visit again soon!
Nancy M.,"Georgetown, Canada",1,42,4,5.0,1/4/2016,"Went here with 6 of us and all of our meals were excellent.  Root beer wings were amazing,  guacamole burger was the best my son has ever had (and he is a foodie).  Deep dish pizzas are super! Apps were good as well.  Try the grand gru beer- fabulous!   Service was great.  Would highly recommend."
Jeff S.,"Ellettsville, IN",2,1,,1.0,7/17/2015,"I hate to do this, but we really had a poor experience tonight. About the only thing that went right was we got seated outside per our request - it was far too cold to sit inside. Our waitress was either distracted or inept. She took out drink order and didn't get it exactly right. Then our food arrived and none of us had silverware or napkins. I got a pizza, but had no plate to eat it on. When she came back five minutes later, we asked for those items. It took her another 4-5 minutes to bring us silverware....meanwhile, my pizza is getting cold. My son ordered his burger medium and said it was completely dry from being overlooked. At this point, sending anything back would have prolonged the agony. Refilling water glasses was a real chore too. I seldom provide any reviews, but felt this needed to be said. I ignored the other poor reviews and now wish I hadn't. The weird thing is they weren't all that busy. As far as I could tell, our waitress had two tables - ours (party of three) and one other with a group of 8 or so. Needless to say, I would not return to this restaurant. I have eaten at other BJ's in Cali and had very good experiences. This one? No way..."
Zachary M.,"Clarksville, TN",0,16,,2.0,7/4/2016,"We went here for a late dinner - around 945 pm. The website said they were open until midnight, so we thought this would be a good option close to our hotel. When we arrived, the parking lot was not even close to full, so we assumed there would be no wait since the dinner rush would be over. Unfortunately, no one was managing the front desk when we walked in, so it took us almost ten minutes of standing around to find out that we had a 25 minute wait, despite the multitude of empty tables. (I understand that they were probably basing seating off of available servers and not available tables, but it's July 3rd and everyone has the next day off. It seems like that would be planned for.) after being seated, we waited long enough to see our server that one of my table mates started a timer. The timer made it to more than five minutes (plus the wait before starting the timer) before anyone arrived. By that point, we simply gave our waitress our order: unlimited chips and salsa to start, followed by two brisket burgers and a personal pizza with tomato, pineapple, and basil. The wait then began again. When we finally got our drinks, they quickly ran dry as our waitress continually walked past our table. When we did get our chips and salsa, all three drinks were dry and remained so for several minutes until our waitress shouted something about refills at us while walking past - not bothering to stop or to even look at us. When we finally did get those refills, it was only because our meals were done and our waitress was forced to do something with us. When we asked for the refill on the chips and salsa, she told us we didn't get that, but she could see about getting us more chips. She left before any argument could be made. I understand being busy, but our waitress was both busy and incompetent. Because we had spent enough time here at this point, we left money in the check and took off.  I would love to give this review one star, but I like to try to see the positive in reviews, and almost all of our problems were the result of one person. With that in mind, here goes nothing. Positives: 1) The burgers were very good - someone in the back has talent. I would have loved to try the wedge fries, but I didn't even realize they were an option and our waitress didn't ask.  2) The salsa was really quite good. Smoky and not blind nor overly spicy. I want to review a menu and see if it actually did come with free refills or if I was simply delusional. Negatives: 1) Our waitress, if that's not obvious. I wish I remembered her name and could put it here.  2) the pizza was, according to my table mate, lackluster. It had cilantro on it, not basil, and the cheese was not melted.  TL;DR: I hope I got a one-off, but I'm not convinced of that. Tons of potential, but probably not worth it until improvements are made. There are very similar places nearby that do the same thing."
Shelly F.,"Miami, FL",40,87,52,3.0,10/20/2014,Been here a hand full of times. Always have a good experience. my fav part is their beer. Had their pumpkin brew last time... I must say it was delicious.  Ill keep coming here. The menu is very vast and has lots of options.
Laura S.,"Tampa, FL",0,12,1,2.0,8/28/2015,Service was very poor. Our table was dirty and we had to clean it. Server took forever to greet us.. Asked him for napkins and he brought us PAPER TOWELS. We didn't feel welcomed at all. Won't be returning.
Angela M.,"East Village, San Diego, CA",9,5,,1.0,6/19/2015,"The beer was warm, ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the nacho chips were not crispi, very unpleasant. Seems like they don't care. I still love BJ'S, been to several in different states, and never had complained. It's the first time, honestly surprised. It's terrible."
Derek S.,"Davenport, FL",2,10,,5.0,1/14/2016,"Great food for the price! Better than manny of the tourist trap restaurants surrounding it. This restaurant is clean, classy and somewhere you would find anywhere. You get great food for a fair price!"
Philemon C.,"Owensboro, KY",0,26,44,5.0,11/12/2014,This BrewHouse is Amazing! The Selections (including Brews and Food) are exciting!! My family and I stopped here for a wonderful break from WDW. And we were not disappointed. A guarantee return!
Dolce A.,"Orlando, FL",0,29,14,5.0,1/6/2016,This location is the best!  Everyone is friendly and outgoing.  The management is awesome.  My favorite waitress here is named Natalie.  She is the best!!!  David is my favorite manager that works at this location!
Softballgirls N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",49,66,62,4.0,6/5/2015,"We are on vacation and chose this restaurant because it has so many food options.  Well,  my husband ordered an entree that arrived that didn't look like the picture.   We were dissatisfied.   Let me tell you that we were so impressed with how the server handled the situation.   She didn't get defensive and tell him it is his fault for looking at the wrong picture.  Instead,  she was extremely polite and apologetic and offered another meal in its place.   Even the manager came over to make sure we were happy and that we got the entree we wanted.   They handled the situation with class and made me want to write this so the public knows how well trained and considerate the staff is at this restaurant.   They didn't even charge for the new entree.   Much appreciated,  bj's.  We will definitely be back!"
Jesse V.,"Gulfport, MS",0,91,13,4.0,12/23/2015,BJs is better than a 3. The facility is awesome with lots of big TVs (5). There's lots of beer choices (5). The food is ok (3.5) and the service is ok (3.5). So I'd say a 4 is fair. The reason the service is not so good is probably because it's so big it's difficult for them to get around as well. Overall I like it because of the quality craft beers.
Ani T.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,109,29,5.0,8/16/2015,"This was the best restaurant I've attended during my trip in Orlando. My group and I came here twice, we ate in once and did take out the other time. We came around closing time, about 10-30 minutes to closing.(The 1st time we came here) Despite this, the waitress was amazing. She was very attentive and considerate. We had to order quickly, but she was still patient and nice. The food was outstanding. I ordered barbecue chicken pizza(1st time) and then the jalapeño turkey burger(2nd time). My group agreed that they have the best turkey burgers we ever tasted. The pizza was delicious; very soft and tasty. The atmosphere is very laid back and they have sports on the television. Even though we came here twice at night, the service + food remained awesome. 10/10 recommend."
