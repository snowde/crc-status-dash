Ken S.,"Harrison, NJ",2,33,10,4.0,3/30/2014,"New place for us to visit.  Never knew that they existed.  They have many different brews that looked very interesting.  Because I drove I had to make sure I didn't over imbibe.  Nice staff, atmosphere, and no wait (of course there was only two of us).  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone especially those interested in craft beers. Burger was cooked perfectly and had a really good taste."
Erica G.,"Overland Park, KS",1,18,3,1.0,11/13/2015,"Very poor service, the manager came out and was incredibly rude to us. The hostess was pleasant but wasn't getting across what she was trying to convey so the manager had to come out and she was sassing us beyond belief. Glad we decided to give our money to a different restaurant instead of a place that treats us like garbage. I would give it zero stars if I could."
Elizabeth W.,"Orlando, FL",39,69,16,3.0,7/25/2014,"I want to love BJ's, I really, really do and I've convinced myself that I love it and continue to go back but it really is just for the pazookies. They have a menu for all tastes but nothing I've ever ordered has tasted that great or stood out to me. They're supposed to be known for the brews and pizza but the pizza really isn't all that. The service is a hit or miss, the past few times I've been, it hasn't been great. However, they do have some of the best gluten-free pizzas I've ever tasted so bring your gluten-free friends there. But at the end of the day I would recommend just going for the house made sodas and the lovely pazookies (the salted caramel is my favorite)."
Courtney R.,"Charlestown, RI",2,6,,4.0,5/2/2015,"The outside and in were very clean and nice looking. Loved the look of the bar. The waitress was friendly and helpful. They had a gluten free menu, which was pretty small but tolerable. I got a salad and the tomato bisque soup, salad was extremely basic but the soup was great. Overall, I'd check it out again."
Janelle R.,"Orlando, FL",44,22,17,5.0,7/4/2014,"This is one of our go-to restaurants here in Orlando. From the food to the beer to the amazing desserts we haven't found a way to go wrong here yet! The avocado egg rolls are easily the best I've ever had--but be warned, they aren't for those who are wishy-washy about avocado. They cram a LOT of it in there, so it's perfect for an avocado lover. If you, like me, truly empathize with that lady in the Subway commercial who drives an avocado car then this is definitely the appetizer for you.  The pizzas are also wonderful- lots of options from crust to toppings, and they're great about making half and half orders for those of us who just can't make a decision.  They also have a huge range of great craft beers in a wide variety of styles. There are so many great options that a flight really is the way to go for a true connoisseur-- and don't be scared to make your own flight! They're happy to let you mix and match. Finally, I would be remiss not to mention the straight up happiness in a pan that is a pizookie. This incredible dessert is just baked still warm delicious cookie goodness topped with fantastic ice cream-- I'm typically not a girl who's big on desserts and I've genuinely considered ordering one of these before my meal. They have a wide variety of other menu options as well, definitely something to please everyone, and their prices are good, though not fantastic. I highly recommend giving BJ's a try next time you're out!"
Warren C.,"Austin, TX",1204,99,1077,1.0,6/17/2015,Interesting location -- piece of steak meat in my coffee cup (didn't even have entree yet) - flat bread which is typically great was thrown together and unevenly baked-- garlic Parmesan wings came out tossed in buffalo sauce and garlic parm (mistake they tried to cover up?) ordered shrimp Alfredo and shrimp tacos  - they are out of shrimp for every entree -- not sure what's going on here -- the BJ's back home in Houston Texas is great. Server was fast to correct mistake after mistake-- but... Really?
LeVar W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,3/7/2015,I called in to make a reservation for 11 last Saturday and was told reservations are not taken for parties of that size. Instead I was instructed to call in 15 minutes before arriving to be added to the call ahead wait list. When I called in to do so I was told that they only do call ahead for parties of 6 or less and that they would be unable to accommodate my group. The manager apologized for incorrect information being given to me but offered no solution for me. She did nothing to try to make it right and it wasn't until I continued to press that she even offered to TRY to split our group and get us in at 2 separate tables. I've enjoyed visits to different BJ's locations in the past so I was surprised at this unacceptable level of customer service. Our night could have been potentially ruined had it not been for another restaurant going the extra mile to squeeze us in and showing us that they do care about our business.
Mike P.,"Windermere, FL",0,3,,1.0,6/27/2016,"Horrible service. I'm a local, and I don't venture to the ""tourist"" side of town for this very reason-- these places expect tourists and don't care about good service or at the very least timely service. They are constantly understaffed, and use this an an excuse. I'm sorry that you're ""busy"" but waiting an hour to order is unacceptable."
Angela E.,"Alexandria, VA",113,222,495,2.0,2/4/2014,"I ordered food for a group of people in the middle of the week during lunchtime for take-out. It wasn't busy and there was no line to sit down or place an order. When I first called from a landline, the person that answered the phone couldn't here me on their end.  I thought something was wrong with my phone, so I called from my cell phone.  Again, they couldn't hear me, which was frustrating, so I had to go to the restaurant to place the order.  When I explained what happened, the order taker wasn't too fazed or apologetic.  Okay, not a big deal.   I placed an order for 2 different large pizzas and she said that it would only be about 20-25 minutes.  When I came back to pick up the pizzas, one was a large and the other was a personal size.  The lady and I went back and forth for about a minute because she thought that I said I wanted one of the pizzas to be personal sized.  This made me a little more frustrated because I had to wait for them to make the correct pizza.  About 10 minutes later, I picked up the correct pizza and she gave me the personal pizza, which we really didn't need, but it was still kind of her to do."
Michelle P.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,8,2.0,4/2/2015,"First time trying and not impressed.  No hostess and waited an awkward 5 + minutes for someone to greet us (even though other staff walked by and saw us and other parties waiting). The hostess took us to a mini booth (we don't like mini booths), but before we could say anything she was gone. We stood there waiting for the waitress and asked to sit at a bigger booth. Waitress was not attentive. We asked for a bud light. She said she didn't know if they had it in bottles. We said we didn't care if it was bottle or on tap. She can back and said they didn't have it on tap. UGH!  No pref, we told her. Bring us bottled. Food was not impressive. Ordered medium well steak, came really well done. Baked potato tasted like day old potato. Not impressed. Won't try it again."
Mary F.,"Chapel Hill, NC",26,1,,5.0,12/29/2015,"Great food; but that is not the only reason we highly recommend BJ's.    After an ordering misunderstanding BJ's Melissa went out of her way to make sure we were entirely satisfied with the outcome.  Thank you Melissa, we will be back."
Chris N.,"New York, NY",1,156,73,4.0,9/15/2015,"I thought this was a solid 4 star restaurant. Plenty of alcoholic mixed drinks and beers to choose from. A ton of meals, from burgers to pizzas. Great service and good prices. The dessert are absolutely amazing."
Karen C.,"Perry, GA",0,50,,4.0,11/14/2015,"Great service, in spite of experiences others have had. Server was very attentive and friendly. The food was tasty, but very greasy. My enlightened entree was swimming in oil."
Conner W.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",67,10,,4.0,6/23/2014,"Visiting Orlando from south FL and I was happy with my experience here, the pizza was above average and the BB&Q burger was very good as well (just get extra sauce).  The service was good, and I never felt like I needed to hunt down my server.   -Overall I'd recommend stopping by if you're nearby."
A.k.a. Geek Girl T.,"Arlington, VA",46,40,9,3.0,6/16/2015,"We went to the Lake Buena Vista location on a week night with a group of 10 and sat outdoors. The crowd was relatively low. The food came out in spurts, so some were finished before others got their meals. I realize that it's sometimes hard to deal with larger groups, but the serving pattern for us was a bit excessive.  I think in general, people in our group were okay with their food but certainly not wowed. My son and I were, however, very pleased with ours. The gluten free crust was thin and crispy and held up well. The sauce was a bit too sweet for us -- we like bold spices.  None the less, it was a real treat since few places have it and those that do typically don't do it well."
Loren R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,15,6,5.0,3/9/2015,"The bartender Yesmina was amazing!  Very hospitable, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Great end to an evening."
Jade C.,"Belleair Beach, FL",7,7,2,5.0,8/11/2014,Absolutely wonderful. Nancy at the bar is so friendly and helpful. The food and beer were excellent. GREAT experience.
Tara G.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",70,166,15,2.0,12/17/2013,"I really hate to give BJ's just two stars because I've been here twice and both times the food was great. They have a decent beer selection as well, though some of their in-house brews leave something to be desired. My first time here was at the end of October and everything was great - the food and the friendly, timely service. Unfortunately, when I returned again several days ago there were several issues. There were five of us at our table - one of my friends never got the salad he ordered, or the extra sauce he asked for with his meal (despite asking for it twice). Also, four of us received our food while the fifth person waited a good ten minutes for his burger - and had to ask for it at least twice as well before it ever arrived (in fact, he may have asked for it three times). Getting the checks was another debacle - to say it took forever would be an understatement. The worst part was, some other friends had arrived while I was there, and when I went to sit with them for a beer that was another mess in terms of waiting for drinks and then checks. I do hope that this restaurant gets itself together, because clearly it showed promise in the beginning, but they definitely need to figure out what's going on in terms of their waitstaff."
Diann S.,"Camp Hill, PA",0,2,,1.0,10/10/2015,"Nice atmosphere. Food was disappointing. Gourmet Mac n cheese was not! Noodles, butter and topping, minus the creamy cheese sauce. Waitress said it was not right and ordered another. Next one was same with melted cheese. Far from "" gourmet"". Deep dish bacon chicken ranch pizza was ranch flavor-less. Pizookie sampler  took for ever to bring out. 2 cookies were burnt! Mac n cheese removed from bill and then re added at bottom of check. Off night? I wonder but will not retry :("
Phil E.,"Newark, NJ",6,83,,4.0,4/19/2015,Nice sports bar with their own craft beers. Good food at great prices. TV's need to be better adjusted. The one we had the aspect ratio was off and they couldn't fix it. Still nice outside dining and a good time!!
