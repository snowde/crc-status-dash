Matt M.,"Coral Springs, FL",167,13,3,5.0,10/3/2015,"Had dinner last night with a group of 7. We were greeted promptly and quickly seated. Service was EXCELLENT! Ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it was cooked perfectly! Finished dinner with a cup of coffee, and am looking forward to checking another BJ's closer to my house in South Florida!"
Gjuana W.,"Orlando, FL",27,26,15,4.0,12/6/2013,"We actually just came for drinks. The place is gorgeous inside though and the bar had plenty of different flavors of top choice liquors to choose from. I just stayed Plain Jane and got a rum and orange during the happy hour which Bacardi drinks are $3 from 12-7 I believe! The drink was pretty strong the first time with the first bartender I had but when ordering a second it was ""Death by Bacardi"" from another one. That's no big deal because I'll just make sure I will request a different bartender next time...  We heard too that there was a happy hour for the appetizers too so we decided to order the Spinach and Artichoke dip.....AMAZING! Kanye couldn't have said it better.... it was so warm and had a lightly crisp top! Wish I thought to take a picture but the ""Death by Bacardi"" had my mind elsewhere. I'll be back."
Luis V.,"La Verne, CA",1,6,,3.0,5/2/2014,"We have eaten at several BJ's over the years and have always enjoyed the food. This location left a little to be desired in the service department. Easily the longest we've waited to order, get our food, and get refills on drinks. I'll give the waitress a mulligan on this one as the slow service was likely due to her having too large a station to cover (so it seemed to us at least). I would be willing to chalk it up to an off night, but since it was our first (and most likely only) visit to this location, I couldn't say for sure. Other than how long it took, our waitress was friendly, got the orders right, and was more than willing to answer my son's questions about the food he was considering. The food was on par with what we've come to expect. The buffalo wings are always incredible and the pizza (Large Deep Dish of BJ's Favorite) was delicious. The burger, according to my son, was very good as well."
Julie P.,"Newport, NC",0,9,,2.0,6/30/2015,"Food is excellent and service is usually impeccable. However, Jill J. was the worst server we encountered while in  Orlando. Be sure to ask for anyone other than her if you want good service. None of the male servers have disappointed in the past."
Michelle M.,"Bergen County, NJ",577,679,44,4.0,10/13/2014,"We went for dinner and wound up watching the games from the tvs all around. This is the perfect place to watch a game and have a drink and some appetizers. I actually don't recall exactly what we got, but we both really enjoyed the food and service. You may want to make a reservation - the place was packed! It's loud, so I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate date."
Rosa Haruko A.,"Doral, FL",319,97,115,4.0,2/23/2014,"This is my second time at a BJ's restaurant. My first experience at a BJ's in Miami was horrible but I decided to give it another try since we are in a different city. The server was very charismatic and attentive. He made conversation with us and gave us good drink suggestions. I had the balsamic chicken which was flavorful and filling. My boyfriend had the rack of baby back ribs which was huge. The ribs were tender and had the right about of sauce, not too much or too little. We ended our meal with a chocolate chunk pisookie which was delicious. I will be returning to my local BJ's in Miami and hopefully they have improved there service."
Regina L.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",3,12,,5.0,7/29/2015,"Great atmosphere with great food.  This was our first time at this particular restaurant and we really enjoyed it.  The staff was friendly and attentive. The house made beers were good as was the food.  We sampled five different beers before deciding on the one we liked most. We had the burger with fries and the ravioli.  I must say the portion sizes were great and the price was what you expect it to be in this tourist town. Of course we had to try their signature dessert the pizookies.  We had the sampler where they allow you to pick three small ones. Don't worry though, this is more than enough to share.  We had the peanut butter and jelly,the salty caramel and the white chocolate macadamia. I will definitely visit one of their other locations whenever I'm close to one."
Adrie D.,"Orlando, FL",58,135,333,5.0,1/14/2014,"BJ's never disappoints me! We went there for a family dinner. We were quoted 20 min wait but after only ten minutes they called our party. It's the first time I come to this location since I moved here and the appearance of the restaurant is just like any other BJ'S. They have a very clear standard for all their restaurants and franchises. What made this experience different was The Server!!!! She was the nicest girl ever, even with my picky sister who takes her damn time to make up her mind and changes it every two seconds.  Needless to say, she didn't like the first plate she got (which I tried and was really good) but the server replaced it for something different no questions asked. We had a really great experience and the waitress was on top of our drinks for refills and constantly checking up on us AND IT WAS BUSY!  The only difference I found with other locations is that the teriyaki chicken was a little bit more spicy. Other than that everything tasted great, and we had from appetizers to desserts!! I really recommend this location!"
Andrew B.,"Naples, FL",31,4,4,5.0,5/17/2014,"Huge selection of great beer! The food was good along with the service. We even ordered take from BJs online and picked it up, it was just as good."
Michele J.,"Somerville, MA",15,38,41,4.0,1/13/2014,"We went here for dinner on our Orlando vacation at 9:50pm when most restaurants in the immediate area were closed. Seeing an empty interior and three stars on yelp, we weren't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised with everything. The food was flavorful, the menu was extensive (something for everyone) and the service was great (especially our server; didn't quite catch her name). What we tried: deep dish buffalo pizza, Moroccan salmon, corn fritters. They had run out of 6 in. deep dish crusts so they gave us the next size up for the same price. The corn fritters were tasty and the salmon came with well seasoned vegetables and cous cous. The latter dishes were on the slightly smaller side side but the pizza made up for it.  Note: Not too long after we got in several other tables filled up. Must have been hungry people like us who didn't want to travel to Downtown Disney."
C S.,"Southfield, MI",0,61,6,4.0,9/26/2015,"While traveling with my family, we stopped here in hopes of eating at a non-chain restaurant which seems hard in touristy Orlando. Turns out this is a chain but it didn't disappoint. Our server was great and the food was well priced and quite tasty. If your other choices are Friday's or other types of restaurants, I'd choose BJ's."
Beth S.,"Raynham, MA",71,36,4,5.0,12/21/2013,"We were visiting Orlando from boston. Headed to the outlets last night and wanted to grab a bite to eat first. We figured we'd try this place because there aren't any In boston. Super glad we did! Our server was awesome, I want to say her name was Amanda but  I'm not sure. We sat outside, they have these cool bar top tables with mini fireplaces in each. The ""2 for $35"" is an amazing deal. The rib eye melted in my mouth. Make sure you save room for dessert, it's fantastic!"
Dana G.,"Hamilton, Canada",1,138,4,1.0,10/30/2014,"I normally love BJ's Brewhouse but this experience was horrible! Our service was so disappointing.  Seconds after being seated our server storms up and says ""wine?"" we told her we hadn't had a chance to look and she seemed annoyed.  We asked for water to start-that took ten minutes to arrive.  We did order a bottle of wine and it came out to the table opened no opened at table not taste test.  I know BJ's isn't fancy but this is wine etiquette and it came with no chiller just thrown on table. We had no water refills my husband actually just grabbed the jug to do it himself.  Was so disappointed have never written a bad review but wanted to let people know if you had been to another BJ's and were expecting good service this might not be the place for you."
Candace W.,"Columbus, OH",2,8,1,3.0,1/28/2015,"We went during happy hour, which is more like half-y hour. They advertise half price apps which are half price but literally half portions. I.e. Appetizer wings reg $9.95 for 10 wings- HH $4 for five wings. They were not great, just soso. Chewy, not crispy and very stringy. Pizza was good though and not a bad value. HH personal with unlimited toppings for $6. I had starter salad which was ok- spinach, bacon and blue cheese. Fairly small portion for $4.95. Waiter was nice but took forever. He seemed to be smoozing the next table over for tips, thus little time for us. Food runners brought all our food and drink while he chatted it up. Oh well. Won't go back but not awful."
Ashley C.,"Utica, MI",0,52,18,4.0,3/30/2015,"Came here during a slow time, around 3pm.  Food was great and customer service was even better.  Our server offered us some samples of the beer since we did not know what beer we wanted to order.  I had forgot to ask for some toppings on the side for my nachos, so when they came I mentioned that I forgot and the waiter insisted on having it remade to my liking.  Usually when it is the customers fault, they don't go out of their way to fix something like this.  Very impressed.  We would re-visit!"
Renee S.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,13,17,5.0,12/22/2014,Excellent atmosphere. Very Art Deco and clean. Wait staff is very friendly and food was tasty!!
Jennifer H.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,,5.0,3/9/2015,Yesmina was terrific in the bar and our server Matthew on the patio was really friendly and took great care of us. Would definitely recommend!
Janet S.,"Aurora, CO",1,3,,2.0,2/26/2015,Not up to par with normal BJs at other locations. Service not the greatest and restaurant abnormally loud
Jeff C.,"Des Moines, IA",1,99,,5.0,2/26/2015,"This was a great place. Really diverse menu options and great, friendly service. Nice outdoor seating area. Reasonable prices."
Ryan S.,"Ankeny, IA",0,11,,3.0,2/24/2015,"Looks like a really nice place. I've now been waiting 20 minutes for a draw of beer that I ordered after waiting for 15 minutes. Nothing fancy, just a glass of beer. I would love to leave something about the food but I'm afraid I may die before it gets to me. Actually the food was good, but the service was really, really slow. So if you want to hang out in a nice little place maybe it's a five star for you."
