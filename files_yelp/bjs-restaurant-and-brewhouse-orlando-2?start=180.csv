Anna T.,"Hollywood, FL",15,40,6,4.0,10/28/2014,Loved the food went with my husband on our Halloween Horror Nights vacation and decided to eat here because it was right in front of out Wyndham hotel. The food was very tasty and flavorful we sat at the bar because of a time crunch but still enjoyed our company with each other and the bartenders. The drinks where yummy as well. Unfortunately they don't not have angry orchard which is a personal favorite. We paid a total of $95 a little pricey but still worth it. Hopefully they have a location near me
M T.,"Tampa, FL",0,12,,1.0,6/21/2015,"CLOSE THIS RESTAURANT and start over with capable and competent staff. We visited last Saturday for dinner that turned into a 2.5 hour fiasco that began with a seating host that was expressing his frustration to all who entered. We had to speak up to even get seated as the ""printer was broken"" for the seating assignments and he began to seat those who complained the loudest. He completely lost control of the queue of customers. Once seated all started off well but after we got our appetizers our waitress changed sections and we were left to handle everything ourselves. She was less than helpful when I went and found her stating ""someone will be over to help you I have tables all over"". From having to go to the bar to get our drinks on our own and having to go to the kitchen door to ask about our food. Not once was our table serviced, no offer to refresh beverages (we had teen kids with us), appetizers plates were left on the table even after we went and got our entrees. The food was notably stale, that being, had been sitting under heat lamps for 15-20 minutes as the burger breads were dry, stale on the tops, fries were room temperature and steak blood had dried on the plate.  Seriously, whomever the owners are of this enterprise, you have issues at this site. So much went wrong, we truly could not believe what was happening again and again."
Angela M.,"Orlando, FL",3,31,43,4.0,11/30/2014,"The food is magnificent! To start off, you can choose to share a regular sized appetizer or get a personal one. I got the spinach stuffed mushroom and they were amazing! My boyfriend got the bruschetta at it was decent. I had a simple chicken tortilla soup and they pour the broth at the table so the chips are fresh and crunchy. It was the perfect amount of spice and the flavor was totally balanced! My boyfriend got a BJS Burger with bacon and cheese and it was seriously one of the best burgers I've eaten! They have this sparkling raspberry lemonade which is also delicious! Service was alright. Never got his name and my boyfriends drink, the Orange soda, never made it to the table. Came by for Refills on water just once. Other than the ok service, I will certainly make a second trip!"
Adrianne P.,"Orlando, FL",94,21,3,3.0,11/30/2014,"The best thing about this place is the beer menu. Their beer list is almost as long as their food menu. I would recommend trying their beer tasting. Four 5 oz. samples for $6.95 - you can't beat that deal. The aforementioned long menu has everything for all types of food lovers. Though it isn't gourmet style food, it is definitely above the average chain restaurant menu."
Joanie D.,"Lakeland, FL",3,4,,1.0,1/31/2015,"We gave this place a 2nd chance last night and it's now on our ""will not return"" list. The service is terrible, it was the first time also, but that time a manager came over and compted our drinks and apologized cause they were so busy, the dinners we ordered were good though, that we tried it again... Nope same thing and our server Pierre was not knowledgeable about the menu or didn't have any recommendations for us, so we didn't feel like we were anywhere special. We are very busy with work during the week and Friday night is 'date night' for us and this was a waste of our time and money. I'll let the tourists spend their money here."
Brianna J.,"Akron, NY",0,8,,5.0,8/20/2014,probably the best restaurant I've ever been to in awhile. Food was awesome and so fresh and not pricey at all. Atmosphere was great as well and employees were very friendly
James I.,"West Palm Beach, FL",46,67,3,4.0,7/14/2014,"We had a very nice meal here this past Friday evening. It was 9pm and while every other place in the area was mobbed, this newer BJ's didn't have a wait, so we decided to give it a shot. The food was perfect and the service was great. I wish I remembered the name of our waitress because she did an awesome job taking care of us. We'll"
J F.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,1,1.0,7/15/2014,"Walked out after I got tired of waiting for the wait staff to wait on me.  After being seated,  waited more than 15 minutes and was never acknowledged by any wait staff.  They weren't even busy.  Obvious reflection on the restaurant management and lack of customer service."
Jake L.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/8/2014,"On any given day I would say BJ's is a great chain restaurant with reliably satisfying food. I'm writing about this BJ's because I was seated and then waited 30 minutes for someone to come talk to my table. No one came, so my party and I left. This location needs to get it together."
Sher H.,"Columbus, OH",0,45,,3.0,11/3/2015,"We like BJ's Brewhouse a lot, but this was not our favorite one to go to. The servers all seemed stressed out and it was not a busy night. My boyfriend got a burger with fries - the fries were pretty soggy and his burger was very dry so he had to load it up with ketchup. I got the caprese salad and the meal portion was much smaller than at other locations. However, the happy hour wine deal was good and I was excited to learn you can order just 1 mini pizookie instead of 3."
John A.,"Fort Pierce, FL",27,27,8,2.0,6/18/2014,"Horrible, party of 18 at about 8:30 and told 35 minute wait. Great you would think but not so. About the 40 minute mark we are approached by hostess who asks would we be willing to sit on their covered patio that has fans and we should be comfortable. Yes, yes that sounds great. WRONG!! It was muggy the TWO ceiling fans didn't do anything as far as creating an airflow. So now the food everyone seemed to enjoy their food . I ordered the prime rib au jus , the flavor not bad except the sandwich was more bread then meat and the bread was like a six inch sub . Wife ordered guacamole egg rolls that were good but came out after our entire party was done eating and half were leaving. They comped her plate real surprise there."
Lisa W.,"Sarasota, FL",0,10,,1.0,12/31/2014,Despite the service I have had at the international location this Fall- this location sucks! Don't be fooled tourists- my family came in on our way to NYE w friends at 3 pm for a late lunch- my son and I are gluten free (he has a few other allergies) so we were glad to see the extensive menu that signifies what was safe- we spoke w the manager and our waiter who all assured us no issue (this is what we normally do to eat safely)- well obviously the kitchen does have issues here! My son's order was botched and came out not as requested- which could have killed him- my GF pizza tasted half freezer burned (it is horrible) and then they remade his meal and he was left waiting while we all waited- this is horrible as he is 12- obviously I shared my tasteless pizza but he was upset and worried his recooked meal would be wrong too. This was very upsetting as when a restaurant says they can accommodate- which many do extremely well today- it is life threatening when they do not fulfil what they state. Obviously we will just go to Bahama Breeze Or Landry's Seafood next time as they have never disappointed.
Tim H.,"Daytona Beach, FL",6,8,,3.0,12/26/2014,Did everyone like their food what's up in a cold salad and won't really super called kids venue was great wife actually like the kids spaghetti I had the the platter for lunch and latter a good barbecue sauce asked for the Chris wedge cuts Kim crispy and I think you'll enjoy it
Stephen G.,"Knoxville, TN",2,1,,4.0,3/1/2015,"The atmosphere was nice. There was a wide selection of food, drinks, and deserts. There was a page of the menu dedicated to healthy foods. They had a nice beer selection. I was there with 5 people and every one said their meal was great and they would come back."
Megan C.,"Metairie, LA",10,75,2,4.0,7/25/2014,Would only go for pizookies...they're the only worthwhile menu item. Deliciously unique! Service is always just ok.
Kelly O.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",1,7,8,5.0,11/24/2015,"Wonderful service and amazing food! Maybe they had a change in staff or something, but everyone we encountered was very sweet and helpful. Great drinks, great food, and the pizookie is to die for :)"
Mark E.,"Pearl District, Portland, OR",0,13,,3.0,4/30/2015,"First time going to this place, was looking for something outside of my resort. Was impressed by the outside and inside of the restaurant. But that's all that impressed me. I had a very nice waiter, but he was slow and and forgetful. Ordered a salad as an app, the food runners brought it out and I had no silverware to eat it with, I didn't receive any until my waiter came and checked on me. Very good cob salad!! I ordered a 8"" deep dish pizza for my entree, again the food runners brought it out, and just he pizza; no plate to eat off of. Now they serve their pizzas in the pan, so it seemed awkward to eat out of the pan. I waited for my waiter to come back so I could ask him for a plate. The pizza it's self was not good. I ordered a regular cheese pizza with a couple of toppings, the pizza was lukewarm, and not from sitting while I was waiting for my plate. It was close to being cold, and the cheese was chewy. My waiter did not check on me again after that until he brought my check. I would not recommend this restaurant for good fresh pizza. It looks nice, but that is about it."
Gloria A.,"Fullerton, CA",638,8,7,4.0,3/26/2014,"We were a party of 2 that were seated immediately around 8PM. We were greeted right at the door and our server was pretty nice and helpful with helping us choose our food. We shared the sliders appetizer (4 little mini burgers) and I ordered a chicken entree. For dessert, we ordered pazookies of course! All of the food was delicious and we will definitely be coming back again! I rated them a four out of five stars because while I was happy with our food and service, I see room for improvement: my water was not refilled right away, my food was served incompletely without the chardonnay butter sauce, the server forgot that my friend wanted ketchup and ranch, and our server could have been a little bit nicer. Overall, a great night and a great experience and like I said, we will be returning soon!"
Nanor H.,"Montebello, CA",141,41,14,1.0,3/11/2015,"""Welcome to BJ's"" this is how you are greeted when you come into our welcoming, caring, dependable restaurants....  Ya Right!!!! This place can't even deliver on the first line of their advertisement!  on our way home after a long shopping trip and saw BJ's on the way home, I have been to many BJ's back home in LA and wanted him to try it too, it was about 11:50 so I looked inside and saw a full bar and some tables occupied so I figured they were still open. I have been in the restaurant industry for a long time and if I knew they closed at midnight I wouldn't even have walked in since I didn't want to be ""those people"" that come in right before closing and stay forever. So when we walked in the hostess looked up at us and I was going to ask if they were still open, but before I could even say a word a male manager said ""you guys need to order fast because we are closed"". I was shocked I didn't want to eat at such an inhospitable place so we got the hell out of there. Point is if your management is so rude what can be said about your servers? I will never go back to this BJ's  again."
Brian S.,"Venice, FL",0,22,1,5.0,9/15/2014,Service was very good.  Kyle was our waiter.   The salmon was awesome and the burgers were huge!  Tried the Gluten Free pizza - nothing special.
