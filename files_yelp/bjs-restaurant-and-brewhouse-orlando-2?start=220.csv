Kathy W.,"Osprey, FL",0,10,,1.0,10/5/2014,"Horrible place to go to watch football!!!  We went to BJ's on a Sunday to specifically watch our team since we were visiting from out of town. We asked the hostess for a seat close to a tv that was showing our team and she showed us the tv that was showing our game. We sat and ordered drinks and appetizers and shortly after ordering, the tv was switched to another game. We requested to have the tv switched back to our game, pointing out that we had already been there watching it but the server and management was unwilling to help. There was another group who had just come in to watch the same game we were watching and they were turned down as well to have the game shown. This group said they had even called ahead of time to make sure they would be able to watch the game and they were assured that it wouldn't be a problem. This made no sense because the place wasn't even that busy and there were plenty of tv's. We ended up paying our bill for food that we didn't even eat and leaving to go elsewhere, as did the other group. We are frequent visitors to Orlando and will NEVER go back to BJ's, even if we are not seeking to watch football. Their treatment of the situation was unprofessional and there was no effort on their part to rectify the situation or even offer to take the food off our bill that went uneaten."
Jenn C.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,3,,5.0,7/14/2014,"Great experience. We took an unexpected turn into the parking lot and thought we would try our luck. Service was great and food was very good! Fries came out cold, but they immediately replaced them with new ones!  Great dinner! Highly recommended trying it out!"
Darlene K.,"Barrington, IL",0,30,1,4.0,3/24/2014,"Just tried BJs in Orlando. Great atmosphere, fun and lively with a great outdoor deck which has lots of seating capacity. Really like the reduced calorie menu, so many options. I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had the mahi mahi. Fresh and flavorful! Will go back."
Jaclyn G.,"Cicero, NY",0,24,3,4.0,4/28/2014,Nice upscale sports bar. We brought three kids and it was great.  The food was above average. Our server was friendly and outgoing.  I would definitely go back. Prices were very reasonable.
scott j.,"Tempe, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2014,"This was my worst restaurant experience as far as I can remember. First we pull up to the place and were excited as I haven't been since I lived in AZ where they had one . Our experience starts with some crackhead looking into the windows of all the cars in the parking lot which we alerted the hostess who seemed concerned however did nothing to make sure that issue didn't escalate . Next issue is with the restaurant being about 25% full and them making us wait 15 minutes to be seated (which was concerning.) We finally get seated and another 20 minutes goes by before we get a waiter to stop at our table . We tell him we have to leave in an HOUR to make sure we catch a flight, the waiter apologized and assured us we would be fine. Just to be safe we ordered food and drinks at the same time. About 15 minutes goes by and we finally get our drinks, another 15 minutes goes by and we begin getting anxious for our 2 hamburgers and 2 pasta dishes. We start complaining amongst our table and overhear 2 tables around us having similar issues and it comes up they too have been waiting over 45 minutes. All of our waiters finally come out and say that the food will be out in ""1 minute "" however opposed to waiting for the food they decide to walk to the table and tell us and then go outside and start basically procrastinating. They come back to the table (foodless) and we ask for the manager which our waiter came back with okay but the food will be right out... Another 3 minutes goes by, we don't get a manager and we don't get any food. At that point we were there for 70 minutes so we all decide to just get up and leave . End of the rant but as long as that incompetent staff is there I will NEVER go back.  Hope this helps -Scott"
Annette P.,"Brookville, IN",0,14,,2.0,12/22/2013,Appetizer was great......beer average......But the biggest turn off was a customer with a dog (not a service dog) let into the restaurant and the kitchen and wait staff (ours included) can out to pet the dog before and after serving food......would have ate dinner there but got grossed out.....no manager in site the enforce obvious heath code infraction. ....By the way this place was only open a few months when we visited.
Shl J.,"Norwalk, CT",0,36,,4.0,12/26/2013,"My buddy and I are staying at the Marriott Village next to BJ's.  After we battled our way through traffic back into the village (because this is the day after Christmas and everyone is heading to the outlets on the same road), we stumbled into BJ's for lunch.  We sat by the bar because the giant TV was showing Manchester City vs. Liverpool.  I was very impressed with the atmosphere inside.  I can totally see it being great at night.  You can even see outside.  We were greeted by one waitress who knowledgeably rattled off some beer recommendations for my friend (I don't drink).  We were passed onto a 2nd waitress (Yasmine) who took our orders.  When I looked at the lunch specials, I was impressed the prices were reasonable.  I ended up ordering an appetizer (corn fritters with bacon aioli), a lunch portion of grilled chicken pasta with tuscan tomato soup (delicious), and a mug of vanilla cream soda (then later a mug of orange cream soda too).  We were well taken care of by Yasmine.  At that time of day, it wasn't too busy so we were basically there for two hours watching the entire game.  All in all, a really relaxing atmosphere on a lazy afternoon.  Patrons came in and out and enjoyed themselves.  I just checked that I can order online too ... so I'm pretty sure I'll be doing that at some point this week."
