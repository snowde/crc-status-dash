C K.,"Irvine, CA",3,20,24,2.0,8/8/2017,"Sad that Bj's has become this. Ordered seven dinners, one of them being spaghetti with meatballs. I have never had spicy spaghetti in my life. It was so spicy that we could not take more then a few bites. What's worse are the meatballs! As you can see from pictures the meatballs were burnt and hard as rock.  I miss the old Bj's menu. Only thing positive is the pazookies they are still delicious."
Holly C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,16,1,2.0,6/11/2017,We r die hard BJs fans and always visit this one when in Orlando. We came on a Monday night and waited at least a half an hour to be seated... and another 15 minutes to order. This would be reasonable except for the fact there were many empty tables. They are obviously not concerned with staffing. So  even this situation is not unforgivable but the bathrooms were DISGUSTING!  Paper towels all over the floor stopped up toilets empty toilet paper rolls and sanitary napkins on the floor. UGH! If this is the way they maintain the areas where the customers see I can only imagine the kitchen!
Giovanni V.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,2.0,11/9/2017,The food was not what I expected. There is a reason why I've always been hesitant to go to BJ's Restaurant but I finally came to the decision that I won't be coming back the service was great the waiter was amazing he even remembered to refill my cup of water with no ice usually other waiters forget that I may be nitpicking but I take that very personally he obviously cared for the customers. As for the food we went on a Monday for the people who don't know they have a special buy a pizza and get half off so the whole family thinks what a great deal so we all ordered pizza as we ate we realized the pizza wasn't that great the quad Ali wasn't there I go little for it to say Little Caesars quality is better but as you got home we all ended up on a toilet and it wasn't just me it was my whole family the Pizza Hut a weird taste to it it didn't necessarily taste like pizza it tasted like cardboard in the way I've had much better pizzas out there including Frozen ones this pizza was definitely not fresh it literally tasted awful thank you for your service sir you are great but for the food wise that was awful
Catherine Q.,"Estero, FL",11,1,1,5.0,7/25/2017,We had the best server ever and her name is Francesca she was very attentive and satisfied every request we had thank you bjs brew house for a great dining experience.
Jennifer G.,"Chicago, IL",3,71,,1.0,4/4/2017,"Wow! Extremely slow service and subpar food. Burger lacked any flavor, which is disappointing. Walked in with group of 5 ladies to a nearly dead restaurant for lunch. Told the server we were on a schedule and he assured us food would be out quickly. ..it was not. Took nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks, server couldn't open a bottle of wine.  Frustrating.  Food took 45 min to arrive, and only came out for three of us, another 5 minutes for the other two. Told the manager this was all unacceptable,  she apologized, said she would make it right, but never even came back or comped anything off the bill. Final insult, asked for Ketchup which never even came. Seriously horrible service. Thankfully I live in Chicago and won't have to be back."
Tim C.,"Sterling, VA",1,40,1,1.0,5/9/2016,"I don't know if it was just a bad night or if this is always how it is, but I'm pretty sure that I won't be back.  We got there and ordered drinks. Waters and soda took 10 minutes to come out.  I waited 30 minutes for our beers to come out before I complained to the hostess. 5 minutes later, Our waitress said the bar still hadn't poured our beers. After I complain, you should be grabbing the bartender and forcing them to pour the beers after we've been waiting 35 minutes. The manager offered us 10% off our meal, but that was hardly suitable.  Now to the food. I guess I should have known when the waitress said the restaurant was known for their pizza. But I was in the mood for steak, so I ordered the rib eye. I know rib eyes are supposed to be marbled, but this one was SO fatty and tough. It might have been the worst steak I've ever had. The others at the table had burgers. They were seriously bland and gross. Almost like a middle school cafeteria burger. I can't be sure, but I think they used a frozen patty to make the burger.  Upside...beer was good (when I finally got it!), and the orange cream soda was tasty. However, I'll never taste them again because I really don't see myself going back!!"
Bill K.,"Canoga Park, CA",17,158,16,4.0,10/28/2016,"We stopped by last Tuesday before going to the airport.  I wish we would have eaten here before our last day, this was good.  We ordered steaks and pasta.  Everything came out nicely prepared.  Tried the seasonal pumpkin beer, well just because, and it was excellent!  Back home now, I guess it's time to revisit the BJs in California."
Tamara B.,"Milford, MA",0,22,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"We love this chain but this location was a terrible experience. We went at 8:30 on a Sunday so it was pretty quiet but it took over 2 hours. We had a 30 min wait between our apps & entrees. We sent back an app that was cold, we sent back a meal that was cold. All of our entrees were lukewarm. We never once had a manager come and apologize & our waiter didn't seem to care. The bathrooms were dirty with overflowing trash. Very disappointing experience & we won't be back."
Marnie H.,"Davie, FL",642,109,197,4.0,8/30/2016,"Wow! What a cool find. My sister came in to visit from Houston and I came up from Fort Lauderdale. She suggested BJ's for lunch. I thought she was talking about the warehouse store. Lol I guess she is familar with BJ's. Anyway, went for lunch and was immediately impressed with the decor. Cool looking place. Next was the menu. Yum O! I was a bit overwhelmed with all of the choices as they all looked so good. We prdered the brussel sprout appetizer. They are delicious! They have a little kick so if you aren't a fan of spicey beware. I'm not but was handle to handle it. Lunch was also very good.  I have one issue. That is that one of the wait staff unknowingly dropped a piece of bread pr something off of a plate into the walkway. Pretty much the whole time we were their, every staff memeber that walked by chose to ignore it. Right before we left a waitress kicked it, not on purpose, and it flew into a patrons leg at another table. Gross. It really bothered me that the staff didn't care more. Other than that the place is good."
Larry R.,"Arlington, VA",0,26,,2.0,10/6/2017,"Ordered a steak that came over cooked, tough and barely edible. Service poor. Served martini's in a champagne flute as the were out of martini glasses.  Overall my experience was pretty bad"
Keagan J.,"Johnstown, OH",0,1,,4.0,10/4/2017,This was a good experience I would recommend this if you like a lot of food. The portions were huge and is you are thinking of going here you have to try the French fries. Overall a great restaurant
Tammie H.,"Grand Haven Charter Township, MI",0,10,,5.0,6/29/2017,"Had dinner here while on vacation. It took a long time to get our food but it was worth the wait. Our dinners were amazing! Our table of 6 tried the Parmesan Chicken, the Pork BBQ sandwich, tacos, pizza and burgers. Everyone loved their meals and our server was awesome and very attentive. He made sure our drinks were refilled and was apologetic about how long our order was taking. We would definitely recommend!! Their menu is extensive, so there's definitely something for everyone."
Jason A.,"Miami, FL",216,78,62,4.0,2/8/2017,Came here to watch the super bowl while on vacation. They have a nice bar and the television set up was on point. The service was fast and friendly. The beer selection is vast. I was especially happy with the IPA lineup. During the game they had a happy hour special. This not only included beer and drink specials.... it also offered half off apps and pizzas. So I had some great food for very cheap which also makes me feel some type of way. I personally recommend the tuna appetizer. It was fresh and delicious. I had a great  experience watching the game and would definitely come back.... just try to make it during happy hour.
Lauren C.,"Plantation, FL",1,11,,5.0,6/20/2017,BJ's is a great place for a group of people who can't decided what they want to eat because they have EVERYTHING!!! The menu is very extensive with all kinds of food selections. The beer menu is also very extensive & just doesn't have craft beers but domestic beers too for those who don't like to venture out on different beers. The portions are quite generous for the prices & they have daily food specials along with a happy hour with drink specials but I believe it's only certain days. I would totally go back there on nights when I can't figure out what I want to eat because you're sure to find something good on the menu.
Matt N.,"Morgan Hill, CA",9,12,2,3.0,4/11/2017,"Food is good and pretty standard selection from a chain. The real reason I go is to get a pazookie. That's the real deal. We have been to this location twice. Like I said the food is fine, but the service is terrible. We were seated for 25 minutes before we had anything to drink at a 5:30 on a Sunday night. It was pretty slow and they had plenty of staff. I know being in a touristy place can typically have subpar service, because the waiter will typically make decent tip money by default. I served for 6 years in a tourism hub and I took pride in my job and worked hard, fast, and accurate for my tables. This place could use a lesson in that. Next time I will get it to go."
Jennifer H.,"Minneapolis, MN",28,114,300,3.0,8/18/2016,"I went here for a rehearsal dinner. The dinner was for a party of 20. The wedding rehearsal ran over due to weather (it was an outdoor wedding) so we were late. Part of our party arrived just before they were about to separate the tables they had setup for us. They were very nice about our tardiness and sat us promptly. There was a coupon my husband and I both received from our Yelp checkins. The coupon was for a free appetizer or dessert with meal purchase. It didn't mention anything about being a member of their rewards club. After having two waiters check with management, they honored the coupons. Which is awesome. Especially since it would be pointless for us to join their rewards program. We live out of town and this chain is in our city. The service was decent. The food was ok. Average bar food. We had a surprisingly yummy bbq flatbread, OK fried calamari, shrimp alfredo that needed more seasoning, an average burger, decent ribs, OK chicken wings and a pretty tasty monkey bread pizookie."
Dave S.,"North Attleborough, MA",1,68,,4.0,5/24/2017,"Ate here before a disney half marathon and 2 days later. Service was great and so was the food. The Mediterranean tacos were awesome. I also had the pulled pork burger and it was unreal. Beer was cold, cant ask for much more!"
Kari G.,"Panama City Beach, FL",22,9,5,3.0,5/21/2017,The food is pretty good. The deep dish pizzas are excellent. The service was rushed and we ordered wings and got them 20 minutes after everyone else's food but they did comp them. The strawberry lemonade is worth coming back for.
Mia P.,"Orlando, FL",345,520,3752,2.0,11/1/2015,"Want to say that I love the location by the Millenia Mall in Orlando. This location, by the Premium Outlets, was just a hot mess. It didn't look that busy, and we did see a lot of servers on the floor but everything we ordered took a lot longer than we would have anticipated. Getting our first round of drinks, nothing special, beer, water, and some soft drinks a took well over 20 minutes. We waited on our food over 40 minutes and our server did say how slammed it was, but we still didn't see that it was so busy. Our group was only 4 people, so it's not like we were part of a huge group.  I would not dine here again. I felt like we were not treated well and not given an explanation as to why all the times were taking so long. When I went to ask for another drink our server was putting items down and just walking away without asking if we needed anything. The food was good but that's all."
Meghan R.,"Casselberry, FL",240,265,335,2.0,11/3/2015,"I want to start out by saying that this review is hard for me to write as I usually LOVE BJ's Restaurants and have great food and service threre. Unfortunately, that was not the case on our most recent visit there.  We were sat in the bar area and were surprised at the lack of servers for the amount of people seated there. We waited at least 10 minutes for our drinks (just beer and sodas, nothing fancy), and then waited another ten minutes for our water. To top it off we waited at least 30 minutes for our food. Our server did apologize for the deals, but offered no explanations as to why things were so slow. By the time we got our food he wasn't even asking if we needed anything, just dropping things off and heading back to the kitchen/bar. I understand this location is in a very busy tourist area, but that just means that they should have been more prepared. This won't be my last visit to a BJ's Restaurant but it will be my last visit to THIS location."
