Bev R.,"Loma Linda, CA",3,2,1,1.0,7/4/2017,"Visited Orlando with my family for vacation from California to celebrate birthdays & early Mother's Day. We waited an hour for a table when they told 30-40mins. They put 11 people at a corner booth (7adults & 4 kids under the age of 6) including me 6 months pregnant! I was so upset! I told them we all can't fit there and asked to sit at the long table where they have it reserved for a party of 12. They said ""No"". I asked the waiter why they put us in a booth and he said, ""Hostess didn't want you to wait any longer and thought you could all fit in a booth since the kids are small"". Apparently the hostess has never been in a restaurant with 4 kids under the age of 6! Yeah kids completely sit still the whole time in a restaurant!! NOT!! I brushed the whole situation off my shoulder and try to enjoy family dinner. At the end I spoke to the manager and told him I was upset at the situation because I was livid & plus the pregnancy hormones didn't help either! All he could say was, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, can I get you some water?"" WTF?! Anyways, as we were waiting for our bill, that long ass table ""reserved for 12"" cancelled!!!! Not coming to this BJs again for sure!!!"
Marisa R.,"Knoxville, TN",2,11,18,2.0,3/22/2017,"This visit to BJ's was pretty disappointing. We waited about ten minutes to be greeted by our server and ultimately waited an hour for our food. The restaurant was about half full. I got up to try to find a manager to speak to about the wait, but none was to be found. There was no apology or explanation from our server until we asked why there was a long wait. (Kitchen staff had been cut since it was slow and then a lot of patrons arrived.)"
Amy S.,"Galesburg, IL",6,3,,1.0,2/26/2017,"We waited 10 minutes to be seated. Then waited another 20 minutes with menus. No one greeted us. No one took our drink orders. Two other sets of customers came in and were waited on. It wasn't until we walked out, did they care and wanted to wait on us. Our money went across the street!!"
James W.,"Augusta, GA",0,15,,5.0,8/19/2017,"I don't know why this place only has 3 1/2 stars. The best way to describe this place is an upscale Applebee's where the food is actually good. they have everything, tavern cut pizza, deep dish pizza, burgers, fish n' chips, salads, soups, steaks, and tons off appetizers BJ's has a very good beer/alcohol selection, seating area, atmosphere, and food. The highlight of the visit was definitely the waiter Michael. He was attentive, nice, and he even spelled the word dessert ( because we have a 3 year old with us). Would definitely recommend this place especially since it's within walking distance of at least three hotels. Ask if you can be seated in Michael's area because he was great!"
Nicole F.,"Lake Mary, Orlando, FL",0,43,1,2.0,2/19/2017,Went back recently on a Saturday and the service was extremely poor. My party was a group of three. At first we thought we were being ignored by our server but we quickly realized that it was just him and one other service in the section. Our section at roughly 6-8 booths and about the same amount of tables. Our poor server tried his best to accommodate all his tables. We really wanted to try some pizookies but it was almost impossible to get his attention.  The lack of service was no way his fault as we were totally understanding of the situation. This location should be ashamed for lack of judgement of volume on a busy Saturday night. This location is the closest to Disney world! We probably won't return to this location again.
Andy G.,"Saint Louis, MO",9,9,,1.0,11/20/2016,Staff took 20 minutes for drink orders.  Everything came out cold except the salads which looked like they had been microwaved then cooled to room temp.  When I sent a drink back the staff had the last laugh...I saw them laughing as I bit into my steak.  I understood in less than an hour I had diarrhea and was throwing up due to food poisoning.  Worst birthday dinner of all time.
John R.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,2,,3.0,3/24/2017,4 of us went for lunch on a Wed.Very slow not a lot of people. server was fine. Nothing special ordered. Other three got their soups then their salads. My sandwich and fries not so fast. 10-15 minutes at least passed before meal arrived. Asked who delivered it why so long he said they were making fresh fries. Really? Other in the party were 3/4 done when my meal arrived.  Food okay but time getting served was not acceptable. If they were really busy I'd say maybe. But no where near busy.
Brandon T.,"Orlando, FL",47,29,,4.0,1/13/2017,"I've been here a few times for business lunches and each time the service and food were both top notch. The environment is perfect for the professional who desires something more than the normal meal and without the worry of being bothered by loudmouths, yet still in a comfortable and non-pretentious setting."
Lisa F.,"Atlanta, GA",0,59,58,4.0,8/4/2016,"Great beer flight let the bartender surprise you on a couple. Good size on flight glass and comes in 4. Family of 12 and we all ordered different entrees. The deep dish pizza was okay nothing like Chicago deep dish and the sauce was sparse and sweet. The burgers, lettuce wraps, potato skins and spaghetti and meatballs all had rave reviews. The jambalaya also received good reviews."
Susan G.,"Orlando, FL",0,10,2,1.0,7/29/2017,I wouldn't recommend this place I was there on Thursday evening and here goes ! Waitress was good food ( hamburger came out raw ) manager came over not to concerned about problem didn't really offer any thing ! So while the new one got cooked of course my food got cold !! So that was my date night
Ed D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,6,,3.0,7/5/2016,"Mediocre. We were here on July 5th, a holiday lull - I guess. Sat at a booth in the bar, had to go get my own cocktail from the bar because our waitress went MIA. We had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and the chicken was plentiful and tasty, but the potatoes were room temp at best and the broccoli was skimpy and not warm.  I'm full and not broke. I guess that's about all I can say."
Ms. S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",74,87,69,4.0,9/6/2015,The food was delicious when we went. We had the stuffed mushrooms and the wings for appetizer. Bae and I shared a blonde dessert. The service was spectacular. The bartender guy - was very knowledgeable about the different drafts there and even suggested places around town we should try.  There are a ton of televisions there in case you go to watch a game or something. Kind of off in a private area of orlando away from the hustle and bustle traffic of Orlando. Would go again.
Brandon J.,"Alexandria, MN",0,11,2,4.0,1/22/2017,"Visited here based on yelp reviews, it was not disappointed. Food was very reasonably priced, and had great taste. Service was fantastic would definitely recommend with kids. They brought out what they call the kids starter, before the actual meal which helped our kids stay a little calm and reserved deal. Fantastic, will definitely be back."
Janet H.,"Lakeland, FL",0,15,3,1.0,6/10/2017,"It was the worst experience we have ever had at a BJ's.  Burnt rolls, burnt hamburger, burnt hamburger buns, overcooked meatballs, overcooked pizookies!  The pizookies were overcooked on the outside but raw in the middle so we sent them back, only to have them come exactly the same the second time.  The servers were frazzled, people left furious without eating, and the manager couldn't control the situation and didn't address multiple tables complaining about burnt food.  We also had a glass of water spill and not one employee assisted in cleaning it up or even acknowledged the puddle of water on the floor, before we cleaned it up ourselves."
Lynx M.,"Atlanta, GA",363,473,2981,3.0,6/9/2015,"First time going it was wonderful, I hate I can't remember my waiters name he was amazing! I ordered the chowder in a soup bowl and the b.l.t salad. Very filling to the point I couldn't order an entree I was so full. My friend ordered the calamari, that was decent. The egg rolls were pretty tasty. We got the cookie desserts, they were pretty good as well. My second time going in 3 weeks the food fell extremely flat. I ordered a steak it was blah.. the vegetables were rubbery and tasteless.. the baked potato could've been better. I did give consideration to I got there an hour before close. My companion said the mens room was awful, so i can imagine the female restrooms. My server was good and attentive. I would try them again, they have good looking stuff on the menu. 3 out of 5 stars based on both experiences. It's a shame because I would've given this place 5 stars."
M M.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/7/2017,"This restaurant was absolutely horrible. The service, the food, the cooks, the servers, and the management all need to be re-trained on customer service. The curbside servers are very rude. There was nobody there to greet and seat our party for dining in. The kids spaghetti was cold and bland and The bacon cheeseburger had been bitten and they had the nerve to serve it. It's really sad that in such an amazing location as Disneyworld this restaurant would serve food that has been eaten. Please please please do not patronize this restaurant!! Also, be mindful of returning your meal to your server at this restaurant..it could be tainted!! Eat at your own risk!!"
Ian S.,"Sacramento, CA",322,272,308,4.0,1/13/2016,"ordered for take out...my interaction with the gal over the phone was exemplary. My coworkers had requested the garlic aioli be held on the side of their sandwiches, we did get sides of the aioli, but they still put it on the sandwiches themselves. My bbq pizza was excellent. standard BJ's experience."
Roman R.,"Biedermannsdorf, Austria",0,2,,5.0,5/25/2017,"Perfect dinner with very good ribs. The sauce on it tastes so good. Get there on thursday and get a full menu for nearly the same regular price. Good atmosphere, very friendly staff."
Hudson K.,"Sunfield, MI",0,3,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Extremely slow and mediocre food once you finally get seated and get it. On a Sunday night, albeit with a decent crowd, the bar was still way understaffed with just 2 people for the entire restaurant - one for tables, one for the bar. There was no way to get a drink while waiting and no waitress assigned to keep the line at the front of house happy. Very freaking easy and profitable to do. Our waitress was so unattentive due to understaffing I had to go up to the horrid bar. I waited almost 15 minutes as the only person standing behind those seated and finally had to yell service to get it. Our waitress refilled one alcoholic beverage and that was it, at a table of 6. She refilled one water upon request and didn't check anyone else. Brutal.  Bahama Breeze across the way was a far more enjoyable experience from top to bottom. My ribs there were worlds better and fell off the bone. Dry and flavourless at BJs. I would never return."
Alfonso H.,"Mérida, Mexico",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2016,"RACIST RACIST RACIST I went to the restaurant and from the entrance the one we waited 70 minutes there were tables to sit, then we were given separate tables we asked to speak to the manager and he told us for tables that we were together it was only for Americans, and when we left we told him That there were tables that were not occupied and we were told by the manager that if we accepted it was why we wanted to be there that if we did not want to be moved to another place, there was no part of his apology. If you want to eat in this place better look for another option at the end if you can pay there are better places than this and do not let them treat you badly they are racist all that bad"
