Karen P.,"Orlando, FL",266,172,208,3.0,10/24/2015,"On a Thursday evening with an NFL game on, there should be more than one bartender and one server in the bar area. We wait at length for our drinks (ten minutes), and then waited for our water (ten minutes after that), and then our food (at least 30 minutes). Our server was polite, but clearly overworked. I ordered the brussel sprouts and stuffed mushroom caps and both came out on ""hot plates"" but the food temperature was luke warm at best. While I understand the desire to serve all patrons in a party at the same time, vegetables get cold quick while waiting for pizzas (even the small ones) to cook.  If I am go to visit BJs again, I will be going to a different one in the same area where I know the service is solid and the food always comes out hot."
Jenna E.,"Miami, FL",221,5,4,1.0,5/28/2016,Came in and the bar refused to serve us. They said they would seat us at a table and the hostess took us and sat us down. 5 minutes later we were told they would not serve us food or beverages. Our party had just come from Disney for dinner. Poor customer service when clearly they were not busy.
Darla S.,"Williamsville, NY",8,7,14,5.0,8/12/2016,Food was great. Lots of choices on the menu. Serving staff was outstanding. Friendly and helpful. Great for large groups. Lots of great drink choices. Sports bar atmosphere but family friendly.
Gabriela A.,"Miami, FL",0,4,2,5.0,4/11/2016,"Delicious food, amazing strawberry mojito. Great service. Love this place. Definitely worth it."
Jorge R.,"Aventura, FL",15,13,15,1.0,7/10/2016,"Staff was not paying attention. Host was spaced out and didn't notice when we walked in. We had to call him for attention. After we were seated, the waiter/waitress didn't show up. Waited about 10-15 mins and left. It was not busy, there was no wait and plenty of open tables."
Melissa '.,"Naples, FL",91,5,,5.0,10/3/2016,The gluten-free pizza and cookie dessert is amazing! Love this place
Carl Vincent C.,"Sacramento, CA",478,122,332,5.0,8/12/2014,"I always go to BJ's, wherever I am because I usually crave a pulled pork sandwich and a orange cream soda. I never think to review any BJ's because well, I go to eat and leave. This is by far the best one I've been to. I first came here with a bunch of friends on one of our days off from working at Disney World and the staff was the friendliest sets of servers I've ever encountered. Granted, my group of friends just makes friends randomly, but they were enjoying our company. Our server, Sarah (ask for tall Sarah), always chatted with us when she wasn't busy and had other servers come talk to us because we were so fun. My friends and I became regulars and the staff knew who we were and always asked for Ryan, Kim, Sarah or Marvin to serve us. It's literally a fun time and great experience with them and honestly started hanging out with one of them. The managers are great as well! We wanted to talk to them to praise how amazing their workers were and they were great to be around as well. Oh the food's good too, don't worry about that. haha CAN I JUST GIVE THEM 10 STARS!?"
Eric P.,"Buffalo, NY",26,45,63,3.0,9/14/2014,This was one of the better chain restaurants we hit on our visit to Orlando.   Its nicely decorated and has more of an upscale feeling to it.  They offer their own beer as well as a few guest taps. I ordered an individual extreme pepperoni pizza.  It was larger than I expected and cooked nice and brown.  I was a bit disappointed with the pepperoni though.  They way it was described on the menu I thought it would be thicker and chunkier.  It was standard thin slices of pepperoni.  Good tasting regardless. For dessert the pizookie eas a nice surprise.  Its a warm cookie in a pizza pan topped with ice cream and a Ghirardelli chocolate square.  We had the salt caramel but they offer several variations of it. Our server was attentive but not in your face.  Probably some of the best service we received on our trip.
Ame B.,"Miami Lakes, FL",64,18,4,5.0,1/4/2017,"Just stopped in for a quick lunch before heading back on the road. Arrived shortly after opening, 11:15ish and ordered the baby spaghetti and calamari to start. After a short while our server notified us that the spaghetti wasn't quite ready and offered different options for the baby. We stuck with our order and waited, but she brought bread and fruit in the interim. After a bit, we received all of our food. Everything was fresh and tasted delicious. The entire time the server was very attentive and apologetic; honestly we were relaxed and didn't realize it was taking longer than usual... it was nice to not feel rushed. And at the end the manager comped our entire bill! What unreal amazing customer service...especially for Florida! Totally not necessary and unexpected. However, after being in the restaurant industry for many years THIS is how you treat customers. They took it upon themselves to do what they thought was right; we didn't complain (again I've been in their shoes before) and we enjoyed our experience. Just thought I'd share this story and thank the manager and our server for making us feel like valued customers. We will be back one day!"
JC R.,"Orlando, FL",0,5,,2.0,1/18/2017,"Arrived at 6:15 on a Saturday night, first big mistake for a local, we left at 7:45pm and myself and my daughter did not eat. First,  we had to wait longer than quoted. Our server offered to order my daughters meal as soon as we sat down since the rest of us were not ready to order.  We didnt get her food until after our meals were ordered, delivered and then after that, we had to ask for it. I ordered a salad and it was missing ingredients, only 2 ingredients were in it. I finally ordered another salad to replace it and waited and waited, when I was about to ask for the check, we received  the salad, but I had no utensils to eat it with.  When the server finally returned with the check she asked if I wanted it boxed up, I told her no I would have liked to eat it, but I never had a fork to eat it with, yikes!  She brought the check and the salad was still on it, my daughters meal was sent back too, it was pretty bad. We were there for 90 minutes and we didn't get to eat.  Lesson learned, won't go back"
Ed W.,"Gainesville, FL",221,815,1256,2.0,8/26/2015,"I had Mediterranean pita tacos, and unsweetened tea. We had been recommended this place by the person at the hotel, but I was not really impressed. The taco had so much liquid stuff poured on it, that it ended up dribbling out of the end when I ate it. It was a real challenge to not make a complete mess. The tea was bitter, and therefore not really great. The server started out friendly, but soon disappeared never to be seen from again. I suspect maybe she was abducted by space creatures, but I am not completely sure. What I do know, is that we had somewhere else to be, after all BJ's is not a major destination in Orlando, and we had to sit and sit and sit as we waited for the check. All in all, I do not think I will stop back by again."
Justin L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",252,41,353,1.0,7/29/2015,"Food from BJ's is always good, but this review is based on this location's service. Out of all the BJ's I've ever been to, this has got to be the worst location ever. We came in about 9pm on a Wednesday or Thursday night, I forgot, and we were super disappointed. We were seated within 5 minutes but once we sat down, there was no service. No waiter or waitress came to take our order or even ask us what we wanted to drink. We saw people coming in after us getting service so we were super mad. What made it worst was that we were all pretty hungry. After about 45 minutes give or take, we had enough and just got up and left. 10/10 would never come back to this location ever again."
GERMEL S.,"San Dimas, CA",5,16,6,5.0,7/8/2016,"On vacay and this restaurant happened to be near our hotel. Walked in around 8pm and got seated within 10 mins, not bad considering 2 large parties who came in before us were being seated. As soon as we got seated our server Megan came over and took our drink and appetizer orders.  She was very bubbly and polite. Our drinks came promptly and soon after our appetizer arrived. The calamari was a delicious starter. I ordered 1/2 rack of ribs with grilled asparagus and rice pilaf. Ribs were delicious and sides were cooked perfectly. My wife ordered her usual, BBQ chicken salad which she enjoyed. Megan kept our glasses full and checked on us frequently. Overall the service and food was great."
Tara W.,"Big Pine Key, FL",86,4,,1.0,8/2/2016,"The service was awful. We ordered beer off the menu two different times the server took the order and then came back saying that they couldn't do that particular beer with the order. One person in our party of 4 ordered the soup and salad and the soup came out as a different soup that was ordered. We all finished our full meals before her soup finally came out. We then asked for a manager and that was 10 minutes ago and still no manager. I am writing this as we are waiting. The restaurant is about 2/3 empty, so it is not because they are slammed. Would never come here again! Too many great restaurants in this town and I wouldn't waste my time."
Krismar A.,"Miami, FL",198,66,344,4.0,5/17/2015,"The style of restaurant is comparable to a TGIF or Chili's, however, the food is surprisingly good. Definitely a place a crave. They do brew their own beers and root beers (they have a large selection of imported and domestic as well). I honestly have not tried something at this place that I have not liked. Their deserts are great! Especially the Oreo Skillet!"
Jeff C.,"Millstone, NJ",25,32,18,4.0,10/2/2015,Beer was great food was good service was good ambiance was nice bar was cool no complaints.
M. H.,"Lake Mary, FL",34,3,,4.0,4/27/2016,"My husband and I went to eat here last night at around 11pm. We knew they closed at 12a, but we were desperate for food and this was the only restaurant still open. This was our first time here and we were very surprised. Although we were sat right away at a very comfy booth, it took the server a a few minutes to come over. We assumed she was busy and the only server on so late. We started off with the cream sodas to drink and they were delicious!! The orange cream was outstanding and I could've drank ten of them. For our appetizer we ordered the California Chicken Club flatbread and that was equally amazing!! It was just big enough for the two of us to share. Our server was very prompt for the rest of the evening and she made sure we had our drinks refilled and that we were still doing okay. She was very sweet about letting my husband order off the lunch menu (even though it was about 11:15-11:20 by this time). When our food came out everything was so delicious. Overall this was a great experience and we will be coming back to try the other menu options!  Note: They have a big menu, if it's your first time and you're eating within time restraints you should pre-read their menu online."
Jonna B.,"Sarasota, FL",14,4,7,2.0,5/9/2015,The atmosphere was generic and no one greeted us for a couple of minutes (there was no one waiting at the hostess stand). Then we were finally sat and no waiter greeted us for 10 minutes. So we left. As we were leaving the manager thanked us for coming as we were returning our menus...totally oblivious. We obviously didn't stay to eat so I can't speak for the food. It was 6:00 on a Saturday night. Don't go.
Evelyn P.,"Celebration, Orlando, FL",133,168,728,4.0,4/19/2015,"We just ordered a variety of appetizers and enjoyed them...  I think of this place as an upscale of miller ale house.  The portions are appropriate.  We also had the green flash beer, maximum hops, and strawberry mojito which were all flavorful."
Brenna P.,"Orlando, FL",85,305,55,1.0,2/10/2015,"This pains me to write. I really like BJ's- I'm even a rewards member. But his location needs a swift kick in the pants. We went with some coworkers and sat on the outside patio. Our server began telling us about happy hour and took several drink orders. Another young lady walks up, takes his pad and says it is HER table and dismisses him. She is high strung and confused about what has already been ordered and we wait far too long for any of our drinks or appetizers. Several orders are wrong. Then she starts bringing checks and nothing has been discounted. We ask why and are told happy hour is just for the bar and patio... remember we are on the patio. She then says ""oh not this portion of the patio..."". So was our first server lying? she gets flustered and says she'll get the manager. Now I was on a bit of a time crunch, so I asked to just have my check sorted (it had missing/wrong items) but she refused to take it until the manager had come. After 20 minutes, still no manager, so some members went inside and just settled at the bar. Eventually I got a correct check, and the manager made an appearance for about 30 seconds (after we'd been waiting for over half an hour). Abysmal service and wait times. All that being said, the beer is wonderful and the food is really yummy. I have never had a bad experience in the bar area or at other locations. Get it together new location!"
