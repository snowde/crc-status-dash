Jeff W.,"Suwanee, GA",119,130,12,3.0,1/5/2018,"Good spot for getting upscale pub food while watching the big game.  The menu is overwhelming in size, but should guarantee something for everyone.   Their known for flatbreads, burgers, and cookie deserts.  My favorites were the tomato basil flatbread and the brisket burger.  The sausage appetizer was also delightful.  I seemed more enameled with the fare than my 7 dining companions.  We did have to send three items back - one was wrong and two were cold. It is a nice space and service was decent and friendly."
Maya C.,"Jacksonville, FL",207,524,2099,4.0,12/8/2017,"Sometimes you gotta compromise. BJ's is not on my list of places I want to eat when I go out of town but when you're traveling with a friend who isn't as adventurous as you are you gotta make due. A standard chain with decent food was our choice and this place was near our hotel. She was happy, I was ""meh"". Our server was awesome though. I wish I could remember his name because everyone needs to have him wait on them. He pulls no punches and treated us like his friends. Some of the best service I'd ever had. He recommended the Avocado Egg Rolls as an app and while I initially passed on it, I decided to get them when ordering my entree. The egg rolls had avocado in them of course, but also cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, chipotle peppers and spices with a side of sweet tamarind sauce. Holy wow, these were pretty dang good. My friend took two and was done with them. No problem here, I ate the rest. She ordered mozzarella sticks and while they were good, you can get those anywhere and that's no fun. I think I'm fancy so I ordered a drink, the Blood Orange Pom Sangria but I neglected to see that the liquor is Fireball Whiskey and Merlot. Oh man. This is not a drink for an empty stomach nor to be guzzled but it is delicious.  We ordered our entrees. I chose the Seared Ahi Salad and she choose the Deep Dish Ziti. My salad was piled high with a lot of veggies. After feeling like I ate like crap at Universal this was my way of balancing everything out. It was great but I think that there was a bit too much seasoning on my ahi to my liking. I ate it anyway. My friend said her ziti was really good. I tried some and again, just ""meh"". You can really taste all the Italian seasonings and spices in it and it's not lacking in flavor at all, but it didn't WOW me. This stop was actually pretty decent and if I REALLLLLLY needed to, I'd come again."
Irene L.,"Orlando, FL",45,26,10,1.0,7/23/2017,"So I was out to lunch with two of my coworkers and we decided to visit for lunch this past Friday. We had gone to the BJ's on Millenia separately and had a great experience. That means we should have a great experience at this location, right? Wrong. We arrived at about 12:15pm and got seated immediately. The restaurant didn't seem too busy which we thought was a good sign. There were lots of empty tables in our area. After about 10 minutes, a woman that seemed like the manager asked if our server had stopped by our table yet and we explained that they did not. She proceeded to take our drink order but we didn't see our drinks until another 10 minutes later when our server finally came to our table. 20 minutes, to get a water, a sweet and an unsweet tea. Strike 1. Our server apologized for our wait and asked if we were ready to order. We were so we ordered cauliflower barbacoa tacos, penne pasta, and a California club (lightly toasted with no avocado). It took our server probably 10 minutes to put the order in the tablet. She seemed like she was struggling lowith what seemed like a simple task. Strike 2. We're already 30 minutes into our visit with no food on our table. Let me remind you, we were on our lunch break from work. So we chatted, and waited...and waited some more. Our server came to our table with a tray of drinks and was about to put one on the table. But she paused and realized the drinks weren't for our table. So she apologized for the wait (again), and said she JUST checked on our food and it should be right out. Lies. Like I said...she was struggling. We've now been at the restaurant 50 minutes with no food. Strike 3. Realizing how long we've been waiting and that we had to get back to work, our server was walking by and we asked her for our food to go. She once again apologized and said no problem and rushed back to the kitchen. Moments later, our food comes out boxed up and ready to go. Uh, what the heck happened here? She apologized again and we asked for our check. She came back with the check, another apology from the waitress, and paid cash so we can as soon as we could and not have to wait for the snail in molasses service. I've never had so many apologies in a visit to a restaurant before. Obviously, there was a problem that could not get resolved. We got our food back to work and now had cold food. My tacos tasted good but it would have been nicer to enjoy them warm. My coworkers sandwich was almost black and had huge chunks of avocado in it. What happened to lightly toasted and no avocado? So let's just say, our experience was unacceptable and we will not be visiting this location as a group or with friends or family. You can guarantee we'll let our friends and family know of our experience as well to save them the trouble."
Gracie J.,"Irvine, CA",216,682,329,3.0,11/22/2017,"One of those places I had to go to out of convenience as I was traveling for work and eating lunch with colleagues. The food was decent and the waitress was hospitable. The food, however, took a bit long to come out. The waitress apologized, but still, it shouldn't take 20 minutes to make a salad. The restaurant was not full but the slow service time made us rush our meal to get back to work within an hour. Overall, nothing remarkable about this place unfortunately."
Rogerio F.,"Montgomery, IL",1260,172,3649,3.0,2/14/2017,"Good was good and nice friendly service.  Started off with chips abs artichoke spinach dip. We had several pizzas and I liked the sweet Puig the best. Also enjoyed a very delicious salad and large  chicken tenders. Had a couple of mojitos which were OK, being this was a brewery, perhaps I should not expect the near mojitos but if you're going to offer them, then they could've been better. Had a strawberry and a normal mojito but they lacked taste. They tasted like they were made with some mix from a bottle."
Margaret V.,"Canton, MI",286,1086,186,4.0,3/19/2017,"We had a great dinner at Bj's! Given this isn't a chain in the Detroit area, we thought we sound give it a chance, and we are so glad we did.  The ambiance is nice! Classier than a ""normal"" neighborhood bar. The menu is very familiar, they have plenty of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, entrees, pastas and desserts.  My mom and I both ordered the pasta. Mom had the deep dish ziti and said it was fantastic! Plenty of pasta, cheese, sauce and meat. The pasta was served with a few pieces of garlic bread. She gave me one, and it was delicious! I was in the mood for something different (for me) and ended up in the buckwheat pasta dish. It was delicious! Plenty of pasta, chicken and broccoli with a peanut style, somewhat spicy Asian sauce. While it was a tad too much sauce, it was so tasty. I wish I could have taken it back to my hotel... The service really impressed me. They were not pushy when it came to ordering appetizers, gave us plenty of time and were so friendly!  They have a full bar! My mom enjoyed an o'douls  and I had a Pinot Grigio.  BJ's is a great place to have a wonderful meal and I recommend it!!"
Carmen S.,"Jacksonville, FL",28,3,,1.0,12/13/2017,"Came here with my coworkers for a Christmas lunch. Being that the restaurant was mostly empty, we waited almost 15 min to GET OUR DRINKS. Our waiter walked right past us several times and he wasn't attentive to our needs at the table. Most of our food came out cold. First and last time coming to this location! Terrible!!"
Fred K.,"Gilbert, AZ",4,93,,3.0,4/12/2017,"I was visiting Florida and there was a BJ's across the street from the hotel we were staying in so, for familiarity sake we went here on two separate occasions for lunch and for dessert. Both times it was really slow in the restaurant which generally means quick service. Incorrect on both occasions here.  On the lunch occasion when we came in there were only 4 other tables seated. We ordered our drinks which took about 10 minutes to get to us which was weird considering it was only water and soda. I got the Thursday special which is ribs and a mini pizookie. Food came out about 25 minutes later, which again, seems like a bit of a long wait. What I found odd was that I got a full rack of ribs and they came out as two half racks which is fine. But, one half of my racks was hot and tasted good, good moisture in the ribs, great BBQ sauce covering. The other half was warm,dry,no sauce. So I am not too sure how that happens.  So we also came in a different night just for dessert at about 9PM. Again, very slow. A few people at the bar, maybe 6 tables sat. After we were sat our waitress didn't show up for at least 15 minutes. We ordered 3 pizookies to share among the 5 of us. It took them over a half an hour to get there. They were absolutely delicious and I will never say anything against the food on this occasion, but why? Why did it take that long with an empty restaurant? I just don't understand why this particular place has such slow service. I would not want to walk in there on a busy night."
Alexandra R.,"Orlando, FL",0,10,,1.0,12/7/2017,Do NOT waste your time at the I drive location.  I've been here multiple times because the one in St. Pete is awesome but every single time I've come to this one the service was slower than slow with a near empty restaurant. The food takes forever every time and this includes the times when you only want dessert. The bartenders and wait staff I met aren't friendly at all and the overall place has made me feel more like they were actually putting effort into ruining the experience instead of creating a positive experience. It is way overpriced for the quality of the entire place and the food isn't even that good. Its a very generic place that I am happy to allow to blend into all of the other plain jane places out there that I won't be stepping foot into ever again.
Mahmoud E.,"Orlando, FL",995,142,426,3.0,5/17/2017,"Well the good and the bad , the bad that the food took 2 hrs to arrive and when it came it was cold and my steak was burned , the good was the manager and the staff tried their best to make it right , very nice service and I have been here before and it was much better but tonight was just a rough night for the kitchen ."
Jonathan P.,"Chesapeake, VA",10,31,7,3.0,10/19/2017,I only gave it 3 stars because the staff and service was very nice.  Rating it on food only I would only give it 2 stars.  The place and food is ok but not memorable.  The food definitely does not taste like freshly made from raw ingredients.  It is typical institutional fare.  This is the 3rd location I have eaten at and all are consistent and similar.  They are a notch above a TGIF or a Ruby Tuesday's.
Jen B.,"Clermont, FL",180,382,231,3.0,5/7/2017,"Usually I'm a fan but we hit it late on a Saturday night and I guess it was just an off night. Kind of crazy to have issues even getting sweet tea and the rest of the drinks but it did happen. The food was okay but I think 4 or 5 out of 6 of us had issues with our plates when they came out being wrong or messed up. The server was quick to fix everything and the manager was aware, but oddly never swung by for a visit. We may try it again some day but it's just middle of the road as far as choices go. Our company made the visit fun and like I said, the food wasn't bad, just an off night I guess."
Michelle S.,"Clermont, FL",37,98,29,3.0,5/2/2017,"Here for dinner late on a Saturday and the service was pretty bad.  Our waiter messed up every order we had except for dessert.  I wasn't impressed by the place.  This location isn't top on my BJs list.  If I was going to BJs again, Id pick another location, its just too busy and the traffic is insane on IDrive.  I got a deep dish pizza and it came out with chicken on it instead of ham, and others in our party had minor things missing, like the fixings for a burger.  She got a turkey burger with only a slice of cheese on it.  The BBQ sandwich we got was terrible.  Granted, they aren't out back smoking ribs so it leaves a lot to be desired for BBQ.   Beer here is pretty good.  They have their own line of brews which is worth trying a flight.   Again, I'd pass on the BBQ plate and maybe opt for the chicken/avocado club.  It was pretty tasty with nicely toasted bread and fresh avocado.  Their pizza is pretty good too, either flatbread or deep dish is good.   Bottom line, BJs isn't bad...I do like their food, but this last time we just had a pretty bad experience all around.  The manager never did come to the table and talk to us, just cleared part of our bill and we got dessert free.  Id go back to BJs but not this location."
Paula W.,"Tampa, FL",5,34,10,2.0,10/21/2017,"Serice was SLOW even though it wasn't busy. Food was ok but luke warm at best. Had to ask for water , utensils, more drinks , plates for apps and for our dishes to be cleared.   Yes Prob wont be back anytime soon."
Hashani S.,"Ventura, CA",492,523,766,3.0,10/5/2016,"2.5 stars  We ordered take out from this BJs location while we were Netflix and Chilling in our last night in Orlando. We decided to go with BJs since we had Uno's earlier in the week. I assured my bf it was just as good. Sadly, it just wasn't the same as I've had it the past. And, they forgot the cilantro, the best combination with bbq chicken and red onions. Overall, it just wasn't as appetizing or tasty. I hope they didn't rush it.  The host and bartender were nice though. It just took them forever to bring my food out from the kitchen."
Hemanth S.,"Verona, WI",2,10,,1.0,6/21/2017,"Had perhaps the worst service in the last 10 years at the BJs on International Drive in Orlando.  Our waitress was friendly but they essentially lost my wife's order and then kept coming back with ""it's coming right up""... when in fact it wasn't.  Two managers stopped by with similar lame explanations and we finally got her dish to go after more than 2 hours in the place.  I simply don't accept that ""the kitchen got busy"" when food is streaming out of the kitchen to tables seated an hour after we arrived and we still don't have our meals.  Tell me the truth and tell me how you're going to fix it. It's called food service 101 and you totally failed tonight. The food quality was pretty average and thankfully I'll never eat here or any other location of this place again."
Jose B.,"Miramar, FL",24,105,60,4.0,3/7/2017,"Great food, good prices. Waitress was very friendly and the service was fast. Great place to go in Orlando but make sure you make reservations as this place gets packed!!! Or you eat late - after 9pm"
Katie G.,"Hopkins, MN",29,9,20,2.0,5/20/2017,"Came for a quick lunch during my stay for a conference. The bar and restaurant had a decent amount of people but it wasn't too busy so I figured I'd be able to get in and out quickly and back to the conference. However, the bartender had all the tables and spots up to the bar, and was getting his butt kicked. As he is racing around trying to get to everyone, servers are just casually walking around minding their own business. Amidst the chaos, he messes up an order or two, and completely forgets to put into an order for another table all together. Customers had to ask for refills, silverware, their checks, etc. all things that a solid server/bartender has foresight to do before they are asked. I've been a server and manager in a restaurant so I feel his pain in being so busy that you can't catch up. It's upsetting he didn't ask for help, but I'm more disappointed in the management. Not once did the manager walk through to gage service and needs of both staff and patrons. This manager was either incompetent in his role or just didn't care. I'm not sure what is worse! The food took longer than expected and left many customers (a majority were also there from the same conference and were on a time crunch) rushing to eat when the food finally arrived. I got the California Chicken Club, which tastes good- pretty standard.  If you're looking for a quick lunch and good service, I recommend going to a different restaurant. There are plenty of other options in the area!"
Nathan B.,"Windermere, FL",40,37,12,4.0,2/24/2017,"As a local Orlando resident who lives near I-Drive, this is one of our go to chain restaurants in the I-drive area. The food is consistently good, and the menu has a wide variety of both food and drink items for every person. Their price point is also lower than other brew house/sports bars like Yard House. They also have a great curbside/takeout system where food is always been packaged well and still warm once we get home to eat it.  My favorite items are their healthy entrees, especially the noodle/quinoa/rice bowls. Their pizza and burgers are good too! I'm not a big fan of their appetizers as its all just yesterday's cheese, meat and vegetables fried plus a dipping sauce and then priced too high. But that's my opinion of appetizers at many chain restaurants. If you come here and don't order a dessert you're missing out! Their pizookies are like nothing else and never fail to impress. However, you really need at least 2 or 3 people to share them though as they are big. A couple times we've had slow service when their really busy during a sporting event etc, but overall the servers are friendly, efficient and professional."
Matthew H.,"Altamonte Springs, Orlando, FL",66,122,286,2.0,1/13/2017,"I'd say 2 stars is a generous review. My wife and I went in for lunch during a relatively slow time. All seemed we as we were quickly seated by the host.  The waiter stopped by and asked if I had the rewards app and I stated I didn't but please wait to explain it until my wife was back from the restroom. He insisted on explaining it anyway and left the table. He eventually came back with waters and never explained it again once my wife was seated.  He asked if we had questions but didn't seem to know any of the answers. He was confused on the daily rib special and even the fact that they offered a kale salad. Very uneducated on the menu basics.  We placed our order and i asked to have my drink now my wife wanted to wait. He decided to hold both drinks for about 20 mins until the food arrived. Only thing was we had to ask 2 additional times for him to bring us our drinks.  My wife had a small wedge salad appetizer and when she finished she put the plate on the edge of the table. After 4 visits and asking multiple times to take the plate he never did. I had to almost literally open his hand and place the plate in it for him to take it.  On top of everything when we tried to ask a question he would start walking away and didn't really listen to us.   To cap it all off when I went to provide my rewards number he took the phone and disappeared for about 10 mins. Not sure why he couldn't use his pen and note pad to copy the number but it seemed kind of silly to take the phone for so long.      Over all it was a disappointing visit, and I don't remember the food to much because the service was so bad I just wanted to leave"
Andrea S.,"Houston, TX",127,6,13,1.0,1/28/2017,"The experience at this restaurant truly doesn't deserve the 1 star I am required to give. I had come here with a group of 7. We are visiting Orlando for the Pro Bowl and we're happy to come here because it was something new. I truly didn't expect to be treated the way that we were.  So I had a simple order of Atlantic Salmon with Double Broccoli, simple right?! Apparently not. My order arrived with the salmon with rice and  mixed vegetables. I advised that this was incorrect. The 2nd time around all they did was slap broccoli on top of the original order. The 3rd time around they partially removed the mixed vegetables and slapped the original salmon on the plate omitting the sauce.  At this point I take my plate and find a manager. I explain the situation and I get barely an apology. My good comes out and IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SAUCE.  I have an issue with the fact that the manager did not touch the table to make sure that my order was correct. The service was very poor and I did not feel as though they cared enough.  To top it off, we ordered 2 pizzokie's and needed additional spoons. We asked the guy who dropped off the desserts. Nothing. We asked our waiter for spoons. Nothing. We finally flagged down a random waiter and she brings the spoons extremely fast. So fast in fact that a couple of us literally said ""oh WOW"".  It's disappointing to come from out of town to leave within a visit sick as this. I hope that the staff reads this and does better. Smh."
Maya G.,"Doral, FL",10,29,100,2.0,4/14/2017,"Overall experience: bad!!! Services to slow to be and a tourist area , they need to have more personal working on every shift, arrive to the restaurant at 8:20 order pizza, pasta and salmon and hour later finally the food arrives !!do not come to eat if you are and hurry"
Marissa A.,"Simi Valley, CA",6,28,16,4.0,7/5/2017,"This place is pretty good, and they do have some vegan options! I got the spaghetti with marina and it was good, but nothing amazing. our group was in a rush to get to the airport and our waitress did a great job at getting us in and out quick."
Carlos C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",23,20,25,5.0,1/25/2017,"What an amazing experience! Came here late for some desert and some chips, guacamole, and spinach artichoke dip. The staff was really great friendly and personable.  We had fun and were well taken care of.   This is a really good reflection of the management. I was attending a   conference and gathered so many incredible business nuggets for my corporation and recorded them into my journal. Unfortunately I left my journal at the restaurant. Now I am back home in California...... so I called and spoke with the General manager Turrdura and he was awesome and agreed to send it! Wow going above and beyond. I am truly grateful and will do my best to let everyone know what a great place BJ's Restaurant is..... from food to staff to even the General Manager! Thank you so much Turrdura! I will be back someday and I am looking forward to meeting you in person.   Go check this place out!!"
Josh W.,"Macomb, MI",18,11,3,5.0,2/6/2017,"Great experience here with a group of 9 people. The craft sodas were rich and unique, especially the root beer and black cherry. We tried several appetizers, my only criticism would be that the calamari was unseasoned, like not just under, but nonexistent. The root beer ribs were phenomenal, we had order them like an app. For dinner my entree was the jambalaya and hit the spot. Was very well seasoned and the heat built up throughout the portion in a good way. The shrimp was perfectly prepared and chicken stayed tender. I was stuffed but was able to try a small taste of one of those cookie ice cream plates. Superb! Soft chewy cookie and great balance of sweetness. Overall a great experience, especially sitting outside with the fire table. Made for an enjoyable dinner."
Jesus F.,"Burbank, CA",5,18,1,1.0,11/19/2016,This place has the one of the best Hefeweizen beers in Orlando and probably the worst service too. These severs are so dumb that they are not even able to read a table properly.  Every single time I come here I leave very disappointed. This last time I ordered chicken tenders for my son and avocado rolls for me which is an appetizer btw. It took so long that even the people seating right behind us got the order which btw was a full meal and we didn't (about 25 mts)  The bottom line is if you want to feel like someone is doing you a favor while you spend your money please go to this place. It's just for you!!
Jennifer R.,"Orlando, FL",143,524,67,4.0,12/14/2016,"Another great location for the BJ's brand. The beer and pizza never disappoint! I'm not sure what more I can say other than you will not be sad you made the choice to walk in a BJ's door. As a side note, do yourself a favor and grab an order of the sriracha brussel sprouts... I'm not a hot food kind of girl but these little balls of heaven pack just enough heat with a whole lot of amazing!"
Dave H.,"Boca Raton, FL",1176,675,784,3.0,4/24/2016,"Taste: decent deep-dish pizza, bread kinda mediocre Decor: clean franchisee Service: very friendly but inefficient and slow Price for quality: not too bad, but not cheap Beers: middling to decent selection, BJ house brews 50/50, which is actually a good percentage (ask a baseball fan!) Sat at the bar for a pizza and a beer, the bartender was having a hard time meeting some special orders...got a flight with no hassle, id mat and all, but waited another 17 minutes just to catch a glance to put in the food order, which then took quite some time to come out. Got a club soda but no refill ask... they do not have the timing of follow-through down. Was an off hour (4pm on a Sunday) so could be shift change doldrums... Their home-brewed stout is a pretty good beer, as is their IPA, though the nut-brown and porter were unworthy of a quaff. The flights are hefty 4-sets so you can decide for yourself."
Allison M.,"Denver, CO",25,99,18,3.0,12/15/2016,We sat outside and I had the Parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken breasts were extremely flat and didn't have much flavor. The mashed potatoes were pretty good though. My coworker got the Cobb salad and that looked amazing. He said it was delicious along with the lemonade he got. Service was extremely slow. At one point we asked the bartender where our waiter disappeared to.
Michael B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,145,64,3.0,1/14/2017,"I-Drive is packed with casual dining restaurants and the experience at BJ's was average. We ordered the boneless wings (BBQ were great), a Santa Fe salad which was amazing, a medium BJ's favorite pizza - this was very average but can feed a ton of people and is very filling, a beer sampler and a couple other beers - the Jeremiah red was my favorite, a blue cheese burger - that had overpowering blue cheese, and the triple chocolate pizookie - soo tasty and a big portion for the price."
Steve A.,"Orlando, FL",216,1075,3005,4.0,10/15/2015,"This BJ's has the nicest interior decor of any BJ's I've been to. As with all of them it has a very extensive menu, and a full page devoted to a very clearly described array of beers.  We took a large (16 people) group here after playing the Escape game nearby, and our servers did an amazing job of dealing with so many people. I really liked the queso dip appetizer, which was more about chili than cheese. The appetizer combo was less exciting, and I particularly disliked the egg rolls and the spinach dip. My entree, the ahi tuna salad, was delicious, with tender, rare slices of ahi arranged around a nicely tossed pile of greens with just the right amount of tangy dressing, and a nice variety of textures. In short, this is a great place for large groups or small parties, for groups who all want something different to eat, and for beer lovers. One of the better choices on I-Drive, for sure."
George D.,"Orlando, FL",259,704,1741,4.0,5/30/2015,"We were part of a large group dining at this restaurant this particular evening. My wife and I both ordered a margarita. It was the worst margarita I have ever had.  I returned immediately, and the server informed me that it is the sour margarita mix that they use. I have dined at restaurants all over the Orlando area.  I have had margaritas everywhere, even at home.  This drink was absolutely horrible.  It was so sour I felt like my brain was going to cave into my head.  I then ordered a Guinness beer, and my wife ordered a Blue Moon, at least we knew what we were getting. I ordered a Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon that was absolutely delightful. My wife ordered the North Beach Mahi Mahi with couscous and shrimp, it too was delicious.  All the servers and staff that we encountered that night were very pleasant, very courteous and I noticed the teamwork when everyone was pretty much served at the same time.   Good food, good experience, lousy margaritas."
Es J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,49,4,1.0,5/23/2017,"Terrible service. Walked in for lunch with the family and was immediately ignored by hostess for a good 3 min, not even a hello, no one else there waiting to be seated.  Not until the manager walks up did he speak and then tried to play it off like he didn't see us. Really? Manager seats us and some disgruntled waitress tells us she'll be back. Long story short, takes forever to even order, longer for the food, and the portions were ridiculously small! Paid like $75 for lunch for family! Then had to hear the waitress fish for tips at the adjoining table with the oldest line in the book, the ole I'm a single mom whoa is me..cmon...Don't waste your time or money here, trust me"
Jessi M.,"Boca Raton, FL",350,223,620,3.0,5/2/2017,"I've been to another BJ's in Dallas and really liked the food so when I noticed it was right down the street from our hotel, it was a definite. Unfortunately we came kind of late on a Saturday after spending the day at Magic Kingdom. Our waitress was really nice but the kitchen and bar took absolutely forever to make our orders. None of us were too thrilled about that, even our friends almost cancelled their drink/food orders. My boyfriend had ordered one of the new margaritas on the menu which he though was terrible. Good thing our waitress was reasonable, she replaced it with no questions asked and didn't put it on the bill. Overall, the food was good but the manager needs to improve the late night service if they are going to stay open that late."
Carleen O.,"Memphis, TN",0,18,,2.0,3/18/2017,"This place felt like it could be a Cheesecake Factory for people that like beer. We had the IPA and Pale Ales and they were fine; nothing phenomenal.  We went in around 9:30pm and sat at the bar on a Thursday night. The bartender was extremely friendly and frequently checked on us. We ordered the spinach/artichoke dip and asked for some veggies instead of all chips. He went out of his way to get carrots and celery. He offered cucumbers from the bar but half of the ones he gave had tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile (warm and a tangy/sour). These might have been at the bottom of the storage container. Not good.  We then ordered a deep dish pizza and it took a LONG time to come out. After more than 30 min, the manager came out and dropped our pizza off saying ""we had them make you another because it wasn't up to our standard"". At this point it was around 11pm and we would have appreciated someone acknowledging that a pizza was being remade. We ordered the ""Favorite"" which is essentially the supreme. Cook completely forgot the mushrooms.  The bartender offered us a free round but it was late and we were tired. Thankfully the food was on happy hour. Left tired and annoyed."

Great to know this place offers a quinoa salad, cauliflower soft tacos and a couple of other meat/dairy-less options. I ordered the strawberry basil margarita since it didn't mention sour but it was super duper sweet :(. Apparently this pizookie dessert is a big deal... it's like a cookie with ice cream on top... meh."
Brittney C.,"Land O Lakes, FL",25,145,44,4.0,10/3/2016,"BJ's Brewhouse is probably one of the most consistently delicious chains I have ever been to. This location is great as well! The drinks are fabulous, the food is better than your average grill and bar, and the service is decent. The menu is huge, and the bar is beautiful,  so everyone you are with is bound to find something they enjoy. The salads are super fresh and gigantic. I also loved that they have a gluten free pizza option for those of us who need it.  If you're in the area and want a good, quality meal - this BJ's is a good choice!"
Sean M.,"Jacksonville, FL",206,471,234,5.0,1/29/2016,"My first time at this location and a home run all around. Seated immediately by a nice hostess and then our waitress Heather was awesome. Friendly, attentive funny and just darned cool too. I love the pesto chicken sandwich lunch combo. It's affordable and you get fries and a salad too. What's not to like? My wife loves the personal pizza. I love their sauce, it's delicious. This location was great, the place was clean and if I was I the area again I'd certainly come back."
Paul L.,"Longwood, FL",258,421,894,2.0,7/14/2016,"Friends of ours from out of town suggested meeting up with their kids at a BJs, which left me wondering why we'd be eating at the food-vending place of a wholesale club.  Call me cloistered, but there being no @BJsRestaurants and brewhouse around us, I hadn't heard of them.  So we didn't even check out the reviews on Yelp before hand.  But when we arrived ahead of them, and we were left to sit in the waiting area (it's their 'policy'), we had a chance to look in @Yelp. Uh-oh! I hate giving bad reviews, I really do.  If nothing else, it indicates I had a bad experience (duh!), and nobody likes THAT. But as sharp a pen/tongue as I possess, I enjoy giving compliments so much more. So I thought: may be the RECENT reviews were better?  No such luck - recent 4 months has a lower avg than any other 4-month period.  I mean, when the '1's outnumber the '5's, it tells you something. Still, I was determined not to be biased by that.  Each experience is different, right?   Alas - the slow forgetful service was evident right away.  We were a big table of 9 - hard to miss.  But it was not till at least 10 minutes after we were all seated that the waiter, with stuff in his hands, came to us and said, haven't forgotten about you - gonna put these down and come right over.  When another few minutes had passed, I looked for him, and observed him going to EVERY one of the other 4 or 5 tables he had, going to the kitchen, to the station etc., BEFORE he came back over (and not till after some unseemly arm-waving to get his attention).  The ladies tried a couple of sample beers, but he never bothered to come back to get the 'real' order until much later and after much pleading. When he brought the water, he was one short; without prompting, he said, ""I'll bring that other water after I take your order..."" and then, those famous 'last' words, ""I WON'T FORGET!""  I don't need to tell you what happened...   The spinach dip came with very few chips; not his fault, but since we couldn't get his attention, we ended up having to flag down another person to get more chips, brought only after the dip's gone cold.  No one came to ask how everything was after the entrees were brought, or else we would have informed him that one of the pizza orders was wrong: ""Pepperoni"", instead of ""cheese"".  Now to be fair, that is totally understandable since they sound so similar - I mean, you can say ""pepperoni"" before taking a picture, and it'll have the same effect!   Thankfully, the food was not all bad - having read that one review, and seen the picture, having no fried breaded rock posing as a french fry is always a blessing.  The mahi mahi shrimp dish and my wife's chicken spinach and quinoa dinner were by not out-of-this-world-write-home-NOW delicious, but they by themselves would have earned a 3-star rating. Not bad for value either - better value than the ""best beginnings"" app at $18.75 or the spin dip at (9.95).  Credit to the waiter for letting 'reminding' us there's a dupe, in that the spin dip is also in the best beginnings (which I knew).  The artichoke used in the spin dip was unusually fibrous, and the buffalo sauce with the chicken nuggets was arguably too salty, but those are minor flaws.  My friend's deep-dish pizza, though, was just between lukewarm and cold - only marginally better after we asked them to warm it up and it was brought back too soon.  As Christians, we had a nice chuckle amongst ourselves about how we don't care for Laodicean cuisine! They had me sign up for their rewards program while we were waiting.  I didn't bother pulling the card out when I paid."
Shawn B.,"Austin, TX",115,2,,1.0,6/17/2017,The hostess moved us after being seated because she only had 1 server for that area.  We moved and waited over 15 minutes and still did not get any service.  Once we did did someone to help us out desserts came out about 15 minutes apart.  Who likes to eat alone?
