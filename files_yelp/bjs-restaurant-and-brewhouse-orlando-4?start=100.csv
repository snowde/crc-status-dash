Tiffani D.,"Winter Park, FL",0,10,,1.0,1/15/2016,"I love BJ's but this was an awful experience. Our server greeted us after maybe five minutes of sitting there, but he seemed promising and attentative. After he took our food orders and then our drink orders, we really didn't see much of him again. Our drinks took forever to come and my beer glass actually broke while I was drinking it. My porter/cider fusion got all over our booth and my white shirt. The server came and cleaned it up (roughly) but we just moved ourselves to another booth. In the end, we had to pay for the beer and didn't receive any discount, manager apology, or anything. I don't know how often I'll return to this specific location."
Yergan J.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/5/2016,Took 15 min to be greeted after being seated. Took another 10 min to get water. Don't understand why when the Resturant was not crowded. This was my second visit this week giving them another chance . Quite disappointing. I brought my entire crew to eat (7) and everyone felt the same way. Service was awful both times. BJ's needs some serious help if they plan to survive.
Mel B.,"Orlando, FL",1,4,,1.0,2/13/2015,"Never ever! I went here tonight expecting to have an awesome meal and service. I got everything but that. The food was decent but the service, ha not even worthy of a star. The girl that we had the ""pleasure"" of dealing with was beyond rude. Just save your time and go somewhere else."
Courtney M.,"Orlando, FL",9,24,10,1.0,6/17/2015,"Although I love BJs food and atmosphere, my boyrfriend and I had a horrible experience here recently and I thought I'd let ya'll know about it. Rather than recant everything, I'm just going to post the letter I sent in to BJs customer service.  ""Dear BJs, After a recent visit to your location in Orlando, Fl, I felt the need to give a little feedback and constructive criticism.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner around seven o'clock and the restaurant was packed! We were excited because obviously a packed restaurant means good food. When we approached the host stand we were informed that the wait was nearing an hour, but since we were already there it seemed a waste to leave and dine somewhere else. During our wait we sat at the bar and enjoyed three rounds of cocktails recommended by the bar tender, and they were delicious and refreshingly strong! After our wait we were seated and told a server would be with us soon. Normally I wouldn't mind waiting for our waitress to attend to our table (I also wait tables so I know how it can be when the restaurant is busy) but forty five minutes after we had been seated I decided to pop by the host stand to see if everything was okay. The host sincerely apologized and told me she'd find my server and send her our way. It was apparent that the server did not know we were seated or that we were her responsibility, but the miscommunication still occurred.  She happily took our order and brought our drinks super quick, and I was grateful that she put in the effort to make up for the wait. Our food was brought out not long after and although my boyfriend was happy with his meal, sadly I wasn't. I've been to BJs many times before (in the location in Palm Beach, my hometown) and without fail I always order kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad. It is literally my favorite salad in the world, and when I don't have time to stop by my local BJs to pick one up I try to make it at home, but it's never as good. Our waitress asked if everything was okay with our food, and although I hate to be ""that customer,"" I asked if she could ask the kitchen what went wrong because the salad was missing the best part, the Brussels sprouts and blueberries! A quick trip to the kitchen and back confirmed that the kitchen was actually out of those items. Of course I was upset because my favorite salad wasn't complete without those ingredients, but I didn't mind reordering because I love all the food on the menu. However I was upset that I wasn't informed of the ingredient outage before I placed my order. Disappointed as I was I reordered and enjoyed my meal and date.  When the bill came and my boyfriend pulled out his wallet to pay I noticed that the charge for the salad was still on there. While only a minor mistake, no fault of our sweet waitress, it was slightly annoying that had I not noticed the charge I would have paid for a salad that I did not eat, no less enjoy. Also, it seemed odd that after many miscommunications within the restaurant that led to a poor experience for my boyfriend and I that the manager didn't make time to come by and apologize. It only takes a minute to stop by a customers table, but as a guest it means a lot for a manager to recognize and apologize for the restaurants mistakes. As much as I love the food (I mean really that salad is so good), I don't know how quick I would be to return to the BJs near me. It just seemed that our almost hundred dollar bill was not indicative of the service or food quality. Hopefully after receiving this letter some changes will be made and I can go back to BJs to enjoy my favorite salad and the amazing cocktails. Much love,  Courtney McGowan"" After sending this letter I received a phone call directly from the manager at this location, his name is Cedric, and I really appreciated that. He assured me that he would make up for this experience and even invited me back so we could be introduced. I was excited to go back and meet the manager, as well as have a do over for our meal. A few days later I got an email for a twenty dollar gift card to BJs. I've never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I was almost offended. Considering how much I spent on my last trip to BJs and how bad the evening turned out to be, I don't really think twenty dollars did much to make up for it, and if I truly wanted a redo of that night I would have to spend another eighty dollars. I'm sorry to say that I probably won't even be bothered to use the card because it would only cover one round of drinks and I'd still be left with the terrible service. My recommendation to all is to save your money because the service is almost guaranteed to be sub par, and being more concerned with money than customer satisfaction, BJs wont do much to make up for it."
Angelo K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,2,3.0,10/14/2014,"When entered from main door hostess acted that I wasn't there. Waiter asked if I was 1, got the yes and handed the menus and pointed the way....  Close to closing time, everyone tired.... No excuse for making me feel like I am in the way.... Food was nice, has a chicken Caesar salad... And a beer. Can say much but I ate it all.... ;-)"
Veronica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,8,5.0,4/22/2015,This place was great Bob was amazing we even made up a song about him because he was on top of the drinks as soon as anything ran low on our table. The food was great and the drinks were nice. The location was clean and we will definitely return.
Cory S.,"Yarmouth, MA",109,3,,4.0,11/29/2015,"We waited at the entrance for a while before getting recognized; otherwise, I would have given 5 stars. But the food was excellent and Heather, our waitress, was awesome."
Natasha H.,"Orlando, FL",0,15,58,1.0,3/31/2015,Service and food were horrible here. Me and my boyfriend stopped in for lunch and I ordered a chicken ceaser salad and it was Luke warm and soggy. Server NEVER stopped by and checked on us except to drop off the check.I didn't  complain there because I'm a server and I don't like to. Maybe it was an off day but still no excuse for crappy service. I will never eat there again.
Nisha J.,"Winter Garden, FL",125,36,61,2.0,5/22/2014,"Been here a few times, the service was good but they made lots of mistakes with our order. The waitress also told us they don't have thin crust but it's on the menu. She said their oven doesn't have what's needed to make thin crust. Not sure if we will give this location another try."
Omar R.,"Orlando, FL",55,2,,5.0,10/28/2015,"Amazing food and experience! One of the managers, David, was extremely gracious and hospitable and really made me and my family feet at home. Bar made us a great drink - ""jalapeno margarita"" that was just amazing. Highly recommend!! See Olivia at the bar- eye candy that makes some great drinks as well!! Will return when back in Orlando"
Nashadyr S.,"Winter Garden, FL",1,16,6,1.0,10/20/2015,"the food here is good, but then everything else that surrounds this restaurant is a absolute no!! the servers are rude and unprofessional, the managers have little understanding of what costumer service is, i have had 2 incidents already you might think ok lets give this place another try but when you go back the same thing happens again i'am never going to go back to this one bi's, i would always go to the bar and it was nice there, but when it comes to the dining room you'd prefer not spending your money here, i'm not going back even to the bar EVER! I recommend you people to go to the one by Millennia i have only been there once but service is better."
Deborah W.,"Orlando, FL",2,11,,4.0,7/12/2014,"First parking is a little strange. You can walk between it and the restaurant next to by the service entrances. The main entrance is along a sidewalk right on International Drive. This is the only downside for us.  Our waiter, Martin, was fabulous. He was very attentive and knowledgable of the menu and drink menu.  Our son is allergic to soy, Martin made sure that not only his meal did not have soy but checked to see if any of our food did as well, in case we wanted to share.  Our son also received a red napkin(for children)which did not contain a knife.  The atmosphere was spot on, very clean and modern.  I highly recommend them!  My husband enjoys this chain because as a veteran on Veteran's day you can select anything on the menu and it's free."
Tyson M.,"Gainesville, FL",0,4,,1.0,10/3/2015,"Slow as hell, food cold, beers took forever.  No compensation for a truly long wait and sub par service."
Karma V.,"Orlando, FL",5,7,,2.0,6/29/2015,"Management could learn better people skills. Food is good. Liked the beer variety and decent happy hour. Was a little stingy though. Any other BJ brew house will give you full portions of the happy hour menu for a happy hour price. Service is ok. The bar staff seems to be lacking, they don't seem confident or prideful in their work. I can't say I'll never come back but I won't be back soon... At least not to this location."
Amanda W.,"Windermere, FL",4,14,8,5.0,4/18/2015,"Good service, good food. We had just left a restaurant without eating for the poor service and decided to come down the road to Bjs. It was a good choice. Our waitress was super friendly and on point with service. They accidentally had a mishap with the pizza I ordered but still made a new one promptly and brought out a few slices to eat while they remade a new one. Frito nachos were very good as well."
Lynn L.,"Orange Park, FL",1,3,,4.0,7/31/2015,Great fried artichokes and burgers. Recommend sampler for beer too. $8 for 4 5oz glasses. Mix and match
SteveErics S.,"Orlando, FL",452,23,8,2.0,7/28/2015,Horrible service. Salty food. Salad at the location is sloppy. No one is friendly (unlike other locations). Never again.
Larry F.,"Oviedo, FL",18,53,5,4.0,3/14/2015,"Top Sirloin Steak was tender and came medium as requested, however it was way over seasoned, and I'm a normally too heavy on salt myself, but this bad. it rest of meal was okay, but main item was the steak and I couldn't enjoy it at all, I got the white cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus --both were done perfectly.  Tried some of my wife's cherry chipotle salmon ---wow that was cooked to perfection!  Decent prices, we will return, but please go easy on steak seasoning."
Brian J.,"Fort Worth, TX",185,473,344,3.0,1/18/2016,"One slow, painful trip down I-Drive and you will soon realize that the typical Orlando tourist is either 1) A foreigner who thinks chain mid grade restaurants are part of the American experience 2) A stateside tourist who has a spouse and kids so unadventurous that they can't handle anything with a local or exotic flavor or 3) Business people in town for a tradeshow who can't agree on what they want to eat so they just feed at the closest hog trough they can find.  My co-workers clearly fell into category 3, so we ended up here.  Despite being painfully boring and trite, BJ's does have a large menu and plenty of choices.  Service here was slow and awkward as apparently they were understaffed.  The bartender who was working the dining room was friendly, and the manager was apologetic when he came by.  Food was good, nothing amazing and one of our 5 orders was done incorrectly, but overall a quick, convenient place to grab dinner."
Rach M.,"Slidell, LA",1,10,2,3.0,8/7/2015,"6 of us dining for lunch. Place was not packed and service was very slow. We ordered soups and salads so not sure why such slow service... Food tasted fine once we got it. Servers were friendly. But the were out of their "" homemade cream soda"" ???"
