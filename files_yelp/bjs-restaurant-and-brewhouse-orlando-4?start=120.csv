Saleeta T.,"Madison, AL",17,18,1,4.0,3/29/2015,The waiter was friendly and the wait was scent for a large party on a Saturday night. The kids menu was great. My son was excited about his mini corn dogs and I was excited that the corn dogs were made of turkey instead of beef! The kids fruit cup had seasonal fruit that was naturally sweet! The pesto pizza was great as well.
Frank F.,"Savannah, GA",69,125,2535,5.0,11/1/2014,1st time dining here. SUPERB! I think to myself. . . How many Fav's can a gal have. Lol. I did see that they offer a Bison Burger. I was tempted to order it. I did order a Gluten Free Pizza and I built and personalized it. My choices were: Calamota Olives. Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Italian Sausage and Mushrooms. My husband ordered  BBQ Chicken Pizza. Our appetizer was Corn Fritters w/ Bacon Aoli. Awesome. You get 4 of them for I believe $3.50-$3.75. Oooh and the Gluten Free pizza comes in 10 in.  Plus the extra toppings for it is only $1.00. There regular pizza dough sizes and prices are different. The gluten free dough is thin crust. But not thin like New York Style. It's just right. I enjoyed my choice in gluten free crust and toppings as well. The other sizes are 6in. 9in. 12in. 15in. I believe the last two are correct. And the topping prices are more. Check them out Over and Out.  FranknKimm
Leeanne P.,"Orlando, FL",1,3,3,3.0,6/1/2014,"The location is still very new,  you can tell by the scent of the restaurant itself and the menus (new plastic smell).  Our waitor was a pushy on trying to sell new dishes and acting confident that he knew what we wanted and practically attempted to order for us. Aside from the irritating and persistently pushy waitor, we ordered the southwest eggrolls; they were delicious I definitely recommend trying them. Cesar salad was average and the pasta was too. Nothing special from any other pasta resturaunt. The dessert we chose was one of the pizookies (cookie baked in a small pan and brought out with topped ice cream) white macadamia;   the best part of the entire meal. Itll leave you wanting more."
Michael W.,"Shrewsbury, MA",80,302,20,3.0,4/19/2015,"Got into Orlando (blechhhh!!!) late last Thursday for a wedding and looked for some place to have dinner with the family that was not your typical Orlando faux restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised, the pizza was good, my kale and Brussels sprout salad was very good and the drinks were also very good, service was excellent. This place warrants a 4 star for Orlando! Did I mention that I HATE Orlando?"
Jan M.,"Manhattan, NY",25,43,391,5.0,4/10/2015,Bar staff is awesome...had dinner here tonight and have only compliments.  Great environment and attentive bartenders!
Gary P.,"Toms River, NJ",7,9,2,5.0,4/9/2015,"Great dinner tonight! Food was great, and the service was excellent! Would definitely return when coming back to Orlando!"
George O.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,32,2,1.0,9/13/2014,"Horrible service and food for lunch.  Came in for a quick lunch and an hour and a half later, had cold food and non caring service.  Server and manager stayed clear while we waited forever.  Won't make the mistake of spending money at BJs."
Lisa G.,"Orlando, FL",211,132,406,1.0,10/29/2014,"Let me start by saying that I really like BJ's...especially their yummy Pumpkin Ale.  I have been to many around the Orlando area, however, this paricular BJ's is just terrible.  I have been three times, since its close to where I live, and walked out twice.  I should have learned my lesson after the second time but each time the manager begged for another chance.  Well, three is it!  The service is non-existent...each time after being seated, it took 8-10 minutes for someone to come to the table.  The wrong food was brought to the table on one visit.  On another visit, our server forgot to put our order in even though the place was empty.  Each visit, we were told ""the bar is backed up""...again, the place was empty! The one time I stayed, my food was cold.  If the manager knows this place is in bad shape, why haven't these issues been resolved?  The last time I walked out, we headed over to Longhorn Steakhouse where the service was great...we got extra special attention because we told them about our BJ's experience ... They hear this a lot!  So, this particular BJ's has a bad reputation.  I won't be back!"
Karen M.,"Dundee Township, IL",2,71,,1.0,11/28/2015,"Not good.   Nice decor, huge beer selection but the rest is meh.   My old fashioned was watered down  and not properly.  Our calamari appetizer not only took forever, it was overdone.  $25 for a crappy appetizer, and old fashioned and a beer.   We left and went to Coopers Hawk for a much better experience."
Susan S.,"Hummelstown, PA",0,7,,3.0,5/4/2015,Beer was good but food not as good as other BJs we've been to. Had to send my meal because it wasn't what was in the menu - took forever to get a replacement. But it was good when it came!
Ellie L.,"Gresham, OR",13,122,15,2.0,12/25/2015,"The bartender did the best she could to keep up, front hosted are seemed to care less about helping anyone. Food was mediocre at best. The BJ's in Oregon and San Diego have been great experiences."
Cailen L.,"Orlando, FL",3,17,5,2.0,9/17/2014,"I've been to many BJ's around the area. I was given an opportunity to experience this new BJ's' soft open for friends and family. The service was wonderful and the server and trainers were funny and engaging. And the food was great. Since then, I have gone there four other times. All I can say is, it's time for new management. Progressively, the quality has gone down. Everything from the salt and pepper shakers showing clear signs of never having been washed or changed out (the salt inside the salt shakers inside the restaurant was BROWN, to the ketchup showing clear signs of never having been wiped (we came in right at 11am and the ketchup bottle was caked with dried ketchup not once but twice when I was here for lunch), this restaurant shows very clearly that this BJ's has NO cleaning standards.  The service? Meh. It's a mixed bag. There are some great ones, but they are probably moving on to better restaurants by now. And all that is left are the crappy ones who just can't manage tables. The most recent time I was there, we waited 15 minutes to be initially greeted outside for lunch (the place had maybe 2 or 3 other tables in it at the time). I was told that a server would be right out and she was taking my drink order, then the drinks came back with another server and I was told that someone else was going to actually be taking care of me. Well, this server had waited on us before. The server is EXTREMELY slow at service and seems very inefficient at best for this kind of job. I must say though that there are a few great servers in that restaurant who actually have a personality that is engaging and also knowledgeable and I would suggest specifically asking for a server who is fun and experienced at the host stand to avoid my experiences.  Management: Also, one thing I have no seen since soft opening was an actual floor manager. I'm not sure they even have one. Never once has anyone come to my table and asked how things were. They must just really not give a care in the world about how their restaurant is seen. Because I would've had a lot to say. The food: Eh, it's burgers and the standard BJ fare. It's ok. Nothing superb, but nothing to really complain about either. I don't usually send food back anyways, and I never have here. This BJ's is at the time of this writing the newest BJ's in the Orlando area, but from my experience it is the worst kept and run. They need to seriously rethink their cleanliness, their efficiency, and their communication if they ever want me to come back. Head on over to Chuy's right next door is you actually want a good meal."
Bill F.,"Orlando, FL",185,8,19,2.0,1/20/2015,I was disappointed. It took a long time to get food. Salad was dry and warm. Soup was luke warm and the server said they ran out of crackers. Beverage glass was empty for a good 10 minutes and I had to ask for a refill.  I love BJs but not this location. Go to the one across from Millenia Mall. Better service and they act like they want you to return. This BJs is in the heart of a tourist area and they probably don't care if you return.
Leysi S.,"Brickell, Miami, FL",0,4,1,1.0,1/2/2015,"The only reason I am giving this restaurant a star is because of the nice waitress who tried to save the day. Upon sitting at our table, we waited for over 20 minutes for service. No silverware provided until seven minutes after receiving our appetizers. Once received, we were given plastic spoons. In all fairness, it was New Year's Day and the restaurant was understaff, the food was good but took too long and management did not come by to check on us. Not a good dining experience."
Tana M.,"Port St Lucie, FL",87,3,,5.0,8/8/2014,"I've been to this location three times but my last trip was by far the best experience! Our waiter was Steven and dining out as frequent as I do it was a delight to have a waiter who wasn't like the norm and had interesting things to talk about. I had a few friends with me who never dined at BJ's so he made several suggestions based upon other guest feedback on items, suggested we sample the beer before we committed which I felt was such an honest thing to do and he got the order RIGHT! My friends are pains and we included this, took off that, substituted all kinds of stuff we were sure something was going to be missing but it was PERFECT! The Berryburst beer Steven recommended was delicious and the Parmesan chicken was sooooooo good! I will definitely be back again soon!"
Anna S.,"Atlanta, GA",23,106,98,3.0,9/16/2014,"Generally loves BJ's. Nice because this location serves food until midnight.  Perfect for those of us who aren't ready for bed at 9pm lol. Ordered the sliced prime rib sandwich. Delicious steak, but could've been warmer. Had a major incident with concern to a cleanliness issue that I simply could not let slide because it could've infected several people,  but I'm not going to detail it. I simply told the server my issue & nicely asked it to be addressed.  The reply was ""yes ma'am"" - with a genuine tone of care, not impolite at all. I wasn't made to feel uncomfortable & I appreciated that."
Naser A.,"Addison, TX",459,209,483,2.0,7/23/2015,"Why is this Bj's so horrible. told us to wait cause table not ready, then another person comes and tell us its ready. once we go to the table it was not ready, or even wiped off. so we go back to waiting area. then 3 minutes later we get seated with coasters places for drinks. so we wait another 10 minutes cause the waiter thought since we had coasters, that someone else came and tok our drink order. Got us the drink order, we placed our order and it took about good 30 minutes to come out with an empty back room were we got seated. One item was missing cause waiter said he thought we only needed one lettuce wrap instead of 2. but every person ordered meal. if order was repeated this wouldnt have happened. Friend with burgers came out cold, and tasted like old oil. we also ordered 2 burgers to go during eating our meals cause we knew they were gonna take a while. the second order of lettuce wrap came out after everyone else was done eating. At this point we asked for the manager and he tried to fix things, got us fresh hot fries, and also comped the 2 burgers TOGO. One star for good management, 2 stars for the server who was nice until the end of his service. I think the staff needs more training especially or a location like this."
Anthony B.,"Orlando, FL",273,12,5,5.0,8/29/2014,"Laura made the experience! She was one of the best waitresses I've had. Her energy, knowledge about the menu, and personality is one to be around!"
Gregga V.,"Orlando, FL",23,16,25,2.0,8/13/2015,Food was average nothing spectacular.   The service was was extremely slow.   We did receive apologies but it would have been resolved but he continued not to help us in a timely manner.
Victor W.,"Washington Park, Providence, RI",0,21,3,4.0,10/29/2014,"Went here with my family, 2nd one I've been too. This one was a little off, food was great and atmosphere still the same but service was off. It took 15 minutes to get drinks, the root beer was phenomenal and the stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes were great. Just needed to work on the service. Food-5/5 atmosphere-5/5 service -3/5"
