Ellen M.,"Reno, NV",0,21,5,2.0,8/3/2015,"We went on a rainy Saturday night in high tourist season.  We called ahead for our party of 5 at about 8:30 pm and probably waited ten minutes more when we got there, which wasn't bad.  Food was typical BJs which we like, but service was very slow.  Never got drink refills and food took so long we thought they had lost our order.  We wanted dessert but didn't order due to delays.  Waitress dropped a glass at the next table and seemed put out to be cleaning up the broken glass.  Service ruined the experience for us."
Dave W.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",8,22,26,2.0,3/20/2016,"Had the chowder, and the chicken gyro's. Food was excellent. Service was awful as waitress lost our orders and never even put then in for an hour (was too busy hanging out with her friends or family up by bar who wasn't eating but was drinking) however when food arrived 2 hrs after arrival it was excellent and management comped everything but alcohol which was more than fair. Not sure if I would recommend or not. Good management intervention and meal but poor service. Overall in reading the other reviews I would say the ones that said their Service was poor are probably pretty consistent but the ones that wrote their Service was great are probably plants because there was a lot of open tables and a lot of people waiting to get seated... clearly some of the waitresses do an excellent job there but overall I would say their service needs a tune-up which is odd because the manager seemed pretty squared away and the food was good... the atmosphere is great...they just need to do something about the weak links that are bringing their service down. That said the waitress we had was very polite though clearly very distracted by things other than work as can be evidence in losing the order for over an hour before she realizes she hadn't put it in.... kind of of conflicting review I realize. Sorry about that I guess in short if you're willing to gamble on the service the food and atmosphere are worth it..but just hope for a good waitress and if you clearly don't get one then cut your losses and leave early"
Kalynne M.,"Ormond Highlands, FL",59,191,25,4.0,4/11/2015,"We had dinner here for my son's 9th birthday. He ate all of his spaghetti!!! I have never seen him clean his plate like that before;) We ordered the calamari (good), bacon mac n cheese (awesome) and spinach stuffed mushrooms (great.) Our waitress was very nice and honest. I was in between the steak or country fried chicken. I asked her what she prefers and she mentioned that the steaks often come out of the kitchen over cooked 50%  of the time. So based on that I ordered the chicken. And I'm glad I did!!! The gravy over the chicken and mashed potatoes was awesome! My husband however forgo her advice and ordered a ribeye, which came out over cooked. By the time  another ribeye came back mid rare, our son had finished his birthday ice cream cookie. I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the kitchen has some work to do:( the place was half empty and there is no excuse for over cooking a steak. Hopefully they'll get their act in gear. Beautiful decor and tasty beer!"
Nic G.,"Orange, TX",0,1,,5.0,6/5/2015,Amazing food. Amazing beer and ciders. Amazing service. My favorite Resturant I've ever been to. I'll travel here from Chicago 6 times over to eat here. Brett is seriously an awesome server.
edwin s.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,1.0,9/1/2014,Had to wait 50 minutes for 2 salads at lunch. Was told that it took a while to prepare tuna. The tuna was rare as ordered. Terrible service
Sarah H.,"Orlando, FL",124,215,5,5.0,10/19/2014,"I have always been a fan of BJs. Being someone who is on a Gluten-free diet, I always support restaurants that offer GF options. BJ's even has a dedicated GF menu you can choose from which helps considering the enormous size of their regular menu. I LOVE their gluten free pizookie which is a warm chocolate chip cookie cake with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I do wish they would offer maybe one more option for the pizookies to be gluten free but I am not upset about that considering most restaurants don't offer a single option for dessert for me to enjoy. To this day I have not found a better GF pizza than BJ's. They only offer one size like most other places for GF but it is not disappointing in the least. It is thin crust and most of their toppings are also GF so the sky's the limit, however each topping is going to cost you. I am vegetarian also so the cheese pizza is right up my alley. Will be a lifetime customer so long as they continue offering GF options as amazing as the ones I get to enjoy."
Lee S.,"Lake Alfred, FL",1,18,3,1.0,2/17/2015,"We have eaten here twice never again ordered a burger it came almost to quick looked ok I bit into it and had to spit it out the burger was stone cold and almost completely raw was red and blood on the bun and plate I called over the waiter and even he looked horrified he took it away in the meantime my wife had her food and was waiting for mine to be served her flatbread was cold and tasted bad the waiter returned with my new burger it was over done I'm not to fussy but felt like there did it on purpose I didn't eat it I complained to the manager who didn't seem to interested he offered us a free desert voucher we left and gave the voucher away will never return, there are far more places to eat a million times better than here"
Aimee M.,"Orlando, FL",0,15,,1.0,2/13/2015,"We met some friends here for dinner thinking it would be similar to the other locations. ...it wasn't!   Service was terrible, one person had the wrong meal served twice and was offered a cookie for.the trouble. Drinks were slow and the server blamed the bar, the manager blamed the server...so basically no one knew what.they were doing.  Don't waste time here,  go Vineland location."
Priyanka P.,"Richmond, VA",1,8,5,2.0,12/24/2014,Food was great but service was worse! 2 hour. Ended up canceling dessert and extra side. Not sure if it was the waiter who was slow or if the management issues. It was really disappointing!
Od's M.,"Bradenton, FL",1,30,4,1.0,12/9/2014,Lousy service and overpriced food! Beware of the nasty host - hates kids. Not a good choice for any meal!
Chad G.,"Toronto, Canada",1,16,,2.0,2/16/2015,Really bummed to write this review.  We love bjs and to be honest the visit there was great until we got our pizza home and had it the next day.  My wife took a bite only to find a hard piece of something in there under the cheese.  Scary yes! she was okay just a little freaked out.  We contacted the restaurant and they were quick to get back with an apology.  I work in the service industry and I understand things happen but when we didn't want to go forward with filling out an incident report (I am not suing or anything-accidents happen) we were forgotten.  No follow up email nothing.  Feel like since I was so pissed we got brushed off..not cool
Amber A.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,8,20,4.0,7/4/2014,"Had a great dinner. Food was excellent, the service was very attentive. Made my vacation in Orlando unforgettable."
Kirk P.,"Holly Hill, FL",0,1,,2.0,8/6/2014,"went for lunch took 15 min. to get soup and salad. was not busy,they keep that up they won't. Been to alot of bjs this was the slowest establishment. bartender was great!,"
Trang T.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",0,12,,2.0,6/19/2014,"The food is always great at Bjs, no complaints with that.. but on the other hand, the service did not match the food. I went with a party of 3 people, and we seemed to be more friendly than our server. We ordered some happy hour appetizers, and the server end up charging us full price. It was just a new location we wanted to try out, but 1 time experience was good enough."
