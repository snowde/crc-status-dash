Mike K.,"Orlando, FL",135,4,,4.0,2/24/2017,Place is great for food and dessert. Only drawback is the price of beers. $4.50 for a bud light and $6 for an ipa
Joyce L.,"Celebration, FL",197,112,138,5.0,1/29/2017,This place is always busy being in the middle of I-drive so use the app to make a reservation! The Brussel sprouts appetizer is really good everyone will eat it. Large menu selection and don't forget to get the pazookie
Jose D.,"Cicero, IL",4,12,37,5.0,11/5/2016,If your a beer lover this is your new favorite spot. They have their own take on your typical beer with a kick love the stout has a hell of a kick and has a great malty taste and the avocado egg rolls are amazing. I am a man that loves burgers and an ice cold beer and this place has some of the best burgers around perfectly cooked to your taste. You know their great when you don't have to put ketchup on it.
Tatyana S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,3,2,1.0,1/28/2017,"My husband and I were trying to place an order for pick up tonight. After calling 3 times and nobody picked up the phone, on the fourth time someone did. He said he wanted to place the order and the hostesses put him on hold for s while. Then she picked up the phone again he my husband said the same thing, and she put him on hold again. By the 3rd time, and 20 minutes later, the same person said that the one responsible for the take outs was busy and she would transfer him as soon as she was available. Really?! After 20 min?! We just hang up. Not worth the wait."
Tanya B.,"Homestead, FL",35,44,25,4.0,3/19/2016,"Kelsey was an amazing waitress. Very informative. Had the ribeye with a loaded baked potato. Wasn't seasoned at all. Only the grill char. I'm not a salt user and I had to use salt and pepper. Having a Bazookie. So excited to try. 4 stars are due to my love for BJ's Brewhouse and the fact that Kelsey was great.  On another note, will let them know about the bathroom floor being dirty/stucky. Not a very pleasant experience."
Cal H.,"Oswego, IL",4,42,6,5.0,8/31/2016,"Stopped in for dinner while in town for work. Great craft beers on tap, solid variety. Also expansive bar menu of the familiar beer and liquor choices.  Food options are plentiful! Can find something great for just about any taste you might have. Our group ordered a variety of items and all of them were well presented and tasty.  Ambiance is casual to slightly above. Still a good mix of families, couples, and groups such as ours. Great service, overall a very nice experience."
AJ K.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,3.0,10/4/2016,"Never been a big fan of this in the past, but I've given the newest Orlando one a try.  Had the Oktoberfest seasonal draft as my drink of choice. Was pretty middle of the road for that style. For starters, I had the chips and salsa. The chips were well salted and not overly greasy. The salsa was on the sweeter side, but still very delectable. And you can never beat unlimited refills :) I chose the fire roasted barbacoa seasoned chicken which exceeded my expectations. It was light and juicy and the spice was quite subtle (I don't do spice well.) It was served over a bed of brown rice and black beans, neither were particularly of note.  Overall, I was impressed by how this visit compared to previous ones. It was a good average american place to grab a bite amongst the wasteland of I-Drive."
Cipriano M.,"Orlando, FL",193,680,4132,1.0,4/23/2016,"As a fan of BJ's Restaurant, I love their menu and know we will be provided with excellent service. So I thought during this visit. My friends and I ate here for dinner before doing an escape room. It was early evening, so there was no one in the restaurant basically. We were sat in a timely manner and everything went smooth here. We looked over the menus and was trying to decide on what we wanted.  Time goes by and no service yet. We thought it was ok for now because we could look over the menu for more time. Well about  minutes later, the server finally comes by for our drink order. We sat long enough and ordered our meals as well. We were thirsty, so we needed refills, Well that took a long time as well. The food finally arrived and I was not impressed at with the appearance of my dish. I ordered the deep dish ravioli. It looked as if it was dried out in that sauce with melted cheese on top. For $18, it was not good at all. I should have ordered the chicken dinner with veggies at a cheaper price. The flavor was lacking and it was more sauce then pasta.  Thankfully we didn't order desert because I was just disappointed with this BJ's. Reading the other Yelp reviews on this restaurant location reflects my negative visit as well. Slow service and awful food taste here. This was one of the waste BJ's yet in my book.  I would not recommend dining here because other Yelpers are having issues here and it seems this location needs improvement."
Tony S.,"Winter Garden, FL",69,13,,5.0,5/6/2016,"Service was on point! Waitress was awesome! Outdoor seating is pleasant. Do yourself a favor and order the pizza and beer and you wont be let down! Nina was our server and she went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience. Nina was friendly, attentive and overall one of the best servers I have ever had! Nina alone had made this trip so wonderful, my wife and I will be making this location our primary over Millenia"
Sarita E.,"Miami, FL",66,2,2,1.0,4/5/2016,"Very very upset! Went to celebrate my 6 year old's birthday this past March 25. My oldest ordered a burger and wedge fries. Attached to a wedge fry was a ROCK, that had been breaded. Manager came, we filed a report. Ended up paying the bill, to avoid ruining my little one's day. Only got compensated for my son's meal. Received a message a few days later stating they were checking if we were ok. I responded to the message with a ""call me back"" and have yet to speak to someone- it's been over a week. No ""we're sorry,"" or ""we are looking into what happened"" NOTHING! I just don't understand how this made it past their supplier and cooks?! So upset, I don't think I'll step foot in another BJs again. (Pictures posted)"
Devon R.,"Hamilton, Canada",10,56,1,5.0,2/25/2017,Had a really great experience last night. We have been to this location before and usually service sucks! We keep going back because the pizza. This time though we had great experience from the server that started us to the runner to the main server. Everything was great. Only complaint is they never do bathroom checks and there is always a mess. Other than that great visit.
Karen P.,"Orlando, FL",117,67,71,3.0,3/19/2016,"Waiting for an hour to get my meal, I didn't get anything fancy just chicken and rice.  I didn't order any appetizer and just had some water to drink.  This place is not even packed.  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the manager came to my table to apologize."
David M.,"South Side, Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,3/24/2017,Bad service it took a long time to get our food. The sad thing is that the Restraunt wasn't that busy. Now for the food cool to warm. When you see customers wrong you that get their food Frist and we sat down about a half hour. Won't eat here again.
Kim B.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",30,2,,5.0,1/14/2017,Wonderful service for our party of 26!  They definitely can handle large groups as we were one of many from the MLK volleyball tournament.  Ahi tuna was great and nice wines.
Raquel C.,"Orlando, FL",19,15,70,1.0,2/19/2016,"Worst experience I've been through at any restautant. I have been to 4 different BJ'S and they were good but here... the wait, the service, and the food were bad.  We were a group of 6 and we were there celebrating a birthday. It was a saturday night and yes it was busy but not that much for the kind of service we got. I have too many things(bad) to say about this visit to this BJ'S so I'm going to number them: 1. The wait: we were told there was a 45 min wait to get a table and we're seated an hour and a half later. The wait to get our food was 45 minutes. 2. The service: First let's talk about the drinks. When the drinks got there, the waitress spilled my friend's water, on him (an accident can happen to anyone, but fix it). She said someone would come to clean up the spilled water... no one ever showed up and we ate with a puddle at our feet. The waitress never brought back the water she spilled, my friend had to get up and go to the bar to get a water. She took forever to refill the rest of the drinks, two of my friends had to stop eating at one point to wait for their soda refills. The rest of the service was bad, friend 2 never got a silverware and napkin. Friend 3 and 4 ordered pizza and they got their food 20 minutes after everyone else. Friend 3 never got a plate even though we asked for it, so friend 4 had to share her plate. 3. The food: Now the food, it could have been so much better, like in other BJ's. I had a burger that I ordered medium, it was burnt. Friend 1 had a baked pasta, the picture on the menu looked nothing like what he got. The dish was not even filled half way and it was mostly cheese. Friend 2 ordered a medium well burger and got it raw.  At the end of the night the waitress messed up the receipts twice so she ended up giving me a burger I had ordered to go for free."
Adrie D.,"Orlando, FL",58,135,333,5.0,7/26/2016,"BJ's food is pretty standard and this location is what you would expect from any other BJ's: extensive menu, great food quality, reasonable prices, ...BUT what really had me impressed was the customer service!!! I try not to review big restaurant chains just because there's not much you can say if the restaurant in California would be the exact same thing in Florida... and I'm talking about Cheesecake Factory, TGI Fridays, Olive Garden... etc.  That being said, I really have to give the management team big kuddos because they're doing something right!!! We got here as a party of 6, but right when we got there they were seating a BIG party, I would say probably 20ppl, and the hostess was trying to accommodate us but she knew the servers were busy at the moment; nevertheless, you could see her trying hard to get us seated, so much that when she did the server wasn't totally ready for us but we tried to be as easy of a table as possible for her. Let me go back a little, just to tell you that we parked in the back of the restaurant and I was in crutches dragging myself behind my family, when we were passing the outside patio an employee saw me and opened the back door for me, so that I didn't have to go around to the main entrance.  When our table was ready a young guy was taking us to our big booth when another customer passed by me like in a rush while I could barely walk and the employee actually stood up for me and told him he was trying to take me to the table. I TRULY FELT TAKEN CARE OF, and this is not a standard procedure from any restaurant, that was truly passion for the industry and place of work...that's why I believe management's doing a great job! Our server was on point, accurate, and kind. We tried to make her job as easy as possible and she took great care of us even while she was busy. I truly enjoyed my dining experience here... and the food was just a ""complement"".... the service made it happen!"
Richard F.,"Avon, OH",0,24,4,4.0,11/26/2016,"A friend and I went there during a big game.  It was extremely loud, but that's to be expected.  The food was very good.  The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 was the slow service trying to get drink refills while we were sitting right at the bar.  It was like pulling teeth to get the bartenders' attention."
Jason S.,"New Salisbury, IN",0,17,14,2.0,3/22/2016,Went with family.  Sirloin was tough and flavorless Honey chicken salad was generic Spaghetti and meatballs was not what expected. Small dices of meatball and very little. Too spicy instead of good flavor.  Kids tenders and fries were fine.  Fettuccini was very good.
Danny B.,"Redwood City, CA",2,27,6,3.0,3/22/2016,"As an avid BJ customer in California I was excited to have a familiar restaurant choice while on vacation. I was sorely disappointed! My jambalaya, which is a favorite of mine, was served with non sautéed vegetables & soupy rice. Two other people at our table had salads with poor lettuce quality.  We had to wait 15 minutes at our table before water was even served.  Our meals came out staggered by several minutes.  And at our table we had a meal served on a cracked plate. Repeatedly there were common food service industry standards that happened. It was not a great representation of the chain. David the manager was very respectful of our experience & offered to help make the bill reflect that.  Really hope it's just one night off for this establishment & isn't habitual."
Amy L.,"Las Vegas, NV",140,113,137,3.0,10/16/2015,Service was okay. Our waitress was really nice but she took forever to get to us when we were getting closer to finishing our meal and when it came to check time.  The food wasn't bad. The spinach artichoke dip wasn't all that great. The ahi poke was quite dried and consisted of mainly the dressing underneath it to make it look like there was a lot of poke. Definitely not worth the price.  I had the cherry salmon dish pictured in their menu (forgot what it's called) with couscous and it was bomb. I usually don't eat salmon at restaurants but this was very good. The asparagus was cooked too long because it was hard to bite into.  My sister got a chicken Caesar salad and the other one got the sirloin w steamed broccoli and they all liked it.  We also ordered the mini trio pazookie and was yummy of course!
