Seth F.,"Orlando, FL",5,5,2,3.0,12/7/2014,"My faith has been restored!! The burger is delicious (like one of chef zakarian's 'ugly burgers), the Mediterranean tacos are delightful (the bulgar wheat side dish is fairly spicy so be warned). The GM James came by and made things better after a bit of a slow start.   His follow up was superb as was our meal. Kudos Sir."
George C.,"Anchorage, AK",4,303,31,4.0,1/16/2016,"Tasty, well crafted local brews at a good price.  Free popcorn.   While KSB is a little off the bested path in the Dimond area it is well worth a visit. Very laid back and the price per pint is a welcome break from the pay thru the nose standard of other craft breweries."
Alex B.,"Lake Mary, FL",95,63,42,5.0,8/15/2016,This place always has amazing food and a wide selection of beer. I enjoy attending their beer dinners as well. They are well worth the money for the experience. Would highly recommend this place.
Adam V.,"Mentor, OH",0,6,,5.0,3/15/2017,"We go to this BJs and never get disappointed  . Always great food at great price. Service is always fast and and servers are great. We specifically always ask for Elisa ,she is always so welcoming and one of the best servers. She goes.above and beyond for us and it's always great!!!!!"
Haley W.,"Windermere, FL",2,8,11,5.0,8/6/2016,"If you come here ask for Martin! Best server, we've never had any issues with him and he truly cares about his guest. He really makes your dinner experience 10x better. Also Michelle the hostess is really kind and good at keeping the flow of the restaurant. We've really never had any issues here. We are local and we chose this location over any of the others. It's great, and they are awesome at handling guest conflict. 5 stars...no issues, great food and great service! Maybe it's tourist writing bad reviews maybe not but I don't understand them!"
Derrick B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",27,210,46,4.0,11/12/2015,Great food; had the jambalaya. Great waiter; Mike was it? He was freaking adorable. Attentive and gave recommendations. Price points were good as well.
Michael B.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",64,6,,5.0,8/15/2016,I love this place! The beers are always amazing and always pair so well with the food! Thanks to Cedric for the Green Flash beer dinner it was a great experience.
Sheila R.,"Dearborn, MI",71,1,,5.0,8/21/2016,"Very pleasant experience.   We sat at the bar and ordered 2 flights of their house beers.   I really enjoyed their Harvest Hefeweizen.   I ordered the Ahi Salad, it was delicious.  My husband had a burger which was pretty good as well.  The next time we are in the Orlando area we will come back."
Kurratulayn Y.,"Fultondale, AL",138,1,,1.0,4/22/2016,"Very disappointed in the service here. My husband and I sat at the bar, and we're basically ignored. We had to flag our server, Holly down to place an order. When she took our order, she didn't ask me what I would like to drink. As we waited for my husbands drink order, I flagged Holly down, again, and she said oops, I didn't make my husbands drink. I said, I would like to order a drink also. She stared at me and said what would you like. After I gave my drink order, my husband and I decided to cancel our food order and Just pay for the drinks. She never asked what the problem was, she just walked away. Maybe she's having a roughy night, but it cost the restaurant two entree orders."
Lauren H.,"Jacksonville, FL",49,37,55,3.0,10/24/2014,"Okay drinks, okay food, too. We were visiting from jacksonville, and BJ's was right next to our hotel. I've never visited any BJ's back home, but I may check a few out now. Great drinks specials all day long, also!"
Michelle B.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,2/28/2017,"If I could provide 0 stars I would. We sat for 20 minutes and no one would even take our drink order. There were many open tables and plenty of wait staff, but no one wanted to claim our table. When we finally asked, 2 guys argued over who's it was, at this point we walked out. We have been to BJ's across the country multiple times and this was beyond pathetic."
Cassi B.,"Knoxville, TN",126,306,1071,2.0,6/6/2015,"I really hate to give bad reviews, but our experience last night was bad! The service was REALLY slow, and it took FOREVER to get our food!!  After about 20 mins waiting our waitress finally came to us to say it would be another min (which actually took another 10 mins, total of 30 mins for a sandwich, burger, soup and salad) before we got our food.  They were not super busy, just poor service and slow kitchen= bad experience and that = not going back :("
Chelsea F.,"Orlando, FL",5,6,14,4.0,6/18/2016,"Despite all the negative reviews, I highly enjoy this location. My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times and always bring out of town friends here. The food has always been great, as well as the service. We had Bob in the bar area once and he was awesome. I always like coming to BJ's because of their diverse menu and great beer selection. The cantina chicken pizza is SO good, I get this a lot and sometimes have to make myself not get it so I can try something else. The spinach artichoke dip is also delicious, as well as the mozzarella sticks (and you get a lot). I will keep coming here as long as I live in the area."
Mikaela N.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,,3.0,7/26/2016,"I decided to open a Yelp account now that I visit many restaurants in Orlando along with family and friends. I've been eating at this International Drive location for almost a year now after relocating from Louisiana. I enjoy the Jambalaya (even if it's not exactly like the best back home) and this place isn't far from our apartment. I was a hostess and server years back but to this day, I'm picky when it comes to the staff who will be helping my visits go well. We usually ask to sit in Edie's area because she's on point and knows her stuff. We can't always sit in her area because of long wait times. I noticed things changing these past 2 months there. I don't know if there was a change of management, but things don't seem to run smoothly after 10 at night. They seem shortstaffed later at night even though they supposedly close at midnight. Our visits between 6 and 9 or 10 are enjoyable, but if a group of us show up there after 10, the experience changes and food is usually not up to par maybe because there aren't enough cooks after a certain time. I know the servers don't have anything to do with that because it's management overall who decides if they have enough staff on site or not. I hope these reviews are looked at by management. The reviews for this location are lower than other BJ's restaurants nearby and management should strive to make things run smoother there."
Anabelle C.,"Miami, FL",83,18,52,3.0,7/3/2015,We just had lunch at this new location which was being built last time we visited about 6 months earlier.  It's was empty when we arrived right before the lunch rush.  We were a large party of eight and were quickly seated. Our server was very attentive and made several good recommendations . Unfortunately the kitchen was backed-up and what was a quick lunch took way to long.  Perp who's they are still figuring out the logistics of a new restaurant.
Henry B.,"Suwanee, GA",0,24,7,2.0,8/8/2015,"Definitely not worth it. We had two waiters and the guy that was in charge of our side had no time to pay attention to us. I asked for a sirloin cooked medium well and the sirloin that was served to me was burnt. My waiter did not come back to ask me how was my meal or anything that a regular waiter does. I saw him again at the very end when it was time to pay the bill.  If it wasn't for Kendall (the other waiter) I would have probably asked to speak w the manager. It's a bit pricey as well.  My advice, try another spot."
Jeff C.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,5,3,2.0,6/15/2016,Food took forever with not much of a crowd. When it did come 2 out of 4 dishes were cold. The broccoli side wasn't cooked. Brussels sprouts were so so. Ribs and French Dip were pretty good though.
Tom W.,"Orlando, FL",3,19,18,5.0,9/21/2015,Another great visit. Using the mobile app we got sat right away.  The host acknowledged us as soon as we came in. Iur drinks where awesome.  I had the jambalaya and my friend had salmon.  Really great food tonight.
Victoria S.,"Methuen, MA",2,16,15,2.0,4/2/2016,"Was seated right away. But I'm not even going to go into the long winded story about how terrible our service was at this restaurant. Service 1 star, two stars only because their beer was good. Just know you're going to be waiting entirely too long for your food and half your order is going to be forgotten. Cool ambiance, loved the decor. But service is such a critical part of your restaurant experience, if you can't get that right you're screwed. There are much better restaurants in the Orlando area. Skip."
Dave C.,"Windermere, FL",13,32,2,2.0,1/18/2015,"Worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Bad server  Dirty menus Dirty napkin (lipstick) Bad mojito Order came out wrong Food was good - avocado egg rolls were amazing  Beer was good Location at millennia is much nicer, which is crazy as this is a relatively new restaurant. I like the BJ's chain, but from now on I'll stick with the Millenia location. Too many new and better restaurants opening up on Idrive lately to have to deal with this. ------ Update (10 minutes later): I guess I should have waited until I left to write the review. The bathrooms weren't clean and they messed up on the check (charged twice for one entree)."
