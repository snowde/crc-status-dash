Roxanne W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3,3,1,1.0,6/10/2016,"The meatballs were spongy and mushy. The fettuccine had 3 broccoli florettes in it and very little chicken, about 6 strips. My husband's dinner salad tasted like the greens were rotting. We mentioned this to Our waitress but she didn't care at all! Our waitress, was cold, uncaring and flat out rude once we presented an award for signing up on the BJ's app, which was at her promoting. We were out having a much needed date night and this was an extremely unpleasant way to start it. We will not go back to this location."
David M.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",1,19,3,2.0,4/20/2016,"Think Friday's or Sizzler with craft beer. It's a cookie cutter business with food that tastes like food you can get in 90% of the ""restaurants"" any place you'd find a Walmart or tourist trap. Looking for food on autopilot stop here. On par with Solent Green. Looking for a good meal? Definitely pass this place by"
B G.,"San Francisco, CA",70,37,15,2.0,5/10/2015,"The server was great. The food - mediocre.  Had the Tortilla Soup - that was good. The way they serve it was cool: they put a bowl of dry ingredients in front of you (tortillas, lime, etc.) and the server pours the soup over it in front of you.  I also had the Jambalaya - not much taste to it. Left most of it uneaten Pomegranate martini - it was pure syrup (no real pomegranate juice) and way too sweet. Didn't touch it after first sip."
Diego E.,"Guttenberg, NJ",1,6,,1.0,4/15/2016,"1st & last time there! Was treated horribly since the moment my wife and I showed up. Was overcharged, and when we tried to dispute it, was threatened and told to leave. Deserves less than 1 star!!"
Alejandro G.,"Miami, FL",37,20,3,1.0,10/16/2015,"If I could give zero stars I would.  I'm vegan, I ordered a vegetarian pizza with no cheese.  They put sausage on it.  Clearly they do not care about their customers.  My meal and appetite are completely ruined.  Don't come here."
Steph H.,"Windermere, FL",250,244,238,3.0,1/18/2015,"I've made it here twice for lunch- once during their soft opening and once more recently. Both meals were good, but nothing to write home about. Most recently, I did the unlimited soup and salad combo which was a good lunch time offering! They offered quite a few salad and soup options you could alternate between which was nice! They even included a caprese salad I enjoyed! While I might not be craving any of their entrees, their pizookies, hot out of the oven cookies served in a skillet with ice cream are amazing! The white chocolatr macadamia nut cookie is out of this world! I'll never complain about going to BJ's, but there are other options in the area I'd hit up before BJ's."
Candy B.,"Hollywood, FL",6,14,26,4.0,5/12/2015,"Boyfriend and I went here for lunch while visiting Orlando. We both started with the ""Strawberry Patch"" drinks which were soooo yummy (get if you like strawberries!) We shared their ""Best Beginnings"" appetizer combo sampler and were surprised how large it was portion was. Every app was really yummy: spinach artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, and Santa Fe spring rolls (I think these were my favorite) all came with a dipping sauce too. Then we shared a BJs Brewhouse Classic Tavern Cut Pizza. Loved that too! Not a lot of bread/crust which is what I like and very flavorful. Ended with the ""Peanut Butter Smores"" Pizookie. That was the only think I was disappointed in. Not a lot of cookie, mostly marshmallow, and really sweet. Just not my liking and not worth all the sugars/carbs/calories. Service was great though. I would come back :)"
Frank A.,"Miami, FL",2,73,4,3.0,3/5/2015,"Been to these BJ brew houses several times around Florida. Inconsistent, not great service, long waits, bar area not easy to order from, the one in Miami at International Mall was pretty good but the others at The Falls and Orlando International location were a bust.  Beer is good, salads were good, thicker Pizza was not good very salty and unflavorful. Yea I know it's not a word. But that's how it tasted.  The thin crust I heard was much better.  Not worth the wait is my final advice."
Bryan L.,"Luling, LA",0,7,14,1.0,3/28/2016,"I think they don't like Asian customer.  I sat there with my friend over 15min after assit the table,but nobody come.   Thank you for your best service."
Mary M.,"Woodhaven, MI",0,22,1,5.0,2/17/2016,We had Natalie as our waitress and she was very pleasant and personable. We had Baked Ziti- my husband said it was so good he could have ate two and my pulled pork was very good- the cole slaw was very yummy- all in all for a first time visit --- very good and would definitely return
Linda L.,"East Hartford, CT",1,27,34,4.0,11/21/2014,"First time at a BJ's came for lunch and had the soup (Tuscan tomato) and salad (wedge) very yummy and free refills however couldn't do that very filling  frank had the ""French"" dip though they call it a roast beef dip dame same the caramelized onions really nice touch couldn't eat it all. Pear cider was light and very refreshing  Bob was a very knowledgeable server and very helpful. Give BJ's a try for lunch cannot say anything about dinner but willing to try it!"
Marissa R.,"St Louis, MO",65,88,63,4.0,1/3/2016,"After we got off the plane, we were starving! BJ's was right around the corner, we stopped in for a bite. It was very good! Lots of us got the burgers, they were enormous! They have a very large menu, so it took awhile to decide, but overall, it was very good."
Chria F.,"Zephyrhills, FL",0,1,,3.0,9/24/2016,"I came into get a to go order, the staff was nice and my pizza was pretty good, but my wife burger was burnt up! We are very disappointed in her burger and she had to get something from someplace else because she couldn't even eat it."
Jessica S.,"Miami, FL",17,13,1,1.0,3/20/2016,The service is terrible and slow. They had multiple tables open and they refused to seat our group of 5. There were people sitting everywhere in the front and yet their manager had the audacity to look us in the face and say yes we have tables open but the wait is 45 minutes. Either hire more waiters or a new manager. Not coming back
Michelle M.,"Bethel Park, PA",0,6,,3.0,3/17/2016,"Had wings for appetizer, they were pretty good.  Also had a pizza and it reminded me of the old Pizza Hut Pan Pizza crust when it used to be good.  Service was good and friendly.  Prices were reasonable."
James T.,"Graniteville, Staten Island, NY",33,182,42,4.0,1/9/2016,"Pretty good, service was good, ambiance nice, I had seafood, my wife had steak both were nice dishes, BJ's is known for Pizza although we didn't try it, I would recommend BJ's for a decent meal"
Ben S.,"Orlando, FL",13,38,40,3.0,8/21/2015,"Similar to places like Smokey Bones meets Cheesecake Factory restaurants, this place prizes its collection of in-house beers. They don't make the beers AT the location, but they do make the Root Beer. Sometimes the Root Beer comes out flat, if so, send it back. Most of the wait staff aren't familiar with the beers, and can't make good pairing suggestions. Portions are large but pricey."
Amber E.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",0,2,,5.0,8/15/2016,"Just attended beer dinner here with green flash IPA, great experience, cedric was great as always. Will be back"
Michael A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,160,96,4.0,11/7/2015,"Eight of us had dinner here on a Friday evening.  We ordered the Best Beginnings app plate and it was loaded with delicious goodies.  Everyone was pleased with their orders.  There was one complaint about a hamburger not being hot enough.  Our server, Laura, offered to have it heated.  My wife had the vegetable penne primavera and enjoyed it.  I had the cherry chipotle salmon and it was delicious. The cherry glaze was good and the fish was cooked correctly.  The restaurant has several on tap beers and Laura was familiar with all of them.  She did a great job serving our table."
Richard C.,"Manor, PA",0,13,,4.0,5/23/2014,"Had a very good dinner. The waitress was excellent. Not only did the waitress check on us, but other wait staff as well; very attentive (5 *'s).  The food quality was very good (4*'s).  Our family of 5 adults and a 4 y/o had a pleasant evening.  Cost was $$$ out of $$$$$.  I highly recommend BJ's Brew house. BTW. If you like a chocolate stout, that is slightly sweet,  I recommend their Tatonka Stout."
