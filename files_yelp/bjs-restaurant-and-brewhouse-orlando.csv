Jennifer R.,"Orlando, FL",2,12,,5.0,8/2/2017,"I never go to a restaurant and order pasta but the day I walked in and I saw the menu, the baked ziti was calling my name . Portion size was good the taste was great everything about my meal was awesome.  I also got a half and half skillet cookie peanut butter and cookies and cream I need to revisit soon"
Melinda P.,"Orlando, FL",44,122,337,2.0,1/7/2018,"A group of us met up here before hitting up David's Bridal to go dress shopping for one of my besties. I was looking for a place that had vegan options and BJ's has several plus of course items for everyone else in the party. When we first got there, all seemed well. The server was friendly and was checking on us regularly. However around halfway through the meal, this changed. She suddenly became unfriendly, seemed to have an attitude, and service was super slow. We were anxious because we were trying to make the dress appointment. We sat down just after 6 and the bride had to leave before we were all cashed out to get to the appointment at 7:30. We were a larger party, but I just felt like this was excessive.  As far as the food it was pretty good. The lentil soup I ordered was just okay. However, the portobello and asparagus salad was awesome! It had such a great flavor. I'd order that again for sure. I just don't think I'd return to this location since the service was spotty in my opinion."
Amber F.,"Orlando, FL",49,45,46,3.0,1/5/2018,"Met part of my bridal party here for dinner before dress shopping at David's Bridal, which is super close. Our appointment was at 7:30, so I made us a reservation at BJ's for 6 thinking that should be plenty of time. When our waitress first came up, I was excited because she was pleasant and seemed on top of it. Some of our party was a little late, but only about 15 minutes.  Three of the party ordered salads, and they came out about 20 minutes before any of the other food, which started trickling out about 7:05. I had the avocado egg rolls as my main course and a side of fries. My food was just ok... nothing to rave about.  As soon as we sat down, our waitress assigned us numbers based on who was paying together. I thought it was a great idea and thought it would make the check process go smoothly. I was wrong. There were 9 of us total (6 different checks) and three of the checks were all messed up. We didn't get our checks until about 7:20 (even though I made it a point to ask for them once the salads came out). Overall, I was pretty disappointed and it'll be awhile before I go there again."
Heather C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",313,401,149,3.0,1/3/2018,"Okay.... the menu is HUGE.   I finally settled on a salad that came out looking like an art deco masterpiece.  There were dried onions balanced high on top of a huge heaping pile of salad and chicken and it reminded me of JENGA.   Carefully removing the ""art project"" I was delighted to take the first bite of this delicious salad with chicken. (It was the Santa Fe BTW)   Super yummy and while we were sitting waiting for our order to arrive, momma said we should download the app so that we could receive a cookie and ice cream yummy dessert for free.  YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAS. Although I did not partake in eating the cookie deliciousness treat, it looked yummy enough and hey...  whats wrong with FREE again?  NA-DA!"
Steven W.,"Ocoee, FL",38,29,228,5.0,1/5/2018,Very friendly staff. Great Service. Travis our waiter was extremely nice. Will be back.
Stephanie G.,"Orlando, FL",104,56,121,5.0,10/3/2017,"Believe it or not it's my 2nd time eating at a BJ's. EVER! I've been missing out! Wine is 1/2 off on tues. If you download they app you can claim a mini pizooike. Byron was our server and was fantastic! I had the mediterranean chicken tacos and a strawberry mojito. Those tacos were full of flavor and on what seemed to be a pita instead of a floor tortilla or hard shell. Wasnt expecting that at all, but it was genius. I absolutely loved them. There's were a total of two and were filling. The drink was made with love because I definitely tasted the alcohol. NOT COMPLAINING. Lastly, the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie. It's a warm baked chocolate chip cookie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's a MUST."
Val D.,"Orlando, FL",178,61,141,3.0,12/16/2017,"Ordered the Santa Fe Salad, DO NOT ORDER THIS. Was very displeased. Overly dressed in their ""southwest dressing"". The dressing was not good to start with. And the chicken was dry.  My kids had the pepperoni flat bread, NOT life changing. And certainly did not taste good either. Also ordered the grilled cheese and it tasted funky. The butter they used to pan fry the bread had a weird after taste to it.  The ONLY good item they got right was the fries. Crunchy.  I will not be returning. Quality of food is poor and the prices are beyond what they reflect."
Hieu L.,"Orlando, FL",184,218,1394,5.0,4/6/2017,"Had a great time here on a Thursday evening. TBH got home from work and a flyer caught my eye. Thursday baby back ribs all day special for $13.99 half rack and full rack $18.99 (prices not exact) and $5 dollar you call it! You bet! So got the ole Lady loaded up and off we went. Wasn't too busy, but there was a slight wait for dinning room. But of course no wait for the bar so we took a high top. I prefer the sports anyways on the multi screens of TVs. I preceded to order my full rack of ribs. Came with Caesar salad ( choice of Caesar, house, and one more can't remember) two sides, I got fries and veggies. Other options were mash potatoes, asparagus, brussel sprouts,pilaf rice and a few more. My girlfriend got her favorite Sirloin steak. And I went with bicardi and coke, thought I change it up a bit from my usual.  I would say I was quite impressed with the ribs. Although everyone loves fall off the bone. I like it from the bone get my hand dirtyyyy. It was very tender and glazed enough where I didn't need a pile of napkins. Same with the veggies cooked excellent. Nothing worse than soggy veggies. Almost forgot it came with desert. PIZOOKIE I believe it was called. I ordered the triple chocolate chocolate cookie and chocolate ice cream. Amazeballz!Overall great date night."
Sharon C.,"Atlanta, GA",243,297,1497,4.0,2/8/2017,"A few years ago, I would have said, meh, it alright.... This place is a step up from Ale House to me. Better look and feel. Nice bar area and it's a large place and so is the menu.  My fav here is definitely the salmon quinoa dish. Love it! I order this with zero salt each time and it tastes great!! The soy ginger salmon dressing is on the side as well. The dish is not bland at all and still tastes as if I never held the salt. Makes you think though. Just how much sodium a dish really has.  I've had a personal pizza here. Not a fan. If your going to serve any style of pizza make is delicious please. Otherwise, take if off the menu.  The service has always been great, funny servers, professional servers, all around great each time. The place is always clean. You can pay digitally now.  Also, sign up for their email list and get a free mini dessert. I had the salted caramel cookie which is served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Nothing to write home about but it's alright."
Erica B.,"Orlando, FL",1,19,28,4.0,11/26/2017,Be sure to come with and appetite they have a great menu with a large selection of beer to choose from. Took awhile to get our drinks due to the holiday. Manager was kind and gave us the meal for free!
John C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",258,1256,3001,4.0,6/18/2017,"My daughter and I stopped at this location after she flew in to OIA.  We were looking for a place to eat and since we both know the Brewhouse and the menu we stopped here.  It did not disappoint.  The same menu, food quality and flavor as in Daytona (our home base).  We sat outside and enjoyed the Florida evening weather.  The wait staff was great and friendly.  The pizza was very filling and we had half a pizza as leftovers.  Watch your map as the location came up quick and you need to get over to get in to the shopping area."
Debbie F.,"Orange Park, FL",170,393,1525,3.0,11/22/2017,On a whim we choose BJ's and I had not eaten at one before. The menu was extensive with so many choices. Everything to percentage out at about $15.00. I was not real hungry at the time and just wanted a small meal with a salad. Salads are a upcharge with a entrée so  I was heading toward $20.00 for my meal that I really didn't want. I ended up with soup and salad adding a side of grilled chicken. It was perfect combo for me. My husband just had to have MEAT so he ordered the special Prime Rib dinner for $29.00. It looked plentiful but he had no leftovers except the dessert which we shared with our table. The restaurant looks like a elegant upscale sports bar. Their were several large parties going on with large tables so this says how big the place is. My overall was it fits everyone's appetite but this would not be my first choice for me. I may need to come back when they run some specials and try again soon.
Aimee B.,"Ocoee, FL",116,139,105,4.0,8/31/2017,This is another of my lunch favorites.  I have a friend who is vegetarian so she is a huge fan of this place since even she has at least 5 different options.  There is a wide variety of food to cover anyone in your group.  This visit I opted for the Shrimp & Arugula pita tacos.  It was even better than I thought it was going to be with lots of flavor in the vinaigrette on the dish as well.  This visit my friend ordered the lentil soup and margarita flatbread for the pick 2 lunch special.  All of the lunch items are of good value and the service has been consistent for me when I have been there.
Annie K.,"Orlando, FL",21,87,612,5.0,5/25/2017,"Excellent happy hour! Half off appetizers and mini pizza. We had some of everything, including calamari and awesome chicken lettuce cups. I enjoyed the root beer chicken wings, nice creative flavors. The mini deep dish pizza omg, i picked of course the five meat one, the crust was crunchy and inside was soft. You cannot beat all this food for less than $25. They have very good variety of craft beers and drink specials too. You do not want to miss this!"
Ho L.,"Orlando, FL",79,924,419,2.0,3/31/2017,"This is a run of the mill chain restaurant, with a huge menu of tasty (and unhealthy) food, and a large selection of beers. For a place built around it's brewery, their own beers aren't that good. The decor is pretty nice as far as chains go, although it is very open, so the noise level can get loud."
Paul G.,"Orlando, FL",138,647,1085,4.0,3/7/2017,"BJ's has really stepped their game up. We came a few years back, and weren't impressed. This time we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the prime rib and BBQ pulled pork. The prime rib was really good, but the pulled pork was great! The salted caramel pizookie was a nice finishing touch. Unfortunately I have to dock a star because the food wasn't hot and the pizookie was a bit raw for my taste."
Jeremy L.,"Orlando, FL",205,57,70,5.0,11/10/2017,Decided to stop in here at BJ's Restaurant for the Veterans Day meal I decided to sit at the bar for Quick Service I was warmly attended by the server Josh since I never ate here before he suggested some really nice delicious burgers I decided to get the Hickory brisket and bacon burger is a sweet Tangy BJ's pepper BBQ sauce for smoked brisket Applewood smoked bacon Jack and cheddar cheese red onions and mayonnaise not only does it look delicious but it is delicious I highly recommend you get this burger but also asked for the server Josh serves you he is a very attentive and very friendly as well as professional also try the strawberry lemonade since this is my first time to BJ's I highly recommend the locals to stop here as well as our tourists
Michelle C.,"Washington, DC",112,259,148,3.0,8/1/2017,"I came here with a big group and even though we had a pleasant dinner experience (servers were quick, food was delivered fresh and expediently), I was disappointed that we made a reservation and still had to wait 30 mins after we arrived for them to be prepared. The whole point of a reservation is for the table to be ready without a wait! The food itself was good, but I'm a little skeptical if it was all fresh. I have a hunch that much of it came frozen at some point. Still, the servers were kind and I think they did the best they could. This review is more a reflection of the subpar management and staffing situation than the actual service."
Michael L.,"Kissimmee, FL",2,67,,4.0,11/5/2017,"Out of all the BJ's I have been to, this one at Millenia has always been my favorite. Whether its a quick lunch or a late night dinner, I always leave full and have a great experience."
Brandi G.,"Orlando, FL",31,184,105,4.0,6/11/2017,"I really enjoyed my meal here! I hadn't been it about 3 years so I wasn't sure what to expect. The food was fantastic. I ordered the prime rib and received a hefty portion. The booths were spacious and comfortable. The place was immaculate. I look forward to trying that thick, juicy pork chop they're advertising!"
Massoud M.,"Orlando, FL",18,7,,1.0,11/2/2017,"brew house with no brews and no available GM to listen to the guest input!!! I went there last night with a group of 9, they did not have the beers that one of my colleague was ordering three time!!! Their excuse was that Pumpkin Ale was too popular and they are sold out, for two other unavailable beers, they said their hydrogen gas to pour them has not been working and have dispatched a technician and should get there in 5 hours to fix it( around 11PM!!??). we were the only table in the dinning room at 5:30PM but were not attended to at all. GM was ""too busy doing something in the back"" and could not talk to us!!!!  I am taking my big group on Nov 19th to Miller Ale house on Kirkman!!!"
Craig Z.,"Orlando, FL",19,42,94,3.0,7/3/2017,"I'd say this place is about a 3.5. They seem to have stepped it up in certain departments. For example, the service is gotten better than I remembered years before. I had the ribs and they were actually quite good and the sauce was great. I'm sure some things are no good there,  so I would recommend avoiding those things and asking your server if they know what would be best to order. Big menus usually mean too many options. Lots of specials and 2 happy hours several days a week. So it's worth visiting the bar for a spell"
Shena G.,"Orlando, FL",69,12,,3.0,10/20/2017,"Service was good, they have $5 top shelf on Thursday's so that was lit. The menu is big but nothing REALLY stood out to me. I went with my safe meal, steak. It was good, nothing special."
Todd S.,"Orlando, FL",385,280,366,3.0,11/18/2016,"This is a chain restaurant, but not a bad option overall.  They brew a selection of house beers that are pretty decent and priced affordably. The menu is huge and I always have a hard time selecting. They offer light fair such as salads or soups, and then large meals and entrees as well. I usually come here for lunch and don't have a problem finding something I like.  The service is usually pretty good, and I can get in and out pretty quickly."
Tenny S.,"Sanford, FL",167,23,32,4.0,11/11/2016,"Went here for lunch today with some coworkers. It was a good experience and the food was definitely good, I'd come back to eat here again for that alone. The only annoying part was waiting to be seated, there was no one in line ahead of us and tons of tables open and we were just standing there waiting forever. We ended up just going and sitting at the bar and that ended up working well. I'd recommend just sitting at the bar or bar area to avoid the hassle of being seated.  I ordered a dish with grilled chicken and quinoa which was delicious. If you're a bigger eater I'd say definitely go for the dinner portion because the lunch portion did not completely fill me up. A coworker of mine got a wedge salad which looked delicious which I'll have to try next time.  Overall I'd come back and eat here again"
Susan J.,"Winter Garden, FL",1,10,1,1.0,8/11/2017,Order all wrong for my friend. She had asked for only butter on potato got it covered in sour cream too. Steak wrong. turmeric cauliflower bite- basic lentil soup with raw cauliflower in it. Terrible. Asked to get it as a appetizer- I asked after my friend got their salad about it and it still came out with my food. The didn't refill drinks. Really disappointing dinner.
Mike F.,"Lomita, CA",7,30,1,4.0,9/23/2017,I went with a group of seven or eight people everyone enjoy their meal immensely seems like the best thing was the desert everyone was fighting over it LOL definitely give this place for stars for their food and their service was excellent great waiter but definitely recommend it
Shilley T.,"Casselberry, FL",257,241,1040,4.0,12/9/2015,"Everything about this place is great. I love how the menu has a wide variety. You can pretty much order anything from burgers, pizzas to tacos. There is also great beer selection and I heard that they also have their own brew. I ordered the Fire Roasted Chicken Barbacoa, it was very good. The chicken and the rice were both seasoned to perfection. This dish had a slight kick to it without being overwhelming. I really enjoyed it. I also ordered the Salted Caramel Pizookie. Whoever came up with the idea of a pizza cookie is a genius!! It was just AMAZING. If you are like me and like anything sweet and salty, this Pizookie is for you. Not enough of word could describe how awesome it is!!Also, you can actually try 3 different pizookies for I believe about $10.  The service was good considering the fact that our party was rather large. Our waitress was attentive, got our orders out quickly and refilled our drinks promptly. In conclusion this was an overall great experience and can't wait to try the other dishes and moreover pizookies."
Sharmain R.,"Altamonte Springs, Orlando, FL",42,73,286,4.0,8/19/2016,"The food at BJ's is always on point.  There is a wide variety of menu items to choose from.  Also, the beer and beverages menu is huge.  I tried the Handcrafted Sodas for the first time and though it was just okay.  However, the Late Night Burger that I ordered was huge, accompanied with fries.  The burger was delicious. I also had the Mini Monkey Bread Pazookie and it was to die for.  I would definitely order it again."
Joyce H.,"Orlando, FL",1,6,,5.0,7/21/2017,"Thanks your BJ's for the complimentary pizza.  It was great, snd the service was excellent."
Mia P.,"Orlando, FL",345,520,3752,4.0,9/8/2015,"Enjoyable place! Very down to earth and a great brew house selection of beer. The also have mixed beer speciality drinks and bar cocktails.  Enjoyed their pizzas and most of all their ""pizookie"" desserts.  The pizookie is like a warm baked cookie in a small pan topped with ice cream. Tonight we tried the Smores pizookie and it has scorched gooey marshmallows on it...so luscious! I suppose one very hungry person could eat a whole one, but it's nice for two people to share it since it's a lot of dessert.  Also like the handcrafted speciality sodas (root beer, black cherry, cream soda and orange cream) that are made with beet sugar and no artificial ingredients. This is a great place to come with friends for a relaxed night out. Like the dim lighting and cozy seating. Sign up online for some great discounts via email. This is a chain restaurant that I really like, and I can be picky about chains. The service is usually pretty good too."
Sean M.,"Jacksonville, FL",206,471,234,3.0,8/20/2015,"I've had a tumultuous relationship with BJ's over the years since moving to Florida. I've been going to this chain since I was a kid in LA, and later in Phoenix and always enjoyed it. In Florida I have been unusually unhappy with the food and/or the service. Tonights issue was the food. Our server was great! First off, we were seated immediately and we got our drinks in no time. Made it just under the deadline for half-price appetizers, so we went with Carnitas Fries and Spinach Artichoke Dip. The portions were so huge we didn't even bother getting anything else to eat.  The chips for the dip were greasy and the dip had a weird texture from the cream cheese used that wasn't creamy, but more chalky. There was a lack of flavor and of spinach and artichokes so it was just mediocre. The fries however had a pretty good green chile and cheese that was nice, but the carnitas were darned good. Not a bad dish, and with the half off deal it was really a great price.  The one constant for me here is always the micro-brewed root beer. It's full of deep flavor and has this aftertaste that my wife finds off-putting but that I just love. It stays on my palate for a moment with an earthy, sort of licorice flavor that I just really love.  These restaurants look so nice, but I just can't ever seem to have a better than average experience here."
Andre R.,"Mesa, AZ",111,46,34,3.0,4/21/2017,"Team outing at BJ's Brew House. Decent happy hour for drink prices, however my drink was a new special drink they had just started advertising for their happy hour. They didn't have one of the ingredients necessary to complete it. So I was the last person to get my special drink. As a group we had several appetizers, the fried mozzarella was amazing, lightly breaded and soft. The spinach stuffed mushrooms with lemon squeezed atop absolutely delicious!! A coworker order the Bison burger w/ Cole slaw with  sriracha sauce for the side.. pass on the slaw. It was more of a side salad with sriracha drizzled on top. Another dish was a slab of ribs. The ribs had a crispness to it which was a great touch as the meat was tender and tasteful. The broccoli they served with it was practically raw and dry. Pass on the broccoli or you will be disappointed. Another dish was the grilled Mahi tacos, they were very tasty as well. For dessert we had the monkey bread with ice cream, and the pazookie, it was delicious thought tasty the pazookie was far better. Overall we had a good time as a group."
Laura W.,"Orlando, FL",21,122,,4.0,7/29/2017,"BJs at Milenia does a good job with service and bringing your food out quickly and correctly. I think the service here is better than some other restaurants in the area. BJs is a chain that offers something for everyone, and they can accommodate special requests. I had the mushroom burger with their veggie patty and also a side of fries. The burger came with pesto and a special sauce that may have been sour cream based as well as a portobello mushroom that was grilled with grilled onions and a slice of cheese melted on top. It is a mouthful, and tastes very good. BJs fried are especially good, crispy and salty and seem to have been dipped in a batter before frying. They remind me a little of Belgium fries. The service was quick, pleasant and accurate, and the check came when asked.  BJs is located across Conroy Rd from Millenia Mall and is very near the Container Store and Olive Garden."
Melissa M.,"Orlando, FL",154,177,676,1.0,6/22/2015,"One star for the service or I should say lack of!  We came here as our second choice as MIMI's cafe closed down,  We were seated right away looked like a recently cleared off table(notice how I didn't say clean)  It took maybe 15-20 min for our server to come up to us He got our drink order and was eager to rush off I had to call him backed to put in an appetizer. It took about 40 min for the appetizer to come out, server nowhere to be found to check on us or anything  Shortly after the appetizers came out our food came, had to ask the nice server that brought our food out for silverware and napkins( as there were none on the table)  Our server was too busy hanging out in the bar area with two girls.  He finally came over when we were almost done to check on us.  No drink refills or anything!  Not the first time with awful service at this location as well as no management present"
Melissa G.,"Southwest Orlando, Orlando, FL",25,6,1,5.0,10/3/2017,"My husband & I are new to the area. We decided to try this place. The service was great & the food was fantastic. Our server, Michael, was very knowledgeable about both the food & drink menu. He also recommended that we join the rewards program so we could get special deals on several menu items. We will definitely be going there again!"
Jefe H.,"Clermont, FL",3,60,18,4.0,6/19/2017,"BJ's menu is expansive. There are some great choices and some so-so for your palate. The deep dish personal pizza, a Caesar salad, with a couple pints of Pirhana is my favorite. They have some good sandwiches and good appetizers. I wish there were more BJ's around."
Amy P.,"Orlando, FL",100,170,60,4.0,10/19/2016,They have a crazy extensive menu with anything you could really ask for plus a full bar. I think the best thing is the avocado egg roll appetizer. Never had a bad dish but it can get pricey really fast.
Morgan M.,"Orlando, FL",12,23,9,5.0,5/27/2017,The service is always good and the deep dish pizza is super yummy! There's definitely an option for everyone on the menu!
Kiraa M.,"Clermont, FL",34,14,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Came in with my family tonight. Still here in fact- waiting for the poor excuse of a waitress to bring back my credit card.  Several issues with our meals. Burgers overcooked to the point of being fully charred and still delivered to the table, other plates too hot to touch but the food on them was ice cold. One burger had an egg on top and it was brought out with the yolk cooked all the way through and the whites were brown and crispy. We were not asked if we would like to see a manager. No manager came to ask us about or apologize for this experience.  Once the waitress dropped out check it has now been 15 minutes and she has yet to come back to collect the payment.  My family had previously had very pleasant experiences here but we will never return. Save your money and visit an establishment that values the time and experience of their customers."
