Mims M.,"Orlando, FL",54,151,72,4.0,2/12/2011,"I  like this place.  Yes it's a chain but the food is good every time I go.  The only grievance I have is that they lied about the wait time.  They quoted us 10-15 min, it actually took us 25 to be seated.  I have a tip though. Keep an eye out for open booths at the  bar.  I looked away for 1 min and someone jumped on a booth I had been eyeballing the entire time we were waiting. I was less than pleased.  Plus I 'm pregnant and was starving so maybe that had something to do with it.  One cool thing...while we were waiting, someone came around and offered us a piece of the deep dish pizza while we waited so I thought that was pretty cool.   We ordered the small plate mushrooms which had 6, I was expecting 4 so I was pleasantly surprised.  We split the Jambalaya which was delish and finished our meal with a pazookie (sp)?     Prices are decent and service was great.  We will go back."
AnDrea H.,"Atlanta, GA",6,37,6,2.0,5/29/2013,"TGI Friday's on steriods! Uh yes.... Too much on the menu.....(in my opinion..) and the food is not at all stellar, just ok... With options as these, how can you really mess them up. It's just their own twist.. You either like it or you don't. Pre-fab, frozen twists...... Also, their (complimentary) bread is absolutely NASty, even when fresh, (ours was not)..... of which we had to ask for... Their Italian dressing was/is gross to. Really Italian dressing?~Yes~But Grrrrossss! They may have been short staffed but service was sub par...So Yes, Meh from me ;)"
Bruce W.,"Rapid City, MI",0,8,,1.0,12/27/2014,"I am generous with two stars. The beer yes was good however nothing to get excited about. The food sucked to put it simple as did the overall service. Burger was over cooked for med well, bun was toasted but stale. Fries all frozen.... Seriously a place this size cannot make their own burgers and fries? Frankly I would bet every dish we had was from a food vendor not made fresh. Service sucked one check in over 40 minutes I got up to get a catsup off of a near table and the waitress say me and never said a word. Manager? Non existent, no check in at table never even saw one... I guess the owners don't care it is enough of a cash cow not to care? Price was reasonable but not for sub par food, drive through could have been better and a lot quicker...BJ epic fail...start by firing the manager...then get a clue with your staff ...too many choices in Orlando if your in town pick another place !!"
Ted H.,"Orlando, FL",8,11,2,1.0,10/19/2013,Sitting for 30 min and no food.  This is our second time here and service is slooooow
Carla Z.,"Kyle, TX",6,95,,2.0,12/14/2014,We have a BJ's in Austin that we love and go to several times a month so we thought it would be as good in Orlando as it is here.  Well it is NOT.  We like to eat at the bar and we love the Classic hand tossed pizza we get in Austin.  In Orlando they have a Classic pizza but it is the thick crust and it is not hand tossed.  The sold us a gluten free pizza that was the think crust telling us it tasted the same as the Classic pizza in Austin which was not true.  The crust was horrible.  We both only ate part of one slice and left.
Edward A.,"Orlando, FL",32,15,1,1.0,1/2/2014,"Food was OK, nothing spectacular. Had one of their deep dish pizzas. Service was spotty and that makes the experience of turning average food to an above average time. Ordered a drink that never got served and they still had it listed on the bill. Also ordered a Coke and it took once again a long time and a reminder to the waitress to bring it out. No apologies just an ""OK."" If you think ""OK"" is to be charged for a drink that gets ignored and a Coke that a turtle could serve better --- this is your place."
Helen R.,"Orlando, FL",48,156,3,4.0,6/8/2010,"Are you a Nutty Brewnette or perhaps a Brewhouse Blonde? Those are just some of the delicious beer options at BJ's. Indecisive (you probably have highlights)? Not to worry - the restaurant offers 5 oz. tastings - so you don't have to commit to a whole pint of brew.  There is a lot of variety on the menu - my favorites are the thai shrimp lettuce wraps and fish tacos. The wraps are an appetizer but big enough to be a meal. There is also quite the variety of deep dish pizza. I'm a thin crust girl myself, so I haven't ordered, but I've heard they're really good.  We can't end this review without the mention of the Pizookie - yummy! It's a giant, warm cookie, topped with ice cream, how can this not be fantastic? Just order one for the table though, it is rather large!"
Vikki F.,"Orlando, FL",21,42,11,1.0,9/24/2013,"Is there a zero stars because this place deserves it. Took 45 minutes to get my first drink, service was horrible, food was all wrong, to the point that the manager comped our entire table of 9 people. Never again."
Melissa M.,"Orlando, FL",36,45,5,4.0,9/9/2013,"My family and I were here this evening and had a great experience.  We ordered the black and blue flatbread appetizer and it was delicious.  For entrees, I got the french dip and my husband got one of the burgers (I forget the name, but it had guacamole on it) and our son had the mini corn dogs.  All was delicious, and our waiter was quick to clear plates and refill drinks.  He was always friendly and had great recommendations.  He even told us where we could get beer similar to what they brewed in house so we could have them at home (apparently the state of FL doesn't allow them to sell corked beers).  All and all, it was a good experience...and the bathrooms were really clean, which always gets a big thumbs up from me."
Libby W.,"Orlando, FL",504,296,74,4.0,4/7/2010,"Same great food as the other Orlando location but with better service.  We started off with a beer, I had the red ale and loved it also their new amber beer is also a good choice. I love their beers here, they are not brewed on property but they are brewed in Las Vegas, kegged and then shipped over here. I also love that they have the pairing info right on the menu so you can see what beer goes with what entree.  For our appetizer we had the avocado rolls with the tamarind sauce. Large rolls filled with wonderful large chunks of avocado was brought to the table. I loved the crunch of the roll paired with the softness of the avocado.  I noticed that they recently rolled out some new menu items, starter app type items that are good to share, or good for a snack for one. I think next time I'm going to have to try one.  We decided we were in a pizza mood and ordered the deep dish cheese burger pizza. I really enjoyed the crust, its not dry at all, it actually seems a bit buttery with notes of garlic. The toppings were great and it wasn't overwhelming like you were eating a mess of piled high cheese burgers. The flavor was more subtle but I really enjoyed it.  my glass was never empty and I actually knew we had a server at this location. The hunters creek location needs to take notes on better service from this location.  Also I'm curious about why there are hunky beef cake photos of men wearing barely nothing in the women's bathroom, and am equally curious if there are photos of scantily clad women in the men's restroom."
Jacqueline C.,"Atlanta, GA",295,236,281,3.0,8/21/2010,"I'm giving this 3 stars as an average of the two experiences: one being the night in question (1 star) and two being the way corporate handled the situation (5 stars).  The following Monday, I called corporate to notify them of my unsatisfactory experience and received a call the next day from Beth, Director of Operations. She was in town visiting this location and said she would make sure something like this never happens again. She was very sorry and said that what took place was completely unacceptable. She also gave me a full refund for the platters I purchased."
Bill R.,"Port St Lucie, FL",28,15,3,1.0,2/15/2014,"Flatbread pizzas had virtually no toppings.  Ashley the manager thought it appropriate to discount the bill $.98 for our trouble. Not to mention her tone was snarky and condescending. Our server Michael was excellent, very attentive and polite.  The burger we ordered and the clam chowder was excellent."
Joshua K.,"West Palm Beach, FL",186,58,31,2.0,4/10/2011,"I have been to this BJ's several times before and it was actually very good. That being said, much of a dining-out experience and one's general impression of a restaurant is based upon their server.  This Friday, we met friends for dinner and I was sorely disappointed. From the moment we ordered, the waiter was rude, slow to respond and unhelpful. The drinks and food took entirely too long, and when they did arrive, the preparation and taste was merely mediocre.  I do hope to have the opportunity to improve my rating of BJ's. I will say that their Pizookie Desserts are amazing!"
Rachel B.,"Detroit, MI",243,636,63,4.0,1/15/2010,"I was pretty impressed by how nice this ""chain brewhouse"" looked on the inside.  In fact, at first I thought I was underdressed until I saw a 70-year-old guy in a tracksuit.  Well, that's Florida. Our server was very attentive...almost annoyingly so.  But he did his job very well. The food was surprisingly good too - thai shrimp lettuce wraps for an appetizer; a turkey burger on sourdough; and for me, an enormous loaded baked potato with fresh (no, really, they were fresh!) vegetables, two types of cheese, and alfredo sauce which I asked to be given on the side, 'cause I really didn't feel like having a heart attack right there at the table.  It was filling and delicious, and I even had some left over.  It's too bad I can't use my hotel mini-fridge because it's stocked to the brim with liquor and soda we're not allowed to drink! Onto the beer.  Very nice selection, all seemed kinda mild.  We tried a hefewizen, a porter, a red, a blonde ale (all house brews), and some other belgian-style beer which my husband commented went down much more smoothly than expected.  The ""drinkability"" factor was very high with all these beers.  Always a plus. I also noticed they brew their very own berry cider. The best part was how affordable everything was.  A four-beer sampler was only six bucks.  The potato was HUGE (I'm talking main course all by itself), and it was just $8.  I even got a fruity mixed drink (peachy keen sangria), which in any chain restaurant would go anywhere from $10-14, and at BJ's it was only $5.95.  Not bad!"
Trevor L.,"Casselberry, FL",2,9,,5.0,3/24/2010,"Ate there last Thursday. Patient waitstaff (our party was quite..erm...slow in their decision making process) was friendly and quick to please. Ordered a California burger, medium, and they actually got the burger cooked correctly! It seems like no one wants to serve pink in the center burgers anymore, so I was pleasantly surprised. Good burger as well. The wife enjoyed all of the beers on the six-beer sampler of BJ's excellent brews; as I'm not a beer drinker, I didn't try any, although their root beer (also brewed on by BJ's) was quite tasty. Be warned that this is not a quiet environment. It's a place where people go to have drinks, hang out, and shout insults at the refs who are adjudicating the games that are shown on the giant jumbotron screens. A great place, though, and one I heartily recommend!"
Cayenne D.,"Orlando, FL",40,20,26,4.0,2/28/2013,For a chain it was pretty good. They have a great beer selection and their own brews too. Thai Lettuce Wraps were good. Portions are Huge! We were in and out for lunch. Tons to choose from.
Nick F.,"Merrillville, IN",0,33,,5.0,11/19/2014,"I love BJ's.  Everything I have had there is delicious.  I have tried all of their own beers, all very good.  That time I traveled to florida for a week, we ate here 3 out of the 7 days.  Very kid friendly also.  My favorite franchise restaurant."
Pete D.,"Rockville, MD",11,185,70,3.0,5/1/2010,"This place reminded me of a local chain near home and the Cheesecake Factory because of its pretty extensive menu.  Wifey and I were talking about the decor and they put a lot of money into it.  From the LCD panels across the restaurant, to the garage doors, the large booths, and their nice looking bar area.  We stopped in here for lunch and arrived basically when they opened, 11:00 AM.  There were already a few tables, but we were nicely greeted and seated right away.  The sever came by and took our drink orders.  I read from another Yelper, they brew their own root beer in-house.  I normally never order root beer, but what the heck, let's try it.  This was very refreshing and I was a root beer fan (just for the time I was there). For our food, I started off with the chili, which is made with their Piranha Pale Ale beer.  The chili was alright, wasn't a huge fan.  It was missing ""filling,"" as it didn't have enough meat and beans.  As for the main attraction, I went with their famous deep dish pizza.  Kind of odd because we aren't in Chicago, but I'm glad the server recommended it.  The pizza dough was delicious!!  I got the Bj's classic (I think that's what it is, basically a ""surpreme"" pizza).  The only pitfall was that the toppings fell off, but I could careless.  I used my hands, put it right back on the dough and chomped away.  Wifey had the spaghetti with meat sauce.  I didn't expect too much out of it and after a taste it was decent.  A generous portion, along with some pieces of garlic bread. The service was good, couldn't complain at all as the server checked on us frequently and refilled our water cups.  The prices here are good and rather normal for this type of cuisine.  I noticed there are a handful of Bj's Restaurant and Brewhouse in FL (read my other review for the one in Pinellas Park).  A solid 3.5 star.  This is a great place to catch a game, have a brew, eat some good food, and relax."
Elizabeth F.,"Orlando, FL",421,277,141,4.0,12/20/2009,"I absolutely fell in LOVE with this place today. It is a great atmosphere, laid back, and fun. Great place to just hang out with friends and also a great place to watch sports. The bar area is HUGE, with tons of TV's playing all sorts of different games/sports. Their employees were very friendly, knew the menu, attentive to our needs, and quick.   Their Spinach and Artichoke Dip? AMAZING. By far, the best I've had (and I have tried a lot!) I ordered the California Club Flatbread - it was so good! Simple, yet the touch of avocado on top was the icing on the cake.  -------- Have to add an update to this review! Went back here tonight for dinner and it still was just as good as before. Tonight I had their Pear Cider - wow. REALLY good. I also got their Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad but instead of fried chicken, I substituted for grilled chicken. Besides the fact that they are VERY generous in their portion size (I think I could make 3 meals out of the leftovers!), this salad impressed me. It had nicely chopped lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers, slices of grilled chicken, toasted almond slices, egg, and then on top this zesty dressing! YUM!  Go, go, go!! :)"
Alexis N.,"Dallas, TX",372,208,48,4.0,3/2/2010,"I was really tempted to only give 3 stars, but I REALLY want to go back to this place and try some other stuff... which means I probably liked it more than I thought.  The atmosphere is kind of like a giant TGI Fridays, but better. They have a lot of TVs, which is awesome for watching sports, but unfortunately they never turn the sound on for the games.  First off: Pear Cider!! Yummmm... I was told to try this by Colleen B, so I ordered one before she arrived (and proceeded to order a pitcher of it. haha!) and it is surprisingly light and refreshing! Definitely going to have to get some more of that when I go back! Wedge Salad: pretty typical. (I know I just posted in that thread that I'm tired of seeing wedge salads on menues and that they are entirely uncreative, but it just sounded so refreshing at the moment, and it was!) Mini Great White Pizza: it was good, but a bit disappointing. When it came out, I literally said, ""This is what I get for a $10 pizza?"" Yeah... I wouldn't order a mini pizza next time, but there are a TON more menu items I really wanted to try! Their menu is kind of huge, like Cheesecake Factory but without all the ads. Giant Stuffed Baked Potatoes? Yum! So many burgers and entrees that sound amazing... Soup in breadbowls... Yum."
