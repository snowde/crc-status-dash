Anthony L.,"Riceboro, GA",0,6,,1.0,6/16/2015,"We arrived at 1915 for a table of 8 and were well greeted and took tables in the bar area while we waited for our table, quoted to be ready in 40 - 45 min. At 2030 and after speaking to the host on three occasions we were informed that our table would be not be ready for an undetermined amount of time. We cashed out and spoke to the on duty manager, who offered no resolution, and left. SORELY, UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED. We departed and ate next door at Olive Garden"
Emily J.,"Orlando, FL",127,4,4,5.0,2/16/2016,"BJ's is our favorite restaurant. We came to BJ's for our Valentine's Day dinner to be followed by a movie. Food was awesome and Summer put in extra effort to make sure our food arrived promptly so we could make our movie time. We even had time for dessert! Thanks for the great V-day dinner date, BJ's!"
Ahlaya H.,"Orlando, FL",83,5,4,4.0,1/15/2015,Can you say best Parmesan chicken sandwich ever!!! Bj's food is always on point for lunch or dinner. Not many drink specials but if you do get an alcoholic drink you won't be disappointed!! They have a lot of beer selections too. Never had a bad experience even when it's packed. Servers are always kind and friendly. One of my favorite restaurants because all the food is good.
Jalissa S.,"Chicago, IL",4,8,24,4.0,7/5/2014,"Tonight was my first experience with this restaurant, and I was impressed! I had the jambalaya, and I thought it was scrumptious. My only complaint about the dish itself was the rice. It was as if they tossed the rice in a oil/butter pan prior to putting it on a plate. At first I thought it may be the sauce, but it didn't seem so. The combination of shrimp, chicken, and sausage was appreciated to this cajun/creole fan. I got to sample the House Sirloin that my company had, and the steak was cooked perfectly. Very tender and nicely seasoned. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were also a delight. They weren't extremely cheesy, which was a plus to me. In the end, I would definitely come here again. Our server was as sweet as the lady at the front. He was a true gentleman. It is a little pricy (steak entree: $13.50 | jambalaya: $16.50), but worth it when you have good service and atmosphere... Speaking of atmosphere, it is comfortably lit in there. The eclectic, industrial feel to the decor was super pleasing to the eye and they have a variety of televisions for sports fans to enjoy. Try it out, and definitely get the jambalaya!"
Jackie W.,"Buffalo, NY",3,21,21,4.0,12/20/2015,"Came here with my family, had two servers. The food was delicious we hap pizza and the Mediterranean tacos? I believe they were called yum! Tasted the salmon not the best. One of the servers was absolutely AMAZING his name is TRAVIS! Way to go! It was only his second day out of training and he did a marvelous job. Took care of all the little ones and us! If it wasn't for him the service would've been so crappy. But one of our servers wasn't too nice. He was clearly annoyed that we were a large group of people. I am also a server and know how difficult it is to deal with a large group of people, but get over it, it's what you're here for. (He was a medium sized guy of Hispanic decent.)"
Jeannette T.,"Miami, FL",4,15,7,5.0,12/18/2015,"We celebrated graduation with a large group and were really satisfied with the food. I'm a regular customer at BJ's but I wanted to review the waiter more than anything else. Large groups are challenging, but this young man, Travis, was unfazed. He was not just polite, but cheerful and eager to help. His attitude made our celebration even more pleasant. Thank you Travis!"
Sue A.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,,4.0,7/24/2016,Great service and friendly staff. The server recommended signing up for the rewards and I have enjoyed free desserts and discounts. The family loves coming here and it's our go to place to go out with friends as well.
Carly C.,"Orlando, FL",224,3,,1.0,6/17/2015,"I had horrible service, personally. I got my simple order messed up multiple times with no apology. Food is good, just an unprofessional environment."
Colleen B.,"Orlando, FL",1777,1516,10078,4.0,3/19/2010,"Don't get it wrong... Iambii was def a 5 star... I just can't grasp giving a chain 5 stars.. YET Iambii is the shiznit, she's got swagger!!! She has officially introduced me to my very first beer that I actually enjoyed.  Imagine that... 29 years of life going through various beers that people said I ""had"" to try and I never, ever agreed - always thought it was disgusting.  Today... Iambii said I would enjoy a Lindemans.  She brought me a taste and it was PHENOMENAL!  It was delicious, no yeast taste what-so-ever!  It was glorious.  So not only did I get a lovely salad, spend a nice afternoon with my ladies AND enjoy the NCAA from various TVs... I also was introdued to the amazing service of Iambii and the delicious tastes of lindemans ! I have to quote Ice-T... ""Today was a good day"""
Jessica V.,"Orlando, FL",263,226,233,4.0,4/9/2012,"After a terrible event at Flippers, the girls and I decided we needed a decent dessert.  Something to wash away all the awful memories of the food we were exposed to.. BJs Pazookie?  Don't mind if I do! I had never been to BJs, but have always heard good things about their service and food and especially this mystic dessert called the Pazookie.  Since it was a Friday night, BJs was boppin' and there was a short wait.  Once we got to the table though, service was prompt with getting out our drinks and desserts.  Now usually it seems one Pazookie can satiate two or three people who had just finished a nice meal, but this table of seriously disgruntled and hungry girls ordered three.  If you don't know what this Pazookie that I've been yapping about is, let me paint a picture.  Imagine a freshly baked cookie, piping hot and sitting atop is a lovely mound of vanilla bean ice cream gently melting and getting its deliciousness all up in the aforementioned cookie.  Basic, you say?  Boring even?  I thought the same, but the first bite will move you.   The Pazookie was well worth the trip and sweetened our fowl dining night."
Brahian G.,"Downtown, Orlando, FL",4,8,7,2.0,11/15/2015,"Came her for something quick and good, unfortunately that was not the case. My friends steak came over cooked, but as for me I ordered the soup and salad but that never came... Needles to say I'm still hungry and the server did nothing about the matter. Probably won't be coming back."
Deana S.,"Longwood, FL",90,56,40,4.0,8/24/2015,I must say that the food is quite good here and the location is excellent. However the best part of the meal was the wonderful service that really received from our server. Definitely a nice touch for a quick lunch as they have a tremendous variety of foods.
Conrad F.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,2/20/2016,"I've heard great reviews and recommendations about this place and decided to give them a try... The menu looked amazing and the prices were reasonable. I really wanted to try the calamari and the honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts... After sitting for 20 minutes with no service, still thirsty, and watching multiple servers attend to tables around me( one of them spilling a drink on another patron) laughed and had some great food elsewhere! Also, I spoke to the manager to inform her of what had happened... After I left. Honestly was not very apologetic and didnt seem to worried about her servers. So I would not recommend this place to anyone."
Joe K.,"Orlando, FL",170,104,23,4.0,7/8/2014,"BJ's brew always is a great option for those wanting to get away from the mundane typical pseudo american bar food. BJs is known for their vast selection of brews and it definitely shows. Getting the paddle is always a solid option. I personally recently went for ""happy hour"" just before 7 and they offered 50% off on all their appetizers. Very good deal for tasty selection of foods! The atmosphere is open and there are plenty of TVs scattered throughout the place to allow anyone to have a good view of whats on the tube. The chicken lettuce wrap is great and would be a highly recommended item! Parking can get a little hectic as it's located right across from Millenia so you'll have crowds coming in and out througout the day. Something to keep in mind!"
Matt M.,"Orlando, FL",68,626,318,3.0,7/13/2012,"Been here a few times and had fun each time, but every time I come I always keep expecting more.  Never had the best or quickest service, but never really been bad enough to complain. Their beers are pretty good, but it's not like they're being brewed in the back and they're not $2-$3/pint better than nationally produced beers. The menu reads like an encyclopedia and maybe there is where BJ's goes slightly wrong.  They go way beyond just bar fare with burgers and flatbreads and pastas and calzones and salads and pizzas and ... well, it just doesn't end.  And while I've never complained about the quality of the food, I've also never ordered the same thing twice, as nothing's blown me away. The Mellenia location is pretty nice and well-kept.  The TVs are everywhere, allowing great views of all the sports action of the day.  Been there a couple of times to sit at the high tables by the bar and just watch a dozen games at once. 3-stars for a good place, but nothing really spectacular."
Jackie O.,"Orlando, FL",3,7,1,2.0,10/1/2014,"Food was not good tonight, partially because it was prepared incorrectly from how it was ordered and the pizzookie we had for dessert was overdone (so much so, I actually asked D if we'd ordered a chocolate cookie). Service was barely passable. She was not knowledgeable about how the app works, made us wait longer than we needed to, and who checks on refills for only one person at a table at a time, when all glasses at said table are empty?  Also, if you offer to bring something to the table towards the end of the meal, but you get the payment for the meal, you *still* need to bring it out, because not bringing it will still have an effect on your tip. I still think I gave her more than she earned from us tonight, but here's hoping she was just having an ""off"" day."
Mike P.,"Norcross, GA",87,406,373,3.0,8/19/2012,This is essentially a different take on the Cheese Cake Factory.   A huge menu with good size portions and tastey food at very reasonable prices.  This is a type of place they have so many things on the menu you have to go back and try them.  I would go back to this place to find things I like and they do really well.
Devika M.,"Orlando, FL",5,20,33,4.0,2/19/2015,I just went here with Cassie F. after the Do-it-herself Wine Rack Project at the Home Depot.  We sat at the bar and the bartender Kurt was very cordial and helpful.  He was able to recommend a really great tasting beer (Strongbow apple cider) which I had never tried before.  I also had the stuffed mushrooms. These were creamy and delicious.  Nice mix for a cold night!  I will definitely be going back to BJs.
Terri D.,"Orlando, FL",102,21,6,5.0,7/27/2015,"Let me just say that BJ's is our go to spot.  We love the food, so far everything we have tried has been wonderful.  By far the very best drink in Orlando is her...I am in love with the Raspberry Lemon Drop Martini!  I find excuses to stop by and get one.  We go atleast once a week for dinner because we love the food, the drinks, and the general laid back vibe.  Oh, we also love their homemade Root Beer, so good!"
Alden K.,"Orlando, FL",62,233,89,3.0,6/18/2015,Avocado Egg Rolls and the beer sampler. Order both of these things for a very happy lunch or dinner!
