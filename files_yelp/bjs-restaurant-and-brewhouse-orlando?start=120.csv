Shari C.,"Orlando, FL",3,6,12,4.0,6/26/2014,"Ok food...a little pricey, but good. Nothing spectacular. I had the avocado egg rolls...not that good. The dipping sauce made it horrid! & a small bowl of baked Mac & cheese...I've had better. But try their beignet!!! It's delicious!"
Casandra R.,"Orlando, FL",148,25,27,4.0,12/28/2014,Always can depend on this location to deliver good food and ambiance. Oh and my company is always great
Doug W.,"Orlando, FL",0,53,,5.0,1/7/2014,"I really love going here.  Their food has always been great no matter what you get (but don't expect gourmet), the staff is always friendly and willing to help you out with whatever you need, and the decor is simple and not obtrusive. I especially like that they have their own beer and hand-crafted sodas.  They sell growlers of the soda so you can take home, or as I do mostly with it, give as gifts.  Unfortunately, they don't put the beer in growlers nor do they really sell it in bottles. They have a loyalty club which I'm a part of, but have not taken advantage of yet.  You mostly get money off your next meal with x number of points.  There's also a VIP seat to an event at the upper end of the point redemption, but I'm not sure what that really gets you. I'm upset that there isn't a location over in the UCF/Waterford area honestly.  The restaurants over here are mostly terrible and this would be a fresh addition that would do fantastic!"
Alyssa S.,"Tampa, FL",539,236,169,4.0,11/13/2013,"This is a perfect first date place. Nearly half the customers are first dates.  I love it here, I really like the avocado egg rolls, and I love the chili in a bread bowl.  Don't forget the pizzookie. It's not a trip to BJs without one of there bad boys! I love the white chocolate macadamia nut flavor!"
Linda G.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,7,2.0,8/13/2013,"My Parents said its the last time we are coming. I objected because they give you crayons and a neat kids menu but I'm 15 years away from driving so I guess I have no choice.  I had a chicken wing with Asian inspired sauce which was OK. The sauce was yummy and sticky but the wings were not fried enough so the skin was soggy.  My father gave me some of his Bison burger. It was so dry and overbooked that it reminded me of the time I ate chalk when my Mom was not looking.  My Mother had soup and a sandwich (no bacon - But I saw her frown as she pulled bacon off pf the sandwich) and she said it was ""Bland and Uninspiring"" not really sure what that meant but she was not happy so it must have been bad.  The drinks were good but the server was a bit frazzled.  Overall not a great experience."
Casey H.,"Orlando, FL",31,344,389,4.0,3/11/2012,"Well this was a good surprise. I've never been to this place nor have I heard of it. I noticed right away that the parking lot was full but the place it so big that you couldn't tell how busy it is. We had a darn good waitress with a personality. The appetizers were really good but I have no idea what they were called.  Just get what I put in the picture; lol. For my main lunch, the shrimp lettuce wrap.  Be careful with this one, its got some fire on it.  I was taken back by the heat under these puppies.   I will come back again for sure. Oh - good sports bar too... lets of TVs"
Tatiana B.,"Orlando, FL",37,118,56,3.0,9/4/2013,"Stopped here for a quick lunch with my mom and I was pretty pleased. It was my first time here and I'm always hesitant to try places that have a menu as big as cheesecake factory. Service, however, was extra slow. But on to the food. My mom ordered a cup of the clam chowder and it was delicious. Super creamy and had great flavor. She also ordered the chicken quesadilla lunch plate and she loved it. I went with the half flatbread and salad special. The salad is a mix of baby greens, carrots, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes topped with a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad is very small and so is the flatbread so if you are super hungry don't go for this. However, it was the perfect size for what I wanted. For the flatbread, I went with the California Club which consisted of chicken, bacon, tomatoes, mozarella and avocado and it was topped with a delicious garlic sauce. Loved it! Wouldn't mind trying this again for a light lunch."
Debora V.,"Boca Raton, FL",65,48,47,4.0,3/27/2015,"Being from South Florida we are spoiled with going out to dinner on the weekends late. Im talking a 10pm get to the restaurant late. If you try pulling that in Orlando the restaurant will be closed you are eating junk food. So when I came across this place thanks to yelp researching I was in shock they stayed open till 2am! We got to the restaurant at 9:45pm in true Miami fashion and they place was full but not wait time. Its got an upscale feel yet comfy cozy look. Its my kind of place. The food, amazing! I have the chicken pesto sandwich (pesto is super hard to find served in restaurants fyi) and it was so good. I will be back!!"
David M.,"Orlando, FL",122,224,,3.0,11/2/2013,"I recently visited BJ's for a business lunch at the suggestion of two colleagues and then followed up with a dinner with my son.  BJ's has a sports bar feel (almost) but a far more extensive menu than most sports bars.  Unfortunately, with so much on the menu, the menu can be hit or miss. On each of my visits, I ordered salmon.  The first visit was a great experience and the salmon was among the best I have had outside of a fine dining environment.  The second visit gave me pause, however, because the salmon was a bit undercooked and seemingly flavorless.  I suppose I should go back for a third visit to determine which version of the salmon is the real thing, but the unappetizing experience of my second visit gives me pause. When I dined with my colleagues, they ordered a flat bread and a soup, respectively.  Both were good but unremarkable.  They enjoyed their meals but did not rave about the great experience that they were having.  Perhaps that is the nature of meals with colleagues but I found it telling. Curiously, my son loved his experience (and has since returned), ordering steak both times.  He has repeatedly suggested that we return. Thus it is that I give BJ's 3 stars but I hope that with the passage of time I will return and BJs will earn a 4th star by proving that my most recent visit was a forgivable anomaly."
Jimmy M.,"Orlando, FL",36,29,3,4.0,7/22/2015,Solid atmosphere! Service was great. Our waitress Cailey could not have been nicer. I had the clam chowder and tomato mozzarella salad. Very very good. My kids ate all their food so i know they enjoyed it too. Would definitely come back.
Jason C.,"Orlando, FL",15,33,13,1.0,3/27/2015,i have to post this review because I actually really like this place if the service was (even halfway) decent. But it's been horrible the last 4 times I've been here. yesterday the bartender (male) was incredibly lazy & borderline insulting. sorry...no more BJs (def not this location).
Tommy ..,"Orlando, FL",396,239,99,2.0,1/31/2012,"Went a few times and service and food was ok.  This last time got the chicken casadias and they were a complete joke.  They were TINY, one to two niblets of chicken on each one, you could have stacked them all on top of eachother and ate them all in one bite, they were tiny! Manager came to our table when we complained and said ""you dont need to be rude"" then we just laughed, asked for our check, the meal was comped but would not go back after that experience.  Santa fe spring rolls are awesome though!"
Beatrice G.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,,2.0,8/5/2015,This was my first time there.  The crafted beer and sodas were excellent - burgers are average.  Our waitress kept disappearing and was very slow to bring us our orders.  Had one appetizer and two burgers and it took 2 hours.  Really bad service.  Wont be back unless it's to have a few after dinner drinks with friends!
Varrick N.,"Lakeland, FL",81,119,54,4.0,3/20/2015,"I like BJ'S.  The menu is great, the food is well-prepared and the atmosphere is pleasant if noisy at times. Our salads were delicious but slow coming out.  The ""Committed"" seasonal double IPA was out, and the ahi on my wife's salad tasted off. But we've been here before and enjoyed it so this time not as great.  Our server was a little inattentive,  never asked for a second round nor did he bring requested water."
Blanca B.,"Winter Garden, FL",24,64,209,3.0,2/22/2014,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. One of my friends is obsessed and made me try it. I must admit it, I really enjoyed it. The food menu is never-ending, and everything I have tried has been great!"
Amanda B.,"Morrison, CO",228,74,8,3.0,6/20/2013,"We went with a group of about 7 for dinner during the week and I was surprised to find some of the slowest service I've experienced in Orlando.  The waiter was lovely, but the food took an extraordinary amount of time considering it was a week night and not overly busy when we sat down. The menu offered a great variety of food and some interesting twists on basics. Overall though the food was average, as you'd expect from a chain restaurant.  I ordered the bison burger which had a great taste, but the side of slaw that was supposed to have a spicy dressing seemed like cabbage with a dry spice...it was bizarre. My husband ordered the roast beef dip sandwich and said it tasted good but certainly wasn't enough to make him recommend coming back for another meal."
Stacey F.,"Orlando, FL",18,39,113,4.0,1/26/2015,I went to BJ's this past weekend.  I have been there a few times.  I went for lunch.  The food was good as usual.  I had no complaints.  We did not have a wait.  We came in and were showed to our seats. We ordered our food that came out timely.  Great service.
Vini M.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/25/2015,"Worst experience ever!!!  We went there for dinner the other night and what couldn't be bad!?!?  Started by the waiter bringing out appetizer with no plates for the both of us... We were left waiting for plates and had to ask for them (they were very busy they night so we waited about 10 minutes just staring at our appetizer).  We proceeded to order a veggie pizza and half way thru eating it, we notice w piece of meat on the bottom of the pan.  Yeah, when you're a hardcore vegetarian that's not cool.  We let the waiter know who proceeded to bring out the manager.  I was surprised to hear his solution... Instead of not charging us for the pizza or giving us some sort of credit, his solution was to remake another pizza but just the amount of slices we didn't eat!!!!   WOW!!!!!!!!    Horrible service with a not so customer friendly manager.  I for one will never be back."
Ryan K.,"Orlando, FL",227,219,82,4.0,12/1/2012,"BJ's has a little bit of everything. Their menu is vast; this is true for both food and beer. It is upscale for a sports bar and is humongous inside.  If you're an indecisive person, it may take you an hour just to settle on something considering the novel-ish size of the menu (yes, novel-ish is a word, I created it just to describe this menu). I have yet to find something I didn't enjoy here.....from their hamburgers to their salads, their pizzas and pastas, and even their mac n cheese.....all winners in my book. On a recent visit I found myself sitting at the bar and deep into a convo about beer with the bartender, John. I was surprised at how knowledgeable and passionate he was about beer, something I wasn't expecting at a chain. He gave me some recommendations after I explain what I typically drink and he was spot on. FUN FACT: They have half priced apps and pizza during any football game at bar area which has booths, high tops, and bar seating. GOOD FOR GROUPS: A few months back a friend had a birthday dinner here and our one waiter handled the 12 of us without issue. He was slightly pushy when it came to the drinks but that is somewhat to be expected.   BJ'S, IF YOU""RE READING: Bring back that opened faced meatloaf sandwich!!!! It had mashed potatoes, delicious gravy, and crispy onions.  You have 500 things on your menu, why not 501? It was outstanding in every way."
David K.,"Orlando, FL",69,86,464,4.0,3/20/2011,"Fellow Yelpers, This place has a lot going for it, it is in a good location and a nice establishment that looks fun.  The interior is wildly decorated, a mix of Ale House with TGI Friday's.  If TGI Friday's decor went to a formal event, it would dress up as BJ's.  The service at first was disappointing because I think we were mistakenly sat in a section of the restaurant where the server was on a break because it took 15 minutes for anyone to come up to our table. Eventually service came around and we placed our orders.  I had the Wedge Salad and the Pork Chops.  The Salad didn't seem well put together but it tasted good although it was drenched in bleu cheese dressing.  The Pork Chops were great, cooked fairly well.  It was accompanied by white cheddar mashed potatoes, green beans and sweet apples.   Overall I would recommend this place to others for a quick bite during the night more so than the day.  It just seems like a fun night dinner with a group of friends atmosphere.  This is a brewery so you can choose their own selection of beers.  Not a place for a special night out. I'm outti 5000."
