Katie W.,"Orlando, FL",3,67,151,4.0,12/30/2013,Fantastic food every time. Always impress with the  presentation.  Great happy hour! Half off appitizers and mini pizzas.  I ordered the great white mini pizza. Crust was a little soft to my taste but it was still yummy! The appitizers combo was really good!
Elsie K.,"Orlando, FL",40,83,26,2.0,9/14/2013,"Came here for lunch earlier this week. I got the half sandwich with a salad. It was alright, but nothing to rave about. The things that made me scratch my head were: 1.) The waitress gave me a deer-in-headlights look when I ordered a specialty margarita. She had to look at the menu to see what was in it. 2.) They gave me and my boyfriend a salad each, when his didn't have the soup or salad option. Such a waste of good food. 3.) We were served someone else's food and the server (different from ours) seemed certain we were the correct table. Last but not least, the service was slow. The restaurant was not busy so we were a bit annoyed by this. Would I come back? Probably not."
Pedro S.,"Marietta, GA",37,79,201,1.0,1/6/2013,"If T.G.I. Friday's is your idea of a good meal, then this place will be your mecca.  This place raises all the red flags that you'd expect: enormous menu with laminated pages and creative font sizing, an overwhelming amount of fried food, melted cheese at every turn, and plenty of pictures. And it ends up being exactly what you'd expect: soulless food that came pre-packaged, pre-portioned in a truck and was then fried for ya.  I'll pass; there's enough plastic in Orlando."
Christopher O.,"Winter Garden, FL",383,333,451,3.0,7/31/2011,"This was my 5th or 6th visit to BJ's and of all of them, it was the best one so far.  In the past, every visit has been because someone else wanted to go there so I have gone along for the visit but each one turned into over 2 hours to have a meal.  I have always found their service to be slow and mistakes always seem to happen.   This visit was better but again, something happened to not be able to give it more stars. This visit was for meeting up with some coworkers to say goodbye to a fellow employee who was leaving our company.  I showed up at around 5:30 pm and nobody from the group was there so I got a drink at the bar.  The bar was full so I just stood at the end and got my drink and sat down at one of the tables in the bar area.   In a few min, my group showed up and we all got a table.  The server was nice but was a bit pushy with food.  We came for just drinks and some appetizers but even after telling her this, she continued to suggest main dishes for us to order.  I guess her tactics worked since the group did order more food than they were going to do! I stuck to my two cocktails because I did not have extra money or time to order food.  I could only stay an hour and knew from the past the amount of time it would take to get food.  To my surprise, their food only took about 30 min to come out.  Everybody liked what they ordered and said it was fine.  For me, my challenge this time was that they lost my credit card when I went to pay for the meal.  They were not sure if it got misplaced or was given to another person!  After about 10 min of searching, they discovered it hidden under another card they had up at the bar.  Again, there is always something that happens when I go there so I think it is just me!  Anyway, its okay for meeting up with friends and having a meal.  The pizzas are very good and their beers are also quite nice.  Enjoy!"
Lauren Y.,"Orlando, FL",110,205,648,1.0,8/23/2014,"Disappointing visit, highly anticipated based on reviews from friends. Ordered a skinny margarita and some appetizers, food quality comparable to Chili's. Maybe will try another location because I've heard great things, but none of the appetizers or drinks we ordered were very good."
shannon c.,"Centreville, VA",4,10,,2.0,2/6/2016,"Our family eats at BJ's all the time.  Tonight was our first visit to this location (Conroy Rd.), and I can say it'll likely be our last.  We began by ordering drinks and an appetizer, but never got silverware or small plates and had to ask around before finally getting these things from the hostess stand instead of a server.  Our server, Christie T., was incredibly slow, and extremely rude to say the least.  Based on the temperature of our meals the food was obviously sitting in the kitchen for a while before being delivered to our table.  The restaurant was not busy and appeared to be fully staffed, so there was no just cause for our meals being delivered in such an untimely fashion.  Our server never asked how our meals were either, nor did she refill 2 of the 4 drinks at the table.  I would have asked for a refill had she come by the table other than to bring our semi warm food, but unfortunately that didn't happen.  I wish we hadn't had such a terrible experience because this BJ's is a lot closer to our house than the Kissimmee location, but for better service I'm willing to drive an extra 5 minutes."
Laura C.,"Orlando, FL",12,27,11,4.0,1/5/2015,Overall good and drinks specials( through the week 5$ anything so get crown and ginger ale and it's lovely and it's open till midnight with food and drink specials so I love that. It's a frequent spot we go to and they have awesome apps loooooveee the cute blonde server Lauren I think. She's great.
Bunny P.,"Orlando, FL",283,325,286,4.0,8/1/2011,"BJ's a a chain restaurant with a versatile atmosphere.... you can dress up and go eat dinner here, or just dress in your shorts and t-shirt to drink at the bar. The food is great and the prices are decent. They have a great lunch special for $5.95 from 11am-3pm. The menu is pretty extension and has something for everyone. They brew their own beer there and they're great. I suggest the 8 beer sampler. It's a good amount of beer for about $12 and you can try all the different types. Service is good too. I sat at the bar and the bartender/server was very attention and friendly."
Ross M.,"St. Petersburg, FL",205,393,177,3.0,11/23/2012,"I had a lot of fun here for my friends going away party. In the evening they have 1/2 appetizers. We had some drinks and made a dinner out of a whole bunch of appetizers, did it family style. The staff were very friendly and fun. We ate and drank for hours.  We mostly drank beer. Did a lot of BJ's own brews. I can't remember what mine was called, but they said it was the closest BJ Brew to Newcastle.  We got the spinach artichoke dip, the chicken lettuce wraps, the avacado egg rolls, the crispy calamari, the santa fe spring rolls, the crisp potato skins, and motzarella sticks. 4 of us shared them and drank beer. It was a wonderful evening. Why 3 stars? Well it is a chain. And we did not try anything crazy or exceptional. We enjoyed each other's company more than the food, but we had to fill our tummies with something other than beer. I was tempted to do 4 stars because we had such a good time, but that would not really be fair, because it would not based on the food and service and would not be helpful to other Yelpers.  However, I give you my word, all of the appetizers i listed are wonderful."
Tom O.,"Brooklyn, NY",197,528,46,4.0,12/5/2012,"The food here is great and so is the beer.  The downside is the huge menu- it's kind of hard to know what to get, but the burgers are worth returning for, as are the flat breads. Low calorie options are tough to come by."
Stephen O.,"Austin, TX",280,111,194,4.0,10/24/2012,"You have to get past this being a chain. It shouldn't be hard, though. In my 10 or so visits I've yet to have a negative experience. Clean and courteous, BJ's offers a menu that reminds you of Cheesecake Factory, but because of its variety, not its size. If you're a fan of beers, there is a good selection (don't expect World of Beer, but good) and you'll find all the American classics on the menu. The pizza really is pretty good, too. My favorite time to go is during NFL games when there is an automatic happy hour. That's a dollar off beers and half priced appetizers. I' always sit in the bar area and the service was better at the tables than at the bar itself. So, it you're a stickler for service like I am, go table. 4 stars."
Scott K.,"Honolulu, HI",1492,419,2225,4.0,1/31/2011,So ive been told that this place is owned by Cheese Cake Factory but i havent confirmed that yet. This is a great place to relax as they are open late with a large bar and a pretty extensive menu. The portion size is big so dont order to much food. The price will throw you off as its cheap so you would think that the portion size would be small. I had the pizza which was great. Add some extra hot sause and it makes it even better. Located near the mall and near tons of restaurants on Conroy Road.
Peter G.,"Savannah, GA",0,8,,4.0,2/22/2015,The IPA beers are awesome -flat bread offerings are good -pizza is outstanding. Stay away from the fish & chips.
Cara L.,"Windermere, FL",3,3,53,1.0,1/20/2015,"Disappointed in BJ's policy. Durning happy hour my husband (who is German), my sister and I all ordered beers. We were all ID-ed, my husband showed his German identification card. His ID was taken to the manager, they then requested another form of ID so he gave them his German drivers license. After inspecting both forms decided they would not serve him without seeing his passport.  If your visiting from another country, or waiting for the government to process your paperwork you can't enjoy a cold one without the your passport."
Aaron K.,"Orlando, FL",12,115,65,4.0,8/8/2013,"Man, this place is pretty friggin good.  Went in tonight for a burger and a beer.  Went with their ""classic"" burger which is 1/2 lb patty with lettuce, tomato, and pickles.  Hold the mayo and the thousand island (why is thousand island on a classic burger???).  Don't want that stuff on my burger.  The bun was giant and toasted but was the right size for the patty.  D Beer was also on point.  Had the Piranha Pale Ale.  It had a nice bite to it. Pro-Tip: Do yourself a favor and stick with the wedge cut fries.  The thin and crispy fries, meh. Kind of like the ones they serve / used to serve at Steak N Shake."
Randy H.,"Sandy Springs, GA",207,299,682,3.0,1/17/2013,"I wish I could remember the name of the bartender that had me sample the beer. He definitely knew his stuff. I am not normally one for a wheat ale but the one that was recommended to me was great. The beer selection is enormous. This place is typical to any other BJ's in my opinion but it was still great nonetheless. The service was great, food came in a timely manner and everything. I went during the late night around 10pm, which happens to be Happy Hour Sun-Thurs. Half off appetizers and half off drafts. Well worth going at this time of the night after work. I had the Brewhouse BBQ wings. It is a good bbq sauce. Has a hint of sweet and smokey to it. Nothing special but definitely gets the job done."
Brandy B.,"Girard, OH",1,85,17,4.0,1/3/2016,Don't understand the call a head thing..was told I would have a table when I arrived..arrived no table..said that it just meant I was first in line..idk...anyways 15 min wait..our server was not super friendly but got the job done..like the huge selection of beers..tried two of their house drafts the blond and the pale ale both really good..my husband had two as well and stated that he enjoyed them..ordered the sirloin and shrimp..steak was very dry and to chard on the outside..shrimp came in a cream sauce nothing special..chedder mash tasted bland..the pot stickers where yummy tho...husband had porter house ate it all said it was cooked to the medium he asked for..he loved the Brussel sprouts...my daughter got the mahi mahi and shrimp the fish was cooked well nice mild flavor...my little one got the bj burger large size and good price at 9 dollars with a fry..my oldest son got a club sandwich not much to write home about but he enjoyed it..over all a good experience total bill 130 for five people with four beers and two pops and an app.
Melly M.,"Orlando, FL",148,431,615,4.0,1/7/2011,"We started with Thai Wrap + Flat bread pizza, both were yummy and tasty. Fast service too! I had Tuscan Chicken Limone, it was actually surprisingly tasty, I love Angel hair first of all and they cooked well with olive oil, again it was too much food for me and I boxed it to go. Great place to watch sports and hang out with friends, definitely the perfect atmosphere for groups and casual meetings."
Richard F.,"Orlando, FL",16,59,77,4.0,10/11/2014,Good beer and wine selection available. The wait staff seem friendly.  The food variety is pretty broad. From pizza and pasta to steak and chicken plates. Little disappointed toward the end waiting over fifteen minutes for the pizzookie dessert to come. Our check was already paid and it just seemed that the dessert should have been delivered quicker.
Louis L.,"Tuckerton, NJ",4,145,,3.0,10/25/2015,"A 2nd visit in a week boosted this place from 1* to 3.On Mon pm 10/19,we stopped in after just landing to town,and were please that all night was NFL specials w/MNF on.The bar area was the only side really open and we were happy to watch the (100""?) tv and looked fwd to half price apps and discounted drinks. Opting for some BJ`s brews and my DW the microbrew cream (excellent btw) soda, we realized our waitress,a brunette,while nice was seriously overwhelmed by 2 group tables and whatever booths she had to share with the other (blond) waitress.In the old days,one would feel bad for an overworked waitress,however,in the `chain days`, these 2 waitresses had 2 asst waiters bussing and serving the meals for them. So,it was amazing to me that we (thankfully) ordered our apps w/drinks and receievd them.We advised server that we would be ordering `food` as well. She disappeared. Only when prompted by the asst bussers did she return to fill our empty glasses and take the balance of our order. Even after ordering,she took long to get our rounds. Food quality good,service by this young woman was awful. PS-the mozz sticks were some of the BEST we ever had. --------- Roll fwd to giving this place another shot a few days later: While it was only 2pm,usually a dead time in dining,there were people at the bar and dining.. We like not to be the only ones.  We caught some great lunch specials and food quality,and Bev quality good to vg. What made the day was our cutie server Joann.She was very personable, quick w/refill and pleasant to speak with.We are not locals,but if we were we would go just to see her. We try to hit up BJs in our frequent travels,as we do not have them home. We appreciate the food quality is usually way better than `normal` chains and the brews. We suggest they train the other waitress better or staff up higher during football. In all,if MNF was our only visit it would be a 1*. Our 2nd visit would stand alone at 4*. So we curbed it at a split to 3*"
