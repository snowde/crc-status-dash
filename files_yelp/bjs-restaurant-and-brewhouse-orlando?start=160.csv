Keith H.,"Orlando, FL",199,196,30,4.0,3/20/2012,"I have been to BJ's several times and every time has been pleasant.  I've never had a bad meal and the service was good.  My last visit was this past thursday.  After a yelp event we wanted a bite and stopped in for a bit.   I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread.  it was very tasty!  I like the amount of pesto used as well.  Nothing was overwhelming and it all went together nicely.  I do wish there were more chicken on it however.  Just a few small cubes of chicken was kind of a bummer.    Our waiter was nice, professional and kept us happy, no complaints there. The night scene here can be a little noisy because of the openness of the floor plan, but its a nice design as well.  I like how you step down to sit in the dinning area.  the huge screens above the bar area must make watching your favorite games enjoyable.  Additionally, the rolled up garage style doors inside give it a warehouse/cool/eclectic kind of feel.   They also have their own brews which are decent, a little pricey compared to others, but nothing outrageous.  Give them a shot!"
Meg T.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,17,1,4.0,8/16/2013,"Great place to go with family or with friends or on a date. Roomy, big place with nice decor. Love, love, love their huge menu! Get to pick from so many things. This is our family place to go!"
Sal M.,"Oakland, FL",16,5,3,5.0,8/21/2012,Went for lunch and Had the black and blue burger which was very good. Service was rushed for no good reason. Overall I would go back. Had the cookie and ice cream desert!! best part of the meal.
Tony B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",46,122,66,4.0,7/20/2014,This was my second time here and I enjoyed it both times. Came in with my girlfriend for some drinks and appetizers. The server was nice. I had the BJ's Oasis beer and really enjoyed it. The santa fe southwestern egg rolls are fantastic. My first visit I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was great. This time I had clam chowder in a bread bowl and that was good too.
Tod K.,"Orlando, FL",83,46,,3.0,1/17/2013,"Solid place, though not exactly memorable.  Fook is OK to Good. Beers are OK to Good. I should definitely go back and give it a try when I'm not dieting, because there are PLENTY of decadent-looking fried items that looked quite yummy.  If you're on a diet, this is not the place to be; very limited supply of low-fat and low-cal items.  I was hoping this would be a unique place, driven by the craft beer/from-scratch aesthetic, but it's basically just a chain restaurant with a microbrew-ish twist."
Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,4.0,3/28/2012,"The upscale ale house.  I actually would go back there again because it's different.  The atmosphere is laid back and it is huge with TVs everywhere.  There isn't a game that will be missed while here.  We met up with my sister-in-law for dinner and it was pleasing.  Our waiter looked like Steve Buscemi and he did a great job making sure we were happy with our meal.  We didn't tell him that and he knows now :)  The potato skins were the perfect appetizer to munch on for the three of us.  The fettuccine alfredo was good.  I couldn't finish all of it and I didn't want to take any back to the hotel since I was probably going to forget it in the mini fridge of our room.  Chris realized he left his leftover burger and fries when we were on our way home the next day.  Oops!  After reading one review of the women's bathroom there, I have to go back now.  Thanks a lot, Libby ;)"
Meredith H.,"Oviedo, FL",52,11,9,2.0,9/6/2014,"While I love the food at BJ's and typically my overall experience,my last few visits have had less than acceptable service. Tonight, however topped the cake. As a former server I tend to give quite a bit of leeway when it comes to my expectations. However, our server tonight was absolutely horrible, not only was she was not pleasant,  nor welcoming, she acted annoyed by our very presence. she everything took three times as long as it should to take our order, bring drinks, condiments, etc. I am completely disappointed with my experience at this restaurant"
Stacey H.,"Windermere, FL",1,21,,5.0,7/20/2014,Best Buffalo chicken pizza!! always a great time and great food. also has wifi wich was a plus. good for meetings for a quick lunch.
Sharon G.,"Orlando, FL",9,24,5,4.0,4/22/2013,"Husband and I enjoyed our Sunday afternoon lunch. We ordered an appetizer spring rolls which was delicious, had nice amount of spice to it.  Husband enjoyed a nice Red Ale. He ordered a tomato and cheese and sausage med size pizza. I ordered a Huge Hamburger with cheese and bacon with french fries. We both enjoyed our meals. The service from our waiter was also excellent.  We had dessert and enjoyed a hot chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream, which was pure chocolate delight. There is a great variety of items to choose from on menu, and enjoyed the items we ordered.  I would recommend this place/location to others!"
Thomas M.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",15,22,2,4.0,9/27/2014,"Decent service. Pretty good food. Great root beer. Nothing on the menu wowed me, but it's all worth it. Definitely a return eat."
Jeff N.,"Kissimmee, FL",56,63,,2.0,7/6/2014,"Very solid for frozen pizza,  awful if they consider it fresh. Very bland bad pizza. The place is nice for the average corporate gig but the food is just as average. I'm not in."
Anthony H.,"Clifton, NJ",121,12,3,4.0,7/6/2014,Went last night to grab some dinner with my wife . We ordered calamari  which was delicious . My wife had a mozzarella and balsamic salad which was ok nothing special . I got the shrimp tacos for dinner which were mediocre at best and my wife ordered  Mediterranean pita taco which was edible but disappointing . Service is great and the restaurant itself is beautiful inside oh and the beer selection is awesome . Have to go back a few more times and try some other things on their massive menu but overall it was a good experience .
Robert G.,"Oviedo, FL",10,14,,2.0,8/10/2014,"Food was meh and service was poor.  Went there last night (Conroy location) to get a taste of what the new store will be like that is about to open in Oviedo never having eaten at a BJ's..  My son and I each ordered a cup of chili.  My son specifically asked for it to be steaming when served.  Both of ours came out barely warm.  We asked for hot sauce and the server acknowledged that she would bring it.  It came out after I consumed the barely warm chili.  My son and I ordered a pizza and told the server we'd be sharing.  She said she'd bring two plates.  Only one ever arrived.  My wife ordered the mahi and she said it was ""dry.""  My daughter-in-law ordered a salad which she enjoyed.  The menu looked great with lots of options and the decor was nice.  Perhaps we'll give it one more shot once the Oviedo store opens.  But...not really impressed so far."
Alicia P.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",257,165,9,2.0,9/27/2011,"Every. single. time. I have EVER come here, I have gotten the worst service of my adult life. Ignored, forgotten, left behind, wrong orders,.. it just never seems to end. It's actually embarrassing. The bummer is that the service is SO bad, that it's often the only place my almost-in-laws remember when they come to town. So whenever we have a day at the outlets together, we almost always end up eating here and hoping it will be better. It has NEVER gotten better. I cannot, in good conscious, recommend this place to locals.  The 2nd star comes for the beer, which is actually pretty yum. If you ever get it."
Jordana A.,"Orlando, FL",86,5,17,5.0,7/5/2014,We LOVE BJs. They stay open late and always has the best environment.  Great selection of food! The mozzarella salad is a favorite!
Kenneth F.,"Orlando, FL",46,28,3,4.0,6/29/2014,"Awesome happy hour, their appetizers are really good. If you are really hungry, you can never go wrong with their full rack of ribs. So darn good!"
Mitchell F.,"Deltona, FL",7,66,1,3.0,6/7/2014,"Have the hoppy scottsman beer..excellent! Didn't try the pizza but the hamburgers were were fine, mine was overcooked. Not bad, not great. Service was good though."
James B.,"Orlando, FL",17,3,,4.0,8/17/2014,"BJ's is a hit or miss kind of place. I had a horrible experience at the Daytona Beach store. However, the company went above and beyond to make it up to us. Two free dinners and gift cards galore! It has been good since. Excellent selection of beers available. Their harvest heffeweisen and blonde ales are fantastic. Pizza is good. Haven't tried much more to be honest being a creature of habit. Highly recommend trying the Millenia store or the one off Vineland by Buena Vista. Great service and food!"
Christine P.,"Mesa, AZ",344,448,25,4.0,4/8/2012,"One word: PAZOOKIE! The dessert pazookies are amazing, I never manage to leave here without trying one. The service seems to be hit or miss at this location. Never bad, but seldom great. The food is always excellent, the burgers, salads, and pizzas are always good."
Janene H.,"Apopka, FL",771,1351,2078,4.0,5/25/2009,"After reading several good reviews of the place we stopped in one evening for an early dinner. We sampled a few of their brews, including Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Red, and Stout and liked all but the Stout. Service was quick, attentive and all the food came out correct. The only minor snafu was the server forgetting to bring the water I'd requested, no biggie.  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which was tender and with a great flavor. It might have been a tad dry if it hadn't been for the accompanying lemon Chardonnay butter sauce which was very good. It came with cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed veggies which also good. My hubby had the meatloaf sandwich which was huge and moist. Our toddler got a grilled cheese which he shoveled in and these cute fried potatoes shaped like happy faces.  They have a very big menu; almost too big, with all sorts of food to choose from. It was tough choosing just one thing but when I'm back in this part of town I'd like to take another stab at it. I only wish we couldv'e tried the Pizookie dessert... next time!"
