Rick S.,"Windermere, FL",0,17,1,5.0,8/21/2015,"I love this place. We have been going here for over a year and the food is great, the beer is excellent and nice surroundings."
Andria W.,"New York, NY",81,108,45,4.0,1/27/2012,"The only reason BJ's doesn't get 5 stars from me yet is because I've only been once.  I happened upon BJ's for midweek, well Tuesday, girls night out and we made it in time to catch happy hour; what a lovely treat that was! Half off appetizers and mini pizza's, AND $5 wine... maybe she will!!  I tried the chicken lettuce wraps, which were simply divine, and a barbecue mini pizza. Ugh, I get depressed even now thinking about the calories that were seeping into my body just by saying my order to the waitress, but I smile and am overjoyed thinking of the heavenly party in my mouth once I took my first bite. I mean really, the food was amazing.  I can't wait to return. I am definitely a fan!"
Ginger G.,"Kennesaw, GA",42,23,3,5.0,9/6/2014,I eat here everytime I go to Orlando.  The food is great and they have a large selection to choose from.  I have never had anything here I did not like.  And you HAVE to have the PIZOOKIE.  Best dessert I have ever eaten.
Matt C.,"Salisbury, MD",1,14,5,5.0,7/10/2014,A lot of great choices. Many options for whether you want something light or filling. The food was great and great atmosphere! We were there during the World Cup so watching the fans in the bar area was entertaining. Reasonably priced for great food!
Rene C.,"Knoxville, TN",0,14,,4.0,8/11/2014,"I had a great meal here while on a business trip to Orlando;  I ordered one of their burgers and it was perfectly cooked and more like a high quality steak burger rather than a dried up frozen patty that you usually find at sports bar chains.  We were seated immediately, but service was extremely slow.  It appeared that our server was busting chops and overbooked on tables though;  she was pleasant and doing the best she could with her workload.  I would go back again when in Orlando."
John P.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",980,70,921,4.0,4/2/2012,..they have awesome beers and food here..the in-house brewery has some great beers on tap (craft beers especially) and also the food is amazing as well. the TV at the bar is super-huge is a good place to meet people/meet up with friends

Evan S.,"Orlando, FL",8,8,,4.0,2/24/2013,I got a sample of their own brews.. they were pretty good actually not what I was expecting.  Our server was very attentive and still have refills after we had paid which spoke people don't sometimes.  Food was very good.. my burger was done just right. . Only downside is there is too much on the menu.
Dominic B.,"Orlando, FL",46,130,4,4.0,1/13/2012,"From the co-creator of The Cheesecake Factory comes BJ's brewhouse.  I've been here about 3 dozen times and it's a sweet spot to catch a game on their massive TV wall.  And massive is the trend here ala the CF.  Portions are very large, and I've yet to order anything that I didn't like.  Their ""mini"" pizzas are so fricken delish, as is their parmesan grilled cheese and tuscan tomato soup combo.  IN FACT fellow Yelpers, I'm heading out in T-30 to have just this and a Friday pitcher of their AWESOME craft beers with my dad, who's also a huge fan (and we are FOODIES of the highest sense).  Their Jeramiah Red Beer is tops if you like IPA style strong ales (and watch out - you'll get wasted on this if you are not careful).  All of their craft beers are great to be honest. Service is ALWAYS spot on - just enough and not too much.  The ambiance is very nice too, with them playing top 100 music in the background.  In fact I find myself saying often ""Wow - I love that song!.""   It's like an upscale TGIF but way better if I had to describe it.  And it's big so you typically don't have to wait for a table (though I always eat at the bar as they have that HUGE TV WALL and the bartenders are always so cool). It's fun, pretty affordable, well laid out, and TASTY.  You won't want to skip the treadmill after this however - good luck ordering anything ""lite"" as it is, like it's sister the Cheesecake Factory, a total calorie whore.  Seriously - 1lb loaded to the nines baked potatoes are on the menu and they're HUGE.  But I'll gladly live down my Jeramiah Red beer buzz running a 5k later tonight in trade for that delish grilled cheese and tomato soup.   YUM"
Renee C.,"Natick, MA",0,16,1,5.0,7/21/2014,"Love this place! My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week, GREAT happy hour specials on good and drinks. We got a beer for each of us, a flight of beer, a mini sized pizza and Mozzarella sticks for only $24! Definitely recommend the buffalo chicken mini pizza!"
Roberto N.,"Orlando, FL",117,483,1923,4.0,8/20/2009,"Not just a microbrewery.  Prices are in line with competition. Menu, though, seems to have more of a selection. desserts are magnificent. Some of the dishes really are memorable.  My friends and I have been back a couple of times.  Recommend."
Steve A.,"Eugene, OR",24,55,1,4.0,10/9/2011,"Teetering on 5.. I'm not sure what force is preventing that. The burger melt is tits.  I recommend swapping out the normal sauce for honey mustard.  Suspend your attachment to burgers that have a normal bun, its worth it for this.  I've always thought anything other than a bun was    dorky.  Their dorky melt unlocks dimensions of deliciousnesses.   Nutty Brewnette.    Sup.   I'm not even going to get into the intricacies of the flavor.  I can only say..  SUhhhP.   I wish I could find this on the shelf locally. I ordered the burger and asked for two sides of Honey Mustard.  And.. my burger came with a side of ham in a monkey dish.  This is how ""HM"" was interpreted on the ticket.  Sweet.  Let me get some ham in a monkey dish, please.. so I can select where to put it.   Ha!   I wish every blunder could be that hilarious and inconsequential.  This one made the meal better.  I enjoyed seeing the ham throughout the duration of my meal, there.. in the little dish. Service can be a bit of roll of the dice like anywhere, but I usually get good peeps.  Melissa at the bar yesterday was great and she was super busy on top of it."
Matt K.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,11,3,5.0,4/19/2014,The root beer! Best root beer ever. The variety here is insane the menu is a book! And I have not had a bad dish. The deep dish pizza is outstanding and the parmesan crusted chicken is by far my favorite dish here. Also they have the best pot stickers ive ever had by far. Always a good choice goin to bjs!
Mariacristina R.,"Orlando, FL",251,350,45,4.0,1/28/2011,"Not a bad place to relax for a few beers! I ordered from there $2.95+ mini appetizer menu. At those prices I was totally expecting something really small but I think the portions were decent. I had the fried artichokes hearts with a sour cream type of dip that was pretty good. I also ordered the mac and cheese which wasn't my favorite but pretty filling for a snack food. I also had a glass of the ""Nutty"" beer and it was very smooth, very pleasant to sip throughout my meal. The restaurant feels really huge inside, from the parking lot it looked really busy but it's very roomy inside. Looks like it would be a great place for big group outings!"
Aimee S.,"Clermont, FL",21,15,2,1.0,3/2/2014,"If you want slow and bad service, this is the place for you!  We were seated at a table with a huge sticky spill under our feet, cup and all.  Took forever for the server to come over. He finally took our drink and food order after waiting 10 minutes.  Requested to be moved to a clean table and new server. Waited forever for our drinks.  Our food was served staggered and we received things we didn't order or double what we did order.  Drinks weren't refilled either."
Alex S.,"Orlando, FL",2,55,57,4.0,12/18/2013,"Typical BJs, it's a chain so they are all basically the same. Nothing is absolutely spectacular but everything is good. I recommend the Parmesan Crusted Chicken."
Kelley I.,"Winter Park, FL",31,105,,3.0,11/28/2010,"This is the place where you should eat dessert first...or maybe just eat dessert. The pazookies are pretty good. It's a giant cookie (they have a few different varieties) served hot in a skillet with ice cream on top. Yeah not the most gourmet or fancy but it's pretty darn good.  Another plus is that if you're a sports fan they have lots of different games on to watch. So chances are if your team is playing you can watch them.  The rest of this restaurant is just a typical chain.  The service is just mediocre and is really luck of the draw. One night I was here and it was pretty busy and was in a large party and the service was good. One night it was just me and a friend and the place was no busy and the waiter provided minimal service.  The food is alright. I've never had something bad but I've never had anything that I consider amazing.  I was excited to try their cider, but the taste was really flowery and I'm not sure I'd order it again. Overall, this is a good place for a large group of people because there is something for everyone (lots of menu choices) and a good place to watch a game. But this is not a place I'd be a regular at."
Amber D.,"Orlando, FL",32,50,7,5.0,10/25/2013,Everytime I've come here it's been a great experience. Servers and host are great and it's a good atmosphere
Lola T.,"Sarasota, FL",22,577,174,4.0,8/31/2013,"I love this place!  The lunch specials are a great value..  Food is always consistent, service is just ok.."
Joe C.,"Orlando, FL",62,366,114,4.0,12/14/2010,"BJ's is a good solid restaurant - especially for a chain. The interior is huge and open. Tables are spaced apart enough so that you never feel like you're cramped next to your neighbors.  Decorations are nice, but generally unremarkable.  The food is where they really shine. While most of it tops out at ""pretty good"", I've found that their meat loaf with onion strings (both the regular entree and the open face sandwich) is out of this world. Most of their dishes are large enough to split up and take home an entire second meal. The meatloaf and the parmesan crusted chicken (served over spaghetti which is a little dry, ask for extra sauce) are great examples of this.  While the company brews their own beer, I believe it's all shipped into this location. The ones I've tried have all been decent. They offer a flight so you can try them to find the one you like best.  Service here can be hit-or-miss. Servers are very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu - but it seems that they put their tables all around the restaurant. It may be a while before they get back to you. On our last visit, a large table full of Yelpers (who had also just come from  an Elite event across the street) was monopolizing our server's time while we were trying to finish up and get our check.  Of course, one can't review this place without mentioning the revolving door at the entrance. It's fun. I think it may be half the reason my wife suggests we go here sometimes."
