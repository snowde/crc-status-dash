Isa B.,"Miami, FL",4,28,21,1.0,5/28/2011,"Awful experience! My friends & I went there to watch the UEFA Champions League Final and have a few beers.  This did not happen! First of all, when we walked in, nobody even smiled at us when they greeted us. Second, the first thing we asked them: ""Are you showing the soccer match?"" Their answer: ""Oh (absentmindedly) yeah... we're looking for it."" Instead of just saying: ""We're really sorry, we don't carry that channel."" So we go to the bar, and ask the bartender to please turn the game on. He said: ""Sure, sure right away."" 5 minutes later (when nothing happened), we decided to bail and go elsewhere.  Ended up at Miller's Ale House, where everyone was friendly, we were taken care of quickly and the game was on every screen. WILL NOT GO BACK, EVER!!!!!"
Molly M.,"Orlando, FL",18,45,,4.0,1/23/2010,"Happy Birthday to me! I brought my friends here for my birthday dinner, and some had their first experience, for me it was like 30! I ate at one of these restaurants in California, so I was extremely excited to find one within walking distance of my apartment when i moved to Florida.  My favorite meal is the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad, with grilled chicken, and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls. Enough for three people right there! Their salsa is great too, when I went the other day I had the chips and salsa, and it was excellent. I had the Cajun Pasta when I was there most recently, and it was a great switch from my normal choice. It was spicy and sweet at the same time, I would recommend it any time. The service leaves a little something to be desired at time, but the manager was on hand to check on issues right away, so that was a star in their favor. Great experience overall!"
Andrew C.,"Orlando, FL",5,1,,2.0,4/11/2012,Food was good. But service sucked waited 25 min just to be greeted by the hostess who seated us then another 15 till the server came to take our drink order. will not go back again
Randi W.,"Boston, MA",106,45,1,2.0,9/25/2012,"During football season, I come here for lunch almost every Sunday, but the service is always terrible. This is not the fault of the wait staff -- they are always running around -- it's a management issue for not scheduling enough staff. After today, we vowed not to return and find a new Sunday spot. It took 30 minutes for our server to take our order and people who arrived after us received drinks and food before us. The food is not nearly good enough to put up with this week after week. Management needs to get its act together and do a better job of scheduling and table assignments."
Adam P.,"Toronto, Canada",25,120,80,4.0,9/30/2009,"Yet another chain I didn't realize was a chain, I thoroughly enjoyed BJ's. The decor is modern trendy without being pompous, and yet there is a huge (and I mean huge) tv over the bar area that is visible to all tables. This would be a great place to watch any sports game without the feel of a sports bar. Being a sucker for wheat beer, I ordered the BJs version of it and my wife and I both thought it was really good. Now on to the menu. Being from Canada I had to ask the waiter what the local favorites were and was directed to the area of the pizzas and the baked potatoes. The guy made a huge deal about the size of the potatoes. He said they were the largest potatoes I've ever seen. Stay tuned for the conclusion of that story. My wife ordered the buffalo wing pizza and I fell to the waiters selling techniques and got a baked potato with chicken and alfredo sauce. Before our dinners we though we'd try their sampler appetizer platter. What a mistake that was. Not because it was terrible, on the contrary, it was really good. The problem was the thing was so huge we were full and didn't have much of an appetite for dinner. When dinner came out I was actually a bit disappointed at the size of the baked potato. The guy did qualify that if it wasn't impressive then he'd get two potatoes on there. Although this potato was big, he conceded this was smaller than he was expecting and offered to get me another one. Since I was already not hungry I declined. The potato was good, and if you are a little nervous about getting alfredo sauce on your potato it won't be an intrusive as a taste as you think. Not to forget the pizza, we both thought it was really good although we couldn't give an accurate enjoyment reading because we were so full. In general I would have no reservation about coming back to this place"
L R.,"Clermont, FL",0,17,,4.0,3/16/2013,I ate the BBQ chicken salad delicious . Would definitely go back again! Large variety of beer and friendly staff.
Ricky L.,"Orlando, FL",494,255,1329,4.0,6/4/2009,"I ordered the BJ's favorite mini pizza, a Chicago style deep dish pan pizza with sausage, tomatoes, pepperoni, green peppers, black olives, and more. The mouthwatering pizza was savory and satisfying, each bite more succulent and rich than the last.For dessert, we order BJ's Pizzookie, a fresh out of the oven-baked, rich and delicious cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in a deep dish. We choose the oreo flavor and it was great, the oreo bits delightfully flavored the cookie and the cool ice cream went well with the warm baked cookie. Our friend chose half white chocolate macademia nut and half oreo pizzookie to diversify his tastings. Recommendations:  Mini pizza's Open faced meat loaf Pizookies the""sampler"" of beer you will get wasted another tip: Lunch is especially cheap check out   for pics!"
Kimberly B.,"Orlando, FL",22,91,37,2.0,1/3/2012,"My husband & I tried to have a nice dinner out to start the new year. This was our first time at this restaurant. It looked busy but we were seated right away.  The table we were seated at had the brightest lights ever.  After we ordered, we asked out server if the lights could be dimmed. It seemed all the other light except for  the lights in our row of tables were dimmer and created a better lighting to eat by not to get a sunburn. We then told the person that brought our food out that we would like the lights dimmed since it hadn't been done yet. When our server stopped by to check on our food, we asked about the lights a third time. He said the manager was trying to figure it out. Eventually we were moved to a different table & ready to try to enjoy our food. I had a salad which was pretty good as salads good. It had chicken fingers & a nice honey mustard dressing.  My husband got the fish & chips.  He thought the fish was greasy & not very good. The beer was the best thing this place seemed to have going.  We were not checked on again for him to comment on the fish or even asked when our plates were cleared if everything was ok. I think we scared the server when we asked about the lights so he tried to avoid us.  Needless to say, not a good first impression. I don't see myself going back. They get two stars because I did get full on my salad otherwise..."
Jennifer D.,"Nixa, MO",0,3,,4.0,7/18/2014,From out of town and after poor service and not being waited on at a restaurant down the street we decided to give BJ's a try.  Seen them for years in Texas.  My husband and I had fish tacos and really liked them.  Our kids loved their food.  Definitely a place we will return!
Paulene K.,"Orlando, FL",107,228,260,4.0,2/10/2010,"Great food, great beer, great original Root-beer, great cider, great atmosphere, what more can I ask for? I always knew that they had their own brew, duh ""Brewhouse"", but I didn't know they had a wide selection of  other beers.  I couldn't find a full brew list, they only feature their own brews on the regular menu.  I walked up to the bar and saw all kinds of things.  I made a rare find of Framboise Lambic Ale!  If you haven't tried it, it's a raspberry, truly the sweet, lightly carbonated champagne of the beer world - I guess it's a bit of a ""girly"" drink. My personal favorite is the grilled chicken pasta.  The grilled chicken is always super tender and juicy, never tough and dry like chicken you get at most large chain restaurants.  Although deep dish pizza is their specialty, the others on the menu are delish' too. Ooooooh and you MUST leave room for a pizzookie or two!  If you have never tried it, it's a warm gooey cookie baked in a deep dish pizza pan severed with a scoop of ice cream on top. Mmmmmm~. I like to go there with a large party so we can order a many pizzookies and indulge.  Don't worry if it's only two of you though, there is a sampler pizzookie (plenty to share) with 4 flavors and ice cream on top. 'A cherry on top' - there's several large flat screen TVs scattered through the place so you won't miss a beat of the game or struggle to keep the kiddies busy."
M D.,"Orlando, FL",2,45,14,3.0,4/3/2010,"Service at BJ's is not that great. However, if you are willing to trade off poor service for good food, it worth your time. The Chicken Parmesan is my favorite. The Field of Greens salad is also delicious. The Flatbread Appetizer Pizzas are also good.  Too bad the service is so poor! I would definitely go there more often."
Alisa M.,"Arlington, VA",87,147,134,3.0,2/21/2010,Okay. This is similar to your fridays and cheesecake factory. Decent food. Something for everyone. Price is average. I had lettuce wrap w shrimp and honey crisp salad. Big portion of salad. Enough to share with 3.
L L.,"Baltimore, MD",0,87,,4.0,8/11/2012,"Awesome! Great place to watch sports and have some awesome beers. The beers are actually really pretty good. I'm a big fan of the Harvest Hefeweizen, the Pumpkin beer (when in season) and the Christmas Cru. BJs also has a number of bottled and other draft beers available. The menu is very comprehensive, they have a great selection of flatbreads, pizzas, salads, appetizers, burgers, the list goes on and on. Never had a bad anything here. Only area of improvement: the service is consistently sub-par. None of the servers I've ever had here have been on their game. It's not unusual to wait around with am empty glass for awhile, or to ask your server for something twice.  That being said, this is still one of my favorite places to frequent, service aside. I wish there were more locations around!!!"
Loretta K.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,,2.0,6/30/2014,"Food was very good but service was the worst I have had recently.  After we were seated, no server ever came so after 15 minutes, we went to tell the hostess.  We then finally had a server come over who took our order.  We never saw her again.  Runners brought us our food and beverages and again, we had to go ask for a server so we could get ketchup and drink refills.  Then we waited forever for our check and forever for our change. What should have been an hour visit wound up being over two and a half hours.  And the place wasnt even full.  Maybe 2/3 full, if that."
Rachel O.,"Rockville, MD",85,198,13,1.0,1/8/2012,"This is the kind of place where you need to order the most unhealthy thing on the menu for it to be good.  We had been eating out a lot so I went the greener route and chose the Garden Medley Salad with Salmon.  (Crisp romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, fire-roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese and our balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Available with grilled chicken, Cajun shrimp, flame-broiled or blackened salmon.)  You'd think that being in Florida this dish is probably so packed full of nutrients and flavor.  It was not good.  The vegetables really tasted like they were canned.  MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. My boyfriend opted for the deep dish pizza.  Another gross encounter.  It was so oily and there wasn't much too it.  You know how onion rings have that fried outer layer?  It tasted just like the outer layer. Mom tried a healthy option too and went for the low cal Creole Tilapia (Oven roasted tilapia topped with a tomato olive tapenade and served with rice pilaf, baby greens tossed in our balsamic vinaigrette and topped with shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes.)  It was under 575 calories and tasted like it was.  My cousin went for this juicy cheeseburger and that actually looked good.  Like I said, go for the fattiest item and you'll probably be safe.  We had their traditional Oreo pizookie for dessert.  It's basically a huge cookie with some Oreo flavors and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Eh I've had better. As if the food wasn't bad enough, our server was so bad it was comical.  He seriously looked annoyed that he had to work.  Like it was a personal offense to him that we came to eat because he surely had better things to do.  We also put my newest little cousin in a highchair and the servers/bus boys kept bringing food and other things over her.  I thought her mom was going to have a heart attack every time someone walked by. The ONLY good thing about this place was getting to see my cousins and their new beautiful addition to the family.  Otherwise, no thank you!"
Dora P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",5,72,5,2.0,1/23/2012,Clean look from the inside and out. The service was a bit slow. At one point someone in our party of seven realized that our entire side of the restaurant didn't have any food.  the food tasted ok nothing to write home about or yelp in my case. Their pizookies were just mini cookie cakes. The red velvet one seemed to satisfy more than the Oreo one. Overall not bad experience.
Dan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",436,973,42,5.0,1/9/2009,"What a surprise!  Who would have thought that in an area of tourist traps that there would be a genuine restaurant who gives you your money's worth in food?  To say BJ's menu is extensive would be an understatement.  The variety in their menu is not unlike Cheesecake Factory, although the food and the prices are admittedly far better here.   Walking toward the building, the aroma of above-standard food filled the air.  We walked in, and the place was full of people chattering away in a modern environment.  Despite the perceived fullness of the restaurant, 7 of us were sat pretty much right away.  We started with the avocado egg rolls.  I cannot begin to say how much those hit the spot.  After not having eaten all day due to work and school, these hot and crispy eggrolls with avocado, cream cheese, and other things that I did not bother identifying, really assuaged my ravenous hunger in a tasty way.  The sauce that you have for dipping is perfect.  Don't really know what it is to be honest with you.  It had an Asian flavor to it.  Almost like a duck sauce on crack.   For my meal, I ordered the Cajun pasta.  It was one of the best I have had.  Usually, Cajun pasta comes with a white and creamy sauce, but this one came with a red and creamy sauce.  The taste was awesome.  The chicken on it was grilled to perfection and surpassed my expectations in flavor.  Their use of cayenne pepper, paprika, and other cajun spices was wonderful.  My only critique is that I would have enjoyed it even spicier.   For dessert, we had the Party Pizookie.  The Pizookies are giant and soft cookies cooked and topped with ice cream.  They have six different kinds: chocolate chip, white chocolate chip, ghirardelli, oreo, peanut butter, and oatmeal/raisin.  With the party Pizookie, you get to choose 4 out of these 6 cookies.  We chose the first four I listed.  It was outstanding.  My favorite personally was the oreo, but everyone had a different favorite so...to each his own.   I also tried bites of the parmesan crusted chicken and a California Burger with fries.  Both were incredible.  The Parmesan Crusted Chicken came with a parmesan sauce and sat on a bed of mashed potatoes.  The California Burger came with avocado, green chilies, chipotle mayo, and ranch.  The fries were wedge shaped and very good.  Everything I tried there was good.  One thing's for sure: I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu.  This is one of those restaurants that you go to and find many things that you want to try, but alas, you only have 1 stomach; meaning you'll need to make several trips.   The atmosphere was great...the huge HD TVs make it a perfect place to watch sports games.  The service was about average.  The server was very cordial and friendly but could have been more attentive.  The food runner, busser, and server working together as a team made up for it in my opinion.  That kinda team work can be inspiring.  The appetizer was brought out lickety split, but both the entrees and the dessert took longer than expected.  It didn't tarnish our experience, however, because the food was great, it was relatively affordable, and we were in a great atmosphere with good company."
Claribel R.,"Floral City, FL",54,55,5,5.0,3/12/2012,Great place to watch sports and get some beers
John B.,"Cissna Park, IL",10,136,18,5.0,9/4/2011,"Never met a brewery I didn't like and BJ's is no exception;  Beer sampler is a great value; Jambalaya is spicy like it like it, had it over pasta instead of rice, could have used a little more sausage.  Everyone enjoyed what they at; 3 adults / $100 included drinks."
Brian A.,"Orlando, FL",341,140,5,4.0,9/8/2011,"I've only been here once, and if it's as good as it was the first time then I'd definitely give it 5 stars. I went here a couple weeks ago for lunch. The place is gigantic. The service was great, the beer was good, I had been craving new orleans style jambalaya for weeks so I ordered it, it was out of this world amazing, the only thing missing was the crawfish but it was still awesome. Moderately priced and good happy hour specials."
