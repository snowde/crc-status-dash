Michelle M.,"Indianapolis, IN",136,146,111,3.0,10/21/2013,"I went for lunch on a Wednesday with some coworkers, so not busy at all.  We were waiting on the last member of our group to arrive, telling the waitress it would be about two minutes.  (she really was two minutes away).  And we waited longer than 8 minutes, looking around for her.  When she came to take our orders, I told her up front that I needed to leave in about 25 minutes and that she could bring the check with my food.  I ordered the chicken taco lunch special...so an easy order.  Not only was I last to get my food (after watching her stand talking to a coworker), she also took way too much time with the checks and wasn't flexible at all with splitting our bosses check.  I was already running late before she brought my food and had to shove it in my mouth, not even getting to enjoy my lunch with my coworkers.  This waitress had no concept of time or my fair warning that I was in a hurry.  Luckily the food was good, otherwise I would have rated this place much lower for the poor service, especially for how slow it was in the restaurant...no excuses!!"
Will E.,"East Elmhurst, NY",1,34,,4.0,4/5/2009,"Gotta say, I was a little disappointed with the entree's at BJ's, but that was all made up for. If you go there, you MUST get for desert the PIZOOKIE!  Best desert I have ever had.  You feel like you've died and went to Pizza Cookie heaven.  Absolutely incredible.  A tollhouse chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream that melts in your mouth and leaves you craving more.  Mmm. Good thing we had the Pizookie, cause otherwise this place wasn't great. Service was slow.  People at another table were sending food back.  Prices were so so. Go to this place just for the pizookie!"
Jason H.,"Louisville, KY",1,13,,3.0,11/27/2010,"Okay food, nothing amazing.  Thanks to the slow, disorganized service, we had a two hour dinner with a 2 year old.  This is our 2nd try at this restaurant and it hasn't improved after a year."
Christopher G.,"Homestead, FL",10,5,,5.0,8/19/2012,"The best BJ's I have ever been to so far. Its big inside. The food is ALWAYS quality. The beer is great (and I dont even like beer). The atmosphere during sports (particularly Magic games) is amazing as always. Service is solid and attentive. Great price for the food you get. ALWAYS love the Pizzas and if you want desert, get a Pizookie...trust me its worth it if you have never had one. Love coming here every time I am in Orlando."
Benson S.,"Orlando, FL",1,21,4,2.0,1/20/2012,"I really liked their BJs line of beers. Excellent stuff. But I rate the place two stars because of the food. Typical bland, chain food. If you like TGIFs you will like this place. I'm used to more gourmet type stuff. For just a burger and some good beer, I'd recommend it. For serious foodies and fine dining, it's just not that kind of place."
Kim W.,"DeLand, FL",238,305,19,4.0,12/23/2010,"I finally got to try this place, a couple of weeks ago. For a chain restaurant, the quality of the food is very good. Since I can't resist, I ordered the fish tacos and a Caesar salad. They weren't skimpy with the fish and the two tacos were filling. A spicier sauce would be good, though. I would definitely go back."
Suzanne G.,"New York, NY",99,258,5,4.0,7/14/2009,"This place had really amazing food, if you can choose something in their humongous menu! We had avocado spring rolls with tamarind sauce and the southwestern pizza. Both were amazing! The pizza is Chicago-style so watch out, you'll get full fast. The restaurant was really clean and their beers on tap are really interesting. They have 4 or 5 local beers as well as the regular stuff. The bartender was really friendly and let us taste all the beers before ordering.  Our waitress was a little slow and distracted, but once we had our food we didn't mind."
Ting W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",266,55,445,4.0,9/22/2012,"This is my first time to BJ's Brewery in Orlando for a business trip and I thought it was a typical All-American Bar Grill Brewery. But I was wrong. This place has an extensive wide variety of items on their menu. From deep dish pizza, gourmet burgers, appetizer, gluten-free, and some Asian dishes (miso salmon, sauteed chicken, spring rolls). They also wide variety of seafood and steak for their entree as well as a low-car/cal menu section. I ordered the Miso Salmon: Sautéed with a miso citrus glaze and served with white rice, snow peas, carrots, red bell peppers and onions. I loved the rice. It was not American short grain, but jasmine rice with soy glaze flavor from the salmon. The salmon was a bit dry and overcooked, but portion size was on point. The veggies were stry-fried crispy just the way most asian dishes are. Definitely going back there again to try the pizza and their wide variety of brewed beers. Get there early because it's always packed!"
Barry W.,"Orlando, FL",6,14,2,5.0,7/1/2008,"I definitely suggest this place. It is one of the best local brewery's I've been to. I have been there a couple of times and have sampled their French Dip, Pizza, and Hamburgers.  The best was the open face chili cheeseburger. I had to eat the whole thing with a knife and fork because they just pile the chili over the entire burger. Although this dish probably shot my cholesterol up through the roof, it was worth it! It was huge and by the time I was done I had to roll out of the place. The beer is excellent! I have had them all at one point or another, but I have to say the blond is my favorite. The do have a beer sampler on the menu, just don't be the designated driver if you get it. For desert, my wife and I always get the Pizookie, which is an 10 inch cookie (you can get chocolate chip or white chocolate chip) cooked in a pizza dish, topped with your choice of ice cream. Aside from food and beer, there are a ton of TV's in this place, so it is a great place to watch the game on Football Sundays. Thumbs up!"
Danyelle A.,"Orlando, FL",2,19,24,1.0,7/10/2014,"The 12 of us decided to go here for my brother's birthday, but the service and management was a complete disaster. I started off by giving them the benefit of the doubt because the waitress was training someone else, but the consistent inaccuracies and the comments that not only came from the servers, but the manager, appalled me! We have been to BJ's before and the food and drinks have always been good. I honestly can tell you that this was one of the worst service experiences of my life.  Firstly, they brought out waters and left them on the tray at another table, so they could take another order. After 10 minutes, we had to get up and grab our own drinks. Then, we ordered appetizers. After about 40-50 minutes, our main dishes started coming out with the appetizers. When we said we no longer needed the appetizers, the waitress told us it was the trainers fault because she ran them in, and it could have been a computer error.  About 7 of the 10 meals were incorrect, but we were so hungry at this point that we did not complain. That is, until the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad came out as regular lettuce with no Kale or Brussel sprouts. My friend nicely told the server about her salad and they brought out about 10 brussel sprouts to pour into her lettuce.  At this point, we were there for about 2 hours with no drinks, no appetizers, waitresses blaming the other person, our meals were wrong, the bathroom trash cans were overflowing, and the servers were standing around talking more than serving!  We decided to call a manager over.  My friend explained the situation and about her kale salad.  The manager actually had the nerve to say, "" there is not much kale in that salad anyways.""  He basically looked unconcerned and was shaking his head as if he didn't hear a word we were saying. It took another 15 minutes to get our checks because the split bills were all mixed up and incorrect.  Needless to say, I was so disappointed with the service and how the management reacted!  I have always had good food at BJ's, so that is where my 1 whole star comes from...  and I can honestly say I will not go back for a very long time or at least until there is new management."
Chris K.,"Gotha, FL",4,2,,3.0,11/29/2013,"Great food but while eating at the bar ...got my salad before my appetizer, Entrée before starting salad, then finished plates sat for five minutes before they were cleared.  Dessert was amazing (red velvet pazookie)"
Lauren D.,"Winter Park, FL",19,106,10,5.0,12/24/2010,"Luv this place! cant say anything bad because i never had a bad meal here!  Flatbread is great, roast beef sandwich is great...."
David B.,"Katy, TX",218,95,17,4.0,7/31/2010,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is located near a few other nice restaurants similar in style, but they somehow manage to standout.   The menu has a nice variety of items from flat bread pizza to NY Strip Steak, and a little of everything else between.   Brewhouse is included in the name so they definitely have a nice selection of Brews. A separate menu of beers allow you to read up on the details and make your choice, however I choose to start from the top and worked my way down the list between visits.  I have eaten the MARGHERITA FRESCA flat bread pizza which was delicious and the BJ'S BREWHOUSE BLONDE beer for starters. The pizza was big enough to share between 2-4 people with everyone having 2 -3 pieces each. The beer was smooth while complimenting the flatbread and the atmosphere which included several large size TV's.  Roasted chicken was the entrée I choose for the evening, and it was well prepared.   The service receives an A+ due to the professionalism of all the staff dealing with a large party on a major event night. (Orlando Magic Playoffs).  Overall I would recommend BJ's for a nice place to relax and enjoy a great beer with friends."
Ericand C.,"Orlando, FL",7,14,,4.0,2/19/2011,Bj's is a good place to go when everyone doesn't agree on what to eat!  Their menu is huge!  It has everything for everyone. The pizzas are great and sandwiches are huge!  They brew their own beers and pair them up with food selections if you'd like to try them. They also offer a full bar and take out service.
N. F.,"Butler, NJ",3,60,1,5.0,7/23/2010,"Ate here late night dinner a few weeks back, it was awesome. Plenty of beers that you can sample then order pints or pitchers. Beers range from the light to the dark. The flatbread pizza was awesome as an appetizer. Entrees included stuffed baked potatoes (extremely impressed, 2+ pounds each potato), sandwiches, and burgers were just as impressive.  Plenty of space for a table of 5 which was seated in a booth. There were TVs located on all walls for optimum viewing. Will return on next visit to Orlando."
Tom B.,"Orlando, FL",313,404,8,4.0,6/13/2010,"I must do a mea culpa on Urban Spoon, since I reviewed them a couple of months ago. There, I said that the best things about BJ's were the revolving door and the angled parking. I just gave them another try today since it has gotten good reviews on Yelp (Colleen says it's the shiznit), and it's in my hood.  Dining alone, I began with a light starter, Hawaiian shrimp skewers, accompanied by delicious sticky rice and properly-cooked broccoli, not mushy. From there I went to the Parmesan-crusted chicken with Cheddar mashed potatoes and more broccoli. Between the appetizer and the entree I got a good helping of Beta-carotine and Vitamin C. The chicken was the ""shiznit."" Three glasses of wine complemented the occasion nicely. The music was lively, almost like HUE's disco brunch. The service was attentive and I had a good view of a pretty impressive mural of workers gathering hops from a field. One misstep -- I couldn't finish my entree and asked for a box. Well, I got a box, but had to do it myself, selfish me. How hard can it be for a server to do that? But I tipped him nicely, and I'll be back. It might just be coincidence, but I've found that the service is better when you are seated away from the bar area."
John L.,"Spokane, WA",28,35,3,5.0,9/23/2011,"45 tap handles at the bar! None of them were 'core three domestics' and I don't think there was a repeat. 10 or 12 of their own brews (the Tatanka Stout was excellent). Food seemed similar to a Chili's, but the beer gets it the 5 stars."
Bryan A.,"Orlando, FL",40,174,78,2.0,10/11/2010,"I've been here a total of 2 times.  The first was like 3 years ago and I wasn't impressed.  Beer wasn't tasty and my meal was super greasy although I did get a burger so I kinda have to expect that.  It had been a while and I had heard good things about the place so I figure I give it another chance.  Mistake indeed! Sooo we get there...table for 2 please...and they put us at a 6-top. WTH?!  Kinda strange sitting there with your wife at a 6-top in the middle of the restaurant.  Ordered a few beers, ehhhh still not that good.  The Hefeweizen was gross.  For $5.25 a piece, feeling a lil jipped.  Oh well, figure I would try a few...still not good.  Anyways, ordered two appetizers.  They were probably the best part of the meal.  Wife ordered a salad for dinner, I ordered a $10 chicken sandwich.  I even asked for no mayo and the sandwich came out dripping in butter and grease.  Exactly what I was trying to avoid.  Like, WTH?!  I can understand a burger BUT a chicken sandwich?? Come on!  Then I look around and realize that the majority of the customers there have a BMI of over 50%.  Eating here, I can understand why.  Plus my sandwich came out at least 5 minutes before my wife got her salad.  Really???  Service was slow too.  I ordered another beer (yuck!) when I still had 2/3 of my sandwich left.  Didn't get it until my plate was clean and I don't eat terribly quick.  Ended up spending $70!!!  Wayy too expensive for pub food."
Penelope P.,"New York, NY",15,107,28,3.0,4/22/2011,BJ's is great because I love beer and deep dish pizza. This is location is definitely legit and spacious. The staff were super friendly.
Amy T.,"Washington D.C., DC",1,12,,4.0,1/6/2012,The food is delicious and the beer is fantastic. Love the potroast (though the last time I got it it was a bit overcooked) but the real winner is the thai shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer! So good and a great price during happy hour at the bar - 1/2 off and $1 off beer from 4ish to 7.
