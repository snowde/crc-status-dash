Jeremy B.,"Orlando, FL",156,197,12,3.0,8/11/2010,"This was my 4th time coming here since it opened. Usually the food is decent, their beers good, and the service terrible. This trip the service was ok. I had a mojito and another drink. Both were good. We ordered a pizza for the two of us. It was cold. I mean so cold the little squares of cheese were not even slightly melted. Its curious they didn't notice that. The dough was raw. They took it back and heated it up and brought us another complete pizza and comped us the pizza. It did take a long time. I will say that something like this has happened every single time I've been but it usually has to do with bad service. There are a lot of other really great places nearby, try Crave or Elephant Bar. Both are always good."
Sandra B.,"Lynchburg, VA",1,3,,4.0,10/31/2013,We ate here twice!  Once for lunch and on another day for dinner.  They have a very nice gluten free menu.  I had gf pizza for which they have a lot of toppings.  Had soup and 1/2 baked potato for lunch.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Can be a little loud in the evening.
Diana L.,"Clearwater, FL",82,122,5,4.0,7/6/2008,"Went here for an early dinner after shopping at IKEA and I was starving!.   We chose a booth by the bar area.   The waitress was very friendly and didn't waste time in taking our drink order.   I tried the Berry Burst Cider.   DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND!   It had a crisp, clean, light taste.  Not heavy at all.   Not too sweet or too tart.    I ordered the Fettucine Alfredo with grilled chicken and my boyfriend had the California Grilled Chicken Sandwich.    The food arrived quick. :)    The Fettucine was a nice size portion....pasta with a a thin, sliced piece of grilled chicken on top and 2 crispy, garlic bread pieces on the side.   I would say it was good.....not the best that I've ever had...but not bad at all.   The California Grilled Chicken Sandwich was very tasty...a little spicy with the peppers and chipolte mayonaisse.   Service was excellent and food was good!!!  Left there very content with the food quality and service."
Rebecca G.,"Orlando, FL",32,11,,3.0,7/31/2011,"Dined here for lunch on 7/30/11. I've dined here a couple of times and thought it was okay but not great. On previous visits,I have sampled their beers and did not find them to my liking. It seems since my last visit they have added an extensive beer list. I was happy to see this change. I ordered a popular Belgian beer and the server returned to tell me that it was unavailable. Next,I ordered a widely available seasonal microbrew and again it was unavailable. At that point,I received a phone call that I was obliged to take at the table(I don't like doing this when I'm dining out) and I was distracted. I ordered water.  Our server alerted the manager to the situation and in a wonderful gesture of customer service,she and our server selected another nice Belgian beer for me to try. I enjoyed it very much and was pleased to see their commitment to pleasing the customer. I was not charged for the beer.   On to the food. The menu is one of those that is so extensive that it is hard to make a choice. I opted for a steak salad. The veggies were fresh and the vinaigrette dressing very tasty. The steak was prepared a bit rare for my taste and a bit bland but it didn't ruin the meal. My son ordered the salmon and enjoyed it well enough. He loves that they serve the Smiley Fries well known in school cafeterias.  I have to get him on yelp soon as he has ordered grilled salmon in half of the restaurants in SW Orlando. My husband ordered the grilled pork chops and also enjoyed his entree.   The restaurant is big and open with an attractive mural painted on the back wall. Clean,basic and not unpleasant.   I have to say the best aspect of our meal was the service. I'll probably go back soley based on the attitude of the server and manager who went out of their way to improve my experience."
Lynnsie H.,"Sanford, FL",45,49,,5.0,12/9/2010,This place is delicious!!!! Incredible selection of food!!! Tons of specialty drinks and beers! Awesome atmosphere!:-) I love it
Tasha D.,"San Francisco, CA",229,768,75,5.0,1/29/2008,"I remember when this BJ's arrived, and I knew the chain from California and was like BJ'S I LOVE YOU!!!!  Basically you have to go there for happy hour if you want to have lived a full life.  Couple bucks off each beer, half off appetizers; and you *must* try a pizookie at least once.  Probably only once, if you don't want to die young of heart disease, but that once is a transcendental experience."
roaches F.,"Sanford, FL",0,142,43,3.0,10/2/2010,"Weak service - Great food, lots of choices on the menu, cool big-screen tv is great for Gator games, a really nice place - but, the service leaves so much to be desired. Sat at a table in a half-full bar on a Saturday for 10 minutes looking @ the menu while 11 different wait-staff walked by without acknowledging us, much less stopping to ask if we wanted to order. So odd - the service really is that bad."
Josie F.,"Apopka, FL",3,18,,5.0,11/16/2010,"Great selection of beer... even for me who doesn't normally enjoy it.  My fav is their seasonal pumpkin beer... which is dangerous b/c it sneaks up on you.  Great prices on their happy hour and good quality deserts.  Good place to watch a game if you're into that sort of thing without feeling like you're just in a ""sports bar""."
Justin C.,"Orlando, FL",0,12,,2.0,5/30/2013,"If you live somewhere in the middle where you have the choice of going to the location at The Loop on John Young and Osceola Pkwy...go there.  I've been to both several times and the service is hit or miss at best at the Millenia location.  The worst service was horrific and the best service was just acceptable, but we've never received great service here.  Beer and food is decent.  But without good service....ya got nothin'."
Viviana F.,"Louisville, KY",87,171,91,4.0,3/21/2010,"They have the best root beer that has ever crossed my lips!!! The parmesan crusted chicken is yummy, especially with extra sauce!!   The pizookie's are soooo good.  I like the atmosphere as well."
Philip K.,"Portland, OR",68,195,45,4.0,4/17/2008,"These guys have their pizza down. The GREAT WHITE, you must try it. So good.  The only missed a star because there was some confusion about our table. We were told to take a booth by the hostess, and then another waiter also told some other people to take the table. Lucky for them I am nice, we gave them the table, but it was a pain as I was starving and ready to chow.  And their salad seemed pretty fresh and the mozzerella sticks were soft and cheesy."
Patrick M.,"Orlando, FL",31,46,15,2.0,9/17/2010,Met a friend for lunch.  Staff was friendly and service was good.  I had their specialty BBQ mini pizza.  Was not impressed.  Pretty much all dough with light topping.  I would not order it again.
Melanie A.,"Palm Bay, FL",3,43,2,5.0,5/8/2010,"I went on a Thursday evening for my first visit and I was blown away.  Seated right away, the waiter was pleasant, food and bar service was super fast and really wonderful.  I tried the mozzarella sticks appetizer and they were very good and the Mediterranean pizza  was fantastic.  I also got a mango mojito and it was excellent too. My friend and I got a cozy, high backed, round table seat which was great and semi-secluded.  Definitely trying a dessert next time."
Eric D.,"New York, NY",0,12,3,4.0,7/23/2010,I went here when I went to visit my cousin in Orlando. The pink lemonade is so good ! This place has lots of variety on the menu. The waiter was extra nice =)
Will W.,"Orlando, FL",4,2,,5.0,7/23/2011,"I actually live very close to BJ's and I find myself there pretty often. It is a very consistent restaurant and that makes it easy for me to visit multiple times a week (or sometimes a day). To start they always have super fresh salad greens on an ice cold plate. The California chicken sandwich is one of my favorite entree items and it is always cooked nicely and tastes fresh. I normally don't eat much dessert but the pizooki is delicious. I am a big fan of micro brews and craft beer, so that also makes me a big fan of BJ's own beer. I enjoy all their beers but their nutty brunette is defiantly my favorite of their everyday brews. As far as the seasonal beers the oasis and Oktoberfest are always something that i look forward to and enjoy for the limited time they are available. Not only Is the food great but the service is excellent! The management team is defiantly doing a great job of keeping an energetic positive vibe for the front of the house and it is noticeable. A few of the servers really stand out and are incredible.... But I would defiantly request Eric, he's one of the best servers I've every had at any restaurant."
Anthony L.,"Orlando, FL",139,6,4,4.0,7/12/2010,I've been here a couple times. Food has always  been fantastic as well as service. Bj's own beer isn't half bad either!!
Travis S.,"Seattle, WA",13,75,11,3.0,2/22/2010,"Good food, efficient service, overall very pleased with the value.  I now have another place to alternate for dining out."
Nick L.,"Alexandria, VA",0,1,,5.0,7/29/2010,I love this place! They have great beers they brew themselves. The food is really good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is really good gives you the sports bar feeling.
Rachael V.,"Apopka, FL",0,4,,5.0,6/28/2011,"We live about 35 mins away but make a point of visiting this restaurant with and without our children at least once a month.  I am HOOKED on the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and my husband LOVES the fish and chips.  We have tried other items on the menu but these are our FAV'S.  We aren't fans of beer but LOVE their soda's made with real sugar and brewed right there.  The servers are always kind and friendly, sometimes the service is a little slow but that is only when the place is packed and you can only do so much about that.  We never wait long for our food tho once it is ordered!"
Gary W.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,4.0,7/15/2010,"BJs is a great place to hang out and have lunch or dinner. They have a nice long bar and tons of seating in the bar area and lots more in the dining room. The menu is packed with choices too. I had a turkey burger, pizza, club sandwich and grilled balsamic chicken and they were all very good. As far as beer goes, the BJ beers are great BUT- they don't brew them in house. They have them trucked in. The big tanks in the window near the bar area are only props. Now after saying that, I would definitely recommend BJs to anybody that likes good food, great beer and a cool atmosphere. All in all a top notch chain restaurant."
