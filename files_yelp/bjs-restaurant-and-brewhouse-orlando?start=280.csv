S H.,"Orlando, FL",0,38,2,1.0,1/7/2011,"I have given BJ's two chances and they have yet to impress me. In fact, after my visit last night I will never eat at BJ's ever again. The entire experience was AWFUL. My family is African American and I really hate to assume anything, but we felt like we were invisible when we entered. We were not greeted at all, though the white customers who arrived right behind us received a warm welcome. Normally, I would have walked right out but I was in the company of my 80 year old grandmother and 4 year old daughter so I let it slide. It was downhill from there. It took 40 minutes for our food to arrive which is ridiculous considering they were not extremely busy. My grandmother ordered a veggie burger with wedge potatoes...the burger was dry and the wedges were luke warm. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken but instead received a mushy ball of overcooked pasta. The sauce clearly had been sitting for a while because it was sticking to the pasta in clumps. On top of that it was cold. I brought this to the servers attention and he sent it back. The second plate was not much better and the chicken was dry and flavorless. After a few bites I loss my appetite. The servers attention to detail was terrible...there were no set-ups on the table until our food arrived, he never offered to re-fill our drinks, etc...it was just horrible. My entree was removed off of the bill only after we requested it be taken off. Sadly, on our way out, again we were not acknowledged or thanked for our business though the white family behind us was. Clearly, this is reflection of TERRIBLE management. Crap food + crap service = out of business soon. Do not waste your time or money at this place!!!"
Susan C.,"Lake Worth, FL",117,110,4,3.0,7/16/2009,The Berry Cider Beer was definitely good for a low tolerance drinker like me.  It was quite tasty!  I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  Waiter was attentive so service was pretty good.  Not a bad place if you like beer!

Took 25 minutes just to get served. The beer was the only good thing. Avoid the food in this new restaurant!"
