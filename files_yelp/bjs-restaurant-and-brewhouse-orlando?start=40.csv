Omar A.,"Orlando, FL",31,13,8,4.0,8/13/2016,"You will never leave BJ's Restaurant hungry regardless how much or how little you order.  I have visited on several occasions and tried everything from the light menu to the specialty entree's each time leaving full and satisfied.  The menu overall has several options, from appetizers to desserts, and the bar menu is just as good.  If you are looking for great food, great service, at a great price, BJ's is the place for you. My only suggestion after handling the menu, be sure to wash your hands, the menu can be sticky sometimes."
Deidre K.,"Winter Springs, FL",40,63,365,4.0,10/15/2016,The server was awesome.  He was very attentive and offered many suggestions.  I have been to other BJ'S and this one by far has the best customer service.   Food was delicious.  I love the happy hour appetizers pricing.  The only suggestion I have is that when a server cashes out please make sure the new one that comes on at least acknowledge the table.  Also it's not cool if you are out of a main stream liquor (southern comfort)
Gia N.,"Ocoee, FL",96,22,50,1.0,7/29/2017,"This restaurant is poorly managed and quite a few servers are poorly trained. There is no sense of urgency nor proactivity. We briefly saw what may have been two managers to assist in the seating of a lobby full of guests. Which there was no need for since it was only 2:25 pm and the restaurant had no more than 20  tables full. It amazes me that the fry cook thought that it was a good idea to fry French fries in the same oil as churros, while that would have been fine if frying sweet potato fries to add to the sweetness of the sweet potatoe fries it was not a pleasant taste for regular fries. As a former restaurant manager and secret shopper I observed many issues during our time in the restaurant which was mostly unhappy patrons complaining of food incorrect in some way or the food coming out cold. I also observed a drink runner putting her face very close to a beer to sniff it  for some unknown reason as she was on the way to deliver it to a guest. I think it's time to clean house. The only server worth saving is Travis because you can tell he enjoys what he does and he does it well in a friendly,timely, and efficient manner."
Bob D.,"Orlando, FL",1,76,7,2.0,9/17/2016,You get what you pay for. They have a good selection of beer. Once I found the one I like I always buy it. the 12 - 16  or so beers have are so varied that I believe the idea is you will hit on one you like and stick with it. The food for the most part takes like heated precooked food from a food distributor.  The salad is safe and so is the fish and chips. This is not a go to place for food - at least not for me. The location is good to meet friends form the other part of town. If not I would never go here again. There are a lot of BJs  so they are doing something right for someone . I think they found a market with those who can find something for everyone. They offer pasta to salad to steak - a little a everlasting. Maybe that is why nothing really stands out as great or rather good food. It fills your belly and STOP! Bob
Robert P.,"Freeport, KS",3,3,2,4.0,10/17/2016,"Had the jambalaya.  It made me feel I was in New Orleans. Very good food, great service and the seasonal ocktoberfest beer was good."
Crystal R.,"Orlando, FL",528,277,930,4.0,1/20/2015,"BJ has a great selection of food, their menu reminds me of cheesecake factory. Considering I am living a healthier life style these days, I love the variety of options they have when it comes to healthy food choices. I opted for the Chicken Mediterranean Tacos which were served on pita bread. The dish was refreshingly flavorful. For an appetizer I ordered the avocado egg rolls, which are superb. I have this love affair with avocado and anybody who does will absolutely love their rolls. My daughter ordered the Jalapeño burger which was huge and apparently delicious. Pretty much if you are in the mood for a good beer, BJ'S is your place as well. Like I said the variety on the menu is great anywhere from pizza,fish, and pasta. You name it they got it.."
Natlie F.,"Tamarac, FL",233,175,1545,5.0,7/19/2016,"I love this location. Great customer service. I always sit at the bar. Kristen, the bartender is great. Food is pretty good most of the time."
Heidi W.,"Orlando, FL",37,173,420,3.0,9/17/2015,"After doing some shopping at the mall, I was looking for somewhere to just relax, have a few drinks and eat some food. I hadn't been to BJ's in at least 6 years, maybe 7, so I thought why not. My husband and I sat at the busy bar and we were greeted immediately by the pleasant bartender. The beers that are exclusive to their restaurant are delicious.  We chose to leave and eat somewhere else for a few reasons. The bar had a horrible stench to it. I'm guessing it was because I was sitting by the taps and maybe it was the drain? I just couldn't think about eating my dinner and smelling that horrible smell. The 2nd thing that bothered me was that the manager was sitting at the bar next to me working on the staff schedule or something on a laptop.  These things won't deter me from never coming back. Their menu did look delicious and I did love the beer. Maybe I'll be back in the near future to try again."
Drupattie P.,"Southwest Orlando, Orlando, FL",0,1,,3.0,3/12/2017,First time coming here. Family friendly environment. Food is good. Waiter Jeremy Gibson was very attentive. Price was ok. Will definitely come back.
Cristy S.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",189,137,201,3.0,11/9/2016,"first they brought me the wrong entree, then brought me an entree that didn't have the sauce on it, and there was plastic wrap in my entree so they discounted my meal by half but honestly they should have discounted it entirely... food is okay nothing amazing"
Michael M.,"Orlando, FL",260,1027,1636,4.0,6/22/2015,"Decided to stop by here the other day for the first time. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The staff here is very friendly. Our drink order was taken and delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I guess they brew their own beers here and I enjoyed one which I felt was very good. We ordered a number of apps and a couple small salads to get a taste of this big menu. The watermelon and beet & arugala salads were both very tasty. The fried artichoke was ok, a bit disappointing. The mac n cheese was very enjoyable but the stand out favorite was the carnitas fries. Delicious! I would definately give this establishments another go next Im in the area."
Neff G.,"Sylva, NC",27,2,2,3.0,8/5/2017,"Food was ok, the gluten free selection was pretty good, the service was a little slow. Overall we would consider coming back."
N B.,"Orlando, FL",18,267,38,4.0,5/26/2016,I enjoyed coming here and sitting at the bar.  They have descent beer and the food is not bad.  last time I went the bartender was a little over the top but I can leave with that.   I've been here for rush hour and working in the industry I'll tell you it was refreshing seeing the manager jumping in to bus tables and take orders to help the server.  I tried to tip her but she said that the tip will be for the server because he was working very hard (even tho she took care of my table all the time) the restaurant gets  4 stars but the manager on duty... she gets 5 stars
Jason V.,"Lincoln, NE",3,13,16,5.0,12/10/2016,What a great place. I'm surprised at the 3&1/2 stars I'm giving it 5 because the food and service were on point. I got the pork sandwich with the skinny fries. The pork was moist and flavorful and the bun was toasted to perfection. Quality ingredients at a great price. We will plan on eating here regularly.
Cecille R.,"Apopka, FL",537,960,3424,4.0,6/30/2014,Some friends and I were looking to grab a meal in the area and this one fit the bill. I haven't been in years and I forgot how massive the restaurant is. It wasn't packed so we got a booth immediately with no problems.  Our waiter was very friendly. He told us they brewed their own beers there and also offered up samples of ciders that I was on the fence about.  I ended up ordering the southern fried chicken which came with white cheddar mashed potatoes and a corn/veggie succotash. It was actually really good. I loved that it was a boneless chicken so no bones to deal with. One friend ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and her only complaint was that she requested that the sun dried tomatoes be taken off her dish but they didn't do so she had to pick them off.   Another friend ordered a mini pizza (free with purchase of a drink and when checking in on Foursquare) and a side salad and seemed to be happy with.  Our server did push the BJ's rewards card(completely free) which allows you to earn rewards with every visit . He did mention that one of the perks of the card is that you can preorder your meal before even getting to the restaurant so that when you get to the restaurant the server will immediately come out with your meal! Definitely a plus if you're dining on limited time! I would probably come back again if in the area...great little sports bar/brewery vibe!
Kevin R.,"Orlando, FL",118,167,142,2.0,8/22/2016,"Great service and decent food. Cocktails were 8.75 -- thats just too damn expensive, I'm sorry. I won't be back due to the insane cocktail prices. Overall -- this place is a super expensive!  I got the mediterrian chicken pitas. Very flavorful. I was pleased. Menu was large and full of many many selections. I liked the lighting and the layout of the booths... reminded me of Cheesecake Factory. I would consider coming back -- but not for alcohol! I'm not a cheap person by anymeans, but I was less than pleased with the price vs value -- puny cocktail? Oh ok -- here, take my 10.00!  Lol.  What a joke!  No thanks!"
Lee L.,"Orlando, FL",1,401,435,3.0,5/28/2016,"So I went here a couple days ago. My lady said she had been before and it was OK. Nice restaurant, nice atmosphere and pretty quiet. It was about halfway full and we got seated immediately. We sat at the bar in which the bartender was very helpful and patient. After deciding for about 10 or 15 minutes we decided to just go with the pizza. It was OK. I wish I would have gotten it a little well done but it's OK. Next time if I go back I may try the fish. Typical bar menu to me nothing extravagant"
La V.,"Orlando, FL",36,4,17,5.0,7/17/2016,The service was good the bartender was very attentive and nice. I would definitely bring my family here. Their happy hour was great. The wings are a must try. Got here late and the happy hour ends late@1am. A major plus.
Ashley C.,"Orlando, FL",128,7,,5.0,12/10/2016,What a wonderful place to eat!! The service was excellent and the food was delicious! My husband and I shared the BBQ pork sandwich and my parents has the pepperoni flatbread. We were all so impressed and left very satisfied. I would definitely recommend BJ's for a great meal and atmosphere!
Jenn M.,"Davenport, FL",0,2,,5.0,7/1/2017,The food here is amazing! The menu is huge so anyone can find something to eat but the burgers are the best. We drive past two different BJ' s location to come to this one because the burgers are always cooked to perfection and the staff is always fantastic and friendly! Please save room for dessert you won't be disappointed.
