Angela R.,"Orlando, FL",140,70,108,4.0,6/10/2015,This was our first time at BJ's and we had a great experience! The hostess wasn't friendly or smiling which made me immediately think everyone was going to be rude. I was wrong! The waitress was so attentive and very personable. We started with the avocado egg rolls which I didn't snap a picture because we dove into those thing as soon as they touched down in the table. I recommend everyone get those!!!! My boyfriend got the jalapeño burger and said it was amazing. I got the Mediterranean    Tacos and they were pretty good. We definitely will visit there again!
Lisa N.,"Orlando, FL",152,316,1241,3.0,3/16/2016,"We were driving home from Hollywood Studios to downtown Orlando and decided to stop by BJ's for dinner since we had a 10% discount offer. This was a terrible idea on a Saturday night because the traffic coming off I-4 to I Drive was crazy. Considering that we were in prime tourist land, I shouldn't have been as surprised as I was by how packed the restaurant was at 9pm. My boyfriend is from California and has been to the original BJ's but it was my first time so we had to get the classic dishes that BJ's is known for: deep dish pizza and a pizookie. I also ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms. Service was good although our waitress didn't look as though she enjoyed her job very much. The food came out pretty quickly. I thought the mushrooms were okay but not my favorite. I really just need to stop ordering stuffed mushrooms in general because the menu description is always more appealing to me than the actual dish. On the other hand I wasn't that excited about the pizza initially and it was fantastic. We had the BJ's Favorite and it was loaded with toppings. I was pleasantly surprised that the crust was quite light for being a deep dish. We ordered a small which is 6 slices and were full after 2 each. At that point I didn't really have much room for dessert but we still got a pizookie anyway because I couldn't leave without trying it. I thought we'd end up taking some home but OMG it was so delicious. One bite and I was hooked. We had the cookies 'n' cream and it tasted just like a gourmet Oreo. I will happily return to BJ's to try more of the pizookies and the food's pretty good too."
Mark C.,"Orlando, FL",169,471,650,5.0,5/18/2015,"I must have ordered the most difficult-messy burger on the menu for lunch here. Oh, did I say I was dining with the boss? I can handle Gnd'mah cause she'll just give the  little piglet some old timey schoolin' chit.  The boss, well might not invite ya again if you get too messy?  You think? Sorry all I can't recall what name it was, but this burger did have mayo, pile of onion straws and BBQ sauce plus-plus,  and somehow the standards in there too. Yeah, best to attack this delicious feast between two toasted sauce suckers while sitting with elbows extended and cross legged lying on the floor. Oh well, it was a great burger and the fries were also too good to pace myself like an adult.  WTF!  You only live once; go for it if you're still breathing! I did use my napkin (piles) an awful lot to at least look like I'd tryin' !"
Diego R.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,15,,4.0,5/26/2017,"Solid and tasty rib eye steak for lunch at an affordablr price. Washed it down with a mango brew. Interesting! If you are a meat and potato fan, then BJ is a place to try"
Charlotte S.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",123,119,37,1.0,1/4/2016,"Usually I'm in love with this place. They serve the best broccoli cheddar soup in town. It comes in a delicious garlic bread bowl, which I crave every time I come here. The downside: Apparently they only serve select soups on certain days, which I wasn't aware of. I ordered the broccoli cheddar as usual and when it came, it tasted WAY off. It definitely wasn't the soup I ordered so I asked the waiter and he said they don't do broccoli cheddar soup on [insert day here] so he gave my clam chowder instead! He didn't even ask or tell me.  I am obviously not a fan of any seafood so I immediately sent it back. That is not how you do business, especially if someone could have had an allergy. Thankfully I was not one of those people but it was still frustrating nonetheless. Please please please just let the customer know if you don't have a particular product instead of swiping a different one under their nose and hope they like it."
Kalvin K.,"Orlando, FL",429,1218,2657,3.0,2/26/2015,"I've never been a fan of BJ's to be honest.  It's just been just ok to me, especially at other locations.  This location is a little better than I expected to be honest, which was based on previous locations.  The happy hour was decent and the tomato bisque was pretty much the best I have had from a restaurant.  Definitely will come back during happy hour times!"
Matthew C.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",0,52,,1.0,10/9/2016,"I've been to other BJ's Restaurants which were quite good. This one was awful.  Service was terrible and the food was poor. We each had salads. Seemed like they had been made a few days before. Not fresh, and sorta mushy. Won't be back."
Chyryry ..,"American Fork, UT",49,60,130,5.0,9/12/2016,Bj's never disappoints! I always have a good experience at bj's. The servers are always very friendly. I usually get the pizza when I go. Their deep dish is amazing.
Tiffany V.,"Orlando, FL",184,144,579,2.0,8/2/2015,"I've been to this location countless times and aside from a long wait at times, have never really had a problem. Tonight, I arrived with my husband around 10pm. First of all, it was a good while before we actually even saw our server, but once we did, she was the sweetest person. Still, the problems with tonight were 1) took forever for our food to arrive at our table considering the place was pretty empty when we ordered, 2) no linens (which our server so sweetly apologized for), so we just got little brown napkins and 3) a piece of paper was mixed in with the lettuce I put on top of one of our sliders, which I realized immediately once I bit into it. Definitely not the best experience! I wanted to say something, but our server was so nice and I didn't want to look like I was just looking for something free, to be totally honest. Just something I wanted to post about, since I think people should be aware of the issue. From now on, I'll probably always be paranoid and hesitant to eat the sliders. Disappointing."
Todd W.,"Orlando, FL",429,184,594,3.0,7/24/2015,"Stopped here last night with a friend after her bridal fitting for a snack. We walked into a nearly packed restaurant around 7pm, but were immediately seated. After perusing menu we both decided to just share a couple appetizers with drinks. I'm a beer person and seeing as BJ's brews their own beers felt compelled to try it! I decided on a layered beer, their red beer layered with their stout. It was good, not great. My girlfriend had the ""Pink Cadillac"" martini. She complained that she couldn't taste any alcohol in it. We ordered the calamari and chicken avocado flat bread for our snack.  It took a very long time. Once it did arrive, we were both dissatisfied. Barely any actual chicken on flat bread and more crust than toppings. Calamari rather than being fried crisp and breaded was soggy and soaked with grease. Considering our wait time this food should have been better. Maybe it was the fact they were busy,  not sure I'd eat here again."
Eric B.,"Tavares, FL",53,22,12,5.0,11/22/2015,"Our bartender Kate and Chef Gabriel we off the hook great!  I love it when you get what you pay for;  good food,  good prices and great service.  We ordered and excellent spinach and artichoke dip, pot stickers and grilled chicken Alfredo.  We ordered the Ahi salad that we thought was just a little off and Chef Gabriel came out immediately to get our feedback.  We love this place."
Diadra B.,"Orlando, FL",30,54,70,3.0,12/20/2015,The restaurant atmosphere consist of deem lights with a full bar and a few television sets to view too. The staff was very pleasant and took great care of our needs. This was my first visit to this establishment and I thought of it as an upscale Ale House. The food at Ale House has way more flavor though in comparison.
Jay B.,"Orlando, FL",149,14,9,5.0,5/11/2015,I eat here often and try to get something new each time which isn't hard to do w their large selection I've never had a bad meal and the customer service is always over the top  I even had my department holiday party there
Gustavo A. L.,"Orlando, FL",832,1180,136,4.0,3/26/2015,"Options!! Although i am not a huge fan of the ""corporate menu"", I must say that I am very pleased to see all the options BJ's have to offer. In a world with so many preferences, I subscribe 100% to the policy of ""giving people what they want"". Considering the fact that these places are so well suited for work meetings or client entertainment, it is always a refreshing experience to crack a menu where everyone's preferences are considered. BJ's is efficient and effective as well, whether you are dashing through during a quick lunch hour break or hanging out with friends for a while, the space and environment is conducive to enjoy your meal and your company. Even at busy times, their service has been consistent and this is a huge plus. Let's grab a bite, meet us a BJ's..."
Nicole C.,"Orlando, FL",67,117,76,3.0,7/29/2015,"I've always had good experiences at BJs locations, but this one has a few issues tonight. Very understaffed  (the poor bartender/server was running around trying to take care of everyone that was there) which led to extended time with empty glasses.  Their happy hour is pretty awesome. Wells drinks for $4, which includes Tanqueray for gin.  I tried a bit of my friends carnitas verde fries and they were strange. A weird combination of flavors that wasn't completely off putting but not something I'd ever consider ordering. Also a little spicy for a verde sauce. I'll always return for good food and brews and chalk tonight up to staff issues."
Chris D.,"Orlando, FL",0,19,5,2.0,1/6/2017,"This was my wife and I 2nd time here and this is the reason why we don't go back. I don't understand what is the deal this day and age with service but I feel like restaurants don't care anymore....... we got there and the host was very nice we got seated right away but then it went downhill from there. After waiting 17 minutes exactly we were finally greeted, mind you the place was not busy at all and no server came over to say I will be right with you. So anyway we order our drinks and food at the same time since we have been waiting so long. Our food comes out and it was perfect, don't get me wrong this place has banging food but horrible service. I had to ask for another tea since mine was empty while I was eating my food. I just feel like these server are too busy gossiping or on there phones we can never find a good place with good service anymore:/ sad to say but like I said food was good!"
Kelly H.,"Orlando, FL",771,346,383,4.0,2/20/2012,"I was never too excited about this place, until my last visit.  I must have found ""my meal"" there.  I got the parmesan crusted chicken that has some sort of chardonnay butter sauce on top with sun-dried tomatoes.  I substituted the mashed potatoes and whatever else came on the side with fettucini alfredo.  It was sooo delicious.  I could have ate the whole thing, but the serving was huge (so I settled for taking it home for lunch the next day - which it re-heated perfectly) and I had to save room for dessert -  the infamous Pazookie!   What's a Pazookie you ask?  A gooey fresh out of the oven cookie baked in a round pan (multiple flavors are available) but I stuck with the original chocolate chip.  It comes with ice cream on top, but I get it on the side so my ice cream doesn't melt all over the cookie from the heat radiating off the cookie and pan. They also have a very large beer selection, including their own brew of beers.  Although I find their beer prices a little steep, they're all about $2 more than you would normally pay elsewhere."
Joe L.,"Orlando, FL",1,31,108,4.0,10/13/2015,This is a fun place with good food and great beers. They have their own brand of micro brews and they are very good.
K. F.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,5.0,6/25/2016,Curt always pleasant and attentive at the bar.  Good food and variety of beers to select from.  Fun atmosphere.
Anna P.,"Orlando, FL",166,12,4,4.0,5/11/2016,Most times their service is great. Sometimes it's a little shot but when that happens the managers are more than happy to take care of you. The food is delicious! The cream soda is to die for!!!!
