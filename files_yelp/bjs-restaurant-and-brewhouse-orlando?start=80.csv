Giselle R.,"Davenport, FL",152,7,2,1.0,7/19/2016,"This may have been the worse experience of my life if not close to. I went there last night to meet my friend for a late dinner around 10, went straight to bar as I usually do and the bartender was way too occupied with another patron and even though he saw me walk in and say at his bar didn't acknowledge my presence until he finished the conversation with the other gentleman sitting at bar. When he finally took the time to take me order he was extremely cold and unwelcoming as if he hated to have any customers there at all. I proceeded to ask him about late night happy hour or any specials and je went over the specials quickly. I felt extremely mistreated when the patron he was speaking with at bar mentioned the way we were being treated, even he noticed it and couldn't help but comment on it by saying: ""wow what a way to greet guest"" adding to that more comments as to how he treats his customers at his own bar when they come in, the bartender just laughed it up and at that point we felt so disgusted by it all and cancelled our order and left in such disbelief that anyone like that is in the industry. Hope management takes some sort of action as even look at security cameras to confirm my statement and take the disciplinary actions needed. Meanwhile I will not be visiting any time soon."
Ivy H.,"Miami, FL",0,5,1,1.0,4/5/2015,"This was our first time eating at BJ's.  Our server recommended their ""famous"" deep dish pizza.  We were excited about eating their ""deep dish pizza"" but we were quickly disappointed when it arrived.  We all looked at it and said nothing.  We all tasted it and said nothing.  Then one of us cracked and said, ""I know we were all hungry but doesn't this taste just like Pizza Hut pan pizza?"" We all laughed and said we thought it tasted EXACTLY like a Pizza Hut pan pizza.  It even looked like one too.  It was definitely not a deep dish pizza. Save yourself the extra $10-$15 and order one from Pizza Hut instead. I don't even want to comment on what the kids ate from the kids menu and the wedge salad. We will not be going back."
Joshua S.,"Orlando, FL",1,22,10,5.0,9/26/2015,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to dine in with family, friends, or co-workers. There is something for everyone. I always leave there happy. Great atmosphere."
Kelly M.,"Ocala, FL",3,22,1,5.0,8/5/2015,Not as good as it used to be the soup was like slime . It also smelled of old bar towels . The manager contacted me after our visit and took care of everything .  It's ok to make mistakes if you take time and effort to correct !
Jennifer B.,"Orlando, FL",24,35,10,5.0,4/6/2016,"We love going to happy hour, they have booths around the bar area, so you don't have to sit at the bar high tops. They happy hour ends at 7pm which is great. All apps are half off and they are all very good. Only issue, every time we go seems like the server has to many tables and it always takes a long time to get your order in and your check to the table."
Idalia D.,"Orlando, FL",96,280,48,5.0,12/30/2015,"My boss took me and my coworkers out to lunch and it was my first time here. Finding parking was ok being that it was during the holdidays and it was lunch time. The customer service was fantastic! The place is beautiful, I couldn't stop looking around. They only had a few TVs which is a good thing! I ordered a mini pepperoni cheese pizza with the mozzarella salad. The salad came out pretty quick and it was so good, very fresh! The rest of the food took a lot longer than expected. Even my boss was asking where was our food lol. My pizza was pretty good a bit doughy but nonetheless pretty good. It was not bad in price around $8. Everyone else ordered different things the one thing I did notice was a flat bred pizza that had avacado and it looked good and they said it was good! I wish I got to taste it. I'm not sure what the total was but the prices on the menu looked average. I'm looking forward to visit again and have the flat bread pizza."
Mandy C.,"Orlando, FL",170,115,255,3.0,11/24/2015,"I went for a quick lunch. I got the 1/2 Chicken cobb sandwich, wedge cut fries, and the mozzarella tomato salad. The sandwich was eh. The salad was really good! Cheap and wide variety. The server was nice. I enjoy BJ's!"
Dustin D.,"Orlando, FL",234,182,74,3.0,2/19/2015,"We came here for lunch and enjoyed it overall.  Negative: The bartender took our order with his back facing us so we had to keep on yelling at him. Plus, he wasn't as attentive or friendly as we would've liked.  Positive: the bison burger was tasty. We also enjoyed the decor.  Not sure if we will be coming back as there are TONS of places in the area that give this place a run for their money...."
Patty G.,"Orlando, FL",1,31,1,2.0,3/26/2015,"This used to be a guaranteed go-to for a great meal. No complaints on service whatsoever. The past few times we've been there, the food has been mediocre at best.  I used to really like the fish tacos but they've consistently disappointed lately. I ordered the fish & chips today and it was not great; batter was very dark, like not using fresh oil.  Their wedge fries are ok.  The appetizers we used to enjoy but now disappoint: avocado rolls, potato skins, ahi poke. Meh.  Pretty much only thing I feel confident ordering is the beer & chili bread bowl."
Jonathan T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",69,128,158,3.0,11/20/2013,"Here is another one of my happy hour spots I enjoy. My favorite part is the seasonal pumpkin beer with the brown sugar on the rim of the glass(served around OCT/NOV). Some of my favorites on the happy hour menu are as follows: Thai shrimp wraps, beef sliders, and the ahi. Also, the seasonal beer I mentioned is made in house. They make a list of in house beers. Reason for 3 star rating is that it's ""nothing special"" its one of those easy going happy hour kinda nights!  Happy hour info as follows for this location: Drink: $1 off draft beers, cocktails;  $2 domestic bottled beers;  $3 house wines;  $4 call drinks  Food: 1/2 off mini pizzas, appetizers Sun-Thu 10pm-12am Mon-Fri 3pm-7pm"
Emil P.,"Orlando, FL",1,4,4,4.0,9/10/2016,Bj is a good restaurant. It's not cheap but u get what u paid for. The food was delishes. I had the deep dish ziti it was very good every bite had meat in it and covered with cheese. I'm dream about it later lol my wife had the bacon cheese burger it was a good size and they give plenty of thin cut fries (better than steak and shake lol). I recommend going there if u not worry about prices. 2 thumps up.
Tiffany J.,"Orlando, FL",7,2,,5.0,3/10/2016,"Had excellent service here a couple Thursdays ago, server was very accommodating when we asked to sit at a high top because the booth was a little small for my bf in the bar area. He still served us and recommended an alternative to a drink they did not have anymore. When our appetizer came out after food the manager came right over and apologized and comped it off bill. Server was attentive throughout the meal and without asking sent our dessert over with a candle because he overheard me talking about the fact that it was my bfs bday week. Awesome night out!"
Tracey M.,"Oakland, FL",198,157,302,3.0,10/12/2014,"Had impromptu plans to meet a friend here for a drink.  I have to admit, I was in the mood for pumpkin beer and had already been spoiled at another establishment with Weyerbracher imperial pumpkin ale..... So the options at BJs were a bit of a let down.  We sat at the bar and the atmosphere was great for good conversation.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls and they were yummy and filling."
Jennifer R.,"Orlando, FL",143,524,67,4.0,11/30/2014,"Every BJ's location I have been to has never disappointed! Not even considering the beer, their food is always delicious. My boyfriend and I love going here. A few of our favorites: corn fritters, ANY form of the pizza, the app of fries with brisket on top, and the burgers. Oh, the burgers! Each one is as good as the last. Don't make a fatal mistake either and not leave room for dessert... Get a Pazookie! You won't regret any of those decisions!"
Carolina M.,"Orlando, FL",23,53,43,4.0,2/9/2015,I've been here a couple of times now.  Its decent. They have 2 craft beers that I really liked and good happy hour.  The food is pretty good also and the dessert cookie things are really good.
David W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",159,254,65,1.0,12/12/2014,"This place has some of the worst cooking/food quality I've ever seen. They should be truly embarrassed by the crap they serve. Management is rude, wait staff is slow. Might be the worst chain I've been to in Orlando."
Andi C.,"Orlando, FL",65,245,42,3.0,11/2/2014,I think this restaurant is just okay to be fair though I'm not much into chain restaurants with TVs all of the place.  I thought their menu was not really original and it just took a long time not only just to get our order taken and our food delivered but then a long time for our check.   It's frustrating when people that were seated after you get their food and leave before you.   It just wasn't an interesting or fun atmosphere.  The  food was okay there was nothing really wrong it's just unoriginal.   There so many restaurants like this all over Orlando. One thing they do have is a private room and you could go there with a lot of people.
Brenna P.,"Orlando, FL",85,305,55,4.0,9/25/2014,"no surprise, the beer here is good. It's nice to have so many options. I've yet to find a beer there that is fantastic, but they are all pretty solid and the seasonals are usually fun.  The menu is huge too. It can seem daunting though, with so many choices. The place is big, and my service has always been great. I would love to try the bar area for game nights. I usually don't get desserts, but the macadamia nut pizookie is unbelievable."
Tiên A.,"Columbus, OH",1,21,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I took my family there for dinner on a Tuesday's evening to celebrate my mom's birthday, and it's not like on a weekend or anything, but after they sat us down at the table we waited and waited and waited and ended up waited total of 2 HOURS LONG for our foods! That was the LONGEST wait for our foods ever! I have NEVER waited that long after sitting down at the table at a restaurant like that in my entire life! I will NEVER EVER go back to this restaurant ever again!!!!!!!! :("
