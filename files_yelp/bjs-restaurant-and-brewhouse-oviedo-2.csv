Alina A.,"Orlando, FL",109,164,376,4.0,12/6/2017,"I've been hearing about BJ's for some time but never tried one out. So, after an audition I decided to make the drive out to Oviedo to check this location out.  I REALLY liked the overall layout and feel of the restaurant, it had a more upscale feel to it than I was expecting. Dark wood tones and muted lighting, very elegant! The bar area is fairly roomy, and quite a few beers on draft, both well known brands and crafts, as well as the brews exclusive to the brand. They aren't lacking in wines and spirits either, and I highly recommend the pomegranate sangria or whatever the exact name is (I will say though, I think it's a seasonal beverage. So FELIZ NAVIDAD and have a few of those!) I didn't have a large dinner, but the menu is well appointed with a variety of appetizers, salads, Flatbreads, sandwiches and burgers, and assorted entrees.  I ordered the potstickers and couscous Mac and cheese. GET THE MAC AND CHEESE, it was VERY delicious, hearty, and the tapas portion was just right! Potstickers were ok, they were potstickers :) not much else to say on that! Staff are very friendly, and I overheard talk about a quarterly dinner they host, four courses and beer pairings. I may have to come back and try that out!"
Kathy D.,"Oviedo, FL",299,419,1421,2.0,11/15/2017,"I've been here several times and I am always reminded why we need to stop coming because each time the food has come out incredibly slow. I always tend to order my daughters food first before ordering anything else, wanting hers to come out as soon as it can. It never does, not one single time we have been here. It has come out way after appetizers...  and just arrives with other entrees, and even then it was pretty long. I do specify that we would like her meal come out first, as a parent of a little one and to have a stress free dinner it is much easier to get her fed first.  The food is pretty mediocre, I think the pizza is the only thing that is worth getting. Their BJ Brewhouse burger was was too salty and overall greasy. The boneless wings with sriracha dry rub is not great, I would not suggest getting any dry rub for that matter, flavor profile just does not work. I was really excited to try their fried cheese curds but it ended up being super salty, and a lack luster. The pizookie is a hit or miss. Definitely don't see my family coming back here anytime soon."
S M.,"Orlando, FL",2,28,15,2.0,7/24/2017,"Our 25 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait.  Once seated, our server took our drink order and didn't return to our table for at least 20 minutes.  I actually had to go to the hostess stand to have someone find her.  I think there was an issue with another table but the manager should have done a better job of handling the situation. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  My Quinoa bowl was okay... I have definitely had better food.  All businesses have an off night so I may try it again.  I like the vibe inside....   We shall see."
Megan M.,"Winter Park, FL",48,31,203,5.0,12/31/2017,I don't like giving chains for 5 stars but honestly every time we go here we leave very happy. The food is consistently good and the service is always outstanding. I've probably been to this location at least 20 times. I love the prime rib dip. The pizza is delicious. Our favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushrooms! Soooo good! I also always get the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. The root beer is made there and my mom loves it. They have a wide range of beers and mixed drinks. This will remain a regular go-to restaurant.
Dolly S.,"Orlando, FL",35,125,453,3.0,12/30/2017,This is a chain restaurant.   The food will appeal to the mass.  They have a variety of choices from pizza to fish.  They have an extensive beer menu and a full bar.  Nothing is special but everything is good.
Angela R.,"FL, FL",63,129,304,3.0,4/23/2017,"I've heard mixed reviews about Bj's. I have friends who absolutely despise it, and I have a couple who's favorite restaurant is BJ's. I give them overall 2.5 stars but I'm rounding to three because the flavors weren't too bad.  Alex and I came in on a Friday night to give it a shot, and to my surprise, the restaurant was almost empty.  We stood up at the front for a few minutes until somebody noticed we were there. She yelled to the host that she had people up front needed to be sat. The host greeted us and sat us at an booth.  Soon after, our server came by and took our drink orders. She offered us the house made award winning beers, but it was late and we were already tired so we decided against it and got the strawberry lemonade and cream soda. The lemonade was very delicious! It was thick and seemed to use real strawberries in it. The cream soda was also AMAZING! I'm not generally a fan of cream soda but this one was the best.  It took so long for us to choose what we wanted to eat. The menu is over 20 pages long! We decided to share a soup, which only comes as a one size option and we upgraded to a bread bowl. The top cut out part of the bread bowl was completely SOAKED in butter. Ugh. The soup itself had a good flavor, but there was SO much oil pooled up on top of it.. it was hard to look at. (see image)  As an entree, I ended up going with a Parmesan crusted chicken entree served with broccoli and cheesy mashed potato. The chicken had an okay flavor. It wasn't until I was done with the first piece of chicken that I realized each time I had to cut into it, a HUGE amount of oil seeped out of it and it made me not want the second piece anymore. :( The broccoli was fine. Tasted like normal broccoli. But the potatoes.. have you ever microwaved mashed potatoes at home and you accidentally microwave it too long and it crusts up in several areas? That's how this one was. It was crusted in certain places and was very clearly microwaved.. My entree was overall disappointing.  Alex went with a small pizza with pepperoni. It tasted pretty good! Except it was just a little too doughy for us.  Service was eh. For a dead night with almost nobody there, service was a little slow. I didn't understand why until I noticed all of the night time servers sitting around by the bar talking to other people at a high tops while they weren't busy with their guests.  I'm unsure if I ever want to return to BJ's. I would definitely get something different next time. Something that hopefully won't have a sh*t ton of oil everywhere!"
Jan F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,60,20,5.0,10/2/2017,Second time when passing through area. There are so many mixed reviews. Both of our visits were perfect. I went to the one in Palm Beach. The worst service.  I had the new Peruvian Quinoa Bowl with shrimp. It was so much I couldn't finish it. Hubby had the BBQ Bison Burger. Both was excellent. We sat at the bar and Paul the bartender was very attentive. All over good experience. We will eat here again.
Beau Beau P.,"University Park, FL",30,2,1,5.0,12/2/2017,This was the 2nd time I have eaten here. The first was not to impressed maybe it was just an off day. The 2nd visit was absolutely amazing. Our server Santiago was very very good. We had spinach artichoke dip to start and my wife had a club and I had a southern comfort chicken which was the best chicken sandwich I have ever had!
B T.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,Went mid-week and the service was absolutely horrible. Not only did we have to endure a smart-ass host but also had to wait over an hour for mediocre food. We spoke with with the manager who graciously gave us 20% off. I will never ever go back
Scotty M.,"Winter Park, FL",4,36,,3.0,12/19/2017,Their Chicago style deep dish pizza is not worth eating - go to Giordano's or Uno's for the good stuff. The rest of the food is good - some  is overpriced. We went at a less busy hour and we're seated quickly. Service was good but not fantastic. We prefer Romano's macaroni grill or the rock and brew around the corner or Chili's. May try again just for variety
Rachael H.,"Sanford, FL",222,91,450,4.0,7/14/2017,"We frequent this BJs because we love their late night happy hour after 10pm! They have half price appetizers and flatbreads and they are all really good. Love the sliders, pot stickers and flatbreads. This place is a hit or miss with customer service. Sometime it is really good and sometimes it is horrible so it just depends. My favorite server though is Kylie, she is very personable and friendly. She is attentive yet not too overbearing. For some pretty good American fare and they are a brewary so I'm sure their beers are good too ( dont drink beer). They always have the game on, my husband loves that.  Their BJs reward program is great as well, you stock up on points pretty quickly to get free good. Overall I would recommend them, just depends on your server what kind of service you will get."
Tom V.,"Winter Springs, FL",299,133,58,3.0,3/17/2017,"If you don't drink beer, don't bother.  If you do, this place is pretty solid.  Food is hit or miss, but the misses aren't that bad.   They have a bunch of their own brewed beers and a lot of it is good.  Overall, it's like a poor man's Cooper's Hawk.  Not cheap, but cheaper!  :)"
Rebecca O.,"Sanford, FL",79,66,672,4.0,5/20/2017,"I am giving BJ's a four star rating. When it comes to restaurants, my ratings are usually giving stars to the same in its class. So for this one it would be as compared to Applebee's or to a TGI Fridays type rating. I would say this is my first time coming here and the food was pretty good. We started off with the Parmesan garlic wings and those are pretty good. We also had the avocado eggrolls. Those on the other hand were disgusting and only a bite was taken from one of them and the rest were thrown away. So if you're going to order them don't. Then we ordered entrées. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken with the corn and the couscous macaroni and cheese. The corn was like a ginger or something like that and it was awesome. It had some bacon bits in it that really pulled out the flavor. I also had the couscous which I was more wanting to try it just to see how it would taste. It was pretty awesome. My friend got the deep dish pizza with the meets on it and it looked really good I didn't try it though. Then we ordered the mini Pizzookies sampler I guess it's called. It comes with three mini pizzookies of your choice. If any of you don't know what a Pizzookie is, it is a cookie in a form of a pizza. There's also one that is a monkey bread that they have as another option to choose. We chose the white chocolate macadamia nut, the triple chocolate, and the peanut butter ones. All were awesome. You can't go wrong with a cookie in the shape of a pizza. All in all, this place is pretty good. And on top of that the staff was pretty good. I'd come back."
Colie M.,"Oviedo, FL",13,16,,5.0,12/9/2017,best late night date night ever! we had kayla as a server and she was by far one of the best servers i've had! kept our drinks full and made the best recommendations on food and drinks! great experience!!
Deidre D.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",32,4,,4.0,10/15/2017,Our first time here and it was a group of seven. Our waiter Dylan (his first day) did an amazing job serving us. I ordered the BJ's favorite deep dish pizza... it was delicious!! We also had the monkey bread... yummy!!
Wes D.,"Oviedo, FL",0,3,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Decided to give this place yet another try ending in an abysmal failure. Came in for lunch at a non-busy time and after almost two hours finally got our food, which was cold.  Seriously. Why do I keep giving this place chance after chance?  Every time is horrible."
Sherry B.,"Oviedo, Orlando, FL",103,174,147,2.0,8/18/2016,"Never heard of BJ's until I moved to the Bay Area and repeatedly experienced the worst service and food ever at their Foster City location. The problem there is chains just don't do well in the Bay Area and therefore get the worst employees the restaurant industry has to offer. Now I live in Florida again and BJ's has infiltrated here as well, with better service and food, but still nothing worth writing home about. BJ's is a typical American joint, on par with Chili's or Applebee's. There is nothing on the menu that is interesting or exceptional. 90% of the dishes have meat and/or cheese in them, and were you to remove the meat and/or cheese, there would not be much of a dish left. In other words, animal products are the star of everything, and removing them would leave you with condiments essentially. If you are looking for something ""light"" (as in, not a calorie bomb), you will also have some trouble here. Even their light options are kind of calorie-heavy and again, with the gaping absence of produce in every dish, extremely unimaginative. If you are a vegetarian or omnivore, you will fare better, of course. Good things.... They offer happy hour. Their lunch menu ""pick two"" option is decent. And on my last visit, I simply ordered 3 sides as my main, which they happily accommodated.  All in all, just a really unremarkable chain. I'd much rather eat elsewhere."
Richard K.,"Pittsford, NY",137,138,1343,4.0,1/26/2017,"This is not BJ's warehouse club. It is a chain of approximately 100 restaurants, although I've never been to one before. The restaurant interior is huge, and although the parking lot was full, we were seated right away, and handed our menus. It takes a while to get through the menu, as it is several pages long, with pictures and descriptions.      The drink offerings are  endless. They make their own soft drinks and root beer, which is highly recommended. They also offered several proprietary beers in every style you could desire. We chose a Blonde ale and a traditional IPA, and we're delighted with each one.        It's a sports bar with many televisions, and all your favorite sports bar food, plus a large selection of really interesting variations, and an impressive amount of healthful eating options. Hey has specialty are brussels sprouts, flash fried, with amazing seasoning, and a spicy Siraccha  finishing sauce.        Service was perfect, and we receive just the right amount of attention, with a reasonable pacing of both ordering and serving of drinks, appetizers and entrées."
Savannah T.,"Winter Park, FL",25,10,18,4.0,6/27/2017,"Quiet and friendly atmosphere, the menu is extensive and covers a wide variety of different dishes and appetites."
Megan H.,"Winter Park, FL",184,35,56,4.0,3/28/2017,"We went on a busy Friday night during march madness and managed to snag a table on the bar side (which is seat yourself). The restaurant side was very busy and there was a 20 min wait but their turn around time seemed good. Our waitress was really good even tho she was working a large handful of tables. Our food was good, the drinks were fair price, we were able to enjoy the food and drinks while watching march madness."
Bat R.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,4.0,9/5/2017,We had Keila W. as the server friendly staff great food great beer great price what else do you need? The margarita pizza is amazing!
James R.,"Colonialtown North, Orlando, FL",2,6,3,5.0,5/21/2017,Extremely well put together menu wonderful waitstaff great quality food great beer and one of the best management teams I've ever seen. We will come back with the family many many times again!
Christy B.,"Winter Garden, FL",1,1,,5.0,8/12/2017,"Ask for Kylie J! Amazing waiter, great attitude despite my table entering about 10 minutes before closing, she filled our drinks before we were even finished drinking them and brought us extra ranch without us even asking, just by noticing that we had almost finished it. Really good at what she does. Deserves a raise."
Vanessa M.,"Orlando, FL",96,9,1,5.0,7/15/2017,"My boyfriend and I came to this BJ's Brewhouse and we sat in the bar area with no wait. I'm so glad we did because we got an amazing waitress! Kayla W. made us feel like we were having dinner at her house. She made sure we got our drinks refilled punctually. She was so friendly and hospitable. As far as the food, I ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp. It was on the enlightened menu and was the perfect serving size. I was the perfect amount of full after also having dessert. We ordered the cookies and cream Pizookie and it was delicious and warm! Once again, the absolute highlight of our meal was the amazing service from Kayla W. I would recommend this place for date night, celebrating, or even just a casual dinner. On the weekend, make sure you try to put your name on the list online as it can get pretty busy!"
Lori T.,"Oviedo, FL",31,177,33,2.0,9/16/2016,"Last night, Thursday, 9/15/15, I went to dinner with a friend from out of town and my daughter last night and I chose BJ's since past experiences at this location have been positive.  I arranged for call ahead seating on my phone app and when we arrived were shown to our table immediately.  Our Waiter, Tyler, was quick to arrive and take our drink orders.  My wine showed up quickly as did the other drinks.   He was pleasant, professional, efficient, yet friendly.  My daughter ordered a guac/bacon burger and my friend ordered one of the chicken sandwiches.  Since I'm an ahi tuna fanatic, I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  All food arrived at an appropriate time and appeared nice.  My guests enjoyed their meals a lot and, while the actual salad itself was acceptable, the Ahi Tuna on it didn't taste normal.  It didn't taste spoiled, but just wasn't right.  I've had this salad here before and it was very good in the past.  When Tyler checked on us I let him know something wasn't right with the Tuna.  He immediately asked if I wanted something else and I said no at that point.  He said he would let his Manager know.  The manager arrived and inquired what was wrong and I let him know the situation.  He looked at my salad and said 'well the tuna looks pink which means it's fresh' at which time I agreed, but said it still didn't taste normal and  I wanted them to be aware so no one else could get sick if it were problematic.  He said he would go to the kitchen and try it, asked if I wanted something else, I said no, and then took the salad away.  That was the last I saw of the Manager.  When Tyler brought the bill he looked at it and inquired ""did the Manager mention he was taking it off the bill"" and I responded that he did not and that we never saw him again.  He immediately responded that he would go talk to the Manager since he feels it would be inappropriate for me to pay for something that was concerning.  He returned in a bit stating that he had to talk to two different managers, but did get the salad removed.  Obviously Tyler went out of his way to do the right thing when the Manager apparently didn't find my satisfaction or feedback important.     I will return to BJs eventually to give them an opportunity for redemption, but only because of Tyler's professionalism and customer service.    He should be commended."
Tom N.,"Oviedo, FL",1,24,3,4.0,6/18/2017,Second review.  Gave BJs a second chance.  Sat at bar and had a good experience.  The bbq pork sandwich is solid and we enjoyed the healthy lettuce wraps.  Inhouse drafts were very good.  Thanks for a nice meal.
Julia H.,"Orlando, FL",30,84,152,3.0,5/7/2016,Wish the service was faster and friendly because the food has great flavor when it's served to you while it's still hot (which isn't all the time).  I especially love the veggie burger and Mini pizzas. Unfortunately I've been on many occasions when my appetizer either never comes out or comes out with our entrees.
Candice L.,"North Palm Beach, FL",35,81,70,5.0,8/1/2016,"One of my girlfriends came into town and I had heard good things so I took her here. And absolutely loved it!! Everything! The atmosphere,,ambience,,different styles of seating from busy,,trendy bar to quiet and subdued to a more classic,,lively dining experience. Plus it's a huge place! They have their own beer plus a TON of others including Craft and IPAs but it is not made on the premises. Highly recommend the BJ's IPA!!! Also the Watermelon Feta Salad was off the chain as was the Salmon Quinoa Bowl. Too delicious! The Queso Dip was meh and the chips tasted stale but everything else was sooo good. It is pricey though. However,,I will be back again and again and have definitely found an awesome new spot."
Dwayne O.,"Miami, FL",19,39,8,1.0,1/20/2017,Still here. Granted is a Friday night but waiting one hour for food is ridiculous. Do not come here unless you want to wait forever for your food.
Dejan L.,"Winter Springs, FL",0,1,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Wow is this place overrated. It is very bland over spiced food. For instance, I have tried grilled chicken on its own just to see the quality of it and it didn't taste like chicken. It didn't taste like anything! Probably the cheapest chicken they could find."
Maria B.,"Orlando, FL",86,67,136,5.0,1/31/2016,"I've been here when they first opened since the crew stayed at my previous job at the Marriott hotel near UCF and a couple more times after that. Every time I have been here I've received great service from all the staff. From the time we are greeted to our server and our food. OMG!! The food is delicious!!! My fave so far is the club sandwich with avocado and their Santa Fe salad. Their chicken wings and fries are good too, the fries are thin like steak and shake but thicker then theirs anyways, their fries are really good especially when their crispy yum yum yum!  I have no complaints from here and I definitely recommend this place to everyone who is around the are for lunch or dinner."
Liz J.,"Casselberry, FL",31,2,,5.0,12/22/2016,Had a wonderful meal food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  The restaurant was busy as always but we had an amazing server by the name of Zachary B.  He made sure we had everything we needed and our glasses were always filled.  He served us with a smile.  Very pleasant and carismatic.
Ashley N.,"Westland, MI",56,3,9,5.0,5/6/2017,"Always great customer service and friendly environment. Our servers always suggest the best drinks and beers on tap. Always helpful in suggesting something, BJs has always been wonderful, cannot wait to come back again."
Kevin E.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,20,,5.0,7/22/2016,"I had a great time with my wife and two kids (under 2).  Matt was a great and attentive server but not overbearing. I took his suggestion and got the PM Porter and loved it, definitely one of my new top favorites. We lucked out and came in during happy hour, dollar off drafts and half off apps. The Parmesan garlic traditional wings were amazing! The atmosphere was enjoyable, but we left before 6:30 (we're early eaters). My first experience at BJ's was a great one and I am looking forward to going back next time I am in town!"
Deidre K.,"Winter Springs, FL",40,63,365,3.0,7/19/2016,Had lunch with friends...The chicken lettuce wraps were nothing spectacular.  The tomato bisque soup was excellent full of flavor.  We ordered nachos a new item but it was a nacho Flatbread. Not quite what we were expecting.  Our drinks were empty alot and not consistent.  Other than that our server was pretty friendly.
Evelynn P.,"Casselberry, FL",44,12,,2.0,9/24/2016,"I've been here 4 times in the past year or so. The food always tastes good and the service is decent. But the last two times, I've ended up with horrible stomach pain a few hours after we leave. The first time it happened I thought it was just me, but when the pain same pain came back last night I couldn't help but make the connection. The only thing common between those two meals was the calamari and this time it made my husband sick as well (which also tells me it's not just me). If I ever go back, I know what to avoid. Otherwise, this place is pretty good. It's reasonably priced and they have a nice selection of beer. I only post this review as a record in case we're not the only ones having this experience."
Indoor Air Quality S.,"Orlando, FL",5,8,8,1.0,3/25/2017,Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Today was a quick stop for lunch even though our last visit was horrible. We decided to give them a second chance.  After a 50 minute wait my wife's meal was said to have been remade because it was over cooked.  Unfortunately they must have just left my meal sitting.  It was served to me cold.  They did offer to make me another but who has that much time?  I'm just never coming back.  There must be 5 other restaurants within a few miles. Choose some place else.
Jill R.,"Florissant, Saint Louis, MO",6,60,299,3.0,11/28/2016,First stop in Orlando for a late night dinner. Average Orlando chain restaurant. Cant remember the name of my drink but it was cool. Had the root beer and dry rub lemon pepper chicken wings which were good and pesto chicken flat bread. All in all decent meal.
Dolores M.,"Orlando, FL",1,6,,2.0,3/3/2017,My co-workers and I decided to go and get some food from here and take it back to the office. Well it was less than desirable. The food was cold (fries) and we told them and they replacement right away but once we were at the office we realized that the orders were all wrong. People that had ordered extra items on their food; those items were not there and those that wanted something omitted from their food was there. It is truly sad!! We will not order from them again.
Sandy M.,"England, AR",67,71,35,5.0,4/20/2016,It's always a pleasure to dine here- great food and great management/costumer service. We've been going to multiple BJs for years and always have had a great experience.
