Kristi S.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,,2.0,11/8/2015,"My first experience today. We sat in the bar area and waited a few mins for someone to come to our table. So we went to the host stand to ask for menus to look at and the host states the server will bring it over and to ""be patient."" Our server acted like she was bothered to wait on us but did warm up a little. Calamari was terrible. Wings just okay. I won't be back. I spend my money where I feel welcomed."
Stephan B.,"Orlando, FL",42,78,14,3.0,9/3/2014,"It's ok.  I mean, if you like beer, the selection is nice.  Staff is friendly.  I didn't like the atmosphere.   Its one large room.  Everything is very loud.  The ask for your cell phone number if there is a wait and text you when your table is ready.  That's kinda cool, but I have to wonder if I'm going to be re-marketed soon.   Food was good, but its rather pricey.  Its the kind of place you want to go to to say you have been there."
Jorestela M.,"New York, NY",0,4,8,5.0,12/8/2014,"First time, went for my moms birthday. We ended up with a great server, can't quite remember her name unfortunately. Food was good, loved the layout and all the beer choices. There chocolate macadamia nut dessert is to die for, must have!"
Jeffrey F.,"Oviedo, FL",1,24,,5.0,5/15/2016,Great food. Excellent service and a wonderful bonus app.  Have been here many times and have never been disappointed.
Brian C.,"Goose Creek, SC",109,23,16,5.0,10/16/2014,"Excellent dining experience. We visited BJs to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary. The beer selection is awesome and our food was wonderful! We each had a burger and the buns steal the show. The thin cut fries were perfectly crisp and tasty. We will definitely plan a return trip. Our waitress Amanda did a fantastic job as well. Finally, we did used the App for priority seating. Unlike other reviews, this worked great for us and waited maybe 5 minutes."
Paul S.,"Orlando, FL",18,113,,4.0,1/12/2015,We have been to the one down by the Millennium Mall and had a great experience so we wanted to try this one. Still a little shaky at the hostess stand as other mentioned. Luckily we arrived before the big crowds. Apparently they use your cell phone number to page you but they never asked for my number!   We were sat after 15 min so it gave me a chance to visit the bar which was a great experience - beer and service. At dinner service was good and the food was delicious. We will return.
Lisa G.,"Milan, MI",47,34,17,3.0,8/7/2015,"I would have to say everything is average. I had a flight of their beer. I tried the nutty brewnette, jeremiah red, oasis amber, and harvest hefeweizen. The nutty brewnette was my favorite and the only one that stood out to me, everything else was meh. We got the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. It was a nice touch that they tried to sprinkle cheese over them but didn't really make a difference in taste. My husband got the crispy jalapeno burger and I got the personal size buffalo chicken pizza. We split both meals. The burger was ok, it's been less than a week and I honestly can't remember how it tastes. The pizza was good but our pizza had a barbecue base and buffalo chicken on top. I think someone in the kitchen got confused. I saved one bite to show the bartender but told her clearly it wasn't a problem since we ate the rest of it. I would like to know how it tastes just as buffalo though because it wasn't bad! I had a small personal cookies and cream pizookie as a dessert. It was way too much food but we were visiting from out of town so pushed our bodies to the brink of diabetes and alcoholism the entire trip. The pizookie was good. I would maybe just go for a couple beers and dessert."
Nancy S.,"Oviedo, FL",9,46,,2.0,3/17/2016,"I really hate giving bad reviews, but something was very wrong today. The good news, we called ahead for a party of 8 and were seated immediately. Then it went downhill. Our waitress was way too preoccupied with their rewards card and gave many long explanations about how it worked, repeatedly returning with additional conversation about it. Meanwhile, she was asked to get our order in because a few of us had time constraints. She did expedite one of the orders, an appetizer. However, when the rest of the food came, everyone who had french fries commented that they were cold. Two meals were sent back because they were too cold. The manager willingly made adjustments to those bills. Food ""average to below average"". Service ""distracted"". I won't take this restaurant off my list, but it will be awhile before I return. I can' t imagine the experience if they had been busy."
Bob K.,"Oviedo, FL",30,19,27,4.0,9/25/2015,Went for Happy hour and was surprised by wide variety of items at half price ...root beer glazed wings were very tasty... Would have been better if more char after glazed... Deep dish pie was very tasty...calamari non-event..drinks priced and poured nicely..Service okay..sat at bar ..
Captain D.,"Winter Springs, FL",287,40,32,3.0,6/22/2015,First time here and it was okay. The menu is way to big and usually that means average food. The tuna appetizer was okay but very small. The wedge salad was okay with the blue cheese and balsamic glaze combined. There could of been a few more tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles. The buffalo burger was decent. The hand crafted root beer was really good. Really a 2.8 star rating. Probably better for wings and beer. I will give it another try but did not have anything other than the root beer that made me say wow. The server was pleasant and attentive and I give her 4 stars. There are plenty of TV sets to watch sports.  Not much on Monday right now unless you like watching paint dry. That means soccer was on. Prices were a little bit more than I expected.  Maybe one more try but will not be a regular stop. Too many places better.
janice c.,"Temple City, CA",0,30,13,2.0,4/27/2015,"Our family and I are regulars at BJ's.  I've gone for my birthday, special occasions,  and have been a consistent fan of the food and atmosphere even before a restraunt had opened up in Florida.  However,  overtime ( been eating there since about 1997) quality in management, menu options, food,  and the overall service I've unfortunately called off my long lasting infatuation.  It's just a typical chain restaurant now and I wonder how fresh is this food?  At Oviedo FL I purchased a pizza not made to my order=( when I asked them to address the situation they answered with: We'll put it back in the oven for you with the missing toppings.  Sorry but I'll pass on an overcooked pizza.  As compensation they promised my family complimentary mozzarella sticks because they could prepare them quickly.  After waiting for nearly twenty minutes my daughter and son and I became agitated and rather hungry. When I asked about our mozzarella sticks they had apparently,  not even put in the order to make them.  (needed manager approval)  Where is the manager?  K at this point I've turned to near starvation so imagine my little ones?!!.!  I hope that things turn around at Oviedo location and management re-evaluate how BJ's were originally meant to be.  FAIR ONLY"
C S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,17,1,1.0,1/13/2015,"Ordered a couple salads and a couple burgers, had to send two meals back, fries were cold when the food came out.  Service wasn't that good."
Meredith S.,"Heathrow, FL",0,3,3,1.0,11/11/2014,"We waited 60 minutes on a Tuesday evening (5:40 -6:40) for a table for 9 using their 'call ahead seating' just to have our table given away to a group that just happened to get to the hostess station a fraction of a second before us...adding an additional 10-15 minutes on to our wait.  Once seated we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks which were served after a late-comer to our party received her order. This is also after we were served our appetizers without being given any silverware. When we were finally able to get someone's attention to ask for silverware, we were told to wait. Silverware arrived just in time for us to eat our cold, rubbery calamari. We complained to the manager. He was going to check on the status of our meals and get back to us. We never saw him again...30-40 minutes went by... When our meals finally arrived they were served staggered. I had finished my mediocre burger before my husband was even served his 'Pizza Hut' style & tasting pizza. Half of our party was trying to get their check (which took 30 minutes & 3 times to get it correct mind you) before my husband was even served.  My poor daughter-in-law had the worst birthday dinner ever. We will never be wasting our time or  money here ever again. Disappointed is an understatement."
Phil B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,2,,1.0,11/28/2014,"Don't waste your time here; waited 30 minutes with a 20 yr old hostess letting others go in front of us. We're from out of town so we didn't know anything about a ""preferred customer card""; just thought it was rude to let several parties walk in and be seated ahead of our family."
G S.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",0,4,3,1.0,12/15/2015,"Visited the Oviedo location for dinner Sunday night expecting to have a nice dinner with some friends. Five minutes into our dinning experience a server spilled an entire tray of beer and other alcoholic beverages on me and across our table. I was wearing a brand new jacket purchased only hours before coming to the restaurant, which was water repellant and repelled the drinks spilt on the out side of it. However, the inside lining of the jacket was soaked with beer, as was the rest of my clothes and shoes.  The server handed me a wet rag to dry my self off with after cleaning the floor with it, and said it was a good thing my jacket was water repellent. No, one apologized for anything, and they charged extra for replacing the drink the server knocked over with the tray of drinks spilt on me! I was speechless, enraged, soaking wet, and smelt like beer as I left the restaurant and no one was concerned. My friends with me felt terrible for recommending the establishment and said something to an employee as we left. To say I am disappointed in my dinning experience would be an understatement, and my jacket is destroyed and still smells like beer after washing it. Unbelievable... Possibly the worst service I have ever had and the food did not impress me either. Save your money or treat a friend and go to Chili's across the street, twice the service at half the price."
Schannon B.,"Jacksonville, FL",35,123,128,4.0,4/14/2015,"My boyfriends family and I decided on BJ's for veterans day as both of these gentleman are American heroes and deserve to eat like it. The guys ordered a meat lovers pizza with a beer flight and the Irish rootbeer float, and us ladies had the lemon chicken with teas. I enjoyed my food very much and I loved my heroes Irish rootbeer float. Overall we enjoyed our experience. Don't be fooled by the location, this place is always packed so please make reservations."
Sarah M.,"Oviedo, FL",32,12,23,1.0,11/5/2014,"I am never impressed with chain restaurants but tonight's experience takes the cake is bad service. We arrived at 6.30p and were told 45-55m wait. Fine since the weather is mild in Florida at the moment. Were seated at 7.10p. Server took our drinks almost straight away but didn't come back for nearly 20m. One in our party had asked for a sample of one of the seasonal beers. It was included when our drinks finally arrived but after she placed her order, it was almost 8p by the time get drink arrived! Another in our party asked for a Merlot and was brought a white wine, which we had to send back. When our appetizer was brought to the table, the runner didn't bother to bus the used dishes. It wasn't until we spoke to the manager that the service drastically improved. I can understand if there were numerous large parties, which there were this evening, but regardless the service was absolutely abysmal. I don't blame the server; I'm sure the the kitchen or bar was backed up, but it would have been nice to have been informed about the delay. Fortunately, we were enjoying each other's company so the delays weren't interminable. Food was okay - what you would expect from a chain. And as previously mentioned, once it was brought to the manager's attention, the service drastically improved. Certainly not my favorite and can't say that I'm likely to return without coercion."
Laura K.,"Geneva, FL",5,9,,1.0,3/21/2015,Ordered flat bread pizza 1st one soggy sent back 2nd one took additional 15min w/no can we get u something since u have to wait beer was good. Customer service sucks...they said they took off 1st pizza big deal sent back didn't eat it. Charges us for 2nd pizza & meal after waiting over 25 min for complete order. They don't care @ their customers
T.A. H.,"Orlando, FL",1,11,,2.0,3/21/2016,It's too bad that you only get half the experience at BJs as the food was good.  I was there and happened to be watching the NCAA National Championships for wrestling when the channel changed.   When I requested the channel back I was told that they don't show violent sports.  Seriously?  This is an age old sport that is an Olympic event.  I find it hypocritical  that a bar that makes its money selling alcohol draws the line w wrestling.  On top of it the general manager found the need to come over and gleefully deliver the message himself.  With attitude no less.  They've lost a solid customer as I will not be going back and will be sharing my view with anyone that will listen.  Since when did we become such a judgemental society?  Lol
Lori D.,"Oviedo, FL",0,5,,5.0,4/28/2016,Food was very delicious and was perfect today ! Only issue was our food arrived before finishing our salad ! This seems to be the norm next visit I will mention to our server when placing our order so she can maybe adjust the timing !! But our food and service was perfect this visit !! Thank you!
