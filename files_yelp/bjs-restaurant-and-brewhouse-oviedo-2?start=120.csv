Erika T.,"Casselberry, FL",89,74,,1.0,9/26/2014,"Ok, so I really hate to give this awful review of a restaurant that I TRULY love going to but I think it is appropriate! My wonderful school that I work for set up a very nice little happy hour for us at the new BJ's in Oviedo. The hospitality group paid for appetizers and then if you wanted drinks, other food, etc. then you were ordering that and paying for that part. Some got there around 3:45 and some arrived up to about 4:30. Everyone ordered drinks and more appetizers because they did have a 50% off appetizers until 6:00 and some people even ordered food to go. Around 6:00 I asked my server if she could please bring me my tab and she said ok. Around 6:15, still no tab in my hand, their lovely manager proceeds to come to our table to tell us that we had went OVER our 2 hour limit and that his ""other"" customers were getting aggitated and they needed us to wrap it up, get our tabs and basically hit the highway! Mmmm, excuse me? What? I don't think I heard you right!! I have NEVER been asked to ""hurry up"" at a restaurant because we were taking too long. Then to make it even better the said manager continued to STARE us down every 30 seconds or so. Just looking to make sure we were getting the hell out I suppose! The waitress finally brought us our tab around 6:35 and then took about another 10-15 mins to run all the tabs and bring us our bills. I was and still am appalled at how rude a manager of a very new establishment choose to treat his customers. And, I can assure you that I was actually looking forward to going there with my family, but that is NOT going to happen now! I will be choosing other dining establishments in the area that actually appreciate the fact that you have 25 people spending quite a bit of money at your restaurant over this place! Unbelievable!  Me and 2 other ladies go to the other manager on duty to tell him about our experience and he then says that they do try to have a 2 hour limit for big parties! Really, because that was never mentioned when our hospitality coordinator called to reserve 2 tables for us. Highly offended that ""our"" money wasn't good enough for this place! Sorry BJ's, but you screwed up! If you expect to have repeat customers and actually stay in business perhaps your managers need a little 101 on how to treat customers! Never again! And, I forgot to mention that as the manager is standing there telling our 2 tables that we needed to leave, several people at my table had just received a flight of sample beers and other drinks that they had ordered! Uggh! Disgusted!"
Dee R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,24,1,1.0,4/23/2016,"I went to this restaurant one other time and had the chicken pita tacos; they were just okay, nothing special. I did have their chocolate chip cookie pazookie and that was awesome. However, I recently went and ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Although this restaurant has a very unique atmosphere, the burger made me SO incredibly sick that I can never go back there."
Heather S.,"Winter Springs, Orlando, FL",0,8,,4.0,4/17/2016,My friend and I came in here for lunch. I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. I had a California club and a caprese salad and it was awesome! Very fresh!
Matt R.,"Titusville, FL",2,11,1,4.0,3/17/2015,Ordered the santa fe egg rolls and  the italian market tavern cut pizza- both were delicious. First time here and will definitely be back to try more of their extensive menu choices! Service was good and food was excellently priced. Recommend to anyone looking for good food good drinks and good service.
Bob S.,"Oviedo, FL",0,6,,3.0,5/11/2015,"There's a reason this place (which has a very decent menu) has a lower review score than Steak & Shake, slow service and inconsistent food quality. We've been going to the Oviedo location since it opened, and the service has been in slow, steady decline. In fact, we've only had a decent experience once in our last 5 visits. It's not that the wait staff is bad, it's just that it takes so long to get drinks and or food.  Tonight may be our last trip here. We walked in around 6:30 (a Monday night). We were seated right away. The waiter who was very friendly took our drink order. It took almost 10 minutes for the drinks to come.  We ordered dinner, and waited almost 20 min to be served. The food was barely warm and had obviously been sitting around for a while. When the waiter came back to see how we were doing we told him the problem. His reaction was "" I can get new food cooked up for you, but I don't know how long that will take"". We decided to just bear with the tepid food until one of our party cut into his steak and found a huge knot of gristle.  I can't really blame the waiter. The problem is much deeper than that. Any place worth its salt would have a manager roaming around checking that the guests were having a great experience. We had two major problems with our meal and no manager was to be found.  We finally asked to see a manager. When she came out to see us the best she could do was offer us a free desert. It's a real shame. It took years to get decent places to eat in our town, and now this one seems to be on its way out."
Ms Fab J R.,"Orlando, FL",93,245,47,4.0,9/12/2014,Great hospitable service.  Try the berry mojitos and the steam with their amazing white cheddar mashed potatoes.  Loved it!
Jennifer M.,"St Helena, CA",26,2,,2.0,9/26/2014,"Great beer, food and atmosphere! Great servers as well:)  the manager asked us to leave as we had exceeded our time. We were there as a large group for happy hour. I have never had that happen! It was extremely rude!"
Kristina K.,"Orlando, FL",0,25,,5.0,8/12/2014,"We went on opening night. We used their Android app to book priority seating.  Upon arrival, we were seated immediately,  and a pair of servers quickly took our drink order.  My handcrafted root beer was delicious.   I ordered the Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich and my roommate had the Southern Fried Chicken.  Both were very tasty.  A trio of Pizookies were the perfect finish.  Several different people checked in throughout our meal to make sure we were enjoying it.  When we left, at least three different people thanked us and wished us a great night.  A seamless opening.  We will definitely be back."
Jamie N.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",45,3,7,4.0,9/17/2014,"I absolutely love this place!!!!!! It's my new favorite spot to end my night with friends and enjoy great breeze, an awesome happy hour and don't forget the Pizzookie. Best Pizzookie is the salted Caramel yuuuummmm. Every time I go I have tried something new on the menu and never once had a dish I didn't love."
Lauren D.,"Winter Park, FL",19,106,10,5.0,1/6/2015,They have amazing tomato bisque soup and the bread bowls are perfect. I like this restaurant cause they have something for everyone. We go here about once a week.
Linda S.,"Oviedo, FL",0,9,2,2.0,9/5/2014,Been there 2 times. Food not same quality as other BJs. Major disappointed! Stay away from the stuffed mushrooms! When they came out they looked terrible and there wasn't even any stuffing in them. Sent them back and they remade . They didn't look much better and taste was less than desirable!!!
Jacki V.,"Oviedo, FL",1,6,4,3.0,10/10/2014,"The new BJ's seems to be pretty crowded every day of the week since opening. This place is definitely for the beer lover. The food was pretty good, although my Broiled Shrimp Tacos had a way too much sauce,...they put chipotle mayonnaise AND Santa Fe dressing (?) on them and they are served with Avocado cream sauce on the side. Quite heavy. You may want to order all of the condiments on the side if you aren't into creamy sauces and mayo. The Avocado egg roll appetizer was very good and everyone liked them. I liked that they have ""enlightened"" meals for the calorie conscious. The wings that were ordered at our table were lacking in wing sauce and extra had to be ordered, but tasted fine. The Jambalaya was very tasty if you are into spicy dishes. We will return to try the entree salads on the menu. The Pizza was probably the best thing that was ordered and a best bet in my opinion."
Jason J.,"Sanford, FL",12,7,,4.0,9/14/2014,Finally checked this place out and was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly things ran considering they have only been open for a month. Used the app to go on the preferred wait list and that worked great. Oktoberfest beer was delicious and both of our meals were pretty good. Service was good even on a football Sunday. Definitely will be back!
Robert P.,"Oviedo, FL",448,32,24,4.0,9/21/2014,Just wanted to say this place has a very nice selection of craft beer and the food was decent. Still very busy being new to our area the wait time on a friday night was over an hour. Can't wait to try the deep dish pizza. We will vist more often for sure.
Chris R.,"Oviedo, FL",2,3,,5.0,1/20/2015,Came here for happy hour today. The food was really good and service was superb.
Victor A.,"Winter Springs, FL",0,6,,3.0,3/11/2015,"I love the food but the service was terrible. First time we went to this location they were real slow the manager served us, we felt they were new and busy so we let it go. went two or three times more after That and the service got worse. I rather go to another location. 5 Start for the food 2 Stars for the service."
Rachel D.,"Oviedo, FL",103,2,14,2.0,8/26/2014,"I was excited to go to a new restaurant in Oviedo and was far from impressed.  Our service was awesome however the food was not impressive, to say the least.  Granted, we did order mostly appetizers.  We had calamari which was overcooked and had no seasoning. Wings that were mushy and not crispy at all. And, the pepperoni pizza dip which lacked taste. I really did want to enjoy it unfortunately that wasn't the scenario this time. I did enjoy drinking some of their in-house brews however my friend had a skinny Mojito and did not like it at all."
Christine F.,"Oviedo, FL",0,17,,5.0,2/27/2015,"I love this place, I go as a family of 4. The appetizers we usually get are the pot stickers and the calamari both are very good. The chicken Tortilla soup and broc cheddar are both very good because we were allowed to taste a sample of both and choose which one we liked best our 5 yr old love the broc cheddar soup and I love the chicken tortilla soup it has fresh avocados and the works. Our family usually goes with a supreme deep dish pizza and it feeds us all and then some. The topper is the PIZOOKI which my kid raves about the pizza cookie that comes as a dessert. Overall when everything else fails for ideas on where to go for dinner on a weekend BJ wins with flying colors for both adults and kids in our family. We have the bjs loyalty card and intend to vip very soon. Picky about chain restaurants but this one stands apart."
Justin E.,"Casselberry, Orlando, FL",0,12,,5.0,9/2/2014,Finally tried this place out and loved it! Their in house brews are very good! We went there for their late night happy hour! Half off apps and $1 their in house brews. We sat at the bar and had Katelyn as our bartender. She was amazing. Seemed very genuine and answered all our questions and did it with a smile! Ambiance is really nice too!
Rachel H.,"Winter Park, FL",1,18,,2.0,4/30/2015,"This was our first visit to BJs. We were excited to try it since we heard such positive things. This will also be our last.  The food was ok but not the best. Service was terrible. The food took a ridiculous amount of time to come out and 2/4 orders were wrong. They took the plates back to fix the order which took another long, long time. When they brought the correctex order,  the plates didnt have any sides with them! We took a risk to order a dessert. 25 minutes it took for it to come! We were there from 9:15-11:30 for just an entree and dessert. Finding our waiter was near impossible and all of our drinks were empty.  What a hot mess."
