Janice T.,"Casselberry, FL",34,4,,4.0,11/15/2014,"Roast Beef Dip was fresh abd delicious, but the service from greeting to server left a lot to be desired."
Georgie W.,"Oviedo, FL",0,10,,4.0,7/16/2015,"Great servers!!! I think this is the best of the ""American"" category in the oviedo area. Definitely dine and drink here over chilis, millers ale house, Sonnys, outback, or rock and brews. I think it is best value and atmosphere for the money. Happy hour is great too. As well as wine down Tuesday's (half off all wine)."
Barbara P.,"Orlando, FL",15,30,,2.0,8/15/2014,"This new restaurant has no contact info, store email or website other than a location site thus I cannot get info to a Manager. I visited (with a friend) the new Oviedo FL location last afternoon,what a disappointment. 8-14-14 Server Amanda (she was only good thing about this place) Table 316 0326a @ 3:35 p.m. I had been to the one in North Dallas (close to Hwy 35 going to DFW) and was really good. This Oviedo location was poor at best. Fries were cold, limpy, burger was so soggy with butter and grease I ate only one side and 1/2, avacado rolls were so greasy I had to blot each piece at least 3 X's to remove grease. We told waitress and she said she was sorry.  Not a good way to start a new restaurant. Just don't go....there are a lot of great restaurants out there now. Not worth your bucks."
Michelle S.,"Geneva, FL",2,9,,5.0,9/4/2014,"Had lunch here today. I had the unlimited soup and salad which consisted of my choice of house, caesar, wedge or tomato mozzarella salad (caprese) and my choice of soup from tomato bisque, chicken tortilla, clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. I should mention you can switch out any and all at any time. I had a house salad and then the caprese which were both wonderful. I then tried all the soups except for the clam chowder. They were phenomenal but I will say the tomato bisque was my favorite. They served the chicken tortilla with the tortilla chips, avocado and cheese in the bowl and then poured the soup over it. The waitress explained that keeps the chips and avocado from getting soggy. My friend had the avocado egg rolls and requested no cilantro. The chef sent the waitress out to explain there would be some cooked inside however it would not be that strong because he would leave the garnish off and them asked if that was ok or if she would prefer to change her order. She had them and said they were very good.  I have been here twice now and both times the service has been exceptional.  I had appetizers on the first visit a week after they opened and the mushrooms and wings were out of this world. The flatbread pizza and corn fritter type things were also very good and a dining companion said the black & bleu burger was great.  Definitely will return!!"
Kelli S.,"Oviedo, FL",0,3,,4.0,9/1/2014,"Ate their pizza and it was delicious. The waitress we had was kinda rude though. The whole time I felt like she was trying to get us to leave as fast as possible. She actually brought us a box while we were still shoving food into our mouths, and proceeded to box up our pizza for us. We ended up staying and eating the rest from the box."
Tim H.,"Bridgewater, MA",49,40,8,1.0,10/13/2014,"Where do I start. Well, have visited 3 times. The service has steadily deteriorated. The first time ate lunch at the bar. The place had only been open a few weeks, and there were apparently ""trainers"" from another location with the new staff behind the bar. Service was super slow and inattentive - and the the training staff was way more interested in socializing with a customer seated next to me at the bar who was was another employee not currently working. My 2nd visit was this past Saturday evening. I checked in for priority seating using the mobile app. It says that after you arrive at the designated time you may experience a short wait for your table. Let's just say ""short"" wait is relative. The hostesses at the podiums - hmm - not very friendly or welcoming in any way. We were eventually seated and served by Bart who was friendly enough, but waited a while to see him, and a long time for food, drink refills, etc.. When a runner brought our food (luke warm -  had definitely all been sitting a while), I asked her for ketchup, and her reaction was priceless - akin to asking her for a kidney donation. Bart returned to our table about 5 mins later with a ketchup container that was 99% empty. The first squirt showered another person at our table with ketchup spray from all the air in the squeeze bottle. Now food is really cold. The crispy fries were a hit, and burger probably would have been great if it was hot (lots of restaurants put ketchup on your table as soon as they put burgers and fries down without asking). I received an email survey which I filled out, and received a nice email from Maurice the GM.  I returned today for lunch, sat at a high-top in the bar. Arrived at my seat at 12:02. Sat for about 12 mins before we were acknowledged and given menus. Iced tea arrived at 12:22, and after watching our server walk past us 3 times and not take our order, I left and went to Chili's at 12:29. Service is deplorable. I am Seacrest out with BJ's."
Eric A.,"Oviedo, FL",0,3,,2.0,7/18/2015,We have enjoyed meals at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Jacksonville and Daytona Beach. However the Oviedo location has yet to deliver a quality dining experience after three tries. Overall impression of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Oviedo: there are better choices near by.
Brian B.,"Orange City, FL",1,140,19,5.0,4/25/2015,Awsome food great cocktails my wife had the sirloin  seasoned and cooked perfectly the balsamic chicken was awsome service was great
Jennifer C.,"Oviedo, FL",1,14,1,2.0,7/12/2015,"We usually visit the one in Daytona and enjoy it. We were excited to see they were opening up one in Oviedo. I have gone there a few times now thinking maybe we just hit them at the wrong time or someone was having an off day. I do not think this is the case. The service is not very good and after waiting 35 minutes to get our food it was not hot or correct.  It was not packed and there was not any wait to get seated so not sure what the issue was. I didn't order anything special, just a sandwich but it didn't come as it was shown on the menu. When I said something it was like I was lying. The manager did come over and was pleasant but that was about it. I think we will stick to the one in Daytona!"
Dustin R.,"Greenville, NC",2,7,,5.0,7/2/2015,This place is amazing. Several craft beers that taste amazing and bar staff to boot. My table decided  on trying one of their deep dish pizzas. It was some of the best deep dish pizza o have in a while. We did wait for about 35 min last night which was Thursday. But it was well worth the wait. Take a gander at the beers while you wait. Anytime I'm in the area I will be hitting this place up.
Christie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/1/2015,"I went in for happy hour had a glass of wine with my friend, gave the bartender $10 and he gave me no change on my $7 check. This is how it works. I order, you give me change, I decide what tip to leave. I tried to get his attention, I didn't know his name, he responded disrespectfully. In his defense I called out ""hey buddy""but it was not meant to be disrespectful I just didn't know how to get his attention nor was I getting his attention any other way. I still left him a 25% tip but he made me feel incredibly belittled and that I did not appreciate. I probably would have left him the entire $3 had he just given me the change and not given me attitude when I asked for it. I've had a lot of good experiences at this location but Taylor really made this an incredibly uncomfortable experience for me."
Mary V.,"Winter Springs, FL",0,18,,4.0,2/26/2015,"I love it here and like the food, but the salads are overpriced for their size. A salad and glass of tea shouldn't set one back $20 (includes 18% tip)."
Rosali O.,"Orlando, FL",1,1,,1.0,6/17/2015,"Honestly if it wasn't for the clam chowder I'd never come here. For the past few visits it has always been issues. My boyfriend and I have been told off by one of the servers and as they berated and belittled us in front of the manager (they were in the kitchen and you could hear them) the manager did absolutely nothing when we complained about hearing it and the service. Well today is another terrible day, with the 7 tables they have occupied things still take outrageous amounts of time to come out. We were here at 10:20 and the remainder of our food is coming out at midnight (technically there closed at this point). The manager Jaime who always seems to be the one working when things are at its worst doesn't help the situation much, bubbly personality but not the best at handling issues. If it wasn't for the amazing clam chowder, we would never step foot in this establishment again. (Yes the clam chowder is really that good)"
Zac B.,"Oviedo, FL",0,7,,5.0,11/9/2014,"Five stars for the food and service tonight. Got the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps, bjs favorite mini pizza, Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were all fantastic. Our bartender Dean was friendly and always there to refill your glass. We also met Chef Gabriel who was friendly and chatted with us about food and steaks and various things. Feels good to be treated like that when you go out to a restaurant and it was very appreciated.  Even better he decided to give us two free steaks and a batch of there hottest wings for free to try and I would order both of these every time as well. So great service great food and great environment. Thanks you bjs and welcome to Oviedo!"
Grant C.,"Sanford, FL",1,36,,3.0,11/2/2014,"Food is consistent with other BJs (a half notch above TGI fridays), food service and bar service are attentive. All told, it was a fun place to come with a large group."
Melinda W.,"Oviedo, FL",31,31,3,3.0,2/15/2015,"I have been to this location and the one at Millennia Mall multiple times. The staff at Millennia always asks if I am a member of the loyalty club the moment I walk in the door. That does not happen at Oviedo. I always have to stop and interrupt the staff to put in my loyalty rewards. Oviedo never offers to cash in rewards where Millennia always does. Food taste is great at both but I have experienced inconsistencies at Oviedo with amount of sauce or presentation that arrives with a dish vs what comes each and every time at Millennia. Every time I have ordered an appetizer at Oviedo, I have had to ask for plates and wait several minutes. Oviedo is not as prompt with beverage refills. On my last visit we were there for about 90 minutes of which my glass remained empty for 30 minutes with multiple visits from the server offering to refill the drink. I do like BJs a lot but prefer to dine at Millennia."
