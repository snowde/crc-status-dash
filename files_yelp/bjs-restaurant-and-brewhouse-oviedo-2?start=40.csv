Casey H.,"Orlando, FL",31,344,389,2.0,6/16/2015,I didn't even read the other reviews but I must agree 3 stars is about right.  The fish tacos are a 6.5 of of 10... :-(  the spicy jalapeño burger with a buffalo patty was really good.   Almost a hour wait once we sat which was a bit long. ..  Was not impressed with the calamari. .  We were disappointed. Soo.. I'm back to add that it was my child birthday while we where here.  I discretely told the waitress.... When I reminder her after dinner ... she couldn't be lo under about it.  Then mentioned they don't sing but they will do a candle. So..  no singing and go figure. .. no candle. .. really?
Rosemary P.,"Baltimore, MD",1,21,3,5.0,1/1/2017,"My daughter and I visited BJs on December 29th.It was pretty crowded with a late lunch crowd.The waiter took our drink orders and left us to pour over the rather lengthy menu. I chose chicken tenders and fries, my daughter chose a light on cheese pizza. The food and drinks were delicious. I was on my way home to Baltimore and I see there is a BJs not far from me. Yaaay!"
Bc C.,"Dana Point, CA",1,33,25,5.0,6/20/2016,Awesome happy hour..                                                     Half price appetizers! Yummy Ribs were surprisingly great.. Cheese sticks
Brittany B.,"Winter Springs, Orlando, FL",67,10,2,1.0,11/19/2016,I wish I could leave 0 stars. I placed a to go order online and drove up there to pick it up. 50 minutes later I still don't have my food (1 appetizer!!!) the girl who answered when I finally called and asked about it implied that I was lying to her. Fire this entire staff and hire new people. Totally unacceptable.
Janel N.,"Saint Augustine, FL",79,3,2,1.0,6/27/2017,"Let's start this review with at 7 pm we put in for a party of 7. Yes we understand it would take some time but 1.5 hrs to just get sat at the table. The hostess was new and knew nothing is a long time. We were the last 7 people standing around waiting for a table and 2 of us had checked the status at different times and the hostess still spoke to the open lobby and didn't look at us and called our parties name. There was no apology and no manager rounding to address the issue. Then even after we sat it took awhile for our food to come. Our Server bless her heart was very sweet and nice. The food was good I will give it that, but over priced especially for the experience we had. I will be avoiding this place and not recommending it to anyone. There are better places with good food and service that I would suggest. It could also have been not as bad if a manager would have come and addressed the issue. So if you have 3.5 hrs on a Tuesday night to just wait for everything then sure maybe this is the place for you!"
Bry W.,"Winter Park, FL",74,100,53,5.0,10/16/2016,"Ive been coming here since it opened, and I can tell you I have NEVER been let down by the product or service.  Aside from a gr8 HH during the week (4-6pm)... BJs has half off apps and gr8 drink specials for all you NFL fans.  All day during NFL Sundays.  And even n Saturday/Thursday/Monday games as well.  With a wide range of choices on tap, how can you go wrong?"
Eric A.,"Sanford, FL",4,33,29,5.0,5/10/2016,"This is and update of the previous review that I had left,  We returned for a visit with seven of us in the family after some previous terrible visits. We were seated immediately upon arriving, our server was Michael, he was amazing. He did everything he could to make sure our dining experience was the best it can be. The service was fast, And very very friendly. All the food arrived on time and was amazing amazing. I let the manager Jeremy know that this service was absolutely better than the last time the food was hot and the service was amazing. We Will definitely go back."
Claudia R.,"Casselberry, Orlando, FL",84,5,6,1.0,10/4/2016,"Just had the worst experience. My party of TWO sat down at a table in the high top area that had been bussed but not wiped. Someone had come by to drop menus without offering to get drinks or wipe the table. We finally had a flustered Kayla(?) walk up to us 5 minutes later to grab our drink order. As we waited for our waters, we watched tables sit, get greeted and receive drinks before we received any further attention. Not to mention, we had requested to speak with a manager after waiting for so long and watched her walk by numerous times and converse with customers at the bar and other employees despite our request to speak to her. We did FINALLY receive our appetizer nearly 10 minutes later which arrived at our table undercooked.  Now, we have both worked in the restaurant industry and understand how hectic service industry can be but this was just unacceptable. I explained my concerns to our flustered server who could only respond with ""There's only 2 of us, we're busy"" and offered no apology. To say we're disappointed is an understatement, will NOT be returning to this location."
Emily S.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,7,3.0,1/25/2017,We had a party of 7 (1/24/17). We got seated right away but it took over 20 minutes to get our drinks. Also it took another 10 minutes to get our food orders taken. The food came out luke-warm. It wasn't that good. My brother got the Parmesan crusted chicken. It smelled terrible and the presentation was poor. My friend got the sirloin (ordered medium rare). When it came out it was not medium rare it was very rare. It had no flavor and it was mostly gristle. I got a deep dish pizza and it came out cold. The pan wasn't even hot at all. The only reason I'm giving the place 3 stars is because their house made root -beer is fantastic and the manager was nice enough to let us use 3 of the buy one entree get one free coupons.  Maybe you should hire more wait staff because our server had way to many tables to take care of at once.
Eric R.,"Longwood, FL",197,165,119,5.0,3/17/2016,"I went to my first BJ's in Melbourne last month and heard there were 3 in Orlando.  Unfortunately for me they are all about 30 minutes away from my house.  Yesterday I was at my son's track meet and did a quick search and found this BJ's only 10 minutes from the track.  Layout was exactly the same and I am happy to report, so was the food and service.. excellent.  I couldn't wait to get the same Roasted Brussels Sprouts starter.  My wife hates Brussels Sprouts and has made them once in our 27 years of marriage... she loved them!  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich from the lite menu and it was awesome.  The beer menu is extensive and with the in-house craft options, you can choose your favorite coloring from pale to stout.  I chose the Amber, which was super.  If you haven't been here, check it out.  Great value."
Dagwood S.,"Tampa, FL",31,25,,2.0,3/20/2016,The prices go up and the portions get smaller.  $114 for a family of four?  Can't wait for 5 Guys to open up so we can save money.
Cindee P.,"Orlando, FL",45,180,441,4.0,7/11/2015,"The food is always good here. When it first opened, the service was slow, but it improved a lot. The Cherry Chipotle Salmon was awesome. The cream soda here is the best ever. You must try it to believe it!"
David E.,"Winter Springs, FL",64,60,23,2.0,10/11/2015,"The service here is terrible!   DID YOU HEAR THAT MR OR MRS MANAGER??? The people need more training!!  How many more reviews need to be written with the same refrain?  ""Good food bad service"" I feel like a fool for going back, because every time I do, I am treated to lousy service. I ONLY go when there are half off appetizers or it wouldn't be worth it.  Now I understand the options are limited in the area to ale house, bjs, chilies etc. however, dont forget about the red bug and tuskawilla intersection that has some better options. Such as - outback, carabas, Thai basil, steffanos etc... Unless this restaurant spends some time and effort on developing and training the front line employee, I think people will wise up and move on."
Emily C.,"Orlando, FL",2,41,1,3.0,7/15/2016,"Really great concept - i love that you can mix the beers! The drinks are delicious and the cider is awesome. However, the food is just okay. It's almost like there's too many options and they don't specialize in any 1 thing. Our waitress said the burgers and pizza are what they're known for but i haven't given them a try yet. I will try them on my next visit - so far the sandwiches are just okay and the fries are really skinny."
MiquilinA G.,"Orlando, FL",7,52,45,3.0,10/26/2015,Generally a place that I actually get dessert. But today after using mobile order we got in about 10 min after ordering from the app. It took about 45 minutes to FINALLY get our food! The restaurant was not busy and we were told that the kitchen was a little slow. Buts manager didn't even come by to check on us. By time we left I was annoyed and really debating if I will go again especially on a school night. We were left hangry and annoyed watching our kids eat  pizza and we waited an additional 10 minutes before our food came. And then when our food came we had our children wiggling and moving because they had been sitting and behaving for an hour already. And my husband's bread never came. We were very disappointed.
Nicole C.,"Orlando, FL",67,117,76,4.0,1/16/2016,"Visited on Labor Day evening to take advantage of their $3 BJs brews special. My friend and I sat at the bar and the bartender recommended a seasonal IPA that was delicious.  BJs happy hour is the best. Flatbreads, appetizers, and mini pizzas are all HALF OFF. So, for about $11 I had a flatbread and 2 amazing beers! My stomach and my wallet were both happy. Keep up the great work on brews and food and I'll keep coming back!"
Gabriella K.,"De Leon Springs, FL",0,2,1,5.0,8/11/2016,"I eat at this restaurant all the time but I've never been to this location. Jimmy, my waiter, was definitely a pleasure to have. Very attentive & professional and had a lot of energy! Thanks for the great experience!"
Brad B.,"Oviedo, FL",0,4,,1.0,4/2/2016,"My most recent visit will be my last. This place continues to disappoint. They have some real issues with their standards and training. I hope the manager and/or ownership can fix the issues because the area needs more options for casual dining.  Let's start with basics. If you like eating with utensils, this place may not be for you. We thought the night was going to be a success because we actually got our silverware when seated. This was a groundbreaking first! I can't tell you how many times I have looked around the dining room to see food delivered to tables only to have dining delayed and food cooling further (more on that in a moment) while silverware is tracked down. A restaurant should have enough silverware to seat the entire restaurant all at once x 2.5-3.0. This place appears to be short on silverware. Literally, this visit was the first time we got it at time of seating. Progress that raised our hopes for a fleeting few minutes.  Now on to the food. If you like hot food, this is not the place for you. This restaurant appears to specialize in lukewarm food, which is not to my liking. The final straw, dinner for two - both were chicken dishes - both served lukewarm, one with room temp rice and beans and the other with room temp potatoes and uncooked broccoli. The broccoli wasn't cooked at all. Previous meals have been the mahi and shrimp in which I could either get hot fish or hot shrimp, but never both in the same serving. As someone who worked in the restaurant business for years, many of the first disappointments were overlooked. What can I say, I am too kind and forgiving. Then as what I hoped were exceptions showed themselves to be trends, I raised the issue to the manager. Maybe he didn't know and I could help him. The manager comped a few meals and apologized the last few times. But in the end, I am not going out for a free meal. I want a hot meal with silverware with which to eat it. I want to pay for a hot meal. A side note here. When the plate is hotter than the food, it means that the food died in the window. This is a restaurant term that means it was cooked and plated and placed under a heat lamp so long that the food cooled while the plate heated. When a server comes to you with a mitt or cloth to carry the plate, 90% of the time, this means your food has been sitting in the window for 5+ minutes. My last visit - warm plate lukewarm food. Wrapping this up, when I finally talk with the manager during my last visit, he says that this never happens. They never have this problem... They so rarely comp food... Well, he needs to read Yelp to see that this is a systemic problem that needs attention. Perhaps they need a new manager with open eyes to see the problems. But, this guy seems nice enough so I hope he can turn things around.  The servers here need training too. Two tables next to us tonight got their dinner salads and soups 10 seconds before their entrees. Pacing of a meal is a concept that needs training at this location. Appetizers or salads or soups should be served with ample time to eat them without stacking plates on a table. It is bad practice for so many reasons- food cools further before it is eaten being among them. It also makes people look glutinous to have 2-3 plates per guest on the table. Also, drinks/glasses should not be touched such that a servers fingers are around the rim of the glass. It's disgusting. And, though we have had some that are friendly, most appear to be rather disappointed to be working there.  I would offer that this manager should visit some competing restaurants to see how they do things. Almost anyplace in the area is better (sorry Rock & Brews - you struggle with cooking food thoroughly). The potential is there for a good experience. The recipes are good. The atmosphere is good. If they could just get hot food to the table with silverware already in place, we would be regular diners."
Harry W.,"Orlando, FL",36,70,13,3.0,5/24/2015,"I would love to give BJs more than three stars. We have been a few of them around the country including Louisville, KY and Los Angeles, CA. Although the Oviedo locations has about the same menu and a very decent guest tap selection, the food service (back, not front of the house) is bad. We went in to grab some brews and have a snack to help kill a part of a Saturday afternoon. We sat at the bar and ordered flights of all the BJ's beers, plus an Arrogant Bastard which you don't see on tap often. My wife and I are pretty picky about our beers, so you have to consider my review with that understood. Their beers are ok. Brewed at Brew Hub over in Lakeland, they are certainly competent versions of their respective beer styles -- better than we thought given corporate beers usually are often bland. The piranah and the tatonka were especially nice. I'm not sure if it was whatever was on the Arrogant Bastard tap before they switched the keg or if the bartender poured the wrong beer but it tasted like Blueberry, oh well.  The problem came when we ordered food. We ordered the Poke. It took FOREVER. The place was empty almost except for us. Poke is raw fish which doesn't seem like it ought to take long to dice and put on a plate, but it was at least 30 minutes. The folks next to us also waited quite a long time for their food. Besides the four of us at the bar, there was maybe two other tables in the whole place. Once we received the poke, the portion was very small. We had thought about getting something else, but we needed to be to work by Monday and couldn't imagine how long cooked food would take if raw food took this long. To sum up: The beer was good to really good (even with the weird thing with the AB). The food was ok and took forever. That seems 3 star territory to me."
Samuel V.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Unfortunately the worst service experience I ever had.  Was my family first time and the last,  the waiter was rushing us and she was no help (we are first time guest). She looked annoyed when my son ask a question about the chicken wings. She also spill a drink over my wife's silverware and didn't clean it. Unfortunately you guys lost a guest."
