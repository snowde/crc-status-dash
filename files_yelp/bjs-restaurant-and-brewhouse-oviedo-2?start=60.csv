Jeff K.,"Orlando, FL",520,754,862,3.0,9/11/2014,"First, let me say that I like the app that you can download. It's cool - you can use it to put yourself on a waiting list, place an order before you arrive, pay the check from your table if you don't want to wait for your check, and give the waitress your reward program code without needing to carry around a card. There needs to be more though.  The beer isn't bad. The bison burger, without warning, was served with slaw instead of fries like the rest of the burgers. The slaw was okay, but I was looking forward to the fries! Especially after looking at the bison burger, which was really pretty small. After I ate it, and the slaw, I split a side of fries with my wife because I was still hungry.  Overall, not a great value for money. I'll come back to try something different, but if I were you I'd skip the bison burger."
Matt A.,"Casselberry, FL",0,7,2,5.0,8/9/2014,Full disclosure most of our food was free due to training opening. - we walked in and manages to get seated even though their seating was reservation only for the soft training opening.  Food was amazing we tried the chicken balsamic and the prime rib dip as well as some of their craft beers unique to the company all the food was amazing even though cooks and wait staff were training everything was delicious and it was a fantastic experience I highly recommend.
Kelly D.,"North Charleston, SC",2,2,,3.0,4/8/2015,"The restaurant itself is beautiful; It's very big and open. I liked our 2-top booth. The food was pretty good. My friend had the Parmesan crusted chicken, which she liked a lot. I got the great white pizza, which was good... Although it really did taste similar to Pizza Hut because of the crust.  Service was not that great. Our server was clearly busy when we sat- it took her about 10 minutes to get to us. When she finally did come over, all she said was, ""Oh my gosh, what can I get for you?"" Then, whenever she would try to take our order, if we hesitated even just for a second, she would offer to leave and come back. It was a little off-putting. My friend and I work in the industry, so we can tell when someone is trying to rush you out.We could tell we were the last table in her section, and she not only interrupted us as soon as we started eating dessert to ask if she could get us anything else, but then once we were finished, asked us how we wanted our checks split. We had planned to order another drink, but we felt so rushed that we chose to cash out and move to the bar.  I was glad we did, because our bartender was great! Our experience was much better up there. Next time, I think I would just eat at the bar."
Anibal O.,"De Bary, FL",11,83,38,4.0,8/17/2015,"Went here with a few friends a month ago. Used to go to the one in San Diego.  The service was ok it wasn't bad nor was it good.  They screwed up and gave us our starters then 5 mins later our main dishes which I didn't like cause I felt rushed to eat. The pricing was not bad and the selection of beer is pretty large, I don't drink beer but had their mixed berry beer and it was amazing. As for dishes I had a French onion soup that was a 8 out of 10 and a Cajun pasta that was about the same...  I would go back in heart beat"
Paul S.,"Casselberry, FL",0,1,,5.0,12/18/2016,"We went in for lunch on Sunday. They have great drink specials during game days. $1 off drafts and $2 dollar bottled beers.Our server was Jordan. He informed us of the current specials and was very knowledgeable of the menu items we inquired about. The Chicken Tacos and Jambalaya were yummy. Jambalaya is spicy. Also had the Portobello Mushroom and Asparagus salad which had wonderful flavor. Our experience was wonderful thanks to our food, and our server Jordan.We will be back"
Terry C.,"Martinez, GA",0,17,,1.0,1/17/2015,"After a sixty minute wait, with three children and three adults, we had to ask three times for silver ware and napkins.  Ordered an appetizer and when we asked for napkins for the wings, the server brought a small stack of cocktail napkins which weren't appropriate for wings.  We also had to ask for plates. We also had to ask for children's menus which seemed to surprise the server. The entrees were terrible, an inedible french dip, a medium rare steak that was pink and very dry, Brussel sprouts that looked like left over mushrooms - brown and soggy.  The kids hamburgers were dry and way over cooked. The manager came over and when told about the problems, told us that he would adjust the bill and take the French Dip off the bill.  When the bill came, there were no adjustments including the 20% coupon we presented.  We got that adjusted but vowed not to come back.  The only saving grace was the server who was pleasant but not very capable."
Ed G.,"Orlando, FL",14,20,1,4.0,6/4/2016,"Oh my gosh, had passed on the opportunity to eat here before, and just wow. Great ribs, great drinks, great service. My friends and I had such a friendly waiter. Definitely happy to have given it a try. Will definitely be back. Definitely recommend their ribs. Their mozzarella sticks are meh, but everything else was great!"
Barry B.,"Orlando, FL",264,11,4,1.0,4/22/2015,"Food was so so Morons running the place in ORLANDO FLORIDA turned off playoff hockey with the Tampa Bay Lightning and 9 TV showed west coast basket ball.  I asked for the game to be turned back on.  30 minutes later as we were leaving they turned it on on 1 screen directly behind where we were seated.   Serve SO SO FOOD and then ignore a simple request, I will return again NOT!"
Mildred A.,"Geneva, FL",0,13,5,4.0,4/10/2016,"Everything we visited we had a good dinning experience , the flat bread pizza are very tasty :)"
Ananda L.,"Palm Desert, CA",8,30,,5.0,6/11/2015,"This is my second time here and i've decided to rate it 5 stars because the first two experiences left me wanting more! The atmosphere is great, service was fast and enjoyable and i LOVE the menu!  I really enjoy simple menus with pictures, and all the pictures in this menu make my mouth water. I'm not basing my review on the pictures, but on the overall experience and good food. I'm a local here and i will definitely come back to try more items.  My recommendation for two: try the avocado rolls, share one of the salmon entries and finish with the seasonal cobbler."
Doug S.,"Orlando, FL",6,34,53,1.0,11/11/2014,"Worst BJs ever. They sat another group at our table of 9 and had to scramble to seat us after another 10 minute wait after the initial 55 minute wait.  Appetizers came before drinks and silverware.  Some food showed up after 75 minutes. I'm still waiting on my BJs Pizza after 90 minutes.  I've spoken to the manager and he said he'd ""check on things"" but he's yet to return and give so much as an 'I'm sorry' Pathetic. I'll never return to this location."
Gloria A.,"Orlando, FL",1,7,1,5.0,5/10/2016,"My family and I celebrated my birthday, my daughter's college graduation and Mother's Day. What more could I ask for in such a beautiful restaurant and staff. May 2016"
Chad M.,"Oviedo, FL",1,4,2,3.0,9/1/2014,"We had a pizza to go from here which was amazing!!!!  So we decided to eat in.  Waitresses were slow. But environment was nice.  Entrees were so so, but we loved the cleanliness."
Lauren P.,"Orlando, FL",0,12,2,3.0,5/6/2016,The food is good but we can never seem to get out of here in less than two hours when going for dinner and it's only two of us eating. We thought it was a fluke the first time so we went back. And for some reason we went a third time which was the most disappointing when the server admitted to us (after waiting 30 minutes for a flatbread) that he simply forgot to ring it in and told us the manager wouldn't comp it. My husband and I have both worked in restaurants before so we didn't feel like raising a fuss and simply left him a lower tip than what we normally leave (since he fully admitted it was his fault so it wouldn't have been fair for the restaurant to pay for it anyways). We've never been disappointed in the food itself but we won't go if we need to eat somewhere quickly.
Aldis G.,"Sanford, FL",17,1,,5.0,5/5/2016,Always enjoy dining there and speaking with Bart the Bartender. He's a great employee and services me and my wife with a smile!
Alex M.,"Whittier, CA",51,79,58,4.0,12/7/2015,BJ's are always a great place to go. Especially if you like to drink spirits or beer. Half of the menu is just about that. They have a good variety of food selections that are delicious. Service is very good.
Joyce P.,"Sanford, FL",0,25,2,1.0,1/2/2016,"Definate pub-grub. ,Ordered the California club...barely a trace of avocado, what there was, was rotten. Fries were cold. Got a second order of fries but they were very thin and crispy, however they lacked any potato. They were just strings of fried something.Manager came over and apologized. I then ordered the balsamic chicken. I'm not sure what kind of meat it was. Texture was foreign to me. It was stringy and tough. I was not certain that it was cooked so I didn't eat much of it. Too embarrassed to send order back again. Mashed potatoes were delicious.  Staff was attentive. No reduction on check. Won't be back. Crowd must be there for the beer."
Tom C.,"Oviedo, FL",311,2,,4.0,5/19/2016,This place is cute. I had the broccoli cheaper soup and a deep dish pizza. Both were good! The wait staff was friendly.
Karen S.,"Casselberry, FL",2,74,23,5.0,3/25/2016,Been here three times now. Love the check in call ahead seating.  Good atmosphere and huge menu. Lots of selection. Good food and fun to go. Really like it. Great specials and drinks. Good location and had become a favorite for the locals.
Gabriele A.,"Orlando, FL",0,14,,4.0,1/22/2016,We love this place. Usually sit at the bar and have never been disappointed with service or food. Happy hour and specials make this a great deal.  Not sure why all the negative service comments. We have been at least 10 times and never experienced anything but good service.
