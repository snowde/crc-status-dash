Ricardo C.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,5.0,4/14/2016,My  wife and I visited the Oviedo location.  Food here is ok.  Nothing to rant about.  However the customer service that we received last week was impressive.  Basically I didn't like my food and I told my waitress.  She took the plate and simply asked if we saved room for desert.  Didn't offer to get me something else or comp the meal. Well I then received a survey in my email.  I explained what happened.  I quickly received an email personally from the restaurant manager apologizing.  Next time we came in we were taken care of and they made it right.  Not often you see that these days.
Joselyn D.,"Winter Park, FL",13,43,7,2.0,9/1/2015,"We passed this new establishment about 3 times before we decided to finally go and try the food. The atmosphere is fine it's more like a high class pub with TVs playing sports. The wait wasn't long as it was only a Tuesday night. The kids menu was easy and more to the point than the regular adult menu which has way too much food and too confusing.  I ordered the calamari as my main course with a side salad, my youngest child had the corn dogs with a side of Caesar side salad, and my teenager had the chicken alfredo pasta my husband had the chicken wings.  The server forgot to bring my husband lemons for his drink three times as she passed by. She offered my son a side salad with his meal but failed to tell us that it was not part of the meal but it was an additional $3.50.  When the salads came out they had the wrong salad for my small child and were confused as to why we ordered a Caesar salad and why the waitress had approved it. Needless to say we did end up getting his salad. No big deal I could have gotten a better salad from a bag. Once the meals arrived, the food wasn't hot it was lukewarm. The wings were soggy not crispy, not great and the vegetables look like someone dropped them around hot sauce and they were messy. The corn dogs for some reason were served with dipping Caesar dressing instead of ketchup or any other kid friendly dipping sauce. My son did not like them as they were too sweet. The calamari was not great, I expected much better and I could have gotten the same out of a frozen bag of calamari fried at home. The best tasting was the chicken alfredo pasta even though it needed a bit of salt and it was over priced at $15. The waitress failed to come back to check on us a couple of times and my husband was given samples of beer and she forgot to come and ask him if he wanted an order of either one of them until it was way too late. The only good thing was the  $1.50 kudSundays and that's about it. Overpriced food and bad service.  Very very disappointed."
Willie W.,"Winter Springs, FL",0,18,,1.0,7/3/2016,"There are so few decent restaurants in Winter Springs that I really wanted to like this place. First time with the family it was OK. We kept coming back because of the nearby location. But After about six meals I told my wife I was done with BJ's. The service is consistently clumsy and the dishes remind me of microwaved Swanson's or something equally bland. The crew exhibits little teamwork. For example, the food runner plopped our lunch on the table and looked bewildered when I ordered a glass of Zinfandel (Ravenswood is what they offer). Our original waitress showed up 10 minutes later with a container of white zinfandel. She failed to return before the well-intended manager asked the obligatory, ""How is everything?"" I mentioned the wine snafu and he trotted off, returning with the correct beverage. But he left empty glasses on the crowded table instead of clearing them. Simple story but it illuminates a typical experience. If the food were delicious I could overlook the stumbling staff. But It's not even close to good. Big chain, big menu, trying to be too many things without nailing anything. Wait. The beer is pretty good."
Dan C.,"Stockbridge, GA",0,14,,3.0,3/20/2016,"Great service. Big beer selection. Brew house brand beers are ok. Nothing stood out as being exceptional. Stick with the visiting beers. Huge menu selection which may be why food is average at best. I would not avoid the place, but I would not wait for a table either."
Natalie C.,"Winter Springs, FL",0,22,,2.0,10/27/2015,"Contemplated writing a review while at the dinner table tonight because service was miserable. We made reservations ahead of time and had to wait 5 min past to be seated which was no problem. The time from being seated to walking out after dinner for a party of 8 was 2.5 hours!! Our waitress was MIA for 10-15 minutes at a time when we wanted to order more drinks, order appetizers, order dinner, dessert etc. food was good but definitely not worth the wait. Would much rather eat and drink at other establishments in the area. Not sure how many complaints they need in order to resolve their service issues!!"
Chris M.,"Weaverville, NC",11,23,11,1.0,10/11/2015,If you like frozen food items this is the place to go. The appetizers lack flavor (unless salt counts) and were super greasy. First and last time here.
Lashantz N.,"Casselberry, FL",10,28,65,5.0,12/13/2014,This is my 3rd time eating at BJs. Second time at this location. The food and drinks have been great every time. Last time I came to this location the server was not very attentive. Tonight Jerrod is serving us and is great! Love the Pizookies!
Christopher D.,"Orlando, FL",1,1,,1.0,11/1/2015,Whent for lunch on saterday with my wife and daughter service was slow I took about 45 minutes to get are food my wife's was cold my was warm but I looked like it had Ben sitting in the kitchen under a heat lamp my daughter's Mac @ cheese was the only thing that was hot
Longwood R.,"Longwood, FL",0,87,4,2.0,9/1/2015,"We've been to a few of the BJ Brewhouses...this was our second trip here to this one.  Simply not impressed with the quality and service.  Chips that came with the spinach dip were dripping grease...comment from the server, ""yeah...hmmm....they are like that when the come out of the fryer"" and walks away.  My dinner which, the fire roasted barbacoa chicken, was a disaster.  How to describe...a frozen chicken patty that has the texture of rubber...you know what I'm talking about...you really have to go at it with a knife to cut vs fork split....I just didn;t trust that it was cooked.  The waiter saw me poking and prodding at it but showed no empathy.  I'm not one to send anything back and my family didn't want to make a scene...so I ate everything else on the plate except for it.  Again, at other restaurants, a server would ask if I didn't like it and offer to make it right....nothing. When we have a craving for BJ we'll stick with the one by the Mall of Millenia (or even Gainesville).  I guess I'll also stick to the burgers."
Caitlin S.,"Harrisburg, PA",5,6,,4.0,12/13/2014,"I love this place! Their food has never disappointed me. I've been off their light menu most times and have been blown away each time. I also had their white pizza, so so so so good.  My friend and I tend to go later at night on a Thursday, 8:45ish, and we've never had to wait for a table. We've had one rude-ish waitress but she just seemed like she had a long day. Still love this place."
Nicholas L.,"Oviedo, FL",0,3,,1.0,10/26/2015,"Tried getting something to eat here and wasn't even able to get a drink. The hostess was rude, the server incompetent. I'll never come back or recommend anyone to eat at this terrible over priced Fridays."
Rick S.,"Orlando, FL",8,454,6,3.0,1/2/2015,"Was going to Chilis but their fryers werent working and wanted more choices. So went across the street to BJs, I got the Pulled pork, others got burger, salmon, they liked thier entree. The service again the low point for this place, drinks were empty for at least 10 minutes. They delivered food in a group of servers so having a responsible server is not mandatory."
Shirley F.,"Winter Springs, FL",0,19,43,5.0,8/29/2014,"I have been here 5 times since they opened on August 11th, 2014. Have never been disappointed. The decor of the restaurant is awesome, the staff very cordial and professional and the their food will make your taste-buds do a happy dance."
Kara G.,"Oviedo, Orlando, FL",37,1,,5.0,2/3/2016,We loved our server. He was very personable and shared his new pizookie idea with us. If you don't pick the gingerbread pizookie next holiday season we will be very disappointed!
Paul P.,"Oviedo, FL",5,44,33,2.0,9/6/2014,"Won't be hurring back here anytime soon. So call to put our name on the priority seating list. The girl takes my name and says approx 15-20 min wait time but we give your table priority when you arrive. We arrive a little more than 15 min after calling and check in. We check in and inform the hostess of our priority seating. The hostess say about 20 min wait... um OK. people behind us come in and did not have priority seating 2 in their party 2 in my party after almost 30 min waiting guess who got seated first? They did! I went to the hostess and asked what the deal was and she said oh um um I just texted you? Well I don't have any texts... well she says you'll probably get one soon but I'll seat you now.  Gee thanks glad I came up to complain. Btw we are going on 18 hours now and still no text message. So priority seating is a joke.  We get seated, ambience is cool but if your seated in the center row of 2 person booths there is a chin hight wall between you and the party on the other side  it's a bit weird cause your 12"" away for the other persons head and facing each other so you can't help but hear their whole conversation and them yours.  Waitress arrives and was rather rude and totally rushed us. She asked if we wanted to put in an appetizer and my wife's says ummm honey what do you think about this one and before she finishes the waitress says well you all think about it I'll be back... really???? Oh sorry to take up 45seconds of your time. She comes back and takes our order wife's asked her what's her opinion between two different dishes she was looking at and the waitress says oh well their both good which one do you want. Once again really??? Thanks for the help. She did all of a sudden get very nice and polite when she dropped the check off...  We ordered the California burger, with the tomato and mozzarella salad and the bison burger. Both were fair nothing to write home about but not bad either a little skimpy of the meat in my opinion.  The Salad was very good but also very small seemed like about half what you would get elsewhere.   Anyway fair food, rude wait staff, and incompetent hostesses does not make me want to come running back let alone to wait 30+ minutes to be seated."
Jennifer R.,"Orlando, FL",143,524,67,4.0,10/5/2014,"Yay! Finally a BJ's closer to my house than Millennia location. Because it is so new, and we decided to go on a Friday night, our wait was pretty long but we scored a table by the bar when downtown decided to leave. I really love their pizza but my boyfriend says BJ's has one of the best burgers he's ever had. The beer selection is awesome, food is great, and the service is awesome. I will be back and back again!"
Eileen H.,"Oviedo, FL",0,6,1,5.0,12/31/2014,"My friends and I sat at the bar and closed the restaurant down Saturday night.  We had a great time, especially trying different drinks.  The bartender, Kyle, was very nice and chatted with us.  The bruscetta we had was delicious, but a smaller portion."
Tony B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",46,122,66,5.0,5/10/2015,"This was my first time at this particular location. We decided to have my graduation dinner here since it is large, they have a good variety of food and drinks and could accommodate the amount of people we were going to have. BJ's did an amazing job with my graduation dinner! Our servers Amanda and Stephanie were absolutely fantastic! We had 27 people attend my dinner. Everyone's food and drink orders were taken care of without a problem. It is extremely rare to go anywhere and not have at least a slight issue with something. I can honestly say there wasn't one issue and I will certainly be back here for dinner soon. Everyone in our party had a great time and commented on how well the restaurant handled our party. Big thanks to BJ's."
Beatrice G.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,,2.0,8/5/2015,Went there on a Wednesday night.  We decided to go there and try the burgers.  The hand crafted beer and soda was exellent.  The burgers were average but the service was terrible.  Our waitress kept disappearing and it took almost 2 hours to get two burgers.  Won't be back!!!
Lynn G.,"Orlando, FL",31,29,20,4.0,10/15/2014,"Had a great time...beautiful space, really good service by Eric from New York.  HUGE menu.  Happened to check calorie count of menu while I was the passenger en route.  Most of the menu is ridiculously fat & calorie laden.  We managed to find the lighter items & enjoyed them immensely.  I wish this & other restaurants would just make good food that's good for us.  Price point could easily accommodate a delicious healthier based menu."
