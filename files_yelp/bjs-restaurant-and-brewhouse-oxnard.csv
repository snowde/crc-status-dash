Eriko P.,"Santa Monica, CA",188,424,2582,5.0,10/28/2017,"Quick and easy! We were hungry. We arrived around 2:30pm on a Friday. The Lunch menu is valid until 3pm, Monday- Friday, so I took advantage of it and ordered the  Lemon Thyme  chicken over rice, brussel sprouts, tomatoes and more. ( $11.95) This was perfectly cooked and tender.The overall flavors of this dish was perfect. I could of ordered another one, but refrained.  My friend ordered 2 grilled fish tacos which come with guacamole and salsa. She loved her fish tacos and salsa, but the guacamole was runny, and liquid like and tasted like it came out of a can.  For dessert we ordered their famous pizookie! It is a cookie baked in a baking pan with an ice cream scoop on to. We loved the salted caramel which is quite sweet and sprinkled with tiny chococlate chips.We couldn't finish it, but that was fine. Right now, these are only $3.00!"
Amanda J.,"North Las Vegas, NV",44,2,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Put name on wait list on line for 6 people when we arrived we requested accommodations for an additional peraon who had decided to join us. Our wait time jumped up to an hour and a half. A group of 5 people arrived after us and was told they had a 15 minute wait time. I walked the dining room and noted an empty table for 8, large corner both (accommodate maybe 5-6) a table for 8, several booths that could fit 4 and a few other free tables. I asked to speak with the manager and when she arrived her demeanor was ""don't care"" from the start. Colletta, the dining room manager told me our time increased because we changed the number in out party.  A number that was 2 more than the party that arrived after us, a number that was one greater than the original request,  a number that could easily had been accommodated based on the available tables vs. Patrons waiting in the dining room (us and the party of 5....)  When I asked how this is was possible when I observed many empty tables in the dining room Coletta met me with disdain and attitude. I was completely floored by her unwillingness to concede that ONE PERSON MORE should not have prohibited us from being seated in a dining room that wasn't packed.  She was rude, I told her she was rude and requested her DM's contact info.  She was quite smug when walking away to receive it. Fortunately we received much better service down the road at Lazy Dogs.  It's not so much that the time increased but it was Coletta's demeanor , that's what really angered me."
Omar D.,"Oak View, CA",29,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Was expecting a better experience, but unfortunately my food was dropped and I had to wait even longer then I already did initially. The waitress (Tina Marie B.) told me the manager was going to come over and speak with me, but he never made it my way so I feel like the manager nor the waitress cared enough to check up on me. If the manager had come by to speak with me like I was told it could've changed my experience tonight (11/26/17) but like I stated before nobody came by to speak with me. If I could I wouldn't even give BJ's a star. I wouldn't give it any type of acknowledgment because that would imply that I enjoyed my experience today even the slightest bit, but I didn't. Disappointed customer who won't be coming back. Key Note: I wasn't upset that my food wasn't free, but I'm upset with the fact that I had to wait while my table was enjoying their food and I wasn't compensated in ANY way, shape, or form."
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4426,2425,5439,3.0,12/25/2017,BJ's as a major chain is very mainstream in that their menu is safe and you will have a satisfying meal no matter what you order. Their chocolate cookie dessert is really yummy though.
Phyllis M.,"Oxnard, CA",288,180,569,3.0,8/15/2017,"My husband & I are Whole Foods-Plant Based. The easiest to describe this to someone who doesn't know what that means is to say we are vegan & do not eat refined sugars, flours or use much oil in our foods.  When we go out, we look at the obvious dishes that are vegetarian & look at how we can make it vegan (omitting cheese, butter or eggs). Salads, chips with salsa or guacamole, pizza minus the meat & cheese, veggie burgers or just ordering sides as entrées is an option.  Prefacing our order, I told the waitress we were vegan. I asked if the avocado egg rolls, had any dairy & found out that there is cream cheese in the mixture, which is pre-made. So, there was no way to order them without cream cheese. We ordered the ""vegetarian pizza"", minus the cheese. The mushrooms & olives that come with it, to be placed on only half of the pizza, as my husband hates them & I love them.  My nephew had the kids personal pan pepperoni pizza.  We ordered the chips & guacamole.  The chips & guacamole came quickly. I was hungry & so was my husband, so we attacked that appetizer. I thought it was just me, but the guac was very bland. They served a very small container of salsa, and I kept mixing the guac with it. I told my husband, ""Is it me or is this guac very bland?"" He said its bland. He tips the bowl over & said, ""There is no tomato, garlic, jalapeño, cilantro or lime. It's just a smashed avocado in this bowl!"" I shook my head.  Guacamole isn't very hard to make. It doesn't require culinary genius. It's literally mash up of a few simple ingredients. Even a college student in a dorm room can do that. I looked at him & told him not to bother complaining. So we decided we'll just wait for the pizza.  My nephew got his kids pizza first. He loved it & said it was delicious. We waited a few more minutes & finally got ours only to find that THERE WAS CHEESE ALL OVER IT!!! The very first request we made was ignored. I think the staff needs to be educated as to what veganism is.  We let the server know that ours was with no cheese. He quickly took it back. The waitress didn't come to our table right away to apologize for it until a later. She stated that they did make a mistake & it had a rush on it.  We finally did receive our pizza, it had no cheese (hooray!), but it did have the olives & mushrooms all over. We decided not to say anything as we were starving. I told my husband we would just pick off the mushrooms & olives for him & I'd take them. Later when we got our check, the waitress informed us that they took the pizza off our bill because of the mistakes they made. And we appreciate that.  I've been a patron of this restaurant for however long it's been here in Oxnard, which is about 15 years. I have had many great meals, fun times, awesome drinks & even had a couple of birthday parties here. I have always had great service & the staff has always been very friendly & nice, so I won't stop coming here. They make an effort to make right, what mistakes they have made, but I will say this, in some respects the overall service has declined at BJs & not just at this location, a few weird things have happened at the Thousand Oaks/Westake location as well. I had my wedding rehearsal dinner at that BJs, and was disappointed by a few things. I will post my review for them under that stores Yelp page at another time.  The best thing to do to make sure any restaurant gets your order done correctly is to ask the waitress/waiter to read the order back to you to prevent mistakes."
George T.,"Camarillo, CA",36,45,175,3.0,6/4/2017,"I like Bj's but it seems this particular location has a service issue. I have been to this location twice and the service was not good. We came in and did not have to wait to be seated but that was where the fun ended. We had to wait 15+ minutes for our server to acknowledge our existence. Our server seemed that she did not want to be at work.  Luckily for us, she went on break and our new server was attentive and so much better until it was time to pay. We had to wait 15-20 minutes to cash out. Our original waitress came back and saw we were trying to pay and ignored us or it seemed to us that was the case. To be fair, it seemed our original server had to many big tables and that would be a management issue. On another note, the food was good. Our table ordered a Black and Bleu burger, sirloin steak and Salmon as well as kids pizza. Everyone enjoyed their food. I also had a wedge salad that was tasty. The beer is also good at BJ's if that's your thing.  If BJ's improves their service, I'd be happy to increase their rating."
Tee S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,70,40,4.0,10/15/2017,"The customer service here was awesome! Our food was delivered to our table really fast and they allowed us to try several of the beers before making a decision on what to order. Our waiter was super patient and helpful with recommendations and while we were waiting for our food several other people checked on our table.  I wasn't too crazy about the food, I thought the flavor was a little bland. If you get anything I recommend the avocado egg rolls. Either way I'll always be coming back here for the drinks and the Pizookie!"
John T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",117,55,9,1.0,1/1/2018,"So i pop in to watch the Rose bowl here because it is close to my hotel...i sit at the bar, i had a very friendly bartender to start Ashley, who introduced me to the bj blond micro brew...which, was very good fyi! I had a little chips and salsa to go along with my ale and was watching an amazing that went to overtime. But i don't know if it had anything to do with Ashley going on break, but as i sat at the bar after ordering my tacos, i noticed that tow other customers came and sat down and received there food...and mine wasn't there. Disappointed...but the great game makes it okay...i just wonder if they have these issues when there isn't a game too, it might make for a poor experience"
Reid W.,"Ojai, CA",7,13,3,1.0,12/30/2017,"These new computer iPads they carry around and type orders into are the stupidest idea ever created by what I can only assume is a corporate accountant. They are impersonal, rude, I have a hard enough time getting my kids to pay attention, let alone some lady typing in food on a dumb pad! Get real, why do I even need the waitress? Why not just let me order st the table on my own iPad and skip with the formality of a fake waitress. I will never come back, used to come here weekly. Hate them, the waitresses hate them and I know I'm not alone."
Reggie D.,"Camarillo, CA",379,3,6,4.0,11/28/2017,Bj's is always a nice and quick dine in spot. I was craving chicken parmigiana but they didn't have it on the menu. But our server was able to modify an item and created it just for me. I was really satisfied and impressed. Portion was huge and it only cost 16.50. Definitely going to come back anytime for a bite.
Brisa T.,"Santa Maria, CA",67,152,70,4.0,7/23/2017,"First time even hearing about this chain. First impression of the place brought to mind chains like Buffalo Wild Wings but without the exaggerated sports crap. Definitely geared more towards a relaxed semi-casual experience. The establishment was fairly clean however the menus came sticky. The menu had a good variety of offerings. Poultry, beef, pork, fish and even some vegetarian stuff. Craft beers, mainstays and cocktails, plenty in number. They also have a kids menu with more than 3 items. (+1) I ordered a beer sampler and was not disappointed. I also had their Ahi salad and that was excellent."
Natalie R.,"Oxnard, CA",0,11,14,4.0,10/19/2017,"For a Wednesday around 3pm, it was pretty dead. We were seated quickly, helped quickly and our food arrived in a timely manner. The only con was there was not very many vegan options, other than salad there were 2 vegan meals. I ordered lentil soup in the bread bowl and it was quite good and served hot. I would give them 5 stars if they had more vegan options. They're menu is jam packed with meat dishes"
Maggie B.,"Oxnard, CA",25,9,6,5.0,6/18/2017,"I want to acknowledge the above and beyond service from Oscar and Alison. Both served us and gave us a world class experience.  Alison, ensured a table was set up for us outside in the patio.  Initially there was not a table but she moved one out to ensure we could have a place where to enjoy dinner on Fathers Day! Cheers!"
Michelle L.,"Santa Paula, CA",45,12,1,5.0,12/18/2017,"Very happy and satisfied! every time I have been to this restaurant We always get good service , I have had my birthday dinner and my daughters as well with a lot of people and staff is very quick and nice makes you feel welcomed and comfortable. Food is always great. Really recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try something new."
Kym B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",55,68,83,5.0,9/22/2017,"My husband this year, asked me where I wanted to go eat for my B'day. BJ's was the winner this time! I needed a Poozokie for dessert! Such great food with a good vibe. Sometimes there is a wait, but that's only because the food is good! Thinking positive people!"
Jason C.,"Ventura, CA",56,9,,1.0,11/11/2017,WARNING!! DO NOT USE THEIR DELIVERY SERVICE.  If I could give zero stars I would.  Thought we would try their delivery and boy what a nightmare.  Ordered two Cobb salads and chicken tenders at 5:40pm.  Called at 6:40pm and was told it was being boxed and will be leaving soon.  Called at 7:25 and told the driver is leaving with it right now.  Called at 8:05 and was told they dropped the ball and offered to send us a discount card.  Poor management and severe incompetence. UPDATE:  Doorbell just ringed at 9:15pm with our food.  After we cancelled the order at 8:05.  What idiots!
Beth H.,"Ventura, CA",1,33,2,5.0,11/9/2017,"We met great friends for a spontaneous dinner at BJ's for dinner. It was busy early, but we were seated promptly & our server Matt was right over to take our order. We were surprised to receive beautiful glasses of Chardonnay at a ""brewery"" restaurant. The menu is extensive & everything we ordered was really good. When you can pull off ahi tuna & pizza in the same kitchen you have some awesome chefs in the kitchen. Thanks Matt. See you soon!"
Brandon M.,"Santa Paula, CA",34,105,443,2.0,9/12/2017,"I don't go out to eat often. I don't have a ton of extra money. I can't always go out with my family; but this Tuesday I came to BJ's with my family.  We ordered our food and when it came, the two steaks were not cooked as ordered. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was well done. So when the waiter finally came around, I tell him and he points out that he asked the cooks why it was cooked for so long. WTF? So you new? They knew? He takes it away, and it took so long, my family either had to let their food get cold or eat without me, so I sat there for a while twiddling my thumbs like an idiot while my family enjoyed their meal. Eventually, my steak finally showed back up and the middle was cold. Refrigerator cold. Medium-rare is supposed to be just about room temp. At this point my family was DONE eating, so I got to package up my SECOND improperly cooked steak and I didn't get to eat anything, let alone enjoy a meal with my family. At no point did I receive an apology, a free drink, not even some kind words of empathy for wasting my time and ruining my family meal. I wasted my time and spent money I can't often spend. If neither my family's time or our meal were worth your effort, then I won't be your patron."
Jared L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",35,20,7,1.0,2/26/2017,"Stay away from this place!!!! It's a complete and total ripoff!!!. Ordered from this place from 805togo. $10 delivery fee (which okay not that bad it's the delivery service not the restaurant) plus two triple decker sandwiches which were $14.80 each and a small cookie/ice cream dessert for about $5.  The sandwiches were absolute crap. I mean a cold sandwich for $14 and it doesn't even have bacon!? Plus they just put an extremely small amount of mustard on it. I ordered a baked potato with all the fixings on it which was also horrible. And plus who puts a strip of bacon on a baked potato?  The dessert. Pshh. A tiny, hard, probably baked yesterday cookie and what was pretty much a teaspoon of ice cream.  Definitely NOT a $50 meal!!!. Never going back again and going to go above and beyond to tell people to stay way from this rip off craphole."
Deb H.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,8,,3.0,12/11/2017,"No Barcardi (bar was totally out of stock) for drinks and half of the Avocado appetizers were brown, this is not the BJ's I know.  Very disappointed, should have asked for a discount from manager.  Service is getting bad also, waited forever for refill of soda twice and beer refills."
Corner H.,"Golf Course, Oxnard, CA",15,1,,1.0,12/9/2017,This place was horrible. They told us 10 minutes and we waited 45 minutes which in some cases is understandable. HOWEVER they allowed people with the app to get in before us even though we had waited forever. We were told people with the app get priority over walkins. They have no respect for thier customers time so we left.
Anthony C.,"London, United Kingdom",3,38,15,1.0,10/27/2017,"I've came to BJs for lunch a week ago and today as well. Let's start with a week ago. Food was good. Service was iffy. Asked for another minute to order because I'm not familiar with Bjs menu. 10 minutes later before I walked out the server came back. Had to track down my server to pay so I could leave smh.  Today we went for my fiances birthday. From start to finish was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. Made sure to have our orders ready so we didn't have to wait this time. Asked for a cheeseburger and it came with no cheese, our waters were NEVER refilled once, a guest of my fiance had asked for some buffalo sauce I finished my food before the sauce came for my fiance's guest, had to ask for Ketchup THREE times. We were never checked on always had to get the waitress attention. Excuse my language but by the looks on her face she didn't give a S*** either she was having the worst day of her life or she plain out has a bad attitude. Asked for the bill. Was given the bill, then the waitress disappears ......waiting and waiting we go to the front desk front desk says we have to wait for our waitress...........front desk can clearly see we have been waiting a while and another person comes and says they can take our payments. Finally we get to pay and leave. Being a past server and knowing someone's birthday is special and today's service was completely unacceptable. I refuse to return."
Scott K.,"Merced, CA",3,10,,4.0,12/3/2017,"My Fiance and her mom made earlier reservations.  We showed up  at 6:30 pm when we made the reservation.  We waited for awhile no longer than 5 min. We where seated and are waiters came and took are drinks after sitting there a few minutes.  Sarah was very sweet and helpful to us. She did also take are order and was very sweet, smiles and pulite.  When are good came back me and my Fiance got are order wrong. Her mom got the right order but her potatoes where cold , ask if she could get them  reheated.  The gentleman  who gave us are food said she have to take them back and she have to wait awhile do to busy time. She was fine and very polite he came back in about 5 minutes with  curly potoes.  She just eat the  potoes and never said anything.  The waiter Sarah was very  appoligecte to her. She also apologised about getting are order wrong. And told us she told her bos about her mistake.  Never experienced anything like that before.  Very sweet I give her 4 stars it truly is a very hard job and I give her lots of credit."
Deborah W.,"Oxnard, CA",30,27,13,5.0,7/12/2017,Having lunch with dad. Shrimp asparagus penne pasta. Served very hot and a good flavor
Krista W.,"Oxnard, CA",10,5,1,1.0,9/29/2017,This place supports racism. Had dinner last night and a white man was yelling a couple who happened to be Mexican about going back to their country etc. Well he got mad broke a glass like he was going to cut them and the workers there had the audacity to console the man who was in the wrong and the aggressor! They didn't comp that poor couple. Never will I eat here again! I work for a large corporation that orders out from here and when I let them know what BJs really represents they too will have a bad taste in their mouth. Shame on you BJs get it together!
John S.,"Lompoc, CA",3,13,10,5.0,4/12/2017,"I love BJ's brewer's and always ate in my home town of Valencia however after a long drive home from LA I met up with a friend in Oxnard and stopped for some pizza, a drink, and a pizooki. I hadn't eaten there in about 2 years since I moved to Lompoc and everything was perfect.  Our server, Savanah I think, was attentive, followed up numerous times and helped me decide on a drink based on my notes of what I generally like. The restaurant was clean, no sticky menu's and food was served cooked, still warm, and to perfection.  If I am back in that area again, I will definitely be back. I do wish they bring back the oatmeal pizooki sometime, even if just for special time frames."
Donna S.,"Ventura, CA",45,33,29,5.0,7/12/2017,What can I say? BJ'S IS on a role.we ate here last night and just had have more. I  highly recommend the Tumeri  roasted cauliflower.  My husband loves their soup in a bread bowl.  Nt to mention the  beer battered asparagus. Very good service. Warm an welcoming.
Terrell P.,"Camarillo, CA",0,5,2,1.0,12/18/2017,"Terrible take out service. Do not order food to go from this location. We ordered for about 20 people morning of with expected delivery time 6 pm. Driver came with food at noon. After explaining to him we wanted our food fresh and to come at 6 he left. Apparently he never relayed the message back and come 6 no food. After calling the location they said my food had already been delivered and that there was no record of a mix up etc. spoke to Lisa who was not polite and instead of offering to give us a discount or throw in a pazookie, only gave me attitude. Food finally got there over two hours late. Not a fun Christmas party with 20 hungry people. I will not be ordering food from this location again, and urge anyone else to consider other options if you'd actually like to receive your food as well."
Monica V.,"Ventura, CA",54,108,89,1.0,11/13/2016,"This one star is for their brunch and the bartender, Kevin. I'm a fan of their happy hour. Kevin at the bar sucks! He didn't acknowledge us for over 10 minutes and we were sitting right at the bar. A couple next to us left and complained since they never got any service. I wish we followed them. It wasn't busy at all. He threw our napkins at us because he said he couldn't reach us (all the other bartenders on previous visits had no problem). We had to stare him down to place our food order while he was visiting with his co-workers doing nothing. We had to ask for utensils and refills on drinks. I ordered a pizookie and it came out raw! (good thing he got our order wrong and ordered a mini instead of a small) He was awful! If he's ever behind the bar if you're there do yourself a favor and leave!"
Michelle L.,"Oxnard, CA",836,250,2676,3.0,9/24/2016,"Every single visit I've attended here with a large party, the service is horrible for dinner time. You're better off coming here for lunch or being at the bar. Here is my breakdown of my last experience & this is why I do not recommend this bar/restaurant for service purposes: Arrived at 7:45pm & sat with a party of 15. There were 4 of us that needed to order & not one single waitress or waiter came up to us until 8:30pm. That is a solid 45 minutes of wait time including 1 of one us went up front to ask for a waitress. Ordered our drinks & food & it was not served until 9:15pm. I wish I was over exaggerating but this wasn't the first time it has happened even if we reserved for a party.  * Service: 1-2 out of 5 stars. The waitress taking our orders was yelling as if she was demanding ""going once... going twice... gone"" type of attitude. If I could recommend the tall, skinny, Caucasian girl with black glasses I would prefer her enthusiastic attitude. I get it, we're a large party, but I wish it was handled better both timing & approach were bad. One of my other visits here we had to ask for the manager & she was sweet about our request. I don't know if staffing here is always short but they do not consistently check up on their tables as much as they should. We're simple customers that just wanted to eat & go, but if you're planning to be here for a ""short dinner"" for a good hour or so, expect the wait. * Drinks/Food: Other than the service, food is always a good 4 out of 5 stars. From beer on tap to appetizers to their main entrees, the portion sizes are shareable. Is the food worth the wait? To be honest, throughout the years when BJ's first opened this was one of Oxnard's top bar/restaurants for young adults. Nowadays, the service has gone downhill since. I wouldn't say ""worth"" the wait, but this type of ""wait"" is unnecessary for customer service with us being seated already. * Ordered: - BJ's Berry Burst Cider (5/5 stars): It's for breast cancer awareness month so it's on their ""pink drink"" list! It has a good fruity taste.  - Great White deep dish, small was good for 2 (4/5 stars): I like their deep dishes here. Fulfilling dish of carbs. - Crispy Portobello strips (4/5 stars): If you love mushrooms, this one is for you! It's basically mushroom fries but with deep fried batter & ranch.  From pastas to appetizers to pizookies, it's a ""decent"" dinner. Hence the 3 stars for A-okay. Could be better if it was served on a timely manner.  Again, if you're here for happy hour or a visit in general, I've gotten way better service for lunch time & for a smaller party. Cheers!"
Sue C.,"Moorpark, CA",8,68,35,3.0,5/18/2017,"The food is pretty consistently good, but their new computerized system between the servers and the kitchen has some glitches that need to be worked out with perhaps more staff training?  And perhaps when errors occur, the staff and management should not just say ""sorry"" as they whisk your prepared appetizers away when you tell them you would have preferred eating said appetizers before your meal and not after. Of course, take it off the bill, but nice restaurants offer a free dessert as an apology.  Or a gift card for a free appetizer next visit. We walked out feeling like we had half a meal, which we did, as we ordered less to have room for an appetizer.  It is not enjoyable to go out for more food right after  eating!"
MJ T.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,23,60,5.0,2/28/2017,"As a food lover, I eat at many many restaurants, and Bj's happens to be one of my go-to's. Food is always 9/10 and sometimes better. Best part is that you can always customize your meal with no expense unless you add extra of course. I think their quality of food is outstanding. I mean, you can tell it was made right of the oven or grill. Most of the food is on the ""clean"" side and not so greasy. I love how everything has its own unique flavor, because if you take an extra moment and reflect on some other restaurants dishes, some things taste the same. At Bj's, there's a huge difference from the steaks, to chicken, between the variety of salads, the pastas and most importantly, the pizzas and pizookies. Flavor is on point all the timeeeeee!  I advise you to order something different everytime you come back. Try something new. You won't be disappointed! I love trying new things and going out of my usual orders.  I definitely recommend the pizzas. They are absolutely one of a kind and you just have to try it out yourself if you haven't. They're stuffed with fresh toppings, the dough is thick, there isn't really a crust BUT the edges and outer dough has that perfect crunch you look for in a pizza.  Lastly, you MUST get a pizookie! There are so many flavors and all of them are insanely good. They recently added a chocolate mint one and I have yet to try it. My favorite is the classic chocolate chip, but the macadamia one has huge macadamia pieces that make the entire cookie amazing.  ALSO, check out their website prior to going because they usually have great deals, like BOGO or discounts! Take advantage of free pizookies when its offered!"
Greg B.,"Texarkana, TX",0,26,,5.0,10/8/2017,"Great place for the family. Flatbread pizzas are great. Personal favorite is Parmesan crusted chicken. They also have Pepsi products, which is a plus."
Jim K.,"Camarillo, CA",1371,503,3770,5.0,7/23/2016,We stopped in here for appetizers and beer both were great  We sat at the bar and the service was great. we got the poke stack and the deep fried portobella mushrooms we  washed them down with a cold beer and headed out in search of oysters at another location. BJ's never lets us down for food and service they have the science down.
Rosanne D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,10,,1.0,11/27/2017,"What a joke. This establishment does not care if you have a good experience or not.  I had to review to protect the next consumer. The managers,  the servers , the cook, the front desk girls don't care. What a waste of my time and money. My meal was messed up the first time and tasted nasty the second time out. Thanks for the garlic ball of disgust you called a chicken club. Thanks for not caring. Thanks for nothing. If I could have given you negative stars for your food quality I would. You have completely gone downhill in your quality and your service."
BreAnne H.,"Ventura, CA",27,17,3,5.0,10/3/2017,We had our 2 year anniversary party for my employer at the Oxnard location. It was great we were able to all sit together in a separate room outside of the large restaurant so that we were able to conversate with each other to celebrate. We only had one waiter I did not catch his name but he did a wonderful job everyone's orders was correct and he never broke a sweat he was great.
Eric G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1041,186,59,1.0,8/3/2016,"This place has capsized. The service is awful. Tables leaving. Wrong drinks. Slow slow slow. Painfully slow. The kids mac n cheese was inedible. Gross. I made them make it again. It's Kraft. Wow. How do you screw that up? My steak was way over seasoned and mealy and who cuts a baked potato in half. Didn't BJs used to specialize in baked potatoes? What happened to the cool house salad that was a signature item? Then I was double charged for an item. Seriously, fire the manager and get someone in here and fix this place before it's too late. I've eaten here so many times. Something is wrong and it's systematic.  I'm still a fan of the deep dish pizza and appetizers. The rest should be avoided.  It's as if the owners made their money and just took off. Sad."
Exene M.,"Oxnard, CA",11,24,45,5.0,9/6/2017,This is by far my favorite restaurant in Oxnard. The employees are always nice and my order always comes out accurate. The restaurant is very clean and well kept. The food always comes out amazing and your server always checks up on you. They have a great variety of food for all ages. The adult drinks are always great. With a variety of types of beers/ales. It's never too loud in here which makes it great to go to catch up with an old friend or meet new friends.
Rachel W.,"Ventura, CA",669,482,1475,3.0,12/18/2015,"This is the second time our office has booked BJ's for Christmas Party, and I have to give props to the wait staff for being able to handle a group of 25 inebriated women (save me, who was still nursing a hangover from the festivities the night before, so loud noises were not my friend) and one male co-worker who gives clowns a bad name with his rude behavior. The wait time for our meals was a bit long, and while I realize a group of that size was challenging, some of the ladies ordered upon entering the restaurant, because they had to leave early, and the meals did not come out until almost an hour later, and one persons meal never came out so they had to reenter the order, and someone had to take it home for her and bring it to her today. As for the rest of us that stayed, there were many positive comments on the meals, one person ordered the Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes and corn, she said it was so moist and the coating on the chicken was cooked to perfection.  Another person got the BBQ Pizza, she said she gets it all the time and that everyone should order it. I saw an awesome Club Sandwich that made me wish I'd picked that over my order. Leading to my order: I chose the BBQ Brisket Burger,  which consisted of Patty topped with smoked brisket pieces, Applewood smoked bacon, shredded jack and cheddar cheese,  bbq sauce, red onions and mayonnaise. I asked for no Mayo, BBQ sauce and Mayo just did not sound right in this girls eyes.   Burger Wise, I was truly disappointed in this burger, the meat was dry, the bun was dry, the cheese was not melted, and there was little to no BBQ sauce on the burger.... the positive the wedge fries were good, and so was the Strawberry Margarita I had. The positives of the party:  The cocktails were awesome, the appetizers were good,  the staff were always polite, helpful, and really tried to keep things straight, they always brought us what we needed and tried to correct the mistakes they made. I've always liked BJ's, just because I didn't enjoy one burger, it won't stop me from going back and to be honest if you need to entertain a large party of people, this is the place to go."
Kristiana R.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/27/2017,"Yesterday my husband and I came here for lunch around 2:30. Upon arrival, the male host was very kind and said he would check on a table for us and sat us within a few minutes. He explained the promotions they had going on and told us to enjoy our meal, and that was the best customer service we had during our stay. Our waitress was a heavyset woman who wore a lot of makeup, looked about 20-something, but had no name tag. She was very unprofessional and not as attentive as I would have liked. As I am a server myself, I know that sometimes serving is not easy when it is busy. However, the restaurant wasn't busy at all yet I felt like she was never around when we needed something. When we asked for something she did not stop at the table she just kept walking by, not leaving any time for us to even ask for everything we needed. She seemed hasty for no reason. A table nearby had been there for a while just talking, and she would constantly ask them if they needed anything else, as if she wanted them to leave already. It just revealed more of her character in that she does not care for the customers, only the money. As we left the restaurant, I regretted tipping her the small amount that I did because I found that she was standing in the front very casually and lazily and talking to the male host. This must have been where she was during the times we needed something! I was very disappointed because I have never had bad service here.  Aside from the mediocre service, the food was fantastic! Which was probably the only reason I tipped at all because I know other employees of the restaurant get tipped. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, bone-in root beer glazed wings for my husband, and a chicken ranch piadina with sweet potato fries for me, and a chocolate chunk pazookie for dessert. Everything was delicious, though our server took a long time to bring us condiments such as ranch and ketchup.  I love BJ's and this will not be my last time going because the food is too good and the selection is so wide. However, I do not recommend this server and I do hope management can better train their employees to take better care of their customers."
