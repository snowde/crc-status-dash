Drew B.,"Culver City, CA",363,615,485,4.0,7/19/2013,"Been here a few times while traveling between LA and Santa Barbara. The last time was a big hit. previous times have been only ok. Ordered a beer, IPA and asked for a sample of the wit.  Susan, our super server brought me that and one other, Bonus. Ordered a small salad and that was a disappointment. Wait, she only charged us for an add salad $2.95. It was fine, small but normal.  Asked for a large BJs combo $24.50 well done. It came out cooked well but is now served on a plate instead of the deep dish pan. The kids had slideres and that worked out fine too. Mediocre review from me, but well executed dinner from Bjs."
Rachel B.,"Oxnard, CA",65,36,30,4.0,2/16/2016,"I've been there twice, good food. I haven't had any desserts from there. But food is good. I like the ambiance and I the staff are nice."
Jennie S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",4,17,14,1.0,8/23/2015,"Had to give a star to post. I'm not sure why I continue to come back to this location, service is awful. Took 20 min to get a glass of water after I ordered it. Good came out cold. I said I wanted to order dessert and asked for the menu, but it never came. I finally went online to review so when the waitress came back and said did you want dessert I said yeah, I wanted a menu though, but I went online myself. I guess I'll have to start heading to the Riverpark restaurants instead"
Crystal D.,"Oxnard, CA",4,46,43,1.0,5/25/2014,"I gave this place another shot to celebrate after a confirmation ceremony. Came at 9:30pm it was pretty mellow not so crowded or slow. We got our waiter & the first thing he says is the little kid playing with his you is the most annoying sound in the world!!   Anyways I decided to order pizza that I can customize(bbq chicken, pineapple, bacon) they said"" there's no bbq chicken but I can put bbq sauce in top"" which was fine. My brother ordered bbq chicken pizza with light cheese & extra bbq. While we waited for our food, 2 waiters have brought food to our table that wasn't even our order. A couple min passed by our waiter introduce our new waiter saying "" this girl is gonna take over my spot cuz I've been here all day & want to go home"" Finally got our food & they didn't put any bbq sauce on my customize pizza, my brothers pizza was extra cheese instead of light cheese & extra bbq sauce liked he ordered. I had to give 1 star because I didn't enjoy my pizza it was shitty!!"
Brandon K.,"Oxnard, CA",170,1,,5.0,2/29/2016,Had one of best experiences at BJs tonight. Lisa P is one of the best servers I have seen I a long time.
Lesley L.,"Camarillo, CA",5,33,3,4.0,11/11/2014,"I have been to this location numerous times and I have to say I've had pretty good experiences most of the time. The food is great! And they probably have the best margaritas in town!  My only complaint is that the margaritas are overpriced and so are their appetizers. You are looking to spend around $70 for two: with about 3 drinks and food.  Other than that, it's great!"
Stephanie L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",3,10,6,1.0,6/14/2014,So me and my friend came here to catch up two adults and two baby's .... So we were told about 25 min wait .. Waited at least fourth min and people that came after us were seated before us which is always annoying we ordered our food and drink at the same time to speed things up our appetizer came about half an hr later still no drinks . Ten min later our drinks came and at least another half an hour until our food came . And to top things off our waiter wasn't waiting on us at all most horrible experience here ever! And note if you want a actual cooked steak ask them to burn it because apparently when you ask for well done they think you mean a slab of raw meat.
Cody V.,"Oxnard, CA",283,2,,5.0,1/17/2016,"I came in with a group of my friends at 11pm and the first host had told us we could not sit in the dinning room that it was closed so we had to sit at the bar. THANKFULLY Bert, one of the managers, disregarded his hosts decision to not let our party in the dining room and Seated us there anyway. Thank you BERT(:"
Kristi N.,"Oxnard, CA",179,370,24,4.0,9/25/2012,"As a rule I try to stay out of chain restaurants. BJ's and In-N-OUT are the exceptions. Love the beer and love the food. I have never had anything bad here, just things I didn't like as much as other things. The burger is great, the Ceaser is great, the pizza is great (as pizza tends to be. They accommodate kids well: my nieces have loved this place thru grade school and now one is in college. She still loves BJ's I was disappointed my last visit they are no longer selling growlers to go. As I was driving and couldn't take a beer to enjoy at home I was left wishing I could have one more... I have also had the experience of buy a gift certificate here and lost it in the Christmas madness. They were able to get the information by the time of day I bought it and cheerfully replaced it. What the heck? that's customer service."
Emily F.,"Santa Paula, CA",131,5,,5.0,4/25/2016,"So I hadn't eaten here in about 9 years but I decided to come through because the restaurant was taking part in a cancer fundraiser for a friend of a friend. I'm so sad to know what I've been missing out on for 9 years!!! Everything was so good!! I got the kale and artichoke salad with salmon, my boyfriend got a chopped cobb I think and my son got chicken strips with potato wedges.  My salad was seriously so good and for desert we got the pizookie mini trio which were all fantastic but the money bread one was my favorite. But enough about the food, let's talk about the staff. I wish I had gotten names but I can tell you that every one from the moment we walked in was amazing.  Super friendly, polite, and always smiling. I'm just so impressed because it was BUSY and as a server myself I know how hard it can be to keep smiling when you're running from table to table like a crazy person. Lol.  This is definitely going to be a new favorite for date night."
Jacqueline M.,"Oxnard, CA",34,4,,1.0,12/5/2015,"Not only did they take forever to order our drinks on a Saturday night, but also took forever to bring me my bbq sauce I asked for when they brought me my steak, I was pratically done with it when they brought it. They were not that busy but made us wait all night like Obama was in the house.. I rather go to Buffalo Wild Wings or TGI Friday's.........."
Pablo M.,"Oxnard, CA",3,54,42,3.0,6/24/2016,The food and beer is really good. My big knock on this place is the service. It's consistently bad and the wait staff is more concerned with their conversations than you. It's quite a talent to ignore people trying to get your attention and these people have it!
James F.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,22,36,2.0,3/31/2015,"I ordered up a pizza for pickup. No problem with the take out counter, staff was certainly nice & helpful and I was in & out quickly. 5 stars for take out service.  The problem was with the pizza. Large pizza with not very much on top. Crust was fine and fluffy, but the toppings obviously show there is no attention to detail. If you hate your job, please quit but don't make food with out putting in a small bit of effort to make it correctly.  BJ's pizza used to be a nice pie with ample toppings at a moderate price which I was okay paying for knowing I was going to get a well made, properly cooked pizza pie. I'm not a regular as in every week or month but WOW it is truly a pathetic pizza. If I wanted a pizza with the sauce showing through because there was no cheese or toppings, I would pay the $5-6 for a Caesars or Papa Johns.  So disappointed. Not planning to go back and if for some reason I do, it won't be for pizza."
Nixi J.,"Oxnard, CA",0,25,,5.0,7/15/2016,"I go to this BJs all the time and it's great! The food is always delicious, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is perfect.  I always sit in the bar area and the service is great."
Natalie B.,"Ventura, CA",68,2,1,4.0,1/11/2016,It's a really nice place to hang out with friends and family .... U can watch ur favorite teams play on their big screens and eat some really good food .
Elena S.,"San Francisco, CA",22,4,,5.0,9/20/2015,"The Baby Back Pork Ribs are awesome, the service very fast, the beer just right for those how are thirsty. Great place!"
Greg G.,"Oxnard, CA",136,3,,1.0,1/1/2016,Horrible food idk what's going on in that kitchen but everything we ordered was cold and under cooked like it's been siting out for an hour. Also slow service.
Belen B.,"Ventura, CA",0,12,1,2.0,4/11/2014,"Went on a Thursday night for my grandsons birthday. The evening started out fine...we ordered the French dip 5, bison burger -great, calamari-yummy.  But they forgot my grandsons Mac and cheese and forgot the candle on his pazookie and no singing Happy Birthday ""we don't do that here"". The service, miscommunication and surly, and frankly a bit of an attitude by our waitress  Nicole brought our experience down a notch or two."
Ida P.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/9/2016,If you want service- don't come here. Horrible service. If they can't wait on so many tables- they shouldn't. First time here and I will never come again. The waiter went around to avoid us asking him for service. This waiter really needed to take a customer service 101. If I leave a penny tip- you know why. Oh wait a penny is too much for this service.
