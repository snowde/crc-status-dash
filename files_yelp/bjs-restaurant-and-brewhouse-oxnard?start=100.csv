Felicia D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",60,30,3,5.0,1/19/2017,"Went here today around five. Everything was amazing. Our server was literally the best server we have ever had. My cup wasn't empty the whole night which was awesome. Shivan I believe her name was, was awesome. She was very attentive always coming and checking on us. The food was great as well. My boyfriend is a chef and his steak was cooked perfectly which is very hard to do in his eyes. I got the brisket sandwich and wedge fries they were great and the servings were huge. I would highly recommend going here."
Azusa S.,"Oxnard, CA",2336,472,3987,1.0,9/10/2015,We hadn't been there in a while and now I know we don't go there. My hubby was craving a root beer float and it was good but that's where the good ends. He had the chicken club combo with wedge salad and it was horrible. The salad dressing was watery and the salad was limp. You could barely find the chicken in the club sandwich and the fries were cold. I had the fried chicken lunch with gravy on the side and I received it with gravy on top. The chicken was barely cooked and the corn was dry. Service was slow. So disappointed.
Lynn C.,"Port Hueneme, CA",26,60,44,3.0,6/26/2016,We asked to put baseball on the TV but us and someone else complained it wasn't soccer when it was on all the other tv's including the big screen.   Thought it was very rude food was good.
Kristine D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",494,134,376,3.0,3/24/2016,"Last night we came for a night-cap and sat at the bar. The restaurant and parking lot wasn't overpacked (thank god) and the service was great! Wonderful service from the bartender. She remembered my friends by what they ordered a few months ago - WOW! That shows not only great customer service, but attention to detail. But my friends are pretty memorable too :) Our bartender had a heavy pour (YASSS) and got our Pizookies out immediately. We left with happy and full bellies. Thanks BJ's!"
Steve n lisa K.,"Oxnard, CA",16,98,18,1.0,6/11/2016,"Where's the beef? Slow service for brunch.  Bloody Mary not good. Screaming kids.  What is this Chucky Cheese. Cold food,  don't do brunch."
Adam H.,"Ventura, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/11/2016,"6:30 Friday night, half the tables are empty bar is full but had to wait with at least 40 other guests for over 30 min for a table. Finally got a table, no silverware or napkins, waited 10 min for a server to appear. Finally got drinks and an appetizer. Still no silverware and only cocktail napkins to wipe the slobber off with. Dinner finally comes out, finally had to plead for silverware from the busboy. 10 min into the meal, I finally get the water I ordered with my beer which has now been empty since the 2nd slice of pizza. Needless to say, service was extremely poor. I'm going to pin most of the blame on management for not providing enough waitstaff for one of the busiest periods of the week. With all the above said, the food was actually quite good and made it out the table hot. And the pazookie was also excellent as usual. After dropping $30 a person for crappy service, I think I will be skipping BJ's for awhile and opting for a more homey place for a good beer and meal without having to fume about the service."
Rick S.,"Moorpark, CA",0,5,,4.0,7/18/2016,The Sriracha Brussel sprouts are incredible. Always a nice experience.
Breana D.,"Ojai, CA",23,41,99,1.0,4/4/2016,"I ordered take out the other night and asked for the small blt salad, and the lemon thyme chicken with no peppers, onions or tomato, so the only veggies would have been brussel sprouts. First mistake was packaging the salad and the hot entree together, basically cooking my spinach blt salad and making the spinach warm, mushy, and gross. Moving on to my entree the chicken was amazing but all I received was 2 pieces of chicken and a togo box full of rice and no veggies... Next time I will check my food before leaving a 20% tip on take out... The one perfect part of my night was the triple chocolate pizookie!"
Kristen A.,"Downtown, Las Vegas, NV",1,74,67,1.0,12/1/2016,"Worst customer service! it tends to happen whenever I come here, hoping that each time will be different. We never received our utensils, hardly was checked up on, & by the end of the night our waitress Tina made our transactions much more complicated than it should have been. She tried to combine three transactions into one & gave me a hard time & was not listening. I definitely do not want her service again, given that this is my first post and the worst experience i've had from bjs."
Marisa O.,"Camarillo, CA",14,8,,5.0,1/6/2017,Oh my gosh they have the best Martini I have ever had in my life!!!! Rainbow Sherbert martini!!! It's going to be the slut drink for sure!! Spaghetti was so flavorful and absolutely delicious!! I had the beer sampler and the waitress was so amazing and kind enough to let me know to drink from light to dark because if I didn't I wouldn't be feeling very good and I'm so grateful she did that for me! Service was above and beyond and fassst!! Definitely two thumbs up!!
Erica R.,"Camarillo, CA",0,16,2,1.0,12/28/2016,Came here with my sister. Waited 30 min to be seated which is fine it was busy. Sat at our table and waited 25 min before our waiter even acknowledged us. When she did it was very short and non friendly. Then we waited 40 minutes for our food when my sister finally asked for the manager. She came and said she'd see where our food is. And that was the last we saw of her. The waitress came 4 min later with our food she literally put the plates down and walked away really fast. Was hoping to see the manager again which we didnt. Was hoping to get a free dessert or something for the crappy service and the fact we were there for 2 hours just waiting most of the time. Not going here again. We'll try thousand oaks next time.
Vishal M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,2,1,1.0,1/9/2015,"This is the worst BJ's i have been to!! I went to restroom and there was no toilet paper in the men's restroom and no paper napkin i talk to server right away. it's been 30 minutes still there is no tissue papers in men's restroom! They took almost 19 minutes to serve us a glass of water!! Me and my wife we are vegetarian and we specifically told server that make sure there is no meat in our food and there was bacon on the top of our food. tried to talk to manager, she came after 14 minutes to talk to us!! Worst customer service ever!!  Don't go to this BJ's in oxnard!!!!"
Paulina B.,"Oxnard, CA",1,7,2,5.0,7/2/2016,Just had lunch there in the bar area and had a great experience. Our server was very professional and on point with everything. I had the salmon on couscous plate and it was delicious!!  Love BJ's!
Michael F.,"Ventura, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/8/2017,"Somehow they missed my already low expectations for a chain restaurant. My visit was on a Sunday evening, mostly older people and families were there at this time. We were sat next to a table of overly loud people(pretty much at shouting volume). They had been drinking and were borderline drunk. Every other word they spoke was offensive, sexual in nature or profanity. This normally does not bother me but this was daytime hours when families were around. Tables surrounding them were visibly upset by this scene. The worst part of this was the mother at the table chugging her drink and describing sexually explicit acts while holding her infant.  When I was about to complain to a manager I watched him walk over to the table and sit with them and join in on the ""fun"". It was then I realized that two of the patrons were employees and were celebrating a birthday. In my opinion having management sit with such a group and participate in their behavior is not acceptable and shows no sense of professionalism. I will not be coming back, instead I will just take my family to my local dive bar where people have respect for others around them."
Joe C.,"Santa Maria, CA",651,101,566,4.0,6/4/2016,We have come here about five times. Service has been great. They have a good selection of craft beers. The pizza is good but not the best. There is plenty of tv screens to catch a sport game and enjoy some food and drinks.
Chris H.,"Mansfield, TX",95,101,9,5.0,3/17/2016,"First off.... GET THE NEW SIRACHA BACON MAC N CHEESE!!!  Oh....my God!!!! It's amazing and heaven in your mouth.  Now that that's out of the way. BJs is always a safe place to eat! You'll never have to worry about the quality of the food, the service is always good and its always clean. We love BJs and don't plan on  ending our regularity any time soon. Always a local favorite and great dinner choice. Great for the big game, or if it's the middle of the day and you need a lunch time brewski! Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the house IPA"
J F.,"Camarillo, CA",0,5,75,5.0,11/5/2016,"Everything is great at BJ!  Deep dish Pizza, Burgers,  Ribs, Chicken and the chopped Wedge salad is the best!  Great in house brewed sofas (orange cream, black cherry and root beer.  Really professional waitstaff."
Miguel V.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",0,8,,1.0,5/30/2017,"Horrible service at the front desk. Restaurant was empty, and they gave us a 35 minute wait time for 10 people. Yet, they let a party of 9 walk right in within 5 minutes. Talked to the girl and told us she can't do anything about it. So we left, with our party of 10 which lost them about $200.00 or more in sales. Way to go Bj' s."
Jiji B.,"Ojai, CA",0,11,,4.0,4/19/2017,"I went here the night before easter in the WORST mood. I had my b**** face on and was very tired. My attitude turned around because of our server Kevin S. he was there close to eleven and was very knowledgeable about the drinks and had good suggestions about how to tone down the sweetness in the Alabama whatever. Great customer service, very positive and attentive."
Anita C.,"Ventura, CA",1,30,5,3.0,10/18/2016,The food is pretty good and i like the curbside to go. The service is always great but the problem is theres always something wrong with the order they have gotten better recently but if you get takeout check your food thoroughly to make sure everything is there and how you ordered it.
