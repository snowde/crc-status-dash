Lola H.,"Ojai, CA",0,40,6,2.0,8/11/2016,"A couple of friends & I had lunch here. Service was extremely slow, including to get our bill & then to process the payment. My friend had lentil soup & the lentils were not fully cooked. Another had a baked potato that had uncooked areas in it. My turkey burger was just ok. The patty had no seasoning. My iced tea had no ice in it. Had to ask for more ice twice. They need to up their game!"
Katrina P.,"Ventura County, CA",174,92,172,3.0,12/30/2015,I've been coming here for years and I'm still in love with the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Pizzookie with Ice Cream. They have some good appetizers and pizza but I mostly come here for that dessert. Expect this place to be packed every time you walk in. Noise level is pretty high since there's a handful of children dining with their families.
Aly T.,"Ventura, CA",1,23,4,2.0,5/1/2017,"On Friday April 28, My husband and i placed a curbside order at 9:45 to be picked up at 10Pm. We get there at 10:02 i called and spoke to a gentleman named brandon. He asked what kind of car i was in i told him make and model AND color and he said everything would be rite out. Its now 10:20 my Husband goes inside to the host area where the host says we are in the rite area of parking. Okay its a Friday night i get its busy. So its now 10:30 and still nothing. I go inside to take out and Sarah let me know curbside CLOSES AT 9. Okay if that was the case why did brandon not let us know? Or maybe the host? I showed her my call log and she told me brandon was just getting off his shift and didn't let anyone know we had called to pick up our oder. It was a huge inconvenience waiting for 30+ minutes with my hungry toddler in the back seat crying that shes hungry. The Host could have told us curbside was closed along with brandon who didn't. Sarah charged me the full thing not even a discount for us waiting. Im giving you an extra star because the food was good. But with service like this, i dont see myself returning."
Jonathan M.,"Moorpark, CA",5,7,,1.0,4/24/2017,"The family and I stopped in on our way home from Golf in Stuff.  The line wasn't too bad but I went to use the restroom and the bathroom was disgusting.  Urine all over the floor, both trash receptacles were overflowing to the floor with trash.  I mentioned it to one of the guys upfront and asked that he talk to the manager.  We were seated and our waitress, (young blond woman), didn't seem to be very happy to be there at all.  Was very uncomfortable, She took our order for the kids and came back for us.  Our oldest ordered Mac and cheese and it came out frozen.  There were pieces stuck together as if they forgot to microwave it.  They took her plate and ""made"" some more but our overall experience was pretty crappy.  They have a nice place there, if they would just keep it clean, hire better servers and have someone checking the food before it's sent out.  I don't know how you mess up Mac and cheese but apparently it's possible.  Doubt we'll be going back, at least to that location.  We had a slightly better experience at a work lunch in Westlake."
Sharon G.,"Ventura, CA",19,10,4,3.0,4/23/2016,The food is super tasty and the service is ALWAYS slow and bad. Pizookie is one of the tastiest creations ever but order it before you are done eating if you don't want to sit around for another 20 minutes before it ever comes. We asked for ranch when the food came and we were done by the time they ever remembered it.
S C.,"Oxnard, CA",58,5,,2.0,11/27/2016,"I used to come here with friends and family a lot, but it seems like over time it has gone downhill. The service is super slow. The employees don't seem to care about their customers whatsoever. I also dislike how anytime they mess up our order OR completely forget it, they just ""make it up"" by giving us a free pizookie... Doesn't seem all that great when it's happened 3 times now!!"
Anthony P.,"Ventura, CA",3,3,22,5.0,10/2/2016,"Service ANYONE ??? When I think of service,I think of someone making me feel good about spending my hard earned money in their establishment. RON MOUSHEY is the perfect example of an excellent waiter. Not only did he recognize me from a previous visit, he went out of his way to educate me as well as bring me samples of Bj's holiday beers. Did I mention He was not even my server for the night? Thank you Ron for making me feel comfortable in your establishment. If you are looking for good service make sure you ask to be seated in Rons area."
Deena B.,"Camarillo, CA",12,50,48,5.0,6/19/2016,"Came on a Sunday late morning , sat at the bar, service was excellent! Pizza was quick & perfectly thick but also crunchy. Two thumbs up for friendliness, cleanliness  & tastiness!"
Terry J.,"Reston, VA",25,126,191,1.0,10/25/2014,"Just got a note from the manager at BJ's trying to justify their lousy service.  Bad move. Bad service = bad service.  I don't care how inconvenient it is for you.   If I pay the check, then I get to demand service. Yard House has no problem with seperate checks and will continue to get my business.  In fact, I will be back in CA next week and look forward to NOT stopping at BJs."
Jay R.,"Oxnard, CA",1,33,,4.0,10/13/2016,"I dig this place ! Prices are good and fare ! And the food is top notch , it does get busy , and the staff is always nice ! I will never say no to going here ! The beers are better then most in house breweries !"
Alexis G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,10,9,1.0,11/6/2015,"Been coming here for years and I recently had bad experience, the food is still good but the service is horrible. I like there avocado rolls for those that know me I'm Lexo from Oxnard"
Glenn B.,"Oxnard, CA",1,32,,2.0,11/11/2015,"Came here for Veterans day meal and it was very disappointing to say the least.  It took several attempts to get silverware.  Clam chowder was salty and Chili was lukewarm Burned fries mixed in the calimari Fish and chips were greasy and the fries were limp. Not a great dining experience. We have been here several times before and it was always great, hopefully today was a fluke."
E P.,"San Diego, CA",3,21,7,1.0,7/8/2016,"Terrible place for groups, the waiters ignore you & just dump you with a huge bill and refuse to split it for the group. Waited over an hour just for the check."
Candace W.,"Sandy, UT",19,27,10,3.0,7/10/2016,Average service and food. Reminds me of TGI Fridays. I had a chicken dish and the chicken was dry and overall dish was bland. Our waiter took about 10 minutes greet us and take our drink order.
Lesley H.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/6/2017,Currently sitting in Bj's at this moment and my experience is that bad that I took the time from my meal to write this review. Customer service is awful!  I'm a frequent Bj's customer and this is beyond ridiculous. I had to send my order back to the kitchen because they didn't give me the sides I asked for and then I asked 3 different times for a side of sauce! This is probably going to be my last trip to this Bj's for a while.
Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1433,849,4285,4.0,9/22/2013,"Updated Review on 1/11/2016 Decided to add updates to my previous review because the food here has definitely stepped it's game up, I had to share with ya'll. So my new favorite addition is on the appetizer menu: Dry Rub Chicken Wings in Lemon Pepper; man these babies are deeelicious! Talk about the right way to cook a chicken wing, it's all about the crunch secondary to the flavor and these wings have it all! 10 wings for $10.50 may be a bit pricey, but if you come in during HH, it's $2 off! Plus the mini pizzas are pretty much half off-you chose from the many flavors from their regular sized pizza-great selection on flavors!  I highly recommend coming in during Happy Hour, & sit at the bar otherwise service at the regular dinning tables will be slow to non-existent.  Enjoy!  Reviewed on 9/22/2013 Always a good time at Bj's! Love sitting at the bar area, because you get to watch sports on their HUGE Tv screens and the servers are very personable. Great food and decent prices. The drinks are unique and come very alcohol filled. You mosdef get the bang for your buck here."
Mayalia B.,"Sacramento, CA",235,191,435,5.0,10/28/2015,The rootbeer chicken wings gave me life!!!!!! They were sooo dayum good whom ever thought of that concoction was right on the money there. No complaints about this place it's just straight toward good eats. I was sold on the wings and will be back for more. There customer service was great as well!
Emily L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/22/2016,I recommend trying BJs root beer and pizza ! I do not drink soda but I would go for the root beer alone!
Christie B.,"Ojai, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/28/2016,"Poor management. I have never come in contact with a more condescending and unprofessional ""manager"" than Lisa. Her attitude in general is so negative, and her facial expressions are consistently reflective of someone who smells something horrible. She mistreats employees (mostly the female employees) and goes out of her way to misuse her position of authority to bully others and make them feel bad. It's sad that someone who abuses others the way she does can keep a job where they are responsible for being a leader."
Tom B.,"Oak View, CA",4,26,6,2.0,6/21/2016,Had a party of 16.  It was a busy night other large groups. Wait was 40 min not bad with the groups there.  But once in it was 3 hours from sit down to leaving. Drink orders took long to take and equally as long to get.  Meal order very long to place and very long untill it got to the table. Then the checks..  Let's just say the food was good the service was super slow...
