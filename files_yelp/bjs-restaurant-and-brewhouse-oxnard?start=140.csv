Jasmine T.,"Azusa, CA",127,13,3,3.0,9/8/2016,I love the food. But Dominique. Man. He doesn't know how to do math. I gave $7 cash the rest on the card. He didn't verify if the rest should have been on the card. I had them fix the adjustment. They did $6 cash the rest on the card. I didn't know 3rd grade math took 10 minutes to accomplish. But okay.
Kath M.,"Ventura, CA",0,19,,2.0,12/21/2016,"We frequent this location quite a bit and last night we showed up late, sat at the bar & the bar was filthy, bartender did not wipe counter nor did she lay the napkins out nicely like they normally do. Food was good to OK but cleanliness was zero stars"
Alicia K.,"Long Beach, CA",1,27,9,3.0,6/16/2016,Ended up going in person to speak to Lisa with my boyfriend since it was on his card and the outcome was better. She was sincerely apologetic. Our goal when we came in today was to address the fact that it was not okay for her employees to do this. That we want to feel safe to hand our credit card. She said that the server was suppose to let us know about the incident and that she will inform/coach her employees about this incident. I'm just glad that we were able to express our concern.
Dan R.,"Oxnard, CA",771,44,20,5.0,9/28/2015,"I have four words: Bison Burger Was Fabulous. Cooked to perfection accompanied by a slaw that I cannot describe but good enough that I wanted more .... and I NEVER want more slaw. Or never have in the past. Service was superb. Beer inventory is beyond comprehension but also off-limits when I've got afternoon work. It's my new favorite lunch. And, BTW, I think it's more like $ than $$."
Michelle M.,"Ventura, CA",30,51,182,5.0,5/3/2016,"We have been going to BJ'S a while now and go 2-3 times a month. We stopped going when we had an absolutely horrible experience with one of the servers, Laura. We decided to give it another chance but because the service from Laura was so bad we refuse to sit in her section.  When we went to dinner tonight I asked the hostess, Glenda who was working a particular section. I was very surprised to find out that Glenda had remembered us from our last trip and that I didn't want to be in Laura's section. She quickly informed my kids and I that Devin was working that section and assured us that he was really good. I have to say we were ALL extremely impressed with his service and professionalism. Unfortunately, there was an issue with out order and the food took a long time. What was very impressive is that Devin took full responsibility for one of our meals being left out. He very kindly offered a soup while the missing plate was made. Although the food took longer than expected Devin and Glenda were FANTASTIC and we're the reason for you 5 stars. Oh yes, and when we forgot our To Go meal inside Devin ran outside, found our car and gave us our meal.  Wow! The food Devin recommend was quite good as well:). The service however was very impressive."
Lindsey D.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/20/2017,Very unprofessional! Place smells like bleach ! My nose is burning. Server said they had to bleach everything for some virus going around. Couldn't even finish my food!
R B.,"Oxnard, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/5/2017,Bad service food was cold manager did not apologize never ever go there again olny thing good was the beer .
Clinton D.,"Oxnard, CA",43,115,429,4.0,12/12/2015,"Went in again for another party this time it was a party for about 30.we had a few servers,this time around we got better service,the food was good and those servers were hard at work...back and fourth keeping up with so many requests,orders were a little unorganized but for a large party that's some what understandable.i had a pasta with sausage and sauce,it was a little on the small side but good.i also ordered the salted carmel mini size pizookie with was perfect size after a few appetizers,meal and evert hung else."
Patricia A.,"Ventura, CA",0,9,1,3.0,3/13/2017,"Went to BJs in Oxnard yesterday. We love that place. however yesterday service was slow and it wasn't even busy. Someone from our party had to get up and ask for menus. It wasn't until after we got up and got our own menus the server came by. We got our food and still didn't have silverware. Food was great, environment great. also when you use a visa gift card restaurants will take 20%.. don't use the visa gift cards at restaurants."
Arianna M.,"Oxnard, CA",127,56,51,2.0,7/16/2015,"disappointing, from start to finish. I rarely dine here.. the few times i do, its to attend birthday dinners. I like reading yelp reviews before i dine in at any restaurant only because i like to see whats the best entree to get.  walking in, not greeted, and the host was not friendly at all, i was asking her about reservations... she SIGHED & looked at the comp... honestly, that irked me... like what? why are you working upfront w/ customers w/ that attitude? go wash dishes in the back.. & SIGH all you want there...  anyways, we got seated by a diff host, he was friendly..  our server.... i understand, youre busy w/ other tables.. but he forgot a lot of things we needed.. we also asked, before our meal was even out, thinking it would be easier on him, so he didnt have to be going back & forth to our table.. guess not. nor was he even sincere about anything, no apologies, just set what we needed on our table and walked away..  than our server needed to go on break & we had another server... he was A LOT better, i think his name was jose or joe.. i wish i got his actual name, because he deserves to be praised!  he was genuine & sweet.  we let him know, we had a birthday & he said "" birthdays mean everything to us here at bjs"" thats a really sweet thing to say. he came back with a pazookie w/ a lit candle.  food was mediocre, the strawberry splash was amazing!  also, our original server was standing at the host stand & gave us no acknowledgment  as we were leaving...  we tip according to the service, so im hoping our 2nd server got that tip.. all in all, they need to work better in customer service at the host station. 2 stars, for the strawberry splash & our 2nd server... if it wasnt for those 2 things.. i would give this place no stars..."
NavajoTradingPost N.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,76,1,3.0,3/11/2016,"First time eating here. The wait time on Sunday eve was over 30 min, standing room only. Ordered the sourdough clam chowder bowl.  Actually the chowder was pretty good, except you just don't get that much. Even though your served a huge sough dough bread bowl, they only hollow out enough for approx 11 good spoon full bites. Yes I counted.  One great thing, they have UN-limited refills on their ""blackberry soda."" Ribeye steak was cooked to perfection. Vegges were fresh. Wanted the chocolate cookie cup dessert, they were out. Meh... The End. Next..."
Lloyd D.,"Ventura, CA",10,7,4,3.0,7/18/2015,Food was good Service sucked Beer was cold Service sucked Did I mention  The service sucked
Squidgy Q.,"Ventura, CA",0,26,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Slow service, so-so food.  I called ahead (three hours) to get my name put on the wait list, and our party of six still waited about half an hour while I watched similar sized parties get seated.  The food wasn't bad, nothing to really complain about there.  Took forever to get our check & the change too.  They suck at running a restaurant."
Kg H.,"Oxnard, CA",3,120,93,3.0,10/29/2015,"I've eaten here 3 times in the last several years. I've tried the pizza, the salad, the appetizers. The food just doesn't have much flavor.  It's a great place to watch sports, but that's pretty much it."
Colleen W.,"Newhall, Newhall, CA",6,40,1,2.0,5/27/2015,"This review is mainly about the service that I received on Monday My friend and I stopped here to eat an early dinner. It was 6pm on Memorial day. We were seated right away which was nice. As we looked over the menus we noticed that no one has come to our table to even greet us or take a drink order. It took about 10 minutes for someone to finally come over and talk to us.  He said that there was some confusion and he was sorry about the delay. Not sure how you get confused about people sitting in your section? but that's me... After we ordered our food, it didn't take that long for it to come to our table. The food was fantastic. Great flavor and it wasn't overly priced. Our waiter just took forever to do simple things. Getting us a to-go box, he forgot it twice. Asking for refills, took another 5 minutes at least.  I don't think we will be going back anytime soon."
Christina P.,"Carpinteria, CA",5,35,12,3.0,7/28/2015,"The stars I gave are solely for the dish. I've been here at least five times. I love my brewhouse burger!  Annoyingly, tonight was not the first night that I had to wait 10+ minutes for my check. Its monday at midnight, literally just got back from there. Know that there's not a busy crowd on a late Monday night alright. Anywho, yes, Its late and I'm ready to go home. The check is literally the last thing you have to do before you're done with the party you're serving. 10+ minutes to wait on your bill and a box is ridiculous. Especially when you see your waiter socializing at the bar instead of bringing you something so simple. I work with food myself ! Be reasonable"
Geoff M.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",79,344,946,3.0,4/23/2014,"So after a first terrible visit we went back for a lunch, using a card they gave us from the previous fiasco.  The meal was as I had hoped it would be, it was good.  We were seated right away and our waitress was on point and very good, nice and professional.  Our food came out quick, hot and tasty.  The bacon cheeseburger was pretty good and the fries were great.   Our experience this time was a world apart from the first time, which goes to show you everyone has a bad day every now and then.  I would go to BJ's again and am I glad we went back and had a good experience."
Tom H.,"Torrance, CA",51,399,8,4.0,6/17/2014,"Came here with a party of 10 over the weekend.  Called ahead and although they don't do call ahead seating for parties over 6, the manager approved our request.  We came on time and the table was ready to go.  Great job by the front desk staff. Service was also good, food was great.  Recommend becoming a BJs Reward Member and downloading their app.  Can get call ahead seating as well as order your food ahead of time and pay your bill, all from your phone."
Monique G.,"Camarillo, CA",49,67,11,3.0,3/23/2016,"This place is always a hit or miss for us, the food is always good but we always get shitty servers who either never pays attention, forgets our food, even brought me a cold burger and once brought our daughters meals and totally forgot about mine and my husband. It's usually been the same server who I hate getting cause he just doesn't seem to really care and we can end up waiting forever after we get our food for him to even do a refill or bring us a check and even ask us how everything is going! Next time we def will ask to NOT be seated in his section!!!"
Wildflower M.,"Washington, DC",0,15,4,4.0,5/12/2015,"**VEGETARIAN** I recently visited BJ's while on travel to Ontario, CA for business. Had never heard of it, but I always have good experiences with food at brew housesI ordered the Santa Fe Salad withOUT the chicken. Instead I asked for a veggie patty on the side. It was great! I diced it and placed it over the salad. Great option for vegetarians! I've ordered it a few times since.  Also, you can sub most items that contain meat with black beans.  The environment is bright, casual, in and out quickly and sports on flat screens so no  matter where you sit you can watch something while dining. I have not yet dined outside but will next time. Unfortunately, the view is nothing more than a highway type street. Wish there was more of a scene around this town, but so far...haven't found it. Will keep looking. Meanwhile..Thanks for a great dinner, BJ's!"
