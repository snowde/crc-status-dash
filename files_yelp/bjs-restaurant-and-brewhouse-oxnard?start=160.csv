Laura A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,11,2,1.0,6/29/2015,"We usually love BJ's. We have 1500 points with loyalty program. We went into this one and weren't acknowledged until we had to wave someone down. Never took drink order or welcomed.  Dumped one menu and kept going.(there were 2 of us)  The restaurant was absolutely freezing and the bathrooms were completely trashed. It was during a very slow part of day! Time for some retraining folks. Consistency is key to this brand. We go to the Brea BJ's, 3 times a week. We left this one, with our money...headed somewhere else."
Jackie M.,"Oxnard, CA",11,48,3,4.0,11/18/2016,"Waited about a year to come back. This time i was pretty impressed! Kept my order simple by choosing from the lunch menu. I did the half California chicken club with thin fries, and a side of the chicken tortilla soup. Sandwich was great, fries were yummy too. But the star of the meal was definitely that chicken tortilla soup! So flavorful and delicious! I had wished i ordered just that but in a larger size. Ill be coming back for the soup!"
Suzuki R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,22,26,5.0,8/20/2015,"So our soccer team was invited to have pizza and Pizookies.  After a long day in the sun our girls were super exhausted but nothing compared to us parents who did the driving all the way out to Ventura.  Not a bad location considering the weather was triple digits back home.  So IMPRESSED with the staff and the manager who came out to greet our party.  The place was jamin with lots of hungry folks.  Our server was TinaMarie and two others assisting.  The Dallas Cowby's were in town and many of their fans were also enjoying a great evening at BJ's.  We were seated outside in their covered patio area next to a large Cowboy's party.  They definitely added to the nights excitement.   As usual the food was spot on.  The girls pizza was brought out minutes after being seated (IMPRESSIVE).  The adults shared 2 Best Beginnings appetizers.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza.  I'm more of a traditional pizza lover.  All in all, the service was exceptional!!!!!!!! Thanks so much!  Til next year..."
Michelle B.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",151,28,1,1.0,8/19/2016,"I don't usually give reviews like this but the service and food were way under my expectations. I've been to many BJs and this is my first bad experience. I ordered pizza to go with only 2 toppings on it. When I got to my hotel room, there were at least 3 pieces that didn't have any toppings on them. They have a special ""to go"" section that you order from, so the people that are helping us there should know that it's to go...no napkins, no utensils. Come on Shasta D, if someone tips you for a to go order, you should make sure they have everything they need before bringing the bag to them. The young man at the front counter helped me with that so thank you. The pizza was soggy and flavorless. I have had some great food and beer before so I was expecting something good! I feel that the staff should be better trained on making customers feel special and give them class A service! I probably won't come back to the Oxnard BJs for a while but I will visit others. Other than that, the atmosphere is a loud sports bar. It's great and the beer is great too!"
Ruben C.,"Oxnard, CA",0,13,,2.0,3/27/2016,Horrible service. Food is good but when you been waiting for over an hour after your order was taken that's really bad service.
Julie D.,"Oxnard, CA",145,318,1209,2.0,2/12/2014,"This isn't so much a review about the food and/or service, but merely an observation. I came in for dinner two nights ago with my niece and sister and although we had an ok dining experience, I just wanted to point out one thing we noticed. We were there for a little over an hour, seated in the back area close to the bathroom entrance and we noticed one of the hostesses repeatedly circulating around that area on her cell phone. I understand that sometimes we all have a tendency to check our phones while at work, but this girl was legitimately texting for minutes at a time. She would stand in one corner  and just kind of walk in place oblivious to her surrounding.  I didn't get a chance to look at her name tag, but she had long brown hair (in a ponytail), was wearing all black and was probably around 5'2"""
Denise G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/19/2016,"BJs is one of my all time favorite restaurants to order from. 99.9% of the time, my husband and I order take out. No complaints there. Our order is always accurate, on time as promised through their app and delicious!  Since today is Father's Day, my husband and I decided to go dine in and actually have lunch . There was a gentleman up front that told us there was a 20 min wait. No problem. We'll wait. But what bothered me is when I stared seeing other walk ins (not reservations because I was near the desk to hear) that were also party's of 2 being seated before us. 2 other party's to be exact! They had plenty of seating so not sure what was this issue there.  When we were finally seated, we asked if we can have a booth since we had our 7 month old with us. The gentleman said no because they ""didn't have enough servers"" so we settled into one of their smaller 2 person booths. Keep in mind we had our son, which we had asked for a high chair before even being seated and was not given, his diaper bag, toys and snacks to keep him entertained. We could NOT fit in this small space. 10 min later when our waiter finally did arrive we asked to be moved to a booth where we had previously seen was an area she was handling. With an attitude she exhales deeply like it was a bother to her and says ""I can do it this time because there's not that many people."" Ok..   We finally get seated, she gives us our menus and says she will be back. We already knew what we wanted, we get the same meals whether it's take out or the rare times we dine in.. We told her as soon as we sat that we were ready to order. She let us know she would be back. I kid you not 15 min passed and she did not return. I became irritated and told my husband it was time to leave. The gentleman that had previously seated us, looked at us and gave us what I believe was a rude look. Didn't ask if there was a problem or anything.  Can't say they were busy either. We were there at 10:30am Guess we will stick to take out."
Nathan Z.,"Ontario, CA",0,10,18,3.0,2/10/2015,I hate to love the food here.  The service is always crap at every BJ's.  It's like they think that because the food is great they can get away with it.  11 minutes to get a water?  Crazy.  Room temp Perrier?  What? Such annoying; arrogant servers.  I'm going to eat at whole foods again tomorrow.
Cece M.,"Oxnard, CA",97,18,21,5.0,2/28/2015,"Ok, let's start saying that not only each one of the dishes that I had has been right on in flavor and presentation, but Mathew the Manager is also running a very efficient operation. I was so happy here that I went 3 days straight, and the service and food was consistent each time. I love the unlimited salad deal, with the tomato soup. It is very difficult to find a good tomato soup, and this one is hearthy, yet creamy and flavors are right when they should be. My husband had a fried southern chicken with mashed potatoes that I tried a bite, highly recomended. I felt we travelled to Luisiana with those flavors... But let's talk about the Manager again. If I were to run a multimillion dollar corporation, I will blindly hire him. What an effective, hands on Manager! Yet when my husband complimented him, he was so humble to acknowledge it is him but rather the BJ's organization that he works for! He keeps his Team highly motivated and it did not matter at what time you went to the restaurant, he was always in the floor helping, observing and leading by example!!! Mathew, Kudos to you! And yes, I have been a QA Manager for Food Processing for the last 23 years, so I can see a well run Operation here! Congratulations BJ's is packed at happy hour also btw, has gotten popular."
Melanie R.,"Norwalk, CA",0,3,1,1.0,10/22/2016,"Walked in and were seated right away. Sat at the table for half an hour. No one ever came to our table. There was no acknowledgment. It was not too busy. I've been in BJ's when it's busy and it wasn't at that point.  The table was sticky. We decided to get up and just order takeout for my son. I told the cashier that we wanted an order to go since no one ever came to our table and with an attitude told me that the computer was down. I understand that the system was down, but it was the way she said it. Then she looked surprised when I asked my son if he'd like to just go to In-N-Out instead. This is the worst service I've received. We won't be back."
Tiffany A.,"Port Hueneme, CA",45,60,25,1.0,12/14/2015,"Came in here Friday with my mother in law, what a mistake that was!! Elizabeth was our waitress and was HORRIBLE!! Never again will I come here! You should train your team to be respectful and have some happy faces! She didn't even refill my tea ONCE till she saw me drink out of my moms! Good was mediocre at best, how the hell do you mess up a simple salad? Only thing you have going for you here is the drinks but even that won't bring me back :("
sarah s.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,129,45,1.0,10/1/2016,"I watched the uneducated fool at the front desk turn away a disabled person with a service dog. When the disabled person asked to sit on the patio, the server said ""sorry, no one is serving out there."" When the disabled person said ""where can I sit with my service dog?"" the server said ""oh, there's no pets in here."" To which the disabled person had to then reiterate ""THIS IS A SERVICE DOG."" The server still refused service. Such fools. I left the restaurant too in solidarity after seeing this play out. EDUCATE YOUR EMPLOYEES ON BASIC CA LAW, BJ's."
Karen G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,23,,3.0,11/17/2016,Since the opening of the Collection BJ's service and quality has gone down. Last time I was in there my food was prepared wrong and it took a long time to arrive
Amber C.,"Ventura, CA",72,19,2,2.0,12/30/2015,What happened to this place. Drinks sucked. Food sucked and took forever to come out. Nobody offered us silverware until we were almost done.
Brittany D.,"Oxnard, CA",7,12,,5.0,5/6/2016,They have good food yummy drinks and they are nice (: I love the pizza very much and I would like to go there again some day soon (:
Mrs. W.,"Santa Paula, CA",1,21,2,1.0,10/17/2014,Wow!!! Go to Woodranch!!! Our meal was HORRIFIC! A party of 9 and almost every order was wrong and one meal didn't come out until we were almost done. When we tried to tell the waitress that one out of the many messed up orders was a childs meal she argued with us. The manager lisa comes out and says virtually nothing....just nods...I ask her if this is how service is here and she states it shouldn't be. THAT'S IT!!! THREE STARS NO WAY!!!! Go somewhere else....for better service and management!!! YIKES!!!! HAD TO BEG FOR OUR BILL AND WHILE WE WERE WAITING WATCHED A PARTY OF FOUR WALK OUT BCZ THEY WERE IGNORED!!!!
Ashley L.,"Santa Paula, CA",0,30,24,2.0,9/13/2016,"When we walked in there wasn't anyone around to seat us so we stood around for like 5 mins waiting for someone. We finally got seated and I ordered the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer and the seared ahi salad. My 5 year old ordered a cheese pizza off the kids menu. My son loved the pizza but I wish I could say the same about my order. The egg rolls were good except the 2 that were so burnt they were inedible. The ahi salad was okay but really overdressed I couldn't eat half of it because it was just dripping in dressing. The appetizer and food was delivered together and took up our whole small table. The server was nice however once we got our food we didn't see him again throughout our meal although it wasn't his fault considering he had about half the restaurant to serve although not full it was quite a few tables. We waited for our check for about 10 mins, overall we won't be returning."
Kevin A.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",10,99,,2.0,5/17/2015,"We came here for lunch on a Saturday after attending the Strawberry Festival nearby. We waited for a table for about 15 mins. Once seated, we did not have any silverware on our table. Our server was friendly and did a good job of serving our lunch of the Santa Fe salad (lots of not so green lettuce) and the BBQ chicken salad, which had a very small splash of BBQ sauce that was to mean it was a BBQ salad. The salad was very bland due to the lettuce being almost all pale green and no GREEN lettuce in the salad. The chicken was moist and not dried out which was the saving grace. My Arnold Palmer was good. Lots of big screen TV's for watching sports. Free parking in lot shared with Home Depot. Prob not coming back to this BJ's. The BJ's in Valencia rocks!! Great food and drinks!!"
Tyler R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",116,39,5,1.0,10/11/2014,"Disappointing. Came in between lunch and dinner. Restaurant was mellow. Sat and waited for greeting. Food came out luke warm, never saw our server, had to track down someone else for service. Is it worth talking to a manager or just never return?  With so much competition in the area (The Collection), you'd think they'd be on their game. Definitely dropping the ball."
Keycee D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",444,524,2877,2.0,5/14/2011,"BJ's...wow, sure hasn't changed one bit [at least the one in Oxnard]. This place was like thee place to have dinner/lunch with friends back when we were in H.S./early college years and I got tired of going.  Years later, I recently went back [Last night] for a get together with some old friends and service sucked!  Okay, so we had reservations at 10 P.M. and got seated fast, the waitress took our drink order and freaking took forever to give us our drinks, even just water.  Everyone at the table was getting impatient, because it was late and we were hungry and we haven't ordered our food.  When we did order our food, it took even longer for us to get our damn orders...someone in our table got their order 10 minutes after we all got ours.  The service last night was just so HORRIBLE, they weren't even busy like how the place usually would be - empty tables everywhere! *Food:  Last night my bf and I shared the Thai Salmon: Wow, I LOVE salmon, but damn, they did not cook it right, it was too dry = OVERCOOKED the Thai salmon consists of Spicy Thai sauce, white rice, snow peas, carrots, red bell peppers and onions topped with fresh mango salsa, everything about it just didn't taste as great as I thought it would have... = DISAPPOINTED Pizza: I remember trying their pizza once and I hated it, it's too doughy for my kind of pizza. Sandwiches: I've tried a few of their sandwiches and they weren't bad at all, maybe I'll stick to sandwiches that's if when I do go back... Calamari: YUMMY! I love CALAMARI, and there's were good , the down fall was I paid $9.25 and the portion was mother freakingly SMALL! I'd rather go get calamari at Kabuki, at least their portion is decent for the price whether it's happy hour or not. Alcoholic Beverages:  Their prices in drinks are not bad at all.  A shot of Patron was $8-9; it's usually $10-12 in other places.  My best friend and I also got the White Gummy Bear shot and it was only $6.50 and the bartender gave us more than a shot, it was like 2 shots put into a big shot glass = Awesome!   Why 2 Stars? well, prices in alcohol is one star, taste of calamari [some places aren't great] is another star, service is minus one star, but pazooki adds back up the 2nd star.... Overall Experience: If you love BEER, this is the place for you. If customer service is important to you, don't go here; you're going to end up walking out being P/O'ed."
