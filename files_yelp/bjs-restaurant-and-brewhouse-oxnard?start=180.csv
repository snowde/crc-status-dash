Michelle R.,"Oxnard, CA",326,123,151,2.0,10/15/2015,"Yeah food is still gross. I had not been here in 5 years. Husband wanted to go, I ordered the mahi mahi bowl and my fish was over cooked and very dry. The pineapple fried rice was super bland. I took one bite and I was done. The service was okay. My husband's chicken gyros were decent. I probably won't come back."
Simone H.,"Reno, NV",443,173,687,3.0,9/28/2014,"There is nothing remarkable about this location. Service was average--borderline slow, food was good (but not AMAZING), and there's a large variety of drinks.  I appreciate that there's happy hour during any big football game.  I have no reason to not return, but hopefully service will be a little faster next time."
Jann P.,"Oxnard, CA",15,55,19,1.0,8/16/2015,"Went today at 3:00om for a late lunch.   Place wasn't overly crowded. I told the hostess there was 2 of us, but my hubby would be there in a moment The hostess & maybe a waiter were talking about where to sit us. There  were several tables empty but needed to be bussed... Seems no one wanted to do it. When my hubby showed up about a minute later, we were told to sit anywhere in the bar area.   We sit down at a table & approx 3 min later a waitress came up & said that that they don't have enough wait staff & we'll have to go back to the hostess....  I told the waitress, no problem, we'll just go to Lazy Dog.     Then she decided that she could wait on us.... Told the hostess as we were leaving that since they couldn't serve us, we were going to Lazy a dog & she said ""good"" We won't be back .   I deserve to be treated better than that...  Don't do rudeness... Food has always been excellent there... Kudos to the kitchen, but the manager really needs to do something about his front staff..."
Jovana J.,"Oxnard, CA",2,4,1,1.0,9/1/2014,"This bjs may be the worst bjs of all bjs! Every single time I come here the customer service is horrible, the greeters are never there to even greet us !  Starting from the manger and a few other workers they all need better training and need to step up on their customer service!!!!"
Mary M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,29,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Maybe it was because it was a Friday night but our experience went from bad to horrible. Our half hour wait for a table became a hour because even though we put our name in and received a pager the guy behind the desk did not put us into the computer......then the table they rushed to give us was right by the kitchen so every time food came out to be delivered I had to move my chair or face being hit by a server. Then it took the waitress 10 minutes to take our order because she had two huge parties she was dealing with. By now we were starving and ordered appetizers and main course at the same time and of course the food came BEFORE the appetizers. Don't need appetizers AFTER the food .......My daughter is a vegetarian and ordered a salad and a grilled cheese. Comes with HAM in the grilled cheese REALLY !!!! Did not ask for ham, no ham mentioned on the menu.....Apology  Apology they make her another, but leave her the fries. The new grilled cheese it is such a unmelted goopy mess that she cant eat it. Our server is missing thru all this and never comes back to refill our drinks or see if we need anything, but manages to find our table to give us the bill. We asked for to go boxes and after waiting another 5 minutes finally just walk out without taking home our leftovers.Complained to the desk but never saw any management. Won't be back."
Bradley G.,"Ventura, CA",58,5,,1.0,3/29/2017,one of the worst customer service i've ever had. me and my girlfriend come here atleast few times and those few times we had the worst experience just like tonight coz there's this free pizookie day and as soon a we come in we decided to just be at the bar area and we sat there for a good 20 mins getting passed by server after server no acknowledgement whatsoever so we decided to just bounce and not come back ever again!!!
J K.,"Ventura, CA",0,78,14,1.0,7/2/2016,"I just left. They tried to sit my 6'4"" disabled son in a tiny singles booth. When I asked for a bigger booth I got an attitude from the server. The waitress was horrible. I asked for sugar for my iced tea, I had to get up and get it myself. My salad was horrible. The bacon was so greasy. The dress tastes terrible. I left 90% of it uneaten,  the waitress never asked if it was ok. The Waitress never checked on us. She was very rushed and it wasn't that busy. I've had terrible food and serve in the past, I thought I'd give it another shot. I will never be going back. It was a waste of money. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
Jaycie S.,"Port Hueneme, CA",277,331,206,4.0,12/12/2013,"The wait was pretty long the last time I was here, but it's to be expected on a Saturday night... We sat at a larger table for just four, but it always is a pleasant experience regardless of when we go."
Jeremy M.,"Ventura, CA",2,42,1,4.0,2/14/2016,Your typical California chain. The service is ok and the prices are competitive. We go here when we head to other stores in the area like Home Depot. I wouldn't make it a destination restaurant but if you are in the area check it out.
Aimee P.,"Oxnard, CA",119,15,3,5.0,11/11/2015,"Been here countless times. Service is always ON POINT. Never had any mistakes on food or bills. Servers are always friendly and professional. Food and drinks are ALWAYS delicious. High quality ingredients. Fresh. This place flows so well because they are WELL STAFFED. They have food runners who only run food unlike most restaurants who are too cheap to pay for extra labor. They have eople who come in late to do cleaning. Bussers who buss. Honestly these extra workers may not seem like they make much of a difference but I've worked in the food industry and I know that every little bit helps. When you have so many people working together it takes a lot of stress off servers and bartenders, making it easier for them to deliver great customer service. The pizza and best beginnings sampler appetizer and smore pizookie are my favorites. Although I'm sure everything on the menu is great."
Duane K.,"Ventura, CA",0,7,,4.0,8/30/2016,"Great place - been here several times n I keep coming back. There's nothing I've ordered that I didn't like n beers r outstanding. Service is usually pretty good unless they're super busy. Try it, I think u'll like it."
Krissy K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",189,76,9,4.0,8/17/2015,I've never had a bad experience here and the beer menu is extensive. Sometimes the waiters seem rushed and ask you a question as they're walking away.
Refugio R.,"Simi Valley, CA",133,5,,1.0,2/20/2017,"My fiancé and I went to this restaurant for my bday and it took 25 min just for a waiter to greet us. 15 min later we finally get our drink and she run off and we had to other 10 min just to order our food which we already knew what we are going to order. On a side note this waitress was really impatient she would talk to us and the ask us a question then dart off to somewhere without us finish our conversations. Hour and 15 min passed we get our food, we got the beginning plater, and soup and salad combo, and last thing we got have a sandwich. We forgot to asked for condiment so we ask other waitress and she gave us an attitude which was very rude and unprofessional. My fiancé sandwich was good but one of the condiment was really cold. My calm chowder soup was not good it tasted like it was straight from the can and just microwave it and just placed it in the bread bowl.  And my fiancé and I had to wait for the check for good 30-40 min. We got at that the restaurant 4:30pm and still here which is almost 7pm."
Tyler A.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",7,1,,1.0,8/22/2016,"Jus went to the BJs Green Flash brew dinner. Have to say not impressed at all. We called ahead and asked about the dd ticket. They said if your dd doesn't eat any of the food or drink you would not have to paid for the ticket. So we made reservations for 4 drink tickets. When we got the bill we were charged for 4 drink tickets plus a dd ticket even tho the dd didn't eat anything. They charged us full price for everything, even tho we paid in advanced. They didn't even ask us if we paid in advance. The production of this dinner was very poor. Very disappointed in everything. If they knew the system didn't differentiate between a reservation for that day or a reservation before that date they should ask about it. The pours where okay depending on who you got as the server. And the pizza was a slice of pizza for the main course. It is not a really 4 course meal. It is more of a sample of a 4 course meal. The whole experience left more to be desired a lot more to be desired. I would defiantly not go back to a BJs pair dinner!"
Anna G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",11,25,2,2.0,9/12/2014,"Ordered the Brewhouse Double Deluxe Burger and it was pretty good. But they brought the wrong french fires (shoestring) to the table then insisted that they'd bring me the steak fries. Wish I had declined. The steak fries are dipped in a seasoned battered and were terrible. They really need to try perfecting some crisp thick fries and maybe offer a few flavored sea salts to give them an extra something.  The calamari was good as was the aioli sauce. I'd probably go back, if there wasn't another option, but wouldn't get the french fries."
Kit S.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/27/2016,"I returned here since I  had a great lunch a few days ago.  I ordered a ""rib eye"" steak that was over $22.00. First  I had to ask for a hot potato as mine was half cooked and cold. Not a good start. I had asked for the steak medium rare and it at best was medium. It was very dry and definitely NOT a rib eye. At best it was a top sirloin and very tasteless.  Had it not been that our waitress was as charming as always  I would have complained very loudly. I was taking some very important people out and was so disappointed that I may never go back despite the fact that I had had several good experiences before. I feel if you are paying that much you should have no complaints and there should be no question that the food is properly represented. If I ever want a steak it will always be Wood Ranch."
Ruby L.,"Oxnard, CA",7,10,2,1.0,7/22/2015,"I'm not coming here again. Sorry but not sorry.  A year ago I went with my friend to eat for dinner and didn't see our server the whole time. We saw her attending to big parties but not us and we had to ask her and other people to refill our drinks and even to bring us desserts. I understand that you can be busy but not even pay attention to a table that has a potential to tip you well? I almost didn't want to tip but I'm not that cruel.  So I decided to try this place again with my boyfriend for lunch. We didn't care about a booth or table and these old ladies wanted a booth and was told that they would have to wait a couple of minutes. We got sat quickly. Then a moment later they got sat.  My boyfriend and I were looking through the menu when I noticed a server went up to them to get their drink order. I was thinking, okay maybe our server is busy and can't get to us yet? So I waited paitenly as maybe about five different people walked by us.  Then I noticed that the old ladies had gotten wine and bread and their menus were gone. Still no server.  Saw a server attend to a table behind us and glanced our way when he walked by. That was the last straw. I'm a server and I understand people can get busy and takes a while to get to a table but no one greeted us or even told us that they would be right with us. We waited about 20 minutes die someone to at least come by.  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to leave and as we walked out he told the hosts that no one went to our table and that we were leaving. They only said sorry and didn't try to fix the situation. I was infuriated as we left.  Not going back there again."
Chris M.,"Ventura, CA",0,33,,3.0,1/5/2016,"For a BJs, this is an excellent rating. Had to go here for an after-work thing. Staff was excellent, excellent, excellent! The food is greasy, cheap and lame (generally), so we try not to eat here. That said, for a beer with co-workers and maybe a little guaq? No worries!"
Kayluh D.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,31,7,4.0,1/4/2015,"Have come here on a couple occasions. My family splits the pepperoni pizza. It is quite tasty! The dough is fluffy and the pizza does not come out completely soaking is grease, which is nice. I did have mozzarella sticks on the other occasion, which were pleasant as well.  The restaurant is clean and nice décor. Usually we end up seating ourselves in the bar area, so there's not much of a wait. Our waiters\waitresses have usually been prompt and attentive. However, I do not think the prices for alcoholic beverages are on the drink menu? Or maybe I just missed it, I ordered a strawberry fruity alcoholic drink, It is good but when we got the bill it was like 9.00! (it is not THAT good). I don't remember it being so expensive the last time, however it might have been a happy hour then? That was my one complaint, that's expensive for a fruity drink that I never end of finishing the last 1\4 of it because it gets watery as it sits. Usually come here with family a lot, seeing as I believe they get BJ points? Not sure but we had a free Pazooki ticket, which was absolutely delicious! Never had one before coming here. However my mum gets them, I do suggest you keep giving those perks out, keeps us coming back!"
Michelle G.,"Ventura, CA",108,30,1,2.0,9/5/2015,"I went here about a year ago for drinks with the girls, the cider is good but the appetizers were awful. I got sick that night from the food, I had 1 drink only. Tried the place last night, ordered potatoes skins, they were greasy and over cooked. They crumbled into pieces when you took a bite. Again I got sick. Never going back to the Oxnard location. Also witnessed a server having a tantrum cause a table of his wouldn't order any more."
