Joshua C.,"Oxnard, CA",3,5,6,3.0,8/23/2013,"Love the restaurant & the food, but our waitress (Lisa B) was the worst. She walked past our table several times & not once did she ask if we needed a refill on our drinks or if we wanted desert.  What made this trip enjoyable was the fact we saw Michael Paul Chan (Lt. Tao) from The Closer & Major Crimes. We didn't bother him because it would be plain rude to bother someone while they're trying to eat. Would've given BJ's a five if not for the neglectful waitress."
Eric N.,"Stockton, CA",2985,597,3265,4.0,2/3/2012,"BJ's has its good points and bad points...but I think I finally figured out when to eat here.  The only time I usually come to BJ's now is between 3-7pm on weekdays...HAPPY HOUR!  Most of the time if you get there before 5 you don't even have to wait for a place to sit. Happy hour specials include: $1 off draft beer and cocktails $2 off appetizers Half off mini pizzas   Add all those up and you can have a whole meal for a whole lot less than usual.  They will let you order your mini pizza just about any way you want it...I order mine with white Alfredo sauce, pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese.  Totally amazing. I also consider their fried artichoke hearts the best I have ever had...today during happy hour I had two orders. Its a bit crowded in the bar area for obvious reasons and sometimes it can get a bit loud but really come on..its happy hour.   That's what it's all about, right? :0)"
Freddie E.,"Camarillo, CA",0,19,,1.0,3/26/2015,"I gave this establishment a one star because i feel their service is very much lacking. My friend and i waited a ridiculous amount of time for two beers and after waited an even greater amount of time for an appetizer, an appetizer! Our waitress seemed to not enjoy her job. Very disappointing."
Meli. O.,"Oxnard, CA",4,47,18,2.0,5/12/2016,"I've experienced better while dining in! Last night was the first time I opted to try the curbside pickup and not to self, never will I make that mistake again. I ordered via their website what I thought was primarily a simple process however I guess the employees cant read and interpret what the screen displays. No wonder why most restaurants are opting for computers without human interference. I ordered CALIFORNIA CHICKEN CLUB, NO TOMATO add MUSTARD, Thin fries with cheese and a dessert and submitted my order to be picked up at 6:30 pm. I caught my own error bc I placed the make and model of a GTI 2 door as the pickup vehicle. When I arrived  they were no pickup curbside spots available so I parked 2 spots over and called them and spoke to whoever answered the phone and told them that I was in a Nissan Sentra instead of GTI and that I was parked 2 spots down. That fell on deaf ears since I see Glenda walking out to the curbside with bags and going back inside the restaurant. I knew that was my order. I gave it 10 mins and I called again and Glenda picked up. I told her the same story that I did to some other rep a few mins ago and she apologized and came outside. As soon as she gave me order, I asked her does my fries have cheese...she looked confused and she said I can get cheese added to them. 10 minutes later she comes back with fresh fries but at this point my sandwich was soggy bc of the steam and being in a closed container 35 mins later. When I got home with my soggy sandwich I opened it up and bingo no mustard and soggy, old lettuce. I laughed it off at this point and realized the sticker on the box said ""add mustard"" ""cheese to fries""!!!! Why, is it so hard to follow directions. I blame myself also since I was too lazy to call the manager, too lazy to get dressed and dine in. There you have my  list a few grievances, spending close to $43 on 3 meals to have soggy sandwich and warm fries, I would expect that at a McDonalds certainly not this place. This experience is not for extraverts: If you're outgoing, this will actually hamper your ability to participate socially with others. All in all, the dessert was great, a fine way to disappear into your psychic void and whisper to the demons that haunt it after this experience."
Ryan K.,"Moorpark, CA",1,4,1,1.0,3/1/2015,"So my date and i felt like having one of these pizza cookies. It was either Bj's or Toppers Pizza. Sadly, we chose Bj's.  We felt bad just ordering the pizza cookie so we got a mini pizza as well. I was in the restroom and the waiter, name short for bob, was talking to my date. He assumed that she was alone, and when he found out there was another person, he seemed off. She ordered the mini pizza, and he was like, ""just a mini pizza?"" A tad rude. The mini pizza took a while too. By the time he got us water when I got back and took my seat, he was not talkative and very distant. He seemed perfect with other customers. It made my date and I felt very very very uncomfortable. It really felt awkward everytime he would walk by us and not make a smile or even eye contact.  The mini pizza arrived 30 minutes later, and still we have not received napkins or any utensils. It was 4 slices, and it was not the very best because my date only ate 1 and i had 2.  I feel like the waiter either wanted to us to order more food or just leave. Like I mentioned earlier, our whole date was very uncomfortable because of the waiter. The way he acted towards others and not us it was just weird.  Well we finally got to order the pizza cookies and right when he delivered it he left the check right next to it. I felt like he was trying to rush us. I did not like the way this waiter treated us. It was not right.  Bottom line: This will be the last time I take anyone here, and I will not recommend this company to anyone. Toppers would have been so much better."
Jan C.,"PALOS VERDES PENINSULA, CA",33,56,60,5.0,4/16/2016,"love this place, great setting, great prices, great servers.  they also have a really good lunch menu, with $4 lunch pints=great lunch."
Evil Q.,"Oxnard, CA",0,34,,2.0,11/23/2015,"I have been going to BJ's since they opened and the service has gone to crap!!!  Tonight, they weren't very busy.  We get seated immediately and 40 minutes later, the waiter takes our order!  He almost walked away before taking my husbands order!!  DUH!!!  The drinks (soda & waters) took forever!  He brought a refill of soda but gave 2 other tables drinks with my fries still on his tray.  The food was good but ""warm"".    Service has really killed this place!!  We go about every other month anymore!  Good food, the servers are usually very nice but SLOW  service!!"
amy j.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",16,65,15,5.0,7/15/2015,"This is great! It has a perfect location, it's right off of the freeway. Also excellent food and service as well. It was also so awesome that they had a gluten free menu  that was actually eatable! My family and I would definitely eat here again!'"
Lisa C.,"Port Hueneme, CA",10,40,8,1.0,2/15/2015,"Mahi Mahi fish tacos taste good alright but the quantity of fish you get in the tacos is a joke. The manager states that they are ""pre portioned"". It was THE most paltry, minuscule amount of pencil thin piece of fish I have ever seen in my life. Won't ever order them again. The pizza NEVER comes with a good amount of cheese on it either. I have ordered it several times and had the same issue every time with the pizza. This may well be the last time I come back to BJs. I'll miss the Pizzookies however......"
Analyssa B.,"Santa Maria, CA",7,18,3,5.0,7/26/2015,"It was my first time here at Bj's, and i must say the food was soo delicious. I'm not a huge burger fan but the burger i got (portebello swiss, medium rare) was so good i want it again. The service was decent but was weird when the woman was serving us had to switch out and a guy was a server towards the end but they were both helpful so didn't mind. Next time in oxnard or heading south defiantly will come here."
Arianne S.,"Camarillo, CA",28,116,51,2.0,6/1/2015,"For some reason every other BJs I've been to has been awesome. This location however lags. I had just a typical bacon burger and it was very bland. The next time I had lettuce wraps and as much as they put in it, THAT also tasted just very plain. It also didn't help that the last guy to help us was so rude and just over it. My sister and I were talking amounts ourselves talking about if we said anything wrong or if we're acting rude but the people behind us overheard and they spoke out to us and said he was rude to them too! I'll probably give this location one more shot just because I love every other location and it's so close by, but really some things have to change."
Merbita J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,17,1.0,11/11/2013,"We have been patrons of BJ's for years and have enjoyed delicious food and exceptional service.  However, based upon our experience this past Saturday, we will no longer be dining at any of their restaurants.  With every point of contact, from the hostess to several of the wait staff, we were treated with much indifference.  Upon our arrival (which was around 4pm to beat the dinner rush), the hostess for the evening greeted us with a forced smile and then had us waiting while she took a phone call for several minutes.  I have worked in the food and service industry in the past, and one very important thing I learned was to always first serve those who are right in front of you.  A phone call can wait.   When we were finally seated, our low-energy waitress provided us with lackluster service.  I believe she had 3 small tables total, but was hardly attentive.  We found it odd because she kept disappearing to the kitchen, but would return with nothing.   And speaking of the kitchen, the food was truly disappointing.  We were actually there to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  My husband and I were so looking forward to indulging in some of their beautifully crafted beers, mouth-watering pizzas, and, of course, end our special night with a scrumptious pizookie!  However, we should have known something was terribly wrong when we each received a dinner salad that was almost a third full of wilted, glassy-looking lettuce.   We let the salad slide because perhaps it was just a fluke.  But then, we received our hand tossed, thin crust pizza and we were so disheartened from the appearance alone.  The pizza was sloppily put together with strands of partially melted cheese on top strewn across the top.  Indeed, we found our pizza to be lukewarm at best and the taste was substandard.  What happened to the BJ's quality we had come to know and love?! Suffice it to say, our anniversary dinner was not what we were hoping it would be.  It was memorable, but unfortunately, not in a good way.  We could have eaten anywhere we wanted, but chose BJ's based on our past experiences, the amazing food, and quick, friendly service.  The management needs to be held accountable for the poor quality of food & the apathetic employees.  So disappointed at what this restaurant has become."
Rachel B.,"Oxnard, CA",92,43,1,4.0,10/13/2015,"I found the food very good. I loved the brussle sprouts and the Parm Chicken. It's next to a walmart, which isn't the best, but the inside is nice and service is good."
Mel C.,"Port Hueneme, CA",21,65,4,4.0,3/1/2015,Love the avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms. Always good service and great beers.
larry p.,"Oak View, CA",0,3,2,1.0,7/8/2013,"DON""T order the Salmon.  I saw the salmon on the menu and it looked amazing, however, what I actually got was something else entirely. It literally looked liked throw up.   It wasn't even remotely close to what's on the menu.  3 Strikes in baseball, but with these guys I'm stopping at 2.  Back to back horrible experience. Never again! On the plus side, the atmosphere is great and they do have great beer."
Eddie C.,"Torrance, CA",954,674,2706,4.0,9/18/2009,"Once again, a trip up the coast and once again BJs. This time the food was good and the service was friendly and efficient. I had this crazy open face burger called PIRANHA PALE ALE CHILI CHEESE ANGUS BURGER. D@mn was that good! This place is starting to grow on me! Next time? ANGUS POT ROAST SANDWICH-Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables- that's what I'm talking about!"
Miguel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",643,894,860,4.0,9/25/2011,"It is what it is.... Beer food and guffaws and guffaws and beer food....maybe even a cackle or two....I never cease to look around for these public displays of beer cheer when I come to any BJ's. Blame it on the beer.... Ok, so the service here is great. Really. The wait can be long as it was this night. Look at it this way. Don't those buzzer thingies they hand out to alert you when a table is ready make you feel all important and special? Yes, the wait can be long. But the service helps you forget. And oh so do the drinks haha!  I will give them four stars because the service is so good and because of the company I had this night. Delena you are the best!"
Jason C.,"Oxnard, CA",7,24,1,2.0,3/12/2015,Slow service was not given much attention and I was on a date. Took longer to pay then to wait for my meal that is not okay people don't want to sit around and lounge while all the staff is up at the bar conversating with drunk people. Only reason why I'm giving two stars is because I got laid afterwards
Jen G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",66,117,76,3.0,4/23/2015,Ok for food and has a great selection. To be fair I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants. I hate waiting for something that is just so/so and there seems to always be a line. Get rid of the lines and it would be a decent place to get a meal.
Val S.,"Port Hueneme, CA",81,14,,5.0,7/20/2015,"I love going to BJ'S all the time with my friends, and family! I have been there over 10x and I have never had any complaints! The food is always great, great customer service! Great Prices! I will continue to come back! I recommend this Brewery to everyone!"
