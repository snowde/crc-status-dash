Glenn B.,"Camarillo, CA",9,7,3,4.0,5/11/2015,"This is our favorite family place to eat. It never disappointed. We always leave with a full tummy, well satisfied, and we don't break the bank."
Krista P.,"Ventura, CA",0,5,2,3.0,5/1/2016,"food is great.service, not so much.waiter told one of our party she was an alcoholic. also said ""sure,I got all night ""when we ordered more.spent over $500 as a large group there, felt very unwelcome.poor service"
Tara H.,"Oxnard, CA",91,5,,5.0,4/21/2016,The food is really good.  Definitely recommend the Ahi Tuna app.  And of course the pizzocies!!!
James T.,"Oxnard, CA",71,1,,5.0,6/14/2015,Vary friendly and they remember you and know what you like to eat. Great place to come to eat
Tina C.,"Ventura, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/23/2016,"Major disappointment is what I call this place.Went here for a family party,we were a party of only 25.I say only 25 because an establishment like this should be able to handle this size with no problems.First off the wait for our order was ridiculous,some people didn't receive their order for at least an hour and we had to keep asking for our food repeatedly. My  husbands burger was 2 hours late.When we we did finally receive it some of the orders were wrong,my burger was cold,cold as like refrigerated bread cold.Asked to speak to manager and waitress had an attitude problem and eventually said she would get him and she never did.My family member had to approach him himself,I couldn't believe he was the manager when I saw him due to the fact he looked very sloppy.Management in this establishment is non existent.I will definitely not be coming back to this location or recommend to any sane individual to do the same Save your money.Walk across the street to In n Out you'll be more satisfied."
Robert A.,"Ventura, CA",46,163,,4.0,3/23/2014,"Well, compared to the new spots that have opened in Riverpark, BJs is still a little better.   PROs--Food is fine, tad pricey, but it's a step up from fast food.  Drinks are ok, but also a tad pricey.  Nice big TVs.  The pizza is great!! Nice and fluffy. CONs--Gets crowded, and there's no shortage of Oxnard knuckleheads. Sometimes the wait is a bit long, but that isn't necessarily the restaurant's fault.  Also, getting a good waiter/waitress is hit-and-miss....one day they're fine, the other not.   I'll still go here because my wife likes the food and the bar seating is ok."
Bill V.,"Ventura, CA",0,4,1,5.0,5/18/2015,We went for our first beer event was wonderful would recommend it to anybody that Matthew was R manager fun  guy he kept everything moving smoothly had a great time will be back in 3 months for the next event would highly recommend attending one of these events
Jay L.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,84,140,4.0,8/17/2013,"Seasonal beers are great, especially in BJs.  Can't go wrong with coming here anytime during the day and for any occasion. Menu is awesome and accommodating in price, taste, and appetite. Recommendations: Jambalaya, Chicken and Broccoli Baked Potato, and for dessert a pazookie (giant cookie with ice cream on top). The beer samplers are flavorful and distinct.  They come in 4 or 8 half-pint glasses.   Try the 8 but have a designated driver.  Service isn't bad in almost any BJs I have been to.  Price: Fair Food: Large selection of American dishes Ambiance: Sports Bar, Grills; great for social get togethers Service: Good Repeat Patron: Yes"
M M.,"Oxnard, CA",326,23,4,2.0,10/11/2015,"Normally whenever I come, there's excellent service. I usually get the kid grilled chicken with rice and vegetables- tonight I ordered it for takeout. Upon arrival (my order was supposed to be ready at 5:00), I was greeted by an unfriendly employee at the takeout counter. I paid for my order and was told ""your order isn't ready yet."" So I stood at the counter awkwardly for about 10 minutes. During that time - this employee greeted other guests with a pleasant smile, offered them a drink and to sit down. I finally received my food and when I went home i saw that the vegetables were completely raw, and my side of spinach was soooooo small. :( not happy about this experience"
Tom B.,"Camarillo, CA",16,6,3,4.0,3/31/2015,"There are a lot of great things about BJ'S but my favorite items are the avocado egg rolls,  BJ'S classic pizza and the committed double IPA. Good service and nice people make it a winning experience every time."
Dri M.,"Portland, OR",1,72,6,4.0,2/26/2015,"Love this place in any state. I happen to live by the one off the 101 freeway in Oxnard. Very convenient and easy to find. Happy hour is really good here with evening and late night hours. But the reason Im writing this review is because they have a new small salad with fresh watermelon,feta,mixed greens with a honey balsamic vinagerette;Fantastic hands down one of the Salads ever!!!! Very light with a nice crunch and a hint of sweetness AMAZING!!!!!!!Please keep adding new menu items. We love the old one but its nice that you keep us updated and with new things. I appreciate you Bj's."
Elizabeth M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5,22,12,5.0,2/21/2015,had lunch today at this location and it was delicious. i had the lemon thyme chicken. i did not want my dish to finish. so flavorful and i liked it because it had brusell sprouts which you don't see often at restaurants. it was flavorful and perfectly cooked. i would definitely recommend this dish! my cousin had the caesar salad and although i didn't have any she said it was dry and from what i saw it just looked like a bowl of lettuce. oh i also had the chicken tortilla soup and that was really good too! i definitely can't wait to go back.
K B.,"Westminster, CA",0,10,,3.0,6/4/2015,"I made the mistake of confusing a sports bar with a restaurant. Or else this BJ's needs some serious waiter training. The waiter was friendly enough and I would never blame the waiter for a slow kitchen or bar. They both were slow the drinks were forever arriving. I kept waiting for the table to be cleared so we could chat and maybe decide on coffee and dessert. In spite of asking more than once the waiter would remove a plate or two but not clear and clean. I finally complained ( I rarely do) and he argued with me. There is only on plate he says. One plate with four other dishes stacked on it, which he reluctantly cleared. The three stars was for the food and most of the staff friendly. I left a decent tip $15 on a $108 bill because I figured poor training or perhaps my mistake having dinner in a sports bar. I have never had issues at other BJ's but have only eaten in the bar area."
Youri Y.,"Oxnard, CA",734,529,863,4.0,6/21/2011,I came here with my family the Saturday of Father's Day weekend and waited approximately 20 min to get seated (which is reasonable for dad and grad weekend). I ordered the traditional calzone and it was delicious :) I also tried some of my family's chicken entrees and it was tender and juicy. I would come again for the fast service and well-cooked food.
Jeremiah T.,"Laguna Hills, CA",40,66,16,3.0,1/25/2015,The creamy garlic dressing tasted like juice from a sardine can. Seriously. Neither me or my girl could eat more than 1 bite. Epic fail.
David E.,"Oxnard, CA",8,8,35,1.0,12/6/2014,"Been to this BJ's many many times! Usually have solid food and service.. Until today. Came for lunch and my friend had a hair come out her mouth from the fries she put in. OUT of her mouth!! Wish I took a pic, because it was a short curly one, no joke! I realize some people might do this scenario in order to get free food, but the fact the manager (Matt) just comped the fries was in very poor taste since it really did happen."
Sean M.,"West Hills, CA",449,459,613,4.0,6/30/2011,"We had outstanding service last time we were here. Food was also great. Prices are what you'd expect, though it got a little pricier than we'd expected ($171 with tip for 7 adults and 1 child)  But I hate how long you have to wait...we even called 30 mins prior to going to make a reservation and we still had to wait 20 more minutes.  But since we got some free pizza while waiting and great service, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3"
Tonika G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,64,16,3.0,12/14/2014,The 3 stars are for the staff they were great always very nice and friendly. The food on the other hand has been getting worse :( the drinks are good though.
Jake S.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/8/2015,Showed up at 515 at the BJ's in oxnard. October 30th. Not very busy would say medium. At 530 I went to front desk to ask to have a mgr come to my table. We have yet to have a waiter. I go sit back down. The girl at the front desk comes to my table says mgr will be with us shortly. We tell her we have not even had our drink order taken yet. She said she would take it and she need to go get a paper to take our order.  She never came back  Finally at 535 the mgr comes to our table. Does not introduce her self and says sorry. Very unprofessional. takes our order and leaves. 10 min later she brings our drinks and tells us our food will coming in a minute. 10 more min go by and nothing. This is the fourth time out of the five times I have been to this location with some terrible unacceptable issues.
Michelle L.,"Simi Valley, CA",61,65,46,1.0,8/13/2014,"Came for lunch and they were not busy....half the place was empty. However we (as well many others in the waiting area) we're being told it was a 15-20min wait. We asked if there was a reason for wait since there were tons of open tables and we had limited time. We were told that they ""didn't know"". It just seemed like it was disorganized or that everyone moved slow there. Anyway...We gave up and left. We went to Lazy Dog Cafe where they were very busy but we were seated immediately and had amazing service."
