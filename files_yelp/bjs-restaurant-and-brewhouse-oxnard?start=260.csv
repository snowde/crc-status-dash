John M.,"Camarillo, CA",221,281,221,2.0,11/12/2012,"Went yesterday for lunch with the wife.  It was busy, but not crazy busy.  Service was slow, and our waitress took her break in the middle of a shift, at 12:45.  Why they let anyone take a break during peak hour is beyond me. Ordered the chicken fried steak.  Took a while to get it, and when I did, it was tough.  The sauce had melted and the plate was hot, indicating it was sitting in the service window for a while (used to work at a restaurant).  The menu description said the gravy was a pepper gravy, but it was like liquid and absolutely flavorless. My wife ordered her turkey cobb sandwich without tomato.  But she could taste that it had been there, and they removed it (pregnant women can taste anything!). It was too busy to speak with a manager, but I've never had any issues with the BJs in Westlake.  But I would probably look elsewhere the next time I'm in the Nard."
Crystal S.,"Oxnard, CA",36,1,,2.0,5/20/2015,"Took my mom for lunch yesterday. The restaurant was not full not busy. Waiter made his rounds, then decided to come our table. We ordered drinks and he brought them over about 3/4 full. First time that I've ever been anywhere where they do not fill it to the top. Even with refills, cups were not filled completely. Ordered a flat bread pizza with no bacon as I don't eat pork or red meat. It came with bacon pieces that I had to pick off. When the waiter came to check on us, it was 15 minutes after our food was served. I informed him that my order was wrong. I ate it because it took so long to for him to come by and I had already spent 5 minutes picking all the bacon off. He offered a small mini pizookie. But that did not makeup for the poor service we had. It seems like  service has gone downhill. Not sure if there will be a next time."
Alex A.,"Oxnard, CA",4,28,26,2.0,9/14/2015,"Haven't been here for a while. Usually the service and food are great. Decided to eat here last night and boy what a mistake that was.  First we tell them that we need a table for 6, preferably a booth. They sat us at a table for 4 then they're scrambling to find two other chairs once I told her we are 6 not 4. I asked what about a booth and she said there is nothing else available. I told her what about the booth right behind us. She said it's not available, but nobody was sitting there, ok. Then it took about 15-20min before the waiter even came to our table and when he did he didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink, he dropped of the silverware and napkins and left. I was sarcastic when he came by and dropped off the silverware, he said you guys are going to need these as I replied yes and some DRINKS too and all he did was laugh. That didn't even seem to work!!! We sat for over 30min before we got anything to drink. Any other time I would of just left. I don't know why I didn't do it this time. The service was just HORRIBLE! We ordered the appetizer when we ordered our drinks and we didn't get it till about 5min before our meal came.  Throughout this entire time I asked one of them idiots in all black if we where going to get some kind of service soon, we've been sitting here for 30min and nothing to drink. She said yes I'm really sorry and someone will come to help you. Right there and then she should of went out of her way and asked what we wanted to drink. Not to mention our pizzas where cold. Our food was probably done but our waiter never checked, cause it wasn't until I asked if our food was coming soon and our waiter gasped and said oh yes let me check. So basically we sat for about 1hr 15min before we even started to eat. Manager never bothered to ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything as he walked right next to us asking the other tables. I've heard from others that the service has gone downhill lately, it is very true. So many other great places to eat in Ventura county that as a customer you don't really need to put up with crap like this. Usually any other professional establishment try and make up for the bad service but not here. I don't think they even realized they F'd up. Guess we won't be eating here again!!!"
Tim S.,"Ventura, CA",18,23,5,4.0,12/24/2014,"The potatoes were crispy and although it wasn't a gourmet presentation, it was definitely a comfort food to witness a Broncos' loss to the Bengals. The service was exceptional and friendly and not overbearing as sometimes. The goat cheese pizza was delicious along with the cookie w/IC."
Karen D.,"Ventura, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/8/2015,We went around 6 pm and was able to get a table right away. It was National  Beer day. We ordered  our beer and waited over 15 minutes  for our drinks. Too long. My husband ordered lasagna  and got ravioli.   My food had no flavor.
Princess Kim R.,"San Diego, CA",121,250,,2.0,9/24/2012,"My boyfriend and I ventured into Oxnard late one night after spending entirely too much time being lazy in Ventura. What were we doing? Honestly, I don't remember. It probably involved some combination of watching wack comedy, doing our best sloth impressions on his couch, and me avoiding his cat like it was carrying the Black Plague. At any rate, we needed late-night food, and this was one of the few places that was open. We got there maybe a half hour before closing time, which I feel is all right. We wouldn't walk in 10 minutes before midnight or anything. We're not dicks, even if one of us has some pretty great man bits (Hint: It's not me.). We ordered our food, and since I knew the kitchen was closing and wanted a dessert that usually takes some advance notice, I asked if I should put in the order for it right then, with the food. The server was a doll and told me that I still had time, and that I could wait. Cool. It's nice to be able to eat and not feel rushed. The food arrived, and it was pretty forgettable. I know, I know. It's chain restaurant food. It's not supposed to be memorable. Anyway, I don't remember gagging, and I certainly didn't feel the need to give up on life while eating there (I'm looking at you, Crapplebee's). The food by itself would probably get 3 stars. Here's where things took a turn for the worse. After we'd gotten our bill, I was pulling money out of my bag to pay, and some scrotum-head security guard on a power trip walked over, swinging his flashlight and clearly mistaking himself for a big, swinging dick in the world of chain restaurant security. ""Hey, you guys need to wrap it up, eh? We're trying to get home."" Dude, who the fuck are you? Our server is the one busting her ass, and she's being WAY more patient and polite than you are. Also, what do you think I'm planning on doing with this cash? Making it rain? Trust me, the only selling point to Oxnard is that the boxer Sergio Martinez lives here, and since I haven't seen him around this joint, I'm making like a tree and leaving.  After we'd paid and were approaching the door, we came across the same security guard, only this time, he was accompanied by a member of the restaurant staff. He wished us a good night in front of the staff member as if he hadn't just tried to shake us from the place like the last drops of pee at a urinal. My boyfriend, being more outspoken than I am, gave him a sarcastic, ""Yeah, ok."" I gave him a jerk-off motion. Behind his back. In my head. From the safety of our car."
Leslie V.,"Oxnard, CA",221,143,599,4.0,5/18/2011,I love going out to bjs especially with big groups. Their food is good and reasonable prices to.  I usually order pasta. My favorite is the cajun shrimp pasta. Always a big portion and can never finish all of it! Shrimp scampi is also really good. I am really big on honey mustard and they have one of my favorites especially with their chicken wings or chicken tenders. The best! Their drinks are also really good and decent prices. Their famous strawberry splash has to be one of my favorite drinks. I usually always order one when I'm in their.  This is a good fun place to eat at for either lunch or dinner. The have a big menu suitable just for everyone
Melanie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,161,4,5.0,9/23/2014,"We decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table on Saturday night.  The service was incredible.  OUr waiter was very friendly without asting like a kiss ass just to get a good tip.  The food was super good, too.  We got the lettuce wraps for an appetizer and I had the cajun pasta.  My boyfriend got the buffalo pizza.  Both entrees were incredible.  Neither of us could decide what our favorite part was.  The dessert was incredible, as well.  The best part was that they had moscato on the menu, so that makes me a happy camper.  I just wish there was one closer to Santa Barbara!  We would probably go at least once a month if there was."
Mike M.,"Sunland, CA",242,380,231,3.0,4/30/2013,"I really like the roast beef dip sandwich - how can you go wrong when it comes on garlic bread!  Prices are okay, but the killer is the wait.  If lunch didn't take 90 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME, I'd give it another star.  Still worth going to if you have the time."
Kevin F.,"Oxnard, CA",1,54,82,2.0,12/27/2015,"Came her with a group from work .  Took forever to get out food delivered. Even though it was not terribly busy.  The food itself was tasty.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad.  However I was never asked if I wanted seconds on anything.  Even if I had I would have declined because I didn't have another 15 minutes to wait for s second bowl of soup.  I will probably not come back here because of the very poor service, which I'd unfortunate, given the food was good,"
Mikey M.,"Ventura, CA",26,26,18,5.0,10/27/2014,"With fifty plus visits over the course of three years,  I have had the pleasure of indulging practically the whole menu and a wide variety of their beer selection. From their seasonal menu to their periodically changing menu and their holiday menu,  I have tried it all. With saying this,  I would have to say that almost everyone will be happy with diversity of the food and brews. For those who are more health conscious,  they offer items on their Enlightened menu to better suit individuals personal needs.  BJs also offers various Happy Hour specials ranging from four to six dollars that includes both drinks and food.  They also provide free WiFi for all customers throughout the restaurant.  Customer service is very exceptional compared to most other restaurants and often are very reasonable to accommodate a majority of parties. Whether your by yourself,  a family of four or a party of eight or more,  be rest assured that you will have a good time."
Carol H.,"Ventura, CA",1,6,,5.0,6/17/2016,"I came here for a Birthday Lunch with a friend and my lunch was great!  I had the hot Roast beef sandwich with a blue cheese wedge salad.  And it was so good.  I keep thinking about going back and eating it again.  But unfortunately, my girlfriend got the turkey burger and it was undercooked.  I'm actually writing this because of our Waiter.  His name was Victor F. and he was So incredible .  He was So nice about it. He took her lunch back twice and unfortunately we didn't feel comfortable about it cause it still didn't look like it was cooked enough.  So he was worried that she didn't have anything to eat while she waiting, so he left the fries.  After the second time of refusing the sandwich, he allowed her to order a different sandwich at no charge. And it came out so fast.  He was so attentive and nice, that both my friend and I agreed that it's not just the food that make a good restaurant but the people that wait on you.  We'll be back because of him"
Debbie M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2015,"Food was OK, the service HORRIFIC.  Sunday evening July 26 about 5:30 pm.  Lots of open tables, not crowded at all.  A meal for party of four (just sandwiches, nothing fancy) took over an hour and 40 minutes.  We were seated immediately, no wait.  Our server finally took our order over 30 minutes later, then it took another 35 minutes for the food to show up at the table.  We're seated at the table for over an hour before the food arrives. Server couldn't care less.  Had to wait for 15-20 minute gaps for her to return to the table, and each time I have to ask for drink refills; she disappears and comes back 15-minutes later with the iced tea refill pitcher.  My ice has long since melted in my glass, and she just pours warm tea from a pitcher into the glass with no ice.  Had to ask her for ice, and she disappears for another 15-20 minutes.  Made the mistake of ordering a pizookie for dessert; that took another half hour. Just like the previous reviewer said ""Service sucked, service sucked, service sucked"".  The management at this restaurant should be looking through these yelp reviews, notice that a significant number of them identify the terrible service, and fix the problem.  Like many others, I won't come back here; doesn't matter how good the food is, when the service is this bad, it turns customers away for good."
B B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,10,3,5.0,6/14/2014,"Excellent service & food from Bjs :) Everyone was extremely attentive & professional. The host sat our family as soon as we walked in (around 6pm on Saturday), our server, Debbie, greeted us immediately & took our drink order. We took awhile to figure out what we wanted, but our server was patient and checked in a couple of times before we ordered. My husband ordered the top sirloin with potatoes & green beans, his meal was delicious! I was a little jealous & wished I had ordered what he did. I ordered the jalapeno burger with the tomato/mozzarella salad & fries. Everything tasted good, but the tomato salad was my favorite. I also ordered the Jerry Burst beer, which I enjoyed. My children ordered kids meals: pizza & mac n cheese. It was as expected & the kids enjoyed it. We finished our meals by sharing pizookies. They were perfect & gobbled up in no time! Our server brought out a Fathers Day glass gift for my husband, which we thought was awesome!"
Samantha J.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,8,4,1.0,7/16/2014,"We gave this BJs location several chances -- but every single time, our overall experience has always, always been shitty. I am Asian but married to a Caucasian. Whenever I am with my family, without my husband, we are treated very poorly. The service gets significantly better only when my husband is with us.  The food is great, no doubt about that. But it isn't worth going because there is always a long wait. Food served is always wrong. I can go on and on about my complaints but I am sure a lot of people have already experienced the same.  My favorite on their menu is the spaghetti with spicy sauce and meatballs. The last time I was there, I had to return it twice because they kept giving me the wrong sauce (it was a red marinara sauce with meat and not spicy at all, not the orange-ish colored, spicy one I always had) When I complained, they told me that was the only sauce they had, when I argued even more, they said they no longer served it the way they did before? WTF? Also, the breadsticks that came with the spaghetti were so burnt they did not even look edible.  Another time I was there with my two kids, we were seated after a long wait. We had our menu closed and waited for a host to greet us and get our order but nobody came. There were waiters passing our table left and right, but nobody stopped at our table. After half an hour sans service, we walked out.  Shitty, shitty restaurant, the worst ever in my books. We are never going back there again. I will be happy if they go out of business and replaced with a restaurant who value their customers.  Wish yelp had a ""no-star"" rating because this restaurant deserves that!"
Martha D.,"Ojai, CA",0,20,,2.0,6/26/2014,"What a disappointment. We've always liked coming here for birthdays. Our waiter was occasionally around, and pleasant when we saw him, but with extremely long waits in between. The food was less than mediocre, we ordered the same thing we had less than six months ago and were greatly disappointed. The personal pizza was almost in edible, the dough was damp and raw... Minimal toppings, would have sent it back if there had been someone to send it with. After a very long wait the birthday pazookie arrived, we wanted to order more for everyone, but, again, there was no one from whom to order... Finally sent the kids home while we waited a very long time for the bill, I waited tables for years but could barely bring myself to leave 10%, and I typically leave 20. Sadly, we have crossed BJ's off of our go to list. And to add insult to injury, the bathrooms were disgustingly filthy."
Liz M.,"Oxnard, CA",0,53,15,3.0,6/1/2014,"What happened to this place it use to be the shizzz net until yard house came ..lol I honestly prefer this food than yard house this is much better. The wait was normal 10-20 mins, the waiters were pretty busy but come on give them a break when your going in there at 10pm who dosent wanna go home and sleep they brought my food and that's all that matters there moscato was delicious. Will come back here again for sure"
Anthony G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/6/2015,"I come into this location probably more than I should since I am on the verge of becoming an alcoholic (first step is admitting your problem right?) and I absolutely LOVE the happy hour here. I always sit at the bar to avoid server abuse and long wait times for service. I want to compliment the bartenders Ryan and Maria for their excellent service...ALWAYS. They take care of me right away, remember my drink of choice, and encourage me on my alcoholism by asking if I am ready for another one by the time the last drop of my drink is almost done. Aside from that these two get REALLY busy, but this has never EVER affected my service. I wish I could say the same for other of the bartenders here. See you tonight BJ's! LOL"
Matt B.,"Irvine, CA",77,48,21,2.0,3/21/2013,"Kitchen was crazy slow. How long does it take to prepare a salad when the restaurant clearly isn't near capacity? Apparently over 30 minutes. The appetizer we ordered never showed.  When we let one of the servers know, she said ""You're kidding me!"" .. because I always joke around about food not showing up."
Lesley H.,"Elk Grove, CA",270,160,63,4.0,9/30/2012,"BJ'S RESTAURANT & BREWHOUSE BREAKDOWN: THE FOOD:  I've been to 5 different BJ's Restaurants in multiple cities (NorCal-SoCal), and their food is basically standardized.  This chain, makes sure that al it's food is delicious!  They serve a large menu.  The only complaint is that the food is a bit heavy, but I guess you expect that when you eat out nowadays. THE VALUE:  The prices are fair.  They have lunch specials with soup/sandwich/fries deals and lunch size entrees (like salmon).  Dinner is about $10-20/person.  The grown up drinks are about $5-10. THE EXPERIENCE:  I've only been to this location once, but we had a great server."
