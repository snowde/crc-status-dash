Ryan W.,"Ventura, CA",101,49,27,4.0,8/10/2014,Food is fantastic and I love the nutty brewnette beer.  Poor service the most recent time at this location ... I understand a dinner rush but It almost seemed like they were understaffed. Sat with no water or beer for at least 15 minutes even after asking for more ... I'm not a tough critic tho it usually is an A+ experience and I'll still return for sure
Clarissa H.,"Ventura, CA",100,125,5,2.0,3/7/2010,"Look, catch me a few years ago this place would have been a 4 or a 5. Let's talk about BJ's, I used to love it, avacado eggrolls, are so rich and lovely.. Pizookie - Godiva chocolate and chocolate chip, YES! Oh yum, their burger sliders, tomato bread bowl soups, chili not half bad. crispy chicken sandwich, early adolescent years. Then I burnt out on it, not to mention I was infatuated with chicken ceasar sandwich that they had, until they discontinued it. It only took the one time I got food poisoning from it to make me very weary about going back there, and then...My co-worker got seriously ill after eating a ceasar salad there too a week afterward, what the Hell BJ's? Coincidence? I dont think so. Or the condescending waiter I've had once, or the other one who was just too damn fake-polite it made me want to barf, or the bitchy mid-life crisis waitress who wreaks of cigarettes every time we go just started to get to me. I'm going to safely say that, BJ's in Oxnard blows, but other BJ's I've been too have kept up to par with standards and food, don't get me wrong it's good stuff, just don't go the one here."
Khathy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",559,307,40,3.0,3/5/2012,"Got nothing to do on a Saturday night in Oxnard? Come to BJ's! You will discover that the whole city has dinner here on the weekend, then moves over a few tables in the bar for drinks after. This is definitely the most popping establishment around here. Maybe it was a town hall meeting? Regardless, BJ's never fails. Drinks are drinks but I appreciate their great small bites and appetizer prices. Plus, who knew they had a full bar?! I'm only on wine at the moment but for your varied group of friends, that's always a good thing.  It's too bad it smells like cow outside."
Kevin R.,"Ventura, CA",8,20,4,1.0,3/22/2014,Step up your game!! Bjs is lousy. They screwed up our order 3 times. We ended up just eating a pazookie for dinner. Don't ever come to bjs during peak hours. The waiter was nice his name was hansel. He was the only reason we didn't just get up and leave. Really nice guy. The manager came over and acknowledged the fact that we had a horrible experience but didn't really solve any issues or help at all. She was pretty useless. Pretty awful overall experience.
Salina G.,"Ventura, CA",2,3,1,3.0,10/22/2014,Great food! The pizza and pasta are my favorite! But unfortunately the service is not so great.. For some reason my appetizers always get forgotten about. And the servers seem to disappear when you need something. Wish they would step up their game. Curbside pickup is the way to go!
Victor V.,"Camarillo, CA",6,103,1,2.0,5/26/2013,"Used to be good, but now tastes like everything else cooked in Oxnard does.   I ate here fairly regularly when they opened. Decent steaks and burgers, OK personal pizzas too.      Tried one of the B.J. bacon cheeseburgers for lunch and told the server ""pink and juicy on the inside"" when she asked how I wanted it cooked.   Guess how it came out?   Well-done.    I had declined both the wedge fries and the crispy fries and opted for a side of onion rings.  When the dish was brought out, I got bits of onion covered with batter. They appeared to be left-overs (and just warm).  The server says they have ""onion strings"" not rings.  Why did she not tell me that when I ordered rings?      I cut the burger up and showed her the well-done meat.  She said she'd get me one cooked per the order.  A shift manager came by and said another burger is on its way....       My gal finished her sandwich which was OK, before my second burger arrived. The second burger comes out 3/4 medium well, 1/4 medium( pink) and fairly dry.  The server checks and asks ""how did they do?""  and I say the same as the last one.  Another manager shows up and says ""that's not how a medium burger should look!""    He offered to cook me one himself, but I thanked him and said strike two - we are good to go.  He says no charge for my burger.   I had good service, but below par food.  This seems to counter most of the other reviews."
Princess P.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,273,176,5.0,7/6/2014,Super fast service and an extremely patient server. I think we really put him through the wringer with all of the substitutions. The salted caramel pizooki is everything! OMG!
Leah Q.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",1,15,4,3.0,10/18/2014,"I think the kitchen staff has gone WAY downhill and wasn't impressed with the way the manager handled all of the mistakes that were made at our table. One of our steaks was underdone so we sent it back.. They literally burned it and sent the same steak back instead of starting over on a new one.. His excuse was that they were ""training for the holidays and the kitchen staff are pricks""... Nice management, bro. It's insulting to send food like that out and the kitchen, expo and server could have seen that plate before it came back and corrected it. They at least comped it since nobody wanted to eat it, the three stars are only due to one of the female servers apologizing and at least they can put drinks in a glass OK. But knocking your mix drinks to be ""all syrup"" probably wasn't a good selling point either."
Bill H.,"Moorpark, CA",1058,15,8,5.0,12/2/2014,PHENOMENAL meal and service thanks to Patrick. He should be training servers. We'll be back!
Natals P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,14,242,4.0,2/10/2013,"I'm new to the west coast and was pleasantly surprised by this chain brewery/restaurant. I've been about four times now and cannot say I've been knocked out by their beers, but they offer other breweries on draft and in bottles at reasonable prices. There is a decent amount of vegetarian options as far as bar fare is concerned. The pizzas are pretty tasty with loads of options for toppings, though watch out-the price for toppings can add up quickly. I'd recommend going during happy hour when the beers are cheaper and the mini pizzas are half price. Now THAT is a good deal! Apparently it can get really crowded here, but only once did I have to wait and it was only 10 minutes at the most. I think the service could be stepped up just a notch as far as attentiveness is concerned. They have a rewards program,  but I had to ask about it, and I've never been asked about it when I pay resulting in me forgetting and having to go online to get credit for the visit. I have yet to see the benefits of the rewards program but my coworker said it was worth it. I guess whatever reward comes will be worth it since its free. They seem to be very accommodating to groups, which was my first visit, but that was also the worst service I experienced - relatively speaking. To the servers credit, she was extremely friendly and did what she could to remedy the issues immediately.  Overall, a relaxed atmosphere that is a nice place to go for a beer or two with friends. Not a foodie paradise, but good eats. I'd be disappointed to be taken here on a date though, only because its a bit loud."
Hunter N.,"Ventura, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/19/2016,"We picked 5pm for dinner specifically to avoid the ""dinner crush"" and were relatively quickly seated. For the next 15 minutes the entire wait staff fussed over a party of about 12 people, moving them, chatting with them, bringing drinks, etc. I ordered the special Ginger IPA and was excited to try it. My friend, upon advice from our waitress, decided to test mine before ordering a full glass, as it's a hoppy beer, and not for the uninitiated or faint of heart. We ordered the avocado rolls because we were so hungry.... and thought they would go well with the beer. quite a while later we were informed (very casually) that there was no more Ginger. Big disappointment. 5pm on Saturday of Father's Day weekend, and no Ginger IPA to be had. Waitress didn't make any other suggestions, so I just ordered plain tea, which arrived along with my friend's water. We asked twice about our avocado rolls, and were told they were being assembled. No suggestions or inquiries about food. Ice tea quickly disappeared, as the glass was mostly filled with ice. No more tea, no more waitress. Another person brought the avocado rolls, but neither noticed, nor offered more water or tea. The rolls were a bit spicy for my senior friend, and the sauce completely off the chart, so we flagged down our waitress and asked for sweet and sour or some other ""suitable"" substitute. Another long wait.... and we snagged her attention, and she informed us that the manager had advised her that there simply was nothing that could be done. At this point my friend ordered our check. Still no more tea, no water, and leftover avo-rolls. No inquiries, no offers, no apologies, which is not what I have come to enjoy or expect from BJs. I had been going to Yard House and Lazy Dog to try them out, and sadly have come to the realization that BJs is suffering from the competition and is either not training people to ""compete"" or just not carefully monitoring what was not at all a busy store at 5 pm."
Cristina R.,"Oxnard, CA",0,33,16,5.0,8/31/2014,"Had lunch with boyfriend and brothers fam. In total 5 adults and one toddler. Food and customer service was very good. Negative was that when an appetizer is ordered, it's expected to come well before the main meals, at least for me. It was actually the last thing brought to the table. For a minute we thought it was forgotten. Also my nieces fruit was forgotten too. Reading reviews and my own past experiences, I think the managers need to be on the floor and engage with the customers. Have been a regular since the restaurant and have never been engaged with by a manager. So much competition in Oxnard now, that they got to pick up their game."
DeWayne F.,"Bend, OR",2,176,43,4.0,11/11/2012,Star rating is for this style of restaurant.  I deducted one star do to lack of flexibility. Enjoyed my food and the ball game. Friendly staff and good IPA.  Thanks
Renee H.,"Ventura, CA",44,16,36,3.0,3/17/2014,"Made reservations for my sons birthday for a larger party. Our waitress couldn't have cared less about our service. We did have to wait for a few stragglers to show up, which was about 30 minutes, so it took extra time to order- not the waitresses fault,but by the time we were ready to order in the next five minutes, the waitress was no where in site. Everyone was starving, my son finally asked a waiter to bring fries just to suffice. This waitress let our drinks dwindle to nothing, we had to flag her to ask for refills, and she never checked us otherwise...but definitely was quick to remove our plates when we finished our food. We didn't get her name unfortunately- she was brunette, 5'4 maybe . Thankfully the food was bomb! We do give thanks to the chefs! Thanks also to the taller, dark haired guy who brought a pizookie with a candle so we could sing Happy Birthday to my son... Was an OK TIME. Nothing special unfortunately, which is kind of sad since we were celebrating a birthday."
Mac N.,"Oxnard, CA",4,117,26,2.0,6/11/2014,Food is ok but honestly...why is the service so slow??? It shouldn't take 25 min to order when the restaurant isn't busy !
Alissa R.,"Ventura, CA",579,157,291,4.0,3/5/2012,"I absolutly LOVE the brunch on sat/sun! My boyfriend and I both get the California Scramble: eggs, cheese, tomato, avocado, on top of potatoes with two pieces of bread and Coffee. My daughter always gets french toast and a side of sausage. It is delicious every time and fair price! The only thing I really dont like is it can (not always) take a long time to be seated or get food..."
Lisa R.,"Oxnard, CA",10,34,6,2.0,7/23/2014,Celebrated a special occasion tonight at BJ's. There was approximately 20 people and we were told BJ's would not give us separate checks! Service and food was great but spending an additional hour figuring out what everyone owed was the downer! BJ's you really need a better way of dealing with large parties! This was absolutely ridiculous!
Sonia M.,"Tehachapi, CA",65,2,,1.0,2/22/2014,"Worst service ever. We usually LOVE BJ's but this was our first (and only) visit in Oxnard. Our waiter had his pants half way down his back side, our food came out wrong and was barely warm, my husband had the 8 glass sampler and the empty glasses got left on our very small table despite many servers including our own walking past and looking at them. Not one person working there was personable and every one of them looked disheveled. BJ's Oxnard you are in dire need of some good management. First time in my life that I have not left a tip."
Nancy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,88,,3.0,12/2/2012,"Always a wait whenever I come here, regardless of size of group. Porkchops are really good and moist Avocado eggrolls are delicious and hard to share pizzas are all very good Meatloaf was standard and boring Cajun chicken pasta is huge with lots of onions and peppers Chicken alfredo with broccoli is good Really good place to come for drinks. The Blonde and Jeremiah Red are nice beers to share or you can get a tasting of the beers. Casual or dressy dining. Service is spotty."
Cassandra C.,"Camarillo, CA",3,40,,1.0,3/22/2014,Really unimpressed with how the manager handled our mishaps this evening. The restaurant was busy and very little was done to improve our dining experience. After sending our food back 3 times we had to give up on our dinner. I generally like bjs and  am upset this location couldn't compare to other bjs I've been to.
