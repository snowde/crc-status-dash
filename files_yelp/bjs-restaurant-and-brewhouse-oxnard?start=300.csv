Coco B.,"Ventura, CA",0,10,4,5.0,3/31/2015,"Consistently yummy food and great service, both in the bar area and in the restaurant area. Always a game/good variety of stuff to watch on the tvs. Family friendly."
Barbs S.,"Berkeley, CA",80,116,142,2.0,12/16/2013,"This is pretty much as ghetto fancy as you can get, so expect this place to be mediocre. I've been here a couple of times and every single time, the same story repeats itself. 10-15 minute wait, seated, waits 30+ minutes to get food, food barely meets expectations. What fueled me to write this review today, however, was the fact that the customer service was beyond horrendous. A fellow red head (kudos for the awesome hair though girly, did like!) was our waitress and you could just tell by staring into those eyes that girlfriend did not like her job! She was pretty much dead beat cold, did not refill drinks, and barely cracked a smile when she came to ask how we were. Now you may say, ""Barbs, she went to your table girl, what's the beef?!"" Well, my beef was that every time she came, she sounded as if we were forcing her to be there! She did not even bother to fake pretend care about us! Has this girl not heard that if you smile or at least act like you care, you'll get a better tip?! Well now she knows, and by the way, thanks for never coming back with my receipt, that pretty much killed the three stars I was giving this joint. You can get much better ghetto fancy food at CPK or the likes, so stick to going there. Will I be back? Probably, I like torture. Will there be better customer service next time? I sure hope so!"
Gloria P.,"Ventura County, CA",457,297,2549,2.0,11/16/2013,Food was fine except it took about 30 minutes to get our food. I asked our waitress if she could get the tv near our table  switched to a big game my son wanted to watch. We asked her twice and she said it would get done. It never did. Since we were a large party they gave us 2 hours. Before our time limit was over the people that were going to sit at our table once we were done were standing around waiting for us to get up. Why would bj's allow that? It was awkward and they were also standing around other customers at their table. I would not come here again with a large party.
Elan J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",159,44,44,1.0,4/30/2014,A night out with the family became a fiasco by a  terrible waiter . We all didn't get drinks had to ask other servers that weren't even our to bring our drinks even after that person would bring them the ice was melted and my simple Pepsi below par flat very bad . My order calamari and my soup cold my waiter again no one to be found all I wanted to do was tell someone how can you effn do that when no one helps you ... I've been here before and no issues at all very let down no manager at all came I paid my 100$ bill and left
Martin J.,"Irvine, CA",149,106,44,3.0,12/26/2011,"If I can label this review it would be called ""packed""... freakin' packed! My girlfriend, my friend and his girlfriend, and I went to BJs on a Friday night. It was packed... at the waiting section!! The restaurant was absolutely packed. We were told the waiting time would be 45 minutes. 45 minutes isn't bad if there is a bar section to sit down at while waiting. However, their bar area is filled with typical suburbanites who refuse to go to any of the other bars in Oxnard. We were fortunate to find a table by the bar within 20 minutes of being there. It took us 30 minutes to receive our first drink and then another 20 minutes to get our food. The blonde beer I ordered was delicious. The pizza on the other hand had burnt crust and cheese which made it taste like one of those dry pizzas you get from gas stations. I should've asked if they had super unleaded gas and air fresheners.  The best time to go BJs is during the week around 3-7 when the place is less than full and you can actually enjoy the food, beer and service. Since this is my first review of BJs I want to add that experience, if not, I would probably give my last experience two stars."
Suzanne S.,"Sun City West, AZ",0,3,,1.0,2/22/2014,We went for lunch today. I will never go back. The service was not bad it just didn't exist!  We were seated and proceeded to wait 10 minutes for a waiter. No one. They passed us by and waited on People who were seated after us. When we attempted to flag a waitress down and she waived us off. Of course we left. Never to return.
Nathan T.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,6,4.0,2/8/2013,"You must try and you will like the Thin Crust Veggie pizza (under sharable starter), no other restaurants make pizza like that, you will surprise a veggie pizza can be as good as pizza with meat. Also, if you don't need to drive, have the Ultimate Long Island Ice Tea - it's 9 out of 10 in my book."
Rich K.,"Oxnard, CA",66,19,25,5.0,10/3/2012,"BJ's beers are amazing (especially the Jeremiah Red) and the food is great...and who can resist their Pizookie? I haven't ever had a bad experience here. The atmosphere is classy and comfortable, yet casual, and the staff is usually very good."
CheeseSteak A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,65,,4.0,8/19/2012,"Very dependable place to go for a good dinner.  Probably the best restaurant in Oxnard. Get the Rib-Eye.  They make it quite good.  I order it with the mushroom and blue cheese topping which accents the steak's good flavor. While their house specialty is pizza, I was not particulalrly enamoured with it.  A bit too thick-crusted for my tastes. Of course they have numerous choices for beer.  I go for the Lightswitch, a pale light beer that does not overpower the meal. I guess BJ's is fairly similar to Gordon Biersch located in my neck of the woods, but BJ's is better."
Alex M.,"Ventura, CA",1,8,1,1.0,2/22/2014,"The worst restaurant in Ventura County. Do not go to this crappy place, you'll definitely be disappointed. The waiters all need attitude adjustments, the food is over priced and not even that great tasting. Id rather eat my own feces, than eat something prepared here. They need to have more consistency on their waiter-table-assignment, and not give me a new Jo schmo every time I'm given something. Another tip, lighten up a bit and crack a smile, would ya please. You get paid to ""play the part"" and be a good attentive waiter, especially since you rely on tips for a good day of hard work. If you don't, I suggest you bounce. Anyways, don't waste your money here folks."
Kay G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,27,2,1.0,8/29/2014,"So did take out from this location to give them another chance. Never again. Ordered avocado eggrolls, buffalo chicken pizza, and pear salad. When we went to pick it up there was a woman standing at the pick up area. My boyfriend and I walked up and made eye contact with her thinking she was going to help us. The second we got to the register she straight up walked away without saying anything. We walked another five minutes for someone else to come help us. When we got home my salad was hardly a salad. About three leaves of lettuce, two pear slices, and a few crumbles of bleu cheese. It tasted horrible. Seriously, how do you mess up salad? Eggrolls and pizza were both noticeably burnt. We were so hungry we just ate it. Otherwise I would have asked for a refund. Officially never going here again."
Daisy Z.,"Oxnard, CA",0,8,,2.0,3/30/2013,"I've been come here from time to time and I have not had a problem BUT last night our food and WAITRESS really ""Sucked""!  It took 1 1/2 hours to get the main meal and not once did our waitress ""Christine"" come to our table to tell us why it was taking so long.  No sign of her and  we had to flag down another waitress to order more drinks. We finally had our food but no utensils so flag someone else to get them.  I took a bite and touched all the items on the plate where cold ""COLD"".   I had to find her again to take it back all she said ""ohhhh really aww sorry"".  The manager brought the food after hot.  Still no sight of her to get  more drinks. When we got our bill we paid but she said we owed more i told her how if the bills show this amount and she said I will check with my manager.  When she came back she said ohhh I gave you the bill before adding the last item you ordered so this is what is owed ... OK .... Someone needs TRAINING!!!"
Ken R.,"Ventura, CA",45,365,591,1.0,7/21/2013,"Rude waitress, didn't know ice and coffee makes iced coffee, said she'd be right back but she must have fallen off the earth?????? I got the Manager to help and suddenly our waitress appeared again.  Saturday lunch, not busy at all, our server only had a few table.  We got a new server who is much more attentive.  Bent fork prong, hurt my tongue while eating.  What's with BJs????  Very possibly my last visit.  Maybe they're suffering because a Yard House opened nearby??"
Erica G.,"Simi Valley, CA",72,133,55,2.0,6/15/2011,"So unhappy with my experience at BJ's! I really REALLY hope a manager might actually be reading these comments.  1. 35 minute wait.  Ok, I get that we didn't put our name on the list, and that it looks like all of Oxnard came to BJ's for grad dinner. The bar was packed, dining room packed, waiting area packed. Such a huge restaurant, how could it take that long to funnel people through?? 2. Not enough places to sit while waiting for a table. It's bad enough to have a 35 minute wait. Then you don't give them enough room to sit?  3. Our waitress was SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW.  Now I understand why there was such a long wait. We were at that restaurant for 2 hours. Most of it was spent waiting on her to take our order, or bring us our check.  4. Our server took twice as long to bring us our beers since she could barely lift the pitchers. She walked like she was going to fall over at any moment.  5. Waitress hand-off. Who wants to switch waitresses half-way through? The first one was slow, the second wasn't much better because she appeared to have other tables under her watch. Once again, we got ignored.  The saving grace was our food.  The service SUCKED."
J L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,27,,1.0,9/21/2013,"This is the worst BJ's ever. I came with two others for lunch at 1pm. It took about 15 minutes to have our orders taken. Drinks were prompt. The food took 45 minutes to come out and they forgot an entree. To make up for this, they offered a crappy side salad, which we declined. They brought the entree 10 minutes later. The food was good. But having to wait another 20 minutes after eating for the bill was the cherry on top of a crappy experience. I asked for an adjustment on the bill and a few dollars were taken off. The compensation did not make up for the slow service and mistakes made.I will not be back."
Nerissa N.,"Simi Valley, CA",55,37,175,1.0,11/12/2013,"Decided to have lunch here since the Camarillo outlets are a few minutes away. Had the salmon teriyaki w/ veggies, on top of mash potato instead of rice. At the end of my meal I literally felt ill. I mistook it as being overindulgent. Later on in the evening I had full blown food poisoning. Their salmon must have not been fresh. Day 2 and I'm still feeling crappy. Might I add- our waitress had only attended to us 3 times; when we had to order, when she came back to give us our drinks, and when she gave us our tab. The food was delivered by a male manager. So service was sub par. Not coming back here again!"
Jackie B.,"Oxnard, CA",25,66,26,3.0,2/24/2014,"Found self-seating in the bar area, there's usually a long wait for any dining table here. Food was delicious, a little pricey for the quality though. Our server wasn't very friendly, she seemed to just want to get her tables fed and gone which left the bussers to do all of her following up with her tables; she definitely wasn't a team player. Great ambience and decor though!"
Kim V.,"San Diego, CA",214,299,1030,3.0,3/26/2012,"Are looks everything? Not always, BUT sometimes... you just have to go with your gut. I was in Ventura this weekend and was hankering for some Asian food since it's difficult to find in SB. I found 2 places that had solid 4 star ratings on yelp, but when I got to the places, they looked like dingy food court establishments (not naming any names...). Now, while that's fine for a quick meal during the work day, I wanted something more for dinner. After driving back and forth several times, we ended up at BJ's Pizza. We haven't been here in 2+ years, since the last 2 we were in Boston and they aren't in SB (big surprise). We ordered a medium pizza, half BJ's Favorite and half Mediterranean with an Italian Market salad. The bf got their brew of the day and I got their black cherry soda. We finished our meal (as gluttonous as it was), with the Oreo cookie pizookie. (The bf chose it b/c it's the ""only one that had 3 scoops of ice cream"", which is funny since he's not a big dessert person.) The food is always consistent here and I'm a fan of the deep dish, so I enjoyed it. I've never had the soda before and thought it was good, and the bf enjoyed his microbrew. Overall, pretty satisfying dinner considering how much driving we did.  A general tip: you can call ahead for your table."
Emily A.,"Oxnard, CA",0,29,10,1.0,4/8/2014,"Thanks for the food poisoning!!! -_- Next time you're here make sure you check all your meat before eating it or you'll end up miserable like me!  There will not be a next time for me, though."
Philip A.,"Goleta, CA",2,30,,4.0,3/18/2013,A BJ 's is a BJ's when it comes to food but the beers are always great. The service has always been pretty good here and when I know they are going to be busy I always get my name on the call ahead list
