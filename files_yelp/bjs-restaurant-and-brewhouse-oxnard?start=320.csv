Bryan T.,"Camarillo, CA",62,6,,1.0,5/27/2011,Usually I like the food and service at other BJ's chains but trying to make a reservation here was a nightmare. I understand that on Friday evenings things can get pretty hectic and I'm trying to be forgiving of that but my experience with this chain was very disappointing. I called about an hour in advance in order to make a reservation for 10 people and was told by the hostess that in order for any reservations to be made it must be done 30 minutes in advance. So I called 30 minutes later and was told that they could not book reservations for that time since my party was 10 or more. I informed that when I called earlier I was told I had to call 30 minutes before arriving. After expressing my disappointment with being told two different things I was offered to be put on the waitlist for that time slot but that they couldn't guarantee that I would have seats but they would keep me on the list until that time. So to add icing on the cake when I arrived I found out I wasn't even put on the list at all and had to wait just like everyone else to be seated. If you're looking for reliable customer service this might not the best place for you even if the pizzookies are yummy I rather attempt making mine at home
Orland R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,95,52,4.0,2/14/2015,"I can never go wrong here. I had the bacon burger and fries and two blondes. It was busy, but the service was great as always.  The waitress got my order and it came out with 15 minutes."
Ximena R.,"Long Beach, CA",17,75,22,1.0,5/8/2013,"BJ'S!!!! Who do you have running this place???? My grandmothers steak was burnt, her mash potatoes cold after waiting 30 mins. Our waiter was no where to be found. I had to get up 4 times to order simple things. Spoke to a manager, he didn't care we were waiting for ever! This place only gets one star bc their food is good and consistent but their service is terrible. Will not be returning here"
Anne Marie Z.,"Oxnard, CA",443,31,1,5.0,4/10/2014,I love the lunch specials starting at $6.99 from Monday thru Friday. The food and service is great!
T Z.,"Redondo Beach, CA",19,248,50,4.0,3/26/2012,Lunch specials are great.  I liked the shrimp tacos with the salsa.  The avocado sauce was okay. Service was wonderful.
Kevin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,121,3,3.0,2/27/2014,"Was busy night at BJs of course. But things took forever to come out. Food quality was fairly good. But service, not so much."
Jamal T.,"Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands",1,8,,1.0,4/27/2014,Recently ordered BJs for work. Food was cold and disgusting when it arrived.  I can't imagine it tasting any better warm either.  This place makes Applebees feel like a five star dining experience.
Kelli S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,11,1,5.0,3/20/2014,"Most awesome bar service.  Ordered the salmon with rice.  Huge portion of salmon, probably an inch thick, a little under done in the middle, understood given the size.  No problem, cooked it a little more AND took half off.  Did not need to do that.  Great staff, very good management and the food flavor was great.  Highly recommend for beer and quick food.  I always go as a single and sit at the bar.  I wish I could hit it up more.  Love it.  5 ."
Celene A.,"Santa Barbara, CA",4,31,26,5.0,12/11/2011,Service is what gets 5stars 25min wait (sunday night football GO COWBOYS) but they served free slices of pizza while waiting. Food was served fast & tasted great.. Buffalo wings & jerry burst great combo ! Pizza is pretty good and so are the salads..can't complain. Finishing the meal with a pazoooki !
Gustavus B.,"Camarillo, CA",28,58,77,2.0,7/26/2013,Although the BBQ is above average... Our waiter did not provide equal service. Got a pizza order wrong then literally disappeared on us...
Alex O.,"Simi Valley, CA",142,11,,1.0,2/2/2013,Horrible service and staff. Management blamed the staff and the staff blame the management for poor service.
Melissa T.,"Camarillo, CA",3,24,11,5.0,12/26/2013,"Been to this place many times, and it is one of my favorites! Try the pizza, you cant go wrong.  BBQ Chicken Pizza is my favorite.  Spinach artichoke dip is equally as delicious as the stuffed mushrooms, and you cant leave without a chocolate chunk pizzooki!"
Larry M.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/22/2015,"I want to commend Matthew the manager of Oxnard BJ  rest. I also thank the staff that assisted with the beer tasting evening and the representative from the brewery at Cooperstown New York. The presentation, the food, and the beer was absolutely superb. Matt did a great job organizing, the representative and spokesman for Cooperstown New York brewery was wonderful . My thanks for a job well done best wishes, Larry  M."
Ignacio V.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,148,39,3.0,3/6/2011,"So hard to give this place a really bad review. OK, the bad things about BJ's, very corporate, horrible location (strip mall, c'mon), and the people who frequent this are the archetype of Suburbanites. Good things about this restaurant, however bad some of their food is, they do have a big menu. So that's one star right here. Another hard earn star is the simple fact that they brew their own beer, I have to give recognition to that. As sad as that sounds, it is the only brewery in Oxnard, WOW. Beer is also unique! The third star goes for their service. Waiter we had today was awesome, not pretentious what so ever, very friendly, thanks Jeff, you made this restaurant fly tonight. Also one of the few places in Oxnard that is open past 10:30pm, Thanks BJ's for opening my eyes to what I have to do in the next couple of months!"
Ryan C.,"Camarillo, CA",28,26,7,1.0,2/5/2012,"Terrible service. Went there twice. First time waited 30 minutes, they seated the four of us at a booth and highchair seat wouldn't fit. Told us sorry no other tables available. 20 min later we got another table.  Second time there we called ahead and they told us 45-50min. We spend 45 min  walking around keeping our kids distracted then go in to get our table. The kid tells us ""ok here's your pager, it will be another 45-50 minutes""! He said other people called in ahead of you. That makes ZERO sense! Never going there again for some giant cookie."
Samantha H.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",13,59,10,3.0,11/18/2013,"I got BJs delivered. The Mediterranean pizza  was a little undercooked and the avocado eggs rolls were pretty bad. On the other hand, the chicken tortilla bread bowl soup was delicious. The service was also slow, it took them about an hour and 15 min to deliver. However, I don't think bjs is usually this disappointing."
Adam B.,"San Diego, CA",53,131,16,4.0,8/11/2011,"This place is solid... Decent food, good micro brews and cool atmosphere."
Ely m E.,"Ventura, CA",0,29,,2.0,2/28/2015,"Service started out ok. After waiting and waiting and  waiting for a pizza and a pasta entree, our waitress came and told us the manager was coming over because our pizza was taken by a new server,  After more waiting our order came.  I could tell the pasta sat under the food warmer until the 2nd pizza was cooked. It was dry but warm. I wanted to salvage it with some lemon but the server never showed again. Had to summon another server after 1/2 the pasta was eaten. Had to wait and wait again and summon another server for our check and comp'd dessert from the manager. No incentive to come back here.  Poor service!!"
Don M.,"Oxnard, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/23/2015,I had went this location on 2/22/15 with my partner and the service and timeliness was very disappointing! We arrived at around 9p and still had not received our order by 9:50p! It left us with a horrible experience and WILL NOT be returning!
Full T.,"Edwards, CO",2,33,14,3.0,12/8/2013,"Great food, had the black & blu flatbread pizza. Super gluten free menu as well. Mgr wouldn't  honor Google or Yelp coupons. So much for social media"
