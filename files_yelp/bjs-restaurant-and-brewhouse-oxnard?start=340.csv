Chris I.,"Ventura, CA",0,21,,2.0,2/21/2013,"Beer:  House stuff is not great. If they have a good outside IPA (Green Flash, Union Jack), it's bearable.   Food:  Mediocre for the price.  Nothing special, just enough to fill the belly for the drive home.   Service - POOR:  Table service at the bar is horrendous.  They just ignore me or give me a look when I try to flag wait staff.  When I grab a beer at the bar, our waitresses gives me shit.  They warm up as we get our bill to improve their tip potential.  This happens to me 50% of my visits.  The only reason I go here is because some friends like this place (they get better service...more tolerant perhaps).  Maybe I'm just an intolerant asshole.  Or maybe it's the only decent place in Oxnard and the wait staff don't have to work too hard.   Wait till Yardhouse opens up across the 101."
Red W.,"Ventura, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/2/2013,"We went to BJ's this afternoon for lunch not really expecting much as it is a chain, but we did expect better than we got. We agreed that the restrooms were clean, but that's pretty much where it ended.  Our table wasn't cleaned and though our waitress arrived soon after we were seated and brought us our drinks and took our orders, that was the last we heard from her for for over 40 minutes. It wasn't that she was gone from the area, but ignoring us, not stopping by and asking if we wanted more tea or to say our order was coming right out, nothing. On top of this they were running the air and it was freezing in there, on a day when the outside temp was 60.  Finally some one else brought our order out. To call the food sub par would be a compliment. McDonald's would have been better all around. The service, amateur, the food, bad, needless to say, my wife and I won't be back."
Roderick S.,"Milpitas, CA",23,69,12,4.0,6/6/2013,"Been going to this place since they first opened up. Although they no longer brew their signature beers in house this place is still top notch. Service is always something I pay particular attention to when I dine out and I must say they do a good job here with their hiring and/or training process. Other than a few times when with a large group late at night the servers and hostesses and bussers have always been efficient and courteous. They know their menu and are willing to please. Great food paired with exceptional service makes this my go to restaurant whenever I am in town. I especially enjoy the California burger but substitute the meat patty for a veggie patty. A little weird at first but soooooo good! Also, their Pomegranate Sunrise mixed drink is delicious. They're so tasty you won't even notice you've had three too many :)"
Hilda P.,"Oxnard, CA",0,22,2,4.0,11/1/2013,"Food is always great here as are the beers. I wish I could say the same for the hostess service, Joanna at the front is horrible. We almost left but with two hungry kids we stayed and had great service from our waitress."
Noel C.,"Camarillo, CA",59,52,7,1.0,9/9/2010,"I HATE THIS PLACE, the food is great but thats about it.  I haven't been to this place in two years do to HORRIBLE service. Yes the food is great but bad service leaves a bad impression so no matter how good the food is the service tarnishes everything else. I wont go here for drinks or anything not even for families b-day.  Also you have to worry about stupid dumb asses who cant go a night without turning an argument  into a fight. I hate the fact that I have to watch out what I do or say because some dumb ass wanabee homie cant seem to get over the fact that they are not in high school anymore and resorts to violence. This place is sad and pathetic by no fault of its own but by the stupid customers (and  workers) who ruined this location. I have never had or seem the problems that plague this location at any of the other bj locations in LA."
Shannon C.,"Carlsbad, CA",252,472,762,4.0,6/9/2011,"For a sunday night, it was really busy. Oh, and there was a game on TV so that's probably why. We waited about 15 minutes for our table but when we were seated the waiter was extremely nice, and funny. I think his name may have been Devin? Either way our meal was great and the service was above par.  We ordered (and really enjoyed): Avocado Eggrolls Turkey Club Sandwich Tomato Bisque soup"
Rainier C.,"Moorpark, CA",9,37,12,2.0,11/12/2013,"I ordered the cajun pasta with chicken to go and I must say, you will not get the same portion you will see on their menu.  Although, it was very delicious!"
Janet C.,"Ventura, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/13/2015,"I love Bj's food, usually but their delivery service is awful. Ordered bison burger with sauce on side, no sauces, bun was dry, I threw it out.  The saving Grace was their watermelon salad. That is why I give one star for delivery."
Lauren S.,"Camarillo, CA",5,37,1,1.0,10/8/2012,"Attempted to go to the Oxnard BJ's for my daughters birthday (her choice). Called ahead to be put on a list knowing that on a Friday night it was going to be packed. We were told that the wait would be about forty five minutes (even after calling ahead.) Arrived and checked in. And sat. And sat. And sat. For over an hour and a half, we sat. Finally went to the front and asked where we were at on the list, and we were nowhere near the top.  Why it is that anyone would wait ANYWHERE on the earth for sub-par food for over a half hour is beyond me. Im angry that we werent notified that it was going to take longer than the originally quoted time so that we could be given the choice to wait or not. Pizookies are great and everything, but for real. Im not at all pleased that I spent my daughters thirteenth birthday on the bench in front of the BJ's in Oxnard. Its just not THAT good."
Susanna A.,"Santa Maria, CA",24,78,13,5.0,10/15/2012,"We always stop here any time we pass by Oxnard. I love the mozzarella and tomato salad perfect appetizer and the best part it's only $2. I also love the shrimp lettuce wraps delicious, light and tasty. Of course the beer is the best part. I personally love the hefeweizen , my husband loves a darker beer like the nutty brunette."
Ingrid H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",34,69,92,1.0,1/12/2013,"Very poor service.  Slow as molasses. Order came out and my hubby's was wrong. Manager took care of the tab and the waiter apologized; which we appreciate. But I just got the feeling that the subpar service was business as usual, thus the 1 star rating."
Manuel V.,"Oxnard, CA",199,48,9,3.0,11/19/2010,"This place is a staple of Oxnard, one of its' core restaurants as you can tell if you frequent this place anytime on a weekend evening.  I've visited this place a few times for food and drinks. Their food is ok. Its honestly nothing special. Their pizza is good but not great. I can easily point to Toppers or Dominck's as having much better pizza. Their pasta is mediocre. Their avocado rolls I do like.  One of the strong points of this place is its' large selection of beers (naturally since it is a brewhouse). The problem is that it is not the best place to have drinks with friends, even in the bar area. They have good selection but the setup of the locale doesn't invite for an atmosphere of relaxed socialization. It is mainly a restaurant after all.  In conclusion this place is ok, but I don't think the large number of people justify the quality of this place, probably just a thing of habit to come to this place."
Frank S.,"Camarillo, CA",1,26,2,4.0,2/9/2014,"Stopped by today and had the Black and Bleu flatbread. It was awesome. We sat in the bar area and although it was busy, our server was attentive. I like that the noise level is down so you can actually carry on a conversation. The menu can take you from light to carnivore as there is quite the variety of food selection. I also like the large TV and surrounding smaller TV's so you can see from every angle. My wife had the LightSwitch beer which she will surely order the next time we stop by."
D I.,"Ventura, CA",108,77,,3.0,2/6/2014,"I'd say this place is okay. Just okay. I've probably had 1 memorable server which is quite sad for how many times I've gone here. Seems that the servers just want to get through their shift and are just looking forward to their tip. Experience within the food industry, I'd say I'm NOT one hard to please when it comes to eating out, but this place makes me think twice about tipping to be honest.  Hint: Never say no to dessert, pizookies will always win."
Jay I.,"Camarillo, CA",6,20,1,1.0,11/13/2014,"I ordered 2 fish tacos while everyone else ordered a plate meal, everyone was almost done when my tacos came out I told the waiter I didn't want them anymore. The manager came and said it was on the house but I ended up leavin them there because I was so mad. And they still charged me for my soda instead"
Ready R.,"Oxnard, CA",36,4,,3.0,11/4/2013,"Nice looking place but the food is sub par.  Service is usually decent but there is often a wait to get a table.  Have not been impressed with the food except for the chili and the Pizookie.  The Pizookie is amazing, I just wish there were other reasons to go.  I tried a couple of the beers and did not like them at all.  Overall just a sit down corporate fast food place."
Matty C.,"Camarillo, CA",76,33,3,3.0,8/7/2013,"I had the Cobb Salad and it was excellent. Buddy had the lunch salad and sandwich. Very good price on both. Service and follow up not great, but I can't complain about the quality of food."
Don N.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,28,,4.0,8/7/2013,I went for a late lunch about 2:00 on a Tuesday. It was not near packed but fairly busy for a weekday afternoon. We had a sampler appetizer plate that was excellent. I had a quesadilla which was OK  but the chicken was rubbery. We all had those enormous cookie things with ice cream and it was so rich I had to go home and take an extra Lipitor. All in all I liked it.
Jenn C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",509,659,640,3.0,2/22/2011,"santa fe salad, lettuce wraps, and bbq chicken pizza.  lots of flavor, fresh and crunchy vegetables, yummy pizza. the pizookie is delicious and lives up to the hype.  how amazing is a freshly baked cookie with cold ice cream on top?  I would recommend getting the bbq chicken if you don't like trying new things and you want to stay on the safer side.  The buffalo chicken pizza is awesome.  the tang of the sauce is what makes the pizza mouth-watering.  the great white is also a popular choice.. but its REALLY heavy.. like 1/2 a slice and you're full"
David W.,"Ventura, CA",148,26,10,4.0,9/19/2013,A little pricey for what you get.  Very good food and service.  Gets very busy at peak hours.  Fairly large bar area.
