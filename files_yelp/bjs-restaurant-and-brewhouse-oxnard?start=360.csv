Heather W.,"Bakersfield, CA",204,50,48,4.0,1/24/2011,"The service can be hit or miss sometimes, but mostly it's a hit. The food is consistent and good. For the price my favorite is their lunch portions. Either a Red or Blond beer with most of their meals is good. By far my favorite is their Pizzookie! In almost all the flavors~"
Robert F.,"Ventura, CA",0,8,,5.0,12/25/2014,"I've eaten at this particular BJ's regularly for many years.  Was in there 12/22 and it was as good as always.  If you're looking for a comfortable brew pub with a good selection of beers and wide variety of food this is a good place to go.  The ribs are excellent as are many of the appetizers.  This is not fine dining, it's a good restaurant and sports bar.  In response to some of the other comments on this forum it's worth mentioning that they close most nights at midnight and at their busiest times service can be slower.  But for us overall service has been quite good and they've always been friendly and welcoming."
Rob B.,"Oxnard, CA",0,38,1,3.0,10/4/2014,"Just meh. This has been my experience on numerous occasions. I never actually pick this restaurant to go to, but only go if someone else wants to go there and I don't want to offend them. For MUCH better food and service for slightly less money, try the Lazy Dog at The Collection. You will thank me."
Paul P.,"Round Rock, TX",166,178,9,4.0,2/5/2011,I've been here many times. It's always packed but if you don't mind the wait you won't be disappointed. Food is excellent and service is great. My only gripe (besides the waiting time) is that food could be cheaper. It does get a bit noisy but it doubles as a sports bar. I love sports so I don't really mind all the extra stuff going on. Too bad BJs didn't think to make the place bigger.
Joy E.,"Goleta, CA",24,64,1,3.0,2/18/2013,"We had a hit-and-miss experience ordering off the menu here. This is one of those places that is good for picky eaters (large, diverse menu) and not so good for the indecisive (large, diverse menu). The beer was alright, the potato skins were terrible (deep friend!? gross!), the tomato bisque was greasy (ewww!), but both the sirloin and the grilled pork chops were better than expected hence the 3 stars instead of just 2. Not great, not bad."
Meesh D.,"Moorpark, CA",112,149,28,4.0,2/2/2011,"Actually had a really nice hour just having a drink with my  friend.  The bartender was really great... poured a huge drink. Couldn't drink it, it was so big.  When I spilled it, he offered me  a new one at no cost.  Fast service.  Loud, but that is expected  there.  Was clean and busy.  Good overall."
Rey E.,"Oxnard, CA",87,125,364,3.0,11/14/2010,"This place has good food, just like any other BJ's. I like how they brew their own beer. Customer service is pretty good to OK. Partys of 10 or more are held out in their outdoor heated patio. They have a good amount of TVs so you can watch sports while eating."
Mira S.,"Westlake Village, CA",9,58,115,4.0,6/17/2013,"We went there yesterday for Father's Day and they were able to get us a table in 15 minutes.  We appreciated that.  The beer here is awesome, fresh, tasty, and, did I say awesome?  The pizza is really good, too. They changed the menu a few months ago, and now they charge dinner prices for lunch on the weekend.  We ordered our usuals to find out one of the portions was more expensive by a $5.  The menu showed that in small writing, but because we were so familiar with the menu, we did not take the time to read it over.  They were OK to adjust the price for that portion, and now we know to be careful of what we order on the weekend.  We had a great time and are planning to go back."
l m.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,2,4.0,8/17/2014,"Delicious beer and American fare with friendly service. Sit at the bar for best service, no wait and great TV variety"
Todd O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",134,510,49,4.0,10/24/2010,"I am totally going out on limb after reading all the other reviews but my experience was that good. First, you won't catch me anywhere after 4pm that serves alcohol in Oxnard...its a rule and I'm happy with it! With that said, my Saturday afternoon experience was perfect.  I can't give a chain 5 stars AND the phucing place was so cold and we said something twice and we got nothing. The answer is NOT, ""funny, when I started working here I thought it was so cold then when I'm running around serving people I get hot.""  GREAT, the employees are comfortable as I the paying customer can't feel his nose are ears. Other than that, my man Bobby was ON IT.  He was a great server in terms of personality and service! We were were there for college football happy hour.  The prices were great, multiple games on, beers never empty and great food.  I said it, ""great food"".  I know its a chain and worse, its BJs.  We had calamari twice after that at 2 different seafood restaurants and it wasn't even close.  The calamari was not fishy and NOT at all rubbery.  It was super fresh with a light breading that complimented the calamari perfectly.  The lemon aoli  was downright delicious as was the spicy marinara.  We also got a personal pizza that was excellent, really light and airy crust with a light butter bottom to the crust and a perfect balance of sauce cheese and toppings."
Toni J.,"Camarillo, CA",0,9,22,3.0,6/30/2012,"I have been to bj's many times and know what to expect when I go there but this trip was seriously disappointing. Having to wait 20 min. In between your beer at a so called ""brew house"" is sad. If I'm a restaurant owner and Im aware that if I keep a Paton waiting as long to receive a beer than it takes to consume it, i have lost revenue! Sad...."
Erica R.,"Oxnard, CA",76,7,,4.0,5/11/2013,I went about a month ago and Im not kidding you I waited for half an hour and no one showed up to my table I was upset so I left. I went to have dinner last night and had the best customer service ever! Our waitress was very friendly and very attentive throughtout the night. I was relieved thinking we would have horrible customer service but that wasnt the case. The BBQ Chopped Salad is my favorite! Love this place!
Deborah C.,"San Francisco, CA",181,173,282,3.0,7/31/2010,"Let's go to BJ's!  B/c it is a good place to meet up with friends to consume average tasting food.     I have to mention how BJ's reminds me of a place where you come here after a high school dance because it was the ""cool"" place to go to.   Now, it is a well-known place to hang out and do some social drinking.  They have a decent selection of beers and cocktails and also encourage you to chill out!   Good place to watch sports. Friendly waiter service. Warm Atmosphere.  Type of food:   Burgers, pizza, grilled chicken Dessert:  GET THE PIZOOKIE TRIO!  Come here if you have no where else to go in Oxnard!"
Kimberly C.,"San Diego, CA",19,147,10,1.0,12/15/2010,"Per my mothers request, we came here... yet again. *Rolls Eyes* We got there at 4:45pm and were told we would need to wait about 5-10 minutes. Fine, no worries. Oh, BTW, Give me a booth this time.  We waited over 25 minutes to be sat in a maybe half full restaurant. Our server took FOREVER to get to us! Maybe this wasn't her fault, but managements fault for not having enough staff or whatever, but they could have stepped in at any point to take a drink order.  I was excited that they 'claimed' to have their own Oktoberfest beer. My favorite beer by far where ever I go and can find it. I  swear on kittens and puppies that it was Fat Tire. My husband and I were both disgusted by it. I couldn't drink it. Service was so slow that it put a bad taste in my mouth, or was that the beer?  Oh, wait.. good news!!!! We finally got a booth!"
Sabrina F.,"Moorpark, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/7/2014,My husband and I had dinner here last night. Wasn't impressed. Service was horrible. The food was cold and not very good. Probably won't go back.
P D.,"Encino, CA",0,37,3,1.0,3/22/2015,"Very disappointed. I ordered online for curbside pickup, when I arrived I called in to let them know I was there. I was told my order wasn't up yet but that they would come get my payment. They bought out the food for the car next to me, and then a car after me. When I realized I'd been sitting there for 15 mins I decided to pay with the mobile app because I had someplace I needed to be. That was the trigger for my food. They called to ask if I was coming... I told them I'd been sitting outside for 20 mins. She asked my car... I told her... She said they wrote down something else. She brought my food and I realized there was no parmesan or plastic ware. So I had to go in... I mentioned that I hoped that my food was not cold to which I was told ""it just came out"".. Famous last words. Not only was my food cold, the pizza dough was not completely cooked! I also found what is worse than McDonald's cold fries -- cold BJ'S corn fritters - yuck!! This was the second and last time I stop at this BJ'S."
Elizabeth R.,"Ventura, CA",86,74,5,3.0,8/27/2012,"I would not choose to go here for dinner, but my girlfriends and I do enjoy happy hour after work. Okay beer, okay appetizers. I would not say the beer or the food is the best I have had, but it's not the worst. Will continue to go back for happy hour."
Kathryn B.,"Avondale, AZ",1,57,3,4.0,5/23/2012,"I'm not particularly crazy about the food at BJ's.  So why do we end up there?    Here's some reasons:  BJ's in Oxnard has a great menu.  Servers are friendly.  There's often a wait, but if you're willing to sit in the bar you can usually find an available booth or table.  BJ's has a great energ.  I like that I can get a Guinness on tap.  They have a fun beer sampler too.  The appetizers are delicious.  My family likes the avocado rolls and calamari.   My husband and sons love the cheeseburger pizza and my daughter gets the French dip sandwich every time.  They have a new burger, the cripsy jalapeno, which I understand is very good.    That pretty much sums it up!  So, we end up there where I can happily drink a glass of Guinness and enjoy a good appetizer and salad.  Oh, if you have room get the pizookie to share!  Tip for travelers:  BJ's is right off of the 101 at the Oxnard Blvd exit.  It's across from Home Depot."
Richie B.,"Ventura, CA",3,51,,4.0,8/23/2012,"The best pizza I have ever had anywhere! I can't even eat fast food pizza anymore! I have had lots of different pizzas and BJ's is just amazing. The only thing that comes close is Numero Uno (which is now gone sadly). I haven't had any of their other food yet because its really overpriced, but man that pizza is amazing!"
Candace R.,"San Francisco, CA",135,550,30,3.0,6/1/2010,"Oh the memories.  During my time in high school, BJs was the place to go after EVERYTHING. Competition, concert, dance, you name it, we were at BJs shortly after. So when I showed up for the first time in a few years this weekend, I was pleasantly surprised that they changed the layout inside, it definitely opened it up, plus there's a HUGE flat screen at the bar now.  We came in the middle of the LA vs PHX came, so there was a wait but we were whatever. Eventually we got our booth and got nestled in. Jon and I ordered beers, I got the Berry Burst which was amazing. It felt like a flower & berry garden in my mouth. Very refreshing. Our table shared the piranha nachos, and for my meal I got the turkey burger (classic, as recommended by the waiter), and for dessert we shared a pizookie, half wcm, half pb. Bomb."
