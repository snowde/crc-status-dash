M H.,"Ventura, CA",70,44,8,5.0,8/28/2014,"Every time I come here, I'm happy. They have gluten-free options for pizza and pasta, which I appreciate. I love to get their gluten-free pizza and a black cherry soda (the ones they make in-house that come with unlimited refills). The staff is always friendly. I even broke a glass the last time I went there and they were really nice about it, even though I felt really bad... The service isn't lightning-fast, but you won't get ignored. If you have a couple hours, this is a good place to have a long lunch and relax."
Carlos M.,"Santa Paula, CA",0,4,1,3.0,1/13/2013,"Had dinner with 9 of my friend last night, and the food was great, but the service was slow and the waiter looked like he didn't like wait on us or didn't like what he was doing, and the men's restroom need some TLC, bad. Will think about coming back but that would be a task, with so many other restaurant in Ventura to go to."
Stacey P.,"Ventura, CA",17,157,65,5.0,8/1/2010,The first time I ate here I wasn't that impressed. The second time was a few days ago for a friend's birthday and I have changed my mind about this place.  No doubt about it it's crowded on a Friday night and you will have to wait awhile for a table. The food however and the service was fast for us. We only had two waitresses for our two huge tables but they served us fabulously.  I ordered the baked potato without bacon and when they brought it to my table it did have bacon on it and I originally thought it might be for someone else at our table so I told the waitress I didn't think it was mine. When it was figured out that the potato was mine I offered to take it anyway but the waitress insisted she give me the right potato and came a few minutes later with a baconless potato. Super awesome in my opinion. The pizookie is to die for. At first I was trying to eat all the ice cream before it melted but after failing I realized the melted ice cream was drenching the cookie underneath and it turned into this amazing warm chocolaty sludge that was out of this world. I almost ate the entire thing myself. I will return just for the pizookie alone!
Priscilla J.,"Camarillo, CA",14,21,2,5.0,7/21/2012,Great food! I ate here with my family and I loved it. Their tortilla soup tastes delicious!
Mike S.,"Ventura, CA",5,77,4,4.0,8/30/2012,I love taking customers here and meeting folks for lunch.  Deep menue has something for everyone.  I've eaten here probably 30+ times and can only remember one issue with my lunch (the chilli side was bad but the entree was fine).  Service is typically fast.
Lynn N.,"Camarillo, CA",209,91,35,4.0,8/17/2011,Yay happy hour! I just went here for their late night happy hour- 1/2 off mini pizzas an 1/2 off glasses and bottles of wine! The chicken wings were pretty good too!
Kathleen M.,"Camarillo, CA",1,10,,3.0,8/13/2014,Food was good but service not so much. Could not understand why we had to wait so long to be seated. Lots of open tables. Down hill from there.
Adam G.,"Placentia, CA",0,60,6,2.0,5/12/2012,"Overpriced, crowded, and mediocre service. Other than that the food was pretty good.  This place must really benefit from the fact that there are not many other restaurants nearby."
Gordon P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",7,14,,5.0,12/1/2012,"Went for lunch today. When were having some issues with the service, I approached the manager. Once I explained why I was not satisfied, he was extremely receptive and fixed the problem right away. He then offered us a couple of items for free/discount to make up for it. The reason I stopped by yelp to give them a 5 star review is really because the server, I think her name was Desiree, came back after all the complaints and gave us stellar service. Most servers would have given us the cold shoulder after that. I left the restaurant with a great feelings. The two of them definitely saved a customer! Thanks."
Convey R.,"Oxnard, CA",54,285,37,1.0,6/2/2011,"I like to order French dip sandwiches with shoestring fries and buffalo chicken pizza. However, I have learned that the wait staff spits on food. One of my sister's friends is going around bragging about it."
F C.,"Ventura, CA",0,8,,2.0,2/11/2013,"Good food !  Slow service :-(  empty tables, people waiting for 20 minutes ????"
Justin L.,"Arlington, VA",19,293,4,4.0,4/26/2012,"Rather good, I thought, even if you get the sense it might be the only show in town? I wasn't blown away by any of their own beers (yes, I tried them all) but the food was above expectation and the service was rock solid. It was quite busy, but we didn't have to wait long. Gigantic TVs for sports, if you're into that sort of thing. Prices were fine."
Michael W.,"Alexandria, VA",12,56,2,4.0,6/29/2012,Good beer selection. Great food variety with calories listed for the health minded. Had the chicken a la fresca - very tasty and filling - topped in at 530 calories. Of course the hop storm IPA was nearly as much.  Check this place out - tvs for all my sports as well.
Mike V.,"Oxnard, CA",37,58,,4.0,5/10/2010,"Consistently good food, I have tried at least 10 things on the menu, and enjoyed all of them. They make their own beer, and 3 out of the 4 I tried were pretty good. Servers are usually pretty nice and attentive.  Only problem is that they are always really crowded from like 5 to 8.  So expect a long wait time and a small hit to service during those hours.   I like the wedge salad, but i don't like blue cheese so i ask for ranch instead with no blue cheese crumbles.  Chicken fried steak is pretty damn good! Pizza's are great too.  Wife loves the Pizzoki a bit too sweat for me."
S S.,"Ventura, CA",1,41,6,3.0,8/1/2012,"Decent consistent brewhouse, brewpub. 3:00 happy hour specials are the reason to go."
Jennifer T.,"Livermore, CA",86,38,,1.0,8/8/2013,"Sadly, this BJs hardly lives up the what I've come to expect from this chain, since I really like the ones in Modesto and Stockton.  Was traveling through with a friend and figured with was a safe dinner option. I will give it credit where due - the food was excellent.  Service was another matter.  After being seated, we waited. And waited. And probably should have taken the hint and left except it was late evening and we didn't know the area.  Finally, server came over all sappy and ingratiating (I hate suck up waiters.  If they do their job well, they don't need to be schmoozy) finally got us water and we ordered major dinner items. Appetizer came out cold - maybe an issue with the kitchen, but I suspect more an issue of the waiter being seriously ADHD and not focused on ANYTHING. Never checked on us once food came out.  Had to set beverage glasses on table's edge in that HINT HINT PLEASE FILL US gesture to get them refilled only once.  When we had finished eating, we sat and waited, and waited, and waited, for any acknowledgement that we were done and could be asked about dessert, or better yet, a check provided.  Neither. Finally I walked up to the front bearing both my and my friend's Visas and asked to pay.  Was stared at blankly until a manager or at least higher up staff member ran over and said she'd take care of it.  Explained we were ready to pay, handed her cards and returned to my table.  5+ minutes later, server shows up acting all hurt and confused that he was handed our credit cards and asks if we want dessert.  (Curiously, we didn't order dessert).  It then took another short eternity to get the receipts back to sign and cards returned to us.   My suggestion if you really want to go - get their carside to go... all the delicious food and (hopefully) none of the server baloney."
Dickie R.,"Oxnard, CA",117,60,14,4.0,3/31/2012,Great Sandwiches Here! My Favorite Is The Grilled Chicken Club! :)
Ariana G.,"Ventura, CA",0,13,8,5.0,5/15/2015,"I have only eaten here twice and I swear I should go more because this place is not only nice to have if you're having fancy dinner or you're going out with some friends and even if it's for a birthday party. The food here is really good and the dessert is delicious. I recommend trying it out if you have never been there drinks are so good and I have always had a good experience here. For instants as I was parking in the parking lot I had gotten out and realized there was an iPhone sitting on top of someone else's car but I parked next to, so I took it. Of course I was going to return it once someone had called. As I was in the restaurant of course the phone is ringing so I answered it and it turned out to be one of the employees. She was so happy to see she got her phone back and was so kind to buy me and my friends dessert for returning her phone. Besides that all of the people that were there working that night were kind from the beginning. It's a great atmosphere fun to eat at and a good experience."
Renee S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/27/2015,"We went to BJs in Oxnard on a Saturday evening. We waited about ten minutes to be seated, which I was very surprised. Normally, their waiting times are very long in the evenings.. Gina was our waitress, she was very prompt with introducing herself and asking us what we want to drink, from there the service took a turn for the worse!! We ordered our food about 10mins later, then we waited about 20mins and she comes by asking if they brought us out our ticket? I advised her honey we haven't even received our dinner.. She replies with, she was confused and she will go speak to the kitchen manager, as she walks away, my boyfriend and I are looking like what's wrong w her, we see a bussed bringing our food out  she passed her up going to the kitchen. I believe Gina was physically at work but mentally somewhere else! She returned, apologizes, ask if we need anything, I asked for Parmesan Cheese for my daughters spaghetti, we never received it. I cut her noodles for her and my daughter ate all of her dinner, she was hungry after our long wait for our food and she had been asking for spaghetti since the night before. I needed a1 sauce food my steak, I could never get her attention as she was very busy w attending to all the other newly seated customers getting them started, she forgot about tending to her other tables. So I got any bussed attention I could and received my a1 sauce. Our drinks were empty and we were asked about refills about ten minutes after our dinner was eaten.. Very terrible service tonight! I'm in no hurry to visit this branch anytime soon or the remainder of this year!! Gina take a couple of days off honey!!"
Roxy B.,"Ventura, CA",63,51,70,2.0,7/4/2011,"You gave me food poisoning on two separate visits. Once was with a chicken sandwich and the other was with the turkey cobb salad. You do have tasty food that appeals to the average american, but please, check your food standards as I have chosen to stay away from this restaurant because the memories of being so sick are very fresh in my mind..."
