Pam L.,"San Diego, CA",153,27,4,3.0,9/10/2017,"Been going to several around in my travels. For a Sunday night this one was busy but not too crazy to have to wait so long for food or dessert. As I ordered dessert, with a pile of ""done dishes"" in front of me - he folded up his iPad and left the dishes!!!??? Say what? I think the waiters get distracted by football. Service was fair. Good was good."
Cory S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Called before since we had a party of 9. BJs put our name in and advised that it would be 15 minutes. We get there 5 minutes after the call and BJs said it would be 30 to 45 minutes, I asked why did we waste the call ahead and the host replied they would seat is asap.  We sit down.  Had to wait 10 minutes before the waitress took our drink and appetizer order.  The margaritas were weak.  The spinach dip was frozen in the middle (they tried 3 times and we had to cancel it). The service was slow due to our waitress going home (understandable BUT this was around 8pm). No apologies provided.  Will not be going again. There are alot of different options around the vicinity that have better service."
Tyler L.,"Oxnard, CA",2,6,,5.0,2/23/2017,"I've come here many times since it's opened and have never once had a bad experience. At busier times, the service can slow down quite a bit but that's to be expected. I came with my girlfriend last night for dinner and once again an amazing experience. Our server Chris was awesome to be helped by and was always quick to help. The food did take a little while to get out but was wayyyy worth the wait! Atmosphere is great, super comfortable feel to it. I will continue to come back as long as it is here. Ignore the bad reviews on here, people like to complain when it's bad but never take the time to praise when it's good!"
Brett C.,"Oxnard, CA",131,140,12,5.0,12/22/2016,"One of the better BJ's I've been to.  Bar staff is always on top of things and I love being able to pay with the app.  Happy hour specials are really good, love the Sriracha Queso Dip!  You can also get beer to go from the cooler."
Lea L.,"Oxnard, CA",56,95,848,3.0,1/4/2016,"Came on a Sunday 1/3/16 to celebrate the NY w/ some friends. It was packed, people where waiting outside in the cold. Behind the cash register is the bar area (no line, self seating). But since there were no open tables or booths in bar area, we just sat at the bar, got a beer & waited about 15-20 minutes for people to leave a table (seats 6, tight squeeze for 7/8).  Sunday Game day! so glad it was happy hour. $1 off certain beer & 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas all while watching, NFL to NBA (lotsa sports going on). Good beer & yummy deep dish pizza.. Woohoo! Im so there!! Lols  Food is grub. Different beers, wine & mixed drinks. Service is good. & Don't forget to leave room for dessert. You Gotta try a Pizookie (pizza cookie) soo yummy! :)"
Maria M.,"San Fernando, CA",20,11,1,1.0,9/11/2017,Terrible customer service. The waiter handed my son a hot plate with no warning and he burned his hand. The waiter did nothing to assist even though he saw that my son burned his hand and even dropped his food on the booth bench. No assistance or concern at all. I will NEVER come back here again!! Not to mention the he saw the food fall and he didn't even offer to bring him a new plate. He just stood there and watched my son pick up the food then walked away. Worst customer service ever!!
Talynn P.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,17,32,2.0,7/17/2017,"Although I enjoy the avocado egg rolls and their beers, this location always seems to have issues with service. I don't understand how a server can have such a hard time, since they don't even have to worry about bringing out the food because they have food runners. Such a disappointment again!"
Marvelous M.,"Oxnard, CA",1,20,,5.0,8/6/2017,"I been going to this bjs for years and the service has always been attentive and nice. The food is always on point and the restaurant can get busy, depends on the day. All the employees are outgoing and quick on there feet. I'll keep coming back to this bjs. Love the wings and calamari!!!!"
Shannon G.,"Garden Grove, CA",7,16,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Stopped for dinner on my way back to Orange County with my 1 1/2 year old daughter. They did not have any seating to accommodate high chairs but could put us in a booth with a booster seat (what?!). Ok. It was downhill from there. Once we were seated no one acknowledged us for at least 25 - 30 minutes when we had to ask for our waiter. All sodas were served without ice (what?). Waiter came back to our table 1 time during the entire meal to refill drinks. Smh. Bad service. Bad management. Next time I will spend the extra 10 min to drive to the Lazy Dog Cafe where I am sure the service is better. Management should pay attention to these yelp complaints. Has I yelped it before I stopped, I would not have stopped. Won't go back."
Darcy L.,"Camarillo, CA",125,3,,4.0,11/1/2017,"This is pretty much my favorite restaurant. I go there for almost every celebration. Their avocado eggrolls are amazing. If you go there you must try them!! There Parmesan crusted chicken is by far the best dish, Along with their chicken Alfredo. if you're a beer person this is the place to go, they brew their own beers so there is something for everyone. And last but not least their pizookies are a must. It's a warm cookie with ice cream on top. They have a variety of different cookies, my personal favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla bean ice cream! I am making myself hungry just writing this review! they also used to have an awesome happy hour where it went on as long as the NFL game was on. And it was half off appetizers and I believe five dollar martinis. They changed the prices for the happy hour, it is now $2 off appetizers so it is not the best I wish they would bring it back to half off appetizers. My boyfriend and I would go at least twice a week until they change the prices then it got to be a little too pricey to go that often. I would give them 5 stars if the happy hour was priced a little better."
Kate B.,"Ventura, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/14/2017,"I've ate at bjs in west lake before and it's like eating in two totally different restaurants. The service was extremely slow and awkward. Went from one waiter to the next with no noticeable difference in their poor knowledge of the menu. First server recommended a house beer, liquid trash. Came for a friends birthday she got an uncooked cookie blob with melted ice cream. Wow thanks for the subpar effort."
Javier J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",622,448,499,3.0,6/6/2015,"The last time I came here before this past Saturday..well I was still a teenager and watching the Lakers vs. Celtics in the NBA finals.. Let's fast forward 7 years and we now have me ordering alcoholic drinks and the Lakers with a lottery pick in this years draft..my my how times have changed I called ahead of time for a table, which they allow you to do for parties less than 8..and I asked for a booth for 2..caller beware as this place has 2 person booths..so if you wants a large booth make sure you specify. I had read the reviews, so when I walked in to non smiling faces I wasn't surprised..hostess boy was probably the nicer out of the 3 in the front. Smile a bit and be happy you're not working across the stop sign frying fries all day. (-) After being sat I got my own first smile in there after realizing that they show Dodgers games there..if you're a fan you know how rare that is to find north of LA. So grateful to watch the win that night. Within a minute or two ""Sean L."" (receipt description) presented himself as our waiter. That guy came through and honestly put the people in the front to shame. He was consistent throughout the night and never seemed bothered at my more than handful requests..young guy too which was more impressive as he was giving up his saturday night at work and just did it with smiles. The only time fluke was when he was applying a discount but only because of him needing supervisor approval..when he came back he even apologized for the delay..couldn't have asked for a better table experience service wise. 5/5 Food: Wings:  Chicken wasn't bad and the sauces were okay. Tasted very tyson like but these came through enough while I watched Joc Pederson at bat. 2.7/5 Salad: Spent my side salad doing scoliosis checks because it had nothing but lettuce spines..dry taste..ate it but not delightfully. 1.5/5 Pizza: Good pizza, not too cheesy which is perfect for me..the toppings tasted were an upgrade above the ones had at pizza rev the day before and the fluffiness to it was nice. It could have been cooked just a tiny more to give it a crisp but not bad, not bad at all. 3.5/5 Drinks: Strawberry Splash- This is kind of their signature drink..but it didn't live up to the hype. It was okay but didn't have a nice fruitful taste like you'd expect it to have based off the name. Just something about it 2.5/5 Strawberry Patch- Same story. 2.5/5 Drinks here are okay, they have selection, so I'd recommend just getting what you get at a normal bar and not going after their ""signature"" stuff. My regret. Overall, not a bad chain. I would say I won't be back until the Lakers are in the ship again but with the dodger's on their tv's i'm sure it'll be sooner than a decade from now. Food isn't bad (just fix the salad), drinks can potentially be fine and our waiter proved that good service is possible here."
HueroVero M.,"Oxnard, CA",16,54,99,1.0,10/20/2016,Took bout 20 mins to get drinks then another 10 for ranch and then my burger came out well done when I got mid well fry are good they took back my food and now my wife done its just me waiting on my food sadly lets hope they make up for it on the fly !!!

Trang Q.,"Oxnard, CA",103,135,13,2.0,5/17/2017,"Typical American style food, depends who you get your service can be ok or it can suck. Always busy. Food is ok the only good thing there is the pazookie."
Jay G.,"La Puente, CA",0,41,6,2.0,1/2/2017,"First and foremost, the food was good but the service is extremely poor at the bar.  Lindsay at the bar was lack luster at being attentive and responsive. We didn't get our napkins nor utensils (as BJ's normally does ) we had to flag down another waiter to get help after several minutes of waiting and trying to get her attention while the food was going cold. only to notice that I was served the lunch portion instead of the dinner portion as I asked. We were never checked up on by Lindsay to see how our food was or if we wanted refills until we were ready to leave.  Don't come here if your on a schedule as you will be late waiting for your food and bad service!"
Tim B.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",0,22,,2.0,6/24/2017,"We had dinner there last night and just like restaurants that have been around awhile, the standards just start going downhill.  I ordered the Chicken noodle dish with Peanut sauce.  The presentation was dismal and taste was even worse.  It looked nothing like the photo in the menu? The salt on that dish was way too much! I refused to eat it. The waitress was very kind and immediately tried to resolve the problem.  I ordered a small pizza which wasn't that great of an improvement, but it was better than the first dish.  It amazes me how people are willing to pay for and accept substandard food?   When BJ's first opened years ago the food was decent, and now the new has worn off and so has its standards.  I do still enjoy the Jeremiah Red.  I just wished food standards were adhered to as closely as the beer standards?"
Shay F.,"Ventura, CA",2,41,7,3.0,6/18/2017,"The avocado egg rolls are the greatest app ever. And I always love the guacamole burger as well. But the last two times my boyfriend and I have gone, whether just for pizookies or dinner our service has not been good. Both of us have been servers and are extremely understanding. But our servers have consistently been inattentive."
Sandra P.,"Ventura, CA",0,20,,5.0,10/6/2017,"I've always come to this location to enjoy the food and company of friends, so I recently planned a birthday dinner for a friend of mine. I had called ahead to ask if they could refrigerate a cake I was taking, and that was not a problem at all. Our server Greg was absoulty amazing and made sure we were all taken care of. When it came time to bring out the cake he was very helpful. Greg did a fantastic job!"
Rene A.,"Ventura, CA",363,54,275,3.0,8/9/2016,"We stop by for appetizers, beer and pizza. All three are good and service is great.  If you check-in you get a free poozooki for dessert. I will come back and sit at the bar for better service."
Art T.,"Camarillo, CA",97,58,138,3.0,4/20/2016,"PROS: The Parma Garlic Chicken Wings were delicious... The half rack of baby back ribs were pretty good, along with a side order of asparagus...  CONS: Their Clam Chowder was too salty...I think I have a stone now from all that salt..just  kidding...not really... Oh yes, they have a rewards program. I totally recommend signing up if you're a regular to get perks."
