Danielle I.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,23,13,1.0,8/18/2013,"NEVER AGAIN. Went here last night haven't been to a BJs since high school and was super excited to have a pizookie. Got to our table ordered food .. The waiter didn't write our order down but I've seen that before, but I was a little nervous when he questioned what I ordered and I had to repeat two times what I said. Food took about 30 minutes to get out and when it did we had still yet to receive utensils and napkins we asked for.. And of course my food order was wrong. when we told the guy who brought it out it was he said he'd take care of it, since he was different from our server he goes to the back about 4 minutes later out actual server comes out with the same plate and says ""this is what you ordered."" I had to hold back laughing at him because I was completely shocked he would come out let alone after the plate had been sitting for a whole and tell me I WAS WRONG. Then says he can just add to the order if what I had wasn't enough. We said no. And he put the plate down since we just settled after being starved. Of course it was cold. Didn't even want to complain because clearly it wouldn't have mattered if that is how customers are treated. I should've known considering when we sat down the table behind us had just complained that their food was cold. Needless to say I didn't get my pizookie so that's sad but I didn't even want to be in the place anymore after being told I was wrong and served cold food. I know all BJs aren't like that the review is strictly on this one."
Rachel R.,"Oxnard, CA",216,224,87,2.0,2/1/2009,"About a month and a half or so ago I came  to Bj's with my sister (I just never got around to Yelping it again cause for some reason I've been distracted--or Lazy whichever way you wanna put it! Haha) and I ordered the Spicy pasta with Chicken.  I know I asked for Spicy but what I got was COMPLETELY inedible. Spicy to me means enough heat to at least give the feeling of a bit of a ember in the back of my throat but I guess the cook at Bj's thinks it means LETS LIGHT THIS SUCKER ON FIIIIRE!  I couldn't eat it. It really WOULD'VE been good if it wasn't covered in so much heat.  I like BJ's for other aspects and other things they've got on their menu Like the Spinach Artichoke Dip and a few of their deep dish pizzas and maybe a few of their cocktails and beers but I've had to knock a star off because well.. they don't really impress me much anymore.  Service still leaves something to be desired.  The funny thing is, I know I'll still be going to BJ's but I don't have much of a choice for restaurants out here. Its this or Fridays/Chili's.. PFFT yeeah right.  I could go to Olive Garden, Red Lobster or The outback but I'd rather not make my bank account cry."
Adrian S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2014,"CRAPPY FATHERS DAY dinner. This is my first Yelp post and unfortunately if i could give 0 stars i would.  Ive been coming to this restaurant with my family for years. I understand Fathers day is busier than usual but our service was crap and i hope a manager reads this and gets back to me or I will do it right after this.  The plates for my family of six took a long time. (again I understand it was a busy day so we waited patiently).  When the food finally arrived i had to wait another 15-20 minutes for my SALAD. My mom ordered a pepsi after i got my food and we didnt get that until the check came. I suggested to my mom that she shouldnt leave a good tip, but my mom still left her 15% on our $100+ bill. Before we left i asked our waitress if my dad was going to get a Fathers day cup (which is given away every year and we saw everyone getting one). She said ""i dont know anything about cups but ill check to see if maybeee theres something"" we waited for about 15 minutes but decided to head out. Our waitress passed by our table at least 3 times and never got back to us.  As we walked out a bus boy noticed that my dad was empty handed and asked us to wait and gave him a Fathers day cup... i regret the tip the waitress received-she didn't deserve a dime. Unfortunately, i cant remember her name but it may have been Shanna. She had curly blonde hair, early 20s, about 5'5, some acne on her left side...I don't know if shes new or not but her service was just TERRIBLE!  Don't go here!"
Courtnay R.,"Ventura, CA",63,3,,2.0,8/11/2011,"Poorest customer service I've had. And I've come back for more!!! We have eaten here multiple times and will not be going back! 20 minutes after being seated no one even came to our table to say they would be right with us.  I've waited upwards of 10 minutes for a drink refill, and waitstaff in general has a poor work ethic.  I'm paying $50-60 for a family meal and the service here doesn't remotely reflect what I'm paying for. DONT GO!!!!"
summer m.,"Ojai, CA",93,10,3,2.0,6/7/2011,"Balsamic chicken is dry, mashed potatoes are just ok. My companion got the pot roast he says it is too salty and the carrots are not cooked. My daughters pizza was just 'ok', even by a 8 year olds standards!"
Nadia G.,"Ventura, CA",52,203,4,1.0,11/22/2013,"I've been to BJ's numerous times before and have always had a really good food, service and overall experience. Unfortunately BJ's isn't the only restaurant in that neck of the woods anymore. This place has really gone down hill. My girlfriends and I had dinner here on a Tuesday night. It was busy but nothing like what it used to be. I had requested a booth and a high chair since we had a baby in our group which they kindly accommodated. That's where the good service ends. Our server was sweet, but she took a very, very long time to get over to our table. Our drinks didn't come out fast, mind you, we ordered sodas and iced tea not alcoholic beverages. We didn't put our order in until about 30 minutes after we sat down. She wasn't coming over to our table to often and didn't look our way so we couldn't flag her down. Again sweet girl but hmmmm. My friend and I ordered there $35 special which included a choice of 2 salads, 2 entrees and dessert for 2 people. I thought it was a pretty good deal! Our food didn't come out for another who knows how long. My girlfriends and I couldn't figure out what was taking so long. Again, they weren't all that busy. But we figured something was up because the booth behind us had an issue with their order. The manager came over and offered to comp their meals. He came over again at the same booth (different party) and offered to comp their entire meal. Hmmmm. Where was our apology or comp offer??? Our server, again very sweet, was kind enough to split our checks. My friend and I who ordered the $35 special paid with our credit cards. Our server came over and was going over the receipt with my friend. I was sitting at the end of the booth so didn't peek or really hear the conversation. I tossed my card over and figured everything must have checked out correctly. When my receipt came the total was about $25. It didn't hit me until it was too late. We were overcharged! I understand tax, tip and beverages were not included but I'm still trying to figure out how we each paid $25 (not including tip) for a $35 special for 2! Needless to say I will not be returning, very disappointed. There really isn't a need to return with the collection of restaurants near by."
Stan H.,"Littleton, CO",2,142,2,4.0,11/16/2013,"I liked this place, I go to a lot of micro brewery bars or places similar to this and BJ's was a good experience, prices were high but it is California  The micro brew was very good and better than most, the food was very good and of quality, service was excellent and the place is very, very clean, so I would recommend, oh yes, not a noisy sports bar but plenty of tvs"
Nerry L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",116,52,5,4.0,12/7/2010,"I've always laugh when I come here because this BJ's is located next to an In&Out, a little sexual humor for you there hahah. Anyways I love BJ's no pun intended, the atmosphere here is great, the service is good, and the facilities are clean. My first time here I wanted pizza because pizza is my favorite food and to my surprise they're pizza here is really good, they're sandwiches and pastas are also good too. BJ's is also known for they're pizzokie's, a warm cookie with vanilla ice cream soooo bomb!! Overall a great place to eat with family and friends even for those who just want to sit at the bar, drink and watch the game with their buddies."
Karina N.,"Ventura, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/28/2014,Let's see where do I begin this horrible experience at your restaurant. On friday Feb 28th at around 6:30pm we arrived with 22 people we were celebrating my nephew's 15th birthday and he wanted to have his celebration at BJ's. Well we called earlier to make a reservation and was told that they had a party at 6:30 but to come in and they would accommodate us and we would wait for a bit. So we all showed up at 6:15 and we were told it would only be an hour wait...so we waited. Around 7:45 we began to get inpatient and asked again...the hostesses were so rude to us telling us it would be about 1-2 more hours so I asked to speak to the manager who's name was Lisa and well she wasn't much help at all. They said well we have another party coming in so you have to wait until we are done with them. Not knowing that we had been looking at the patio area this whole time where its set up for big parties and it had been empty the whole time we were there waiting no party at 6:30 showed up. I was frustrated and upset esp Let's see where do I begin this horrible experience at your restaurant.

I was frustrated and upset especially because the staff was giggling at us rather than trying to accommodate  us. We didn't get any apology for making us wait an hour already then telling us it was going to be 2 more hours. If they would have told us when we got there it was going to be a 3 hour wait we would have gone somewhere else rather than wasting our time. After all that we ended up leaving...and your restaurant had a no show of the 50+ party they had supposedly told us they had at 7:30. You know one thing is to upset me as an adult I can handle it. What I can't handle was disappointing my 15 year old nephew. Your restaurant lost our business along with the other 2 parties that never showed up. You really should enforce better customer service to your staff. I know you probably don't care that I'm ranting on about my experience and you will probably brush it off. I just thought I would let you know how your restaurant in oxnard california is being operated. Totally unprofessional.
Jonathan S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",22,147,13,2.0,4/17/2009,"If you've ever been to DuClaw on the East coast, just wish you were there.  This chain of breweries reminds me of DuClaw but falls short.  The BJ's chain is poorly reflected by the one in Oxnard, CA, and I hope they're not all like this. I've been here twice this week and both times the same problem: horribly slow service.  We seated ourselves in the bar area (maybe that's the problem... bar scum aren't treated as well as the dining area patrons!) and easily waited 10 minutes each time for a server.  By then we had clearly settled on what we wanted to drink (and eat), so we placed our orders and then easily waited about 10 more minutes to get just our drinks!  Compound this slow process by ordering food, ordering more drinks, and then trying to get our check and multiply it by two (for the two evenings there) and you get: two stars. The only reason BJ's doesn't get one star is that their Espresso-Tini, salads, and desserts were good. ... oh Oxnard, couldn't you do better?"
Kim M.,"Ventura, CA",5,129,,2.0,12/3/2009,"BJ's is mediocre and way overpriced. Their burgers are nothing special and their salads are bland. Everyone I know raves about their pizza-cookie thing, which isn't bad but nothing I would be willing to wait in that long of a line or pay that high of a price for. The only thing that I really like is their French fries. They have the thick potato wedge style fries and they are delicious. Well the fries and their beer. They do make very good beer."
Mike C.,"Hidden Hills, CA",0,5,,4.0,3/26/2012,"great happy hour, really good individual pizzas for cheap. Nachos are amazing and big! so much beer to pick from. Place is really fun great place to head to friday or saturday night."
Monica R.,"Ventura, CA",0,69,,4.0,6/16/2013,Oh hell yea! I am a fan of this place!  Short wait was ok. But what got me was that they do not card you. My big brother ordered pitchers and the staff just brought glasses.  Cha-ching! we be drinkin!
Vanessa Z.,"Oakland, CA",75,38,,3.0,2/23/2011,"The service is usually good, today however it was terrible. We waited literally an hour for our lunch- my pizza was cold when I got it an my parents had ordered salads which as you know are just tossed.  Her name is Lisa so if you get her beware. The service is usually better than her though. I also really like the layout of this BJ's.  Field of greens salad is good, also the Margherita pizza is pretty good."
Mildred F.,"Camarillo, CA",1,12,,2.0,12/1/2013,"We just to love this place, especially the happy hour menu. Not anymore.  This is the second time we are extremely disappointed.  The service was terrible, the portions were tiny and the food was cold.  We are not going back."
Vince E.,"Burlingame, CA",210,666,908,3.0,4/19/2009,"Every time I come here it's game over, food coma for the rest of the day. I do like the half soup and sandwich lunch special for about 7 bucks with the chili and extra oyster crackers. But bj's is still just bj's"
Tori G.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,14,,2.0,2/25/2014,Service is less than lackluster; consistency in food is non existant; packed location is always. Also noticed that waiters/waitresses seem to be on their phone alot. Also noticed the poor group of tables next to me went through three server changes in less than 5 minutes. One was leaving for the day; new one had to go on lunch and next one had to go on a break. WOW!
Shaggy R.,"Ocean Pines, MD",0,11,,1.0,4/11/2012,"While on a visit to the LA area I wished to visit as many Breweries and Brew Pubs as possible.  We had our small dog with us and so we couldn't enter the restaurant, which is fine.  They have an outside deck but the only way we could be seated is if the dog was tethered on the sidewalk next to the deck.  OK again, but then the only tables available were 2 tops (we had 3 people) and the manager would not allow us to move them together.  Is their food any good?  Is their beer any good? I have no idea and have no use for a place that is this inflexible."
Cel T.,"Paso Robles, CA",456,9,4,5.0,10/31/2010,The new small plates are great. MAC n cheese for 3.95  amazing
