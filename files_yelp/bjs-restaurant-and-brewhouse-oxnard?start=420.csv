Vanessa M.,"Ventura, CA",9,66,5,4.0,4/16/2013,"I've been to BJs only a handful of times in the past few years at different locations including this one. I'm not giving them 5 stars because it took me this long to finally realize that since they specialize in pizza and beer that's really what they should stick to or at least what I should stick to from now on. Their pizza is delicious but everything else I've tried so far hasn't. First time I tried BJs I tried the Jambalaya, it was way way too salty and I just couldn't finish it. Second time I ordered their fish tacos that described them as ""lightly"" breaded, needless to say they scraped the roof of my mouth and made it hard for me to eat for the rest of the day. Just last night I decided to order the Cajun Pasta aka Chef Boyardee with a bottle of Cajun seasoning salt poured on top. Well I've learned my lesson and will stick to their pizza which always aims to please. (oh and their calamari appetizer is pretty good too)"
Mary R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/2/2012,"Great food, service and Menu. Much more healthful menu, whole wheat crust. We had a problem with our food it was reordered, manager and Server couldn't have been more helpful. Can't say enough good things. MB"
C M.,"San Diego, CA",1,293,169,5.0,7/23/2011,How does this place only have 3 stars!? Its amazing! Specially their Pizookies! A huge warm Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla ice cream on top. So good! Good food and beer too :)
Paul C.,"Oxnard, CA",35,40,4,5.0,9/29/2011,BBQ chicken salad from here. Love this place. Had my birthday party here
Bill D.,"Templeton, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/26/2013,"Burger was barely warm. Fries were cold. Although it wasn't hot, the burger had great taste. Ordered a beer. Never got it but got charged."
Joe W.,"Ventura, CA",4,72,,2.0,7/5/2010,"Used to have decent beer, but now it's trucked in.  Extremely expensive, we dropped over 125 for two couples.  Way too much for pub grub."
Clay C.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",60,15,8,5.0,5/14/2011,We LOVE BJ's !! Everything on there menu is good! I esp enjoy their pizza and salads... Staff is always great! This is my staple place in Oxnard/Ventura!!
Justin P.,"Lompoc, CA",1,20,,5.0,9/5/2013,This was our first time coming here and it was absolutely amazing. Eddy was our waiter and he was fast and on cue when we needed anything. Burger got a 5 star and the top sirloin got a 5star. I also tried the oasis beer they had and it was better than Budwieser I will be coming back to this place next time im in town..
Richelle A.,"Oxnard, CA",0,6,2,1.0,11/30/2013,"I came to bjs in Oxnard for lunch and drinks with my best friend and thought we were going to have at least a decent experience, however, we ended up with the worst waiter ever. His name is Aaron and if you enjoy getting ignored he's the guy for you. I ordered my normal Santa Fe salad and beer but this time the salad tasted so off. I didn't eat it and had to wait at least 20 minutes before he even noticed! Not to mention the 15 minutes we waited before we got our drinks ... Our food got to us before our drinks. He didn't  even offer me anything to eat or even give me a chance to say if I wanted anything else. I'm ready to go but of course everything is taking forever... He probably forgot about us AGAIN. Worst service I've had in a while and that's not even all of it."
John K.,"San Clemente, CA",27,15,9,2.0,8/12/2010,"Not very good...especially for the price.  I had the double wedge salad which had very little bleu cheese crumbles and dressing.  Paid $11 for the salad.  Worth $2.00.  Atmosphere was nice and I suspect that there other offerings are better.  Unfortunately for me, I am a one and done person.  If this is the first visit, you better deliver or I am done.  What is that saying?  ""First impressions are lasting impression."""
Chris S.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,8,,2.0,4/17/2011,At bj s oxnard ordered mac cheese appetizer n fried artichoke which was cold and a pizza that the dough was raw. Yuck bjs really
Denise D.,"Ventura, CA",17,42,14,5.0,2/2/2008,"This was our first experience at B.J's and I would definitely go back.  Our friends had suggested going to dinner on a Saturday night (they have been before) and said we should probably go around 5:15 to beat the crowd!  When we arrived there was already a crowd waiting for tables.  So off we went to the bar with our little beeper for our (according to the hostess) approximate 20 minute wait.  My hubby and friend had their blonde beer (not sure of exact name) and myself not being a beer loverr had a sip and it was pretty good!  While we waited, we started thumbing through their huge menu with lots of selections. We were seated at a great large round booth located by a window in about 15 minutes.  I highly recommend when you arrive for any meal, see if you can get a table serviced by Dillion.  What a great waiter!  He gave us a little run down of BJ's since it was our first time there and he seem to really like working for this company.  Somehow the subject of root beer came up and he said they make a fantastic one.  My husband asked for a sample and he ended up bringing two large glasses for each couple to share!  It was very yummy. We ordered their hot wings and while they were a little spicy for me, the guys really liked them.  My hubby ordered a thin crust basil and cheese pizza as he knew he would be eating at least 1/2 of my delicious barbeque chopped chicken salad - which was huge!  The size of their salads put California Pizza Kitchen's to shame.  My friend ordered their Italian deli salad (think that is what it was called) and she took at least half of it home.  Her husband had the beef dip sandwich with huge delicious steak fries.   Dillion came over several times to check on us and my friend jokingly  mentioned ice cream would be great in the root beer.  Not five minutes had passed and here came Dillion again with another ""sample"" root beer with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream!  She was in heaven.   Dillion brought our check and said there was no hurry, just wanted to give it to us when ever we were ready.  We felt no pressure to leave, even though there was a lot of people waiting for a table. We will definitely go back to B.J's as I really want to try their deep dish pizza, which is a one of their specialties.  Sure hope Dillion will be working!"
Danielle K.,"Oxnard, CA",71,37,,4.0,9/20/2011,"My mom ordered a buffalo chicken pizza for take out awhile back and it was yummy, with ranch sauce.  My mom likes their avocado egg rolls, and their pazookis are good."
Chantal P.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,6,1.0,8/15/2012,"TERRIBLE!! I was so disappointed coming to this BJs. I love their balsamic glazes chicken and was looking forward to that, but I was so mad leaving My party didn't even get a table before we experienced the RUDE hostess. They told us it would be a 20 min wait. I understand that it's crowded but we stood out there for 45 min. When we went to check on our status for a table we politely said how much longer will the wait be. The hostess said "" Your table isn't ready yet, what do you want me to do pick up the others party's food so you can sit down?"" We told her **eff you we're going to Chilis. I will stick with the one in Westlake!"
Arnold W.,"Irvine, CA",710,1580,989,1.0,4/16/2007,"I would give less stars if I could. They have the most horrile service. I once went, they never gave me my water, or even took my order, after like 30 minutes, they took our order, it took another hour to get our food, and our food was cold. Horrible food, horrible service. I do not recommend this place. However I've been to other BJ's locations (Laguna Beach and Irvine) those locations are much better and serviceable. I guess it's good to go on your birthday for the free piezookie. Sadly this is the only hotspot restaurant to go in the Nard."
Monica E.,"Oxnard, CA",0,7,1,2.0,7/27/2013,"I've been here a couple of times, and it has been usually when they have the special of 2 soups, pizza, and pizookie for like $20. I've had some bad service but the only thing that keeps me coming is the deal. I've had that they have brought all the food out at once, a hard pizookie and the waitress aren't very welcoming or attentive and service takes some time. After the first time I had a pizookie I became addicted to it and I can say that now I make my own and better tasting then the ones sold here."
Matthew J.,"Palos Verdes, CA",26,274,59,3.0,9/19/2010,Stopped by on our way home from Santa Barbara.  This restaurant was packed on a Sunday afternoon (football on all the televisions).  I always get pizza when I come to BJ's (love the deepdish) and it rarely disappoints.  Service was sub-par this afternoon though.
Tammy Q.,"Fullerton, CA",98,179,58,3.0,5/19/2008,"It's true the service at BJs really does vary greatly from visit to visit. Sometimes my frineds and I would get awesome service, really attentive but most the time you'll have to do a little waiting and maybe  a little waving to get their attention if you need something.  Besides the service, the food is usually good. If you've never tried it, you have to get the pazookie for dessert. Never tried the beer but everyone keeps mentioning theyre good :P"
Art P.,"Oxnard, CA",9,17,10,2.0,7/8/2012,"I have been to this BJs several times only because my daughter likes it here. This time even she was disappointed. First off their was no wait which was surprising as their is always a long wait to get seated. But then we waited over 30 minutes before our food came, and the worst part is the food came cold. 2 of us at the table received their food and 2 of us had to wait another 5 minutes. Unacceptable!! If I have to wait 30 minutes for my food it better be good! I sent it back, and the manager was apologetic and gave me free soup and another plate, but I had already lost my appetite.  Which brings me to think the restaurant set up is all wrong, cooking area should have been centralized to the servers dont have to go far for the orders. Terrible set up. Anyways, I will come here sometimes, but not my first choice."
sunny b.,"San Fernando, CA",0,21,,1.0,8/25/2012,I have been going to this oxnard Bj since it opened. Well done place with good atmosphere. The pot roast was my fav. In this bad economy I noticed alot of places have been using cheaper ingredients for their dishes and still charging the same. My pot roast used to be soft and tender simmering in sauce. The carrots were cooked soft and hot  Now the same pot roast is prefab tv dinner. Not even cooked at all  microwave beef chunks with some can brown salty sauce on top. Carrots right out of the plactic bag uncooked cold and bland. $15 wasted. Go there for basic sandwiches but the main dishes suck now  Sad to see.
