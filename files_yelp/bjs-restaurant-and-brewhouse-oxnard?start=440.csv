Guillermo R.,"Oxnard, CA",19,34,36,1.0,3/24/2012,"first of all i have been there many times before, however this one was far from good. i sat at the bar and it took about 10 min before they took our order. then when the bartender does ask us what we want hes doing like 4 other things while trying to take our order, i knew it was not gonna be good right there. and it wasn't he messed up my order , the food sucked i shouda gone to jack in the box cuz that would have been better,.so not going back for a long time"
Chip E.,"Camarillo, CA",0,18,5,4.0,12/12/2009,"Very nice chain restaurant.  Soup & salad, endless, is great for lunch.  TV setup is probably the best around.  The food is above average, friendly-service and if you don't want to wait for a table try the bar area.  Beer selection is really good.  Their recent model looks really nice too."
Scott M.,"Sand Springs, OK",1,16,3,4.0,9/21/2010,Big group. Great service and good food. Happy hour prices are great. Victoria is fantastic.
C J.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,113,,2.0,3/25/2012,the same mediocre food at slightly inflated prices. pretty shabby service but nice atmosphere.
Margaret L.,"Camarillo, CA",39,80,,4.0,1/4/2007,"One of the better family friendly chain restaurants, but they have some cool aspects to it. I must say that it's probably one of the best Chicago style pizza over here. I had some mustard ish sandwhich which was not that good. I do not recommend the sandwhiches but pizza is a good solid bet.  I love the beer that they ""brew"" there ( I hear that they the restaurants don't always brew the restaurants onsite). The sampler is pretty cool. I do love the Blonde beer.  They have pretty good happy hours there as well. The lettuce wraps and the drinks are I believe 50 percent off.  They do offer a HUGE Pizzoukie where you share with 5 or 6 of your friends. I believe you can even mix several types of cookies. They used to give a certain percentage to cystic fibrosis research on Tuesdays, however, I don't know if they still do that."
Julie A.,"Irvine, CA",8,6,1,2.0,8/9/2012,"Staff , including management, gave off the message that having customers was annoying.  Service was incredibly slow and after 2 hours of waiting, the food that arrived was cold.  I ended up nauseous and with stomach pains within hours afterwards, so, simply cannot recommend anyone going to this establishment.  They seem to know they are the only option in the area."
Don M.,"Ventura, CA",2,70,,4.0,5/7/2007,"THIS REVIEW DOES NOT COVER THE FOOD...  ONLY THE BAR. But they do have a great beer selection. Their brews are good and the Belgian selection is the best I've seen in the U.S. Menu looked too ""chain restaurant"" to motivate me to eat anything there..."
Rob G.,"Port Hueneme, CA",42,156,2,4.0,3/14/2009,"Apparently since my move to Arizona and subsequent return to the 805, this BJ's has undergone a management change and slight(?) interior refresh, with an actual host/hostess station. Wait staff is considerably less snotty, wait times seem to be shorter although the place is as crowded as it's always been, and the Berry Burst Cider? Just as good as ever."
Brian G.,"Oxnard, CA",4,13,21,4.0,1/11/2010,"Many items on the menu are tasty and if you don't have your panties in a twist over counting calories then feel free to indulge in whatever looks good. However, when I come home from college I usually pay no mind to the meals, I'm strictly there to grab a beer and a side of fries with my parents. The ambiance is nice and the on-site brewed beers are quality. Stop by and enjoy."
Mandy C.,"Lynn, MA",1,26,12,5.0,11/26/2009,"I love this place! Great setting to watch any game.  Mixed sports fans, so no crazy heckling. Delicious beers and very friendly bartenders and wait staff!  Great happy hours too!"
Steven T.,"New York, NY",16,39,,3.0,4/22/2009,"This place has delicious food, service is a juggle, depends who you get..I think at this location, the male servers are more friendly and attentive (no offense). Tonight I got the clam chowder in a sourdough breadloaf, and it's always so good and fulfilling, with a glass of chardonnay. I also like their meatball sandwich from here with wedge cut fries, the bbq chicken pizza is also tasty, sometimes the bbq sauce is a bit overpowering, so i tell them light on the sauce. the pastas here aren't so great, so i suggest skipping that part of the menu. the roast beef is pretty good, comes with mash potatoes and steamed veggies. spinach artichoke dip here is ok as well, nothing spectacular. let me think of the salads... ceasars ok, crisp chicken can be skipped, it's so pointless to 'try' and eat healthy with that since the chicken is deep fried, might as well get a burger. bbq chicken salad is probably my fav salad there. california burger is good on sourdough. let's go to desserts... known for their pizookies, it's a baked cookie in a silver platter ala mode (topped with ice cream) it's good, you can choose from three types of cookies, choc.chip, white choc macadamia, or oatmeal raisin. so bj's really is just a chain restaurant that offers comfort food, and they have a pretty good variety of items to choose from and they're also known for the beer they brew there. So, if you're feeling a little hungry for simple comfort food, bj's is the quick fix."
Andy V.,"Ventura, CA",97,30,2,5.0,8/3/2008,"Ok, since my last review in March I have been a few times, It has gotten better. The have a Cuban Burger that I cant get enough of. The beer is always good. I think they high turn over rate as far as wait staff is concerned. It seems like the last few times we have come here someone is new or in training...Good or bad? I dunno. But last night,last night was the best !  As we finished our dinner, the Manager comes over and says "" Hi, how was your meal?""  As he waits for some help from some bus boys etc. They get there and across from us  they start frantically putting tables together for a very large party. As most everyone knows The Dallas Cowboys football team is in town for pre season camp.The manager mentions that like 14 football players are on their way and they will be siting here. Well, I'm a RAIDER fan, so my response is lets get the hell out of here, the restaurant was already full with a bunch of cowboy freak fans so I wanted out! Well by the time the pazookie and check were all done...Here they come 14 real big people, one of them was a big man. So here was Terrell Owens and 13 family members. Mr. Personality sat across from me and stared, and stared not at my wife but me!. I couldn't shake him. I know I'm ugly but  negro please! The only thing I can think of is that I was waring an Ole English 800 shirt and He wanted to get his fade on with the Ole E ! He Shot me a nod and a smile,Terrell Owens and I had an Old English bonding moment. Too Funny!"
Jessica D.,"Camarillo, CA",88,210,24,3.0,9/8/2008,"The service was really lacking. I would give it a zero. No one cleared our plates the entire meal. We got to dessert (awesome pizzokie - fresh baked cookie in a personal deep dish pizza pan) and still had the salads, appetizers, and entrees sitting on the table. Such a terrible showing for the wait/buss staff. Our waiter went on a break during our meal and we never actually saw his replacement, just a bunch of random people coming by and dropping off our dishes. Yes, the place in insanely busy, but the food was really good. I've heard its consistant as well. Lots of huge televisions to keep the sports-minded man in your life busy. Great beer and cocktails as well. I had a really nice time here and would go again. Hopefully the service wont be as bad."
John Anthony G.,"Camarillo, CA",48,22,,2.0,12/23/2008,"Well BJ's is BJ's, the food is ok, but the service here is really lacking.  Not only here, I've experience the same poor service at other BJ's I've been to.  For some reason I keep coming back here, mainly because it's a main hangout for people, nothing much else out here in Oxnard.  Decent place for watching the game with a couple of friends though, if you don't expect much from the staff.  They do brew their own beer, but I'm not much of a beer guy anyway.  But I will say there are a handful of good items on the menu.  The ones that standout are the Meditteranian Pizza, the Chicken Parmesean, and the pizzokie (fresh baked cookie in a deep dish with ice cream on top).  The pizzokie may be the only reason I really come back actually, dang my sweet tooth."
Marcus M.,"Philadelphia, PA",43,15,1,3.0,3/27/2009,"BJ's has good food as a chain restaurant and I've never had any bad service experiences here, but it seems like everyone in Oxnard is at this location. It is always extremely busy and the wait time for dinner is usually at least 30 minutes so if you are starvilating then I would look for a different restaurant. If you have some time to kill you can get some drinks at the bar while you wait for your little puck to beep and buzz summoning you back to the host/hostess."
Camilla A.,"Newport Beach, CA",85,27,,1.0,6/13/2007,"Seriously, I dont care how good the food is (i used to come here often to order pizza and pizookie.  The food is actually really good) THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.  Last night I got an attitude from the hostess.  Who can  enjoy dinner when the second they walk in the door, they get an attitude from someone who is supposed to serve you?  Its doesn't make for the start of a pleasant evening.   Then they sat us in the crappiest area, when the restaurant was empty, and when we asked to be moved, the waiter went and got the manager.   The manager came over and then too gave us attitude and told us if we wanted to move then  we needed to pick up our own menus and move to a different table.  By that time, I was so sick of being treated poorly by people that I am paying, I just up and left.  I highly do not recommend this place."
Kristie S.,"Ventura, CA",33,203,23,5.0,8/29/2007,"We've always had good food, good service, and GREAT beer at BJ's.  They have an extensive food menu, and a wonderfully large beer menu (I have a hard time choosing between the Jeremiah Red and the Tatonka Stout).  Their salads are big and delicious, their pizza is deep and tasty, and their Pizookie...  oh, the Pizookies leave  me speechless.  Did you know you can order a GIANT Pizookie if you're with a group?!?!  It's the size of a large pizza, and it has a half-gallon of ice cream sitting on top."
Godfrey S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",16,342,,2.0,5/31/2009,"I ate here Sunday May 31st. The Belgian Beer is great, but too expensive ($8.50). I found the place to be too noisy, and too expensive for what you get. My chicken sandwich appeared to be from deli meat, and I could duplicate this at home for one tenth of the price. Their chicken marinade was good, but cost too much at $10.50. Overall this place is OK, but I will not return owing to the noise, the prices, and the average food. Most of the food is a diet buster, and bad for the heart. The beers, however are good, with a wide variety."
jenilee p.,"Salem, MA",45,263,87,2.0,4/25/2010,"meh. if it smells like a chain, feels like a chain, yeah, it's probably a huge cavernous room, with a few beer brewing stations in a glass room, and beer that tastes like it was brewed by a chain restaurant. i have the same problem with beer works on the east coast. fully respect that they're trying to brew their own beer and serve it within a restaurant setting, but unfortunately the brew house usually falls short on the beer and the restaurant food. we came here for a few brews, and after tasting a few of what they had brewed themselves, ended up switching over to the extensive list of imported bottles. service was ok, not great, and the same of the food. note: the porter that they do in house was among the blandest brews i've ever tasted."
Mia N.,"Monterey, CA",0,59,1,2.0,6/11/2010,"Customer service (our waitress) seemed a little slow, even though the place was not busy. It was around 2pm on Friday.  My husband was out of drink and not getting refilled. My 4 year old ordered a grill cheese sandwich with soup, but they brought my salad and my husbands soup to us first and did not bring my 4 year old's soup out. He later received his sandwich when we got our meals and we had to ask for his soup before it was brought out. Who does that, bring out the adults food and not the kids? My son was like, ""mom where is my food, where is mine?""  We tried to give my husbands soup to him, but he wanted the one that was supposed to be his. So he munched on some of my salad till his food came, about 10 minutes later.  My pizza was pretty greasy and a little tasteless. Other food was average, but customer service lacks.  If it weren't for the prices, i would have given a 1 star. They have lowered there lunch specials about $6.99 that made the bill better than the average outing for us."
