Brian S.,"Camarillo, CA",168,234,74,3.0,5/7/2008,"Compared to the BJ's in Thousand Oaks, this room seems larger, decorated the same with TVs, black ceilings, stone floors, brown accessories and food/service is similar. I kind of felt ignored though at the host station while the girls discussed seating strategy in hushed tones. We didn't have to wait because we got there relatively early for lunch. Lunch was fine, Avocado rolls were a little spicy. The kids liked the spaghetti. I tried their Maibach (sp) beer and it was pretty good. Pizookie was excellent. When walking to the restrooms, I noticed the brewery equipment and while looking in I saw a nice long line of ants behind the glass walls no doubt getting their drink on. Luckily they filtered the beer before I drank it. That's about the only thing that turned me off for our visit. When we left, the lunch line was out the door with people waiting with vibrators in hand. Not those kind of vibrators you perv. Pager vibrators."
Timothy O.,"Ventura, CA",0,11,2,2.0,3/1/2010,"I eat at BJ's about twice per month.  I usually get their Honey Crisp Chicken salad which really is overpriced for the portion size you get.  It used to be worth it but as time goes on their portion size is getting smaller and smaller.  The most annoying thing to be about this particular BJ's location is the fact they hate NASCAR race fans.  They have eight TV's in the restaurant and one very large screen in the middle of the bar area.  I have asked them on numerous occasions if they could turn one of the TV sets on the NASCAR race.  In asking over 20 times on 20 occasions they have never once obliged any of the people in our group.  The last time I was there I asked the manager again if they could turn just one of the TV's to the race and he told me ""fat chance of watching a race here""  So, if you are a race fan don't bother going to this restaurant because they will make you feel very unwelcome.  I have decided to not go back again."

Rich V.,"Ventura, CA",1,7,,4.0,8/15/2008,Did you know that they do takeout?   And you can get a growler (quert of draft beer ) delivered.    Small sircharge for delivery.    Too crowded....... not in your living room.    Great way to class up the Monday night Football
Dylan C.,"Ventura, CA",0,65,,3.0,10/8/2010,"awrighty peeps, so the place is a chain adjust your expectations accordingly, if you come here expecting to be blown away they are just way to busy to accomodate, that being said if you are looking for an afterwork cocktail or a hot meal served by a polite efficient person then hey youll get it here, they are pretty consistent, here's the deal, you gotta go on tuesday, every tuesday all the wine is half price, its a real blast, a few apps and a few glasses of wine with a cool pal and your off to a great week, seriously a good pal and i go almost every tuesday, we have alot of fun, thankfully she lives close by because i have yet to understand that just because wine is half price doesnt mean you have to drink twice as much....needless to say if i am tardy to work one more time on a wednesday imma have to serve the wine cuz my boss is about to boot my square ass hips right out the door! lol"
Erica D.,"Allen, TX",0,9,,4.0,8/4/2009,"My friend and I were in Oxnard from out of town looking for somewhere to eat. We checked out BJs on yelp and noticed that it didn't get great reviews all the way around, but we decided to go there anyway and see for ourselves. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (as they are a popular place), but we are glad we waited!! We don't know what everyone else is taking about! The service was just about the best I have ever seen!! The waitress never let my water glass get more than half empty, the food came out fast, and the waitress was incredibly nice!! We got the Artichoke and Spinach Dip appetizer; it was REALLY good and the tortilla chips were freshly made!  I got the Angus Roast Beef Dip, which was a tad dry if you don't use the au jus, plus I didn't get the onions on it so that might have had something to do with the slight dryness, but the flavor was great! My friend got the California Burger and she said it was awesome!! I got water to drink (which can be iffy at some places) and my friend got the Nutty Brewnette beer. Both drinks were very good! The seasoned fries that came with the entrees were very good as well!! Also, for the sports fans, they have several TVs behind the bar and throughout the restaurant showing several different sports channels. The prices are quite reasonable as well! We will definitely be going back here and we recommend it to anyone looking for a really good restaurant."
