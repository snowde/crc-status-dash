Toni K.,"Camarillo, CA",0,15,4,5.0,6/26/2017,"Although I have visited this restaurant many times and have always enjoyed it, my recent visit has made a lasting impression due to a wonderful waiter-Marcos. Marcos was the most attentive waiter I have encountered and almost had a physic ability to predict when I would need something brought out to me. Whenever I would be ready to place an order or request dipping sauce Marcos was there waiting to assist me. Along with the amazing food, this delightful waiter has left a good taste in my mouth and the urge to go back. Hopefully you will be given the chance to have Marcos as your waiter when you visit this fantastic restaurant."
Seven E.,"Ventura, CA",248,95,227,4.0,11/2/2016,This place is a great family institution it has good food today's sizzler with a twist !!! I think it's a bit over priced but as they say I believed I got a good deal cuz it was expensive   Lol.  Not all that shines is gold
Shaylee Q.,"Oxnard, CA",1,14,,4.0,5/25/2017,The watermelon Mojito is so good! Majority of the pizzas are good and the waitress/waiter are so nice! The front desk service is so/so. The bathrooms are very clean and parking is decent.
Paul B.,"Camarillo, CA",1,9,,2.0,7/4/2017,"We made reservations.  When we arrived, we were directed to Happy Hour in the bar area. We waited for five minutes for someone to bus the table, but it didn't happen.  We went back to the host to ask for a regular table, and were seated.  We waited for 15 minutes while others , who arrived after our party, were waited on immediately.  Finally, we had to ask for the manager. Very disappointed."
Robert N.,"Oxnard, CA",114,94,23,4.0,10/3/2016,"Simple Saturday night out with the wife. She wanted to Pizza I wanted something else. BJ's menu has something for everyone so we opted to go there. The Place was PACKED! Homecoming was going on , Large groups of Teenagers in their formal ware. It actually was kind of cool. They were all very well behaved. At least in the restaurant. Needless to say it was a 15 minute wait. So we got our table and order out. The meal was just what we wanted. Food was on point. But the service was Top Notch. Although they were very busy our waiter (Brian) took the time to go above an beyond. Even though he was noticeably Slammed. We opted not to have desert. But he insisted after we paid the bill and came out with a yummy desert none the less. He was Very Attentive and on the move the entire time. As was they Greeter at the door. Spoke to the manager on the way out about both. Job Well Done Guys we'll see you again real soon. Thanks for a good night out.  The Navarro's"
Erica M.,"Camarillo, CA",31,3,,3.0,7/3/2017,"I like BJ's but service is a real issue here! We went last night for dinner and our waiter really did suck. He got us our drinks and we didn't see again for 15 mins. The lady that served our appetizer just slammed it on the table and left, my husband ordered sweet potato fries with his meal and they never made to the table and when we finally saw the waiter again he said they ran out. Not to mention my food seems as if it was sitting for awhile because it was cold in a few places. Also there were a few pieces of corn throughout my dish that wasn't suppose to have fun"
Mylinh S.,"Oxnard, CA",49,133,471,1.0,1/27/2016,"This is the reason why we have not been back here for months, and it hasn't changed!!!! Here goes: Got seated right away. Good. Forgotten for a good 15 minutes before someone came and said hello and took our drink orders. Bad. Took back all the 5 stars I had given.  Drinks came right away. Good. Gave back 1 star.  Server took orders. Hamburger and fries with an order of spaghetti and meatballs to go. Good. Gave back the 2nd star.  17 mins later, server came back with ketchup and mustard. No food. Bad. Deducted 4 stars because I can't deal with my daughter being hangry.  Now they owe me 3 stars.  5 more mins and still waiting with the ketchup and mustard. And the place is practically empty!!! 12 more mins ... Flagged down a server and asked for our food. That person came back and said our food was coming. Grrrr.  Food came a minute later. I asked my server to give me the bill and the to go order before she left us.  My daughter finished her burger and fries within 2 mins. Where are my  to go food and bill? I can't be sitting here all day!!!! Waiting.  Still waiting.  Now I am mad. And I am never mad.  Minus 3 stars.  Bill came 6 mins after daughter finished her burger. Paid.  Still waiting for to go order.  OMG. This is why I don't ever go here. What was I thinking?!!!"
Chrinston A.,"Mission Valley West, CA",0,11,11,1.0,5/20/2016,Came here for a birthday party. I already it's going to be bad because of the reviews Ordered a dish of Quinoa Chicken with stuff mushroom appetizer. Appetizer arrived the same time as the main course.  And forgot to give you utensils. This is the most basic thing in a restaurant. Come on
Danielle D.,"Moorpark, CA",1,24,2,1.0,2/24/2017,"I would give 5 stars, however; I ordered a alcoholic beverage and had to send it back twice!! It did not taste right. The bartender put a sweet-n-sour in my drink, that is not suppose to have this ingredient!. After the 2nd time it was apparent she did not know how to make this drink?. So I settled for jack and Coke. Who can go wrong with this?. The down-side of this drink as-well, it taste as if she used a much cheaper brand of whisky!!! I advice to management, hire a bar tender who does not make it apparent to the customer and surrounding customers that she is upset!! Also one that can make a DRINK!!!. People pay high prices for drinks. We expect them to be worth the money.. Bartender was 40-50 years of age, Caucasian, blonde hair with some brown in it and a little on heavy side.. Couldn't see name.. After my complaint the customer service seemed to decline.  The food was ""OK"" the asparagus was horrible to the point it was not edible. This is why I do not like to complain, but the drinks were a disaster.. I TIP AS TO HOW MY SERVICE IS!! GOOD SERVICE I GO BEYOND THE RECOMMENDED. POOR SERVICE, IM SORRY BUT YOUR GOING TO GET WHAT I FEEL YOU TREATED ME AS!.    Since I come for the quality of drinks I will most likely NOT come back to this location.. Always wear a SMILE.. =}"
Elsa D.,"Ventura, CA",1,26,6,1.0,2/8/2016,"I have looked past the many mistakes they have made on our curb side pickup orders and continue to eat here because the food is great but today has made this the last time I eat at this resturant. As I was about to bite into my chicken pesto sandwich I noticed something strange ...a piece of plastic  I took it out and it was about an inch long,I decided to tear the sanwich apart and upon further inspection I noticed the chicken was still pink and slimy and not cooked well (I was wondering why it was a little chewy )...I got disgusted at the fact that the chicken wasn't cooked well....not even an hour after eating this crap my stomach started grumbling and feeling strange  Never again !!!"
Briana N.,"Santa Paula, CA",5,6,2,3.0,3/20/2017,Food was good service was good but what threw me off was my glass... I mean there was a chunk of hard ass food stuck on my glass im sorry  but Thats fuckin disgusting..im not going to drink that shit ..even tho i had a straw..and by this time we were already leaveing.when i   second refill w the chunk of hard food stuck on it.
James J.,"Ventura, CA",3,4,11,5.0,12/20/2016,"Just an awesome place to peacefully have dinner and appetizers while watching DALLAS COWBOYS. Great food. Service was a bit slow, but doesn't keep us from coming back."
K C.,"Camarillo, CA",2,17,2,1.0,12/17/2016,"I use to order take out from here somewhat frequently via online, every time I ordered I would ask for no onions and everytime I received onions all over my salad. When I would advise that I noted no onions, someone would give me an attitude saying I never did. The last time I took a photo of the sticker on the box that said ""no onions"" and the salad that had them all over. After having to remove all the onions, I filled out their online review. Never heard from the manager (she actually is one of the people who like to argue with me that I was wrong).   Everytime I pick up takeout, there are 4 or 5 employees standing around talking - no one acknowledges you or says that someone will be right with you. They let you sit there and wait until the take out person comes out. Most of the people who work there act like you crashed a private party and they want you gone. Only twice did I ever receive a smile or friendly interaction.  This last time though took the cake for me, I was rang up by the manager and tipped $2.00 on my take out order - which should have come to $18.15 with the tip. My card though was charged $21.99 someone changed the tip to 36%. When I called for an adjustment, the manager seemed to smirk, and actually laugh a little about why someone would be upset about it. She told me last Tuesday my card would be refunded - it's now Saturday and my bank has no record of a refund being processed back from BJs (so I'll just write corporate since they have such insufficient management). I'm sorry but whoever rang this up incorrectly, I believe did it thinking they wouldn't be caught because the amount was just an odd amount to charge. Hopefully, this isn't a habit they are doing - check your receipts.  In my call, I told the manager of my dissatisfaction with the service in a very assertive manner. She just said ""sorry I'll talk to them"". She should try leading by example, because she's walked past me plenty of times herself and never asked if someone was assisting me, spoken to me rudely when I asked why my meal had onions on it, and I've seen her huddled herself with that same group of employees standing around talking and ignoring the desk. I won't be back to this location, Westlake may be farther and the sometimes I'm not acknowledged right away, but at least 8 times out of ten times if I'm standing at the takeout desk someone asks or goes to get someone to assist me."
Mr T.,"Ventura, CA",92,1,,5.0,1/19/2017,"It is not often I make my way out to Oxnard, but this particular server has earned a phenomenal review, and quite possibly should also get a raise! A tall eloquent young man by the name of Chris Lee, a brew genius, a friendly persona, and a thorough understanding of the menu and hospitality. We were suggested harmonious beer and entree pairings, that could not have been evenly matched! Clever, quick server with a great smile! It almost seemed luxurious, BJ's I will be coming back for more delicious appetizers and friendly staff."
Shelly D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/14/2016,Wait time was 3x the length that hostess quoted.  2 main entrees arrived 10 minutes before 2 kids meals were delivered. Guess it takes longer to cook mac & cheese than a complicated dish. Soup was lukewarm and returned to kitchen. Asked the server to inform the manager. Manager never addressed us.  Will never return.
Tina K.,"Camarillo, CA",18,15,5,5.0,6/9/2017,Only reason I am rating 5 stars is because of Laura! She brought my two kids bread rolls & fruit as they were getting fussy waiting to eat. She wasn't even our server! I found this very attentive & caring to make sure we all were satisfied. Thank you Laura for running our food & bringing a treat!
Abe E.,"Millbrae, CA",32,9,6,1.0,3/9/2017,Curbside was a joke and the mozzarella sticks were cold and the salad was just ok. My first time ever eating at BJ's.....not blown away. Maybe that's why they never answered my email to complain.
Eddie L.,"Whittier, CA",25,15,,1.0,1/17/2017,By far the worst customer service! The food was ok nothing over the top.. my hot wing were room temperature my pizza was good same thing room temperature nothing was really hot! the waitress was slow and you could notice how much she hates her job.
S P.,"Oxnard, CA",0,70,10,1.0,4/8/2017,"Started off great was seated apon arival in a booth. Down hill fast after that! Ordered  mozzarella sticks with extra  marinara sauce and never got it. I asked for them to prepare my Top sirloin medium rare with butter on top. It was burnt and too dry too eat. I tried to point this out but our server rarely came to our table to see how we were doing. He filled my daughters sprite with water. He seemed very overwhelmed and inexperienced. I asked for extra lemon for my ice tea and finale got 2 extra when we asked for lemon for the salmon we ordered. It took 17 minutes to get the mini chocolate chunk. Never once asked how everything was, was obvious it wasn't with most of our food left on the plates. Very disappointed!"
Felipe L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",1,9,3,2.0,4/25/2017,"I was craving  a red ale and avocado egg rolls, but I ended up very disappointed. Server service was terrible I asked for water four times and they never did give me water, they would always say yes but never came through. Appetizers are supposed to be before the main course, they made us wait a long time then slammed us with appetizers and main course together. Avocado eggrolls were brown and stringy. They claimed they make them fresh daily,  which they probly due but the avocados were definitely old. I have had them before at other locations and they have always been impressive, but not in Oxnard. Then on one of my chicken wing orders they actually gave me a chicken  bone with no meat and they didn't even hide it was on the top of all the wings, it was obvious. For an instant I thought it was a joke I wanted to run in the kitchen and play a joke on the cook. After  complaining to a manager she did apologize and deducted the appetizers, but then they forgot about us. Before paying bespoke to her about the issues again and she apologized again saying yes they dropped the ball and I told her how could it is not even busy and we were not they only customers complaining. This place has hope but before they get better they need to retrain the entire staff, cooks, severs, bulbous, hostess and even the manager because they all sucked, sorry but true. I don't think I will ever return to this BJ's in Oxnard.  This might be our fault as the consumer for not complaining and putting up with the so call service. Remeber tips are earned, you get tips depending on the service you provide. Hopefully this place does better, but I will never go their again."
