James B.,"Ventura, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/18/2017,"Have been going to BJ's every year for my dad's Bday.  We've always enjoyed the food and service.  Well we went this past Saturday and Uh Oh, something has really slipped here in the food department.  Our service was standard so no issue there, the problem was with the food. My mom's Broccoli Cheese soup was room temperature at best, My dad and sister had the sliders that were SUPER dry, My niece did enjoy her deep dish pizza, but worst of all my Boneless ""Wing's"" didn't come to the table until everyone else was done eating. I realize things happen, but our family agreed that next time we go out it certainly won't be BJ's...."
Asaf K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/13/2016,"The beer was avarage, the service was the opposite of vivid. Zero enthusiasm and median service. It's a shame..."
Tue N.,"Oxnard, CA",102,26,59,4.0,11/30/2015,"I enjoy coming here. I always come here for birthday dinners and homecoming dinners. It's a great place  to come with a large party and they serve you very well.  I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night just to go out and eat. It was surprisingly not busy and we got seated right away.  Our waiter was honestly really annoying from being overly enthusiastic with such a forced smile on her face, but that didn't bother me too much.  The food here is always great, we both got the Avocado Egg rolls( like always) I got the steak with a unloaded baked potato and also the mozzarella tomato salad. My boyfriend got the chicken Alfredo.  I had no complaints and it was great having leftovers to eat for breakfast"
Miguel C.,"Oxnard, CA",182,46,33,5.0,6/13/2016,"Went in today wanting something different than my usual, so I happened to ask one of the servers I saw delivering food. I asked what he recommended for something quick but tasty. He offered a few items and I picked the Chicken Wings and damn where they good. Great choice Drake, (I think that was his name.) Thanks for the help and professionalism.  Be back this week for them again."
Grant O.,"Oxnard, CA",3,31,22,2.0,6/25/2016,"Food is OK, and the beer selection makes up for the lackluster menu. But don't order for curbside pickup. It seems that the menu for that is somewhat different than the regular menu, and the food I picked up was smaller portions, and the pizza was so burnt it was inedible. I'm retuning the pizza, to the manager. A good manager would never let food like what I got ever leave the restaurant."
Monica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,13,2,1.0,1/22/2017,Loved the food and normally the place itself.. but went for a late lunch with a friend only to be ignore completely by our waiter!! Had to raise my hand 3 times to get him to notice me while he was talking with coworkers! I've never felt like a burden or unwanted as a guest at a restaurant like this guy made me and my friend feel! I won't return to this location ever.
Tatiana C.,"Oxnard, CA",210,41,16,3.0,11/3/2016,"Food is always great. The place is always packed. I've made group reservations in the past and the service has been wonderful.  Sometimes it becomes so loud, that I need to yell in order to be heard; not entirely a huge fan of that. I'm not really into bars. Other than that, pretty trendy place."
La L.,"Oxnard, CA",178,17,15,2.0,1/15/2017,I've been coming here for about 5 years now and I only come for the food waiters/waitress are very rude ... they are on the phone texting and not putting in the right orders if food wasn't great I would just stop completely!!! Thank goodness for ordering to go!!
Eugene B.,"Oxnard, CA",89,3,1,2.0,4/30/2017,"Last visit was over a year ago, had an uncomfortable experience. Decided to try again and was even more dissapointed. Wrong food delivered, bar tender did not attend to me and I had showered before going to BJ'S IN Oxnard. Beer is okay, ambience also okay, seems the staff do not enjoy working there. It will be longer than a year before I return and I live in Oxnard."
Yvonne H.,"Oxnard, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/17/2017,"I went this past Sunday 1/16/17 around 5pm to celebrate my little sisters bday. It was a group of 4. We walk in and behind where the host stands there were 3 workers there talking amongst each other and not one of them acknowledged us when we walked in. We were just standing there waiting to be noticed. They all walked away and then one young lady came and took care of us. Our waitress whose name was Christie wasn't very friendly nor did she smile at all. We paid and my sister wanted a to-go cup for her lemonade and when I saw Christie I asked if she can bring us one. Ten minutes passed and she was nowhere to be found, so we left. I was very disappointed."
T M.,"Escondido, CA",1,59,,1.0,6/18/2016,If I could give negative stars we would. Service was absolutely atrocious. Took an hour to get our food.  When we complained to manager she didn't seem concerned.  Avoid this restaurant!
Tee J.,"Universal City, Los Angeles, CA",0,11,3,1.0,4/8/2017,"We really enjoy brunch and we go often. We have been to other BJs and had a great experience so we decided to try Oxnard. We went and order two pancake combos. The sausage was raw, we told them but the manager didn't comp us anything. We just called to try again but they insisted brunch was only until 1 when online clearly states it goes until 2pm. They transferred me to the wrong person and they were both rude so long story short... we aren't going there again."
Juanita C.,"Santa Paula, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/5/2017,"The burgers here are fantastic. I highly recommend the bacon cheeaburger and the artichoke dip. The service here was amazing! Lahsha h. Was our server, impeccable service... Considering i showed up at 11pm one hour before closing, the service was on point."
Patty L.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/27/2017,"First time at this Bj's location and it definitely will be my last! Food was mediocre, drinks were blah. Service  was a 3out of 5 . If I didn't know any better I would of thought I was eating hospital cafeteria food. Food made my stomach feel bad and I ended up vomiting. :("
Jason S.,"Ventura, CA",118,168,160,1.0,8/2/2015,"Today our group of twelve (6 couples,) planned a dinner night out.   We called to make a reservation for the group and they gladly accepted our reservation.  One restriction; our business was not welcome unless the group was billed on a single check. We were told no split checks.   What!?  So they happily cancelled our reservation and we happily took our business elsewhere.   With all the restaurants that have popped up nearby, bj's has nobody to blame but themselves if they go under.    It just sucks cuz the food is good. Operations; not good. At least from my visits.  But I keep going back hoping otherwise!"
Ani K.,"Tujunga, CA",83,73,38,1.0,6/9/2016,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! 1) the didn't bring appetizer until dinner was serviced 2) we waited forever and the food was wrong (waiter trained to explain it was right)  3) we repeat order drink from bar and it was wrong 4) Then no waiter to bring water 5) then we expressed our frustration with the waiter and he smiled and said sorry (shrugged his shoulder) like he doesn't care 6) I'm ready to leave and never come back- EVER AGAIN Please train this waiters
Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1396,10421,3.0,8/17/2015,"After having such a tasty lunch at BJ's in Thousand Oaks I decided to have dinner here at BJ's in Oxnard with my husband last night, but based on our experience I am not sure we'll be back.   We were seated promptly at a table.  The restaurant was pretty busy and no booths looked available so I didn't even bother asking.  We were seated next to a large party of 7 adults and 3 kids.  Why do I always get stuck next to little kids?  Anyway, our server introduced himself right away and took our drink order.  Our sodas came to the table quickly and we then ordered appetizers, but after that was done, no one came to check on us for what felt like an eternity.  We were ready to order our main dishes but I got the impression our server was going to wait until the appetizers arrived, which was probably not correct since he isn't even the one that brought out the appetizers anyway... The calamari and brussel sprouts we ordered came to the table maybe 15 min after we ordered them.  During that time the large party of 10 was looking around for someone to help them.  They had drinks but no one had taken their main order yet.  They flagged someone down and I watched as the employee immediately notified our server, who was busy at the kiosk putting an order in or something.  I then watched our server check on another table, deliver a drink and wander into the back kitchen area.   Maybe five minutes after the large table had asked for help our server appeared and took their orders.  My husband's drink and mine were empty at this point and our server eventually came back to our table, refilling my diet coke with ice tea and delivering a fresh soda water to my husband with ice in the glass (as opposed to his first glass and request of no ice).  I got my drink corrected and our order was finally taken.  I wanted a custom cookie dessert and our server said he'd see if they could make it.  Later he came back to inform me that they could not make it the way I had requested.  Instead of offering me the menu to make another selection, he just left the table.  I had to wait for him to come back to order again. Food was okay but I didn't realize the batter they use on their calamari had some heat to it, maybe a 1.5 on a scale of 0 to 10.  Just enough to make me regret ordering it.  Also though some of the squid rings were tender, I'd say about half were too chewy and the tentacles were very chewy and overcooked.    My side salad was okay, though the staff treated it as if it was my entrée and didn't bring it out when they brought my husband's side-salad out.  I had ordered the side salad and then a dessert, hoping that would be my entrée but since my dessert request got declined and I wasn't offered an alternative I sat around wondering what I was even going to eat. In the end I got a different dessert and that was the highlight of my visit.  The dessert was fantastic, the salad was all right and the appetizer I got wasn't what I wanted.  My husband ate his brussel sprouts but didn't have much good to say about them.  "".... maybe... if they had more sauce?""  He enjoyed his flat iron steak and steamed vegetables. Women's restroom was clean and well-stocked.  Temperature in the restaurant was kept low and the lights were not bright. It was loud inside (even before one of the kids at the table next to us started wailing and screeching) and would be good if you wanted to watch one of the games on TV but not for a casual/comfortable date spot. Service: 2 stars - meh, I've had better Food: 3 stars, mostly for the dessert One last note - hubby and I noticed the water conservation sign on the host stand when we entered so we were surprised when our server came to our table with glasses of water we didn't want and set them down for us.  We told him we didn't want them and he took them away and put them back on the bar counter.  Maybe he didn't get the memo?"
Madi H.,"Orangevale, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/24/2016,"Sat in the bar area in the low booths, server didn't greet us for 7 minutes. The drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive, not just drinks from the bar.  The fries were cold and the slider buns were soggy. When we ordered the pizza we asked for ranch. Had to ask for ranch when the pizza arrived, as well as Parmesan and red peppers. The Parmesan and ranch came but the server couldn't find the peppers.  I ordered a margarita after having to ask twice about their well tequila without an answer and the margarita came well after we were finished and after I had cancelled the order because I was tired of waiting for it.  The food is okay, the pizza is the best thing on the menu, but the service is horrible time after time."
K L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/22/2016,Food great  Happy hour worth it. Ryan the bar person is great and friendly. I go by there every chance I get  The waiter service is great as well. All friendly staff.
Cisco J.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/14/2016,This place sucks it took 1 hrs and 10 min to get my food then it Was cold Never will go to this Place again
