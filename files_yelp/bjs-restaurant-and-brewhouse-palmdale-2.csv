robert p.,"Palmdale, CA",48,41,10,5.0,11/18/2017,Showed up late to bring my daughter and friends for birthday  Wait wasn't long for 7. Service for 6 teenagers was amazing since they can be teens. Waiter was great and was on his game I believe his name was David  Big huge deal they are Veteran friendly
Allen W.,"Rosamond, CA",1,6,5,2.0,11/10/2017,"10 Nov 17:  Paul is an outstanding wait staff member.  Outstanding service, very delicious meal, nice ambiance.  Thank you, BJ's for honoring and appreciating our military veterans.  5 out 5 Stars.  Highly recommend! 11 Nov 17:   1655 hrs - Check in for waiting list 1734 hrs - Text message received for table 1756 hrs - Waitress finally takes our drink and food order 1816 hrs - Meal served Shrimp pasta was runny and bland.  The cookie pizookie was doughy/chewy and too much ice cream made it soggy.  Terrible performance and experience.  Crappy.  2 out 5 Stars"
Milton A.,"Rosamond, CA",66,69,24,4.0,10/7/2017,"This is probably my favorite BJ's now. We used the app to be put on the preferred wait list about an hour prior to us showing up. We were a little worried when we pulled up though as we noticed lots of patrons waiting outside. Our worries we quickly placated upon checking in as we were seated within five minutes. It took about 5 minutes to be greeted by our server, Luis, who was exceptional by the way. This was ok on my part because the place was busy! We ordered beers and calamari for starters. Sadly the appetizer went back because it was just too salty and I'm watching my blood pressure. Luis was great and had it taken off the bill. I ordered the prime rib, medium and my wife had the pizza and daughter the boneless wings. Everything was fantastic! The food, the service, the atmosphere. All three of us dined for less than $100 and had four beers! Great value, great food! I definitely recommend and we'll be going back again in the future. Cheers! Oh and the churro Pizookie is so good!!"
Mary B.,"Palmdale, CA",26,7,,2.0,1/10/2018,"Went there last night for a friends bday. The worst service we have ever had, waiter literally rolled his eyes when my friend starting asking questions about the food. Never came back and asked if we wanted a 2nd drink.....makes me really never want to go back and that's sad because I generally like BJ's."
Demi A.,"Los Angeles, CA",441,305,697,4.0,11/29/2017,"I built up an appetite from shopping at the mall across the way so I mozied over to BJ's.  I didn't have high expectations since I've tried a few of their dishes several times over the years and it was just your typical chain restaurant food...HOWEVER!  I sat at the bar and the person next to me had the deep dish personal combination pizza.  It looked really good, and he said it was good but it also looked like I would never be able to finish it.  As recommended by the bartender I opted for the California Club Flatbread pizza.  This pizza is out of this world good!  I know I know big statement, it's definitely a must try, I also ordered the Caesar salad-wilted lettuce, perhaps from sitting in a bowl of dressing all night, the salad was definitely a miss for me.  I should have sent it back but 'Wendy Williams' always suggests to never send your food back because you don't know if there is a disgruntled employee behind the scenes.  lol  I also ordered the cookie, salted caramel with ice cream!  This was amazing!"
Mike R.,"Palmdale, CA",2,24,2,1.0,10/2/2017,"We normally enjoy dining in at BJ's so we thought we'd try the curbside pickup for Monday Night Football. This review and rating is based solely on tonight's curbside order. Placing the on-line order was fairly easy; Pick the store location, select your items, request the pickup time, and done.    My order for the BJ's Favorite pizza was placed at 6:30 for a 7:15 pickup time. (45 min should be plenty of time to make a pizza.) Paused the MNF game at 7:05 and headed over to pick up the pizza.  Got there at 7:15, parked in the curbside pickup space (in the back), and called the number to say I was here to pick up my order.  I was told it'll be right out.  We waited, and waited, and waited... at 7:30 I called again and said I was waiting for 15 minutes. They again said it'll be out in a minute. 10 minutes later (25 min total), I headed inside. As I almost reached the door I saw my pizza was being delivered but I stopped him and asked to speak with a manager.  I explained the waiting and two calls to the manager and she started explaining something about being busy.  I told her I placed my order 45 min early and then waited for 25 min after the expected time.  She didn't say anything to that so after an awkward pause, I said they can keep the pizza and I'll get one elsewhere.  She that said I can just have the pizza without charge, and then something about their ratings.  (Couldn't hear because it was loud.) So we took the pizza but after getting home and opening it, I realized I should have just left it there. This pizza was nothing like we've had there before. It was light on toppings, dry--almost like they forgot sauce--and with burnt edges.  We ate just over half the pizza and threw out the rest. (We never throw out left over pizza!)  Yeah, it was that bad."
William B.,"Long Beach, CA",23,142,85,1.0,9/24/2017,"I eat out a lot and rarely write reviews of chain restaurants like BJ's.  I remember eating at one of their original locations on 2nd St in Belmont Shore.  Our experience here today on our raid trip home was nothing short of horrendous.  Our server, Brooke F, wasn't entirely to blame but her complete indifference to the fact that the food we waited 75 minutes for came out cold certainly exacerbated the situation.  You'd need a pair of those light up orange flashlights they use at LAX to guide in airliners just to get her attention...and when you've got her attention, you'd better be quick because she couldn't wait to leave our table.   Our pizza came out cold and soggy, chicken wings were cold, and salmon frigid.  Not that Brooke would know...we kept waiting for the unceremonious ""how is your food,"" but it never came, so we never had the opportunity to respond, ""terrible thanks."" Brook might consider a role in a different industry.  BJ's might want to consider staffing their kitchen."
Dave K.,"Honolulu County, HI",134,127,1241,4.0,9/13/2017,"Long story short, this place was great. I typically enjoy bj's.  service was nice and prompt. We had a bigger party and enjoyed ourselves here for hours talking and cacthing up. No problems with cold or bad food, and the wait was appropiate. The only thing that was not satisfactory was the absence of a baby changing station in the mens restroom. Otherwise, good stuff..."
Jason S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1283,137,507,5.0,9/4/2017,"I like coming to a BJs, the food is always good, the service is friendly and the drinks are the bomb. Plenty of parking at this location. And a nice and friendly atmosphere."
Kolton M.,"New Orleans, LA",19,52,197,4.0,5/27/2017,"It was a nice Friday night. The place was packed. It's a regular hot spot. There was a nice size line (40 min at 8pm) but we were able to slide right in to a table in the bar area.  Unfortunately it was pretty loud and a bit hard to hear. Our server was really on top of things though especially being he was slammed. He was no slouch. He seemed to make it a point to keep a friendly and attentive attitude.  I had the spicy pig pizza. The outer crust was crispy the inner pizza was a bit more soft. Loaded with bacon ham and plenty of pineapples and jalapeños, it had a sweet and spicy kick that complimented one another well. My friends (who are regulars) had the Mediterranean tacos and Santa Fe salad.  I was a little saddened I opted for the cheaper item, the two seated next to us had a rack of ribs and it looked amazing. They were a friendly pair as were several others we crossed paths with. Overall a pleasant and solid experience."
Chris G.,"Kansas City, MO",244,531,54,5.0,9/17/2017,"My BFF and I ate here in early September for a late lunch. The service and food were both great! We also had drinks and dessert (okay, so it was a ladies' long lunch.....).  I love it when you order the pizza they ask if you want the chunks of tomatoes on them! She had a sandwich.   I was actually glad when I realized that this was a chain, as the one we ate at in Colorado was awesome too!"
Jeremiah M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,5.0,12/30/2017,The bus boy Curt was so nice and sweet! Reminded me of my old dog pepper !
Yung M.,"Compton, CA",21,9,5,1.0,11/5/2017,"Ordered to go was there 10 minutes before food was done, HOW DOES IT COME OUT COLD if I'm waiting at the restaurant upwards of 10 minutes before food comes out!!!!! And on top of my food coming out cold/lukewarm I get home to realize they didn't put 1 of my pazookies in the bag and forgot my side salad!!!!! I usually have no problems at this location ""dining-in"" but it seems the to go side of things are not very organized and lacking somewhere so DISAPPOINTING.."
Mila D.,"Palmdale, CA",23,86,1,2.0,9/11/2017,"Okay this review is a tad late and I hesitated on writing it at all, but after my second visit last month it was long over due. First and foremost I want to commend the waitresses I had they were very lovely and knew how to serve us without being overbearing ( mind you I was on a date). Food was okay. The golden beet and arugula salad tasted like the lettuce was about to expire. My biggest complaint is with the drinks. For some reason the alcoholic beverages are not made properly. And trust me I know what I am talking about I was a bartender and server for 10 years. They need to re-train their bartenders on how to make drinks. You don't just fill a cup with ice and pour freely.  Please work with you bartenders on this. This is my second time experiencing poorly made drinks and I'm tired of sending them back. I'm going to stop coming if this keeps happening. Thank you"
Alex C.,"Lancaster, CA",0,1,6,1.0,11/7/2017,Who doesn't cut their pizza into slices truly dissatisfied with this order I've gotten better pizzas at Little Ceasars!! And I asked for no celery! Make sure to check your pizza when ordering carry out from the Bj's on Rancho vista Blvd!
Kristine P.,"Palmdale, CA",157,64,115,4.0,12/3/2017,"The servers are always very accommodating and nice. They take the time to chat, get to know your and get your order right. Whenever I have had an issue (meals out before appetizers; problem with food) the issue is fixed and order comped without asking. I do enjoy the revised menu and I am always a sucker for the Berry Burst. For a national chain restaurant it is one of my favorites."
Eric W.,"Valencia, CA",159,58,27,4.0,8/23/2017,Great place for Chicago pizza and appetizers. They make own specialty beer and have mixed beers  I'm going to have to comeback and see how their games are and specials.
Marie Z.,"Norwalk, CA",5,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"I absolutely hate doing this cause I always look for good in every situation. unfortunately there was nothing good about this my first trip to Palmdale Bj's. First we walked and sat in  the bar staff was friendly , ordered drinks it was a special night New year's day. My  great friend was celebrating an acceptance to a school. We ordered drinks, appetizer platter .They came about twenty min later  dropped off platter and walked away .No silverware ,no plates or napkins we waited for some one to come by nothing. Finally she brought plates, walked away and came back gave us one silverware setting and said "" well here is one for now I'll go look for the others ""I just thought well they must have been busy  ten min later, she comes back with silverware .Mind u we were pretty much done with appetizer . We ordered two steak plates and a brisket burger. About forty five min later she says"" ur food should be coming "" twenty min later she came back and said"" manager is with ur food now ""We were confused.  Finally food came out  ,I started to cut my steak and it was raw inside .Hesitant to send it back ,my friend said hers was to. My broccoli was completely disgusting ,her mashed potatoes were swimming in blood .I could not eat the steak ,so I sent it back and apologized  for complaining. Steak was returned ,by that time I wanted to leave. Asked for a box and the check. She didn't come back ,I had to look for her. The waitress looked tired and annoyed, we finally got our check and I tipped her twenty dollars and said ""u have had a long day and I appreciated her effort"" we walk over to pay and was waiting no one acknowledge us. Then the manager came over and we were paying with a egift card, we received as a gift   the manager runs the card and it declined, he then said that we needed to check the card on their site. He tried again and said it was declined .I had to pay for our food .He said that we would have to call and get another gift card not only was food bad ,but service was too we then left. I contacted the website and check gift card 3 times and was valid and had 100 dollars I was so furious and humiliated. I will never return to this location ever again .Now I have a freaking gift card I will never use ,cause BJ's Palmdale  I will not visit or reccomend  to anyone ever. I love BJ's Montebello. Amazing location but this one here is a complete disaster. They treated me and my friends like they were too busy to help us at all. I'm so dissapointed !!!!!"
Vicki M.,"Lancaster, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/5/2017,"The bartender Sarah is the best! She makes amazing drinks and is easy to talk to...like a long time friend. I love the jalapeno margarita and all the new low carb dishes. The Salmon with quinoa is my favorite! Tasty! Great atmosphere, excellent drinks and fun, friendly service."
Oscar V.,"Lancaster, CA",14,47,57,3.0,11/13/2017,Really bad service we kept asking n asking for stuff we ask for water like 5 times n ranch like four time food was ok
Don M.,"Lake Isabella, CA",9,38,29,4.0,8/12/2017,"Our go to place for late night dining.  New menu with prime rib, double pork chops, and baby back ribs.  Prime rib was very good and large portion.  Pick from 100's of beers, wines, mixed drinks. Fun servers.  Great place"
Kay L.,"Palmdale, CA",0,26,23,3.0,11/17/2017,Beware of the Beer how many ribs.... way too sweet and no meat.... do yourself a flavor and get the regular BBQ ribs they are delicious
nate s.,"Yigo, Guam",42,12,,1.0,11/9/2017,"A co worker had told me he would never eat here again after it took over an hour for food to be delivered. I should have heeded his warning. It took an hour for our appetizers to come out. We got absolutely no drink refills and our total visit was over 3 hours. Multiple food items weren't forgotten and we had to remind for numerous things to include: food items, drinks and break down of our check. It was like we were held hostage!"
Jasimine G.,"Inglewood, CA",81,20,2,3.0,8/11/2017,"Walked in and we were greeted, asked about our ""party"" and seated promptly. Our waitress Brittany, introduced herself asked for our drink orders and was pretty personable. She shared a tidbit about being a picky eater, since I mentioned my sons method of eating pizza. The cocktails we ordered took a while... a lot longer than expected, but I guess the bottle needed to make my drink was empty and had to be replaced. Anyway, once our food came it was business as usual; the check in to see if we were satisfied. But her trips to the table were few and far between... granted it was late and she could've just been off tonight, but I'm not really satisfied. My rating is based on the service which was 4 star and the food which was bland and lacked any real flavor to make me want to come back. The cocktail I had was delicious!"
Kayla M.,"Palmdale, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/20/2017,"Was here a few days ago to have dinner for the first time ever and boy was I disappointed. Our waiter seemed so overwhelmed with the amount of table he had to tend to so I don't blame him but service was extremely slow.  Our night: my boyfriend and I got there around 5pm on Friday had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 2 (no big deal. They seemed busy) got seated and the waiter didn't come over to our table until about 20 minutes after. He took our order and drink, another 20 minutes go by for drinks, 40 for food. Now I don't mind waiting if the food was worth it but it was definitely not! I asked for my steak well done and if came back medium rare... I'm not the one to complain or send the food back so I just ate my mashed potatoes and drank my watered down lemonade. Wasn't even in the mood for desert anymore since medium rare steak makes me extremely nauseous.  I will be making the drive out to Valencia to the Cheesecake Factory from now on!"
Adriana G.,"Henderson, NV",99,5,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Horrible horrible place to eat. We had a reservation for 6:30, got seated at 6:50 eh not that big of a deal. Ordered our drinks and Apps took about 30 minutes to get drinks and 45 min to get Apps, Ordered our food and finally got it probably 45 minutes later. Got 2 refills the whole time we were there. Horrible. Didn't get our free birthday pazookie. First and last time eating here. Horrible."
Geney R.,"Littlerock, CA",32,4,3,4.0,8/25/2017,"The food was very tasty I must say. How fucking ever,  my waiter forgot I put in an order  then gets it wrong . Also he took forever and kept forgetting to bring things back to my table. Love the food, service was sub par. Recommend ribs, loaded potatoes, and the avocado egg rolls will change your life."
Carolyn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,5,,1.0,10/27/2017,"This review is for bad customer service. In the last month have visited two diffetent locations  both times walked out. First one at Westfields Mall Culver City. They were busy for a Sunday afternoon, but after waiting and finally get seated, not one server acknowledged us so after 20 minutes we walked out. Second bad experience was at Palmdale location. Walked in and place is more than half empty at 11:45 am. Hostess asked for my name and said to wait . She proceeded to answer phone and it became apparent to me that her phone conversation was more important than a patron waiting. So we walked out and tried a new place next door, Fresco II, which had excellent service and food. Don't think I will go back to any BJ's!"
Saul G.,"Palmdale, CA",0,26,,4.0,11/6/2017,Came here on Sunday with my family. I got to admit I was skeptical about it at first but I tried the food and it was very good. The waiter was very nice. Did not mess up on our order. Would give them a five but it took a little long for them to get our food. But I'm definitely going back with my family!!!
Marco R.,"Palmdale, CA",1,13,,5.0,11/6/2017,This place is amazing. No matter what city... It is always what I remember. Great food and drinks. Never a disappointment.
Thirtynine P.,"Santa Monica, CA",410,7,14,4.0,7/9/2017,Food and service was good.great atmosphere and vibe . I really enjoyed myself a lol pricey but you already knoe that Jambalaya was off the hook
L F.,"Palmdale, CA",9,103,20,5.0,6/27/2017,"I have gone a number of times since my last review, and the service has been great! On my last visit, they even brought the kids free appetizers when we sat down. Whatever the issue was before seems to have worked itself out. Also, I really recommend using the mobile app. You can put your name on the waiting list, pay on your phone, and you get special coupons and offers."
Preeti R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,3,1.0,7/11/2017,"I ordered the great white chicken pizza from here to go. When we brought the pizza home, it was super dry, no sauce and the chicken and garlic were burnt. It was all bread.. as if I was eating a huge chunk of bread with burnt garlic and chicken. I called the restaurant and they said that they would replace the pizza. That was a reasonable service. I ordered the buffalo chicken instead this time. When I brought this pizza home, I realized the pizza was baked on a bread! U could see the top of the bread under the toppings. This pizza was a failure too. By now I was in no mood of consuming the pizza nor calling them. All this time I thought that made their own dough, but it is evident that that make their pizzas on pre made crust which is like a thick bread. Will never be ordering a pizza from here again."
Manuel O.,"Palmdale, CA",4,6,4,2.0,4/9/2017,"My sister likes to make reservations at the local BJ's whenever she wants to treat the family to a nice meal because she knows the food & service will be great.  Its become a tradition.  After yesterdays meal, the tradition is over. We arrived on time to our 11:30am reservation & were seated immediately.  (+) Some of the people in our group (11) were seated directly in front of where 2 tables met, which was uneven.  (-) A drink (water) was spilled over, and was immediately wiped off by me & my sister.  Our waitress witnessed it.  We gathered the wet napkins in the middle of the table, thinking our waitress would return to remove them.  She did not.  As we looked around to see where she was, we were dismayed to see her at the waiter station conversating with her fellow employees while staring at our table.  A little later another waitress came by the table to drop off our appetizers and as she started walking away my sister had to stop her and ask if she could please remove the pile of wet napkins.  (--) We asked if we could get some replacement cloth napkins and were given a pile of small paper napkins from the bar.  (-) We specifically asked for some lemon on the side for my moms salmon entree.  Was not recieved.  (-) Father requested coffee and was given half a full cup & no spoon to stir cream/sugar.  Ended up using a straw to stir.  (-) Food was delicious & prepared exactly how we asked."
Kimberley M.,"Whittier, CA",2,2,1,1.0,9/4/2017,"Sat down at 10 in the bar. James didn't greet us for about 15 minutes until we said something to the hostess. It wasn't even busy! He finally took our food order at 10:45. We didn't get our dinner till half hour later. The thing is, people who sat after us got served right away and even received their food before us. If we didn't speak up to management We would've walked out. But the manager did make up for the waiters lack of service to the best he could. I think two full hours in a BJ's restaurant is just way too long. I won't be returning."
Iris A.,"Sun Valley, CA",22,16,3,1.0,6/16/2017,It's a sunny day in Palmdale. Graduation season.  Took 35 minutes to get a waiter. Took 1 hour and half to get cold food. The waiter blamed the cooks and the manager blamed the waiter. Horrible service.
Ann G.,"Camarillo, CA",7,4,1,1.0,5/29/2017,"1 star is actually kind..... If I could I would have had given them a big zero!!!! Just had the worst experience at this restaurant. Arrived to a full restaurant and understand that we might have to wait. The host says to put my number in the pad since I am a rewards member and than told 10-15 minute wait. 35 minutes later still standing there waiting for table. Told your next, than watch them seat a party of 3 ahead of us that cane in after us. I than approach the host to be told they are cleaning up a booth now, manager standing there and guess what they call a party of 2 to be seated.... Not us and manager still saying nothing. We left and have to say will not be back any time soon. We actually had our first date at a BJ's and make it a point to go every year. I will be making a point not go to Palmdale for a long time. So the manager responded to my complaining review asking me to contact him to discuss... well I did and never heard anything back from him.... way to not make situation better."
Sara S.,"Palmdale, CA",35,13,6,5.0,9/26/2017,"This place is one of my favorite restaurants. What can I say, they've got it all: huge menu, lots of variety, great quality, friendly staff, speedy service, somewhat noisy atmosphere but not too bad, excellent beer selection, and offer pretty good coupons online. If you go, make sure to save room for a pizzookie!"
Gabie T.,"Palmdale, CA",67,332,249,5.0,2/3/2017,Jesse the manager reached out to me about my review. He was very nice and understood my disappointments on one of my visits. I told him I wasn't sure if I will be returning but we decided to give them another chance. This time around we had a better experience and our food was very good. I guess the last time the food was not on point.  I had the mushroom hamburger with fries and watermelon margarita to drink. The hamburger was really good and filled me up and the watermelon margarita was delicious. I didn't bring my glasses and the waitress helped me with the menu. She was a good sport about it. I asked her to make sure my hamburger didn't have bacon. This time around we got all of our food.                            There should be more managers like Jesse managing  places like BJ's. He did not have an attitude about my negative experience and all he wanted was us to be happy and return back as customers. I let him know I will be back and thank him for making things right with his customers. Thank you Jesse!!!
Shannon G.,"Lancaster, CA",91,127,63,4.0,9/24/2016,Issac was great as our server.  now his runners weren't that great. our calamari came out cold.  I sent it back and was hoping no one did anything to it.   our drinks were a long time in coming but they were delish! I got the French dip and fries.  the man got the fish and chips. both were wonderful.  then of course I had to have a pazooki... white choc macadamia nut. omg... so good.  so our over all was a good night.
