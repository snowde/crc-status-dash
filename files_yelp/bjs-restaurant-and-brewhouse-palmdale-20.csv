Jesse G.,"Madera, CA",31,49,,4.0,8/4/2015,The food was outstanding and the service started out fantastic.  When the waiter went on break the relief guy really struggled.  If we would of kept the first waiter it would of been definitely five stars...
Jeanne E.,"Lancaster, CA",83,11,1,5.0,2/17/2016,"Went there last night with the hubs. The food was great, and the waitress was awesome. Love their beer selection. Ask for a sample of their beers and you will always find one you like."
Melisa R.,"Kankakee, IL",65,20,4,5.0,1/15/2016,"One of my favorite meal spots. I have always gotten amazing service.everything I have eaten tastes out of this world. Try the ahi. Join the frequent diners club for sure,it's so worth it"
Carol J.,"Acton, CA",1,148,8,3.0,1/7/2016,"Varied menu but not enough healthy choices. They push beer, of course. I am not overly impressed with the value for purchase.  Service is usually pretty good but can be spotty depending if it's dinner or lunch rush and how the manager staffs daily."
Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,17,,4.0,1/3/2016,"This one of the few restaurants that I really didn't care for a few years back has really become one of my go to places.Cold Beer, above par pizza, good entrees, gluten free friendly for my daughter, the pizooki, lots of sports on, solid service and reasonable prices, what more do you need to know?"
Thomas P.,"Lancaster, CA",4,9,2,5.0,7/14/2015,Awesome service. Monica and the serving staff was fantastic! I'm a frequent visitor The kitchen accidentally made us the wrong pizza for my wife and she and the manager fixed it very quick with no questions asked. Even gave us the option of keeping the already made pizza. We kept it. Lol. But her communication and promote response is bell much notice and appreciated. Thank you guys.
Steve L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,88,8,1.0,5/16/2015,so i ordered a great white pizza and it had red sauce under the alfrado sauce and when we called the issue to our server she said that the red sauce is required to get the dough to rise......Really? LAME LAME LAME. Never again.
Jim B.,"Marietta, GA",60,86,10,4.0,7/17/2015,Always ok Service is usually pretty good. Lots of good salads!! Pizza is really good and we enjoy the avacodo rolls
Melody G.,"Lancaster, CA",1,11,,4.0,7/6/2016,So Saturday was my birthday and decided to come to BJ'S with my family. When we walked in the check-in girl was VERY VERY rude. (She was pregnant and wore glasses) did not catch her name. She gave us a dirty look and told us it would be 15 min to have a seat. This was not how I wanted to spend my birthday!! So we all decided to go elsewhere. As we headed out a young man chased us out and asked us to please stay. I explained what happened and he offered everything he could and said we would only deal with him. We thought that was awesome of him to put himself out there like that so we decided to stay because of his customer service. His name was Cody he totally turned our experience around!! Now Cody has the personality and customer service that this restaurant needs. I'm sorry but that girl is going to make you lose customers not gain. She does not belong in a field where she has to deal with people or in the front for that matter. None the less Cody gets 110% from my family and I and we will be back for him only!
Hanika F.,"Palmdale, CA",135,45,12,1.0,8/20/2015,"I called to make a reservation for 13 on a thursday. The lady signed on the phone then transfered to a manager who said they could not guarantee us seating, even if we were willing to wait 45 min. Terrible service on the phone..wont be back. Took my business to yard house who was willing to accommodate."
Bob Y.,"Lancaster, CA",5,40,2,3.0,7/21/2016,"OK, except....today the waitress insisted they didn't have anything but plain porter beer, when she went to get it I found on their menu the one we had asked for, raspberry, chocolate, she said she's bring it....we think what they did was add asome raspberry & chocolate surups, when we drank about 2/3rds of the glass it got real thick & so sweet as to be undrinkable, not wanting to make a fiuss we asked for our bill, decided we aould ask her about it when she brought the bill, she dropped it off in a rush ignoring our desire to talk to her, when she returned it with my card she did the same thing again. They think they pulled a pretty slick trick & maybe they did but they'll never know how much that will cost B.J.s in the future, there are too many places to eat, we won't go there again."
Bret R.,"Lancaster, CA",17,4,,5.0,6/4/2015,"I have been eating at BJ's ever since I first discovered the delights of their pizookies when they first opened their doors years ago. In all those years, I have almost always had exceptional, friendly, and quick service.  I rarely wait at all before being taken to a table and almost always have very prompt service. In the extremely rare cases that I have any problems whatsoever, the management team does an excellent and quick job of fixing whatever has gone wrong. To me, the true hallmark of a business that cares is not providing excellent service 100% of the time, a feat that is largely impossible, as everyone has a bad day, but in ensuring that problems are fixed and errors corrected.  I can say honestly and with great certainty that this particular restaurant has always done right by me, and I will continue to eat here for years to come. The employees and management staff truly care that you have a good experience and a good meal, and that is worth my business. Though, admittedly, I would come three times as often if they brought the red velvet pizookie back. ;)"
Denise V.,"Las Vegas, NV",125,104,20,2.0,6/26/2015,"Gone back and should have known better. Poor server was the same one waiting on us as the last time. Went in for soup and salad and once again had to wait and wait and wait. Manager came over to apologize and offered us a salad while we waited (We just finished our salad), meal would be on them because of the wait time. Val and I decided to order the pazookie trio. It's a couple of cookies with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream in a tin pan how long does it take. It's a good thing we didn't have any where to be or to do. Two hours + for a simple meal. Looks like I will be avoiding this place for a while. Lots of other choices in the AV."
Cecelia B.,"Palmdale, CA",180,16,2,4.0,11/14/2015,Always yummy! Good drinks! Good salads and yummy desserts... Service is pretty good and servers are friendly!
Ken E.,"Rosamond, CA",56,13,7,4.0,10/4/2014,"Great food...even better company.  We started with the artichoke appetizer,  Ceasar salad...followed by steaks.  Friendly service and a great rewards program ensure continued patronage.  The steaks were not up to their typical superior standard...but staff worked very hard to ensure that any problems were sorted out.  Our waiter insisted on involving the General Manager which ultimately resulted in an appropriate steak.  We finished with the seasonal pumpkin Pizooki which ended our meal on a high note.    Given our track record with this restaurant,  we'll return again."
Anthony B.,"Palmdale, CA",32,5,,1.0,3/9/2014,"Came for dinner and all we got were our sodas. We ordered good, but after 45 minutes out server could not be found and we decided to walk out. Even finding a manager was a challenge for the hostess. I've been here before, and service has been great to just ok.  Pros: appetizers, deep dish pizza and root beer"
Harmony D.,"Los Angeles, CA",144,363,3620,2.0,2/21/2014,"The past several times I've been here, both the food and the service have been awful. There aren't enough waiters and this last This last time it took 45 minutes to get our food. The mahi tasted fishy and they've added lettuce and carrots to the mix. Not a good addition for warm food.   My friends hamburger patty was in pieces and was not a very good hamburger. When we ordered dessert they were out of the peanut butter pizookies. I won't be going here voluntarily again."
Lisa R.,"Valencia, CA",8,12,,4.0,10/24/2015,Love the fresh mozzarella salad!! It's the best thing item I could eat several plates of it.
Sally H.,"California City, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2016,"This place has one of the worst services I have received in a while. You're better off going to Buffalo Wild Wings. Waiters and waitresses are somewhat rude. We got there on a not very busy evening and we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated even though there were a lot of empty tables. Then they forgot to assign us a waiter and we had to wait for 20 minutes before  we asked if someone was going to take our orders. Then the guy said he was not our waiter and we told him we don't have one. About an hour after being seated we got our food. Shortly after we asked for our check and she brought it within 10 minutes but took her over 15 minutes to come pick it up. I don't know about other locations but this one, I will not be returning to or recommend to anyone. It's a shame because the food is not bad and is fairly priced but not worth almost 3 hours of your day."
Scott W.,"Palmdale, CA",6,126,126,2.0,6/24/2014,Good ambiance  Food was poor at best bacon cheeseburger n fries. Burger was way under cooked fries were limp. The burger was so greasy it soaked my bun which fell apart From now on. I'm sticking to beer and flatbread pizza
