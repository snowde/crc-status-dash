Denise D.,"Lancaster, CA",1,8,,2.0,2/20/2017,"I usually really enjoy BJ's for lunch ,dinner or just apps and a drink. Today, not so much. Our table was greasy, the menus were grubby and the napkin kinda had a weird ""old oil"" smell.  My husband and I both ordered the California chicken club sandwich with an added ceasar salad. Our sandwich arrived by itself on a plate( usually has fries ) we had to ask for the salads and fries. The sandwich usually is fried with a crunch like a grilled cheese. The sandwich was soggy and super greasy.  The waitress really tried hard to please when she realized the order got messed up and we tipped her well for her attention but the food and grease REALLY TURNED ME OFF. We will try again another day- if it is as bad we will not return"
Daniel M.,"Palmdale, CA",0,12,,1.0,7/22/2016,"I have no express my experience with bjs app and there offer for ""20% off using the bjs app""  First off, it doesn't work. I go and pay with PayPal, says ""error, payment didn't go through"" so I try again ""error, payment didn't go through"" I try again using just my credit card and not PayPal, it goes though. This morning I got an alert on my phone saying BJs took out money 3 times. Missing $26 through paypal TWICE. This is not okay, if your going to advertise an app, make sure it works before you put it out there. Really upset about this. Wish I could just be refunded altogether, because going through my bank and waiting almost an hour just to speak with someone is absolutely ridiculous when it's bjs fault. Fix your app."
Running W.,"Lancaster, CA",17,12,,1.0,10/6/2016,I highly suggest that if you choose to spend your money at this location just place it in a shoe box and burn it! The reason being is horrible service and a manager that cares less and lets it happen. Once again they ruined my birthday dinner on 10-4-16 and it was not even busy! The server kept forgetting our drinks and continued to be one lousy peace of work. After 45 min I had to ask the manager where my food was and it came out by far I had better spaghetti and meatballs in the military. Also I asked to taste the octoberfest beer and the server kept blowing me off! I asked three times. We went to this location 6 years ago and the same crap cold food and crappy service! Stay clear away from they place!
Samantha C.,"Palmdale, CA",53,8,,1.0,6/26/2017,"I can honestly say I'm not that big of a fan of the food here but today I decided to do it for lunch. I chose the option for curbside pick up which is behind the building oddly instead of the front or side where it would be easier for the waiters to bring the food. The sign for the curbside tells you to call the number listed and that they would come right out. I tried calling this number 18 times. For it to tell me it's busy and to try back later. I assumed that would be the store number. So I didn't try to look up a different number. Then after sitting there for 15 mins. I decided to look them up. To my surprise there was another number. I called and spoke with a woman and started to tell her about the issues with the number listed. She cut me off to say that isn't her problem with attitude. Said it doesn't usually do that so it must be a problem with my phone. She than proceeded to ask my name so she can pull my order. I stated and name and said my food it gonna be cold. Her words were well it's been in under the warmer so it will be fine. She brought out my food and took my card to go back inside to run my payment. I noticed as she went to do that, that my grilled cheese was solid. And nasty. That the soup I ordered had already started to get chunky from being cold. I also noticed I didn't receive the fries that came with the sandwich. So when she brought me my card I stated to her, the fries were missing. Her response was oh well it doesn't come with them. I corrected her and said yes. Because when I ordered online it didn't give me the option to not get them. She than said well than you online must have messed up. Not my problem. I guess I'll go grab you some. She came back and the fries were cold. But at this point I was so done, I just wanted to leave and not come back. I get things happen. And it can't be perfect. But this was ridiculous. I can say one of my worse. I got to BJ's at 2:50pm, I didn't leave there until 3:22pm. For CURBSIDE pickup."
Susan S.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/5/2017,"Bjs is not the first place we think about going to eat in this city due to past bad service incidents. We listened to our pizza loving son to go there, but today was by far the worse service and will be the last time I ever go to bjs in Palmdale! First we were asked for phone number to get a text message when our table would be ready and they didn't seat us after 10 minutes of getting the text our table was ready. I even asked the hostess I got the text is our table ready after getting up from where we were waiting. So after we get seated we have the waiter come and get our drink order after a good 10 mins there, so we tell him we are ready to order, he says sure he took down our order. After about 20 minutes our food comes my son was already asking why are they taking extra long to bring our food, so the waiter brings my sons pizza and lemonade and usually we argue with my son not to finish all the lemonade so fast today he said it tasted weird and it kind of did, later after 10 mins my food comes and he mumbles to my husband  there was a mishap with your order it'll be right out, I wanted to wait to eat with my husband but my food was getting cold he brought over some ranch and didn't say a word to where the burger was at, at this point we are all upset I didn't even have two bites of my food we had to get up and leave we had already lost our appetite so we got up and my husband spoke to the hostess and manager came over now she was justifying her employees but we were done. Honestly this visit to bjs felt a racist since we got there."
Mike G.,"Valencia, CA",0,22,,1.0,7/12/2017,"Sitting at the bar and the wife orders a mini pizza, it comes out Cold and half cooked sent it back and 20 mins later it comes out hot and cooked. Nobody ever asked how the food was? Service Sucked."
Nelson S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/1/2017,"Great place to eat, been here a couple times and the beer  selection is great. Atmosphere is also very good. I would recommend to come here for a beer and some dinner"
FourThumbs D.,"Palmdale, CA",2,68,44,2.0,10/19/2016,"I don't drink so I'm not rating that.  The food is good, but slow.  The service is really slow.  There is one waiter dripping sweat, literally, all the time.  Pretty gross to look at and glad he hasn't brought out my food ever.  The dessert is really good, and wait isn't bad."
John D.,"Palmdale, CA",85,6,,1.0,1/28/2017,Worst visit ever to a restaurant . I've been waiting for 2 hours now and still waiting. When we asked how much longer we were quoted 2 hours from the original 50 minutes I was told. I'd review on the service but seeing as how I've yet to be seated...
Jennifer T.,"Lancaster, CA",0,14,1,1.0,4/17/2017,My first time ever there and it was a very bad experience. We arrived at 11pm an hour before closing so that might have been why their service and food wasn't at its best. My food was cold and my steak was well done when I asked for medium rare. We ordered dessert but didn't get it until after our checks arrived when our waiter realized that he never dropped off the desserts. Not only that but our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and seemed frantic. Definitely not planning to go back.
Scott D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,20,,2.0,7/19/2017,"I am on business travel and was craving the Santa Fe salad I usually get back home most weeks.  I was able to grab a seat at the bar and was served quickly around 7pm on a Tuesday. The salad came out after a reasonable time.  However, the salad barely resembled what I am used to. Being a national chain, I expect it to be same at each location.  This salad was missing avocado, had way too much corn, the lettuce was soggy and the ""grilled"" chicken seemed soggy like it was microwaved (no grill marks at all).  Also, the corn and tomatoes were almost definitely out of cans, which I hate the flavor of. The location I usually go always has fresh tasting lettuce and veggies.  That being said, I did not complain at the time because I was hungry.  I was served relatively quickly for a crowded place, but I did notice several others at the bar waiting for drink refills or to tab out while the two bartenders chatted away.  I don't think I'll waste my time here again while I'm in town. You can almost see a Yard House from here that always has fresh food. My 2¢"
Kat M.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,7,6,2.0,7/18/2017,"Had dinner there Sunday night and not a good experience. Over 2 hours there. And not intentionally.  We had to ask to have empty dirty dishes removed 3 times.  Bus boy just kept walking by like he was in a daze.  After dinner, desert was ordered.  We were told a few times that ""They are working on it"".  After 40 minutes, it finally came.  Our original server we had went on break after we ordered and never came back.  So, the poor girl filling in had several table.   Very poor Mgmt."
Nichole E.,"Lancaster, CA",77,64,170,4.0,4/28/2015,"I have been coming to this BJ's since they opened however many years ago when it was one of the first nicer restaurants in the AV. Milestone birthdays, graduations, etc. have all been celebrated at BJ's. I can honestly say that I have always had good experiences here and never really encountered any problems. The hosts are always cheerful, the staff is always pleasant, and the food always meets my expectations.  They have a pretty good Happy Hour. Personally, I don't drink but the little appetizer deals they have are reasonably priced and delicious. I recently signed up for their email club thing and I occasionally receive fairly good deals. The Avocado Egg Rolls are incredible, a must try if you haven't already. My absolute favorite dish is the Chicken Alfredo with angel hair pasta. I can literally eat my weight in that stuff, it is dangerously addictive! My parents always get the Buffalo Chicken pizza and that is pretty good as well.  And oh yeah, PIZOOKIES! Whoever can go to BJ's and not order a Pizookie has some serious self-control. I am not even ashamed to admit I can devour one of those babies solo. As long as the food and service are consistently exceptional, I will continue to frequent this BJ's location."
Catheryn N.,"Lancaster, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/9/2017,"Ever since BJ's has been under new management I can honestly say that many improvements have been made! The servers seem very friendly and happy to be working in such an invigorating environment! The food comes out promptly and never have I had to send anything back. Just this past Friday, 01/06/2017, I was there with a friend and everyone seemed be at the top of their game! From the hosts, to the servers, to the bussers, everyone seemed to be moving with a purpose but maintaining a professional and attentive demeanor. I'd like to acknowledge Isaac, for greeting my friend and I as soon as we walked in and always having a smile on his face and an A+ attitude! definitley an asset to the team and I'd be crazy not to recommend the new and improved BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse! Great Job Team! Keep up the good work!"
Jared N.,"Henderson, NV",268,546,370,3.0,8/17/2016,"I came here for lunch with a gift card. I was seated fairly quickly as the lunch crowd was building. I already knew what I wanted for food and drink. I ordered a hefeweizen and a bacon, avocado, tomato grilled cheese with havarti. It took about 25 minutes for my sandwich to come out. Its a grilled cheese sandwich, people. It should not have taken so long. I should have accepted the ahi salad that was brought to me but meant for another table. At least I would have eaten sooner. It may well have been better than my sandwich anyhow. The sandwich was subpar. The toast tasted of rancid oil. The bacon and avocado was good and the tomato acceptable. That toast though, no bueno. Also, the garlic lemon aioli dipping sauce wasn't quite as advertised. I tasted neither garlic nor lemon. There was something pungent I picked up on. Then I got a chunk. It was bleu cheese dressing. Bleu cheese doesn't settle well with me so I had to set it aside. The best part of lunch was the hefeweizen and the potato wedges. For that, 3 stars. For the rest, I'll pass next time."
Harry P.,"Palmdale, CA",70,46,20,5.0,10/28/2016,Berta is a wonderful server !! She was so nice and pleasant and my daughter just loved her. She'll definitely be our new server when we come eat here.
Leslie D.,"Palmdale, CA",28,47,290,4.0,4/27/2016,We've eaten here on several occasions and the food has been great. Today I I had a bowl of their spicy chili and half triple decker sandwich.  Both were delicious.  The service was fast and the staff is friendly.
Kimo S.,"Napa, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/23/2016,Food was amazing.... I was more impressed with our waiter then anything. Paul was the most attentive waiter I've had since moving to Lancaster 6 months ago.
David D.,"Abilene, TX",0,3,,3.0,6/25/2017,Was in for dinner and obviously the beer was the same as across the rest of the country. Had the Calamari which came out promptly and it was the best part of the meal. Then I ordered the lemon thyme chicken with rice. The chicken had way too much lemon pepper and when I chewed the rice it was like chewing rocks well undercooked. Will always go back for beer.
Alice C.,"Palmdale, CA",1851,280,506,1.0,1/9/2016,"No words can say how bad the service was four  people at the table order drinks and every things else went down hill after that our food did not show up until we ask  for the manager the pizza was cold every item seem as if they put the food under a heat lamp and toss  on a plate ,the waitress was to busy talking with her co worker to come back to the table , BJ in Palmdale  CA needs to be close down  the bathroom was very dirty we told the manager how bad it smell  and the look on his face was really as if this was not the first time someone told him that,I have been in other Bj Palmdale is the worst never again I will put a call into the corporate office on  Monday and  email the photos of the nasty restroom"
