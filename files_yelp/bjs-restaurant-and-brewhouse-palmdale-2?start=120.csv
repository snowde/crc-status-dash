Janet A.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,114,193,4.0,5/14/2015,"Food is really good here; pizzas are delish, their spinach artichoke dip is divine, and because I'm 1000% sure there are 49492929 other reviews on their pizookies, I'll just leave you guys with this: BOMB.  Their bourbon w/ ginger ale was very smooth and tasty. Will definitely have more of those in the future. Need to try more on the drink menu.  Service is generally good.  I really appreciate that this place is open until midnight. Usually in the AV, everything is closed by 10 PM. Another reason why single 20-30 year olds shouldn't live out here. Eh..."
Brigette R.,"Lancaster, CA",0,12,2,5.0,4/20/2017,"Came here on the 17th of April it was my gf's 21st birthday so decided to take her and a friend to eat, I have to honestly say the service we received really amazed me. A lot of the restaurants here in the AV don't give you the very best but average service. But going on, I could tell my waitress was not feeling so good seemed like she was a little sick but that didn't stop her from giving us good service she checked up on us and give us refills and actually smiled all the time even tho she wasn't feeling good! I know when I'm sick I don't even wanna see the sunlight! Food was good as well! I wish I could of kept the receipt to recommend this waitress!"
Todd C.,"Valencia, CA",0,2,,3.0,6/10/2017,I usually eat at the bar and find a service to be very well. Tonight we decided to eat in the restaurant area and were told 15 minutes and we waited 30 minutes. It took us almost 30 minutes to get our food. The food was mediocre. The service was very slow. I guess every restaurant has an off night.
Angelina L.,"Covina, CA",380,362,464,4.0,2/3/2015,"I come here every week for happy hour. The prices are good for hh pizza of you get the hand tossed because it's the same size as the individual which is very large for $6. The wings aren't worth it because they give you a half order for half the price. Wines are half price on Tuesdays as well. If you get a refillable drink, you can ask for a cup to go too.  I also like potato skins but they're a hit or miss..sometimes coming out warm and overcooked."
Ernest V.,"Edwards, CA",7,6,17,2.0,9/28/2016,"I had my going away there two days ago.  Consensus was; staff was courteous.  After that, the food quality was so poor.  We were told we had to do their buffet due to the size of our party.  I don't recommend their buffet.  The pizza was mostly bread.  Their pizzas outside of their buffet pizza is great so I feel their buffet pizza...they don't take great care in.  Their pasta was all pasta.  Very little meat. I've never had such an issue with their food there before.  We had a party of 30 and everyone I talked to was dissatisfied with the food.  I would have rather them let us order what we wanted instead of them forcing us to do their buffet.  I recommend taking larger parties elsewhere."
Metutis D.,"Lancaster, CA",2,9,36,3.0,6/7/2015,"We came here to celebrate my sons 16th Birthday the service was awesome . Unfortunately I can't give more starts because the food my plate was awful !  I asked for the New Orleans jambalaya it didn't taste like nothing no flavor and the shrimp,sausage and chicken looked boiled and not stir fry.  I asked our waiter to please ask in the kitchen to cook it well done but when the came back with the plate it was pretty much the same ! Not a good dinner sucks"
Katherine R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,6,,3.0,10/26/2016,I love bjs and the environment but OMG the wait here is ridiculous. The food has come cold a couple of times which is crazy to me because We've waited over an hour to receive our food. The waiters are always so nice! & although we have trouble with our food I love the place they need to work on there kitchen staff there work sucks & they need to get better. Its just ridiculous that I spend almost 60 to 70 dollars & the food isn't as great as it should be. However the manger was so nice and made sure our food came out hot the SECOND time.
Erica D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",9,10,3,1.0,10/2/2016,Food took almost a hour to come and then my quinoa was frozen and my chicken pita tacos had 6 tiny cubes of chicken. After waiting that long for food I expected to get edible food
Heather G.,"Palmdale, CA",31,8,,1.0,11/21/2016,"Worst service EVER!!! We were there on a thursday (so  not crowded). We were there for more than 2 hours.  The appetizer came after the meal (after we had been there for over an hour already). The waitress said she would send the manager over to discount it,  and never did.  They brought my husband the wrong salad,  then someone brought him the correct one,  and then another correct one...then when she realized he had 2 salads,  she asked me if I wanted it because she was just gonna throw it out anyway,  then she charged me for it! Our drinks were never refilled.  Just an awful all around experience.  We will never go there again."
Sonny B.,"Quartz Hill, CA",1,26,19,4.0,3/20/2016,"One of the best restaurants in town. They have lots of beers and dishes. I love the Jeremiah red beer. We always order best beginnings. The staff is really nice. They offer rewards program, which is an incentive. We have been coming here ever since restaurant opened. Keep it up."
Zach G.,"Olathe, KS",173,1128,221,4.0,11/6/2015,"I've been coming to this BJs location for years, and always enjoyed it. Having always sat at the bar as a solo business traveler, my interactions are pretty much all with the bartenders, but they have always been great - friendly, efficient.  The beers range from ""okay"" to really very good. It completely depends on what you like, and what you get. The food is generally quite tasty, and I highly recommend their happy hour food deals. In particular, I really do like their wings - even though I love spice, they come (by default) with just a dash of hot sauce on them, and it's the perfect amount to still bring out the taste of the chicken. But, no matter what I've ordered here, I have always been satisfied.  The restaurant itself is clean, and comfortable. Parking is easy and plentiful."
Yadira S.,"Lancaster, CA",12,1,1,1.0,10/11/2015,"Chowder was good but the bread bowl was not cut out right asked waiter for refill on chowder and said that they couldn't do anything literally it was only 5 spoon fulls and it was done... very disappointing :/... My daughter's drink was refilled with water, accidents happen but that just had my child waiting extra time above what she'd waited for already. The worst of it all is that we brought customers (our friends)to this restaurant telling them wonders about the soups in the bread bowls, and unfortunately disappointed and unsatisfied customers in the end."
David D.,"Palmdale, CA",302,4,3,5.0,7/7/2016,"I went to BJ'S restaurant with a few friends last week and had a gifted server! He literally blew us away! Our drinks stayed full, he knew the menu better than we could read it, and he helped me decide the best appetizers and entrees for my entire group. Not only that he recommended this beer that I ended up really enjoying which was a mix of 2 which was the harvest hefty and Jeremiah red. This guy knew his stuff and ended up giving my entire group a wonderful night with extremely good service. When I go back I will make sure I always sit in his section. His name was Kevin! Thanks dude you were legit!"
Shawn C.,"Lancaster, CA",34,1,,5.0,10/18/2016,Issac was an amazing server. Very polite and courteous made dinner a little more enjoyable with his awesome personality. Thanks Issac catch ya next time.
Mike E.,"Arlington, VA",153,34,129,4.0,2/15/2015,"My first time here at BJ. Food was ok wasn't anything spectacular. We ordered a small ultimate pepperoni deep dish pizza and spinach and artichoke dip.we also ordered a pazookie that took over 35-40 minutes for them to bring it to us. I didn't understand why it took so long... But other than that it was ok, not a 5 star restaurant tho 02/16/14 The manager Steve got in contact with me after my initial review and with that I had to change my rating!! He was very concerned about my issue and the fact that he read my review said a whole lot about him. He really cares about his customers. He apologized for my wait and explained why we had to wait so long for the pazookie. I just want to say thank you Steve! and to anyone that's in the Palmdale CA area go visit BJ's."
Ginny L.,"Chino, CA",0,25,17,5.0,11/18/2015,"We stopped in for lunch and enjoyed a wonderful meal.  Excellent selection to chose from...we landed on soup and salad.  It was delicious. Check out their garlic knots - yummy! While the food was good we'd be remiss if we didn't highlight for you the excellent service we received from Susana.  Remarkable attentiveness, friendly and all around fantastic.   Susana, THANKS for making our dining experience wonderful! BJ's is fortunate to have you on their team."
Drea H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,43,6,5.0,6/2/2016,"Great Service at this location!!  Special thanks to Martin one of the managers there! I go with my husband once a week, and he is always very helpful and courteous! He represents the company well! I recommend this location to anyone."
Kathleen H.,"Palmdale, CA",2,91,18,5.0,11/16/2015,"I must be a dessert person because the main draw for me here are the pizookies! If you haven't had one, go get yourself one. :) A pizookie is a barely cooked cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. So the cookie is served still warm and the ice cream starts to melt into it and it just ends up being this warm lump of sugary heaven. :)  I also love their avocado egg rolls. My husband loves the Parmesan chicken and the balsamic chicken.  I am part of their rewards program and they are very good about getting back to you when you have a problem. Good people."
Sal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",293,1582,2037,3.0,11/18/2013,"Came here to have a few beers before going next door to watch UFC167 in the big screen. They have a pretty good beer called Jeremiah Red, been getting it the last few visits and never disappoints, what did disappoint is that when asked about having a screen changed from a tv western show to actual sports (which were the prelims) my server Sara said no, we don't show any type of fights, I understand that may be policy but who would want to watch a western with no sound to a actual sporting event? I just think it was a small request that would have kept me buying more drinks and some food. It's a sports bar besides being a restaurant. This place and the yardhouse I find it kinda lame for providing half entertainment. As for Sara she did a great job asking if we were ok on drinks and would check up on us a few times. I just feel that the crowd isn't going to get rowdy if we see a few tackles and knockouts, and football is the same thing just MMA has less protection...."
A M.,"Lancaster, CA",0,14,,1.0,4/2/2017,"Have been coming here since this location opened. Use to be great service. Now everytime we come the customer service is worse, managers dont seem to care. Came again tonight waited 15 min before someone walked up and askes if anyone helped us. Once we said no we were offered water or something cause our waiter was on break. ok. . down only to be told our food hasnt been started yet and is up next. After 45min food comes. Ziti pasta had way under cooked noodles,roll was burnt, riast beef dip was split all over. Horrible services."
