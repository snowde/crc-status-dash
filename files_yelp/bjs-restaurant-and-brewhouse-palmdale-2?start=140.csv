Always excellent service and awesome for Happy Hour! :) Only thing I would recommend is better tasting ranch."
Leah D.,"California City, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/28/2016,"My husband and I have recently added BJ's to our ""frequent places to eat list"" because their food is consistently delicious. We always start with their boneless wings with the spicy pepper BJ's wing sauce. The sauce is fantastic and they are breaded and cooked to   husband really enjoys the flat bread pizza. And I take on the carbs with the pan style pizza. We are always more than happy with the food and the service is pretty good too.  And then this week we had the Jacob experience! When we were seated, I noticed our server was handling between 10-15 tables. When he came to introduce himself and take our drink order he was friendly and did not seem stressed AT ALL with the amount of tables he was working. I am in love with the infusion peach tea while my husband loves their house root beer. From the jump, Jacob was SUPER!! He is like the super hero of servers! When I asked for extra ranch for the wings (I am a sauce-aholich) Jacob brought me a LARGE side of ranch (typically servers bring an itty-bitty ramekin). He understood what I meant when I told him I needed a lot of ranch. I have a tendency to drink a lot of tea especially with a spicy dish. Jacob refilled me about 5 times, never going a minute without a drink! He even hooked us up with drinks to go when we were finished. He checked in with us the perfect amount of times (not an annoying amount) throughout our dining experience.  He is a great server...and he is super nice! He is the type of person you would want to hang out with. He goes that ""extra mile"" several times throughout your dinner. I will suggest BJ's as a great place to get good food, and certainly refer Jacob as a server!"
Christine C.,"Brookline, NH",26,8,8,4.0,11/20/2015,"Having a later dinner after a long day of travel. Great, upbeat, casual place to unwind. Extensive beer selection including several house brews. Food is fresh, quantity is sizeable, and service is very friendly. Plan for a wait on busy nights!"
Diana G.,"Goleta, CA",0,5,,3.0,2/16/2017,This is one of my favorite places and this place the hostess was not pleasant the waitress was ok but it felt like she was forced to be friendly not genuine !! Disssppointed in service food was ok !!
Armando P.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,189,428,4.0,7/29/2014,"Came in right after a movie on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated as soon as we walked in and were greeted with friendly service. No wait for 7 of us - Nice! I had a Tatonka stout, so delicious. We also ordered a couple of pizzas. A vegie lovers and a pepperoni for the kids.  Both were super yummy and cooked to perfection. The service provided by the waitress was superb.  The cool thing about this place is that it's located right next to a movie theatre so you can get some drinks before or after a movie and not have to drive anywhere."
K G.,"Lancaster, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/8/2017,"Every time I go in with a big crowd we're taken care of efficiently. The service is great as well, my friends I are sat in Jacobs section often and he does his best every time, impeachable work from that young man and for that reason we continue to go. Thank you Jacob."
Briana B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,18,23,3.0,8/10/2016,I come to BJs almost once a week to pick up two regular size pizookies with my boyfriend. I've never had a problem before which is why I always go back! However tonight I got THREE mini pizookies and was highly disappointed on the amount of ice cream that it came with. Barely enough for one by itself.
Evelyn M.,"Valencia, CA",4,19,15,5.0,6/20/2016,I love BJS they have a good selection on their menu. I ordered some late night take out & it was so FAST. Thank you Jonathan for being so nice & giving me great service.
Nicole V.,"Malibu, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/11/2017,"Okay, I feel the need to write this review now because I don't think it is fair that anyone else experience what I did. So I made a reservation 2 days ahead of the date I needed for a party of 18 and I was assured a spot for 7pm which was perfect. My party consisted of adults & 3 kids. When I called on the day of the reservation the hostess on the phone assured me that my table would be ready and there was a 10 min window. Having this info I let my friends and family know that it was good to head on over there at 7. Well, we arrived at 7pm and the hostess said my table wasn't ready and it would be a 25min wait. Long story short after about 50 minutes of waiting to be seated when I have made a freaking reservation the manger assured me that they were doing they beat they could. At this point I was furious. The little ones we're hungry & exhausted and my birthday dinner at this point was ruined. They finally got their crap together after an hour of waiting and complaining and got our party a table. The service was okay. I was not impressed. The manager did comp my meal & the kids meals (which was the bare minimum) but what really ruined the night after all the crap we had already gone through was that my BIRTHDAY pazoki never came out, no one sang happy birthday, my waitress never showed up again & I had to ask another waiter for my birthday Pazoki to go. I was so upset and disappointed. Lesson learned for that day: BJs doesn't care if you make a reservation or not. And they clearly can not handle large parties."
Kylie M.,"Palmdale, CA",20,4,,5.0,7/31/2016,"I've been coming here for years and actually stopped coming here for a while because the service was so outrageously bad. Friends of mine also told me what bad service they had been receiving here as well, so I knew it wasn't a coincidence. My friend and I decided to come back today after almost a year of not coming and let me just say I was pleasantly surprised. Dominic was our waiter and he was incredible. My drink was never more than half empty, he made sure our food came out exactly in the order we wanted. Everything was correct. He was very friendly and wonderful. Because of Dominic I will start coming back. Hopefully now all the servers are as wonderful as he is."
Jazmin Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,5,,3.0,6/26/2016,The service is good. The food on the other hand is gross aside from a few salads and appetizers. More of a bar than an actual restaurant. Food tastes like it is microwaved or boiled bags of precooked entrees.
Paul W.,"Ridgecrest, CA",82,21,10,5.0,6/18/2016,Had the best experience at BJ's today. Our server boni was the absolute best waiter we have ever had. He made the experience worth the trip. The food was the same always but he made it all better. Thanks to such a wonderful man.
Vyonnee S.,"Lancaster, CA",40,19,21,4.0,2/22/2016,Victoria and I went there had brunch together food was excellent I was impressed with the quality of the service highly recommended
Ital C.,"Palmdale, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/16/2015,"Stopped late on way home. Bartender was friendly and drinks were good. Had tavern pizza , food came out hot and was good choice ..  They are open late"
Tammany F.,"Lancaster, CA",132,164,,2.0,12/29/2016,"Well, what a shame. We haven't been there in a while and we go and there were a few people waiting and we were told about a ten minute wait. We agreed and get taken to a table finally. We notice many,many empty tables so why the wait. Then our waitress finally  comes and she was terrible. Did not know her menu well at all and when I asked for white zinfandel, she said she didn't know if they had that and would have to ask.She brings my husbands tea with no sugar except fake sugar. I waited about 5 minutes more for my wine. She takes our order and my husband tell her no chipolet on the Avocado burger I don't like spicy. She takes my order and off she goes. People who ordered after us were getting their orders before ours which we thought odd. Not once did she come and check on us and it ended up that their were Jalapeno's on the burger and by that time my husband ran out of tea and was on fire. She never came back until we were nearly done. He mentioned that their were jalapenos which made the burger unpleasant to eat. She argued you said no Chipolet and we said nothing spicy. She should have said exactly what this burger had on it. Then my Spaghetti was also spicy like it was seething with siracha. Never asked if we wanted desert either. I have always love this place and now I am greatly disappointed. 39.32 of mega displeasure."
Karim A.,"Lancaster, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/14/2017,"This is not a great place to eat, if youre looking for a place to drink and chill with friends then this might fit you. All what is on the menu to eat are salads. When people go out to eat they would like to try new foods not eat a salad which they make themselves at home. Yesterday i ordered the fresh alasken salmon that shit had no flavor at all it seemed the chef missed a some few ingriedients, the presentation of the food was mediocre, the salmon itself wasnt soft didnt know anyone would cook a piece of salmon to a crisp, the salmon is suppose to be like butter not a rock just the whole mix veggies and brown rice put together with salmon does not mix they took the whole trend of eating organic and healtheier to a whole new level of disgusting ingriedents."
Sukhi S.,"Lancaster, CA",1,4,3,2.0,5/13/2015,"Went to this location just got done eating today 5-13-15 to sum up the night it was terrible service with alright food. The server we had, Jessica, first started off by bringing a beer to the table that was full of foam and when I asked to have it filled to the top like a beer should, she argued with me telling me that's how that beer comes. The second beer she brought me was foaming over the class and she did not even attempt to wipe it down. Future into service she did not refill water cups properly and even had us wait for 15 minutes for just one water. I had to ask several times for water to be refilled at the table. Overall I am dissatisfied with the service and I think the manager should take a second look at their employees"
Brittany H.,"San Fernando, CA",52,11,3,5.0,6/1/2016,I have been meaning to write this for 6 months now. I had my wedding dinner here in December on a Friday at 3 pm with about 50 people . Let me tell you they were on there game . Everyone's food came out at the same time are drinks were never empty and they even served us are wedding cake . They were absolutely amazing and I can't thank them enough for making that dinner less stressful for me .  I have been back twice since and it never disappoints
Jenny R.,"Palmdale, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/30/2017,"Jacob is a great server! We go in usually with a party of 10 and he is always friendly, quick, and attentive."
David N T.,"Lancaster, CA",24,10,6,4.0,8/2/2016,Best pizza in the business great place to get together with friends and family my brother spends every birthday there
