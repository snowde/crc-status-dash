Missy G.,"Lancaster, CA",19,34,11,3.0,4/27/2015,"First time here in few years. Was Sat immediately but waited about 10to 15 minutes to be greeted.  Once the server came he was nice and attentive.  Took a while to get appetizers and drinks but seemed it was on the kitchen and bartending end. Bonifacio gave fast refills and got anything we asked for that he could quickly.  Always came by to see how we were doing.  Just needs to learn how to answer the question about ""what is popular or good here?"".  Other than that, great server. Son got rack of ribs which he loved, my shrimp scampi was good, not great and my Husband enjoyed the Mahi Mahi. I would have given the food a four star but couldn't because of the wait from the kitchen.  Gotta say, they were busy.  The food was good but not worth the $96 dollars we spent for 3 meals.  The pizza looks amazing and looks great for apps and drinks but not a family dinner place. I will be back with my hubby for a drink and to taste the pizza!"
Dianna L.,"Rosamond, CA",17,26,17,1.0,7/26/2015,"Don't care for microwaved lettuce on my sandwich. Also, if you are going to go to the trouble to ask for grilled onions to be well done, please make sure they are on the burger! So after the second burger came with onions they were barely cooked. Not a happy customer."
L A.,"Lancaster, CA",0,9,,5.0,1/22/2017,"Coming from a family with kids and also with diet restrictions, we are very happy with our overall experience at the Palmdale CA BJs. They always allow the kids to get different sides or whatever it may be without a fuss or charging more. There are so many choices for everyone in the family including for my restrictions. And I enjoy their loyalty program. It's easy to earn and use points. They tell you up front what you have and can get. I think the only one thing I would suggest is giving mints or chocolates with the check.  Let management know little things like that really make a difference."
Liane R.,"Lancaster, CA",4,26,22,5.0,5/7/2016,"Shout out for great service and delicious food! Grabbed the soup and salad lunch special - best clam chowder found inland thus far! Crisp wedge salad - very good - one note: expediters need to read ticket carefully for add-ons like sides of dressing - annoying when someone drops your food without the right order -  Otherwise our waitress was actually bartender Brittany Albertson - taking on an extra shift - way to go Brittany - your cocktail recommendations were spot on - loved the Alabama sunset - my gal pal loved it too but also liked her strawberry mojito! From the moment we walked in and were greeted by hostess extraordinaire Gabby, till we walked out, it was a great luncheon. Kudos to Gabby and Brittany and the chefs - and the management for bringing it all together ! I quit going here for years - overpriced for bad service and so-so food offerings - glad you all changed my mind - Gotta make this my Friday luncheon go-to place! Will be back for dinner, too!"
J N.,"Littlerock, CA",19,60,12,2.0,5/4/2016,Seriously though they are open til midnight we come hours before and are told all sections besides bar are closed for the night? Gimme a break not ok I would understand maybe an hour before shame on your lazy employees some of us don't want to sit in the bar.
Courtney C.,"Palmdale, CA",1,9,6,5.0,7/19/2016,"My husband and I frequent BJ'S almost twice a month. We went this past weekend for my birthday and had our favorites and as always were extremely satisfied. The staff was good, the wait times were low and the bathrooms clean. I have never had  an issue. Also, we found out there is a Pokestop at this particular BJ'S and from our seat, were able to use it for all our dinner. It was a lot of fun!!"
Adam B.,"Castaic, CA",2,39,4,5.0,2/19/2016,I loved the drinks and the food was phenomenal. I had the quinoa salmon and I'll eat it again!  The service was good and the bar scene was really enjoyable. The menu options were fantastic and the drink menu seemed like it was 10 pages long.   I'll be back for that salmon and those great beers! Thanks very much to Monica for her great service!
Kyle K.,"Palmdale, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/29/2016,"Whatever you do in your life, never do two things. Don't ever trust someone who pours their milk before their cereal and never ever ever ever listen to their waiter, Josh, and order a jalapeño-cucumber margarita. If I wanted to be this displeased with my life choices I would simply just go to a Justin Bieber concert with my ex-girlfriend(the crazy one who broke into my house and stole all my lightbulbs) where I'd have my eardrums imploded by thousands of screaming fourteen year old girls. Instead, make a good decision for once in your malicious life and order one or five of their pizookies. Doesn't matter which one. They are all as amazing as Ronald Reagan's eight year presidency. Also their clam chowder bowls ain't half bad."
Angel T.,"Lancaster, CA",2,4,,1.0,6/26/2016,"Don't use the app!!! It doesn't shorten wait time when using preferred waiting list. They keep confusing my bill with other people's tables, it takes them 20 minutes to figure it out when ur done eating and drinking the last thing you want to do is wait around. They don't offer compensation for your loss of time or inconvenience, manager refused my free pazookie because I had A 20 percent off coupon there was nothing but sorries which helps no one for nothing he didn't take anything off or discount anything further. I will never go there again I'd rather go to kinetic brewery. Shame on you BJ's"
Leonard S.,"Palmdale, CA",48,95,266,4.0,1/18/2014,"Yesterday we had dinner for my wife's birthday. There were 7 people in our group which include my two boys. Our server (Robert) came to out table & introduced himself. Right off the bat, he started cracking jokes which made the mood really friendly & fun. He was a great server!!! I wish there were more servers like him which enjoy their job.  We started off with a appetizer platter. It consist of avocado egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, artichoke dip & spring rolls. Everything was hot & tasted really good. My favorite are the avocado egg rolls. Definitely, try them out. I also had a cup of the calm chowder. I think it's one of the best chowder I have ever had. It was really hot which is perfect. There were plenty of clams in the cup.  For dinner, I decided to try the Cajun pasta with chicken & shrimp. I was so full after all the appetizers & my soup. My plate was really full & most important it was hot. I only had a couple bites of my food.  It was really good. I loved the seasonings they used in pasta. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat it all. So, I took most of it home. My wife had the balsamic glazed chicken. She also took her dinner home.  My kids had the chicken Alfredo & the spaghetti. They both finished their dinner. So apparently, they loved it lol. Both my kids really enjoyed their dinner. We finished the night with dessert we had the famous pizookie. Another must have when you come to BJs."
Janelle K.,"Palmdale, CA",11,152,11,4.0,1/19/2016,"Always a great experience when I go here. Staff is friendly, food is delicious, and service moves at an average pace."
Damon B.,"Palmdale, CA",1,21,,5.0,5/11/2016,"Great place to go with my wife, and when the extended family visits. Colorful, classy and great fun and vibrant ambiance! Nice large screen TVs!"
Gisele L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",14,155,304,5.0,5/14/2015,"Love this place and I'm not big on chain restaurants! Always consistent with good food & service. Also their best drink is ""a drink like that"""
Katie H.,"Palmdale, CA",0,31,2,4.0,6/12/2016,"The last couple times I've been there the service has be off par.  Food is good. They are stingy with the beer. Each guest is allowed three small samples of beer for free. My fiance bought a beer and almost finished it before asking if he could do the samples to see which beer he wanted to buy next. The waitress told him no that it would be almost ""double dipping"" and wasn't going to let him. This made no sense since the beer he first ordered wasn't free at all."
Breanna T.,"Lancaster, CA",317,31,19,1.0,1/5/2015,FOOD POISONING ALERT.  My fiancé and I both got sick immediately after eating here tonight ...
Pee V.,"Palmdale, CA",1,67,11,1.0,5/4/2016,This place has really great food and I can't say I won't go back. But the service here especially up front is the worst in any restaurant I've ever been to. And me and my wife eat out 5 times a week at least. This place is loaded with young people who don't want to work. It is visible when you go in. There are more employees sitting doing nothing than working. And I have been here at least 30 times. But we will be going more often to the Yardhouse which has much better service
Heather A.,"Edwards, CA",8,23,29,5.0,5/17/2015,I love this place. From the pizzas to the burgers to the awesome salads and apps. My family and I love this place.
Evan R.,"Palmdale, CA",4,37,15,5.0,7/6/2015,Juicy burgers their ranch is very good and also the secret sauce on the side. I got medium rare and they perfect it how ever you want it. Also had classic desert chocolate chunk. They also have very tasty beer I would recommend the nit wit because its for a limited time only so get it while it lasts. Overall 5stars and family friendly with an 80inch TV at the bar and TVs every table.
Luis G.,"Lancaster, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/23/2016,I ordered the spicy chicken with soba noodles and it was horrible too much damn sauce and it tasted like regurgitated Chinese food never again big waste of $14
Brenda H.,"Lancaster, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/21/2016,"Me definitely thinks not.  I called to make reservations for a party of twelve tonight.  My daughter is celebrating a very special occasion and wanted family and friends to be with her.  I called BJ's and was told by a girl who sounded like Tour Guide Barbie from Toy Story that they were 'full' and unable to accept reservations for a large party (anything over six people).  She said we could just show up and wait to be seated.  She asked me what time we wanted to eat, I said six.  She told me we would be waiting a long time. Is that customer service?  Really?  Too bad, so sad.  Your party is too big and we can't seat or feed you.  Out of all the restaurants in the A.V. - and below - my daughter chose BJ's.  So frustrated and irritated - I called Yardhouse.  A very pleasant young lady told me that they could accommodate our party and we had the choice of the outdoor patio or inside. To me - customers are customers.  Either you're open for business to serve food or not.  You shouldn't discriminate against large parties, or if you seem to have a lot of large parties - maybe you should advertise on your website that these reservations need to be in advance. I will not waste my time at this restaurant again. Apparently you have to give someone a BJ to get a table at BJ's."
