Marcos H.,"Palmdale, CA",17,20,2,3.0,4/3/2016,Anything other than pizza or pazookis is DECENT. Service is slow. Never really any one to refill drinks until you are about to leave. Bathroom whenever I go seem to be as good as mcdonalds bathrooms. (Not so great). Only reason will come here is for pizza. If it was a pizza place it'd be 5 stars. Unfortunately it's not and the other food is decent. Not good. Not bad. Decent.
Cary S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,88,1,4.0,3/30/2016,"I have a client nearby but live down in the SF Valley so I don't get up here much. Every time I have eaten here the service was great, the food was great and the prices were reasonable.  Being over 50 my metabolism has slowed and I will say it is difficult to find anything on the menu with a calorie count reasonable enough that I want to eat it (hint: if you're stuck the calzone is great and well under 1,000 calories).  For an occasional treat, however, the food is very, very good."
Emil B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,36,4,2.0,3/23/2016,"Really disappointed, casue I actually love Bj's. But last night I placed an ordet for pick up with them, 3 pizza's and some salad ($100.00). The salad's were ok...they barely had any chicken. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza had barely any Chicken, part of the slices were actually missing chicken...and hardly any Buffalo sauce......no joke like almost nothing...it really tasted like nothing...just cheese, you can see that they attempted to drizzle some, but decided not to. Last time I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza same thing...and there was no chicken on the pizza. must be the same cook. So disappointing. The Mediterranean Pizza was a little better, but very salty. Mind you it has Feta, Olives, and Pepperoncini's, so that adds...not sure what they did but it was like you are eating salt...a lot of it. I really love this place and always tip good, cause I just like everything about Bj's. I hope someone there reads this and really reevaluates their process, or don't. This is really the second time this happend with their pizza, so I don't think I want to go back and spend my money there...we have many other options."
Greg W.,"Palmdale, CA",57,48,69,5.0,4/19/2015,"The food at BJ's is always consistently good, so is the atmosphere and the service.  They've got great variety and awesome lunch specials.  I'd highly recommend it, if you're looking for great food, great atmosphere, a great environment and the delicious Pazookie dessert....YUM!"
lawrence c.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,5.0,10/1/2015,I Absolutely Dig This Place. I Just Left With My Daughter's Family Coming From Chili's In West Lancaster It Was One Of My Worst Experience I Have Ever Had We Waited Over Half An Hour Just To Get Our Drinks And Another 30 Minutes For Our Food. I Can Honestly Say That The Staff  At BJ'S Where Fantastic And Professional Our Food Server Was Fast And Courteous. From The Inside And Out BJ'S Was A Pleasure To Look At Compared To That Run Down NO SERVICE Chili's In GHETTO West Lancaster.  Please Don't EVER Go There I Wouldn't Wish It On My Worst Enemy....
Paul T.,"Lancaster, CA",1,4,2,5.0,10/2/2015,Best restaurant in the valley. Food is good. We always order Best Beginnings. I love Jeremiah Red beer. Customer service is great. Sometimes Manager personally comes to our table to check how things are. My family loves going there.
Lamar W.,"Orlando, FL",68,31,58,5.0,10/13/2015,"This review really for the service of Marisa. It takes a lot to wow me because of being in the business and my expectations of server staff and the overall guest experience.   A lot of servers can be very relaxed during lunch shifts, but the service I received from Marisa was AMAZING! From start to finish she suggestively pointed me in directions and made it personal as she stated some of her favorites on the menu. I ordered exactly what she told me about and it all was very tasty. And at the end of it was this pumpkin pizookie I normally don't do seasonal items but this thing was life changing! I don't say OMG, but OMG! Lol this thing is the bomb. This is the best overall experience I've had at a restaurant it a while the server did her job 100%! And not only with me but as I watched her interact with all her tables in the section I was impressed. She has to be one of the best servers on the team for sure!  Thank you Marisa !!"
Frankie R.,"Boise, ID",0,22,,1.0,5/29/2016,"This place sucks, bad location.  It is a typical chain restaurant with employees that hate their jobs and their life.  I came in a few after they opened, only 5 tables full,  had to wait 5 minutes to be seated by a wait person who was standing around,  made no sense at all the wait to be seated in an empty restaurant.  The pizza sucks here also, ordered a deep dish pizza, it came in a deep dish pan, with a flat crust and barely any sauce,  BJ's should stop attempting to make pizza or hamburgers,  they always make burgers that fall apart.  The wait staff is borderline rude,  you would get better service from a fast food chain than this place.  The people who come to this restaurant and like it have no idea what good food is.  I guess if your drunk the taste of the food doesn't really matter anyway.  I will never come to this poop hole again."
Nellie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,235,162,1.0,9/7/2015,"I actually feel bad for having to leave 1 star because I have been a customer at this BJ's for almost 10 years now.  I have had numerous celebration dinners here including my high school graduation dinner.  My best friend's birthday was on 9/5/15 and we threw her a surprise birthday dinner here (we also celebrated her 18th birthday here). We had a party of 14. Everything started off fine until our waiter, Domenic, came to the table to take our order. Something was wrong with him. He was bothered, annoyed, frustrated, angry, just plain RUDE!!! First of all, he came to the table rushing us to take our order. I had to tell him numerous times that I wasn't ready yet. As I stated, I've been there plenty of times so I wanted to try something new so I asked him if he tried an item on the menu and his response was just dry and nonchalant, just letting me know I was getting on his nerves. We were thinking at the table maybe he is overwhelmed by our party size because he was working the table mostly by himself. The food took about 20 minutes to come out and it was cold. We weren't going to complain because once again we had a large party so we just dealt with it and we didn't want to have any problems. We just wanted to enjoy our meal. The finally straw happened when my friend stopped Domenic while he was walking by (he never checked on us after the food was served) and he got mad, stopped, looked at her and said,  ""I'm going to take another order, what?"" She was shocked of course and asked for extra dressing. He took over 5 minutes to come back with the condiments. Then someone else at our table asked for water refills then he responded in a nasty attitude, ""Well how many do you need?"" That was it for us! Done! Our waiter was acting as if we were asking for him to go to his house, make our food and bring it back to the restaurant! I was astonished. We started to look around for someone who looked like a manager and we found him. Someone from the table got up and spoke to him about everything that had happened and his response was he was going to take care of it....Well him taking care of it was giving us 2 new waiters. That was it. No type of accommodation for his employee ruining our dinner. He didn't come to speak to our table either. We wanted to order more drinks and dessert but we were scared something would happen to our food so we paid and left.  I have never in my life experienced such unprofessional service. We did not feel welcomed. We felt like a nuisance. I have 400 points in premier rewards so that alone can prove how often I'm in there giving them my money. The 2 new waiters we got were very nice and we wish we had them from the start. I honestly do not know if I'll ever be back and I am sad about it.  BUT I will use my $25 off reward! ;)"
Felipe F.,"Palmdale, CA",2,20,6,5.0,4/12/2015,"Every single time I go I get some amazing customer service! The staff are friendly and helpful. When they removed the spinach n artichoke pizza from their menu, they told me that they can just do it again even though it has been discontinued! Great place! Revised 3.19.17 Initially had a rough start with service , but once our waiter Kevin introduced himself everything changed. He provided probably the best customer service I've ever experienced in my life. The manager Fernando also accommodated us for the inconvenience experienced earlier. This place continues to be a favorite of mine and will continue to be. Once again l, wanted to give a shout out to Kevin and Fernando for their amazing services."
Samantha-Nicole S.,"Palmdale, CA",154,65,55,4.0,10/2/2015,"This place is great! I love bjs I know it's a little expensive but we have always had very good service here. The people are always very nice and even when it's packed the wait isn't very bad. The food is always very fresh and hot , and the pizzookie are to die for ! A must go to for date night."
Niki G.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,33,,4.0,3/23/2016,"I think this place is alittle hit & miss on the food.  I've been here prior (like a year ago) & remembered excellent food, a great beer sampler, enjoyed the environment, didn't recall service being exceptional or service being bad (so good service).   So I returned a couple nights ago. Service was good. But what I ordered this time, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't get it again. I got soup & salad, and it just seemed like the soup was from a can. I saved room for desert - monkey bread - and wouldn't mind going back to get that again. Writing this... I may have to go now & get it!"
Caffeind D.,"Ridgecrest, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/18/2016,Snobby waiters. out of every beer i asked for on their lists. Not trying to be rude. That is what i experienced. Cool atmosphere. Too many tvs
Jeremy S.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/12/2016,"Paul is the best server. We came in tonight and he made us feel welcomed. He showed us the great 8 sampler of beer and we had to get the 16 top. He has such a positive attitude and had a great smile every time he checked on us. You will definitely see us again, thanks to Paul."
Lisa S.,"Palmdale, CA",42,30,25,2.0,9/5/2015,"We took our son and his family here today.  We have eaten at this restaurant several times and rarely had a bad meal. Today was one of those bad days.  I ordered  the southern fried chicken with potatoes and succotash. The chicken, I thought, was undercooked.  It was rubbery and stringy , very odd texture. I had to send it back.  They took 20 minutes and finally brought a completely new plate of food, very nice.  Well, that was just the same.  Yuck! My son ordered a stuffed baked potato that came so hard that he had to cut it with a knife. The manager apologized.  We paid the bill and left. Not sure we will ever go there again."
Kenny R.,"Palmdale, CA",0,8,,2.0,9/1/2016,"Have tried it a couple of time, not impressed at all.  Food usually was either blah or didn't taste good at all."
La Tanya H.,"Naalehu, HI",44,41,73,3.0,7/26/2015,My son ordered a burger 30 minutes  ago and the waitress says it will be 3 more minutes really I'm tired and ready to go so we told them we did not want it most of the tine we like eating here I guess they had to go out and kill the cow to make his burger.. Idk
Rich C.,"Rosamond, CA",48,80,16,3.0,10/22/2015,So every time I come here my order is always in correct. Either it's the wrong fried or something. The food is good just like every other bj and the device is ok. Lunch time is a bear and it seems like they can use a few more waitresses. The people are always very nice and are always there to help you. The two times I complained about my problems the manger fixed it right away. Not too bad but like I said I always have problems. Still a good place for lunch.
Michelle P.,"Lancaster, CA",4,11,3,1.0,10/19/2015,"Last time I came here I was completely ignored, mind you it was a slow night and there was two workers standing there giving me their back at first one was on the phone so I thought okay when she's off she'll help... NOT! She got of the phone and turned around just like the other then continued to look back to check if I was gone or not... I usually enjoy this place but after that night I will not be back..."
Angie V.,"Lancaster, CA",5,40,23,1.0,5/10/2016,"I went to bjs for Mother's Day, my husband and I go all the time. I got the ahi tuna salad and suffered from food poisoning soon after that was the only thing I ate that day including the two apricot seasonal beers that they claimed were a pint each but looked even smaller than the 12 oz glasses I normally get. I'll never go there again. Stay away from their ahi anything"
