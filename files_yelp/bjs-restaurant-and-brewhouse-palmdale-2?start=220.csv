Ben B.,"Lancaster, CA",8,19,19,5.0,2/13/2016,Server rob was great.  We had a patty of 5 and Refilled drinks regularly. Lots of places are bad at refilling drinks. Food was great.  Will come be back.
Nia B.,"Lancaster, CA",86,36,41,5.0,4/24/2016,"Service was EXCEPTIONAL!!!! Our server's name was Britney Lancaster! I only remembered it because I found the humor in her last name! She was incredibly prompt, polite, attentIve, and personable to my seven year old attention seeking son! Our food was amazing, the speed of service surpassed my expectations! In the end we ordered a pizookie, and got the lemon blueberry one, but a chocolate chip came out. Once my son was half way into it I finally took a bite and realized it wasn't the lemon blueberry one and she took care of it for us! I told her it wasn't necessary but she insisted! I felt so guilty because it was so busy at the time and she made it happen. She's such a hard worker. I don't know if the manager reads these or who I can talk to but somebody should acknowledge Miss Lancaster's work ethic! I will be dining again and again requesting for her section because....It. Was. Just. That. Good!"
Danielle G.,"Palmdale, CA",1,18,3,3.0,6/30/2016,It's ok.  Parking is free and walking distance from the movie theatre.
Tina F.,"Tehachapi, CA",0,12,1,4.0,5/24/2015,Went back tonight and had wonderful service. Food was delivered very quick. Hopefully this is the normal. :)
Patty G.,"Palmdale, CA",9,2,,4.0,12/6/2015,Love this place. The ambiance is so nice. The food is great. My husband enjoys his beers and sports games. The waiters are so nice! The pumpkin desert is to die for!
Vanessa A.,"Palmdale, CA",0,36,3,5.0,11/28/2015,The general manager is the best! Always responds to concerned even when you don't ask for a response. The food is great ( the Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken is fabulous!) and the staff is extremely helpful. We ordered online and they actually called me to clarify the order to make sure that it was the way that I wanted. Highly recommend
Renee D.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,5.0,1/27/2016,We had a party of 40 people during a very busy weekend. We could not believe how amazing the food and service was. They beyond accommodated our needs. The buffet choices were great and they were on top of keeping everything replenished and hot. The chicken Parmesan and all of the different pizzas we had were fantastic. The servers were excellent and Steve the manager was top notch from beginning to end. We will be back with our team again.
Darrell H.,"San Diego, CA",9,151,21,4.0,7/1/2014,"In the area for a RC race around the block, but decided to kill some time and watch some Hockey at their bar.  I forgot about how close to LA I was and only realized once I got there how busy it would be. I mean the Kings were in the final games, so why wouldn't it be. After some waiting I decided to squeeze into a spot at the end of the bar. The bartender noticed me right away and took my drink order. My cider came and it was delicious as it always is at BJs. The bartender was busting his ass that night, and even with it as busy at it was he still remembered to check in on me. I did not order any food, so this review is more on the service I got from the bartender. Great job dude."
Phyllis M.,"Palmdale, CA",26,16,1,5.0,8/26/2015,"My favorite place ever. Best food, great drinks, cool atmosphere & decent prices. MUST TRY THE MUDSLIDE!"
Mike D.,"Palmdale, CA",384,349,2091,4.0,7/20/2012,"I read reviews here that are all over the place for BJ's Palmdale so after my first visit (which was good) I decided that I would wait till I had a couple of visits under my belt before passing judgement. Today was my fourth visit and I have not had a problem with the food or service. My first visit was for dinner, I was to meet up with a group of about 8 people. I arrived a little early just as two others in our party were arriving. We  were the first to arrive, reservations had been made and we were immediately seated. The other members of our party soon arrived and although the restaurant was crowded our orders were taken right away. After a fairly short wait considering the amount of patrons our orders were brought to us. I ordered the Cajun Pasta which consisted of blackened chicken breast with a creamy tomato sauce , roasted red peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped Parmesan cheese and green onions. I enjoyed the meal, finding it very flavorful with the chicken being tender and juicy. I only ate half to save room for desert. The waitress came by and boxed what was left of my Cajun Pasta and I ordered the Pizookie which consists of a large chocolate chip cookie in a pan topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. The Pizookie was very good and even though I had only eaten half of my pasta I was unable to finish it, but I did come close.  My next three visits were for lunch after seeing a movie at Cinemark which is right next door. To keep this review from getting too long I will give this blanket statement that will cover these three visits as they were all very similar. I will list all the meals and post photos of them as well. I was seated and waited on quickly. My meals were brought to me quickly, I tried three of their lunch specials and enjoyed them all! Here is a list of my three lunches:  Enlightened Barbacoa Tacos $5.95 (Lunch Special) Corn tortillas filled with spicy, tender barbacoa beef , topped with cabbage, Baja sauce and pico de gallo. Served with black beans and a tangy slaw of shredded cabbage and jalapeno pickled carrots and onions. Chicken Quesadilla $5.95 (Lunch Special) Grilled marinated chicken, green chilies and Jack and Cheddar cheese melted in a crispy tortilla then drizzeld with avocado cream sauce and sprinkled with cilantro. Served with fire-roasted tomato salsa, Baja sauce, sour cream and black beans. Parmesan Crusted Chicken sandwich $6.50 (Lunch Special) Parmesan crusted chicken breast topped with a fresh tomato basil blend and melted provolone cheese with mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and creamy garlic dressing on a toasted French roll.  Served with wedge-cut seasoned fries."
Michelle D.,"Palmdale, CA",0,13,,5.0,2/12/2016,My husband and I go on date night regularly and wind up here.  We love the staff and the food is so good.  Get the pork cheese dip - it's to die for!
Sade S.,"Palmdale, CA",0,16,2,5.0,2/11/2016,"My fave dish here is the Louisiana Jambalaya.. OMG so good! and to finish off with desert, get the Pazooki. I warm cookie topped with ice cream and fudge. Melts in your mouth. Love BJ's."
Benjamin B.,"Richmond, CA",177,332,6,3.0,12/27/2011,"Im going with a 3 star review. . why why why Well ordinarily I would go with a 4 star for bJs!!! but This is palmdale, CA Now I dont want to hate because i did grow up here. But I dont think its because palmdalians dont have good taste. I think its because theyre stuck in the @#$@#$@# desert and dont no better. Its like sush here, sushi here sucks but ppl think its good here. And thats like puttng a japanese person in San Francisco, I know SF aint the bst either....... any ways.  Beer is still legit, good. Foo is ok, its not the best Bjs ive been too. In fact its just sub par,and the service is ok but not 4 star worthy. So i give it a 3. And ppl might rate it higher only cause its palmdale,and they dont know better. Get out of the #$@#$#@$ desert and maybe they can rate it  more accurately. Atleast the Dale now has yardhouse, and claim jumper. PPL here still like to eat besides just being phat asses who go to mc Donalds"
John R.,"Littlerock, CA",16,48,,4.0,2/15/2015,Had a mazing time here yesterday for Valentines day/bday. Wait time was the only thing that kinda sucked but it was understandable. Food was cooked just right and the margaritas weren't watered down. Just took one star off cause they took forever with my pazookie but other than that perfect night.
Scarlet H.,"Palmdale, CA",2,15,3,1.0,1/24/2016,"I have gone here multiple times and it was the spinach artichoke dip that always brings me back but tonight, wow. Tonight I went with my family of 5 and I noticed there was a change. It seemed like once we sat down the waiter kept forgetting about us, it wasn't super busy and there was staff standing around. My mother ordered a soup and I swear the portions were tiny and not worth the price. I ordered the fried chicken like I normally do, it was dry and mushy at the same time. The chicken was disgusting and 3.50 extra if you want a salad included. Jeez! I feel like there just raising prices and giving out less just to make more money. Money is great but not when your giving horrible food and losing customers. Not worth it. Save your money and make a meal at home. Never coming back."
Angi K.,"Acton, CA",6,47,1,3.0,5/5/2014,"Food is good but service needs serious improvement.  Hostesses don't seem to understand that part of greeting customers is listening to them and responding to their questions.  Definitely in need of training. Server tried, but pizza came before appetizers.  Drinks were rarely refilled.  They brought dessert before clearing the entree dishes from our table.  That's just not how it's supposed to be. They really need to train their staff. BTW, the restaurant is very loud also.  If you want a nice, quiet dinner with professional servers, this is not the place to go."
Kalvin P.,"San Diego, CA",237,380,257,4.0,3/1/2014,"BJ's is great! The service is always on point, and the food is delicious. Their pizza is sooo good! It has one of my favorite crusts on any pizza.  Give it a try if you haven't! I haven't tried any of their beers so i'm not sure on those, but it's a cool spot for a nice dinner =]"
Jovil M.,"Lancaster, CA",1,2,,4.0,8/30/2015,"Came into the restaurant yesterday and the service great. I feel bad for not remembering the waiters name, the service was so great. I got the salmon and quinoa , and my lady got the ahi tuna salad. My food was great, and hers was good but a bit over sauced. All around good experience. Will come back."
Ana N.,"Palmdale, CA",12,2,6,5.0,4/12/2015,"One of the things I enjoy very much is the fast service here. By ordering ahead using the bj's app, I am able to get my order in ahead of time, getting the order in to the kitchen as soon as our server gets to the table. No more long waits! The food is usually delicious and they have a broad range from healthy eats to stuff your face and need a nap after type of foods. The kids love coming here for their kids meals but I love coming here for the light meals and the craft beer."
Tegan C.,"Palmdale, CA",4,4,,5.0,3/26/2015,"My family and I have a tendency to come here often! It's one of our main to go places. The waiters and waitresses are always nice and attentive. When it's busy, you will notice them running around or catching a quick breath, we know they work hard and do their best. We enjoy our dinner here every time. Keep up the good work and thank you!
