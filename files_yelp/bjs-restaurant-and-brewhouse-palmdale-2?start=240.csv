Joe T.,"San Antonio, TX",6,20,2,5.0,8/6/2015,"The jambalaya is always awesome, and tonight as no exception. Great service is also the norm, and I wasn't disappointed. Peanut butter pazookie was no quite cooked completely but was edible. Happy hour deals are great and should be taken advantage of if you have a chance."
Matthew L.,"Palmdale, CA",5,3,1,5.0,4/23/2014,"About half the staff was wearing those large black framed non prescription hipster glasses, not a complaint. Just hilarious! Servers are very respectful and check on you not too much but just enough to let you enjoy your meal and keep your beer filled! Their drink menu is fantastic, Appetizers are amazing especially those avocado egg rolls. They have a very wide selection of food, I  recommend the jambalaya, shrimp scampi, buffalo chicken pizza, or any steak really. I can't stop coming here!"
Angela K.,"Long Beach, NY",171,241,190,4.0,2/1/2012,"I just came here with my mother for an early lunch. At this particular location, I really love the customer service of the bartenders, hosts, and the servers. They really lighten up the mood.  We ordered the lunch specials. My mother ordered the unlimited soup and salad for $6.95 and I ordered the Half Flatbread Pizza and Half Salad for $6.95. Both of these lunch special items are definitely a great deal. Unlimited soup and salad 4 stars ++Salad is like a house salad w/ iceburg lettuce, tomatos, croutons, etc with any choice of dressing. She ordered chicken tortilla for the first round and then a clam chower for the second. Chicken Tortilla is sooo yummy. How they serve the soup is pretty cool too. Order the dish and you will see what I mean. Clam chower was on the salty side so my mother had to pour some hot water to it. It may just be that most people eat their soups salty and we have sensitive tastebuds.... Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza and Salad 5 stars ++I can't believe this is only $6.95 at lunch. The margherita fresca flatbread pizza was soooo freakin good. The salad consisted of mixed green salad with a balsamic vinegrette dressing. Very well put together. Our server was pregnant but she was really good and attentive at her job. She was a trooper in making sure our food was great. Anyways I would definitely come back to BJ again whether it's for a drink, lunch, or dinner. It's definitely a great place to eat, talk and be merry. :)"
Stuart M.,"Palmdale, CA",1,9,2,3.0,12/13/2014,"Good food and good atmosphere. Had the Mahi Mahi tacos both grilled and fried, but the cabbage used was way too strong.  Should have went with the burger or pizza.  Other wise this would have been a five star."
Bizie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,40,69,1.0,8/26/2013,Customer service very bad. Easily the worst restuarant to go on a Friday or Saturday night for food and drinks and a good time. The Manager could care less about your night and your party. He doesn't make any accomedations for there negligence.  Yardhouse is a better option.
Chuck K.,"Long Beach, CA",26,233,56,4.0,9/13/2014,"Pretty much like the rest of the chain, the same formula here. Seem like there is always a special at the bar. The drink specials are good but be careful about the appetizers, many are just smaller sized portions, so the deal isn't as sweet as it 1st appears.  The one exception is the mini-pizza, about a 6"" version of BJ's deep dish pizza, that you can get any amount or variety of topping you want."
Tracy O.,"Palmdale, CA",0,9,1,3.0,7/5/2015,"The food is okay, nothing special really.. I always try to give it a chance when I go with friends or family but it never wows me to the point I order something twice. Drinks are on the expensive side."
Nisa R.,"Palmdale, CA",16,97,469,4.0,12/18/2013,"Nice comfortable place where all types of people can come eat and mingle. However I was here on a Friday night for my husband's birthday. And I feel if there was a mixture of up beat Toni Braxton, Sade, type of music it would of been a perfect for a Friday night.I was recommended to this place for their pizza, and pizookie. Pizza I had was suppose to be deep dish. But to me from what I'm use to in Illinois the crust was mainly like a fluffy, airy, pop corn type of crust. Not criticising but it's not what I'm familiar with for a deep dish pizza. There was no tomatoe sauce or little to no cheese on our pizza. Idk if that's how pizza is made in California or what. On another note I will say the pizookie was to die for!!! I will definitely be back for another pizookie. And to try a thin crust pizza next time. I feel this place deserves another chance."
Ruben R.,"Palmdale, CA",87,65,21,1.0,5/1/2015,"I go to BJ's all the time, probably 2-3 times a month. Their service is not consistent at all and when they mess up they don't do anything to make up for it. I arrived with one other person and it took them about 10 minutes to take our order which is fine... But then we waited for an hour and a half to be served. The soda was flat, and so I asked to change it for another drink instead since it didn't taste right and they said they'd swap it out at no extra charge... then I was charged for both drinks at the end. The waiter came back every 20 minutes to let us know the food would be out any second, and that the reason it took so long was because they were just finishing up the salad... As if a salad takes so long to make, at least do not lie to us about why something is taking long. The 2 people next to us had a different waitress and they got there about 10 minutes after us, they ordered, ate, and paid their bill before we were even served. When they finally brought out our food, they forgot half of it. The salad was less than half the normal size, only about 4 bites worth, and they forgot all of our sides saying we didn't order any. I complained so they brought out my side of fruit, with nothing but watermelon and only half filled to the cup. They took back the salad and took another 20 minutes to bring it back fully filled. Another group of people next to us hadn't placed their orders after sitting their for over 30 minutes, and they had the same waiter. Of course the only tip I left was that the food tastes better when it's not served an hour and a half late, that and the extra money they charged me for the flat soda. I was going to wait until the waiter came back to pick up the bill, but after sitting there for 15 minutes waiting for him to come back I had to pay cash and left. Terrible service. If you want good tasting food at better service and prices go to BEX grill or GBGs, anywhere but BJs."
David S.,"Palmdale, CA",3,86,267,5.0,1/15/2015,"We frequent BJ's a few times a month. The food is always good, the beers always cold, the service is always great. The Chili Cheese Frito's with a cold beer, you can't go wrong!"
Shari P.,"Palmdale, CA",28,89,17,3.0,7/3/2013,"9/2013 - I have to update my review because I have been frequenting BJ's weekly with a large group on Sunday and my opinion of them is going downhill. My husband's meal was comped two weeks in a row for excessive waiting. And when I say ""excessive"" I mean, eight people are practically done with their meals before he received his. Another person's sandwich was given the wrong bread and she waited, with her incorrect meal, several minutes until they brought her the correct bread. Why they didn't see fit to remove her plate and correct her sandwich so it would stay hot, I can't tell you.  This place is very busy and, while I have had no problems when we have been there as a couple, they do not seem able to accommodate a group - and this fact has been validated too numerous of times.  * * * * * * This is a chain restaurant so they have the corporate thing going: pleasant hosts ready to greet you the moment you walk in, wait staff always polite and knowledgeable, menu items always prepared the same. They can also split tabs which is a positive. They can get pretty busy (and loud) so you may have to wait, especially if you're with a group. They have a great bar - I have no complaints with that at all! A bit on the pricey side, however, I have never had to return my order to the kitchen which is a plus for me."
Abby T.,"Palmdale, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/27/2016,great lunch special Idaho potato and tortilla soup can't go wrong
Leslie P.,"Torrance, CA",70,1012,1212,3.0,2/24/2011,"I havent been to a BJs in a really long time before this. I was in town for work, so I stayed after to hang out with friends.  We arrived at 6:50pm, and we were able to find a table in the bar area for 5 people. This was surprising because other BJs I've been to, it was always packed durnig happy hour, or even dinner time. But at the same time, it is Palmdale. Two other friends joined us after the waitress already took our orders, and she was accomodating. My friend convinced me to try the Berry Burst Cider, and it wasn't bad. I ordered the Spinach-Artichoke mini pizza. I forgotten how thick their pizzas were! it was about 1"" of dough, with creamy spinach, tomatoes, & artichoke, topped with grated parmesan cheese. The taste was good, but I prefer thin crust. Also, the crust was pretty oily. Overall, not bad; it's pretty much the same as other BJs. It's a great place to go for happy hour! HH is Monday-Friday 3-7pm, and Sunday-Thursday 10pm-12am with these specials: $1 off beer $1 off cocktails $2 off shareable appetizers 50% off mini pizzas"
Christine M.,"Palmdale, CA",0,10,,5.0,6/11/2015,"This is a unique place to try in the av try it love it ill go again, oh and hey try one of there new drinks there always amazing . Oh dont get me started on the deserets oh i had three shared of course but each one amazing"
Amanda D.,"Kent, WA",162,1070,243,5.0,3/26/2011,I had nothing but good experiences here I went for a unformal interview here ended up getting the job I run into all star airplane designer Burt Rutan here ... and so many good happy hour here since there is nothing else in AV...
Jacob H.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/28/2015,"I love this place. I've generally had a good experience at every BJ's I've been too; however, this one is my favorite. Sarah at the bar has also been great! She's friendly, seem down to earth and just enjoyable to talk to. Robin is great as well! If you're at a table, ask for her! She's likable, friendly, and an all around a good waitress.  I love this restaurant. Food is consistently good, service has always been good. It's great!"
Monica C.,"Palmdale, CA",0,22,1,3.0,3/20/2015,"LONG wait, then had to wait at our table for another 15 minutes before the server came over. She was very sweet though. Good drinks but the food was average."
April D.,"Lancaster, CA",0,2,3,1.0,8/15/2016,"I have to admit my visits to this restaurant are few and far between, due to the poor service we have received, earlier this year we had a large party and made a reservation in advance, upon arrival we still waited 2hrs to be seated, I ended up going back yesterday.....all the visit did was end my patronage of this establishment, we were first taken to a dirty table, then asked to wait again, no big deal, after being seated it was awhile before our drink orders were taken, again no big deal, once we ordered our food it took 1.5 hours to get our food and to be honest I am not sure why we stayed, we were not given drink refills the entire time, the manager then came to our table and stated that they were behind and our food should arrive shortly, not long after I was brought a lukewarm pizza?? the other three meals were delivered about five minutes apart with the exception of my sons burger and fries he got his burger and when he was almost finished eating was given what appeared to be a desert plate with a very small order of fries, it seemed like some odd afterthought, needless to say I will not be going back, besides stating that they were busy there was NOTHING done to make the visit better, shame on them"
Clayton S.,"Rosamond, CA",79,46,6,4.0,1/19/2015,Really nice restaurant if you want to try some craft beer. The food is pretty good. Mostly typical American food. There are also plenty of healthy options available. The beer is pretty good and they have a good selection.  They also have other craft beers available. Overall if you are looking for a good place to have dinner and some beer in the Palmdale area I would recommend this place.
Carla E.,"Palmdale, CA",1220,49,,4.0,6/17/2014,This place is really good! Yummy in tummy. I LOVE THE CREAM SODA HERE! The food and staff is amazing. Fast service and really great food. The only thing that sucks is that they don't have a big selection of beer :(
