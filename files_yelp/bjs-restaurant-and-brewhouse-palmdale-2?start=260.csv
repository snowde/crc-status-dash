Ken T.,"Wrightwood, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/5/2015,Worst service I have ever had in my life!!!! Wouldn't eat here again if the food was free!!! I can't believe how bad things were! Was expecting a fun night celebrating Birthdays and they couldn't handle a group of more than 4 people!! What a shame for a chain like this to not be able to handle a Birthday group that called ahead several days in advance!!! Shame on you!! I won't be spending my money there again!!! If I could give you a 0 for a rating it would be to much!!! So disappointing!!! 1/5/15 Manager did call and was concerned with the service we received. Hopefully he can make some changes. Unfortunately he has lost my business!!!

Chris W.,"Lancaster, CA",175,67,9,3.0,3/1/2013,"This is going to be somewhat of a mixed review. It's hard to gauge where I stand on this restaurant. If you want good pizza this is the place to be, however, the service is so unpredictable that it really is hard for me to give it the 4 or 5 star rating. I have had some very pleasant experiences here, hosts are almost always on the ball and courteous and servers are occasionally a lot of fun and a pleasure to be around.  Note that I said occasionally and not often.  We have had a few (3 to be exact) experiences that have left us to avoid this restaurant for the most part. Its just too unpredictable and a bad server, as we all know, can truly ruin your night.  1/3 of the time you will get bad service. The others will leave you with good beer, good food and a great night.  Good luck!"
Ren S.,"Palmdale, CA",1,5,,5.0,8/25/2015,"Great experience.  Ordered take out/delivery (bbq chicken salad). Service was great. Breanna was very helpful, nice and delivery time was prompt."
Torrence P.,"Lancaster, CA",1,32,5,5.0,4/4/2015,I've never had a bad experience at this location but tonight they were really on point. We were seated quickly. The food was served promptly. Caleb our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The big shout today though goes to whoever cooked our sirloin steaks. I usually don't care for steak but I decided to risk it tonight and WOW! I could eat the steak I had tonight for dinner every day for the rest of my life. Capped the evening off with a pazookie. What a great meal. Thanks B.J.'s!
Ruth K.,"Altadena, CA",161,459,3053,3.0,10/23/2010,"Best thing we had today was a great waitress, Jackie (sp?), who was fantastically on the ball and doing a great job in service. The onion strings were their usual yummy-ness as an appetizer, but the remainder of the meal left us both saying, ""Um, that didn't taste as great as I remembered it being last time."" We polished off the shared salad, but brought home most of the broccoli cheese soup; baby back pork ribs with baked potato; and the meatloaf with mashed potato and vegetables. Our theory is that we don't have to cook tomorrow, all we have to do is improve the leftovers a little bit and we'll be good to go.  (1) I'm heading to the freezer now to take out our homemade BBQ sauce to pour over the ribs before reheating tomorrow.  (2) I think I'll cut up the baked potato that has butter, sour cream and chives and just throw that into the soup pot when I pour in the too globby thick broccoli cheese soup ... add a little milk/cream to thin it down, a pinch of fresh nutmeg, a small amount of Romano cheese, a little sauteed shallots. It'll be great.  (3) I'll figure out the meatloaf, mashed potato and vegetable makeover on Monday :)"
Faith K.,"Menifee, CA",37,3,,1.0,7/6/2016,"I have never written a Yelp review before but the horrible service has spurred me to action. The food was fine, BJs normally produces a consistent reliable product, but the service was horrible. Our server was Desiree G and we sat in the bar. She was slow which I could forgive but she was also short, blunt, and rude. After waiting ten or so minutes for our waters she took our order (not a big deal) the food came out 30 minutes later (still maybe not her fault it could be the kitchen). However, she was not the one to literally plop our food on the table and walk off with out so much a glance, she never came back to our table. Not once. She didn't refill our drinks ever, even though we attempted to make eye contact with her on the rare occasions we could see her. She also finally took our plates away, and without a word took away a plate I was still eating from while it was under my face, and there were three clearly empty plates at the end of the table for her to take. Then she ""split"" our check and was apparently too stupid to run two cards separately even though they were separated by the three way split bill. I have also never intentionally not tipped a waiter/waitress before since so many things are happening that us as customers are aware of but this was the most abhorrent service I have ever been subjected too."
Patsy S.,"Littlerock, CA",3,12,,2.0,12/26/2014,"Food was delicious but both times we have came we have had horrible service, usually we r waiting over an hour 2 get our food ... 1 time we got our food b4 our appetizers... the 2nd time was so horrible that when we were leaving I asked to speak to the manager n the manager said call this # n handed me a business card...basically telling me she doesn't care... if u go here get a guy server they r the 1s always doing an amazing job next time we r asking for the tall white guy cuz he was amazing with his tables"
Sayde C.,"Palmdale, CA",10,24,20,2.0,6/9/2014,"Increasing by one star because the general manager gave me a gift card for the crappy service. when I went to pick it up (along with my take out), however, I waited for 15 minutes for them to bring my order out. I had already arrived 25 minutes past when they said it would be ready. Wish I could give more stars because the general manager was much more accommodating than the assistant manager, but the service has been less than good three times in a row now."
Lisa P.,"Lancaster, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/29/2016,"The food is always great although most Friday or Saturday nights there can be quite a wait!  Also a bonus, it is right next to the movie theatre!"
Felipe B.,"Lancaster, CA",71,13,3,2.0,7/16/2014,"Ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo but was disappointed, there was barely any sauce so it was dry. When I asked the waiter if I could have an extra cup of water because someone else at the table took mine she started asking me who took it. Service was really slow, took 10 mins to bring out just the water. The first food dish came out 15 mins until everyone else's order. Had heard this place was good but was really disappointed with how the service was and the quality of food."
Juanita M.,"Lancaster, CA",48,8,,1.0,5/20/2014,Went for a family dinner. Haven't been to bjs in years and now I remember why. Service sucked. We had three different servers. The manager came over and apologized for our appetizers being late. We waited 30minutes for our drinks. An hour and a half later we finally got out appetizers. Service was slow and terrible. My order was completely wrong. How could you get a well done burger wrong?! Wow. Along with not having a well done burger and fries were wrong and cold. I will never go back and never recommend.
G C.,"Palmdale, CA",18,4,,5.0,1/16/2016,Recommend BJ in Palmdale.. Great customer service with a smile!!! Britney was very attentive to our needs.   Thanks for great customer service Britney!! .. Will be here again for super bowl weekend!!
Tyson S.,"Palmdale, CA",22,119,100,4.0,5/12/2014,"I gave an extra star for Rhonda S. By far the best and hardest working waitress we have seen in here. We come back because the good beer and 90% of the time the food is great. With lots of amazing low calorie options. However, we come early I'm assuming before the ""real"" manager comes in we are usually here between 3 and 5pm for an hour or 2. And what we see every time is tables begging for service and all the staff laughing and congregating in the corners by the POS systems and laughing watching videos on the cell phone and basically hanging out and having a good time while ignoring their tables. Once we even had the black haired ponytail tail waitress I see every time that works in the bar area serving tables arguing with me from across the room because she got our drink order wrong. We always carefully specifically order firestone double jack. And when the waitress sucks she brings a pint of firestone walker Union Jack not firestone double jack in a bottle we have had this twice the first time the lady apologized this chick argued with me telling me that's not what I said as if I ever order anything else. So anyways sign up for the rewards card so if they leave you stranded for 30 minutes with the bill you can just pay on your phone and go. Long story short your food should be great. Your beer should be great. Your service should suck unless you have Rhonda."
Darlene S.,"Lancaster, CA",5,51,40,4.0,9/3/2014,We came in Monday the 1st day of September for gluten free pizza. Pizza was great however wings were dry and they need to cook them in the sauce. Service was nice and the young lady was smiling and very courteous. Definitely would eat here again just don't come a lot because it's very loud place. Had a Berry cider that was gluten free and it's now my favorite it's refreshing and so very good. Beer selection is great for Tommy.
Chris P.,"Rosamond, CA",10,58,28,4.0,7/16/2014,"Good beer, good food. Service was friendly and food came out quick. If you're counting calories, go somewhere else. The beer is paired with the food and when combined, this delicious combo is your daily intake. I recommend the brown ales."
Justin A.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,49,4,4.0,7/19/2012,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's and it's style of being a gourmet restaurant, pub, and sports bar type of fusion all in one.  I love the great food and the excellent beers that they have, with the Nutty Brewnette being my favorite.  It's a large size restaurant with TVs all over showcasing various sporting events.  Places like that are immediate winners in my book.  The beer list is great and they'll have some good seasonal beers here and there. The food here is the real treat.  Any place that specializes in beer can't slack on appetizers and luckily BJ's got this memo.  The have a large and diverse menu that's filled with an assortment of great appetizers.  I recommend the Piranha Pale Ale Nachos though it's only an appetizer if you have 3 or more people.  It's probably going to be a meal for 1-2 people because of it's size.  A few of my other favorites that I order regularly are the Avocado Egg Rolls, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  In fact, I once order each one of the above mentioned appetizers, including the nachos on a first date.  I tried to impress by taking over and just ordering for us ""like a man"" and I wanted her to sample on some of my favorites from there.  Well... she was on a diet and ordered a salad... so I had a fridge full of delicious appetizers when I woke up the next day.  BJ's Chicago style pizzas are fantastic!  I've tried many different types and each ones that I've had has been great.  The awesome flakiness, crispiness, and buttery taste of the crust is something that will have you eagerly wanting to return to give them more of your money.  They're also well known for there very popular dessert, the BJ's Pizookie... and they're awesome!  They're cookies baked in their own individual deep dish pan, then topped with ice cream... nuff said, lol.  I'll actually stop by every once in awhile just for a Pizookie, yes, it's that good. BJ's also has a great mix of sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas, giant stuffed potatoes, steaks, ribs, chef creations, and more.  I personally like the California Burger, Tuscan Chicken Limone, Fish & Chips ,Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich, Grilled Chicken Club, and of course the pizza! If you like great food and a great beer then I suggest you check this place out."
Howard F.,"Lancaster, CA",28,81,35,5.0,7/29/2014,So good. Great food. Great service. Server waited for me to check the steak for my satisfaction before leaving. Leaving full and happy.
Angela M.,"Hutto, TX",455,553,813,4.0,9/26/2010,"This is a solid chain restaurant, I enjoy their brews and you can do a sampler flight to see which brew you want to go with. I went here this weekend with a coworker and tried the Oktoberfest which was good and then the Nutty Brewnette which was also pretty solid. I went a few months ago with my bf and we got a pitcher of one of their darker ales and a few random things on the menu.  I like the atmosphere inside and its a good place to watch the games with their many flat screen tvs. The servers were very friendly, we did make the mistake of looking at the calories for every item on the menu and MY GOD how do they have such high calorie items...it seriously puts to shame alot of the other chains that are notoriously bad for high calorie items. You can find a few things that are under 500 calories but hey if you go out to eat here you're not looking for something figure friendly.  Next stop will probably be Buffalo Wild Wings."
Joe K.,"North Little Rock, AR",10,30,3,4.0,1/20/2013,"Visiting Edwards Air Force base for a week and was looking for a great place to chill & drink a good beer. It's behind the Antelope Valley Mall in the parking lot next to the theater. Came in and was seated right away+ Appitizers came out promptly+ Drinks were replenished quickly+ Food was pretty delicious+ Amazing selection of smooth beers+ Servers weren't as attractive as I had hoped- There was a problem getting a server right away- We ate here on a Thursday night so it might have been the B team servers, idk? But our server was the most attractive one, with amazing eyes! She was slim, dark eyeliner, multiple earings, great personality and I believe she had small tattoos on the left side of her face near the temple. Eitherway, she was the best looking server I had while I was visitn the entire week!  Check it out, there is other places that serve beer and food but this place has tv's to watch UFC fights and sports games too!"
