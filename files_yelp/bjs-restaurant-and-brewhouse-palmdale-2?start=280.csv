Luz D.,"Palmdale, CA",31,13,30,4.0,8/13/2014,Very good place to have lunch and to have a good drink. I love there mozzarella sticks and there Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizza. And the bar is also a nice place to sit and have a drink or an appetizer.
Sean W.,"O'Fallon, IL",36,110,26,2.0,5/9/2014,"I've been to this BJs location several times in the past and enjoyed my experiences there.  My last visit, however, was nothing short of marginal.  On his way to our table, the server stopped to have a 20 minute chat with an old friend at a table right next to us.  I understand that the wait staff are people with lives outside of work, but this was ridiculous.  When we eventually got our food, which was salmon and scallops, it was cold and very microwavy (best word I know to describe it).  The fish was dry and bland.  My margarita was so acidic, I could not drink it, so I ordered a Hefe, which was very good.  I really hope this location gets it's act together.  It was nice knowing we have a BJs in the AV, but I might as well eaten at our local substandard Chilis for a lot less."
Lupita V.,"Palmdale, CA",96,96,62,3.0,2/28/2014,I had such a horrible server we went for my sister birthday in a group omg that server was just horrible didn't take orders right took forever to do anything !!! That alone made my experience there bad the food was good over priced margaritas but its good food just poor service !!!
Tim R.,"Los Angeles, CA",206,85,14,4.0,5/7/2014,"I enjoyed their Black n Bleu burger. When it came it was a smaller patty than I had ordered, the manager promptly and courteously made a new 1/2 pound burger for me- very well handled!"
Joe L.,"Lancaster, CA",87,72,70,4.0,3/1/2014,"We had dinner here tonight and this is the first time we have been here. The food was all good fresh and hot. Our waitress did a pretty good job but lagged on refilling our waters. The reason I give this place 4 stars is my wife had a margarita and it was 13.95,it was top shelf but loads of ice. We did have to wait a bit for a table, so my overall experience was good but a little on the expensive side. Nice atmosphere and clean restaurant. Thanks, Joe and Carolyn"
PY P.,"Lancaster, CA",37,63,36,4.0,5/29/2014,"My usual eats here :  drinks - brewhouse blonde - bloody marys - margaritas appetizers - stuffed mushrooms (with NO pesto) - thai won tons - calamaris lunch -dinner time eats - black n blue burger, bj's bar-b-que lunch platter. Every so often - Tuscan Chicken Pasta , Jambalaya (yum). MUST HAVE HERE :  Their bj's premier reward club card."
Gabriel D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,43,10,3.0,9/29/2012,"I like this place, it's usually decent and while in the same vein of Applebees and Chilis it's better than either of those two options.  Drink selection is great, and if you can't find something on their menu it can only be because you're not hungry. If we can't decide where to go, we normally go here.  The pizza is probably the best in Palmdale and they deliver within a 2-mile radius which is always nice."
Brett P.,"Palmdale, CA",1,10,,3.0,11/6/2015,Many beers on tap and a good menu...service is spotty but it does get busy.  I am a lunch or Happy Hour fan and they do both well.
Mark R.,"Palmdale, CA",32,79,142,3.0,10/12/2013,"We waited almost an hour for a so-so meal and marginally good service. First off we were taken to our ""empty"" table and stood for 6 minutes while they cleaned and placed menus on it. Drinks came quickly but even after salad and appetizers came we were still asking for place settings.  One of our party went to the manager which produced results. The Bison Burger I ordered had no flavor, the bun was wet and the sauce was bland. I'm surprised because this isn't what I have experienced at this and other BJs."
Thales R.,"Whittier, CA",314,38,6,4.0,4/18/2014,Berry burst cider is a good option for gluten free drink.
Melissa I.,"Lancaster, CA",14,17,3,1.0,4/13/2014,"This restaurant has been much less than accommodating to the party of 30 that I tried bringing in. First, I tried making reservations and the manager Steve Huddleston refused to let us make a reservation allowing for full menu access. I decided to call ahead for the large party and we arrived 30 minutes earlier than our call ahead time. We were then told that we would have an hour to hour and fifteen minute wait, which could have been avoided if they just took the reservation. I called Famous Dave's and they were more than willing to accommodate the large party and on such short notice with great customer service!! I would recommend not dining at BJ's especially if you have a large party! BJ's lost my business!! *****ONLY putting 1 star because I have to leave a rating*****"
Jackie S.,"Lancaster, CA",31,209,1,4.0,4/1/2012,"Service is usually spot on. I enjoy the honey mustard chicken sandwich. The fries are yummy!  My mom loves this angel hair pasta thingy, and the avocado egg rolls (in fact, she usually talks about them long after they have been devoured) The clam chowder is good, the breadbowl is yummy, except I like the bread on the top, and they cut it all out. I am not sure what they do with it. but they make it into like garlic bread. Agh, more fattening that way! lol. They're a good place."
Faye V.,"San Francisco, CA",47,59,52,3.0,1/10/2012,"My family is a fan of BJ's, even if for the strawberry lemonade and bruschetta alone. We frequent the Elk Grove location and are happy with them. It's a chain that we don't hate -- simply because we like the food options. You've got beers, burgers, pizza and pasta - in all it's good-old-American-fusion glory. If that's what you're looking for, BJ's is definitely as a top pick.  The tricky thing -- the service. It was a-okay here. It was a little bit slow, but not so delayed that we were upset. It was Saturday night after all. The staff was really courteous, and these days, simple kindness goes a long way. A few staples: root beer floats, calamari, wings, bruschetta and nachos for starters. My personal faves: the seafood pasta and Cobb salad. The chowder, pot roast and pork chops score high with the fambam. Everything is large enough to share - including the pizookie. Our group includes two, sometimes 3, toddlers, a man-child, grammy and everyone in between. BJ's has something for everyone, plus Daddy can have a beer while peeking at the game and the babies can be a little loud without anyone really noticing."
Tatiana P.,"Lancaster, CA",54,5,,5.0,7/30/2015,okay i want to start off by saying WOW WOW the food was AMAZING!! fresh hot and perfect service was Beyond OUTSTANDING!! A+++++ i recommend it 100% trust me.. and everyones super nice..
Frank L.,"Lancaster, CA",9,7,8,5.0,1/6/2012,"We love BJ's.  They have some good craft beers and the coffee is awesome too. (I guess when you have the ""brewing"" thing down it doesn't matter if it is coffee or beer.) The potstickers are a great, shareable app.  The HUGE stuffed potatoes are good and I have yet to try an item on their menu that I have not enjoyed. Good food, service, and atmosphere."
Joseph D.,"Irvine, CA",0,10,2,5.0,7/8/2014,"We had a great experience here last week. The waitress was nice, courteous and took good care of us. The food was terrific, served hot and on time. The kids loved the food most especially the pepperoni pizza. I loved the calamari appetizer. Yum yum yum"
Teri D.,"Quartz Hill, CA",9,28,36,4.0,1/28/2012,"Craving deep dish pizza for 2 days so we ordered and picked up from B.J's. Couldn't wait to cut into a good Chicago style deep dish with all that melted cheese and sauce...sounded so good ! What a disappointment. Ordered extra cheese and still had hardly any on it, and what it did have was kinda dry and burnt. And the sauce was non existent. None. Who makes pizza with no sauce??? But whenever we've dined there the other food has been good and service good as well so they still get 3 stars. Just don't order the deep dish bread."
Bailey S.,"Lancaster, CA",0,13,,2.0,4/26/2015,"We went to BJ's for dinner last night. We go there a couple times a month and usually we have a decent experience. Last night we were not so lucky. We got there and they were pretty busy. We did get to sit down immediately so they weren't extremely busy. They seated us, and we waited about five minutes till our waitress came to get our drink order. We ordered dinner when she brought our drinks about 10 minutes later. Then we sat there for about an hour before we got our food. Our waitress came by a few times and said the food was coming up soon. Finally our waitress said she knew we waited a long time so she would send the Manager over to our table to ""take care of us"". Well, he didn't take care of anything. He just came over and said the food would be out momentarily. Then he disappeared. Finally we got our food and we ate our meals. The food was fine. We were expecting our bill to have some kind of a discount for our long wait, but it didn't. We were very disappointed with this. The Manager just went back into the back and hid away! So, we just want everyone to know that BJ's is not about customer service and satisfaction. They are just about money. They weren't even very apologetic for making us wait so long. They really didn't care about us. Very disappointing! We will find a different ""go to"" restaurant that does care about customer satisfaction."
Michael A.,"Lancaster, CA",0,4,,3.0,6/28/2015,"Extremely long wait time, around an hour or so. It was understandable because it was busy except they were trying to get us a table for 6 when we had 4 adults and 2 kids so the table (big corner booth) was to big either way since we needed a high chair. The service was excellent can complain about that and the clam chowder I ordered was the best I ever had. However I tried the chicken jambalaya and it was one of the worst dishes I ever had. It tasted as if someone had dumped chili flakes all over the dish (apparent by the mess on the side of the plate with chili powder/flakes all over) so I made do with sharing fries and my clam chowder. My father in law specifically goes here for the mahi mahi tacos and he was disappointed because the fish was so burnt he couldn't even chew it and had to send it back, the second order was okay but a little under done. Can't complain about my wife's burger or the fries or even the kids meal. All around disappointed with the food and wish I could of had a better experience with the food but I will return for the amazing clam chowder!"
Sherryl I.,"Camarillo, CA",804,275,827,4.0,10/6/2009,"A BJ's in Palmdale?  This is exactly what the AV needed. We usually order: - Bruschetta appetizer - Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza - Parmesan-crusted Chicken - Fish & Chips - BJ's beer sampler - Oreo Pizookie - Cap'n Crunch French Toast (in case you're ever here for Brunch) It can get pretty crowded, especially for dinner time.  If you can't stand the typical 1-hour wait for a table/booth in the dining area, then try to snag a seat or pub table in the bar area.  Once, I was told there was a 45-minute wait for a table, but then I snagged a pub table that opened up 5 minutes later, so I gave my buzzer back.  This saved a whole 40 minutes! Food quality is consistent and timely.  I have not experienced any difference in quality here versus other BJ's locations.  Minus one star because sometimes you get a server that is inattentive or not as friendly as others."
