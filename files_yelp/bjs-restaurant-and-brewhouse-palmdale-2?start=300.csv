Dirk N.,"Dallas, TX",0,637,144,1.0,7/22/2011,"I'll start off by saying I really love BJ's food and drinks. (Buffalo Chicken Pizza is one of my favorites ever)  Still, I'm giving this location one star because of the service. It's always too busy and the staff is pretty slow.  And one time, on a trip to California, I didn't have my plastic driver's license (was in the process of changing my address). I had spent the previous few days in VEGAS and didn't have a single problem. But BJ's would not serve me alcohol, despite the fact I had my temporary license with my birth date printed on it and a picture. Definitely ruined the night as I had to sit there while my friends enjoyed the great drinks."
Abbey C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",25,53,19,1.0,9/6/2014,"This BJ's is continuing to get worse with their food and service. I use to frequent this BJ's but because of the last experience, I won't be back soon. First, a couple friends and I walked in and there were two hostesses who said nothing and didn't even acknowledge our presence in the restaurant. Second, my black and bleu burger was gross. The bun they put it on just didn't do justice for anything. I couldn't taste the blue cheese even. My friend ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it took 25 minutes for just that to come out (and I know they just warm it up and pour it in the bowl). Disappointing. And to top it off, the waitress did not listen to me when I strategically numbered on the receipt what items I wanted on one card and numbered the other items for my friends card (in a 1,1,1,2,2,). I have always found that this has been the easiest but she wasn't listening and charged the wrong amounts to both cards. Very disappointing. Hopefully the service here changes because that sucked!"
Laura P.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,27,,3.0,3/3/2014,Beer and pizza! Great atmosphere and the pizza is terrific! They also have a gigantic stuffed potato that is fit for two! Finish it with a pizookie! Yum
manuel c.,"Bell, CA",36,11,,1.0,10/15/2013,Went this weekend waited for over 45 min for a table was given a pager to notify us when our table was ready after waiting so long I approach the hostest which was so rude when she told me that she had been calling me for a while even though the pager never lite up never again go to applebees across
Rudy G.,"Palmdale, CA",0,3,5,1.0,7/27/2015,"Stay away from this dump hands down, and the staff have a very very bad attitude & nasty service vs. Yard House!"
Aidan V.,"Los Angeles, CA",247,741,164,2.0,7/27/2011,Oh Gawd.  Like i've said before... i dont do chain restaurants but what other choice do i have in palmdale for pizza & drinks with a friend? Little ceasars?  Yeah. FML.
Marisol A.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,78,104,1.0,2/2/2013,"Thanks for ruining my dad's birthday. I called at 6:20 PM to call ahead and make sure my name was on the list ahead of time. I was told the wait would be 30-45 minutes. Fine, not a problem. We show up after 30 minutes and are about to be put in a list (again) and we need to wait anothe 30-45 minutes. Of course, this being Saturday night there is no other place in Palmdale with less than an hour wait. So thank you for wasting my time when I live so far away and go out of my way to eat here."
Holly B.,"Columbia, SC",0,10,,4.0,7/11/2013,"Although this is a chain, it feels more like an independent. The food is really good, and their gluten free options are awesome.  Took my daughters for a night out and we had the best time.  We fed three people for $50 including a nice tip.  They even mixed up our desert order, but left the extra, went out of their way to replace it, and took it off the bill.  Great waitstaff as well."
Robin J.,"San Diego, CA",42,252,54,5.0,5/8/2011,"I was out visiting for Mother's Day and since it was a spur of the moment visit from Orange County, we were on a time crunch. I called BJ's and asked if they had reservations available and a really nice girl told me about their call-in program. When I was 30 minutes from arrival, I called back and put my name on the list. When I got there, my name wasn't on the list!  I was worried as the placed was packed by then and it was definitely hours away.   There is so much incompetence in the world these days that I really felt like we were going to be out of luck.   I showed proof on my phone that I called 30 minutes prior and after they did some research they gave us a table right away :)  It's rare for someone to actually be that competent and hard working. The food was amazing!!! We shared a bunch of stuff - we had the scampi pasta, the Margarita Pizza, the tomato and mozzarella salad, a burger, beer of course and a Red Velvet Pizookie:) Service was fast, efficient and this has now become my favorite BJ's ever!!!"
Tristan S.,"California City, CA",74,32,69,2.0,3/6/2013,"Firstly,  I always appreciate good service so that is today's saving grace.  The food ... (SMH sadly) was just scarcely better than Carl's Jr.  The Turkey Burger at Carl's certainly has more flavor at a  better price.  This was also my first attempt trying parmesan crusted chicken breast.  If I though that this is what it should taste like then I would not be inclined to ever try it again. A dry, burnt toast taste lingers in my mouth as I contemplate heading to walmart for some Listerine.  Again, if not for the excellent service and based on just the food alone, I would not return to BJ's.  I've always thought BJ's to be the better of the chain restaurants but this time it fell short of acceptable.  My advice to BJ's Cooking Staff, Tighten Up!! You are slipping big time."
Pamela L.,"Palmdale, CA",2,18,3,4.0,5/5/2012,"We like BJ's. They are always welcoming, even if you show up late at night, and the food is good enough. Sometimes the service is pretty slow, and often they put things on the pizzas you didn't order or don't put things on that you do order, but they will always correct the problem happily if you point it out to them. They are a great place to go have a drink on a Friday or Saturday night."
Debra W.,"Lancaster, CA",28,72,18,3.0,4/28/2011,"I have been here in the past several times and the portions were huge and the food was great. However, when my boyfriend and I went there this evening for dinner, I noticed portion sizes were much smaller then they used to be and while the food was good, the service was not so much.  We were seated immediately, but had to wait almost 15 minutes before someone came for our drink order. I ordered the spinach and artichoke small pizza and my boyfriend ordered the pot roast. The food was a like time in coming. Our waitress only checked on us one time during the meal except to bring us our check.  Needless to say, while I did tip her (she didn't technically mess anything up) it wasn't a great tip.  We'll probably go back, but if we want a really good meal, we'll be heading somewhere else. :("
Laura L.,"Lancaster, CA",0,9,,5.0,5/5/2015,Caleb was our waiter tonight...what an outstanding employee!!! Very attentive but not overly attentive. Great attitude great service great customer satisfaction!!! I will ask for him from now on. Wouldn't mind being seated at the least desirable table if he was the waiter. Outstanding young man!!!
Erik H.,"Mission Hills, CA",410,37,17,3.0,8/23/2011,"""A fun menu and youthful staff make BJ's a popular stop in the Antelope Valley.""   I'm not a fan of big corporate chain restaurants. Akin to my days as a rebellious punk rawker, I still grow weary at the thought of 'Big Brother Inc.' plotting the demise of culinary culture, a conspiracy to dumb  down the human pallet so to feed us low quality produce and ingredients while maximizing profit. Down with the 'man'!!   BJ's is a popular corporate chain restaurant that is probably best known for their delectable brews and fun appetizers. The first time I tried BJ's Restaurant was in Santa Clarita, and I soon became a fan of the beer sampler and the avocado egg rolls. That was over 4 years ago now and I have returned a number of times to recapture the moment, all without fail.   I was pleased to learn of the construction of BJ's in Palmdale, as 1) Palmdale is my hometown. 2) I like BJ's Beers\Appetizers and 3) Palmdale (in the past) was in DESPERATE NEED of dining options.   My impression of BJ's facilities could literally be copied from site to site, as the Palmdale location offered all the familiar quirky, eclectic ambiance that the other locations offer; vintage signage and other memorabilia adorn the walls, offering diners something to look at as they wait for their dishes. Eye Fodder, but interesting fodder at that.   The Staff at Bj's is young and (for the most part) inexperienced. This isn't a knock, only an observation. Corporate restaurants often hire servers with little or no experience for a number of good reasons, this shouldn't imply that the service is bad, just 'inexperienced'. The service I received at BJ's was friendly, unpretentious, and best-effort. The staff was clean cut, and attentive to my table. (I did notice a high ratio of Female servers to Male, just sayin').   The food at BJ's occupies a middle ground; The establishment isn't 'pub-ish' enough to be considered 'Pub Grub', and is not refined enough to be considered 'Fine Dining', yet it posses strong traits of both. It's a popular middle ground that is occupied by many of the new-up restaurants trying to capture the 20-30 yo. crowd for drinks and fun times. I like that business model :)   Aiming to capture the burgeoning college age (and beyond) market, their menu reflects it by supplying ample doses of pub friendly appetizers like Sliders, Poke, those Avocado Egg Rolls I like so much, and Calamari for Grandma (Sorry Calamari fans..lol). The entree menu is fairly extensive and runs a spectrum, from Pizza and Pasta to Burgers, salmon, pork chops and ribs.    The quality of the ingredients is typical with most corporate owned establishments. My Salmon and Egg Rolls were fresh and tasty, but I noticed wilting endive in our salads. This lack of attention to detail to me is a sign of one of two things: 1) Busy Kitchen or 2) Cook staff that doesn't care. I will safely say that number 2 was not the culprit, as BJ's tends to be quite busy as others have mentioned, and the attention shown in our dishes testified highly on the competency of the cook staff. The Angel Hair Toscana that my daughter ordered was prepared fresh. The taste of the  fresh tomatoes and Basil came through, indicating the produce problems might have been isolated to the endive salad.    Bj's is also budget friendly, as daily specials and menu pricing won't hurt dad's wallet, and ladies, your boo can still afford to take you to the movies afterward. For a family of four, we escaped at a little over $50 with tip (no alcohol). Overall, the experience was a pleasant one, was it 'memorable', no, not in the traditional dining sense, but when driving through the Antelope Valley will I remember that BJ's is an option for satisfying bites and brews? You betcha.  In a place that I once considered a desolate wasteland for foodies (the Antelope Valley) , lights of hope peer through the desert night sky and illuminate a land that is slowly gaining it's foothold on food culture. Sure BJ's is corporate, but much like trickle down economics, the construction of BJ's in the AV indicates a need. A need for fun, memorable dining experiences, a need for 'better' food choices and culinary diversity. And though there have been small diners and restaurants in the AV for years that deserve mention, none are such a beacon of change as BJ's. Soon, the question for foodies in the AV won't be ""Where do we go? There's so few choices"", to ""Where do we go? I can't make up my mind!"", inspiring diners to get out and have fun and spend $$$!!!  FOODIE UP!!!! Erik"
Lisa B.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,113,2,1.0,1/12/2015,The worst service ever-every time I go there. Management needs to get on the stick and get their waitstaff trained properly-or at least be friendly (even the management) Had one assistant manager incredibly rude to me when I pointed out the crusty food splashed all over the side of our booth (disgusting) and the rudest waitress I've ever had! Yardhouse is right around the corner and much better service and food!
Lucia L.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",293,67,5,5.0,9/7/2011,"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants but after our awful experience at Buffalo Wild Wings (see previous review) this place was like HEAVEN!! Our server was so kind and attentive. She was polite and provided us with AMAZING service! The food here was REALLY good (but we were also very hungry). AND it didn't give me the most horrific indigestion ever like the BJ's in Woodland Hills did. :) So, my parents and I had a wonderful dining experience here and I must say, we left very happy with every aspect of our dinner. :D GOOD JOB, BJ's-Palmdale!"
matt h.,"Palmdale, CA",1,28,30,1.0,11/4/2012,"The Corporate Office contacted me and said they were going to send me a giftcard and they apologized for the incident. They even said I could give it to my worst enemy if I chose not to use it. I never received a giftcard and if I did I really wouldnt give it to my worst enemy. What a Joke! I have told all of my co-workers. Our Year End party will never be there, that's for sure! BTW over 50 employees in the Palmdale/Lancaster area... you do the math!"
Don G.,"Quartz Hill, CA",275,338,49,3.0,10/2/2012,I've always had good service and good food here. But tonight the service was so slow that we waited over an hour for the food. Drink refills didn't happen without asking them for it. It was just sad since it was a Tuesday night and they weren't even busy at all.
Vce S.,"Lancaster, CA",44,22,7,4.0,11/14/2014,"This is my favorite place to eat in the AV. I only had one experience here where the waitress seemed like she didn't want to serve me. Anyhow this time I came on a busy night which is rare. Then again I acme on Nov 11th Veterans Day. I seated myself in the bar area since the hostess recommended it. The waitresses were zooming all over the place to take care of seated customers so there was about 15 minutes before I was offered a menu. My waitress was nice and pleasant even with the number of tables she had. In all it was a good experience. The only thing is trying to get someone's attention. Yelling excuse me or waving trying to get the wait staff attention is in a way rude since everyone doesn't have the same tolerance for service. The wait staff should wear name tags...even when they introduce themselves and say ""I will be taken your order tonight"" I'm one to have to hear the name several times before I can form an identity. In short it would be a better experience if they wore name tags. I know how some may feel about strangers knowing their names. In the end I was able to thank the waitress by name from the receipt she gave me. Thank you ""Holly"" for the excellent service on a busy night."
Mo W.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,4.0,3/27/2015,This place is one of my top 5 favorites ever. The food is amazing. The service can be a little slow at times depending how busy they are but that's the least of my worries. The food and atmosphere make up for it. I love the rewards program they have too. I love this place. I go at least once every couple weeks!
