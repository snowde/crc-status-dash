Elvis P.,"Santa Monica, CA",195,188,44,4.0,6/14/2013,They surprised us with super friendly service and didn't jump our shit for coming in to order take out so late. They kick so much ass!!!
Ernie A.,"Lancaster, CA",0,6,,4.0,5/29/2012,"I love this place. My girl and I have date night every Friday and this is one of our favorite places. The service is good, the food is very tasty, and the beer is very refreshing, but my favorite is the mojito. My girl and I made it our mission to try every pizza in the menu(not at once of course), and out favorite is the sweet pig. We start of with the small appetizers like the fried artichokes, or the bruschetta. Too bad they removed the tacos from that menu, we loved those small tacos.  We have not had a bad experience here yet, and hope we never do. The food is great, the environment is nice, the service is awesome, and we will keep coming back for our date nights."
Roger J.,"Lancaster, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/16/2015,My wife and I went for dinner last night and both of us were very disappointed with the food and service. We were seated promptly but after ordering our food that's when the problems started. My wife ordered a build your own pizza and I ordered a black and Bleu burger. Her pizza arrived in about 35 minutes which wasn't so bad but my food hadn't arrived yet. She didn't begin to eat as we wanted to have dinner together. About 15 minutes later we were told that my burger was given to another table and they were making mine over and it would be out shortly. I waited well over an hour for a burger and fries.After the long wait the burger was one of the worst tasting burgers I've ever eaten. My burger was comped which was the least they could do. Don't think we'll return to this restaurant anytime soon. Extremely disappointed!
Brad O.,"Lancaster, CA",3,11,,4.0,10/19/2011,"This BJ's is pretty good, I'm kinda surprised to see all the negative reviews about their service...I've never had a problem here.  They do the basics pretty well for the style of restaurant they are- pizza, burgers/fries, sandwiches are all good. I've been pleasantly surprised by some of their other dishes...I really like the spaghetti w/ spicy marinara sauce I've had a couple times, and recently got the chicken parmesan which was awesome. Also really like the fish tacos. They do get really busy evenings on the weekends...which is why I don't usually go at that time. Overall, a real good place for lunch or dinner."
Shannon J.,"Lancaster, CA",56,14,,4.0,12/13/2013,"Love this place! So many choices, so little time. Great drink options. Recommend to anyone."
Mike H.,"Lancaster, CA",0,15,1,2.0,12/7/2013,I've been here several times and every time one or more items that I have ordered has come out cold or incorrect.the service can go from good to bad on any day here and the food is very inconsistent would say I've been here at least 20 times since i moved out here and all those times there has been a error or two with my food .
Wendy H.,"Lancaster, CA",0,8,2,2.0,12/24/2014,"Terribly disappointed with our service tonight. Although our server was very friendly on the rare occasion she came to our table, the entire experience was lacking. We were there for one and a half hours to be served just two appetizers  and dessert. Staff appeared to be more concerned with socializing with each other (including who appeared to be the manager) than tending to customers. Hopefully they can improve on the customer experience, this experience tonight sure makes it hard to want to return."
S D.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,29,,3.0,2/23/2016,"the food is good and the service is ok,, some of the help can be a little stuck up..."
Janice S.,"Palmdale, CA",73,12,7,3.0,6/8/2010,"I am over this BJ's. The food is always good no matter what. The service however is hit and miss. We went last thursday and they were very busy because of 8th grade promotions. We waited for a table for and hour after we were told 30 min. We were the only ones left waiting out of the group we started with. My problem with this is, there was a table waiting for 16 people. The problem only 5 of them were there. Those tables sat empty for 45 minutes.  Several times I have been there the service has been shotty at best. Be sure to talk to the manager if you are not getting good service early on in your meal don't wait till ius't over."
Christine D.,"Escondido, CA",32,138,93,3.0,4/2/2011,"This BJ's is not up to par to the one's in San Diego. I was around the Lancaster/Palmdale area with the bf. We got lost trying to look for this place. The GPS guided us to some random residential area. The location is hidden to the back side of the mall. We got here around 5:30 & by that time they had started to get real busy. The decor was typical BJ's, with a bunch of flat screen TV's with games playing on each of them. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer, but we got our pizza first. We asked our waitress what happened and she told us that it's just taking the chicken to take a little longer to cook. Isn't that weird when pizza takes a pretty long time to bake? Hmmm ... I would say that the customer service at this place is not that great. If I were to overall rate this place I would give them 2.5 stars."
Johnny B.,"Irvine, CA",816,66,16,3.0,9/18/2012,"Just not as fresh and flavorful as I'm use to with this chain. Service was great, the only complaint is the food that I've had here before was only mediocre at this location. Probably will not return"
Donna C.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,19,,1.0,6/10/2014,"I came here with 3 other people. Two of us had never been to BJ's. I had scallops with rice and asparagus. The scallops were OK but the rice and asparagus were so salty, I couldn't eat them. My husband had chicken with pasta. How can you go wrong with chicken and pasta?  They could. He managed to eat half of it but only to be polite because the others were paying for it. For the prices they charge, you'd think they'd give you bread. Nope!  I would never go back to any BJ's."
Chris B.,"Edwards, CA",0,28,1,1.0,6/11/2012,"Had a pretty terrible experience here for lunch...  We ordered the kids food first, which came out promptly, in fact as we were ordering for the rest of the party.  Initial reflections were positive.  After that it was a mess.  After ordering (and asking for spoons for the kids' apple sauce), it was 20 minutes before we were checked in on again... To bring out salads, and still no spoons.  15 minutes after that, soups came out for those that ordered the soup and salad, and those in our party who had ordered sandwiches asked on that status to which the waitress replied ""oh they're plating them now.""  25 minutes later, after everyone had eaten there were still no sandwiches, and the waitress responed ""well the soup and salad are really quick, but we know, they're cooking them now.""  From plating to cooking, then.  Well, it sounds like we were lied to.  Finally 10 minutes later the manager came out to say that he was sorry and that the sandwiches would be free.  Ok, great, so they're doing the right thing at least.  Well 15 minutes after that, the kids are getting restless and still no sandwiches.  Sandwiches. So I guess if they're going to give you something free, you get put to the bottom of the priority list.  Meanwhile, people are hungry and kids are getting even more restless to the point where I finally decide that we're leaving.  As we're beginning to get up, the manager walks out with two sandwiches. Me: It's too late, we have to go. Mgr: Do you want a box? Me: Well, at this point not really, it's kind of too late. Mgr (miffed): Well, um ok.  I uhh was going to give you some courtesy cards. Me: Well you haven't really inspired enough confidence in me to want to come back, now have you?   Mgr (really miffed): *makes several excuses about how the kitchen was busy (restaurant was half full) and the food got sold to another table... huh?* If the management reads this forum, I hope they understand that making excuses doesn't make things better.  At last gave me two gift cards (total $40) to pay for my $34 meal.  The fact that he charged me for this lovely 1.5 hour lunch experience in the first place is a FOUL.  Then he swiped the gift cards and didn't even give me one back for the remaining balance.  Professional.  I guess either he knew he screwed the pooch or he only begrudgingly compensated me $40 (minus $6).  I ultimately don't care because I wouldn't ever go back here, but the actions of the staff and the manager were inexcusable.  The answer is ""I am sorry and I'll make this right.""  My preferred method is to speak softly and carry a small tip in cases like these but when it got beyond ridiculous, I spoke up and got a barrage of excuses and looks like I was trying to scam this restaurant.  Well, I think I'll take my business elsewhere next time.  I heard good things about this Steve Huddleston guy on other reviews, and I don't think it was he who I dealt with today... but I wonder what kind of place he's running if his staff can't execute simple lunch service and treat their guests poorly."
Geoff D.,"Palmdale, CA",12,134,6,3.0,10/7/2012,"We went to BJs for lunch the other day. It was arctic cold and the service was  not that great. The food was ok, not something I look forward to having again. The pizookie was DELISH. Adjust the AC and kick up the service a notch."
Elizabeth C.,"Los Angeles, CA",932,443,848,3.0,3/23/2010,"Not my favorite BJ's--that honor goes to the one in Glendale, because it is always full of freaks--but nonetheless pretty solid. I came here for a baby shower and, as such, was fed pre-paid pizza and salad. The salad was of the variety usually found bagged in the discount produce aisle at the grocery store; the pizza was pretty tasty, though most of it had sausage on it so I couldn't eat it. Such is life. Hands down, the best part of the meal was my strawberry lemonade; I downed five or six glasses, and they weren't even spiked with Vodka. Our waitress was efficient and very timely with my drink orders. I like that. Three/three and a half stars."
Lisa M.,"Lancaster, CA",122,20,19,4.0,12/20/2010,"I knew the pizza from BJ Chicago's in Balboa. It is awesome. My husband loves the beer. And the Asian chicken lettuce wraps are my favorite lowish carb meal. Their pizza comes served in a dish, deep dish style, with tomatoes on top of it. I like the Great White because it has white sauce garlic, chicken and mushrooms. The micro brews are great. Our waitress was very attentive, I didn't have to wait at all for a drink refill.. something that has happened here before. The place was crowded but not full, a bit of a wait for our meal but we still made the  movie in plenty of time."
Brian U.,"Sylmar, CA",0,1595,100,2.0,4/3/2010,"After I received my first hate e-mail on Yelp, I thought I'd better hide my real face. I replaced it with a sea urchin. Not only because I love sea urchin, but I'm also all prickly on the outside and salty on the inside. I hope my anti-fan approves of such a self-portrait. Now on to spreading my unhappy hatred on another victim. I first went to a BJ's restaurant ages ago in Maui with the hope of getting their namesake Chicago-style pizza. This is NOT the place to get authentic deep dish pie. It's also not a good place get a cocktail unless you're a fan of sweet, Jello-tasting drinks. And even though it's called BJ's, they don't serve them. Over the years, they have expanded the menu so it's half-pizzeria and half-diner so the menu is enormous. Perplexed with so many choices and prior visits telling me what not to eat, what do I try this time that might bring me some food joy? With no logical rationale, I rolled the dice on the fish and chips. I came up a winner! The fish had a nice puffy batter coating and the fish was moist. My girlfriend ordered the lettuce wraps which had an overwhelming amount of salt. If you don't believe me, check the sodium content in the nutritional chart on the back of the menu. As food establishments go, BJ's are exceptionally well managed and always seem busy without costly advertising. Hmmm. Maybe, I should think about investing in a BJ's franchise? Naw, I'm too thin-skinned (literally) to take the abuse of customers and mean Yelper's like me."
Arthur S.,"Long Beach, CA",15,72,3,1.0,3/29/2012,I will make this short and to the point I ordered a pizza I wanted half pineapple and half pepperoni.  When I got my bill it charged me for what i ordered but also for tomatoes as a topping.  The pizza did have tomatoes on it but it was never ordered by us.  Instead of just taking the topping off and letting me happily pay and tip they told me that because I split a topping I had to pay for 2 toppings.  I have worked in many pizza places in my day and that is just some bull.  They got the manager and the manager told me the same thing.  Train your people on what customer service is I was a loyal customer but over them charging me for an extra topping I will never visit that branch again.
MamaLee D.,"Valencia, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/8/2014,I visited BJs the other night and I had such a great time.  The hosts greeted us immediately and there was no wait! Our waiter's name was Pablo and he was great! He was on point with creating the whole BJs restaurant feeling.  Our food was amazing!  Of coarse our yummy warm cookies with ice cream were the BEST part!  we will be back in again to see Pablo and for the yummy ice cream cookies!
EQ N.,"Pasadena, CA",2,26,,4.0,9/1/2010,"Can't go wrong with BJ's.  Great place to hang out with friends and coworkers. I always order the Jeremiah Red coz I love its heavy malt taste and fruity aroma. I could also use the darker Nutty Brewnette. Servers are always friendly and helpful.  No complain here. Food is usually good but nothing spectacular.  The appetizer sampler had become our must-order thing not because of the taste but because of a few pieces of this and a few pieces of that.   In particular, I love the artichoke dip. Just tried the new item on menu -- Ahi Poke.  Well, a bit disappointed coz it is no match with what I had in Hawaii.  They missed some key ingredients to make it taste like a traditional Ahi Poke."
