Push E.,"Lancaster, CA",88,23,3,4.0,8/31/2008,"I am a huge fan of American Craftbeer and great Belgian ales. BJ's satisfies both! In addition to great beers (I like their ""Nit Wit', ""Abbey Ale"", ""Tatonka Stout"" and ""Owen's IPA"" they always have a great Belgian line-up of bottled beer. For a great lunch I highly recommend asking for a bowl of their chili, a side of rice and an empty plate to mix the two together.  Yum!  On the lighter side their salads are awesome. Highly recommended, even with kids (but NOT between 3pm and 4pm - that's shift change)."
jamie d.,"Palmdale, CA",21,38,163,4.0,2/25/2012,"Probably my fav chain out here. It's an easy go to with friends. Love the pizzas, friends like the beer, happy hour is great. Not much to complain about. This place is always packed. Happy hour includes drinks, 1/2 off appetizers, and $5 mini pizzas."
Ryan D.,"Acton, CA",1,132,1,4.0,5/13/2014,"This is essentially the Cheesecake Factory of the AV (minus the cheesecake)! Great location, great atmosphere, good food, good service, and an excellent menu selection."
John M.,"Lancaster, CA",2,37,,5.0,1/21/2012,"In all the years I have been going to BJs, I have never had a bad experience. Great food, great service, great atmosphere and great beer. The most consistently good restaurant in the AV."
Elaina A.,"Las Vegas, NV",101,29,,2.0,3/7/2012,"Bad parking, horrible service, and super salty food. I dread going here when ever someone suggests it. If you are going to watch a game and plan on drinking to much to care about bad food/ service, then you will be just fine. The noise level shouldn't bother you either. Otherwise this will not be an enjoyable experience."
Love V.,"Palmdale, CA",27,8,,5.0,4/30/2013,I love BJ's!! Their variety of food and drinks rock!
Big F.,"Lancaster, CA",4,12,1,3.0,7/14/2012,"Great service ( Jennifer ), the food was delicious and good atmosphere. The Jeremiah red beer was warm and the manager did nothing about it. But the service and the food made up for it."
Bill L.,"Lancaster, CA",0,5,1,5.0,8/16/2014,Fantastic experience! Delicious food and fun atmosphere! Thanks to Raul for taking care of us .
Randy D.,"Johannesburg, CA",45,133,3,4.0,5/20/2013,They have their own hand crafteed beers on tap. Good place to stop for a brew before a movie.
Chelsi D.,"Alpine, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/27/2014,"Brunch was not the best. Food came out cold and my husbands order was wrong, my eggs were not over easy they were cooked all the way instead of runny and they forgot my potatoes which did not look good. The service was good and the bloody Mary's and mimosas were good. Will not be going back for brunch that's for sure."
Beatrice L.,"Rosamond, CA",0,10,2,2.0,4/3/2014,"My boyfriend and I went there for dinner last Friday and the service was just terrible.  I hate to speculate but I'm pretty sure our waitress what high, from what I do not know. She took our drink/food order (because service was so slow we had ample time to browse menu).  After that we never saw here again. Randomly a waitress stopped by to give us our check. Only good thing about this place is the blonde beer and shoe string fries."
Robert S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,146,,1.0,10/5/2013,"To start, I love BJs, always have, but this visit warrants a negative review.  Our waitress was horrendous, she couldn't have given less of a s*@t about us.  We had 4 people and she would not stay at the table long enough for one person to complete a sentence, she would just rush away (no, it was not crowded).  We had to flag someone down for refills, she never asked if anyone wanted dessert and when one of us asked for dessert, she brought the checks out before the dessert.  And while she was delivering the checks, before the dessert, she knocked a full glass of water over on the table.  Our guest jumped up and managed to not get too wet, to which she replied ""that's all good then"".  Very poor service."
Lee C.,"Ridgecrest, CA",35,138,13,4.0,12/30/2011,"Had a great lunch at BJ's.  I was a little worried about finding something ""healthy"" but on the lunch specials menu they had a half flatbread pizza and salad (462 calories) for $6 something.  THe food arrived quickily and tasted fresh.  The balsamic dressing was very nice and sweet.  Service was efficient, not super friendly but I was never left wanting.  My iced tea was always full."
Sandie C.,"Lancaster, CA",8,61,3,3.0,1/1/2012,"I've enjoyed coming into this restaurant but I have to say that the service yesterday was not the norm. We met friends here for a late New Years Eve lunch.  We arrived at the restaurant at 3pm and were seated immediately.  A little while after we were seated, the wait staff took our drinks and appetizer order, brought the drinks and promptly disappeared for the next 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, the table that was seated after us received their salads promptly while we sat and waited for our waitress to return with our food.  After 45 minutes, she arrived at the table with a mute guy from the kitchen with our appetizers AND the entrees.  I requested that the entrees go back to the kitchen while we ate the entrees and her response was: ""They'll just go under the heat lamps.""  To dry out?  No thanks.  We took all the food at the table at the same time and, by the time the salads were eaten, the entrees were half cold. I wasn't so mad at the fact that the food all came out at once as I was about the waitress's attitude.  In fact, she made me bloody furious.  I came thisclose to getting into an argument but I wasn't about to stoop to that level.  Anyway, after a time, I guess she realized that we were not happy about having been ignored for so long and then having all that food dumped on us at once and so she informed the manager about the situation without me having to.  The manager was very friendly and helpful and took care of the salads and desserts and charged us only for the entrees and drinks.  I appreciated the fact that the waitress took responsibility, although she blamed the guys in the back for not bringing out the salads promptly.  Honey, it's your job to check on your tables to make sure everyone has their food in a timely manner.  After all, BJs is not cheap.  If someone has $100 to spend on lunch, there are plenty of other corporate chain restaurants to go to in Palmdale and Lancaster. Anyway, the fact that the manager took care of our tab in a professional manner means that I will return to BJs.  The food is good and I have no complaint otherwise.  Next time I'll know to flag down any member of staff when I have been sitting at the table for a while without food although the last thing I want to do when I go out to eat with friends or family is to create bad feeling with the wait staff. Given the interior decor, ambience, my personal experience so far with the food and the menu, for a casual restaurant this should really be 4 to 5 star review."
LU R.,"Staten Island, NY",32,102,9,4.0,10/13/2011,I've had  a bad experience at Bj's  in Torrance but coming to the one in Palmdale was just AMAZING! everyone was friendly and we were seated in less than 5 minutes.  Food is awesome!
Helen S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",236,485,,4.0,5/14/2011,"Half off wine on Tuesdays (ALL DAY)!!!  On top of happy hour from 10-close makes this a great place to unwind after long days at work or just to free ourselves from boredom.  I love their flat bread pizzas, ahi poke appetizer, chicken wings, stuffed mushrooms, and spinach and artichoke dip.  We usually never have a problem finding seating in the bar area as well."
Kristin M.,"Edwards AFB, CA",31,21,9,4.0,11/23/2011,"Who doesn't love BJ's. They may be a little pricy but their food is always good and they have such a variety that you can go there a hundred times and always have something different. The drinks are great too!! Let's not forget their delicious desserts either!! The food is good, service is good, drinks are good... what's not to like about this place?"
Lori D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,14,,3.0,5/5/2015,"The service was great. We went on a Sunday evening and were able to be seated right away. The hostess' were very nice and pleasant. Our waiter was very attentive. We had a party of 4. My son got the classic burger and he loved it. My daughter got the spaghetti with marinara and loved it. My husband got the thick crust pizza and stated it didn't have barely in sauce on it. I got the flatbread tomatoe/basil pizza. It tasted wonderful. However, I believe I got food poisoning. I had two pieces from it. We went to the movies after and my stomach started hurting really bad. I didn't think it was from the pizza since it was so good. The next morning I had another piece and my stomach hurt all day. I couldn't even eat anything it hurt so bad. I don't think I'll be having that pizza again. I may try something else, but not that. The dining experience was wonderful and we loved the restaurant though."
Lisa M.,"Parker, CO",11,63,,2.0,4/14/2009,"BJ's, in general, has good pizza.  This one did not.  I ordered a mini-sized BJ's Favorite pizza (their version of the classic 'everything')...I knew from experience that it's a small pizza, which was all I wanted.  This was pretty much something I'd expect to pop out of the freezer into the microwave.  There was virtually no sauce, barely any cheese, and toppings thrown on--none of it was melted together, when I picked a piece up everything fell off.  To top the whole delicious thing off, the onions were cold--I think they forgot about them until they took it out of the oven. The waitress wouldn't stop calling me sweetie, and they changed the TV from the Angels' game to basketball after I sat down.  Lame.  At least the beer was tasty, and the restaurant was well-lit and comfortable.  Not sure why this BJ's was so sub-par, but I sure wouldn't rush back."
Brittany W.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,53,35,5.0,9/1/2011,This place is really yummy. They have great food and a fun atmosphere. The Jeremiah Red brew is my favorite beer and the stuffed spinach mushrooms are addicting. I've never had anything there I didn't like and I always leave feeling satisfied.
