Jessica Z.,"Palmdale, CA",19,190,48,4.0,7/27/2011,"BJ's is really good. Im not fond of their workers, but their food is delish. My two favorite things are the parmesan crusted chicken, and the seared ahi tuna. So yummy. Of course you cant forget a pazooki. Down side, its always so loud and crowded!"

Randy S.,"Denver, CO",139,223,,3.0,11/16/2008,"BJ's was recommended by the hotel staff, some guests at the hotel and some work associates. It is located around the perimeter of the mall in Palmdale, one of several eateries similarly situated. Think big, huge, cavernous  (this place is really gigantic). There was no wait on recent evening as my dinner mate and I strolled in. I'm no longer a beer lover but I still can appreciate a good brewhouse.  The huge interior space is decently and modernly decorated. The bar area is really long and big (okay, enough 'big' words already) and another dining area surrounds it  (with open walls though) . i ordered a high maintenance cocktail and my friend had the pumpkin ale. We then ordered food and more drink - me, the four beer sampler; him, the seven beer sampler. The buffalo wings came out as regular friend chicken wings with blue cheese drizzled over them with the buffalo sauce on the side (what the hell???) ; I had never seen that before! But the burger was decently tasty. The menu is quite extensive with a Friday's style menu, however, the local beer brews were quite good.  And since it is looking like I will be a more frequent visitor to the area, I'll be back."
Hyong Y.,"Suwanee, GA",41,85,2,3.0,3/14/2011,"I goto Palmdale, CA for work often, and I ike to go out for drinks with my customers.  However, one day, customer asked me if i liked BJs...  I replied... well i'm no different than the next guy, but why you ask...  I laughed after my reply.  Then he clarified that he was referring to the BJs brewhouse.  I felt like a j@#$ass.  Anywho, good beer and i do enjoy their own brew beer (very hoppy).  Food isn't too bad.  little step up from the bar food. I already get their personal pan pizza.  Loaded with toppings and freshly made.  Service is also pretty good.  I recommend this place if anyone is visiting palmdale, ca."
Mike G.,"Clovis, CA",5,124,9,5.0,3/1/2011,"Been there for dinner twice now.  So I'm traveling solo on business and staying nearby so it was an easy choice the first time.  My first experience brought me back.  Sat in the bar again to watch the SLakers horse around with a future contraction team.  Sad performance by both teams, but I digress... My server, Valerie was wonderful (and very cute)!  Great eye contact.  She was very attentive, but not pushy.  Checked in but didn't pester like some do.  I had a Nutty Brewnette to start things off.  MMmmmm.... Very good.  I then ordered the ceasar salad and the Mediteranean mini pizza.  Valerie recommended it over the BJ's combo pizza.  I think she used the term 'Yummy""? Salad came out in two minutes.  Fresh, crispy and just right on the dressing.  Just as my salad was gone, the mini arrived.  It looks funky with all the Kalamata olives, tomatoes, chicken, peperoncinis, pesto and Feta cheese but it's has a GREAT taste!  Every bite was a little different.  It was hot and ready to eat right away.  I usually add stuff to my pizza to make it better.  I never doctored this one - it was primo as received.  One more Brewnette and I was complete. No complaints whatsoever.  $22 out the door with a nice tip.  Looking forward to my next road-trip already."
Eboni B.,"Los Angeles, CA",279,24,3,1.0,5/8/2011,"Every time I have gone here with my girlfriends we ALWAYS receive HORRIBLE service.  The Bartenders are cocky, inattentive and don't deserve to be behind the bar.  The last visit there I had to let the Manager know that as a former employee in the service industry...the way they treated customers was unacceptable on more than one occasion.  It's a shame because I LOVE the food.  I just cannot and will  not spend any more of my hard on money at an establishment that doesn't treat it's customers with any respect."
Mihir M.,"Fremont, CA",307,821,493,5.0,4/14/2011,"Just went with my cousin for sodas - the orange cream was great. Outstanding service, though our bill was small, from Stephanie B."
Mike G.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,97,20,4.0,2/21/2011,A great place to hang out with your friends. Food is excellent. the homebrews are great...tatonka!!
D S.,"Palmdale, CA",0,17,,2.0,7/17/2011,"Arrived Saturday 7:pm party of three, we ordered Crispy Fried Artichokes and Gourmet Mac & Cheese (10 out of 10). The other two people in our party, there dinners were fine (7 or 8's) I ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop (trying to count calories) Well this was a disaster, this ultra thin cut of Pork Chop was very over cooked (note to cook: thin cuts of meat have to be cooked quickly) and they under cooked the green beans and potatoes. And the knife they provided could not cut the meat or the veggies, I ordered a burger (great burgers) as a replacement. The mgr. gave us one free desert and took the chop off the bill."
Michael T.,"Hayward, CA",21,119,3,4.0,12/5/2010,Was here with wifey got the BJ special pizza and a crispy chicken salad and a nutty to wash it down. Beers good the pizza is not bad either. Like how BJ is consistent with their service even at different location and surprisingly the food is the same at different chains. Nice place to drop by and watch some sports.
Jay P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,47,1,2.0,6/2/2013,Super slow service during weekday lunch (probably because of the cheap lunch specials).  Tomato bisque had a layer of grease on the top.  Spaghetti with meat sauce nothing special.
Lacy F.,"Lancaster, CA",0,17,,5.0,12/11/2013,I love this place. My favorite in town. The service is always great and they treat the kids so nicely.
Maria F.,"Wrightwood, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/11/2013,We had a party of 11 today and were very happy with the service and food!  Brandon did an excellent job of attending to our table!  We had a group that included ages 4-82 and all of our orders were correct.  This was a very enjoyable meal!
CJ J.,"Irvine, CA",1367,1047,570,4.0,2/28/2008,"Good times at BJ's. Had a loooooong row of tables at the bar area. BEST WAITRESS EVER - SUMMER! (A friend's friend of course = great service!) Frambois was good. Their own Hef was good. Spinach and Artichoke pizza was good but really oily. Onion straw stringy thingys were good with the non-white sauce (it's like a reddish or orangy color?).  They have one of those revolving doors, which is oh so cute! :) People tip horrible here or don't tip at all, SO REMEMBER TO TIP YOUR WAITERS/WAITRESSES!"
Dania R.,"Rosamond, CA",59,248,76,4.0,8/18/2012,"I hate chain food.  But I love the multitude of menu options that make this an easy place to dine Paleo in the AV.  The salad menu is fabulous.  My most recent experience involved the thai mango salad which came out with bright fresh pieces of produce... and although the salad was initially missing the grilled chicken, the problem was QUICKLY ameliorated by our server.  There are ""chapters"" of options for meat and veggies.  I've been pleasantly satisfied with the service during each visit.  On non-strict Paleo days, I love the massive selection of beers and have yet to be disappointed.  BJ's is probably the only chain near the mall that I will go to.  The other options have yet to be satisfactory in the food quality and atmosphere department.  I do love that BJ's has screens in almost every direction for watching games that I don't get at home and when my husband and I don't feel like conversing while we're eating."
Michael L.,"Navy Yard, Washington, DC",16,33,5,4.0,8/13/2008,"MAINSTREAM, but still good.   Compared to other BJ's and considering the lack of alternatives in the AV I gave ours no more than 4 stars. In my heart, you really can't mess up a brewhouse. Micro-brewed beers and Belgium's brews are my favorite drinks to explore and BJ's just happens to provide some of the ones I've already chosen to indulge in (wherever available). They don't have as big of a selection as true Brewhouses, but for a family-friendly restaurant they've done a good job.    They have good pizza, food (I assume) and appetizers. You won't find me rating too much on the food here since I'm a semi(?)-vegetarian. I go for the beer and atmosphere.  BJ's floor has two levels and somewhat of a partition that has a good balance in separating the bar area from the dining.  The staff, for the most part, is efficient and friendly. If or when you do encounter that one who is not so friendly and/or efficient, accept that life happens. No establishment can keep 100% customer satisfaction and pampering, even if they tried.   Overall I think BJ's has been good enough to me to make it my go-to place for drinks and merriment if I do choose to stay within the desolate gates of the Antelope Valley."
Carla T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,7,,3.0,10/4/2013,Food is good. Prices are reasonable. Manager is a really good person. We went there on last Sunday. There was a long wait. Even after we ordered food there was a long waiting time.
sooz r.,"Quartz Hill, CA",2,85,8,5.0,11/15/2010,"Avacado egg rolls and a Hefeweizen, Yum! Great atmosphere, great service, amazing pizza.  Get the flavor sampler beers and flavor sampler pizzookies!"
Aaron M.,"Indianapolis, IN",78,108,153,5.0,2/26/2010,First time I've eaten at a BJ's. Now I see what the fuss is about. Food is really great and the beers are fantastic. Service was really good even for our party of 15 on a Saturday. Well done.
Adam D.,"Palmdale, CA",81,15,1,1.0,11/9/2014,"Have not been here in 3 years and will never visit here again. Worst experience ive ever had in a restaurant ever. First we had a bigger group of people with us maybe about 10 people and we waited 4 hours yes 4 hours just to sit down with no appolagies or anything. If this was not my brother in laws birthday I would of walked out hours earlier.  Once we sat down it was 10pm remember we arrived at 6pm. We ordered are food without too many issues. When we went to pay they split the checks up. I was very cautious only spending around 15$ due to my bank account being pretty low. They ended up charging 5 peoples bills to my card racking up around 120$ bill. I tried to explain to them that i was now negative in my bank account and they brushed it off and told me it wasnt a big deal. I told the waitress what i was trying to explain and she BLEW up on me screaming at me telling me ""i dont know how hard her job is!"" I stood there speechless about what had just happend. She called security to escort me out of the restaurant. The manager knowing i did nothing wrong came out and talked with me about my debit card but wouldnt address the fact that his waitress just screemed in my face and kicked me out. I love bjs but after that incident my entire family all refuses to visit this horrible restaurant. You lost around 20 big customers you will never get back due to not simply apologizing to me..."
