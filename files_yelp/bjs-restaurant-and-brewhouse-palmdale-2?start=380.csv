Jim p.,"Palmdale, CA",2,47,2,4.0,9/9/2010,"Always got a good meal every time I have gone.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and love the salmon the best. Also love the clam chowder!!!!! The only problem I have had with this BJ's is ordering food to go. I have ordered at least a dozen times with them online, and I have never once got my order right, complete dinner have been missing, soup or salad are missing most the time. Make sure if you ever order with them online you check everything you get. Oh ya and when you call to let them know, they could care less about it, like it happens all the time."
Duke R.,"Lancaster, CA",0,56,,1.0,6/2/2011,"Those two stars are for the taste only. I've been going to BJ's forever. The woodland hills location was a great joint 10 years ago. Since then I know they've outsourced the beer making, fired at least on brewmaster. Raise thier prices exponentially decreased portion sizes and generally become much much worse. This BJ's is the second worst I've ever been too. (valencia is the absolute worst.) The beer always tastes like the tap lines haven't been cleaned since the place opened, the service has become horrible. I wouldn't go here at all if my in laws didn't like it. Dreadful."
Eric S.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,3.0,11/19/2009,"Went there with my Brother and Mother for lunch. We all enjoyed our food and the portion size. I had the Santa Fe salad with Salmon. Good, but not great. The beer was very nice. I had their American Pale. A nice crisp ale. Stick to the beers though. I first ordered a Bloody Mary, which looked nice, but extremely weak. The Service was also good, and we were checked on after food arrived promptly. We ordered a pot roast entree to go after we began eating, and they brought it to us in good time, nicely packaged. The roast smelled like grandma's house. That's a good thing. Oh yeah, oatmeal raisin pizookie!"
Gavin J.,"Simi Valley, CA",1,23,,2.0,11/17/2010,Place is not very good. Service can take forever...the chips are gross and the deep dish individual pizzas usually look like bread bowls with  cheese on top of  soup. !Yuck!
H G.,"Melbourne, FL",0,17,,3.0,11/6/2010,"If you can, I would suggest driving to the BJ's in Valencia. This BJ's somehow has the worst service of all the BJ's I've been to. Do not sit in the bar area for a meal!!!!! The waitresses will ignore you if you are not a group of young guys. Seriously. For food, it's a chain, the food is prepared like other BJ's and the beer is great."
William P.,"Palmdale, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/8/2011,"I love Bj's, the restaurant. Handsome building and interior. Great ambiance whether it's slow or very busy.  The food if very good for a casual dining/sports bar type of place.  I like that there are cloth napkins and heavy duty silverware.  It seems the owners pay attention to the details.   If I could make their California burger at home, I'd never leave.  Sour dough slices on the griddle, the tenderest hamburger ever, green chiles, avocado, pepper jack cheese, chipolte mayo AND ranch dressing all subtly blend together in a melt in you mouth comfort food burger unlike any other burger.  The shrimp dishes are great cause the shrimp is so tender and flavorful.  The coffee is good.  I haven't had everything on the menu but it seems as though each item I've had has been given special attention so that it's not run of the mill.   The prices are very reasonable compared to Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Famous Dave's all on restaurant row too but not as good.   The service is always friendly and appearing to be enjoying their work, even the busboys look like they're having fun.   All in all, a great casual yet well done place. I recommend it for brunch on the weekends although the menu is limited, lunch and dinner.   I suspect that people who complain too harshly about the service have 'service problems' wherever they go.  I know people like that and it's a pain to go out to dinner with them. We used to joke about one gal who would practically order 1 egg scrambled and the other over easy, and want to substitute this and that and I would feel so sorry for the server. And, it they couldn't do what she asked, she would start all over with a different selection.  I think those marks on her neck were from waitresses trying to strangle her during previous visits. These types never, ever think it's THEM that is the problem.   Bon Appetit!"
John D.,"Palmdale, CA",0,26,,3.0,5/12/2009,"Food:  It was good.  I had the Parmesan crusted chicken breast dinner.  My kids had the chicken fettucini, and my wife one of those huge baked potatoes.  They liked it. Service:  It was good.  The waitress we had kept refilling our drinks, and making sure our food was good. All-in-all, a good restaurant experience.  I'd come here again."
Amber H.,"Orange, CA",35,76,1,1.0,7/18/2011,"Although the food is very good, management was extremely poor. Went in and ordered off of the happy hour menu 10 minutes prior to the actual start of happy hour, and the waiter didn't realize we were slightly early. Asked management to adjust check or at least comp us for happy hour prices in some way, and he would not budge. We explained we would never return, and he did not care. Will never go there again."
Deborah S.,"Palmdale, CA",21,87,2,5.0,6/2/2009,"I love going at lunch and having a blonde & the lunch special sit at the bar nice folks fun place great prices,  2 blondes & a hef it was so fun ."
Corey G.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,42,49,4.0,10/28/2009,"I always enjoy stopping by, getting a margarita and picking up some takeout. Yummy"
Bill S.,"Lancaster, CA",0,22,,2.0,3/2/2014,"we have been going there for many years and loved it but the last few time we have gone have taught us a lesson.....we took about 12 people there back in Oct. for my daughters graduation dinner and the service and the food were terrible. It took us over and hour and a half to finally get our meals, and never did get any refills on drinks. the waiter spent his time at another table across from us where a bunch of drunk ladies with low tops were sitting getting drunk.. The food finally did come out and most of it was COLD and tasteless. The place was so crowded you could not move and understaffed as well. We finally went back again this past Thursday Feb 27th. well the place was over crowded again and understaffed, the young lady waiting our table did the best job she could and it was fine. The place is just way to LOUD, CROWDED, and the food quality has gone way down. The salads we have were soaking in dressing so bad you could not it them and my burger was ok but the bun was soaking wet and very hard to pick up....so I guess we will pass on dinner here again. The lunch time food and service is great so I guess it will be lunch there sometimes..."
Rasheezy V.,"Palmdale, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/26/2010,"So I have always loved Bj's anywhere I go. I think it's one of ""thee"" best chains. Absolutely love the deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. Pizookie must be the greatest desert to hit the planet. Oh, also loved the blackened salmon. Service is always good. The only negative marks they get are ""pizza-to-go"". For some reason by the time u get it home, it loses it's crispness and disappoints greatly. Other than that, Bjs Palmdale will see my business again and again!!"
Robin C.,"Pearblossom, CA",0,17,,3.0,4/17/2008,"This isn't gourmet food, it's basically a very classy sports bar, with tv screens playing more than one channel all over the place, but it's fun and it's cool if you're in the mood. The revolving door going into the place starts off the experience on a good note, and once inside, it's like an emporium, with the huge bar and bar seating area to the right, and the step-up booths and 'normal' tables on the left.  It's relaxing even with the high-energy atmosphere, and the food is more than passable. The drinks are ok, not top-flight.  They use terrible olives in the martinis - as a drink I recommend either beer, Aussie wine or the Tangueray  Perfect No. 10, pure gin with a lime wedge - - NOT a twist, as they describe on the menu; this place is not really attentive to the little details.    In fact, the first two times we were there, they got our order wrong.  We came back a third time because I still thought the place had potential.   The fries are the best thing on the menu, I think - they're thick and crunchy, coated with this really good seasoning, a winner hands down.  Also good is the THIN CRUST sausage/basil appetizer pizza; you could easily have two of those as a main course and leave a happy camper.  I'm from NYC (as I keep writing, blah blah blah) and I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza although I did try it the first time we came here and I rest my case. Don't recommend it.  What I do suggest most hardily is the wedge salad ~ this rocks, plain and simple, a winning combo of tastes that I make at home now every time I can find a decent iceberg lettuce at a supermarket (easier said than done, these days)."
Kim B.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,1,5.0,11/21/2011,"Had a terrific experience with a very large party.  Thomas the manager was above terrific.  We had a medical emergency at our table and he handled it with the utmost professionalism.  When we requested separate family checks he didn't bat an eye and honored our request.  Or server, Conner was a great server considering we needed a lot of attention!   Vanessa the hostess was so helpful and polite.  On a busy Saturday evening they were so good to us we will be back!"
Oscar D.,"Palmdale, CA",266,42,6,2.0,7/28/2011,the service has improved throughout the years. but not a place i would goto drink or hang out at.
Tricia M.,"Pacoima, CA",27,161,,4.0,3/24/2008,"hey...when my SIL calls me @ work and tells me to get my ass on up to palmdale to play a little ""let's see who can drink the most"" @ BJ's...there's really not much to do but....GET MY ASS ON UP TO PALMDALE!...which is exactly what i did. after 2 hours of battling traffic from calabasas to palmdale... i arrive at my destination.  we pick up my sis...and we're on our way. we arrive and mainline it to the bar.  my bro moves forward and gives the eager ""are you leaving"" looks to whomever will catch his glance.  we end up grabbing seats in the far corner...and the debauchery begins: my bro starts handling the orders...pitchers of piranha and totanka start a-flowin'.  my sis handles biz & orders the avocado eggrolls and the SIL makes sure her man is fed & orders the BJ's Special Pizza. pint after pint seems to disappear from my glass...saturday morning i wake up in my bro's spare bedroom with my body hurting from noggin to big toe.  my sis calls me soon after complaining how buzzed she stills is (while getting a pedicure).  my SIL later ""reminds"" me that after visiting BJ's, her & i were bouncing like two ADD kids on her friend's trampoline...jeezus...AND...later on that day i remember the two military blokes that i chatted up on the way out...cutie-patooties... final analysis: BJ's is a great place to be...as long as you leave out the trampoline..."
Gregg N.,"Cerritos, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/15/2013,"Service was awful.  The 3 of us went to BJs at 8pm on Wed Mar 13, later than usual so to avoid the dinner rush.   Well, after about 45 minutes after placing our order, we asked the waitress, why the delay?   She apologized and said she would check on our order.  Well, she never came back.  So after another 15 minutes of waiting, we flagged  the hostess and asked very politely if we could have something on the house for such a long wait since its been an hour since we ordered and we need something to hold us over.    She said she would check and let us know.  Well, she came back and told us that its been only 51 minutes and not an hour but she apologized for the long wait and checked on our order.  She immediately came back and said our order will be done shortly.   We finally got our food 10 minutes later and when I looked at my watch, it was 9:12pm.   My disappointment really stems from the waitress not warning us that it would be a very long wait when we placed our order and the fact we had to ask several times for status.  The food was good but a bit overpriced and the people polite but service was just awful.    We usually go to Fresco's next door whenever we visit Palmdale and we thought we would try something different.    Well, this was my first and last time dining at BJs Palmdale.   I will never come back.  The only time I may ever come back is to have some beer but forget about ordering  appetizers or dinner."
Lisa P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1198,1166,,4.0,11/25/2007,I would go back when I am in the area. Was good and cheap and also crowded. I was only here because my friend just moved to Palmdale.
Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",174,309,12,5.0,1/7/2008,"I was up here visiting some friends in the Air Force, and we were looking for something to do, so we stopped in here on a Saturday night.  Needless to say the place was packed, and for a table for 6, it was an hour wait.  So I took the buzzer and went to the bar.  A couple sitting at one of the larger tables offered my friend and me the other two chairs at their table, so I sat down and chatted with them while my friend went to get us drinks and my other friends were parking the car.  The couple I was sitting with were just finishing their meal when SURPRISE!  their buzzer went off.  They asked me if I wanted it, so of course I said yes (keep in mind this was even before my friend came back with my drink), took the buzzer to the host stand, and told them I actually needed a table for 6.  They seated us right away!  We went from an hour wait to less than 5 minutes!  Then, on top of that, we had 2 more join us at our table and were immediately accomodated!  I had the shrimp scampi pasta, and my friend had pizza-- both were delicious and great, large portions!"
