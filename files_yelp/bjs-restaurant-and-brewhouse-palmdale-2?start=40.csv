Monica W.,"Palmdale, CA",75,3,1,2.0,6/6/2017,"Went here today for lunch. It was very busy due to graduations and there was a long wait for a table so we sat at the bar. Now given that it was busy its understandable that the food took a little longer than normal to come but when the food came I specifically asked if I should order my pizookie now so that it would be ready by the time we finished eating and packed to go since we had to head back to work. The server said oh no it comes out right away, better wait till you are almost done eating. So I did. 20min. later I'm a little irritated that I  am still waiting for this pizookie to come out, finally it does and we leave. Get to work open it up and become immediately irritated again! What I got does not even look like a pizookie. Very disappointed and doubt I will be going back to BJ's for a while."
Linh U.,"Alhambra, CA",111,38,110,3.0,6/25/2017,"Consistency is key to good food/restaurants. Unfortunately this particular BJ's doesn't have it. Some days the food, the rib eye in particular, is amazing, and other times, it's absolute trash. Funny enough, I've had the better cooked version when I had ordered it to go. I dined in last night with the boyprend and family, and 5 people out of 7 ordered the steak. Only one person got theirs cooked just right. The rest of the medium rares were practically medium well to well done. I know you can always ask them to take it back, but there's always that risk that the chef will be unhappy and do something unpleasant to your meal lol.. I liked when one of the servers was asking us to cut into 2 of our steaks prior, but two other servers came out with the last steaks and just dropped them and ran. Even A1 couldn't save the dry chewy piece of moo that was given to us. At least the sides were somewhat redeeming of the meal itself.  On the bright side, the alcohol is pretty good here. The frozen strawberry splash was delicious, it just tastes like a strawberry smoothie. Their Long Island ice teas are bomb as well. They have a lot of options but they can get heavy with the ice.  Tl; dr I would stick to just the burgers and pizza here, and that's it."
Aleese J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,37,,2.0,11/12/2017,"We stopped off here for an early dinner.  I ordered a calamari appetizer and a tortilla soup.  The tortilla soup was terrible.  First it looked unappetizing...very thick and salty, the consistency of watery baby food.  Then the calamari was lukewarm and soft and didn't appear freshly made.  My partners steak was dry and thin....not sure what was going on but I've never had such poor food here. Our waitress was very nice and efficient which made the experience a bit more positive."
Jim U.,"Southgate, MI",1,124,13,4.0,8/9/2016,"A little pricey for what you get, but descent food and descent portions.  Happy hour is only in the bar area.  Found that out the expensive way. Seating is very slow for a larger group unless you call ahead or use the App.  Smaller groups is usually never a long wait, unless they are packed. The beer is good and they have a large variety.  I'd go back, but I would definitely recommend getting the app, which is a little buggy, but saves time waiting on a table."
Jason S.,"Lancaster, CA",91,17,,2.0,3/19/2017,I guess the food is okay but every time we order from these fools and we order for 12 plus people. They screw it up. Who puts ketchup and mustard on a chicken club sandwich?. Apparently BJs does. Amerifab they made the sandwich the exact opposite way I ordered it.
Nora R.,"Littlerock, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/25/2017,"So pizza, loaded potatoes , asparagus , ribs and sirloin steak were bomb!!!!!Mac n cheese was trash , artichoke dip was trash(apple bees has a better one)  and my waiter had so many tables that he messed up my order.  Ambiance was super chill and casual."
Debra G.,"Palmdale, CA",0,29,,1.0,8/15/2017,"We used to love coming here.  My teenagers loved it too.  Service has consistently been terrible.  I've actually had to get up and wait at the front for my check.  I think the servers are overworked and need help. Another major annoyance is that they don't take ""same day"" reservations.  We called in the afternoon for a party of four for my daughter's birthday.  Was told it was their ""policy"" not to take same day reservations.  So I asked if I could make a next day reservation.  The hostess did not know how to answer.  She said it's not their policy.  I asked what the policy was.  She did not know.  I asked to be transferred to the manager and the manager could not explain the policy, only said that sometimes they have large parties and cannot take reservations.  Makes sense, but why not have your hostess tell people that or just say, we don't take reservations?  Won't be coming here again.  Many other choices in walking distance with much better service."
Rich M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,5,3,1.0,4/2/2017,"Horrible service.  I think the waiter forgot to put our order in..  He told us he would check on our food but never came back.  30 mins after ordering, the food came out looking rushed.. The chicken on my plate under cooked.. I sent it back At this point I was over it.. I asked for the bill, but the manager took care of it.."
Daniel J.,"Pasadena, CA",219,79,814,4.0,10/5/2015,"My family and I have gone to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse a few times over the years, and we always enjoy our visits.  More recently, we came twice within the last month, and this review is based on these two visits.  Here's a quick summary on the details of this rating, for both visits:      - Atmosphere.............................5 stars      - Efficiency.................................4 stars      - Host.........................................5 stars      - Waitress...................................5 stars       - Our meals................................3 stars      - Overall rating...........................3+ / 4- stars The atmosphere at BJ's is really nice. They've got a great bar area, plenty of seating options for larger parties, and nice cozy seating areas for those out on a date.  It has a nice layout, is well lit inside and has a good wholesome feel to it.  My family and I were quickly seated, for both of our recent visits, in a nice big booth in one corner of the restaurant and it was rather pleasant both times.   During our first visit, we were seated by a nice young lady in a corner booth during a busy time.  She was friendly, but I don't remember her name.  During our most recent visit, we were seated by Jonathan, and he was extremely professional and friendly.  We waited for just a few minutes while he did everything he could to quickly find us a nice big booth for my large family.  BJ's is lucky to have Jonathan; he's a real pro! During our first visit, our waitress was Jolin, and she was friendly, professional, and she had a great personality. We had a few tricky orders specifically related to food allergies and she was very patient in explaining details related to ingredients in their food. She also provided us with a menu detailing the items that they have related to folks with allergies. She was awesome!  Also, thanks to the management at BJ's for creating this menu, because it is really helpful for families like mine.   During our most recent visit, we had Kaytlen as our waitress.  Once again, we were lucky to get another totally awesome waitress that was friendly and patient with our complicated orders.  Kudos again to the management at BJ's for hiring awesome waitresses!    Our meals were pretty good during both of our visits, but each time there was something disappointing about the meal. During our first visit, my kids' meals looked delicious and they were all impressed.  My meal, on the other hand, was below average during our first visit, where the bacon cheeseburger I ordered appeared to have unusually fatty and low-quality bacon on it.  The bacon seemed to reduce the overall experience of eating the burger instead of the opposite.     Our meals during our second visit were opposite, where my meal was above average and my kids' meals were below average.  The disappointment during this latter visit included two pizza meals that were noticeably over-cooked, and a delayed meal delivery for one of my kids by several minutes, in addition to it having an incorrect side dish.      In summary, I think that BJ's is a great option for lots of folks in the AV with an excellent atmosphere and an awesome staff that interacts with their customers.  This BJ's could definitely do a better job in the kitchen, where arguably the most important function of any restaurant takes place."
Jorge R.,"Lancaster, CA",6,8,,2.0,9/2/2017,Waste of time...food is average at best...you must be drunk to really enjoy it...luckily it's a brew house
Dawn G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",360,11,15,2.0,12/30/2016,"Food was good like always but our service wasn't great . Kevin our waiter disappeared for about 20 minutes.  No refills for us..nothing.  Finally came back after I flagged him down and asked for a refill , box and pazookie. But didn't take our plates away.   I think we'll go to The Yard house next time."
Mark A.,"Quartz Hill, CA",5,44,18,1.0,2/27/2017,Hands down worst service ever. Took forever for our food to arrive and when it did mine was horrible.  Fish and chips was so oil soaked I could have squeezed it out and had enough to do a oil change on my car. Sent back food and went with out wanted to get the heck out of there. Will never recommend or return. Very bad!!! GO to YARD HOUSE or CLAIM JUMPERS!!!
Nikole S.,"Cerritos, CA",31,36,3,5.0,2/26/2017,"We don't eat here very often due to past experiences and poor service. Yesterday we went to celebrate our Grandpa's birthday and this was his choice of restaurant.  It was lunch time and busy but they were able to seat our table of 5 fairly quickly. Our server Brian was one of the best servers we have had in a long time, anywhere. He was really sweet, fast, efficient and so nice!  I'm a vegetarian and decided to try the ""barbacoa"" cauliflower tacos and WOW I was impressed, they were delicious! I highly recommend them to anyone, I got them with out the cheese.  Thank you to Brian for helping us have a great lunch with our Grandpa! We will be back again."
steve s.,"Lancaster, CA",0,7,,4.0,8/31/2017,Great variety of food here. Beer is reasonable too. Place can get somewhat crowded so plan ahead.
Alyssa R.,"Palmdale, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/13/2017,"I just came to BJs around 4:30 on November 12 we walked in was told they would seat us in just a moment. Our name was called no later than 5 minute wait time ( perfect). Got seated ask for a high chair my husband and I are dining with a 2 year old. We waited about 10 minutes before someone came to ask for our drink order. (Our 2 year old was getting very impatient) finally came and got an order on our drinks. I asked for a Paloma which the waitress explained to me she wouldn't recommend so I asked for a black berry margarita which she said was her favorite. The drink was very bitter I wouldn't recommend it or maybe we caught the bartender on a wrong night. We order the artichoke and spinach dip with chips appetizer took about 15 to 20 minutes for it to come out... when it did it was warm to cold as if it had been sitting there for a while. Which was weird because the bowl the dip was in was really hot so I don't know how the dip would be cold. Finally ordered our meals came out great on time and hot. We order a pazookie for dessert the cookie was very under cooked under the top layer was pure dough the flavor was great texture not so much. I'm leaving the review for the service although our waitress was not rude she was not as attentive to our table as she was with other tables she was serving our empty plates stayed there so there was a lot of clutter on our table she never came to ask us for refill even for our toddler. I hadn't been to bjs in years because every time I past by its always packed with a 45 minute wait time. You would think it would be better. I think the wait time has to do with the slow service in there. Idk for better service and food go anywhere else..  (Yard house, claim jumpers).  I won't be going back anytime soon"
Christina M.,"Palmdale, CA",12,9,,2.0,11/26/2016,"If you're looking for a mediocre dining experience -- look no further! BJs is just that place! My husband and I seem to have collective amnesia. We'll go to BJ's - and one of us invariably has either an ordering mishap (wrong thing comes out), the food is cold, or some other oddity (last time we went I ordered a cream soda and the bottom of the mug literally FELL OFF, but that's okay because after getting utterly soaked by the cream soda they comped... just the drink. How generous!) Then we swear off going back to BJ's -- only to go back after a few months. Well -- no more! As the kids say, I can't even with this place.  (I'm giving it more than one star because I like the potato skins.)"
Alvin M.,"Kailua, HI",0,3,,1.0,8/23/2017,"We had lunch at BJ,s  on 7/23/17 and on 07/30/17 both days the waiter didn't know what they were doing are just didn't care. The service were bad the dishes was dirty.BJ,S need to hire new waiter  before you loose your good customer something  to think about."
Gabriel R.,"Lancaster, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2017,"First post on here and unfortunately its a negative one. Live and work locally so I come to this location often. Came last night to celebrate a birthday in the family. 45 min wait for a table, granted we were a party of 11 so I could understand that. Evening went down hill from seating in. Could tell they were short staffed, but most of us waited 20 plus min for drinks, we were there from 8pm till 945pm and in that time I got only 2 refills and I had to ask for it from a different waiter. Ordered steak medium came out cold and well done. By the time my food actually arrived most of my other party had already finished. Sent it back, no apologies no manager to see what the issue was. I had to look for a manager and actually talk to her. Nobody was apologetic, finally I had to ask for water since I was still thirsty. But guess what that bill sure did come on time. Never once was I asked how the meal went. This sis not the first time come here for work many times and they always struggle with large parties. To add insult I still paid over 95 dollars in the tab for horrible food and service and I never even got to eat. Hopefully they get better but honestly I think multiple times is to much to keep going back. Hopefully manage my sees the comment and actually addresses the issues."
David M.,"Quartz Hill, CA",12,14,,3.0,11/30/2016,"Well over the last few months we have stopped several times and the food and service has been great (eat at the restaurant).  The problem seems to be with the take out orders. Not sure if they figure you are leaving and by the time you get home it isn't worth coming back and complaining or as I did tonight just dumped it in the trash because I was so tweeted.  Ordered a brewhouse CHEESE burger without lettuce or tomatoes. What we received was a full sized bun, a 2/3 sized burger and nothing else as in no cheese sauce etc. With this we ordered an extra order of fries. Waste of money. I should have counted the fries. There might have been 30.  The only reason I am giving a third star is my wife enjoyed her meal.  Use caution when ordering take out. They have an issue with order taking and portion sizes."
Matt S.,"Lancaster, CA",0,5,,2.0,11/4/2017,West to Bjs restaurant witj my family on 11/4/2017. Asked for a medium rare brisket bacon burger. What I recieved was a well done dry hockey puck.
