Brian P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,22,,1.0,11/17/2016,"Disaster. Came for an after work celebration with a medium sized group. Arrived at 748 per the text to wait for a table. Short wait, maybe 10 minutes. It's 919, and we just left without being served any entrees. Here is a sample of the awfulness..... -Took about 20 mins for a drink and app order. -Wanted to order entrees then but server told is not to at that point. Never had that happen before. - Another 10ish mins for drinks to arrive. Allowed by server to order food. - Server spilled a beer all over the place, including on some on the group. Mess was promptly ignored for entire evening. Slip hazard.  - Around 9 we went to the front to complain. Sup came by to confirm our suspicions, out food was forgotten. Offered to put in new orders and apologized.  - Server never returned. Although we did get multiple wrong drinks ordered at other tables."
A T.,"Palmdale, CA",2,39,116,4.0,7/20/2017,Great service and excellent food every time! The booths are comfy. The place can be a bit loud and crowded on holidays.
Marquez Y.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/14/2017,-1 star if I could. We are here waiting to be seated for over 1 hr and that's fine. But a couple next to us just walked in and because they know the waitress they get to sit in less that 10 minutes. what??? I'm next to them listening to their conversation and the waiter tells him just wait as soon as I get a chance I'll sit you guys. Oh wow   Never again will I be coming here again. Then as I'm walking out I see the waiter sitting some other friends. And no don't give me the excuse that they had reservations because I know how this rolls  Don't recommend this place. For good pizza go Pizza experience!!!!
Brent V.,"Lancaster, CA",21,15,,5.0,7/30/2017,"I'll say this is my wife's and I go to place to eat! Food is always great, always end up getting a good server, and you just can't beat there cookies and ice cream."
Nisha J.,"Palmdale, CA",760,7,1,2.0,10/29/2016,"Bjs take out needs help. We ordered and paid for $60 dollars worth of food.  The pizza was the usual BJ's standard of excellence ($26 dollars for the large .  However, the Baked Ziti needs work. No meatballs or Sauce as describe. I really think it was the child's plate. No additional sides as fillers and I used my baby's ABC Ruler when I took picks for comparison . My hubby is not a happy camper! I  order out to save me grief and cooking, but even I am disappointed with this meal and I  am watching calories! By the way, this is the first review, I have felt it warrants writing about ."
Joanna B.,"San Dimas, CA",9,55,36,5.0,5/19/2017,"Love this Bjs they always get my order correct and have welcoming friendly staff. Pazoookies are the best, food is delicious and it's very affordable. Me and the hubby come here atleast once week for a quick bite or for dinner! Thanks bjs for never letting us down"
Jonny L.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",27,90,114,4.0,5/6/2016,"We have dined here on numerous occasions while traveling. If your looking for consistent quality of food and service, this is a good bet. Like most BJ's, early evenings on weekends will require a wait of more than 30 minutes.  Tonight we had a Spicy Pig Tavern pizza, Calamari and Siracha Brussels Sprouts. Two of the Three scored well, with the Calamari coming up way short due to them being overlooked. We pointed this out to our server, Dominic. He quickly made things right and we countered the squid choice with a wedge salad. He was apologetic and seemed eager to make our experience feel right, which he did. Kudos to him for being attentive. Overall, if you want a consistent meal and a good sip, this stop is worth it, especially if you get the right server."
Zack L.,"Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles, CA",47,1,,1.0,10/15/2017,"Decided to take my girlfriend to the first place we met and then see a movie afterwards. Well, I made a huge mistake. Paid $25 for a rib eye that was way under cooked for what I asked for and didn't notice because I started on the smaller end. After trying to chew my way through it I gave up about halfway when I noticed it was almost bleeding. As of 3am this morning I've had horrible stomach pains, diarrhea and vomiting. I'll never be coming back."
Jan O.,"Palmdale, CA",0,14,,2.0,10/11/2017,"Amazing. On 9-2-17 my wife and I dined at the Palmdale store for her 73rd birthday and had a rather bad experience which I posted on Yelp the next day, 9-3-17. On 10-2-17... ONE MONTH LATER I received a reply from the store manager Jesse Thomason who wanted me to contact him so he ""could make this right.""  He was not available the next day so I called him again the following day; he was all apologetic and said he would talk to his employees immediately. He also asked for my e-mail address so he could send me an e-mail with ""something to make up for the bad experience and I will get it out yet today.""  Here we are a full week later and no e-mail. Does BJ's really care about their patrons? Me thinks not."
Bri H.,"Palmdale, CA",43,172,182,4.0,2/19/2016,"This is one of my favorite date night spots. Tasty drinks. My drink of choice is called ""A drink like that."" It's a blend of vodka, rum, some other crap and Sierra Mist. Try it, it'll take the edge off ;) their Hefeweizen beers are bomb and I don't even like beer.  My favorite dish is their Atlantic salmon, blackened. It's the best salmon I've ever had, besides that time in Alaska at a salmon bake I went to. It comes with veggies and rice pilaf. So delicious!! Their pizza is good too. My fav is the artichoke pizza. It's no longer on the menu but you can ask for it. Every time I've been here the waitresses have been friendly and accommodating. I like that the food actually takes time to make so I can enjoy my drink too :)"
Jessica G.,"Burbank, CA",8,54,24,3.0,10/2/2016,"We've been here twice and the wait staff is always great. My food has always been great too! I love that they have such an extensive allergy menu! That's really important to us.  The problem we've had is that the food has been slow to come out both times we've been there and when we went back last week, it was clear that at least some of our food had been ""re-fired"" as my husband said. It was warm, but it was all dried out from reheating it. I'd never send anything back or make a fuss to a waitress, but I do think they need to address this in this kitchen. Our waitress was great. The broccoli cheddar soup that I got on the side wad especially good! My daughter had a hamburger kids' meal and ate it so quickly that I'm pretty sure she wanted to ask for another one. We HAD waited a long time for a food by that point though. She was really hungry. Good food. Good wait staff. Slow kitchen?"
Tim S.,"Lancaster, CA",24,24,1,2.0,5/21/2017,"Slow service. Food hit and miss, seemed like dinner and desert sat. Overheard other customers experiencing the same. Been before and was ok, this time was a miss. Like so many other places in AV you pay full price and get second rate service or food. Hard to find anyplace with both here."
Beth H.,"San Simeon, CA",0,42,63,2.0,5/20/2017,"BJ's has way too many menu items to make everything good. This food is mediocre at best. The pizza is consistently good but nothing to rave about. Its always really greasy and always gives stomach aches to my children. The food is not consistent, the servers seem overwhelmed at all times."
Cindy R.,"Palmdale, CA",6,18,1,3.0,4/16/2017,We hadn't been to this BJs in a couple years. Went back last month for lunch and it was great. Went back last night and it was okay. We were feeling adventurous and decided to try different beer than our usual. When we ordered our first round the server made what appeared to be disapproving looks and sighs. Like they were bad choices. The beer was fine but it was the only round we ordered. I ordered the Late Night Burger. The server warned me the egg would  be cooked over easy with a runny yolk. I told her that's exactly how it should be. When it came to me the egg was small and cooked over medium with little yolk. My husband had Parmesan chicken which was fine. The food had been dropped off by another server who basically put the lukewarm food on the table quickly and ran off. No ketchup for the fries and our server didn't return to the table for another 20 minutes. In fact we probably only saw her 3 times. That was enough to know she had an odd sense of humor.  We'll probably go back but not to soon.
Katie R.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,55,38,5.0,3/18/2017,"Great atmosphere, great food, fast and friendly service.   Cauliflower tacos and half rack pork ribs are delicious!"
Martin H.,"Rosamond, CA",3,80,39,5.0,5/3/2017,"The restaurant was clean and the staff were nice. The Avocado Egg-rolls were awesome, I had the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad (less the jicama) and it was great. My wife had the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken Pizza and she said it was great. The Chocolate Chunk Pizookie ($3 on Tuesday) was wonderful. Don't forget to try their home brewed root beer, its great."
Patrick A.,"Anaheim, CA",7,284,58,2.0,1/25/2016,"Had the misfortune of being back in the area again this weekend so we stopped in for lunch between soccer games down the road. It wasn't crowded but service was awful.  The kids waited 40 minutes to get their burgers and salads that were ordered first.  Our food came out before the kid's food, even though we ordered 20 minutes later - and they didn't seem to think that was odd.  The food was mediocre; the Sculpin was good and well-priced."
Dee F.,"Palmdale, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/22/2017,Seared Ahi Tuna Salad was fantastic! Ordered double tuna - wished they added more!
Reyna S.,"Acton, CA",0,28,3,1.0,6/16/2017,"It is very unfortunate things have been going south for BJ's. My last three dining experiences have been each worse than the last. I keep trying because I used to like the food (pizzas etc.). My second to last experience the waitress pocketed cash intended for the bill and over charged my credit card. Then pretended to be confused. I did not report her to the manager because I was in a hurry to get to my next engagement. The last experience was 6-10-17. The food was less than good. The waitress brought my grandmothers salmon to her and after a few minutes the waitress returned and said it was the wrong one and took it away. It appeared that she gave to to a nearby table. My grandmother had already touched it. I usually enjoy fish tacos and I could not finish mine as they were doused in too much sauce. The pepper jar was not screwed on correctly and the entire jar of pepper fell into my sisters chicken and rice meal. She couldn't finish her meal either. My mother ordered a cheese appetizer (mozzarella cheese sticks) and was brought pot-stickers instead. At this point I asked for the check because I wanted to leave. 15 minutes later we had not received the check. We asked for refills and never received refills. The waitress returned with one refill for the wrong type of soft drink. My mother couldn't drink it. Mid way through the meal I wanted a high chair and an extra plate both of which I had to retrieve myself because I was tired of waiting. The waitress did take the ruined chicken and rice meal off the bill. I quickly signed the receipt/bill because my 9 month old was getting fussy from all the waiting and went outside. We were waiting in the hot car for my mother to join us but instead I received a call from my mother saying the waitress was holding her hostage inside the restaurant because she did not see the signed bill.  I had my baby hysterical in the car at this point and I couldn't leave the restaurant without my mother. I had the baby so my disabled grandmother walked the copy of the receipt I kept in my purse back into the restaurant. Again, I was late to my next engagement because this experience took too long. I should've reported this to the manager.  Update: The manager contacted me to attempt to correct this situation. I want to believe that the establishment was understaffed and therefore we had this experience."
Wei L.,"Palmdale, CA",6,107,3,4.0,3/14/2017,"This may be weird but my favorite dish here is the jambalaya. If you love spicy food, you'll love their jambalaya. Pair it with a pint of Jeremiah Red and you've got a winning combo. This place gets very crowded on Fri and Sat nights so arrive early. They don't take reservations which is a bummer."
