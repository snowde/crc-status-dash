Anasa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,30,27,5.0,3/14/2017,"I brought my two daughters for my ore-Birthday dinner.  The girls had chicken tenders and fries(average).  I had Peruvian Quinoa with Salmon(excellent).  Besides the food, the service was excellent!  Clifford V. was attentive, accurate, friendly and fast.  He refilled my water without asking, gave us BBQ sauce for our leftovers without asking.  He thought of what we needed before we asked.  He even comped my coffee! We  truly appreciated it! Thank you!"
Tracy F.,"New Orleans, LA",18,66,9,2.0,3/29/2017,"I am very disappointed that my review is not a better one.  I've been here in the past and it's always been ""ok.""  I was looking forward to the pizooki so this is the place I chose for my family for my birthday.  I regret that I did so. What was RIGHT:  Isaac.  He is a star server - personable, engaging, attentive and thorough.  Unfortunately, after taking our drink and appetizer order, management sent him on a break and gave us to another server.  Because I don't know why the next events happened and if he had a hand in the break-down in customer service, I won't name the follow-up server. What was WRONG: ** The App -- there is NO cell signal in the restaurant (for AT&T) and even the guest Wi-Fi wouldn't allow me even enough of a signal to log into the app. ** Appetizers -- We ordered three appetizers: artichoke dip, calamari, and a kid's appetizer (thank you for telling us about this Isaac) which consisted of a garlic knot and some fruit.  The calamari made it out first with the artichoke dip following a few minutes later.  The bread and fruit took about 15 minutes MORE than the other two. ** Drinks -- I ordered one adult beverage at the start of the meal.  At no time was I ever asked if I wanted a refill, a different beverage or a glass of water.  I finally asked for water toward the end of the meal.  Other drinks were refilled about half as often as they should have.  Each time a drink was refilled, there was next to no ice.  We asked for a glass of ice and it took 3 requests and 20 minutes of waiting before we were able to get it. ** Entrees -- within the group, we ordered a pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, kids spaghetti, a pasta dish with soup and a taco plate.  10 minutes after ordering, our server (not Isaac) returned to say that they were out of spaghetti and meatballs and asked one of my guests to choose something else.  It took another 10 minutes for the server to return to take the new order.  I tried to ask if they'd be able to fulfill the rest of the order (pizza was supposed to have meatballs on it and kids spaghetti was...well, spaghetti) but he left while I was talking.  Perhaps he was pre-occupied and didn't realize I was making an inquiry.  We waited somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour for our entrees.  Other tables were seated, ate and were preparing to leave before we got our food.  Our original server, Isaac, left for his break and came back before our food was delivered.  When it was, the pizza had no meatballs and the soup was never delivered. ** Take-away boxes -- it's hard to believe that this could get messed up, but it, I kid you not, even that wasn't done with any thought for the guest.  I had 2/3 of the pizza left.  Our server did not bring out a pizza box, instead brought a couple of small styrofoam containers.   At that point, having seen Isaac on the floor, I finally asked if we could have him back for the last few minutes of our service.  I'm sure this didn't make the server that was handling our table very happy, but the night was a disaster.  I was trying to at least redeem dessert. ** Dessert -- we ordered the pizooki trio.  While the flavor was very good, they were severely overcooked around the edges.  This was our ""on the house"" comp for the troubles we'd reported to the manager.  It was severely lacking and very disappointing. ** Check -- We were there on a Monday which is supposed to be half-price pizza day.  Our pizza was originally rung up at full price.  The soup that I'd requested be removed from the bill since we never received it, was still there.  There were evidently other issues as well to which I'm not privy since someone else was treating me to dinner for my birthday.  All I know is that the check had to be sent back at least once for discrepancies.  I do NOT attribute these to Isaac because the issues had to do with what was put in by the other server.  Isaac was very quick to resolve the issues once pointed out. I said at the start of this that I was disappointed to write this review and that is true.  The food here is generally good and it's got a good variety for groups.  That said, considering our latest experience, it won't be at the forefront of my mind next time."
Jose S.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/17/2017,BJ's I have to say is an incredible eating experience and I just love their homebrewed beer.... Service is always really good... racing is fair and especially for what you get I believe it's a really good deal...
Sam S.,"North Salt Lake, UT",18,74,6,3.0,2/17/2017,"Since we were staying at a nearby hotel, we went here two nights in a row. The food was good, try the deep dish pizza! However, in both occasions the service was subpar. Both of our servers were slow to attend to us, but quick to upsell and bring our check."
Shirley H.,"Moorpark, CA",95,584,600,4.0,2/20/2015,"After finding out that there wasn't a Cheesecake Factory nearby, my hubs and I decided to go to BJ's for a late valentines day lunch. It was pretty busy, but we only waited a few minutes before being seated. I forget our waitresses name, but she was very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken, which was thinly cut chicken with a nice even layer of parmesan cheese that had a nice golden color that was topped with sun dried tomatoes and came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The whole dish was pretty big and would be plenty for two people to split. Since it only takes me a few bites to get full, I took the other piece of chicken with the potatoes home. This dish is definitely better when it comes straight from the kitchen. I ate the dish the following day and of course it wasn't as good.  My hubs ordered the jalapeño burger, which was a pretty big sized burger that also came with a side of seasoned potato wedges. The burger was pretty delicious and cooked medium well. For two entrees and a pop, our total came out to around $32. Not bad for a delicious meal. We were way too stuffed to get dessert, but definitely looking forward to coming back! The noise level can definitely get loud when their busy, but not loud enough where you're having to scream to your dinner-mate. The restaurant also has quite a few big flat screen TVs hanging all throughout the place, so all the sports fans (aka my hubs) will love this place. This restaurant is located next to the movie theater and a sushi restaurant."
Jessica T.,"Lancaster, CA",31,70,15,2.0,1/7/2017,This place just cant seem to get things together. Messed up my Sister in laws birthday dinner by messing up just about everybodys order at the table. 3 steaks ordered 3 different ways and all of them were super wrong. Either underdone or burned. Everything was super cold. Service was awful and we were assigned more than one waiter. This isnt the first time we had awful service. We only came back this time because we had giftcards to use. Also added we have ordered to go and my Husband got a burger and the bun was a normal burger bun and the burger patty was half gone. I also see another yelper had the same experience. Why do you guy cheat your customers like that? Message to the Owner please take all these reviews seriously. You have an obvious problem here that seems to be ignored.
Rosalinda G.,"Palmdale, CA",0,14,,5.0,5/4/2017,"Great drinks, bartender service and food.  The jalapeño cucumber margarita is awesome and you have to try all appetizers!"
Lenny L.,"Lancaster, CA",36,27,9,2.0,1/5/2017,"We arrived at 6:55 and checked in. The app sent me a text saying our table would be ready in 5.  40 minutes later we were called for our table.  Our server was Alexis. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted. She was very nice but very slow. You could tell she was new. We ordered our drinks and appetizers. It took about 10 minutes for the drinks and 20 for the apps. We had no appetizer plates and had to ask for them.  Alexis came to see if we were ok and we ordered. We are 40 min. into the experience at this point.  The food came and my son ordered a full rack of ribs and received a half rack. I told the food runner and she said she would fix it. 3 out of 5 of our party sat with our food for about 10 min. before the other 2 got their food.  I ordered 2 meals to go and before the appetizers even hit the table a food runner brought a to go cup of soup and nothing else, no bag no nothing.  The other half of my son's ribs came after the meals were finished.  I though at one point a manager would come to the table but he was nowhere to be seen.  The restrooms were littered with paper towels. One of the stalls was blocked with a caution cone. The sinks were wet and 2 out of the 3 soap dispensers were empty.  The interim between the restrooms and the dining room had paper towels and trash on the ground.  I'm a wheelchair user and going to the bar the accessible area was cluttered with dirty plates and ketchup bottles. I didn't order the drink I wanted.  There were employees standing around talking loudly around our table (by some computers) and one in particular was extremely rude and obnoxious. His name was Jacob. I know this because one of the guys yelled it from a cross the dining area. I was very disappointed with this experience. I know what the standards should be and this location has missed the mark completely."
Julie D.,"Fullerton, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/4/2017,"Where do I start? Well if I could give zero stars I would most definitely give do that. My husband and I used to love coming to this place, and the rating is not about the food my rating is more so about the service we received, which has led us to never go to this particular location again. We arrived when it was kind of a rush hour so we had to wait about 30mins to be seated which I was perfectly fine with. Once we were seated we literally sat for about 25mins without anyone coming to our table to take our drink order or anything ? Or atleast let us know that they would be with us shortly. And to my surprise another party was seated in the table next to us after we had waited that long and they had a waiter on the spot right away !! They took out their drinks and their order while we still had no waiter come to our service. So finally my friend went over to the front to let them know what was going on and the employee said he would get that checked out right away! Which he didn't we still sat for another 10 minutes or so, at this point I was over it and asked to speak to the manager. The manager I will say was mediocre!!! She took no responsibility and offered no apology all she said was ""I'll see what's going on"" finally a waiter arrived about 20 minutes later to take our order and said hello how are you and my friend responded with I'm hungry and she had the nerve to look annoyed and respond with well hello hungry !! I was so done ! I said how are we going to receive bad service and on top of that have the waiter be sarcastic? Nope not cool!! The manager never came back to see if we were okay or anything ! I just want to say I was not looking to get a free meal or any discount but it would have been nice if the manager would have taken responsibility as a manager and apologized. It's not a restaurant where a meal is $5 so I expect to have decent customer service and even if it was just a $5 meal I'm still paying my hard earned money so i should be able to get good customer service. Manager definitely needs to be more responsible in making sure customers are satisfied! Not to say I have two babies and we usually like to order quickly so that they don't get fussy !! So we can all imagine how annoyed my toddler and baby was after waiting sooo long !!!!"
A P.,"Portland, OR",3,103,105,2.0,1/21/2017,"We always end up here because they have a good variety of dishes; however, no matter what I try I'm never really impressed. I'm always disappointed in my meal.  I would say 99% of the time they do not greet me when I walk in! Even when there is a manager up front! They talk to each other and ignore us until they're ready to seat! You need to at least acknowledge people and say hello we will be right with you! This past time I went, they even ignored me and sat someone before me! So rude! The root beer is the only consistently good thing worth ordering."
Ed W.,"Lancaster, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/16/2017,"Always great food, lots of choices on the menu, staff are terrific. Only negative is that the the noise level is high."
Alyssa G.,"Cedar Park, TX",16,41,62,1.0,5/8/2016,"First off BJ's is one of my go to spots always.  But this location in particular is definitely not even on the list.  Came in Today on Mother's Day.  Waitress was slow, and rude acted like she despised her job. Not friendly at all took 17 minutes to bring out waters and then didn't bring out my nephews juice with the water had to wait again.  My mom ordered the steak medium well it came out over well with char on it. Sent it back and the waitress comes back to tell us it will be a 45 min wait to cook her steak correctly they are busy. Excuse me we will all be done eating by then. She says nothing I can do you'll have to wait. I told her to forget about it we don't want it.  Then we ask for to go boxes and the check she walks past us atleast 4 times before acknowledging us and then I had to ask again for the check and to go boxes.  She finally brings it and tells me oh by the way I went ahead and to the steak off so you don't have to pay for it. Well no shit I'm not paying for a meal we sent back without even a bite of. Smh.  Poor service not a good experience especially when celebrating your mother.  I recommend BJ'S but definitely not this location.  No compensation, no sorry about the meal , not even would you like to order something else."
Brianna L.,"Palmdale, CA",16,20,2,4.0,1/18/2017,"Bjs food was good our orders came out in good timing and nothing wrong. We normally always have bad service maybe the timing we come at but we went there for a late dinner and Jacob was our server, and we can't even say how great of a job he did. He was so attentive and understood our orders and made our 5 year old feel comfortable too! We didn't even have to ask for anything he just knew and had everything he was not over bearing but he checked on us enough to make sure we were satisfied and he had such a great personality ! Very happy thank you Jacob for the wonderful service !5 stars for you!"
April M.,"Lancaster, CA",1,19,,3.0,2/22/2017,Love the food especially the parmesan crusted chicken but I dont like that they raised their prices. The food was already expensive to begin with. Going to find a new favorite place.
James E.,"Lancaster, CA",18,74,,2.0,2/8/2017,"Mediocre at best. Beautiful space, if you like a hipster bar / restaurant. I guess if you drink enough over priced beer, maybe you can swallow the burnt food. On my last visit I ordered grilled Brussels sprouts. They showed up burnt beyond recognition, a burnt dog turd would have been more impressive. It makes me sad, I have been to BJ's a few times and never had anything good to say, about the food or service. Go to the Asian place next door, great Pho, great service. I would only order beer at this place, if I ever return. The food and service seems to always be overpriced and mediocre, at BJ's. Try the Asian place next to it, much better, service and food. Shoot the movie theater food is better, and better service."
Mike U.,"Santa Clarita, CA",4,6,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Ordered a couple mini pizzas for happy hour and it took about 45 minutes to get them. When they finally did come they were cold and no sauce on them...I'm not saying a little sauce.....they had NO sauce on them. Didn't say anything just had a couple bites then left them alone. Asked for ranch to maybe make them taste a Lil better and that took about 20 minutes to get. After that I tried flagging down our server multiple times just to get the check or at least some more tea or water (she never offered to get us a refill) finally asked to split the bill so we could leave and the server just looked at us in a disapointing ""for real?"" Kind of way. I didn't complain or say anything while I was there  because I didn't have time to wait. I'm an advanced heart failure patient awaiting a heart tranplant and have battery powered pumps that keep me alive. My batteries were running low and needed to get out of there quick. I got the check left a generous tip (as I always do) and left. The more I thought about it the more mad I got. Like ""hey that was kind of total bullshit!!!""  I hate complaining especially when its busy, and I don't do poor tipping,  Because I know how hard servers work and I truly appreciate that, but I had a pretty shitty experience for real. NOT COOL GUYS!"
The T.,"Palmdale, CA",0,15,,3.0,5/10/2016,"I just ate here over the weekend, after avoiding the place for the last year.  The food was actually good, the service was good and of course the beer was good.  Sat in the bar area, had a great time. But there are things to avoid, their Happy Hour food deals are still BS.  You now get 1/2 portions of apps for prices that are more than 1/2 of the original cost.  Who thought of this scam?  It's a better deal to buy the full portion and pay full price than buy anything on their happy hour menu.  But by all means, buy the beer and drinks though, it's worth the Happy Hour prices.  Just avoid the food!"
Priscilla S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",24,15,6,3.0,1/29/2017,"Customer service is good.Only thing is the food just isn't always the greatest, sometimes it's a hit other times it's a miss. Drinks never disappoint though, and neither do the pazookies!"
Thomas W.,"Lancaster, CA",129,19,19,5.0,6/19/2016,"We were very pleased by there ethics and great costumer service!! We had a wonderful dinner tonight June 19, 2016! We had a very large party and we had wonderful costumer service treatment by Dominic and Robert with the help of others.   We give the two thumbs up for a job well done in light of all the people and  food requests from our table!! AWESOME JOB!!! Especial in was an all stare NBA Playoffs: Cavaliers vs. Warriors Game night and Fathers day as well... needless to say a Packed house.... ~Thanks and kudos to Dominic and Robert!!  P.S. I hope they see this.. I wrote to BJ's as well, on there BJ's Restaurant and Brew-house site as well.."
Sabrina G.,"Rosamond, CA",0,1,1,5.0,7/23/2016,Dominic  is the best server made use feel so comfortable food was great and he made sure  to make us laugh loved the pink Cadillac
