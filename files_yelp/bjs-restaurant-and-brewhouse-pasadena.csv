Ryan S.,"Pasadena, CA",146,423,7,3.0,1/3/2018,"It has been a little bit more than a year since my last review of this BJ's location.   We have cut back a little bit in the past year in our visits to BJ's, maybe about 4 or 5 times; however, my rating remains a solid 3.   Not to be plain; however, I'm piggybacking pretty much verbatim from my last review.  The food remains good.  They have great daily specials and a great happy hour.  We love sitting in the bar area and watching some sports on the large televisions.   Our favorite server at this location, is a guy who seems to have been here for at least 5 or 6 years (maybe more).  I love the looks of this building. However, the hosts/hostesses are still pretty much always miserable.  The person that mans your front desk is the first face people see in this restaurant.  Why not get people who care and don't mope around like it is the end of the world?   Just fix that one little thing.  I guarantee a five star review, if nothing else changes."
Heather N.,"Long Beach, CA",343,186,472,5.0,12/29/2017,"I dined at this location this past Tuesday evening for dinner. It was not that busy. We were acknowledged and seated right away. The server was friendly and checked on us often--Excellent service by all the employees. The manager was visible, introduced himself, and checked on customers.  The restaurant is in a neat location. The building is old (looks like it was built in the 1930's) and it's beautiful--especially the ceiling. The restaurant was also very clean, including the restrooms. Ample parking is available either in the Paseo Colorado parking structures or on the street. The menu at BJ's can be overwhelming because there is a huge variety of food. However, I have dined at several of the chain's locations and everything I tried so far, was delicious. They also give you a lot of food, so come hungry or plan on either sharing or bringing some food home. In addition, BJ's is a great place to come for happy hour or to watch a game. They have a full bar. Desserts are also quite delicious--especially the pizookie!!!"
Paige G.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,10,33,1.0,12/18/2017,"Please don't expect your reservations to mean anything. Booked a ""reservation"" for 5 @ 7PM. Once we arrived we were told that we will be seated in an hour. After we questioned the woman in the front about what's the purpose of making a reservation if we still have to wait? She stated that we are only waiting an hour compared to others who are waiting an hour and a half.  Then when asked about the other (scattered) empty booths she stated that it was for a party of 100.  We laughed and took our money elsewhere.  Please don't make any reservations and don't expect any rational thinking about what a reservation means.  Poor poor service. Better off at Yardhouse."
Jason Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",449,179,648,4.0,10/26/2017,"Would I come back? Lately I have been having a craving for pizookis and luckily they are having a special where all their pizookis are $3 until the end of October 2017. I think after that date they still offer this promotion on Tuesdays.  All the different pizookis on their menu are fair game for this promotion so eat to your hearts content. Some of the flavors you are able to do half and half. I believe the only flavors you have to do whole are the marshmallow peanut butter s'mores and monkey bread.  On two visits I have tried almost all their flavors. I usually come with a group of 4 people and 3 pizookis are more than enough for us to share. My favorites would be the double dark chocolate, peanut butter, chocolate chunk and monkey bread. Each comes with 2 scoops of ice cream on top of the molten cookie.  Be warned that they are a little sweet but it is worth the diabetes (in moderation). I am sad that this promotion is coming to an end at the end of the month but luckily they still offer it on Tuesdays."
Rodolfo F.,"Riverside, CA",1,5,,4.0,1/10/2018,"Pasta and pizza were fantastic. But the portions were just right, we were able to finish everything without feeling overly full."
Kelly K.,"Pasadena, CA",264,430,128,4.0,11/13/2017,"I'm generally a BJ's hater but this location earned some accolades from me.  Ordered delivery via Amazon's new food service. BJ's made the food on time but Amazon's driver never showed. The takeout rep called me and informed me of Amazon's fail. I ordered the artichoke hearts appetizer and the crispy chicken salad and didn't want food that was sitting in a hot box so I asked if they would re-make the artichokes before I came to pick up, they agreed and they re-made the salad for me too. They also refunded me in full for the hassle of having to pick up myself. The manager and host were very apologetic when I picked up, much more helpful than most BJ's staff I've encountered!  Both my appetizer and salad were delicious. The artichoke hearts had a mild but tasty breading and the dipping sauce was a nice complement. As for the salad, I would have hoped for a bit more fried chicken than I got, but it was well cooked and not too heavily breaded with good lean pieces of chicken within. All the ingredients tasted crisp and fresh, and the honey mustard dressing was the way to go for sure. Parking will be at the Paseo mall. Inside there are lots of TVs for all your sports viewing with a slick, modern and comfortable layout. I'll be returning thanks to the service I received."
Koi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,518,1171,5.0,6/13/2017,Service here is always good Place was clean Servers were super attentive and friendly  Very helpful as well Deep dish is a must!!!  BBQ chicken and buffalo chicken pizza  Yummy!!!!  Baked ziti- was ok! Kinda bland but it was still good just put that tapatio to use!
Diana J.,"Pasadena, CA",93,107,13,4.0,10/5/2017,"Food is better than yard house and service is usually pretty good.  Not noisy like yard house either.   I love their southern friend chicken,  monkey bread pazooki is my favorite and they have the best potato skins.  Pizza needs a little more sauce,  pretty dry.  We just tried the hickory brisket burger and it was great.   Between their wide variety of food,  their service and their mobile app with discounts this place is great."
Kim T.,"San Gabriel, CA",351,874,5765,4.0,5/19/2017,"Decided to pop in here for lunch with some friends, yummy food and great time catching up with some buddies. Parking:  Located on the corner of Marengo Ave., and Colorado Blvd. They on the corner area towards Marengo, if you're coming out of the Pasadena Paseo mall. They don't validate inside the restaurant, but the mall does have a tiny validation station (right next to the two vending machines) right as you're coming up the escalators in their underground parking lot.  First 90mins are free, and any time over, you pay the remainder balance.  Ambience and décor wise, it's clean and spacious. Tons of TVs to watch all your favorite sports. Their bar area is gigantic and beautiful - two huge walls of liquor for all hearts' content. Since it was a weekday, it was slow and quiet, which I didn't mind since it was great for catching up. I ended up ordering the Lunch Portion:  Sandwich & Soup Entrée: California Chicken Club Sandwich+ Vegan Lentil with Ancient Grains Soup. Tyler, our server, brought out my Vegan Lentil with Ancient Grains soup first. I wanted something healthy, and decided to try this out, and I was sure glad that I did! For a vegan dish, it was really hearty! Generous portions of green lentils, ancient grains, tender carrots and onions cooked in a yummy tomato broth. Highly recommended, and I would totally get this again. Doesn't even feel like you're even really eating your veggies and grains ;) Afterwards, came my California Chicken Club Sandwich served with a side of French fries. Since this was the lunch portion, it came with half a sandwich, but it was hearty too! Fresh and layered with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes, served on sourdough bread with roasted garlic aioli spread. The fries itself were crispy, generous and seasoned properly without being super greasy. I've definitely enjoyed my sandwich, and would get it again. Drink:  I opted for an unsweetened citrusy green tea drink. I had two glasses, and it was cool and refreshing to enjoy with my meal. Service: Tyler, our server was nice, but somewhat forgetful. With my meal and drinks, he was on point, but with my friends' meals, he was somewhat forgetful. Either he didn't get their meals brought out the same time as the rest of our table, or he forgot utensils for some of them. However, the one big no-no he did - one of my friends requested sweet potato fries with her Caesar salad, and instead got regular French fries. Tyler ended up taking away her French fries, which he shouldn't have. Instead, he should have left them there, and brought her out a new plate of sweet potato fries. Standard restaurant procedures.  Overall, despite the service, we still had a good time catching up with each other once we had drinks and food in our tummies. I would still come back here at some point."
Nikki J.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,149,118,3.0,12/9/2017,"Very empty today for lunch on always busy Colorado Blvd. We were seated immediately and placed our orders for drinks.  We shared a table with a group of picky twenty-somethings unsure of what they wanted, but very precise on what they didn't want - like parsley and ice. I don't know, it was weird, but our waiter took it all in stride and was very accommodating.  I usually get the shrimp and quinoa bowl, but today I had the tomato bisque soup and half chicken club sandwich. Both were satisfactory. I'll definitely return in the future. This location used to be a bank and has beautiful architecture and character."
Heidi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",395,10,2,4.0,12/11/2017,"I went to this chain in Pasadena on a Monday evening. It wasn't too packed because it was a weekday. Therefore, the service was great. We didn't ask for re-fills but our server for was very attentive and great.  On Monday's it's 50% off pizza's which is also another plus. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken pizza. You can also get half and half of your choice. We did half buffalo chicken and half spicy Hawaiian pizza. Both were really great.  When at BJ's you must have pazookie!! We were extremely full but there was an option for a trio smaller size pakoozie (of your choice).  One down side was the parking. I know parking in Pasadena is extremely difficult. However, after reading the reviews I thought that the garage parking was validated by BJ's. However, it is NOT. There is a self validating station, but it was not near and hard to locate."
Michelle N.,"Alhambra, CA",109,288,698,5.0,5/27/2017,Came for my little sisters graduation lunch !  Service was good - food took a while . But I guess that's normal for a party of 25 lol I had the side of chicken breast with asparagus which was good  Along with the cauliflower which I thought had good flavor . Taste like curry  Avocado egg rolls were delightful as always
Lex T.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,4,9,4.0,12/15/2017,"Excellent service at the bar! Calamari was ok, just a bit too over seasoned. Not over crowded.  Will be back to watch football games at the bar."
Lance H.,"Los Angeles, CA",175,124,129,4.0,9/14/2017,"I always have a good time at any BJ's location. This time, I ordered the bison burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Nothing outstanding about it, but it was good and packed with protein. I don't usually drink, but this burger would go well with an ice cold beer."
Son G.,"Saitama, Japan",236,27,8,4.0,10/14/2017,Great steakhouse. The steak was very tender and all their pizzas and desserts were good. Price was reasonable and their lighting was alright. But Come here when you are not as broke.
Mandi T.,"Rosemead, CA",1090,950,1782,4.0,8/9/2017,"We visited this in 2014, but here goes.... We were looking for some Happy Hour and saw that BJ's had a deal... $4 for all bj craft beers $1 off for rest of the beer $4, $5, $6 appetizer to choose from. Happy hour only in the bar area. Oz was our bartender/server. He's pretty awesome and hope he's still here. Will return! Parking is in a huge lot under the paseo mall."
Adriana K.,"Alhambra, CA",235,409,1963,5.0,5/23/2017,"Not your typical BJ's. In a former historic bank building, it's a fancy cool place for some good food at reasonable prices. I ate at a $$$ establishment earlier in the day and honestly, I liked my meal here better... and had the same server! I had the salmon dinner with mashed potatoes and broccoli, and at the suggestion of the server, one of their sweet pink ciders.  Loved the ambiance, loved my meal, and the server was super friendly and I would come back to sit in his area again."
Ashley V.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/6/2018,The Glendale BJ's is better. If you eat at the Pasadena location watch out for Kevin!
Tiffany H.,"Tustin, CA",485,141,100,4.0,5/7/2017,"Came on a Saturday night for dinner and our group of 6 was seated in a booth in the back. It was a bit tight but we made it work. Our server was really funny and sweet (sorry didn't get his name :[) and definitely kept us entertained! We ordered two pitchers of beer, three small pizzas, wings, a quinoa bowl and a cheeseburger. The awesome part was when we were given medium pizzas because they ran out of small pans!!! Our server gave the birthday girl a free pizookie and made a huge effort to light her candle (since there was a big draft where we were sitting) so I applaud him for his efforts!  We were terrified of coming here after reading the reviews but it was overall a decent experience! It took a while for our food to come out but the upsize in our pizzas made it all worth it :-)"
Amelie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/15/2017,Good place to hang out and chill with food and beer. Pasta and pizza were tasty. Portions were just right - we were able to finish everything without feeling overly full and had room for dessert.
Cori H.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",78,1,,1.0,12/13/2017,This food really blows. No pun intended...I usually love bjs but this location really killed the name for me. I ordered the sliders on happy hour and they were burnt to a crisp... no onions on it and I was later told they were in the patty?? Well I couldn't taste them and I just asked them to return it. I also order the calamari which was soggy and looked to be cooked in dark motor oil. The only thing me and my boyfriend ate where the buffalo wings.  just a bad experience .
Fernando G.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,2,1,1.0,9/2/2017,Never have I experienced extreme RACISM at the bar than any other form in my life. Bartenders wouldn't shut this foo up. Thanks BJ's for letting this Fuck rant in Public!! Thank you And FUCK YOU for allowing this! Cheers!! I explained to the manager!! Good luck!
Aleah W.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,60,16,2.0,8/19/2017,"SLOW. Service was so slow. It was not at all crowded. I sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly but took forever to take my order and to bring my change. It took over 20 minutes to get my cauliflower tacos.  The tacos were good but the side dish, some sort of salad concoction, was clearly previously frozen because it was still cold. It was so cold it hurt my teeth."
Lianna N.,"Santa Barbara, CA",577,72,488,4.0,1/17/2017,"Reasonable prices, fast and friendly service, great portions, good variety, and overall atmosphere.  I enjoyed the salmon with quinoa and piña colada with strawberry lava. I also got a free pizookie for my birthday."
Michael G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,5.0,9/28/2017,"I have been coming here since the Restaurant's grand opening. And it never disappoints! The food is great, the service is quick, and the waiters are attentive. I'm never a big yelp reviewer but this last experience with our waiter (Ernesto) made the experience so good I couldn't let pass and not take some time to write to acknowledge him. He was charismatic and knew how to make all the food in the menu enticing. When the food arrived he made sure it was to our liking and would come by periodically to check if we needed anything else. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a nice dinner in old town Pasadena. If you do, I recommend Our waiter for the night Ernesto (Raider fan, and looked like it with a buzz cut haha jk Sir) but if he ever reads this, thank you for your hospitality and for making my wife and I enjoy our weekly date night memorable. Thumbs up! One of our favorite places to eat in Pasadena!"
Celene S.,"Pasadena, CA",29,35,53,5.0,7/10/2017,Great service on a Monday night. Mondays they have pizzas half off and margaritas for $5
Jennifer C.,"Pasadena, CA",272,184,231,1.0,12/5/2016,"I came here on a Monday afternoon for lunch with 3 of my coworkers. We got there at 12:15 latest, and I am sure they get a lot of corporate workers trying to get in and out within 1 hour. We were seated right away, and the restaurant was half empty. We took our order within 10 minutes. We got half the food at about 1pm. So we've been at the restaurant for almost an hour and they only brought out two soups. Another twenty minutes and they bring out the rest. The two ladies sitting a table next to use for their food before us... I had the bison burger and the chicken bacon hot pocket or that's what the waiter called it. The bison burger patty was dry and tough. The sauce saved the dryness. The chicken bacon hot pocket was like a fancy hot pocket. It didn't wow me or anything. Just made me wish I brought a hot pocket from home.  The waiter apologized for the wait and gave us free pazookies on the house. Except that took another 20 minutes.  Our waiter was very nice and I understand it wasn't his fault. It was the kitchen's fault for being unorganized.  Our one hour lunch turned into 2..."
Laila S.,"Rosemead, CA",636,157,868,4.0,11/9/2016,"My boyfriend and I went to this BJ's location recently to scope out the large flat screen TV at the bar for watching games in the future, and we found it to be a nice location to eat & watch sports. We sat at the bar to eat, and our bartender (I forgot her name) was really nice and efficient.  She even told us where to get the validation stamp at the Paseo Colorado complex next door for the free 90 minute parking. We ordered the large chicken lettuce wraps plate, the cheddar burger for him, and the spicy peanut chicken soba noodles for me.  I just got an orange juice because my throat was a bit sore, and my boyfriend got a diet coke (for which the bartender did not charge us, I guess to be nice). The food was pretty standard for a sports bar, but the service was great and we definitely saw the advantage of sitting at the bar to watch the big screen TV, although that TV is not as large as we had hoped. We parked in the Paseo Colorado Parking Entrance that is to the immediate east of this BJ's location."
Ricky G.,"Azusa, CA",6,11,1,4.0,10/1/2017,Sarah was Fantastic. Fun and very Attentive. Best server at any BJ's we've been to.  Thanks Sarah
Samantha A.,"Los Angeles, CA",198,154,552,2.0,11/12/2016,"This place has some perks and more downsides. As a vegan, I usually avoid chains at all cost, but they were giving free meals to veterans (and I am one) and I read that their pizzas are vegan (if you take off the cheese). so my fiancé and I turned it into a Friday date night. Beware, the parking is awful. They don't have their own lot, so unless you find street parking, you're doomed to try to find parking in Paseo Colorado. By the time we got to the restaurant, the wait was about 50 minutes. For 7:00pm on a Friday, I guess that's normal... (again I never go to chain restaurants). We waited at the bar, over an hour later we decided to see what was up. They had given away our seats to someone else at the bar and pretended like they ""missed"" us.  Over an hour later, we finally sat down and ordered some drinks, chips and guac to start. I also showed them my military ID so that we'd get $5 drinks and a free meal for me. We waited about 40 minutes for our pizzas to come out! And the chips and guac never came (only after we said ""hey, our entrees are out and we never got our apps""). The pizza was good.  I liked the dough very much and was happy I wasn't forced to get a salad and fries. The guac was good as well. That is the only reason this place is getting 2 stars from me. Because, for a chain, the food was decent.  Onto the bill... after already showing them ny military ID (for Veterans day specials) they didn't take off our discount. So we had to find the waitress to take it off. Then, she didn't take off the drink specials for ($5 beers for veterans day). So we had to find her again. At that point was when she said, our beers didn't count because we didn't order the right ones. I would've liked to have known that I  the beginning of the transaction, but of course, why would they do that when they can make a few extra bucks?!  So I left BJ'S feeling very unsatisfied.  We would've never ate if we didn't say something. We would've never gotten any discount if we didn't say something. Going out to eat shouldn't be work. It should be enjoyable, and my experience at this place was not. My rule still stands... avoid chain restaurants at all cost."
Della M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,8,12,1.0,11/30/2016,We ordered online for curbside for 16 meals for an executive meeting.  Not only was our order incorrect (5 items missing) but we found bacon and onion bits mixed into the fruit cups.  DO NOT BOTHER EATING HERE. I suggest Yard House or the Cheesecake Factory which are conveniently located nearby.  Check your food before you eat it.
Luada Y.,"Pasadena, CA",43,5,12,5.0,7/8/2017,So far so good we order drinks and they came promptly and are delicious witches have taken our order this really happened so fast I love it
Norma R.,"Pasadena, CA",45,241,235,2.0,5/30/2017,Probably one of my least favorite BJ's! Plates are a lot smaller and not great in taste. Drinks aren't the greatest either. I was very excited when this place was going to open in Pasadena but was soon disappointed.
Tonto W.,"Monrovia, CA",0,15,4,1.0,5/17/2017,"Well my bad should have checked the reviews before I made the decision to eat here. Good Grief Charlie Brown, Ugh!!!! Here it goes. I arrived at the place at 5:30 on a Saturday night and got seated right away, I was only a party of 2. The hired help took our drink order and was off to fetch them, Ice Tea and water. You know those tough drinks that people order. So I had notice that some time had passed, still no drinks yet , checked the old sun dial on the cellphone and a good 15 minutes has passed.  I thought what could be the hold up, of course getting the h2o out of the ground is the problem.  Ahh here come our waiter now with a tray of food for another table and our drinks.  Seriously how lazy,  So I was wanting to cut my loses there and leave, but no I let my guest talk me into staying, since I was spending my birthday money there. I order the parmesean chicken and potatoes deal, guest got the roast beef sandwich.  Ok the roast beef looked like it had been cooked 2 days before it was so dry, that it looked like the cow hadn't had water in weeks. The breaded chicken was ok, but had to ask for extra sauce for it, I got double potatoes and the to piles where different colored. Needless to say we managed to get through the food. Then the waiter, Pablo, just brought us the check, had to ask for the desert menu, but we passed on that. Needless to say I dropped $50. $16.50 for the chicken and $14 on the roast beef + Ice Tea. Let me say this. There is a reason that your reviews are so bad, when you are in a prime location and other restaurants in the same area are killing it. Truth be told your rating reflect how bad you are."
Sergio J.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,25,32,1.0,10/13/2017,It's my daughter 19th bday today & I honestly gotta say thanks BJ's pasadena for the horrendous dried up cat food you served us.  First off my Blackend Salmon was dried up like a beef jerky it then took an hour to remake & I watched ever1 else eat.    your hef beer seemed flatter than a pushed in butt but I guess you $3 pizookie was worth listening to your Manager blab about how she's an Angels fan & really didn't give a dam about my Scaly fish dinner.    Next time I'll just make the drive to BJs in Downey.
Ariana A.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,86,40,5.0,11/8/2017,Love this place. They have amazing food. Make sure to download the app for discounts. You can get a free desert.
Cindy M.,"Granada Hills, CA",22,50,18,2.0,10/13/2017,"For the most part I like the food the staff is ok, but the to go service SUCKS. I don't eat in the restaurant since I work in Pasadena and don't live around here, I only order to go with coworkers, all I can say is we are lucky if we get the order and it's correct. There is ALWAYS something wrong. And they are not trained very well to know what comes with what and especially if you ask them about something on the Lunch Special menu. I'm keeping this short and to the point, if I went thru everything this would be a novel. Just be aware,  when you order to go at this location,  check your order before you leave."
Stock G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,36,,5.0,11/4/2017,"Hands down the place is awesome, seriously! They've got healthy entrees  that are delicious! The steak to the pork chops, great pricing, compared to the other nearby steak places, so good! Great service always, great selection of beers too! Food is fab. Forget the high price places, I'm down with good food at great prices. Awesome game T.V's!"
Chuck D.,"Los Angeles, CA",654,1172,8489,3.0,10/23/2016,"Nice setting for a BJ's which was obviously a former bank space. The high & back lit ceiling make for a dramatic setting for a meal and definitely the nicest space I've ever dined at that housed a BJ's. We went there on a Thursday evening. Parked downstairs in Paseo Colorado underground parking. We tried to park on the end just under where the restaurant would be and took the elevators up. But to get to the restaurant from that way, you have to walk through an alley that passes the trash bins of the restaurant so you may wanna hold your breath or go another way as it isnt the most scenic of routes. We only saw one entrance and its along Colorado. We started off with one of their thin crust tavern pizzas ($11.50). We went with the italian market which had meatballs, pepperoni, ham and peperoncinis. It was quite tasty. I prefer the thin crust when I want to sample other things on the menu. The deep dish is so heavy & filling. The toppings all tasted great and normally I dont eat peppers but the peperoncinis really tasted great on this thin crust pizza.  We also got the cheese bread for my nieces and it was just ok. The crispy calamari ($11.50) was good with its fresh taste. The breading was light and gave great texture and the squid itself was tender. The accompanying marinara dipping sauce was good... The fresh atlantic salmon ($18.95) was good. I liked it a lot. The blackened salmon with lemon butter sauce over rice pilaf was really good. I was surprised. The salmon wasnt dry and it tasted great. The vegetables on the side were whatever. For desert we ordered a pizookie trio ($10.75) which were 3 mini pizookies meant to be shared. We went with OG chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia and cookies and cream. Yummm... They were all great. ALL OF THEM. It was my first time trying the cookies and cream. It was like eating a warm oreo cookie. Soo good.  Service could have been better. We stood there a little while waiting to be seated and the place wasnt packed at all. The hostess was away from the front of the restaurant. We were sat in a big u-shaped booth. We had 3 adults and 2 children... We had to wait for utensils to be provided and our food had started making its way to our table already. So that was a bit of an inconvenience. Also, we waited awhile (again) for the waitress to refill our drinks... By then, the lack of customer service was annoying. Anddd... When we wanted to pay the bill, we had to ask another server to find OUR server so she could ready the check. ANDD... when we wanted to pay the bill (in cash), I couldnt find her again and we certainly didnt want to leave cash on the table so I had to search for some staff member, ANY staff member and I found a hostess... Yeah, it was off. The service was lacking. That's too bad because that should be the last thing we have to worry about.  Maybe we'll be back. If we do, hope the service is more available."
Sara A.,"West Covina, CA",11,11,18,5.0,10/22/2017,This bj's is amazing our server Ernie was so helpful and amazing. He always asked how we were doing ! Thank you
