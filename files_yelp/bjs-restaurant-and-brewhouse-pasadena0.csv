Ed M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,214,4.0,1/18/2016,Great variety of food. Great parking lot! Beer selection is awesome.  Added features: Sport TV programs.
Desiree S.,"Altadena, CA",152,50,157,4.0,4/17/2016,"I had the cobb salad and the root beer wings, both were very quite tasty. I definitely recommend both."
Ara J.,"Glendale, CA",0,13,3,1.0,1/14/2017,"Soup without spoon. Even after pointing it out to them, they insisted it was under the plate but it wasn't. Had to use a straw instead. Salad came out with the soup but no utensils for anyone. Food is still not out an hour."
Vanessa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/6/2016,"Herman was a great waiter. I've been a waitress at a nice fine dining restaurant before and he did everything I was trained to do. He timed out our meals perfectly. Brought each of our entrees at the same time. Made casual conversation but did not linger awkwardly and he wasn't try to up the bill. He simply made us feel comfortable . Today is my boyfriend and i's 4 year anniversary . It was a last minute decision to go to BJs. And without even knowing it, Herman made it a great experience for the both of us :). Thanks man ! Keep up the good work ! ;)  - Jamil & Vanessa"
Franklin M.,"Alhambra, CA",182,1617,2903,3.0,6/8/2014,We had a group of 8 in our party and had wait around 15 minutes to be seated on a Sunday afternoon. I shared a 12 inch deep dish BJs special pizza. The pizza was okay it looked better than it tasted. If you plan on ordering pizza I would get the regular crust and pass on the good looking pan pizza.
Annie M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,8,,5.0,7/7/2016,Ernesto was AMAZING. Was a great experience for me and my friends. I have only been to BJs once before but Ernesto's service will definitely have us coming back.
Rossana L.,"Alhambra, CA",21,35,20,1.0,6/21/2016,I used to only come for paint nite events and ordered only drinks. (alabama sunset is pretty good) This is my first time dining here (free pizookie day!). 20 min wait to be seated when half the restaurant is empty. Another 40 min wait to get our food. Seriously? We arrived at 7:15 pm; it's about to be 9 pm and we still didn't get our dessert. Overpriced restaurant with subpar food and horrible service. And no parking validation .. Theres no way my party could finish eating within the remaining 30 mins even if we were to self-validate in paseo ..  Waste of time and money coming here. Never eating here again. More like won't be coming back unless it's for paint nite!
Frank C.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,40,,3.0,12/29/2016,Typical of chain restaurants. The food is uninspiring but that is expected.  What is unexpected is that service is hit or miss. We have had good servers and ones who are absolutely dreadful.
Leo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1054,639,3498,4.0,10/30/2012,"Who doesn't love the going to BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse chain for their deep dish pizza, tasty appetizers, great microbrew beers and famous pizzookie. Finally, an alternative choice to the Yard House hopefully without the long wait. NBA 2012-2013 season starts today so I'm looking forward to coming here to watch the Laker/Clipper games. I attended the grand opening yesterday for lunch. I can't believe there's already a few reviews and check-in about it before the place even opened. I guess after going to a few BJs in SoCal, people think or assume they're all the same. The food and beer maybe, but the decor, ambiance and service is definitely different. The decor is spectacular especially the interior space. This used to be the old Security Pacific Building that was formerly the Premier Jewelery Mall. I love the beautiful high ceilings and ornate design which reminds be more of the Gran Lux cafe. They even kept the original chandeliers and craftsman woodwork. The multi-screen entertainment console at the bar is awesome. Great way to watch multiple games at the same time plus get the latest news report from CNN. In addition, six additional flat screen TVs are available throughout the restaurant. If you want immediate seating for lunch, sit at the bar. Service was pretty awesome today. I think being that it was their grand opening, everyone was at their best behavior. My waiteress Sarah did an exceptional job waiting on me. She was friendly, helpful and polite. My food order came promptly and drink re-filled regularly.  Food is always consistently good at BJ's. With their huge menu selections you're sure to find something you like. Make sure to try their lunch specials starting at $5.95 (14 to choose from). I ordered the southern fried chicken breast served on top mash potatoes and corn succotash with pepper cream gravy. Good portions, savory and tasty. The chicken was tender and lightly crisp on the outside. Good deal! Save room for dessert especially their pizzookie. My favorite is their triple chocolate pizzookie made with Ghirardelli chocolate which is rich and amazing. Definitely will satisfy your chocolate fix and indulgence. Also, try their new raspberry white chocolate almond pizzookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream so decadent and scrumptious.  Parking - Paseo Mall with validation. With so much good food and beer to offer, I'm sure this place will get popular and busy quickly. Can't wait to come back to try all their delicious food."
Nicole B.,"Santa Monica, CA",723,576,391,4.0,5/9/2013,"This BJs is located inside of what used to be a bank. As such, it is gorgeous inside. Very high ceilings in the bar area and lots of glass. Whenever I visit this location I receive great service and the food is what you would expect for any BJs. Yum!"
Melissa B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",197,253,92,4.0,5/21/2016,"My girlfriend and I came for Paint Nite and our server was great for the event. I forgot her name, but she had the bright red hair. She was on top of everything and doing an excellent job with the group. I had an Irish root beer which was terrific! We had a queso dip with chips and enjoyed it. After the event we got a table at the restaurant and shared the brussel sprouts which was pretty overlooked and burned. It was fair. I wouldn't order it again. We split the pazookie trio, monkey bread, cookies and cream, and chocolate chip cookie. All were absolutely delicious! If I'm around I may come back, but we only ate and drank because of Paint Nite."
Sandy K.,"North Bend, WA",2,100,130,5.0,10/17/2015,"Ok, after driving all day and sitting in traffic for 5 hours. We decided to have dinner here with my good friend.   Best choice of the day! The service was way above top notch!  The server we had was super nice and made us feel like we were already friends,  the manager awesome! We took the booth up for about 4 hours and they were absolutely wonderful!   The food , amazing!  I had salmon and watermelon salad  absolutely best flavor and salad fresh crisp and delicious. .

Overall this place is a 10+ , service, atmosphere, food and you will love the restaurant it's self bring a camera!"
Ryan M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",45,87,20,5.0,10/13/2015,"As you all know, BJ's food is consistently good all across it's locations and this location is no exception, so because you know the food is good already, I will only comment on the location and how it is different than all the others. The food itself doesn't warrant a 5 star review in my opinion, but yes, this BJ's restaurant is different than all the others I've ever seen and I am thus giving it a 5 star rating.  The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Not that the other locations are not nice. But this BJ's is especially absolutely gorgeous. The decor very classy. The ceiling has got to be 20 or 25 feet or more above the floor in the main dining room area and the detail/care in making it is very nice. There are TVs everywhere - ok this may be true of all BJ's. The staff here is very nice. I came on a busy weekend recently, USA vs Mexico soccer game + baseball playoffs + college football games on, and they managed to get the Cal game playing for me at the bar. Everywhere else I went to in Old Town (yes, I went to places in Old Town Pasadena that would not play the Cal game) told me to basically shove it because I wanted to watch the Cal game instead of a soccer game on one of their many TV's. So thank you BJ's.   I'm going to do something very rare here that I would not normally do. I rarely give out 5 star reviews. I'm going to give this BJ's 5 stars because it stands out to me as a special restaurant on top of all the other BJ's locations, and I can't find a reason not to."
Isabel P.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2017,"I have been to BJ's many times and have loved my experiences but the last experience I had ruined BJ's for me. I went on a Friday night around 10pm and they weren't very busy, we got sat right away. It took 4-5 minutes for our server to even greet us. Then after we gave our drink orders it took probably 10 minutes to even get them. Mind you we have two servers because one is training. We gave them our food orders and we waited about 40 minutes for our food. They updated us in between letting us know that it was still going to be a bit for our food. When we finally got our food it was barely warm. I had ordered the half rack of the baby back ribs with a side of thin fries and broccoli. My broccoli was freezing cold. My friend asked for no tomatoes on her salad because she is allergic  to them and when she got her food there were some on it. When she told them, they apologized and said they would bring her a new one, which yet again took awhile to get it. When she got her new one, the salad wasn't made correctly. It normally comes with avocado but there was none on it. My boyfriend got the jambalaya and when it come out, it looked like something that would be off the kids menu. And for $19 I would expect more. My napkin was dirty with some white stuff on it. So I had to wait once again for another one, while my food was getting even colder than it already was. Our server was Dustin, I don't think he was the right server to be training someone else. With the slow service and the cold food, I would definitely not recommend going there."
Monica C.,"Pasadena, CA",1074,494,535,3.0,4/22/2014,"They accommodate large groups better than any other restaurant in Pasadena that I've come across thus far. The service is usually pretty good and I do love the beer! The downfall of this place is the quality of the food. It's hit or miss. I order off the diet menu because I've managed to convince myself that if there's a diet menu, then it's there because the regular menu is Fatty-Mc-Fat-Fat and I don't want to be that too. My personal crazy aside, the diet menu is OK- especially if you like salmon, which I don't. They've got lots of other choices too. I got the fish tacos and let's just say I would never submit myself to that punishment again. Just. gross, mostly flavorless and a few chips are not a side. Also because I order off the diet menu, I have convinced myself that this entitles me to an appetizer: the ahi poke, corn fritters, and the avocado egg rolls are all really good.  The Pazookies are pretty fab too. I mean, if you're human and like half cooked cookie dough with ice cream on top. I'm human, so I do. They have little ones for kids which I've, once again, convinced myself I deserve. For the nutrients and stuff."
Eric K.,"Pasadena, CA",174,5,,3.0,7/6/2016,"I went with friends to dinner there. It was a slow and there were like couple of waiters.  We got seated and the waiter just handed us water and said ""He will right back"" He didn't even ask what he can get us to get started. We had to wait for the waiter to come back to take our order.  I ordered the burger,  soup, and an appetizer.  I got the soup as a side for the burger but got that first.  The appetizers and entree took long time. We were about to cancel the order but the appetizers showed up in time. Entree took longer. To make matters worst,  I got the burger and it was suppose to have bacon inside. Instead, they gave me the bacon separately on the plate.  I mean who does that? Bacon haters?  I think they are bacon haters! Like really?! How the fuck can you do that to a bacon burger?!"
Karla L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",88,31,11,5.0,8/5/2016,If you want to eat American food is the best place to be. Great service and food is great. Desserts are the best.
Maximus G.,"South Pasadena, CA",6,80,605,4.0,9/1/2015,"Large menu with a good variety of food to choose from.  They have a great lunch menu that offers smaller portions of some of their top items, and at a good price.  Beer selection is decent.  Some personal favorites are their avocado egg rolls, tomato bisque soup and they have good pizza - both their thick pan pizza which is not overly heavy and their thin pizza crisps are good!  Fun place to go with a group."
Sal G.,"Bradbury, CA",118,32,5,4.0,4/13/2016,"This place is BEAUTIFUL and their food and drinks are always good. We go here once a month for happy hour. The waiters are great and the food is good. Their bar display is amazing! They have parking in the Paseo Colorado lot, which might be a little expensive, but there's plenty of free parking a block away in front of city hall. The only bummer is that they don't validate for parking."
