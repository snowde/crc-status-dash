scott M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/5/2017,"So I want to like this place. Grew up on Orange County and this was a favorite spot. Every time I come in though I'm disappointed. Foods ok, It's just not run very well. I'm sure it does ok given its location and I'm certain being a chain keeps people coming in, but it shouldn't. Couple of highlights... shoes up and host wasn't present. 2 more groups, 1 more group. It's dinner time and host is gone for 5-10 minutes while people are piling up. Meanwhile 3-4 other employees cruise by host station, but can't help. Everybody looking at each other wondering what's happening. Host finally shows up and said she was clearing table. This place probably has 50 people working dinner shift, but she had to bus tables. Another, got drinks but waiter disappears and doesn't come back for order. Again it's just odd because there's so many other employees milling about. There were honestly 3 employees blowing bubbles in next section while all the tables in ours were looking around for service. Eventually returned and he got ""behind"". Co-workers should have helped??? Anyway, writing this is cathartic, and I seriously hope BJs management reads and addresses issues. Lots of choices these days and successful restaurant need food and service to be great..."
Charles G.,"Pasadena, CA",522,257,1103,4.0,12/10/2016,So I'm back I'm here for appetizers and the infamous PIZOOKIE. Appetizers were delicious we ordered the appetizer combo avocado rolls cheese sticks buffalo wings dip and side  of calamari and Brussel sprouts with siracha. The desert a few different pizookies.
Isobel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2274,644,3470,4.0,11/22/2014,"Second time visiting this BJ's tonight with friends to watch the annual classic UCLA-USC game! Overall, a pretty great place to watch the game, and, no, I am not being biased because UCLA won! GO BRUINS!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4/5: Ambiance. Nicer than your average BJ's, with wood paneling and good lighting. Gigantic big-screen TV's abound. We did have to ask the manager to turn up the volume for the big game but that was taken care of with no problems. There seemed to be a high ratio of Bruins to Trojans but maybe that's because the Trojans got quieter and quieter as the game progressed and started sneaking out in their own version of the walk of shame? No hipsters. Yay.  5/5: Alcohol. A nice draft beer for $5.25? Sounds good to me. Seems like they have lots of your standard ""brewhouse"" options.  3/5: Dining. The menu options here offer nothing to write home about. The best thing I had turned out to be the Ghiradelli chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. My friends seemed to enjoy their pizza.  5/5: Service. Our server Marvina did an outstanding job of taking all of our orders, keeping them all straight (there were six of us), and took really good care of us.  4/5: Parking. Parking meters are free after 5 pm a couple of blocks away (near City Hall)."
Kimberly J.,"Altadena, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/8/2017,"So here's the thing...I don't have great experiences at restaurants. Usually the server is too slow or the food isn't cooked to my specifications...something ALWAYS goes wrong. I came to BJ'S Pasadena after work for a late-ish dinner with 2 friends. The hostess? definitely leaves something to be desired. I asked for a specific server & she acted like I was speaking a foreign language. But this review is not about her. This review is about MICHAEL. Michael is the best server I've had here in a LONG time! He is super attentive, but not pesty.  Anything you need, he is on top of it. From explaining to you how the different beers taste to recommending a favorite dish. If you feel conversational, he'll chat with you. If not, he will serve you promptly and efficiently. Any time I feel like going to BJ'S, it will be Pasadena and I will only sit in Michael's section. I suggest you do the same!"
Anna A.,"Compton, CA",0,19,11,1.0,7/18/2016,Ordered avocado roll.. Avocado is dark. Either it was sitting for a long time or they just like to serve old avocado .. Not just on one roll - majority of it. And then I ordered tortilla soup.. Umm not hot... They actually pour the soup inside the bowl.. Is that suppose to be a show??? But it's not hot!? And we told the waiter that we were going to share the avocado roll.. Where's my freakin extra plate? It should be obvious !? Omfg!!! $1 tip!!!! Dick! This place is horrible . Never will I come here again and... I should of Yelp it first before I came. I don't remember being this bad ohh and the tortilla soup is too salty.. Wow.. waste of time and money .
Zolzaya M.,"Pasadena, CA",40,6,2,1.0,1/15/2017,"How come its BJ and be so lousy???!!! I love BJ's in Glendale and decided to give it a try. Pasadena BJ food is worse than Dennys'. And the server almost got my friend's 1 y.o son with the hot water. Partially she did. And she did not even apologize. By the time she come to our table, she said oh the water is hot be careful and she herself dropped the tray. Hot water was spilled on the table and little droplets hurt the baby and baby cried. And she said I told you the water was hot. We were in shock and told server the fact that she was the one with hot water on the tray. She was extremely rude. At least a sorry would have been helpful."
Jaimi G.,"Los Angeles, CA",255,195,336,4.0,2/22/2016,The Parmesan crusted chicken is amazing! I swapped my broccoli for Brussels sprouts instead. The pizookie is bomb too! I would get the mini pizookie's so you can try more than one lol I gave it 4 stars tho because my Brussels sprouts were lackluster
Danielle H.,"Corvallis, OR",83,205,98,3.0,12/18/2015,Meh. Meh. Meh. This is my first time to this location. I ordered a bowl of clam chowder that came out barely warmed as if it was just microwaved for like 45 seconds to be reheated to be served. It was salty.  We also ordered the BJ'S favorite pizza and it was nothing special.  Only reason I'm giving this review a 3rd star was cause our waiter was attentive and was always around when we needed something. Easy going guy and always kept our drinks filled.
Ada F.,"Pasadena, CA",659,313,1421,4.0,10/11/2014,Been here a few times and each time I see they have significantly improved their food and customer service. This place is good to watch games at. They have good finger foods. I like how there is a huge selection of vegetarian dishes. Today I tried their veggie omelet with fruit. I also ordered their spinach stuffed mushrooms. Everything was on par in terms of flavor. For dessert we tried a new flavor for their pizookie. They now have a peanut butter s'mores and a salted caramel. We got the peanut butter s'mores. When the dessert arrived we noticed it was missing the scoop of vanilla ice cream. The server was apologetic and he hooked us up with an extra scoop of ice cream.  We will be back for more goodness.
Jorge H.,"San Marino, CA",11,7,1,4.0,4/19/2017,I like this place even if it has that franchise feel. The beer is their own and the jambalaya is a must.
Serena G.,"La Crescenta, CA",0,5,2,1.0,7/19/2017,I don't understand why people get into the customer service field if you don't seem to even be around people. If you hate your job find another. The food didn't seemed to be cooked correctly and and also it took FOREVER. Worst BJ's ever.. save your money and eat in it will be a better experience.
Andrea O.,"Pasadena, CA",45,5,1,1.0,9/25/2016,"I Normally don't write this type of reviews or even review, I work in the industry and I must say this was the WORST experience I've ever had at a restaurant/bar. We usually go to Bjs cause we love the piezooki among other stuff, But If you read, definitely  don't go to this one, Our server lady was obviously not trained to provide customer service, Got the order all wrong at different times, Came to check on us every 30 min (Sunday lunch EMPTY shift) and also an over charge on our check, If managers or Corp read this, Your bussines in Pasadena will go down sooner than later, It's sad to hire this type of people even tho it's a corporation."
Ashleigh M.,"Charleston, SC",52,16,10,4.0,9/25/2016,"So much fun! Loved the interior decorating- reminded me of the bank in Harry Potter . We had no wait time for dinner on a Saturday evening, and our beers were delicious - double the alcohol content of a Guinness . The food was yummy too, and if I had room for dessert I would've wanted to definitely try some! Very happy with this location (have also visited another spot in L.A.)."
Tammy C.,"San Dimas, CA",309,468,878,2.0,6/22/2016,"I have always had a positive relationship with BJ's, so when we had to chose a place to eat at for father's day, I was happy to go to BJ's. As we entered we were greeted and given a pilsner father's day glass, with some coupons. The place was relatively empty since it was about 10:30.  We ordered our food............and waited forever. Even the table next to us with a larger party, that came after us got their food. Finally it arrives, well everyone in my party gets their food.......I wait. The manager walls by to see if our food is good, she doesn't notice that I have nothing, and keeps going, as I am about to tell her, she just keeps walking. Finally it comes out, looks good, I bite...yuck, the bottom toast was burnt, so I wait to tell the waiter, but I get hungry, so I eat the middle of 1/2 the sandwich. He finally arrives, and since my party is all done, I just ell him to take it. He offers to send the manager, but for what? This BJ's disappointed me. Next time...Yard House for me"
Emerald S.,"Glendale, CA",64,89,142,4.0,7/24/2016,I really enjoy going to BJ's they have excellent customer service skills and always provide me with great food. I like to get the garden medley salad I believe it's not even on the menu but they still make it for me and for my dessert I like to get the Pizookie.
Hadir E.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",1,10,,5.0,3/19/2017,"Yummy food, friendly waiter. The wait was reasonable, its very convenient because it stays open late."
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,4.0,1/18/2016,I met my gfs here for dinner. I parked in the structure but it was a bit expensive.  I would have been better off finding parking on the street. Our server was friendly and attentive. Im not much for burgers but I had one and it was great.  I love the berry cider! I would definitely come back to this location for another burger and some berry cider ...
Susanne R.,"San Diego, CA",450,542,888,4.0,2/21/2016,It took forever to get a table for 5 on a Saturday lunch time but once we were seated our waiter was ready to take our drinks order.  I had the flatbread pizza that is essentially a Margarita pizza but they call is something else. Really tasty with a crisp crust and fresh tomatoes and basil. Yum.  My friends had the deep dish pizza and they loved the different versions. They said the deep dish was not soggy gooey but had the right balance of fried versus doughy texture.
Heather U.,"San Gabriel, CA",5,37,6,1.0,2/22/2017,"Went for lunch special. Chicken, bacon, ranch Piadana was not what I expected. It came with fries, and the fries tasted better. The piadana was small and not filling. Not worth the $10.60 price."
Alex S.,"Long Beach, CA",271,8,5,1.0,6/10/2016,I went on a busy post graduation night so I expected it to be busy. I've worked in the restaurant industry as a server before. Service was not good. The guy who was supposed to be our server was busy trying to close out a large party who looked like they split checks. Regardless if that was the situation they shouldn't have sat us yet.  We waited for over 20 minutes for bar drinks. 50 minutes in and we have only seen our server assistant a few times. Food came out. 2 out of 3 plates were cold.......I doubt I will return here. Very disappointing. There are plenty of other options around.
