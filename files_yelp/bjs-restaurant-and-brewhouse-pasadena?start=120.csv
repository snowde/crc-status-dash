Steven S.,"San Gabriel, CA",72,14,4,5.0,8/14/2016,Came here with my girlfriend and the service and food was excellent will be coming back in the near future!
Dr. Darrick S.,"Pasadena, CA",10,54,270,2.0,6/8/2016,"The girl bartenders suck here. Totally incompetent. Haven't refilled my beer or ask me if I wanted a beer. As for food, silver ware and napkins. They forget about you. It's a good thing the food is good."
Anthony R.,"Baldwin Park, CA",24,15,1,1.0,3/2/2017,"This was quite possibly one I've the most inconvenient lunch I have ever experienced. The restaurant was just about empty when I arrived in a party of three for a 13:00 lunch time. I noticed hardly anyone in the beautifully architectured building, so I went to the bar high tops for quick lunch special service. Little did I know I would wait for all of service to be provide at the same time. It was a bit ridiculous. I felt like I was in a reality show testing ones patience and thinking of how only in Pasadena, CA would this happen and I was not going to sign a consent to film form. I ordered a vodka soda with a water one the side, Brussels Sprouts and the other two orders in the party were a soup and salad with waters. The soups and salads are ready made dishes, meaning you set it and serve it. However, it took a total of 20 min to serve cold soup (oil had elevated to the top of the cooking soup) and salad. It was what appeared to be some one who served the first two dishes and waited for the third dish to be ready. All at the same time forgetting the drinks, because everything was served at the same time. I mean EVERYTHING. When we asked for an second serving of the endless soup and salad. It took another lengthy amount of time before we saw a soup, and the soup order was the wrong one. In the end we paid for a $30 something lunch that really made me just want to walk out in that bill. When we called to share our experience, we were sent an generic apology letter with $15 in credit. This was very disparaging for the brand. The location is perfect for a great restaurant, or service team that actually cares for their customers, rather than pretentiously running thru the early crowd, assuming that they don't tip anyway so what's the point.  PS just cause your ""in the kitchen"", doesn't mean you cannot be heard.  Hope you get better BJ's. You can quote me!"
Kay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,4,,2.0,4/5/2017,"I love the ambience of this BJ's location, but I really dislike when I place an online pick up order they are so slow or they accidentally give my order to someone else."
Plan B.,"San Diego, CA",52,87,532,5.0,7/20/2015,"Review 76 Why? Pizza, beer, wings, dessert and the awesome video wall!  Yes welcome to one of the most known sport bar chains I so much enjoy visiting. This BJ's Restaurant is the same as all other when it comes to its menu and ambiance. They have a rewards program available for those frequent visitors. When signing up you'll instantly get a free Pizooki, from there you earn point for free meals. I've had excellent service starting with our host, hot tasty food and great waiters. I yet to have a bad experience at this location.  Parking is subterranean with an entrance on Colorado: no validation!! Plan B I only submit 5-Star reviews, if I post a review it's cause 'hat's off"" I recommend the establishment and will return for another experience. I don't feel the need to submit a review with less than 5-Stars, regardless if I check in, submit a picture or tip. I suggest Yelp change it's reviews to a category scoring system, then is when I can be fair and review each place I visit. PM me if you like additional information."
Telma E.,"Downey, CA",1,33,18,1.0,3/14/2017,"I went with a party of 10 people, we got the WORST service ever!!! Drake the manager evem came to aoplogize yet nothing changed. None of us got the correct food. Our drinks  took over half an hour.  Drake came over again to apologize and offered free desserts that never came out. We all were very upset, to top it off the bill was a mess and took over 40 mins to actually get paid  Never again WORST service ever!!!"
Aye J.,"San Diego, CA",286,12,5,5.0,6/10/2017,There were some problems during our dinner. But our server was really nice. The manager was also very understanding and accommodating. In the end he comped everything except the one alcoholic drink. Which I really appreciate.
Beatriz L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/19/2016,"Food wasnt worth what i spent, no flavor whatsoever other then that the service was excellent but would give props to Ariana who was great at taking our order and making sure we didnt needed anything. Wouldnt come back overall not worth my money."
Peter M.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/9/2017,Not sure why the rating is so low.  I come here once a week for lunch and the service and food are very good.  Recommend the Turkey Burger and the Chili.
Sarahmi H.,"Alhambra, CA",0,16,23,1.0,1/15/2017,"Waited 30 minutes for our appetizers, another 29 minutes for our entrees, food is slow, service is slow. Got our rib-eye streak, ordered medium came out extra well done (burned) on the outside and under cooked on the inside. The restaurant must not paying the chiefs enough money that they had to mess up the food so bad to piss off the customers. We ended up sending the food back and left with empty stomach. Horrible dining experience."
Tim T.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,8,,3.0,11/1/2017,"First time going to this BJ's, but frequent my neighborhood location. Was seated immediately with a party of five, and the restaurant did not seem overtly busy, but once ordering, the food took very long to come out and did not all come out at the same time. In addition to this, there were no place settings at the table until I asked for them after receiving the food. I ordered the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs, which I had ordered before from a different BJ's and thoroughly enjoyed, but for some reason it was so unbelievably spicy at this location I could barely get through each bite and my lips were left burning. My friend tried it as well and confirmed to me it wasn't just due to my taste buds (and, to note, I do enjoy spicy things, but this was an intense, unwanted spice). Service was decent but nothing special, otherwise. Better ambience than most BJ's, however, and I enjoyed the setup of the restaurant. All in all, I would come to this location again (and order something different) but prefer my neighborhood BJ's."
Sonal P.,"Orange County, CA",180,563,12,2.0,9/8/2015,"I love the salads and pizza at BJs, but this location got 2 stars from me because of the service...not so much the food.  It was a Thursday evening and pretty quiet inside the restaurant. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, apps, and entrees. While there was only one person working the bar, it seemed like all the other staff must have gone home for the day. Numerous people had kept asking about their food, including us. When our salads came out - mine was actually entered in wrong. While I waited another 20 min for a salad, I watched in complete hunger at everyone else with their food around me. Once my salad arrived, the pizza came within a few minutes - leaving me with a bunch of plates and little to no space for anything else. I was pretty annoyed at the amount of food I had in front of me - not to mention, by the time I finish my salad, the pizza was already cold and didn't taste as great to eat.  I'm really disappointed in this location BJs, The service and experience of this location, fell short of everything I enjoy about the sports bar."
Kristine B.,"Glendora, CA",4,2,2,1.0,11/5/2016,Horrible service. We have been here 3 times. So third strike-- you're out! Each time we have waited for food for longer than 40 minutes. Got food with no setting. If I could rate no stars I would.
Gabriela T.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,10,4,4.0,10/2/2016,"I'll be honest a few things were off, but a chewy steak is out of the server and managers hand so I'll give them a 4. The manager drake was very good to us. You can tell he has great customer service skills. Thank you Drake for the dessert and for keeping us updated on the food. Really appreciate it !"
Maggie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,2,,5.0,3/6/2017,If your in. The area please request to sit with Kaitlin she was the absolute best we were there for quick drinks and she managed to. Make our entire night ! Great service defiantly will be coming back to this location !! Thank you Kaitlin
Ernie M.,"Pasadena, CA",186,33,34,4.0,6/9/2016,Very Friendly Waitress and the food was great. I live in Pasadena and I have only been to this BJ's twice. I will make sure to come here more often.
Clare F.,"Melbourne, Australia",43,16,,3.0,12/4/2016,"This rating is mainly for customer service. Our food was accidentally dropped on its way out and the staff were super great about telling us, discounting the bill and generally being lovely. I had the holiday special - steak was a bit over cooked but pretty delicious. A lot of food for the price including their weird cookie dessert which was super good. And the beer list is extensive and good. My partner had the salmon quinoa salad which was average and the deep dish pizza was more like a thick crust than deep dish. All round good experience for a mid level family restaurant."
Daniel A.,"Justice, IL",16,16,2,5.0,5/23/2016,"I love this place so much! Amazing food. Everything on the menu is great and there is something for everyone. Great lunch specials, great dinners, great for drinks. It's all here! Beautiful location. Nice atmosphere. Quick compared to other BJs locations on service and food time. I can't express my love for the avo egg rolls and chicken California club enough!! They're must haves!"
Ana Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,91,,5.0,12/6/2016,"i had a really nice experience here.  katie was our server on saturday night and she was great.  as a vegan, there's really only a couple things i can have (guac and chips, pasta marinara) and she suggested ways to jazz it up.  also, it was my boyfriend's birthday and she brought out a mini pizooki, which i had no idea even existed.   the building used to be a bank and is gorgeous inside.  chandeliers, ceilings, the works.  i look forward to coming here again!  thanks katie!"
Adeline P.,"Newhall, CA",33,16,14,3.0,8/7/2016,This is my to go to bjs this place is so goood. There's one by my house but this one's the best. The foods always so good and fresh. Always clean and the waiters honestly always make my dinner lunch better cause of their fun attitudes.Just one complain I went in with my friend yesterday at night and we got a pitcher of our favorite beer Jeremiah Red and it tasted like it was from the bottom of the keg mentally IDK but we couldn't finish it besides that everything's pretty good.
