Sonia P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/11/2017,"The service was horrendous. The waiter who took our order was very professional and friendly. When a girl brought my steak dinner over, I asked her where my mashed potatoes were she had a blank look and said""oh they had to make a new batch"" then she walked away! No apology or anything. I guess I had to wait for my friendly waiter. When I told him I never got my potatoes he said ""they didnt give you the potatoes? Sorry, I'll get you your potatoes right away."" The next rude girl who came over brought us our dessert. As I asked for extra utensils, I realized she was gone. Rude, rude , rude! Who hired these girls? They seemed miserable. No smile, no questions. Not service oriented individuals. The food, drinks, and dessert were good, but the service was horrible. Again, the waiter was good. It was his female counterparts who were really unprofessional and unfriendly. The management is completely at fault. They are not training their staff properly. Maybe they aren't hiring the right type of people. I will never go back there again."
Jose L.,"Middleburg Heights, OH",0,1,,2.0,1/24/2017,"The beer was quite ok but the service and food didn't match it. I ordered an appetizer salad and an entree after being asked a couple of times if I didn't want any starter. Then, both were served at the same time. I had to eat the main dish first (sirloin) otherwise it would get cold. I asked for a medium rare sirloin and this was over cooked and also the meat cut was far from a prime piece.  The place was not even busy (early in the evening), so it can't be attributed to stress in the kitchen. It is a pity, because the beer is nice, the Art Deco  socialist style decoration is very neat and the space is beautiful ."
Barry M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",123,7,,1.0,7/21/2017,The service at this BJs is not worth the 1 star I gave them and certainly not worth the 2.5 stars they have. I ordered take out and was told the order would be ready in 20 min. When I arrived the food was right behind the hostess table. The manager was at the hostess table and another employee was there sorting silverware. I told them I was there for pick up and they said someone would be with me shortly. Five minutes later I had not been helped. I asked if one of them could get someone so I could pay and leave. The manager in an i dignant way said I would just have to wait. Finally after almost 20 minutes I left with no food. BJs is on the busiest street in Pasadena yet the place was empty. Its a shame this one store can ruin a franchises reputation.
Jasmyn V.,"Pasadena, CA",124,2,,5.0,7/20/2017,Ahhh I worked a busy shift and I wanted to relax with some beer and appetizer I didn't wanna deal with people or anything so I went to the bar and the bar tender Ariana was amazing she definitely lifted me from the funk I was in food was great and the drinks were even better I went home in a better mood friendly and funny
Karl J.,"San Pedro, CA",0,14,4,5.0,1/3/2017,"We had lunch here a couple of weeks ago; great place! Amazing building (an old bank), terrific service, friendly staff and best tasting BJ's I've been to so far (this is the 4th place I've been too). The boneless sriracha chicken was excellent, as was the deep dish pizza. I'll be back for sure!"
Liam M.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",202,9,12,1.0,8/14/2016,"I didn't do this the first time I came here months ago, but coming here again and the service still being horrible is uncalled for. Does it really take that much to acknowledge the table and bring us water?? The excuse is there systems are down. I'm sorry, it doesn't take computers to bring us water!!! Do not eat here. Go to the Glendale or Burbank one. Bj's you suck! Oh and let me add, both times the restaurant was completely not busy!"
Amy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,3,2.0,12/8/2016,"The rib eye steak was burn and too well done when I asked for a medium well. The thin cut fries tasted like old fries and refried again when served. The ribs were ok. Nothing stood out like a wow. The meat was tender.  Fresh mozzarella abd tomato salad was good. Clam chowder was a bit salty and not hot. It came out just a little bit warm as if it was put on the soup bowl for awhile before served. White peach margarita tasted terrible. I loved the service. Our server, Thomas, was great! He was very attentive. 5 stars for his service."
Stevo O.,"San Gabriel, CA",197,627,975,3.0,1/30/2016,"Okay, I had a hundred dollar gift certificate for BJ's, and wanted to use it, as I did not want to spend too much cash, after the holidays.  We chose a different  BJ's location i Pasadena to try it out, so we parked in the underground parking, and just walked up to the restaurant.  It was amazingly not packed, like the one in Arcadia, and I was wondering why.  Well, it seems the service is not the best here, and they don't validate parking!  Well, as my boss says, ""bummer"".  On to the food, which was just meh in my opinion.  The fish tacos were mushy, and the sauce had no flavor whatsoever.  My wife was relatively happy with her pasta, and the kids were okay with their pasta and hamburger.  The only thing outstanding here to me was their television at the bar, which seemed to stretch at least 10 feet across.  If I were into sports, this place might seem a little better.  But with the poor service, and lack of taste in their food, I'll try another restaurant and spend cash for a decent meal."
Tiffany D.,"Rosemead, CA",8,6,,2.0,11/22/2016,"I've been to this location for a couple times and neither time was that great. The last time was not very impressive. First of all, the service was so slow. We've been looking for our waiter and had no idea where he is. Took forever to wave down our waiter and then finally able to place our orders. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip as Appetizer. The Dip was too cheesy for my taste. I can barely taste any of the veggies in there. Hardly any artichoke chunks were in there. I ordered the Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus Pasta for my entree. There was practically no flavor in there, where I had to add salt on my own. The shrimp does not look like what you see in the picture. It came out as tiny, baby shrimps without any shrimp flavor. I like to go to BJ's, but not sure if it was this location or just a bad day for them. Was not impress at all."
Sarah C.,"Pasadena, CA",9,156,73,2.0,7/12/2015,"The brussel sprouts were fantastic, as well as the mashed potatoes. That's what gets the stars. My mojito was loaded with so much alcohol I could even drink it. Same goes for the piña colada. The calamari was one of the worst I've had. He watermelon feta salad was done lazily and awful. Our service was bad. What's weird is I remember having the deep dish pizza at a BJs years ago and it was amazing. I bragged about it and thought we should go. What a waste of money! The pizza was awful...awful. It was doughy and lacked flavor. I will not be back."
Rodny B.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",31,2,,2.0,6/17/2017,"Honesty came in thinking someone would help me and my family to get us seated, but it was as if I was a goats in the room waiters walked passed me without acknowledging that if I have been helped out or not although the food was good just need to step up customer service at this location"
Robert F.,"Overland Park, KS",155,175,70,4.0,7/8/2015,So this place has everything!  Pick the type of food you want and it is here with some of their premium local made beer.  This is one of the few times I have eaten at  a BJ's and was excited to go thinking that they were only here in California... turns out I was wrong about that they have them in Texas as well.  Maybe we will get one in KC eventually. Our waitress Sarah was fantastic.  And was quick with recommendations and genuinely friendly and interested in us and our choices.  The food returned quick and was fantastic.  The beer was chilled and delicious. Also then there was the desert... cookie in the little skillet type thing with ice cream on it.  Just phenomenal.
J M.,"Los Angeles, CA",303,7,,1.0,8/14/2016,"I love the BJs restaurant. This branch has the worst...service...ever...we weren't attended to for 25minutes. My group and I literally were seated and were not asked for drinks or appetizers for close to 30minutes. This being a service job, you need to try better...normally I wouldn't give bad reviews, but...this happened twice in the same location. 1 star for service and my experience at this location"
Ee C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,17,11,5.0,5/23/2016,"Spent my birthday dinner here last year, and my birthday lunch here again this year! Always a great time at BJs!  Special shoutout to our waiter Jimmy H for singing a birthday song for me! :)"
Allie P.,"South Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",982,623,1744,3.0,2/13/2014,"Decent late night HH deals. Bar section seating if there for late night HH. Newly designed restaurant - looks very nice inside... I like to look up (if seated in the bar area). TVs everywhere. Service is alright, the usual. There is now a valet available if you don't like finding parking on your own... luckily I don't have to ever worry about parking in Old Town. WHEN IS HH? Mon-Fri 3-7pm  Sun-Thurs 10pm-Close $4  - All BJ craft beers and call drinks - Flatbread (margherita fresca and california club) - Boneless wings $5 - Mojitos and Martinis - Spinach and Artichoke Dip (HH sized) - Chicken Pot Stickers (HH sized) - Angus Beef Sliders (HH sized)  $6 - Select wines - Chicken Lettuce Wraps - Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Avocado Egg Rolls - Mini Deep Dish Pizza Additional Notes: Wine Down Tuesdays - half off by the glass or bottle Thursdays - $3.50 per pint (all BJ craft beers) I was pleased with the food and the prices were decent.  Liked how they're an option for late night HH on weeknights also. :]"
Sam S.,"Washington, DC",95,202,686,4.0,5/21/2015,I was pleasantly surprised by BJs large menu. The dining space is very large and the noise level is pretty loud.  There is something for everyone on the menu. I was able to order a kale salad with shrimp that was quite tasty. Next time I will ask for light dressing.  The service was on the slower side but it was understandable due to how busy they were.  They have a very large center tv at the bar making it a great place to go have a drink and watch the game. They have some large tables so it's a good option for entertaining groups.
Michelle M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",81,84,77,3.0,12/19/2016,"Went to BJ's for lunch today, and was a little disappointed.  Let me first start by saying I love BJ's and go to the Ontario, CA location all of the time, but this was my first visit to the Pasadena location.  So went in around 12:30, and surprisingly it wasn't that busy, but it took our sever 10 minutes to even acknowledge us, and 45 minutes to bring our food.  When asked why it was taking so long, she said the kitchen was backed up.  I'm sorry, we only ordered a salad and a club sandwich.  And no, the restaurant was not even busy.  Maybe 10 tables if that, and not nearly the same amount of business during dinner hours or on the weekend.  Love BJ's but probably won't return to this location because of their poor customer service, and nonchalant attitude by the staff."
Frankie A.,"Monterey Park, CA",47,28,32,1.0,1/16/2016,Worst pizza ever. It's the BJs favorite and it was cold and not good. We asked the waiter to hear it again since the cheese wasn't even melted the. It came back lukewarm. Sad. Never got chili flakes or park cheese until we were thoroughly not appetizer anymore.
Aime J.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",85,107,241,1.0,12/5/2015,"Not my favorite BJ's location.  I've dined here multiple times; lunch, dinner, on and off peak times. I've had a number of waiter's I wasn't necessarily happy with.  Every time I come here to grab drinks they throw me a little attitude when asking to see my ID.  I understand that they need to verify my age, but there's a polite way to do so.   There is a line between being friendly and coming off as rude and I've had multiple waiters here cross that line. The food is alright.  I usually build a pizza or try a pasta.  Last week we tried their new Siracha Chicken Bacon Mac n Cheese.  Do not recommend it.  Note that the pasta used is penne, not macaroni.  The cheese sauce used tasted almost like nacho cheese and made it difficult to eat.  I like their Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad.  That's probably my go-to and I hate ordering salads at restaurants, but this is a pretty filling salad even between two people. Not too heavy and also a little refreshing. Pizookies are always to die for! I've never had a bad experience with pizookies. Last time a waiter was kind enough to help us sample a couple of their brews to help us decide what to drink.  I like light beers and recommend their Brewhouse Blonde or their Piranha Pale Ale. For those into darker brews, go for the Nutty Brewnette or Jeremiah Red.  Or for those just looking for something sweet to drink try the Berry Burst Cider!  I usually love going to BJs with a group of friends, but I really do not recommend this location.  Though this is also the slowest location I've been to so far."
Brad S.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,252,2,2.0,12/15/2015,"Lordy - this place has gone down in quality of food and service. The wifey and I would typically frequent BJ's if the Yard House was packed. We stopped by for a quick bite and drinks to end a hard day. We'd ordered a BJ's Classic Combo Pizza and Crispy Honey Chicken Salad. The pizza was primarily thick dough with minimal cheese, sausage, pepperoni et al. What was more deflating is that this picture of the pizza was 1/2 the thickness as shown on the menu. The Crispy  Chicken Salad - the chicken tenders were very overdone; if you want real crispy, hard chicken tenders - this is the salad you should order.  The last time we were there we'd ordered BJ's flatbread Margherita Fresca, but when it arrived it was missing the shredded basil. Once we informed the waitress it took almost ten minutes to get the basil and the flatbread was cold.  I had hoped BJ's would have improved, but alas not....it may be a long time before we venture to BJ's again."
