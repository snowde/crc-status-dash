Brittnee M.,"Riverside, CA",69,2,,1.0,10/20/2016,Worst BJ's experience. I mean what am I really expecting as far as service from a chain but we waited 50 minutes for an appetizer that eventually came AFTER the entrees. And had to ask 2 different wait staff for silverware. Manager was MIA and didn't address any issues. Basically indifferent to piss poor service.
Vivian S.,"Alhambra, CA",199,190,673,2.0,12/23/2015,"Came here on a Friday night, not to busy. The two of us got seated on a pretty empty side of the restaurant. It took a while for our food to come, very disappointing. It also took a while for us to get utensils once our food came. In addition to that, it took a while for us to get our boxes and check as well. The food was ok, I had the Root Beer Ribs and a small pizza. I wouldn't say it was worth the trouble. Next time, I'll go with ordering it togo."
Martinez M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,5.0,5/23/2017,"Food was great and came out quickly also our sever was great he was attentive and greeted us right away. Out of all the times I've came to this location this was definitely the best experience since our server was great had a lot of small tables and didn't forget about us once while other times I've came the server has been slammed and couldn't handle as many tables which sometimes makes me wonder about the management. Also the only thing I would change would be to be greeted as soon as I arrive, I personally don't like having to be the one the say hi first when I arrive into the lobby."
Kristen S.,"Newport Beach, CA",158,33,2,1.0,6/20/2016,"tried to go for dinner on a very slow Monday at 5pm. The hostess didn't even say hello to me as I walked in and when I said ""table for 4"" she simply grabbed the menus and sat me in the only table that was in the sun. After not being helped for over 15 minutes the hostess walked by so I asked if we could get some help from our waiter. She immediately went back to the hostess stand and started texting. We walked out after 30 minutes of no help and were barely noticed. Yikes!"
Linda B.,"Altadena, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/29/2017,"The food was fair. We waited for 25 minutes for our meal. The wrong pizza was brought to the table. Then I was given fish and chips with cocktail sauce. When I asked about tarter sauce, the waitress told me the kitchen told her to tell me there was none. She did not tell me this  , to lick our wounds, we asked for a poozookie that never came. The manager told me that he would get me a credit for one for another time. I usuallh just go with things...this wad a bit much."
Victor A.,"North Hills, CA",1,22,61,1.0,6/21/2016,"This place sucks they should closed this place down .  Food has no flavor,  takes for ever to be serve.  I don't recommend this dump."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,3/6/2015,"Why do I let friends shlepp me to places like this?? Long waits of mediocre service and even less stellar food. I have sampled my way through much of their menu and am usually glad when someone orders a pizza, I get a salad and nab a slice. I had their new BLT salad and while it was OK, it was super tiny and anything but healthy. They ordered a large all meat thin crust and it while it was ok, I prefer the deep dish and toppings other then meat, not BJ's fault. Service is pretty bad, lackluster and rushed,  the food  just as well. I don't get the hype of this place, really why wait an hour to eat here? It gets so full and you can barely have a descent conversation, not on my dime."
Meka G.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,2,1.0,10/21/2016,"no point of visiting this bj's ever again! worse service and burnt steak ever!!!!!! took the waiter to walk past us 3 times to notice us! food came out warm, burnt and i didn't finish my meal! 3 bites of my burnt steak and it ruined my  appetite!!!"
Jenny N.,"San Diego, CA",519,377,150,3.0,9/18/2014,"I never had lunch at BJ's before but apparently they have really good lunch deals supposedly starting at 5.95 and up. Although the portions are not as big as a regular entrée, I must say that it's still pretty darn big for me. Ordered a club sandwich combo around $7.00 something-  which comes with your choice of their soups- I chose clam chowder. The club sandwich came out with a side of frites as well, pretty good! The sandwich itself was good, you really can't go wrong ordering a club sandwich - bacon and avocado just makes everything yum. However, the clam chowder itself was super duper salty. I had to drink a big gulp of water every time I take a sip of that chowder. Not good.  Friend of mine ordered the ""shrimp scampi pasta with clam chowder (in a bread bowl)."" Although it's lunch portion on the lunch menu, it was still a very big portion - this combo is around $16.00. My friend literally just finished her chowder bowl and only touched a bit of her pasta since all their portions were huge.  Other friend of mine ordered the unlimited soup & salad. It comes with unlimited salads with the choice of:  caesar salad, wedge salad or fresh mozzarella and tomato salad.  My friend chose the Caesar salad and it's a good portion every time they serve it to her. It's unlimited, you can't go wrong with eating salad when there's a few choices to choose from every time.  For appetizer - we ordered the ""Ahi-Poke."" The Ahi-Poke with avocado was a good combo along with the crunchy wonton chips. I thought the Poke was fresh, so that was good. Too bad the Ahi- Poke came out after our meal, not so much of an appetizer for us afterall.  Overall, the food was great but I thought the waiting time was a bit too long. Either because my friends and I were on an one hour lunch break - which cuts it really close to have lunch at restaurant or their service is just slow. I felt like the service was just slow but maybe others had a better experience here when they had lunch.  The ambience and anterior was great. I can imagine coming here after work to just have a beer and relax. I loved the set-up inside this BJs as well, it's different than the other BJs I've been to. Our server was also really awesome, always making sure that we have what we needed, and that my friend's salad plate is never empty."
Amy R.,"Alhambra, CA",569,92,1224,4.0,9/22/2015,"What can I say that isn't true about most slightly expensive nice bar/restaurant chains. The decor was beautiful from the windows to the wall. They had a long and nice bar with a huuuuge flat screen t.v behind it and multiple flat screens throughout the establishment. It is a great place to eat and watch a game or two! The food was good but nothing could be considered scrumptious except of course THE PAZOOKIE which was absolutely scrumptious and melt in your mouth delectable one of a kind treat! I had requested from the get go to get my pazookie first and had to ask 2 more times before the waiter told me there was a mix up and it wasn't even put in the oven yet, by that time I had already recieved my pizza, so I told him to not worry and have it come out later. I was disappointed as I am one of the few fairy people that enjoy their deserts first=) The avocado eggrolls were yummy as well as their ranch and veggie pizza. I ordered roasted garlic in addition to my toppings and it was scrump, but they could have put a lot more. The server was nice even though the food was not served in a timely manner even though the restaurant was not packed by all means. FYI they do not Validate your ticket, so unless you ask they will tell you to walk all the way to the main middle of the paseo to the parking lot entrance to validate your ticket in an automated machine. No bueno with that inconvenience."
Dorian W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/20/2016,"The service is horrendous.To wait 45 minutes on just a baked potato is ridiculous. It was not a full lunch crowd. Had a bowl of soup, my co-worker had soup and salad, we all finished and still no baked potato. I dont know if the management is Lackadaisical or the cooks are lackadaisical but if you want for them to grow the potato and then bake it, go to BJ's on E Colorado"
Joanna L.,"Los Angeles, CA",482,760,930,3.0,9/16/2014,"I have always wonder how this place looked like on the inside since it use to be a bank - so I got a chance to check it out when I had dinner here Sunday night. It was pretty nice since it still had the high ceiling and the bar area was pretty neat - huge big screen TV right smack in the middle. It was pretty busy and we waited about 20 minutes before getting seated.  The service was pretty nice, the hostess was nice, complimented my dress and had a brief chat about the weather. Our waitress was friendly too and provided pretty good service.  The food was okay - I ordered the BJ Cobb Salad with dressing on the side - the portions are pretty big and I had it for two meals. I also ordered the Corn Fritters - which was okay but not what I expected. My boyfriend ordered the Traditional Wings as entree and also one of their new starter salads (BLT Twist). The wings were good and I like how they didn't drench it in the buffalo sauce rather they had it on the side.  Overall I had a good experience with the service and the food. The only one little complaint is probably that the food took quite a long time to come out but they were busy so eh."
Anita B.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,78,5,1.0,8/25/2016,"BJs you have a lot of work to do... I am going to be brief because you already wasted plenty of my time.  When a customer sits down greet them in a timely fashion.  When you drop food make sure they have plates, silverware and napkins.  Check on them regularly so they done have to ASK for everything including the bill.  Thanks for wasting my time see you never"
Victor C.,"Studio City, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Must have been the worst visit to a BJ restaurant. I went to this location for a birthday celebration on 01/14/17 @9:00P with a party of 10, the service was great until we were seated, the service was extremly slow, and once we did place a food order and after 20min wait, the servers bring the hot food out which looked amazing but unfortunately my guest were stuck just looking at the food since there were NO silverware available! Once i requested for a manager, they sent Drake Beasly-Dining Room manager inwhich just starred at me rolling his eyes and stating what did i want him to do about it, the best he can do is give us plastic forks and spoons, i requested for all the food to be sent back and redo all my orders once someone washes the silverware. After 30 additional minutes the manager comes over and throws his business card to me, and the servers bring is a pile of rolled up single forks and they still have the audacity to bring the same old food from earlier, this time I asked for the head manager since Drake was too busy talking and starring from far with the other servers. Nicole in the other hand was proffesional and made sure that we received fresh food. Waiting for corporate to give me a call back about this."
G W.,"Manassas, VA",350,478,215,3.0,7/31/2016,Ok service here. This location is not as good as the Arcadia BJ's. The Pazookie monkey bread is money. The chef on this shift was real skimpy on the sauces for the apps we ordered.
Zarah B.,"Denver, CO",46,40,1,3.0,10/21/2016,"This place was ok, but Why so slow? The service was friendly, but where did you go all that time? Not that many tables and we were continually waiting."
Tanisha G.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,1,5.0,4/1/2017,"Decided to go to BJ's in Pasadena for a family celebration dinner. Unfortunately, it was a Saturday evening and also during the Final Four so it was packed.  Some of the excellent food they always have was unfortunately not perfectly prepared as ordered because of how busy it was I'm sure.  No excuse, it's a restaurant right?  So why 5 stars?  Well, our waitperson Conner was amazingly attentive to our needs, despite how busy it was and he was great even on a night when the kitchen wasn't at its best.  The manager, Sean, also was exceptional in his handling of the few errors with our dinner order.  Overall, we were very satisfied and left happy.  More importantly, we'll be back!"
Annie L.,"Cerritos, CA",3,88,127,4.0,1/16/2016,"I normally wouldn't write a review for a major chain restaurant, but the customer service I experienced compels me to recognize their good work. But first, the mandatory food review. I haven't been to a BJ's in a few years. I liked their food overall, but I had not been back since they revised their menu to the current one. So everything but the pizza and pizookies seemed new to me. I ordered a sandwich and shared 2 appetizers with my friend. Here is the breakdown: Chicken Pesto Sandwich: Comes with a salad that could have been a little crisper, but the dressing was light and tasty. The sandwich was more of a melt. Hot and cheesy (sounds like the perfect man). The chicken itself wasn't my favorite. Seemed over-salted and a little dry. My fix to that was dipping the sandwich in ranch dressing. Hehe...what? It worked!  Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts: Get it. Just do it. They're good. Don't argue with me. Order them. Note: they come in more quantity than in the picture. Maybe the brussel sprouts in the pictures are ginormous.  Guacamole and Chips: I took a leap of faith and hoped the guac and chips would be tasty...and I regret doing that. Yes, the guacamole was made of real avocados. But the portion was small. We ran out of guac before the chips were finished :( And I was eating it kind of sparingly.  Now on to the reason I started writing this review. I had a little bit of a mishap with my food that resulted in me asking for a refund. They were more than willing to do so. AND they also comped our Party Pizookie. I don't even get treated this well on my birthday! Thank you BJ's Pasadena! Parking is underground or street. Underground parking gets 90 minutes validation at a self-serve machine near the entrance to the underground lot. BJ's themselves doesn't offer validation. For our 2.5 hour stay, it came out to $3."
Francis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,47,13,3.0,7/31/2016,Ambivalent. The food is very good and the pricing is reasonable. Service is fine ..except for one issue..off peak seating. I went there solo in mid-afternoon and seating was confined to the bar and central dining area. There was one seat left at the bar with barely enough room to extend your elbows without impinging on ur fellow diners turf. I hate it when restaurants crowd diners into a small area during slow periods. Is it really that big a deal to spread diners out through the entire dining area and give everyone some comfortable personal space. I would gladly compensate the waiter for walking a few extra steps to deliver my meal if it meant a little peace and quiet. Not all restaurants do this and i think most diners would rather have some separation if possible. I declined the seat and went to a nearby restaurant.
Dani K.,"San Francisco, CA",1,10,,1.0,2/21/2016,"Worst dining experience I've had: 15 minutes for waiter acknowledgement 20 minutes to get soft drinks 45+ minutes to get food (ordered same time as our drinks) Update: I emailed Catherine below, and she never responded."
