James B.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",1109,1101,1387,2.0,1/24/2013,"This location is huge! As soon as you enter, you'll notice the extremely high ceilings and its old-school architecture. I was kind of taken aback in a good way. Too bad that was the only pleasant part of my visit here. Food: 2 Stars** 1) Great Beginnings - This would be a great appetizer for large parties had the food been hot. The spinach dip in the appetizer had the consistency of liquid cement as opposed to a warm dip. What a FAIL. The avocado egg rolls were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The cheese in the mozzarella sticks were more like string cheese than gooeym melted cheese. 2) Mediterranean Pizza - overly salty. 3) Jalapeno burger - I liked the overall flavor of the burger because of the spicy kick from the jalapenos, but the patty was soo overly cooked and dry that it ruined my appetite. It was like an equivalent to a dehydrated McDonalds patty. 4) Cajun Pasta - nothing special. It's definitely not worth the price or the calories.  You can find much better pasta elsewhere for similar or even cheaper prices. Service: 2 stars** I feel like the servers didn't want to check on us because we were a large party and it would've been a hassle for them to get refills for everyone. Parking: The parking sucks here. BJ's is not part of the Paseo, so if you park in the Paseo lot, you won't be able to get validation. You'll have to settle for parking elsewhere. Good luck."
Juan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/7/2017,"Not coming back again ... it took them about 20 mm for the hostess to acknowledge us they were to busy discussing work issues in front of customers  , food was not what I expected I order an rib eye steak medium cook the stake came out really burned from the outside and very raw from the inside ""bloody""  our waitress was very helpful  Katlin M"
denise m.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,17,,1.0,10/19/2015,"I highly would recommend you DONT come here  1-poor service  -they sat us very distant from the rest of the eaters and didn't check on us often  - they didn't bring the waters till about 10 minutes of waiting  2- poor quality/food preparation  -the pizza we ordered was cold. It had raw onions on it.  -The clam chowder was very salty and they don't originally bring it in the bread bowl. They replaced the food once we complained about but by then it was too late.  3-we asked them several times to put the football game on (since we were sitting by ourselves)  By the time they accommodated us with the birthday girls dessert and some of the food, my sisters birthday dinner was pretty much a flop. The manager tried to salvage the night. I mean, we appreciate the effort after the fact, but it was easily avoidable."
Suzuki R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,22,26,5.0,2/1/2015,"My family and I visited BJ's Pasadena yesterday for dinner (6 in our party).  Much, much, more than I expected for BJ's but we were in Pasadena after all. They're located at the intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Marengo Avenue on the ground floor. Easy parking across the street and in Pasadena be prepared to pay for parking.  So if you're into architecture then you are sure to enjoy a meal here. We were in an old 1924 Bank building. The columns took my breath away. We shared two appetizer platters, two Caesar salads and one of the signature deep-dish pizzas they're known for.  My son chose the BBQ chicken pizza.  My husband enjoyed the 152"" plasma TV along with his award-winning crafted adult beverage.  They were busy so the service was a bit delayed. They tried their best to make us feel as if we were their only customers. I do have to say my favorite was the dessert. My girls devoured their Chocolate Chip Pizookie topped with vanilla ice cream and we shared the Salted Caramel Pizookie.  AMAZING! If you're into a little sweet and a little salty. It's made with caramel cookie dough, almond toffee, pretzel bites and white and dark chocolate chips. Can't forget the vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate. We we're invited by a very special person and have come to look forward to our BJ's get togethers."
Avery M.,"West Covina, CA",126,27,2,2.0,11/3/2015,"I think that this is the worst BJ's that I have been to, and I love BJ's. I've been a few different times, and each time has been a disappointment.  One instance I can point out is that my friend got one of those Twisted BLT side salads, and the spinach was bad! It was rotten! It stank and tasted awful! The server was nice and switched it out for a Caesar. The next time I went there, with the same friend, she ordered the Gourmet Mac & Cheese. I love that dish, and she and I both get it frequently. When we got it, it was very dry and over-cooked. Not too much cheese sauce, and the pasta was really stiff. My friend pointed that out to the server, who said, ""Well, I've never had it before so..."" and tried to walk away. We had to call after her to have her take it back and bring a new one, which was a little better, thank heavens."
Adrienne H.,"Pasadena, CA",8,80,77,4.0,1/13/2016,"This is actually my second time at this location. It's a casual setting like the others but it is located, conveniently, in the Paseo. Our server, Chad, was so friendly. We were greeted with a smile and got a smile every time he came to the table. I knew I wanted some alcohol, just one glass though. I didn't know what I wanted but I knew what I didn't want. He came back with a Strawberry Patch. Very tasty! If I could order a pitcher of it to go, I would have!"
Destiny C.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/15/2017,"I usually come here every once in a while since I live so close. The service is always excellent and then I came yesterday! I couldn't believe how terrible the service was! My friends and I were put near the bar area and no one ever came to our table! It was not even busy! I asked the hostess if we can move into a booth since no one seemed to notice we were there! She said if someone left and someone cleaned the table, then we can move into one! After another 15 minutes a booth was available  and we moved into it by ourselves, still not acknowledged by any waiter. I even saw 3 workers standing at the front just talking to one another not even caring that we hadn't been helped! There we are, about 50 minutes without anybody coming to us. Finally a waiter  named Mary approached us and took our orders. 15 minutes went by and no drinks! It was terrible! Already about an hour and we hadn't even received our beverages. When our food finally came, my friends order was not what she ordered. I know I live closeby here but I don't think I'll come to this one again! Horrible horrible service!"
Ray D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,35,13,5.0,8/29/2016,"We had a family get together and this location was the closest for all of us. We had reservations, were sat right as we walked in and were served by Joe, a really nice guy. Everyone was happy with their food and the service was excellent."
Rebekah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2016,"Came to this place unfortunately for my Dad's birthday last night. Omg. After waiting and looking, I had to get up and ask the waiter whom I've asked already to bring a side of things so we can eat. It wasn't busy so, I didn't understand why she was pacing the floor and not getting what we had asked for, that would have been the right thing to do, OK.  I ordered a Philly cheese steak Pizza deep crust which was very mushy. It did not taste at all like a Philly cheesesteak. It tastes like a supreme which that's not what I ordered. I was so hungry. Stomach was not right after, ugh. I asked for it to be cooked longer and it came out the same way as it was before. I had two pieces and that was it. Ugh, lost my appetite. Ugh, who wants to eat mushy pizza and on top of that something that I didn't order. So so disappointed in this place, service and food. I was really looking forward to having a great evening but unfortunately it was ruined. I will NERVER come back here again or to any BJ's."
Hua K.,"Arcadia, CA",8,17,215,1.0,8/14/2015,"The food received it's different than on the menu , Crispy Calamari is way over cook. Pizza & Clam chowder & shrimp scampi Pasta too salty . 3 manager on duty , in front talking not even say hi, one of the server ( Africa American young lady) walking & eating at same time"
Alexander D.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",14,14,12,4.0,11/9/2015,"weeknights are chill afff because it's dead so your food comes out fresh as hell. Nicole s was a tight server,, If you order Ursula's pussy fibers[Crispy Calamari] ask for xxtra lemon to put all over and then dip in marinara. BAAAAAAWWWMBBBB. The salted caramel pazookie++++++++++++++"
Shain O.,"Boston, MA",10,125,27,2.0,1/10/2016,"Their happy hour changed from ""Ah, I guess we can go to BJ's for Happy Hour, it's pretty decent;"" to ""What is the point of going to BJ's for Happy Hour?""  They limited the drink and food options so much. The food itself (HH and non-HH) is... fine.  I would describe it as slightly higher-class TGI Fridays.  It's still not very creative and it's still terrible for you, but you don't feel as terrible about being there because the place is clean and your meal isn't served soaking in a pool of congealed fat.  This is actually a good place to grab a mid-price burger--the patty is good in terms of quality and size and you get a ton of fries. The service is good and this is a good option place to catch a game in the bar area.  There aren't a million screens to give you a seizure and the speakers aren't projecting six different programs at once."
Moe L.,"Pasadena, CA",10,27,,4.0,12/23/2015,"Love this place! Been coming here for almost a year and it feels like family. Chad was one of our excellent servers who now became manager. He is charismatic and super personable. I'm sure he will do well. It was a well deserved promotion due to his amazing service. We also love the attentiveness we received from Ethan G. who was 100% on when he helped us and dialed into all of our needs. For a guy who just got promoted he seems just as good or better than most of the experienced servers we have had. Good choice to move him up! Sadly, we have had a few scattered servers as well, but very few which is why I chose 4 stars and not 5, but I clearly believe people are doing their best here. That is what counts and why we visit sometimes once a week."
K N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,12,2.0,8/4/2016,"Dinner tonight was very disappointing. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, a large chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza, and fish & chips. No complaints about the spinach artichoke dip and the chips tasted like they were freshly made. The pizza was disappointing - it was mostly bread, hardly any sauce or toppings, and a tad soggy. The fish & chips were awful - the worst fish and chips I've ever had. The fish was overfried so it was dark brown and the fish was so dry. We sent it back and we never send food back. They brought us another fish & chips. The second time around, the fish was moist but the fried coating would not stay on. Basically, the fish kept falling apart in your fingers. The service was subpar as well.  They must've brought their B-team in today. Guess I won't be back."
Jenelle B.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",1176,806,712,4.0,12/20/2012,"Pizookie!! Like the best thing in this world besides puppies and newborn babies!  If you havent had a pizookie you havent lived. Its just a large warm cookie with ice cream on top. Pretty much warm heaven on earth. I LOVE that they allow you to get half of one flavor and half another.  So if you wanted an Oreo cookie pizookie and your friend wanted a Chocolate chip pizookie, you wouldn't have to compromise and you could get both in one pan. Trust me its enough to share!  Other than that the our waitress was quick and friendly. I went on a Friday and it wasn't crowded at all. It was Black Friday so that might of been the reason. Any-who great place for late night desserts."
Jonathan D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Twilight Zone We took an out of town guest to the Pasadena BJ's: Basically, the goals were fairly simple as for other restaurants: -Waiter takes the order -Someone brings back food Our BJ's waiter reported to the table a few times, always friendly. After each order, however, rather than fulfilling it, the results were nowhere to be seen -- literally lost. Little did we know. So we ordered a drink while we waited. Twice. We ordered dinner. Twice. Given it was a busy time, we thought, ok, it does take time. An hour later:  no soups, no salads, no dinner. Waiter returns, seeming completely disoriented as to why we have no food. Returns to kitchen. Sometime later, returns. More investigations. Order lost. Basically, if we had not asked, it wa s never coming. Apologies ensue; manager appears, offers to pay for some of our food.  We were friendly and understanding throughout. 30 minutes or so later, dinner arrives, 1.5 hours into this. So they had a problem, and apparently they are going to prove to us how great they are. Let's have some dessert. Change of waiter. New waiter knows nothing of our order. 30 minutes later, no dessert. Criminy, its a single scoop of ice cream and a single cookie.  We are friendly and understanding. We joke to the new waiter that we are thinking of ordering some dessert. Another 10-15 minutes later, dessert arrives.  The bill arrives, and there is partial coverage, not what we understood was to be provided that the manager had noted.  We pay the balance and leave. We are now looking for a restaurant that offers some simple outcomes: -Waiter takes the order -Someone brings back the food We imagine that won't be difficult to find. We are friendly, with a new understanding: you do not go to BJ's in Pasadena, ever."
Raj P.,"Glendale, CA",0,17,,1.0,3/17/2017,"Horrible host service, called ahead to book a table and said 20 min but once I arrived,  had to wait another 10 min. Very unprofessional."
Taylor H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",630,20,8,2.0,4/9/2016,We came inside BJs and were standing out front for a good 10min without someone taking down our name and asking how many people were in our party. They were understaffed and had no hospitality. Foods always great though! But slow service
Jeff M.,"Los Angeles, CA",121,65,36,4.0,12/22/2015,"Hot Tip: Get the Strawberry Splash! It was amazing. I'm a dude and I loved it! #2: They don't do reservations unless you have a large party. Saw other reviews and all I can saw is that I had a good time here! My food was good and the drinks were amazing. Again, the Strawberry Splash above! I had the ""new"" Hickory Brisket and Bacon. It was fantastic. The only problem with it was that it was super filling. But even then, I finished it. My gf got the salad wrap something whatever. I would have remembered it if she would have liked it. She liked my burger and fries though!  The other people in my party liked most of their food too. I think it was a pizza. I tried it and it was just ok."
Steve S.,"Alhambra, CA",0,6,1,2.0,11/30/2016,Been to BJs several times. The food is always consistant at each location. Service I find not so much. I don't want to use her name but our waitress tonight was not very friendly and she was very robotic. With the parking situation being a hassle we probably won't come to this location again. By the way I did leave the 15% tip.
