Bobby H.,"La Crescenta, CA",1,9,,2.0,1/12/2017,"Gosh, I want to like this place, I really do, but their customer service at times is just piss poor.  Case in point. I went in to buy a soda, in an attempt to avoid the rain.  After waiting 20 minutes I grew quite weary of waiting, and asked the person behind the order counter if I could just grab a soda from the bartender, she apologized, and then proceeded to take another 3 orders after I had confronted her.  I had already paid, but decided I would just go across the street and get drenched rather than wait.  The funniest thing is one of the staff members had the audacity to give me an online order form to place my order priori. Like I just ordered a soda.  How hard can it be to get????"
Christina L.,"Pasadena, CA",174,4,,2.0,6/7/2015,"I come here often because I love their pizookies and their appetizers are pretty yummy! But the last few times we have been here the service has been TERRIBLE! Clueless waitresses who have small sections and can't remember what our orders are and what we asked for. Today, it took our server 20 minutes to tend to us, after tending to two other tables that were sat in our section after us. After she asked us for our drink order, she was going to give us even more time to look over the menu. She wasn't ready for us to give her our order. Once the drinks came, she brought us the wrong drinks and we got our first refill after dinner was over. One of us never even got a refill on an iced tea.  One of us got a burger, didn't ask for bacon and bacon was on her burger. She also asked if the burger had a sauce, the waitress was positive there was- there was no sauce. we also had to ask a different server for condiments. This was better compared to our precious visit but not by much!  Our previous visit, the same instance happened where our server took more than 15 minutes to tend to us.  We ordered fish and chips and the Brewhouse nachos (not on the menu anymore but they still make it). The fish and chips were horribly over breaded and it took three visits from our server to finally bring the malt vinegar we asked when we first ordered. When I asked for the Brewhouse nachos, I asked her what came on it, she said ""I don't know because it's not on the menu,"" I asked her if she could get a list for me and she rolled her eyes at me. Then when I asked if I could give her a list of what I didn't want she sighed. I simply just asked for no jalapeños and dealt with picking everything off by hand.  Currently we are still waiting for our bill to be processed, I started writing this review once we finished our dessert."
Diane A.,"Upland, CA",0,21,,2.0,9/22/2015,"First I would like to say they do validate for parking. I read reviews on here saying they don't and one person said they did validate. I did get my parking validated. Maybe it was the weekend? But I just wanted to say that. I'm not sure if it's just BJ's all around but when I go to BJ's I feel their service is not that great. This was my first time at the Pasadena location and the service was not that great. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday around 11:15am for a paint nite event at 12:30p. We were seated away from other diners, around the corner in the very far back corner. I'm not sure what was the reasoning behind them sitting us there but we happened to get seated right across the paint nite event and watched them set up.  Our server seemed unsure of herself. She gave off a vibe like she was confused or awkward. That made me feel awkward around her. I felt when she checked on us, she would watch from a distance and just stare at us. Then when she would finally come on over to check on us, she would linger too long or have a weird facial expression.  Anyways, when it came time to pay the bill, she devoted her attention to helping the paint nite people set up. Reminder, we were across the paint nite event I was trying to flag her down so she can take the check.  The food was meh. Surprisingly the food tasted better at other BJ's locations.  I say this visit was nothing special and I would probably come back here if an event or something was going on or a gathering of friends."
Matthew D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,7/8/2016,"The service was perfect when I ate there for the first time. Our server Ernesto was very kind and energetic. He kept the lemonade refills coming, and gave me plenty of sauce for the fries. His recommendation of bacon guacamole burger was great, and will be coming back for the same burger."
Bhushan J.,"Alhambra, CA",74,11,37,4.0,6/19/2016,Nice ambience (5/5) Food (3.5/5) Service (4/5) Pizza was good Pasta was not up to expect-ions  Ask for Dessert pairing Food can be improve.
L H.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,1,1.0,7/6/2016,"Not sure what happened to this place.  It used to be good about a year ago.  Now, service is slow.  Tables and seating are dirty.  And AGAIN, with the dirty silverware.  I used to come often for lunch but after this last visit, I cannot...  I had to request new silverware three times in one visit."
Chris R.,"Glendora, CA",313,23,4,5.0,11/8/2016,the manager shea makes the experience entirely worthwhile. willing to make the drive to this location due to his service and skills.
Veronica O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Poor service. Birthday party of 8- each food item was served at totally different times. Salads came out and before we even finished salad, one main entree came out. We told him to eat while warm, and he finished his entire plate before the next 3 items came out. Then another 3 items came out, leaving 1 member with no entree. Finally her steak came out and was burnt black and was entirely brown inside despite being ordered as medium well. The waiter kindly offered to bring her out a new meal. We waited another 10-15 minutes and nothing was brought out. We had all finished eating by this point. The waiter asked if she would like a salad or soup but at this point we asked for it to be wrapped up to go and comp'd. The waiter complied. Although the waiter was respectful, the timing of the food being served was absolutely ridiculous. Hard to enjoy a birthday celebration dinner when people don't get to eat together! Not coming back."
Jessica P.,"Castaic, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/10/2017,pizza didn't taste like actual bjs pizza at all. my boy friend was on his second slice and i noticed he had a hair coming from his pizza. disgusting.
Raphaella F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,37,48,4.0,12/7/2015,Great Space... Wonderful for Watching Games. Service is Good: At the Bar Ask for Brian the Bartender... I literally sent him to the kitchen on a special expedition and he came back with my special request. kudos Brian! Portions Are Small...
Courtney R.,"Alhambra, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/2/2017,"NO. just no. Have had a few bad experiences here, mainly with food and wait times. There never seems to be anyone around to help or alleviate your complaints. Last time, my pizza came out burnt and had to wait almost 40 min for the new one to come out. Everyone was done eating by the time I got mine. Female manager is not helpful at all. Take the time to go to a different location as there are wayyyy better ones than this one."
Pickles P.,"Fullerton, CA",0,16,1,4.0,11/17/2016,"Speaking of parking: if you park ay Paseo mall, BJs doesn't validate. However, per server Ashlee B's advice, we stopped into furniture store West Elm a few doors down toward mall. They obligingly stamped our parking ticket. Am sure dept stores or others in mall will do the same."
Les L.,"Pasadena, CA",1144,1117,1323,4.0,1/16/2014,"This new BJ's is set in a beautiful old bank building on the corner of Colorado and Marengo with ample parking at the Paseo Colorado.  It's like the best kept secret because unlike other BJs, this one is more under the radar and there aren't the massive wait times to get your pizookie.   I personally like their ""Enlightened Entrees"" offerings which are all under 575 calories.  My husband, in particular, turned me onto the Chicken ala fresca, which is marinated, grilled chicken breast that is served over rice pilaf with zucchini, mushrooms, peppers and tomatoes prepared ratatouille style, light Dijon tarragon jus, with a bit of arugula and balsamic vinaigrette.  It is a really flavorful dish and shockingly healthy.  I've gone with others and just don't like the food on the other side of BJ's spectrum, like the ridiculously disgusting chicken bacon ranch pizza, but probably could down more than my share of avocado egg rolls!"
Regina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",302,167,102,1.0,1/18/2015,"I am extremely disappointed with this place. Boyfriend and I arrived here after a long, long day (and a long drive) and we were starving for some food. I hadn't been to BJ's in awhile, so we decided on them. We came in at about 9:50pm on a Friday night--surprisingly, they were not that busy. We were immediately seated at a nice, comfy booth. Our server came a few minutes later, and took our order. So far, so good. Our house salads came out first. They were alright; nothing fancy or special--nothing I wouldn't be able to make by myself at home. However, given the fact I was starving, I was glad to have any kind of food in my stomach. We waited about five minutes for this to come out--a reasonable amount of time. Then, everything went downhill from there. We waited for our food for FIFTY MINUTES. FIFTY. FRIGGIN. MINUTES. No explanation was offered. Our server was nowhere to be found. No apologies were given until our food finally arrived--and it arrived right on cue, because we were ready to get up and leave. As a sort of lukewarm apology, BJ's offered us free dessert for making us wait the entire time. We ended up not taking the dessert because we don't eat dessert. I felt so bad for our server because our wait wasn't necessarily her fault; what I thought was completely unacceptable was the fact that NOT ONCE did we ever get an apology from the manager. He or she never came out to talk to us to make sure that we were okay. He or she never apologized for making us wait for nearly an hour. Meanwhile, the rest of the staff was standing around, talking to each other, and not tending to their tables. I even saw one girl texting. Omg. Texting? When the table you're in charge of is waiting for your service? -__- Brownie points, though, to the hostess, who saw that boyfriend and I were distressed and tried to find our server. Won't ever go back here. I'd rather go to Cheesecake. DIWOXHWOZIFUQJZLVP frustration."
Sam L.,"San Francisco, CA",623,342,773,4.0,11/15/2012,"Finally got to check out this place after hearing about its opening a few weeks ago. This is by far the fanciest looking BJ's since it used to be an old school bank back in the day. The interior designers did a fantastic job retaining the character of the original architecture.  Oh wait, this is a RESTAURANT....just came for the pizookie and had the white chocolate raspberry almond flavor and it was bomb! The service was prompt and attentive and regularly filled up our waters.  The only thing that really sucks is that there's no validated parking."
Brittany S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",6,42,19,1.0,1/8/2015,Came to have dinner with four people checked in at around 710 it's now 833 and we're still not eating anything! after waiting to place an order for our drinks she finally came to take the order after waiting for another 15 minutes of receiving the drinks we are now waiting for dinner been sitting here for about 47 minutes with no dinner then my lovely sister decided she had some snacks in her purse now that's what were eating I will post a picture so you guys will see horrible horrible horrible service. If you have all the time in the world this is the perfect place for you if not then you guys should just avoid it and go elsewhere.
Aaron B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2016,This restaurant treats its black customers poorly! Everyone else who isn't black will receive faster service even if you were seated an hour later! That was my experience today and it really hurt to see the frustration on my family's face while they watched a family of lighter  complexion get seated later and enjoy their meal before us! Pasadena bj's is disgustingly ignorant!
Jimmy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,5,1.0,12/16/2014,"take out left me on hold for 11 minutes, then came in to pick up order and zero workers at take out counter. FAIL."
Tom M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",42,2,,1.0,12/18/2015,"Long time customer of BJ'S in several cities.   Tonight is the first time I have had a complaint,  slow service,  poor food."
Dee V.,"Inglewood, CA",284,26,22,5.0,4/22/2016,"I had some of the Best Jambalaya I've tasted! The Calamari was tasty too! Good service and Good food! A bit pricey, but delicious! I also had a pizookie for desert too! Wide variety of choices on the menu."
