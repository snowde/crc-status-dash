Allen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",271,197,207,1.0,12/6/2013,I'm writing as I wait for the desert (taking forever). The waitress was really nice and apologized multiple times for their shortcomings. We waited more than 45min for the food to come out only to find one of the orders was wrong... The burger as well as the roast beef sandwich were extremely salty and did not taste well at all.  We called the manager and complained... He took the burger off the menu and said would send out the desert on the house... Waited another 20min for the desert but decided to leave since it never came. Parking is also not validated so expect to pay.  I'm sure this location will close in the near future and I won't be surprised.
Mike M.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,3,,1.0,8/9/2016,"This is the worst BJ's ever not only do they not validate for the parking garage that is located directly below the establishment, they are understaffed and are lacking CS do not let fanciness of this building fool you"
Debbie B.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",27,25,4,2.0,1/20/2015,"We have been to this location many times, and I was not happy with the food or service tonight despite the fact that the waiter was nice.  Not very busy yet service was slow.  My salad needed more dressing but the waiter only came by once.  The pizza had weird dark areas on it, and when I asked what it was, I was told they were burnt spots .  My son's cheeseburger came with no cheese, so I told a different waitress who brought the food, and she came back with two slices of American cheese on a plate .  Not sure how soon I'll want to come back.  Disappointed"
Gerard I.,"Pasadena, CA",501,806,351,5.0,9/9/2013,"Okay, so Sun-Thu, they have a late night happy hour that goes from 10pm until closing. BJ's brews go for $3.50 (depending on your bartender) - $4 and mixed drinks (Vodka tonics and stuff like that) also for $4. Appetizers start at $5.  I've partaken of some pints in the past couple of days. I could make it a weekly thing now that I know what I know."
Cynthie M.,"La Crescenta, CA",17,11,,2.0,7/5/2015,"Worst experience I've had in a restaurant in a long time. . I rarely complain about anything. Poor choice in seating us, 20 min before drink order came,  40 min before dinner came,  forgot our side salad which therefore came after dinner. No excuse as restaurant was 3/4 empty but hostess chose to seat us by large group who proceeded to stand up in aisle next to our table and socialize,  even blocking the waiters. We did complain, although manager never checked on us,  the waiter comped our side salad and provided a free dessert.. which ended up voiding the coupon we brought based on min $30 food order lol.  Recommended to husband because I've had good experience at 3 other BJs locations out of town.. we will never go back."
Katherine Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",288,17,97,1.0,11/15/2015,First time at BJ's and have to say worst experience ever! Sat down didn't get service for 15mins then when they finally came to ask for my drink they took 10mins. Not once did they ask if I was ready to order. When they finally came by they took forever! I even canceled my order and they still took forever Just to give me my bill.
Susan H.,"Alhambra, CA",0,58,4,2.0,4/27/2016,"Sooooo done.  This is a franchise that's seen it's day, but that was then & this is now & there's so many better places to spend my $!  Our family & friends have been fans & promoters for many years, but we've experienced a severe decline in efficiency of staff and quality of food. One nice manager was even empathetic enough to present us with a gift card after validating our series of issues.  Upon our return, our experience was even worse!!!  Don't need it when there's so much better around, especially in Pasadena."
C D.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,17,1,1.0,5/27/2016,"What a horrible experience I had a BJ's Pasadena on Tuesday. I brought a small group of 8 in for our 6:45 reservation and was greeted by Drake who was helpful and very nice....It was all down hill from there. Our server, was frankly horrible. During our time in the restaurant he failed to get orders correctly, failed to fix the orders when requested, failed to refill drinks...He just failed all around. For example when ordering wings we requested blue cheese and not ranch...he brought extra ranch and no blue cheese...twice!  My food, 1/2 rack of ribs, were burnt to a crisp. The sprouts...were also burnt and just awful. It was pointless to ask Our server to correct it as he rarely came around.All of this on what was a pretty slow night when we were there.  My group is returning to Pasadena next week and we will NOT be returning to BJ's."
Amy Y.,"San Diego, CA",607,459,631,4.0,10/8/2013,"The restaurant is gorgeous unlike any of the other BJs that I've been to, and I've been to quite a few.  Has the old vintage touch to it with the high ceilings and decor. Really worth it to check out.  I just discovered the clam chowder here- and they actually have CLAM in it!! SOOOO happy about this. :)  Customer service was really good, they got everything we needed and came to check on us on a regular basis.  I would definitely say this is the best BJ's I've been to. :)"
Maxine M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,4,,4.0,5/13/2016,The pazookis are amazing and the avocado egg rolls are to die for
Gail N.,"Bishop, CA",0,33,25,1.0,1/17/2015,"After waiting for our burgers for 40 minutes after ordering (not to mention our appetizers that were not delivered til way after our burgers) we had to send the one that was ordered ""well done"" back because I believe I actually heard it moo!!!  Then waited for another 30 minutes for the burger to return to the table. The waiter was super nice and apologetic but we asked to talk to the manager... She finally came and all she could say was sorry that she has a ""tiny"" problem in the kitchen.   Noticing that there were other tables having same problem.... She did comp 3 of the  burgers, the appetizers and 1ice tea.    Nice of her but we will never be back....."
Lisa M.,"Montebello, CA",1,6,,2.0,4/1/2016,"Ill start by saying the beer was the only thing keeping me calm. Server Judy absolutely sucks. Never bothered to wipe down our table or even asked to see if we were doing ok. We sat in the bar area, which was not busy, at all. She had less than 3 tables and was hardly around. Not sure if she had a bad day but we got a different impression when she focused on tables that had business people, which is unprofessional to say the least. Dont treat people like that, even if you are having a bad day."
James A.,"Glendora, CA",29,11,8,1.0,3/30/2016,"Bad experience today with my family. Our waiter Chad was hands down the worst waiter we have ever had in our restaurant dining experience. We had to wait over an hour just for an appetizer to come out. To top it off, we sat down a total of 1 hr 40 min and never once did he come to check if we needed water, see how are meals were or anything. He didn't bring us our food and didn't see if we wanted dessert which we would have gotten had he come but it got so late that we had to get back to put our baby down to sleep.  In general, I normally like BJs a lot so this was very disappointing to experience. The manager was great in understanding and gave us a nice discount off the bill. She would get five stars. And the food was pretty good too but it's a shame that one waiter can ruin the whole experience."
Brennan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,65,46,5.0,3/31/2015,"Stopped by for a quick drink and food from happy hour. Had a great experience. The food was excellent, we had the happy hour chicken lettuce wraps as well as the happy hour chicken pot stickers I highly recommend both of these options!  We paired it with a couple hefeweizens and I also ended up getting a glass of Pinot which was delicious as well. The staff was super friendly the atmosphere was perfect. I'm not going to lie this location is one of the more beautiful locations architecturally.  If you are in the Pasadena area and looking for some great food and service then I would definitely recommend coming here!  Food- 5 Stars Service- 5 Stars Drinks- 5 Stars Atmosphere- 5 Stars  Also a quick recommendation. If you can try to find street parking because the parking lot unfortunately doesn't validate parking but it's worth the short walk in the beautiful city of Pasadena."
Minah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,3,1,1.0,1/10/2016,"Incredibly slow. EVERYTIME we come here the service is horrible. Parties, larger parties whom have arrived after us were served before us. The manager was not even accommodating or remorseful about the poor service we received."
Jerry M.,"Tustin, CA",3426,803,614,4.0,3/5/2015,"Came back to BJ's a second time at the invitation of the manager. Started with the ahi poke, a garden salad and an excellent cherry chipoltle salmon. My wife had a vegi pizza and finished with the ubiquitous pazuki. All in all a very good meal. The service was also quite good. I love the decor of this BJ's and i have a soft spot for their red ale. Recommend."
Melanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",306,946,1535,3.0,2/7/2014,"This is a newer BJ's - it's a casual place for food and drinks.  Nothing really special food wise but portions are large and filling.  They make a handful of brews, light and dark.  For those who prefer cider and things on the sweeter side, their berry cider is delicious!  Happy hour is ok .  Overall, prices are reasonable.  Even tho the space is beautiful, it somehow feels like a touristy place and I prefer the Glendale location . parking - metered or free residential street parking"
Kyle A.,"West Fargo, ND",6,55,11,5.0,3/25/2016,"Had dinner here our first night while in town for a conference.  Easily the best place we chose near the convention center.  Sirloin was excellent, and really liked the fries.  We also had the Pizzookie for dessert, which was pretty darn tasty."
Kelly M.,"La Puente, CA",1,2,,1.0,4/12/2016,"Service here is absolutely horrible. I've been here twice now, after my first visit here I thought I'd give it another try. Thinking maybe it would get better but no. I'm never going back here again. It hurts because I love BJ's but I'd rather drive further out for a more pleasant dinner. I don't recommend this location at all."
Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,31,50,5.0,9/8/2013,Pretty good looking BJs if u ask me ... Came here yesterday after the boiling crab ... Talk about fat!!! We wanted something sweet so why not come here ... Came here with my family ( 4 of us) order the family size pizookie and holy moly it was HUGE and super good ... Mission accomplished we ate it all.  Thank you BJs and thank you Francisco for the great service!!!
