Q. M.,"Chicago, IL",11,99,109,4.0,3/5/2015,"Came here to meet friends for dinner. I arrived at 6:30PM-ish on a thur night. We opted to sit at one of the bar tables so we sat ourselves at a booth. I had a Stella and my friends had some kind of amber ale...we both enjoyed our drafts. I ordered a small vegetarian pizza while my friends both had salads....one of which was the enlightened category and the other was more of a main dish. My friend who had an enlightened salad asked for his dressing on the side but he never received it and when it was brought to the waitresses attention, he had already consumed more than half (about 15 min), so she asked if he still wanted it. He said no and just finished it without dressing.  No other problems...we talked a lot since we hadn't seen each other in months and had a lot to catch up on.  They DO NOT validate parking...just an fyi. I didn't park in the garage (i lucked out with street) but my friends did and were surprised to see they don't validate. I've been here twice before this...both for just pick up and BOTH times were a hassle. One time I had to wait an extra 45 minutes after my designated pick up time! I didn't have yelp back then but now I do...just be aware that evening pick ups can be screwed up (the other time, I was missing an item).  I love the mini deep dish pizza so I will be back but it's down to 1x every 6 months now."
Paul M.,"Pasadena, CA",1582,474,27,4.0,8/30/2014,"You think you know BJ's? Did you know the CEO of BJ's lives in Pasadena? So what? SO WHAT, YOU DARE ASK?! So it means that the owner decided to make this the most gorgeous BJ's ever.   The fucking crown jewel of BJ's.  A BJs that would be so gorgeous that if actually offered a BJ, you'd just say ""No, I'm good, thanks.""  A false ceiling uncovered during renovation that had the ORIGINAL 1900's Trompe-l'œil friezes and cartouches on the ceiling from when it was the Pacific Southwest Trust and Savings.  The gorgeous chandeliers?   Replicas of those that once hung majestically in the bank.  That double eagle coat of arms over the doorway?  Yes, serf, that belonged to House Romanov.  What does that have to do with a bank? I have no idea, but it's pretty neat nonetheless. The house beers are actually pretty good for a chain brewery.  The IPA was a bit too floral and had an almost soapy aftertaste, but the Irish Red was super good.  There are plenty of non-BJ beers on tap as well, and a full bar, of course. But really, if this place were downtown and not called BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, the hipsters would be packed ten layers deep because of the beautiful interior design.  Then again, maybe it could remain a BJ's and it can be a new ironic hipster hangout!"
Irene B.,"Pasadena, CA",21,94,218,1.0,9/13/2014,"Horrible horrible horrible service!  Got the lunch special and a root beer. Salad came out first. After waiting around I had to ask 2 different waiters to get my waitress because I was thirsty with nothing to drink. When she finally came with my food it was cold! It had been 1hour already she was awful! I've never experienced such horrible customer service! Left the restaurant hungry and thirsty! Manager said ""next time I come in he'll take care of me"" why the fuck would I go back in there and waste my time! Never going there again!!!! Worst Bj restaurant!"
c m.,"Bell, CA",4,16,5,1.0,10/3/2015,Service is horrible!! Worst part is that I'm not the first to complain on yelp about their service!! Hello management!! Train your people!! Needless to say that we will not be coming back to this Bj's restaurant!
Alexandria M.,"El Monte, CA",65,25,35,5.0,2/22/2015,"Came here for a little Sunday Funday and the service was amazing! Had the Harvest Hefeweizen and their black and blue-house burger. Everything tasted really good. Our server Carla made the experience more wild! ""In a good way"" ;)"
Sevan K.,"Glendale, CA",11,6,14,1.0,9/18/2015,"4 star for Good food ,0 star for really bad  service. No fork and knife on the table, waitress/waitresses they dont care about costomers. Glendale location is the best comper to here."
Demetrius L.,"Montclair, CA",21,22,6,1.0,9/19/2015,Just an update: I tried contacting the customer service manager who left a comment on my post and I was never contacted back. Nothing more than BJS trying to pull the wool over your eyes. It was really bad service and this location is apparently known for it. Don't go here. Don't waste your time or money
David G.,"Los Angeles, CA",356,6,3,2.0,3/16/2015,"Jessica the bartender in the bar area is rude and hates her job (she's pretty obvious about it too). Gave snappy attitude and was bothered when I asked questions. I think any other bartender or server would be more suffice.  What's shame, used to be my favorite hangout spot after work."
Lauren W.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",17,92,26,4.0,2/5/2015,"I haven't been to this BJs for lunch or dinner but walked in wanting pizza for breakfast only to find out that they serve actual breakfast! We were really happy with our breakfast pizza, delicious and perfect to split. The side of fruit seemed like a waste of money but that's to be expected at a place that isn't meant to be healthy.  Service was attentive. Decor was beautiful! I'm willing to go back and check out their regular service"
Caroline T.,"Pasadena, CA",148,42,8,2.0,9/12/2014,"Service is pretty bunk here...waiter brought my salad with no plates or utensils, waited about 10 min to get someone to bring me one place setting (there's 5 of us), our pizza and appetizer comes, still no plates or utensils, finally another waiter, Brian comes and brings us everything we need.  Probably our last time at this location....oh and the ranch tastes like bottled ranch...not like the good ranch at the brea and Monrovia location..."
Sarah H.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",17,47,39,4.0,9/8/2014,"I guess I have been really lucky all 4 or 5 times I've been here. This is an old bank building and it's absolutely stunning inside. It's nice to have a casual restaurant in such an upscale building.  I have need waited for a seat and have been here for to watch various sports numerous times. I've only been in the actual dining area once, I usually sit in the bar area to see all the glorious TVs.  I've had a couple different food items and they've all been very good. I'm a big fan of the soup and salad lunch deal they offer, and I often get the tortilla soup and cypress salad. They are unlimited and only $7 until 3pm. Can't beat it!  My mom and I shared the enLIGHTened turkey ham and bacon sandwich the other day and it was amazing for being on the healthy menu. It did take a little while to come out, but we weren't rushing anyway.  They don't validate parking, but it's very easy to walk over to paseo and get your validation.  I've always had friendly servers here who are good about checking on us and bringing us anything we need. I'm not sure about other visitors, but I haven't had a problem. And I don't have low standards either."
Jennifer B.,"Moorpark, CA",3,5,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Poor service... Took 30 mins to get our drinks, 50 mins to get our food. Waiter forgot an entree...  Manager didn't check on us... Terrible dining experience!!!"
Inna C.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,33,20,2.0,7/31/2014,"Sad to say that this is the worst BJ's we have ever been to. The only reason why it's getting two stars is because the architecture is beautiful inside. But when it comes to the food...oh man. The foodie part of my heart breaks.  After being distracted by the cool-looking ceiling, my husband and I decide to order the calamari for an appetizer. For the main course, he orders the black and blue burger and I order the Cajun shrimp pasta. The calamari came pretty quick, but once you take a bite you realize why: they probably grabbed the last batch that was at the bottom of the frozen bag of calamari and then they popped it in the microwave. That is pretty much how it tasted. I was starving so I didn't really care, but my husband was disappointed that there wasn't really a crunch to those little critters. Our server offered to take it back, but I refused because I thought it was ok enough to eat...and maybe part of me didn't want spit in my next entrée.  The burger and the pasta came. First look at my pasta and I thought, ""wow. They doused a lot of the sauce on it."" I took a bite and the pasta reminded me of those times when I would be boiling pasta myself and I would taste-test it to see if it was ready but it wasn't so I would let it boil for a little longer. Well...the cook didn't seem to let it boil for a little longer and ended up serving me with undercooked pasta. The bread was good so I munched on that. The shrimp was ok, too. When my husband saw how little I ate, he tasted some of my pasta to see how undercooked it was and he agreed. He told our server and our server went to ask her manager if she could have it taken off our tab. We were glad they did because that would be very upsetting if we paid for undercooked pasta that I took two bites out of.  So...to finish up this very sad tale of our dinner at BJ's: we will not come back to this one again. Too bad...so sad."
Ermilo A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,4,1.0,7/27/2014,"Really!! The worse BJs I have ever been. They don't even offer parking for their guests, when I asked for validation for my parking ticket the front desk attendance guys said they are not part of the mall parking program. Bad service and not the same service from BJs"
Amador V.,"Perth, Australia",2,7,16,1.0,10/10/2015,I get an email to come and watch the soccer match between USA and Mexico ... I get here and they tell me I cannot get sound... What kind of offer is that? No sound because the manager made that choice?i ordered 3 appetizers for my our party ... They are cold! Poor service on a Saturday night and for a new location is not fun!
Laura S.,"Pasadena, CA",948,1507,6131,4.0,11/20/2012,"FOOD: Went there for lunch and got the soup bowl and OMG... it's tiny. And it's $6. Whaaa... it was SO tiny. I finished it in three bites. I was really disappointed in the quantity for the price. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it was good but SO little. If I were there longer, I'd pay $2 more for the unlimited soup... but still... not worth $6 for such a small bowl. SERVICE: I went with a regular of theirs. So they were great to us. Excellent service. AMBIANCE: Nice, fresh new store. It's HUGE and clean.  PARKING: Street or public lots or Paseo OVERALL: Great for big groups Going to try the Happy Hour soon Overall... don't get the soup/"
Victoria V.,"Seaside, CA",18,118,47,1.0,7/13/2015,I love the gluten free pizzooki and I came in just for that. My server was so rude and normally I'd think he was having a bad night but he was very nice to the other tables. I was very disappointed in him and his service. I left a note to tell him how disappointed I was.
Patty And Sergio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,364,5,5.0,5/31/2015,"This evening may 31st. we had a party of ten, for a Sunday it was not busy, we were greeted & seated our waiter, (young man curly hair maybe Latin) I didn't get his name but he was wonderful to our party we took down our orders and made sure to check up on our table quite often which is great because there's always someone who needs something.  The place was very quiet which was awesome! We were sat towards the back by the exits and that's great because we had a little privacy.  Thank you for the good service, we will priorities this location"
Kate T.,"Walnut, CA",4,100,1,2.0,12/14/2014,Food was not bad. Price was ok. Service was depend on the waitstaffs. I guess I went in the wrong day and time. The waiter disappeared about 30 minutes then food was taking forever and nobody came and said anything. I don't really give two stars but I was disappointed.
Danielle R.,"Pasadena, CA",253,2,,1.0,7/31/2016,"Absolutely no customer service Last night my 10 year old son finally got me out of the house after a long work week to take him to his favorite restaurant BJ'S. However, we were so disappointed once we got there, that there was no host to greet us for a while. Then finally when we were seated we waited 20 mins at the table before realizing no one was coming to help us.  We looked around for help but one came to our table to greet us, to get us drinks, or tell us they'd be helping us soon. It probably wouldn't have been so bad if we weren't sitting directly behind the servers station and three servers were back and forth the entire time, standing talking, and assisting all the tables around us. Once my son told me that this was the worse experience he's ever had at BJ'S, I asked him if he wanted to leave. So we left to Blaze Pizza without ever being helped. You lost a loyal customer due to poor service as I doubt he'll ever want to go back!"
