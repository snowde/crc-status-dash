Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,156,,2.0,9/12/2014,"I live pretty much right between this BJ's and the BJ's in Arcadia. After a pretty good experience in Arcadia (their 3 1/2 star average is about right), my girlfriend and I tried this one last night. Unfortunately, I have to echo what several other reviews have said: While the building is beautiful, the service isn't great, and the food is mediocre. The server mixed up my girlfriend's drink, and had to ask for confirmation a minute or two after trying to memorize my order. As for the food, I ordered pizza after being pleasantly surprised in Arcadia. This pie, though (a small deep dish pepperoni pizza), was seriously lacking in sauce. It tasted very bland, and I wound up pretty disappointed. If you're craving BJ's, trust me, go to Arcadia, not this one. It looks great, but the negative reviews are accurate."
Matt V.,"Temecula, CA",21,502,32,5.0,9/11/2013,"I'm rounding up my 4 star review because 1) I had a meal I would never have expected at a BJ's and 2) because the vibe was just right. I usually go for deep dish pizza love and beer but since I have to ""take 'er easy"" on the restaurant choices I got the Moroccan spiced Salmon! WOW !! Sooo good! Already love Salmon but this was above and beyond what I would expect to eat at a brew pub pizza sports joint. Also, our waitress was great. The wife ate the porkchops and she was diggin' it and offered me a forkful to sample. Again, a nice surprise. You know something is really good when my wife refused to take the second pork chop home and HAD TO EAT IT at the restaurant. (This is a woman who ALWAYS takes half her dinner home in a box!)"
Rafael H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/4/2017,It was my first time dining at a BJ's restaurant. The place looks really nice inside with chandeliers and there's a gigantic tv at the bar. Upon arrival we were told it was a 5 minute wait which isn't so bad considering it was a Friday night. We were seated rather quickly and ordered our drinks and appetizer. One of the drinks they forgot about and was brought water instead until I brought it to the waiters attention. After that the appetizer took a good 30-40 minutes to come out and we still had to wait another 10 before the waiter took our actual order. Then our waiter eventually went MIA on us and we had 2 or 3 different ones attend us for the remainder of the night. To top it off me and my girlfriend both got really bad stomachaches about halfway through our meal. Don't know if they were understaffed on chefs that day or if this place is just unorganized but I won't be coming back for a good while.
Natalie E.,"Glendale, CA",119,151,516,3.0,9/3/2013,"I am generally not a huge fan of this place however it is very close to my work...lunch time we usually end up here because co workers wants to go.  I usually opt out for the healthier restaurants, therefore i was happy when they had a salad on their menu i LOVED....it was a delicious and light spinach and berry salad that was discontinued as of September 1st...BRING THIS BACK!"
Athena J.,"San Gabriel, CA",30,11,3,4.0,2/8/2015,"Enjoy the atmosphere of this place. Next to lots of entertainment and shops. Happy hour is great! They also have gluten free beer! Score!  Friends and I go to brunch there on Sunday's. Only thing is that they mess your order up often, specially for brunch. But they are very nice and accommodating for substitutions.   ***Wish they had a bigger variety for people with allergies such as gluten and soy though."
Rob A.,"Granada Hills, CA",5,15,,1.0,2/11/2016,"Terrible, terrible food. Steak was tough as can be, appetizer platter was a joke, artichoke dip came out with literally 8 pieces of chips,  my wifes Ahi Tuna stunk. I asked for water with lemon and of course I only got water, it took 15 minutes to get her to come back with lemon. Shaun the manager was very sincere with his disappointed. I have never experienced such a disaster with all portions. To top it off, the bathroom stall had no toilet paper or seat cover.. As I said, Shaun the manager seemed equally upset."
Analaura G.,"Altadena, CA",4,12,11,4.0,3/10/2015,First time in this BJ's location. I personally enjoyed my bartenders Alicia and David. I came in and Alicia introduced herself right away and was able to give me some recommendations . David made me a delicious strawberry mojito. He is a very outgoing gentlemen which I hope to soon see again due to the great energy he carries in his personality.
Kelly R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,72,4,4.0,3/26/2015,Service has improved.  Kitchen continues to turn out consistently good plates. Glad they are in our neighborhood.
Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",446,2659,990,4.0,12/8/2012,"recently opened and one of the better BJ's experiences. This building used to be a bank and it is gorgeous. The serving staff was very accommodating to large groups that came in while we were there, ensuring they were happy with their seating (ended up moving because of the sun). The food was decent enough. Lots of screens to watch sports games and plenty of parking.   Ended up getting the marsala dish and other various lunch combos within the group. We weren't pressured to hurry up, eat and leave which was a nice change from other BJs."
Ross V.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,118,63,4.0,9/18/2013,"Enjoyed lunch here. The inside of this BJs is really cool. Open ceilings with no walls. It was a former bank of course. My meal was excellent. Clocking in at almost 1,700 calories.... I had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with thin fries and coleslaw. My mom had the mahi mahi. It was around 30 bucks for the two of us. Minus one star for the parking!!! Actually this is not Bj's fault ... but they DON'T offer validation for the garage underground.  After your meal you have to walk back INTO paseo mall and get it validated at the top of the escalators!!! A pain with a 1,700 calorie baby in my tummy lol Enjoy"
Praline R.,"Monrovia, CA",3,26,1,1.0,6/9/2015,The worst. Took over 30 minutes to be seated on a night that was dead another 30-40 for our food & rack on another 15 for them to bring us silverware? Never going here again.
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",450,205,22,4.0,1/5/2013,"I think the whole BJ's brand is always great.  Once again, friendly staff, fun ambience, plenty to watch (on tv and people watching), love that they list their calories on the menu.  It was 8pm on a Saturday and there was only a 10-15 minute wait for a table which wasn't bad, but to our surprise instead of waiting, we found a table in the bar area.  I'm not giving 5 stars for two reasons that are kind of beyond their control:  1. The parking sucks (we found ourselves taking an elevator up into an abandoned alley behind the restaurant which is a little scary for women at night) and 2. it's a little cold in there esp with the door flying open every two seconds so sometimes the bar area isn't always a plus. I had the ""Enlightened"" mediterranean pasta and my friend had the mini pepperoni pizza, both delicious!  Can never get disappointed with this franchise!"
Beau F.,"Austin, TX",0,43,5,5.0,9/7/2015,This was going to a 1 start review but the waitress was a perfect professional in resolving issues.  Thanks Ariana B!
Candice A.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,43,,1.0,6/4/2016,Ate here for lunch and I had the shrimp tacos and a side of fries. That was all pretty decent. However when the bill came I started feeling a little tummy sick. That only got worse. Within 30 min I was rushing to the bathroom. I truly believe one of the staff put exlax in my food. I'm still in pain. Will not be coming back!
Derek W.,"Los Angeles, CA",467,633,2477,4.0,12/1/2012,"3.5 stars ... Friend wanted to watch the UCLA/Stanford game here last night and was a bit reluctant to go.  Arrived slightly before kickoff and was in an empty section off to the side.  Was nice of them to allow me to pick the booth of my choice which was directly in front of a tv.  It wasn't long before the section filled up... Started off with a beer and waited for the rest to arrive.  Quickly finished the first pint and ordered a second as my friend was arriving. Ordered a few appetizers to start...stuffed mushrooms which were good and came out hot.  Avocado rolls...tasty and again were hot.  Buffalo wings were brought out dry and served with both ranch and the buffalo sauces on the side...a little weird but ok.  We quickly mowed through those and then ordered the nachos.  Though the cheese looked like it was melted, we found that the chili on the bottom to be cold.  Even the sour cream was so cold that it was icy!  The manager quickly rectified the issue and brought out another order which was awesome! Since UCLA lost that night, decided to drown my sorrows in a berry crumble.  I've had this at the Montebello location and thought that it was pretty good however, the crumble topping was actually salty and not sweet.  I normally would've complained but felt that since I had already complained about the nachos that I didn't want to risk them spitting in my food.  That was the only complaint that I had ... guess the chef was a little heavy on the dash of salt to enhance the taste of the berries.   Still new and definitely have improved since my last visit....hope they continue to improve as time goes by."
Kassandra C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/13/2015,"Worst service I ever had. The restaurant wasn't even busy. I went in with 3 of my friends and we had to wait 25 minutes for our drink order to be taken and then another 30 minutes to get our order taken down. We kept flagging down our waitress and she would always say ""I'll be with you in a minute."" Once our order was taken, it took 50 minutes for our food to be brought. If it wasn't because my friend was dead set on trying it I would've just crossed the street to subway and grabbed a sandwich."
Breyandramarie R.,"Rosemead, CA",10,13,14,5.0,11/21/2015,"Always go here with friends and family, i also have a few friends that work at the restaurant. Great experience every time i go. I also come alone sometimes to just sit relax, and to enjoy a beer while watching whatever games are on."
Lexie C.,"Pasadena, CA",63,72,66,5.0,6/18/2015,"we had Wendy z. has our server and she was as nice as can be!  we really enjoyed her service, along with her nice smile!  our chicken tortilla soup came out cold and she made sure the soup was hot the next time around.  I had a salmon ceaser for entree and it was so yummy!  I had a $10 off $35 promotion and it was well worth it! I will be back!"
Jwan G.,"Hawthorne, CA",3,3,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Worst bj's I have ever been to, the waiter dropped a water cup on one of my guest. I thought things would get better after the manager spoke to use and asked us what desert we wanted and what was my guest eating. It went down hill from there . They did not give us forks or napkins to eat our food. We barley received water and refills on our drinks. To top it off my guest ended up paying for his food and desert after they left him wet and embarrassed making him look like his peed his pants because of the clumsy waiter . Maybe because we were all Hispanic and looked a little Ruff because we had just played a soccer match down the street at Pasadena adult soccer league!!!Worst customer service ever !!!!! Save your money and go to Yard house!!"
Ron L.,"Covina, CA",4989,1343,5039,4.0,3/27/2014,"This place is cool.  We just left the theater after seeing a movie and the whole group of us were anxious to see this place.  For some reason the BJ's (ex-Bank) wasn't really packed which was great.  Love the interior design of this place and so stylish for a BJ's and they have a lot of screens to watch your favorite sports. Gosh, four large screens over the bar area alone..all on different channels.     We had a excellent waitress that kept the drinks rolling and appetizers.  I wasn't really hungry because I ate a lot of popcorn at the theater, but my friend's mahi mahi was delicious.  Yes, I did nibble on her fish...      Really, I felt the only downside to the evening is that they don't validate...but this is a place worth coming back to. Drinks:  Odules.... cause I don't drink..."
