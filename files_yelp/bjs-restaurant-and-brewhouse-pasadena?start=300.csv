Brittany A.,"San Gabriel, CA",107,21,12,5.0,10/18/2015,"My friend had her birthday dinner here last night and we were a party of 15. While there was a miscommunication with the reservations they were able to quickly accommodate us to a table. The restaurant assigned us one server and of course with such a huge party there were mishaps. What made it such a great experience was our server ryan. Always had a smile on his face and tried his absolute best to stay on top of things. Thank you ryan, I know it can't be easy but we really appreciated you!"
Meet T.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,22,12,5.0,12/31/2015,They made veg burger for me which is delicious and the amazing desert which is masterpiece
Cheryl R.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,223,52,4.0,10/29/2012,"Just left the restaurant...came here on opening night!  Place was still buzzing at 7:30.  They have a bunch of flat screen tv's and were showing the MNF game so that was cool.  The staff greeted us right when we stepped in...like 4 of them.  All evening we were well taken care of.  There were a lot of trainees walking around with servers- ours was no exception.  It was actually quite adorable watching the trainee taking copious notes about our order :-)  Our server was great and very attentive. The ambiance awesome, as they converted an old bank into the restaurant, but kept a lot of the architecture.  Love the ceiling and the chandeliers!  Of course since it was opening night, everything (tables, booths, chairs, walls, etc) were new and shiny and nice.  They'll get worn over time, but it was fun seeing everything so pristine and new! My husband and I ordered gluten free pizza, regular pizza, and a gluten free pizookie...and they all were delish! On our way out, we were thanked by 7 different people on our walk out...that was cool!  We'll be back for sure...maybe to watch another sports game or something or try their happy hour! ***TIP: On a busy night, you should call about 30min-1hr ahead of the time you plan on getting there to get your name added to the 'call ahead list'.  This will shorten your wait time! ***Not sure who Charity talked to, but when I called, I was told that they did NOT validate parking since they're not part of the Paseo.  I was told to go to Gelsen's to validate.  So not really sure about parking at the moment."
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/7/2016,Delicious food and great service. Our waitress Shana was very helpful; especially in regards to my severe allergy!
Henry V.,"Rosemead, CA",47,28,,4.0,12/14/2016,"Came here for lunch a while ago with a coworker because they had a BOGO deal. Walked in and wasn't greeted immediately, but when we were greeted, we were immediately seated which was cool. Hostess was friendly and made small talk with us. Got seated in a booth and looked at the menu. I decided to go with the Deep Dish Baked Ziti while my coworker ordered the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs. We received our order fairly quickly. When the Deep Dish Baked Ziti was brought out, it looked small, didn't look like something I would pay full price for, but that's just me. Once I tried some of the Ziti, it made my disappointed face turn into a big smiley face. Probably one of the best pasta dishes at BJ's hands down. Flavors were on point, didn't taste too cheesy and the sausages really complemented the pasta well. The Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs was nothing special. The bread that this dishes came with was really impossible to split in half by cutting, but when you took a bite into it with some of the pasta, it tasted good. Service was good. Checked out their large flat screen TV which was pretty cool. Overall, would recommend coming here and getting the Deep Dish Baked Ziti if you got the BOGO coupon. I usually come to BJ's for their burgers, but I heard their lunch specials are pretty good too. I think next time they have their BOGO, I'm going all in with the Full Rack Ribs."
Ash M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,45,,1.0,11/12/2015,"DO NOT BRING YOUR GROUP HERE. We made a reservation over a *week* in advance for a group of 20, and the restaurant knew we were planning to attend an 8 PM event down the block. We saw our waiter 3 times - to order a drink, to order food, to pay the bill. If you wanted a second drink, a condiment, etc., no one could be found. The things we did manage to order came out in chunks at drastically different times. Drinks took over 15 minutes, with the exception of a margarita that took 25. Half of our group finished eating before the other half even received their food. One diner never received his order at all and had to cobble together a meal from his friends' plates. Management was alerted to all these problems but did nothing to solve them or make up for how awkward and unsatisfying our meal was. I have eaten here before with groups of three or four people; those experiences have been average. Based on how ineptly this event was handled, we won't be going back to BJ's. Also: BJ's, you are located in Paseo Colorado. Stop being so stingy and validate the bloody parking."
Shelly A.,"Pasadena, CA",15,41,346,1.0,3/23/2016,"This is the worse Bj's I've ever been too!!! The customer service was horrible and careless. I took my girlfriend and my girlfriends mom here to have a nice dinner but it ended up being a nightmare! Our waiter just kept ignoring us like we weren't even there, his name was Nicholas. Very unprofessional, rude and mindless. He took forever to come to our table to take our order, give us a to go box and give out our check. One of the kitchen staff brought us our order because our waiter took forever!! By the way we waited almost an hour for our food and 40 minutes for the pazooki! Wish I can give the customer service 0 stars. I'd like to add that the food didn't taste like all the other Bj's I ate at in NorCal and SoCal. I ordered the Parmesan Chicken, Jambalaya, Salmon and a pazooki . Parmesan was burnt in the bottom, the Jambalaya was over seasoned and oily, the salmon was super dry and the pazooki was undercooked AS IN THE cookie wasn't cooked very liquidy. WORST SERVICE EVER! Never coming back to this Bj's location."
Nick T.,"Glendale, CA",136,310,116,4.0,1/17/2013,"Upon entering, you are greeted by an open area with 40 foot ceilings and a architectural masterpiece of what old Pasadena stands for. It sort of reminds me of a 100 year old train station which is really awesome seeing that I love old world architecture.  As far as their food, I ordered take-out and the pickup was smooth as they had an area dedicated for takeout orders. As with any BJ, the food is not extraordinary but serves its purpose.  As far as their prices, they are reasonable I would say, whereas, dinner for two will run you around $30.  To my fellow yelpers, make sure you go and see their architecture because it is truly riveting."
Noodle F.,"Pasadena, CA",0,22,23,1.0,6/28/2016,"We come here regularly even though bjs Arcadia location is near from where we come from. However after the experience we had tonight, we will never come to Pasadena bjs anymore or until they replace a competent manager and staff. Came after little before 10pm thus not many customers at the time. We get sit right away and waiter CHARD  V gets our drink orders as usual. Took 20 min for our drinks to come and waiter Chard didn't even get our food order and disappeared. Waited about another 20 min and we had to call another waiter in order to get our waiter. Got our food order and food comes late after another 20min. Didn't get all our food and our kids meals get to be last. Forget about the food being late but let's think about customer service... This waiter Chard didn't even once apologize us for being late and never bother to check our food status and even tried to defend himself saying food didn't take that long... Manager comes dressed as casual with no uniform and just give a simple apology to our party... If BJs marketing staff is reading this please take care of your employees if you want have customers coming to your place, very pathetic and disrespectful to your customers!! Next time we will rather go to Yard house for the happy hour starting from 10pm to close."
Vickie C.,"South Pasadena, CA",315,638,304,2.0,2/19/2013,"I'm not sure if this BJ's is subpar due to being new or if they are just not good. I came here on a Sunday for lunch with my family and the place was pretty empty. The interior of the building is gorgeous with the high ceilings and ornate details.  We ordered appetizers and pizza to share. The appetizers were pretty good. But the deep dish pizza was terrible. It came out cold and the dough was soggy and felt a bit undercooked. At other BJ's, the pizza is served in the pan. For some reason, this one was served on a plate. I don't know what's wrong with their pizza chef, but he needs to fix this recipe quick!  Service was great until the very end. Throughout the meal, she came to check up on us quite frequently. But at the end when we needed some to-go boxes and the check, she was no where to be found. It took a while for us to even flag her down as she went MIA.  Overall, this would be a great place to grab drinks and food as you watch sports game if they improve on the taste of the food.  Parking: This place has no parking. If you park at Paseo, you need to remember to get validation from Gelson's or Macy's for 90 mins free. The Gelson's validation is self-validation. The machine is right by the front entrance of the market. If not, be prepared to pay $$."
Kevin J.,"Mira Loma, CA",27,262,1051,5.0,5/21/2014,Came back again and the service wasn't as great but still was good. But the food was still amazing. I can't get over how good the happy hour is  it ends at 7. Most items are 4 or 5 or 6 bucks. Again the Flatbread California pizza is DELICIOUS $! THIS time we got the pazookie. Ahhhhh so darn goooddddd! !!  Please get get it if you never tried it  it's amazing. I love the happy hour here.one of the best happy hours in old town.
Dave G.,"Covina, CA",30,10,,2.0,5/26/2015,"Horrible service, just had a late lunch (1pm), the serving staff was horrendous, slow and forgetful, asked for parmesan cheese, never got it from the waitress, I had to go near the bar area to ask another server for it."
Will W.,"Los Angeles, CA",336,444,3,3.0,4/29/2014,"Beautiful location, this is no doubt the best looking Bj's brewhouse out there. The food is decent, and they're famous for their pizookie dessert, which is actually pretty tasty.  This place would be great to watch sports they have a monster TV screen in back of the bar. Unfortunately, I do not like the beers at Bj's. They all have a watery finish at the end, which is mucho disappointing for a ""brewhouse"". Doesn't matter if it's a pale ale, a stout, or an IPA, it's gonna have a watery finish. Come for the ambiance or come for the food, but not for their beer."
Cullum D.,"City of Industry, CA",160,5,,1.0,5/23/2015,"This place blows. The salad sucked. The soup was cold. The pasta had zero flavor. And on top of that I asked for no chicken on my pasta which, at a different BJ's, was priced a few dollars cheaper and here it was still 14.95$ there's your tip"
Jorge A.,"Pasadena, CA",67,44,61,2.0,3/4/2014,Do not go on a Tuesday night when they have a beer tasting class. Your waiter will ignore you to serve sample beers to the class. I had to walk to the service bar to get my Sierra Mist refill.   My roast beef dip sandwhich  was cold and I didn't feel like sending it back for obvious reasons.
Stephanie P.,"Pasadena, CA",34,9,1,2.0,6/15/2015,Food and drink ok. Not sure about work ethic. Very slow. Hostess eating and drinking at hostess stand. Classy place!! LOL
Paula M.,"Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, CA",36,90,22,1.0,3/18/2015,"1 star because I was gouged $9 for parking 2.5 hrs.  I was told BJ's is the only business there that doesn't validate.  Almost doubles the price of my meal.  The food was average and a good server would have refilled our drinks without having to flag him down.  Aesthetically, it's very nice inside, ala Cheesecake Factory."
Tom G.,"Fontana, CA",0,39,30,4.0,10/1/2015,"Very beautiful setting. The food was very good & cooked well. The server was very nice & attentive. The bar was incredible. Very clean, but the bench seat I was sitting on needed repair. Other than that it was a pleasant experience."
David N.,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA",28,122,38,4.0,7/7/2015,"I came here today with a big group from my summer program. The service was odd, with my 24 size group, we had all you can eat pizza and salad with sides being seperate charge per plate. The pizza was subpar, but the Caesar chicken salad was very good. The drinks stayed full, but again the one star was lost due to the chewy pizza."
Diana G.,"Alhambra, CA",26,1,1,1.0,12/31/2015,"Party of 15 on a Tuesday afternoon about 3:30pm Service was really bad, waiter forgot appetizer, forgot side dish to child's plate, burnt brussels sprouts, entire order took way too long to arrive. 3 people in our party got up and left because of their plates took way to long. We walked out of the restaurant at 5:40pm that will tell you how long we waited. Management lacks professionalism  Better service at Yard House"
