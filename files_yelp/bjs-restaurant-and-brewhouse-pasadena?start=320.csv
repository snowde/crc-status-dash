Aaron Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,9,,1.0,5/3/2015,"The worst location we have been to. Rarely saw our waiter. We waited almost a half hour to be served. Drink service (refills) was poor. Our food was cold upon arriving and had to be re-heated. Upon completing our dinner, we waited twenty minutes for the waiter to return so we could ask for the check. We then waited an additional twenty minutes for it to be brought to us. Needless to say, we left no tip. We found out afterward that the server charged my brother-in-law's card three times."
Johnny F.,"Alhambra, CA",2,9,1,1.0,3/12/2016,"We got here at 12:40pm party of 4, it took them 1 hour to get our food. Horrible Horrible. Will never come back to BJs in Pasadena."
B. G.,"San Gabriel, CA",11,9,15,1.0,4/22/2015,Today was the worst experience I've ever had at any of the BJ's Restaurants. I was there with a larger group and the waiter seemed to be in a tail spin. He delivered my salad to the wrong table and my soup was cold.
Maureen W.,"South Pasadena, CA",663,821,8,3.0,11/27/2012,"Finally got a chance to come to the new Pasadena outpost of BJS.  The space is quite lovely...high ceilings and lots of booth and a big fat bar if you just want a cocktail while you shop at the nearby Paseo. I met my friend for lunch and we split a salad and a gluten free pizza.  I was rather impressed with the pizza.  I don't normally eat gluten free but my friend does so I was game.  The crust was really crispy but the cheese and sauce were perfect.  Kind of a wood fired affect all around.  The salad was decent, the BBQ Chicken salad, but it's kind of hard to mess up a salad.   Service was very nice, our waitress was quick and friendly.  Beware though--they will try to convince you that you want a pizookie.  While normally, I'm all about desserts, I had to resist with every fiber of my being the allure of the pizookie because I was still feeling so fat and bloated from Thanksgiving!  MUST RESIST URGE TO EAT PIZOOKIE ALL TO MYSELF! By the way, they don't validate mall parking but they do have a valet at the dinner time rush."
Lexi C.,"South Pasadena, CA",131,85,27,2.0,1/17/2014,"Sighhhhhhhhhh.... I've always liked BJ's---- until this one opened. It's SO gorgeous, and conveniently located. Why did you have to fall short? :( Don't get me wrong- I don't HATE it but it certainly doesn't leave me wanting more. The service always SUCKS. Our visits usually start off great then, NEVER fails, our server goes missing. What the heck?? I kid you not, my boyfriend and I started joking that they must go on break once we get our meals. I hope the servers tip the bussers really well seeing as how they tend to be the only ones interested in bringing us the things we need. e.g. Plates, napkins, the dressing that SHOULD come with the wings, straws, the lemon I ASKED for with my water... I could go on but I think you get it.  The food has never been bad, but I guess after waiting for them to bring you the necessary items in order to enjoy your food, it goes cold. You can't really win. Or at least I haven't been able to. Stars for effort. I guess."
lynn p.,"Pasadena, CA",2,8,1,1.0,4/11/2015,"Stay far far away from this place!!! I can't believe I even gave this place a second chance. The first time I came we were given a buzzer/pager thing. We were waiting in the waiting area: after being told our wait would be about 15 minutes. Well, after 30 minutes, I asked the hostess if we were coming up soon. She told me....oh we already called/pages your table. I told her our buzzer never went off her response was ""yeah , they don't really work"". She then seated us at the back of the rest. Once we were seated, we waited 15 minutes until a waiter told us they'd be right with us. We got up and left.  Returned to this nightmare of a place the other day because I had to meet someone there. Ordered a wedge: which was the hardest piece of iceberg I've ever seen. I could barely cut it with a knife. And when I reached the inside, it was black and moldy. Yum.  I will NEVER come back. EVER. stay away."
Wayne E.,"Alhambra, CA",400,124,128,4.0,12/1/2012,"I love BJ's how could you not love bj's captain crunch french toast, the piranha chili, burgers, pizza's, pizookies.  This facility is new, I think it used to be a bank or something. I apparently am the duke because I've been here so much since it's opening. They really spruced the place up and the staff while new and possibly inexperienced have not let me down service wise since I've been there. It's one of our go to spots. I'm glad I don't have to drive all the way over to arcadia now to enjoy one of my favorite brewery's to eat/drink/desert at.  The only thing that has consistently bothered me about this place and has nothing to do with the service or food or anything. But it's the floors, I'm not sure what kind of shoes the staff wears but there is some kind of coating on the floors that makes it feel like a waxed skateboard bottom. I feel like someone is eventually going to hurt themselves on it, again could be something completely out of their control. But I thought it would be worth mentioning."
Afsoon B.,"Glendale, CA",3,27,12,1.0,3/21/2015,"We ordered some thing as our appetizer. After a long time waiting they brought a dish that was dirty and cold. I asked them to change it, and that took us lots of waiting. The appetizer and the main course arrived together, and that wasn't good."
Lorena C.,"Pasadena, CA",34,18,13,3.0,1/2/2015,"Prior to this evening I have had a pretty good experience at BJs, unfortunately today was not. The hostess was not very inviting nor made us feel welcomed! Her telling us the wait was an hour long was given to us as discouragement to not wait! The wait was not an hour long but only 35 minutes for a party of nine. She came off not so friendly. :( We waited very long time for a waiter after being seated,  as a matter of fact we had to ask for a waiter to take our drinks and our orders! I asked for a manager bc we thought our lil one had lost her purse, well sadly the manager never came by!! :/ We found the purse but not the manager! The waiter however, was very cordial, and attentive The food was good. I don't think I will return. So sad...."
Barry A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/8/2016,Horrible experience! Made us wait over 45 mins even with our reservation. Didn't give any utensils or plates when the food came out. Waitress didn't bring any spoons for our soups. Forgot to take our drink orders. Would never come here again. Waiter was clueless and slow.
Joline P.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",56,34,1,2.0,7/1/2015,"The Sriracha Brussels Sprouts are amazing, the tortilla soup is very good.  Everything else is inconsistently good or just plain terrible.  My daughter liked the happy face fries. The dine in service is terrible and It is practically impossible to order food to-go, pay by phone and pick up your order seamlessly.  I work in the office building upstairs from this location so one would think that it would be very easy and convenient ordering from here.  Today I ordered a cup of soup at 2:10pm, paid with an app on my phone, showed up at 2:35pm.  The only guy in the front area was on the phone and after a very long conversation, he asked if I had been helped.  Who would have helped me?  We have both been standing here together through your conversation and no one else is here!  Then he left and sent someone else over who also left to find my food.  Then a different person came to help (without my food) but couldn't find my order.  Then he left and got someone else to help and neither of them could find my order. Finally a BJ's server that was dressed in plain clothes listening to another BJ's server that appeared to be on break complaining about her personal problems finally taught both of them how to pull up a to-go order.  While I was grateful to him for finally helping, I thought it was rude that the two of them took up the whole bench, which was the only space for me to sit while I waited through the whole circus of how many people it takes to get one person a cup of tortilla soup.  THEN FINALLY one of them left to actually go and get the soup from the kitchen, so I waited for that for a while.  When the guy with my soup started talking to another guest and fumbling with my bag I just grabbed my cup of soup, asked for a spoon and stormed out, not that anyone cared or noticed how ridiculous the whole thing was. If I hadn't already paid I would have left long ago. This is not the first time I've been through this fiasco. I've complained twice before about pick up orders (time wasted, forgotten pieces of my meal) but no one cares.  I suspect the GM gets a lot of complaints and is completely burnt out.  Until then I guess I'll just go if I'm desperate, haven't had the opportunity to roll my eyes lately or feel like being treated poorly when I have extra time on my hands with nothing to do.  Until then!"
David M.,"Compton, CA",0,13,,1.0,6/4/2016,The food and drink were bad!! $30 down the drain.  Baby back ribs were overcooked. The margarita was way too sweet. The service was Ok. Never been to a BJs before and don't think I will try another again.
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,4.0,10/14/2013,"A good BJ's is always a good BJ's -- when it's offered you'll never see me turn one down -- but this Pasadena location is the Mecca of them all: Huge spread, palatial, estimated hundred-foot high ceilings, stained glass, Tuscany-like paint, patio space, grand TVs, well-endowed table space. On this visit, sans deep dish Pizza, four of us wanted to share Pazookies, because we're like Pazookie monsters naturally (Pazookies are big baked cookies, slightly melty and oozy inside, with a dallop of ice cream on top). OK, just me, I'm the monster. The dilemma then becomes whether to order one or two. Because a monster like me -- a  white guy like me can be called Me the Monster, or Gorging White Man Monster -- can eat one to myself, that's right, I'll eat that whole thing on my own and not even look up at you. But check this out: Did you know you can order the PAZOOKIE SAMPLE TRIO(!) with three medium sized cookies of your choice (Macadamia, Chocolate Chip, Cookies & Cream!) and ice cream to share amongst friends? Bang for your buck, bang for your mouth, I hogged one of them! #bazooka-of-taste and #selfishness"
Jason O.,"Pasadena, CA",235,288,8,4.0,5/7/2014,"Fifth stop of the pub-crawl. Before leaving the paseo, we had to stop at BJ's.  First we met up with 3 or 4 of our other friends who had to get a late start on the crawl due to silly priorities like work and family.  Once inside we randomly ran into our friend Black Jen.  She is totally awesome and she had a few of her friends with her so suddenly we went from an enthusiastic group of 3 to an energetic group of 8 or 9.   The BJ's in Pasadena has all the great food and beer you expect at all their locations but this BJ's is really fancy.  It has a really high ceiling and they decided to go with a less industrial brewery look in favor of a slightly more upscale swanky dinning look.  It still feels like a BJ's but it's really nice.  I think our bar tender was named Giselle, but I can't remember.  Our service was good.  I finished my Jeremiah Red and we all started to make our way down the hill toward Old Town."
Montserrat S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,15,5.0,7/19/2015,"Went a couple of days ago, server Marco was funny and extremely nice, appetizers came out super fast. Main course came out 10-15 minutes later which gave me enough time to stuff my face with avocado rolls and spinach artichoke dip. Bacon guacamole burger was amazing. Ended it all with classic chocolate chunk pizookie. Another server helped with bringing out the food, I didn't catch his name but he was nice about everything even when my brother asked for a replacement top bun without the mayonnaise. Always super friendly servers and great experiences when I come here."
Randi C.,"Hesperia, CA",9,28,11,5.0,7/14/2014,"The building was amazing, even my kids appreciated the history of it. Waitress was great and food was delicious! Located right next to parking garage which was nice as well."
Maga G.,"La Plata, Argentina",5,32,,5.0,9/25/2014,"Excellent customer attention, it has some of the best beers and burgers. The price is really good for the food and for the beers, I highly recommend the beers tasters."
Kamala C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3,66,6,2.0,8/28/2013,"My firm just moved in to the building across the street and we went on a Friday afternoon to celebrate with lunch and drinks. The plus of going to a BJ's is that you know what you are getting - zero surprises. Unfortunately, this particular restaurant is pretty horrendous. The building is amazing - the waiters are nice - the booze tastes the same - BUT - WOW! HOLY SLOW. Everything just slowly went downhill as the meal progressed. It took forever to get our beers and food. On top of that, our lunches were all delivered separately - I got mine twenty minutes after my co-worker. No joke. It is just too bad. Great location - but the service is slow and amateur."
Jen T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,14,6,3.0,4/15/2016,"Ladies in the front werent so accommodating. We had good seats. Food is good. Service is bad. Cant even find our server.  Parking is at Paseo, not so bad. WOW. mac and cheese took them almost an hour to serve."
Matthew L.,"Rosemead, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/11/2016,"I love this particular BJ's, I work in Glendale and eat there often,the service is great and the environment is friendly. Holy Family church was blessed to revive a generous donation to feed our entire youth group. I recommend this location and I'm proud that they are support the city of Glendale."
