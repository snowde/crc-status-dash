wendie w.,"San Francisco, CA",2,11,,2.0,1/3/2015,"Good luck getting the price of a cocktail before you order.  No cocktail prices on the menu.  Asked our server and she was able to give us a range ($8.75-$15) but couldn't tell us the price of any individual drink.  She said she could only see the price when she entered the order into the computer system.  Wow, how is that even legal. Had the caesar salad, it was boring.  But the potato skins were very yummy."
Jules D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,4,5.0,3/18/2016,"I had a great experience. Chad was a very attentive and personable waiter. The meal was spot on, especially the Pizookie dessert. The place itself is very ornate and looks fancy. Definitely the best looking BJs I have been to."
Renee S.,"South Pasadena, CA",15,77,177,1.0,2/7/2016,"NEVER WILL COME TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN, My granddaughter had a birthday party here last week and the service is terrible, the wait is ridiculously long and the waiter is disgusting. Ordered my son's their famous pizookie cookies and ice cream desserts and this guy brings it to our table and the ice cream scoops are double stacked and one fell over and this moron scoops the entire ball of ice cream up with all five fingers and smashed it on top of the other scoop of ice cream, right in front of everyone lol. Are you kidding me, thought I was being punked for a minute so I say really dude you just picked up our ice cream with your gross bare hands and he tells me, well my hands are clean, oh ok take it back no thanks and check please.... oh and food is not good like other locations, O had the grilled fish tacos with nothing inside bit a cold cabbage and I had to send the calamari back and have them remove it from the bill because it was so greasy and tasted like rubber bands. TIP for the management  TRY AGAIN, FIRE your entire staff including the CHEF'S because you won't be in business for long."
Justin S.,"Santa Monica, CA",116,85,16,1.0,10/19/2013,"Usually a fan of bjs and their food and service is normally good, but this place is definitely under par. We received an appetizer 1.5 hours after we sat down and everything that we received was lukewarm. It took me multiple times to receive ketchup and they brought out a jambalaya with noodles instead of rice, the eff? Would not recommend coming to this bjs, other chains will be a much better experience"
Mona C.,"Santa Ana, CA",18,121,132,3.0,3/5/2014,"Broke my heart to find out they got rid of the red velvet pizookie!  On the upside; -friendly service -open late  -gorgeous location (interior and decor)  -great happy hour -plenty of TVs for watching sports  -mini size options for pizzas and desserts  -large variety of food and pizzas On the downside; -they don't validate parking  -only the bar area is open late  -no more red velvet pizookie  -pizza is premade-all they do is warm it up and you can taste that in the quality  Why oh why do these restaurants insist on having a million things on the menu and specializing in none? They claim they specialize in pizzas but sticking a frozen pizza in the oven is not specializing IMHO. I came here late on a Monday since it was just about the only thing open. Had a BBQ chicken pizza which was barely warm-cheese has barely melted. I forgot about that distinctive ""frozen"" taste premade food has untill I bit into this pizza. Our waiter was very friendly and professional.  Maybe I've been spoiled but I just can't stand the taste of these places that simply warm the food up. As much as I can't stand it, the pizookies are too good to ignore forever...I'll be back."
Adam O.,"Long Beach, CA",332,146,13,5.0,5/31/2013,"I usually wait a while to post to yelp. I figure it's best to let things settle for a while and let the hyperbole die down before the fingers hit the keyboard. But after my visit last night to BJs Pasadena, I simply could not wait!  My family and I (a group of about 10) ventured in here after my brother's graduation from Alhambra High. We've been to BJs plenty of times before at various locations so I wasn't really excited about this trip but was just stoked to get out of the sun and in to some pizookie!  I've been told by many friends that this location was formerly a bank and is ""really nice"". But I guess my friends are lacking in figurative language because this location is simply amazing! As you walk in, beautifully massive chandeliers greet you as you enter in to a restaurant that resembles something out of Chicago circa 1940. The ceilings are high and decorated in dark wooden squares accented with gold. The place is massive but doesn't feel cavernous and is overflowing with class. I couldn't help but walk around the dining room and gawk at everything as if I were in a museum. But enough about the setting. Let's get on to the food and service.  My mom called ahead to make sure we had a table when we arrived. As we walked in, we were immediately greeted and brought to our table. As soon as we all sat down, the manager came to say hello and offer a congrats to my little brother. Right away, everyone made us feel right at home. Our server, Marvina, then arrived and kept the great mood flowing. She was probably the friendliest and most up beat waitress I have ever met. After sitting in the sun for 4 hours, she was definitely the perfect person to rejuvenate our batteries and get us ready to feast.  Everyone pretty much knows the menu at BJs. You have your pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and a few other entree items that get you ready for the main prize of a pizookie at the end of the night. I had the Jambalaya which was very authentic and plentiful. A tad on the spicy side though, so beware. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food including my grandparents who are as picky as they come. At the end of the night, Marvina stuck around to make sure we all had a picture with the graduate. She indulged my mother who had her wait around as we fought about different poses and what not. But she was a great sport the entire time. My brother liked her so much, he asked if he could have a picture with her. Of course she obliged and helped put the lid on a pretty great night.  After visiting this BJs, I don't think I'll ever want to go to another location again. Thanks for the great experience!"
Brooke S.,"Montrose, CA",2,41,5,2.0,5/17/2015,"First visit, we hardly saw our waiter. They had run out of avocado egg rolls.  Second visit, better waitress, but they had run out of two different desserts. Our pizzas took forever and were cold and they had to redo the kids Mac and cheese because it was cold (they didn't even bring it out because she said it looked bad).  They need better management and a better chef."
K A.,"Pasadena, CA",2,24,3,1.0,4/12/2013,"This is different for everyone, but ask yourself this question: ""How many times do you have to have a bad experience before you say, 'This is the last time.'""? I really want to like this place because it's beautiful inside and I love the pizza and beer but the thing about big corporations is that if they have great systems and management, it can be well-runned machine. Unfortunately, this BJ's drops the ball. I like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt if they are just opening or they are extremely busy, but I have been there over SEVERAL, SEVERAL times (can you tell I give them the benefit of the doubt?) and I have to say that I've had enough. Today was the last time. Again, the place is BEAUTIFUL and the food is GREAT, but the service is terrible. I don't blame the servers when the service is bad, I blame the management.  Some of the problems I've had there are the following (note that sometimes ALL are happening in one experience): - food comes out at different times so one has to wait until everyone is served - no silverware at the table (even after ALL the food has been served) - the wings are cold inside by the bone - takes forever to have someone bring menus, take orders, get your beers, etc. - This one really bugs me (can they get a better system for this already?? It happens at all BJ's): Someone comes around with food you didn't order and asks if you ordered it. Then someone else will come by with something else and ask if this is for you... Come on already! Stop interrupting me already - I have all my food (even though it took a long time!) Long story short, IF YOU VALUE CUSTOMER SERVICE and a management that gives a damn, KEEP WALKING."
Carrie D.,"Pasadena, CA",1500,416,2,1.0,8/29/2014,"Speed of service and proper training of staff matters...and really, these are two of the most basic elements of running a good restaurant. This BJ's cannot even meet the basic minimum standards of customer service. Stopped in for lunch today because I had gotten several emails from BJ's alerting me to the fact they currently had the ""Party for 2"" special. This is a great deal, especially since they have a gluten free version. My partner-in-crime Brian V. and I decided to take advantage of the offer and have lunch there today...I deeply regret this decision. When our server Christobal arrived to take our order (and it took him quite a while to actually arrive to take our order) he was completely clueless as to the fact there was a ""Party of 2"" special. I received 5 different emails from BJ's and it is featured on their website, yet a server in their restaurant had no idea what the special was, or that it even existed at all. We showed him the BJ's website on our phone, but he had to go and check with the manager...oh surprise, there is indeed a ""Party of 2"" special. We ordered two waters, a bowl of clam chowder, a wedge salad, and a gluten free pizza with mushrooms, tomatoes, green peppers, and olives. A few minutes later Christobal arrived with plates for our pizza...but no drinks. I asked about the water and got the response, ""Oh...yeah...it's coming..."" A few minutes later our soup and salad arrived (delivered by a food runner)...and then...finally...we got our water. We finished our starters...and waited...and waited...and eventually our pizza arrived...without tomatoes. I pointed out to Christobal that our pizza was missing the tomatoes we ordered. He took out his order pad/whatever he wrote our order on and said, "".oh yeah."" He took our pizza back to the kitchen...and again we waited. He showed up a while later with our pizza...and it had tomatoes on it...but they were, raw, cold, wet, tomatoes that had simply been thrown on top of our cooked pizza. When I told Christobal that this was not acceptable he seemed confused...""You wanted tomatoes on you pizza right?"" MY answer was, ""yes, but I wanted them to actually be cooked on to the pizza like all of the other toppings."" He took the pizza away. He came back and told us the manager was going to bring us our pizza...and we waited...and waited...and waited some more. Eventually a female manager (do not know her name because she did not introduce herself) brought our pizza back to us...I say ""back"" because it was the original tomato-less pizza with tomatoes and more cheese sprinkled on it that had been shoved under the salamander to kind of, sort of, not really melt the cheese. I was actually speechless at this point...really, how is any of this a good solution? Raw tomatoes...that is just stupid...but to bring a re-fired, mess of a pizza back to an already aggravated customer is the height of bad customer service.  The ""Party for 2"" comes with a pizookie...we got the gluten free one...it was fine. But, we had to wait forever and a day to get the check from our server. And then, to add insult to injury, I wanted to use some of my rewards points (accumulated at many other BJ's...not this one) which would give us $10 off the meal. After waiting...again...a long time...Christobal arrives and tells us that the manager is working on our check, but because we got the ""Party for 2"" I may not be able to use my coupon. Coupon, what coupon? These are rewards points that BJ's gives me for being a loyal customer. He just looked at me with apathy, disinterest, and confusion.  I told him we needed the check right now...we needed to leave...just bring the check. OMG,...waiting...waiting...finally Christobal arrives with the check and tells us that they were indeed able to apply my rewards points. This was seriously one of the single worst customer service experiences I have ever had, anywhere. A person who had just wakled off the street could have been a more informed and capable server than Christobal. I would assume that BJ's has a training program for managers and servers...perhaps our server was just absent that say. And clearly the manager was absent that day too. Seriously, do yourself a favor...go to one of the other fine eating establishments in Pasadena."
Christian A.,"Pasadena, CA",22,56,20,5.0,4/11/2015,"I love the place, the enviroment and the wait staff are very proffessional our waitress was on top of it , and she was very social with us and a very nice girl. I ordered the Bison burger and is just delicious, I live in Pasadena but I usually go to other BJ locations but Pasadena got me this time."
Yelp R.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",25,80,300,3.0,6/15/2014,Service is pretty slow. There are TVs every where so it's good to watch games. We enjoyed watching the soccer World Cup game between England and Italy. Washroom were a little dirty. They don't validate the parking but 1.5 hrs is allowed in Paseo Colorado parking  when you go to a restaurant.
Andee A.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,37,2,1.0,10/11/2015,"Worst service ever! Party of four, we got a table right away on Saturday night, but they stuck us in a corner and forgot about us. Food, once we finally got it, was quite good but we were thoroughly aggravated by the waiter's lengthy absences and inability to deliver our complete order. It turned a lovely evening out with family into a real drag. We will never, ever return."
Al B.,"Pasadena, CA",74,87,117,1.0,3/6/2013,"I had a bad experience at BJ's today. I walked in for a late lunch and sat at the bar. I ordered a root beer, a half turkey Cobb sandwich and a tomato soup. There was a couple at the bar also. The runner brought them their half sandwich orders.  A few minutes later, another runner brought three tomato soups out to the couple and me. (I always thought that soup should come out before the sandwich...no concept of timing). To our surprise the soup was totally cold. We complained to the bartender (short Hispanic girl who was nice and apologetic) and she took the couple's two soups back to the kitchen to tell the manager.  A short time later, a runner who was dressed as if he were the assistant manager (male Caucasian, 6-0, chubby, black hair) brought out my sandwich. I told him about my cold soup which was still sitting in front of me. He smugly told me that they were aware of the problem and were taking care of it. I asked him if he could take my soup away. He refused saying that the bartender would take care of it. The bartender had not returned from the kitchen and was not at the bar. I asked again and he argued with me that the bartender had a receptacle below the bar to put the bowl of soup away in. He had a poor, condescending attitude and I told him so. He then rudely and aggressively removed the bowl of soup making some smart alec comments. I then got up, told the manager that his runner was an asshole and left the restaurant. I have frequented the restaurant for lunch in the past and have never been treated so poorly.  FYI, ever since BJ's Pasadena opened, it has developed a reputation for poor service amongst the locals. Just check out some of the other reviews. If this is how customers are supposed to be treated it will be only a matter of time before BJ's Pasadena goes belly up."
Daniel P.,"Pasadena, CA",1,18,,2.0,10/29/2013,"Went there Friday night for a quick dinner.  Despite the existence of empty tables the hostess tried to seat us UNDER a TV in the corner so we couldn't see the TV but everyone was looking our way.  Once we moved to a new section, things didn't get better.  The waitress complained that she had too many tables and that it was going to take her ""awhile"". Our food came out all at different times.  What do you do?  Wait for your friends' food to come, i.e. eat cold food or do you eat by yourself?  My burger was supposed to be medium rare, but came out as a hockey puck instead.  My friend's chicken soup came out as vegetable soup but who cares, at least the beers were cold."
Tony C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,2,2.0,1/2/2014,"BEWARE!!! THEY DO NOT VALIDATE!!! Don't play into the trickery! They are not part of ""Paseo Colorado"".  Other than that. Food is good, service is good, pizookie was delicious! Try the stuffed spinach mushrooms."
Lisa K.,"Pasadena, CA",0,184,14,2.0,3/19/2015,"I never go to national chain restaurants, but after a pretty terrible day, I wanted to eat my feelings and we ended up here. We got stuck in a corner booth in the back of the restaurant where we repeatedly got forgotten. The waitress blamed the huge parties that came in and the food runner since they forgot parts of our order and the kitchen for being backed up. The food we did get was below average, calorie bombs, we even tried their new pizza which was a soggy mess in the middle. So pretty much never again. Just don't bother, find a local place that has great pizza."
Luis V.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/29/2014,"Food at bj's is great! But the service we received at this location by, Dianna W. was HORRIBLE! She took forever to come to our table to take our order and then took forever to bring us our drinks then when she finally brought us our food she didnt bring any condiments for my steak or wife's pasta and she never asked if we wanted a refill and didnt even come back to check on us and it wasnt even busy when we went.  That server is lucky to still work here shes SUCKS at her job. Hopefully if you come here she dosent help you out make sure you dont get stuck with her. I love BJ'S but on that day I had a horrible experience."
Mart N.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,2,1.0,8/16/2014,"Only pro:  The interior is one of the nicest I've seen in a casual restaurant. Cons: If only I could give them a zero. This is the slowest BJ's I have ever been to. The wait time wasn't so bad considering it's a Saturday night - only five minutes. The food took forever to come out, and the pizookies took 45 minutes to come out. 45 MINUTES?! I think they milked a cow, then churned the ice cream in the back. When they did finally come out, the pizookies were ice cold.  The food is always delicious, but one of our plates came out with no fries. We were told they would be out when they were ready. About 15 minutes later out waiter brought out an old plate of wedges that looked like they came from another persons plate. When we got the check, we still hadn't gotten our fries. When we mentioned it to the waiter, he LAUGHED it off as if it wasn't a big deal.  One last thing - the waiter spilled hot sauce all over our table, when he was taking one of our plates back. Terrible. Sad to say this is the worst experience I've had at a BJ's. I will definitely not come back to this location. Considering this is on Colorado blvd., and there's a bunch of other restaurants, look elsewhere, or be prepared for an infuriating experience.  FYI: They do not validate for parking."
Dan S.,"Pasadena, CA",42,87,47,3.0,1/25/2014,"It's a chain.  For the most part; if you've been to 1, you've been to them all.   This one is a bit unique due to the architecture of the interior, particularly the bar. The service is above average more often than not... Except if you're alone and you get up to go use the facilities, then your food and drink will get tossed. even when you tell someone, or multiple servers... it's great that they're so on top of keeping the place presentable, but it's frustrated me a couple of times.  I do have a few favorites, like the cobb salad, their flat bread pizzas are good for snacking, the black cherry soda is good (over ice or it's too sweet). The pizza is a bit too greasy for my taste, but I will go for it every now and again with their Jeremiah Red. And the white chocolate macadamia pizookie is purdy tasty.  Bottom line - depending on your mood there's better there are also a LOT worse.  This place is consistent."
Winnie C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,1.0,11/15/2014,"Do not use online order service!!! Seriously!!! My pick up time supposed to be 9:00 pm. I arrived on time, but I waited for someone to help me for about 10 minutes. Food were cold. The portion was unbelievable small. I remembered that the portion was bigger if dining there. Very disappointed!"
