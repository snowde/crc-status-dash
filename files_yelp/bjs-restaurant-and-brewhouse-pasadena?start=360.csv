Raf D.,"Carson, CA",58,16,80,3.0,2/16/2014,"You get what you pay for!!! Baby back ribs were kind of dry, and the steak was descent.. Mahi mahi tasted good.  Overall it's average!  Our server was very nice and professional!  I rather pay a little more and go to Houston's"
Anh-Dao T.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,828,18,3.0,7/18/2013,Their TVs went out three times while we were watching the All-Star game. I think I booed too loudly because the guy fixing the monitor suddenly stopped and looked up. I kept my mouth shut after that and we left during the fourth inning. I'd rather follow the game on my phone. Only their Tuesday wine special made the visit worthwhile. (50% off all glasses and bottles at the bar)
Roy A.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/14/2015,Do yourself a favor and go to cpk instead. 45 minutes and still no food. Waiter keep saying it's coming. What a joke
Arbi B.,"Glendale, CA",44,17,4,2.0,2/3/2013,"First off, let me say that I love the BJ's chain.  I have gone to numerous locations across Southern California.  But this location failed me.   Although this is probably the nicest and biggest BJ's I have been too, the service was not good at all.  We went as a group of four.  One of my friend's ordered a tortilla soup and it was just full of oil.  I also tasted the soup and it did not taste like tortilla soup at all.  It tasted like a spoon full of straight oil.  My friend's little sister ordered a Mac and Cheese and it came cold.  I ordered the spicy jalapeno burger, which was supposed to come with a spicy chipotle sauce on it, but they failed to put it on the burger.  I asked my server for the chipotle sauce three times, THREE TIMES, before she finally brought it.  Then I asked for spicy buffalo sauce and she also forgot to bring that.  Finally, I asked someone else to bring it.   We decided to order a pizooke for the table.  After 15 min of waiting for our pizooke, we asked for an update on our dessert.  She indicated to us that the order was never put in the system.  We were forced to wait another 10 min for it.   Then we can get outside to the valet for BJ's.  We waited 15 min for our car to be brought to the front and it was not busy at all.  On top of that, two of the valet workers brought the car together.  One was driving and the other was in the passenger seat.  The valet worker in the passenger seat decided that it was okay for her to have a starbucks drink in my car.  On top of that, when she opened the passenger door to get out, she just slammed the door right as I was about to enter the car.  I don't care about having drinks in my car, but your a valet parking worker...you're supposed to have the best interests of my car...and that clearly wasn't the case here. Overall, this is the BJ's way of doing business.  I know its a new restaurant, but you're supposed to make a good impression for this new location and this BJ's failed to do so."
Travis C.,"Alhambra, CA",108,17,,2.0,5/12/2013,"Awesome building and interior, huge tv's in bar area. We ordered the lettuce and chicken appetizer, which consisted basically of lettuce leafs and a very small bowl of chicken for wraps. The drinks were terrible, tasted like a $10 fruit punch, the waiter said that they had company policy on mixed drinks. The food was okay nothing spectacular."
HourLy L.,"Monterey Park, CA",186,282,301,3.0,12/30/2013,"I've been to a few different BJ's and usually order the same things.   Yay: -Traditional wings (appetizer): I love how they make theirs.  Crispy and not too oily.  I always order this. -Shrimp Scampi pasta: my bf loves this dish and he's not a big pasta eater but this is his go to dish when he comes here.  Nice flavors and not too greasy either. -Pizooki: warm cookie topped with ice cream.  I really like the oreo with vanilla ice cream.  They gave my friend a mini one for free for his bday. -Honey crisp chicken salad: this is my favorite salad from all their salads.  Great honey mustard dressing with crispy chicken. It's a large portion so it's really filling. Other: -Jalapeno Burger: kind of greasy and although they put fried jalapenos in it, this burger lacks flavor. Nay: -Parking: for some reason they're not considered part of paseo even though they share the same parking lot so you have to get it validated at one of the other shops. Or you can just go to the self validation area near PF Changs."
Karina G.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",43,8,3,4.0,1/18/2014,My boyfriend and I really enjoy this place. The service is great and the booze is good. The food is pretty average. The football happy hour is great. It's never super crowded or noisy. The building itself is just beautiful. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Pasadena.
Daniel W.,"Pasadena, CA",8,5,,2.0,8/23/2014,Amazing Art Deco interior sadly let down with average service ordered 4 drinks only got 3- sides brought out with starters  just generally poor! Food was okay the ribs great pasta cold over cooked and dry ! Don't think we will repeat!
Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61,3.0,12/4/2012,"New Location!!! It's beautiful inside... one of the best BJ's I've been too (look-wise) ... Very nice Bar! Got seated right away in a little cute booth on the side...  Waiter came by, gave us the specials and what was good on the drink menu...  ordered the usual Avocado eggrolls... you can never go wrong with that one.. So delicious..  The drinks were ok! I got the Sangria... (it was just ok) The Plum beer was great...  Ordered our food... Took too long to come out..  The steak which we wanted well done was Med rare! The lobster tail looked kinda gross and had no flavor...  The chicken in the chicken Marsala was good, but the pasta was not cooked well.. Waiter took TOO LONG with the check... when we put the card in there, he took TOO LONG to pick it up,. and then went to the side while we're staring at him since we were in a hurry he was chit chatting with a co-worker and wasn't sliding the card so we could get out of there...  Beautiful place... service needs a lot of work... Food we need to make sure we insist on how we like our food next time...  Finally a BJ's in Pasadena! I hope they improve the service since I would LOVE to go back again!"
Nathanial H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/31/2015,The poor service and worse food has inspired me to sign up for yelp.  This place is seriously in need of a wake up call.  My family and I will not go back.
My Feedback S.,"Pasadena, CA",1,32,10,3.0,3/14/2016,The food is good..the service is horrible during the lunch hour. The front staff (if any) seem lost at times. Your best bet is to sit at the bar and eat there...eventually someone will approach you.
Bell B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/1/2016,"Come here if you want to wait for your food for a hour! Floors were so dirty, food sucks, and let me tell you about the bathroom disgusting! It was like a tornado tissue paper and seating papers all over the floor, it's just a bad BJS restaurant. I will never come back here... Why spend all that money if it's not worth it. I learned my lesson.Plus parking sucks had to pay $4 even with validating"
Khrystyna C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",19,211,52,4.0,1/5/2014,"Lots of televisions so it's good for sports in the bar area.  They have their own beer and I've found some to be to my liking and others not do much. Personal taste. The good part they will give you a taste to figure out which one you would like. I'm fond of their lightening and the blonde.  It seems I've grown out of enjoying IPA's maybe due to enjoying wine with less harsh and more complex notes.  If you enjoy IPA's you will enjoy it.  Food: Caesar salad is perfect every time. So crisp and refreshing.  Mahi Mahi over rice is so good. Tender, tasty, mouth watering and always the perfect temperature.  The main issue I have is keep ordering the same thing because I know it will be great.  Dessert: the pizookie is ok if your a fan of chocolate.  Grilled chicken pasta was a little bland but the gourmet Mac and cheese was super flavorful.  However the fresh cut strawberry on the beignet is refreshing and the perfect ending to a meal. Your not left feeling over stuffed.  Good sports bar! Coors light drinkers just order the light switch! Light and refreshing!"
A C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/25/2014,"We visited BJ's Sunday morning with family from out of town. Mainly because they are huge soccer fans and the screens are there abundantly.  It was not very crowded and we all ordered simple breakfast: eggs, potatoes, sausage and toast and one person ordered a steak.  The service was extremely SLOW!!! At least 45-60 minutes for breakfast?  Ridiculous!! And the toast was brought cold... no jelly,  no ketchup for the potatoes. And when asked it took another 10 minutes for the condiments. In other words, I had already eaten most of my toast by the time condiments came. I was embarrassed that I brought my guests here and the only thing that made the visit bearable was the fact that the World Cup was being shown. This is the second time I had received slow service at this BJ'S.  The first time was on my Son's Birthday!  Uuugh! Won't be visiting again...."
John S.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",163,224,11,1.0,12/17/2012,"I ordered my pizza online and specified a time. Right before I approached the front door, I slipped and fell in the patio area. One of the employees saw me, asked me if I was okay and then resumed his business.  So I go to the counter and found out that my pizza wasn't ready. Uh okay. I metered parked it for 15 minutes and then I had to run back to my car to put in more money because they didn't have my pizza ready in time. It took an additional 15 minutes for my pizza. So now I'm on my way home, I get home annoyed and ready to eat my pizza and open the box. My pizza was not cooked all the way through... so let's recap 1) I fall 2) pizza was late 3) I have to put more money in my meter 4) my pizza was not cooked I will never come back here...terrible service.."
Diana Jeanne N.,"Alhambra, CA",212,167,197,5.0,6/28/2013,You can never go wrong with their pizookie.  My girlfriends and I ordered 1 half oreo half chocolate chip.  Heaven in your mouth.
TheLaborLawGuy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,201,17,3.0,9/16/2013,"Had brunch here with the kids and wifey.  Wifey had the traditional buffalo wings appetizer as a meal since the portion is so huge.  I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi, which was perfectly cooked.  Mahi is low on fat, so it can be very dry if overcooked.  Mine was cooked a perfect medium and was juicy and flavorful.  My kids had the kids grilled chicken , which was desert dry, and the Captain Crunch french toast sticks, which were overfried and too sweet.   Would have been a perfect 5 star had the kids meals been better prepared.  Next time we return, we are avoiding the kids menu."
Javier S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",20,6,1,1.0,6/1/2014,"Mediocre pizza and food! After the server serving our incorrect meals and the manager approaching us only to offer us CORRECT meals only after waiting an additional 30 minutes, and then being served the incorrect drinks (beers) waving down the server to notify her,  we became extremely upset!! At no point were our needs met! And at no point was service up to par as expected from a chain restaurant like BJS."
Breana N.,"Pasadena, CA",13,45,20,1.0,8/25/2015,"Everytime I come to this BJ's there's always a problem with my food, never fails! This time takes the cake for me though. I'll never spend my money here again! Ordered a cheese pizza with extra sauce and a turkey burger with a caesar salad. You'd think that was simple, but nope, not for them. Took 30-45mins to actually get my food, but before I received my food the waiter brought out the salad. I started mixing my salad and there was this big black thing covered in dressing. I took it out and put it on a napkin and smashed it (I'm sticking to it being a black bean because other possibilities will make me throw up). I sent it back and told my waiter I'll take the fries instead because that was absolutely gross. He apologized and took it back. He then brought out cold fries. At that point I was really irritated and just asked can he bring fresh fries with my burger. When our food finally came out EVERYTHING was wrong! Dry pizza (no extra sauce), burger thrown together, and cold fries AGAIN. I was livid at that point I just paid and left. NEVER AGAIN!"
Crystal C.,"Sierra Madre, CA",41,6,2,1.0,4/22/2013,"Can you give 0 stars? The building is amazing - okay, there's the 1 star. We went on a slow Thursday night. My son had just finished practice. We ordered 1 beer, water & kid drinks. The water was empty long before the food came. We never had a refill. My son's lemonade was refilled but way too far apart.  We ordered salads with our pizzas. The salads never came. We asked for them to be removed from our bill, but they were not. Our food came out in a reasonable time. We ordered 2 pizzas & kids' pasta. Don't ask me how, but the pizzas were burnt & cold!!! How does that happen? I've burnt my family's food plenty of times - but it always comes to the table warm. ;) No water refills, but the waitress did sell us another beer.  The waitress was very polite, but not a good waitress. I had to take my daughter to the restroom twice...kids...both times I slipped on the floors and nearly fell on my bottom. I have a frequent buyer card. I asked them to credit the account, but there was some excuse for me to do it myself at home. So, I did & at the same time sent corporate a note about the issues we had. I never heard from corporate, even though they promised a response within 48 hours. To add insult to injury, I did receive an email from corporate telling me that they ""could not add my points"" no real reason why. So, bad food, poor service, no parking validation, slipped on the floors, and no points means I'll never go back!  BJ's corporate - take notice - many of the reviews are similar to mine. That's a lot of rent to pay for that location if people aren't coming back. Take time to make it right for your customers - because I won't go to the Arcadia/Monrovia location now either. Disappointed @ best!"
