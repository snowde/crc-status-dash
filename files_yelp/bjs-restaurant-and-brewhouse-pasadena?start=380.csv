Marissa Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,20,,1.0,11/11/2012,"I was extremely disappointed in the customer service here. They do not take reservations, but they do take a one hour call-ahead. We had a large party (9 people) so we wanted to make sure to get our names in early. We discovered this when my friend called ahead two hours in advance. He was told to call back an hour before we were planning on arriving. When he did so and hour later, the employee on the other end told him that call-ahead was not allowed for parties of 6 or more, directly contradicting what the first employee had said. The employee remained certain of this policy even after numerous polite but incredulous questions about this policy. Despite the lack of call-ahead for our party, we decided to try anyway. When we arrived, the place was totally packed (it was a Friday night, so to be expected). To my dismay, the first thing I saw upon getting to the reception area was a sign that explicitly stated that parties of NINE or fewer could call ahead an hour! AAAAGH! So frustrating. I explained what had happened to the gentleman behind the desk. To make matters worse, the gentleman then gave us a condescending description of their call-ahead policy as stated on the placard I just read. I told him whoever talked to us on the phone was misinformed about the policy. He said the wait is an hour because we have *such a large party,* then offered to split us into multiple tables to reduce our wait time to 45 minutes. I asked if they could do anything for us, because we *did* call ahead, but the employee refused to take our name. The gentleman refused. He expectantly asked us again for our names, but I was so fed up I just walked out. This was not an appropriate response. A more convincing apology beyond ""sorry, there's nothing I could do"" would have been nice. Perhaps a promise to better educate the staff about their own policies. Because the call-ahead issue wasn't our fault (it was the bj's fault), other restaurants with sane customer service policies would bump a party up on the list to at the very least significantly reduce wait time. I have heard the the food here is good, so I'd be willing to try it again and amend my review. But until I get some sort of apology for the horrendous customer service, I will not be coming back."
Jim A.,"Mountain View, CA",0,19,1,1.0,8/29/2015,"Having been to a few good BJ restaurants, we were extremely disappointed with this one. The appetizer plates and main plates were extremely dirty for all 3 of us. Food was cold and bland. Very disappointing..."
Mark E.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,375,190,2.0,10/15/2014,"we had dinner here the other night with a large group (but it seems like most of the diners there were in large groups). it was just ok. my burger was pretty good but the service wasnt great. i asked for a beer right before i got my burger but had to cancel it when i was done with  the burger and my beer still hadn't arrived. one of the people on our party didnt get her burger until most of us were almost done. i mean, i know that there are mistakes made but, come on, you guys should be prepared for this."
James A.,"Avondale, AZ",9,99,42,5.0,8/5/2013,"Wedge salad was off the chain. Then the 12oz ribeye (rare) came out! Gotta get these steaks still bleeding, the meat just melts in your mouth! Waitress was very attentive and was johnny on the spot.  I love the setup of this BJ's. Huge 30 -  40ft ceilings? All the BJ's in Phoenix are dumps, but this BJ's blew me away, I can't wait to go back. They have a HUGE bar to get liquored up and get your swerve on."
Meggan T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/10/2012,"This is a new location (open for maybe a month now) and so I will try it one more time in three months and i hope by then things have improved. Pros:  Location, Ambiance, Food is Decent.  Cons: Service.  The bar took a while to make and deliver drinks. The waitress got two of our orders wrong.  One of the burgers was well done when the person in our party ordered medium rare and my order was completely wrong.  The waitress brought me a calzone and I ordered Gluten-Free Pizza.   Under most circumstances I would have just went with it, but gluten makes me miserably ill and I had been very specific. I had to wait 25 minutes for my actual order and by then my party was done eating.  I wound up asking for my order to be boxed up. When we got the check, there were no apologizes and nothing was comped or offered. I worked in the service industry for 5 years and this was really just unacceptable.   I really want to love this new place and so I'll try it out in 3 months and hopefully their service will have improved dramatically.  But in the meantime, if you do try this place.... Set your expectations very low. Honestly, there are a lot of really great resturants in the area, so I recommend going somewhere else.  P.S.  It wasn't only our table with issues. I had heard two other people around me complaining and poor service seems to be the status quo."
Arash S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,57,7,4.0,11/2/2014,"I see people complain about the service, but we had a good experience. The food was good quality, the waiter wasn't trying to push drinks, which was nice. Some seats in the bar area don't face a TV, which can be annoying if you're trying to watch a game."
Cecilia T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/18/2016,First time being at Bjs and it was the worst experience ever. The customer service from the waiter was horrible. We had to keep reminding him orders and who they belonged to. He even disappeared for long periods of time. Also my food was burned and salty. I will not be returning to this restaurant I was really upset with the service.
Patty L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2013,"Gorgeous place. Great Olympic TV. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!!! First and LAST time I will ever go to this location. We went for the the USC v. Notre Dame football game. Called 2 weeks in advance to make sure they would be playing the game full screen and double checked with them the night before. We get there for the game and they have it on quarter screen with other games that no is watching. But said after the UCLA v Stanford game was over (about half time) they would switch to full screen. The ENTIRE bar section was there for the USC v Notre Dame game except for ONE customer wanted the Laker game on. The management because of that ONE customer would no longer change the game to full screen even though there are other TVs they could have put the laker game on. We spent $200+ that night on food and drinks for only 3 people. Complained numerous times to the staff, asked to speak with a manager several time, but a manager would never come talk to us.  This was BY FAR the WORST restaurant experience/customer service experience I have EVER had.  I HIGHLY recommend NOT going there."
Heather H.,"Pasadena, CA",64,147,,4.0,7/2/2014,"Great atmosphere, the building is phenomenal.  Food is always good.  Can be a little crowded sometimes, so plan for a wait on weekends.   Love there small bites starters.  Try the Berry cider for the cider fans.  Like tasty and refreshing  especially in the coming hot  Summer months. Add a fresh baked  cookie smothered in melting ice cream... you can't get any better than that."
Amy Z.,"Rosemead, CA",19,21,7,3.0,6/16/2015,"Came here on a Tuesday at 7. Didn't get seated till 8. They said it's because it's game night. That's okay. Order our food at 8:10. The beer we ordered came out wrong and we waited over 30 minutes for our food. It is now 8:40 and when we asked our waitress how long it will take for our food to come. She said,""we are busy so it will take a while."" Ummm... Okay, why did you even seat us to begin with if your kitchen can't handle the workload ?! This is ridiculous and I am HANGRY (hungry + angry)"
Deb T.,"Pasadena, CA",343,647,73,5.0,12/6/2012,"Holy moly!!! WOWOWOWOW! I just love the decor! This is seriously one of the classiest BJ's I have ever been to. For a new location, the service and the food were excellent! I was really excited to see that this restaurant was opening because its a great alternative to the Yard House, which is a bit pricey. I love that I can walk to dinner, and home, so I have an excuse to eat and drink without feeling sick. The big screen is just PHENOMENAL! If you want to see a game, have a seat at the bar and get ready to be mesmerized. I can't wait to go back!"
Brenda D.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,345,89,4.0,3/14/2013,"What is there to say about a chain like BJ's that hasn't already been said about all thousand of them.... They are all pretty much the same. American food with a lot of beer.  However, This location is gorgeous! Having been a bank in it's former life, this particular location (located right on Colorado in Old Town) is nothing short of grandiose and very classic feeling. I love it just for the look of it. Lots of gorgeous wood and very high ceilings. Definitely worth dropping in for a quick peek. Mind you however, that they don't validate for those who parked in the Paseo parking lot. Valet is available but is still about $7 w/validation from the restaurant. Much more without the validation."
Alisha F.,"Brea, CA",13,40,,4.0,10/23/2014,"This was my first time visiting this BJ's location and they didn't disappoint. When I go to my usual location in Cerritos, I always order the angel hair classico so I ordered it here too. As always, it was delicious and the garlic bread that comes with it tastes great. Also, the server was friendly. Definitely coming back again."
Rob R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,22,,2.0,2/3/2013,"First of all, I love the BJs chain. I've gone to most of the nearby locations and have enjoyed myself every time. So naturally, when a BJs was opening in my town, I was eager to become a regular patron. Sadly, I don't think that will be happening anytime soon. I have been there about 4 times since they opened, and all four times, I swore I wouldn't go back.  Here's why: 1. Service has been pretty bad every time. It takes forever for servers to notice you, to check up on you, to bring your food, and to bring your check. The servers are nice and polite, but very slow and not very attentive. In one visit, I was at the bar and ordered a soda. It took about 10 minutes before I could get the bartender's attention to remind her that she never brought out my soda.  2. The food is not very good, or cooked correctly. I ordered a chicken Marsala, the chicken was great, the pasta was undercooked. The server offered to send it back, and I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to replace it. The pizza took way too long to come out (I was on my lunch break from work) and when it did, the cooks forgot to put BBQ sauce on my pizza. Since I didn't have time to wait for another meal to be cooked, I just asked for sauce in a cup, and poured it on top and ate it that way. Other food I have ordered has been cold, undercooked, or just incorrect as well. The last time I went, I just had drinks, because I didn't want to gamble on the food.  3. Parking. They do not validate, which is a big deal since Paseo costs $9.00 to park. Of course, when I ask about validation, the servers have suggested that I just go get validated at Gelsons or Macy's. maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but having an employee tell me to validate at another store without actually shopping there sounds pretty unprofessional to me. I like BJs, I really do, but this location is just poorly managed. It's too bad, because the location and the layout are amazing. They have the biggest TV I have ever seen in the bar, and the old building is gorgeous. But if I want to eat at BJs, I think I'll just trek down to Burbank or Monrovia instead of walking to this location. It will be worth the drive."
Darren M.,"Arcadia, CA",154,49,13,4.0,11/1/2012,"Went to opening night for BJs in Old Town Pasadena.  Same reliable fare, but in a really cool setting.  This is, I believe, a converted bank turned jewelry mart, with the beautifully-detailed carved ceiling, dramatic columns reaching up to the ornately-designed crown mouldings, and the overall ambiance of a 30's speakeasy.  Much more character than any other BJs I've been to.   The food is consistently good - what you expect from BJs.  The wings appetizer was perfectly crispy; loved the wedge salad with lots of blue cheese; and the kids loved the pizzas.  Of course, the pazookie was the pinnacle of the evening. On the negative side - parking - there is nothing really close.  They are not, I believe, part of the Paseo Colorado so they do not validate for them.  They have parking across the street which is a bit of a walk.  We were told that they would have valet service which will start very soon and will be a respectable $3.00 or $4.00. We will be back!"
Tish N.,"Los Angeles, CA",431,287,23,4.0,12/15/2012,"I traditionally don't review chains but I had a good experience here. After an unfortunately snafu at a nearby bar, we decided to stick with something familiar. We were told we could seat ourselves for happy hour. Brandon came soon after and took our orders. He was amazing. He made our dining experience a good one. He was attentive and polite.  We got the sliders and wedges. I had the   pomegrante sunrise and le bew got a beer. The food was fresh and hot."
Damaris B.,"Napa, CA",151,10,5,1.0,12/4/2015,"Worst service I've ever received. They didn't check up on us once, we got our entrees and we never got out appetizers. We had to ask twice about it and nothing. We had to try and stop multiple waiters and still no help. We had asked for extra condiments and they brought them when we were literally done with our meals. Never got our appetizers. Definitely not coming back here again nor recommending this location to others."
Vvn W.,"Van Nuys, CA",63,546,30,3.0,11/23/2012,"This BJ's is brand spanking new.  When I first came here for dinner, it couldn't be more than 1 week old.  While I like the new restaurant smell, I anticipated a few wrinkles to be ironed out. Both the location and the interior were amazing.  It can't be better located on the busy Colorado Blvd. and the interior reminded me of a neo-classic banking institution.  It was very clean and ultra busy. While the food and service were good, I can't help but noticed a whole rash of servers in training...I mean they were everywhere!  They all gathered in one spot, which was very odd.  There were way many more servers than there were customers.  I sat at the main aisle and it was busy from the time I sat down to the time I left.  In fact I couldn't avoid being sideswiped even if I tried. I had the fish n' chips that night and although I really like the huge flaky pieces of white fish, the beer batter itself was pretty greasy and too much.  The batter almost distracted the taste of the fish itself.  The fries that came with the entree tasted frozen.   The service that night was just okay but I had trouble keeping track of who our main server was since different people arrived at the table bringing food, filling up water glasses, and bringing the bill. Overall it's not a bad place; in fact it can be the place to meet up with friends or just to hang out.  BJ's needs to work out a few kinks."
D. R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/12/2015,"I have never been to the Pasadena Bj's before and probably will not go again. Tonight I decided I would place a curbside order, placed then when to pick-up and could not find the curbside parking that I was told to park at. I called and was told parking was bad at their location, something about a bus stop in front of building couldn't park there, but they would tell me where to park for 90 minutes free and I could come inside to get my order. I was in no mood for that and made up story why I couldn't come in. Found parking on street and they finally said they would come bring order. I am very upset because they should not say they have curbside delivery if they really want you to come inside, felt like bait and switch to me. I will say the girl that came out was polite, and my meal was good, a star for server and cook."
Liz H.,"Norwalk, CA",0,12,3,3.0,2/4/2015,"I love BJ's but most of the time I have to wait a long time either to eat there, or when I order to go. People are friendly but I don't like to wait that long."
