Michelle D.,"Glendale, CA",66,103,180,4.0,11/12/2016,"I sat at the table in the bar area for 10 minutes by myself and no one acknowledged me although there were at least four servers passing by me. My friend came about 5 minutes later then finally a server came by. I had to ask her if there was any service here and she was the one going to service us.  Anyway, we got our order and it came in good time. We had asked if she can get the soccer game from the smaller screen to the bigger one. She said that people had requested the football game so it's on the bigger screen. Later, the manager came to talk to us. We said it was the qualifying match for the World Cup. She went around the bar to ask if they were watching the football game. The end result was four medium screens which was fair.  The service started off rough but it was smooth sailing there on."
Daisy M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,1,5.0,8/10/2017,Love this place peaceful and happy hour is awesome! Service is great drinks are worth it
Erika O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/20/2017,Our server Ernesto Rafael was super chill and DA MAN. We'll definitely be coming back! Also the pizookies are a MUST.
Mari N.,"Pasadena, CA",33,18,12,1.0,5/3/2017,Just had Bj'S and it was the worst food ever . I ordered the lettuce wrap salad . I was expecting something similar to the yard house.  They gave me more lettuce than chicken . The kids Mac and cheese is straight out from the box . We also ordered fish and chips . They arrived soggy and super salty . I've never been  a fan of BJS but today was definitely the last time .
Sameena R.,"Altadena, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/14/2017,"Great server, good service .....  extremely horrible presentation. It look like the cool threw my omelette from one end of the kitchen to the other and landed it on the plate .... thanks  Yes it's a chain but seriously? On Mother's Day?"
Thor S.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,55,19,1.0,9/16/2016,It's a chain so rule 1 is this: consistency.  Tiny burnt sirloin steak doesn't live up to prior Glendale experiences.  They have a sign out front suggesting we park in the mall (see picture).  But they don't validate.  And they don't tell you that until you're leaving.   The price is higher too.  I will defer to costs on that score but a 12% price increase for less is not good. We will not be back.  Ever.   There are too many good places nearby to suffer through mediocrity and indifference to customer satisfaction.
A. S.,"West Covina, CA",10,38,6,1.0,3/13/2017,"My workplace wanted to place a lunch order here for pick-up and I assumed it would be simple... little did I know that I would be encountering the worst customer service I've had in the Old Town area.  Just calling the restaurant was a bigger chore than it had to be, I was placed on hold for more than 5 minutes when trying to place an order. Then and there, I should have gotten the hint and asked everyone if they wanted something different. Instead I finally got to place an order with a curt employee who constantly asked me ""Is that it?"" after I had already informed him this would be an order for an OFFICE. I hung up the phone thinking that if the customer service was that crummy, the actual food has got to be some degree better. No, it was not.  Major disappointment. Those who ordered salads complained of missing advertised ingredients and general distasteful greens. A salad that looks luxurious and gourmet on the menu more accurately resembled something you would pick up at an off-brand liquor store in a run-down neighborhood. In addition, they forgot to add fries that are included with sandwiches and burgers. Worst of all, they neglected to produce one entire entree. Needless to say, we will not be patrons at this specific BJ's ever again and I highly suggest you dine somewhere else."
William L.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,2,,1.0,12/6/2017,"I was walking past it on my lunch break and saw their happy hour sign out front on the sidewalk. The deal that caught my eye was the burger and fries for $6. When I walked in and asked about it, the 3 people at the front counter had no idea and asked me to walk them outside and show them where i saw that. So then we walked outside and I showed them. They then told me the burger was really basic and that they had a better Wednesday burger deal so I said sure. They told me to sit down anywhere in the bar area which was pretty empty and I sat there for 5 minutes with employees walking by and not acknowledging me. So since I was on my lunch break, I walked up to the 3 people at the front counter and asked if someone was coming and they looked at each other and was like ""who's working that section?"" And then suggested I sit at the bar instead but I decided to leave since no one I encountered knew what was going on."
Christine C.,"Torrance, CA",4,91,4,5.0,12/5/2017,Just eaten there a few times. I cook a lot. Very good food and service. You get a lot of food for a decent price. It can get loud and crowded but that's common in a popular restaurant. People like it. I think the one in Lakewood is less crowded. It's really crowded on Mothers Day. Nice salads too.
Steven C.,"University Park, Los Angeles, CA",347,47,35,2.0,4/26/2017,"This is just a BJs so I don't know what to say really. The beer selection is alright, but I am not really a big fan of their own brews. I find them a little bland and unadventurous which makes sense for a massive chain that needs mass appeal. I don't have a TV so sometimes I come here to watch sports. Everything is overpriced and indifferently cooked. Nothing on the menu is particularly interesting. It's a BJs, it is what it is! If you are in the mood for deep dish pizza and you don't mind overpaying for a basic pizza, go for it. Otherwise, do a little research and find a place with passion and a unique take.  The worst part of this location, and perhaps all locations, is the happy hour, which is really lame. 1 hour off of already overpriced beer and cocktails. It brings them down from ridiculously overpriced, to moderately overpriced. But it still enrages me to purchase a single beer for the price of a six pack. When you do this in a bar there is something else you are paying for and for me it is the opportunity to watch a sports event of some sort.  The service is usually pretty good and the waiters friendly. They aren't fast but they aren't slow either. I can usually find seating in the bar area even when things are busy."
Jodie Grace G.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,13,5,2.0,6/2/2017,This place is decent. They just have the worst customer service ever. They took a while with our order.  They should improve the customer service honestly.
Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",756,493,2422,5.0,8/3/2016,"I decided to come to this BJ's again despite my previous experience and I have to say that the waitress I had made the experience wonderful.  I brought the kids out for lunch and since I was going to be at church later in the day in Pasadena, I decided to eat in Pasadena.  I asked my daughter if she wanted steak and she said YES!  (Thank God shes a carnivore!!) So I decided to try out BJ's and not kill my wallet by taking my 4 year old to Ruths Chris or something lol.  We were seated right away.  The waitress was totally on top of things.  My daughter got a sirloin steak, medium - of course it has to be a little bloody to taste great,  my son got chicken tenders, and I went for a full rack of baby back ribs.  She brought out drinks right away, and brought out the food fairly quick too!  Thats usually important to me cause when you have a one year old and a four year old at a restaurant that get bored fairly quick, it gets chaotic fairly quick, next thing you know dishes are flying, and people are going deaf, it can get pretty wild.  The food was delicious! I tried my dughters steak and it was REALLY good... I almost jacked if from her lol.  My son loved his fries but not so much the chicken tenders, and my ribs were pretty freakin good!  As I mentioned, overall, everything went really well!   'Just when I thought you couldnt do anything dumber...  you do something like this.... AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!!""   -dumb & dumber"
Nila C.,"Glendale, CA",26,113,48,1.0,10/15/2016,"Today was my second disappointment at BJ's. I came here a month ago with my husband the service was so slow we had to cancel our desert. Today, I decided to go back with some friends. Again, the service was slow, but the thing that  was the worst is that they gave me a ""dirty' straw in my water... totally gross.... I don't even want to think why it was dirty. Plus a mistake in my check, but this is understandable because this can happen in any place ."
Richard A.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,21,,4.0,2/2/2017,"I'm not gonna start this wig a great anecdote. I'm gonna start with a straight diatribe about this particular BJ's. I M not going to complain about the consistently inconsistent service. As someone who has been here a half to a full dozen or more times. I am not bothered that my order is wrong EVERY time I order here.  I mean it makes sense that my appetizer comes after my dinner. My salad can once in a while miss ingredients or be a completely different salad. Those things happen. You serve me the wrong drinks? I'll laugh it off. But, to have something be completely and totally incorrect EVERY time I come here had to be an all time noteworthy description of ineptitude.  I'm talking epic consistency of messing up orders. Lactose intolerant? Cheese bread for you. Peanut allergies? Cashew chicken (exaggeration but you get the ideas!). I don't get it. Can't explain it. But, it's damn consistent that your order is going to be wrong, forgotten, or given to the people next to you.  I'm not complaining about the servers. They are nice and always apologetic. I'm not mad at the cooks for missing my orders. I'm not mad at the hostesses who try to sit 2 or 3 couples at the same table. I have decided this comprehensive a show had to be the top.  Management doesn't manage. Doesn't check on things. In fact they are uninvolved and basically apathetic.  Perfect example. Our appetizer was served after dinner. Seems simple. The server told his manager. She never came by to check on us to make sure the order got fixed. Never saw her/him follow-up. In fact, the SECOND time they forgot the appetizer it still wasn't fixed.  No my friends. This isn't a institutional problem it's a leadership problem. Small things are let to become big things. I've never seen such a disjointed chain restaurant in my life.  If the food weren't good (and it's pretty darn good) I would give terrible ratings. But you'll get a good meal. It's just you better have huge patience and the ability to laugh at horror shows.  On the bright side. Nice decor here too! Enjoy the show. Lol Update: Jan 2017 Been back a few times. Seems like they're getting the hint and working hard to get more staff. The managers hustle as hard as the staff. The food is still pretty good. Mistakes happen and they try to fix it. So far I've had one excellent server and one ok one.  It's improving. (You can do it clap!)"
Karie F.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",260,600,450,2.0,2/16/2017,"Big disappointment! The menu here is so bountiful, pictures so alluring! Too bad the quality of the food is NOTHING like what you see or read about in the menu. Lets start out with the drinks. I ordered the Raspberry iced tea. It was more like Raspberry syrup with a splash of tea. It was so weak! We ordered the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. They were disgusting! Had an old taste to them, like they microwaved some old egg rolls that were made a day before...The ingredients inside were undetectable. Some kind of mashed up mess with a few visual hints of avocado. The dipping sauce made them somewhat edible. I ordered a dish (don't remember the name), shrimp with spinach and quinoa and tomatoes. It was decent but would have been better if the shrimp were grilled or sauteed. It was like they took some shrimp cocktail type of shrimp and threw them in the dish. The Poozokie was flavorful but so thin. I haven't had one of these in years, this was nothing like I remembered. The cookie was spread so thin you could barley even scrape a piece from the tin. Food was just an epic fail on this visit. Service was good and friendly but the food and drink fell short! Not even sure I would come back to this location when in the area."
Rachel W.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,2,4.0,9/16/2016,"WOW. Is all I have to say. We were staying about a block away at the Sheraton and accidentally stumbled upon this gem.  First of all the location is great, it's downtown and was a short walk from the hotel. Perfect distance to go enjoy dinner and a few drinks without worrying about parking.  Second of all the atmosphere is really unique. The brewery is located in an old bank that really makes for an interesting dining experience. The food was great, I had the French dip and fries. I also tried a few of their speciality lemonades/teas and was not disappointed. The meat was tender, the au jus was perfectly done and not too salty like many other places. Overall the food, location, and atmosphere are five stars. I had to take one star off because both times dining here we were waiting too long for our food and check. I see a lot of other negative one star reviews and although it was a hassle it's worth at least checking the food out once, if not at this location try another!"
Kay M.,"Toronto, Canada",0,21,1,1.0,10/3/2017,"Ordered a side of fruit and the bowl was not fresh. Soggy blueberries that were not cold, seemingly scraped off of warm food (savory food after taste with some sort of sweet liquid or syrup on grapes). Convinced they scraped this fruit off of a plate and sent it out. :("
Taufan R.,"Alhambra, CA",29,77,62,2.0,1/5/2017,"Went here with my wife and kids. Seems not to busy, but no hostess. Had to wait 6mins to be seated... it wasnt even busy. Got sat, ordered, food arrived. No utensils? Ordered, beats salad with no beats?? Interesting. Ate with our hands. So we had to  call out waiter for utensils. He only gave us 2 ..... wait , there were 4 of us. So that means we had to share utensils and the knapkins... very conservative... . Got calamari, but very soggy... uggh!! Not cool. While i was drinking, just realized that my glass was cracked and chipped on the rim. Good thing i was using a straw but hopefully nothing went inside my stomache. I like BJs resto, the beers and decor, but please pay attention to the details and service. These do matter the most. Overall was very disappointing. We love the alcohol though..."
Joyce C.,"Arcadia, CA",94,15,1,1.0,6/11/2017,"I wish there was an option on Yelp to give no stars. Our waiter's name was Roman (the name that appeared on the check, but who knows if he's logged onto someone else's account to avoid blame). So here's a physical description of him: Skinny blonde white boy, possibly around 5'6"" with a shit ton of sass. He should be fired. To be honest, I do not know why he was even there tonight. We sat down around 10pm, and we didn't even get our order in until maybe around 11pm-ish, and that's me trying to make him sound better. The waiter blamed the new computer system, he showed us how it was malfunctioning. But there was no troubleshooting. He wouldn't pull out a paper and pen because he says that it's stupid if waiters can't remember people's orders (guess what he forgot). He sat down next to my friends, and when we finally got the order in, he told us that he'll be eating pizookie with strangers a few tables down. He LITERALLY did that, and another half an hour went by without us getting our food. Now I know restaurants have waiters who spit in food, so I just didn't want spit on top of waiting for forever. So I was patient while glaring at this kid waiter. The food finally came, but not all the food. But Roman was gone again. We got a busser to get the remaining food to us. And then Roman's sitting back at that table looking at his hands with the ""strangers"" shining an iPhone light over him and eating more food and drinking more of whatever he had there. The hero amongst us went to find the manager, because her pizookie hadn't come yet, and that's what she was here for. The manager, Richard, confronted the waiter Roman, and said he'd fix our bill. Roman came back and gave sass about the computer forgetting the pizookie. He forgot it, and then blamed the kitchen. No apology. He got the pizookie, said he'd pay for it for all the trouble. Everyone else is done eating and is now waiting for the check. 11:45pm. We don't get our check until 12:00am ish. Yes, we're now literally in a brand new fucking day. Our bill has not been fixed. He split all our checks without asking first. So our hero went to demand the manager honor his word. She's gone for 10 minutes, battling the stubbornness of this restaurant's management. The waiter is there too, claiming he was told by us to split the bill and claiming that none of anything is his fault. The three of them are arguing for these 10 minutes. An estimation of what is probably 12:20am - Ms. Sass Roman gives attitude to our hero, handing her the new bill, and gives more attitude. Never once has he said sorry or anything. We finally get everything figured out, and leave by 12:25/30am of the day after we entered the doors of the BJs in Pasadena. So that's 2.5 hours at a restaurant that was pretty empty. Corporate BJ's, if you need to close stores, start with Pasadena. Or at least train your employees in common courtesy and customer service. And give your employees a damn pad of paper and pen for when your system dies."
Kristin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,5,1.0,8/1/2017,Service was HORRIBLE! Took FOREVER for someone to take order drink and food order and FOREVER for the orders to come out to us. It took about 40 minutes for us to get our food
