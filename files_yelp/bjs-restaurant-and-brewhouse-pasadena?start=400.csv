Clara C.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,57,16,4.0,12/30/2014,"One of the nicer BJ's locations I had the chance of dining at.  Very large interior with high ceilings and gorgeous wood panels. Ordered my usual Mediterranean Pizza. Love the soft thickness of the crust and how they load it with toppings. Seriously, not one bare space on each slice. It is covered in toppings! Also a big fan of their Pazookie and their Smore's dessert. Large enough to share with a few  friends. Location is convenient right near Old Town. Parking may be challenging. They have street parking around the restaurant and across the street."
Eddie R.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",41,110,311,5.0,2/21/2015,We went to dinner here and I ordered.  Tomato and mozzarella salad and the dressing on it was the best I have ever ate and the salad was good to lol but seriously dinner was excellent and I cannot believe how good the dressing was on the salad dressing so if you're ever at BJ's make sure you get the tomato mozzarella salad with the house dressing it looks like chocolate syrup but boy is it good
Nikolas H.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,28,,5.0,6/24/2014,Stopped by for a quick dinner.  Had a great server named Sarah.  The corn fritters are the best.  Can eat them all day.  Cynthia the manager recognized me as a regular customer and stopped by to make sure everything was great.  Love the big TV with world cup on.  Service was excellent.
Charity G.,"Shadow Hills, CA",4,23,8,4.0,10/29/2012,"I'm guilty of frequenting this place.  I'm on day 3 of my pizzokie and beer diet. Here's the low down: 1. Servers are still on training.  This explains why they are super chipper and their timing is still off (ex: giving the menu and as when she pulls her hand from the menu  asks our table if we already know what we want; puts pizza down the table and asks us right away if we're enjoying the pizza; the spoon is literally halfway between the soup bowl and my mouth and the server asks me if i'm still working on my soup).  Give it another week and the seasoned servers will leave the new ones to swim and float on their own. 2.  Food is consistent in quality.  I can't complain with that. 3. Place seems oddly louder than what it should be.  It's prolly because of the super high ceiling. 4. Tables and booths are pretty crammed next to each other... which means to say you'll be passing by most people when you enter/ leave. 5.  Great lunch menu.  They have unlimited soup and salad for $7!  Order your next soup of liking when they give you your desired first soup for perfect timing.  Their tomato bisque is where it's at. 6.  Iced tea is $2.75.  Draft beer during lunch is $3.50.  You bet I'm not ordering iced tea.  7. Yes, they validate parking."
Jaime E.,"Sacramento, CA",48,44,,3.0,7/27/2014,The building is really nice and the food was ok. Service was a bit slow and it wasn't even full. The food at the BJs in Huntington Beach is much better than this one in my opinion. The thing that turned me off the most is that they don't validate parking even though the structure is above the garage. I'll just stick going to the Arcadia location or a different one.  If I do come here I'll just come much earlier when the mall is open so I can validate my parking pass at Macy's. lol
Victor C.,"Pasadena, CA",207,179,674,3.0,5/4/2013,"BJ's Pasadena location very unique. High ceilings and 150"" Panasonic TV...   The food is ok. Nothing great.  The appetizers are bland and taste like they had been warmed over.  I would rate it 2 stars, but our server was very attentive.  Also, the ac blows pretty good in many places, and it can get very loud with the stone floors and solid walls.  The beer selection is good, but nothing out fo the ordinary. For a great beer selection Yard House or Slater's 50/50."
Kelsey K.,"Simi Valley, CA",64,11,9,5.0,6/8/2014,Love avocado egg roles yummy :) also the strawberry splash tastes like candy! So good! Waiter was attentive nice personable :)
Cheryl V.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,192,,4.0,6/3/2013,"I've been to a number of BJ's restaurants in Southern California, but the husband and I decided it was time to go to the one in Pasadena, since we recently moved to the neighborhood.  They don't serve my favorite kind of pizza, or beer, or have the best service of any pizza restaurant I've been to, but their food is consistent, so when I'm craving a bready pizza with no frills and a glass of wine, it's a place to consider. Now, BJ's has more on its menu than pizza and beer.  They have salads and pastas and flatbreads and appetizers (wings, bruschetta, etc.).  They also have a sports bar atmosphere.  Because we were searching for late night happy hour, we ended up at BJs.  Parking is either in the garage below or street parking (we found a spot on the street nearby, probably because it was so late and on a Sunday). Everything we ordered was off of the happy-hour menu -- featuring ""happy hour-sized"" food.  Wings, deep dish pizza, spinach and artichoke dip, and sliders.  Everything tasted great and was exactly what we were hoping for.  The beer is cold and the wine is good (and cheap.... $6 for a glass of La Crema Pinot Noir).  The service was also friendly and fast. I love the ambience in this place... I wonder what used to be in this space before this pizza chain took over.  Will go back!"
V. S.,"Pasadena, CA",27,75,26,5.0,9/19/2014,"Hands down - best BJs. The space is in the historic jewelry mart. I love sitting in the center of the room in the bar area, even when I am there for dinner because the ceiling is an experience it itself. This is also a great place to watch a game because they have a huge screen with a gorgeous wooden mantle around it with alcohol bottles displayed. I always recommend this location to friends and family. I like the large bathroom with lots of stalls. Too bad the restaurant doesn't validate for parking at Paseo. I will be back!"
Gerald W.,"Burbank, CA",21,157,23,3.0,9/16/2014,"Typical bj's the service was a little on the slow side I will admit, but not horrible."
Henry F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",6,69,319,2.0,9/13/2014,"I go to BJ's all the time and love there food and tech products. However, this BJ is just bad I like to find the good in a business and I just can't find it in this location!!! The service is horrible from the hostess to our server. I gave it a two star because the food was good when it got to the table about 40 min after we were seated. I gave three different employees my loyalty number and never got it recorded until I pushed them to pay online. The manager did give us a free salad because it was never made until we asked about it."
Bus G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,1.0,6/11/2015,What has happened to bjs? I used to go all the time my fav place now it sucks. Tonight all my favorite dishes where no longer on the menu wtf? I ordered appetizers mushrooms were cold and not cooked. Reordered a new one and still not cocked and flavorless. Tortilla soup was good but drink (Long Island)!was horrible no taste. Fish tacos were dry so i didn't eat most and ordered a pizza. Can't go wrong with pizza. Waiter was horrible waited forever for service and check which was incorrect 3 times. Charged for bad mushrooms twice and didn't give us a discount. Will never go back to my once favorite place . At least not to pasadena. And one more thing you don't validate wtf? People have to park but you don't validate? Why would anything want to come there? Management needs to be fired as this location is a dud.
Elizabeth U.,"South Pasadena, CA",113,19,3,1.0,2/19/2014,"So this is going to be lengthy, but I have to say something. I made a reservation here for my birthday last week for a party of 16, Sunday night at 6 o'clock. I was really excited to try BJ's for the first time because I had heard so many great things, but unfortunately my visit wasn't as great as others'.  Let me just start by saying that the location is great, and the restaurant itself is beautiful, and designed very well. There is a great selection of beers on the menu also, but the service is a complete and utter disaster.  Our server was very nice at first, and took all of our orders accordingly, however, for some of the orders he didn't write a single word down. We waited about twenty minutes before getting our drinks, but that's not even where it gets bad.  A single food runner comes waking around with a burger that has NOTHING on it. Just a patty between two buns and starts going person to person asking who ordered it. Shocking, no one ordered that. So she goes back. She comes back two minutes later with the same burger, and again, goes person to person asking who ordered that same burger. Again, no one claimed it. So at this point it had breached half an hour and no one had gotten their food yet. The restaurant wasn't even that packed, so why was the food taking so long to begin with? So finally, our food starts to come out, however, the food is coming out one single order at a time. So basically, another 20 minutes goes by before only three people have their food at the table. As if this night couldn't get any worse, all of our orders went back to the kitchen at least three times because they were all wrong. Need I remind you, we are not a very tough crowd to please. Fries were cold, burgers were made wrong, burgers came out without lettuce on them, and meat wasn't cooked right. The meat was either way too raw, or completely burnt to crisp. So finally after we had complained a few times, the manager came to visit our table. He was very nice, and very understanding, but he didn't do much to mend the fact that my birthday dinner has now gone to total crap. Everyone was completely unhappy. I felt the worst for my brother. He ordered a burger, and on the picture it showed bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce and meat. It looked like a pretty good burger. However, when he finally got his burger, it had absolutely nothing on it. Not even lettuce. And the manager proceeded to ask him if he asked for lettuce on the burger in the first place. On the description it even says it comes with lettuce! Are you kidding me?! So my brother points out the picture and says, ""I'm sorry, I thought I ordered that burger."" The manager then tells him that the burger isn't properly shown in the picture. That he would have to ask for all the extras on the burger in the first place. So eventually, my brother just sucked it up and ate his completely bland and burnt burger.  At the end of the night the manager did say that all the burgers that were returned to the kitchen were going to be on him. Coincidentally, that was more than half the burgers that were ordered that night. He also gave us all a coupon for a free Pizookie anytime we wanted to return to any other BJ's. I highly doubt that any of us will return again.  In summation, and without exaggeration, this probably had to be the worst dinner and the worst service that I have ever had in my life. Most of us didn't even finish our food, and we didn't ask for boxes to take home either. I really wish that my first experience was better, and I wish that it hadn't been on my birthday. It was just horrible."
Edwin H.,"Glendale, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/17/2015,"You don't have to be in the restaurant business to know this place is severely understaffed and mismanaged. Went there on a Sunday (only 10 minute wait to get seated...which usually means not super busy) with the NBA finals game on their TV's. We sat towards the back of the restaurant and after waiting 10-15 to even get acknowledged, I figured out the waiter (who seemed overwhelmed and over his head) had about 12 tables to tend to by himself. So I spent the rest of the time there convincing myself that it was not his (Nicholas) fault and it was the management that didn't care about customers. 1) ordered drinks and appetizers and kids food. 2) Appetizers showed up, but we had no plates or forks/ napkins 3) asked for them, and he apologized and said he would get them right away. 4) Kids meals showed up 5-10 minutes later, but we still had no napkins/ forks. More apologies. 5) Finally done eating, he asked if we wanted anything else and I ordered a Pizooki that the kids had been looking forward to since we got there. 6) 15 minutes later, he walked up to our table with our check. I asked about the Pizooki, and he seemed baffled and surprised that we had not received it yet. 7) After checking the register, he apologized and said it was never ordered. Since it was past kids bed time, we asked him not to bother and paid and left. I think there was one more apology! I looked on the receipt to see if I could take a survey or something about our experience, but they are smart enough not to give you that option!! The one star I gave them was for the décor and the awesome ceiling. So if you want to see nice architecture and an amazing ceiling, this is the place for you. I apologize if you find this review not to you liking. I promise to do better next time! I sincerely apologize."
Pettra T.,"Los Angeles, CA",349,180,27,2.0,9/15/2014,"Disappointed again ....tried to order the new steak, sold out. Tried to downgrade to the rib eye, sold out.  #boooo"
Jonathan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",455,184,91,3.0,1/24/2013,"This is the newest BJ's I've been to, I think it's only been around for like barely a year. I could definitely tell in the food. Sometimes it takes a while for a spot to get in it's groove, I could say the same about the one in La Puente. Early on, it had it's issues, so maybe in time this one will improve also. The pizza we had was ok, hard to mess up too much, but it was lacking a bit in the toppings department.  The hot wings came out a little soggy. Maybe I should have requested extra crispy. But, the beer, as always, delightful. I'm a big fan of the Piranha Pale Ale, crisp with a hoppy floral finish! The biggest problem we had was that there were these gnats lingering around the taps. The bartender said that they were coming from the drains. That's pretty disgusting and annoying. They need to do something about those drains!"
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",561,1194,627,4.0,11/4/2012,"Possibly my favorite BJ's of them all It is practically in my backyard Usually, I rank chains at a 1-3 star rating because each one of them can't really separate themselves that much for me to think they are better than 3 stars if they are top notch. This place is an exception even though it is only one star higher I would give any other chain The location  This BJ's is quite large and it ended up moving into a bank and a jewelry store. Most of the molding is all original. The staff mentioned that some had to retouched. Fun fact is that the bank vault is located below the bar.  The staff is pretty cool i came on the first day of operation and offered a couple slices of pizza from a server walking the grounds. SWEET! My buddy and I hung out at the bar area chatting it up with several of the bartenders who were them awesome. Even though we pretty much became the best of friends with each one of them, they were still well aware of the other patrons running dry of booze running whole length of the bar. That is top notch service! Would I be back? Yes, I will be DUKE! Like the great Richard Marx said ""I'll be right here waiting for you"""
Rick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",354,81,63,3.0,2/27/2013,"Recently visited this location for lunch, during the week; I would imagine on the weekend and in the evening, it gets very busy. Parking is NOT validated by BJ's, as they are not part of the Paseo Colorado group, regardless of the fact that they are physically IN the complex, but whatever. Helpful tip: If you go around the corner to Gelson's grocery store, they have a self validation machine near the entrance; problem solved; not sure what the deal is with BJ's not being a part of the whole thing. During lunch (late lunch), the place was really empty, which is what I prefer, since BJ's in general tends to get really loud and douchey at night or when a sports event is on. No thanks; I like to be able to hear my meal conversations! I had a salad (and have had tons of other items at other BJ's locations), and the quality was just as I've come to expect from this chain - solid and tasty. No complaints from me food-wise. The service was a tad slow and toward the end of our lunch, our waiter was pretty much non-existent; maybe he fell asleep somewhere waiting for more customers to show up. That was annoying, but when he DID come to the table, he was pleasant. Not sure what the building originally was, but the interior of this location is much different than other BJ's. It must have been a bank or old hotel lobby or something - uber-vaulted ceiling and architecture definitely NOT the norm for this restaurant chain. We liked it, and likely will return again, as BJ's is always a decent go-to. Three stars because I had to get my parking stub validated elsewhere, which was inconvenient and lame."
Trevor W.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,174,19,4.0,1/5/2013,"This place may be billed as a deep dish pizza and brewhouse bar/restaurant, but the fact of the matter is you go for one reason, the pizookie. Literally, the best dessert ever. Yeah, you may go for dinner first and it will be all right, but leave space for dessert. I'm pretty sure the Pizookie fell from heaven it's so good. It's simple really: a mini deep dish pizza tin that they bake a peanut butter cookie in and drop 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top of it. It comes out piping hot and still soft.  Soooo good. Even better, if you want to feed a group, they do giant pizookies as well for a very good price. If you're looking to watch the game, you'll find plenty of tv's in the bar of this beautiful space, I'm pretty sure this was a bank in a prior incarnation and honestly, it's way too nice for a BJ's but it's better than a vacancy."
Ashley B.,"San Diego, CA",40,18,,2.0,2/24/2013,"This is by far the worst BJ's I have ever eaten at. The kitchen staff needs a serious upgrade.  Food 1 star. Service was ok, therefore I rated them a 2 star Wedge cut fries were the best part of the meal...."
