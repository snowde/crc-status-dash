Brandi P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/29/2015,"My service tonight was horrible! I waited 20 minutes for cold food!! The horrible waitress, Rebecca, stated that the kitchen was backed up & our food would be out shortly. I was understanding until I waited close to  20 minutes & our food came out cold!!! Also, I witnessed others people food coming out ASAP that arrived after I did! Not to mention, that the food was delivered by Rebecca ~ herself! I also witnessed someone who looked like a manager visiting other tables, glance at me, & turn around & walk away!!  I can only accept the fact that our food sat somewhere as she helped others!!!! I will never visit BJ's again!!!!! I wish I could give this place 0 stars!"
Mohamad T.,"Upland, CA",2,16,1,4.0,9/14/2014,"Tonight was a rough night at the Pasadena BJ's. I will spare you the Details of the troubles and give big props for the manager Ashley who did not try to deny the issues and recognized the need to solve them.  Then Christianne came over and really made us feel like they knew the issues and were working hard to get everything right.  We left thinking that the place is in the right hands. Every place has a bad night, but it is the management that determines if it is consistently bad, or if the place is moving things forward in a positive direction. All in all I think Ashley and Christiianne are committed to making this Bj's live up to the reputation of the others. Good work ladies!!!!     We'll be back."
Imran S.,"Queens, NY",125,113,47,4.0,3/28/2014,"Chain restaurants usually have standards set that needs to be held and for as long as they uphold it then I have no problems with the place whatsoever. This was an even better looking restaurant than the ones in the OC. Nice warm ambience, surprisingly great decor, and service was superb. The food tasted great as always. The best part is dessert and of course; the infamous Pazookie! Order a small for taste appreciation and portion control ; it's rich and tasty so savor that last taste on your palate. Great spot to go with the family and / or friends."
Madalena T.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,144,307,4.0,6/24/2014,"My favorite thing to order here is their California burger. This burger is in my top 3 list of best burgers I've ever had. I like how they toast the sourdough bread and stuff this burger with avacados, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayonnaise. Soo flavorful with each bite. And it comes with a side of their amazing potato wedges. Add a glass of their Jeremiah Red Ale on tap and you've got the perfect meal! I like going to BJ's and sitting in their bar area to eat, drink, and watch Monday Night Football or other sports."
David T.,"Burbank, CA",78,327,5,4.0,11/12/2012,"I went here a few weeks ago, probably after they just opened. Food was good and all, but what stood out in this location was how many servers they had! I'm guess that there were many still in training, largely due to the fact that the one that served us was being supervised. It's not every dinner night when there are people constantly walking by our table, at about the rate of one person every couple seconds. The location of this restaurant is great and the interior is large and bright. And everything went smoothly here. I'd gladly eat here again."
Aidyn K.,"Alhambra, CA",89,60,4,1.0,7/1/2014,Manager called and apologized. He said he would send me a gift certificate to compensate the meal. Three weeks has gone by and I've received nothing in the mail. Don't trust any of the staff at this place.
O. A.,"South Pasadena, CA",6,44,51,3.0,8/4/2014,"My son loves coming here, but he's 15 yrs old.  The ambiance is young, loud, and busy.  The food is OK, not great, not bad either.  The service is what needs work.  The servers have enormous serving sections and don't have a chance to check-in with us customers very often.  They should hire more servers.  I don't recommend you go here if you're in a hurry to catch a movie."
cat c.,"Pasadena, CA",9,106,,4.0,12/17/2012,"Yeah it's a chain, but the foremost reason for visiting BJ's in Pasadena is the gorgeous historic building, the 1924 Curlett and Beelman Security 1st National Bank designed in the Renaissance Revival style. (If you love historic buildings, check out Beelman's art deco style architecture in downtown L.A., such as the Eastern Columbia building on 9th and Broadway.) While you're eating, look up and look down. Many of the interior elements are preserved, including the marble floors, columns, friezes, etc. Spectacular. And the food is good for a chain. When I visited, I had the balsamic glazed chicken and a couple of nicely-concocted drinks from the bar. Our server was excellent and let us linger and chat. I appreciate that BJ's is OK with lingering. We're not allowed to linger enough at restaurants anymore. Bottom line: visit the restaurant because the food is good but, more importantly, visit the 1924 celebrity building in which BJ's is housed."
Dennis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,41,,4.0,12/10/2012,The atmosphere was amazing. Very comfortable booths and a bunch of TV's everywhere. Plus the biggest TV on the west Coast!  They have a huge menu so you are bound to find something you like...  Service was prompt and food was quick.
Peter F.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,2,2.0,10/5/2014,"Frustrating I asked for medium well and I got a microwaved patty it was rubbery and dry it tasted like a burger king burger. It was thrown together quickly cost me 9 odd. It made me wait for a stale microwave burger. What the fuck. How fucking dare you. Staff was courteous, excellent and kind :)"
Raquel L.,"West Covina, CA",25,97,6,4.0,11/8/2012,"I'm just happy that there is a BJ's close to my house! yay! I thought it was a Loehmann's  before? Pros: food is always good, decent prices,  beer, several TV's, and great costumer service.  When I walked in I was greeted by the hosts then our waitress (forget her name) was wonderful. Very attentive. Con's: Its too bright in the bar area...dim the lights a tad! tip: they do not validate there are now validation stations for the Paseo in general at the top of the escalators. Restaurant will no longer validate.  street parking is $1.25 and one hour parking then free after 8 p.m"
Yadi R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/28/2014,"Our food took too long to arrive and by the time it did arrive we could tell it was just sitting in the kitchen because it was cold. A bummer when you order pizza, wings and sliders with fries. At first we were forgiving because it was only 2 waiters in the bar area and it seemed like a busy night, but after the server forgot my water and forgot to put in our beer and dessert orders we are convinced it's the server. I like BJ's and I'll be avoiding this location from now on."
Bud M.,"Los Angeles, CA",614,11,1,4.0,12/5/2012,"This place is beautiful!  It used to be a bank and/or a jewelry store or something, so the interior is really nice.  It looks like Caesar's Palace in there!  Plus, they have a huge selection of taps, unlike many other BJ's, which usually only served their own beer on tap (unless they've changed since I've worked there). It gets 4 stars because it is BJ's, not Mastro's or Ruth's Chris.   I can't go around giving 5 stars to every restaurant with nice interior I see.  :-)"
M M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/13/2014,Extremely slow service. Wait staff very inattentive and food was sub par and overpriced. Definitely avoid on a Saturday night.
Lanise J.,"Altadena, CA",23,87,142,2.0,1/12/2014,"I went Saturday with a friend for happy hour. All I can really say is that the service sucked!!!! we sat in the bar area and had a great view of the big screen. Tell me why it took an hour plus for me to get sliders, while my friend was able to enjoy her food. The waitress didn't even offer to take it off our bill or give us a free desert. People please work on your customer service skills!!!!!!!!!"
Miss J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,42,6,2.0,5/26/2014,"It's so unfortunate that the food at this location was horrible. I ordered a deep dish pizza and it came out mushy, had no crisp to it and tastes just bad. This is not the BJs that I remembered. Sad to say but I don't think I'm ever going back to any BJs again. I paid $20 for a medium, 8 slice pizza...so not worth it."
Pokemon P.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,354,384,4.0,12/8/2012,"Love the new location! Conveniently located the heart of Old Town Pasadena. Great walking distance from the Arclight theatre. Perfect place to hang after the movie.  A+++ on the Skirt Steak & Bleu Cheese flat bread pizza. Service was great and quick!  Food was served hot. Great interior! I'm glad they kept the interior architecture of the old bank decor design. Colorful bar all the liquors you can think of it is on the wall. Giant TV screen! Price was reasonable, but of course could be better, if they listed the beer price on the menu."
Apple S.,"Pasadena, CA",22,22,5,2.0,1/16/2013,"I've been going to BJ's for many years.  I even worked there for 4 years a while back.  This location is brand new and left a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  The spinach artichoke dip, which I hadn't ordered in years, was bland.  I don't know if they've changed that recipe or what.  I ordered the Classic Burger, medium.  It came out well-done and hardly had enough thousand island dressing to make up for the loss in juiciness and flavor in the charred meat. I don't send food back.  I just live and learn, meaning, I won't come here for a burger, again. I'm glad they still have the wedge cut fries.  Those are good.  And I'm glad they don't do the 13 steps of service they used to do.  However, I think their food has gone downhill.  Either that or my taste buds have matured in the past 14 years."
Antonio G.,"Chatsworth, CA",76,272,259,3.0,12/8/2013,"Another place where you'll find me when in town , walking distance from the convention center and after a long working day, nothing tadte better than thier beer and deep pizza"
Stacy P.,"Burbank, CA",2,60,6,1.0,12/5/2013,"The food was horrible, salty and not to mention it took over 30 minutes for the food to come out. I placed an order for pazooki well in advance and waited another 20 minutes and then we decided to just walk out of this restuarant since we were sick of waiting. THEY DONT EVEN VALIDATE!!!!!!"
