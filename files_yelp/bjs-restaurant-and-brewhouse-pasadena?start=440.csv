Michael R.,"Cerritos, CA",1,4,,1.0,8/4/2014,Took a long while for my Mac n cheese to come out and when it came it was cold. I was really hungry and did not want to wait any longer so I just ate. Maybe this place is better during the day I don't know.
harry t.,"Redwood City, CA",14,30,5,5.0,11/29/2012,"Went for the 2nd time to this new location last night.  Fish n Chips came over-fried.  When I asked for a do-over, the manager came and apologized and had it resent.  Did not make me feel bad...brought out a new one that was delicious. PIzza is always good."
Natalie L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",19,280,,2.0,4/5/2014,"I know that this is a chain and I didn't have high expectations, but man the food was not good. I had a horribly overdressed salad. Hubby had a way salty burger ... and believe me, the temptation to make jokes about salty food from a place called BJs is near overwhelming. But I will manage to restrain myself. Although our server was friendly, we got the wrong fries with the burger. If we lived in the area, this would be a place to grab a beer after work and that's about it."
Baron V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,43,4,2.0,7/25/2015,Meh....kinda place that seems like it should be better than it is.  Calamari appetizers were terrible. Hot wings look like they had been boiled and drizzled with tabasco sauce. Potato skins did not look appetizing.  Same goes for onion strings....the food was salty (so you buy more drinks!).  Couldn't finish my guacamole burger and that should not happen!  Oh and they don't validate for parking at Paseo.  Better off going to the Yardhouse or even TGI Fridays!
Angie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,34,8,1.0,2/20/2014,"My server was caralina. Very hard to locate. Also my husband ordered a steak well done.  It came out medium.  When we showed her the steak, her response was that she would take care of it. Well she took care of it by doing nothing!"
Marshal A.,"Hawthorne, CA",80,6,,3.0,11/12/2012,"This is the fanciest BJ's I've ever been to.  I guess, I was too used to the one in Westwood. Went on a Monday night around 730pm and it was busy. MNF was playing and it was an hour + wait so we found a table around the bar area.   The server was polite and for the most part, attentive to our table.  All of the food we ordered did not come out at the same time...a couple of items were 10 mins behind the rest (we were a group of 5). I'm mainly giving this place a 3 Star because the BBQ Chicken Pizza (which is a staple for me) was not up to par.  Not only was the chicken was dry, but the BBQ sauce was too...is that possible? Apparently so.  Not to mention the crust was unevenly cooked. I'll go back at some time and give this place another shot.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that this new place is working out all its kinks."
Rocky E.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/21/2015,Good food. Okay service that doesn't really care about your needs.
Kevin T.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/17/2013,"Lets start from the beginning. Walked in and there wasn't a host at the front for a few minutes. Finally had gotten seated at a table when a booth was requested. Not a big deal I didn't want to request it again.  First server comes and takes drink orders and 15 minutes passes by waiting to order our food and finally a DIFFERENT server notices and takes our order (thank you Alicia). And then we waited a little over half an hour for the food and when it finally arrived it wasn't even warm! On our way out we were waiting at the front with a few other groups of people while there was, again, no host there. And after a few minutes of waiting and nobody noticing the front, we were informed that they don't validate for the parking right next to the restaurant. This is by far the worst BJ's I've ever been to. The only good part about this lunch was our 2nd server.The table next to us complained to the manager about the same problems. Such a shame and waste of a really nice venue."
Vivianne M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,34,1,1.0,1/12/2013,"Subpar- I have been to several BJ'S (Huntington Beach, Arcadia, Burbank, etc.), but this location is lacking in quality and service.  I went twice, once for lunch and yesterday for dinner.  I really want to like this BJ's, but both times have been a disappointment. The building is stunning and lovely, however the food is just terrible.  While it's nice to sit in, what's the point of a restaurant having a beautiful atmosphere if the food sucks?!  My pizza was undercooked, then they forgot to put bacon on my husband's bacon cheeseburger.  When we told the server, he was not trained well and did not know what to do. Then, he brought out two small pieces of bacon.  That said, the real disappointment lies with the chief and kitchen.  The burger even itself, tasted terrible...it was way over-cooked...tasted burnt.  In addition, the staff seem overwhelmed and a bit snobby."
Ashley H.,"Pasadena, CA",1,1,,1.0,1/15/2015,"Terrible experience. Went in the mid afternoon of a weekday, took 10 minutes to get a glass of water, which had ice, after specifically asking for none. The slow service and mistakes continued, even with a mostly empty restaurant, and we left without eating, when both of our entrees finally showed up, wrong. If they can't get it right when business is slow, going while busy must be a horrific experience."
Anni K.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",3,26,2,4.0,4/10/2014,"Always have great service and great quality food! Must try the avocado eggs rolls, stuffed mushrooms and Santa Fe salad! The BEST!! But one time I found a hair in my food, but the waitress was nice enough to take if back and Comped the order! But other then that one experience they have great customer service and fast pick up service too!"
Mark G.,"Pasadena, CA",32,226,829,2.0,3/6/2015,"Came here Tuesday night for a going away party for someone. I was the first one to show up so I sat at the bar and ordered a Hop Storm IPA. Their IPA was very good and the bartender behind the bar was great. I was impressed with the extremely large TV and the layout of the restaurant. They did a great job restoring the inside of the former old bank building. What I was not impressed with was their deep dish pizza. A friend of mine order a happy hour appetizer Avocado Egg Rolls. These were excellent but the pizza not as good. We order a medium deep dish BJ's Favorite. Way to greasy on the bottom. Swimming in grease. The taste of the pizza was good and so was the crispness of the outer & bottom pizza crust but therein lies the problem and where all the grease was. Will I be back? Yes, Their happy hour prices on their beer & drinks were good and the next time I come I will try a couple of other less greasy food items."
L C.,"South Pasadena, CA",2,16,19,4.0,12/2/2013,"Deep dish pizza is good. Spinach stuffed mushroom is yummy. Not recommend their steak though. We came on Saturday, and took about 35 min wait to be seated. Food is delivered on right time. Not too late. Remember, They didnt validate the parking from Paseo Colorado and end up we paid $6 for parking."
Duvel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,117,4,1.0,8/22/2013,"Walked in @ 5:06... beer was served at 5:56... no joke!  But wait, it gets better!  Ordered wings with fries, and was brought 2 orders of wings instead, lol.  There's MORE!  When they brought the fries, they were the wrong fries, not seasoned as I had ordered, lol.  Beer was good, and Mojito was great too!  I guess if you don't mind waiting, and reminding them of what you ordered it's a pretty great place for happy hour.  I waited an hour to get happy... so can you!"
Ivonne L.,"Baldwin Park, CA",25,15,2,2.0,4/22/2014,"I was in the Pasadena area and decided to stop by and have dinner with my mother and sister. (We usually go to the BJ's in Covina). Let me tell you...I was really disappointed! We were seated right away but waited about 10 minutes for someone to help us out or even offer us a glass of water. To top it off, the restaurant was EMPTY so I'm not sure why they took so long to help us out. I ordered Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. Pasta was hard, chewy and no flavor. I've never experienced this at BJ's in Covina. I will definitely not return to the restaurant in Pasadena."
Diana B.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,86,7,2.0,4/9/2015,"I was disappointed, because we always have such a great experience at the BJs on Huntington.  But the service was off; the hostess said things like ""we're not taking names for tables,"" but didn't explain what that meant; do i seat myself or go to the bar?  Finally we got seated --because there were ten tables open-- but had to flag the wait staff after waiting too long.   My ahi salad was tasty though.  And we got to watch the game, which for us was fun but know that there is a huge screen over the bar--in case you're not in to sports you might be annoyed.  I did like the space and will try it again and re post if service improves."
Bryan P.,"Pasadena, CA",13,19,6,2.0,5/10/2015,"Out of all of the family friendly chain restaurants, I prefer BJ's over the rest. I go there ""often""....like once every couple months. Love the fact that they brew their own beer. However on this particular visit, I was beyond disappointed. after waiting for nearly 20 minutes for a table, the server was quick with the drink orders and we ordered a kids meal right away and also calamari.  The calamari was over cooked, rubbery, and really still dripping in grease and very much clumped together. Kids corn dog bites weren't horrible....but definitely frozen from a box...I kind of expected different. After seeing our waitress walk by several times I finally asked for some small bread plates for us to share the calamari......and clearly, with empty soda glasses on our table I kinda expected to get refills.....but I finally had to ask for refills. which were quickly brought.  Our waitress never checked on our satisfaction of the calamari, or the kids meal. we finished the app and stacked the dishes on the large plate and put it on the edge of the table.  After about 20 minutes...seriously 20 minutes.....I made eye contact with the waitress, who I hadn't talked to since the soda refills, who came over and asked if everything was OK. I told her that our party of 3 were still waiting on entrees. She said ""oh they'll be out soon"". meanwhile the 6top next to us had gotten there after us and got their food first. That's unacceptable. So..after being seated for nearly an hour...I see our food being taken out of the kitchen......to the wrong table. Well....with a fussy 2 year old AND a new baby, and a long wait for lackluster food and just below mediocre service, I requested to-go boxes and the check. I don't usually, but this time I had to notify the manager. He was accommodating and understanding. He comped our entrees. That was nice. but I expected that after the experience we just had. will we go back.......probably in a few months after this bad taste leaves my mouth, because microwaved ribs and soggy fries are not eat I wanted to eat tonight.....and as we walked out, the calamari plate was still sitting on the table and not a single thing had been bussed."
Jenny V.,"Pasadena, CA",1,11,6,1.0,4/30/2014,Wow what a huge disappointment. This place is a nightmare. The minute u walk in the hostess does not even greet u. The food was horrific. My Salmon was burned and our salad was so tasteless. We left this place hungry and with a really bad taste in our mouths... literally.  Never coming back. Not to mentioned the service was also terrible. They ruined our dinner date.
Briana A.,"Pasadena, CA",105,9,5,2.0,10/12/2015,"In the past few months I have come to this location consistently and each and every time the service has been horrible. To begin with it has taken at least 10 minutes for a server to approach our table and ask for our drink menus so long that by the time they get there we are past ready to order our drinks and food then once we do put that order in it takes another 5-10 minutes for us to get our drink orders and today it took about 40 minutes or more for us to get our food (I timed it), a sandwich and a mini pizza and to top it off I can count on one hand the amount of time our server came to the table to check on us and to refill our drinks a service we had to ask for. Now I myself am a server and I understand the demands of the job and I would understand if the place was busy but it was a slow Monday night and it has been slow the past times I've come and received the same type of service. If you want good service this is not the place to come."
LifesTooShort L.,"Altadena, CA",298,22,9,3.0,6/1/2013,"Fantastic chicken sesame salad ever!  Service was great too.  The only thing I didn't like is that upon our arrival, there was nobody at the booth to greet us.  We had to wait until someone finally arrived to seat us. When they arrived they didn't even acknowledge that we waited.  Not very attentive.  Our waitress on the other hand was very attentive!"
