Maggie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,35,8,5.0,1/7/2014,"Everyone is very friendly, love their flatbreads and light beer. I had never paid attention on their very nice ceilings until this past week I was there ! It made me feel like I was in this Fancy hotel in Vegas or something. .. the only thing they dont do is Parking Validation which I think should be done by them. .."
Paige G.,"Sierra Madre, CA",1,6,3,2.0,4/3/2015,"So it's says it's closed today which it is not because I've been waiting here an hour for my food. First, we arrived and were told it was open seating. We proceeded to wander around amongst dirty tables until we finally found a clean one in the corner. We had three separate waiters come up to ask if we'd been helped before we were relocated to a different booth so that we could ""get the attention we deserved."" Not quite... We're still waiting, and this is already the second chance we've given to this restaurant after a previous experience with a rude waiter."
Adam C.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,89,31,4.0,1/24/2014,"Finally gave this gorgeous place a try.  On a Wednesday night, I enjoyed sitting at their bar and sampling a few beers while snacking on their buffalo wings.  Yes, service tends to be a little slow at times, but the menu is huge and the interior/location really appealed to me.  If you're a beer person, try some of their various types!"
Sharkbait O.,"Buena Park, CA",50,20,13,1.0,9/12/2014,"Probably the worst experience I've ever had at any BJ's. The server brought my wife her soup and salad combo and said she'd be back to drop off utensils for our family. Needless to say after 5 minutes, soup was done and no utensils in sight. The server had passed by us several times while my wife was eating her soup.  5 more minutes pass, the server had passed by again several times again with no utensils.  I asked another server for some utensils and he said he'd get them right away. Our meals get dropped at the table and the first server finally brings utensils, commenting under her breath, ""aw, the food beat me out.""  After we all finish our entrees, I paid and as my wife was putting some stuff back in her bag, a cockroach runs past her and she shrieks in horror and screams, ""cockroach!"", but our server says, ""oh, it was just a water bug.""  Excuse me?  I'm fairly certain my wife knows what a cockroach looks like. Our food was on par with any other BJ's, but service at this one was deplorable. If there was a zero star option, it would be well deserved."
Crystal K.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,178,15,4.0,3/9/2013,"Nothing too special to write. Service is nice. Sometimes the hosts/hostesses don't know what they're doing, like the time they sat my husband and I in a tiny booth when she clearly saw we had several shopping bags. (Um, where are they supposed to go?) Other than that, it's not a bad eatery."
Peter D.,"Pasadena, CA",1112,219,69,2.0,12/20/2012,"My night to complain, mediocre food , warm beer and no validated parking thus $7.50 to watch 1/2 the game"
Andrew M.,"South Pasadena, CA",19,3,,2.0,12/14/2013,The pasta was not good. I expected something better for the price. The fact they don't serve coke is also an issue.
Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",252,773,409,3.0,8/5/2013,"Very nice building. One of the nicest buildings inside on Colorado. It reminded me of Grand Central Station how they have consolations on the ceiling. All was good but the pizza's just not the same anymore. I can totally tell the bread was pre-made. How can you pre-make a PAN PIZZA? The crust was very soft and not crunchy at all. This is not how I remember BJ's. There needs to be a crunch and softness to the crust. The only crunch was the sides because of the burnt cheese. The tomatoes were pretty salty too. I don't remember them being that salty. It's so sad to see old places change due to budgets and trying to make more money than last year. How about keep the same stuff because your place WAS bumpin' 10 years ago, not it has just fizzled down to being mediocre. :/ Anyways, if you want a quiet BJ's, this is it. That's about all the PRO I got. Oh and beer, specifically Pyramid, hasn't changed. Pyramid on tap will always be damn good. Maybe they should learn from them?"
bill m.,"Pasadena, CA",0,84,14,2.0,7/9/2014,Went there right after they opened in Pasadena.. Chicken pasta was like it was made the day before....Since it was new the first time I went back a few months later.  Small Chicken sandwich and wasn't fresh....This place just puts out mediocre food and their pricing is too high...Stick with Cheesecake Factory if you want consistently good food at a reasonable price.  You may not pay much less at Cheesecake but the portions are larger and the quality is consistent.
John E.,"Pasadena, CA",212,9,9,1.0,12/26/2012,"Bj's brewhouse is reminiscent of my college days: a pretty good deep dish pizza, awesome happy hour prices, decent beer on tap, and prompt, friendly service, but apparently these are all things of the past. I'm sad to have to write such a bad review at this location.  Brief run-down: Food Quality = barely mediocre Service = Inefficient and unsatisfactory; unfriendly hosts Ambiance = Great Location = inconvenient, but doable Now to the nitty gritty: HOSTESS/SEATING: My Friend Regina signs in for a table for 3 under ""Gina.' The good: we're seated in 15 mins on a Wednesday night at 8:15pm. The bad, the hostess calls out repeatedly, ""Jenna, party of 3."" After 2 attempts of Gina correcting the hostess, the hostess insists that she is waiting for a party of 3 for Jenna, NOT GINA...minutes later and after Regina clarifies with another one of the hostess, GINA party of 3 is finally seated.  TABLE/ORDER:  30 minutes after being seated, still no sign of a waiter/waitress. No on has come to check on our table or even provide water. Finally, we are able to flag down a waiter passing by, who graciously offered to take a drink order while he finds our waitress. Moments later, he lets us know he will actually be our server. (without having to say anything, clearly our waiter/waitress assigned to our section forgot about us). A few disappointing events to point out. It took 10 minutes for my beer to arrive after ordering, and probably would have been forgotten had we not asked another server passing by to check on our order.  1 out of 3 of the meals was served 15 minutes AFTER 2 of the entrees were brought out, that entree was a personal sized bbq chicken pizza that was served cold and dry. We went through the transition of 3 waiters in the 2 hour and 25 min time frame we were there, and really only waited on just shy one hour.  SPEAKING TO THE MANAGER: Typically, I have always had a great dining experience at several Bj's locations. This was my first time dining at the Pasadena location, and I was so excited to bring some friends from work here. Sadly, I was embarrassed to have suggested this establishment, seeing how we had such poor service.  I rarely ever make a complaint, but my friend felt that it was necessary we at least share our unsatisfactory dining experience with the manager. After a short 5 or so minute wait, we were approached by the manager, Eddie. I was curious to see how he would respond to the matter. We politely explained to him our disappointing and frustrating dining experience, from the point of check-in through paying the check. He listened with a seemingly attentive stance. We had already paid the bill, and he appreciated the feedback that we provided. He did, however, attempt to suggest that he would have comp'd a portion of the bill, but after finding out the bill had already been paid for, he made no other attempt to help rectify their poor service and cold food being served. He did make a suggestion that if when we come back, to approach him and he would take care of us...Let's get real here, IF i were ever to come back, would he even remember who I was or what had happened...realistically, no. Personally, I think how he should have addressed the matter, was maybe provide a voucher/gift card to facilitate a return visit and a hopeful chance at better service being provided...OR at the very least, offer a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience. Instead, a quick thank you and a speedily exit on his behalf. I hope this review makes it to the appropriate staff, or even Eddie, the manager, to help re-train and/or provide better, quality customer service.  Otherwise, Yard House is just a few feet away, customer service is WAAAAAY beyond better, the hostess and staff are incredibly friendly, AND has a much more palate, pleasing menu, along with a plethora of beer on tap."
Vinnie B.,"San Diego, CA",9,3,,4.0,1/19/2014,"The happy hour dishes are great price and very good. The wings are good, the beer is exceptional, and the massive tv puts this place a top the charts. Well done."
Trisha C.,"Pasadena, CA",1,2,,2.0,7/4/2014,I am a huge fan of BJs. I have been to many of their locations and always have a good experience. The service at the Pasadena location is horrendous. I also question their cleanliness. The bathrooms were extremely dirty which usually is a good indication on how the kitchen is kept. We waited ten minutes and no one came to offer us drinks or check on us. I had to get up and get us menus. Someone finally came and took our drink order but it took another 15 min to get our drinks. I was very disappointed with the service and I am not sure I will return to the Pasadena location. The dirty bathrooms alone were a huge turn off.
Tiffany R.,"Altadena, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/22/2015,I have been a loyal BJs member for years! And they have changes the menu now... And not for the best. The portions are smaller and service was ok but I was less than impressed. :(
Brandon M.,"Irvine, CA",870,101,14,5.0,8/5/2013,"Had an amazing BBQ chopped chicken salad here around 5ish.  Considering it was my first meal of the day, I was stoked that it came out fresh and quick.  Paired with a Nit Wit whitbier - it made for the ideal meal.  Service was great, and the ambiance in the restaurant was just as warm as the service.  Thanks BJ's for yet another great time."
Robert S.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",2,33,6,4.0,10/15/2013,"The food is good. I love the interior of this location.  I would give 5 star, but the service is super slow. We waited for like 40 minutes to get our soup and salad."
Ryanne C.,"Monrovia, CA",0,1,,3.0,3/8/2014,I love going to bjs usually but I had the worst experience I've ever had at this one. Our server made it seem like our table was an inconvenience to him. He took forever to bring us water and then our drink order. The food was still good but the service was horrible.
Vinnie M.,"Pasadena, CA",63,13,1,1.0,1/15/2013,"Our main course came before our appetizers because our waiter forgot to put in our order, his words. During our half an hour wait for appetizers the waiter didn't once stop to check up on us. Service needs major help here. No apologies from the staff at all."
Emily R.,"Alhambra, CA",1,55,11,3.0,1/17/2014,I like the location. It's nice to have a BJ's in Pasadena. The salads are always good and pretty big. The service was just okay. The waitress didn't really come to check on us and she sat us right by the front of the door so every time anyone left or came in we got a cold draft. And the restaurant wasn't busy she could have sat us elsewhere. Haven't been back in a while but I will if I get a craving.
Sil S.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,28,6,2.0,10/29/2013,"I usually love BJ's  so we decided to go to this one in Pasadena just for appetizers. My mother and I ordered the broccoli cheese soup which took forever it seems to bring out. When it finally arrived, the taste was just awful. The cheese tasted artificial. We sent it back for the clam chowder. The only good experience was the waiter who was very understanding. 2 stars because the waiter was better than the food."
Johanna A.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,169,19,3.0,5/4/2013,"GREAT decor. I wonder what it was before? It looks like an old school hotel or a bank. Nice touch! Well, it's a BJ's. Good quality food as always, but the service isn't great. Been here a few times already, but haven't found anyone who has looked happy. The biggest downside is that they don't know validate because they're not ""a part"" of Paseo. How in the hell. So, if you parked in one of the structures in the area, you have to walk to Gelson's (behind BJ's) to get your ticket validated. How does that work if you're there at late hours and Gelson's is closed? Lame. Because of this, we haven't been back in a while. I hope they change that soon."
