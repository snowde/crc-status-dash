Jay L.,"South Pasadena, CA",1,27,,1.0,10/19/2013,"I go to BJ's often with friends to watch games and enjoy their happy hour. Last week, I went to watch the Dodger's game with a friend. We got there, sat at a table for over 20 minutes without anyone helping us. We figured we weren't going to be helped, so we moved over to the bar so we could order happy hour drinks and food.  The bartender gal reminded us it was happy hour, we got a few beers, and then after she got us our beers, we then ordered some happy hour food. However, she then came back right after we ordered food and told us that happy hour ended just a minute ago. I told the bartender gal that we were waiting for over 20 minutes and that we came specifically for the happy hour and it was because no one helped us that we couldn't order the happy hour items in time.  She talked to her manager (some Hispanic lady) and told us that the manager was willing to charge our beers at the happy hour price but we'd have to pay for the happy hour food at full price. What the heck!? We paid for our drinks at left. Totally sucks, especially because the manager lady passed by our table twice. I made eye contact with her as well, but she didn't even help us!  So much for BJ's Gold Standard Excellence... BJ's, you guys lost a loyal customer. Not coordinating any more happy hours at BJs with my friends anymore."
Joybella M.,"Elizabethton, TN",100,23,3,3.0,12/30/2013,"Great happy hour special right now. 1/2 craft beer during an NFL game. Great selection of beer and drinks. Reasonable prices. Great service. It was really loud, but there were several games going on."
Django A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,32,24,2.0,8/11/2013,"Came here last night for take out and the front host were friendly (That's the 2 Stars I gave)... I would have given an extra star if they got my order right and if they weren't too stingy on the ice cream for my pizookie... Also, I was not too happy with the Nachos... I realized they forgot to give my chili when I got to my destination.  All it had was lots of chips, small amount of tomatoes and dried up cheese...  I ended up paying over $22.00 for a Pizookie and a dried up Nacho...  That's including with tip and parking fee since they do not validate for parking... I'll be back for the second time and I'll give them another chance.... BUT PLEASE get my Nachos right and don't be too stingy on the ICE CREAM!"
Veronica A.,"Duarte, CA",12,2,,4.0,12/12/2012,Grace could have done better service but Ernesto was great even though he continued to bring us lump items. He had great personailty and nice smile with a twinkle in his eyes.
Arpan S.,"Pismo Beach, CA",37,15,13,1.0,10/5/2014,"The service is okay, the food is what you expect, the beer and the beer glasses are warm, don't know if this was an off day, but the beer experience was bad. Overall an okay place."
Karen E.,"Pasadena, CA",74,222,4,3.0,3/23/2013,"Your standard BJs. Good food, friendly service and amazing pizookies :)"
Louie T.,"Pasadena, CA",68,86,67,4.0,3/23/2013,"For a bar restaurant, food here is excellent but ironically I'm not a big fan of their own beers."
Natalie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,2,2.0,10/30/2014,"So sad about my experience here because I usually love BJs. I was really disappointed with the deep dish pizza we got. We asked for pepperoni on one side only (and the receipt reflected this) but the whole thing had peperoni. Additionally, the pizza was not as hot as it usually is when they bring it out. I can tell it had been out for a while. We waited quite a bit for it too, so it makes sense. It is so pretty inside! Wish the service and food matched the décor..."
Joseph C.,"San Diego, CA",393,201,101,4.0,2/22/2013,"I come here to discuss game plans with my co workers over happy hour/beer. We always start off with the calamari and usually the BJ's dark beer. I've ordered a sante fe looking chicken salad (Don't want to pig-out during a meeting). What I like about all the BJ's is they are very spacious and the place is well lit up but not too bright. Next time you have a business meeting, this is the place to have it!"
Moana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,34,7,2.0,11/13/2012,"Pretty mediocre food, frozen veggies, iceberg lettuce salads, heavy oil, overall low quality ingredients.  The building is beautiful, and the service is good. Probably fine to get a beer and maybe an appetizer with friends, but I wouldn't go here for a meal. I wrote the same review on ""Bj's restaurant and Brewhouse"" page, this place is listed twice."
Bojun L.,"Irvine, CA",74,7,10,5.0,6/20/2013,"A quiet and beautiful place. Looks high end, and not expensive. And infinite Coke..."
John B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,6,,2.0,4/25/2013,"Pizza was awful. Truly below Pizza Hut. Yes, I'm a Chicago pizza snob, but you don't have to go that far for great pie. NY style is right down the street at the unassuming Kitchen (Delacey at Union) and deep-ish dish is wondrous at Zelo in Arcadia.  But we had a gift card. The wine selection is decent. Pizooki is, well, you can't really screw up a hot chocolate chip cookie with a slathering of ice cream. So why did I give it two stars instead of one? The room, the location, is truly beautiful. Ornate. But even that can't rescue what they call pizza."
Samuel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",192,414,10,2.0,11/30/2012,I don't know but I used to really love their pizza.  It's just not the same.  The pazookies are the bomb tho thats for sure...
Matt M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,3.0,6/25/2013,"It's edible, reasonably priced, and the service is fine.  We ate here because we knew that we would be able to eat whatever they served us, and maybe, just maybe, we would be pleasantly surprised.  We weren't surprised but we were able to eat it all."
Laura V.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,1,2.0,3/28/2013,"Food was amazing, but waiter/Customer Service was Awful... They completely forgot to put in my order."
Juliea L.,"San Diego, CA",18,9,4,5.0,11/8/2012,"My friend and I went in to try the new BJs tonight.. Wow was I impressed!! Our server, Myles, was ROCKIN!! He was friendly and knew so much!! He helped us sort through the giant menu to find exactly what we wanted!! And the food was great!! My only complaint was the mustard colored walls that kinda remind me of baby food.. But that's nothing a coat of paint couldn't fix.. Definitely go in and ask for Myles!"
james b.,"Pasadena, CA",68,11,,1.0,12/22/2012,"Great ambiance, decor, food, and beer. The one star is for the following: Went there with my fam for my birthday. We ordered drinks, and when the waitress was putting the drinks on the table, she spilled a glass of white wine on the table/my brother. The glass broke, my brother had white wine all over his pants, and he was trying to pick off all the little pieces of broken glass off of his pants. Lots of broken glass on the table, which we all tried to find and remove. We were all nice about it, and tried to comfort the waitress, who was frazzled. But, we expected to get something free for such an incident (who wouldn't?).  After the incident, our table is assigned a different waiter, for some reason. Check comes, and nothing had been taken off our tab. We call the manager and explain what happened. He says, ""I heard that someone pulled the glass off the tray"". We all laugh, and explain that was not the case. We were all a little taken aback. So, the manager takes $20 or so off the bill. We all left with a bad taste in our mouths.  Just the experience of one party, fwiw."
Ron O.,"Reno, NV",17,55,1,1.0,5/10/2013,"Got the worst food poisoning i ever got in my life after eating here. Whatever they're doing back there, I'd rather not know, to keep my faith in humanity somewhat alive.  I kid you not, the WORST food poisoning by far."
Laura M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,13,1,5.0,11/24/2012,"Berry cider....mmmm!   Fruity, for non beer lovers!   Try a $2 sampler glass"
Val M.,"Temecula, CA",1,11,,5.0,11/21/2012,Excellent service by Bryan. Delicious food.  Great night.  Highly recommend.
