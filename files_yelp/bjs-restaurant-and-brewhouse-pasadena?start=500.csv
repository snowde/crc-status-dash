Soraya S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",4,96,7,4.0,11/10/2012,"I love BJS! We ordered the beer sampler its amazing! The harvest beer is the best. THe setting, the customer service is great.. the place is HUGE so dont feel overwhelmed but overall my new BJS ill be going too"
Geoffrey G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,11/6/2012,Melissa was awesome in handling a guys order next to us who sent back his pizza. And she was super nice to us in getting our steaks.
Albert Z.,"South Pasadena, CA",1,2,,1.0,11/1/2013,Pretty bad... Not a busy night. Poorly staffed. Waited 15-20mins for our waitress to take our order. Waited another 20 for her to tell is that she had a problem putting in our order... gave her the benefit of the doubt and waited another 10 for our drinks.  Asked to see the manager after noticing that my glass was filthy. Never came...  Left after tables that arrives after us got thier order before we did. Just want to let management know you have a lot of work to do with your staff. Unacceptable. Only good part of that situation was I had great company.
Tiny T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,12,,4.0,4/13/2014,Great diverse menu. Excellent TV displays. Great atmosphere. I'm not 100% happy with the service.
Bd H.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/17/2015,"Went for late dinner. We arrived at the end of the NBA championship so had a little wait as people watching the game were clearing out. We got seated at 8:45pm and gave our drink order. We received our drinks at 9:00pm. Waiter came about 9:05 and we ordered a salad and BJ's famous deep dish pizza...(its one of the good ones!). At 9:30 we hadn't received our food but a different server came up and asked what our order was as the printer wasn't working. He said they had it cooked but they were just confirming orders. The salad arrived at 9:45pm...and the Pizza at 10:00pm. The server said the pan was hot. We touched the pan and it was warm. The center of the pizza was warm to hot but some of the toppings were cool. While we enjoy BJs pizzas, the last 3-4 times we ate at this location, the service has been poor. There are other pizza places in old pasadena with excellent service and great pizzas. If you are wanting good service and good pizza, then try one of them or a different BJ's. We would give it one star, but the deep dish pizza is good...so that bumps it up. Maybe if you just wanted drinks and watch the game, it would be an ok place"
M V.,"Ventura, CA",0,30,2,1.0,4/21/2015,"Our party of five stopped in for lunch on 04/18/2015. The restaurant was not busy at all, but we were seated in the back of restaurant ( 0036 table 316/ SvrCk:2). We sat for 10 minutes before being greeted by our waitress (Judy A)  and another 10 minutes before she came back  to take our drink orders. Things quickly went down from there. My black cup of coffee arrived with bright red lipstick on the rim and it took another server another 15 minutes before I received another cup, sans the red lipstick! We waitied another lengthly time to place our order and even longer to receive our food. The food arrived cold. Our waitress was not at all attentive, we constantly had to flag her down for refills, boxes and to order dessert for the kids and even the bill. The entire experience was not enjoyable at all. I'm not one to complain, but this was really bad. I called to restaurant directly to speak with the manager, the phone rang and rang... I called back using automated option to reserve for a large party. WOW! some one actually answered the phone. A women by the name of Kathleen or Karen came to phone. We talked about our visit to her restaurant and as all managers do she apologized and offered a certificate for a return visit. I told her my intention for the call was not to receive a gift card/ certificate but to inform her of the staffs' lack of customer service. She insisted on sending me a gift card/ certificate, she jotted down my email address to send immediately. Needless to say, I never received any email from BJ""s or the manager with a formal apology or gift card. A message to General Manager Michael Ganter, we travel from Ventura to Pasadena often to visit family to enjoy a nice day with them, your restaurant staff and manager fell quite short of providing that wonderful experience everyone should have when visiting any restaurant."
Shannon A.,"Laramie, WY",0,11,,2.0,5/22/2014,"I went to BJ's while attending a conference in Pasadena. I was looking forward to trying some of their beer given the statements of award winning, etc. For the positives, I felt the service was good. My server was attentive and she tried to describe food and beer pairings. The food was average. I had a buffalo burger with jalapenos and pepperjack cheese. It was good, but not great (i.e. typical pub good). The reason for my two-star rating is because of the beer. I am a person who enjoys craft beer and in my opinion I felt that each beer was muted in flavor and most lacked body. The Kolsch was passable but lacked the saaz hop flavor I was expecting. The red ale lacked both hop bitterness and caramel one would expect from a red. The IPA didn't have much hop flavor in the nose and certainly didn't have the citrus or piney flavors of American hops. There was another Irish red that had some decent flavor with a hint of caramel from the malt. Thus was the best beer I tried during this visit. Frustrated by my flight of 4 beers, decided to give the porter a try. This beer is classified incorrectly as it resembles a brown ale, not a roasty porter. The color was also too light. If they called this a brown ale I would have a better opinion of this particular beer. As a beer lover, I cannot recommend drinking BJ's beers with so many other fantastic options out there. They just simply do not stack up to their competitors."
Aparna J.,"Pasadena, CA",0,16,,2.0,4/12/2014,Nice place. Had to wait long to get water and service. Food was average and cold. The person who waited on us did not have time to listen to us completely.  Too noisy even for a brew house!!!
Gerald O.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,99,,2.0,8/7/2013,"We got a sharable thin-crusted vegetarian pizza and paid $17.95.  It had a bunch of black olives on it and very small pieces of  mushrooms, bell peppers and onions.  It was totally not worth it.  Go to Tarantinos on Green and get a very good vegetarian pizza for about the same price, but with big vegetable pieces and oh so much better.  BJ's is over-priced."
Jorge O.,"Pasadena, CA",7,11,,5.0,4/1/2014,I go to lunch here practically every day. The healthy food selection they have is great. They even change their menu periodically.
Steven G.,"Pasadena, CA",228,74,285,2.0,2/9/2013,"I've been here a few times and both times they got the order wrong.  Although they did comp a few items, I'm giving them a poor review in hopes that they get their act together.  There are so many other places that are cheaper and better for happy hour than BJ's. Their well alcohol list is sub-par, especially when the otis bar at Le Grande Orange has tito's vodka and heradura tequila as well items.   Also, the bartenders are not engaging with the clientele. Another drawback is the parking, they do have valet parking in front but if you don't want valet service, then you are going to have to pay for parking.  Although bj's is within the paseo shopping complex, if you park at paseo, bj's will not validate your parking ticket and you will have to pay the full amount of parking and NOT 90 minutes free which is normal for the paseo.  On the plus side, the building is beautiful.   With so many great food and drink options in Pasadena, unless bj's raises the bar, they are going to lose out on the happy hour and lunch crowd."
Aaron P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,5.0,3/13/2013,"Love this new location! It's huge, plenty of room so you dont have to wait. It's actually very pretty and heard that this was a bank before becoming a restaurant. As usual, the staff are nice and on it. We ordered beer, pizza, and salads and all were hot and tasty. The service is good and truly a good addition to that area. TV's surrounded everywhere so you can go there for a game or just simply dinner. Heard that their brunch is good as well so may go try that out in a few weeks. :)"
Nathalie M.,"San Marino, CA",72,4,,4.0,1/2/2014,"We braved the swarm of campers and dared to come here on New Year's Eve and couldn't have had a better experience and time ringing in the new year.  Parking is challenging, which is why I avoid dining in Old Town Pasadena like the plague.  We parked in the corporate bldg in which I work and walked a little over a mile, definitely not practical but parking in OT is stressful.  Our experience though was totally worth the walk - we were seated right away, served by a very friendly waitress, and enjoyed a great meal.  The red wine I had was very tasty and reasonably priced ~$6 (as were all the other wine selections).  My boyfriend and I shared this 5 gourmet meat deep dish pizza which was very good (~$22) it was served warm, not at all greasy like some other places like pizza hut.  There's also a huge screen TV which is perfect for watching games which we'll definitely return for in the future.  I gave it 4 stars because there's nothing super original about it.  Good food to enjoy in either a small or large group in a cozy space and served by friendly people."
InHisService I.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,1,4.0,11/6/2013,Had a birthday celebration here for my son the afternoon of. 11/2/13. The place was crowded but our waiter Robert was on it!  He did not miss a beat. He interacted with our entire party of 12 making sure we had everything we needed through the entire two hours!  We had so much fun.
Elizabeth D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/28/2012,Would never come to a place like this on my own but was invited to a work thing and I thought how bad it could be. Bad. Ordered one of the large salads. When it arrived it basically was composed of wilted lettuce and not much else. Service was slow and had to ask for salad dressing three times. Food was served sporadically so by the time everyone was served those received their food first had a cold meal.
Michael L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,,3.0,10/10/2013,Good food good service but they always seem to get my order wrong and last time I went they offered me a free pazooki and they ended up charging me for it not right that's why a three star.
Sean B.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,1.0,6/16/2013,"First time going to this location in Pasadena and our experience was not very pleasant.Lets start with the host,she was rude and rolled her eyes,that there should've told me to walk away.Our waitress started semi nice but that faded away within seconds.Our fiends & I ordered the appetizer platter & literally it took about 30 to 40 mins to come out.My bf ordered an alcoholic beverage and that took same amount of time 40 mins,RIDICULOUS!!! I also ordered and iced tea and years went by before I got it.Our friends had water and they never got refills,FRUSTRATED!!!We complaint about our drinks and she answered with an attitude like we were bothering her "" it's not my fault the bartender made the wrong tea.""Our food came and out bitch of waitres never came to ask ""how is everything"" So my bf called the manager over.He offered 2 bazookiz for dessert but that doesn't impress me.Finally my bfs drink came and he did t want it anymore,the waitres didn't apologize or asked why,she just took it back like "" we'll I don't give a fuck"" attitude.After we were all done I still tiped the tramp.But NEVER EVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!"
Kristin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,59,,5.0,7/21/2013,"Came here on a Friday night around 5PM for dinner.  We were seated almost right away at a comfortable booth near the middle of the restaurant.  It was pretty busy, I'm glad we didn't wait until later.  The strawberry lemonade, Santa Fe salad, and chocolate chip pizookie were amazing!  Love the restaurant and the food!"
Laura M.,"South Pasadena, CA",9,52,2,1.0,1/27/2013,"I was so excited to take my family to a new place at The Paseo. We were seated right away for our Sunday lunch. Our waiter came and took our drink orders as soon as we sat down. But from then on, we had to remind him to bring us everything. My soup. Drink refills. Water. When our food came, the kids pizza was on the cold side. I went to cut into my ribeye steak, it was so tough I had to use all my strength to try and cut it. The waiter was there to see me do this. He said that if I wanted, he would bring me something else. Duh? What do you think?  I asked him to bring me the New York steak. He offered to bring me a salad while I waited.  After biting into my new steak, I realized I should not have ordered steak here. I've had better at Sizzler. The only good thing was that I promised the kids a pizzokie. I was glad they really loved it.  Overall, what really bothered me was the lack of interest from the manager in making sure we were happy with our meal. Usually when you send your entree back, a manager comes over to make sure you are happy with your replacement entree and offer to bring you dessert. I think the guy in collard shirt that brought me my new steak, who did not ask me, but told me that it looked better than the last one, was a manager. He dropped it off and literally ran away.  When the check came, the only thing that was comped was the sad salad that the waiter brought me. They even charged the us difference in steak price between the ribeye and the more expensive New York. How tacky is that?  Shame on you Bj's. Family time is very special. Instead of leaving your restaurant feeling happy to have spent a Sunday with my family. At a new place in a great space in town. Happy to have enjoyed a beer and the Lakers. I left with the feeling that I was ripped off. This place did not deserve my time or money. NEVER AGAIN. I will stick to the Yard House from now on."
Brian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,62,3,2.0,1/13/2013,"Plenty of TVs as usual and the atmosphere was pretty typical of any other BJs.  Ordered small BJs classic pizza and the dough was slightly undercooked, giving it that frozen pizza taste and feel.  And it didn't come served as deep-dish style of pizza."
