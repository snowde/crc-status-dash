Michael S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,19,,5.0,8/17/2013,We come in about 3 times a month. Food is great and Tuesday is half off of wine and beer. Sit at the bar when Jackie is working.

Lanie B.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,16,,4.0,4/19/2013,The building is beautiful. Love the food. My service has always been good. Try the avocado eggs rolls (appetizer) when you go- they are delicious!
Michael T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,2.0,1/30/2014,"My friends and I go out several nights per week for Happy Hour in Pasadena and we have been going to BJ's due to convenience, but have always thought the service was mediocre and the prices were high.  We went tonight because on Thursday there are pints advertised for $3.50.  The service was mediocre at the bar, but we enjoyed ourselves.  When we got the bill, the pints were all $4.00 and we alerted the bartender who said she'd fix it.  After about 5 minutes while we watched her make several other drinks and wait on other people, we asked again and she said she needed the manager to change the bill.  Then after 5 minutes, we went on a search for the manager ourselves.  When she saw him coming, she fixed the bill without even talking to him.  When we talked to the manager, he offered no help to explain why this happened.  Here's the thing, for a big franchise like this, the computer systems should know the correct price of the beer - there has to be some scam so they make more money off of the customers.  Especially because the bartender was trying to have us give up and just pay the higher bill.  It wasn't about the money, but the principle about being charged the amount that is advertised.  We won't go back again, and we even work in that building.  We will also tell everyone about the dishonestly.  The positives are that this restaurant is beautiful as it was built in a space that used to be an old bank."
Sam H.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/19/2013,"We ordered take out from BJ's because we're all working late in the office lately. I'm a vegan, so BJ's wasn't my first choice anyway, but that's what my coworkers decided on. Two of us don't eat meat. We ordered a salad and asked that they omit the chicken (since all their salads had meat). When we got back to the office and opened our food we found that both salads had chicken slapped across the top. This made our dinners inedible and we left them in the fridge hoping someone else would eat them. What a waste of money. This is California, a lot of people are eating less meat and it's not a difficult order to say give me a salad hold the chicken. They actually make profit off of that. We will never order from them again."
A. H.,"Pasadena, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/15/2013,"I visited this Pasadena BJs for the first time a few days ago.  I've been to other BJs and I like the food and the atmosphere.  I was hoping for a great experience with friends at this new location.  My experience was far from it.  We noticed that the appetizer plates on the table were dirty.  They had grease stuck on all of them.  We asked for new plates and the new set was worst than the first set.  we gave up on using the appetizer plates and opened the utensils and those were greasy and had food stuck to them.  The towels were no better.  A couple of the towels were burned.  We asked for new service sets.  After changing the utensil sets 4 or 5 times, we gave up, and asked to see a manager.  The manager seemed liked a nice guy and after apologizing he said he will look into it.  When he got back to us, he said, they have no hot water in the kitchen.  They are washing everything with cold water and that is why nothing is clean.  At this point, I started thinking about the food that was on its way to our table and served on the plates that was not going to be clean.  We got our food, but not a whole lot of utensils or table napkins.  The manager did not seem to care or think he was responsible for anything outside of notifying us that they had no hot water and all utensils and plates were going to be dirty.  Terrible service. Worst restaurant experience in a long time.  I go out twice a week for dinner in Pasadena.  Pasadena has too many good restaurants that are always clean.   I will never go back to this restaurant and do not recommend anyone trying this place.  Don't waist your money or more importantly your precious time at this place."
Simon C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,4.0,12/8/2012,"Beer sampler fun. Good menu, food was tasty. Venue is well done, they kept a lot of the charm of the interior of the bank. Our server, Victoria, was really sweet and helpful."
Mariam G.,"Pasadena, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/24/2012,"Amazing Service, Amazing building, nothing like chain BJ's that I know of.  It feels like you are in some kind of high end steak house with beautiful arcitectural work.   Loved it and will recommend anyone to try this location first before you try any other locations.  You will be back guaranteed.  It's amazing place for your next event, family dinner or corporate party.  You have to try it to believe it."
Brandon N.,"Berkeley, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/15/2012,"Reading from the reviews finding out that this BJ's was recently opened got me excited to see how the restaurant looked. I got there and i was there for the first time so parking was a little on the edge but overall it didn't really bother me. The place was amazing, big tv on the wall and the basketball game was going and all but me and my girlfriend had the holiday deal they had ""Party for 2"" I gotta say the service was amazing, our server name was Brian and he was great and was really just focusing on us and trying to get some laughs out of us. It's great to know that some people still trying to do that! Other then that it was my FIRST time at Bj's and i gotta say, what a good way to kick it, loved the chowder soup i got and my girlfriend got the Italian salad and the pizza was REALLY amazing, i can usually finish half a pizza but i barely even got to the 3rd piece at Bj's, me and my girlfriend even doubted that we could touch the dessert but when the time came we ordered a Cookeis n cream pizookie and i know how much my girlfriend loved sweets. It was my first time eating a pizookie and i was amazed on how good it tasted and my girlfriend loved it too! I gotta say i will be coming back for 2nds! Had a great night with my love and loved it too, it was our first time and it was amazing! Thanks for the great memories Bj's!"
