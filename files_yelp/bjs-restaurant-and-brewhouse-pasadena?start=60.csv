Angie M.,"Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA",117,11,6,2.0,1/5/2017,"I didn't think this location would be so awful. First, we ordered our drinks, my wine came out first and my boyfriends beer came out nearly 20 minutes later. He didn't even finish it because we wanted to have a drink before our dinner, so that was a fail.  Second, when our dinner finally arrived they didn't provide us with utensils so we just sat there staring at each other not being able to eat our food. I ordered pasta and he ordered steak, I would've gladly eaten with my hands but these food items don't allow for that. I asked the busser that brought our food for utensils and he never came back, our server had to go run and get them. Our food got cold.  Third, when our pizookie arrived they didn't clear our table from our dinner plates so we had to awkwardly pile everything to the side in our tiny booth to try and make room for dessert.  The food was decent and our waiter was nice, but I don't think we'll be returning to this location."
Pebs P.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,54,,2.0,7/8/2017,"We didn't feel like walking all the way down Colorado Blvd. so we stopped at BJ's for a drink. The service was meh. The drinks were unbalanced...like the girl didn't care to portion the quantities of things right. My drink was really, really, strong. With all the great places to eat in Pasadena I really regret coming here for this mediocre, chain, crap. But I guess I should have known better. Go somewhere else, there are plenty of better places."
Vee F.,"Whittier, CA",1,15,11,3.0,9/18/2016,"3 stars because I LOVE BJ's food. I can't say much for some of the staff. Our waitress is sweet! But the hostess made a fooshy face when I asked her if she could wipe off the food crumbs from the bench.  Been here for 20 minutes and every table (I'm not exaggerating) has dirty plates on top. It's pretty gross!!! 8 tables!! 15 minutes later... Guy shows up to clean the table next to us, he has a wad of toilet paper sticking out his nose. Pretty gross. I wanted to send him home. Or away."
Tatyaja S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,74,4,3.0,9/16/2017,The food is typically overpriced bar food...the music is too loud and the waitresses are totally inattentive and not friendly. Pass. 3 stars for the strong drinks though....just not a great place.
Gina S.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",399,29,11,1.0,3/16/2017,"A few friends went to your restaurant on a Weekend a couple of weeks ago. We got there at 10:00am, we were given the brunch/breakfast menu. On the menu, it read eggs anyway you want. First, I ordered poached eggs, the waitress informed me that they didn't have vinegar to do poached properly! So, I asked for soft boiled eggs, they told me, they weren't set up to do eggs like that???? WTF!! Perhaps, change the writing on your menu to read, ""fried eggs only!"
Veronica Y.,"Pasadena, CA",14,8,1,5.0,8/4/2017,"Came for dinner with family, large group. Ernesto our server was amazing. It seriously felt great with his patience and great attitude. We ordered our food and drinks, all were prompt and so yummy. I must say, some of the best service we've experienced in a long time. Thanks for helping make this evening a special one for mom. Will be back soon."
Adrian I.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,4,1,1.0,7/4/2017,There online ordering service is a joke the location never has anything ready not only that but they take forever to even to acknowledge that you've walked into building. I placed a order at 5:26pm online for a 630pm pick up of course was not ready. For anyone on a tight lunch break this is not a location to go to.
Dolores B.,"Alhambra, CA",246,10,,5.0,11/8/2017,I love this hidden gem! The service is excellent and the food is good. I love the atmosphere!
Aaron B.,"San Dimas, CA",0,5,1,5.0,7/6/2017,Ernesto was a great waiter! Went out of his way to help us and they were closing when we came in. I like when my waiter is cool and talks to use like we are friends and not some lousy customer here to eat and here their script.  Thanks!!
Gypsy Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,,5.0,9/8/2017,"Michael A. Was an awesome server!!! He was so affable and knew the answer to every menu related question.  He was also a beer expert,  which was perfect for our group.  He truly went above and beyond, moreso than any other waiter I've experienced. Next time we are here,  I'd  request to sit in his section again."
Andrea M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,33,,1.0,10/27/2017,Oh my god. The service couldn't be WORSE. IT took SO long for the server to come. The appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) would have been good if they hadn't been cold. And my drink... never arrived. They aren't even busy and there's a ton of staff lingering around. I always tip 20% no matter what. Not today!
Michael G.,"Pasadena, CA",0,61,7,3.0,9/30/2017,"One of the things that brings me and my wife into BJ's are the garlic rolls. Today I was told that they no longer give those to customers with the meal. Instead you have to pay $4.95 for four rolls and marinara sauce. However, a manager contacted me and explained that they do give customers one roll per dinner item so at least they are giving them out.  I guess the waitress wasn't told the rolls are still available at no cost with dinner.  The other problem I had tonight was that it took a very long time to get my dinner.  And I asked for green beans instead of broccoli but they gave me broccoli anyway.  Tonight was not the best experience at BJ's but they've been pretty good in the past and so I'll give them another chance. Especially since they are still offering the garlic rolls with dinner.  If they weren't doing that, then I wouldn't go back; I'd go to a different restaurant that does include bread with the meal."
Yaeko M.,"Chicago, IL",26,301,10,4.0,10/12/2016,"I went there with my colleagues from Japan. They are looking for american beer and this place served well,  great beer, great food, great service. We enjoyed happy hour. We had beer flight, calamari, mozzarella cheese fries, mini deep pizza (classic combo, California supreme,  PJ's favorite, buffalo chicken). All food was decent and we enjoyed very much. Food: Great Price: Great Service: Good Ambiance: Great"
Richard C.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,68,,2.0,11/21/2016,"We noticed that this place opened a few months ago since we normally frequent the one in Glendale, so we decided to finally give this place a shot.  My wife, son, and I was met by their hostess.  We asked to be seated, but then she said something weird, ""Let me check with my manager first."" I was scratching my head wondering why she needed to check with her manager before seating us.  I couldn't figure out why?  There was enough space for the 3 of us.  Anyhow, we were eventually seated.  Our server was very friendly, but unfortunately, his attention to detail was subpar.  He had forgotten a few things that we ordered and didn't come to check in on us on a periodic basis like how other great servers do.   The food was okay; nothing spectacular.  I order the prime rib which was very good, but the mashed potatoes was cold.  My wife ordered the ahi tuna salad. Again, not really that fresh.  I had better Ahi Tuna at the Yard House.  Overall, the experience was not that great.  What is also a deal breaker was their inability to validate our parking ticket.  If they can afford a super spacious former historic bank, they can subsidize our parking, too.   We are not going back to this location.  I will take a further drive out to Glendale, instead."
Jonathan Roy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,23,100,4.0,12/29/2016,"Been here quite a few times throughout the years and this is the first time I am reviewing it. I usually I go here for celebratory reasons as the atmosphere in the restaurant is pretty classy. The one thing that stands out is that their servings per dish. The size is outstanding. The taste is pretty good as well. Their pizza and calamari is mouthwatering. If you do plan to try this restaurant out, make sure to come in on an empty stomach to make your visit as worhtwhile as possible. Customer service is amazing and they make sure to cater to you as a crowd and as an individual. And one more thing, do try their large-sized pizookie. It comes in 2-3 different flavors! If you came in a small crowd, take the pizookie challenge and finish it by yourself. But BJ's is pretty amazing at catering to a large crowd so either way, your visit to this aesthetic driven restaurant will be worth it! 9/10"
Stephanie Y.,"Rosemead, CA",1,10,4,1.0,9/22/2016,"Absolutely horrible service here. One of the greeters sees me walk in, doesnt greet me, I tell her I'm here for pick-up and she tells me to wait at the take out place. She and two other greeters start chatting and none of them attempted to call anyone to ""take out."" If the bartender didn't see me standing there, I don't know how the ""take out guy"" would have known I was standing there. The guy shows up, doesn't apologize and takes forever to complete the transaction.  Thought I would have gotten better service at Pasadena BJ's but I think it is actually worse that Montbello!"
Evan M.,"Pasadena, CA",216,242,465,3.0,7/26/2015,"Pretty good food for a slightly higher price ($18-20).  I feel it reminds me of Cheesecake Factory with their large portions of mostly American Food, however minus Cheesecake!!! (Downer for me).   I did enjoy their BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, and their Thick cut fries (something hard to find).   They do have their Pizookie (think cookie with ice cream on top), which was kinda good.  We got the triple cookie sampler and chose Cookies and Cream and Salted Caramel (both good) and Peanut Butter (not good, and I love peanut butter).  I do like you can get a sample of several flavors at least. Overall not that impressed since there are so many other good food places around Pasadena in the same price range or cheaper.  However, would come again since their food still is good."
Alexus T.,"Covina, CA",0,9,7,2.0,10/25/2016,"This is the worst BJ's I've ever been to. The customer service is horrible and definitely needs better hostesses.  They don't greet you when you walk in and are rude and snobby. That's not the first impression you want of any company. It's also a huge bummer that they don't validate parking for the parking garage located directly underneath them. I don't get it. But that's not even the biggest issue.  What really annoyed me is that I went in with a party of eight people and they tried seating us in a booth that clearly only fit five people comfortably or six people if I'm being generous. When I politely asked for us to be seated elsewhere because being squished in with that many people after a long day at Six Flags, the hostess rolled her eyes at me and walked away.  I than annoyed a random waiter and demanded be seated at a longer table (which keep in mind isn't his job). But he ended up switching our tables.  Our waitress after that was decent. But the hostesses just ruined our interest in this BJ's location."
Jennifer M.,"West Covina, CA",55,9,2,4.0,5/4/2017,First time trying the beer batter fried asparagus and it was amazing! It comes with a lemon garlic aioli that added even more yummy flavor! As for the spinach artichoke dip...... dry very dry and it left me an odd aftertaste. The drinks were great and my new favorite drink here is the pear cider!! Very light and tasty!!
Kesa W.,"Corona, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/10/2017,"Worst customer service!! I've had two incidents with this restaurant. The first time I order a flatbread pizza and it was undercooked. So, I call and speak with the manager and she advised she would follow up with me the next day after she finds the transaction but I never receive a call back. Then today I decide to give it another shot and I spoke with Brandon and asked about the take out wait time and he places me on hold for 4 plus mins and never came back. So I called back and spoke with the manager Chelsea and she took my order. I get there and the guy at the take out register doesn't even acknowledge I'm sitting there. I finally get help and Chelsea took care of my order but let me say this, it might have been free but it looked like it was free. It was extremely messy and sloppy. Didnt eat it!! This really showed how you value your customers. Will never return!!"
