Anthony A.,"Monrovia, CA",262,1,,5.0,7/20/2017,"I came in on a Tuesday night, not too many people so I sat in the bar, I was greeted by an exceptionally knowledgeable bartender by the name of Ariana. She was very pleasant and had a great energy, I enjoyed the green flash IPA and was suggested the new flat bread pizza which came out very fast and tasted incredible. Overall the service, food and energetic bartender will ensure I will become a regular at this establishment. Awesome job BJ's!"
Ken W.,"Alhambra, CA",0,18,59,4.0,7/20/2017,"Took my wife to BJ's for her Birthday last night. First time to Pasadena location. Food was Great. I had the Top Sirloin steak with double White Cheddar Mashed Potatos, wife had the Rib Eye steak with mashed potatos and grilled asparagas. Both meals were delicious. There was Free WiFi. We were very Disappointed that the server told us they did not Validate for Parking in the Paseo Pasadena garage parking, server told us if we took our ticket to the machine by the elevator, where our ticket can be swiped and validated, went to elevator, could Not find this machine. We have dined at Islands in the past, in the Paseo and they have machine validator at the Host Desk where we can validate parking ticket.We had to go to Parking Pay Stationand Pay $7.50 for Parking...."
C C.,"Fremont, CA",1,49,,4.0,10/9/2017,"Great place to watch sports and eat.  Dodgers were on TV (TBS) so I am not sure if during the regular season, they can view the games on the cable channel.  The smores pizzoki dessert was the best.  We had pizza, pasta, and jambalaya which were good, but not excellent.  Service was attentive, but not frequent to check on us.  We had water glasses that were unfilled. The location in Pasadena is excellent.  I would recommend this and go back too.  Driving south on I-5 to Los Angeles area?... take the 210 interstate to Pasadena and hop off for dinner at BJ's."
Cydney M.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",82,670,3555,3.0,3/3/2015,"This is one of those places that has some good Happy Hour Specials and you can see these on my photo. My Yelp friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat and a drink before seeing ""The Theory of Everything"" at the Arc Light Cinemas.  BJ's Restaurant is on the west side of the Paseo, so we walked over there. FOOD:  3/5 STARS I just ordered the carnitas fries with chile verde.  They were just alright. I wish the pork had been shredded instead of chunks of pork.  The beer was good.  My friend had a salad and a beer.  Our bill was $30.00 which was reasonable. SERVICE:  2/5 STARS Our server took our order quickly, but she didn't check on us, refill our water or bring a box for our leftovers after we asked once. ATMOSPHERE:  4/5 STARS It's a pretty space with vaulted ceilings and huge chandeliers.   The huge T.V. over the the bar is also nice. PARKING:  4/5 STARS Just park at the Paseo and you can get your ticket validated. RECOMMENDATION: Will I return?  Possibly, but there are so many other places to go with better food and service."
Charlea G.,"West Hollywood, CA",1,8,,1.0,10/7/2017,We ordered and waited over 40 minutes for our food. After not being able to find the waitress we decided to get up and leave. Asked for the manager to let him know the terrible service. Manager named Cesar took forever to see us and then the only thing he said was that they wouldn't charge us. I told him charge us for what?
Ivonne S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1382,75,1440,4.0,2/5/2017,"Came here on a Monday night, service was great and fast! We had a deep dish pizza and took advantage of their deal going on, any Deep Dish Pizza or Tavern Pizza was half off, so we went ahead and ordered the large one with a side of their BBQ Pepper wings. The food was great! The Cavaliers were playing, so we asked the server if he can change one of the T.V.'s to the game, but then after getting his manager to approve it he told us that they didn't have the channel, which was surprising because it was a Fox Sport Channel. Anyways, first time at this location and will be coming back!"
Ralph S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,22,,4.0,7/13/2017,Place was nice and food and desert were good. One bad thing is they do not validate parking so you need to add the parking cost if you are going there
Kirk W.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",17,16,15,1.0,3/26/2017,"Night begins with a 15-20 min wait (appears slow)  .... finally seated, order, then Sirloin steak comes out before two kids spaghetti...   Also, no silverware 1 hour in... no need to add more details. Not mad, extremely disappointed"
Austin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",247,23,7,1.0,3/16/2017,Echoing the common complaint here. Service slow and impersonal. Food subpar. Lots of potential but none realized.
PETER G.,"Pasadena, CA",0,35,8,3.0,11/2/2016,"its okay....just don't order the brussel sprout! Looks nothing like the picture. All black and burnt. Asked the server, she said thats how they are made. So gross. Most other food item is okay. The app is a great idea, but lots of fine tuning to do. Can't pay on it if they have a special you want to take advantage of."
Peter S.,"Monterey Park, CA",4,41,18,1.0,9/3/2017,"The waitress was completely dismissive, didn't mind following up with our food.  Food arrived COLD and 1 hr late in a not so busy day.  Manager apologize and gave us a discount coupon for next time.  Used the coupon and the same story.  Wouldn't be surprised if they close in less than a year."
Braided V.,"Pasadena, CA",5,20,26,1.0,8/12/2016,Ordered the Brussel sprout and kale salad with Cajun shrimp. Did not look appealing nor taste good. It had one too many toppings that just didn't mix well.  Staff seemed like they needed training on their customer service and products.
When NoOne Is Watching Y.,"Monrovia, CA",1,25,267,5.0,12/7/2016,"Great atmosphere,  and staff (David, Alex). They are attentive during lunch and happy hour 3-4pm. Happy hour is 3-7pm;lunch is 11am -3pm. I highly recommend signing up for their reward program as you get points for every dine-in you have at BJ's. Wifi is also freely available. Keep in mind this review is only a review between the hours of 2-4pm."
Libra B.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/22/2017,Had dinner there yesterday & wont be returning  1. Awful service!!- Waiter appeared to not really want to be at work-- in very bad mood 2. They ran out of pork chops!! Really??? Restaurant was empty at 5 pm and No pork chops? Now I understand why restaurant was empty 3. Ordered 2 cappuccinos & got watered down coffee with something else in it ( maybe creamer?) No foam no nothing. Waiter claims that's how it came out of the machine---hmmmm Food and service for a pasadena/paseo establishment was less than one star.  Service staff needs better training!!!!
Bree B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/13/2017,"All of the employees here are really nice and helpful but Michael, especially. He is always so sweet and attentive and everything you could ask for in a server! He always has such a positive attitude and never seems like he hates his job - unlike most customer service employees. I just hope his outstanding service is recognized! I was never the biggest fan of this restaurant but I live/work near by and after my first time having him as a server a few months ago he suggested a lot of the best items on the menu that I've been back for several times to try out.  Hope this review counts for something. It's just really hard to come across good customer service employees so I have to make sure I speak up about ones I come across!"
Cheryl A.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,20,1474,3.0,3/16/2016,Went here the other night to take advantage of the free Pizookie for Pi day. Super easy visit without any complications. Only need to spend $10 minimum and did not need to split checks while each patron got a free Pizookie.  I only wish this place validated parking. Ended up being $7.50 for the underground parking.
K. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,5.0,5/31/2017,"Weekly visitor for a few years now. Recently I've been staying in and going to pick up take out. The take out hostess Elaine is usually there to pack up my order right. When ever she's there my order is complete and my bag is stocked with utensils, condiments, and napkins. She mentioned to me that she may be moving up to server soon, if she does I will most positively come back as diner at her table. Great customer service. A+ smile. And food recommendations are always 100!"
january l.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,23,12,1.0,3/14/2017,"Ffood & Service is terrible. We waited at the bar for 10 mins with no menus. Nobody came up to ask us if we've been helped. I went up to the hostess to get a seat in the dining area and got seated right away. (That was the only good thing about this) Our waitress was very sweet, but a little unattentive. She took a while to get to us. We finally order our drinks and appetizer and waited another 15-20 mins for our food. It was nice of her to let us know she was checking on or food which I appreciate, but the kitchen has to have backed up bcit took longer than usual. I ordered a pizza with no olives. It had olives...the waitress even repeated no olives on the pizza lol really? No drink refills were asked. We asked her to change the channel back to what was showing earlier (it was a documentary about a 2 UFC fighters) and she said they aren't able to because they don't show fights.  Are you joking right now?!?! It was just on!! We were pretty much done with our food and that was when she told us about the TV situation. She aired us what channel it was on the first time and then 10 minutes coming back to us letting us know they can turn it back. I s do dinner with this place. We for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our check. Come on, man. I used to work at a restaurant! This is THE WORST restaurant I've gone to. It's close to going to a restaurant and getting food poisoning. One question, where the hell do we park for for BJ's? They don't validate for you parking structure connected to them on the left. So they have a restaurant with no parking lot of their own...? That's a little weird."
A. M.,"Glendora, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/13/2017,"When you order service here and it's a rib eye you should never have to wait 1 hour 17 mins to get your food the the waitress was not even checking on you, only to tell you that your food will be wright up and it still came up cold and not the way you ordered it ! Sucks but this place not only has turtle slow service and I guarantee you this is my last time to this location!!!!  Pasadena BJ's is horrible the workers are so unfriendly that if I was corporate I would be looking at this location very closely, I was told that maybe our steak was given to someone else ???  Our waitress was the worst, when her job is too check on her customers food ! and she didn't do that correctly ! They had us wait to replace the food and now the steak was burnt is this a joke !!!!!"
Eddie B.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,48,,2.0,7/30/2017,"I really want to like this place but the truth of the matter is not all locations are the same.  Their Burbank location is so much better in food quality and service.  In a city like Pasadena, that offers many places to eat, you have to be good to make it.  I doubt they will survive another 2 years.  I hope I am wrong, and they improve, perhaps by firing everyone and starting over."
