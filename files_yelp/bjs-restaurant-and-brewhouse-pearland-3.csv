Nathan N.,"Houston, TX",31,309,155,4.0,1/7/2018,"I guess that I need to get out more, because I did not know this place existed! It is only about six minutes from my house...well, anyway I know now. They make their own beer! I tried a few and really liked one-Jeremiah Red. The burgers and pizzas were spot on too. This is a good place to go if you have older kids or just want to hang out with a few friends for a couple (OK, a few) beers."
Mark B.,"Houston, TX",416,313,2205,4.0,11/2/2017,"Met some friends here for lunch, I had been to a few BJ's locations but never this one. I had also never tried their pizza.  I went with the Gourmet Five Meat deep dish. This was a serious pizza! Two pieces and I was done. I was able to make four meals out of the one pizza, which was good because at $26.25 it was the most expensive pizza I've ever had. Worth it thou.  They brought out a three prong pizza stand for the table and it had magnets on it and the pizza pan was metal...genius! I am always worried about the entire pizza sliding off those, but this one was going no where.   Also had a Cream Soda which was fantastic.  As we were leaving the manager told us that pizzas are half off on Mondays, just might have to go back."
Rosy P.,"Houston, TX",14,176,2453,5.0,9/24/2017,"This is one of the few restaurants open late in Pearland. They're famous for their Pizookies and rightly so. Those cookie desserts are awesome! My favorite is the triple chocolate with Ghirardelli pizookie. It's so good!!! I ventured out and tried the Cookies and Cream pizookie today and it just didn't compare.  There are a wide variety of entrees here. The burgers are good. So is the pizza. Their artichoke and spinach dip is cheesy, melty goodness. The soups are served in bread bowls - my husbands favorite! They have specials Monday thru Thursday's.  Their kids menu is full of variety also. Lots to choose from for even the pickiest eater. If you get a waiter/waitress that's really good, your kid also gets the kids appetizer - a small fruit cup and bread roll. Sometimes we get it, sometimes we don't. Today we did and my son was happy about that!  Decor is nice and simple. The atmosphere is lively but not too distracting. Good food. Good people. It's easy to see why they have repeat business here."
Tom B.,"Rosharon, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,I don't understand how many times we come here and wait for tables despite looking around at an empty restaurant. The hostess' here absolutely suck. Servers aren't much better. Told 20 minute wait and still here at 50 minutes waiting in front. Last time we come here
Belly G.,"Houston, TX",615,834,4928,2.0,9/14/2016,"I haven't been to a BJ's in forever until this time and let's just say that I was very underwhelmed. I came in a group of six and this was during the UH Cougars and OU Sooners football game, so of course I wanted to watch it. Told the hostess to seat us where we (specifically me) could watch the game. We were told to wait about five minutes and then we were seated at the corner booth on the right side (if you're looking in) of the restaurant. Not in the main floor where there are TVs all over the place, but in the restaurant wing where's there's only three TVs in the whole room. If that's not bad enough, in the middle of the booth, between my eyes and the TV, there's a hanging chandelier that made it really hard for me to watch the game. Yes, there are other TVs in other sides of the restaurant, but these TVs aren't big enough for me to be able to see the score, or to see what the hell is going on during the game. Enough rant! On to the food and service!! Food: I ordered a basic bacon cheeseburger. The patty - bland. Totally flavorless like they didn't put anything on the patty - just slab the meat on the grill, put it on the bun, add bacon and vegges, and done! Meh. Service - Our waiter was okay. Not great, not fast, not super slow either. However, prior to use leaving, one of my friends asked for his drink to go. THIS never happened. We waited a little bit after we all signed our CC checks to see if he'd come back, but nope. I even got up and looked around to see if I could located him somewhere in the restaurant, but he was nowhere to be found either. Meh. As I stated above, my experience was underwhelming. Bland food and meh service.  So... meh."
Stew G.,Chicagoland,2,35,32,4.0,11/17/2017,"The menu is so big that you become undecided.  Not because there's not anything you want, but because there's too much that you want.    Sit at the bar and get a LightSwitch (3x) and the Grilled Cheese.  HONEST."
Monae I.,"Houston, TX",124,77,611,3.0,3/26/2017,"I took my friend here for the first time because I love BJ's, and I was a little upset with the bar service. Paul started off as a good bartender, but the service went downhill after my friend didn't like his drink & my Parmesan knots were hard as rocks. Although the service wasn't that great we still tipped him well, but we will not sit at the bar when Paul is there."
Michelle M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",95,138,272,3.0,2/27/2017,"Dined here twice; Sat at the bar for wine & salad on a Sunday afternoon. Bartender was very friendly, but service could have been better. She was very busy cleaning up from the night before (not her fault) but it took her away from serving me and others thoroughly. I really enjoyed my bbq chicken salad, it was loaded with fresh flavors and was a perfect lunch portion. It did take almost 20 minutes to receive my salad, so don't go there in a hurry. See pic. Sunday dinner party of 5....very very slow service, had to ask multiple times for drink refills. We were constantly flagging down our waiter the entire night. At one point he literally disappeared - had to ask our busser for our waiter in order for us to place our dinner order. Ridiculous. The food redeemed the experience a little bit. I had Mediterranean chicken tacos, very good, I'd definitely order them again. Others at our table enjoyed their meals, except for hubby who had the $15.00 prime rib sandwich. Under seasoned and too heavy on the cheese.  3 stars for food quality, but -2 because of service issues both times."
Phylicia F.,"Houston, TX",195,32,63,5.0,11/19/2016,"Can I give this 10 stars!!! Last night my fiancé just moved to the Pearland area and have visited the BJ's a few times. However, last night was absolutely incredible!!! Our server was Robin and she was a pure breathe of fresh air. She gave service from her heart. You can tell she enjoyed her job. She knew the menu and even after my fiancé ordered the wrong beer she happily switched him. I mean from that to the perfect appetizer, to helping me decide on my entree. I couldn't have left happier!  I did ask to speak to the Manager on Duty- Katy who was just as pleasent!  From now on I'm only sitting in Robins section! If you visit this location, ASK FOR ROBIN!!!!!! You won't be disappointed! My FAVORITE BJS experience so far!  P.S. Put ""A Drink like that"" back on the menu!"
Sarah I.,"Pearland, TX",50,1,,1.0,5/27/2017,"This is not our first time here and every time before the service has been great. Today, it was terrible!! Our waitress had to be asked for water every time, she never asked for another alcoholic drink which they usually do, we asked for to go boxes 4 times, my salad was wrong, the Avacado in the egg rolls were brown, the sweet potato fries were super salty, our tickets took forever to get, half our food came out and the other half took another 10 minutes at least, we had to ask for sauces (ranch, sour cream, etc) 3 times. When we talked to the manager and he didn't seem to care too much. We were not expecting perfect service since it was graduation weekend but we have been in here several times before when they were PACKED and had way better service."
Kayte S.,"Alvin, TX",2,1,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"Was craving avocado egg rolls to take home for lunch, I ordered that along with a cookies n cream pzookie since they were only $3. Half way through eating the egg rolls at home noticed some of my egg rolls burnt which the first half wasn't that great at all either. Saved the pzookie for a few hours later and opened it up to the sad excuse of a cookie don't even think it was cooked all the way. BJ's has always been my go to restaurant when I can't decide... But today was the absolute worst experience for take out and quality/taste of food"
Rosa S.,"Houston, TX",8,12,15,4.0,5/20/2017,"BJ's is becoming one of my favorite spots to go or to pick up orders from! Love their easy to go through app! Love that we can pick up the tab through the app! Their food is fresh, and always served at the right temperature. Loved their Quinoa and Shrimp entrée, their Calamari appetizers. I don't eat vegan, but people that tried their Lemon Chicken Entrée, said it was delicious.Their kids meals are a bit on the high end pricing compared to other restaurants, but I would say that the kids meals portion is at least fair. Love the restaurant's ambiance. Modern decoration, spacious and clean. Their staff Is always friendly. The only thing that made me give it a 4 stars vs a 5 stars is the fact that waiters and waitresses tend to either come or forget about you LOL And another thing, I believe that whatever drink that has complimentary refill should always be refilled without a customer to have to wait to order it. Their curbside ordering is nice. You can order from the comfort of your home, and if like me it's a hassle to take kids down to go pick -up your order, it's nice that they have assigned parking spots where you park, dial the number on the sign and they get your order within minutes. I would definitely recommend BJ's!"
Maddison A.,"Central Southwest, Houston, TX",152,11,10,5.0,10/7/2017,"So a friend and I went to BJ's on a Thursday and got the 1/2 rack rib special with two sides and a salad. Both of our meals were exceptional. She got the ribs with fresh green beans and white cheddar mashed potatoes with a Caesar salad. I had the same ribs with fresh green beans and sweet potato fries with a tomato and mozzarella salad. Let me say this... the mozzarella so fresh that even days later as I eat my left overs, I can still taste the freshness of the cheese. I have frequented BJ's plenty of times throughout the years and I just wanted to give credit where credit is due. Sorry no pics because the food was so yummy that I forgot to capture this moment."
Junie K.,"Houston, TX",16,55,57,5.0,9/18/2016,"on Labor Day night after being stuffed with food I wanted drinks and dessert so we decided to stop by BJ's since they closed later than most places. We only had a few drinks and cookies n cream, peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia pizookies They were fantastic! The bartender was extremely informative about the range of drink they had to offer,  friendly and honestly one of the best! I wish I remembered her name so you guys can experience her. Had an amazing time ending my night here."
Amanda V.,"Manvel, TX",0,16,5,5.0,10/1/2017,"Adam with To-Go orders is so very sweet. He has helped me several times and has always been so kind.  I feel like he's genuine. Very nice young man.  Our food is always great, warm, and ready in the time that was quoted."
John P.,"Houston, TX",20,135,119,4.0,8/20/2017,"My first visit to this location. Here to celebrate my in-laws 63rd wedding anniversary. Reagan is our server tonight. First thing we noticed, none of the salt shakers work. Looks like they are all wet inside. When we asked Reagan about this, she said,  that happens to all their salt shakers every night. I guess they haven't heard of putting rice into the salt shakers  Tortilla soup came out not quite hot enough; we sent it back. When it came back it was perfect. California chicken club was done perfectly and the fries came out extra crispy just as ordered.  Hamburger was good, but significantly more greasy then it should've been. My father-in-law had the ribs. He said they were good, but he likes Friday's ribs better. Sarah, the manager, brought out a fried beignets with whip cream for their anniversary. Reagan did an awesome job for her third day. Given some time and training she'll be a superstar."
Crystal G.,"Houston, TX",138,69,228,3.0,1/5/2017,"I didn't know what to expect coming to BJs for the first time. It was a casual atmosphere and pretty comfortable. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was just okay. I probably wouldn't order it again. I ordered the seared ahi salad and it was good other than the ahi tasting very fishy(not fresh). We also got the guacamole burger with wedge fries and it was good, very tasty. Our waiter was very nice and polite. I MAY come back, but only for a pazookie to see all the hype."
Summer L.,"Pearland, TX",23,55,19,5.0,9/2/2017,I come here on a regular basis and it's always a good experience! Friendly staff and delicious food. Love this restaurant/this location!
Jose J.,"Houston, TX",0,1,4,5.0,1/7/2017,BEST BJ's EVER  Managers and waiters are really attentive  And the food here is delicious!  Of course if you come during busy hours It may take a bit to be seated  But well worth it.  My wife and I will be frequent guests here.
Tom M.,"Pearland, TX",32,67,6,1.0,10/23/2017,We hadn't been her in a while so we decided it would be something different and it was. Everything from the service to the food was bad. My wife ordered a Jalapeño burger and onion petals and I ordered a BJ's pizza. We also ordered two margaritas as they were $5 tonight. We waited about twenty minutes before they arrived. There was no salt on the rim and when my wife inquired the sever told us that the margaritas on special did not include salt. She then told us she would bring us glasses with salt and she did. Upon tasting the margaritas they were not very good to the point I didn't drink mine at all. The food arrived and my  pizza was luke warm where I could even hold the pan. My wife's burger was also barely warm and the onion straws were cold. At this point we didn't want to send anything back as we were tired and just wanted to go home. I have two daughters that are servers so I always tip well for good service and adequate for bad service. I can't say I'll return to BJ's again.
Wendy C.,"Pearland, TX",0,17,8,4.0,8/6/2017,"The hamburgers were pretty good. Like the portion of their kids meal. The kids meal comes with bread, fruit, entry, side dish and drink! We had great experiences there."
Jensen N.,"Houston, TX",1,4,13,4.0,8/20/2016,The Trio Pizookies is a must!!! My favorite is the White Chocolate pizookie.  The deep dish pizza takes forever but it surely worths the wait !
Kelly B.,"Houston, TX",0,13,2,5.0,8/13/2017,"This is getting a 5 star because JJ was the best server I've ever encountered. He is the best example of great service. He made sure we were take care of, very informative, and just all around sweet and caring person. I've been a bartender for years and it's hard to meet someone when you're on the other side that really impresses you beyond even your own expectations. He's your guy!"
Manuel E.,"Pearland, TX",397,118,93,4.0,5/18/2016,"The restaurant is pretty nice. It has a dim and classy decor, which I love. There are TVs everywhere - The staff here is very nice and always attentive. Pretty good food for a slightly higher price ($18-20).  I feel it reminds me of Cheesecake Factory with their large portions of mostly American Food, however minus Cheesecake!!!   I did enjoy their BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, and their Thick cut fries (something hard to find). Their Chicken wings are pretty darn good too! -Traditional wings (appetizer): I love how they make theirs.  Crispy and not too oily.  I always order this.  They do have their Pizookie (think cookie with ice cream on top), which is the main reason you come to BJ's.  We got the triple cookie sampler and chose Cookies and Cream and Salted Caramel (both good) and Peanut Butter (not good, and I love peanut butter).  I do like you can get a sample of several flavors at least. I am happy to have this restaurant so close to my neighborhood! I give this place 2 thumbs up!"
Jay Y.,"Houston, TX",655,1010,1822,4.0,5/8/2015,"Here are some reasons why you should plan your group dinner here: 1) Balanced ambiance between fancy and casual makes it fitting for most occasions 2) Diverse menu for American (new and traditional) and Italian cuisines that is guaranteed to have something for everyone in the group 3) Reasonable pricing (~$10 per entree) so no one busts his or her wallet 4) Solid food in nice portion to satisfy your entire group 5) Excellent service to ensure your dining experience is nothing short of great! BJ's is certainly a good dining spot for solo or family dining or a bar joint for sporting events, but I think this restaurant definitely shines as a top spot to plan a flawless group dinner! If this wasn't too far from my place, I would no doubt be a regular to this awesome restaurant!"
Justin T.,"Pearland, TX",1435,254,859,4.0,7/28/2015,"I have always been a fan of this restaurant.  Living in Houston, it is just so hard to frequent the same place when we live in a foodie town.  When my best friend said he was having a little birthday get together at BJ's, I got a little giddy.   I went to the Pearland location, which has never been a disappointment.  There was little to no wait, even with the size of our group.  We had a very friendly waitress, but the service was very slow.  That was the one factor that kept me from giving 5 stars.   Now we all know BJ's is known for their deep dish pizza, but on the particular visit, I went with the new Tavern Cut thin crust pizza.  Of course I still ate off other peoples deep dish just to get my fix.  I thought the thin crust pizza had great flavor, but it was not crispy as one would expect a thin crust to be.  I also ordered their own crafted root beer which was delicious.  You can not leave BJ's without having a pizooki for dessert.  I ordered the cookies and cream pizooki.  I have no complaint whatsoever about dessert.  I could probably eat a full size one if I didn't care about people judging me. Check out this place if you haven't already.  You won't regret it!"
Theresia J.,"Chicago, IL",113,2,1,4.0,4/17/2017,Love the restaurant. I was there in a Tuesday night and the wine is half off bottles and glasses.  The pizzas was under cooked  but they took it back and gave us a new pizza.
Ceseline D.,"Katy, TX",292,107,224,4.0,5/28/2017,Food is always fresh. Service is also friendly . Restaurant and facility look very nice as  well professional. Speed of service is great also. Very good job. Will be back
Jackie B.,"Pearland, TX",42,89,72,5.0,5/17/2017,"Dropped in for happy hour ""dinner"" yesterday.   We had never been and wanted to check it out.  We ordered the beef sliders, the root beer glazed ribs, and the cheese with chili dip and chips.   The cheese and chili dip was perfect.   Good flavor, good texture.  I though we would run out of chips, but then the other apps came!  The root beer glazed ribs were INCREDIBLE!  Nice and tender, with a fantastic taste.   Wasn't a huge fan of the slaw, but that's a personal taste. The big hit was the sliders.   We added cheddar and bacon (NO upcharge).   They came on the Hawaiian rolls.   Patties looked hand formed.   So tasty and juicy!  I wasn't expecting them to be THAT good.   And the fries were a good compliment (which we dipped in the cheese dip!!) Overall it was very very good.   Service was great.   And to top it off, the food bill was only $15!!!   Can't beat that!"
Fran C.,"Pearland, TX",1,63,25,4.0,8/22/2017,"Was here last night with a friend. I ordered the pomegranate sangria which was DELICIOUS!  I ordered the personal pan pizzas, the extreme pepperoni, and the mediterranean and both were great.  We also had the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer and it was good as well"
Sharon W.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,2.0,5/21/2017,"Stephanie our server was great, she suggested apps, entrees and visited our table a lot during our visit. She was very friendly and took great care of us. She replenished drinks a lot. Unfortunately we had to send 2 burgers back as they were raw in the middle. (Ordered medium) The burgers were replaced but this ruined the dynamic of our whole experience with 2/4 people having their entrees and 2 having to send theirs back especially with us having our 10 month old baby who began to get fussy.  The burgers came back later and were probably over cooked to medium-well instead of medium to compensate for the 1st issue of them being raw.  On another note, I am Not sure if the recipe of the burgers has changed or if it is the method of cooking them - but I noticed a 'chemical' char taste, can't really describe it but it didnt seem right. Great service, shame about the 2 burgers."
Shawna O.,"Pearland, TX",154,44,,3.0,2/5/2017,I do not care for the food here but do like the avocado egg rolls. I have ordered a couple other things and they were not very good. I do like the bar atmosphere though.
Elsa S.,"Pearland, TX",3,3,,5.0,3/24/2017,Best Margaritas ever and the food is excellent! ! I highly recommend!!! I always go to the bar and the Bartenders are very friendly and Emilio is the best one!!!
Samuel T.,"Houston, TX",1,34,8,2.0,10/17/2016,"I'm rating this place low, because of the ridiculous wait times and what was told to us. Our group came in on a Sunday afternoon, and I understand the Sunday rush. However, we were told by the hostess that the wait time was 20 minutes. We waited for 90 minutes! Because we were trying to have a lunch meeting, we opted out of leaving this place. Every so often, we were told that they were getting our tables ready, but to no avail.  We were finally seated and served. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, but it was nothing amazing. I think the long wait really dampened our experience. We were hungry and frustrated.  I'm giving 2 stars, because the Chocolate Chunk Mini Pazookie was really good and filling.  The service could be much better. I asked our waiter for utensils, and he kept forgetting. The servers also didn't know what they were serving, and had to keep going back to the kitchen to check.  I don't think I'll be returning to this location anytime soon."
Tita P.,"Pearland, TX",0,21,,5.0,10/4/2016,Good atmosphere and pizza . Their lunch menu had a good couple  choices... Its a big restaurant  with plently of space
Tashi L.,"Houston, TX",533,209,1337,3.0,10/7/2014,"I randomly ended up here after a long day at work. It was Wine Night (Tuesday), but I ordered a Pink Cadillac martini (my fav drink here). I'm not a big fan of their pizzas so I ordered my usual Cesar salad topped with buffalo chicken. And let the shenanigans begin! There is an interesting mix of people that frequent this location for one reason or another, and for that reason alone, I had a good time. We ended up chatting with the bartender (Hispanic guy, I apologize since I forgot his name) and some regulars on everything from real estate to the arts and cultural affairs. There's an old guy who's in some type of school/program for business who was a bit touchy-feely despite being married. One guy claimed to be 'newly single' after dropping 'every chick on the roster,' while another guy met up with a blind date off of Tinder! I promise, I can't make this stuff up. I ended up staying longer than I intended (I finally did grab a glass of Cab for half price) mainly because I'm nosy. If nothing else, I'd return for the wine and gossip."
Tony P.,"Hobby, Houston, TX",0,9,2,4.0,2/7/2017,Great appetizers and good food. Had the pizza and the Ahi Tuna salad and both were really good. The drinks were also good and fairly priced. I will be back for sure.
Michael B.,"Houston, TX",0,7,1,4.0,3/4/2017,BJ's always provides an exciting atmosphere with plenty of sporting events up on their TV's.  The spinach and artichoke dip was served hot and had great flavor.  We had a pepperoni pizza and it was definitely worth the wait.  Cold beer washed it down - can't get much better.
Tracie N.,"Houston, TX",570,165,487,3.0,5/22/2015,"Ive eaten at this location several times, I work near here and its easy to get to. Ive noticed that on Fridays, they have the music up real high compared to the other days. Not that big of a deal but I have trouble hearing what my coworkers are saying. Not always a bad thing? It's also kind of hard to get in and out in one hour. We're usually late to work if we eat here. The soup and salad is always good. The bread is a tad too toasted for my liking so I usually skip that. The cheddar soup and the chili are my favorite. I always get the wedge salad with that also because I love blue cheese and bacon. Who doesn't love blue cheese and bacon?  The Cobb salad was my favorite thing they served here but they got rid of it! I was bummed when the waiter told me that. Ive tried the Chicken Caesar salad was ok, they were heavy with the dressing. A little too tangy in my opinion. Theyre watermelon and cheese Starter salad. It could have used more of the feta and less onions.  The Asian chicken salad was ok. The portion was a little small though and the chicken was dry. It was loaded with fried wonton, I could have used more greens and less of the fried stuff. The Mediterranean chicken tacos were very good. I was quite impressed with how well they tasted. The quinoa that was with it was cooked perfectly."
Sharon A.,"Katy, TX",27,168,244,3.0,3/19/2016,Service was slow even though we were between lunch and dinner but the margarita flatbread pizza was good and the rest of my party enjoyed their food as well but again the service is enough to make me reconsider dining here if it's that slow when not busy!
