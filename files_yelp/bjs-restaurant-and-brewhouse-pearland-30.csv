Heather H.,"Pearland, TX",5,7,,4.0,5/18/2010,This place has something for everyone.  It is often crowded but you can call ahead. I usually end up with the parmesan chicken. I love the sundried tomatoes on it and mashed potatoes-- yum! This place also has the BEST rootbeer. Bottomless in a frosted mug.
Danny B.,"Pearland, TX",1,1,,2.0,4/26/2011,"The service was terrible. I sat at the bar for almost 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. There were three sometimes four people behind the bar and it seemed that they were more interested in socializing with themselves than taking care of the customer. The on duty manager seemed only old enough to have graduated high school within a few years and also seemed oblivious. This is a shame because this is one of the coolest eating establishments in Pearland, but it seems like they have really cut corners to save a buck. They probably deserve a rating of 1 star but I was considerate and gave them two stars because I was just killing time. I ordered a house salad that looked like it was a day old and avocado spring rolls that seemed like the only ingredient contained within was avocado. Don't get me wrong, I love avocado but wanted to taste something more."
Marc H.,"Pearland, TX",4,6,,5.0,3/10/2011,I love Bj's!!!!! The drinks are awesome! From the custom beer to Martini's it's really good. Everytime we go it's always packed. The food is really good too and reasonably priced!!!!! Love it!!!
Amanda V.,"Pearland, TX",12,163,,1.0,7/4/2010,"I'm sorry but when you make me wait for an hour and a half on a saturday night BECAUSE THE HOSTESS FORGOT ABOUT US... TWICE(!!!!!!!!!!) then you deserve no stars. Not even one apology.  Other than that, the food's decent enough. I've tried a little bit of everything here and nothing's been terrible. But the bad service really put me off so i probably won't return."
Michelle C.,"Pearland, TX",2,5,,4.0,9/6/2010,Great food. Huge menu. Very busy on Friday and Saturday nights
Miguel R.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,4.0,2/28/2011,"Was impressed when i first walked in, good combo of food and sports on the flat screens.  Started off with the Ahi Poke appetizer. The ahi,tomatoes, and avocados tasted really fresh and the wanton chips where crispy and went well. It was gone fast. Had the stuffed grilled chicken potato, it was big and was only able to eat half. Broccoli was a plus and the alfredo sauce was awesome. Since they took a while to bring out our food we got a free dessert. The apple berry burst crumble was go0o0o0d, crumble with vanilla ice cream and strawberries..mmmmm mmmm"
Anmry N.,"Bellaire, TX",79,184,5,3.0,10/28/2009,"Sometimes the service here is a hit-or-miss.  The pizzas can take a REALLY long time to get there but you can get it Chicago style since they specialize in pizzas and brew.  The root beer is great and so are some of the beers.  But if you, have patience, depending on what you ordered, you'll be rewarded."
Vena F.,"Pearland, TX",90,195,60,4.0,5/16/2009,we come here a lot more than i realized! recommendations: the appetizer pizza(thin crust) never fails!  the dumplings are absolutely wonderful! the tomato bisque is divine!  oh the avocado rolls!! we like this location for a quick fix of appetizer cravings!
Teju P.,"New York, NY",28,129,,4.0,2/17/2009,"This place is great to watch a game, chill out, or bring the kids. My friends live around the corner and frequent quite a bit! The avocado rolls for an appetizer are excellent. The pizza looks awesome! The service was excellent and everyone is very friendly. I defiintely recommend this place for a low key - chill out- hang with your friends - kinda evening!"
Misty T.,"Houston, TX",22,7,,5.0,10/22/2010,"I can't think of one thing I have had at BJ's that wasn't delish!  I love that they have a late night happy hour and happy hour prices during football games.  I have dreams about their Greek pizza..so yummy!  And all three sliders are tasty as well.  My favorite thing has to be their beer though.  I'm a sucker for a good beer and I have fallen in love with the Octoberfest beer this season.  We always sit in the bar, so can't speak of the service in the general restaurant area, but the service in the bar area is excellent.  Everyone is friendly and even take the time to say hi the next time you are in even though you may not be sitting in their section.  We have been in several times now and everytime it's an enjoyable experience and the food and service are always consistently great."
Kelli H.,"Pearland, TX",47,22,,5.0,7/2/2010,"My husband and I love BJ's - me for the food and him for the beer.  They have a very wide selection of food and their in-house beers are excellent.  I would definately recommend this place for a family dinner, date night, or get-together with friends.  It has a little something for everyone!!!"
Chris L.,"Pearland, TX",3,54,4,5.0,8/15/2010,"Everything is great here!  Food, drinks, service & waiter attitudes are awesome.  I come here often and have only eaten the pizza.  I love their pizza so much that it's the only thing I've ever ordered.  I get the California pizza for appetizer and a big BJ's Favorite pizza for dinner.  The microbrewery beers are also great.  They no longer brew their own beer since they contracted that out to St Arnold's Brewery in Houston.  I was told that St. Arnold's brews the beer from BJ's beer recipes."
Israel H.,"Houston, TX",11,12,,4.0,4/19/2009,"This is a pretty nice place to eat. I had been one other time and loved it. It has a sports bar feel to it yet an atmosphere of quality dinning. It has several LCD TVs carefully stationed around the restaurant. The bar area has one wall behind the bar dedicated to several LCD TV's that have been synced together to make one large screen for games or whatever is playing. Everything about this place is pretty nice. The food was excellent. I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. (brief description: Our marinated chicken breasts coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko breadcrumbs, lightly pounded and pan fried to a golden brown. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and topped with a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.) One draw back, the parking is quite away from the front door. Valet parking would have been nice yesterday. I was caught in there for a while due to the rain. Plenty of parking tho. All n all, good place to eat and enjoy a game or UFC fight."
jason j.,"Pearland, TX",2,77,10,1.0,11/24/2009,"bad service, overpriced, and the food was not that good when we got it.   i have heard lots of good things about bj's so took my parents there after a football game. the places was not crowded maybe 20% occupancy, but it took forever to get seated, then longer for our order to get taken. then when the food came out it was wrong. i father had ordered a chicken salad. it came out with no chicken and when my dad asked were the meat was he was informed ""wrongly"" that the salad had no chicken. my wife ordered a small pizza and never got it the entire time we were there even after asking for it several times."
Trent S.,"Houston, TX",2,3,,5.0,11/20/2008,BJ's is my favorite sports bar. The food is good and the prices are not bad.
