Sharlene H.,"Dickinson, TX",0,7,8,5.0,2/15/2016,We really enjoy eating at BJ'S specially since Chelsea is our waitress she is incredible!!! We are so sad that she will be leaving later this summer now we have to find if someone can fill her shoes!!!
Ernie W.,"Houston, TX",32,45,11,4.0,2/15/2016,"Good local spot to grab a quick bite to eat. I enjoy the fact that it's minutes from my house and typically easy to get a seat. Most people don't like the huge menu, but I find it rather appealing when I have a taste for different foods. Very hard to beat the Pazooki, which is the cookie dessert ala mode."
Corey W.,"Pearland, TX",935,167,391,4.0,3/10/2013,"Their Pizza is always good. They now have regular hand tossed crust in addition to their deep dish. I've tried both, but give the edge to the latter as I think it's more satisfying and  I like the atmosphere at this BJ's, no matter how many patrons are there, it never feels crowded and the seating area is far enough spaced apart to where you are not sitting in the next table's lap.  As for the bar, its not my first choice to watch a game as BJ's is more of a family eatery. The screens are only in the bar area and very high up so that you will have to strain your neck to watch, but that's okay, I'll travel to BW3 if I am looking  to drink beers and watch a continuous loop of games with the guys.  Outside of pizza, their dishes can be a hit or a hit or a miss. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT, ORDER THEIR SPAGHETTI!  The turkey burger is above average as are their wings and wraps. The pizzooki is one of my favorite deserts anywhere, others (Champp's and Cheddar's) have unsuccessfully tried to imitate the freshly made cookie topped with ice cream, but to no avail.  Their proprietary beers are usually pretty good,(I prefer the light switch lager) but I'm not sure that they are still brewed in house.  Overall I like BJ's, especially this one. They now have a rewards program which makes me even more likely to visit."
Nicole P.,"Manvel, TX",18,38,6,5.0,1/17/2016,"My favorite lunch spot. Lunch specials are amazing. I love the half salad (caesar) half sandwich (California chicken). I also love their Jeremiah Red brew, fried artichokes & thin cut fries"
Katie D.,"Pearland, TX",29,38,1,5.0,10/24/2015,"Love the menu, the energy & the bar. Emilio is a great bar tender - keeps it fun and remembers you on your next visit."
Emily B.,"Houston, TX",2,37,2,2.0,1/22/2016,"First less than good experience here. I ordered my usual, the balsamic glazed chicken. Instead of the usual spinach, it arrived on a bed of iceberg lettuce. I realize they're both greens, but there is something unappetizing about hot chicken and mashed potatoes on top of lettuce. As soon as I cut into the chicken it felt off. I kept having to check with each bite that it was cooked. It almost seemed to have a skin on it. It didn't taste bad, but quality seemed poor. My fiancé got the grilled chicken club. It kept falling apart, which he attributed to the avocado, and he too made a statement that it seemed that his chicken wasn't  cooked right, almost like it was just boiled. His fried were good, and my jalapeño cucumber margarita was good. Hopefully just an off night. The server was very nice and attentive."
Amanda R.,"Pearland, TX",0,7,4,5.0,2/8/2016,"We had the best waitress! She's been in pearland two weeks from Waco and pearland is lucky to have her! She was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. Awesome experience!! The jambalaya is great- a bit spicy but full of flavor. This review was for the location in pearland at 11200 Broadway St, Suite 1700, Pearland, TX 77584"
Larry S.,"Seabrook, TX",15,44,39,4.0,7/20/2015,Lunch with quick service. Had the California Club Flat Bread and salad. Food was good and server was on top of her game.
Mike B.,"Pearland, TX",1,40,6,3.0,1/31/2016,"Some of the best pizza around I think. We have been here a dozen times and the service has been good sometimes and horrible. The place gets really busy so try to get there early. All the staff and management are always friendly. It's not really my first choice, but the beer and pizza is what I always prefer there"
Pichoudam P.,"Philadelphia, PA",1174,114,38,5.0,5/24/2014,Amazing service. Amazing food. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great beer. It's a little pricey though. Everything starts at 10 dollars.
Reagan M.,"Lake Jackson, TX",171,70,9,5.0,10/20/2015,"First review here but I've been here dozens of times and always have a pleasurable experience. Beer selection is great, mixed drinks are a little pricey. Pizza is the thing to get here. The mushrooms are nice and buttery. And be sure to get the pizookie."
Jennifer D.,"Austin, TX",89,166,220,4.0,4/14/2014,"They have a huge menu, which is awesome and bad at the same time because I can never decide what I want!  They have quite the variety. Their drinks are very good. I have not ordered anything that I didn't like. Service is usually very good and the facilities are clean."
Melissa M.,"Houston, TX",175,1388,4254,3.0,5/17/2010,"Nice big place in the beautiful new (and lacking in shade) Pearland Town Center!  There are tons of options on the menu from salads, burgers, pizza, etc... We came here for lunch and the sesame chicken salad was delicious. They put little fried won tons on top which make it perfect.  I had the honey crisp chicken salad which is good but the lettuce is a bit too finely chopped.  Next time I'll get the sesame chicken salad like my friend.  I do like the atmosphere of this restaurant over several others in the area. It's a nice bar/restaurant with pleasant waitstaff. It's a 3.5 star type of place to me.  Why can't I round up to 4 stars?  They serve PEPSI! Nasty. Ick. So, 3 stars it is."
Amy G.,"Pearland, TX",7,13,1,5.0,9/1/2015,Love this place. Great atmosphere for family meal or Girls dinner out. Great drinks. My favorite is their Chicago style pizza and I really like their oriental chicken salad. It's so fresh and flavorful.
Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,2.0,5/6/2012,"Pizza is the main appeal and that's why I give this overpriced restaurant 2 stars! The steak salad is pretty good too.  But whatever you do, stay as far away from the ""gourmet"" mac and cheese as you can. Trust me when I tell you, there is NOTHING gourmet about that mac and cheese.  It's as dry and overcooked as I don't know what. They should be ashamed to even serve that mess. 3 cheeses? doesn't take like even one cheese was included in the preparation. And for $4.25!!!! sigh anyway... We went around 7pm on a week night, wait wasn't too bad, decor is nice. that and the pizza are the only things going for it. After a couple visits, eh....i'm over it"
Jeremiah H.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",48,96,40,5.0,2/24/2015,For some deep dish pizza this is a go to spot. I love the Jeremiah Red not just because of my name. If you go you have to have the spinach and artichoke dip and also the mini sliders
Arlene W.,"Houston, TX",11,52,27,4.0,6/9/2015,Very tasty food for a chain restaurant! My favorite part of our meal were the cocktails and combo appetizer. The drinks were on point and awesome- one of the drinks uses both grey goose and Bacardi 151 which my boyfriend loves. Not a lot of places make drinks with top shelf liquor as one of their signature cocktails. My boyfriend got a burger and I got chicken fried steak. I didn't love mine but I've also never tried chicken fried steak before so I can't say if I didn't prefer theirs or chicken fried steak itself. My boyfriend's burger was delicious. Overall a solid meal! Plus you can sign up for their reward thing and put yourself on the waiting list through an app- very convenient!
Ayesha A.,"Houston, TX",129,100,22,4.0,6/21/2015,I end up going here a lot. Consistent food and consistent service. I like the happy hour and the half price wine nights. There's a lot of variety with the food so you can always try something different. I had the parm crusted chicken last night and a glass of chardonnay ....not bad !
Abel A.,"Stafford, TX",3,3,7,5.0,3/9/2014,"Out of all brew house restaurants hands down BJ is the best,I had a great server chilled at the bar section,had a great view of there huge tv!yes no projector here!!!great Panasonic jumbo screen!i got to watch the basketball game with no problem,my serve was on point suggested a great appetizer and the menu was great even says what goes great with each type of beer,I enjoyed the relaxed vibe that this place puts out,I would definitely bring friends or spouse to enjoy delicious food and burgers I absolutely loved the Mediterranean tacos they just put on the menu!!will come back for sure !!!"
Frequent D.,"Pearland, TX",0,2,,1.0,5/12/2016,Just tried to get a table of 8 with three young starving children. They told me it would be a 20-25 minute wait. I watched five groups seated before and the last straw was when they seated s group of 6 with a child. I returned the buzzer and we walked out. Don't expect to eat if you are of a diverse ethnic group or bigger than they are willing to seat.
