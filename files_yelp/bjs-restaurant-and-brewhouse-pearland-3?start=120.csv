Mike D.,"Lake Jackson, TX",27,122,34,3.0,3/11/2014,"BJ's is a fairly solid restaurant that does some things very well.  If you stick to burgers, sandwiches, and pizza, BJ's is a solid 4-stars.  However, the few times my wife and I have ventured into foods that don't fit into those categories, we've been very disappointed.   Also, this restaurant seems to do well seating large groups.  It tends to be a bit loud, but with loud children, that is a good thing.  There are many TVs with sports on, so Sunday during the NFL season is great."
Sarah W.,"Pearland, TX",0,3,,5.0,9/7/2015,"Just moved to the area and we are loving BJ's!! So far the cherry salmon, meat pizza and burgers have all been good!! And the pizookies- are phenomenal!!!  The service has been kind and pretty quick considering there is usually a wait to get seated! Hope you like it too."
Tamara B.,"Texas City, TX",24,13,3,5.0,10/20/2015,"This has to be my most favorite place to dine/drink/hangout at in Pearland!!! I really enjoy the service and me being so particular with my food orders, the staff is always willing and able to accommodate!!"
Chante J.,"New Orleans, LA",0,5,,1.0,10/16/2015,Well first of all the hostess lied about our order! The manager was any help and was not sympathetic. What I was worst it was for my birthday celebration. I won't be back to this BJs. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else either.
Katie B.,"Pearland, TX",8,22,14,3.0,5/28/2015,"Awesome customer service and there Pazookies are so good! But the food is not really that great, taste cheap."
Jon S.,"Fort Myers, FL",9,10,,4.0,2/25/2015,"Great food, awesome service.  I have never had to ask for anything (drink refills, silverware, the check) before it was offerred.  Great home made root beer!"
Amy B.,"Dallas, TX",322,672,474,4.0,5/1/2012,"I've been to the BJ's in Addison (Dallas) a few times, and this one is a little better. The waiter was more on top of things even though it was still busy, and my miso salmon was PERFECTLY cooked (albeit the rice was a bit mush for my taste). I'd be back. Ladies, try the berry burst cider. It's my go-to drink at BJ's! :)"
Allison F.,"Pearland, TX",0,12,,3.0,9/6/2015,Subpar food. The pizza is pretty decent. Good drinks. Nice atmosphere. Nothing to write home about honestly. The bartenders are pretty awesome if you sit at the bar. My family loves the pizookies.
J M.,"Lake Jackson, TX",3,105,1,5.0,3/16/2016,"Visiting BJ's seems to be hit and miss.  While not the best pizza in town, their self acclaimed beers are worth the stop by!  I started the dinner off with the Golden Beet and Arugula salad.  Now, I do NOT count myself as a salad type of a guy, but this is a salad that even I really enjoyed!   They have set the new expectations for salad now!   My wife had some other kind of salad that she also liked.  BUT, it wasn't the GBA salad I had, so who cares....    Then, off to the main event... Um meal.   I really wanted the BJ's favorite but wanted to try out that flat bread they had (but didn't care for the options offered on the menu).  Turns out, you can request a real pizza toping (the BJ's favorite - for a reason I might add) on the flatbread!   DEAL!   And yes, it was as good as I was hoping.  Top it with their specialty beer or their IPA to wash it down.    Ahhhh - now that's how ya do it!"
Veronica N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,13,4,1.0,7/7/2015,Me and my husband went to dinner on Sunday . I order some Jambalaya I had about three bites it taste funny so the next day I had food poison
Phobie L.,"Houston, TX",1,19,,5.0,7/12/2015,Great taste on gluten free food. They take extra time to make sure everything is safe.
Michelle C.,"Manvel, TX",1,12,7,2.0,3/31/2016,"I come here all the time, and today I am just very disappointed with everything. The crispy calamari that I ordered was not crispy at all. It was really soggy for some odd reason. Matter a fact, the fried part around the calamari was falling off. I ordered the crispy jalapeño burger and my boyfriend ordered the cherry Chipotle glazed salmon. Those dishes are the dishes we always order, and they would taste amazing. Today, the burger was so bland. It really did not taste like anything at all. I felt like I was just eating poorly unseasoned meat patty with wet lettuce and tomatoes, even the jalapeños did not have must taste....weird right? My boyfriends dish, his salmon was really tough. Tasted as if, the salmon have been microwaved, not fresh at all. Reason why I give 2 is because our server was wonderful."
Alexis R.,"Houston, TX",25,20,,2.0,3/7/2014,"I'm giving it two stars because my food came out fine, but my party wasn't so lucky.  1) service. Ha. 2) they ran out of fish on the first Friday of Lent. Poor planning, because the other meat-free options on the menu are sad. Except the gluten-free cheese pizza because it is pretty dang good. 3) my father settled on a burger that came out pink. Our server tried to tell him they all come out medium. Medium is not pink all the way through. He couldn't stomach anything else, so that was that. BJ's Pearland get it together. You have so much potential to being more than a bar."
George C.,"Upper Kirby, Houston, TX",85,29,4,4.0,7/1/2015,I literally come here once a week it is so good. I like the atmosphere and the wide verity of menu options. Also very interesting beer combinations along with other drink options. I almost always get the chicken cantina tavern cut pizza. I love it
Laura S.,"Houston, TX",77,450,1587,2.0,10/3/2011,"Arrived Saturday night at 7pm.  The place was packed.  I was excited about eating, since so many people were there.  After eating, I didn't see the big deal.  Order chicken fresca it was o-k.  The wild berry mojito was not good.  It tasted like syrup mix and not fresh muddle mojito, regardless of what the menu says.  The mint leaves were fresh and so obvious they weren't muddled. Husband ordered the pot roast.  He thought it tasted ok but was turned off after a couple of bites.  I won't be returning.  Too many other options, why would I waste my money here.  The waiter was ok. Pros:  nice setup/layout  Cons: food doesn't taste fresh, newbee wait staff, overpriced food See pics of food I posted."
Jose P.,"Rosharon, TX",1,28,2,4.0,9/6/2014,"Good menu... best in the area. Beer selection is good, special the craft beer. Service is very good.  Kudos to Yohandra for taking care of us...."
Raul C.,"Allen, TX",8,60,65,1.0,12/13/2014,"Wow, tonight was another disappointment. It took a long time to get our food. The personal pizzas were soggy since they waited so long to be delivered. The lights were lowered half way thru dinner. My parents (as well as other tables) had to use their iPhone flashlight to read the bill. Way understaffed to handle the crowd. Our waiter was really nice and trying to do his best.... Probably won't go back."
Dani B.,"Lake Jackson, TX",11,19,18,5.0,8/10/2015,"The owner of the company I work for came down with several investors and our accounting department from California and he asked that I organize a nice luncheon for our company. I called about a week and a half before hand and made reservation and asked if we could sit in a quiet area, specifically the back right side of the restaurant (I had been here several times before and knew this was the most quiet area). When we got to the restaurant they had a huge table with menu's, silverware and water waiting for our whole party. Our waitress was extremely attentive and was running around like she was running a marathon (and she was preggers!!). We ordered a few of the appetizers that had a little bit of everything on it and they came right out and it was all so good, we then turned around and ordered the fried calamari and it came out minutes later and it was fresh as could be! When it came time to order lunch our waitress had the whole menu memorized and was able to answer all questions we had about it. Of course I had to be the most difficult one and asked about the cobb salad that used to be on the menu, she said that they no longer had the turkey or the dressing but said that she could have it ordered if I didn't mind the no turkey or dressing. So I ordered the cobb salad with light ranch and blacked salmon, and OH MY GOSH it's still the best salad ever! Of course you cannot go wrong with ""BJ's freshly brewed root beer"" (St. Arnold's) with any meal. Two of our staff members had their Birthday's recently, the waitress had overheard this and brought them both Pazooki's with candles! Seriously, how sweet is that!??! In all, our luncheon was superb, the staff was so friendly and prompt, the food was delicious, and my team had a great time at a restaurant with such a wonderful atmosphere. Thank you so much BJ's!"
M P.,"Houston, TX",0,153,,4.0,7/26/2014,"Yes,  its a chain,  but the food is good,  the service is excellent,  and the prices are reasonable.  Drink prices are fair and they were willing to make dietary accommodations on the entrees.  Great place to go when you don't what you want.... They have a bit of everything."
Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370,4.0,12/16/2012,"Wow, the Tai chicken mango salad ( which is new ) was awesome. Gaby was our waitress  and the service was good.  Let's start with a ""healthy"" portion of fried mozzarella sticks, kiddos ( and the big kids too) loved them. Since I started my lunch off on clearly the right foot, I choose to get one of their salads. I went new and I hope it sticks. Great combo of spice with the Tai chicken, and add sweet topical mango to off set the spice, very well done BJs. The greens, not to be left out were just as fresh and crisp. My wife had their Santa Fe salad and she too had a similar experience of greatness. The kids had sliders, which my son enjoyed and my growing teen, she went buffalo boneless wings, her thought was a tad spice for her, but that's her palate. I tried and for spice lovers such as myself, they were just fine. On tap, they have a nice variety of specialty micro brews, I tried this visit their Irish red, I'd give it 4 out of 5, Murphy's Irish red and Killians are still both better brews in my opinion. For beer lovers and kill a gift or two, but $50 Gift card and get a free beer glass, better off buy $100 gift card and get a set of 4 beer glasses. Cool, but I collect beer glasses, I love this promo. Service from Gaby was good and she was a capable waitress."
