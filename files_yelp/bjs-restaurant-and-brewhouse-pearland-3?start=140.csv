Diana E.,"CHESTNUT HILL, MA",5,15,,1.0,7/18/2012,"The customer service at BJ's in Pearland is insulting.  We were regular customers until last Saturday night.  The food was always mediocre, kind of like Applebees or Bennigans, but the location was convenient.  But this experience ensures we will never return. My husband had a beer.  With about 1/3 left in the glass, the waiter came over and accidentally broke the glass on the table.  He cleaned it up and returned with a very small glass.  We asked ""what's this?"".  He said that since there was 1/3 of a beer in the glass, he was replacing it with the exact same amount.  Since he was very young we explained that common courtesy dictates that he should come back with a full glass of beer and an apology for spilling the beer and breaking a glass. The manager came over and said that he would only replace 1/3 of the beer, because ""We are trying to run a business"".  We explained that he would lose customers with this attitude and he stormed off. I have never heard of serving anyone 1/3 glass of beer.  It's not the missing beer that is the point, it is the rude attitude and customer service.   Needless to say, we will never go back to BJs and their 1/3 beer policy again."
Francisco M.,"Evanston, IL",7,196,3,4.0,9/21/2014,"This place had some nice beer and pizza. The waiter was very nice and helpful. The beer selection was decent and the pizza was delicious. Even though it is a chain, it didn't feel like one."
Joey Y.,"San Francisco, CA",2,8,,2.0,8/13/2012,"BJ's is known for its pizza. Ironically enough, the pizza tasted the worst and that's saying something considering the rest of the entrees. Everything was cold before it even hit the table. The fries were soggy and limp. And nothing about the meal was remarkable. Actually no, that's not true- the meal was remarkably disappointing.  Now our waitress was really sweet and nice, but I can't say the same for this other waitress. When my mom asked her for ketchup, she walked right by without stopping and blatantly ignored us. I understand that she's not the one serving us, but she didn't  have to be so rude. She could have acknowledged us and said, ""Your waitress will be with you in a moment."".  The last time I went, the food was delicious. I don't know what happened this time around."
Cerise S.,"Pearland, TX",11,65,12,4.0,5/31/2014,"Got here at 7:45. Had a 30-35 minute wait. I was starving, but we decided to stick it out. While the crowds were waiting to get seated, waiters came out with plates of sliced pizza to serve to us. Additionally, they had someone from the bar taking orders so we did not have to try to squeeze into the even more crowded bar area. The drinks were served quickly -- all 4 of our drinks were mixed. This was a great call on the part of the manager. We all ordered deep dish pizza---excellent! Will go again. Really good food, beer, and mixed drinks."
Lindsay T.,"Pearland, TX",2,11,10,5.0,10/29/2015,"Clean restaurant, friendly servers, and delicious food! Their burgers and chicken are to die for! Also many different kinds of beer if you're a beer drinker. I will be back to this location again and again!"
B M.,"Tomball, TX",26,32,19,2.0,7/14/2014,"I eat at BJ's maybe twice a week in Corpus Christie, or North Houston. I tend to order the same meals I like (Moroccan salmon, and a black berry tea). For staters the tea was not made correctly way to much flavoring had to ask for water to mix it myself, and the salmon did have the right seasoning on the outside, however inside taste like it was sitting in water to thaw (no flavor). Also ordered the Chicken lemon and it was very bland, but the bread was good. The services was not great, and very forgetful. I like BJ's overall but not the one in Pearland TX."
Jonathan R.,"Pearland, TX",76,62,44,2.0,3/12/2012,"Our experience. Waited to be seated, waited for waitress, waited for her to come back, waited for our appetizer, after finishing the appetizer waited 20 odd minutes for our food. The majority of our visit we spent waiting. What should have been an hour took over 2 hours. The food was good. The service wasn't."
Susan S.,"Pearland, TX",0,5,,2.0,11/14/2015,"Ordered take out for the first time here.  Mistake!  Usually get the Santa Fe salad with salmon instead of the chicken when I go to the restaurant....ordered 2 to go.  Well, what I got was two Santa Fe salads with chicken AND salmon and was charged $17.50 EACH!  The menu says $14.50 when you substitute with the salmon....I called the manager,  Katie who seemed somewhat apathetic when I explained I ordered Santa Fe salads with salmon...NOT chicken AND salmon.  I couldn't believe they gave me both.. and CHARGED me extra.  She said she would credit me, but haven't seen it yet.  Will NEVER order take out again.  May never go to the restaurant either!"
Heidi O.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,4,,1.0,10/11/2015,"We just spent $55 here and left hungry. The fried calamari was bland and greasy. The chicken Alfredo tasted like a frozen dinner. My husbands $19 rib dinner contained 4 rib bones, a scoop of mashed potatoes and 5-6 green beans. My son enjoyed his burger. They were nice enough to take the cost of the Alfredo off and give my kids a mini pazooki, but we won't be returning. The quality of food is parallel to frozen dinners but with a bigger price tag."
Maria Z.,"Fresno, TX",1,4,,1.0,5/15/2016,First of all I give it a 1 because I can't give it a zero. First my water...tasted  like it came out of a rusted faucet..disgusting ..so I ordered a sprite ..that had a flavor that I did not like.I told the waitress that it had a wierd taste also. She told me it was Sierra Mist..I did not ask for Sierra Mist. I asked for Sprite..she says I'm sorry.. wow . At that point I was disappointed. My food was mediocre..I order spaghetti with meatballs..It tasted spicy but the meatballs looked like they were dry and just came out if the microwave.They looked dry and tough on the outside. I ate my cesar salad halfway..There was sauteed brocoli..I don't know if they do thiers that way but mine did. I gave up my dinner was ruined. My daughter did not like her food nor did my grand daughters . My son n law ate half of his   jambalaya but said he never would come again. First and last time we come and then our bill was     $82.00..ridiculous .
J S.,"Pearland, TX",1,47,,4.0,7/12/2015,"Food is good. Pizza is one of the better ones you can get in a chain. I've had their ribs, bison burger and club sandwich and all were very good. The ribs were easily two meals and the sauce was borderline excellent. Service is very good in general. They do have call ahead seating, but I have never had to wait longer than 30 minutes. I don't drink so I can't comment on their craft beer. But their craft root beer is delicious."
Ninad O.,"Houston, TX",34,43,27,5.0,5/19/2014,"I have developed an addiction to the deep dish pizza of BJ's. With their craftily brewed beers and amazing cocktails, it's the top restaurant in Houston and a must go for every local as well as a visitor."
Katie M.,"Pearland, TX",4,3,,3.0,8/22/2014,Always come here and it is usually outstanding in every category. But tonight I came and the service is awful. I order a soda three times and never got it. The waiter is slower than a snail with everything. I'm every disappointed with my visit today.
Chris H.,"Pearland, TX",36,173,2,3.0,11/23/2011,First off the one thing you don't want to see or smell when you enter or exit a restaurant is the dumspters. They smell horrible and you have to walk past them to get to the door. The only way to avoid this problem is to park across the street at Jared's.  That being said this place is no more than a more expensive Chili's. Menu offerings are about the same just more expensive. I have tried various items on the menu and always end up with the pizza. The cajun pasta is good and spicy but for $15 is a bit pricey. For my entire family to go (wife+3 kids) it is close to $75. This is without alcohol.  Food isn't bad but it just isn't what you expect for the price.  Atmosphere is ok it can get loud during busier periods due to the open concept.
Sally G.,"Columbia, SC",0,8,,2.0,4/26/2014,"Have been to other locations and usually always enjoy all aspects. Last nights visit was first time we were really disappointed. One meal came with grilled chicken instead of blackened; waiter took plate back and returned with same plate but with blackened chicken. By this time though, the pasta was cold. One would think the waiter would have checked that. Another guest with us received totally wrong dinner and had to wait almost 10 minutes for her plate to be brought. Manager did come out and apologize for the mishap and asked if they could provide a complimentary salad or dessert which was nice. The dessert was asked for but the waiter never brought it. A rather disappointing night out and probably won't return."
Darlene B.,"Pearland, TX",73,13,1,4.0,8/13/2013,"Appetizer freak!  Oh goodness, They're avocado rolls are to die for!!! I also like their sampler platter - a bit pricey but totally worth it. I also tried they're sesame chicken salad which is splendid! Its that special sauce they have which really goes good with the salad and they grilled chicken and slices of tangerines are perfect combo. I love love love they're jambalaya! Super hot and SUPER good! Not New Orleans good but it works for me. lol :) Ive had a couple of their pizza which was pretty good for Originality. When my dad and I goes out for our daddy-daughter dates  goes we always go to BJ.s Brewhouse most of the time, always get a bunch of appetizers to munch on and LOTS of Mojito's for me :) My dad likes his wine. I love they're Berry Mojito's it just taste perfect. This place can get a little crowded due to the hot spot and quality of food, and wee bit noisy but its a perfect setting for dates on a quite elegant night. Waiters are very friendly and Desserts are OH MY GOODY! :) Overall experience? Very Satisfied."
Sherry C.,"Houston, TX",90,231,148,4.0,1/23/2012,"My mom is a sucker for chain restaurants. She thinks Olive Garden is ""fancy Italian"". When she suggested BJ's for my aunt's bday dinner- I just went along with it. I looked up their menu online and saw they offered lighter options for their food & drinks.  Went with a party of 7 and I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the grilled tilapia and my mom had the Honey Chicken Salad. The portions are huge- we shared both plates and we had half the salad left over. The fish was delicious served over rice, cooked to a perfect flakiness. The salad was mostly chopped iceberg lettuce so nothing exciting about that.  The high-light of my night was the Skinny Ritas. 130 calories each drink, they add a splash of orange juice and they make them strong. Not strong where you can't enjoy it- but strong enough to make you happy after one drink.  Service was good, she did forget my grandpa's roll & to refill my son's drink but she was nice and I was happy with my drinks so I didn't speak up about it. OH!! I am almost forgetting the 2nd best part- the strawberry beignet dessert. It was gone in 30 seconds flat. The 7 of us inhaled it...it was divine & sinfully good.  I hate to admit that I am fan of BJ's Brewhouse...I am- I guess my mom was right."
Derrick W.,"Houston, TX",0,6,1,3.0,7/17/2015,Love this place ! Always popping for happy hour. Food is great ! And make sure you get a dessert
Jennifer N.,"Pearland, TX",1,5,2,5.0,7/15/2015,"I've only ordered take out from here, however being someone that often orders take out in Pearland, this place is the best. They are polite on the phone and know how to take food orders without ever getting it wrong so far. I recently used the curbside take out option and it was great! I always order the grilled salmon with white cheddar mashed potatoes and it's delicious. Of course the pazookie is still great to go!"
Shelly H.,"Pearland, TX",13,30,3,4.0,9/3/2011,We usually go for the late night bar specials. we went on Saturday night and the waiter we had ROCKED!! Part of the special was the mini pizzas are 1/2 price...they're more like a regular place's small pizza. Pretty good stuff. The sliders and mozzarella sticks on the starters menu aren't really worth it - I'd skip those.  The only thing we dislike A LOT is that you have to walk past the very stinky dumpsters to get to the door. It's nauseating walking in and has been more then nauseating walking out. FIX THIS BJ'S....and not with a million little smelly pine trees hanging from the fence. It's just nasty guys.
