Paul H.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,229,21,3.0,8/2/2011,I'd really like to give it 3.5 stars because my visit was a bit better than just okay. We had the Chickens a la fresca which was a new item and also the Thai lettuce wraps. The Chicken dish was just okay and lacking the flavor I was hoping for. The Lettuce wraps were good but not so good that I had to run out and tell someone. What I really enjoyed were the microbrews. They have 8-10 microbrews and we tried every one. I liked the beer better than the food.  Later I was told that the pizza is the best item on the menu and also the only thing anyone should order. Would have been nice to know that earlier. BJ's reminds me of a PJ Changs atmosphere but switch it to American Fare (if that makes any sense). It was just okay but I'll give it another try and go for the pizza next time.
Roni V.,"Midtown, Houston, TX",14,56,57,2.0,12/1/2013,"Good food + bad service = takeout! This place is very consistent with slow and careless service. Our waitress mixed our tables order with the table next to us, we waited 30 minutes for corn fritters. Finally the kids got their food. They were done eating and so was the other table who came in after us before my husband and I ever got our meal...ridiculous. Never sitting in here again. At least one of the managers, Justin tried to accommodate."
Paula G.,"Houston, TX",28,56,,4.0,10/31/2011,"I like this location way better than the one near 59S....I order the same meal at both locations, the Pearland location was the best! I will visit it more often!"
Keith R.,"Houston, TX",26,34,25,5.0,10/23/2013,"This, in my opinion is by far the best restaurant in Pearland; and by far the best fresh craft beer you'll find in the area.  Great happy hour deals, good pizza, excellent menu of comfort foods,and clean safe comfortable atmosphere round out the reasons why this is my go to destination in town.  Oh yeah, they're open 'til midnight every night!"
Nickol O.,"Pearland, TX",6,11,1,3.0,3/27/2014,"I think the service is good, and the food is okay. Being a vegetarian, there isn't many options beside a pizza or salad. Being someone who has worked in the pizza industry for years, I'm not a big fan of going out and ordering a pizza. I do like the Grilled Chicken Pasta (without the chicken). Doesn't sound like much, because it really isn't. Pasta with some creamy sauce. I do like the rootbeer and the pazookies though. And by that I mean I LOVE pazookies."
Marney G.,"Pearland, TX",158,12,7,3.0,10/17/2014,"We used to really enjoy this restaurant but it's been sliding downhill. The beer selection is great. The menu is extensive but the quality and execution can be hit or miss. We started out the night disappointed that the BJs app wasn't working for the preferred wait list seating. We put in a reservation but the hostess said the app wasn't transmitting anything to the restaurant - so what's the point? However they did have a hostess passing around pizza bites and they did get us seated within 10 minutes. It took a LONG time for our server to even come for our drink order; by the time he came we were ready to order our meal (which seemed to fluster our server).  It took 30 minutes for our salads to come - seemed especially slow tonight! Then there are the little things - our menus stayed on the table the whole time, we had to ask for every drink refill EVERY time, and it took 15 minutes of waiting for the condiments to come after our burger was served. The burger and kids pasta were meh - not terrible but wouldn't likely reorder them. That being said, we loved the Pizookies, the pear and walnut salad, and the deep dish pizza. The Hefeweizen beer was especially good! :-). It is a fairly good place for kids - especially older school aged ones. Good portions for them!! Overall, there are a lot of restaurants in this area of Pearland; quality and consistency in food and service are important to entice folks to be repeat customers."
Jessica T.,"Alief, Houston, TX",1,5,,4.0,1/27/2015,"The Tuscan chicken limone is SO delicious!!! It might be too lemony for some people, but for me it's perfect. Top it off with some Parmesan cheese and it's super perfect! The service is kind of slow. They don't really pay much attention to you if its a big group."
Sherwin S.,"Sugar Land, TX",727,394,42,4.0,12/17/2010,"If you are going to BJ's in the Houston area for food, then chances are you will find something you like. They are obviously known for their ""Chicago"" style pizza's, but the only thing Chicago about them is that they are deep dish. They do not invert their toppings like a traditional Chicago style pizza.  My wife loves their Great White pizza...a variation on the traditional red sauce pizza. This alfredo sauce pizza has good flavor...more than enough to support all that bread!!! I usually like their BBQ Chicken (a classic) or the BJ's favorite (lots of meat). The best thing is...you can do half and half, even though they might tell you they can't with one red sauce and one white sauce.  However, the one thing that sucks about all Houston area BJ's restaurants is their beer. BJ's in California is a traditional brewery...with most of them brewing on site while the others contract out to other BJ's restaurants. In Houston, BJ's contracts out to Saint Arnold's, who in turn only makes their basic year round offerings plus 4 seasonals. I used to love going to the BJ's in California and having my choice of two seasonal beers per restaurant (and every restaurant seemed to have a different two selections) that rotated out frequently. Basically, in any given year, I could try over 30 seasonal selections at BJ's. In Texas, we are limited to four. So yes, Houston being the fourth largest city in America has great housing prices and the cost of living is low...but damnit, I need more beer at BJ's!!!"
Jessica D.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,5.0,3/11/2015,Went here for lunch on a fairly busy Saturday and had great service which is always a good sign. I had the fried chicken plate since it was on the favorites menu and it was delicious! The cheesy mashed potatoes and corn succotash were great. And the white gravy won me over because I'm usually not a fan of the glue like mystery paste some places try to convince me is white gravy. But the chicken! The chicken! Moist and flavorful with a crispy batter that clings to the meat and doesn't fall off into the potatoes. The pink lemonades were good too very refreshing. I had two and kind of wanted to take another one for the road but I showed a little restraint. In all I would definitely eat here again.
Dani D.,"Frisco, TX",17,115,73,2.0,3/13/2011,"I got an insert for this restaurant in today's Houston Chronicle, so I decided to get a takeout order for dinner. I have never been there before, but it's not far from home and the Ahi Tuna salad looked really good on the insert. I went to the take-section and ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, although it wasn't on the printed menu they still had it in the system. I also ordered the fried artichoke bites and I decided to try the beignet for dessert. The young lady that took my order was SUPERB. She was friendly and helpful and offered me a drink while I wait, so I tried the tropical iced tea. (It comes unsweetened, so be prepared for that) It took nearly 30 minutes for me to get my order, which was shocking because I thought I ordered some simple food (how hard is it to make a salad with rare tuna?) By the time my order came, I had finished my tea and they gave me a refill for the road. I started with the fried artichokes on my way home because I was pretty hungry when I got there. They were lukewarm, which says to me they had probably been sitting while the rest of my meal was prepared and packed, but they were pretty good. The ride home is about 7 minutes door to door.  The ice cream that came with the beignet made the trip just fine and I put it in the freezer while I ate the rest of my food. I finished the artichokes, which was a pretty good sized-portion. The salad was a lot of lettuce and a pretty good portion of sliced tuna with it. The dressing it comes with is a sort of vinaigrette and it's pretty good, but I opted for bleu cheese because I wasn't sure what to expect. I ate about half of my salad and decided to try the beignet. This is where the real disappointment set it. What BJ's called a beignet turned out to be a pretty big dinner roll with cinnamon and sugar baked on top. Think Thanksgiving butter roll. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? $5.95 for a dinner roll? That's clearly not what a beignet is supposed to be. In summation: the server was nice, the wait was too long, the salad was good, and the beignet was ABSURD!"
Jana M.,"Houston, TX",38,9,1,5.0,6/11/2013,"My husband and I are obsessed with their homemade rootbeers!! We even bought a ""bj's"" jug so we can return with it and get refills to take home!"
Irina S.,"Pearland, TX",4,17,17,5.0,12/11/2014,Love this place. Haven't tried anything I didn't like. Good for watching a game or for large dinner parties.
Travis M.,"Pearland, TX",2,10,,4.0,1/26/2015,"Overall, an average BJ's location. The kitchen does tend to shut down long before closing and the service is hit or miss. The menu and food, however, are great. 4/5"
Jonathan L.,"Pearland, TX",37,10,5,5.0,4/15/2015,"Bj's is pretty awesome! Nice variety of menu options. In a state that has pretty dismal pizza, the deep dish pizzas here are the best in Texas!"
Andrew L.,"Houston, TX",74,139,12,3.0,5/21/2013,"Nice big place in the Pearland Town Center!  Parking is easy and its your typical brewhouse atmosphere.   They serve the typical salads, burgers, pizza, etc... If there prices were a bit lower, I would give them a higher rating."
W D.,"Houston, TX",1,24,1,5.0,1/11/2015,This is a great restaurant! There is a wide selection of food to choose from. The GREAT WHITE pizza is a must try! It is incredible. They also have a good selection of beers to choose from. The restaurant is casual and good for families.
Dana P.,"Bixby, OK",0,22,,5.0,9/4/2011,"We love, love the avocado egg rolls. They are wonderful and come with a very flavorful sauce. My favorite entree are the grilled pork chops, which are about the best I have ever tasted. Another great dish is the mozzarella and tomato salad. It is out of this world. The service is good every time we go and we appreciate the fact that we don't have to pay too much."
Ew C.,"Pearland, TX",0,8,,2.0,11/17/2014,"We having been dining at the Pearland location for 5 years  as a couple, with large groups and for business dinners and luncheons. Having said that, we have witnessed a sharp decline in quality of food, service and value of the items one would consider.full dinners. We stopped in after church for what we expected to be the same high quality service and food we have come to expect from BJ's. Sadly, the menu choices have been reduced except for the three ""B""s"" (beer, burgers and bar food). When we ordered the fairly expensive ""special"", we found the food to be overcooked (fish was dried out and steak well done instead of medium rare) and the veggies to be undercooked and nearly raw. The food arrived cold and the waitstaff forgot to bring the special dinner salads. I finally captured our waiter long enough to ask about the salads, and ended up putting them in ""To Go"" boxes.Once we started in on the meal, I found the steak to be overdone, tough, uncuttable and basically inedible. My wife's fish selection was overdone and inedible. I tried the secondary scallop dish and mine tasted very ""fishy"" indicating to me the scallops certainly were not (to put it kindly) not fresh. We complained to the server and finally the manager, who to his credit, gave us 50% off a different selection. At this point, we just chose ""bar food"" flat bread pizza appetizers and unboxed the salads which we found to be sparsely populated  and expensive for what we received. Appetizer pizza was OK, made with some sort of cracker like material, not a made to order crust like they did, at least to my recollection, several years ago. This place is not for the individual looking for a good dining experience. It has become, sadly, a ""sports bar"" catering, again, to to the 3 B's; beer, burgers and bar food."
Cynthia G.,"Houston, TX",18,38,2,5.0,1/13/2013,Love love the food at BJ's this location is excellent their service us great!
Pete B.,"Pearland, TX",0,124,2,4.0,11/22/2014,"We always enjoy this establishment, but last night was top notch! Our server/bartender Will was on top of his game, and the service was outstanding! My Salmon was delicious and my wife said her Kale Salad was tasty too! Kudos!!"
