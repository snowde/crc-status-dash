Natasha B.,"Pearland, TX",150,53,357,5.0,7/18/2010,Great food had a blast @ happy hour.
Nate M.,"Seattle, WA",182,159,78,3.0,9/19/2010,"Just thinking about eating here makes me nervous.  Now, I say that not about the quality, price, flavor, or anything like that...it's all about the fact that of the two dozen times I've eaten here, EVERY time I've left so full I felt like I wanted to die and was down 50 bucks.   This place is huge, and is one of the biggest and busiest spots in West Pearland.  It's only a tiny bit less busy than Gringo's, so keep that in mind if you were planning on verbally communicating with anyone in your party and/or are averse to a 45 minute wait.  The menu is ginormous and depending on when you ask me thats either awesome or really frustrating.  On average, I find around 6 items that I'd like and hastily point at one when the wait staff arrives.  The beers are pretty good and served as if it were a true brewhouse, even though there's no actual brewery there (only a problem if you're a brewer yourself and get caught up in semantics).  The tatonka stout is by far the best beer on the menu though its a little odd that its probably the least advertised and the one they consider a ""dessert beer"" (whatever that is) and that it would go great with a giant skillet cookie.  Pastas are pretty good, cheeseburgers are pretty good, never had the pizza but watched my partner do his best to shut one down on many occasions, and the fish and chips are, well....they tried.  Do yourself a favor and skip the later pages in the menu.  But be prepared to coach yourself through eating some of the biggest portions this side of Texas and pay for it the whole rest of the evening. Have you ever wondered how you miraculously racked up a 50 dollar bill with a couple of cheeseburgers and beers?  Well, get ready for de ja vu.  I'm not sure if my mental math is bad or if there's some bermuda triangle style arithmetic bend inside of here but almost every time I go I think my bill is going to be 30 ish and it ends up way more.  Maybe I should skip the 7 dollar beer next time..."
Nancy L.,"Houston, TX",106,30,120,4.0,10/26/2010,"Great establishment to have in my neighborhood!! Place is always busy. Service is always good. Great place for game night. Food is always consistent.  Everytime I come to this place, Im NEVER hungry. I dont know why. First thing I order here when we wait for a table is a glass a wine, and their specialty brew (which fiance LOVES!!) I forget the name.... something with the word RED in it.. who cares....  Well, when I go there, I always order the same thing, all the time. It's not even real food, but i get the calamari extra crispy, and it's ok. I dont really know why I always order it. Nothing that stands out from all the other restaurants. I think I order it bc I always feel pressured to order something.. anything... And then their string fries!! I LOVE string fries!!! They also put parmesan garlic on it, but for some reason, they always forget to put it on my order, so I always end up receiving the regular fries. and they're still good. Im just too nice i guess. I should complain next time.  Fiance has tried their Chicken Parmesan with a white wine sauce (???)  a few times, and that's our favo dish there!!! It's amazing everytime. And also their hamburger pizza is pretty delish!!  We've tried a few other things that were pretty common, and forgettable. But we like to stick to what we normally order bc that's what keeps us going back!!"
Annie G.,"Pearland, TX",2,35,,5.0,11/20/2012,We live closeby and always rely on BJ's when we cannot decide what we want to eat. Almost everything is pretty yummy. The kids love it here because they can be loud and noisy and no one cares. of course we have to make sure they are behaved and not breaking things and walking all over the place. WE HATE THAT!  Even though BJ's is know for thier pizza - i usually get the santa fe salad without the chicken and tomato basil soup.  hubby loves the pizza. the kids usually split an order of the mac and cheese from the kids menu(its huge portion and very very good)  sometimes if we are really hungry or with a large group we order apps and get the spinach dip and the avocado rolls to share amongst us and yes the pazookie is off the hook Never had a problem with the wait staff. always friendly and courteous
Renee K.,"Pearland, TX",0,3,,2.0,5/13/2013,"I used to quite like this location but lately, the product has been lacking.   I suppose the most disappointing thing about my last visit was the cocktails.  The ""Strawberry Patch"" ($9.75) was so incredibly sweet that a child would have loved it - there was zero indication of alcohol.  The mojito ($7.95) had 3 perfectly formed mint leaves and an unscathed lime in the bottom of the glass - surely any bartender worth his or her salt knows that the idea is to muddle the greens to release their flavor, then add the liquids. This is just the most recent in a far-too-forgiving list of disappointing visits to this location."
Sedricka J.,"Houston, TX",1,1,3,5.0,10/30/2012,No wait on a Thursday night. First visit. I really enjoyed the experience. Manager greeted everyone at their tables. Waitress was very informative and prompt. There was Soo much to choose from. Food and drinks. Love the selections. This is my new spot.
Chris T.,"Missouri City, TX",16,119,30,2.0,7/5/2012,"The service at this location is good. However, I am not sure why the reviews are this high.... the food is Bland/average at best.. I have yet to find a dish that i would describe as ""good""."
Ashley W.,"Pasadena, TX",9,6,,5.0,5/31/2013,YUM. Love their bacon cheeseburger pizza and chocolate chunk pizookie!
Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,3.0,2/26/2012,"I would have given it a solid 4 stars but the host staff was horrible. We arrived around 8:00 on a Friday night and was told the wait for 2 would be 15 min. Which surprised us because it was packed. So we decided to wait (initially we went to gringos and the wait was close to 2 hrs). After 15 min had passed my sister asked how much longer should we expect to wait and was told another 15 min. And we were ok with that because that's what we figured in the first place. 20 minutes later we walked over to the bar and asked a server if it was open seating, she said it was and we grabbed a table someone was just getting up from. It was almost 20 min after that when our buzzer finally let us know our table was ready. By that time we had drinks and our appetizers. There was no apology from the host staff about the 15 min wait that turned into over an hour even when it was mentioned. The host looked at me like she had no idea what I was saying.  Now on to the food and service. Our server was ally or abby (can't remember) She was really nice and helpful. Sister had the bruschetta and I had the snack size mac n cheese and garlic bread. It was amazing! The bread was perfectly cooked and she loved her bruschetta. And the mac but not so good the next day. We also each ordered pizzas (1/2 price during happy hour!!)  And though we weren't able to finish them (SO FULL) we did enjoy them and they warmed up nicely the next day in the oven! I'm willing to go back next time I visit. Probably not during such a busy time as their hostess staff clearly has no clue how to guesstimate wait times. There is quite a difference in 15 min vs over an hour! (I've been a hostess, I know its not always accurate but there is a method to getting pretty close)"
Neff H.,"Houston, TX",1,13,,5.0,6/8/2014,It's never a disappointment here. The food is good and the service. Although during peak hours you can expect a bit of a wait to be seated or even on the service but nothing that is not expected.
Dan M.,"Sioux Falls, SD",1,258,,4.0,4/23/2012,The staff and management here work very hard to be sure you have a good experience. That is a nice change of pace from the numerous places that just really don't seem to care. Great menu with lots of options for everyone.
Robert F.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/4/2013,"I'd give it half a star if I could. Went there with a large party for lunch. Restaurant was maybe half full and did not appear super busy. Service was extremely slow, food cold, Burger uncooked. Not just mine but all at our table who ordered similar. Manager mostly avoided us, server was inept. Won't go back."
Gina T.,"Houston, TX",4,74,17,4.0,3/6/2014,"Everything I get is good here. My fav is the grilled chicken club, so yummy. Even the ranch dressing is good. The chocolate chunk pazooki is also awesome!"
Mike W.,"Austin, TX",373,161,62,4.0,11/10/2008,"Big menu.  Big dining room.  Nice selection of their beers to go w/ a full bar.  It's pretty cheap, and my experiences @ couple of locations has always been pleasant. The Pearland location is pretty damn new and I was impressed.  The interior is wide open w/ super high ceilings and various Americana motifs on the walls.  Think murals and flags, not rusting antiques.  Behind the bar is an absolutely massive TV and there are a few others sprinkled about.  My server was great.  Honest recommendations and critiques, we rolled w/ his recs and were happy.   Recap: good, cheap food.  Nice setting.  Good for boozing, or dinner w/ the fam.  This place is comparable to a Champp's except with its own beers and w/out the stupid-ass extra ""p"".  That's why it gets the 4*'s."
nina m.,"Houston, TX",0,24,,3.0,5/27/2012,I hadn't been to BJ's in over a year and their service has gone down hill.  I had to correct our server twice on the dish I ordered.  He seemed upset but all I was asking was what is indicated on the menu.  Their cream soda is still Pimp.  I'll come back but i'll do take out next time.
Steven M.,"Houston, TX",2,2,,1.0,2/5/2012,"Just eating at BJ's PEARLAND, Houston. I ordered, Thai shrimp raps and FOUND CHEWED UP GUM on my plate. So the manager named Jake, came to my table said that he just opened and got on, then said that it was cabbage and I told him I tasted it and it had a spearmint taste. Then tried to tell me "" if you say so"" then called me ""Bro"". I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION TO ANYONE!"
Courtney A.,"Jacksonville, FL",17,56,70,1.0,6/10/2013,"Worst  calzone ever!! All thick bread, no cheese or toppings! & it was $10 &was the size of a small stromboli, smaller than any calzone I've ever seen. The nachos, also $10, had hardly any cheese or toppings. I got the Thai marinated chicken salad. The description boasted ""Bibb and arugula lettuces, and grilled marinated chicken, wonton strips, avocado, marinated jicama, mango and red bell peppers in a sweet sweet chili dressing. The chicken appeared to be poached, no flavor at all, there wasn't any Bibb or Arugula at all (but at least they did put it on spring mix) there were no wonton strips, so much dressing the lettuce was soggy, and the ""chili"" part of the dressing was an overwhelming amount of chili powder sprinkled all over the top of the salad. I basically ate the avocado and chicken and some of the mangoes and left the rest. It was $11.50. The kids burgers were ok. My husband had a beer flight, said all for of the beers he got tasted exactly the same. We definitely will not be back here, and wouldn't recommend it."
Vanessa I.,"Pearland, TX",5,16,,3.0,9/8/2011,"My family and I went to BJ's this past Friday, my steak salad, meat was burnt, we had NO silverware when our food arrived..took forever to get some. Waiter barley checked up on us. Asked for salad dressing on the side and they took forever to get to us (even after they gave my mom and I our salads) it wasnt a good experience"
the p.,"Pearland, TX",33,2,2,5.0,8/16/2011,BJ favorite pizza is the best thing! Shrimp lettuce wrap for starters is terrific.
Shawn P.,"Houston, TX",60,257,18,2.0,6/7/2010,"The two times that I have dined here have been 2 totally different experiences. To be fair, one of my experiences was take out and take out experiences tend to always be a little different.  Let's begin with my dine in experience. The restaurant is beautiful. The decor is fresh and modern, which of course makes for a nice dining experience. After we were seated, our waiter appears with a half hearted smile. It wasnt that he was rude or anything, he was just  shy as a baby kitten. He had no small talk skills...he was more of a hello, how may I help you kinda guy....this kind of waiter is best suited for a fast food joint; in my opinion. The Food: The menu is massive. There is a little bit of everything offered at this joint. The menu reminded me of the menus of Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory. For a foodie like me, having a million choices is a good thing, because I always want to try one of each (LOL) however, my dining companion and I decided on the ""Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo"" that has all of their most popular appetizers. This was WONDERFUL! By the time we finished it, we were nearly stuffed, but being the troopers that we are, we ordered entrees. My dining companion ordered ""Dereks Meatloaf Sandwich"" which she said was good, but couldnt eat but 3 bites...I ordered the basic BJ Burger which was just a burger-nothing really to write home about. I took a few bites and we both took the remainder to go. I finished my burger a day later and it was decent....the same goes for the meatloaf sandwhich (according to my dining companion). Good experience...yay! About 3 weeks later, I decide that I want more of BJ's because my first experience was so good. So I call in and order their Chicken Fried Steak along with the cheddar mashed potatoes and fresh veggies. Go in to pick it up...the cashier was nice and very cordial. Get the food home, plop down in front of the tv with my trusty tv tray and begin to eat....to my disappointment, the chicken fried steak was more than disgusting! It was dry; as if it had been cooked for too long...the meat nor the batter had any flavor whatsoever. Who screws up chicken fried steak anyway? I coulda went to Ihop and got a better tasting CFS!  Needless to say, this take out experience was the pitts. Either they have no clue what chicken fried steak is supposed to taste like or they just didnt care that they screwed it up...either way, it was a big disappointment. I give BJ's 2 stars because they halfway got it right...1 of the 2 stars is for my good first experience. The other star is for effort. Should I give them another chance? It remains to be seen."
