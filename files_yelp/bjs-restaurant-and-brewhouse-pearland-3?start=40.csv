Lorena T.,"Houston, TX",196,212,574,3.0,3/16/2016,"I have visited several BJ's restaurants but I have to say each one needs to work on their service.  On this particular occasion it was a group of 6.  We had to wait to be seated but mind you, the place was literally empty at about 4:00 pm.  Once we did get seated it took a while before anyone came to take our drink order.  We finally got our drinks, then we ordered.  It took about 30 minutes for us to get our meals.  Our waitress was very nice but was not good at following up and clearing the table.  Their margaritas have way too much of the sour mix and I couldn't finish mine.  I did let the waitress know and she took it off the table.  I like BJ's menu selections but what keeps me from really loving the place is the amount of time it takes to get anything.  Third BJ's I have visited and the story is always the same."
Ivenise C.,"Houston, TX",76,28,26,4.0,7/1/2016,"The burgers are good, their stouts and porters are awesome. The avocado eggrolls are a most. The only thing is that the service is very slow!"
Aubri H.,"Pearland, TX",37,1,1,5.0,9/4/2016,"Definitely our favorite restaurant in Pearland. Nice atmosphere, big menu & everything's been delicious. Favorites include the burgers, sriracha mac& cheese, mahi mahi tacos. BJ's beer is solid - try the porter. And the pizookie (homemade cookies baked in a mini pizza tin) is warm sugary deliciousness. But what makes it great are the people, especially manager Courtney, and always ask to sit in Robin's section - she is excellent!"
Michale B.,"Houston, TX",41,24,55,4.0,6/4/2016,"Okay so first time here. First off, Molly our waitress was outstanding. Got the Deep Dish Mediterranean Pizza, not really a true deep dish but very tasty. Wife got flat bread pizza, pretty good, could have cooked the bottom about a minute longer. Tried the 4 beer sampler, all was good. Even tried Ginger IPA, pretty damn good! Overall good food, even better beer. We will be back!"
Alan E.,"Oklahoma City, OK",108,50,5,2.0,6/11/2016,"Probably the worst and rudest service ever.  Food mediocre at best.  And I'm surprised because BJs typically is better.  Other patrons were also complaining about the slow service.  We just couldn't get the server to come back to our table for any reason.  Anyway, I'll be avoiding this location in the future. Edit:  Manager contacted me regarding my experience and review.  This shows good customer service, so they get another star.  I now plan to return so I hopefully get to raise the rating even higher."
Brandon T.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Manager is very poor at dealing with customers facing issues with the restaurant. She didn't offer any sort of compensation. Only half of the food came after having to wait an hour. About thirty minutes later, the second half came out but two of the three were made incorrectly. The group of 6 of us left immediately. We appreciate the cooperatively of the waitress but the manager was the worst at dealing with the issues."
Jo G.,"Houston, TX",226,25,41,2.0,3/26/2016,I was really craving soup. I saw that they serve Chicken Tortilla soup. One of my favs so I really was looking forward to my meal. Ordering it on the phone went well. Big points to them. Going to pick it up was even better because of their curbside service. So even more points. I ordered a salad as well and ate that first. Awesome. Points awarded. But that is where they stop. The one thing I was waiting to enjoy was a big disappointment. My Chicken Tortilla soup was missing a key ingredient....chicken. I felt like I was playing 'Where's Waldo?' with my soup. The entire bowl had one morsel of chicken. Not cool and no points!
Erin T.,"Pearland, TX",63,55,12,4.0,2/4/2016,"I've been here numerous times and that's why I have a four. Would I go back? Yes, but the service varies. It seems that the more crowded the restaurant is, the better the service. Strange, right?  I can't recommend anything specifically because I have never had the same thing twice. The beers that I have had were normal and the food was good, but generic. It tastes the same at all BJ'S. Not to say that's bad or anything just same. I will be back because my children love the kids menu and it's affordable with a family friendly atmosphere."
Thomas H.,"Pearland, TX",0,1,,2.0,7/16/2017,"The food was mediocre, and doesn't have many options for those who are gluten or diary sensitive. Service was slower than average. There are better places to goto in Pearland."
Ginger D.,"Danbury, TX",0,2,,2.0,7/4/2017,We have eaten here several times and it's expected to have to wait for a table.  BUT this trip the steak was not even meat...all fat.  I'm not sure what was put in our food and/ or drinks but we were sick the rest of the evening.  I think they need to monitor the kitchen a bit better!
Karen L.,"Pearland, TX",300,44,32,4.0,10/3/2016,"I've been here multiple times so I thought it was finally time for a review. After recently moving to Pearland, TX from Upstate NY, I've noticed this restaurant is a town staple. I've gotten to try assorted things on the menu- the California pizza, calamari, Brussels sprouts appetizers, jambalaya pasta entree, and a couple of their burgers. The food is average to mediocre. The pasta lacked flavor and I would not get it again. I expected more from the burgers. Both times I ordered it medium and it was quite well done, no pink in it at all. Most recently I got the burger with bacon and BBQ sauce and that lacked flavor despite the bacon. The Brussels sprouts were seasoned well and mostly tasty, but some pieces were charred and unpleasant. The ambience inside is 5/5 for watching sports or having group meals. Lastly, the pizookies are to die for. I've tried almost all of the flavors, ***salted caramel is my favorite. Service is a hit or miss depending on who you get, independent of the time or day you go. Overall, with a 3/5 for average food and 5/5 due to dessert, I give this place a 4/5. I'll definitely come back again if I get a sweets craving!"
Lou C.,"Houston, TX",510,807,7608,4.0,4/5/2014,"I love the light meals during the happy hour. Price and selection are just right. I was peeking at the menu while waiting for my party to arrive and thought, ""Mmm... Let me sample the food first."" I had a lettuce wrap with diced chicken and vegetables. It was stir fried with Asian base. I love how it was already flavorful, I didn't need the dipping sauce. The waiter warned me on the pungent yellow mustard. The lettuce leaves were carefully trimmed to a bowl shape. I just wish they could be a little fresher. My friends recommended the pizzas afterward. Certainly, I'll try them at a BJ's near my house."
Celeste G.,"Pearland, TX",37,128,178,4.0,2/3/2016,"My sister took me here for a birthday dinner. I am eating healthy and the waitress was more than helpful and kind in taking my order. I'm not that demanding.  I had the starter salad (spinach, bacon, eggs). They substituted the bleu cheese for feta cheese and put the dressing on the side (vinegar and oil). Then, for my entree, I had the lettuce wraps. They held the Asian crispy wonton flakes and the sauces were on the side.  I appreciated this so much and it makes dining out much more easy. :)"
Collette C.,"Pearland, TX",18,77,39,2.0,3/11/2015,"I remember this place use to be a ""high class chilis"" . Well i dont know if it is this location but it is definitely not what it ised the be.  I got the soup and salad lunch special. I swear the broccoli cheese soup is cambells cheddar soup from a can. Preservative overload!!! Calamari had no flavor , chew, not crisp at all and cold. Tried the tomato basil soup and had no flavor as well. Never got tea refilled one time. The place isnt crowded either.  Got a pazookie...... um...... where is the cast iron skillet?"
Jerry A.,"Houston, TX",999,265,318,3.0,5/8/2015,"I like the avocado eggrolls and other shareable appetizers that are on sale during happy hour. The wings are pretty good, but I have to ask them to fry them hard. The drinks are pretty good depending on the the bar tender."
Herman L.,"Houston, TX",30,113,264,3.0,2/21/2016,"This is place is a lot bigger than I thought.  Plenty of screens all around if you're watching sport, and there's a variety of tables to pick from.  I went for lunch on a Saturday, so it wasn't all that busy.  Their own beer was very good and went well with the pizza I ordered.  Pizza portions are large but came out a bit salty for my tastes.  Service was good though.  My friend ordered a bottomless soda and the second one came out before he could finish half the first one."
Karen L.,"Manvel, TX",1,37,1,3.0,4/22/2016,"This place has food that is hit or miss... My favorite thing here has to be their dessert I believe they call a piezookie? It is delicious. .who doesn't love cookies and ice cream Just as the food is hit or miss so are the servers...one day you'll get amazing service and other days you don't The last time I went with my husband was our worse expirience yet Our waiter took forever to take our orders because he was too busy talking and flirting with a coworker ...we waited over 30mins just to have our orders taken Meanwhile I kept looking right at our waiter talking and laughing yet he had the nerves to come over to us and say he was ""held up""  (I don't mind coworkers talking to each other but please take our orders first then go socialize because at least our food will be cooking while you goof off at your job) We haven't gone back since but I am sure one day we will"
Kelly S.,"Manvel, TX",207,66,467,3.0,12/20/2015,"I've been frequenting this location for years. The older menu was better,  in my opinion.  Cheeseburger pizza and a Jeremiah Red. It was the best combo.  I could get that or a baked potato. Then they changed the menu.  I loved the chicken limone pasta.  Then they changed the menu.  Again. Calm down, BJs!  Last night we stopped by after watching The Force Awakens and they were packed but we got in quickly.  +1 point.  I ordered a black and blue and they had no idea what that was.  Come on!  Seriously? They call it Dark side of the moon.  -1 point The kids wanted mozzarella sticks which have been perfect in the past.  Never had any issues before but tonight they were practically cold and crumbly. They were pathetic.  I can get better cheese sticks from Sonic for a heck of a lot cheaper.  -1 point I was craving one of their deep dish pizzas despite the fact that they killed my cheeseburger pizza. It tasted good but came out 5 minutes before everyone else's food.  So I just say there with a pizza in front of me because I want going to eat in front of everyone.  Not cool,  Bjs. -1 for delivery, +1 for taste I will tell you that they have AMAZING beer dinners occasionally where the beer keeps flowing.  I actually have to ask them to stop serving me because I get so toasty. All for $35 and a six course meal. Totally worth it.  +2 points All this being said, I'll be going back.  Even though the menu changes more than a woman changes shoes.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night?  Hey,  at least they're open late!"
Vlad V.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",189,671,188,5.0,4/5/2015,"BJ's is my favorite chain. Why you ask? A huge menu. Great food for a chain. A brewery with some quality brews. Good happy hour specials. A good-looking restaurant. Coupons sent out to members. Done and done.  Went with the 20% take out special as I was becoming hungry watching Duke beat up on Michigan State (go blue!) in the Final Four. Went with the potato skins appetizer which never disappoints and then the parmesan crusted chicken which comes with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli (which I replaced with a cup of tomato soup). So much food, it'll last me for three meals."
Shelby C.,"Rosharon, TX",4,4,,1.0,11/27/2016,Well went to BJ's  chef decided he wanted me to eat my food the way he wanted me to instead if the way i wanted if.. i complained to the manager and then the nosy man next to our  booth decided he wanted to stick his nose in my business so i told him where to go. You paying for my food you can cook it and tell me how to eat it.. i pay for my food i want it the way i want to eat it. Bad chef .. good waiter.. nosy people..  geez
