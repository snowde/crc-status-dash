Kierra W.,"Pearland, TX",374,32,21,4.0,9/21/2016,I don't think I've ever made a bad choice at BJ's. All the food is fairly good. I just have a thing with restaurants that have an extensive menu. It can be overwhelming.
Debby F.,"Houston, TX",244,146,156,4.0,2/3/2016,"I've been to a few different BJ's and they're a consistent chain. Somehow in the last week, I've been twice.  BJ's has a Cheesecake Factory style menu - maaaaaax options available. It's a great spot for lunch, and service is good.  I've been eating like a mad woman so I wanted something healthy-ish. Their lighter items are marked so you know which ones they are and their number of calories. I've had the Mahi Mahi tacos, which were quite tasty. Is recommend those.  And I also tried the blackened chicken, which was pretty good, but not worth ordering twice. It's off on its balance of heat and flavor. Heat is hot and flavor is overpowered by cumin.  BJ's has a big selection of beers, drinks, and wine as well. I'd also say they're a good hh spot if you have a local BJ's in your area."
Farran M.,"Houston, TX",347,258,443,3.0,3/22/2015,"Dined here for lunch yesterday with a few friends. The service was very slow for the light crowd, but it wasn't terrible.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious, so it was hard to make a decision. My girlfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the shrimp scampi. Both were extremely delicious.  I've been to BJ's several times and each time I leave I'm highly satisfied. I wasn't particularly fond of our server's timeliness yesterday, but he was making an effort so I can't completely discredit him.  I would rate BJ's 3.5 if there was that option. I'm sure I'll return because the food is great and the price is right."
Linsey C.,"Pearland, TX",0,14,4,2.0,5/14/2017,Food is GREAT.. the service can be much better. My mom and I waited 10minutes for our server to greet us and take our order. Our waiter didn't properly greet us nor did she seem very happy to be working. The restaurant wasn't even busy. Do better Pearland BJ's... do better...
Lana M.,"Houston, TX",13,50,45,5.0,6/5/2015,Can't say enough good about this place! We continue to visit time and time again. Can't wait until people come down to visit us just so we can take them here.
Juan J.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1,2.0,10/4/2016,"My girlfriend and I decided to go for the pozooki. It was a great dessert but the service and clam chowder soup was no more than mediocre. Our server was never around, she didn't write our simple order so had another server come and ask. When it was time to pay she was no where to be found. My girlfriend had to get up out of her seat to go had my card to the bartender who eventually found her. The soup had a very fishy taste and smell to it, which could come from different variables but I doubt it is meant to be served that way. Not sure if I would go back any time soon."
Rhett B.,"Sugar Land, TX",280,73,291,2.0,12/9/2015,BJ's used to be one of my go to lunch spots however the quality of the food I feel is taking a step backwards. We started off our meals with soups.  I had the tortilla soup which was good and Ali had the chili which was not so good it was a runny and lacked really any flavor. For our meal we shared the California flatbread pizza which was in my opinion subpar.  To top everything off our server was not very attentive at all and could not remember to bring us our napkins and silverware. Getting the bill paid was another experience in weights which just made to the overall visit one I would rather forget.
Mabely G.,"Clute, TX",0,8,,2.0,9/25/2016,The waiters and bartenders are more concerned with talking to each other than actually working. Do not recommend going here.
Byrdi G.,"Houston, TX",79,68,89,3.0,10/3/2015,"3.5 stars..plus side ambience  is cool..not too loud. Wild berry mojito are delish. Ahi salad was fresh and tasty as was the clam chowder.   Shrimp scampi  pasta didn't  meet my expectations,shrimp  wasn't fresh nor grilled just pre cooked like in shrimp  fried rice...not good. Overall place is good for bar food like hamburgers, wings,pizza etc.. would return but not for a gourmet  meal."
A T.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",29,112,373,2.0,1/17/2016,"Mehh. We opted for this place after watching a movie at a nearby theatre, and it was around 10pm. We were seated promptly by a nice hosting staff.  Food: we shared a small vegetarian deep dish pizza, with italian sausage added to one side. It had a lot of cheese and enough veggies. My only complaint? It was very dry even with all that cheese. I don't think it has any tomato sauce at all. The cheese and veggies weren't enough to give it any impressive flavour.  Service staff: our lady server was friendly, only I think she was busy, I think. We were left waiting around for her most of the time. It took 10 minutes between getting the check, another 10 for her to pick it back up, etc.  Atmosphere: it's a brewhouse, much like a TGIF's, you get the loud crowd so it doesn't make much for a close setting unless you're ok with that. Especially during a wild football game... bring your ear muffs! Or are they provided?  Last thing: we were handed oily plates with clear fingerprints on it. Yuck."
Rosalind C.,"Manvel, TX",102,212,202,4.0,12/12/2015,Good place to watch the game and have drinks. Not to loud and their servers always do a good job and the food is good. They have a HH during all NFL games which makes going even better. The apps are all half off and the have 5$ personal pizza.
R C.,"Frisco, TX",321,235,1005,4.0,10/4/2014,"The IPA, great! The pizza, really good! The chocolate chip cookie, AMAZIN! The button stuff mushrooms, really good. The service provided by Katlin, as good as the cookie! I would frequent this place again."
Dileep P.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,2,5.0,9/19/2016,Great Environment. Great Ambiance. Friendly staff . Love their food
Tracey D.,"Rosharon, TX",83,19,17,5.0,10/28/2015,Chicken mini deep dish pizza gave me life ....they also have a reverse happy hour
Evelyn T.,"Clute, TX",36,1,,1.0,9/10/2016,Worst experience ever in a restaurant.  Waited 45 minutes for a table for two. Then waited over an hour for our food. Did not get any food!!  Got up and left.  Biggest complaint. ..... Four tables around us that were sat after ys received food first.
Ondrea T.,"Pearland, TX",20,130,5,1.0,8/15/2015,I have yet to find anything worth going to BJ's for. Everything tastes frozen. The chili burger didn't sit right with me and I'm not a beer drinker so i cant really appreciate the different brews. Probably a good place to go to watch sports because they have several large screens.
JeMarques H.,"Pearland, TX",0,1,,5.0,2/17/2017,"Great atmosphere, food and staff!!! Courtney, Sr. Mgr. was very professional handling a small mix up and exceeded my expectations.  Emilio, bartender, is the best in Houston! If you're at the bar request him!!!"
Chris B.,"Houston, TX",162,6,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"Congratulations on your massive fruit fly infestation, microwaved flat bread pizza, and inattentive bartending staff.  I do recommend health code rep come through here and simply sit at the bar for five minutes."
Arada H.,"Pearland, TX",9,77,3,2.0,11/18/2016,"Got to-go for my kid's school spirit night because the restaurant was full (as was parking lot) and wait time would've been 30+ minutes.  Ordered Italiano Vegetable Penne with meatballs added ($3) instead of chicken that was offered, plus potato skins and artichoke hearts. Those appetizers were good. Marinara sauce on the penne was odd. Meatballs were 3 humongous balls, but pretty good. I know this place is more known for drinks & burgers/ pizzas, but we weren't impressed with our $15 pasta and likely won't be back."
Nathalie D.,"San Antonio, TX",171,6,,5.0,6/19/2016,I went Friday after work location at Pearland town center. Me and my friend had a great time. Wasn't sure what to drink but bartender Wesley was Awesome very friendly and making sure guest were happy. He suggested the strawberry Mojito Wow I had never had  a good one anywhere like the one he made me. Food was good service was great. Be back for sure with friends.
