Belle K.,"Pearland, TX",202,83,794,5.0,3/4/2014,"Bj's how I love you!!! Although I don't come as often as I should, one can never go wrong with Bj's . Food is great: I love the ahi tuna poke, the caprese a salad, flat breads, and amazing deep dish pizza. Half off wine Tuesdays!! Staff is on it all the time. The ready rooms are clean There is ample parking!!"
Lasairiona M.,"Missouri City, TX",110,707,393,1.0,3/15/2015,"Dear Sugar Land BJ's, I'm sorry for cheating on you and going to this nightmare of a place.  I will never cheat again.  Promise. Service: slow, slow and slower still.  Inattentive, didn't even bother putting our appetizer order in, and my entree order was wrong.  It wasn't our server who brought or food, but I pointed out the error and he got brusque ""do you want broccoli?"" Why yes, since that's what I ordered (instead of green beans).   Food: took forever and was just mediocre.  Pizzookies were overcooked, dark brown and badly stuck to the metal pans.  NO BABY CHANGING FACILITIES.  Hubby took our little one in to the men's to change his butt, came back out.  No changing table.  So I took him in to the women's, no changing table.  Are you KIDDING me? Save yourself a crappy meal, and just drive to Sugar Land where it's exponentially better all round!!"
Anita C.,"Pearland, TX",26,34,8,1.0,7/9/2016,"The Pearland location needs improvement. It used to be much better. Last couple times I went, the service was extremely slow. The food came out barely warm. The flavor was bland. Very disappointing."
Valerie H.,"Dickinson, TX",22,9,6,4.0,10/18/2015,Wish I'd seen the coupon BEFORE we went.  Party of 5.  My husband and I shared a Hawaiian pizza (new) and it was amazing and I'm not a big pizza eater.  The 3 others had burgers and fries.  All liked them.  The Negative is the parking and the long walk to car at busy times.  Drop off any handicapped people at front door if you can.
Shawn P.,"Beaverton, OR",209,19,5,5.0,8/26/2015,"My girlfriend and I were visiting the area and stumbled upon BJs restaurant and brewhouse. The last time we ate at a BJs was in Chino, CA and let me tell you... As soon as we saw there was a BJs we went for dinner that night. We love this place. Probably one of our most favorite restaurants! The menu can reach everybody's palates, it's huge. Only downside to that is it takes more time to order because there is so much to choose from. We started off with a couple drinks, they weren't very strong and I admit... I like my drinks a little stronger. Only complaint I have about our dinner. For apps we had spinach stuffed mushrooms and the avocado egg roll. Awesomeness! The avacado egg roll had cream cheese in it and were a little spicy which I loved and the spinach stuffed mushrooms were a good starter size for two people. This was just the beginning. Ordered another round of drinks this time tall ones! My gf had the sirloin with mashed potatoes and asparagus while I had the portobello Swiss burger. One thing is for sure they always nail how to cook a sirloin at this place. Even at the other location in Chino, CA. My burger was amazing! It came with thin cut French fries and was more than enough food . Let's just say we made two meals after eating our left overs the next day.  Service was great, atmosphere is amazing; I love how clean and new this place is, the style and space of the restaurant is perfect and a great place to eat. I will definitely go back to this location if I ever visit again and you can count on seeing my at anther BJs if they are near where I am visiting! 5 stars"
Sacchin T.,"Houston, TX",55,20,7,4.0,5/2/2015,"The customer service here is spectacular! Had to host a party of 28 for a birthday dinner and they accommodated this on a Friday night. Also the new items on the appetizers menu are great. For example, the Carnitas fries are excellent. And you can never go wrong with one of their pizzas."
Michelle V.,"Houston, TX",133,30,36,3.0,5/27/2015,"We got seated right away, but the service wasn't exactly the best. The waiter was nice and took our orders but he didn't really check up to see how we were doing during dinner. The rib eye was okay. it wasn't bad, but I have tasted better."
Siobhan N.,"Houston, TX",498,185,201,4.0,12/22/2014,"They have Happy Hour prices during all NFL games so this is a spot I hit up often. The bar staff are really great, friendly and attentive. The food is meh in my opinion, pretty average and sometimes crap; but I'm there for the beer and it makes up for the lack in culinary quality.  Side Story:  I was once offered (did not ask) a to-go water cup for my walk home! It was warm outside and the bartender overheard we were walking, very thoughtful. If you've ever worked in the service industry, you know it's rare to offer to go out of your way to do something that isn't standard or asked of you when it's busy.  Anyhoo, the only time I sat in the restaurant area, the service was bad and our waitress was really rude. There was a problem with our food, her reaction was that of ""bummer"" and walked away.  So, just sit in the bar area, you can't go wrong!"
Debbie C.,"Missouri City, TX",42,67,96,3.0,4/6/2015,"The food was okay, nothing really special. The tomato bisque soup was good, although the oily look and soggy croutons were kind of off putting. I'd have to say it was probably my favorite part of the meal. I also has the BBQ chicken chopped salad. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. I don't think I'll order it again.  I had a mini salted caramel pazookie for dessert. The cookie was warm and gooey just like I like them. The taste was nothing exciting. If I return, I'll try another flavor.  The service was not bad. Our order was taken quickly and we did not have to wait long for our food. We had to ask for drink refills twice and our waiter was not the friendliest person, but he did get the job done.  All in all, my experience here was bleh. I'm not excited about going back, but if someone else wants to go I won't fight it. Maybe I'll find something good next time."
Caty B.,"Houston, TX",1,5,,1.0,12/6/2015,"Normally, the good and atmosphere is delicious. Tonight while dining, President Obama started a presidential address. About 5 minutes into his speech, they turned off the volume. This is quite upsetting, bordering on offensive. It's majorly disrespectful to assume that people want to hear music or watch football instead of listen to this country's leader address things like the San Bernardino attacks and other issues about terrorism.  Shame on you, BJ's. Shame on you."
Courtney M.,"Houston, TX",0,19,1,3.0,4/19/2016,"Service is hit or miss. The jalapeño burger is pretty good but the spinach dip wasn't mixed right (clumps of spinach in some bites and none in others) and burnt. I visit maybe once or twice a month and its either great service, happy upbeat waitstaff or completely inattentive staff."
G F.,"Pearland, TX",20,146,1,3.0,1/26/2016,"They have a good selection of draft beers here. Honestly, the food is mediocre and the service is rather slow. This is a place to have a beer after work."
Rob B.,"Spring, TX",18,69,167,5.0,11/16/2014,"Had we been there alone, this would have been at least 4 stars. The fact that we were a group of 30 and everyone was happy bumped it to 5 stars.  Fun place to watch a game, especially if you wanted to keep up with more than one simultaneous game, as they have a HUGE screen behind the bar split into four sections. Everything at our table was delicious, service was excellent, and the prices seemed reasonable for the amount and quality: Caesar salad - one of best I've had. Snack size pasta and cheese was rich and delicious (and amount more than expected). Parmesan chicken was fantastic (and a generous amount of food). Wedge salad was very good. Tomato soup and broccoli cheddar soup both very tasty. Carnitas/cheese/salsa-covered fries were great. Both varieties of beer were quite satisfying. The cream soda was excellent. The root beer was the only disappointment."
Cynthia S.,"Houston, TX",11,15,2,5.0,2/9/2016,"Me and my three friends decided to have a girls night dinner here. Our waiter was awesome! We all had different dishes and after taking a taste from each one, I was highly impressed with the quality of everything. We shared a skillet cookie which was also very good. I'd definitely recommend it for a date night."
Mallory W.,"Houston, TX",165,280,93,5.0,12/29/2014,"I have to give this place 5 stars. I think it has great food, great service, great bartenders, and neat beer tasting events. I've been coming here for years and I'm always pleased. They switch around the menu occasionally and add new items. Although it is a chain, it feels a little more upscale than most places in Pearland. I am a member of the rewards club and I think it's a good deal. It's easy to rack up points."
P J.,"Pearland, TX",0,8,2,1.0,4/26/2016,Would normally give a better rating but their food quality keeps declining. Just went again today and they messed up the same order twice. Barely no response or acknowledgement- seems that the staff are used to these issues in the kitchen.  Beers there are cool - just don't expect good quality food from the general menu.  Positive note - their flatbread pizzas are good.
Mark C.,"Metairie, LA",1,17,1,1.0,10/25/2016,Mondays are 1/2 off pizza but yet they skimp on the toppings and serve a bunch of doe.  They barely put any sauce let alone toppings. scam
Amanda S.,"Pearland, TX",3,5,,5.0,3/5/2016,Love Love Love this place!!!!!! Went with coworkers for a company dinner and it was great! Would def go back!!
Aaron B.,"Houston, TX",116,72,126,5.0,10/18/2015,I gave them five stars because I have to say they have the best bar in Pearland. The food is pretty tasty but if you're a beer connoisseur you can't go wrong. Not only do they have their own beers on the menu there is also a good selection of call brands as well .
Tanya D.,"Houston, TX",2,26,3,4.0,9/22/2015,"The past few months we've eaten here quite a bit. I was unfamiliar with Bj's until I saw an add for a bogo coupon on another site. I like a deal so I figured, what the heck, I will give them a try. We ended up there for dinner. The staff was very welcoming and friendly and our server was polite and quick. We both ended up getting the baby back rib plates, a 21 dollar meal or so....because, hello, bogo coupon! I was surprised at how good the ribs were. Usually ribs from a non-bbq restaurant are pretty meh. But these were very tasty and tender. Pleasantly surprising. We have been back many times since then and no meal has disappointed yet. The service is always great. Their hot wings are outstanding...crispy and zesty, just how I like them.  The most recent trip we took there, our server, Forest, was great. My guy drinks a lot when and Forest kept those ice teas a'comin'. We ordered I think what was the 5 meat pizza and dang....that was a good pizza! We would have devoured the whole thing if we hadn't been getting a dessert with the Party for 2 deal. We shared a s'mores pazookie.....a baked chocolate cookie topped with peanut butter sauce, roasted marshmallows, and vanilla ice cream. Literally....heaveN in my mouth! This place is definitely a favorite on our dinner out list and is our go to when we are craving good pizza."
