Brandon R.,"Hollywood, FL",31,44,208,5.0,11/8/2017,"Honestly, I never thought I would be eating here as much. So many daily/weekly specials, deals, and guest favorites that are bombarding this place - who would be disappointed? Not this guy.  Their menu is so vast. They have selections ranging from soups, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, tacos, handcrafted burgers, seafood, chicken, beef, pork, and so on. There's always something new to try.  Their Happy Hour menu brings light to this place (Monday - Friday from 3pm to 7pm; Sunday - Thursday: 10pm to either 12am or 1am). Some notable deals happen during pro football games, such as $3 Domestic Bottles and Chips & Dips (available in the bar only), $4 BJ's handcrafted beers, and $5 Dark Horse Wines and Call Drinks.  PIZOOKIES PIZOOKIES PIZOOKIES! Have you ever tried their world-famous pizookie? It's pretty much a pizza cookie that's out of this world. Are you in the mood for something very chocolatey? Then you should try the Triple Chocolate Pizookie (made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate). Or maybe you want to try something with marshmallowy goodness merged with peanut butter. Well, they have a Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie (topped with vanilla bean ice cream and marshmallows baked to a golden finish). It's like having s'mores in doors. These babies will change your life forever."
Megan C.,"Washington, DC",177,57,14,2.0,12/7/2017,"This is your typical suburban Florida restaurant. The menu is chock'd with Appletini's and B- pizza, everything lacks a little salt and pepper, with large portions and ok prices. We did call ahead seating which works in our favor but this place really picked up around 7:30.  The menu weighs about 9 pounds. I'd consider using two as a booster seat for a child. Almost too many options and a random category of food.  Service was friendly but nothing special. Food came out fast. Overall a very average experience."
Nyimah W.,"Benbrook, TX",68,3,,2.0,11/29/2017,Service here gets progressively worse.  First visit was good.  Second visit was lack luster.   Today has just been garbage.  No hostess.  Took 15 mins to get a drink (while sitting AT THE BAR with TWO non busy bartenders (4 people at the bar all with food and drinks).    30 mins for someone to take a food order.   It really sucks because this place is super close to my place and I love the tavern cut pizza.   But I refuse to continue to give my money to a place that can give two $hits about my experience here.   Guess it's time to find a replacement.
Stephanie M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",134,51,86,5.0,12/15/2017,"Went in for dinner last night with a few girlfriends and sat at the bar, we had the best service we've ever had at Bj's. I've been other times and the service wasn't great however last night was pretty impressive. I wish I remembered my Bartenders name because he was great; very attentive and friendly. He made the best margaritas! He attempted to make me a chocolate martini I asked for it wasn't the BEST but it was very strong (can't complain). Overall he tried to make us something that wasn't on the menu which someone else probably wouldn't have attempted."
Christian M.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,1,1.0,12/16/2017,So I placed an order over the phone for pickup I ordered a Cobb salad but instead of turkey I got grilled chicken I picked it up it was sliced on top of the salad it looked fine but when I got home and cut the chicken into pieces it was completely raw mushy pink chicken breast it looked like they took it out of the freezer threw it on the grill for 5 seconds on each side and threw it in my salad it was disgusting I called and the Manager he said come in the next day and he'll take care of my bill when I got there I never even saw the manager he spoke to us through the waiter saying take our order and he'll take care of the bill so at the end of the meal he just comped my salad and took $10 off the bill which would be fine but why did he say twice that he would take care of the bill? Don't say something you don't really mean.
Melissa P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/8/2018,"this evening was not great the server in the bar disappeared for long periods of time..it was not busy,we had to track him down  to fix our order which was undercooked and to get more drinks. I was not impressed."
Kelly T.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",228,122,163,4.0,3/22/2017,"3.5 Stars I first tried BJ's when I was in Columbus, OH. And I fell in love with it and dreamed about this place because there wasn't a location within a 4 hour drive from where I lived. Needless to say, I was super excited when I found out there was one near me now that I moved to FL. However, I guess the memories were sweeter than when I tried this place again. I tried a quinoa dish with shrimp, nothing too good about it. My boyfriend wasn't crazy about his penne dish although he was super hungry coming in. I tried the burger another time when I came in. It was very average and also very messy.  The BEST part about BJs and why I keep coming back though is for the pizookies. It is my all time favorite dessert and I've had a LOT of desserts. I give 5 stars for the pizookie."
Reixa C.,"Coconut Creek, FL",569,537,3266,5.0,12/20/2016,"12/19/2016 - Monday nights are a winner here! 1/2 OFF LARGE PIZZA! Very nice restaurant but we decided to sit at the bar. Our bartender Christophe was AMAZING!!!! He was the best. If you come here, sit at the bar, and ask for him. He is so nice, ,polite, and engaging. He payed attention to all his customers, answered questions about beers, got us our food, cleaned up the plates, got us to go boxes...he did not miss a beat. All by saying ""this is what I'm here for"", ""I'm here for you"", ""It is my job to make sure you are all happy.""  Ok, so now about that PIZZA. We ordered a large Gourmet Five Meat deep dish pizza, Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, smoked bacon, Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese. I had one and a half pieces and I was stuffed. They really pack on the meats and the dough is nice and buttery but not greasy. It was so fluffy, just delicious! To drink, I had one of their own brew, Hopstorm IPA (6% ABV).  There are tv's everywhere but the best one is behind the bar. It is a humongous TV that has 4 different screens to watch football, soccer, and the fights all at once.  This is my first time here and a winner in all counts for me!"
Jesus V.,"Miami-Dade, FL",23,17,72,1.0,10/13/2017,"I hate to write negative reviews - I'm a firm believer that the negativity doesn't really ""change"" anything in most cases. I find it better to speak with management but sadly, in this case, the manager was too disinterested to speak to us, despite having had our order placed incorrectly, never having received 1/2 of what we requested, and ultimately leading to one person in my party not eating at all - this is unacceptable. Add to that, the server's lack of empathy for the situation with her response of ""oh, that's too bad for you"" when we spoke with her again to address the still missing entree. I did receive my food (mostly) and while it was good, the combination of missing food + how the whole thing was handled by the server and manager spoke volumes about the restaurant - one that we will no longer be patronizing, I might add. Oh, and while I appreciate that they are really full on a busy Friday night, the fact that the manager literally stood 2 feet from our table and couldn't be bothered to turn and face us, let alone address the glaring lack of service. Not even to apologize or anything. But that's cool, because you've got a truck load more people waiting outside for tables than to address the actual paying customers sitting in your establishment...for now at least. Until the day comes that you don't anyways and they close this place and open up a Starbucks or froyo shop in its place. Yay, commercialism!"
Erica D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",28,44,11,5.0,6/9/2017,Atmosphere was lovely. Architecture was eye catching and neat.  Great full menu had something for all. Usually I don't find much in the way of appetizers but I couldn't get enough here! Everything seemed to be cooked well even the side dishes! Place clean but avoid weekend rush.
Michelle G.,"Miami, FL",107,50,98,3.0,10/15/2017,"We only came for the $3 pizookie deal that was advertised. Came around 8pm on a Sunday night, it was moderately busy with about half of all the tables with patrons..   we sat down and our server came immediately to greet us and said he would be back in a few. After about 12 to 15 minutes he returned and took our order. He apologized for the wait and rushed our dessert. Our salted caramel pizookie came out quickly, we were sad to see it was not garnished with the caramel sauce and chocolate chips mentioned in the menu. Overall, the service was good but slow.... And the pizookie while good, needed the garnish."
Ricky R.,"Cooper City, FL",39,70,609,2.0,4/23/2017,"I went hear for a Sunday late lunch around 3:30pm with my two sons, it was rainy and restaurant was at about 50% capacity.   We were sat by the hostess promptly and then we waited a very long time to be addressed by our waitress, I actually walked back to the hostess and asked for our waitress.  When I got back she arrived and she really didn't seem to care, which irks me seeing I was once in the service industry.  She said something like ""yeah I know I'm late"" in a laughing voice but I didn't care for it. We ordered tater skins for an app an they were actually good and not super oily.  It's was served with ranch and sour cream dips. My kids had a cheese burger and chicken fingers, 2 out of 5. My son had a hair in his chicken fingers but I didn't say anything as he was almost done with his meal anyway. I had the black and blue burger and it was ok, the bun had like a butter spray on it which made my hands greasy which is annoying.  I was told it would come with lettuce and onion and it did not. The burger was kinda thin for the money as well, I ordered it medium and it came out med well.   I ate my sons lettuce from his kids burger.   The waitress had to be flagged down to get our bill and again we were waiting to be acknowledged by our waitress when we were done eating, it's was just annoying.  On the way out we hit the restrooms to wash up and the men's room was super messy with water splashes on counter tops hand towels on the floor and counters.  Additionally having two boys I always tell them to watch out around urinals and don't step in any ""puddles"" and there was a major ""puddle mess"" in front of the urinals.  I told my kids to use the toilets instead as to not step in it.  I told the hostess on the way out to so I can be addressed.  It was a sign that the restrooms haven't been spot checked in a long time due to how bad it was, you can tell the difference. Overall it's a 3 star place but lack of service and filthy restrooms brings it down to 2 stars.    It's a nice place that needs some attention or eventually they will loose customers little by little and struggle. I won't be back for a while."
Maryann S.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",275,125,418,4.0,5/2/2017,"We came here for a late lunch after a full day of shopping around the area. The plaza get a little packed from nearby stores but regardless the side u park on, there is easy access in both sides to the entrance. Sometimes depending on the hour of day your having a bite to eat, it does get a little packed. So if your in a rush or hate to wait, you can sit by the bar area and there is a lot of seating and high chair/tables. We didn't want to wait for a table to we sat in the bar area. Service is semi-quick, it would be the same if you were to sit in the dining area. For drinks, I ordered the strawberry lemonade, had strawberry chunks and sourness was settled, not over powering  at all.  What's nice about the appetizer is that you can get a shareable dish or mini bites. We stuck with the shareable dish and ordered the chips & artichoke/spinach dip. Chips were a bit greasy but warm and the dip had pieces of spinach with little chunks of artichoke that broke apart as you scope it with your chip. Not bad at all! For my main entree, I was being good and ordered the quinoa/brown rice with shrimp. The mixture of the rice was perfect and tasted more of the quinoa, it balanced with the tomato and mushroom with steamed shrimp, that was lightly seasoned. Shrimp could of use a bit of lemon but that's ok. Dish was fulfilling with only have the calories, plus for me! Dessert! Omg! I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pazookie with 2 scoops of ice cream on top ! Fresh from the oven, it was just WOW Amazing! That dish never disappointments me at all!  Our server was friendly and attentive, we did wait awhile for our appetizer but other than that service was good!"
Tina Y.,"Miami, FL",161,35,61,5.0,10/12/2017,"I've never been to ""bad"" bjs restaurant. This location is my first and I throughly enjoyed it. I had prime rib dinner special and chicken Parmesan. Prime rib was juicy and tender. Chicken cooked just right. Great experience cannot wait to go back"
Mauricio V.,"Miami, FL",68,98,48,2.0,6/25/2017,"I am very familiar eith the BJs chain and am a fan of the establishment. However, I am not a fan of this particular branch. If you're tight on time for a lunch break on a work day, DO NOT come here.  I came here with coworkers on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. We were promptly seated, however, the waitress took TOO LONG to in the rest of the service aspects; the food and drinks took forever to arrive, and the waitress even took a while to bring us our checks and then our receipts to sign once we have paid. As for the food, my pulled pork sandwich was too sweet, and my coworker complained that his side of brussel sprouts were as hard and unpalatable.  Bottom line: look elsewhere for a good and quick meal."
Foodie ..,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",153,75,381,1.0,6/4/2017,I went for a late dinner last night and was very disappointed The food took forever and was cold when it arrived. The hamburger buns were burned so everything had to go back  to be redone. The staff was compassionate but the kitchen was not helping their efforts to resolve the issues. I am hoping that management can find where the problems are so that their ratings don't continue to fall .
Fonzi G.,"Hollywood, FL",1,2,6,4.0,10/23/2017,"Service was different both visit but we was happy with most part , our server could of been more present but southern fried chicken was great be sure to ask for extra sauce with your dinner"
Erz L.,"Newnan, GA",0,1,1,5.0,10/20/2017,Good place Bison burger was awesome  Blond beer-good Salad with fresh mozzarella and tomato's was very tasty I was great with their service
Thu N.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",77,95,125,5.0,4/18/2017,"Had a great Dinner here with My friend. The service was quick and our waitress was really nice. I got the salmon Peruvian quinoa bowl and it was really good and filling too, which I wasn't expecting. We also got the monkey bread pizookie which taste like a cinnamon bun with ice cream on top. It was delicious!"
Al H.,"Davie, FL",0,6,,4.0,10/8/2017,"Brought some family from out of town to BJ's for lunch and none of us were disappointed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their lunch entrée but I will comment only on mine. I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe burger. Housemade guacamole, Applewood smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes and jalapeños cooked to medium rare perfection. In short: The burger was great as were their piping hot crispy fries and the service was on-point."
Denise C.,"Miami, FL",103,115,80,3.0,7/30/2017,"This restaurant is alright. Nothing too impressive. I order their salad every time I dine here and I enjoy trying to different beers they offer. The drinks aren't that great at all. We ordered 3 and they all came out mediocre. If you want something simple and not too crazy, this place is good for a quick bite."
Manny M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,86,238,3.0,3/20/2017,"Service is slow, food is average at a higher price. Had the Italian Market thin crust--have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store.  Wife had the Atlantic Salmon, she thought it was average as well. And my oldest had soup and salad. The Caesar salad was good to go, the broccoli and cheddar soup--was most all cheddar light broccoli. My kid said it was ok.  We had two different desserts, the chocolate chip pizookie--the kids loved it; however, the baked Beignet was a disappointment. It was completely covered in cinnamon and sugar. It tasted like a cinnamon sugar donut--the whip cream and ice cream were almost non-existen.  Recommend you eat elsewhere if you want to play average price for average food."
Nicole H.,"Hialeah, FL",80,25,123,4.0,7/26/2017,"*Make sure to sign up for their rewards club!* I absolutely love their avocado egg rolls! This appetizer comes with 6 rolls, which is always a good starter. I've tried the avocado chicken sandwich and the bj burger. Those dishes are ok but my favorite dish here is the deep dish pizza. I highly recommend as desert to order the Pizzoci Trio. You can choose three hot and fresh cookies topped with vanilla ice cream. I always choose the macadamia nut cookie. It's delicious!"
Cassandra A.,"Hialeah, FL",94,45,186,5.0,2/26/2017,"I have to say BJs is one of my all time favorites. Nothing that I have tried has ever left me disappointed. I have been here way too many times and try to get different plates all the time. I've had wings, spicy peanut chicken noodles, balsamic glazed chicken, burgers, Parmesan crusted chicken, soups, pizza, and most importantly their pizookies are the absolute best. It is a warm cookie topped with ice cream. They come in a variety of flavors and I will literally drive 25 minutes just to pick one up.  The ambience is casual as it is also a bar with TVs and they make their own beer. I like their blonde Brew. You can call ahead and save a spot which I recommend on the weekends. Service can be slow at times which is the only downfall."
Jenn B.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",89,8,8,5.0,11/20/2017,Just want to give a huge thumbs up  and 5 stars for our waiter tonight Daniel C.  He was a great server.  The food was great and we had a very relaxed enjoyable dinner. We will definitely be back.
Mike M.,"Bradenton, FL",23,92,2,3.0,10/23/2017,"Food was good.Our server was excellent. Not enough TV's. Drinks are very expensive even beer $5.99 for domestic beer a Yuengling? I uderstand it was a Saturday, But you should always have a special price beer or drink. My bill was over $80 for (2) adults. I could have spent half of that at Chilis, Apple bees or Ruby Tuesday. I only tried this place because it was something different. It was not worth the extra expense......"
Najla A.,"Hollywood, FL",76,2,,3.0,11/12/2017,"Stopped in here for early dinner.  Tried the Mac & Cheese Couscous, description says creamy but appears like it was microwaved to long & dried out.  Had the shrimp & arugula tacos & they were extremely cheap with the shrimp, only 2 in each.  There should have been one at least for each bite.   Not happy with today's visit.  Most likely will not return.   Only good thing was the server, she was very pleasant."
Sadie G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,,5.0,11/7/2017,Food is good my favorite entrees are the Mediterranean chicken tacos or Parmesan crusted chicken but their pizookies are AAAMAZING! If you come out make sure you ask for Desi he's awesome and super cute.
Richard P.,"Hollywood, FL",0,10,,2.0,11/7/2017,Food is good but the service is absolutely horrible. I have tried several times but just can't get over the service. They always seem to be under staffed even when not busy.
Larry S.,"Nashville, TN",0,43,1,4.0,12/14/2017,"Excellent Tito's martini, very cold with 3 olives. Perfect! Quinoa bowl with shrimp, loads of shrimp, thank you! Decided to eat healthy. Great flavors and all done well (quinoa needed another minute in the water). Overall, excellent service and meal."
Charelle B.,"Miami, FL",9,30,59,1.0,4/29/2017,The worse experience EVER as a first time guest. My party and I waited 2 hours to be seated after arriving ON TIME! 7: 30 to 9:35. However after another 45mins our waitress brought the food to the table as an appetizer we had the barbeque boneless chicken and for my entree the lemon herbed chicken with Brussels sprouts and tomato perfectly seasoned over a bed of brown rice. OMG it was amazing. The chicken was succulent and juicy and the veggies were more flavorful than I could've ever imagined. The strawberry lemonade wasn't any good but my long island definitely did the trick. The food was delightful everything else was lacklustre.
Paige B.,"Hollywood, FL",2,28,21,5.0,11/5/2017,"From delicious pizookies made with freshly baked cookies topped with ice cream, to incredible Asian-themed soba noodles and parmesan crusted chicken, BJ's menu is great. Service is typically top notch, and they have lots of great options on their menu. The beer selection is pretty great, too. If you're in this area and are interested in a quality sit down restaurant, BJ's is a great option."
Cisco A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",20,124,14,5.0,7/2/2017,Food is pretty good. They have a wide selection of different entrees. Will not disappoint.
Foncho G.,"Denver, CO",0,17,,5.0,8/3/2017,Great place to have lunch or dinner.  We came here after having such a negative experience at a furniture store near by and we felt so relaxed and at home. My partner and I always try to find a BJ's  whenever we are travelling together.  Atmosphere is lovely and so is their architecture. We recommend BJ's to all our friends and acquaintances. WE LOVE BJ's !
Rendy I.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,Waiting was over an hour. Food is not even close to good. Pasta is like pasta sauce from walmart and not fresh. Bug in my friend's salad. She tried to make a complain but they denied it. Not gonna come back. Also their beer taste 1 out of 10.
Marcia B.,"Baltimore, MD",0,64,31,3.0,10/5/2017,"Good location. Lots of food choices. We went for dinner at about 8:30 on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was not super crowded but the service was lacking. Our food arrived in decent time, but 4 of the 6 orders were not correct In some way. IThey served pizza but didn't have crushed pepper or oregano. The light above the table was caked with dust and cobwebs. The floors were noticeably not clean. This is not my first trip here and the atmosphere is pretty nice but it was disappointing on this visit. Hopefully this was just an off night. This restaurant is still worth a try. They have a great variety of food choices."
Steve W.,"Southwest Ranches, FL",76,63,33,3.0,5/14/2017,"Have not been here in awhile. They did update their menu but I'd say it's a better bar and appetizer place than a restaurant. Beers are reasonably priced, food seems pricy for what you get."
Christian D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,165,213,2.0,5/10/2017,"My GF and I were at the mall nearby and were starving by the time we left. We decided to stop by BJs for dinner. It was about 5:15 on a Saturday.  Surprisingly enough, they were quite empty. We were greeted and seated right away. Our server was pleasant, I am sorry her name escapes me right now. She brought us our beverages and we ordered our food: I got a BBQ burger on a gluten free bun (stupid dietary restriction!) and my GF got the pork chop. We each ordered a side salad. My GF and I chatted for a few minutes and the salads were brought out. The lettuce was crisp, cold and the veggies were fresh and temp appropriate. The main meal came out maybe 10 min after we finished the salads. My burger was very tasty looking, as was my GF's meal, and both were temperature appropriate. We each took a big bite of our meals..... and were immediately disappointed in the lack of flavor. For something that is supposed to have big, bold taste, my BBQ burger was wimpy and meek. The bun was tolerable but it quickly got soggy and fell apart, as most gluten free buns are prone to do. The fries were crisp and warm, but over salted. I drained my iced tea to rehydrate my over salted tastebuds, but little did I know that would be the only one I got, as the server never came back by after the initial stop by when the meal was delivered. My GF 's pork chop was heavy on the salt as well. It was juicy but really just lacked any over all flavor besides sodium chloride. The baked potato she ordered as a side looked like someone set it on fire, as it was VERY black on the top. She cut away that part and ate 1/2 of the rest. It was overall a very disappointing meal for what we paid. With so many restaurants in the area, BJs need to tighten up. I don't really plan to stop by here again unless there is just no other choice."
Khushboo P.,"Buford, GA",75,26,28,5.0,5/16/2017,Sooo much variety! Very good prices! Very clean! Pls end your meal with a pizookie! I have nothing bad to say about BJs
Maria B.,"Miami Beach, FL",8,9,,1.0,8/22/2017,"My husband suggested we go there for lunch. I had never been but he said the food was always good. When we went we ordered an appetizer and the hostess had told me about the loyalty rewards program so I downloaded the app immediately. We started off ordering an appetizer which was great. But when the entrees came, my husbands pasta was awful, it tasted like it was a day old. He didn't  eat it and when the waiter came we told him. We paid 50 bucks that day for our meal and we figure the restaurant can keep the ten dollars or whatever for the meal. We aren't ever going back and deleted the app."
