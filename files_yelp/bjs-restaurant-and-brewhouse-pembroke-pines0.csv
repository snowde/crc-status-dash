Sarah S.,"Hollywood, FL",50,298,103,3.0,8/11/2014,"Our service was excellent and our food was average. I had to send my steak back because I ordered it well done and it came out medium rare. This made my husband feel awkward as he sat there eating while my food went back to be cooked. The white cheddar potatoes tasted like plain potatoes; there was nothing white cheddar about them. The steak was ok, but for the price I wouldn't go back. Overall it was clean inside and our waitress was great, but the food is nothing special."
Brad S.,"Skokie, IL",81,8,,3.0,4/5/2015,"Came here for their ""Chicago style pizza"". Being a person from Chicago it definitely doesn't measure up but a decent pie. Alvacado egg roles are a must have and beer selection is pretty good. Overall a solid place to eat."
Jay U.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",45,33,4,2.0,6/2/2014,"I really want to give them a good review, but.... First of all, let me say that when I booked a reservation for a large party in the middle of prime dining time, they were very accommodating....Thanks for that. We were there with a large party to celebrate.  The service was very slow.  After taking drink orders, it took 15-20 minutes to get them (soft drinks, BJ's beers, and some wine).  The server brought out the wrong wine and then said they don't offer the white wine that was requested, even though there were 6 on the menu.  I ordered a sample of one of their house beers.  When it was delivered, it was in a dirty glass and then it took 20 minutes more to get it replaced. The appetizers were pretty good overall, but they are small portions, so be prepared to double up. When they brought dinner, they brought out half at a time, with almost 10 minutes between the two services, the second half said that their food was lukewarm.  The portions are large-like most places.  You can easily share most dinner items.  Everyone did say that the food was pretty good, though the hand-tossed pizza was pricey. For the money spent, average at very best; but the dinner service needs improvement. The atmosphere is great, the beers and homemade sodas are fantastic, and the menu is good.  Just some minor improvements in service and attention can turn this into a great place."
Stephanie G.,"Hialeah, FL",0,3,3,3.0,7/13/2014,"The food is great but the service is HORRIBLE!!! Every time I go the host seems to be confused asking more than once how many people & the waiters are not very welcoming. Besides the service being only worthy of a star they aren't very clean, on my first visit I had to ask for new silverware more than once because they kept giving me dirty ones.  Only reason I give this please 3 stars is because the cooks seem to be the only people to know how to do their jobs."
Dawn V.,"Davie, FL",1,20,,5.0,6/12/2016,The hostess was very attentive. The food was delicious. The waiter took care of us very well. We will definitely return soon.
Kevin O.,"Key West, FL",1,55,7,5.0,10/31/2015,Great burger and a great jambalaya!  Service was great and the beer was good. Overall great birthday lunch. Btw the pizookie was excellent.
Lauren B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",170,27,,4.0,3/3/2014,"BJ's is one of my favorite group places going back to my California years. The menu and beer selection are definitely extensive enough that anyone should be able to find something. Everything I've tried here has been good but the pizza is the big draw. The deep dish pan style pizza has even been enjoyed by a lactose intolerant friend of mine who orders it without cheese. Even my picky eater friend who can list more foods that she hates than enjoys likes BJ's.  My favorite thing is the individual pizza, especially since you can order any of the specialty pizzas in this size. The flat bread appetizer and salads are also good and a nice option when trying to eat a little lighter."
Mike M.,"Coral Springs, FL",33,34,12,4.0,2/19/2015,"As far ""go to places"" Bj's is certainly one of them.  I am a beer lover (beer snob if you wil) and they one of the best selections around including their own brews.  The weekly lunchtime special of $3 a draft for their bres is awesome.  They have a great selection plus the seasonal or brew of the month.  They have a great selection of craft brews as well.  Great selection of food - menu changes from time to time so the selections rotate.  Never had a bad meal."
Ray R.,"Orlando, FL",4,22,,1.0,4/17/2016,"HORRIFIC service and the food was barely edible. If you like cold, microwaved dry food, then this is the place for you. So disappointing for one of my favorite restaurant chains. Ann Marie might be the worst waitress I've ever seen. The clam chowder bowl was good."
Marc S.,"Hollywood, FL",26,23,,3.0,9/10/2014,"We have been there once. The place is OK.  The food is OK. The service is fast and slow.  No consistency.  I will say that when my meal was was not exactly right,  they fixed it very quickly. They do have a decent Burger but the Calamari  tasted like it was the freezer too long and was a very small portion. considering the price."
Roman M.,"Hollywood, FL",127,26,2,5.0,1/1/2016,Party of 15 celebrating nieces birthday.  Was seated right away.   Server Nathaniel was excellent. Cared to our needs. Served us right away with drinks and appetizers.   The kitchen was super fast !  All the meals came out within 10 minutes and no issues with the food.  It was all delicious as always.  Nathaniel brought out a small birthday cookie and candle before we asked about it. Very smart server seeng the birthday balloons...lol. I will continue to eat there.
Ernesto M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",167,117,62,4.0,3/22/2014,"So we are finally fans of BJ! After not coming back for about 2 years for an awful first experience, I am happy to say that this time it was well worth the second try. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and she stated they were great and tasty.  I ordered the deep dish gourmet meat. I ordered the small size which I couldn't finish. The pizza was really good and if I have to be critical I was hoping for more tomato sauce being a deep dish. However, that's just my preference. As a side note the yelpers saying go to Pizza Hut!!! What are they thinking? I recently ordered Pizza Hut and I will never agin order from there. It doesn't compare..  They have the Black and Tan and it's the cheapest I've ever seen in any bar."
Harry S.,"Coral Springs, FL",154,227,65,3.0,6/11/2014,"Was here last week if they fix a few quirks I would give them a higher rating. we got there during happy hour and was told if you want the happy hour prices for appetizer you need to sit in the bar area of find a place outside on the patio because its self seating. We chose to sit outside as we walked to the area we were stopped by a group of 3 servers and was told a hostess has to seat us, We went back to the hostess stand and was told its self seating I then told the hostess she needs to walk over to the group of servers who stopped us from entering the patio area and discuss if its open seating or we need to be seated. After a 3 minute debate between them they decided it to have us sit down in the patio area that was complexly empty accept for one table being used. Just to let you know they food was quite good but them serving the appetizer, salad, and the entree  all in a 3 minute period is down right stupid.  I hope they get their act together because I would like to give them another try at it because I"
Jo W.,"Miami, FL",176,335,1441,3.0,1/23/2013,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is the classic beer and pizza joint hidden in a casual dining restaurant chain. All in all, it is a pretty good place for an outing with friends or family. On tap, they have a selection of handcrafted micro brews. I am not the beer lover, so I passed, but my boyfriend tried their Tatonka Stout. It wasn't bad but  ti didn't really stand out either. He wasn't impressed but it could have just been a matter of preference. If you only came here for a few drinks with friends and aren't looking to eat a big meal, BJ's has a bunch of snacks and small bites! We decided to try the Thai Style Chicken Wontons. The were right out of the fryer and steaming hot. They were very light and crispy. The filling was well seasoned and delicioso! I loved it. They are basically known for their deep dish pizzas so if its your first time here, I recommend you try one. We had the Spicy Meatball which consisted of housemade meatballs, spicy tomato sauce, Italian sausage, jalapenos, Parmesan cheese and red onions.  It was scrumptious! Fresh, cheesy, crunchy crust and yummy! The only thing is I wouldn't label it a deep dish but rather a pan pizza. Even if you don't drink beer or for some odd reason don't enjoy pizza, you might want to still consider BJ's for their famous Pizookie. Imagine this, a freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Mmmm!!! I had to go with the Chocolate Chunk for the melty chocolate goodness, but they have other options and a trio sampler if you can't decide. It seems that they pride themselves on providing a quality experience. Our waiter was really nice and funny. He cracked a few jokes with us and made us laugh. However, although the entertainment factor was high, in actual performance he lacked. There were a few times we were left waiting and we had to ask for water refills. It go to a point where we had to ask another waiter. So, I see where they are going with the experience they seek to provide, but it needs improvement. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience and recommend you come. However, the restaurant does get packed at times and they don't take reservations, so I suggest that you call ahead for the wait time and put your name on the waiting list if necessary."
Doris P.,"Miami, FL",0,16,1,3.0,2/4/2015,"Attended a birthday celebration on a Saturday night with 25 guests.  When we arrived at the restaurant there was no reservation. We had spoken to several people at BJ's regarding this event. The manager took over and figured out a place to put the party. He was great. My only problem with the staff was the food came out a little at a time so we were not eating together. Also, the staff would come out and shout, ""who ordered the fish"" etc. for every plate served. Totally unacceptable. I asked several times for some bread for our table and the server ignored me.  Food was good but not memorable.  Fun time with friends and family, so that is all that counts."
Lidya D.,"Davie, FL",0,2,,1.0,2/26/2016,"First, apparently the food comes out all at once now!? I ordered Appetizer and main at the same time and it all came at once. So stupid! Then, the asparagus in my pasta was inedible!! Not to mention that the marinara sauce tasted like it came out of a cheap can! Ugh!!! Really gross. The waiter asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said yes. The manager heard my complaint, saw the issue (I pointed out the asparagus stumps) and he said he'll take it to the kitchen. I was charged for it anyways! Ridiculous! Won't be coming back."
Christopher G.,"Hollywood, FL",8,24,,1.0,4/23/2015,"Pretty great setup here for watching the big game on a huge 108"" hd screen right at the bar...only problem is the manager won't take the TV off split screen so there's no sound and your forced to try and watch the game while 3 other channels are blasting you in the face with programming you couldn't care less about...it's annoyingly unbearable so I left at half time and finished my pizza at home...thanks a lot ...ordered the bjs favorite pizza and 2 beers. The pie was a bit dry since it had almost no sauce at all under the cheese. Go for food and drinks they're pretty good...don't expect any help from management if you want watch anything less than 4 channels on the big screen...thanks again and congrats on missing out on half my bar tab."
Jessica G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",139,21,23,4.0,6/27/2014,"I love BJ's and have been a regular since they opened one in Pembroke Pines. I normally go for the amazing food Happy Hour, half off all appetizers and mini pizzas. Drink deals aren't anything special for Happy Hour, like a dollar off cocktails and $3 house wine. I normally order a few appetizers to munch on and a mini pizza or two (yes, I look like a lil' piggy when everything comes out - no shame!). I highly recommend the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Egg Rolls. I've ordered and eaten both as meals. Ask for extra Poke sauce on the side with the Ahi...the flavor is amazing!  The reason for my four stars is the service. It is very slow at this time. For Happy Hour you have to sit specifically in the bar area. I've stood beside a booth for 10 minutes waiting for it to be cleaned so I can sit down. Once sitting it took another 10 minutes for the waiter to come, introduce herself and ask for drinks. When food is brought out the waiters seem to disappear and if you need the anything more or the check you are again on the ""search"" for the waiter. As a frequent visitor I do have a favorite waiter who is the exception to what I wrote above. Her name is Jessica and she is wonderful! From her welcoming personality to her attention to detail she keeps me coming back. When I go, I look to see if she is working to make sure I sit at one of her tables. She remembers me and always greets me with a huge smile.  I do recommend BJ's!"
Krisi M.,"Austin, TX",29,38,63,5.0,4/22/2014,This Is my first time here. The wait staff is so  friendly that it makes dining out a pleasure again! I had the ahi poke which was wonton chips with a ahi tuna and avocado salad and it was delicious. I also had their crafted soda in black cherry which was okay. My husband had the meat deep dish Chicago style which was okay but not the best. The atmosphere is great and I can't wait to come back!
Lena S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,12,,2.0,1/11/2014,"Mediocre food, not worth the price and service is so so.  The only reason for two stars was the beer.  Happy hour specials are only available if you sit at the bar, and if there are no tables available at the bar, you're S.O.L. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table in the main dining room despite the fact that the place was half empty.   Food came out quickly.  Typical bar food.  We ordered the calamari and the artichoke and spinach dip.  Both were just ok.  The boys each ordered a buffalo chicken pizza, which they said was good and pretty spicy.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad which was decent and my girlfriend ordered an ""off the menu"" buffalo chicken salad which she enjoyed.  We each had 3 beers and no dessert.  The bill was almost $200.00!  A bit pricey, in my opinion."
