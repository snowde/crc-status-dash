Tamela S.,"Hollywood, FL",173,128,481,1.0,12/21/2014,"I have never given one star.  I think for the amount of money I have spent here, it's warranted. Every time we order from these guys, we are disappointed.  We wait until our memory fades, and we look at the menu, and think, ""okay maybe it was what we ordered, let's try something else this time!""  No.  That's not it.  I am sorry to say that we have never been happy with anything from BJs. I always feel like I have been ripped off and stupid for even giving them a second, third, fourth chance. No more.  They lost our business for good today.  The only thing that was edible was my Hubby's turkey club.   I can't comment on their service, except that the food is packed with toast in a steamy container ensuring that turns out awful along with the the pasta that the chef couldn't be bothered to separate during the cooking process."
Vanessa G.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",1,22,9,3.0,11/18/2016,"I just flew in from Atlantic City..we were looking for a nice restaurant, but definitely something different from Jersey! So we came here. We sat outside, which was beautiful. The food was great, and so were the drinks. Cassandra was our server, she was very helpful, but it took us an hour to get our food. She was busy with 2 big tables.. which is understandable, but an hour was just a little too long. I would visit again though! Thanks again :)"
Trenesia J.,"Miami, FL",47,10,8,2.0,4/22/2017,"First and foremost while we were waiting to be seated (over 35min) several parties were seated BEFORE us that Arrived after us and had Bigger parties than us. We were completely skipped over. Once we were seated it took the waiter 15min to bring our Fountain drinks. We ordered the mozzarella sticks and the sliders for the appetizers which were great! For the entrees both of us got the Jambalaya and I ordered mine without the onions, peppers and tomatoes. They sent it out wrong, with everything I said not to put and my food was so burned all the protein was Black. When I sent my plate back the waiter said they would send out a FRESH one and not even 3mins later they gave my plate back and had Literally picked the onions and peppers off the top and left the rest. Once again the waiter sent back my plate this time the order was right and my meal was comped. Overall the Jambalaya was not terrible but I wouldn't order again, it was spicy but had no real flavor."
Desiree T.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",163,88,36,2.0,2/19/2015,"This place is always so below average. Nice location, but there's nothing special about this place. Although I've been here multiple times, I'll review my lunch visit today.  I came with a lunch party of 9. The appetizer plates came out dirty but at least the avocado egg rolls were good. VERY DISAPPOINTED with the Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich. No flavor at all, is this even chicken?  If you want beer and a pizooki, this is your place. But don't get your hopes too high for anything else."
Ruben R.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/3/2016,"Very bad experience. Had 2 ladies slip due to slippery floors. Tv outside did not work. Server only offered drinks once in 2 hours. We had 3 meals that were switched because they ran out. We were told when the brought the plate to the table. We send it back for a replacement. Finished eating and the plates were not picked up, even after we asked them to picked them up.  Not a good experience."
Kristina A.,"Miami, FL",2,31,23,5.0,3/25/2016,"I've been to several Bj's before and this one is my fave! The food was delicious! I got a full rack of ribs and there was plenty of fall-of-the-bone meat on that rack! The deep dish pizza was delicious - as always...service was great, too!!!  Everything was great!"
Lindsay S.,"Cincinnati, OH",13,3,,1.0,11/4/2016,"This is the 2nd time I've had a terrible experience! We called and made reservations early in the day for a party of 10, then called 10mins before arrival to make sure we still had the table they said yes it's ready. When we walked in FIVE workers argued with us and said that the table was given away. Not happy! Horrible management! They don't even apologize the lady who told us it was ready just smiled like it was funny"
Yami P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",41,50,,1.0,11/2/2016,In the beginning when this placed had opened I was static because there aren't many places with good food around this area. Anyhow the past few times this place is very disappointing. The food is wrong when it comes out and very very salty so salty you can't even eat it and I love salt . The service is horrible the waiters take forever and never even come back to see if you need anything else . The last waiter we had my father in law called him out and asked him if he was waiting on cars to valet lol . This guy brought our food and hour and half later literally really bad food and service don't even waster your time or money . Usually we tip pretty good but it was unbelievable. We gave him 5 bucks just to be nice but he deserved zero . He could have had 20 percent tip but hello he sucked .
Dwayne P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,38,52,4.0,11/11/2015,"Ashley is a great server. Check out their happy hour and enjoy the great service. Tuna poke, Brussel sprouts are the way to go."
Shannon K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",187,11,3,1.0,9/18/2016,It I could give 0 stars I could! This location does not participate in the half price all drinks and apps happy hour during football games that other locations do! They charge separately for ginger beer and vodka when you order a Moscow Mule and do not carry grapefruit juice. Horrible experience. Will go back to the location in WPB from now on.
Angie G.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,1.0,4/3/2016,"Chose the restaurant due to location. Both my husband and I know already the service is not fast, never has been since it opened, but we decided to give it another try.  Bad decision.  We had a waitress on her second night, seemed willing and able, nice smile. But each beer I ordered they were out? Crazy, so I order a margarita, bad choice! Stick to craft beers, the taste was cheap, sugary, just not good!  Ordering wings was a fiasco. The defining of boneless vs non was just so funny! I just wanted wings in their hot sauce.. We were delightfully surprised at the good taste..  The food, oh my my. The presentation of the tuna salad was just not pleasant, my Mahi dish was thrown into a bowl with a very small portion.  We looked at it, said no way.. This whole meal just was a disaster.  Took forever to get server or anyone's attention. The place was not full! Drives me crazy.. So we left, paid for one drink.. and went to another place down the road who looked like superstars compared to BJs I'm done. No more chances."
Kristina V.,"Hollywood, FL",52,4,,3.0,12/28/2015,"Meh. Ahi poke needs refinement. Chunks were pretty big and cabbage was very coarse. Grilled mahi tacos were not hot and tortillas were dried out and hard on the edges. Entree arrives 2 mins after app. Food tasted good. Atmosphere was nice. Could use a little fine tuning.  Side note. When I asked the server what she preferred between mahi tacos and ahi salad she said the tacos because she doesn't like salad. Lost out on an upsell as the salad was $5 more than the tacos.  In my opinion, it makes sense to recommend the higher priced item.....no?"
Alexa M.,"Hollywood, FL",0,4,,2.0,4/22/2017,"Honestly this restaurant is really good and the food is amazing but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. If you are coming to eat dinner you better plan for AT LEAST 2 hours of your night. This place takes so long for ANYTHING, whether ordering a drink, food, or dessert. Service is absolutely horrendous. Waiters are nice but waiting that long is NOT worth it. Also, the Oreo pizookie is amazing but I just ordered it and the icing wasn't even on it. Sucks."
Rossmari P.,"Miami, FL",159,68,45,4.0,12/20/2015,"Nice place to eat. Soup are delicious with bread and the best for drinkers, have lots of beers so you can try.  plates are small and if you eat a lot is not a good place for you. Taste is very well."
Sonia P.,"Miami Gardens, FL",61,103,148,1.0,9/12/2015,"I'm all for giving restaurants a second chance.  I believe that anyone can just have a bad day.  I can feel confident in my BJ's updated review.  I have tried them three times at different times and days and still had the same result.  Extremely SLOW and below average service. I went to BJ's at 1:00 P.M. and didn't leave until 3:00 P.M. This makes absolutely no sense!  You have to wait 15-20 minutes every time you ask for something.  The waiters/waitresses have a tendency of disappearing once they go in the back.  I'm not talking about 5 minutes ...I'm talking about for more than 10 minutes at a time.  I've had to ask hostesses to please send our waiter/waitress out so that we could get things as simple as a refill of water.  Wow!  Fool me once shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me!  I think I've learned my lesson now.  I'm officially done with this location."
Dorothea P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",269,104,331,4.0,8/2/2015,I come here occasionally because I am huge fan of desserts and I am obssessed with their pazookies!!! I have tried basically all of them and I keep on coming back for them!! I  love all the flavors but my top two are the peanut butter one and the cookies and cream one. The peanut butter one actually has peanuts in it so its crunchy and warm and delicious. The cookies and cream one comes with the frosting on top that melts and takes the pazookies to a whole other level.  I also enjoy the appetizers they have some really good dips like the pizza dip is delicious. I also like their salads. I forgot what it was called but theres this salad with seared tuna that i absolutely love.  I recommend the desserts more than the food but i still really enjoy coming to this place!
Lenya S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",78,78,245,4.0,9/16/2014,"On our usual Friday night dinner, we decided  to give BJ's a try, and what a nice surprise! We arrived to the restaurant around 7pm, there was no wait cause this place is gigantic. The hostess was pleasant and a smile on her face; she complimented my daughter and said she was adorable (that's always a plus). She took us to our table and handed over the menus.  Our waitress came right away she was ready to take our drink orders and suggested a few appetizers while we looked over the menus. We went with one of her favorites the pepperoni pizza dip - it was so yummy!  And another order of wings. My hubby is a wings fan.  For our dinner plates, we got shrimp scampi and the salmon with veggies. The salmon was overcooked, to the point that it was hard towards the corners, the veggies were spectacular crispy/crunchy.  The shrimp scampi with linguini spaghetti was really good, it also had a good amount of shrimp in it. Highly recommend it. Good experience, looking forward to going back and trying their burgers!"
Jacqueline M.,"Miami, FL",701,301,6217,2.0,7/17/2014,"The service at this BJ's was garbage. Our waiter was Hector and I apologize for calling him out but he was nothing to brag about.  We were a party of THREE. He took forever to take down our order, one out of two of our appetizers never came out. Once our order was ready, he brought my husbands salad, my salad and forgot our friend's soup and my dressing on the side. We all waited politely for about 10 minutes for his soup to come only after we asked for it assuming he'd forgot.  No apologies, no acknowledgement.  Granted, I won't be returning for his service but will gladly be seated in another section he's not handling."
Tom S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",9,37,46,1.0,5/21/2016,"Third time is not a charm. Ordered the queso it was chunky and cold. Ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad, lettuce was brown and wilted. Covered in smoked paprika enough to make you choke and when I did try the lettuce it was drowned in dressing. My wife ordered a brew house burger which is supposed to be a higher quality meat. It came out like shoe leather. The bun was stale and the cheese wasn't even melted. All thumbs down officially will never come back. Third bad experience over a 6 month span. It's a real shame we want to like this place bc the drinks are good but we will never be back again. I actually felt sorry for our waitress she did not look happy to be serving the hot garbage being produced from the kitchen today. :("
Steve G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",39,12,,5.0,1/31/2017,Actually a pretty pleasant surprise!  Ordered the cherry salmon which was delicious and the wine pour was on the good side.
