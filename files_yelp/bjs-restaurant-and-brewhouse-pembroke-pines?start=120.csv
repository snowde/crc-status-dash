Carolina P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",44,126,248,3.0,6/27/2014,"I find it hilarious how BJ's is located in the same shopping center as Dick's. LOL This restaurant is the easiest to find. You can't miss it! Anyways, their food is typical american food. BJ's offers their own beer as well as other craft beers. Their pizzas are pretty tasty and delicious. We were a party of 5 and didn't make a reservation. It was a friday evening and we were sat down immediately. Our waitress was outstanding and you don't really notice the food takes anywhere between 15-20 mins as you can find gigantic TV's to entertain you all throughout the restaurant. The TV's are always broadcasting sports on. The TV's are also well placed as all 5 of us could watch the TV's perfectly with no issues. Would recommend to anyone in the area. It's worth a shot, but not worth driving far away to get here. It's alright."
Alex L.,"Miami, FL",22,27,18,1.0,7/4/2016,"This chain restaurant is a waste of time. Menu items are limited. Table of 9 and not one plate was worth the time or money. Stick with the bar items from their brewery. It's the only thing that is worth your money. The waiter was very good, but couldn't substitute for the mediocre food."
RALPH D.,"Mt Vernon, NY",0,9,1,5.0,2/24/2016,"My wife and I wanted to a thank everyone at BJ's for a delicious and filling lunch. Our waiter Alex was so good,he made it so easy in choosing what to order,Great Job Alex!"
Sergio F.,"Miami, FL",766,1259,5145,3.0,10/28/2012,"If Yelp were a site for Electronics reviews, BJ's would get 5 stars! Their 4-split screen Flat Panel at the center of the bar - 4 sporting events simultaneously!! - are a sports and electronics geek's dream. There were also plenty more TV's around the dining room. As a Sports Bar and hangout spot, 4 stars seem fair. The hostess up front had a generally pleasant attitude, and the bartender did engage in some friendly college football trash talk.  The food though is where my experience goes to a ""4th and long"" situation. I will say that drink service was pretty on point but I'm chalking that up more to the service points. Being probably the only fan of Hawaiian Pizza in Miami, I ordered their personal size ""Sweet Pig"" pizza. A week out from having dined there, the only thing that stands out, that comes to mind is that the consistency reminded me of school cafeteria pizza. Come on, you remember the geometric, doughy one right? Heavier on the cheese than sauce? Coming back now?  To be a little more diplomatic, it's almost like a pan pizza. Personally I'm a fan of thin crust and more marinara sauce than cheese. Three stars is the average, with the ambiance and electronic entertainment raising the average. That could bring me back, but trying another dish."
Elizabeth B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,35,8,3.0,1/28/2017,Ehhh.... mediocre and over priced. Fantastic service from Darnell!!!  Food is blah though. Beer is nothing special. A lot of healthier and vegetarian options which was nice. But they still found a way to make the 'healthy' options not so healthy after all.
Megan M.,"Hollywood, FL",459,522,920,4.0,5/27/2014,"I'm always a little hesitant to review chains, but BJ's is pretty great and I want everyone to know!  I've had a bunch of their appetizers, tried their burgers, and devoured their Pizookies. I'd definitely recommend some of the small plates/apps. They have lots of cocktails and beers, and the bites are easy to share.  Their burgers are great too and you can ask for a parmesan bun- yum! It adds a little crunch that is awesome.  Now, the pizookie. This is what separates BJ's from every other sports bar chain. They have a variety of these desserts, and all of them are phenomenal. They're warm, gooey cookies with ice cream on top. Simple enough, but oh-so delicious. My favorites are the chocolate chip and the salted caramel.  Service has consistently been stellar, and I have never had a bad experience at this location."
Nestor R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",59,14,20,4.0,5/6/2015,"The food was amazing my wife had a low calorie salmon dish which was outstanding, full of great flavors. The service was pretty good, even with BJ closing at 12 I had a party of nine so kudos to them. Only thing I would say is that they were out of a lot of the in-house tap beer like thunderstorm IPA which is one of my favorite drinks there and the server really did not know exactly what was on tap but other than that it was a great experience at BJ's as always."
Alejandro T.,"Hollywood, FL",70,65,19,3.0,1/16/2017,"Appts was ok, drink choices were wonderful, many beers ti pick from !! There was a lot of people so it was noisier than i would prefer, service was ok..."
First L.,"Clarksville, TN",0,17,1,5.0,7/19/2016,"This is our new favorite place to come for beer. When we came in we were greeted and sat quickly. The waitress came and took our drink orders and suggested their avocado eggrolls, which were amazing. I had their bacon cheese burger and my husband had the one with jalapeños. Both were cooked how we ordered and the fries that came with it were so tasty. I love thin fries and these are amazing. The plating was interesting as well. The food was not served on regular plates, but the best way to describe it is a metal baking pan with brown wax paper as the liner. It was unexpected, given the interior of the restaurant. It gave it the feel of a small home town mom and pop diner. I am excited to go back to see how other foods are plated and presented, as well as how they taste."
Steve C.,"Davie, FL",1315,671,2242,3.0,4/23/2014,"Ducked in with Christine the hottie Zumba instructor to talk social media, merchant processing, and hand-painted and imported, festive hippie attire.  It rocked, here's why:  * Christine is super attractive * The hand painted, hand crafted attire rocks and I got some swag!  * Great service!  * Good energy in place We only had drinks this visit, but I will be back to taste the grub. It is obvious they are doing something right because the place was in the MIX!"
Maria A.,"Miami Lakes, FL",20,117,964,3.0,6/1/2015,I have been here on several occasions. I usually seat around the bar area. The beer and appetizers are good. I ordered a meal once and it wasn't so great so I just stick with the appetizers. I have been served by Jessica on more then one occasion. She has always been very nice and attentive.
Eric F.,"Hollywood, FL",2,3,1,1.0,1/12/2017,"My family and I have eaten several times in the past with no issues and great food and service. Unfortunately tonight my wife and i went and had a negative experience. Server was nice and friendly but our food never came out after ordering. We noticed literally people came in after us ate their food and had left. Finally we asked the server to check on the food. He came back in few minutes and said they were waiting on my tacos! How freaking long does it take to make tacos?? So we're about the leave and the manager says please wait and the food is on him. So we got it to go, get to the car and the order was WRONG!!! To many other places to eat, My family will go elsewhere."
Jesse V.,"Hialeah, FL",81,103,210,5.0,9/5/2015,"I regularly come here. I love this place. Usually what I eat Is avocado rolls for appetizers,  gourmet 5 meat deep dish pizza without bacon and the chocolate chip poozookie and white macadamia nut one as well. If you eat any of this you can't go wrong. Try it!.  I have also had the burger and it is decent. Nothing out of thr world. Service usually has been pretty good and if u come here often join the rewards program."
Amanda Y.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",224,49,2765,3.0,5/11/2014,Do not order Angus Beef Sliders.. It doesn't look and and taste good  For $9.25 not worth it at all
Mark S.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",239,352,504,4.0,5/30/2014,"Nice place: easy to find, cavernous interior, hopping at lunch. I had BBQ lunch plate (pulled pork slider, chicken breast, fries and cole slaw) for $7, and all beers are $3.50 at lunch (hefweizen was very tasty).  Interesting looking menu. If there was one of these in Aventura, I'd be a regular. Unfortunately, I'm beginning to think of Aventura as being prohibition-era, because of its lack of brewpubs.  Hey BJs, Funky Buddha, Wynwood Brewery: Aventura needs you!  We don't need more chains that serve other people's cheap Budweiser and Miller swill (RIP Tilted Kilt, welcome Buffalo Wild Wings). If you don't come and do it, I might just set up my own!"
Sydney P.,"Miami Gardens, FL",0,4,,1.0,4/22/2017,"Negative stars is what this place deserves. My family and I used to love coming here. I don't know what happened from the time they first opened until now but the service has become horrendous. From the moment we sat down there was trash under our table. The walls were disgusting; it looked like food was splattered on the wall. There was broccoli and wet spots on the floor right next to us. Every waiter must have saw the same thing, I'm sure they saw it and just walked around it. It was just a slip and fall law suit waiting to happen. The quality of the food was just fucking horrible. PDQ HAS BETTER QUALITY FOOD!!!! My salad was non existent, the plate was dirty, there was only a few leaves on it. I sent it back to get a new one, and get this they brought the same dirty salad plate back. On top of that we had to wait ten minutes for our server to come back just to ask for silverware. They had the audacity to bring my father burnt fish. They knew it was burnt I smelt it the moment it hit the table and yet they still brought it. It smelled like burnt shit in my opinion. It was obvious it was burnt. Don't get me started on the obviously burnt chicken Parmesan dish. What the hell were they thinking. Whoever was the cook was knew the food was burnt. I asked for my steak to cooked medium it was well done. Someone needs to go back to culinary school. The only thing that came out right was my brother's pizza.  If you can mess up pizza then we definitely have a problem. The service just absolutely horrible. This will be our final and last visit going to this BJ's. They have definitely lost our patronage."
Ashley G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,7,3,5.0,7/18/2015,"I absolutely love this place! Great food, great drinks and great atmosphere. My favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls. The dipping sauce is tasty and flavorful with a slight kick. The exterior is slightly crispy that just melts in your mouth after the first bite. The salad selection is great and always has a beautiful presentation. I've also had the tomato bisque soup in a breadbowl and it just blows Panera away! The breadbowl itself is garlic and toasted to perfection. Now onto the alcohol. My boyfriend and I are beer snobs and I must say I am a fan of their beer selection. Everyone has their beer preference, but I love my IPA's and love the Piranha pale ale. I've been here several times and highly recommend. :)"
Kimberly C.,"Delray Beach, FL",135,140,138,5.0,8/10/2014,Love it so so much!!! Each time is fun and yummy - prefer happy hour for a real treat!  Love the flatbreads too.
Jay A.,"Davie, FL",1,21,1,1.0,5/30/2016,Food was great I'll have to give it that. We had Michelle V who gave us the worst service I have ever experienced. I will never return to this location!!!!
Laura B.,"Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, FL",28,27,5,3.0,5/13/2015,"Starting with the positive: Large restaurant , pretty bar with marble bar top and very nice tables of all sizes in the restaurant.  Great Great selection of alcohol, beers and wine.   The food is just above average but it's adequate for a work group or a family .   They have small "" bite size"" choices as well as full meals.  If the food was a bit better i would give this restaurant 4 stars. I have been here 10 or 12 times and haven't found anything that WOWed me except the desserts. They are awesome!!!   The servers and bartenders are nice and knowledgable  Ending with the negatives : Awful happy hour.   They could have a big happy hour crowd but offering $1 or $2 off on certain items isn't anything special.   At the very least the drinks should be 50% off and they are not Smaller menu with better quality would be better Really have to raise the bar on the tastiness of the food"
