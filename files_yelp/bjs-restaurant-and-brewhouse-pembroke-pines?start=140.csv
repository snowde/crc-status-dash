Sonya P.,"Denver, CO",0,4,9,4.0,5/11/2015,"I just recently moved to Florida like 2 weeks ago. I live in Pembroke Pines, and this place is pretty amazing. I'm coming from Colorado, and so there are plenty of great places to eat in Denver. I think this place could hang. Try the tomato bisque soup loaf and anything else you order to dip in it will taste just as amazing as the loaf by itself!"
Mirielle C.,"Balboa Park, San Diego, CA",83,104,82,4.0,3/8/2015,"BJ's is a great restaurant, I usually enjoy my visits when I go. This particular BJ's is usually hit or miss. I'm leaving a review for this last visit though. We arrived promptly at 8pm, 4 adults and a baby, on a Saturday night. There was a 30 to 40 minute wait. While we're waiting, we order drinks. We got seated at exactly 30 minutes which was great. However, our server never came around. We must have waited for about 20 minutes. We finally flagged a girl down and she apologized profusely. Apparently the girl working our area was sick. She took our appetizer and drink order and came out pretty quickly with them. The stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls were DELISH. We ordered entrees, and those took a lil longer but overall worth the wait. I had the barbecue bison burger with the slaw and it was good. We had a cookies and cream pizookie which was great.  We took a lot longer than we expected here but our waitress tried to make up for the slow service. I'll be back ;)"
Cristina G.,"Hialeah, FL",3,10,42,5.0,4/20/2015,Nothing wrong with this place... Ouch! Peanut butter S'mores Pizookie. I went to heaven and came back.
Veronica A.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",43,1,,5.0,6/26/2016,"Great food, great beer and wonderful service. Carina is a great waitress and delivered us exceptional service. I will definitely come back with my family."
Meghan H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",28,3,,5.0,11/27/2016,The service was excellent and the food was delicious. I am a vegetarian with a gluten allergy and so I rarely eat out. The server made sure every was safe and just as I ordered! I highly recommend for anyone with food allergies.
Robert C.,"Hollywood, FL",28,4,16,5.0,3/3/2015,We always have the Ahi Poke for appetizer. It's the best we have had- or maybe the only that we have had since visiting Hawaii. Ave tried 5-6 wines on various visits and I gotta have my favorite crispy Jalapeño Burger no matter what time of day or night.
Phabulous N.,"Miami, FL",36,10,28,2.0,3/27/2015,"Been here before never had any problems, this afternoon everything was wrong, wrong, wrong!  The server apologized and the manager did visit our table.  Great customer service though."
Gio B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",264,6,,5.0,6/12/2016,"Awesome selection of food. I was quite impressed with the beer selection/combinations, especially the house brew. Not too pricey. A nice environment and had a solid selection of healthier food. Great place to check out"
Ernesto L.,"Opa-locka, FL",112,5,2,5.0,9/14/2015,"I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! I came here at least three times a month. There Porter Beer on Tap is my favorite of all their drinks. Mozarella Sticks, veggie pizza, and can't forget the PIZOOKIE!!!!!!!  The staff is welcoming, friendly, and always ready to serve. Awesome spot to celebrate a birthday or just simply hangout! One word to summarize this place, AMAZING!"
Martha B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7,5,,1.0,6/5/2016,"So I can't complain about the food too much, it was served promptly but I have to say the baked ravioli served in a hot dish - the melted cheese wasn't hot enough though to warm the ravioli and shrimp creole that came with the steak looked like vomit. But the worst aspect of eating here was the waiter who just had a ""I hate my job can't wait to get out of here"" attitude.  When told my parents were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary he said ""sure we can comp a free dessert"".   This was after we said we didn't want dessert...my expectation was happy anniversary, thanks for choosing us. Just rude!  Unfortunately we decided to give this place a second chance, remembering the food was pretty good and we gotten a lousy waiter last time...what were the chances of this happening again...too bad we chose to return on my parents anniversary."
Mike T.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,51,,1.0,2/28/2016,"The good:  The restaurant is large (no waiting for a table), well decorated, and has a nice atmosphere.  The menu is large with lots of options, including pizza, burgers, entree salads and a large ""lite"" menu.  They have a large beer selection that includes both their own brews and a dozen outside choices.  They also serve liquor.  Large TVs are tuned to sports.  There is a shaded patio with tables.   The bad:  The service is lacking.  Typically, the drink order gets taken and filled quickly and then everything goes downhill.  You can't find your server and everything takes forever.  Requested items, such as extra salad dressing, never arrive.  During one visit, there was no silverware on the table when we sat down.  I had to ask three separate times before it was provided.  The third request was made after our food arrived.  We sat and watched our food get cold while we waited for forks and napkins. We've also had entrees arrive just a few minutes after the appetizers. Recently, we came in early for lunch on a Sunday, around 11:30 AM.  There were only a few other tables.  Our drinks sat empty for most of the meal.  To get our check, we had to ask a bus boy to find our server.  The managers stood in a group by the entrance to the kitchen talking and ignoring everything going on around them.  Also, the food is hit or miss, sometimes good, other times lousy.  On a recent visit, I found two hairs in my sandwich.  I pulled one out of it, just as the server arrived at the table.  She took the food away and promised to bring a new order.  The manager then came over and announced that everyone in the kitchen wears hair nets.  He didn't seem to believe us.  My wife was nearly done with her meal before the replacement food arrived.  We were charged full price for the meal.   We've given this place a try 5 or 6 times in the past year. I'm not sure why there are so many problems, but the size of the place may have the servers and cooks constantly overwhelmed. In any case, I doubt we'll be back."
Stephanie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/2/2016,If I could give this place less than 1 star I would -  worst restaurant in south Florida!!!! Horrible service took over an hour to get our food and then not only was it cold but they took an extra 15 minutes for 1 person in our party to get her dinner. Tons of empty tables -3 waiters in our area so lack of staff was not the problem - poor management and lack of training is my best guess.   Do yourself a favor - stay home!!!!
Tony T.,"Hialeah, FL",2,9,1,5.0,7/16/2015,Absolutely love this place.There jalapeño burger goes very well with a wheat beer. Great beer Good Food  Service is awesome
Aisha M.,"Hollywood, FL",5,22,27,4.0,7/9/2015,"4 stars As long as you go to the bar, you are guaranteed good service. The food was delish, and 50% mini pizza during happy hour. $2. Off apps. Great beer selection!  Warning. If you decide to sit at a table its hit or miss."
Michael A.,"Delray Beach, FL",99,20,6,2.0,4/2/2016,"We made reservation for party of 12. They had the table ready on time. Food was mixed results, burgers were over cooked. Service took a dump, waitress took entree order after maybe 20 minutes after we already finished eating appetizers. Same waitress disappeared   halfway through our meal, never came back to ask for drink refills or to even see how we were. Got a new waittress, she was ok, not great. Dessert was sloppy and overcooked. Service has really gone down. Won't be going again."
Lily A.,"Hollywood, FL",1,16,5,5.0,10/20/2016,Love coming here. The place is beautiful. The clam chowder in a bread bowl is delicious and is the best in the area. The waiter was very kind and was very patient with us since my boyfriend took awhile to order. Everything came out fast. Would come again.
Howard H.,"Dania Beach, FL",531,457,3132,4.0,8/16/2013,"BJ's is a nice breweries house in Pembroke Pines.  If its not a little out of the way from my house, I'd have come more frequently.  I came here basically for their in-house handcrafted beers but the foods are generally pretty good.  Its got a nice decor and we always received friendly service.  On one particular visit we ordered a meat ball appetizer.  Ten minutes later the manager came by and apologized to us that the item was no longer in the menu.  Apparently we got the only remaining old menu at the time we placed the order.  Not a big deal we just ordered something else but its nice to get the personal treatment.  Haven't tried the deep-pan pizzas yet but its on my mind for my next visit."
Melissa Y.,"Pompano Beach, FL",88,3,,4.0,4/15/2016,"Food was very good. Some of it comes in little portions for the price. Besides that, Nice atmosphere"
Valerie C.,"Hollywood, FL",28,57,211,3.0,12/31/2014,You need try it for yourself until you experience the atmosphere and the food of the brewhouse it is only a name.
Jason C.,"Hollywood, FL",43,16,,4.0,11/13/2014,I really enjoy coming to this restaurant.  The selection of beer they offer is awesome.  Love their PM Porter.  Highly recommended this place.
