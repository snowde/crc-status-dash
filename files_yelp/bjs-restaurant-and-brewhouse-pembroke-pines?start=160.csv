Gilbert C.,"Davie, FL",29,20,1,4.0,12/16/2014,Great chain restaurant. Food is good. Beer is better. Tatonka stout is a solid and dark stout with hints if chocolate and vanilla. Good deep dish pie if u can stand the wait. Great laid back atmosphere.  Pazookie for dessert is a must.
Dara B.,"Sunrise, FL",118,395,398,5.0,11/8/2014,The country fried chicken is amazing.       I recommend it.    I was with a party of 26 and our server was very attentive and friendly.      I have to come back and try the gluten free pizza.    Its nice to see gluten free on a menu!
Favier F.,"Miami, FL",1,8,19,5.0,4/25/2015,I really love the environment and the waiters are super friendly! the Deserts that they have are beyond good! I would definitely come here again.
Korene S.,"Hollywood, FL",1,34,1,5.0,3/2/2016,"With so many options on their menu, I love this place and so does my kids. First time I visited I ordered the Thyme chicken which was really good.  I really like their burgers and I am really picky about burgers.  Be careful about ordering the pizzas because the way they have the prices printed is a little confusing and you will end up ordering more than you need.  Wish they had sweet potato fries."
Andrea C.,"Hollywood, FL",1,25,,2.0,12/28/2015,"I was so hoping to be able to rate this restaurant 5 Stars because the food is delicious, ESPECIALLY their GOLDEN BEET & ARUGULA Salad, but because the Chef hasn't been able to get the hamburger cooked the way my husband asks (Medium Well), and 4 out of the 7 times we've been there, the burger comes medium rare, and he either has to send it back or he is just disgusted and eats it, I have no choice but to give 2 Stars. ---Update--- for those who read my original posting, I am amending it, cutting out the incident about the check/change we didn't receive.  I spoke with the manager and he said its the policy of the restaurant to give the customer their exact change, it was just an error on the part of the waitress.   We haven't gone back yet, to see about the burger.   I selected LOUD for the noise level only because the music is often loud."
Lazaro P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",77,38,119,3.0,10/1/2014,Thank god the food is excellent but damn the service sucks big time. Took 15 mins to get a drink and it's because I got up to ask for assistance. Child's Mac n cheese came out quick but was cold like ice cream. Management love BJ's step up your game and hire more staff please.
Leighton D.,"Charleston, SC",304,188,139,4.0,11/21/2014,I have yet to go to a BJ's that has disappointed on the food. Pizza was good (even if it WAS the wrong order of pan vs hand tossed) for a late Sunday night meal to bring to the Hospital. Have been there a few times before and have sat out on the patio as well as inside. Service has always been great. Keep up the good work! My advice though? Skip the appetizers and eat dessert first!
Allen C.,"Miramar, FL",381,145,271,5.0,11/15/2014,"I've been a fan of BJ's for a long time. First one was in Texas. They had great service and made sure I left satisfied each time. I keep coming back for the Nutty Brewnette and the Brewhouse Blonde - my favorites! Ok, all jokes aside, this is a great chain of restaurants. Think of it as a high-end sports bar. It's a great place to knock back a few and make new friends or just grab a quick bite to eat, which is going to be quality food. You will always get your money's worth here."
Amber M.,"Hollywood, FL",281,7,3,5.0,3/25/2016,"Came here for our anniversary craving deep dish pizza. I'm from Chicago and we had waited all day to celebrate with deep dish pizzas BJs was one of the only places nearby that advertised deep dish. Waited maybe 30 minutes for the pizza, and come to see it's a RISING CRUST PIZZA. There's nothing ""deep dish"" about it. I was completely disappointed. There wasn't even sauce on the pizza! Just sliced scattered tomatoes on top of the cheese. While it was a mediocre pizza, I am so upset that we wasted $30.00 for a special occasion and on a rising crust pizza we could have got frozen from Publix. The waitress was very sweet and polite, however seemed a little uneducated about the menu, specifically telling us there were multiple layers of sauce and cheese, like a true deep dish. Lesson learned. Restaurant was clean, people were friendly, just super let down about this specific menu item. UPDATE The fact that the restaurant responded so quickly to my review means a lot. Working in Hospitality myself, I know you have the option to ignore the comment or address it. I will definitely be back to BJs to try one of their other menu options. (and they have an extensive menu!) I'm excited to try something else and again be greeted by the friendly servers and hosts there"
Ismael R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",29,5,3,3.0,8/23/2014,"This place is cool, has some craft beers and a fancy bar. It's your typical upper middle class crowd. The seating is nice although the service seems a bit slow."
Nelxy M.,"Miami, FL",22,41,106,3.0,9/19/2015,"This places is only good for burgers, pizza and dessert anything else in the menu is over cook or sucks . Please do not ask for steak nor seafood. Nice place just to chill but don't be too fancy so go the sport bar menu  wings , ribs, pizza and burger. Good selection of beers."
Jeanine H.,"Miramar, FL",11,40,125,5.0,1/24/2015,"Love every single item on their menu! Awesome prices considering the amount of food served and the quality. Excellent service. Perfect date night, family night or coworker lunch dates."
Mike T.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",84,6,9,1.0,2/19/2016,Well how do I start this this place was the worst apart from waiting 35 min on a table and then seat and order the food takes 45 min from the kitchen I get my burger and there was a wax paper in the middle covering the burger nasty then my wife's food ice cold pasta guess it was waiting on my waxy burger and kids corn dog was burnt yep this meal sucked... Never go back thanks BJ's
Jessica O.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",11,4,13,1.0,7/20/2014,"Ate here a few weeks ago excited to try the gluten free pizza! Being gluten intolerant, there are not many options for pizza, therefore I was very excited to eat a regular restaurant with my boyfriend and be able to enjoy a normal meal.  The pizza was good, although I only ate half of it and took the rest home.  I went to bed, and around 1am woke up with EXTREME stomach pain, which is what usually happens when I have gluten.... I spent the rest of the night on and off the toilet unable to sleep because of the pain.  The problem here was clearly cross-contamination. I should know better than to trust big restaurants like this to understand that people with gluten intolerances are VERY sensitive to gluten, but I decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  I will unfortunately not be returning, ever."
Glenn P.,"Miami Gardens, FL",4,34,31,4.0,8/21/2015,"This is one of my favorite places. My wife and I came here when they first opened a few years ago. I have a lot of good memories here. It was here where I was first introduced to the baked beignet. It was the best dessert I had in a while. I also love there different types of pizzas. One of my favorite ones is the Great White. I usually bring guest here when they visit me, and have them try the baked beignet. I haven't had any complaints so far. The only thing I would complain about is sometimes the service can be slow. I tolerate it, but hope they will improve on this. I like the ambience and the feel of this place. I go to BJ's other places and the food is good. Keep it up BJ's."
Liz N.,"New York, NY",0,3,,5.0,9/10/2016,"We ended up here because Longhorn Steakhouse had an hour wait.  And boy are we glad!  This place was absolutely great.  The food was good, the service was good, and although they were busy we didn't wait long for our food.  Our waitress, Angelica, was attentive and always with a smile made sure we were not in need of anything.  I'm in the area so will definitely make this a favorite spot for me."
Danielle J.,"Gilroy, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/8/2017,I usually love BJ'S Brewery . But this time I don't know what happened.Tuesday night we went  to the BJ'S  Brewery  on Colman in San Jose . Didn't take too long to get seated .  Waitress came and took our drink order and they were fine . At 630 we placed our food order . Which was fish with quinion and spaghetti with jumbo meatballs. Side of garlic knot bread. Garlic knot bread came out about 640 . Bit into it was just garlic powder sprinkled on bread on the outside . Some bites had flavor but most didn't.  At 726 we were thinking of leaving it had been almost an hour since we placed our order . Finally food comes . The fish and quinion were excellent.  I bite into the spaghetti it was like spicy like salsa . Part of me is like tell the Waitress than other is your starving it took almost and hour for food . Just suck it up and eat it . 730 Waitress comes telling this gentleman here will take over well I'm on my break . She goes 740 were ready to go . Can't find the guy any where . Finally at 745 we walk to the front tell them we just want pay and leave . They get us a Manger he takes spaghetti off our bill and gives us a coupon for a free dessert ( but you have spend 9.95 in order to get it so not really free) . Than they get another Manger he gives us a 25 dollar gift card . They both apologize.  We leave at 810. Honestly will go to BJ'S brewery again but not the one on Colman.
Joe G.,"Fort Pierce, FL",326,215,439,4.0,11/21/2014,Came for Happy Hour Friday nigjht. Soñé decent specials and always consistently good food. It gets very busy with the after work crowd from the local business.
Lisa F.,"Hollywood, FL",1,31,29,2.0,1/20/2016,"We wanted to go somewhere close and so we tried BJs. The decor is nicer than most quick-casual restaurants. The service was terrible (slow and inattentive, no care for our comfort. The servers slammed things on the table as they whizzed by). Our food was delivered cold. We had asked if the fries were coated, and we were told they are not. We ordered the wedge fries. They are coated. We figured the fries and the Flatbread would have been good if they were hot. The portobello swiss vegetarian sandwich was hot, and it was good. The restaurant was full, but not crazy busy. A few observations: The menu has too many items. The lack of server knowledge, and poor food quality are indicators of this. We eat out often, and were hoping to add this restaurant to our repertoire, but, alas, too disappointed. We both agreed we will not return..."
Jessica G.,"Margate, FL",481,618,1408,3.0,6/25/2014,"There is a BJ's in Coral Springs that is much closer to my house, but I was in the area running some errands on a Saturday so we decided to stop in here and grab a snack and a drink and catch the second half of whatever World Cup game was going on at the moment (there have been so many, I don't remember what countries I was watching anymore).  We arrived a little after 6 and were seated immediately. Our waiter was quick to offer us drinks, there are lots of fun looking specialty drinks but I didn't try any of those. They also have quite a few beer options with beers unique to this establishment (restaurant & brewshouse). The waiter asked if we needed more time to look at the menu. I of course needed more time especially when I noticed how many choices there are. Pizza, sandwiches, burgers, entrees, salads, pasta, shareable apps. I don't think the menu is quite as extensive as Cheesecake Factory but I think it was pretty close.  Since we were there more for the game and I am not generally a big fan of this American family type restaurant I didn't get into the entree portion of the menu but instead ordered an individual buffalo chicken pizza. I have to say I was impressed with the pizza. It had enough spice/tang to be buffalo but wasn't too spicy for me. It also had a little bit of ranch. but that flavor was thankfully not overpowering as I'm not a huge ranch dressing fan. It had a good amount of chicken (though it did taste a little processed) and I really loved that the pizza had celery on it (chopped into fine pieces of course). The crust of the pizza was cooked well and was probably more of a coal fire/brick oven style considering it's crispiness, though it wasn't blackened at all, which I also appreciated. The service here was decent and the waiter did his best to keep an eye on drink refills. I will say that it was a very fast dining experience, and for this type of family restaurant that is probably what they aim for, but in general I prefer a little less rushed feeling, though I will say when the server delivered the bill he made sure to tell us to take our time. On another note as we were leaving around 7 a large crowd had formed at the front and there was obviously a wait, so we must have been lucky at the time we walked in as prime dinner hours do seem to get quite busy."
