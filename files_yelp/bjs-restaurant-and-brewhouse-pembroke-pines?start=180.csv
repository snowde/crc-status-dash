Dion J.,"Novato, CA",6,52,3,3.0,10/27/2014,"Beer and pizza are awesome, after that everything falls off.   I have tried a couple off different soups, sandwiches, and entrees they all seem to be lacking something.    Today i had the half sandwich and soup lunch special.  Their wedge fries taste like they had been in the freezer for awhile.   The clam chowder did not taste freshly made.  I should have know better than to get clam chowder. Thats on me!  The grilled pesto  chicken sandwich was decent.   I will stick to beer and pizza for now on."
Felicia J.,"Plantation, FL",24,26,24,5.0,10/22/2014,I love going to BJ's. They have some of the best happy hour and late night happy hour prices. They also extend happy hour to days on the weekend when there is a big game playing. I don't think a lot of people know this.  This place also offers snack sized plates and lower calorie meals. They are good for being willing to make substitutions if you are looking for low carb And more veggies.
Catrina G.,"Opa-locka, FL",0,5,3,4.0,3/19/2015,"This is on of my favorite restaurant the prices are reasonable. The food is great theirs a waitress name Michelle who is very nice and courtesy. The fried nacho dip i love, wedge salad and their fried southern chicken is great. I eat their at least twice a month it's worth it!!!!"
Somalis M.,"Hollywood, FL",13,6,2,3.0,1/19/2016,"I went there with my husband. We had to wait around 20 min to be seated. When they showed us our table, the server came and said hi but took a while to bring the menu.  she kept walking around our table. She brought the food out but forgot to bring the utensils so we had to wait for them while the food got cold. We ended up asking another server for utensils. the drinks were good and so was the food but the experience  wasn't a good at all."
Chris B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",16,15,,3.0,7/19/2015,"This would have been a 5 star review if the kitchen was up to par. Either there Kitchen Manager needs to tighten up or be replaced because his staff is embarrassing him/her!!!!Our server provided hands down one of the best experiences I've had in a restaurant in a while. He gave great recommendations and was very attendant. The FOH (Front of House) staff was very friendly we were greeted immediately. Me and my girlfriend ordered two of there in house brewed beers and they were phenomenal. We also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as a appetizer and the portion was a complete let down for the price but it was very tasty. For entrees we both ordered burgers my girlfriend ordered hers well done and mine was medium. That is defiantly not how they came out!!! Mine was well done and my girlfriends was medium rare to medium. Once our server was available he came right over and took my girlfriends burger back as I was able to tolerate mine. They returned my girlfriends burger looking like a complete disaster. She had cut her burger in half before she sent it back and they returned it the same way. That means they opened up the burger pulled it apart and recooked the meat. It's was a sloppy mushy mess when we got it back and the best part was that it was still pink in the inside! I finally got the managers attention and made him aware of the situation and he definitely seemed bothered by the kitchens amateur mistakes. Another thing that really bothered us about the kitchen was the fact at how dirty it seemed. Our table was positioned so we could see into the kitchen when the servers opened the door. All we saw was trash, food, and what looked like greasy rags on the floor by the dish pit. I understand this is the dishwasher area but if this is what guests can see when the doors are opened the least you can do is keep it somewhat clean. In my opinion corporate/owners need to have a sit down with the GM of the location and consider replacing there Kitchen Manager. We even witnessed what looked like a duplicate order of desert come out of the kitchen. What a joke!  The only reason I am giving this review 3 stars instead of 1 is because our server Darnel was phenomenal and because the manager on shift made things right. They are the reason I will give the restaurant another shot. If you decide to dine at there establishment request Darnel."
Madeline L.,"Opa-locka, FL",0,16,15,5.0,9/2/2015,the hickory burger is amazing!! and dessert mini pizookies are awesome!
Hadlee G.,"Ozark, MO",15,48,68,1.0,7/1/2015,Went after 3 great visits over a year ago and has gone way downhill. The service was terrible the burger was way undercooked and came out wrong twice. The chicken was bland with no flavor and the manager was very weak. This has gone way downhill and I will no longer go to this one as well as the others in my party one of whom went here twice a month.
Delmi M.,"Miami, FL",5,13,3,5.0,12/12/2014,"Wow!!! Great service!!! Julie was amazing!!! I've been to other bjs and service is ok but she just did everything perfect!! They got our order wrong, she took it back and they took longer than expected so she went to the manager without us saying anything and gave us our free desert !! That's is what I call good costumer service."
Ray R.,"Opa-locka, FL",4,88,20,3.0,11/9/2015,"An easy restaurant to go to for groups. Lots of selections. But their sodas and pazookies stand out. Definitely your ""Chili's"" or "" Applebees"" type restaurant."
George K.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",31,11,,5.0,2/17/2016,Love this place. Great food and atmosphere. Nicely decorated and TVs to watch sports without blaring music. Several excellent craft beers to chose from.
Bryan R.,"Miramar, FL",82,148,147,2.0,7/6/2015,"BJ pizza - on Pines 10-14 nice decor - no sauce on pizza weak  , appetizer & beer killian red very good 5.5"
Ariadna P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,76,15,4.0,6/10/2013,"I love love love this place! My ultimate favorite has to be the California Club Flatbread.  For dessert, I always try a different Pizookie, which are these delicious warm brownie-like cookies topped with ice cream. They have so many different flavors! the last one i had was red velvet with macademia nuts, it was delicious but extremely sweet! About the service, the server was very helpful and took good care of us, however, the food and the dessert did take a little longer than expected."
Jose G.,"Opa-locka, FL",103,9,2,4.0,1/1/2016,"Ive always enjoyed the large selection of food here. The pace is gentle, the ambience is low light and cool. The beer selection is various and the staff is helpful. Be sure to sign up for reward points if you come here often, they add up."
J. D.,"Miami, FL",97,93,78,5.0,6/2/2015,I've been here a few times and the food is always great.  The customer service is good waiting is minimal.  I love going here with my friends.
Shanene W.,"Miami, FL",29,26,7,5.0,9/23/2014,Honestly I haven't had anything here that I have not liked! And I am picky! The Bloody Mary they make is super awesome. The jambalaya is my fav!  Great service and sign up for your reward points. I almost always get a free dessert every time!
Jessica L.,"Miami Beach, FL",8,6,2,1.0,6/19/2015,The service here is terrible. The staff is always playing around and not attending to the customers that are waiting for assistance. To get happy hour you have to sit in a designated area. In my experience they did not let us sit outside because they didn't have enough staff to attend us. Whoever is managing this place is doing a horrible job. The food is okay I mean its regular bar food but the staff and the service are horrible. Will never go back to this place again.
Robert C.,"Margate, FL",174,164,39,4.0,7/8/2015,Another really good chain restaurant.  Very good food & service.  They have some interesting cocktails.  We will be back.
H R.,"Opa-locka, FL",0,8,,2.0,6/28/2016,Decided to give this place a second chance. The place was slow and so was the service. Not worth my time. I'm not a picky person but this place is not all that. I won't be coming back. Just go next door next time.
Natashia N.,"Opa-locka, FL",38,14,74,1.0,9/30/2015,I waited for 20 minutes for server to approach my table and they never came. I just got up and walked out. Now I know why I don't eat at this location. The service here is horrible.
Megan B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,67,2,2.0,12/5/2015,"The service here is painfully slow, the food is usually good but like the service it takes forever for the food to come to the table, I also had to ask for my beverage several times before it arrived. Our drinks finally arrived after we received our appetizers which took about 15 minutes after our order was placed, which is really slow considering it was lunch and there weren't that many people in the restaurant. Not sure if I will be returning anytime soon."
