JoCat R.,"Miami, FL",56,172,95,5.0,5/25/2014,Love this place!  We come here all the time for happy hour and sit in the bar area. They have amazing happy hour specials and mini bites. We love the Jeremiah Red beer and the crispy artichokes with their amazing aioli. Yumm :) Their service is always great as well. And they have tv's everywhere!
Eduardo V.,"Miramar, FL",140,101,314,5.0,1/7/2015,"ALWAYS GREAT SERVICE, ALWAYS GREAT FOOD!!!!! The only time we had a dull moment at this restaurant was on a holiday time and they did everything possible to make sure we were satisfied with everything..... Its great coming to BJ's because their menu is so extensive there is always something new to try.... Also their customer service and waiters/waitresses are top notch. Highly recommend trying the place out."
Kay B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,32,12,5.0,3/7/2015,I just found my new favorite restaurant. Will definitely be coming back. The food selection is great. My husband had the balsamic grilled chicken and I had the atlantic Salmon. Both were excellent. We also had the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Best lettuce wraps ever! So tasty! There is so much more I want to try so we will be back. Highly recommend.
Evelyn R.,"Miami, FL",24,14,,2.0,3/7/2014,"I went to BJ's on a Thursday night for the first time, and I was greatly impressed by how good the place looks inside. The bar looks awesome and they had tons of good beer on tap. It was also very bright, had tons of tvs in good locations, and the hostess was super nice. That is about the only good thing I have to say about this place. The service was mediocre at best, and the food was awful. I ordered buffalo wings and fries, and my husband ordered a bison burger. The wings were tiny, undercooked, and chewy. The dish comes with ten wings, and I ate four. I only reached four because I was starving. I did not taste the bison burger, but my husband said it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  I will give them credit for the fries. They were good.  Needless to say, I will only go back if the only thing on my agenda is to watch a game and drink beer."
Tania R.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",31,10,,3.0,1/2/2015,This restaurant has good appeal but the service always changes every time I go sometimes great sometimes poor. I really didn't like when the waiter brought out my appetizer and entree together. It's okay when the service is good.
Janine S.,"Boca Raton, FL",37,92,20,4.0,5/30/2015,"Omg omg ! Love this place for its eclectic menu. Today I ventured into honey sriracha Brussels sprouts and fried artichokes . Amazing ! Awesome combination of spices and crunch . And for dessert , one of my personal favs peanut butter s'mores . This is made with marshmallow fluff . To die for !"
Armando O.,"Miami, FL",2,9,,5.0,8/1/2015,"Great place to eat and hang out. We've had different plates and they're consistently good! Great service! Love desserts! Try the pizookie! They offer a lot of different kinds of foods, really healthy, dinner, lunch specials, great burgers and pizzas. And draft beers."
Aly P.,"Boca Raton, FL",8,20,1,1.0,6/13/2015,"I felt something on me and found a huge roach! threw him off of me. He ran around for a bit before he went to the next table where they screamed about until one brave woman finally killed him. We told the waiter who got the manager. (The waiter was pretty bad too. Horrible service and he just walked away from us, he didn't care about his tables at all..) The manager basically believed I had brought it in the restaurant without noticing!!! He said and I quote ""well you just sat down so how do I know you didn't bring it in with you?"" I was sitting inside his restaurant for 15 mins before being seated. I'm sure as hell would have noticed that big sucker on me earlier. He was rude, and didn't even compensate for the experience. Just gave me this face like ""ehh we don't have roaches. It's you"". He basically called me dirty. (For the record I showered before I went out)  When my boyfriend tried to explain that there was proof of the dead roach, he ignored him and never had anyone clean up it up! The busters moved the tables around and cleaned the tabletop but never cleaned the floor. People were eating next to it. This was my first time here. NEVER AGAIN. and native Floridians know if you find one that big, there are more!! I refused to order food because if there is one in the dining room, who the hell knows what's in the kitchen. Nasty. Nasty. Nasty. I posted a picture of the dead roach - should notify the health inspector on them!! Don't eat there please, unless you don't care about your health."
Marcos A.,"Miami, FL",15,36,20,4.0,3/25/2015,Bj's is always a good solution for food especially when meeting people from business. I had a Mediteranean pizza which I love and I could not go wrong.
Andrea N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,10,,4.0,11/29/2016,"Just had dinner at the bar.  Truth be told we prefer having a bite and a beer at the bar.  The bartenders are always attentive and quick to offer a sample if you're confused about what beer to order.  The woman next to us hadn't been there bf and got 3 small tastes so she could order a full beer and be happy with her order.   Anyway, we ordered the fried portabello strips which were so good!   The batter was light and the mushroom was not rubbery (which can happen easily) and the dip sauce was so delicate but tangy.   I ordered the hickory burger which was cooked to perfection(medium rare) and didn't need any additional sauce since the BBQ sauce and buttery brioche bun were perfectly matched on their own.   My husband got the late late night burger- a burger with a fried egg.   Also cooked perfectly and perfectly messy.  I got the wedge fries (my favorite) and my husband got the skinny fries (his favorite).   My only complaint is that I had not enough room to eat all the food it was so good.  Oh, and I drank their Jeremiah Red while the husband had the stout.   Their Red is a good easy beer to drink - not too strong but a good full bodied flavor.   Their stout was gorgeous, it had a beautiful waterfall as it settled - yet was not as strong as a Guinness and settled in your stomach a bit lighter, too.  In other words it doesn't fill u up."
Ian O.,"North Miami Beach, FL",78,85,69,3.0,6/7/2014,"The interior is very spacious and it has that brewery industrial look. The bar is big and has plenty of beers on tap. They also have many spirits and wine to choose from as well. The food is tasty and fair priced. I gave them three stars because the service was slow seating us and once we sat down we didn't get a server for over 15 minutes. It was a Saturday at 430pm,  not prime time. And the place was somewhat busy but not packed or wait times to sit down. I waived down a hostess and asked if we can get some service and she apologized and said that they were having a shift change. Ok, understandable. Then a server came promptly afterwards and apologized for the wait. Then it was sooth sailing from there out. Would I return? Yes, if I'm in the area, but I'm not going out of my way or anything."
Christian Z.,"Hollywood, FL",44,11,,4.0,10/18/2015,"5 stars if you're  a Big beer connoisseur, and enjoy tasting unusual brews. Very grand, spacious sports themed restaurant with tasteful decor. I've been here three times in the last 6 months because of the incessant requests of my 11 year old daughter who loves the flatbread pizza here. It is otherwise good food and service. Nothing memorable enough for ME to want to return more frequently."
Morgan L.,"Miramar, FL",3,8,,1.0,6/22/2015,So far not happy. Been waiting on drinks for 15 min which is absolutely ridiculous.  Took 20 min for the food order
Amanda S.,"Nuremberg, Germany",171,100,191,4.0,12/27/2014,"Service was friendly and efficient. The food was good. Honestly, it wasn't amazing, but good. The selection is huge for both food and drinks. The in house brewed beers we tried were all good!"
James P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",49,60,27,4.0,4/11/2014,"We would come here frequently but had not been back in a lil over a month. Usually we have a white pizza since the miss loves it, but not on this trip. I was more in the mood for a few beers and some appetizers while we watched the heat game. As always the fried artichoke was awesome and we tried the new corn fritters, which were OK. We also ordered a flatbread with the pesto and added grilled chicken since there was no type of protein/meat on it. Everything was good as always, but i was a bit disappointed that I got too full to have my macadamian pizookie. (If you haven't tried it make sure you leave room for this great treat!)"
Melanie V.,"Hollywood, FL",9,4,,5.0,9/17/2015,"I love this place. Especially their appetizers. Every time I go I have trouble picking out which one I want. :) Their egg rolls, calamari, mozarella sticks are always on the top of my list. I ate here about 2 weeks ago and ordered their ribs... oh my jesus. THE most amazing ribs I have ever eaten. I was in heaven. I always experience good service, sometimes a little slow but nothing to the point were I get impatient. I will keep coming back here, especially for those ribs!"
Tina V.,"City of Industry, CA",314,454,653,2.0,12/20/2013,"Its BJ, what more can i say.. Miami standard is horrible service...."
Joan D.,"Weston, FL",0,6,,5.0,5/13/2016,"My husband and i had the baby back pork ribs and they were by far, the best ribs we have had anywhere. Love the large selection of sides!"
Rob K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,51,9,4.0,3/26/2015,"This place is pretty good for a chain restaurant. It's nice, it's clean, service is pretty good.  I went here with a party's of 10.  One couple ordered a deep dish pizza.  It was pretty good but I am old school.  My Pie was the standard for deep dish in south Florida.  This is no My Pie but it's pretty good.  Their flatbread pizzas are very tasty.  I had the shrimp scampi.  I'm not really sure what to say about this classic shrimp and pasta dish.  The waitress made a point to tell me that they make it with a more lemony flavor. Why would you do this to a classic dish.  It wasn't bad, just unexpected. Prices are good appetizers are pretty good as well. My only real complaint would be the enormous size of the menu.  9 pages.  To me that's excessive."
Brian C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",23,86,36,5.0,9/20/2011,"Great food and service. Just opened yesterday.  Lunch specials daily along with early happy hour (3-7) and late happy hour (10-close) Had the half flatbread with salad, which was a great portion for the price. The avocado egg rolls were excellent.  Service was excellent, always walking around and asking if we wanted refills, etc. They have some great special brews, and also regular soda.  The cream soda was great, homemade, and was actually healthy based on the ingredients!"
