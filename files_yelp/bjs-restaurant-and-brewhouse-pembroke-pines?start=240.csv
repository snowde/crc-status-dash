Davina R.,"Goodyear, AZ",146,12,27,5.0,5/19/2014,"If you come to BJ's in Pembroke Pines, be certain to ask is there are any availabilities in Charlies section. Great server, personable,  and clearly just on top of his game... Thx for being Awesome Charlie Hite Davina & Adelina"
Elie F.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",9,48,8,5.0,2/10/2016,"Okay, so.. This is my second review for this location and I had to give it 5 stars instead of 4 this time! Our server was Amy, she was amazing  professional and very knowledgeable. My partner and I were celebrating our Valentine's Day early because we work on the actual day and chose BJ's because of their amazing beer and menu selection. We ordered to start some avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms. They were so good we scarfed them in minutes. Then to our entrees: my partner (your average manly carnivore) ordered the full rack of ribs, asparagus and fries. I couldn't stop picking off his plate everything was so delicious. I was in the mood for some ahi tuna and ordered their seared ahi tuna salad.. Now, you never really hear anyone boast about how f*ckin tasty a salad is... But this salad was a tasty f*ckin salad.. I ate everything. Like. Everything. Now that we've completely pigged out we were like... Okay, desert time. Dude, this dang s'mores peanut butter brownie was (take a guess) Aaamaazing. Needless to say we had a fantastic dinner and can't wait to return!"
Jessica F.,"Coral Gables, FL",0,5,2,1.0,9/30/2016,"I'm from Miami so I have my far share of bad restaurant experiences, I figured Broward was a little worse. I arrived with my son, elderly grandmother and my mother 3 woman and a toddler. We stopped there for a decent quick meal around 3pm more or less the restaurant was starting to full up quickly with customers when we were seating we slowly saw other tables getting filled which is not a big deal but when you are the first seated and your food has not arrived when other tables seated after you ate had dessert paid and are getting up to leave...there is an issue. We were there for nearly 3 hours!!! It was the longest wait of my life for good and mind to tell you we were a party of 3 and a toddler! The mac & cheese was the box crap people buy from the grocery store which you just add water and mix horrible!!! My sandwich was great I'm not sure if I was just delusional at that point I thought it was great, sadly I do not understand how tables around us (larger parties of 6!) seated after us ate their meals, desserts, paid and left the restaurant. Bottom line the worst waiter in all of history."
Kevin D.,"Hollywood, FL",71,64,6,4.0,4/12/2014,"I went here on a 2nd visit,  had the classic burger 8 oz with potato wedges as fries, it was excellent and perfectly cooked.  It was happy hour after 10 pm all apps were 1/2 price including quite a few beers.  The burger and 1 beer was $11 and change.  Not bad for a late night food run. On my 3rd visit I had the turkey burger with the potato wedges, again it was excellent and another 1/2 price beer.  The burger was about $8.50.  This time my server was a bit slow as she catered on tables with 2 or more.  Understandable but you can't ignore others. I will be going back as it's a good spot after 10pm when most places close."
Oland Z.,"Hollywood, FL",0,17,1,4.0,6/15/2015,"Love this place. Good size menu, with reasonable prices and tasty food. Great atmosphere. But the servers could be nicer."
Kat T.,"Plano, TX",13,87,15,3.0,7/8/2013,"The food was good, the root beer made in house was also good. They had an allergen menu which was really great and I felt confident that even though the server was not well prepared to handle a person with food allergies, the kitchen seemed accommodating.  I would return.  The only reason for 3 stars is because it took a while to get service once seated and the appetizer must have been flown in and the plane was delayed.  It took nearly 30 minutes but it was good and they brought the salads in the meantime.  I'd also urge them to have a diary free pizza.  I hear the pizzas are great but with a dairy allergy, I couldn't try them.  At least have a soy cheese, dairy free crust option.  It wouldn't be that hard and would be a good seller.  Another reason for 3 stars is due to the overcooking of the steaks.  By the time the refire comes out, dinner is over.  You have to ask to get something comp'd for the mistake and they only discount the dinner slightly.  I'd like to see the steaks cooked properly more often. But the bathrooms were filthy, I left and went somewhere else to use the bathroom.  Ewww."
Walter B.,"Coconut Creek, FL",4,18,5,1.0,9/20/2014,"Nasty! Gross! Unsanitary! I was appalled when the server felt that it was perfectly okay to resolve the ""hair in my drink"" concern by simply transferring the contents to another glass! I refused the drink and decided to leave, but not before informing the manager. He pretended to care. Save your money and protect your health. If the server thought it was okay, it typically means that there is an unsanitary culture among the employees.  No thanks!"
Kerrie M.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",28,72,3,5.0,9/8/2013,"Amazing beer, a good gluten-free selection, awesome salads and burgers, and excellent service!  This place is new to Coral Springs, so it is still pretty consistently busy, and a pretty consistent wait, so this was my first time visiting. We went on a Sunday for an early lunch, and did not need to wait too long! Our group had several special considerations, like a gluten-sensitivity, and an extremely picky youngster. Our server, Jamal (I think), was fantastic! He was super-helpful and catered to all of our odd requests without any trace of irritation, and really went out of his way to make sure everyone was happy with their food and their beverages. It was probably the best service I have received in the area from a restaurant that did not fall into the high-end category (think The Capital Grille).  The drink selection was fantastic! The handcrafted root beer was the best I had tasted in a long time. My daughter had the orange cream soda, and it was perfect. If you are a beer fan, the selection of BJ's craft beers well worth the visit. The Jeremiah Red was excellent, even though I am more of a stout drinker. I had the P.M. Porter, and was blown away! It was porter-perfection... The food was delicious. I am picky about Cesar salads, especially the dressing. The dressing was perfect here! They used just enough to accent, and did not drown the salad in it. I had the chicken in mine, and it was delicious and juicy. A friend let me taste the Cesar with seared rare ahi tuna, and it was possibly better than the chicken. The gluten-free pizza came with a choice of toppings (per their menu, any of their many ""classic"" pizza toppings except their housemade meatballs are gluten-free!) and my daughter had blackened chicken on hers, and loved it! My other daughter was a fan of the classic burger, and the youngest member of the group loved the Mini Corn Dogs!  In all, I was quite impressed with BJs. While the long line in front will probably continue to dissuade me from coming here too often (I rarely have the forethought to call ahead), I will likely be back here... Soon!"
Haydi F.,"Hollywood, FL",52,3,3,3.0,4/15/2015,The food is good but the service is really bad we had to wait almost 1 hr and a half for our food.
Robert R.,"Miami, FL",9,87,67,2.0,10/6/2014,"BJ's is one of my favorites, great locations, good facilities and lots of options in the menu... and then they make the common mistake! FAKE! ""Freshly Squeezed Lemonade"". For real!  Something so simple! Now it makes me wonder, what else is fake. Tortilla checked soup! with hardly any Tortilla... Really! Is this only Penbroke Pines?"
Lourdes B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,4.0,4/1/2016,Wonderful wings &  hamburgers...The best waitress is Angelica....we always make sure we ask for her...
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,9/28/2014,This BJ'S BREWHOUSE opened up in the old On the Border location.The place closed and building was demolished and so they built this place.I had lunch with my son and triplet nephews today the place was packed and out the door but trust me it's worth the wait our waitress was nice and our food was great they're spinach artichoke dip with mozzarella sticks are awesome especially with the side of nachos and the main thing is their pizza I love it this Pembroke Pines BJ'S is awesome.I've been to other locations and so far this is the best one.
Lesbia B.,"Hialeah, FL",0,2,,2.0,6/13/2015,"The waiter did not get the order right and left one of my daughters out; but that was not all, all of a sudden a roach was flying on our table and the table next to us....I basically had to kill it so it would not bother anybody else ....disgusting!!!!!"
Frank M.,"Hialeah, FL",5,190,56,3.0,2/11/2015,"Service was great super friendly. Now, we order the Chicago deep dish pizza what a disappointment. It was more like a pizza hut with a thick dough."
Tara B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1084,48,70,3.0,1/24/2012,"After driving by BJ's daily and avoiding it mainly because at night it looks like a mad house with packed parking lot and line out the door (and I soooo hate waiting in line forever) I did stop in the afternoon with my kids and there was next to nobody in there! It was PERFECT for me! No crowd, no noise, no line, no waiting! They have lunch specials until 3 pm Of course it was right after 3 when we got there! Server was great, fun, personality and extremely attentive to our needs. If you drink, they have like 6 pages of beer/wine in the menu. The desserts are made at the time of order and are yummmy. See some of the pics I'm going to upload of the Pizookie Trio dessert along with calamari which was lightly breaded and not oily, greasy like other places. The dipping sauces were perfect. My son had the cajun pasta and thought they over seasoned it though, all he could taste was the seasoning and the chicken was bit dry. My daughter had the jambalaya and pretty much same thing...over seasoned, but still decent. I had the overstuffed potato with chicken & broccoli with alfredo sauce and it was the biggest danged potato I've ever seen. We eyed a few other things we would like to try so we'll be going back... but not during the dinner/weekend rush though."
Michael S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",299,414,457,4.0,10/16/2011,"Heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out. I feel like most ""chain"" restaurant are overrated but this one was completely different. I used the call ahead service before we arrived. When we got there I couldn't believe how busy it was. This place was popping and people were everywhere! We actually had to wait in line just to get to the hostess. She gave us a buzzer and said we'd be called soon. I am very glad we did the call ahead, the wait was around seventy minutes. Fifteen minutes later the buzzer went off and we were ushered to our table. Our server was very friendly and always checking on us. I ordered one of the beers they make in-house and the mini tacos to start. The beer was in a big glass and it was very GOOD. And the chicken tacos that were brought out were amazing. My date ordered fish and chips and I ordered the california chicken sandwich. Both dishes were big and delicious. I can't say good enough things about our meal. The food paired with excellent service came together to make an awesome dinner. All the food plus the beer came out to under 40$ which is awesome in my book. I will definitely be coming back here!  Tips: use call ahead service for shorter wait time!"
Sean R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",162,162,89,1.0,12/5/2013,"Not a fan of this BJs.  I received horribly slow service from my waitress Gaby.  Not just for the food, but for the drinks as well!!  15 minutes for a draft beer?!?! My burger was cooked medium as requested, but all juice had been squeezed out and it was dry.  But not quite as dry as the wedge cut fries!!  They were like eating sand.  They also forgot my toppings on my burger. I've been to multiple BJs restaurants before and this was by far the worst.  I will not return!!!"
Monica T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",52,111,47,1.0,10/17/2013,"Ok so tonight I stumbled upon bj's since its pretty close to my boyfriend's house and wondered why we haven't dine here in a while. Now I remember. I've been here 2x previously when they first opened. Food was meh- nothing to write home about and tonight was most certainly the case. We decided to give them another try just to see if things improved. We started out with the berry cider and a Long Island. Had to send back the long island because it was too sour and tasted like juice. Berry cider was ok, not the best cider I've had. We know that they are famous for their pizza and we've had it before so we wanted to try something different so we got the Hawaiian mahi and the pot roast. Bad idea. First of all, our server was very friendly but truthfully service was way to slow for a weds night. When the food finally came out, it looked pretty disappointing. The mahi had no flavor what so ever, there were charred bits from the dirty stove and the whole dish was bland and unappetizing. The pot roast was too saucy and salty. The only good part about that dish was the mash potatoes.  Worst of all, I had found a little hair on my fish!!! Ok so we were pretty much done with the meal when we saw the bill, close to fifty dollars for 2 drinks and 2 disgusting dishes. And I'm not usually one to complain.Mind you the Long Island was 10 freakin dollars. The only reason I left one star was because the server was polite. Avoid at all costs unless you stick with their pizza, which is average at best and their beers."
Andy B.,"Naples, FL",16,60,5,2.0,4/15/2013,"Clearly this location is VERY poorly managed and staffed.  I've been to the BJ's in Orlando, FL and have never experienced any issues with food and service like I have the past 2 times I've frequented their Pembroke Pines location.  On my last visit, I asked for an appetizer which got to the table about 35 minutes after the order was placed.  The dish came out cold and pasty.  The lunch was the same: all of our meals tasted lukewarm.  My best guess is that they did not coordinate the order correctly.  Drinks were rarely refilled, even though there was plenty of waitstaff hanging around idly by the front door of the restaurant.  Clearly there is plenty of room for improvement at this location."
Veronica J.,"Miami, FL",793,195,1344,4.0,2/11/2013,I love this place for happy hour.  You can't beat the $3.00 glasses of wine and half off appetizers and individual pizzas and flatbreads.
