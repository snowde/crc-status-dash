Charles D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,,1.0,5/21/2016,"First, let me start by saying it as a Friday night and due to the amount of people waiting we didn't expect exceptional service. We ended up getting a table in the bar so we didn't have to wait long. We were very impressed by the variety on the menu but choices does not constitute good food. We ordered drinks and appetizers first and it started of the artichoke and spinach dip came out cold.  They fixed it and we were enjoying the ambience.  We decided to order our meals and we ordered a ribeye dinner w brussels sprouts and rice and the turkey burger upgraded with the wedge salad.  The wedge was good however it came out before my food.  The food arrived and what they were advertising on the menu as a ribeye they delivered a large sirloin and insisted it was a ribeye. If anyone knows their steaks, a ribeye is a totally different cut of meat than that of a sirloin.  A ribeye is round the fat running through with a tenderloin cap around the other side of the fat, by far the most flavorful steak due to the fat that runs through the meat.  A sirloin has the fat that trims the outside of the steak and is a much cheaper cut of meat.  So we told our server that you must have accidentally ordered me a sirloin, no worries, just make sure that you only charge me for the sirloin.  Oh I'm sorry sir but that is the ribeye our sirloin is smaller in portion. The server walked off without saying anything.  We were sitting there wondering okay should we keep eating or should we wait.  About 10 minutes later, the manger Scott who was very cocky but didn't want to argue probably bc he knows what the restaurant is server their customers. The manager says my sirloins are 5 oz an my ribeye are 14 oz.  To which we replied, thats fine but then this is just a bigger sirloin and portion size doesn't determine the cut of meat....We asked so are you telling me this is a ribeye.  He replied I dont argue with customers. He wouldn't answer and he tried to quickly to rectify the situation by asking what else do you want.  We said thats bc there is nothing to argue about, this is a sirloin.  Just charge me for what you served.  He walked away without saying anything. At this point, we were treated like we were the problem and we were ignored simply by bringing it to their attention that they are advertising and selling sirloins as ribeyes on the menu=false advertisement.  We are foodies and we frequent nice restaurants and we know the DIFFERENCE.  It was an insult. We asked for nothing for free and we could have complained about how long the food took, the brussel sprouts were under par, the turkey burger was ok came out separate than the side salad it was supposed to be served with and without the dijon.  We waited 15 minutes for the dijon to come, by that time we were disgusted by how we were treated by management we asked for our bill.  The server came to the table and said so I suppose you don't want a to go box.  We said no thank you, HE REPLIED FAIR ENOUGH.   WE got our check was charge for the sirloin and full price for everything and left 15% gratuity.  We were not apologized to and WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!  Listen, people we didn't want anything for free but at least acknowledge!  Any restaurant manager should know their cuts of meat.  Its basics. Hopefully this post forces them to serve what is advertised.  I challenge anyone to order their ribeye and you be the judge.  ITS SIRLOIN!!!!!"
MickeyBlue I.,"Hollywood, FL",225,672,3129,1.0,11/25/2012,"Went once, never returned. If you wanna drink I am sure this place rocks! But any sober person will know the food sucks. They invested a lot in the appearance factor but forgot to hire quality chefs, the menu is big not really eye catching. I'm surprised they're still in business."
Denver E.,"Hollywood, FL",225,322,378,3.0,6/21/2015,"I have been going to BJ's for a couple of years now and the first thing that comes to mind is consistency. It has always been the roughly the same general experience each time I go. In some places, that is a drag, but for this restaurant, it works well. BJ's is a big place with many tables, lots of big screens, and even some outdoor seating. As far as the menu, it's big. I mean binder book big, and oddly enough, that works here. I have had the fish tacos and they were ok.. but I think their pizzas are way better. My favorite part of BJ's actually isn't the food, but instead their beer selection, made in their own brewery.  If I were to suggest beers, hands down the best three are the Brewhouse Blonde (a very nice pale Kolsch style beer), Jeremiah Red (my personal go-to, a nice malty red number) and Tatonka Stout (an exceptional stout that seriously just gets better everytime I drink it). Service has always been great here, and the one time I ever sent something back, they were bending over backwards to make good. The only reason that I give it 3 stars instead of four is because the food is a bit mediocre, especially when compared to the quality of the beer and I feel like it can be a bit pricey. I will tell you though, if you are looking for a good spot to grab a pizza and a beer or three, BJ's is a good spot."
David W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",157,175,350,4.0,11/26/2012,"In the area and saw this place. Any place that calls itself a ""Brewhouse"" requires an investigation and I am happy to report that BJ's has passed its initial test.    Yes, they have beer here. Not just your everyday brands but there own home brew. Nine different varieties from a light to dark creamy stout. All very drinkable with the Piranha pale ale and the Hopstorm IPA  topping my list. I recommend ordering a flight, aka sampler, which consists of 8 healthy sized samples and choosing your own personal favorites.   As for the food, everything ordered in my party was eaten with gusto. I myself had the  Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger. Not the healthy minded fair I usually order but  chili made with beer poured over a 1/2 pound burger served open faced. I just had to try and happily so.  Other items worth mentioning are the flat bread pizzas and the Tuscan tomato bisque soup in a toasted sourdough bread bowl.   This placed rocked on my first visit and I will be back to drink more beer and try more of the menu. So to sum it up, yes I do very much think you should give this place a try. You may even find me here sampling more beer. Join me, Cheers"
Natalia F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,21,,3.0,6/4/2014,This place could have so much potential. Me and my boyfriend totally gave up on this place. The service is the slowest I have ever experienced every single time I have been there which I'd say is about 7 or 8 times. And it's pretty expensive for average food. Prices don't bother me but for average food and terrible service I don't think its worth it
Diana C.,"Hialeah, FL",42,7,3,5.0,2/22/2016,Great food & service! The guests that came with me were so impressed with the rewards program that I have with you that they also signed up!
Ashley J.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,7,1,1.0,1/13/2016,"Horrible service ! Took a hour and a half to receive my food , people that came in after me received their food BEFORE me and the food wasn't even worth it ! to add to the fire, members  of my party didn't even receive their food  despite the hour and a half wait! The calamari was soggy and the shrimp and asparagus dish was horrible ! Complete  waste of time , I sent my  food back and will NEVER come here again nor recommend this place ! The waitresses don't care and obviously were not prepared and unable to cover several tables for a large party. People, you're better off dining inside McDonald's !"
Michelle C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",63,89,33,4.0,1/30/2013,"This is a great place to go in a group. There is so many different choices on the menu that there's something for everyone. Food was good, nice presentation and great service."
Kerry O.,"Clifton, VA",296,36,1,4.0,8/27/2012,"Delicious beers, yummy food and a casual atmosphere! Was in town visiting some friends and they brought me here. We tried a pleathera of the small bites that were delicious. The mac and cheese was to die for, the bruschetta was amazing, the avocado egg rolls were warm and delicious. I was not a huge fan of my dish (the Cajun pasta). It was a little bland and didn't have much to it. My girlfriend ordered the Parmesean crusted chicken and it was to die for. I was extremely jealous and kept sneaking bites off her plate!  Her husband got the chicken club and loved it. Didn't try it, but I'm gonna take his word for it.  For dessert we got the Red Velvet Cookie thing. I'm not normally a sweets person, but this was delicious. We were all fighting for the last bites.  The wait staff was very helpful and warm. It was overall a great experience minus my main dish. Could have just been an off night."
Malia H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,3.0,8/6/2016,I was excited to try this place because I have been looking for deep dish pizza in South Florida for a long time and someone recommended this place to me and said they had it. I do like the atmosphere of this place and the location was pretty easy to find. For appetizers I got the chips guacamole and salsa and that was pretty good and then I actually was very excited to try the deep dish pizza. I ordered sausage and pepperoni and I was not that impressed. The crust was good but it was really not deep dish pizza it was more like a Pizza Hut type taste to it the sauce was very sweet and the cheese tasted very good but I just could not get past the sauce. The crust was good I wish it had been more deep dish like I thought but hey it wasn't horrible I just don't think that I would go to this place again and order the pizza. For dessert I did get some sort of cookie with vanilla ice cream on top and that was amazing I do have to get for thumbs up well actually stars for that that was really really good. I think next time that I come back I'll just try to order something different because normally I don't trust Pizza in a place that doesn't specialize in it but I heard so many good reviews but I thought I would give it a try. I really wanted to like it but I think I'll stick to Giovanni's or Unos for deep dish pizza while in Florida.
Nicole T.,"Hollywood, FL",1,6,10,2.0,3/29/2014,"No flatware, sticky menu, one napkin per person, and it goes downhill from there. So what exactly did I get for $34.98 let me explain. Our waiter was obviously young and inexperienced and not properly trained. We ordered an appetizer plates of avocado rolls and two pina coladas. Worst pina colada I've ever had in my existence! It taste like tap water mixed with remnants of what might have once been a coconut. The waiter was courteous enough to switch our drinks at no charge and the second round was definetly a winner. I had a strawberry splash not sure what's in it but it was yummy. My bestie had a strawberry margarita she gave it 5 stars. The avocado rolls were pretty good but it just did not wow me. Overall, I give the entire experience a 2. 1 point for my drink and 1 point for my besties drink that equals 2. We have no plans of ever returning not even with a free gift card!"
Vero D.,"Miami, FL",26,60,11,5.0,11/30/2012,"Bj's is by far one of my favorite places to go to around my area. The good is great my favorite thing would have to be the Chicken Parmesian Crusted Chicken, if you have yet to try this then you are truyly missing out. Large area can porb host any type of party. They do have tv's around the bar area. They also brew there own beer which is pretty darn cool since we do not something like that around the area. the Pale Ale is my all time favorite for beer and they have a Cadallac martini that is pink and taste delicius, be carefull they will creep up on you! ha  The service is not the best but ive had worse and ive had better, I have been approx 15times and like 2-3 times it has been bad service. Overall it is a nice place with a nice vibe, everyone should check it out!  Oh and P.S you can call ahead to hold a table!"
Lolo F.,"Hollywood, FL",1,27,,2.0,8/19/2014,"The place is attractive but the service was beyond slow. What you get for the price is not enough. I would go again if someone else was treating or I had a gift card but not if I had to pay. No one should have to wait 45 minutes for a simple order, nothing special & the place was not busy."
Bindia K.,"Asheville, NC",77,85,11,4.0,8/10/2012,Ok so I def shouldve taken pictures.   The staff are just friendly or maybe its because  went for lunch lol.  My sisters and I got a bottle of Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio for half off... 2 pints of their berry cider for 7 bucks.. and two mini deep dish pizzas (the buffalo chicken is really good and mild PLUS how can you go wrong with a classic deep dish) and we shared a santa fe salad which we subsituted mixed greens instead of romaine.  The food came out in a timely manner but again we went during lunch. I really liked the food and I am super picky AND I was in FL for a couple of days so I couldnt come back.   For dessert we had ...wait I need to CAP this ...the BAKED BEIGNET OMG I havent had a beignet since cafe du monde and this was not cafe du mondes yummy version BUT it was amazing in its own way.  Especially since it was baked.. My sisters and I fought for the last piece and wanted another for each. PS the discounts were because we came in during lunch.
Aisha M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",222,53,17,5.0,9/20/2014,"I was so excited about this place opening up in my town. Each time I visit family in Dallas, BJs was a must! So you can imagine how excited we were when we didn't have to take a flight to eat here. To start, menu is huge so everyone will always find something for their taste buds. I usually order cheese sticks, some fruity drink salad and pizza and to top it all off a pazooki! I love that this place is open till late even on the weekdays. You will not regret coming here"
Jacqueline N.,"Hollywood, FL",0,8,1,1.0,7/14/2014,Worst service I've ever had! Food came out cold. Manager was clueless! I'll never go back! My husband and I went there right when it opened and it was good. Not really sure what happened! Hopefully they pull it together because the foods not half bad when the chef is good. Management really needs to step it up and hire some good servers. I've been a server and know it's not the hardest job. Especially when you only have one table! Would not recommend this place to anyone!
Debby S.,"Hollywood, FL",45,18,33,5.0,10/12/2014,"Great place to watch football! 1/2 price appetizers and small pizzas during all NFL games and $1 off cocktails in the bar area, too! The wait staff is super busy but manages to keep everything under control."
Jannine A.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",4,40,12,4.0,10/6/2014,This was our first visit to this place . They have a great menu with a lot of things to choose from. The beer selection was also good. Prices are ok and the food is delicious and portions are big. We really like the hamburguer which are made with real beef. We didnt give a 5 star just because the service was a little slow and it took more than 25 min to get our food. Eventhough this...we will defintly come back again to try other food
Jorie M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",45,33,3,2.0,11/1/2014,"Really, really slow service!!! I really wanted to love BJs. As far as chain restaurants go, it is a pretty facility with a great menu--something for everyone from kids to dieters to anyone seeking traditional sports bar fare. But the service is horrible! And the food is just OK. Not bad, but not worth 45 minutes."
Al A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",18,525,9,2.0,5/21/2012,"It was a touch expensive given the quality of the food, but the quantity was sure there.  I'm amazed I finished my plate! They have a tasty homemade selection of beers but a terrible selection of hard alcohol.  The line was extremely long (60mins!). The atmosphere sorta sucked given the open pit design.  It was LOUD.  The washrooms were clean and well lit.  Service suffered due to poor training of the staff.  The menu was interesting as it was clear they weren't afraid to mix it up."
