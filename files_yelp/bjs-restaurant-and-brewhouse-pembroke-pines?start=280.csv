Victoria W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,2,4.0,1/11/2014,"This place is good for a laid back night out, especially for their drink selection. I like coming here, but the service is not always consistent.  This week they were incredibly fast, but one time I came for lunch and it took two hours.  There were only two of us and we did get dessert and an appetizer, but that's ridiculous for lunch service.  Their ""enlightened menu"" is worth it if you are watching calories.  The maui glazed pork chop is really good (I've had it twice) and it has never been dried out, which sometimes happens to pork.  Jeremiah Red Ale and the Pink Caddilac are worth a try if you are looking for a good beer or a mixed drink.   The deep dish pizza is good too."
Beto D.,"San Francisco, CA",149,128,13,4.0,6/21/2014,"My wife and I were looking to have a few drinks, decent dinner, and TV's to watch soccer - check, check, check. We walked in and were seated almost immediately and most importantly, our server was on point. Our food was delicious (NY Strip Steak, The Brew Burger, and a couple of appetizers), drinks were good (Nutty Bruenette & top shelf margarita). The turnaround time was fast and TV's were stratigically placed throughout the restaurant - good vantage points from most seats in the restaurant. The only reason it does not get five stars is that it was just a little pricey - a few dollars over what I was expecting for a brew house. I will be back - good atmosphere for the World Cup - Enjoy."
MiMi V.,"Weston, FL",8,57,41,1.0,3/27/2012,"This amusingly named restaurant is apparently an offshoot of Cheesecake factory.  Big warehouse feel with loud crowded dining room.  Had never been before and have driven by numerous times.  Decided to try with a friend.  Big mistake.  Food was lousy, oversalted, greasy and lacking in flavor.  Started with spinach/artichoke dip which had no flavor and served lukewarm.  Had spaghetti and meatballs.  Sauce was sparse and oversalted, meatballs were dry and overcooked.   Service was terrible.  Perhaps, I'm a snob or old world but when did waiters stop picking up dishes as they go?  Had appetizer and salad and waiter never picked up even after I neatly and pointedly stacked at edge of table.  Had to repeatedly ask for things (mayo, refills, ketchup, fork).  I didn't even bother tipping. Will not be bothering.  Seriously, can't Pembroke Pines do better?"
Esther B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",344,331,,5.0,4/4/2012,"I love this place! So totally Cali.  It was one of those ""clueless where to go for dinner"" nights. The strategy: just drive. The requirements: someplace I haven't Yelped yet. BJ'S let's try that. Hubby immediately agrees. Wonder why?  Driving up I'm thinking this is gonna be three stars (yelping begins in the parking lot now). But wait, this place looks pretty cool. Walking in...maybe this will be a 4 if the great taste in decor carries into the menu. Checking out the menu...OMG I want everything!  We ordered 3 small plates: 1. Tuna Poke. Amazing, fresh, simple yet absolutely delicious. Ordering this again for sure whenever I come here! Cubed tuna and avocados over a bed of cabbage slaw, with the most delicious light and zesty sauce that was barely there, but oh so perfect. This was served with some flaky, cracker type ummm...thingies (thingies=I can't describe these) that were just the right texture. 2. Meatballs. This tapas style dish, along with several others in this section of the menu are small and inexpensive, which is great if you're into menu sampling and want to try a few things. Great flavor. Nice dish. 3. Fried artichokes. An old favorite, done better than most other places. I'm guessing bread crumbs were Panko, but they were seasoned, so you had crunch AND flavor. I love adding lemon to artichokes, but the sauce they served it with was nice and light and pretty good. Another winning dish makes the score three for three. Outside seating is great. Large, covered patio. They don't take reservations, but they do have call ahead seating. Mid-week visit was no wait, but I understand weekends are a completely different story, so CALL.   The menu here is pages long (a la Cheesecake Factory), varied, and inventive. Deep dish pizza is a house specialty. So is their famous dessert called ""pizookie"". Can't wait to try both and write an update.  Oh, just one more thing...am I the only one who finds it funny that this place should end up in front of Dick's? I'm just sayin'..."
Aleena G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,2,,1.0,10/10/2015,Horrible horrible service. Food was average/ not even hot. Our order for an appetizer was a simple Caesar salad no dressing and they got that wrong twice. HORRIBLE customer service- would not return due to staff not respecting customers time. This was also the second time I went- just to give them another chance.
Jessica B.,"Miami, FL",251,257,,2.0,7/10/2012,"Went with my bff to pembroke mall and decided to try BJ's.  Had read the reviews in Foursquare but decided to come anyways.  Well have to agree with them. Came in and sat right away but the food took almost hour and the restaurant not even packed. Place is nicely decorated and the atmosphere is great.  The food on the other had was bland and dry.  We started with the stuffed mushrooms as appeitzers which was the best plate i had there then I had the plate with the maui pork chop (dry) and it came with red potatoes which i switched for a vegetable medley (dry) (flaovrless) and green beans, i had to ask for tartar sauce to give it some taste.  My bff ordered the balsamic chicken (dry also) with white cheese mashed potatoes which were good. Overall i would say that i probably wont come unless in the area which i never am."
Tara E.,"Pleasant Valley, NY",11,11,,4.0,9/8/2014,Our server was so nice. Maybe this place read the yelp reviews because she seemed a little overly paranoid with making sure we were happy. We had excellent service and wonderful food. The garlic parmesan wings were amazing.
Jamie F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,,1.0,10/10/2012,"Strike three.. BJs is out! 1st time- walked out: 10 mins b4 server even got to table 2nd time- waited too long for slow service 3rd time- poor service & got order wrong I love the menu and had outstanding service at the BJs in Dallas,TX don't know what is wrong with this PPines crew."
Hector R.,"Hollywood, FL",2,10,8,5.0,3/29/2015,"Michael LaGuardia is the man! Ask him to help your table. He helped customize our meals, made the best recommendations, and even admitted to a mistake in pizza size. But he accommodated our table with salads to help the wait time. He nailed it!"
Elizabeth P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",293,224,287,3.0,5/17/2012,"Awesome brewed beer!  Service can be slow at times, though.  The food is ok but not the reason I go there.  It's definitely the beer!"
Valarie S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,,2.0,12/7/2014,"Just finished Sunday afternoon late lunch here. Very disappointing. Ordered sirloin steak, medium rare, horseradish mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. The beans were the best part of the meal. The steak had a very dry, coarse texture and needless to say, was tough. The outside was over seasoned and over seared. The mashed potatoes had waaay too much horseradish and a strong vinegar taste. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE horseradish, especially with beef, but it was just too much.  I left half of the potatoes and 2/3 of the steak on the plate. The restaurant was comfortable and the menu extensive. I will try it again, but for something more casual. This meal was a huge miss for me. The service was great."
James G.,"New York, NY",0,2,,4.0,9/12/2014,"Loved this place. Very friendly and accommodating front of house staff. Our waiter specifically was not only funny but provided an honest opinion on the menu. You certainly can't go wrong with the pizza, and while I'm sure all of the toppings are good, our chicken bacon ranch was delicious. The new Salted Caramel pizzookie was arguably the best part of the meal."
Candy C.,"Hollywood, FL",20,83,232,3.0,4/26/2012,New local neighboorhood restaurant/bar. Good environment and the food is good. Great place to go to if you're not sure where to go but don't want to travel far or make lunch/dinner plans too difficult.  I recommend the Avocado eggrolls !!! (Nothing like Chili's)... the avocado filling is smooth and plentiful. The miso salmon was good but not the best miso I've had. One plus is the salmon was cooked just right. Not dry and not raw. The portions are very large. I would recommend visiting this restaurant for lunch/dinner.  P.S. One downside is the long wait (as with all the main restaurants in the area during weekend dinner time). So go with a small group and sit at the bar for immediate seating!!
Monica C.,"Miami, FL",179,216,92,1.0,1/4/2012,"Fellow Pembroke Pine Neighbors!  I know that there isn't much to eat in our hood BUT an hour wait for a table really?  Come on!!  I have gone twice to this place and each time they have had an hour wait.  Mind you I have NEVER gone on a Friday or Saturday.  The last time I went was on a Monday night.  An hour wait on a Monday night is overkill.  When we asked why they had an hour wait when all the tables outside were empty we were told it was because they were understaffed.   Needless to say, we did not wait and honestly I have given up on this place all together.  GET IT TOGETHER BJ's."
Tony B.,"Caldwell, ID",0,3,,1.0,8/28/2014,"I am a loyal BJ's customer because of the Texas BJ's. The BJ's on Pines Blvd is a disgrace.  I have tried this one five times now and each time the service was Horrible, unfriendly, slow and rude. Food was mostly consistent with others and very good. I quit going because it was not good bad the steakhouse next door was superior in every way.  I returned against my better judgement because my daughter flew into town and loves the food there. Big mistake. Not only is the service worse and tactless but now the food has gone down hill. The crusted parm chicken white sauce was gross. Oily, separated and sour.  Unfortunately this eatery will not be on my list again. 5 strikes and your out.  The longhorn steak house has both lunch and dinner that is worth the money both in taste and service."
Stephen G.,"Hollywood, FL",30,2,1,1.0,4/2/2015,Gave them 2 chances to get my wife a steak that wasn't overcooked. The second time they actually microwaved and then charred a steak in order to serve my wife. Told them to take it off the bill they did then as we are getting ready to leave they bring us another steak. Utensils were filthy. The waitress was ok but seemed overwhelmed with her tables. Whoever the guy with long hair was just dropped off plates and walked off even as we were telling him it was wrong. The ribs i had were good. Perhaps the rib cook should teach the steak cook a thing or two. Bathroom was horrendous. Other diners were complaining about food quality as well. 3 for 3 as far as failing to get anywhere near our simple expectations. Management needs to shake things up a little there or perhaps be part of the shake up. Was not happy at all. Don't waste your money there. The afternoon staff seems to have their stuff together. The location in Doral is totally opposite of this place go there if you must. I told a server that my silverware was dirty and she.took them and never showed up again.
B F.,"Lake Worth, FL",7,74,48,4.0,6/13/2015,The menu at this place is enormous a little too big for my liking. But the waitress was extremely nice and she was patient. we wanted a sampler of beer and she took her time explaining the beers on tap. It is a very casual and laid back environment with lots of TVs to watch sports if you wish. We ordered fish tacos and we got I have fish and have shrimp they were delicious. It came with an avocado sauce not really guacamole but it had to do. I would go back and visit them again
Anne M.,"Hollywood, FL",1,39,40,4.0,3/7/2014,"Big variety in their menu and although I haven't ventured off too much on their menu there food is always great, service is so-so and on some occasions they have gotten my order wrong but food wise, it's pretty good."
Ruben V.,"Hollywood, FL",0,18,17,4.0,8/6/2014,"Been to BJs once before in San Francisco about two year ago and loved it! Now I'm back in South Florida and didn't even know  they had this place here. But today was a special occasion, my wife's birthday and did some research and found they have one right in my town. We all met after work for dinner and really enjoyed ourselves! Service was excellent and ambiance was great as well. I definitely recommend."
Rebecca L.,"New York, NY",0,135,46,3.0,3/17/2014,I was expecting a bang for my buck....but that didn't happen. The food is okay...really bland and no seasoning.
