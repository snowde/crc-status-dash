Cristina P.,"Miami, FL",14,118,31,4.0,4/11/2012,Great food and really good beer.  The only downside was the wait was long and the staff was pretty slow. Would definitely go back - maybe in between meals so as to not wait too long.
Wendy B.,"Opa-locka, FL",216,50,25,4.0,11/19/2011,"Today, when my uncle suggested we go to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse for lunch, my first instinct was to check my Yelp app to see what my fellow Yelpers had to say about it.  I must admit I was concerned when I saw all the posts about the wait time but everyone seemed to say the food was good so I figured it was worth a shot.  We were starving and the hostess said the wait would be 20 minutes....I didn't believe her because there seemed to be way too many people waiting for it to only take 20 minutes.  Nevertheless, we were already there, so we sat down on the Bar/ Take Out side (because there was nowhere else to sit).  Just 2 minutes later, much to my delight, one of the waitresses comes up to us and says, ""There are empty booths by the bar if you don't want to wait...it's first come first serve.""  Wonderful!!!!!  Withing seconds we returned our pesky little beeper and had a menu in front of us.   I must admit, although our waitress was very helpful and polite...she was a bit slow considering she was only serving a few tables on the bar side, but I can forgive her for that, and I'll tell you why.  The food in this place is ridiculously delicious!!!!!  The spinach stuffed mushrooms melt in your mouth.  The fish tacos......I don't even have words to describe how delicious they were!!!!  And let me tell you about dessert....someone's genius brainchild.....it is called a Pazookie!!!!   We had the red velvet pazookie.  Whoever came up with this little gem deserves a medal!!!!!  All in all, despite the fact that the service could be faster, the food was sooo good it made up for it! There were so many other things on the menu that looked just as fantastic, that I can't wait to go back and try them!!!!   I will definitely be visiting this hip little establishment again!!!!"
Lloyd L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,7,,2.0,3/21/2015,"Last time I went was St Patrick's Day. Hostess was not accommodating, said there were no booths, although there were, she was just too lazy to clean any of them and it wasn't even busy. This place is always understaffed, it takes forever to get initially greeted, 10+ minutes, has happened on multiple occasions. The server in training was nice this last visit, and that's the only reason I gave it two starts. Food is okay, the service kind of just ruins any good experiences."
Kristina B.,"Hollywood, FL",23,4,,1.0,11/12/2011,"We first tried this location after all of my co-workers raved about the place.  I was severely disappointed! Yes the ambiance is nice, and I'm sure the over abundance of televisions is cool when multiple games are on; however the service was BAD....it was like tag team serving!  The drinks, well they ran out of everything we wanted to try. Boo!  I asked for potato skins for an appetizer and the server stated that they were out, but i kept seeing these huge potatoes being served to other tables.  Hmmmmmmmm can we say they have frozen food!!!! I asked for the pulled pork, on a wheat bun, got it on a plain one.  My b/f ordered the ribs....and they were, as you've guessed from the other posts, cold and rock hard, didn't fall off the bone.  We complained! We gave it another shot for my sisters birthday, it was worse than the first time around.  More COLD FOOD!  The drinks came two at a time for a party of eight with 4-5 minute increments in between, saving the 5 year olds drink for last.  The server forgot my drink completely!  Appetizers were hot BAR FOOD!  Our meals were just a step above bar food. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME! I'd give 0 stars but our first meal was comped.  They keep this up, they will give away more food than they have people pay for."
Meli R.,"Hollywood, FL",17,13,5,5.0,1/16/2014,"I eat here at least once a week! I love this place. The staff is always friendly and the food- fresh and delicious! My favorite is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and Mediterranean Mini Pizza! I usually sit in the bar area/ because it's first come, first serve seating.  You can also do call ahead seating at BJ's, which is great. The menu has something for everyone. My favorite place to dine in Pembroke Pines HANDS DOWN !"
Ginny B.,"Hollywood, FL",42,25,9,5.0,8/31/2014,One word-pazookie! Try it you'll like it. My Mom and I went last night for dessert after seeing a show at our clubhouse. The trio of delicious cookies topped with ice cream was so scrumptious and 2 of them had a piece of Ghiaradelli chocolate as a garnish. Just right for each of us to devour. The manager there named Dennis was also adorable. He's eventually going to Fort Myers after his training time here in Pembroke Pines. We might have to take a trip there in the future. Fellow New Yorkers stick together down here it seems! So try the food but don't forget the pazookies for dessert. Leave some room! You won't be sorry. My favorite was the salted caramel!
Becky S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",2,10,,4.0,8/30/2014,"Love love love! Cream soda, deep dish pizza, white chocolate macadamia nut Pizookie! Favorite dinner of mine! The chicken fried steak is superb too! As a matter of fact- I've never had anything I didn't like. The kids menu is also good. Service is usually on point & the manager is on it too. My taste buds are asking for it now."
Tricia G.,"Miami, FL",183,109,148,4.0,10/23/2011,"When I found out that a BJ's restaurant was opening up in Pembroke Pines, I told everyone I knew that we HAD to go. We had dinner with our friends here recently, and the service, food and everything else was pretty much the same as the BJs we've been to in Southern Cali (check out my Yelp review of the BJ's in Southern Cali here:  ). The wait was about 45-50 minutes (which is totally expected for a Saturday night).  The Mister was excited that he can finally have his favorite root beer and a pizookie!  Our friends ordered sandwiches with fries (which they enjoyed), but their favorites were the avocado egg rolls (so good!) and the drinks (pumpkin ale and strawberry splash).  I ordered the Handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana (two chicken cutlets with a spicy marinara sauce), which was delicious, and the Mister ordered a regular bacon cheeseburger with fries (which was ok in his book). And of course, the pizookies were YUMMY!  White Chocolate, Triple Chocolate, Oreo, Red Velvet - can't wait to go back again!"
Vanessa M.,"Miami, FL",96,93,121,3.0,10/1/2011,"Finally! This is exactly the kind of place Pembroke Pines needed.  A gorgeous sports bar with a huge selection of beers. Honestly, I don't even feel like I'm in Pines when I'm in there and yes, that's a good thing.  The menu pretty much has every sports bar food item you can think of. I had a hard time choosing something to eat because there's just so  much to choose from. Thankfully, I went twice in one week and have tried a few solid dishes. For starters, the pizza's are highly overrated (in my opinion), but the veggie burger and parmesan crusted chicken are both wonderful. You must try the apple berry crumble. It is just heavenly!  I'm happy to welcome a place like BJ's to the suburbs. It's definitely my new go-to place for beers and good food when I'm feeling too lazy or tired to commute to Miami."
Adam I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",20,56,6,2.0,5/12/2014,"Was alright, nothing to write home about or reasons to really wanna come back. Service wasn't great or really bad. Doesn't have that crave factor! To each is own!"
Fumi T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",324,47,40,1.0,9/21/2011,"Not quite sure how to feel about this place. It was like a California Pizza Kitchen meets Pembroke Pine Ale House (interior appeal wise.) Granted that they just opened a day ago, something seemed to be off. Understandably, the staff/servers were under a watchful eye, with white shirt wearing supervisors roaming the entire floor like vultures...making things a little uneasy while dining. I almost felt like we were on an episode of Hell's Kitchen, the only thing missing was the comp'd meal.  One guy with us ordered a stout (not made in house of course) and it arrived with half foam. Rule of thumb is never send anything back, right? Yet, paying $7 for a stout for it to be poured incorrectly at a place that specializes in brews is not a good impression. We ordered a few small plates: mozarella/tomato salad, macaroni & cheese, and the stuffed mushrooms. They were having an off day to say the least. For this place to be a restaurant chain, and have over 100 locations, I don't think they were prepared for an opening as of yet."
Lisa C.,"Miramar, FL",1,5,,2.0,7/12/2014,The Service sucks. Our waitress Aubrey was dry as a bone and was not friendly. We asked her questions and she seems annoyed. She didn't explain anything or even ask if this was our first time at the restaurant. The food also was not that great either. The only good were the drinks. Don't think I will be coming back here.
Brent S.,"Hollywood, FL",57,191,455,4.0,3/14/2014,"Huge variety, they have everything form pizza, steak to pasta.  One of my favorite things are the mini appetizers.  It is nice to be able to order small portions to try more!  I am obsessed with the margarita flat bread, claim chowder and white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie.    You cant make a trip here and not try one of the pizookies.  Service is normally pretty prompt and food comes out pretty quick."
Shandi B.,"Davie, FL",70,218,133,3.0,9/25/2011,"I've been to BJ's in Southern California, so when I heard one was opening in PPines, I told my friends we had to go.   Friday night, 7:30pm... the wait was an hour plus.  Okay, but there were at least five tables open on the patio (which stayed open all night), so I was a bit tiffed that they weren't staffed to capacity. They do have call ahead seating, so we ended up eating dinner elsewhere, and calling ahead to get a table for brews and desserts.  Even calling ahead for a table was a mission, and I ended up talking to three different hostesses and taking a mini quiz (First and last name?  How many in your party?  Inside or outside?  Booth or table?  Any children?) before I was told to get there within the half hour to be seated in an hour.  Yeah, I was just as confused as you are. Fast forward to we got there by 9:30pm and were seated by 10:00pm (so yeah, call ahead).  We went to the bar to get a beer - they have eight brews plus one seasonal (Oktoberfest right now).  Besides the BJ's brews, they have about another 15-20 beers on tap, including Sea Dog Blueberry (yay!).  I wanted one of their own brews - my first thought was a hefeweizen, but it didn't pass my, ""are there any banana notes in this?"" question (ewww).  I was recommended the Jeremiah Red, and after a free sample, I was sold.  So, the beers are good.  The couple of things we ordered (my friends got a small mac n' cheese and fried artichoke hearts) were good - especially the hearts, not greasy, tasted fresh (not canned) and garlicy! om nom nom. Of course, if you ever find that you can only order one thing at BJ's you must get the PIZOOKIES (those would be PIZZA COOKIES!).  We got a trio of chocolate chunk (yes), red velvet (too sweet) and Oreo (magic). Our waiter was nice enough, but not really attentive.  This was their opening weekend, so I'm looking forward to going back and actually getting a pizza. Side note - stay away from the Berry Burst Cider - unless you enjoy the taste of Dimetapp."
Gingit K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,13,2.0,9/12/2014,"On a fairly not busy evening we went over for dinner. Service was extremely slow, our water glasses stayed empty for much of the night until we asked another server (not ours, he took our orders and disappeared) for water. When our salads arrived they looked old. I called them ""used"". Like they combined salads from other guests leftovers. When asked if everything is OK I said NO. A manager arrived, listened, said he will be right back with someone who can help us.... and was gone. We paid our bill and left a $2 tip, to make sure they know we didn't forget. We simply hated the service, and will never come back to this restaurant.  We have been to the BJ in Daytona, FL before and loved it, but we live in SoFlo.  In the future i will read more reviews here. Looks like we are not the only ones who got terrible service there."
Heather S.,"Cooper City, FL",51,17,4,5.0,5/1/2014,The food and service is always great here. This is definitely my go-to restaurant. I love the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The mashed potatoes are awesome. My boyfriend always orders double mash. I never have to wait to be seated here either. They also have convenient options like paying for your meal from your phone.
Grisel L.,"Miami Lakes, FL",103,116,3,1.0,12/29/2013,Now I remember why I don't come here that often...the service SUX!!! 25 mins and still waiting for our drinks after reminding the server..
Jan N.,"Miami, FL",340,241,94,3.0,5/29/2012,"Giving it 3 stars because the first time I came here, it was fabulous, but the second time was ""eh.""  They have a huge selection of foods a la Cheesecake Factory style (but not as good!), and a variety of beers. The crowd was a mix - families, people on dates, and groups.  One of the times I came here was for a game, and it was packed!  Lots of big screen TVs by the bar, but not really sprinkled throughout the restaurant.  That's one negative.   I would honestly have to visit this location again to give a good account of what to expect.  I can't seem to pinpoint the details.  But I still do recommend it.  You'll find something since the menu is so expansive!  The beer is good - I had one of their reds (love ambers!)  from San Francisco both times I visited, and I remember being happy with the choice."
Keith S.,"Rochester, NY",2,5,31,2.0,7/21/2014,"Service was very poor and food was mediocre at best. We ordered salads and never received them, had server to remove them from the bill."
Stephanie M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,4.0,7/13/2014,Great place with lots of variety. A friend took me here for lunch and the food was great and reasonably priced. They have an extensive menu with something for everyone though I highly recommend the corn fritters as an appetizer and the chicken pita tacos if you're looking for a lighter entrée. The service at this location was also awesome. I will be back for sure.
