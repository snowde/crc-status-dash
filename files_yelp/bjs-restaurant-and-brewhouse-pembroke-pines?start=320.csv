Joe P.,"Hialeah, FL",10,81,51,3.0,1/11/2015,"The place is huge, but not good to watch games as others suggest. There isn't lot of tvS I think I must of Seen like 6-8. The beer selection is incredible, along with their extensive menu of appetizers and entrees. However, the food is average. I tried the wings and the deep dish pizza. all I can say is they got nothing on ale house wings. Pizza sucked! Cheesey pizza, no sauce just cubed tomatoes thrown in the mix. Dough tasted bland, and ingredients too; had no flavor. All in all I wasn't impressed to come back here."
Melli B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",124,285,457,3.0,4/26/2012,"So many beers! I really like this place. Great place to gather with friends to watch a Heat game, have a brew or two...or five and some decent food. The menu is great with lots of choices for everyone. Deep dish pizza, sandwiches, salads, and many different entree types! I have tried the pizza which was nice and thick! The shrimp tacos are good too. The Skinny Margarita was really nice! The environment is cool with a HUGE screen tv at the bar and more tv's thruout! The bartender that days was Allison! Really sweet, knowledgable of the menu, and efficient! I offer 3 stars because although the menu is better than most bar menu's, the food is decent but nothing to get excited about. But I will definitely go back. The menu is satifying and extensive! The environment is great!"
Hoilda B.,"Hialeah, FL",56,102,126,4.0,2/23/2012,"We always go to BJ's in Orlando Fl and we love that place. I was so happy to see one open in Pembroke Pines, Fl . The food is  great and the portions are a good size. Love how the place is decorated and the bar is huge. I must say that the different between the Orlando location and Pembroke Pines is the waiting time, they told me 10 minutes and and it turn out to be 35 minutes.   Overall the food is great and inexpensive."
John L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",21,410,,4.0,3/19/2014,I love wedge salads and they've got a great one. I love tomato bisque and they have a great one. Someday I'll expand my horizons beyond wedge salad and tomato bisque here but for now it is at least a4
Felicia R.,"Hollywood, FL",155,306,241,4.0,4/6/2012,"Love BJ's Brewhouse, the Jeremiah Red beer is awesome, the avocado egg rolls, the Tortilla soup and pizza are my favorite picks. I recently shared the basil tomato flat-bread and it was very good. Great place for large groups, the kids. on weekends the wait is pretty long, they do allow for your to call a few minutes ahead to put your name on the list."
Gary F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,10,,1.0,7/31/2015,"Nice looking establishment advertising specialty burgers,appetizing photography.... And then after a ridiculous wait and absent waiter , the runner or dishwasher brought out the food. My "" medium"" burger showed up extra well done. It had obviously been stuck to the flat top as it was broken, burnt and delivered on a very stale bun. The manager explained it had cracked when "" scraped"" off the grill. Even the lettuce and tomato looked like refugees from a bad salad bar. They kept offering desert as a consolation instead of redoing the burger. After some effort the manager agreed to remove the price of the burger, no apology for wasting the time. The owners must take pride as their names are on a brass plaque. I wonder if they know they've hired the village idiot as an expediter. Any one who cared would never have let that off the line. I'm guessing the other idiot must be the chef. For a $12.00 burger they should at least look at their offerings. I recently spoke with Scott the manager who had taken time to speak with me regarding this posting. Many people reply because it looks better on line. Scott was genuinely concerned about my experience. I'm hoping he can resolve the internal issues,I think if he'd seen the product it never would have made it to my table. Thanks Scott, best of luck"
Macielle B.,"Hialeah, FL",166,97,33,4.0,4/2/2012,"BJ""S! I love BJ's so much!  Their soups are so good especially the Tortilla soup which they pour in front of you, has a bit of a kick. My favorite of their Chicken Alfredo Pasta its so delicious and creamy.  The bread that accompanies it is so soft . I absolutely love their 1800 skinny margaritas. All that taste for half the calories!  It can get very busy and waiting for a table on the weekends is a serious pain but good thing is that the bar is always open so you can grab a drink while you wait. The service here is really good, I've never had a problem with the staff, everyone is usually very friendly and patient. If you are undecided on what to try they will make suggestions for you.  For your first time I recommend trying one of their deep dish pizza's, they're a real treat. If you don't drink they make their own colas, the black cherry is my favorite. And I've never had their home brewed beers but my friends swear by them. Happy Eating."
Denise G.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",8,35,72,5.0,7/20/2013,"We were going to go to the Cheesecake factory but my daughter suggested this restaurant. I am so glad we tried it! I have passed by this a bunch of times, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! The drinks are amazing.  We had water melon and strawberry mojitos and an Island Sunset they were awesome! For apps we had the Ahi Poke, it was great! We also had both Thai shrimp wraps and also chicken lettuce wraps.Yum on both of those too! I had shrimp tacos my daughter had rib eye steak, husband had shrimp scampi and other daughter had balsamic glazed chicken, Every thing was amazing. We cant wait to go back and try the flat bread and pizzas which  looked so good. We also had their signature dessert called Pizookie, which is any kind of home made cookie with ice cream on top, we tried three in the trio. peanut butter, red velvet and white chocolate macadamia, wow!  A first time hit in Pembroke Pines, perfect!"
Steven D.,"Fort Meade, MD",5,327,10,5.0,6/9/2014,If you are in the area and looking to enjoy great food.  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is the perfect family restaurant.
A F.,"Davie, FL",0,8,,3.0,7/20/2015,"Are here this past Saturday, we Got seated right Away which was good. It took about 8 minutes just for the waiter to come to us. Ordered our drinks from the bar took another 8 minutes to just get them. The restaurant was packed so they need more runners and servers. Our food was great even though it took forever to come out. After we finished eating we ordered another round of drinks and our waiter totally forgot about them. We reminded him and he acted like they should of got served. He went to the bar and he could only bring the hard alcohol drinks because he said there was something wrong with the beer. So overall we loved the food and atmosphere but they need to step it up with service!"
John C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/16/2015,"My wife and I went in to sample the ""happy hour"". The food is all right, but drink deals are a minimum. After I received the check I noticed inconsistency in what I ordered and what I was charged for. I was charged for more expensive items, and then given their great happy hour discount which brought it to normal price. I would not recommend this restaurant, but if you choose to go, monitor your check closely."
Mark E.,"South Elgin, IL",66,65,7,4.0,9/10/2013,"Great food and service, fairly prices. Love going to BJ's for their craft beers and delicious food. Their pizza's are great, as are their burgers"
Cann I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,8,,1.0,12/5/2014,"I was there twice today...my first and last time.  Service was poor, dishes dirty and food just adequate. The place was almost empty yet we waited a ridiculous amount of time to get drink refills. The music was loud.  All in all not a fun lunch experience."
Mike R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,,2.0,10/8/2011,Not so good experience. Floor was slippery and was told a lady fell flat on her face earlier in the day. I don't think the staff received proper training on the beer and food selection.  I received my beer above 42 degrees and was expecting lager to be served at a brewery between 36 and 39 degrees. I ordered a burger and wasn't asked how i wanted it cooked and sure enough it was way overcooked. I had the option to order potato wedges or thin cut fries - I ordered the thin cut fries an received the wedges. I told the waitress and she offered to bring me a aide of fries and never got it. On a positive side the place is nicely decorated and plasma TV's everywhere. This is a good place to sit at the bar and order appetizers. I will wait 6 months before going back and by then they should have experience and know their food and beer.
Anthony K.,"Cincinnati, OH",37,72,4,4.0,11/4/2011,"When I heard that there was a BJ's Brewhouse open in South Florida, I instantly changed my flight path from home to the brew house. .....yes really.... jumping over 3 lanes on the turnpike to get here sooner kind of giddy. Coming from Southern California, there's BJ's all over and they are famous for their Great American Beer Festival multi-award winning beers, huge deep dish pizza, humungoid potatoes, and the infamous pazookie.  Lo and behold the pazookie in all of it's delicious glory !! (Ominous Music goes here) - What is a pazookie you may ask ?  It is a delicious, fresh baked cookie brought out in a pizza tin. Then you put ice cream on top and toppings, whip cream, and you have a pizza / cookie = Pazookie.  If for any reason, this is a reason to go. But then there's the beer as well, and the food, and the beer, and more pages of food :)   Seriously, there's something for everyone here. The servers here were great, the seats were comfy, the space was large / warm and inviting. It felt like being back in California.       The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that they don't brew their beer on site here anymore. My waitress stated it was too costly, in which I don't believe so. They have since started bringing their beer in from Texas, and with all the transportation costs, I'd be glad to brew on site here for free. Free brewery help if needed guys...just saying...I can shovel spent grain like the dickens !! Until I get hired here, I'll continue to come in for pazookies, pizza, beer, egg rolls, wings, the list continues...."
Carol S.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,13,,2.0,7/20/2014,"Food was ok but the service was very poor. We were never offered water with our drinks. We ordered salads before our meal that never were delivered, we barely saw our server and only until I had finished my entree as the waiter was taking the plate away, did he ask me if it was good. I'll think twice before going back to this location."
Jermaine G.,"Hollywood, FL",44,32,3,4.0,10/23/2011,"Wanted to try something new and remember receiving an email telling me about a new brewery right off of Pines Blvd.  Arrived around 10pm and the place was very busy, but not busy to the point where we weren't acknowledged upon entry, they're large flat screens throughout the restaurant (the World Series and a few college football games were on) so wherever we were seated you could see the game(s)  We were taken to our seat after a very short wait (about 5 minutes) our waitress; Anita was amazing, she provided great food suggestions and also educated us on the various types of beer since none of the people in my party are avid beer drinkers. She provided us with a variety sampler of 4 types of beer (about 6 ounces each) Try the spring rolls they were top notch, very light and full of flavor. The Jambalaya was great and the cajun tilapia tasted very fresh and flavorful. For dessert (which we were eyeing before everything else) we had the BJ Beneigt......SUPERB! Will definitely visit BJ's again"
Robert P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",6,5,16,3.0,10/23/2011,"We called ahead at which time we were given a 45 minute wait time. Arriving 35 minutes later we were asked to wait 25 more minutes, so much for call ahead sitting. 50 minutes later we were still waiting to be sitted.  The appetizer arrive slowly and cold to the table and most of the meals were luke warm if not cold. Plus the second round of drinks had to be requested twice. I am attributing the delay in service to being understaffed.  We tried several types of beer all with distinct flavors, including their Pumpkin and Harvest seasonal beer, all repeaters.  The Chicken Fried Steak, Cajun Pasta and Jambalaya were delicious and definitely worth going back for.  The staff was apologetic for the delay and temperatur of the food and compensated by providing yet another dish of Jambalaya to bring home and eat later at another time.  We give a three star because time and service is huge part of the dinning experience (we like our food flaming hot) especially since temperature affects the flavor. Plus  we where not asked if we wanted a second plate of food. We would have rather they offer to heat the plate I had or compensate in another manner such as free drink, comp the cost of the dish and or a free dessert.  The consensus: the food was delicious, we are willing to return and give it another try. Hopefully on a not so busy night."
Raymond M.,"Hollywood, FL",52,41,28,3.0,2/16/2012,"I have eaten here a couple of time already, and we know that during the weekends forget about getting a table with less that a 45 minute wait.  It is just packed to the rafters.  But when you come during the week, sans Friday and the weekend, you will find a table quickly.  My wife and I are wishing the best for this restaurant, but I have to admit that after 4 times each time there was an issue of some sort with the food.  On the first week that it opened my wife ""pork chops"" were very under cooked as you got closer to the bone, we brought it up to the attention of the manager and we hoped that it was corrected.  So we waited for couple of weeks allowing for the restaurant to adjust a bit to the menu and we came back  and low and behold when was enjoying my Chicken Marsala I started to notice that the taste was changing and found out that my chicken was under cooked showed it to the waiter and the manager came around and made the apologies and explained to him to have the cook to take his time in cooking the chicken.  Now we come to last night (2/15/2012) and we held out breath giving it another chance.  We love to explore with new items and we ordered the Meatballs (fantastic), the ""Chicken Wantons"" (excellent especially good with the white and read sauces that came with it) , and the Mozzarella and tomato balsamic salad was cold and crispy.  The disappointment, the Mac and cheese, had to send it back twice since it was Mac and cheese soup.  They were telling us that it has to set up, understandable, but when you make the sauce and take it off the stove and you let it set, and when it sets it sticks to the macaroni when it cools down a bit and not swim it it.  We again brought it up to the Manager's attention and he recognized us from the other times that we came to dine there. The beer is great especially the Jeremiah Red and the building and the restaurant space is nice, but they have to spend more money to attract a better chef that will take his or her time and making sure that the meals come out right, and is not in a rush to get the orders out fast.   I guarantee that if the food is good and comes out well paced (not bring out the starters with the dinner or, ""ish"", warm salad).  Take the time to provide good service and food then the people will be glad to wait for a table. Will we come back, maybe.  How long dos BJ's have to brew to get it right with the food and service?  We just don't know, a year, two years, three years?"
Sara M.,"Washington, DC",513,357,36,2.0,1/28/2013,"I wavered between 2 and 3 stars on this one, I just didn't think BJ's was a good as I thought it would be. I don't know if my expectations were too high or perhaps they were just having an off night, not sure.   I came here for dinner with my family on Sunday night where we called ahead since they don't take reservations. When we got there around 7:30pm, we still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table and it seemed the regular wait time was about double that. Fine, no big.  After we were seated, it took about 5 minutes for our waitress to make it to our table for drink orders. I was very tempted by their drink menu. Not only do they have some really good looking beers which they brew themselves (hence the name BJ's Brewhouse) but they also had layered beers and ciders which were calling my name, not to mention house made sodas. Alas, I stuck with water, but my brother in law ordered a beer and my sister ordered the creme soda, so at least I would get to sample.  My brother in law's beer came out first, delivered by a different waiter, and then the rest of the drinks took about 10 minutes to make it to the table which is way too long.  When it came to placing my order there was a bunch of items on the menu that looked good to me. They just about cover the board with their options, from salads to burgers to sandwiches, and their specialty- pizza. Prices are mid range, about $14 for a salad, $11ish for sandwiches, etc. I settled on the crispy chicken sandwich which comes with either thin cut fries or potato wedges, I got the wedges. My mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich and then was told that they were out which was a bummer for her since that is one of her faves. I really have to question when a restaurant of this size runs out of something. Maybe they couldn't handle the extra demand that stemmed from the Chili Cookoff which was that day, but again, management should have planned better for it.  Anyhow, after orders were placed and drinks were delivered, we waited about 20 minutes when our waitress came by and asked us how everything was. We all kind of stared at her with blank faces.. ""uuum, the water is good..?"" We had yet to see our food and wouldn't for about another 15 minutes. I've had worse wait times for food, but 35 minutes is too long for this kind of place. My mom's food came out first, she subbed the pulled port for a brisket sandwich, which apparently didn't come with any sides. No one else's food came out for a good 5 minutes following which is one of my personal taboos.  My crispy chicken sandwich was just okay. It was not a chicken breast like I was expecting, but rather two sandwiches, each which had a chicken finger in the middle. It was okay, but somewhat dry. The wedges were good though, not as good as the magicalness of KFC potato wedges, but tasty. On top of my mom's food coming out before anyone else's, there were a few other small mishaps: When I ordered my sandwich, I asked to replace the honeymustard with ranch, which was not there when my food was delivered. Also, my sister ordered the thin cut fries with her meal and received wedges instead. The veggies on my mom's plate were raw- raw onions, carrots and celery. really? raw onion? My sister really enjoyed her chili burger which was HUGE and my brother in law said his spicy meatball pizza was good but very very spicy. I also sipped my sister's creme soda, orange/creme soda and the black cherry. The orange was a bit strange and we all agreed it left a funny taste in our mouths. The black cherry and creme soda were both really good.  If the food here was better, I would have probably given them 3 stars. Yes, the service stunk and was slow, but it could have just been our waitress and the rest of the team could be stellar, who knows? The best chance of me coming back to this place would be to sit at the (fully stocked) bar and grab a drink, but I don't think I'll be revisiting for the food."
