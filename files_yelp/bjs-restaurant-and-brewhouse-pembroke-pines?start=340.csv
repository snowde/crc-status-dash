Ed D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",46,17,26,4.0,2/10/2014,Great spot.  Me and my girl went there and had a great diner.  Draft Beers were on special!  Service was friendly.
Christine M.,"Hollywood, FL",16,20,,4.0,4/13/2014,"This place is great! You need to get there before the rush or there will be a wait. We normally get the Mediterranean Pizza with no chicken. Love it. Appetizer is usually the avocado rolls, and again good food!!"
Colleen C.,"Portland, OR",155,259,3,4.0,11/13/2011,"Holy.  Crap.  If you are going to come here, use the call ahead service, or else you are going to be waiting for a long time.  The first time I came here (Friday night), the wait was about an hour and a half.  The second time we came, we had reservations and went right in within a minute or two.  The hostess was very nice and surprisingly calm for the insane amount of people in the restaurant. Our waitress was awesome, very friendly and down to earth.  Her beer recommendations were right on point, and my boyfriend and I both tried one of the beers they brew themselves.  Mine (a Nutty Brewnette) was fantastic, and highly recommended.  His was good as well, but not quite my style --- there's something for everyone though, if you like beer, as well as a full bar. Our entrees were served surprisingly quickly, given how packed the place was, and the service was outstanding.  Our waitress checked up on us about four times during the course of our meal, and we were never at a lack for anything we needed.  The portions are very big, and I definitely recommend the grilled chicken pasta (perfect with the Nutty Brewnette!).  I'd definitely like to come back and try other items on their huge menu... especially this pazookie I've been hearing so much about."
Finding Q.,"Hollywood, FL",0,28,,3.0,4/9/2015,"I like the bar area.  Cool for happy hour. Worth visiting,  but somehow never remember its there until I drive by it!"
Robert G.,"Miramar, FL",1,15,8,5.0,5/15/2015,I have been here many times and they always do a good job. The food is good and they have a lot of menu choices.  They also have a number of very good lower calorie healthier choices.  I find that the wait time to be seated can be long so one should always use the call ahead service to put your name on the wait list.
Richard M.,"Broward, FL",0,14,,1.0,7/6/2013,"What to say, terrible service worse food, dirty floors and bathrooms. If this is a chain corporate need to step in, if its a franchise I'm glad my money is not tied up in it.  I can not state how poor this place is. I don't leave bad reviews based on being upset about one or two things as many seem to. This is not personal or due to a grudge but I seriously advise anyone thinking to try this place to go somewhere else as I and the 8 others who were with me will do from now on."
Akta N.,"Chicago, IL",83,91,11,2.0,12/19/2012,"I've been here 3 times now and it's gotten worse. We tend to go here after I get in town which is a Friday and around 11 pm. It seems to be one of the only places open and still serving food.  However, the waiter service is terrible.  The first two times the waiters forgot about us, this time really took the cake.  We were seated in a 6 person booth - there was only two of us.  No one came to greet us for about 5-10 minute even though we were seating right next to the waitress station and they all looked at us.  It took my boyfriend telling a waitress then her trying to find someone until we finally got water.  The service was slow and very terse. I know that they were getting ready to close up but there were quite a few people including a large party still there.   The food was mediocre.  I ordered the nachos and most of the cheese wasn't even melted.  The beer was OK. The reason this place gets two stars is because I've had food from there before and it was been OK and the fries are good.  We've decided to never go here again, even if i get in town late.  We'd rather just cook food ourselves."
Andrea J.,"Hollywood, FL",9,2,,1.0,8/3/2013,"My boyfriend and I along with his sister tried this place for the first time and were quite disappointed.  Although we were seated fairly quickly, the service was very slow and subpar. The orders were taken quickly and then our waitress disappeared for almost 30 minutes. I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita that tasted like it was leftover from the night before. I sent it back and ordered another strawberry drink that was better. My boyfriend ordered a watermelon mojito and wasn't satified with it. I ordered chicken fettuchine alfredo; my pasta was under cooked and my chicken was dry. My boyfriend ordered the half chicken with a half a rack of ribs; the ribs were hard and the chicken was under cooked. His sister ordered seafood alfredo and her pasta was also under cooked. Overall the service could have been much quicker and the food should have been better for a 72 dollar meal."
Chris P.,"Hollywood, FL",0,36,,3.0,12/29/2014,"The best thing about this restaurant, other than the extensive beer menu, is the cookie dessert... the pizookie? So good! The food menu is large, but the food is not great. That's just my opinion... and I've tried a variety of entrees, etc."
Maite H.,"Miami Lakes, FL",60,132,20,2.0,11/22/2012,"I am beyond over BJ's Brewhouse.  It took 3 times of poor service for me to decide that I will opt for other eateries.  We placed an online order and went to pick it up at the scheduled time.  Upon arriving we were told the order was done incorrectly.  They never explained what in fact was wrong with it.  We waited and waited and waited.  The manager came out and apologized and said it would be out shortly and that we'd get a complimentary pzookie.  The restaurant was not very busy and yet we continued to wait.  It was 45 min later when they brought out our order.  Pzookie was no where to be seen we had to remind them and wait yet some more for it to come out.  The manager disappeared and was never seen again through all our waiting...convenient!  When we got home...the sandwich we paid extra to add cheese to had no cheese...the sandwich that said no tomato on the actual label of the container still had tomatoes.  Our lunch order consisted of 2 sandwiches, a salad, and 2 soups.  We wait 45 minutes to get the food done as stated on the menu clearly ignoring the instructions we selected on their drop down menu.  I'm so angry at this place.   The last 2 visits to dine in have been equally as pathetic.  It is a complete shame  because the food is enjoyable."
Joshua A.,"Hialeah, FL",4,8,2,4.0,1/5/2014,"Started at the bar, the drinks were made right and even though the bar was full for an NFL playoff game we got good, quick service.  Afterwards we moved to a table, where the service was not as great. Everything took too long, from waters to the food.  One meal was forgotten and when the waitress was notified it took another 10 or so minutes.  Similarly for dessert one of the orders came out wrong.  The waitress was very nice but something was going on in either the kitchen or with her order taking.  The food itself was good, fish and chips, ribs and chicken limone pasta were all delicious, and fresh.  Between the food and bar service, it earned the four, but the speed and accuracy of service could've dropped this down to a 2 or 3."
Arly J.,"Hollywood, FL",25,256,263,4.0,9/27/2011,"Went opening day around five and greeted by six people and as we continued to walk  in had never seen so much staff. Our waitress  was overly attentive I would be too if I had someone constantly checking on me as everyone had a trainer with them.  Menu  is huge and we ordered appetizers we loved the mushroom with spinach and avocado egg rolls. We could pass on the calamari.  My husband loved the jambalaya so much that on our second visit he ordered it again. We went with friends the second visit and decided to try the pizzas. we ordered two different ones vegetarian and BBQ chicken both were amazing!!! We also love the Mac and cheese appetizer. By far the Pizookie is delicious and we had the trio ( chocolate, macadamia and choc chunk) The cream soda is delicious a must try. We also enjoyed the octoberfest beer. Great place to enjoy a beer and relax."
Chas L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",20,45,20,4.0,9/25/2013,"What got my attention with this place was that is a Brewhouse. My husband is really into his beer. Me, not so much. :P  He can taste the flavors, all i taste is beer. So i wanted to come here and have a bit to eat and have him sample some of their in house made beers. It was pretty busy, so we had to wait, but not too long. I got myself a fruity mixed drink, while hubby had a beer, that he LOVED.  I love the small appetizers. I tend to get full off appetizers before my meal comes, but this portion prevents that lol.  I had the french dip, honey had a burger. Both were tasty. One thing i wasn't happy with was the fries. They came out really cold. I didn't bother asking for more. I was hoping they would have sweet potato fries, but no suck luck. The second time we went we shared one of their deep dish pizzas, oh my yum!"
Natasha D.,"Miami, FL",107,283,29,3.0,6/22/2013,"Came in at around 8:00 on a Saturday night, was not overwhelmingly busy. There is a bar area with high top tables and booths where you can seat yourself (if there's availability) so we decided to do that instead of the 25-30 minute wait for two. Our server did a good job explaining the concept of the restaurant and the different beers they are known for. The menu is EXTENSIVE and everything is reasonably priced so it took a while to make a decision. I settled on the deep dish pizza and the Mr. got the pot roast. We also got a root beer which is apparently made there... And is freaking awesome, and much to our surprise had free refills. My pizza was good, reminded me of the personal pan pizzas at Pizza Hut. For more than half the price I will probably not order it from here again but am sufficiently intrigued to return and try something else. Agree with another review that it came out lukewarm. The pot roast meat was tender and the gravy had a robust flavor. Mashed potatoes were pretty good, dense because of the white cheddar. Also on the plate appeared to be raw celery, carrots and a quarter of an onion which I would expect to have been cooked WITH the roast so a little bizarre that they're there raw on the plate. Overall service was good, drinks refilled in a timely manner and just the right amount of checking in. I will definitely return. Cool atmosphere, fun music (cheesy 80s, Depeche Mode and Tears for Fears in the hour we were there) mixed in with modern stuff. Good place to take a group that can't decide on cuisine since there's so many varied options."
J M.,"Houston, TX",1,22,4,2.0,9/11/2013,"The food at BJ's was what we expected it to be.  Good, but not great.  We had the vegetarian pizza, the poke, and shrimp lettuce wraps.  Topped off with a pizookie. The one big gaping hole was the service.  We had a waiter named ""Joseph"" and he was HORRIBLE!!  Seemed friendly, but got a whole bunch of stuff wrong on our order, and it took almost 20 minutes to get our bill after we asked for it, and another 10 just to pay it.   Seemed like a management problem in that all of the staff were not really out there to provide good customer service.  All of the waitstaff were busier gossiping amongst themselves than to help the customers.  I""ll be back, but to another BJ's."
Monica R.,"Hollywood, FL",21,5,,2.0,12/14/2011,"Mac and Cheese is amazing!!  The wait time was a bit long, but our server Charlie was very gracious about it.  I recomend the Brewhouse Blonde Shrimp as well. Love the small appitizer menu, let's you sample so much with out a large bill!"
Alana L.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,3/21/2014,Poor attention. The food is not bad but the personnel makes you feel like you are bothering them. Disappointing.
Victor N.,"Miami, FL",2,5,,5.0,1/31/2014,The food was great I would def recommend for just about anybody.  This is a place where its suits anybody and has a lot of a variety in their menu.  Def will be coming here more often.
Jennifer Z.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",11,4,1,2.0,1/21/2015,"Not the greatest place to go. We sat outside but the place was not full at all.  Dinner lasted over 2 hours because the servers kept changing and we had to wait forever to get anything. Everything had to go through several hands (waitress to kitchen to other server to another server)  before we got anything, even a simple water took 15 minutes to get. Three other tables around us complained to the manager. food was okay but not great not a lot and it was not cheap. i guess it could be nice to watch a game and get a drink but thats about it."
Shinelle A.,"Hollywood, FL",16,5,1,3.0,2/1/2013,"Service was horrible today, the server was not engaged to her customers and truly could have done without her attitude. I ordered the Mahi, it was ok, nothing too special. In the past I have had great dishes and experience here, unfortunately today was not one of those days."
