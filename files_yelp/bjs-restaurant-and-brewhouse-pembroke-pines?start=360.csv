Missy E.,"Hialeah, FL",3,1,23,5.0,10/27/2011,"Outstanding food and service. The beer selection in extensive and the house beer is only $3 during lunch time. I'll defiantly be going back for seconds and thirds. Try the chicken parm ....... It's pretty serious. The price for the food is decent. I will say though unless you go for lunch and order house beer, the regular beer prices are a bit high."
Maite R.,"Miami Lakes, FL",237,39,,3.0,6/14/2013,"I like the decor and the concept, and for very few you can sample their beers.  I have only been once, so I would be willing to give it another chance.  Their pizzas look good.  I had a chicken dish that TASTED good, but was really dry (balsamic), although I did like the potatoes it came with a lot. The chicken lettuce wraps?  Tasted good, but if we got a whole head of lettuce and a spoonful of the chicken.  I just thought it was ok.  Nothing that offends me, but nothing I would go out of my way for."
Pat D.,"Toronto, Canada",3,3,,4.0,1/4/2014,"The best Chicken Tortilla soup I have ever tasted. The way it is served tableside is rather unique. A bowl with the ingredients that are usually sprinkled on top of the soup and allowed to soak up the soup getting soggy in the process are the sole inhabitants of the bowl. The server the pours the soup from a gravy boat into the bowl and it doesn't get any fresher or taste any better. Our waitress was a gem, she helped us through the drink and food menu made very tasty suggestions and informed us that if you call 30 minutes ahead you can almost always avoid the wait. Her name is Julie be sure to ask for her by name when you call ahead and your experience will be pleasantly memorable."
Elana M.,"Hollywood, FL",321,156,81,2.0,4/8/2014,"That was one hell of a frustrating lunch! I met my friend at BJ's at exactly 12:30 pm, She was on her lunch break which lasts an hour. To cut to the chase, after shoving the food down her throat after it finally arrived, she busted out the door at exactly 1:30 pm, leaving me waiting for boxes for our leftovers and to pay the bill. During our entire visit, our server (Loyda) was never around. She would yap with the table behind us for 10 minutes and then breeze by us without a word. This happened throughout the entire meal. It was just so annoying! Anyway...after my friend left to go back to work, I sat there for another 25 minutes until she finally came by to see if I wanted anything else. I told her to please bring me boxes and the check. Again...more waiting. Finally I get the bill, put my card in, and she attempts to walk on by me again without taking it. I stopped her and told her to please process my check so I could leave. Finally I am out the door a little after 2:00 pm. The food was good. No complaints in that department, but that is irrelevant to me, because I would never, ever go back."
Barry E.,"Hollywood, FL",1,49,,4.0,9/25/2013,We have been to BJ's restaurant several times and the food is always very good and the service is as well. We have always gotten very good professional service at lunchtime from Stacy. They have a large menu.My wife needs to be gluten-free's and they have a very extensive menu of gluten-free items including pizza. The hamburgers are very tasty.
Mike W.,"Miramar, FL",0,6,,1.0,12/27/2012,"I've given this place plenty of chances because the food and beer are quite good. The problem is the service is atrocious. Most of the servers I've had have been incompetent, and the one manager I've talked to was rude and condescending. After last night's attempt at dinner, I give up. I definitely won't be going back."
Conway W.,"New York, NY",24,5,4,1.0,6/17/2014,"It's my first time here. After we sat down our waitress took 20 mins to attend to us. After we got our drinks, it took our waitress another 20 mins to come back for our order but when asked if we could get service, the waitresses responded with ""I will come back after I'm done doing a few things I really need to attend to,"" which is thought was very rude. After my table ordered our food, We probably waited for another 30 mins before we got it because they made a mistake with one of our dishes and had to remake it from scratch. When the food came out, one of my dishes wasn't put in to order, however I declined and had it removed from the bill because it would prolly take another hour to come out. After that we got our checks and it was all wrong, after 10 it's half off appetizers and had to return the checks and wait another 10 mins. In all my crew and I spent over 1hr 20mins waiting at this restaurant for food that wasn't great in my opinion."
Inthiaz S.,"Hollywood, FL",161,143,18,3.0,5/30/2012,"sooo i have been this new spot and everytime i go i like   first i was skeptical,thought grrreat another sportsbar but to my surprise it is good. only complaint is a little expensive,even though the food is not bad.yeah so i recommend it.."
Karen M.,"Miami, FL",3,3,,5.0,6/7/2013,Awesome food! The pizza is great! The calamari mixture seafood appetizer is also good!
Daniel B. O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,296,36,4.0,6/28/2014,Nice place to go! Their deep dish pizza and burgers are good. They have a large selection of beers including their own. I would say their best beers are the Jeremiah Red and the Hopster IPA. Can't go wrong with a Deep Dish Pizza and an IPA. This llace gets busy so arrive early!
Katrina B.,"Hollywood, FL",211,77,132,4.0,2/14/2013,Great atmosphere went after work very relaxing nice vibe. Will definitely recommend to all my family and friends.
Chip R.,"Weston, FL",206,65,30,4.0,2/1/2013,Do call ahead seating. Puts you at the top of the list!  Deep dish pizza is excellent.
Alejandra S.,"Miami Beach, FL",113,56,47,5.0,3/31/2013,Perfect meal. The best tomato soup ever. Like liquid pizza! The pizza was great and the Oreo pizzookie is a must!!!!
Lisa D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",51,31,7,2.0,5/22/2012,"I have been to BJs in Vegas many times and always had a good experience. However this one, not so good.  Our waiter,  Ben, was nice but ooh so slow. I asked him if he would recommend the pot roast sandwich. He told me is was his ""favorite"". I said I was torn between than and my old stand-by, French dip. He advised to go with the pot roast, so I did. The roast itself was tasty but so small compared to the huge mound of mashed potato. But what really was horrible were the veggies. The carrots, celery and onion were raw. I only know this after eating the onion. It was so strong that it left my pallet unable to taste anything else.  When I brought this to his attention he offered to get me the French dip and said he'd have it out I'm less than 5 minutes. 20 minutes later, still no sandwich and my husband and 3 year old have long finished theirs. I asked Ben to have it wrapped to go. Another 10 minutes later it arrived. I did eat it later that afternoon for dinner but reheated sandwiches are not my fave.  Another issue was my sons Mac and cheese. It looked old. I realize it is kraft but it looks like it came from a huge bin in the fridge and thrown into the Microwave. He's 3, he didn't seem to mind."
Idy S.,"North Miami Beach, FL",42,16,2,2.0,4/21/2013,"The best thing about this place is definitely the alcohol...pomegranate martini was sweet and strong. My friend had some beer that he says is hard to find but excellent lol the calamari was good but the rest of the food was your typical frozen re-heated chain food. Service wasn't bad but our party of 10 had to wait an hour to be seated. At 5 p.m. that wait seemed ridiculous especially on a rainy night when the place was kind of empty. Would go back for happy hour, nothing more."
Jennifer P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,9,2,4.0,8/17/2012,"Friday night so there was an hour wait. But we managed to get seats at the bar, where we ate.  They have a big menu.  I had the mahi mahi.  It taste good and on the less calorie meals. But cheated and had the dessert.  OMG the pizziones was delicious.  My husband had the californa burger which was tasty and the wedge frys were great.  They also make their own beer which was good. Good hang out environment. Nice decor. I will go again and bring some friends"
R B.,"Tallahassee, FL",534,18,,5.0,8/13/2013,One of the few places in town that I have yet to have a bad experience. A large and varied menu with a unique dessert that you simply cannot leave without.
Tracie F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,10,4,3.0,7/27/2013,Food is delicious! Service sucks! Been here 3 times and all 3 times the service has been shall we say lousy! Will go back because the food is good. But if you decide to try this place pack your patience because the service leaves a little to be desired!
Vane S.,"Miami, FL",26,13,6,1.0,1/8/2012,"BJs. The place where you'll wait 25mins for a table,  ""nachos"" is a plate of dry chips with a scant sprinkle of cheese and a wad of sour cream. The fries are served cold. The pasta is undercooked(seriously, how not hard is it to cook pasta?). And you'll be so frustrated with ur smart ass waiter you'll want to punch them in the face and then send them to hell. Welcome! Enjoy!"
Lala A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",10,19,26,2.0,3/27/2013,"I have been here twice so far. My first experience was a Friday night, it was busy our server was an older,nice gentleman. It took awhile for food to come out and drinks were not kept full. The second time I went we got a very pleasant server by the name of Candice. When we got sat (30 min wait avg on a weekend :) ) our server rushed us for our drink order and appetizers before we even had a chance to view the menus. When we asked for additional time that is where the fun began. Our drinks were slammed on the table, toppings for pizza slammed on the table. Our drinks were not kept full, barely even saw our waitress all night.We did see her she standing by the computer all night though. Dinner was extremely slow to come out, took dessert orders and one came out 20minutes before the others did. We all got the cookie desserts and icecream was melted before it even came to the table. Overall the food is ok,decent atmosphere,it is similar to cheesecake factory.However, I am weary of the servers there. Won't be returning here."
