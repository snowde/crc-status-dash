sandra v.,"Hollywood, FL",23,87,15,4.0,2/27/2013,The food is great! Anything you order is always hot and fresh. The only probelm is the wait between when you order and when it gets on your table. Other than that everything is delicious and the drinks are too!
Justin Y.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,30,8,2.0,12/9/2012,If I was going to just go here to watch a game and drink beer I'd give it a better rating.  This is the second time that we ate here and for the second time our service was poor. The server was never around and whenever she came by she was always in a rush which didn't help because most of the time all of our glasses needed refills. The beer selection is good and their beers made in house are good also. Brewing their own beer sets them aside from other brewhouses that have been popping up but the several page menu full of food that just doesn't really jump out at me and the bad service will drive me to better places like Yard House and Tap 42. BTW Yard House is great!
Susana L.,"Miami Lakes, FL",17,12,66,4.0,4/18/2013,I like the food here service has not been bad either i have not tried manny plates but so far what i have tried has been great . Im a fan of desserts and they have a great menu to choose from .
Adetoun Tina A.,"Hollywood, FL",510,156,101,4.0,3/17/2012,"I've been going to this location since it opened and I've had amazing times each time. I went this past tuesday and to my delight it was half off wine all day. Im not a beer drinking but if you are this is a great place to try different beers and get to know more about them. The foods good, large potions even in appetizers so if your going with a group of friends you can order appetizers between all of you. Great tv's everywhere so if you want to watch a game its awesome and the best will have to be their poozoki deserts. Chocolate Chip is the best in my opinion but they have a trio where you can try different ones."
Melissa H.,"Hollywood, FL",103,31,3,4.0,7/19/2014,"Good pizza, good food in general. Im a huge craft beer drinker and I only liked the Jeremiah Red and the Hopstorm. Just wish they had a few more good beers."
Laura B.,"Opa-locka, FL",315,217,76,4.0,12/28/2011,"YUM YUM YUM!!! Everything from their self brewed cream soda, to the desert is absolutely delicious!  I had a pasta dish which was incredible.  The desert however takes the cake.  The Pazookie..... HOLY LORD it was the most delicious thing I'd ever put in my mouth.  The Red Velvet Pazookie has been occupying my thoughts ever since.  Definitely a nice place to go with your family.  They have a nice bar if you just want to stop by for a drink or two.  Every man's dream, a giant TV split 4 ways broadcasting every sports game on this hemisphere, right at the bar, and TV's throughout the dining room.  Good spot! I want to go back!"
liz r.,"Hialeah, FL",39,27,8,5.0,9/8/2012,All the food is amazing!!!...except the wheat pizza crust. & the drinks are all tasty too!!! Get the avocado egg rolls!!!
Brian R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,6,1,5.0,9/24/2014,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most underrated restaurants that needs to be visited ASAP. I have had one of the most best burgers here in this place. It was a jalapeno burger. On top of that they gave me a berry pomegranate which is the best pomegranate that I have had thus far. I recommend everybody to not skip this place, for this place will offer you so many different kind of foods that you will not know where to start at! I know that there are different places like alehouse, which offers different kind of foods like burgers and wings. But BJ brewhouse brings a whole different type of scenery to what is food. Something that impressed is the fact that how you see the photo on the menu is exactly how it will be delivered to you. Do not get a flat top burger. Stick with the flame broiled burgers. Also even their sauces are homemade. Even their sauces. Do not skip this place. If you like to drink and watch the game then this is the place. If you like to be with family, this is the place. If you like food done right then this is the place. Till now, I have no complaints. There was one  time that we have been told to wait due to some complications but the waiters were attentive to us and showed us that they wanted to make us happy. And that is what restaurant should be. About the customer. I give you a five out of five BJ brewhouse, great job."
Nancy G.,"Miami, FL",55,50,37,5.0,12/18/2011,"Me and my friends came across BJ's after leaving a restaurant with a 2 hour wait :/. We ended up waiting about an hour which wasn't bad for a Saturday night and a party of 16. Our waiter was extremely nice especially with our large group. We went a little crazy on the appetizers, but it was well worth it, everything was delicious. Their Mac and Cheese was heaven. Can't wait to stop by again."
Juan R.,"Hollywood, FL",33,51,30,4.0,6/29/2012,Ordered to go the Chicago style deep dish pizza and it was really good.Nice crust and pretty good amount of cheese and veggies.
Ikam A.,"Miami Beach, FL",81,187,4,4.0,9/22/2011,"Awesome beers, awesome food, and awesome wait staff. Can't complain one bit. We are totally planning another visit. Loved my Cajun Tilapia, and my husband loved his made-to-order pizza. He had some ""Wacky Brunette"" beer or something that sounded sorta like that (hello, that's ME!) and I had my usual vodka-soda. It was all delicious and people were so attentive. The place was real laid back, we weren't rushed (a HUGE plus, as you know), and the decor was pretty cool and pleasing to the eye. There were so many menu items I wanted to try, but, hello, we were just there for one meal, so I had to take my chances with one. I will be back, however, so I will let you know how the update is. Stay tuned. All I can say is that the place did not disappoint. We will be re-visiting, and out waitress, Heather, was the bomb."
Shiela G.,"Hollywood, FL",131,33,61,3.0,4/19/2012,Went to this place one weeknight and we got accommodated almost right away. Tried the German wheat beer that nobody can pronounce the name and it was good.  If you like Bluemoon you'll like this one.  Huge menu. I tried the Thai salmon and can't complain. Next time I'll try the the Jeremiah Red beer and the mouthwatering burger that my husband had last time.
Heriberto T.,"Hialeah, FL",0,4,,5.0,5/29/2014,"This place is amazing! Their in house beer is great! You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, my favorites are the Tuscan Limone pasta and California burger with thin fries! However I really recommend their Oreo pizooki to everyone!"
Jess M.,"Hialeah, FL",21,5,2,3.0,7/21/2012,"Wait was way too long, so we found bar seating.  We ordered bruschetta as appetizers which never came, the food took way too long as did the dessert. I ordered a garden medley salad with shrimp and my husband had the Hawaiian salmon. Both entrees were pretty good but they left out the artichoke hearts in my salad, the main reason I ordered it! I let waiter know and she asked for a separate order or hearts, and brought them over rather quickly. Later manager came by, and I explained my appetizer and missing artichoke situation, he was nice enough to offer us dessert on the house. And the dessert was Omg, the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie was amazing! I was not blown out of the water with it all but will probably be back."
Debbie M.,"Hollywood, FL",4,25,47,2.0,4/3/2014,"Beware. I just wrote a tip telling what a great happy hour special they had. When I asked the waitress if they would still make the spinach artichoke pizza that they had taken off of the menu she said.....ahhhhhhhh......no.  Hmm....wonder if she checked with the kitchen because they made it for me several times in the past.  But....no problem....I ordered the build your own pizza with artichokes, jalapenos, and mushrooms.  Warning!!! There is no sauce on their pizzas.  They served me cardboard with a few veggies on top. I loved their other pizza but this was very dry. I asked the waitress if there is no sauce on their pizza and she replied that they braise them with sauce. Trust me when I say that this piece of cardboard had never seen any sauce.  She did bring me an itsy bitsy cup of pizza sauce that added a wee bit of flavor to the cardboard but this was a very disappointing meal. I am giving them two stars instead of one because we have eaten here several times before in the past and I'm hoping that this is just a bad night for them."
David M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",78,4,2,4.0,8/29/2012,Decent serice but the food was amazing couldnt even finish it great place to go eat make sure u try their root beer or cream soda
Brittany M.,"Plantation, FL",213,137,21,3.0,12/2/2011,"The girls and I decided to try somewhere different for dinner so we voted on Bj's Brewhouse. Let me just start off by saying I was highly impressed with the warm, inviting and beautiful ambiance. The lighting is on point, and so are the employees with their spiffy uniforms. There are tvs all around and the bar is absolutely beautiful. Sounds a little silly, I know, but I just couldn't help looking at it! Our waitress was very friendly and the food was great. I'd have to say the fried artichoke hearts appetizer is my favorite! I actually craved them the other day. The strawberry lemonade is perfectly made, and the turkey sandwich I had was a-ok. My girlfriend enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan and the Fettuccini Alfredo. There is outdoor seating if you prefer, but I personally loved being inside. Enjoy!"
Cynthia Y.,"Hollywood, FL",1,15,15,5.0,4/19/2014,"Love the food here, especially the pizza! All the appetizers are delish. It's pretty busy and you will have to wait to be seated, but that just shows how good it is :)"
Haydee U.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,,1.0,10/17/2011,"We went today for an early dinner @ 5pm.  The waiting time was 15 mins. (not bad, but it was not rush time and there were lots of empty tables).  We order the ""famous"" deep dish pizza the mini size, since they told us it was 4 slices for 1 person(I order the pig one and my husband the cheese and tomato) and my son order some corn dogs. When we saw the pizza it was like a kids meal pizza, it was supposed to be a deep dish but that was NOT deep dish pizza it was like a Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut, only more expensive ($9 for the pig one and $7 for the cheese and tomato).  When we finished our pizza we were looking at my sons dish for any leftovers.  We decided not to order dessert there and we went  to Cheesecake Factory to get some dessert (we were hungry). Service was OK, place was nice and prices OK but I will not go again since I was very dissapointed: spent $30 for a 2 pan pizzas and some corn dogs (a very best deal is Target's Pizza Hut, believe me IT""S THE SAME!)"
Miguel G.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,2.0,10/4/2012,"NOTICE How most positive reviews for this place are from ""Out-of Towners"" just saying.... I'm a self acclaimed FOODIE... I just moved to the Pembroke Pines area from Brickell (Downtown) and I've been looking for a nice place up here and boy was I wrong about BJs. From beginning to end the place is a mess... Nearby my table I could see their manager trying to deal with angry customers about their service. Host Service: (Felt like I was at Applebee's)  Waitress Staff: (THE WORST THING THIS RESTAURANT HAS GOING FOR IT),  Food: Not Bad, if it only made it to your table 40 minutes earlier... Drinks/Beers: Overpriced (for Pembroke Pines) Price: GOOD. In all fairness I must say the food is NOT terrible. It just takes all day to make it to your table. I've been here 3 times now, SO I HAVE tried to give this place a chance, but there wont be a 4th time. I rather take the drive downtown/midtown or even Ft.Lauderdale and get a decent meal with great service. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THIS PLACE, you owe it to yourself."
