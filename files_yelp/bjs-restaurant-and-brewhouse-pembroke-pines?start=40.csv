Katia B.,"Hollywood, FL",42,166,112,5.0,8/25/2016,"Every time we have been here the service has always been excellent. The food is also pretty good American food. You can get things like wings, pizza, steak, ribs, and fries. Basic stuff but it tastes good. What I love is the great service and the great beer... and the pazookies are also great!"
Mare G.,"Hollywood, FL",5,18,3,5.0,9/14/2017,Kari the bartender awesome always knows what I like without asking. Cory is fabulous always greets us even if he's not our or server!! Love him keeper!
Michelle S.,"Miramar, FL",105,24,25,5.0,8/26/2016,Great restaurant!! Great service...our server Nailah was so professional...attentive and just AMAZING!!!! We'll be back!!!
Lymari R.,"Hollywood, FL",49,64,176,5.0,3/24/2017,"Absolutely love this place. The Brussel sprouts are my favorite along with ahi tuna salad. They have  a great selection of beers, their full barl is good as well"
Jessica C.,"Hialeah, FL",0,1,,3.0,11/20/2017,It was our first time there and the waitress had a snarky attitude since we sat down i asked what she recommended and she looked at me like i was speaking another language. Am not one to give reviews but it had to be said if you have bad service you will lose customers! The meatballs were so salty i couldn't eat
Lourdes G.,"Hialeah, FL",42,16,49,1.0,9/5/2017,"Let me start by saying this is the second time We come to the Pembroke Pines location and have a bad experience! We had not come to this one in about a year or so and decided to give them one more chance, well - we order our drinks, a couple of beers and some fried calamari and that arrived pretty quick. My son order a cheddar brocoli soup as a starter.  We ordered our food, I ordered a santa fe salad with they make it delicious, my hisband orderd a small (personal pizza) and my son ordered wings.  The food arrived - my son got the wings (no soup), my husband's pizza looked like it could fit in his mouth with just one bite! So he told the waiter to bring a small because he mistakenly had written down a ""mini"" . He all ate, 20 minutes later - still no small pizza! We asked for the bill, we got billed for the damn pizza we never got! The waiter was surprised we didn't get it! It's his job to check on our order, nobody's fault but his.  We told the host up front how we fell, never again will i go in there! Terrible service. Unlike the one at Doral  ‍"
Keisha P.,"Goleta, CA",0,7,8,4.0,3/1/2017,"Went to BJ's for lunch. Meal was received quickly. I was in and out within 40 minutes. My dish was very tasty. The server was attentive and very friendly. I'm satisfied with my visit but only giving a 4 because I didn't experience a ""wow"" factor. I will try BJ's again."
Toby L.,"Hollywood, FL",12,12,41,3.0,1/6/2017,"Haven't been here in a while, so when I received an email with a bogo offer, decided to give it a try.  We were seated immediately and our server came over shortly and greeted us.  She left us to look over the menu and returned quickly with our water. Unfortunately, that was the only quick delivery during the entire meal.  Once we placed our order for entrees, it took nearly an hour to receive them. I ordered unsweetened peach tea and had to wait ten minutes for Kelly to return so I could ask for some Splenda. It took another ten minutes to process our payment.  Drinks were never refilled.  Fortunately the food was delicious. The cherry chipotle salmon had the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. It was not at all too spicy at all. The Parmesan chicken was tender and also cooked well.  Five stars for food. Two for service."
Camille G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",17,42,27,1.0,7/24/2017,"Food and service here are terrible. My husband and I went here for dinner on a Sunday night. We ordered the fried asparagus  ( all clumped together and the breading just fell off when trying to pull them apart), a mini pepperoni pizza (it tasted like it just came fresh out of the microwave), and the parmesan crusted chicken ( bland and not crispy, although the mashed potatoes that came with it were decent). The only thing the got right was the drinks. The Long Islands were good. Kudos to the bartender. When we told the waitress we were not satisfied with our meal and asked for the check, we sat there for a half an hour waiting for her to come back. We eventually walked up to the take out counter and asked for the manager. No apologies. We will not be returning to this establishment."
Jessica D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,4,,1.0,10/5/2017,"This was once our favorite place to eat dinner until tonight. We walked in as a party of 8 on a Thursday night around 7:30 PM for a birthday. The food was great. However, the service was absolutely terrible. It took 35 minutes for our drinks to reach the tables and 40 minutes for our appetizers to come out. Our waters took about an hour to come to the table. Our entrees took an hour plus to come out. The manager John came by to apologize they were short staffed but did absolutely nothing to make sure our drinks were filled as he said he would. A very rude waitress came by to let us know the bar was out of Black Label and did not offer us something different. This place is not the same as it use to be years ago. It's sad because BJ's once was our favorite place but after tonight, we will not be returning. I hate writing bad reviews and being this customer; however something needs to change with this restaurant. Lazy servers and lazy cooks with no ambition. Not worth waiting for the food and spending so much money. You're better off going across the street to Ale House where there is better food, service, and more affordable."
John S.,"Hollywood, FL",32,7,1,1.0,8/21/2017,we went on a Sunday 530 and the place was empty. we were told that we had to wait 30 min since they didnt have enough servers. We sat at one of the bar tabeles since we didnt want to wait. We had to clean off the table our self. we had to get menus our self. It was very hot and we asked if they could make it cooler we were told that the ac has been broken and they were working on it.
Jillian S.,"Weston, FL",116,4,1,1.0,8/19/2017,"Second time ordering online and it was just as terrible as the first time I ordered online. The pick up time was 6 pm & it wasn't ready until 630. I ordered the fried jalapeño burger and there was no fried jalapeños on it, nor was there fries on the side. The second thing I ordered was sliders with only lettuce pickles and onions, and there was no onions on it. The last thing I ordered was three pizookies and only received one ice cream. Not one thing I ordered was correct. Now my food is cold and I've wasted over an hour here. Save yourself the time and order take out somewhere else"
Marvin A.,"Hialeah, FL",109,127,225,5.0,5/15/2016,"It's been more than 2 years since I reviewed this establishment and after visiting 4 times in the last 2 months the service is amazing. On our last visit I ordered a salmon kale Brussels dinner salad and unfortunately it arrived as a lunch salad (the difference is in the salmon size and price ofcourse) so I pointed it out to the waitress and she get the manager to immediately replace it with the dinner size. This place keeps getting better and better every time I go. The service is great, the hostesses and waitresses are very attentive. I love having dinner here keep up the good work!"
Chrystin J.,"Hollywood, FL",18,8,1,3.0,8/4/2016,"My friend and I met for a Thursday night ""chat feast"". I've been there for an hour, had the soup & Salad Combo (tomato soup, yum). Joined by my friend. Had a couple more glasses of wine and wanted to treat us by paying with points! 393 by the total on my app. But was told that only food could be paid with points.  Asked for the manager and corporate contact info.  No where on the app or on the full website does it disclose this restriction. Manager, Mr. Chavez agreed and made it right!   Nice to see that he was empowered to correct a corporate oversight. Love the restaurant and the FOOD, just need a bit of housecleaning on their rewards program."
Heather G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",39,65,81,4.0,9/4/2017,"I've been here before quite a while back and don't really remember it standing out to me for any reason, nor do I have any bad memories of the place. So when a friend suggested it for lunch I was like sounds good to me. Its pretty big inside and has a decent bar area. They have a point system for the loyals. The menu is huge!! Like it has actual page numbers. I wanted to call it a sports bar type place but it's not. It's more than that and they have a lot of food options. I decided on the California chicken club and fries. The sandwich came on garlic toast and had avocado. It was really good! The waitress was attentive and nice. They had this cookie thing that I kept eyeballing for dessert but ended up being full so I passed on it. I think that I may give this place another try as there were a lot of yummy looking things on the menu. Ok really because I want that damn cookie, but I'll play it off by ordering actual food first."
Josh S.,"Dallas, OR",15,17,4,2.0,4/16/2017,"First thing's first, our server Ebony was Awesome! Her and the two ladies at the take out entrance were the only three professionals we saw. The food was also awesome. I have zero complaints about those three individuals and the food. I would go back for Ebony and the food. With that said, the other employees we witnessed there were terrible. When I say terrible, I mean that I would have fired them on the spot, no questions asked. The first guy we will discuss came out of the back (assuming he worked in the kitchen in some capacity due to his crocs) being loud and incredibly obnoxious. He hung around the bar area for a few minutes with this ""I own this place attitude"". When another employee confronted him and asked him to tone it down, he replied multiple times in a manner inappropriate for the atmosphere ""are you kidding me right now?"" before walking out to purchase Red Bulls from Trader Joes. While enjoying my delicious food, my wife pointed out to me that the bartender was snapping a female employees behind with a towel. This might explain why my drink was terrible and clearly made with a severe lack of knowledge and/or care. Aside from the drink, the actions of the bartender are not only inappropriate,  but illegal. While I don't know the relationship between these individuals but their behaviour was terribly inappropriate.  I will go back but somebody needs to have a serious look at their management. There is clearly too much money invested in this establishment to risk shenanigans like the ones we witnessed."
Yasuyo R.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",49,8,20,4.0,1/15/2017,"This is my 4-5 time but I didn't know about BJ's mobile app. So we asked waitress her name is Angelica. She explained us so well, she was so polite, great energy and well trained.  I had great dinner with my son today  I highly recommend"
Harvey D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",216,406,,2.0,6/22/2017,"I had to downgrade my review because I am sick and tired of this restaurant filling carry out orders incorrectly.  I have ordered carry out from them many times because my wife likes their food.  They can't seem to ever get it right.  For example, I ordered the chicken club with fries (online).  I even called and made sure that they didn't put bacon or cheese on the sandwich and that it came with fries.  What happened?  They forgot to give me the fries and gave us some sort of shrimp pasta (which we didn't order).  Come on!  Do they even look at what they are putting in the bag?  My wife was in a hurry and didn't have time to check and make sure that everything was ok.  She shouldn't have to.  An order of tacos and a chicken club with fries is not that difficult to package correctly.  There have been several other instances of ineptness at this restaurant throughout the past few months.  I think management needs to take a look at their carry out staff and the procedures that go along with the carry out process. Until they fix this problem, I won't be ordering carry out from them."
Jimmy S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,5.0,10/14/2017,"Outstanding service, went here for a birthday lunch with my Mom, the food was good i'd give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars but the service was great in the end. My mom loves Longhouse wanted nothing to do with BJ's but I convinced her to come here since it was my birthday she was a bit critical because of it, the salads showed up and as the guy was placing them on our table the waitress also showed up with our steaks with that ""oh shit"" look on her face. Not such a big deal really but whatever we pushed the steaks aside for a few minutes finished the salads then while we were finishing the steaks the manager came around and asked how everything was, my moim said everything was great but I told him about the salad and entrée showing up at the same time said I didn't want to complain but since he was asking it would defeat the purpose if I did not tell him. He said he was going to give us free dessert to make up for it, once again I told him I didn't want to complain everything was good it just if he's asking for criticism then I want to give it to help him better things. So the waitress comes back says we have free dessert on the house and i'm not much of a dessert person so I jokingly ask her if I can get another beer instead of dessert a few minutes later she shows up with free dessert for my mom and a free Oktoberfest for myself.. I don't really know what to say other than this place goes above and beyond to make sure you're happy and it was really refreshing in this day and age. Five star review from me. I will definitely be back."
Stacey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,123,143,5.0,10/2/2016,I love this place. Great for beer lovers since they have there own brewery. I would definitely get the root beer ribs again. The name doesn't do it justice because I hate root beer but these ribs are amazing.
