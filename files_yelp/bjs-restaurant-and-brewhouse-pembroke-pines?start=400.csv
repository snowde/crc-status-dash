Angela G.,"Miami, FL",12,16,4,5.0,1/6/2012,I give this place 5 stars in everything from food to decore to wait time. This a new place located in pembroke pines. The lobby is huge and has 2 big couches. I went with 6 of my closest friends and was seated fast the food wait time  was good and the food was amazing and a big plus is their huge portions. I would reccomend this place to everyone.
Enrique C.,"Miami, FL",6,138,383,5.0,1/23/2012,One of my favorite restaurants.  The beer  and appetizers are AWESOME.  The place is very beautiful.  The food is great.  All types of foods and drinks.  The wait time was approximate 15 minutes.
Sidra H.,"Hollywood, FL",11,5,,4.0,2/21/2012,"The decor is nice, and the food isn't bad, but the veggie burger I had made my stomach hurt a bit =X"
Yasi P.,"Hollywood, FL",25,40,9,5.0,10/8/2011,"At first I was sad that they knocked down on the border to put this restaurant....but let me just say I do not miss on the border at all......This restaurant is wonderful...the wait was about 40min...its a new place in pines it's going to get filled with people every weekend... They sat me in my husband in the the two people booth which I love... The decor is gorgeous... Made us feel very warm ,and in Chicago... The service was spectacular.... We had the flatbread margarita pizza and is was Sokol delicious... My husband had the harvest beer ,and it was super tasty... I don't drink beer but that's a beer that I will def. Drink. My husband had the Alfredo ,and I had the BBQ pull pork sandwhich.... The food is very very good.....loved the service and we cannot wait to go back."
Lisa R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",24,45,12,2.0,11/8/2011,"Wait time 1 hr on a Friday night, not unexpected. Service awful! Server not knowledgeable about menu, pace of meal really long and out of sequence.  I suspect it will be better once they have some experience.  Not impressed at all by pizza, pizza hut is better"
Diana F.,"Hollywood, FL",1,22,4,2.0,4/20/2014,"I use to be in love with this place until they took every component of my usual meal off the menu. Goodbye thai chicken wontons, goodbye bacon cheeseburger pizza, goodbye red velvet pizookie. Such sadness. I've had so many awful plates here, I cant understand why they'd take off such good ones. I use to frequent it quite often, can't say the same anymore."
P J.,"Hialeah, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/22/2012,It was brutally awful service. Heat lamp cafeteria food quality. Kitchen does not have a firm grasp of the huge menu. GO ELSEWHERE during peak times. So much for the Cheesecake Factory's sister company.
Liz F.,"Hialeah, FL",1,4,1,1.0,1/19/2014,"Horrible experience including having to call manager to our table.  It was a Saturday night and they ran out of pizza dough for their famous deep dish! Had to order hand tossed. When the food came to our table the shareable pizza looked like a cracker.  The other entree,Parmesan crusted chicken,  looked like a dish from a cafeteria.  The vegetable was missing and the server took the entire dish back and placed 3 pieces of very small broccoli. I called the manager over and asked how much each meal cost? ""Don't know would have to look at menu."" I asked if the servings looked adequate for the price. ""Well the pizza doesn't look right it should have been stretched more."" Really?!?!   Needless to say we asked for the check.  The manager returned with a $20 courtesy card. Sorry but not good enough.  Lastly, the manager went on to tell us that sometimes you lose a couple tables to quality a night. It just happens.  Very disappointed since we are frequent diners and have loyalty card.   Hope your experience is a better one."
JAmerican G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",16,129,58,3.0,10/23/2011,"The food was ok, but the service was awful!  They took so long to bring ur food & at one point I had to tell the waitress to tell the manager that my dessert will be free, since I had to wait 30 minutes for it!"
Cathy H.,"Hollywood, FL",74,46,1,3.0,8/31/2013,"My husband & I just visited BJ's last night for the 2nd time.  I guess the newness has worn off because the wait on a Friday night was 15-/20 minutes.  The food here is good, yet lacking at the same time.  We ordered a flatbread pizza for an appetizer & the taste was good, but the toppings were skimpy for the $9 price.  I found myself biting into flatbread with no topping on it because it was all concentrated in the middle with very little cheese.  I had the Cobb salad which comes with creamy garlic dressing.  It's really a chopped salad and the salad itself was very good & a just right portion, but the dressing tastes fishy to me. Blech!  My hubby had fish & chips which he said was good.  We then moved onto dessert. We ordered two desserts which were too many. One to share would have been good but that's our fault not the restaurant's. we ordered the fruit pie type dessert with vanilla ice cream & the chocolate brownie pie with Ice cream. Both were good but we both liked the fruit one better.  To be honest I don't think I'd ever order dessert there again because it wasn't anything to write home about and added another $13 to our bill.  I will say though that their hamburgers & pizzas look awesome & we both thought we would like to back & try those menu items.  The place has an excellent atmosphere & good vibe.  The hostesses & waitstaff are very friendly & accommodating.  The only long wait this time was for our desserts, but it looked like they had to bake them so that may have counted for the long wait.  We will try again but will order some different things next time."
Boris B.,"Boca Raton, FL",224,18,,4.0,3/29/2012,"I went here one night with my girlfriend and sister.   My girlfriend had the cajun pasta and said it was great!   My sister and friend said  they loved their food so I assume it was good for them at least.  I just wanted a Clam Chowder since I'm on a diet, and I was very impressed by how good the soup was!  The service was good and I insist everyone tried the Clam Chowder for sure!!!!"
Christopher G.,"Homestead, FL",10,5,,4.0,8/19/2012,I have been to several BJ's around Fla and all are great. I was very excited to see one finally near myself. This one is smaller than the rest a little but still great inside. Food was fantastic as always. Took a while for them to get me a rewards application (Im nit-picking here). GREAT place to go for sports and great food and some great beer
Neha C.,"Hollywood, FL",4,14,4,3.0,3/19/2012,"I was excited to see BJ's opening here in pines after hearing so much rave on their tampa location. We went here on a wed night and waited about 5 minutes, which was a good thing. The decor is gorgeous. Service was excellent. But food was very average. Nothing special. I had their piranha beer which was really good. For appetizers we had chicken avocado rolls and stuffed mushrooms both were really good... For dinner we had mediterranean deep dish pizza which was salty... Chicken alfredo pasta was average... And Parmesan crusted chicken which was good.... For dessert I had to try their famous cookies n cream pizookie and this was probably my favorite on the menu. It was so heavenly good....  I would go back here just for the pizookie...."
W F.,"Newport News, VA",25,36,5,5.0,9/21/2011,"What can I say... This place takes be back to southern California when I was younger.   The awesome in house brewed beer.  The ""California"" club.   Awesome pizzas. Good happy hours.  I suggest you atleast give it a try and go with friends.   Get the beer sampler and go from there."
Mike C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,53,30,4.0,10/25/2011,"Best part of Bj's Brewhouse are the Bloody Mary's.  I also had the pumpkin beer which was really tasty.  I ordered a burger there, I asked for it medium...  It was medium-well...  I do not like sending food back, so I decided to eat it anyway.  If the burger was cooked to my liking, it would have been really good.  I will definitely go there again, the atmosphere is great, and the television is pretty good for viewing sporting events."
Adriana P.,"Hollywood, FL",18,21,,2.0,10/16/2011,"This place recently opened in Pembroke Pines so it has been packed pretty much every day.. I tried eating there once with my husband on a Friday night and the wait was 2 hours long so we left.. I finally got to try it this past Friday during lunchtime and let's just say I wish I had gone somewhere else... Although the decor is nice and the interior is rather appealing, I found the service to be way too overwhelming... The menu was overwhelming as well, with almost 30 pages... I ordered a Chicken Parm and it was SO SPICY.. it was so disgusting I had to return it and they took forever to bring it back out.. When they finally brought it out.. the chicken was fine, but the past was STILL SPICY... at this point, I just ate the chicken breast because I wasn't willing to wait any longer... Their dessert choice is ""blah"" and the rest of the food my party ordered wasn't anything special either..  Prices are high and definitely not worth it...  I will not be going back to this place.."
Adrianna T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",12,12,5,5.0,10/3/2011,Great food options that are really good! The service is top notch(ask for corey)..plus they have 42 beers on tap which is pretty amazing!!
Larry L.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,15,,2.0,1/31/2012,"Made curious by the packed lot at lunch time, my wife and I sneaked in for an early dinner at 5:15 on a Saturday.  The lot was still packed, but we got a table for 2 after a 5-minute wait.  Most of the multi-page menu is devoited to beer, cocktails, and wine.  The food listings are difficult to make out, so I had to borrow my wife's spectacles to read them.   Here goes: Beers:  excellent, priced more than domestics. Margherita Fresca flatbrea pizza:  it had some good flavor, but there were few discernible toppings.  It looked naked compared to this chain's online photo.  JUST O.K. Chicken Lettuce Wraps:  bit of chicken and other ingredients, supposedly including water chestnuts and mushrooms, but I could not tell.  Certainly, no crispy won-tons on top.  Plenty of lettuce leaves, though.  My screwup -- I didn't read that the white sauce was Chinese horseradish mustard and poured some on the first wrap.  (Ruined it.)  JUST O.K.  Piranha Pale Ale Nachos:  worst nachos I ever had.  All we kept scooping up was chili-flavored beans.  DON'T DO IT When we left at about 6, there were a whole bunch of people outside, pagers in hand, waiting for tables.  Summary:  A good place to go with friends for drinking and socializing, and for large portions of mediocre food.   Every sports bar I've been to serves better grub than this.  Maybe if we had ordered burgers.... I'll make a side trip back to try the deep-dish pizza and see how it compares to Chicago style, but for nothing else."
Michael L.,"Miami-Dade, FL",0,21,,3.0,8/17/2013,"I've made the mistake coming here more than twice. Every time I've come it's the same story with the entrees. ""Sir we ran out of that, and that, and that."" Only reason I'm giving it three stars is because they have great appetizers."
Miguel M.,"Hollywood, FL",39,5,2,4.0,12/18/2011,"Food is delicius; however, the wait is always huge. My suggestion is to call before heading there so they can have your name on the waiting list."
