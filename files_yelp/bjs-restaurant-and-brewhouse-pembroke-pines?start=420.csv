Manny L.,"Hollywood, FL",0,61,5,5.0,12/15/2012,"I have been here several times and it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, the food is good and at a reasonable price, lots drink selection, lots of TV's all over the place with sports, etc...  I come with friends and family and we always have a good time.  The kids love their flat bread pizza and my wife loves their soups and salads."
Marcie P.,"Hollywood, FL",0,37,9,5.0,2/13/2012,Loved the gluten free menu.  They have gluten free pizza and gluten free dessert.  Nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly.
Karen C.,"Hollywood, FL",0,10,,2.0,1/14/2014,"Food is typical for a chain restaurant - edible but nothing to write home about.  I have been here about 5 times, usually sit at bar where I have had good service.  Appetizer platter always takes over 30 minutes to get to you so they should really warn the customers about this when the order is taken.  But the last time I was at this restaurant, the service was beyond rude.  I have only ""stiffed"" a waiter twice in my life and this was one of them.  I always leave at least 20% if not more, being in the industry myself.  I understand that restaurants are at the mercy of their employees so I called to speak with management the next day as not to cause a stir in the dining room.  I left my name and phone number - no return call.  I wanted to give them the courtesy of knowing about poor service. Oh well, I'll spend my money elsewhere."
Doug B.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/18/2012,"Corporate nastiness! Nothing special with the beer. They even carded me, and I'm 56 years old! Rude beyond belief!"
Pedro C.,"Broward, FL",1,4,,5.0,11/1/2011,"This place is the perfect fit for people looking for beer and good food. Their food menu is relatively extensive considering the wide selection of beers, you would think otherwise but it is very complete. Their specialty is pizza so be sure to try it and as for the beer make sure you try theirs first by getting a sampler. Cheers!"
Amado C.,"Hollywood, FL",0,18,32,2.0,7/14/2013,I like BJs.  My problem with this restaurant is the service.  It's never consistent and most of the time you have to wait a long time.  Tried talking to the manager to at least help... I got no reaction and a month later.. Same service.  I will rate them a 1 star... But the reason why I take them to two is because the food and beer is great. However the management of the restaurant does not seem to care.  I saw similar reviews posted.
Barry V.,"Hollywood, FL",85,38,,1.0,5/29/2012,"Last night was my second visit to BJ's restaurant.  Duringthe first visit I thought the food was great although the service was a bit erratic.  I chalked this up to the place being fairly new and the waiter being a bit overwhelmed.  Last night was a disaster.  The service was inattentive at best.  The server could not handle the tables she had and never checked back with us to see how the food was.  We ordered the Best Beginings, an appetizer combo.  my daughter found a rubber band in the avocado egg roll.  We presented thjis to the manager who appologized, offered a replacement which we declined since we had several more appetizers and an entree to come.  He stated he would take the platter off our bill which never happened. We also ordered the ribs which were far from tender.  In spite of this, I paid the full bill because I did not want to get into everything that they had done wrong and just wanted to get out of there at that point.  We also had dirty flatware in our roll up and then again when they brought the dessert.  Someone actually had to pick up a dirty spoon and place it on the plate! I tried to send them my comments usingtheir on-line feedback form which does not have a submit button so you can type to your hearts content but never actually submit your feedback. I commented after my first visit (there was a submit button then but the pembroke Pines restaurant was not on the drop down list att hat point) and they never responded.  Obviously, their laid back california attitude does not allow for feedback or replies.   This is on my never again list of places to avoid."
William T.,"Miami, FL",0,34,,4.0,8/12/2013,"Ate at Orlando location & loved it.  Service was a bit slow, but the bartender (manager) was very friendly, explained the menu. I had a BBQ slider, skinny fries & BBQ Chix breast & Cole Slaw. The slaw tasted like nothing but cabbage with milk poured over it.  Horrid.  The rest of the food was great, prices a bit steep, but not too bad. I live in Miami & will soon try the newly opened Miami location as I pass it on the way home. I'd definitely go back to try something else from their very extensive menu.  Loved the place, decor, etc.,"
Allan B.,"Hollywood, FL",0,10,,1.0,7/7/2012,"While the waitress staff is very good and relatively attentive, the food is both from a quality point of view and basic cooking appalling. Green beans served Luke warm and undercooked. Pork chops were apparently reheated and hard, with the best of two meals being the mashed potatoes. Surprising in a facility where money and thought were obviously put into the restaurant decor. Maybe that is the problem: all the  seed money went to plant with no cash leftover to hire decent cooks."
Casper P.,"Hollywood, FL",0,35,,4.0,9/12/2012,"Kid friendly staff.  I enjoy the apps and bar b ques chicken salad.  Pizza is good.  Get the small.  Beer is very good.  I like the different beer options.  A little pricey but, overall very good."
Stephanie S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7,8,,5.0,1/3/2012,"Our server was Tara, she was great, very attentive. The food was excellent, we got the best beginnings as an appetizer, it had a little of everything, two types of egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, chips and dip. The appetizer did such a good job of filling us up that each one of us took home leftovers. We ordered the jambalaya which was true to its form with rice. My husband was happy with the black and blue burger, and I had the blonde shrimp, which were a little over-done - but still good. The drinks were delicious. My friend and I both had the BJ's Irish Root beer - we will definitely get these again. My husband tried a couple different brews, he liked the Oktoberfest the best. The restaurant is extremely popular and usually has a wait. They encourage you to call ahead and put your name on the wait list. We got there expecting a wait, so it didn't dampen our mood, which was good because our wait was longer than quoted. All in all we had good food and good service and will be visiting again."
Priscilla B.,"Alexandria, VA",1,6,1,2.0,12/25/2011,"Location is very good, but the service was not good.  The waiter was never around and neglected to bring two items I had ordered.  We had to ask another waiter for assistance because our waiter was no where to be found.  The floor around the hostess station was VERY slippery as I was walking to the restrooms.  The food its self was okay but nothing that really stood out.  I think the beer selection is what they have going for them.  I will go back but not to be served by the same waiter."
C T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,17,,1.0,3/23/2014,disgusting food...hamburgers taste like whoppers
Anna D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,5.0,5/15/2012,"amazing amazing resteraunt, the angus beef sliders tender, mouth watering and delicious. the half baked potato so  big and yummy couldnt even finish. the french fries crispy and yummy. chicken parmesan was flavorful and delicious not oversauced. mu husbands steak cooked to perfection. the only complaints were his steak fries were dry and his mojito was mostly ice. and my fountain drink tasted a little flat, i think they needed to clean the machines, other than that everything else was amazing :), going back next month :D"
Scott S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,5.0,2/29/2012,I eat at Bjs every weekend and its got to the point where the blonde host at the front even remembers my name. I give the girl a lot of credit she always seems so calm and has a smile even though theres a line out the door and people throwing pagers in her face.  I must say they do have great front of house staff but some of the servers need a little more training. The food is great and I also enjoy going during happy hour specials. I will continue coming here
Nick M.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,,4.0,10/9/2011,"Very nice addition to Pembroke Pines area. Food was good and atmosphere is superior to most bistro/sports bar places in the area. Staffing and service will take time for a restaurant this large to operate efficiently, but that is to be expected. Family friendly plus a very cool bar area, which includes one of the best and biggest flat screens I've ever scene. Most restaurants in area are run down and tired, this place has a beautiful and comfortable build out. Just hope clientele stays as upscale as restaurant."
Jinjer S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",45,4,,1.0,11/10/2011,"I alway drove pass this place and I could not wait until it open for business.  The place was clean and roomy with lots of big screen tv's which was the only plus i had on my first visit to BJ's restaurant.  I just finish the race for the cure in Miami and I wanted to tried out the new restaurant BJ's, which was close to my house. I order the chicken & fries, but the chicken came to the table under cook.  I brought it to the attention of my waiter and he took it back to the kitchen. But one thing that made me decided not to never go back to this restaurant again was the Manager. The name he gave was JR and he told me the chicken was not under cook because they stored it in freezer. He went on to say its suppose look that way and they lightly cook the chicken that way.  I explained to him the meat was little pink and white and it have nothing to do with the freezer. He stated I guess we will have to cook it crispy for you. He left and never came back even when the waiter brought back my the food. I think its unprofessional to blame the customer for half done food and treat them like they did something wrong.  (Getting serve undone food is not cool and can be a health hazard)"
