Samar R.,"Miami Lakes, FL",108,113,316,4.0,5/15/2016,I love the grand selection. The peachberry tea. But....the clam chowder was way too thick... not soupy at all and was cold unfortunately. Our server was Angelica. She's amazing. Shout out to Angelica.... lol
Dee W.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,,5.0,4/25/2017,Jayla is a five star server! Because I'm younger a lot of servers assume I won't tip good and I get bad service but Jayla was awesome and attentive. She earned that 20% tip without even trying to hard! I'm rating 5 stars just because of Jayla herself. Food was also really good. My picky friend found herself a plate of food she actually liked.
Monica M.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,3.0,10/20/2017,"Its an ok place. Dont expect anything more than what you would get from any more ther chain restaurant. Its an overhyped ""classy"" TGIF FRIDAY's. It gets a 3 because of their good beers."
Maggie S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,74,4,4.0,6/25/2017,"So after we placed our order, it took our server 20 mins. to let us know that one dish we ordered was not available. Ruined our wait time totally. Such a shame when a place has good food but bad service.  EDIT: I have changed my original one star review and they just comped our bill. Thank you."
Faye H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,3,1,1.0,7/22/2017,"Big BJs Brewhouse fan NOT this branch.    We called early in the day to make a reservation for a party of 10, they told us reservations are only for parties of 6 and we can do a call ahead half hour before. We did this and they told us they couldn't as its only for parties of 6. (Insert rolling eyes) We get there, Sarah the hostess who acted like she didn't want to even serve us said waitime is 1 hour for inside and 10 minutes for outside. We chose outside (we had kids with us who were hungry). But it is the middle of summer and was hot, exhaust from cars, noise of Pines Blvd and the ceiling fans were off. We asked them to switch the fans on, it seemed like we asked for gold as they stared at us like deer in headlights. We then asked to switch to inside seating. The hostess said the wait was 2 hours.  We left. Sarah was very sour and rude and not suited to that front desk position.  We got reservations at another restaurant without an issue and are currently seated and enjoying appetizers.   We'll stick with the Coral Springs BJs  branch."
Jessica C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,10,5,1.0,1/13/2017,For the second time in less then 10 days the service has been terrible 1.5 hours for a soup and salad an the second visit 2 hours to get hour food was cold the asparagus salty overcooked and spicy  unable to eat it then when the waiter called the manager he took another 15 minutes to show up Will not be going back  It's a shame that such great place has turned into such crap
Lori R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,30,2,3.0,5/20/2017,"Went to BJ's for the first time today.  I got the shrimp tacos which were good, but skimpy.  My husband got the sirloin.  He wasn't impressed.  It was tough and he kept putting salt on it.  He liked the broccoli and mashed potatoes.  We split a sampler of beer.  I liked the Jeremiah Red and he liked the Nutty Brewnette.  Neither of us liked the Hopstorm and we can't even remember the 4th one. Service was friendly and attentive, but the kitchen was kind of slow.  Bj's isn't as painfully loud as most other restaurants in the area, but there wasn't anything that makes us eager to return."
MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2081,4444,3.0,1/20/2015,"We were headed over to ""Longhorns"" and spotted BJ's Brewhouse. It is located in the same strip mall as the new Trader Joe's.  I have been such a fan of the South Miami location.  This one is smaller but has the same décor and great large bar /lounge area.  We started with a couple of beers. I enjoy the blonde, it's refreshing! Our server was super sweet but she seemed way off.  Her mind was not where it was supposed to be that's for sure.   She would say the strangest things.  Odd!  Anyhow, we were starving so I ordered Spinach & Artichoke dip and my daughter ordered the avocado rolls.  We have had these before and we especially love the avocado rolls.  Both arrived and we knew something was way wrong with the rolls.  They looked nothing like we were used to.  I took one very tiny bite.  Oh no no they were awful, not even edible. They were super fried and greasy and the avocado was HOT!  Yuk, so when our server came to check on us I asked her to remove the plate because they were so bad.  She took the plate away not really saying anything.  I am not one to get items taken off the bill but if it is obvious one tiny bite was taken the polite think to do would be to take it off the bill.  Nope, I paid for it.  We started to eat the Spinach and artichoke dip.  Again, disappointing.  Way to creamy, tasted watered down.  The only thing that saved it was the artichoke.  I would say skip both of these appetizers here.  It is a shame because the location in South Miami, both of these were excellent.  They have a very large menu and I so wished I could try other menu items but I am obsessed with their deep dish pizza.   So we ordered one, of course!  I am a Chicago girl so of course I LOVE deep dish pizza.  Is it as deep or filled with ingredients top to bottom?  No  but hey we are not in Chicago nor do they say it is Chicago style.  It is thick, fresh ingredients, very tasty crust, and such good cheese and diced tomatoes.   If you are a fan of sauce this may not be the type of pizza for you.   They barely put any sauce on it, more flavor from the fresh diced tomatoes.  This must be why I enjoy it so much.  Cheese, cheese, sausage & mushrooms, tomatoes, oh yes happiness!  This pizza is five stars to me. I wish they delivered this awesome pizza.  Thankfully, the pizza was just as good as I remembered.  I hope on our next visit the service and quality of appetizers get much better."
Robin B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,10,,1.0,9/30/2017,Gave this restaurant a second chance as my order came out wrong twice the first time I went there & my husband & I walked out. I spoke to both managers Gerardo & Mauricio & was promised a complementary meal the next time I came in. Came in tonight and they charged me for our drinks saying that they could not comp the liquor bill. I wish they told me that the three times I spoke to them on the phone.   I never would have ordered drinks. Just not right. Food is mediocre service not great plenty of other places to go
Justin G.,"Hollywood, FL",18,10,11,1.0,8/2/2016,"What a fall from grace. This place was so nice when it opened. While the food has remained pretty good, the service has taken a huge hit. The last two times I've been to this establishment for a late lunch, ticket times have run well into 45 minutes (burgers, sandwiches, etc) for parties of two. To add insult to injury, every order was wrong (wrong salad dressing, wrong side, etc), and there were zero refills on the drinks.  Asking for a to-go box takes an additional 15 minutes. Is there a reason there is zero waitstaff on the floor for 15 minutes?  The place is in desperate need of a management overhaul. Someone has dropped the ball.  Takeaway: Find someplace else to dine."
Kethnie M.,"Hollywood, FL",67,156,100,4.0,9/9/2016,I liked the flatbread here! It also had great soup. Very nice decor and great place to stop here for lunch.
Vianka A.,"Hollywood, FL",72,184,510,2.0,7/16/2016,"Two stars because they're pzookie is the bomb! We haven't been to BJs brewhouse I would say in a little over a year. But Friday night got the sudden urge to revisit and was that a huge mistake. I still have the sour taste the experience left in my mouth. I wouldn't be revisiting BJs brewhouse or recommending them to my worst enemy. We arrived and was told it was a twenty minute wait and we waited not to bad for a Friday night. We got seated and everything went downhill. At first our waitress Nicole was upbeat and friendly and to be honest you can be serving the worst food and the waitress can turn that experience into the best. After waiting to be recognized we already knew what we were ordering and put our order right in. We started with the appetizer avocado egg rolls (use to the best) now they put some sauce I guess to substitute the avocado and it's real spicy. We then went to our entree the hubby ordered the crusted parm chicken w/ mash potatoes and broccoli , the chicken was good but the mash was horrible and the broccoli cold and stale. My oldest son ordered the classic burger it's a burger and he's a kid so guess what BJs excellent ten for that one. I ordered the north beach mahi and shrimp and was not impressed one bit. It was missing flavor all around. Youngest got chicken tenders and fries and he didn't even touch the tenders but it's tree pieces with a decent amount of fries. Then came the worst of the worst we order our pzookie and two ice cream sundae for the boys. After waiting over twenty five minutes for our dessert and asking twice about it it finally came out but I had to give my pzookie ice cream to my youngest child because they only brought out one sundae and had to share a spoon with my youngest son and husband to eat the pzookie because they only brought one spoon. After she rushed away from our table when dropping the desert and came back to pick up the check we told her to kindly remove the ice scream scoop we never received she never apologized she blamed another waitress. Then saw the waitress coming with the ice cream and told her forget it it's too late. Instead of giving the ice cream since it was already served and out of courtesy not charged the 1.50 it cost. Well we left the 15% tip because we have manners but clearly BJ does not.  It's really sad I've been here a few times for dinner and lunch precious to this visit and never had this experience but then again that was awhile back something clearly has changed with management or chefs."
Heather M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",132,85,18,3.0,2/21/2017,"I've been here a few times and this visit was one of the better visits, but it still only gets 3 stars. I'll explain why. To start things off on a high note, my Pink Cadillac cocktail was very yummy and I really enjoyed it. For my entree, I decided to have the sirloin steak. It was reasonably priced but it was nothing special. My sister had a bison burger and didn't care for it. For dessert, we had beignets. My mom told us how delicious they were, and boy was she right. I was craving more! Deliciously pillowy, not to sweet, and with a side of fresh strawberries, ice cream, and whipped cream. This is not a dessert to pass up! As far as our server goes, she was ok. Her name was Kathy, and she was very busy! It was very clear to me that she was trying to upsell every chance she could. I understand needing to upsell, but I don't like it when it's obvious. Then it's just annoying. She suggested appetizers. Then she suggested more rounds of drinks. Then she suggested dessert. I don't know, maybe it was just me who noticed it, but I heard her doing it at all the other tables as well. Last thing- their website says ALL pizzas are half off on Mondays. That is not the case, and BJ's needs to make it more clear. My mom got a mini deep dish, which was not half off.  Overall, forgettable as usual. I'm sure I'll come back for dessert and drinks, but not dying to come back for the food or service."
Alan J.,"Hialeah, FL",0,8,,1.0,7/29/2016,"7/29/16. Lunch.  Slow service, 15 mins to even order, over cooked fries, sandwich was small, slow on refills. Soup portion was small. Last time I'll visit this place."
Moe L.,"Hollywood, FL",0,8,,3.0,9/6/2017,The food is still great but something about the service has changed. Im use to a friendly vibe here that makes it alot different from other restaurant.
P Luis R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,20,10,3.0,6/2/2016,"I convinced a group of us to go there for lunch and I ordered my usual salad (Ahi Tuna), but on this day, it was a sloppy mess! The salad always used to look like the image in the menu and this salad was far from what imagined. Yikes! The staff are always friendly and mean to do well, but after a long discussion with Management, she told me that Corporate decided to make that adjustment on the salad- I told her to tell Corporate that they don't pay us to eat there, therefore when there's a good thing going, best idea is to leave it alone."
Brian L.,"Hollywood, FL",145,19,7,2.0,11/30/2016,"I don't know what it is about this location. We go to the BJ's up in Orlando all of the time and it's about as good as can be, but this Pines location can't get right, and hasn't been right since opening . On this trip the service was horrible. No one came to our table for 20 minutes and the place was half empty. Drinks were horrible tasting. Took more than 30 minutes for our entrees to come out of the kitchen..When it did come out, it was wrong. Our fault for coming here but we were in this plaza and figured we'd try it again. Honestly..don't bother."
Alyce K.,"Coral Gables, FL",54,84,222,5.0,1/2/2016,"Great place for a casual dinner- family friendly.  Prices are reasonable and I have yet to order anything I dislike.  Their burgers are huge and delicious, can be on the greasy side, but then again, I'm not exactly trying to eat healthy when I come here, I'm trying to get good tasty food! You can't leave without getting the pizookie- warm fresh baked cookie pie topped with a scoop of ice cream."
Mira P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",264,268,1341,3.0,5/17/2016,"Food is mediocre, service is slow... But if your on a budget I can see why this place would be suitable. They only thing I like is there is no corkage fee! Thank god we brought the wine to deal with our slow experience."
Ashley B.,"Chicago, IL",7,3,1,4.0,2/16/2017,"Good beer, great outdoor seating, and a large menu. Definitely a chain and not a local business, but if you're looking for somewhere to hangout in this area this spot will do."
