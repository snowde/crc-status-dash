Flor M.,"Country Club, FL",24,9,30,2.0,9/19/2015,"Good atmosphere and service but anything in the menu besides the pizza is not that great. Do not attempt to have steak. Be careful with the healthy options too. Just got the North Beach Mahi Mahi and Shrimp from the ""BJ's enlightened Entrees"" and it was a fat soup.  The dessert is good. ... And clearly management doesn't care most of the food sucks!  (see comment below)"
Dania M.,"Miami, FL",0,23,13,4.0,3/26/2017,Food was very delicious they have lots of healthy options. Very nicely decorated and nice staff. I gave only 4 stars because the wait was terrible. It took about 40 minutes to receive our food. Other than that was awesome
Dawn P.,"Hollywood, FL",0,4,,2.0,3/5/2017,"Went here last year during lunch and the service was extremely slow. But decided to give it another try.  Went for lunch on Thursday, at first the service started out great but that only lasted til we ordered.  We arrived at 2:15 and left at 3:45. We only have a hour for lunch. It took forever for the food and trying to find our server for refills was not happening. When we got the check, we had to hunt the server down as she busy chatting with 2 other servers. One of the servers saw me waving her down and just ignored it. Will not be giving this place another try."
Shelley J.,"Hollywood, FL",26,88,135,1.0,6/28/2015,"My attorney chose this restaurant for a lunch meeting with me as neither of us had eaten there before. It was about 2:30 and in between the lunch and dinner crowds. We waited a full 5 minutes at the hostess podium before someone came to greet us. The restaurant is big and it was empty except for one occupied table. Having a laptop and some documents to review, we asked for a booth or one of the many vacant 4-top tables. The hostess told us no. I asked why. She said two people were only permitted to sit at the smallest table with 2 chairs. ""But the restaurant is empty,"" I said. She shrugged and told us that was their policy and we did not have to eat there. So, we left, had a lovely meal at Longhorn Steakhouse, and for my part, I will be sure to never return."
Jonathan D.,"Hialeah, FL",4,7,10,5.0,7/3/2016,"All four elements were happening in equal measure - the cuisine, the wine, the service, and the overall ambience. It taught me that dining could happen at a spiritual level."
Vanessa S.,"Hialeah, FL",159,34,6,5.0,1/3/2017,"Perfect for date night/family outing. I order the same every time I go (spaghetti and meatballs) and every time it taste just as delicious as the last. I'm not a big dessert person but my boyfriend could die for the cookie and ice cream dessert trio. Depending on the time you go the wait varies, but it usually doesn't take too long to be seated."
Mia R.,"Oviedo, FL",72,14,193,5.0,5/10/2015,"I rarely give 5-star ratings & although this place is pricey, it is by far one of my favorite restaurants!  FOOD:  So many choices, it makes it kind of hard to choose but I do appreciate that if you're on a diet, it lists it's healthy options under the title enLIGHTened, and includes the amount of calories each dish has! It helped me as I treated my mom out for Mother's Day but still stuck to my oath to eating healthy!  STAFF:  Overall, very helpful & very friendly. Whenever I go to restaurants, I ask the waiter/waitress what they recommend or what their popular dishes are and she had a few in mind but not too many to make the decision difficult.  Atmosphere: This is the part that got my 5-star rating! Usually in restaurants, they go for dim lighting, which I hate, because I can't see anyone, the menu or my food. They had a good amount of light and it was very spacious. I especially appreciated the noise level. I think the fact that the place had high ceilings helped but it was loud enough to make the place lively but not too loud where your table couldn't hold its own conversations, as most restaurants I have experienced. The booths, which is where I sat, were also very comfortable. They have 4-seaters & 2-seaters!    Overall,  This is the first place I've given 5-stars to & with good reason. Try it out, but make sure you got money to try it! Good for family outings, dates or just a casual lunch with friends!"
Nabeel S.,"Austin, TX",134,66,16,3.0,11/24/2016,"BJs has decent food for the price. Their pizzas are unique and pazookis are worth trying. Atmosphere is nice and craft/regular beers are matched to meals. Staff doesn't like picking up the phone within an hour of closing. I mean I wouldn't like picking up the phone either, but a job is a job and no one likes being put on hold and never taken off of it multiple times months apart. Just don't depend on this location if you're hungry late night and still within a ""fair"" to-go ordering window."
Israel G.,"Davie, FL",33,13,13,2.0,4/27/2015,"I've been here on a number of occasions and haven't had anything that wows me, but nonetheless the wait time at Bahama Breeze up the street was an hour at 11pm so we came here. No wait, was seated quickly. However, my waitress brought us our drinks and didn't come back for another 20 minutes.  My wife and I had the same dish, house sirloin. I had a side of potatoes and asparagus, which were made to perfection. My steak? Not so much. I was served a very disproportioned piece of meat, not cut in uniformed which made it over cooked and undercooked at the same time. No other place would dare serve a cut of steak like that, and for this reason my wife and I will NOT be returning to this establishment. Our 4th time here and haven't had a properly executed dish, which is a shame because the actual restaurant is a nice and fun atmosphere. Staff was friendly. But I need consistently for what they're charging, and none I've gotten. Sorry guys, no go for us at BJ's Brewhouse."
Tamsy F.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,20,10,5.0,11/23/2015,The food was scrumptious!  Fresh and full of flavor. :) We did curbside service which I didn't even know they had. It came in handy for me tonight b/c my daughter fell asleep before we arrived but they were able to bring the food out to the car.   I value customer service!  It means that much more to enjoy a meal AND great service.    Unfortunately these days it's a strange thing to see people greet and smile. It doesn't cost a thing and can truly make a difference.    Alexandria D. (#813) provided EXCELLENT customer service today.   Friendly and knowledgable.
Jovi D.,"Hialeah, FL",0,2,,1.0,1/27/2017,"The service is very slow, the waiter literally forgot that we were at the table and the apaetizer took longer than it should have to come out. Not the first time this has happened. My girlfriend almost slipped due to the floor being wet she advised a waiter and the waiter brushed her off and left the floor wet. Definitely not coming back."
Eric R.,"Hialeah, FL",76,14,2,4.0,7/26/2016,"Ok,  I've been coming to BJ's brew house for some time now there are some good points and some points that used to be better.  The service is actually pretty good.  The staff is attentive but often just seem tired and a little uninspired or bored.  That being said,  they are never rude and always make sure you are properly attended to.  The food is well done American fare with some Asian and italian influences that ranges from ahi poke to burgers to salads,  flat breads, pizza, pasta, steaks, seafood and everything you'd expect in between.  The food is always above average and has an average price range.  Drinks are actually pretty good.  They brew their own house beers that are always on the menu and have seasonal that they bring from time to time.  Aside from their house beers on tap,  they have a large selection of other beers on tap and even more in bottles.  They also have a good selection of wines and a full liquor bar to satisfy your every beverage need.  Another good thing they have is that they have embraced technology with free WiFi as well as having their own phone app that allows you to make reservations,  order food ahead of time and even pay your bill using the app.  If you do use the app,  do your wait staff a big favor and let them know that you paid with the app.  Imagine how horrible it is to get to a table to find everyone gone and not know if they paid or not.  Yes they have a way to check but it still is nice to prevent that moment of panic. If a customer walks without paying,  they have to pay for it out of their pocket. They also have a decent rewards program that gets you free appetizers or a discount based on the points accumulated.  I really enjoy their application. You can even see your running tab in the app if you know what your table number is which you can ask you wait staff to give you. You will also need this to pay with the mobile app.  Now to the not as good as it used to be part.  Their happy hour menu prices and deals have changed. Happy hour is from 3pm until 7pm but only in the bar area although they have made exceptions if the bar is full to capacity. The house beer gets $1 off sharable appetizers get $2 off when in the past these are appetizers were half off. There are also deals on their flat bread pizza. A great deal on Tuesdays is glasses and bottles of wine are half off all day which is the best deal you will find anywhere.  All in all,  it's a great place to enjoy happy hour,  a good meal both healthy as well as not so healthy and always good if not uninspired service."
Kaylee L.,"TX, TX",611,24,26,4.0,4/11/2016,First off this ifs the FIRST restaurant who gives you a pound of boneless chicken wings! Amazing !!!!! Best deal I've ever seen. I ordered the root bear glazed chicken wings with a side of blue cheese sauce ! DELISHHHHH. Similar to a bbq flavor. My boyfriend and I shared the wings cuz there were so many! Their drinks are off the charts!  I ordered a pink Cadillac Martini my FAV!!!  And a super yummy white peach margarita  I recommend this place !
Valberta G.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",96,120,262,3.0,6/30/2015,"Looking for a place to eat in South Florida is tough. Especially if you try to wing it. Then my boo saw BJ's. I completely forgot abut this place, especially being that I shop in the area lol! Upon entering the eatery you notice it is a big space. TVs around certain parts of the restaurant. We thought about eating at the bar but it looked packed. So instead we decided on waiting for a table.  After few minutes we were seated in a table for two people. Within a few minutes our server came immediately to the table. Man I was I surprised despite being it was Father's Day and it was pretty busy.  For starters we ordered the Crispy Calamari. It was lightly breaded, fried crisp and served with marinara and lemon garlic aioli. The calamari was just ok, little oily. The calamari to me was a little thin. For our main dishes, I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya which has blackened chicken, shrimp and chicken-andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce. Served over a rice pilaf and topped with green onions. Again it was not bad. Just the right amount. They sprinkle plenty of cayenne pepper around the plate so be careful. I accidentally stirred in some and it was hot! But flavor wise just ok.  My boo ordered the California Burger which is a half-pound patty served on sourdough bread, topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing. It looked almost like a patty melt but according to my boo it was just ok. Overall our experience was pretty good and again service was awesome. Seriously you get a little apprehensive of coming to a eatery when it is busy, people waiting outside and wondering how customer service will be.  Prices are so-so and we didn't get that wow factor with the food. Will we come again? Possibly."
Carlos R.,"Hollywood, FL",61,64,25,2.0,6/5/2016,"Came out to BJ's for dinner and drinks last night. It was quite a packed night as we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. It appears if you know someone there you get seated faster than others. A couple came in 10 mins after we got there and were seated right away. And no they were not there waiting prior to us. Anyway, our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The food portions are small. I ordered the deep dish pepperoni pizza. I ordered a mini size since it was only for me and it had 4 slices. When I got it, I thought I had ordered a kid's meal. $10 for 4 pizza bites. I tried their ginger IPA and enjoyed it. This was the only thing I liked the entire night. Our waitress did something I hate... it appears we can only stay in the restaurant if we are eating. Our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert and we politely said no. Two minutes later she returned with our bill. We never asked for the bill. Our drinks were still full so why did she do this, I dont know. Matter of fact, I ordered another beer after. I will return only because I enjoyed the beer and willing to give it another chance to try something else on the menu. Just hope its not kid's meal size."
Cheryl G.,"Hollywood, FL",24,21,39,3.0,4/5/2016,The lunch salmon with quinoa is great but stay far away from the so called deep dish Chicago pizza unless you want to have slow service and be served a replica of Pizza Hut. I'm from Chicago originally and this pizza is nothing like they make in Chicago.
Esteban X.,"Miami, FL",10,2,,1.0,12/2/2016,"More like a church than a brewery......no ambient at all, no music, service is good but servers need to learn to write down the orders instead of trying to memorize, as a simple sandwich (very very greasy) that includes fries, we'll it didn't, wings did not include blue cheese. wont go there ever again, if you need to take a nap.... dont go there either"
Santiago F.,"Miami, FL",58,3,,1.0,6/26/2017,"I would not recommend this place. This was my first and last time here. I was not seated, but instead was motioned to a seat by a waiter from afar. I had no menu and had to ask someone else for one, as the waiter had still not approached me after several minutes. Someone who looked like a manager asked if everything was alright and I explained that I wanted to order, but my waiter was nowhere to be found. He took my order, which involved a soup and egg rolls. The soup was brought over cold. I then had to ask someone else for napkins, as none had been provided. The egg rolls then came, but I again had to ask someone else for silverware since none was provided. Although there were only a few tables occupied, the waiter finally came over to explain he had gotten busy. I wanted to see what this restaurant chain is like and, well, now I know. No thanks!"
Janese B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",58,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Honestly this place  is a horrible place to eat at , the server was just as bad as the manger on duty. First off my food came out super cold so I sent it back to get warmed up and then I have bits of tomatoes in my chicken Alfredo . What in the world ? I tell the server who was already rude and manger comes along and says oh I can take it off ur bill and not do anything about it . On top of that in my lemonade was bits of scraps and it didn't even taste like lemonade with raspberry . I swear this place is a joke . If I'm going to pay 17$ for a plate of food wouldn't you expect it to come out right ? Smh ."
Dan C.,"Miami, FL",451,688,1237,2.0,1/12/2015,"I'll get right to my review.  Visually, this is a nice, big restaurant with a lot of people, and a lot of action. It is on the loud side and they have big screens displaying whatever sport event happening.  I did not visit the bar, but I hear they have a decent selection of beers on tap so maybe I'll come back for this.  Ordered the Fried Calamari as an appetizer. It came with marinara sauce and ranch dressing. These were really nothing out of the ordinary.  I ordered the deep dish pizza, the BJ's favorite, and it was not great. Thick breading and hardly any sauce and cheese. Every bite tasted mostly like dough. The ingredients were falling off the top for lack of sauce and cheese to hold them together. My wife ordered the Caesar Salad which was nice and full of dressing. She also had the broccoli and cheese soup on a bread bowl. This soup was delicious, mainly because of the sourdough bread bowl. The bowl has the top cut out which is toasted with butter and garlic, like a Texas toast.  Now, the waitress did not introduced herself and neither smiled at us all the time we were there. She kept our drinks refilled, but was in robot mode. I'm not sure if this place is always like this, or maybe because it was a Saturday night, but the food and the service was really not great."
