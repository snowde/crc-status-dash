Jeffrey M.,"Pensacola, FL",1,3,2,5.0,11/10/2017,"WE HAD A DELICIOUS MEAL I had the Prime Rib Dip with french fries, best french dip ever. My wife had the shrimp taco's, they were good, but she wishes she would have ordered the Ahi-Tuna salad. The best part of the dinner was the waiter, his name is Justin A. great server, and just a bright fun individual. We highly recommend asking for his section when you go. Happy customers Jeffrey & Caterina"
Traycie S.,"Honolulu, HI",18,19,66,2.0,10/9/2017,"This is one of my husband favorite and go to places to eat anywhere we travel.  He enjoys there pizzas and trying there IPA's.   This is our first visit to this location and was a little disappointed.  I ordered the Golden beet and arugula salad,(my absolute favorite salad) with a water no ice and lemon.  My husband and I ordered a Tavern-cut Garlic chicken pesto to share.  I requested all the chicken to be on one side since I'm a pescatarian(same as vegetarian but eat fish and other seafood).  I also requested them to add extra mushroom on it.  Now my salad was as always amazing and that's the main reason for the 3 star.  The tavern-cut... well it came out in a timely manner, without one single mushroom.  So they took it back and added my mushroom in my picture you can see for yourself there Wasn't any ""extra"" mushroom.  Since they had to add the mushroom after it was already baked it came back with burnt edges.   The water came out quickly but the lemon arrive 20 minutes upon ordering the water/food.  Our server Raymond came by right at the last slice to check on how we were doing.  Once the bill came our server Raymond didn't take off the special discount they had for the day with there deep dish or tavern-cut.  Now maybe Raymond was busy or new, but he was friendly."
John J.,"Pensacola, FL",6,75,17,5.0,8/12/2017,"Ate here a week or so back. Was the wife and I and another couple. GREAT selection of beer, amazing selection on the menu, and a great professional waitstaff! All of our food was quickly served, piping hot, and wonderful quality! Will definitely go back again! Sit in the bar area to take advantage of specials that only apply to that area. Went again last night. Had a small issue with the lentil soup. The manager was notified by our server and he came right over. Was very apologetic and took it off our tab and offered free deserts. THIS is great customer service. We were so full with our meals we didn't take the desert and asking for it to go seemed inappropriate. We will go back again!!"
Nancy C.,"Daphne, AL",16,62,113,5.0,7/19/2017,Service was great! We had the lunch specials. Deep dish pan pizza. Mild spice on the sauce good amount of cheese. I had the country fried chicken. The chicken was so crispy and the mashed potatoes were cheesey. The corn succotash was sweet. Try a pazookie for dessert! Warm cookie of your choice in a mini pizza pan and 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. 2 people can share. Ok prices too. It's a good chain restaurant. Good High end food for a chain.
Steve M.,"Milton, FL",0,3,3,1.0,11/3/2017,"Beer tastes great, guacamole and chips were good, entrees were horrid. I had the lemon thyme chicken and I've never had something so putrid in my life. Tasted like they dumped an entire container of lemon juice concentrate in the bowl. It was unbelievable acidic. My wife had the spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was mush, it had pieces of other types of pasta in the bowl, and it was very very spicy. I've never had pasta sauce like this before. Tasted like it had ghost chilies or habaneros in it. Needless to say I only paid for my beer and the chips. Maybe their pizza and ribs are good but I'll never find out."
Hollie P.,"Pensacola, FL",31,7,,5.0,12/8/2017,Love sitting at the bar and enjoying the friendly bartenders. The food is great. I order burgers without bread and am always satisfied.
Cori V.,"Spanish Fort, AL",15,182,325,5.0,5/17/2017,"We had a funeral in Pensacola Wednesday at noon. During visitation, many guests were reunited and wanted to visit after the services at a restaurant. I called BJ and explained the situation that I would need a reservation for 25 in about an hour.  The manager was gracious and professional. They had the left side area cleared and set for our party. The staff was incredible. The service was quicker than expected for such a large party.  We had drinks quickly then appetizers, kids food, and appetizers.  Several drink orders (alcohol and other) special request (more napkins, mayo, sauce, etc) Every order was correct. Every guest was happy with the food which allowed them to enjoy each other and remembering our lost friend/family member.  Thank you for providing such great service, food, and drinks to our last minute get together!"
Kristen B.,"Daphne, AL",1,7,15,5.0,9/6/2017,Service and quality of the food was Ah-mazing.  My BF and I wanted somewhere to watch the Alabama game and they let us sit to watch for as long as we wanted.  The waitress kept refreshing our drinks even as we sat long after we had finished our meal.  She was not at all put out that we were just taking up a table in her section.  So we did our best to make up for it in tip.  I recommend the Prime Rib.  It is out of this world good.
Sarah Y.,"Jessup, MD",3,91,46,5.0,4/15/2017,"I really enjoy this place. Chill atmosphere, huge beer selection, attentive wait staff, and awesome food. They have a big menu. So doesn't matter if you are in the mood for seafood, burgers, pizza or even pasta. They gotcha covered. Reasonably priced. Just make sure to get here early on the weekends. They fill up fast."
Caleb M.,"Woodridge, IL",100,5,,5.0,11/11/2017,Very impressed with the improvement over the last year. BJs has figured out how to deal with the rush and their food/service has improved significantly. I can attest that the bartender Maleah absolutely crushed it and nailed every aspect of the restaurant experience. Great job!
Nikki L.,"Atlanta, GA",59,57,61,5.0,5/15/2016,"This was my first time here and it was a great experience!! We ordered the chicken  bacon deep dish pizza and it was so delish!! I found a special on Yelp so we got the medium pizza, 2 salads, 2 sodas and 1 dessert to share. All for $25--the drinks were an additional $1 each!! Lauren was our waitress and she was attentive,  knowledgeable of the menu and she has a great personality!! I will be coming back to BJs when I come back home."
Lorri D.,"Dallas, TX",52,123,251,3.0,6/26/2016,"First impression - They're newly opened and aren't yet operating as A CRAFT team. I sat at the bar since I was alone and ordered my ole' favorite Hopstorm (so glad it's here now). Yes it took a few minutes to receive service, but that is to be expected by a new staff, although the bar was only half full.  As I sat drinking my lovely craft beer I happened to be right in front of the POS and watching Crystal try to operate it gave me anxiety!!  The couple to my left and abd the couple to my right, who both arrived after I did, were asked for food orders (one couple had to initiate the order) while I sat waiting to order...my beer finished I co  I haven't seen one smile or welcoming gesture so far..."
Ty T.,"Crestview, FL",67,24,57,5.0,5/19/2017,I was in town for business and decided to try this place out. I sat at the bar and the bartender had a great personality and made great drinks. She gave me a great first impression of this restaurant. I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. It was tasty. I would recommend this restaurant.
Paula P.,"Pinellas Park, FL",214,36,69,3.0,4/29/2017,"I was not impressed by the food or service here , and it was really mediocre. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken, and it was alright, kind of bland. The presentation wasn't very good either. It looked like something I threw together quickly at home.  My appetizer was amazing though! I had the spinach stuffed mushrooms, and the sauce the used in top was delicious.As for dessert, I order the beignet topped wiyh strawberries and ice creams which was okay as well. I would day a 3/5. I do like going to the Bj's closer to where I live though because I feel like their food is better. Overall, I would come back just not to thus specific location."
Traci H.,"St. Charles, IL",26,9,,2.0,11/12/2017,"During our travels through Pensacola we found this nice restaurant nestled on the street corners of disappointment and regret. A true meaning to ""all that glitters is not gold"" for a turd rolled in powdered sugar and sprinkled with Pixie dust is still unfortunately a turd. I originally ordered their Prime Rib special. On a positive note, at least all roadkill does not go to waste. I ordered a house salad with ranch, the easiest thing on the menu and received a dry bowl of weeds. The famous Pizookie was even nearly uneatable being over cooked. Don't order the snickerdoodle unless you are up to a cinnamon challenge. This once great go to restaurant has seen a serious downturn. There are too many other good and great restaurants to return to overpriced mediocre."
Robin M.,"Pensacola, FL",0,2,1,1.0,6/15/2017,"Love the menu, but... The place is way too cold.  We waited an hour for our food (the kitchen is always backed up). The wait staff kept trying to bring things we had not ordered.  One friend was served the wrong meal.  And the kicker? One friend had the bonus of a piece of a razor blade in her over cooked salmon!"
Terry G.,"Pensacola, FL",187,147,91,4.0,7/1/2016,"Though a friend and I went relatively early (430pm on a Wednesday) the place was already starting to get a good number of customers.  We were quickly shown to a comfortable, clean booth and given a menu that gives The Cheesecake Factory menus a run for their money.  This menu is big and it's got a little bit of everything. I enjoyed the BJ's Stout beer and my pizza.  The pizza was perfectly cooked, deep dish, with fresh veggies and lots of cheese.  Perfection.  In fact, so much perfection, I had to take half of it home in a box. Our server was quick, attentive, and answered any questions I had.  She did warn us that the steaks and ribs are hit and miss.  They're known for their pizza and beer, not their steaks.  I was happy to hear a server be candid and not try and up-sell at every turn. Looking around, the burgers and pasta dishes looked pretty darn good, too.  There's a dessert, called a Pizookie that's a pizza/cookie covered in ice cream made by angels.  They even have a monkey break Pizookie.  I didn't have room for it this trip, but I guarantee that I'll be back for at least one, as long as my doctor doesn't find out."
Rick A.,"Pensacola, FL",41,42,47,3.0,7/3/2016,"Sadly, I am a little disappointed.  It is a beautiful restaurant.   Our waiter was prompt and attentive.  The food order was correct. However,  the gluten-free pizza was compared to cicis (not flattering). I had the ravioli.   A beautiful dish that is pleasing to the eye and possess a fantastic aroma that comes from a great sauce.   There was a copious amount of cheese crowning the dish.  However,  this artistry was ruined by the chalky consistency of the filling.  Bottom Line:  It is not worth waiting for a table--sorry."
Keith Q.,"Milton, FL",88,13,15,5.0,9/25/2016,"I visited a second time.  The first visit was not so good.... this visit was great. Savannahs J. was our server. Beer was cold, food was great, service was fantastic. Redemption has occurred and we are now believers."
Georgio B.,"Pensacola, FL",16,363,55,4.0,7/6/2016,"3 Visits in and I'm still a fan!    The apps are the star of the show here!  Load up on apps, skip the entrees. Spaghetti & meatballs was lacking in sauce, but otherwise okay. Bloody Marys are awesome!   Piranha Pale Ale was darn good too. So far, so good.  Let's see if they can keep it going."
Pete K.,"Milton, FL",17,11,1,5.0,5/14/2016,"I love bar food. Greasy wings, cheese sticks and urine colored American beer.  If that is what you want, don't go to BJ's.  I had the grilled Ahi salad and I am not going to lie, best salad ever.  The sesame-ginger salad dressing set it off. Here is the thing, servers moved quick, they were well organized and skilled in team work. My waitress(don't they still call them that?) was as beautiful as she was motivated. overall a great experience.  I am definitely going back for their honest to goodness deep dish pizza."
Ryan B.,"Pensacola, FL",96,17,16,3.0,10/31/2016,"BJ's has the right idea. The beers are actually, quite good for a chain restaurant. Their menu has plenty of options to choose from and every time I come the food is delicious. I've tried a few of the appetizers, including the avocado egg rolls and chicken pot stickers; both very good. For my main dish I've had the Cobb salad, flat bread pizza, and tonight I had the Jambalaya, on the recommendation of my server. All very good. However; I was a little uneasy about the price of the jambalaya. How corporate can justify 17.00 for chicken, andouille sausage, rice, and seasoning, is far beyond me.     My next issue, which again is at the corporate level, is the floor plan. Well, what does that have to do with a Yelp review? Wait times. Service is so slow because the bar and kitchen are so far away, from over half of the seating area. If your server has over 2 tables, expect very slow service. That is a lot of walking back and forth for them to do; so I try to keep that in mind when I'm there.     All in all, great food, good beer, decent service. I'd recommend BJ's to Pensacola residents; if you're visiting from out of town, find a smaller local restaurant with less wait times and a more unique dining experience."
Gus E.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",27,116,17,5.0,4/1/2017,Pretty good vibes. Huge bar. Mushrooms were amazing. Had the blackened salmon and the wife had the spaghetti. Very tasty and filling.  Great waitress. Will be back!!
K S.,"Navarre, FL",0,2,,4.0,7/7/2017,"This is now my favorite restaurant here in Florida.  The menu has lots of variety. The food we ate was so good I had to let you know.  Our server, Jessica H, was professional and courteous. She was great."
Jillian A.,"Navarre, FL",0,2,3,5.0,7/6/2017,"Had late lunch/early dinner here yesterday with a few friends. We were seated immediately and our waiter, Johnathan, was quick to bring us drinks. The food was delicious, as well as the pizzookies. I usually hate any type of Mac and cheese but their creamy-couscous macaroni was absolutely amazing! Our drinks were never less than half full and our waiter was always on top of everything we needed. I could easily see this place getting super busy and slammed but we had great service around 4-5 pm on a weekday."
Nadia S.,"Livonia, LA",0,3,,5.0,6/30/2017,Great Restaurant with a wide variety of foods and drinks. The lighting sets the mood and it's exceptionally clean. Management is on top of things! Some waiters are more observant than others. One guy named Raymond is a really good waiter! He asks tons of questions to make sure he gets the order right and makes sure you're getting exactly what you want! I also recommend that any mashed potato lovers get the white cheddar potatoes! They are really good!! Really nice place! I will definitely be back!
Katie S.,"San Diego, CA",25,4,,4.0,3/27/2017,Stopped by on a Monday for an early lunch. Service was great and kept our drinks filled. I had the grilled ham and cheese off the lunch menu. It was awesome and made this girl from Wisconsin happy with the cheese that was melted over the sides. Good choices on the children's menu. I would definitely recommend this for families!  Didn't try any of the beers but they had an awesome selection on tap.
Toya C.,"Pensacola, FL",3,319,1742,3.0,1/29/2017,"The hubby wanted to try this place out so we did.   We were greeted and seated immediately.   Our waitress was nice but sparse throughout the meal.  I had found this deal for baby back rib Thursdays which offered the meal and a free mini pizooki.  So I got that and it came with a salad as well.  The hubby ordered pot stickers for appetizer and a chicken dinner.  The little one got grilled cheese and fries meal.  I did not like the pot stickers they were doughy and tasted undone.  The hubby never got his drink until the meal was served because we never saw our server until then after she dropped off the appetizer and salad.  The salad was really good and fresh and cool.  My dinner was okay.  I got ribs, rice pilaf and broccoli.  The ribs were the best part of the meal.  The rice pilaf was dry and tasteless.  The broccoli had some weird seasoning that the hubby and I both didn't like.  The litttle ones meal was good though.  We ended up eating some of her fries - lol. I did get the free pizooki and that was the best part of the meal.  I got the cookies and cream one.  It's a small pan with the warm baked cookie and a scoop of ice cream.  It was delicious and a nice way to end a fairly boring meal.  The hubby ended up getting the trio dessert meal and he got the regular chocolate chip pizooki, monkey bread and oreo.  He enjoyed the flavors of them all.  Overall the food was subpar.  The dessert was the star of the meal. I would return for the dessert alone."
Carlee J.,"Milton, FL",80,19,62,5.0,2/3/2017,I had the calamari and it was delicious. Sitting at the bar at 11a.m. and service was great on a Friday. Our bartender Sean was amazing and showed me a little bartending trick! Had a great lunch and the bartender was amazing. Great drinks and awesome food!
Thomas C.,"Jacksonville, FL",24,58,1,4.0,6/11/2016,"I generally don't enjoy chain restaurants. They're stale and unenjoyable experiences that make you wish you had stayed at home.  BJ's flies in the face of that feeling. It's a vibrant and open restaurant with a nice menu, good food and a cool atmosphere that is enjoyable.  At the time of this writing the restaurant is still fairly new to the area only being open a couple months. I imagine they're starting to iron out some of the opening problems that other reviewers mentioned as I didn't experience any of them.  We were seated quickly and our waitress was attentive throughout the meal. We had fried asparagus that had a nice flavor and kept its crisp bite after cooking. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. Not a dish I normally order anywhere, but I was feeling froggy and jumped. It was really nice and actually had a good little bit of heat. My wife had a seared tuna salad and enjoyed it.  Overall, if you're looking for a good meal, decent beer and a lively atmosphere then you won't go wrong with BJ's, despite it being a chain."
William A.,"Pensacola, FL",48,15,3,4.0,3/12/2017,Andrya was an awesome  server she was at our table at least five times. The food all looked great and everyone at our table of seven loved their food. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends. My only complaint would be that there were two ketchup bottles at our table and both were empty. If you are going to take the time to go get ketchup for your table at least make sure it's full when you bring it to the table. The cooks did a great job preparing all the food and it was all brought out in a timely manner. The restaurant including the restrooms was very clean. Thank you for the great lunch!
Jonathon R.,"Pensacola, FL",22,1,,1.0,10/22/2016,"This is by far the worst restaurant in town when it comes to service. My wife and I have eaten here several times and the service level is always abysmal regardless of the day or time of day. If you want to spend two hours with more than an hour and a half wondering where your waitress is, this is the place for you!  If you can tolerate poor service, endless waits, non-caring floor managers, the food is actually decent.  This is one place to avoid in Pcola."
Phil A.,"Milton, FL",4,63,146,5.0,5/22/2016,"I can't stand reading people's reviews on chain restaurants.. Especially when the restaurant is actually really good and doesn't deserve a poor review. Reading through these comments I saw a ""grown man"" who gave a 2 star review because he didn't like that they had a revolving door.. 1. If $14 is an expensive meal to you, please stay home or go to Mcdonalds. 2. You can't say in a review how you realize they just opened yet your upset that they are busy or fine tuning some aspects of their business.. Off my soap box.  The ACTUAL review: My wife and I used to love going to BJ's back in the DC area, and were so excited when we heard they were opening up a BJ's down here! We have so far gone to this new BJ's twice, both times during peak hour, and the wait times were not anything more than to be expected. The staff were always very friendly, and admittedly, for how many tables our waitress had the last time we were there, my wife and I were surprised she even attempted to chat with us!  The calamari was cooked very well and the seasonings were very good. Whenever I go without my wife I get the Avocado egg roles (wife is allergic to avocado, what a shitty thing to be allergic to?) if you have never tried them, I HIGHLY recommend them! We also ordered their ""hard"" root beer which was very tasty! My wife and I both order their Deep dish pizza every time we go and like to try different ones; we haven't found one yet we can honestly say we didn't like. The BJ's Classic is an everything pizza which is always fantastic, and the Mediterranean is great if you enjoy olives, artichoke, feta, etc! My wife and I rarely, if ever, order dessert at a restaurant, but I definitely recommend trying a pazookie (how you pronounce that silly word, I have no clue.) If you can't decide on one flavor you can always just get the trio and try three different flavors!  The prices aren't over the top, but apparently people in this area find a $13 meal to be outrageous..? If this is truly outrageous you can always get their coupons on your phone for $10 off or half off pizza on Mondays Etc.. If you don't want a wait, don't go during peak hours..? Common sense things here people.. But, if you don't like a restaurant that has a revolving door and you want to cry about it, you probably just suck as a human being in general.. BJ's has great food, an AMAZING selection, and a great drink selection as well! Definitely recommend you trying it out!"
Richard Z.,"Foley, AL",2,6,,4.0,3/10/2017,Stopped in after picking up relatives at the airport. We decided to stop in at BJ's because we'd eaten there before and had good success. BJ's came through again. There food is consistently good. They have decent beer. All round good place to eat.
Miranda M.,"Wetumpka, AL",21,58,79,5.0,7/4/2016,"Came in on July 4th because most places were closed at 9pm. The waitress Sarah Rene was really friendly, she kept the drinks full and we didn't have to wait long to put in our order or to get the check when we were finished. Food was great, we ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and a pulled pork sandwhich. It came out hot and quickly. Plenty of food leftover for tomorrow, didn't have enough room to try a pozooki even thought they looked tempting enough to try."
Jose R.,"Whittier, CA",9,1,,1.0,11/27/2016,Zero stars because it was absolutely terrible. It took 10 minutes for them to take our drink order. 30 minutes to take our food order. And 1 hour and 20 minutes total to receive our food. The server only checked on us twice the entire time. Im still here sitting waiting for the check and we have now been here a total of 2 hours. If you come here on a date do not plan on doing anything after because we missed our movie but waiting on this server. All of our food was cold by the time it got here. Never coming here again.
Chanda O.,"Lafayette, LA",100,37,,5.0,5/17/2016,"I have been to several BJs restaurants. The service has always been terrific! Tonight was no exception! Natalie G is terrific. Your menu is huge. I always have a tough time deciding. I didn't want eat too much because I wanted to leave room for dessert. Natalie G suggested an appetizer, (calamari). That's what I had! I had a pizzookie for dessert! The service was great. I did not feel rushed, but I also didn't want to sit around forever either. I will definitely be back. I will also recommend her and BJ's to friends!"
Rita S.,"Colchester, CT",0,9,,4.0,2/2/2017,"Good stuff...pizza flatbread, ahi poke appetizers in restaurant plus white pizza to go was great on a Thursday 2pm. Waitress, Cheyenne, very accommodating & sweet!  Brought lots of Dr. Peppers and then my 2 go pizza without chicken as specified.  Food good and even did dessert which was yummy.  My husband liked the beer selection."
John S.,"HURLBURT FLD, FL",86,5,,1.0,4/22/2016,"BJ'S (basically jail)  We waited for 2 hours even having reservations, then water for 45 mins for food that was soggy and cold and 20 minutes for just water! We where there for a total of 3 hours!"
Chiquita L.,"Douglasville, GA",3,63,146,5.0,6/24/2016,We were here earlier this month for lunch after a graduation ceremony. We had a large group. The staff was friendly and very organized in handling our large crowd. I had an AMAZING steak here. It was perfectly cooked. I was very happy and will definitely return when in town. My calamari was great as well. Everyone in my group of 20 was well pleased with their meal.
