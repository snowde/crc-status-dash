Marianne K.,"Pensacola, FL",66,33,12,3.0,4/25/2016,Service wasn't the greatest but it could be because it just opened. The server seemed very distracted and didn't even look at us. But again that could be because it was opening brand-new. The food was delicious
Bob P.,"Pensacola, FL",14,6,,2.0,7/23/2017,"I would have given the place a better review, however, @$6.50 a beer they get knocked down a star and a half.  The menu was pretty good with lots of choices, almost too many.  We have found that when you have too many choices, the food begins to taste the same no matter what you get. The portions are good and the calorie count HIGH.  I had the Ziti and it was 1400 calories.  I don't normally look at calorie count, but when it's posted, Yeah, I look.   I give it a $$ for food and $$$ for beer and wine.  The place get 3.5 stars for roominess and atmosphere.  A lively sports bar kind of setting with a long bar and lots of sitting area within the bar area."
Dennis D.,"Pensacola, FL",0,13,41,3.0,9/19/2016,"This is one of my favorite restaurants, but on this visit, I was disappointed in the service we received. My wife and her cousin from Japan ordered pizza, while I got a sandwich with fries and a Ceaser salad. Never got the salad, no ketchup for the fries. Everyone's drinks were empty half way through the meal, no refills, no waitress. Not the level of service I've come to expect. And to make matters worse, this was the very first stop after leaving the airport with our Japanese guest. I was embarrassed, as this was her first trip to America."
Jennifer W.,"Milford, DE",82,3,6,2.0,1/9/2017,"The service was wonderful, and that's about where it ended. The food was lackluster and boring, even for a chain.  The drinks were terrible.  Their top shelf Margarita was a joke.  If you're looking for nice service, good atmosphere and good beer, it's a nice place.  If you're looking for good food and a nice cocktail, this isn't the place."
Matthew S.,"Mobile, AL",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2017,Over priced tgifridays. The food is ok at best. The management is clueless. Also the root beer is non alcoholic so don't let that fool you. The only reason I would recommend this place is to complain about the meal and get it free. This is all the management at bjs was helpful in doing after a terrible experience.
Shawn F.,"Miramar Beach, FL",30,24,15,3.0,7/3/2016,"Impressive atmosphere. Seems like it's still trying to get some legs under it but has potential. Was overwhelmed by the huge menu. Had a bit of choice paralysis. Got the deep dish pizza, and it was pretty good. Jeremih red was a good pairing with it as well."
Tiff C.,"Pensacola, FL",193,489,3211,4.0,7/25/2016,"So this is my 3rd time eating here and I must say I really like this place. We went yesterday on a Sunday afternoon, although there was only a 15 minute wait we decided to eat at the bar since we saw a few chairs open. Marissa the bartender was super cool and made the best Alabama Sunset(yes that's a real drink in the south) I've ever tasted. My bf had one of his weird beers he likes to drink(don't know the names of any of them) and we both had sandwiches for lunch. I had the California Chicken Club which consisted of Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and roasted garlic aioli on grilled sourdough bread. When I say it was good, I mean this sandwich was GOOOOOOD!! The skinny fries were nicely seasoned and all and all a nice lunch. Sometimes I hate eating at  a bar  in a restaurant  but for some reason the setup here at BJ's makes it not seem weird or annoying being that close to other creatures. Make sure you use your Yelp App as you get either a free appetizer or a free pizookie.. We got the free pizookie of course! This place is starting to become my favorite 9th Ave spot."
Annie W.,"Pensacola, FL",22,16,2,3.0,10/12/2016,3 stars for service and 5 for food quality. Went at 8 on a Friday. Slow server never refilled our water but asked twice if we wanted more beer rounds.
Michael C.,"Navarre, FL",4,12,9,5.0,9/30/2016,By far my favorite chain restaurant in Pensacola! Great beer. Reward here and really good food. Always my go to spot. Relaxed atmosphere and I love the booths in the bar area! Definitely recommend this place!!!
James D.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",0,34,,4.0,5/3/2017,Recently ate at BJs with the whole family.  Service was excellent.  We had a bunch of entrees and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I had the full rack of ribs with pepper bbq sauce.  Pretty darn good.  Best part was that salad and soup were included with no extra charge as southern sides.  The other entrees of note were the burgers and rootbeer wings.  My daughter loved them.
Autumn B.,"Pensacola, FL",229,53,30,3.0,9/5/2016,Ambiance is good and you can actually hear each other talk even though it's crowded. Burgers not very good so go with aomething
Jess G.,"Pensacola, FL",7,9,,3.0,11/15/2016,"Good food and nice atmosphere however the service is terrible. We have come here several times, always had good food but very slow and poor service."
Rick B.,"Pensacola, FL",1,23,,4.0,6/6/2016,"First time there on a not busy Monday evening. Waiter was very attentive, appeared moments after we were seated checking on drinks. They have a very extensive beer list including some brewed in their own brewery in Texas. I had a nut brown ale, which was well done. My guest had a amber which was OK.  Allen stopped by a couple times while we were perusing the 13 page menus. It had the beers, and wines as well as food.  They have a few appetizers and soups, two different pizzas, thin and deep dish. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, steaks, pasta and deserts. Oh yea and quinoa bowls, and a kale / Brussels sprout salad. There has to be something for every one there.  We had the thin crust tomato basil mozzarella pizza for $13. I wasn't sure it would be enough for two so ordered a  hickory BBQ burger with BBQ pork and bacon and a meat patty. It came with shoestring fries, again about $13.  The pizza was tasty and plenty for two, the frys were crisp and not oily. We ate those two and brought the burger home. Dinner with tax was $40 and we over ordered.  Nice place, not too noisy, decent food. Lots of TVs with sports.  I'll go back."
Des D.,"Pensacola, FL",0,25,23,4.0,6/6/2016,"This restaurant deserves a decent review.  I've read about BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, mostly on the National Restaurant Association's website, and mostly concerning their financial success. Because I've never seen one, or heard much about it, I haven't given it much thought. Having been there now I must say I am impressed. This is a very nice place. It has a modern, upscale, gastro pub/sports bar environment. I didn't see any children, and honestly it's not a place for children. There is a children's menu and I'm sure they are welcome, but right off the top it looks and feels like an adult establishment. We went on Sunday night at 6:00. The parking lot was full and I assumed there would be a wait, but I had no idea how large this place was inside and we were seated immediately. (There was a wait line when we left.) There are tables, high tables, and booths. The very first thing you notice when you come in is the bar. It's massive, and the colorful lighting is beautifully striking. The back wall is covered with their beer offerings. If you are a beer connoisseur there's enough to keep you busy for days. BJ's has their own handcrafted beers, there are locally crafted beers, there are micro brews, there are seasonal beers, flavored beers, and quite a variety of German ales, stouts, blondes, etc. When you are seated they hand you a menu which looks like overnight reading material. The first 6 pages are all alcohol related. They serve everything. From a wide variety of appetizers, to steaks,  pasta,  seafood, ribs, sandwiches and burgers, you will find something to eat today, and want to try several more items on future visits. The food is nicely executed and impressive. There's no doubt that you are in a 2016 restaurant that keeps up with the trends. In 1978 BJ's was originally a pizza restaurant in Orange County, CA. so it's no surprise that the menu includes an entire pizza section. They specialize in Chicago style pizza. We didn't get the pizza, but saw a lot of it coming out of the kitchen, and it's something to try next time- maybe a small one as an appetizer.  The prices are reasonable, rivaling chain restaurants like Applebee's and Chili's, but slightly more costly. Personally I thought the quality of the food is much better and worth the price.  Do not go expecting an inexpensive meal, but it's not going to break your wallet unless you're adding alcohol to the bill. This BJ's location has been open since April. That has given them 2 months to work out their opening kinks. The restaurant was busy and bustling and runners were continuously taking food out of the kitchen. There seems to be no shortage of staff. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, and offered suggestions and favorites. She was also very busy, so when my adult son's food came out and ours didn't until 12 minutes later there was no one to tell. My server is my liaison with the kitchen. If there's a problem I can't go in and ask, ""Where's my order?"" I rely on her to do that. When she did show up she went to check on it, then told us she was looking for the manager, but couldn't find her. Like I said, the restaurant is very big and very busy so I wasn't surprised, but I did want this resolved quickly. I had ordered the pasta with jumbo meatballs, which was awesome, but not hot. Luckily, I like my pasta more warm than hot, however it should have been run to the table much, much sooner. Still my meal was wonderful. It was not Italian restaurant pasta, it was bistro- style with meatballs that were huge, handmade, and delicious. There was enough to eat, and plenty left over to take home. I would certainly order it again. My husband ordered the fried jalapeno burger and said it was good. My son's brisket burger was beautiful. I tried some of the smoked brisket on top and it was smokey, peppery, and delicious. Aside from the glitch with our order we had a very nice experience. I don't think we can expect the crowds to die down here. At this location I believe this is going to be a popular place in Pensacola. To minimize the wait there is a BJ's app. with"" Preferred  Wait."" I didn't use it so I don't know much about it, but it's worth testing. We will go back, there are lots and lots of menu items I would like to try. The steak and ribs looks amazing, and the monkey bread with ice cream will have to wait.  Oh, and they did take my meal off the price of the ticket."
Dana L.,"Maggie Valley, NC",1,3,,5.0,6/24/2016,Love this place. Will go back. Best jalapeño cucumber margarita in town. Meal was devious service was great.
Ralph C.,"Pensacola, FL",7,84,5,4.0,7/14/2016,"Great place, food is good, beer is cold customer service is great and clean outside the building. The outside of the building is the first thing people see, so I always rate it.  If the outside is dirty, what's there kitchen look like. But BJs is the best,  been there 3 time and will go back."
Brittany C.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",30,5,1,5.0,6/8/2016,"I downloaded the Yelp app JUST to praise my waiter at BJs. First of all, BJs has a fantastic menu, from the wide variety of food to the eclectic choice of beers. Everything is wonderful. But Justin takes the cake. He is absolutely precious. He made our experience one of a kind. He made my mom feel very special for her birthday and gave us very personable service. I will ask for him every time I visit from now on. Come to BJs and ask for him, you will NOT be disappointed!!!"
Emily F.,"Pensacola, FL",98,51,8,2.0,4/21/2016,I have been to BJs in other cities. So we were excited to finally have one here. We decided to go on Wednesday April 20th at 7:30pm. We used the app to check in on the wait list before we got to the restaurant. On the app it said there were tables open with no wait. When we arrived we were told we were checked in and it would be a few minutes. We ended up waiting for a table for 45 minutes. After 20 minutes I asked the hostess how much longer it would be and was told 10 minutes. When I asked why I was told it would only be a few minutes they shrugged and walked away. There was a woman wearing a suit type jacket with several pins who was obviously the trainer since it is opening week. She was very rude. If she is the one training the hostesses I don't have much hope for them.  Once we were finally seated the service was very slow. I know it's opening week so I tried to be open minded. But I had to ask for a refill three times and extra sauce twice.  We are loyalty members and we were never asked for our loyalty member number. I had to flag down the woman training our waitress to get her to add our loyalty number to our table.  Everything we ordered was great. Pizzas and burgers. Of course the pizookies were the best part.  Overall the food was good. But the experience was horrible. Maybe they'll get it together after a few weeks.
Rick H.,"Pensacola, FL",0,6,,4.0,5/15/2016,"Not sure why so much hate in the other reviews.  We've been twice since they've opened about a month ago.  This place is still ""settling in"" (you can tell the wait staff is still tense and being broken in). You will want to be patient because of the hype of a new restaurant in town.  As for the food, the deep dish pizza is great.  Their in house brews are pretty good (the jeremiah red is strong as hell).  I would highly recommend locals or folks visiting mutliple times to download the bj's app to avoid wait times. You can log into the app and get on the wait list from home! In short, it's a decent chain restaurant witu good brews and a huge menu but be patient when randomly showing up there."
Shay C.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,22,,5.0,7/14/2016,"My family really enjoyed eating here! The service was great and so was the atmosphere! We had the beer and pizza, which is what they seem to be known for and both were very good! Also, my girls loved the pizookie, which is the name of the dessert! We didn't realize it was a chain until our waitress told us! We would go back for sure!"
