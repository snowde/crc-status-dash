Tony T.,"Pensacola, FL",45,4,,2.0,1/2/2017,I have had nothing but outstanding service and great house brews but the food has just been very mediocre to me.  The menu is huge with lots of choices which I feel could be a contributing factor to the food quality since it is difficult to do everything well.  I do agree with another reviewer in that it seems like the salads and appetizers are better than the entrees.
Andrew V.,"Pensacola, FL",23,5,2,5.0,4/27/2016,BJ's has really stepped up their game since opening. The service is much better and the food is still delicious. They have a military discount so the price was just right.
Roland W.,"Milton, FL",8,2,,4.0,5/13/2016,"I have experience this restaurant while station in San Diego. It was as greatas a remember.m, the food,drink and service was awesome. It's a little pricey but sometimes you should treat yourself."
Patrick M.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,3,,1.0,11/28/2016,"I had the seared ahi tuna salad. The salad looked like it was made a week ago. The tomatoes and cucumbers were rotten. My biggest complaint was that there was barely any tuna served with the salad. Less than 1/2 of that pictured on the menu. I paid $16 for rotten vegetables and 4 small pieces of tuna. Skip this place, there are many better options in Pensacola."
Luke A.,"Pensacola, FL",1,11,1,1.0,4/30/2016,"I imagine the food is good, when you actually get what you order.  Maybe it's just a rare exception that I found our waitress to be unprofessional."
Kelljor S.,"Cantonment, FL",0,90,52,4.0,11/19/2016,"To begin with, it's really nice to have this restaurant here. Now....the menu is a novel. It's ridiculous to make a choice over 100's of items. If you are smart...like me...Google the menu the morning b4 lunch. That way you will have an idea. spaghetti is dry, asked for extra sauce and was brought a little condiment cup, requested more and another cup brought. The server apologized n said the cook said she couldn't get anymore. I AM THE CUSTOMER!!!"
Yen Đ.,"Pensacola, FL",19,2,1,4.0,6/29/2016,"It was our first time being there and it was crowded. It didn't take a long time for our server to come. She greeted and recommended us the food. We ended up choosing the beef, salad and calamari. The salad was $5 and the salad was barely full of the dish. It was only a few spinach leaves, small chunks of tomatoes and few pieces of eggs. We also asked for ranch to put on top but honestly the dish wasn't worth $5. The beef was kinda dry but it was ok; it also came with the shrimps dipped in the cheese but we couldn't eat all. The only food we liked was calamari. It was soft inside and crunchy outside so we finished all."
Stephen H.,"Pensacola, FL",34,22,3,3.0,5/13/2016,"It's decent. A huge menu, probably would be better food if they cut down on the items. Nice decor and the waitstaff was attentive. It's a new place and you can tell. But a good option over the usual chain restaurants,  looking at you applebees and chili's. The brews are good, and a fair amount of tvs. Would consider sitting at the bar for GameDay over Ale house or twin peaks. All in all decent new spot in town. I'll give it another shot in a few months, once the new wears off."
Casey D.,"Pensacola, FL",250,7,16,4.0,5/4/2016,They are new so the service is a bit slow. The food quality is great. We are here for round two so hopefully the speed and accuracy improve.
Eldrick W.,"Pensacola, FL",116,2,,1.0,5/3/2016,The service was okay but the food was lousy I will not waste my money on this garbage the menu is 16 pages which is overkill. The calamari was greasy and undercooked sent it back not much better the second time. The jambalaya was awful will not return.
Branden T.,"Tacoma, WA",34,1,1,2.0,6/12/2016,"Small portions, and one of our guests got their food 20 minutes later than everyone else. They also forgot the baby's order. They don't sing happy birthday but they do give free desert. The spaghetti was really good. Large menu with lots of different food and beer. That is all."
Melanie C.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,,2.0,10/27/2016,The food was decent but the waiter in the bar area Davon was horrible. Had to wait over thirty min to get our drinks while we saw them sitting on the bar and having to ask numerous times. Part of our order (the dinner portion someone ordered) took almost an hour to get. I believe the server forgot about it. If you have a lot of time to kill this come here but if you don't or if you don't want to be frustrated when you leave save yourself the trip. This is the fourth time in a few months we've been here and it's like this every time we go.
David K.,"Pensacola, FL",55,20,,2.0,10/23/2016,Service very slow and the waitress kept making excuses.  Food was fair and I felt overpriced for a hamburger that tasted like a frozen patty.  But hey ... I should know better ... it is a chain.
D C.,"Pensacola, FL",0,10,4,2.0,5/24/2016,"This place has a great environment, but the good experience stopped there.  We ordered potato skins, salad, and bacon cheeseburger. Potato skins and burger were greasy. Two of the three orders came out incorrectly. Happy hour only applies at the bar. The price was too high for quality of food."
Lauren S.,"Pensacola, FL",157,4,1,5.0,5/13/2016,Kara B. was great! Definitely would come here again. The beer sampler was worthwhile!
Earl P.,"Pensacola, FL",22,1,,5.0,5/8/2016,"Great food, with lots of choices. Menu includes healthy options as well. Staff was friendly and quick, even on a busy holiday weekend. Definitely going back."
James B.,"San Diego, CA",3,19,4,2.0,5/6/2016,"So I arrived at the establishment on a Friday evening and placed my name on the waiting list for a party of 2. 40 min wait, cool. The hostess mentioned that I could grab a beer while I wait so I did. Ordered a beer from the bar, asked the bartender if I could take it outside and her response was ""you're not supposed to but it's okay"".. Well apparently it's not ""okay"" because one of the staff members told me I can't have my beer outside after I was already outside drinking my beer (keep in mind the lobby is packed with people). If it's not ""okay"" then your BARTENDER should not tell people it is. Got seated, the waitress didn't know much about the menu from the two questions I asked. Ordered a ""queso dip and chips"" with equated to warmed up velveeta cheese with some chopped up tomatoes on top. The cheese tip at Taco Bell is better. Don't recommend. The food arrived within a reasonable time considering how busy the place was. One side item was left off of one dish because they ran out of the item, but it was replaced with a new one. Portions were average, food flavor was bland, and temperature of food was warm. Overall, it was an ""ehhh"" experience. For $38 for two people (two entrees, a beer, and app) I wouldn't recommend. Nothing great, and definitely nothing waiting 30+ minutes for. I probably won't be going back with so many other better options around the same area."
David G.,"Hampton, GA",2,5,2,2.0,7/21/2016,Went in on 07/20/16 at around 1030pm. Very nice place and not very crowded at that time. Waiter came to the table right away and explained the menu and made recommendations. He took drink orders and returned with water and cola. Bar drink order took much longer.  Once all the drinks were empty he came back by and asked if we wanted more. The food arrived and again the bar drinks were slow. Waiter came by once we received the food and asked if we needed anything.   I just asked for the drinks. He left our table and walked over to another table where he stood and talked while we went without drinks.  I walked up to the bar myself and picked up the drinks that had been sitting on the counter waiting on him.  One of my party's dinner was delivered to the table in a takeout box.  Why is that? I don't know he said haha.  Food was mediocre at best and service was the worst!!!  And yes I paid for the drinks I had to serve to my own table.
Shawn M.,"Pensacola, FL",0,1,1,5.0,6/7/2016,"I love BJs and this location is just as good as the original restaurant in Santa Ana, CA. Their deep dish pizza and house brews are great."
Sarah R.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",14,3,,5.0,5/28/2016,"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat tonight. Sat at the bar, Matt and John were both pleasant and had great recommendations. Struck up conversations with everyone and had a crowd of regulars which is awesome! Baked Ziti was delicious! Boxes given at appropriate time and pre-bus was spot on! Check was readily available at all times as well."
