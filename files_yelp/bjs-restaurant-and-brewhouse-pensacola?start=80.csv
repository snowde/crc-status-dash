All  food ordered was good, spaghetti with Italian sausage,  ahi salad was good.  Calamari : (,   :, so not good . Greasy, overcooked, the beignet dessert with strawberry  took forever, longer than our food.  Mgr was nice and offered talk of bill, we compensated to take off the calamari.  Overall good experience.  Kaysi our waitress was very friendly nice.  Thanks."
Cynthia G.,"Pensacola, FL",21,45,6,1.0,4/24/2016,"I love BJ's but not this one.  I understand it's opening week but the service was terribly slow.  I hope they get it together as I really enjoy all the BJ's in California.  When calling to make a reservation they did not explain it wasn't a reservation but basically getting on a waiting list, this was extremely misleading especially being that I have a baby.  The hostess needs people skills, I understand some are new but one that seemed to be training her needs people skills as well.  We were there for 3 hours so not cool.  The avocado egg rolls did not taste the same.  We tried the brussel sprouts and they were so salty we had to send them back.  The ahi tuna salad was perfect.  When we ordered our Poozoki we waited for 45 minutes.  The waitress hardly came around and kept forgetting our drinks.  I hope in 3 more months they get it together.  Ps. The bar service was amazing.  Drinks were good and the bartenders were very attentive and personable.  The bar area gets 4 stars and the restaurant 1 star."
Kristi W.,"Pensacola, FL",1,16,1,4.0,7/16/2016,"So I absolutely love this restaurant, we've been several times and never had a bad dish. I've been getting the gluten free pizza lately, which to be honest reminds me of a frozen pizza..but don't let that throw you off.  It's like a good version of a cheap pizza I grew up on, I love it. The only complaints I have, which I'm so hoping will be fixed with time (since it's new) is the time we have to wait for the food and drinks to be served, and how cold it is in there. I'll be honest the last time I went, it was a great temp, but the other times..I've been frozen..and I don't get cold often. I think that the design of the restaurant is what is leading to some of the wait times being so long. Although I did mention that it takes too long to get food and the waiter said there are some issues with the kitchen staff (apparently attitudes). We've been when it was busy and when it was slow, still had to wait longer than normal to get our food. I do think some of the waiters are just really inexperienced. The previous time we went we had a great waiter named Zac. I do think the menu is way too overwhelming but oh well, at least there's variety. We use the app every time, we've used it to be put on the list, and there's a ton of deals they send to your email. All in all, we'll be back. :)"
Terry K.,"Navarre, FL",0,3,,5.0,5/27/2016,"This was our first time here, and we really enjoyed the experience. There was a large selection for food and drinks, and the wait staff was friendly. The food was delicious, I ordered the cherry chipotle salmon.  It was tender and flakey with a good amount of spice, but not overwhelming."
Sophie M.,"Pensacola, FL",0,2,,2.0,6/3/2016,"I've been to BJ's many times when I used to live in Gainesville, FL and loved it... every meal I got there never disappointed. We were so excited when we saw that one was opening up here but were very disappointed after our first visit. I ordered the balsamic glazed chicken and the meal would have been good if they used a better quality of chicken. It was so gross, hard to cut because it was tough/chewy, dry, and like stringy almost. This is a bummer because everything I love at BJ's includes chicken. It must be because they get their meat from somewhere else than the Gainesville location but they need to fix that or it may even be frozen. My fiancé had the pulled pork sandwich and wasn't a fan, it was just okay. We did order the mini pizookie trio because you can't go to BJ's and not get a pizookie and they were still as delicious as ever. Service was okay, atmosphere and look of the restaurant is nice- just like any other BJ's."
Tam G.,"Pensacola, FL",0,5,1,4.0,5/23/2016,"Service is a little slow up at the bar, but I haven't had any food that I don't like yet!  Love love this place."
Amanda D.,"Swansboro, NC",0,100,,4.0,5/22/2016,"Went back for dinner and the food was great too! Good portions at reasonable prices and good bar food. You can leave your number and go to the mall if there is a wait & you don't want to wait around in the restaurant - they were pretty accurate with how long the wait was. Great service as well, our waiter was very friendly and they were handling a busy Friday night well."
Nick A.,"Pensacola, FL",0,12,,5.0,5/18/2016,"This place is great. Friendly staff, great food and fast service. I will be back and trust me I'm pretty critical on places considering I work at one of the best restaurants in Pensacola"
