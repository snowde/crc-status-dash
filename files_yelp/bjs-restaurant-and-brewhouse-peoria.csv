Ryan A.,"Surprise, AZ",216,111,118,4.0,12/12/2017,"Solid service and extensive menu... The menu is a book! I mean, literally, it's 20 pages long. I would normally complain and say a restaurant should specialize in something, but in my 4 visits, I haven't had anything that was good.  Burgers, salads, flatbreads... even pasta, all were solid.  Only reason for four stars is because it feels a little too-""chainy"" but that is unavoidable. Certainly a step up from TGI Fridays and Applebees, but the over the top menu and decor just don't do it for me. Service has always been exceptional and the facility is perfect for large parties, prices are competitive, and I will definitely be back, especially when I cannot decide what I'm really in the mood to eat!"
Bryan F.,"Phoenix, AZ",179,216,178,3.0,12/5/2017,"So, this was an interesting experience.  First of all, I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants with massive menus.  Now, that being said, the experience was OK.  I had the spicy pig, which was good, but made incorrectly.  When asked to fix the order, the waiter brought back the same, burnt, flatbread with the added topping, uncooked, place on top.  Now the topping was only pineapple, so there was no issue with this being raw.   My server was nice, but I have to say my table was shocked when we found out he had been there a year.  He was very wrinkled and did not seem to know the menu well.  He brought me back my flatbread in that condition and then asked if it was OK or if it should be remade.  I just feel that it was not the experience I would expect from a high end Chain."
Christina N.,"Glendale, AZ",41,16,9,5.0,12/2/2017,"This has become my new favorite restaurant! Our waiter, Ruben, was one of the best waiters we have ever gotten. He was completely honest with us on the orders and was always super attentive. Now to the food, oh man, it was great! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs the first time and I honestly thought the portion would be small considering it is small in some other places, but you really get enough for what you spend. My boyfriend got the Southern Comfort and now orders it every single time we go. I also tried the chicken alfredo without broccoli and it was delicious! I loved the fact that the chicken was not as dry as some other places. I also tried the boneless buffalo and was not disappointed either.  The pazooki was the greatest part though; if it's your first time and you have a sweet tooth, you need to try the Pazooki!  If anything, Tuesdays are $3 Pazookis!"
Efren F.,"Tolleson, AZ",276,15,9,5.0,1/5/2018,"If your are celebrating something, or not BJ's never disappoint. Food and service is always on point. I really recommend you download their app to get a free pazookie. Pazookies are the best desert they offer. Pictures attached are lemon thyme chicken"
Erin P.,"Glendale, AZ",9,98,48,5.0,11/27/2017,"My friend I recently came here for a ""cheat"" meal. They have great healthy options as well, but boy they sure did satisfy the cravings we were having for some delicious food!  We started with the extreme pepperoni flat bread. It was so good! Crispy crust, two different style pepperonis! It wasn't too greasy and it was quite large.  We then split their crispy chicken sandwich! That bun.... It was so light and airy! It had pickle and the best honey mustard sauce ever. The chicken was so crispy! Last but definitely NOT least was dessert. I can honestly say that I have found my new most favorite dessert ever. Drum roll please...... The peanut butter smore cookie was the absolute best! It was a chocolate cookie with peanut butter and then toasted marshmallow on top!!!! Oh. My. Gosh!! It was so sweet but I couldn't stop eating it! It was SO SO good!  Just dreaming about it now makes my crave it! I can't wait to go back!!"
Debbie T.,"Glendale, AZ",46,110,,4.0,9/3/2017,"I have to admit, we've been to this restaurant once and weren't fans.  However, we noticed they had a ""We Deliver"" sign up, so decided to order delivery. Everything was wonderful...from the easy online ordering to the friendly driver, Rochelle, to the really nice packaging of their delivered food. Also, the food was still hot and very good!  My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, I had ordered the prime rib sandwich, which was supposed to come with creamy horseradish...there wasn't any.  But, it was still tasty and I ate the whole thing. We will definitely order from y'all again...it was a pleasant experience all around."
Jeanie R.,"Avondale, AZ",0,1,,5.0,1/10/2018,We celebrated Grandpa's 88th birthday and had a delightful time. Our server Garrett was attentive without rushing us. We'll visit again.
Jennifer W.,"Chandler, AZ",0,47,8,3.0,1/6/2018,"Ordered avocado egg rolls and a meat pizza. Something was off with the egg rolls. I couldn't place it, but they didn't taste like they usually do. I wouldn't order them again from this BJ's. They should be consistent, but something from this BJ's was off.  The pizza was decent. Had no sauce on it, which made it dry, more like a breadstick, but the flavor was ok. I ordered without bacon, and it was made correctly, which I appreciated."
Chad P.,"Avondale, AZ",43,12,24,5.0,8/18/2017,"This place was great. Wait time was only about 20 minutes on a Friday night. Our waiter Steve was a friggin rock star. Always came by to check on us, offered his opinion on some of the foods we were curious about. Steve was amazing at his j.o.b. I highly recommended this place to friends that live near.  The appetizers were great, we had the avocado spring rolls and the calamari. The drinks were amazing; I had a strawberry blast and the little lady had a bahama mama. The main course! We both had different styles of fish tacos but they were fantastic. And then a little dessert, man that thing was tasty, a little on the small side but that's ok. It was great.  We will definitely be back to this location."
Brittany C.,"Glendale, AZ",738,193,740,5.0,1/21/2017,"Love BJ's Brewery! Always a great selection, casual atmosphere, and amazing service. Went in tonight with the family before the coyotes game. As usual service was great. Quick on re fills, food came out perfect, and very friendly. Food was delicious and I love the presentation of the food. They really care about their customers.  We started with the buffalo wings and calamari. Their wings are my favorite. Their buffalo sauce has so much flavor and not too hot.  Got the ribeye which was delicious especially for not being a steakhouse. My family got the prime rib sandwich, buffalo chicken grill cheese, chicken club, and jambalaya. Everything was amazing!  Highly recommend for any occasion. Great for families, date night, and friends. There is something here for everyone. Can't wait to come back!"
Deni G.,"Avondale, AZ",1594,714,1996,4.0,7/13/2016,"Something for Everyone I've been to a handful of BJ's Restaurants and have never been disappointed with my dining experience. However, the BJ's Restraunt and Brewery in Peoria is my favorite.  BJ's has high ceilings, long bars, mix of tables and booths, and large flat screne TV's within viewing distance of all. I can honestly say, I truly enjoy the ambiance at BJ's. The menu at BJ's is varried, offering a large selection of beers, cocktails, and entrée's, there is something for everyone at BJ's. If you can't find something at BJ's to eat,  then you don't like to eat.  The burgers at BJ's are delicious and one of my favorite entrée's, but if burgers are not your thing, BJ's offers plenty of other options.  The Thyme-Lemon Chicken and Steaks are amazing and grilled to perfection, with a  a bit of char, tender, and so flavorful. Service is reliable and well-timed. The staff is very accomdating without being intrusive.  Table or bar seating are all good and their to-go service works well, too.  If your looking for a nice dining expeirence give BJ's Restraunt and Brewery a try, you won't be disappointed."
Taylor S.,"Birds of Paradise Neighbor, Glendale, AZ",77,9,,4.0,12/5/2017,"My friends, family, and I all love this place. The food, the choices, and it's clean. The service however is often terrible. This location has been there a long time and it was amazing for years. The past year has significantly declined with friendliness and your waiter/waitress checking on you or never bringing what you ask. I really hope they get new management or employees soon."
Devon R.,"Hamilton, Canada",10,56,1,4.0,11/29/2017,Pizza was delicious as always! Had a very friendly and efficient server. Overall great visit
chris b.,"Peoria, AZ",18,24,,5.0,11/11/2017,Went to bjs for veterans day had a free lunch.  Always have a good time here.  Julia was the bartender.  Very nice and attentive.  What a sweetheart.  Military discounts year round.  Good happy hour and great beer selections.  Great pizza and burgers.
Nicole R.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,71,46,4.0,12/12/2016,"Came here on Saturday for a late lunch with a group of my girlfriends! We spent about two hours there and our server was top notch! Patient enough to let us chit chat but still attentive with refills and orders. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad and it was fantastic! Chicken was moist and all the flavors blended really well together. The group of us split the appetizer combo platter and... please stay away from the avocado rolls. They are mushy and just about flavorless. There is no contrast in texture... adding chicken or corn or anything in addition to avocado would have truly elevated the roll. Now... on a serious note desert. The seasonal snickerdoodle pizookie is FANTASTIC. Now, I swore whenever I came here to always get my favorite classic, chocolate chip. But, the girls forced me to try something new and I now have a new favorite! The flavor is out of this world, and when combined with the ice cream, dare I say.. life changing. lol. Do yourself a favor and order this!"
Thomas F.,"Glendale, AZ",2,54,6,5.0,6/8/2017,"I have been here a few times and every time Is a pleasure. I love the burgers here however they do have a huge menu with something for everyone. This is more of a bar/restaurant vibe which means it is pretty busy and loud but the food makes up for that.  Let's talk about beer... they have it all! They have a wall full of taps and kegs all over the place. If you cannot find a beer here that you like, you simply don't like beer.  Whether you are looking for lunch, dinner or just a drink, you cannot go wrong with this place."
Scott B.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",91,59,87,4.0,5/30/2017,"This would be a weekly stop, except it's an hour from my house.  This is upscale atmosphere, design, and cuisine!  I can't wait to go back for the many things on the menu!  Every day of the week they offer an amazing special 1/2 price pizza on Monday.  But wait!!!! The pricing is ridiculous....seriously, for what you get.  Can you say the words ""impressive"" and ""value""???  Dine on my friends."
Tiffany J.,"Chandler, AZ",31,16,3,2.0,8/12/2017,So I decided to go to this place today and why I was not happy at all good was cold and let me tell you the food took forever and for it to come cold was not good I don't know if the kitchen was backed up or what but it sure showed with the slow past on how the food came and to be cold was the worst my kids hated there food my son Mac and cheese was cold daughter burger they forgot the cheese and my niece didn't even eat her mini corndogs I give it a 2 due to that my server was great and atmosphere is cool but the kitchen suck I wanted to order dessert but that made had took a long time and my be over cooked so I didn't probably will not be back
Denyse M.,"Slingerlands, NY",66,80,31,2.0,7/4/2017,"On a week long happy hour hopping experience -visiting 10 spots in the pheonix/scottsdale area, this place rated #10, last. Really disappointing - especially after having come from yard House and Roaring fork - this place - the pizza tasted like a kids meal, price was same as another restaurant yet half the size. Was thankful for a good champagne split. Wings were okay nothing great - good bar if you want beer and TVs, wouldn't recommend it otherwise and definitely wouldn't spend money on a full price menu."
Jonathan H.,"Mesa, AZ",4,10,2,5.0,6/9/2017,"Love this location! This is one of the few spots in this area my wife and I actually frequent. We are huge fans of the orange cream soda, classic root beer, and avocado egg rolls. Every meal we've had has been a good experience with the excellent staffing. I believe I saw a sign that said BJ's now delivers? Very stoked if thats right."
Kristine F.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,17,3,2.0,7/21/2017,"Usually I enjoy visiting BJ's but this time was the worst. I ordered the California Chicken Club, which is the same thing I order every time I come but this time the avocado on my sandwich had the color of a cooked mushroom. I understand if an avocado has a little brown, but to mistake it for a mushroom is really bad. Very disappointed in this visit and not sure if I'll come back as the quality has gone done tremendously.  Gave two stars only because the waitress was good."
C H.,"Avondale, AZ",0,38,8,4.0,5/26/2017,"Generally this place is pretty crowded. We came about 5:30pm and had a 10 minute wait (which didn't seem long at all, considering the large crowd).  Our waiter seemed impersonal and distracted but his service was adequate nonetheless.  BJs has a large selection of food and beverage. I had the pink Cadillac martini which was more fruity and less vodka-y than expected. But still good!!   I enjoy the wide variety of menu options, and that despite the crowd, we're generally seated in a timely manner.  Our waiter could've been more outgoing but no major complaints."
Sara B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,7,1,5.0,10/21/2017,"Service is always perfection...my favorite thing is how big the menu is, you can bring the whole fam in and everyone will find something they love. The consistency of the food is always great, I've never had a bad meal here."
Maria M.,"Avondale, AZ",48,82,337,5.0,5/26/2016,"Their 2 for $25 deal is amazing! It happens a few times a year. Ask for Amber, she is real cool.  I love their BJ's Favorite Pizza with jalapeños instead of olives. I also love their Cesar salad. Their Hickory burger is delicious! Their Jeramiah Red beer is to die for! That's what keeps me coming back!"
Charles M.,"Sun City, AZ",0,4,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Are you kidding me, went here thinking the reviews are allright, wrong the food is really disappointing. Not good at all, gave it a couple of tries. I'm not the pickiest"
Iliana F.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/25/2017,"I want to give a shoutout to April, one of the managers who took my catering order. She made it a breeze to order and was sensitive to all of my questions. Thank you April!!"
Bryanna T.,"Long Beach, CA",37,251,401,5.0,7/22/2016,Bjs is the bomb. I've been here so many times with so many different crowds. I've never had bad service any time I've come. I always get the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with no sun dried tomatoes and extra sauce. I've been here for brunch too and lol its not that great and the mimosas are SMALL.  So my review is not for brunch it's for staff and service and dinner. Also the pazookies are amazing. My friend Nathan is obsessed with them for good reason :)  Come to Bjs
Carolyn L.,"Surprise, AZ",110,46,29,5.0,10/15/2016,First time there for birthday party. It was fun and busy!  We had a group of 11 and they fit us in the middle of the dining room. There are tvs with sports on all over which is great!! Our server was Tony and he was awesome!  Ask for him. He will take care of you. He was attentive and personable.  The menu was stacked with different types of food. The prices were reasonable. We had the chicken Pesto Pizza. Delicious!  Others had different things off the menu and everyone raved.  Parking is hard to find but that's because this place is amazing. The secrets out.  Enjoy! And remember as for Tony's section!
Chris N.,"Peoria, AZ",0,16,20,5.0,7/21/2017,Get the Mediterranean Pita Tacos (you can have chicken or go vegetarian) so good!!! I came here last night and got them for dinner and came back today to do it again. They have added some new iced teas so that makes me happy and their beer selection is always on point
Mark C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,18,69,5.0,9/2/2017,"OK I know you can't tell by my reviews, but I regularly eat here. Tonight I overindulged! I absolutely had the BEST Prime Rib that I've had in the last five years. It may seem a little on the high end but it was the best!"
Tony P.,"Peoria, AZ",22,45,25,5.0,4/13/2017,"Wow, what a great experience our server Jillian was very friendly, prompt and attentive to our needs. The menu has a great variety of choices at reasonable prices. The decor is very modern and clean. The food was served promptly and hot.  This is a must try restaurant the desserts are fantastic and you must try the home brewed soft drinks if spirits are not consumed."
CheRich R.,"Peoria, AZ",34,76,118,4.0,1/10/2017,I came here my my hubby bday. We came for dessert and both were delicious. They cookie was fresh and chewy. The ice cream was delicious and added to the cookie made it amazing
Krista L.,"Glendale, AZ",26,45,37,5.0,7/15/2017,"We really enjoy the amazing food. The menu fits anyone's appetite.. salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes to homemade pizza. The selection is great too!! I like the crusted Parmesan chicken!! Great take option too."
Daniel S.,"Sedona, AZ",0,2,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Okay we are dining at BJ's. What a shocker. They use to have a very good Bloody Mary  not this time. They changed their tomato mix too sweet and not spicy . We sent it back. Bartender said oh yeah we switched suppliers. Then our food arrives shrimp taco were fish tacos , lettuce wraps appetizers came with the Meal. Waiter did ask for our frequent diner number. We will hit the yard house next time"
Megan M.,"Youngtown, AZ",35,4,,5.0,8/5/2017,"The server was friendly, the food was great and the cocktails were amazing!  Mac & Cheese Couscous and the strawberry mojitos are a must!"
David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,4.0,1/9/2017,I've eaten here now about 1/2 dozen times. Consistent. Nice staff. Reasonable wait times when busy. Burgers are all tasty and good portion size. The rack of ribs is giant and very tasty. A lot of meat. The pizza cookie - still can't get over that they own a trademark I was convinced was owned by a local Italian restaurant - is mighty tasty. I like the Ghirardelli one the best of all of them.
JR H.,"Glendale, AZ",0,16,,1.0,1/10/2017,"WOW! BAD EXPERIENCE AT ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS! Came in on a Tuesday night, 7:30pm, Table for 2. Im told there's a 15 minute wait.(Open tables everywhere) Kind of unusual for a Tuesday but we assumed they were short staffed and decided to wait. 25 minutes later we were seated. We ordered an appetizer, a side salad and 2 burgers. App took about 15 minutes and was only slightly warm (Stuffed Mushrooms).  We ate the app and finished, then waited....and waited.....and waited. Server walked by and would smile but nothing. So we waited.....and waited....for a side salad mind you. After 20 - 30 minutes of waiting I approached the server and told her we needed to leave and asked her to please adjust the bill accordingly. So we wait.....and wait.....and wait....then guess what shows up... the side salad at the same time as our entree's. (Same server had both burgers and the salad). 45 MINUTES AFTER WE ORDERED Told him the situation so he took the food back, left 14$ on the table (we added the price of the mushrooms and our 2 sodas + tax and a lil on top just in case my math was off) and left.  Over an hour wasted all for some sodas and stuffed mushrooms. I wont be coming back, and this was one of my favorite places to eat. Real shame..."
Jo C.,"Peoria, AZ",1,3,,5.0,8/21/2017,Love Love Love this place. The service is always great and the food....... delicious! My favorite place to pop in and enjoy and meal!!!!!
Mary P.,"Peoria, AZ",1,8,1,5.0,6/24/2017,Had some random troubles doing online delivery. Called the store and spoke to the gm! April did completely everything she could to resolve the issue. Super sweet! Offered to deliver the food herself! Zero of the gms I know would never do this! Shows a lot of character! Super happy with the way everything was taken care of!
Phelisha C.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",138,60,64,5.0,5/5/2017,Came into BJ'S as I wanted a salad. I'm eating alone great atmosphere. The bartender Brad is the best. I told him my eating situation and his suggestions was amazing. Thanks Brad for the great drink and food suggestions. Brad attitude was great as well. Adrienne was great as well very friendly even if though she was not my server. Thank for the great service.
