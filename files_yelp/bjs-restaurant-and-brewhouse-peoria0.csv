Niko S.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,6,5.0,3/25/2015,"We are on an excursion from the beautiful city of San Diego to the breathtaking Majesty of the Grand Canyon, and on our journey we found sustenance at BJ's Restaurant in Peoria off of Northern Ave. Once you get there it looks like any other BJ's, but in this particular location lies a hidden gem. Her name is Crystal, the waitress of your dreams. She was attentive, kind, funny, and knew her stuff. She simply looked around the table once and had an idea of what we may want. She noticed there was a gluten-free menu in front of my sister in law and immediately recommended gluten free treats, drinks and meals. My father in law is Spanish speaking and she was able to take his order and give him suggestions in Español. While taking your order, all of her attention is on you and nothing else, maximizing accuracy and ease of communication. After the orders were placed, she repeated all of the orders to each guest with clarity and precision. There was a mix up in the kitchen with our order and she caught it as soon as the order came out, she brought it to us as a complimentary dish to apologize for the mix up and begged our forgiveness for the mistake. Even in the face of adversity Crystal kept her head on a swivel and her eye on the prize. She conducted herself with poise and class. Everything was delicious, the drinks were cold and refreshing, and we had a great time laughing and conversing with not just each other, but with our gracious server, and new friend, Crystal. We will surely stop at this BJ's again on the way back to our beloved San Diego, and if fate will allow it, we will be granted the privilege of being served by Peoria's diamond in the rough; Crystal: The waitress of our dreams.  Ps. Try the Mediterranean Pita wrap..."
Kazi H.,"Phoenix, AZ",221,184,134,2.0,12/19/2012,"The place is nice. Service was ok. The waiter poured too much water where it splashed on the table and just said ""oops""... We got their deep dish pizza whth roasted garlic and fresh basil; Their definition of deep dish is thick crust, so that was disappointing. Their pizza sauce tasted like rotten tomatoes. yucky. I got the tomato bisque and I've had better tomato bisque in a student cafeteria. We also got their sample appetizer platter and I only liked their avocado rolls and their mozzerella sticks. The rest was just gross.  I don't recommend this place at all. Only reason they got 2 stars instead of one is because I liked the way the place looked."
Josh B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,7,,3.0,5/9/2015,If you like your table pre-bussed don't come here. Food was good. Service was okay. I cannot take having my empty plate sit in front of me for 15 min after I've finished. If you are busy...ask for help.
Timothy R.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,5.0,4/29/2015,Omg the menu at Bj's is so big & the options are incredible. I personally love coming in for dinner I just love the atmosphere at that time:) the management at this location is awesome they will go out of there way to make sure that you are satisfied no questions asked! Also the staff at this location is very kind always have a smile on there faces & ready to greet you as soon as you walk threw that windmill door. If you haven't tried Bj's at all or this location at that I highly recommend it :)
Jezel O.,"Goodyear, AZ",1,22,,5.0,9/5/2014,Love this place. Awesome service!  Food is amazing. Employees are awesome. Every birthday or event I always come here. The menu has such a wide variety. They offer a rewards program and you can call ahead and tell them you will be there soon and they will hold a table. Also I come here for the pazooki :)
Carol O.,"Prescott, WI",47,89,2,4.0,3/17/2013,"I have been here many times over the last four years of sunbirding here in the desert. I have tried many different things and with one exception have always been pleased.  The service is prompt, friendly and knowledgable.  The house chard is a generous pour.  Their cookie thingie - Pizookie I think - is dangerously nummy!   Some of my favorites here are the tomato basil soup, the shrimp tacos which I enjoyed last night, the vegetarian pizza in the Light offerings, the turkey burger and the fries.  Any of these are great!    I'd go back any time.  Always get great value for the money."
Leilani N.,"Youngtown, AZ",5,3,,2.0,11/12/2014,"I seated myself at one of the high bar tables, waited for my order to be taken for 20 minutes....no one ever came. I got up to ask the hostess if I had to place my order somewhere else, she stated that someone would be with me shortly. Another 3 minutes, still no one came. I went to the bar and asked if he would take my order or would I have to wait for a miracle from the heavens. Chicken was room temperature but the bartender was great. Not so sure if I will be visiting again."
Angela D.,"Glendale, AZ",18,4,,2.0,2/14/2015,"This did not thrill. Pork chops overdone, mashed potato glue, chicken fettuccine only so so, the burger was over done, the fried chicken was good per Lexi. Not a place we will return to. ;o{"
Travis B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",140,1040,30,4.0,1/2/2013,"i don't live in or near glendale so i have no idea what there is to eat near where we were shopping/staying for the day. after some google and yelp searches for places that had menu items we could eat, we settled on BJ's.  i've been to a BJ's before in southern california. it is good. a well-rounded menu and pleasant staff. they kept the water glasses full. we shared the lettuce wraps. the shrimp was well seasoned and cooked well. we also split the hawaiin mahi mahi. the fish was a little overcooked, but it still tasted pretty good.  prices are comparable to any big bar/food chain. i would eat here again."
Errol D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,28,10,3.0,8/15/2014,"Hmm. I feel a bit bad giving this a three-star, considering that I haven't tried their pizzas yet. I'll update it later if I come back to try them. I've been to numerous BJs over the years, and I know how their song and dance go: Order the pizza, order the pizzookie, and you're good to go - everything else varies. Well, I decided to go against that formula and ordered a beef dip. Which was actually surprisingly good, considering that I've ordered the same in a different BJs and it was so-so at best. So why in the world would I give this 3-stars and not at LEAST a 4-star? Two things: 1) The service was a bit... lacking. They seated us timely, they were /fairly/ friendly to us, and they got our orders correct. But you could tell that they didn't fully care. They were struggling just to keep their smiles on and their heads on straight. It was later at night, with closing hours coming soon, so it's obvious that most servers would be a little bit conked out by then. But still - it's no excuse. And it can affect other things. Such as the fact that they didn't notice that we didn't have utensils until we'd been staring at our plates for a little while. They didn't fully care for us other than for our orders and our general services. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but I do wish they wouldn't stare at us like we're 'just a job' to them. Again, though, it could just have been the time of the day and the events that transpired before we arrived, but still... it's what makes me remove a star. 2) The pizzookie was... okay. That's kinda' an atrocity for a BJs. Pizzookies are supposed to be soft and gooey (though slightly chewy) and absolutely delicious with the ice cream on top. This one kinda' stuck to the pan a bit more than usual... and was a little too thin in some areas... it was a hassle to eat, and not a mouthgasm as I'd expect. You can't make a pizzookie just 'okay', BJs! Other restaurants are starting to copy the pizzookie idea - you can't be skimping out on the quality! -1 star! Outside of that, everything else was lovely. If you haven't been to a BJs, come here and give it a shot. If you have been to a BJs, I'm sure you know a better one somewhere else. This isn't a bad choice, but it isn't an excellent choice. Again, though, I'm going to have to update this review if I ever come back and try their pizzas."
Heather J.,"Avondale, AZ",95,280,66,3.0,7/22/2013,"Went in for an early dinner and ordered the Pot Roast Sandwich. The vegetables came and were not cooked. They were raw, I ate the meat which was great. I told the waitress and she commented that that is pretty normal actually and offered to give me another side vegetable. I am glad that she did that but at the same time was a bit subdued by the fact that this was a regular thing for them. My husband enjoyed his chili burger loads. The drinks we ordered were very strong as well. This place is always busy but perhaps we ordered the wrong food for this place!"
Dave B.,"Peoria, AZ",25,4,,1.0,5/22/2014,They sat 27ppl at 2 tables around us shortly after we ordered.  Our waitress was way over whelmed to say the least.  Our drinks sat empty and we waited 45mins for our food.  Which was cold and obviously had been under a heat lamp for several mins.  No other waitress or manager helped.  Finally had to yell and waive one down to get some attention.  Food would have probably been good if it was hot...sucked bad.  Won't be back...
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,4.0,8/11/2013,Great customer service by restaurant management We had a unique problem that was readily taken care of by the restaurant manager; the staff was so accommodating Many choices of beers; full bar; the IPA was okay; I liked the blonde and I'm no gentleman Food was excellent I loved the jambalaya Fish & chips were excellent Great service by Frankie Loved the triple chocolate pizzooke (?)
Charelle A.,"Peoria, AZ",2,15,11,5.0,11/11/2014,"We had a wonderful lunch today. I had the soup(Broccoli, my favorite) plus a mini 1topping deep dish pizza & Jerry had a hamburger with skinny fries. They were delicious! Great service. As a vet, Jerry's lunch was free. We will be back again soon."
James M.,"Glendale, AZ",2,7,,5.0,12/8/2013,Me and my girlfriend come here all the time but we just went for her 21st birthday and it was amazing. Our server Ruben was playing along with everything we threw at him and bringing her drinks he thought she would like. The pizza is incredible. I recommend  the Jeremiah red if you like beer and don't forget to have a pizookie at the end! Bjs has never failed me. Always a joy
Brianna S.,"Peoria, AZ",1,42,3,4.0,12/17/2015,"I come here way too often with my family and friends. You could literally be in the mood for anything and go here. The menu is a tad too big for me, but if you can't decide what you want to eat when choosing a restaurant, you can choose from the huge selection they have. I stick to the few things I know I like here and don't worry about the rest of the menu. Food is pretty good, nothing to rave about, but it's better than most restaurants out there. The best dish I've had was a pulled pork burger as those are my two of my favorite foods put together. Would probably still go with a real barbecue place, but this sufficed for my hamburger craving. My favorite part is the pizzokies, though. They have so many different flavors in which I still have some to try, but the awesome thing is they have a pizookie the size of a large pizza. I had this one time with a group of friends for someone's birthday and with seven of us we couldn't even finish it! Definitely a fun experience and let us indulge for the night. If you drink beer, definitely a place for you. Their selection is huge and from what my friends have said the taste is great (I don't like beer so I can't be a contender in tasting). Overall, great place."
Becky S.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,17,,4.0,6/24/2012,"This place has everything, and you will not be disappointed....that is, after you finally get to sit down!  Unfortunately for those of us who don't want to wait to be seated, this place has been discovered by many, and there is often a good crowd waiting outside on the weekends. The good news is, it is worth the wait. I have been to this place several times, as it is close to my home. If you are the indecisive type, the good news is you can close your eyes and point to something on the menu and it WILL be good. Fresh salad greens and tomato/mozzarella salads are a welcome retreat from the romaine fare at other places. The fish and chips here is reminiscent of the traditional Wisconsin fish fry I sometimes miss. The burgers are great, the sandwiches never disappoint. A full bar with a great beer selection will leave you wondering at the end of the night how your bill ended up so high (oops).  Our last visit, we just sat at the bar and munched stuffed mushrooms with a pesto sauce - a steal at $4.50 off the ""small bites"" menu - and thai style wontons dipped in sesame. Supposedly the deep dish pizza is good, but I have yet to try it, since it looks like a meal that would feed four people minimally. One observation I've made is that this place, being next to Fleming's (a more pricey restaurant), leaves people confused in terms of attire. You'll see people their Friday-night-out attire, but there will also be a family coming straight from a baseball game, the kids still dusty in their little league uniforms. To me, BJ's has a dim, refined, date-night atmosphere that invites couples but is a great meet-up for business associates. Now, I'm a mom, but if you're going to bring the kids, please have them in decent clothes and on their best behavior. This isn't where you would choose to go for a ""food adventure,"" but it is the place you would take friends with diverse tastes in food and booze, or maybe the in-laws from out of town."
B C.,"Kingman, AZ",0,43,5,3.0,12/3/2014,"Nothing special here.  Expensive burger and fries place. Server Ruben A copped an attitude early on.  Never made eye contact with me and never thanked me for the business.  He was ""coldly efficient"" and I would not want him as a server again...and frankly there would not be a reason to come back anyway.  Since this is our 1st time here...you never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression.  Save your money.  Toby Keith's is just next door."
Shannon W.,"Surprise, AZ",279,8,2,4.0,7/4/2014,"A favorite date night place.  I had a hefe, the corn fritters and the deep fried artichoke.  Heaven in my mouth.  The only problem was our server was a tad spacey and repeatedly forgot my husbands salad.  Management ended up comping it since it didn't arrive until well after we finished eating, so NBD."
Gabe A.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,11,,5.0,1/9/2015,"We love this place, I am surprised there aren't more of them in the Phoenix area. Best fried chicken meal I've ever eaten at a restaurant. Cool atmosphere. One of my goto dinner spots. The wait can get a little heavy on weekends, but it's worth the wait."
