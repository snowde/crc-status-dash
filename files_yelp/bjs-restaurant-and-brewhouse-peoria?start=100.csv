Frank D.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,360,141,4.0,12/23/2015,"My girlfriend and her mother brought me here for dessert one afternoon after stopping by the new casino nearby. Out server, Nadia, was excellent. She was friendly, took orders quickly, and brought us refills of our drinks periodically.  The restaurant itself was crowded, but ordered and managed well by the staff. This is what set BJ's apart from other restaurants in my mind. They handled the chaos without becoming rude or having visible difficulties.  Overall, my dessert was spectacular (I had the double chocolate cookie with Ghirardelli's chocolate ice cream) and the service was great. I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this BJ's location. 4-stars!"
Annette C.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,20,521,5.0,12/23/2015,This place is great. First time here had a great time and excellent food. The pulled pork sandwich was seriously awesome! The calamari was fried to perfection actually it was the best calamari I've had on the west side. The beers were delicious couldn't have had a better dinner I will definitely make this my go to spot :)
Samantha D.,"Youngtown, AZ",23,23,11,5.0,7/17/2016,"My family & I come here often! Their Parmesan crusted chicken is delicious, as well as the roasted Brussels sprouts! The servers are always friendly & helpful with the menu. I enjoy their rewards program. The only down side is there is almost always a wait at dinner time. BUT worth the wait!"
Cathy H.,"Jacksonville, OR",22,2,1,5.0,8/17/2016,Had a great experience tonight! Our waiter tonight Joshua was so attentive one of the best waiters we have had lately  (he had no idea we had a bad experience here 3 days ago) food was good and the dessert was to die for. Glad we came back
Lisa R.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,12,,5.0,3/25/2017,The food was  good. The prices were reasonable.  Our server Kodie was outstanding she was knowledgeable personable and very professional. She made some outstanding recommendations about food and cider. No matter how good the food a reasonable the price it's nothing if you don't have a wonderful knowledgeable server we would come back for her alone.
Junior A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,18,165,1.0,5/14/2016,We came out for dinner for a birthday.... Had to wait 50min to get seated and the after getting seated no waiter came for like 15min or so .... Waiter after wait pass and not nothing .... This place blows ... Should have just went to Applebee's...
Ember D.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,5,,5.0,9/17/2016,Hubby and I have visited BJ'a few times now without disappointment! The menue is certainly not lacking and the service is outstanding! Perfect location for a concert at the stsdium or a day out on the West side. The french dip sandwich is a lunch must!
Rafael H.,"Peoria, AZ",115,13,,3.0,9/28/2016,"Good ambience and atmosphere with quality music,  quality chairs,  as well as great food!  Not very expensive at the same time."
Brian B.,"White Pine, TN",1,66,11,4.0,2/4/2015,Me and the wife went here for a Lunch/dinner date. The food was okay but the craft brews were awesome. This place is a little expensive for what you get but overall  good.
Jesse E.,"Peoria, AZ",0,17,2,5.0,8/30/2016,"We eat here semi-often as we live almost walking distance. Food is always good, service has always been great. The Take out is where I spend the most time in the restaurant and the staff is always really friendly and giving my kids some laughs and sometimes even free deserts if the wait is long or something on the order isn't quite right. Burgers and Pizza you really can't go wrong and I rarely try anything else!"
Terri Z.,"Round Lake, IL",38,67,8,3.0,9/8/2015,"It wasn't my favorite dining experience but it could just have been my choice of entrees.  I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  The meat was tough and the BBQ sauce did not tickle my palate.  It was too smokey tasting and had some kind of liquor in there that was too obvious.  I'm not one to send food back, but if I were, I would have in this case. My dining companion raved about the roast beef sandwich, so all is not lost. The service was flawless and the atmosphere just great."
Royce K.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,348,592,4.0,9/12/2015,this is our after work spot they are open till midnight on Sunday's the food is consistent and they have 10 different salades prices are what you pay for way better then applebees the service is average witch isn't a bad thing there drinks are to expensive for me and they are the inventors of the pieookie
Marina M.,"Peoria, AZ",122,212,89,4.0,5/18/2014,"Came here during lunch & were seated right away.  It was pretty busy but our server got our drink order right away.  We took some time to look at the pretty large menu & decided on getting something off of the lunch menu. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken & hubby ordered Buffalo Wings.  Food came out quickly & piping hot.  My chicken breast was delicious but very small, which I guess isn't a bad thing since it's just lunch.  The country gravy served with the chicken is delicious & their shoestring french fries are so crispy & flavorful! I think I could make a meal out of their fries & gravy, actually! We decided to try their pizookie sampler & chose peanut butter, oreo & salted caramel. Omg. I'm salivating thinking about those little pizza pans of awesomeness.  They were warm & oh so delicious. PB was our favorite :) When it was time to pay my husband realized he left his wallet at home, no biggie, I have mine...wait (digs thru purse)...no...no I don't. Crap. So we're sitting there & my husband says he will go all the way home & get it.  Luckily, I glanced over at the little BJ Rewards sign at our table & noticed it says that if you sign up for their rewards program you can pay your bill with your phone! Whoa. Talk about perfect.  So we did & thank goodness because I really wasn't looking forward to sitting at the table awkwardly while my husband went back home ;) We'll definitely be back for dinner & drinks because their beer & drink menu looked pretty neat!"
Kristy M.,"Glendale, AZ",126,2,2,3.0,7/13/2016,"Service was very good! Thank you, Hannah!! The value, not so much. Very light on the fish in the Mahi-Mahi fish tacos. The flavors were good although the the ""light"" fry was a little greasy. I've had other fare here I liked better. Also, seems to always be a little warm in this restaurant. I realize it's July but, come on, I don't need to be reminded of it while I'm trying to enjoy dinner."
Carrie P.,"Portland, OR",120,239,137,4.0,5/25/2015,"After having gone for the second time last night, I figured it was high time I get in here and talk up the Parmesan Crusted Chicken I've had both times.  The white cheddar mashed potatoes are worth an order of this dish!  Get yourself the Chocolate Raspberry combo drink with some stout and raspberry beer (I can't find it on their online menu, but check it out for sure).  It doesn't matter how many people have already said it...their pizookies need to happen at the end of your meal!  The peanut butter is always my first choice but their fancy salted caramel pizookie is good too.  We got the trio this time around and shared different bites with the whole table...if you're okay with sharing, this is definitely the way to go."
Kyle S.,"Chicago, IL",424,182,19,3.0,7/13/2015,"Odd service from an odd man. Not sure if he was overwhelmed or what but def odd. Even to the other guests around us. Everyone having to flag him down. This location has taken a habit to hiring old adults like Denny's would.  An odd direction to go in. Food was fine, flatbread, pulled pork, s'mores pizookie.   Beers cold and good. Service just odd.  We prob won't seek out this location like we do with the north Tatum location."
Dylan B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,5.0,1/28/2017,"I ordered BJ's for takeout, and was very impressed with the customer service from Julio and Jackson. I will definitey be returning in the future."
Melissa G.,"Glendale, AZ",59,7,,4.0,3/16/2016,My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and decided to try this delicious restaurant! its hard to pick what to eat everything just seems so yummy!
Had R.,"Phoenix, AZ",166,347,2496,2.0,6/28/2012,"The food as always was good, (extra star for this) but this location has terrible service.  Our party of 4 arrived and we ordered 4 drinks and one appetizer.  It was about 20 minutes for 3 of us to get our first order of soft drinks... 30 minutes had gone by the time we got our appetizer.  We tried to get our waiter flagged down but he was either no where or at other tables quite a way from our section.   We caught a passing waitress and complained, She was great, she took stock of what we were missing, and promptly brought us our refills and the beer that was ordered.  1 hour had past and now we had long eaten our appetizer and drank our drinks.  Our food arrived and was good.   Our waiter came over and apologized for the mix up, their computers had crashed.  2 of us ordered 3rd refills.   They didn't turn up, just the bill with the manager who apologized for the late food, late drinks, slow service.. but offered nothing in compensation.    The bills were wrongly split but we just exchanged cash between us and left vowing never to return.  I have been to BJs in 3 states and I have been to this location before, the service was never this bad."
