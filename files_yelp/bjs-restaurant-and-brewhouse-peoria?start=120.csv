Tony S.,"Aurora, CO",2,8,,4.0,12/17/2016,I go to this place all the time. They have good  tvs to watch the games. For happy hour they have good deals and good food. They have a rewards program that I use to get free stuff.
J K.,"Avondale, AZ",0,19,69,3.0,8/9/2015,"Average service, no one was really hustling to get people serviced. The food was really good. The deep dish is a can't miss item. We also had the classic wings. Try them dry, with the sauce on the side. You stay cleaner dipping in the sauce."
Anth D.,"Phoenix, AZ",101,33,7,4.0,7/1/2015,"After Flemings next door decided to close early before their posted hours and one of their employees rudely noticed us through the locked door, turned and walked away, well...  my wife and I were going to head back to Westgate where we normally hang out and celebrate our anniversary at another place known for brewing their own beers.   Being outrageously hungry and bored with their menu, we decided to give BJ's a try, and I'm glad we did.  First of all, the BJ's menu is an employee manual.  Loan document folder.  Car manual.  The thing is huge, and completely disorganized, and flipping through, I became frustrated at the randomness.  I sort of loved and hated it at the same time.  On the other hand, there's something for absolutely everybody in that massive encyclopedia of options, and it's unlikely that even the most ardent of loyal customers will get bored with the selection.  So... +1 on that one, because we'll probably be back a few times.    The deep dish pizza is about the closest thing I've had since leaving southside Chicago quite a number of years ago.  The BJ's special deep dish nailed it!  Deep dish pizza is a favorite of mine.   If that wasn't enough, they had Wyders Pear Cider on tap, which I haven't had since my San Diego days.  It's like my two favorite things in one spot.  We really enjoyed ourselves.   My wife ordered the chocolate chip cookie pan ice cream thing - wow, what a desert.   Two things kept this from being a 5-star.   The ""It's that drink"" drink special tasted awful.  It was like cough syrup, and it doesn't mix.  I expected a lot more, and that drink didn't deliver.  I don't send back drinks as an absolute rule, but I'm confident that if I did at BJ's (unlike some restaurants), my replacement drink would have been treated respectfully.  Still, we just don't send drinks back.  Ever.  The other lost half-star was because the prices were pretty hefty.  We had an appetizer of avocado something-or-others, pizza, dessert and 3 drinks that came up to almost $100 inc tax and tip.   It just seems like a lot of money for a meal.   But we left stuffed, and with leftovers for the next day.    The staff was great.  They really worked together.  Rather than ""this is my section"" type of servers, everyone seemed to genuinely work together and check on the customers.  Having worked as a server for a number of years, this dynamic was both unusual and impressive for a diverse group of people.  Loved watching it.  Loved watching people get along.  Class act!  And everybody, bar none, was professional from the hostess, to the waitress, supervisor, manager and everyone else.    I also notice that management actively reviews and listens to customers.  It shows.  Your staff aims to please, and it shows that you're actively involved.  Nice to see!   We dined on June 26.  Thank you for the great experience!"
Craig W.,"Sun City, AZ",0,15,,4.0,1/10/2017,The food and service was very good.  I had the Hickory Brisket and Bacon burger.  It was cooked to order and delicious.  The waitress was friendly and the food was served quickly.  I will return to this restauarant.
Bella B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,16,,5.0,7/13/2016,"I always come to this location because the food is always great, beer is always cold, and service is always perfect!!"
Vinnie F.,"Avondale, AZ",3,42,,4.0,4/1/2016,Stopped in after going to the casino. Was highly impressed. Burgers were awesome fries were good and there in house beer was great. Not a one complaint will go back and try something else! Also ambiance and service was spot on! Happy eating!
Frank R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,17,,5.0,7/26/2016,"Here's a follow up review. My son and I went to see the USA Soccer Team at the stadium last month. Prior to the game, we had lunch again at BJ's. We kind of went in like secret shoppers with no mention of our previous visit. Our server was great, the food was awesome and more importantly, the general manager April is a text book example of excellent customer service. Well done."
Andrea S.,"Minneapolis, MN",79,86,,3.0,4/29/2016,"The food is 5 stars, the wait and the staff not so much. I've been to this location several times and the food is always good. However, what I'm not a fan of is being told the wait is 45 minutes only to be seated shy of 2 hours later. If you can come here at an odd time like before lunch or dinner it's likely to be a quick wait. It's unfortunate they aren't more organized because this could easily be my favorite place."
Christina A.,"Surprise, AZ",3,36,21,5.0,8/20/2015,"Our server Ruben and his trainee Erin were great, I would like to say especially Erin who took great care of us. Because we used their app, we had 20% off from our check. Their Avocado egg rolls are always delicious! We were very thankful for her service."
Maria M.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,26,3,2.0,1/24/2016,"Worst dining experience I've had in a while. We came for the first time on Friday, January 8 at around 6PM for my birthday. I picked it because it looked like it had a few items my picky husband and 6 year old would like. There was a small crowd waiting to be seated when we arrived. The hostess told us the waiting period would be around 35 minutes- not too bad. We ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes to finally be seated. It seemed like everyone who arrived after us was being seated before us. And from what I saw, most of them seemed to know what to expect from this place. Everyone and their grandma had reservations that night! When we finally did get a table, my husband and I placed an order right away (we had plenty time to memorize the menu during our long wait). Our dinner did not arrive until about 50 minutes later.  My husband ordered a burger and fries. Son ordered the mini pepperoni pizza. Both thought the food was decent, nothing to rave about. I ordered the chicken, shrimp, and sausage, Jambalaya. It tasted like one of those frozen meals that come in a bag and you can just reheat in a skillet.  Idk what seasoning were in it, but it was definitely overpowering.  I will say that the waitress was attentive and apologetic for the very long wait. She's the only reason I bumped it to 2 stars. She offered us a free salted caramel pazooki (?) I'm so glad I didn't pay for it because it was overly sweet and the cookie was hard as a rock. What a bust! What would have been a little over an hour experience turned out to be around 3 hours long! As a result, we didn't have time to make it to the Star Wars movie we'd planned for after dinner, so we headed back home. We all agreed we'd be crazy to come to this restaurant again."
Tracy W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",92,68,22,5.0,3/16/2016,"My kids love this place. Birthdays, graduation, promotions. Special event we choose BJ's as one of our celebration spots."
Kate H.,"Auburn, WA",184,900,77,3.0,3/22/2015,"I've eaten here several times. The food is pretty good. However, the wait - both for seating and then service - can be long. Don't come too hungry, because it could be a while. The last time I was here, I ordered a burger and the burger was not even warm. My dining partner ordered fish tacos and she said that the fish was cold and the taco shells were stiff and stale. Usually it's better than that. We waited so long for our food that we asked the server where it was and asked for the check with the food. Way too long. I don't care how busy a restaurant is, getting food where you have to wait that long and getting coldish food is not a great experience."
Christine P.,"Phoenix, AZ",457,306,1872,5.0,6/12/2014,"I love this placeeeee. Mixture of the yard, and the cheesecake factory. Great ambiance here. My veggie pizza with the jalapeño was phenomenal!!! The trio pizzookiieeeeeee. Ahhhh. Loveeee."
Beth C.,"Buckeye, AZ",43,247,234,5.0,3/23/2014,"My husband has heard great things about this place from his co-workers. We visited on a Sunday at lunch. It was comfortably busy. The noise level was good--nice background noise, but not intrusive. Our server was fabulous. One of our biggest obstacles in dining out as a family is that our son is autistic and can only eat chips in restaurants. I asked our server if it was possible to get some tortilla chips by themselves and she was extremely nice about it. Thank you, thank you. A big tip for that kindness alone. My husband enjoyed sampling the beers. He had the small deep dish meat pizza and loved it. In the bit I had, I could tell the meat was very fresh, the cheese was real, and the crust was good--thick but not as heavy as some places. That was definitely the only meal my husband had for the day! I had the seared ahi salad. Oh, that was divine. Colorful with a fantastic mix of textures and tastes. I loved the dabs of wasabi at the corners of my plate. I'm grateful that they had a full menu of ""enlightened"" choices with calories clearly labeled; I wish more places did that. I felt like I got to eat out responsibly and have a fantastic treat, too. (To note: I love the ahi salad down at Yardhouse, too, but the two salads vary widely in ingredients.) We're already talking about opportunities to make a return visit here for a date lunch."
Genius G.,"Los Angeles, CA",259,115,140,4.0,3/5/2016,"Been here 6 times now since moving from LA....and never had a bad experience. They have great food, great service, and great beer....thumbs up"
Louie S.,"Phoenix, AZ",66,75,16,5.0,4/23/2016,"This place has a ton of positive vibe energy! We got there and the hostess's were very friendly; we got sat down right away even on a busy Friday night, and our servers were amazing! We started with the avocado egg rolls-delish! they had just the right crispiness.  We also had the BJ's mojito which was amazeballs. It wad a perfect mix of sweet and tart, and you could taste the feint strains of fresh basil in every sip. Then we had the tickled pink, and also a watermelon margarita, again perfect. Our main entrees were the jambalaya, and the fish and chips, the fish was perfectly battered, and tasty, the jambalaya was super delish with fresh roasted tomato, and fantastic seasoning. Overall a perfect dinner, one of the best I ever had."
Nicolle H.,"Phoenix, AZ",10,15,,5.0,4/21/2016,"Looooove bj's for many reasons, mainly the honey sriracha Brussel sprouts, happy hour will get you right, but their menu is so diverse and inexpensive that you can't deny yourself additional options that only a fool would miss out on! Can't wait till they bring back the carnita fries"
Irene D.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,2,,4.0,12/13/2016,"I just went here for the 1st time. Great menu, salmon with couscous was well prepared. I would go here if you're trying to please different appetites, something for everyone.  Close to 101 and you can go to the Harkins Show in the Mall."
Jodie L.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,2,,2.0,12/10/2016,"This was a good restaurant and the service was great. They have wonderful hamburgers and good beer. However, in a city in Arizona they have two handicap spots and Arizona must have 4 million handicap people. They have the same number of handicap slots that they do take out slots.  That is the only reason I downgraded the restaurant."
Dusty S.,"Peoria, AZ",31,5,,5.0,7/1/2016,First time here with my girl and the steaks were over cooked..... but the manager promptly came out and comped our meals and made us some delicious steaks...... also MIA is a great bartender and very sweet..... First time and definitely not the last....
