Mel A.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",0,21,,3.0,11/1/2015,"Was really disappointed that the quality of he dishes and service has deteriorated while i was away.  My favorite - Balsamic chicken with white cheddar cheese mashed potatoes use to be incredible all of the time. I'd always get this dish whenever I'd visit.... I've been gone for a while and upon return have been let down. My husband got a dish he hasn't had before and said it was okay, and the avocado egg rolls for appetizers are no where near the cheese cake factories avocado egg rolls (which are amazing). The food was served luke warm as if it had been been sitting for a while before getting served and quickly went cold. The server was only extremely ""on"" and attentive, or ""off"" no-where to be found.  The prices sure stayed the same - around $70 for 2 people but the quality of food isn't what it used to be sadly. The only thing that was on point was the strawberry Mojito."
Tami A.,"Goodyear, AZ",29,29,7,5.0,1/26/2016,"Always love coming to BJ food is always great.  My husbands favorite thing to order is the jambalaya,  he gets it extra spicy with pasta instead of rice. I love the Parmesean lemon chicken with white Cheddar mashed potatoes and broccoli,  my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I always want to order a pazooki but am usually to full to get one, they are fantastic! !! This place is one that we will continue to come to over and over agon."
Sara W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,30,,5.0,11/29/2016,"This place is freaking great. Huge menu. Like 6-7 pages full. From pizzas, pastas, huge beautiful salads, fried calamari, steaks, sandwiches, any kind of beer wine or mixed drink you could want. I could go on and on. Very modern and fancy looking inside. Good day or night. Staff is always nice."
Sandra S.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,2,1,5.0,2/21/2016,"There was a ""15 minute wait"", but we were called in sooner. The place was pretty busy- Sunday night at dinner time. Thomas S was our server and he was wonderful. Prompt awesome service. I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos, recommended by the server from the options I was debating between. They were UH-mazing! The side dish was also delicious. I would definitely recommend BJ's."
Sarah R.,"Buckeye, AZ",29,43,2,3.0,5/30/2016,"The saving grace of our meal was the mozzarella and tomato salad. Amazing! Unfortunately the entrees were mediocre to bad. We came here for lunch, and I had the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese. Pretty sure the chicken tenders were frozen and not hand breaded. Probably didn't help that my sandwich arrived lukewarm. My wife wasn't overjoyed with her triple decker sandwich either. Like I said, average at best. I would have given 2 stars but for the fact that they brew their own beer, and it's pretty good."
Jimmie S.,"Glendale, AZ",125,29,80,5.0,1/27/2015,"Went on a Saturday evening its was a little crowded, not too long of a wait, but a wait well worth it! Brewhouse Blonde beer set the pace along with the Roasted Caramelized Brussel Sprouts that were AMAZING!!! Fried Artichoke Hearts were good too. Then I had the 5 Meat Deep Dish pizza with Jalapeños, onions and Roasted Garlic, OMG!!! The pizza is off the Richter Scale!! The Menu has so much to choose from its hard to decide, but BJ's is a happening Spot!!!!"
Jamie R.,"Goodyear, AZ",80,2,,5.0,4/27/2016,We frequent this restaurant a lot and the service is always fantastic. They have a server Marlee who always goes above and beyond to make sure we have a nice experience!! She is why we come back each week!
Gil G.,"Peoria, AZ",16,28,1,2.0,12/15/2015,Used to be where my wife and I went for dinner....To many mistakes lately...Found a new place.
BJ B.,"Glendale, AZ",22,29,36,4.0,10/30/2014,"First off any place with the name BJ's gets an automatic extra star for obvious reasons hahaha. Otherwise this place would be getting a solid 3 stars. I like the location as compared to the other BJ's restaurants. Plenty of things to do in that shopping plaza; movie theater, stores, other bars etc.  Their beers are my main reason for spending my money there, not exactly a brewery but they serve their own craft beers which are excellent for a chain establishment, what always surprises me is all the craft beers from breweries they have on tap. Either way you can't go wrong having a pint or pitcher from there.  Food is definitely unique lots of different pizzas and burgers to choose from, pick one along with a beer and you're good. The staff there is pretty much on top of their game so feel free to ask what would go well with whatever you're drinking."
Just A D.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,4.0,11/1/2016,"We've been here twice and the food was very good both times. Second time, there was a long wait so someone came around offering bites of pizza. It was good enough we were second-thinking what to have for dinner. Definitely worth going back to."
Eyespy2 R.,"Sun City, AZ",0,12,1,5.0,9/14/2016,Went here for lunch today had the unlimited soup and salad soup I chose was clam chowder was it was slightly salty to my taste but otherwise good Caesar salad was very good I also had a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup which was very good our waiter Joseph attended to our needs very well I have frequented this place on numerous occasions and have always had very good food and service wait times can be lengthy during football and dinner hours I would not recommend this place for children
Dwight T.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,46,58,5.0,11/2/2013,"The turkey burger is very good. It does not taste like a hamburger, but that is not the point it is a very good turkey burger.  The house brewed root beer is worth the sugar."
Jenny Q.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,5.0,1/19/2016,"Such a great atmosphere, amazing food, we experience great service every time we go, The desserts are incredible, sometimes I have to order them first lol"
Maggie F.,"El Mirage, AZ",894,388,125,5.0,4/13/2013,"Today a good friend and I were both tempted by the WATERMELON & FETA SALAD. It's in the small plates area of the menu & is the perfect side for a starter salad! The presentation was beautiful. I wasn't sure if it would taste as good as it looked, it is an interesting combination, but it sure was! The watermelon was chilled and considering we'd just come in out of the heat it was exactly what was needed :) Oddly enough, we drank coffee :D  In our defense, this was a late brunch for us, so it was almost a must. The coffee was good! Not too weak and not too strong."
Jen S.,"Phoenix, AZ",63,5,,1.0,7/31/2016,"Just left the place and no one even spoke to us for over 15 minutes. Five employees walked past, not even a hello. It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon on a Sunday, no excuses. Worst service I've ever had here, sad to say I'm disappointed"
C C.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,13,,5.0,9/9/2016,Kudos to this BJs! Food is always excellent and the service great! Love the huge choice of menu items too! Have never had a bad meal here.  Keep up the good work!
L T.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,8,,4.0,4/5/2016,"Went for an early dinner yesterday around 5pm. Service was as expected not fantastic, but nothing to complain about. I have visited this location before and love bringing the wife for dinner dates. The food is always good. However I cannot recommend the deep dish pizza. Mondays are half off pizza so I ordered the classic combo and it was very disappointing. The crust was thick, nice and soft, but the toppings were terrible. The crust is so thick you have to overcook the toppings to finish the dough. It was so bad the sauce was dried under the cheese and the amount of oil/grease used in the pan is insane. It is rare that I throw away pizza but this one is in the trash. I will continue to visit, just will never try the pizza again."
Lynn C.,"Lebanon, CT",51,92,53,3.0,9/15/2015,"Good place to eat, lots of selections.  I had one of the salads on the lunch menu and it was fresh and adequate."
Jade W.,"Goodyear, AZ",18,321,20,5.0,10/15/2014,"Met a group of former coworkers for dinner and had one of the best meals I've had at BJ's. My boyfriend and I ordered the sliders with cheese & bacon along with the carnitas fries w/ chile verde. The mini burgers were so juicy and delicious! The carnitas fries were so flavorful. They use the shoestring fries but there was one wedge cut fry in there too and it was very tasty! My only complaint was they had onions on top and I didn't know that when ordering, so we had to scoop them off. We had the same server as last time and he did a great job, with the exception of our waters going dry during dessert. We got the Pizookie trio with pumpkin, cookies & cream, and chocolate chunk! Really good meal. 4.5 stars rounds to 5!"
Erin C.,"Laveen Village, AZ",12,31,,4.0,9/26/2015,"The food is always really good, and the menu has numerous options to choose from. The two for $25 deal is great because it gives you the same tasty food for a fraction of the cost. Most of the servers are good, but the last few times we have had one who is not very good. However, the food and drinks make up for it for the most part. The wait can be long at times, but if you call ahead to be put on the waitlist, it cuts the time down a bit."
