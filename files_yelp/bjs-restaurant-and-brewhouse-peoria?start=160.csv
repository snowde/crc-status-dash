Carin B.,"Surprise, AZ",41,54,430,4.0,7/26/2015,"What a truly great experience! Daniel T was genuinely pleasant and very attentive without being intrusive; a rare and desirable trait among servers in my opinion!  The food was timely and quite good. From ribs to pizzas and salads to weekend brunch, there was something to please everyone!"
Judy L.,"Avondale, AZ",440,1127,1324,3.0,12/19/2010,"Been to this location a few times, I just can't LOVE it.  It is ok.  Decent service, decent food, large menu selection, large drink selection, but nothing fablous about it.  =(   Mac & Cheese = Yum, the goldfish crunch on top is good French dip = good Burger melt = good Baked Alfredo Chicken Potatoe = good Half baked cookie with ice cream = good Maybe it is because I have had the some items else where and those tasted fablous!"
Cody V.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,86,63,4.0,12/13/2014,"This was our first time here.We came in on an off time. It was about 3:30 pm. We were immediately seated and a few seconds later our waitress took our drink order, which came out almost immediately.  Dirty Martini and a skinny Cosmo, both were so delicious! We had explained to our waitress that we were in no hurry. We sat for a good 20 min talking, with the waitress stopping periodically to see if we were ready to order. We finally ordered and our food came out quickly. Asian chicken salad and bison burger. YUMMO! I enjoyed having a great server who allowed us to pace the meal. She did not hover around rushing us. It was lovely! She got a great tip for her patience with us! My new fav spot!"
Rick G.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,97,46,5.0,12/17/2014,Came with a large group and the customer service was excellent. The food came out hot and delicious. They were on the spot with drink refills and condiment requests. The servers diligently kept up with removing plates. Impressed! The place is clean. Staff was friendly. Easy access parking.
Teresa K.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,6,,2.0,2/15/2016,"We have been here a few times and the service has been sporatic. Reuben, our first server was awesome. We had a few others who got the job done, nothing spectacular. Tonight was horrible! My father ordered the double burger and I had the balsamic chicken. We received our orders and my father asked for ketchup....15 minutes later we had not received our ketchup.  He then noticed the burger was not a double like he had ordered. So...after waiting for our server to make her way back to us, we informed her of the mistake. The manager came over and had my father's order refired. I had to wait for him to get his food...my meal was cold when his arrived. Very dissapointed to say the least.  We will call ahead for Reuben from now on. If he is not working we will go somewhere else. Hope BJ'S works to fix the sporatic service."
Scott S.,"Surprise, AZ",58,75,23,3.0,9/18/2014,"The employees who answer the phones as a rule say whatever is necessary to get people in the door , multiple times I've called from the parking lot with view of the front door and was told everything from no wait to not more than a couple minutes. Always a great exaggeration."
M. H.,"Denver, CO",1,49,7,5.0,8/25/2014,"This place is great! I organized a Bachelorette Party and called a ton of places trying to find somewhere we could go without having to rent a party room, require a minimum purchase per attendee, allow separate checks, etc. BJs was the perfect fit. We had a party of 20 and they were smart to assign two waiters to us. This was a huge help! They even allowed us to decorate the table and bring in a cake. The waiters could not have been more polite or provided better service. It was a very busy night for them, but you couldn't tell. The entire staff was so courteous that it was a wonderful experience for everyone there. Other attendees even mentioned how great the restaurant was throughout the night.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for small or large functions. They don't make you feel like you're a burden having so many people. The even did separate checks for each girl there and they didn't add gratuity. This was very smart because me and some of the other bridesmaids tipped over 50% because we were so happy with our experience."
Cindy C.,"Phoenix, AZ",119,144,,3.0,6/21/2014,"A bunch of us got together for dinner last week to get caught up.  I've eaten at the Chandler location and really enjoyed it.  This time was different: First of all...the service was exemplary.  The decor is cute and the restaurant was actually so cold we all carried sweaters. The food, however, was only ok.  I had the ahi salad and substited poke.  There was a really strong dressing that made it  inedible.  2 of my dining companions also had salads, which were prononounced ""adequate"".  Our other dining companion had pasta, which she liked. Ultimately, the experience was not horrible but was not exemplary either.  For those who live in the area and know the menu, it's a safe choice As for me, I'm not inclined to go back."
Sylvia G.,"Surprise, AZ",116,32,9,4.0,7/3/2014,The only things that don't make this place get the 5 stars are the margaritas and the the wait times to be seated.  Other than that the food is great and so is the service! I always have a great server and the hostess are always helpful.  I still have yet to try the pizza but so far all the other things have been great. Especially the pulled pork sandwich.
Melanie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,35,1,2.0,10/20/2015,"I came in yesterday and the food was terrible. I ordered the fettuccine chicken alfredo without chicken and the fettuccine wasn't just al dente, it was undercooked and hard. The food came out  kind of cold and I ended up finding chicken in it. Yesterday the service was fine, but a couple times before we had very odd servers and one with very very poor hygiene. I definitely won't come to this location again."
D U.,"Yelm, WA",0,25,,4.0,7/18/2016,"Had dinner here tonight. Normally when I travel I avoid chains, but decided to go with a tried and true (albeit in another state) restaurant. Bartender was very friendly and attentive, as were the other staff. Good food, good service. Will keep them in mind when I am in town."
Teresa D.,"Zion, IL",0,12,1,5.0,1/13/2016,I have always loved their unlimited soup and salad lunch and the price is fabulous! Recently we have been coming for dinner and the food is consistently good as well as the service. Tonight our server entered our order incorrectly and they could not have been more cordial about correcting the error. The manager came to our table twice and gave us a discount in addition to free dessert. Above and beyond our expectations!  We left our server a tip based on the full price of our dinner. We will definitely return!
Noah T.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,4,,3.0,3/2/2015,"Ok, first I would like to add we have been eating at BJ's (my wife, kids and I) since they opened. We live right up the street and frequent Park West about once a week for dinner and a movie. In the beginning when I very first tried BJ's, they had one of the best burgers I have ever had! I could tell they used high quality beef, quality ingredients- a delicious bun, and were prepared superb. The appetizer was also delicious and original, an avocado egg roll with a delicious dipping sauce. I have also tried the roast beef french dip which was excellent and a chicken tortilla soup to die for. That is why it's such a bummer when the last few times I've been there it has been extremely inconsistent.   When its good its really good, when it's bad, the service is horrible and the food has been lousy. However I never stop going to a place I like so much off of one bad food experience. Upon returning to see if it is really gone downhill like I feared, we were actually pleasantly surprised with our meals. So chalking it up as just an off day, we have gone back several times. I don't know what is going on, maybe it has to do with the manager who may be working at the time, or kitchen staff / wait staff, but it seems to oscillate from being one of my favorite places to go, to extremely poor food and service. When we're looking for a quick bite to eat and don't feel like cooking we'll stop by and have lunch or dinner, but unfortunately it is just too inconsistent. Their drink menu is awesome, and have plenty of microbrews to try. Myself being a fan of root beer, enjoys' their homemade root beer and my children often order they're orange creamsicle soda which is very delicious. They usually order off the children's menu, and the sliders offered on that menu are quite tasty.    The only reason I decided to write a review for BJ's is I honestly hope management can fix the inconsistencies with their dining experience. When their game is tight, it truly is one of my favorite chain restaurants. With how close they are to our house, I look forward to many more years of dining at BJ's,  and would even drive several miles extra to dine there if I had to because it is just that good (when it's good). It makes me very nervous that they will become just like so many other really good restaurants that start out delicious only to have a gradual descent into mediocrity. I just hope they do not become complacent being average, because their food is so much more when they do go the extra mile. I would gladly give 5 stars if the issues I stated above can be rectified."
Jeff B.,"Grand Island, NE",57,1,,5.0,12/21/2015,Always a must stop when in town.  Menu variety is excellent and the service is always great.
Patricia W.,"Youngtown, AZ",46,7,,5.0,10/25/2015,"A few old friends, my older brother and myself got together here for dinner. Other than my brother, we had not seen each other literally had not hung out together since High School. 40 years? It was AWESOME. The food was great, the Wait Staff, when they found out it was an unofficial 40 year reunion, made a big deal about it and made it even more fun. I remember mostly the friendliness of the staff. They were ALL great, the food was delicious, the atmosphere is terrific. It is like a 'Cheers' kinda place. They treat you like family!"
Theresa S.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,3,,1.0,4/9/2016,Worse meal ever. Ordered the kale and Brussels sprout salad. There was none. It was all spring mix. Called the manager over and he stated the spring mix was kale. He does not know the difference. Had to show him what kale looks look. he has no business being a manager of a food restaurant. He needs to go back to school and go food shopping. If you go ask Terry about your choice. He will not know what's on the plate.
Tina J.,"Peoria, AZ",18,8,,5.0,6/19/2016,Always good food & good service. They were very busy and still bussed a table just so we could move to a booth as requested.
Taric W.,"Phoenix, AZ",639,721,96,3.0,12/27/2011,"First of all, I'm totally guilty of chuckling at the innuendos. You bastards really bring out my inner 8th grader. I came here during happy hour with a group of around 15, and I'm always pleased to see my large group accommodated. I was informed that during happy hour, all mini pizzas were 1/2 off. I wasn't that hungry, and I'm always hyped for new foods, so I snatched up a menu and looked at the options. I stuck with the BJ's favorite (pretty much the works) and even paired it with their recommended red ale. The pizza was just so-so. I loved the buttery, deep dish crust, but the toppings were just warm or room temperature, like half of them were thrown on after the pie was already done. Dislike. The beer was spot on, but subsequent requests for adult beverages were met with a suspicious delay...and then the manager came out to make sure all was well. She seems very reluctant to serve alcoholic beverages, as opposed to other restaurants in the same price range that encourage you to let loose. Maybe they think they're classy? In any case, I had the blonde hefeweizen and the Grand Cruz, which came in a small goblet and packed a whopping 10% ABV. Not that you would guess that by tasting it! You may want to be picky about the mixed drinks, however, as my mojito was pretty bland. I'll come here again and try more pizzas and of course, more of their delicious beer. I won't stay too long, however, unless I finally come across something enticing on the list of traditional entrees."
Michele G.,"Surprise, AZ",3,2,,5.0,2/25/2015,The jalapeño burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had! I also love their strawberry lemonade! Sometimes we wait a little bit for the food but it is totally worth the wait! Everytime someone visits from out of state we bring them to BJS and they love it as well!
Shamus S.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,27,77,5.0,1/16/2015,This place is awesome it has a lot of TVs great menu excellent happy hour the staff is awesome people are great. The beer is excellent starter. Tried the fried artichokes and loved it. The jalapeno burger was absolutely amazing. Have another beer and then make sure you save room for a pizookie doesn't matter which one because they're all awesome!
