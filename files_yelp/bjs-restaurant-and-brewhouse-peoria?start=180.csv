Kathy J.,"Surprise, AZ",2,27,,5.0,9/4/2015,"Great food and service!!  Had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with house salad and blue cheese dressing.   Huge portions of chicken breast, enough to have lunch for the next day.  Mashed potatoes and broccoli with meal were tasty and blue cheese dressing was on point!   Make sure to try their thin cut fries - had to sneak a few from hubby's meal!!"
Brian D.,"Youngtown, AZ",28,18,2,5.0,1/16/2015,"My wife and I are huge fans of the happy hour. Our son is still under two and can act his age. Whenever he does, the staff is always understanding. The beer is great and the dessert menu is on point!!"
Jasmine J.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,3.0,6/10/2015,Love their food but... It takes forever! It takes a good 1hr 15 mins for lunch and order lunch specials. For dinner it's about 1hr 45min. Hopefully they will be faster next time.
Luciana L.,"Buckeye, AZ",77,771,40,3.0,10/24/2013,"Came here for a work luncheon.  Nice staff.  OK food.  I had the ""under 600"" meal so maybe that's why the flavor wasn't all there but it was still OK."
Sara A.,"Surprise, AZ",13,13,8,2.0,3/19/2016,"After an hour wait I had hoped that the food would make up for it, boy was I wrong. The atmosphere was loud and busy as expected and the table was clean and neat. After ordering chips and salsa and a round of hand crafted sodas for the table it took a while for the server to come back to take our order. The chips and salsa arrived and the chips were crispy and delicious, the salsa was pretty good as well although we found multiple french fries swimming in the bottom of it, the only thing that would have made them better was more chips as we ate all of the them within 5 minutes of receiving the plate. Next the salads came out and both were tasty, no complaints there. Then we waited for a long time for our food to come out..... My husbands ribs were hot but over done. They were chewy and the outside was crispy and hard to eat. I ordered the ziti, which was not the smallest I've seen but not huge either. The noodles were okay but some were either undercooked or burnt because they were very crunchy. The sauce was pretty tasty but not much better than a store bought and there was so little meat that I could hardly find it. Finally, our server took forever to bring us our check making our time at the table over an hour. Overall the entire experience was less than great and it did not make me feel like returning anytime soon."
Brad P.,"Glendale, AZ",18,44,3,4.0,1/3/2015,"Usually a wait on weekends, as was the case this evening . . . Haven't always elected to wait, but tonight we wanted to stay for football and good food.  The experience was positive, beginning with friendly staff from the host team to our server. Santa Fe Spring Rolls were a tasty appetizer (albeit a tad small). The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was excellent; the small pie is more than enough for one (you can even share a few bites and not leave hungry). My wife ordered the very flavorful toasted chicken pesto sandwich. The Premier Rewards program is a nice plus; simply ask your server for an application before you pay your bill."
Traci K.,"Glendale, AZ",0,5,,5.0,5/1/2016,Food is always delicious. Waitress Crystal is always so friendly we now ask for her section. We eat here at least once a week. Always fresh and tasty
Shari B.,"Glendale, AZ",5,23,4,3.0,5/8/2015,"We come to this place often and just went for dinner last night. When the food is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's pretty bad. I ordered the grilled tacos last night and got one with grilled fish and one with grilled shrimp. The shrimp tasted awful. Seemed like they were cooked for 20 minutes too long. A piece of leather probaby would have been easier to chew through. The fish was also very over done but was a little easier to stomach than the shrimp. Our waiter never came back to ask us how the food was, in fact we didn't see him again until he was ready to give us the check. We had waited 30 minutes for our table and I was starving, so I just put on my big girl pants and ate my meal. We will be back because we've also had good experiences here and we do like this place overall, but I think I will skip the grilled tacos next time."
Wyatt L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,7,,4.0,8/12/2015,"My family goes here quite often, and it's always got a healthy amount of people. The food is always good, as well as the service. The only complaints I have are sometimes it takes 30+ minutes to get your food, and that it is a bit pricy. Other than that it's a great place for a family dinner."
Jared D.,"Peoria, AZ",2,44,2,5.0,7/31/2015,"I see gat this restaurant is up here twice, but it gets 5 stars and an A++++ in my book!"
Katie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/7/2015,"I love BJs! I have had it serval times back home and this was not my best experience. I went out with some of my friends, who have never been there before, I am sad to say their experience was below satisfactory. I understood they were busy but you have to respect your customers. I am a college student, I chose to spent what little money I have at this establishment and I want to get my money's worth. We were told the wait was only 20 minutes, we waited over 35 minutes. We never heard our name called. They claim they called us. They do use a text messaging system as well but I never got a message. They were calling names but the hostesses were not speaking clearly into the intercom or it needs to be fixed. I keep on moving to try to hear the intercom but I simple could not hear. Their voices sounded like they were underwater. When I went up to ask where we were on the list they said they called us. I explained I did not hear them. The hostess responded in a snarky voice, ""Well, you should have received a text message.""  I explained to her I never got it and she rolled her eyes at me. She then responded in annoyance, "" Well, we will see what we can do for you.""  Shortly after, a different hostess sat us, she explained that the intercom is meant for outside not inside and that sometimes they have errors in their text message system. Okay, well not everyone sits outside, It was cold so I was standing inside. My friends wanted to leave before we were even seated because of the lack of the experience of the hostesses. They are the first impression of the restaurant and they should remain respectful to customers even during the Friday dinner rush.  The food was excellent though! As always BJ's food was delicious! Our server was busy with two large parties as well but she kept on checking up on us and making sure our drinks were full. This server definitely made up for the chaos of the hostess station."
Janis W.,"Tempe, AZ",60,110,,4.0,11/30/2013,"If you are over in the West Valley and want to stay away from the Cardinals stadium and all that craziness, just up the freeway a couple exits is a row of restaurants/bars right off the Northern Exit. Easy access and lots of parking.  To be honest, I have only ever had drinks and appetizers here. One time it was late night (after 10 PM) and the place was pretty empty. Great service that night. The other time it was happy hour on a Saturday. CROWDED!! and service was slow, but only because our server had tons of tables to deal with.  Overall, I like the food. We had flatbread pizzas, artichoke dip and sliders. Not bad bar food. The place is nice, clean and large."
Eric N.,"Peoria, AZ",3,29,4,4.0,4/17/2014,"I've been a fan of BJ's since the late 90's when I first started going to the one in West Covina, CA.  Of course it's reasonable to expect menu changes from time to time and I have never been disappointed in the food quality.  This location can be a real chore to park at, and it's not uncommon to have to circle the lot for 15 minutes at dinnertime to find even a far spot.  I have always been a Brewhouse Blonde Fish and Chips fan, even through its changes throughout the years, and my last trip here was no exception.  My favorite beer is the Brewhouse Blonde and I can drink those for days.  The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my next favorite item and luckily for me, DW always orders it so I can sneak a bite or two. Service last time I was there was a bit lacking as our server wan't completely focused on our orders.  After taking our drink orders, she bolted off before we could order any appetizers.  Once she came back around, we ordered up some Pepperoni Extreme and Margherita Fresca pizzas for our appetizers and off she went to put in the order.  When the order came out, we got the pepperoni, but a California Club pizza instead of the Margherita.  I guess this is what happens when servers don't write down your order. I get it, servers have bad days, so there's no animosity here or malice there, and the rest of our order came back fine.  Our server could have checked in a few more times for refills but like I said, she was probably having a bad day, or was just about to clock out.   It looked like a new menu since the last time I dined here, but my faves were still there.  BJ's was it's normal good self, but maybe its magic is starting to wear off for me.  It's a solid four stars for the food and the iffy service didn't make it lose any stars; it's just that this place isn't as great for me now as it was when I was in my twenties.  I miss the clam chowder and the chicken lettuce wraps. Call ahead seating saves time and I wish all restaurants would do this.  Plenty of TVs all around the restaurant to keep abreast of the local and national sports teams.  I will definitely come back and recommend this place."
Jay J.,"Phoenix, AZ",11,6,1,4.0,4/15/2014,"I visit BJ's frequently for both dine-in and take-out. I'm always very happy with the quality of food, especially the California Chicken Sandwich, and the Salmon! The unique cocktails make happy hour a delight and the selection of beers is extensive and always evolving. The only thing I've had an issue with is a medium-well burger, it always come out WELL done. Other than that, the staff is quick, friendly and accommodating."
Wallie L.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",0,9,,1.0,7/20/2016,"My one star rating has nothing to do with the food, which was very good, and everything to do with the manager of the evening, Amber, during our experience at BJ's on Saturday, July 16.  We were coming to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend.  I phoned ahead to get on the list for a table.  I specifically requested a table because my husband and I have disabilities that limit our movement and make it nearly impossible to maneuver ourselves into and out of a booth.  The hostess assured me that a table would be made available for us.  When my buzzer went off, Amber said our space was ready, but that it was a booth.  I explained that we required a table and she insisted that the booth can accommodate us because of the pullout section for seating.  As we approached the booth we saw an empty table for 4 and asked why we could not have that space.  She explained that she needed it and that as soon as the people in the table next to that one left, she would be setting it up for someone else.  Mind you, the people at the other table were in no way ready to move on and had settled in nicely for a good dinner with friends.  We sat down at the empty table and refused to get up because the space was available for us and we wanted that space for our dinner.  Amber was extremely rude and upset that we would not take the booth and kept repeating to us that she ""needs that table"".  The hostess attempted to give us our menus and Amber told her ""NO"" because she ""needs that table"".  Along comes the waitress assigned to the table, Christa, and we explained to her what was going on.  She was a delight and offered to get us something to drink while the table fiasco was sorted out.  Seeing that the table next to us was clearly not leaving, we asked her to bring us menus and we ordered our appetizer and dinner.  To be clear, an hour later that group next to us was still enjoying their time together.  I don't know what Amber's issue was, but she needs some intense training on customer service as she could not have been more rude and unprofessional if she tried.  We have never had an experience like this at BJ's, nor any other restaurant we've dined at.  We thank Christa for her excellent service and enjoyed our dinners.  It will, however, be some time before we frequent the Peoria location again."
Kim C.,"Surprise, AZ",22,7,,3.0,10/29/2014,"This place isn't bad, considering we come here enough to have a BJ's Rewards card, but sometimes I feel the service is lacking when they are busy or running a large party table. They have great beers & I love their fried artichoke hearts. 70% of the time, it's a solid 8/10 for a dining experience, but they aren't able to be consistent with it. It's usually a hit or miss when we go to eat there."
Gidget S.,"Southgate, MI",58,85,47,3.0,2/2/2014,"My boyfriend's boss recommended this place, so we visited last night.  Our waitress, Katelyn, was wonderful and very attentive.  She checked on us quite a bit and was always friendly. The food was not as good as the service.  My boyfriend ordered a deep-dish pizza and it was very disappointing!  We named this the ""Just a lot of dough"" pizza.  If you are from the Chicago area or have ever visited, do not order this deep dish!  There is hardly any sauce and the dough is about an inch thick through the entire pizza. I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone and I was not impressed.  The noodles were overdone and squishy and most of the dish was very bland."
Stephen N.,"Phoenix, AZ",24,23,107,4.0,4/27/2013,My girl and I had the Chicken Club Flatbread Pizza and the Stuffed Mushrooms. Both were excellent. The pizza had a great aftertaste. I enjoyed the decor. The hostesses all dressed in classy dresses which I thought was cute.  For the two appetizers and two drinks our bill was $20. So it's not too expensive but not a place with a value menu. I would recommend it.
Sheila S.,"Glendale, AZ",0,21,,3.0,4/9/2015,"It appears from other reviews that there is definitely a problem with ""wait time"" here. My daughter and I have been here twice in the past couple of months, both times we chose a high-top table in the middle of the bar area. The first time service was slow, we chalked it up to being in between after lunch and and the very start of happy hour or short on staff. BUT, last night, our service was just plain ole SLOW. Last night we arrived approx 8:00 for dinner. No wait for a high-top table in the bar area but it took a while to for our server to get our initial drink order. She returned, we placed our food order and that's when the wait time got even worse. Our drinks were empty....even our water! She never checked in, kept looking for her and we were about to just leave but we had a hungry little boy who needed his dinner. She finally came to our table with some weird reason why our dinner was delayed, took off real quick and our glasses were still empty. Finally able to get a second round ordered and then our dinner came out. It was hot and delicious....good thing or we would have just left. We were comped on the bill for the delay so the situation was acknowledged. I sure did notice another couple next to us in tables that were seated 30 seconds before us ( I know, I wanted that table but didn't make it in time) were done, served, ate, paid the bill and left before we even had our meal brought to our table.  The food is amazing and delicious and there is a wide selection of beers. I hope that my next visit our server will be a bit more attentive and my glasses don't sit on the table empty"
Evelyn L.,"Avondale, AZ",19,104,40,5.0,1/14/2014,"I had the parmesan encrusted chicken, and I've never been disappointed.  I love their mashed potatoes, and their broccoli ir has this lemon-y flavor which isn't typically done.  The service here is always very good I have never left here disappointed. Their house beers are so very good if your over the age of 21, and would like to try something different I would say definitely to for it. Almost forgot to mention their Italian sodas are gooood!  It's almost always very busy, so I would try to call ahead and check in."
