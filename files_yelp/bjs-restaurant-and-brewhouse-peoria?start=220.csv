Leah E.,"Peoria, AZ",12,68,7,4.0,9/12/2014,"We go to this location often.  The food is always good and service has always been a great experience.  Additionally, we usually bring by 3 year old son with us, and the servers are always so nice and sweet to him."
Thomas T.,"Peoria, AZ",0,16,1,5.0,1/4/2015,"I had no problems here at all. My girlfriend and I received a gift card for 50 dollar for Christmas so we wanted to give this place a try. Went on Saturday around 5 pm. Waited for 10 min for a table in the bar area. The place was busy for 5pm, which I always consider to be a good sign. We ordered 2 drinks each; two Irish red ales and two piranha pale ales. This is a craft brew house and I was impressed with their beer. We ordered one appetizer and a medium deep dish pizza. It was considered happy hour due to the Cardinals game being on. Four beers, one medium pizza and an appetizer for 45 bucks. Not bad at all."
Clint W.,"Peoria, AZ",0,16,,5.0,1/3/2015,I've been a regular at BJ's for several years and had pretty much everything on the menu. It's a really good place for lunch and dinner. Great drinks at the bar too.
David M.,"Phoenix, AZ",51,57,6,2.0,6/27/2014,"Normally I'm a big fan of BJ's Restaurant, but tonight... Slow and somewhat inattentive staff.  After a 45 minute wait, we were seated, but it took another 10 minutes just to get our waters, which Michael (our waiter) spilled on the table.  We walked out after that."
Dave V.,"Peoria, AZ",0,6,,4.0,6/30/2016,"the place is casual, but it looks clean and classy, good place for drinks or food , has craft beer if that is your thing, only had appetizers, but the food looked great."
Jessica T.,"Phoenix, AZ",63,63,2,4.0,2/19/2013,"I have had great food every time I that I have came. The prices are very reasonable.I love that they have a great selection of beer and WINE.  My favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken! It is delicious. But I have had differnt apps and even the burgers are good. The only reason for fours stars, the service can be so hit or miss."
Mischell M.,"Glendale, AZ",19,11,,3.0,6/14/2014,Service was bad but Manager made up for it with free dessert.  Food was ok.  I have had better ar other locations.  I may give them another chance.
Adam S.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,17,,5.0,4/14/2014,Service is wonderful. The biggest surprise has been how fast the food comes out while still being fresh and full of flavor every time.
Melissa M.,"Glendale, AZ",2,13,,5.0,9/7/2014,"I was recently introduced to this restaurant and love it! Their beer samplers are great and appetizers delicious. They do get pretty busy, but that has to say something about their business, right? The staff is friendly and willing to share their experience with the items on the menu. I like the option they have up at the bar area, like a ""seat yourself"" type area."
Stephanie F.,"Buckeye, AZ",22,259,170,4.0,10/26/2012,"Fun atmosphere-good pizza, good size small appetizers, good tomato and mozzarella salad and Excellent pie-zookie (warm cookie with ice cream on top)."
David D.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",11,49,21,2.0,10/6/2013,"Went here last night for deep dish pizza. My wife, being from Chicago was having withdrawals, so off we went. We really do like this place in general, though the parking can be horrific. We started with the chicken won tons; Thai style and they were wonderful. When our pizza showed up and we began to eat, my wife loos at me and says ""is there any sauce on your pizza""?"" Nope"", I said and we waited for the waiter to return. He said something to the effect of, well do you want me to have them put more sauce on it or are you going to eat it like it is. I said, well we'd really like another pizza, this time with sauce. The manager comes over a few minutes later and says something about ""miscommunication"", apologizes and asks us if we ordered it without tomatoes. No, just standard sausage pizza we said. Well, she explains, ""our pizzas are lightly sauced"" (apparently before they have fully risen) ""and sometimes it soaks in or the top rubs"" (against what I didn't ever understand) and may have accidently removed some of the sauce"". So we had to sort of pick apart the pizza in front of her, while she gave us that condescending ""not really a smile-smile"" as if we were mentally challenged, to show her that what we got was essentially cheesy garlic bread with sausage. She wouldn't even glance and it...just kept that artificial smile on her face and said ""let me know if there is anything else that I can do"". As opposed to the nothing that you have already done you mean? That was my inner thought, not to worry, I didn't actually say that. SO, by and by our replacement pie comes out and the waiter says"" don't worry, I told the kitchen ""extra sauce"" and watched them make it. Wonderful, now we got a pie that more resembled spaghetti. Just soaked with sauce. At this point we just give up and ask for our check. The waiter then tells us that due to the pizza issue, we would like to buy you desert. No thanks, we said. He brings us our check and announces, I had that pie taken off your tab (we had a couple of beers and an app as well, so  I wasn't paying that much attention to the total), until my wife pointed out that there were two pizza's on the check and that they took one of them off. I don't bother saying anything at this point, as free food was not what we came for, but I will say this. There would have been one heck of a ruckus if they had charged me for two pizzas. Just a crazy, out of body dining experience. Almost as if they were on the other side of the Dome."
Melinda M.,"Surprise, AZ",3,34,4,4.0,2/22/2012,"Lacey, Lacey, Lacey...you're a rock star! We went a few weeks ago with another couple and Lacey was our server.  As we all know, service can make or break an experience and we were so happy to get Lacey.  She knew the menu, made great suggestions for cocktails, had a great smile and attitude. Here is what really made the night...my husband and I split something and it came with fries and he likes thick and I like the shoestring.  So, Lacey took it upon herself to do half and half on our order.  I know, it's not rocket science but the fact that she took an extra step and thought outside the box was awesome! She is a true asset to this organization. You go girl!"
Lili M.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,10,1,4.0,7/26/2014,Food and service was great! We discovered the BJs app right before paying and saved $5 off of $20. Pretty convenient - you can pay your bill via the app and don't need to wait for your server. Our table ordered avocado rolls as a starter and they're absolutely delicious.
Cherlyn E.,"Scottsdale, AZ",8,136,4,4.0,3/20/2012,Yes I am a fan. Good food and drinks.  Service is great as well.
Crystal T.,"Avondale, AZ",37,25,4,3.0,11/16/2013,Service is always terribly slow. Pizza is mediocre. Never wear heels- super slippery floor!
Kaitlin G.,"Mesa, AZ",96,22,,2.0,6/6/2013,"I have never wrote a review but I was appalled at the service here yesterday (5/31/13) at lunch. I was with someone and we were literally one of the first people in the door at 11am and didn't get our food for a good 45 minutes. I was on my lunch break and not once did the server come over to apologize as the restaurant filled up and other patrons came and left after already eating. After finally getting food he just dropped it in front of us, cold and walked away. I have been a server before and I think that's why it bothered me the most, knowing what I would have done in his situation, at least apologizing for the wait or even sending over a manager. I was late getting back to my office due to coming in at 11am and not able to leave until 1230 after shoveling the food in my mouth. I would come back, but if I had the same server, ask for someone else."
Samuel H.,"Goodyear, AZ",72,7,17,5.0,9/8/2010,Ummmmm.    beer.  Tried the porter and red.   Both good. Then I went  back a month later and had the Chocolate Stout.  That one is the best yet!!
Carl S.,"Peoria, AZ",0,1,,5.0,7/24/2015,"Great beer. Great food. Friendly, helpful staff. Nice rewards program."
Sarah G.,"Peoria, AZ",41,74,,3.0,5/14/2011,"Whew. Ever feel like you've been sucked into a black hole where no waitstaff can find you? I and others in my party must have worn our server-repellent tonight. We weren't on her radar AT ALL.  Spoke to the manager, and she was apologetic, which was good. She comped our desserts. Speaking of which, I found a chunk of chicken in my pizzooki. Chicken. I could not stop laughing! This meal was like the Charlie Brown of meals. Nothing went right! Good grief!"
Jake A.,"Surprise, AZ",0,152,13,1.0,6/24/2011,"I've had very bad luck at this location.  The most recent time I tried the ""call ahead"" reservation, gave my name, and time I'd be arriving.  They took my info an said they would see me soon. I get to the restaurant, wait at the line to check-in.  The walk-up customer ahead of me was given a 50 minute wait time.  I give my name, they look up me, and tell me that I'd have a 45 minute wait time...whaaat????  I said I was on the call-ahead list, the girl says yes you are, 45 minute wait.  I ask what is the point of the call-ahead, she just shrugs and gives me a take-it-or-leave-it look, so we left.  Walked over to the blu-burger grill, walked in and was seated right away."
