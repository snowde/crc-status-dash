Elizabeth A.,"Peoria, AZ",0,8,1,5.0,6/28/2014,"Start with the caprese salad. It's less than $4 and sooooo amazing! To drink get the Irish Root beer if you're 21+. You won't regret it! Made with handcrafted root beer. They also have tons of beer in draft but nothing you would usually see anywhere. But if you want a boring standard beer, your waiter will recommend something close but craft. They are so knowledgeable with their beers it's refreshing. Then, order the deep dish buffalo pizza. The hot sauce they put on there isn't your normal Franks Red Hot Sauce. It's kinda sweet, mild and tangy. Dessert? Save room for the pazookie!!! Mushy baked cookie right to your table. Amazing. And they're open late and everyone is friendly.."
Matt T.,"Glendale, AZ",2,31,,3.0,2/18/2013,Most of the time the service at the bar is good.  Food is alright.  I enjoy a few of their beer selections.  Attitudes of the management could be a bit better though.   I also wish they had more selections on their small-plate menu.
Anthony K.,"Phoenix, AZ",47,230,282,3.0,12/22/2013,This was the first time trying the restaraunt.  We were seated promptly the waitress took our drink order and appetizers we tried the avocado eggrolls which were highly recommended but they  were bland and the  dipping sauce did not have much flavor. I tild the waitress that we were there to celebrate my daughter's bday.we ordered dinner but it took about 30 minutes before our meals got there. My steak was  overcooked and I was not offered steak sauce till I have done with dinner.we did order their cookies and ice cream. We still would have liked our free desert.overall I rate the restaraunt as average .disappointed
Michael C.,"Glendale, AZ",13,13,,5.0,2/6/2014,One of mine and my wife's favorite places to eat. They have a really big selection so I'm always having something different every time I go. I also haven't been disappointed by anything I've tried. Gotta love there dessert pazooki too baked cookie with ice cream sooooo good. I have to say there Jerimah Red brew that they have on tap is one of my favorites to get as well. All around really good place for a dinner date or casual dining you won't be disappointed.
Jennifer O.,"Phoenix, AZ",367,1822,73,4.0,3/2/2013,"So, as you all know, BJ's is an unfortunately named chain restaurant. I went last night with the BF and his parents as it was his mom's birthday and that's where they wanted to go. It was actually a pleasant surprise! We all got drinks, I had the skinny -rita, which was really good, tart and fresh tasting. The BF got a snakebite, which was, as always, delicious. For dinner, I had the soup and salad with a caesar salad and tortilla soup. Going the 'healthy' route (I know this was not healthy in any way). The soup was very good and flavorful. They serve it 'fancy' style, putting chicken, avocado, tortilla, cheese, and bell pepper in the bottom of a bowl and then pouring the broth over the bowl table side. Nice touch. The salad was fair. Everyone else reported that they enjoyed their entrees. We had pizzookie for dessert, a half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream, delish. All of this for only 80$...pretty good deal. My only complaints are minimal and include: I wish they offered half portions at discounted prices....the portion sizes are way too big and there were a lot of things that looked good on the menu, but I wouldn't order them because I didn't want such a large portion. Also, this restaurant is busy and the wait to eat here is a little over the top....I wish that they took reservations. Overall, this place was good, especially for a chain."
Sarah F.,"Apache Junction, AZ",33,227,46,5.0,12/4/2011,"The Menu here is really great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome."
Danielle F.,"Surprise, AZ",58,108,164,4.0,1/7/2014,"We had the Mac and cheese, really awesome, bacon. Corn fritters with a bacon aeoli, also really great, jalapeño gives it the slightest spark, corn adds sweetness. Pub burger w/ bacon and cheese, can't go wrong there. Parmesan crusted chicken, my favorite. It's always cooked perfectly. Staff were great, bringing extra plates since we were sharing everything. Always friendly and attentive."
Pk G.,"Goodyear, AZ",9,79,,4.0,1/2/2012,"So, I ran out of gift ideas for Christmas.  I found myself at Fry's at the gift card section.  I decided to buy my wife a couple of gift cards (cheaper than jewelry).  I picked up a Carrabas and one to BJ's since we had never been there.  Our friends did tell us that they liked it so I thought, why not.   We stopped in for lunch yesterday and sat at the bar.  We were greeted as soon as we sat down by the bartender who took his time to go over the menu and the beer selections.  We did sample a few different beers and they were good. The menu is very complete and looked good.  We decided to try a sampler plate and a couple of side salads.  The food was fresh and prepared perfectly.   I am sure we will return again.   It was a great experience and total cost for ""lunch"" and ""some"" adult beverages was under $40.00"
Kevin O.,"Surprise, AZ",48,227,390,2.0,2/13/2011,"I can sum up my experience at BJs in one word...Fail!  First off, we called ahead on a Saturday night after a Coyotes game, and were told 30 mins. We show up with 5 mins to spare and were told we would be seated in 5 mins...right on time. Only 5 mins in BJs time is 25 mins! At the 15 min mark I asked how much longer it would be, but was told they simply ""don't really know"". While waiting for our table we were repeatedly told by the staff how tired they were.  Once seated I was firmly told by the waitress that they do NOT have Dr. Pepper, Pibb, or anything similar! They were awful proud of their root beer! :(. I hate root beer.  My wife and I decided to split a large bacon cheese burger pizza at the reasonably low price of $24!!! Although the pizza was good, by no means was it worth that much. Way too greasy, and although we asked for no tomatoes, they seemed to put double the norm. It would have been sent back, but again BJs time is about double normal time.  I wanted to like this place, but the experience was just too poor to even give them a second chance. Take a pass if your in the Park West / Westgate area!"
I R.,"Tolleson, AZ",0,4,7,5.0,3/1/2014,This place is AMAZING!!! They're food is delicious and their customer service just  rox! Hit the bar cause Julia and Heather are the best bartenders you'll ever meet!
Danielle M.,"Glendale, AZ",5,40,17,5.0,11/9/2013,Went out with the husband for a date night. While we had to wait a while to get seated it was definitely worth it. Started our meal with the Piranha chili nachos and those were kinda eh. But ordered the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza and it was amazing. Subbed the celery for tomatoes on it though. Root beer is super good and husband was also very pleased with his fish and chips. Will definitely eat here again.
Dion H.,"Phoenix, AZ",25,7,,4.0,3/24/2015,"We come here 2 or 3 times a month maybe more, and we generally have a great experiance, we went in a few days ago and had better service from our food runner than our server, although the food was good the experiance was just eh. To start it took us a long while to get greeted, once we were it was by Sarah who seemed alright but way more focused on stocking and getting ready to leave than her tables, tables that were there after us were greeted and served before us, we ordered some drinks I had the watermelon ale which was fantastic, we had a Margherita Flatbread and sliders to start which were also fantastic, but we were abondonded on many ocasions, I've worked in the industry for many years and understand how the system works, maybe sarah was having a rough day, wasn't bad enough to were I'd avoid her section, just hope for a little more attention to detail next time, but we do love this place and the happy hour!! Recommend this location to anyone, I haven't had a meal or drink I haven't liked yet!!"
Dee A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2014,"The food is good; however, you will trade off the lack of beverage refills and lack of dessert. I went with a group of friends, on one of the group members' suggestion. My coffee was never refilled, not once; and I was never asked if I wanted dessert, despite having specifically told the server when I ordered dinner, that I intended to order dessert. I just got my bill. The food was good, but the service so abysmal, with the clear intention to scoot the customers out the door as rapidly as possible, that I will never to to any BJ's again."
Jake V.,"Littleton, CO",19,421,214,3.0,12/24/2012,I like this place. I like the pan pizza and can always find something on the menu since it is a very extensive menu.
Courtney B.,"Surprise, AZ",65,337,14,2.0,8/29/2012,"We are usually good with everything at BJ's, fine service good deep dish yummy cookie pizza, but this last visit the service was the only good part (which he really was, so he gets props!) But they not only made our pizza wrong, they were sloppy and rushed about it, the ingredients were piled very uneven, not cooked right, some were even left off and we paid for them, our server did a great job helping to correct the situation by remaking our pizza for us, but even the quality seems to have shot way down, I am gonna have to look elsewhere for my deep dish fix..."
Matthew S.,"Tolleson, AZ",23,103,3,3.0,6/10/2013,"The service here is great. At least while sitting at the bar it is. The food is good and the beers are good. The have a very nice selection of drafts which is great. I usually try a different house beer every time I'm there. So far the best is their seasonal Pumpkin Ale they have during October. This place is overall great, but it's expensive."
Dave R.,"Goodyear, AZ",2,25,,5.0,5/20/2014,"Pizza is really good and the 1/2 pound burger with fried jalepeno slices is really, really good.  Huge beer selection, including their own brew.  It's a nice place inside and our server was one of the best we've had in a long time."
Ruby R.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,7,4,3.0,5/18/2013,"Great Beer And the Ambiance is nice too. But over priced food, took long to bring are orders and the pizzas were barely warm, not hot. My sons hamburger was undercooked  and just barely warm. I guess our food was sitting for a while some where. If I go again it would be during their lunch specials. Ehh."
Andy S.,"Peoria, AZ",1,1,,2.0,9/9/2013,"Everything I had was great... My wife on the other hand, got food poisoning. She had the California Chicken sandwich and a caesar salad..."
Nate K.,"Peoria, AZ",21,6,,2.0,5/24/2012,Terrible service. Very disappointed. I love the beer but if you're not spending money with a group then forget it. Come on. If I'm not getting good service being by myself for a quick beer why would I come back with a group or even another person? The second star is for the good tasting beer I had.
