Joe P.,"Avondale, AZ",105,170,11,5.0,6/14/2012,Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too.
JM T.,"Glendale, AZ",0,20,,2.0,4/19/2012,"One word review ""meh"". This place was seriously average, mediocre, nothing special. Great service but beyond that it was nothing to write home about."
Darrell S.,"Buckeye, AZ",210,306,3,4.0,7/13/2012,Always good.  The Jeremiah Red is the best.  Good prices on food during happy hour.
Eyezola G.,"Surprise, AZ",17,45,1,4.0,7/20/2012,Sooooo....if I'm feeling saditty this is where I go for too loud music and a lot of sports on multiple tvs throughout! Clean and spacious and the food is yummy despite the occassional grumpy server. Its pricey but that is expected from a 'higher end' sports bar! I don't have any major complaints and I do have a compliment on the great desserts! I am a sweets whore and they fulfill me needs quite well! Great place for a group meet and eat!
Stacey A.,"Portland, OR",98,203,37,4.0,2/23/2010,"Took someone here this weekend for a birthday dinner on saturday - it was pretty busy, but we were fortunate to find an open seat at the bar. This BJ's seemed a little smaller than the Chandler location, but that didn't really bother me. Our service was good and the bartender was really chatty though I didn't mind.  Started off with some Hefeweizen, clam chowder sourdough bowl for appetizers, and some BJ's deep dish pizza for dinner. Food was really good, servers were nice, so I'd definitely come back again."
Erin H.,"Peoria, AZ",8,10,,4.0,9/24/2011,"This is an update to my original review. The last time we went to this location, we bellied up to the bar at the front instead of getting a table. You can eat your dinner up there too, which is convenient. The bartender doubles as your server. We went there on a Friday night, and while the restaurant behind us was busy, the bartender was amazing. She was very attentive and quick, and the drinks were perfect. Unless you're in a party of 3 or more, I'd definitely recommend sitting up at the bar!"
Zack B.,"Peoria, AZ",21,27,,4.0,4/22/2010,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse has some very good pizza and micro brewed beers.. I have had their Pale ale and I can't think of the name of it, but it was very good and had a great flavor (if you like pale ales).. The pizza was great too, with fresh tomatoes on top (optional). Service was above average, but it wasn't very busy because we got their pretty late.  I would recommend this place to people who want to try a good pizza and different tasting beers.. They have really good cheap lunch specials too."
Jeremy G.,"Peoria, AZ",1,9,10,3.0,3/27/2012,Food here is ok. I can typically get in and out quickly.  The servers are always pleasant.  The food is priced higher than the taste but that happens to often these days.
Lindsay K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,24,5,4.0,8/25/2014,"The food is good, as to be expected considering this is a chain restaurant. Haven't had any issue with the service yet.. It just seems that every time I go there and get two entrées and an appetizer the bill is higher than it should be.. The spinach and artichoke dip is out of this world! They have a very large drink menu my some really creative drinks, also have a decent happy hour.."
Penny Lane X.,"Glendale, AZ",212,368,218,4.0,8/20/2009,"I have eaten at BJ's four times and I am a fan! (I was really surprised by this place, because I'm NOT a big fan of chain restaurants). The decor is spacious, relaxing, and enjoyable.  I've had great service on all of my visits, in fact on my recent visit, the waitress had brought out samples of various salad dressings for us to try when we were inquiring about the salad choices. Once thing I really LOVE about their salads is that they make their own dressings from scratch. I hate places that use dressing from a gallon jug laced with Sodium Benzoate (nothing like that nasty after taste!). The salad portions are HUGE and plentiful (enough for 2 to share OR take the other half home for leftovers). They are a bit pricey, but they do offer $5.95 Lunch Specials."
Bill J.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,17,4,5.0,2/19/2012,"I've been to BJ's twice now.  The last time I ordered a Jalapeno burger with fries ($9.95) with a stout beer called Tatanka ($5.00). My daughter had a cheeseburger and fries. She ordered her burger well done and I medium. Both burgers were perfectly cooked, juicy and as good as a hamburger could be. What made it most wonderful for us was the waitress was expedient, never letting us sit there with an empty glass ( within 30 seconds of our glass being empty she was there to see if we wanted more). The beers are phenomenal the decor is easy on the eyes. Bathrooms are clean and well kept. Our waitress made us feel as comfortable as if we were at home."
Spencer W.,"Tucumcari, NM",9,1,,5.0,6/7/2014,"Great food, big menu to choose a variety of foods, great service. If your looking for a place to go to eat or drink, go to bjs"
Chris W.,"Avondale, AZ",135,206,6,2.0,5/31/2009,"Disappointed... I mean, I expected much more out of this place.   Service - not very attentive. Food - average if not slightly below. (should you have to ask for WHAT the menu says it COMES WITH?) Atmosphere - nice, but rather sterile and cold (along with the seats under the A/C) Pricey - yes, for what we got and the rather bland taste (Fish & Chips / French Dip). Will we be back? - maybe - but not anytime soon.   The Yardhouse is hands-down a far superior place, service, food, quality and just all around better than BJ's. As Simon Cowell would say... Sorry!"
Albert H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",117,1222,281,3.0,6/11/2009,"I love the clean, cold modern atmosphere and long booths.  There's a spacious, airy feel.  Beers are above average, with at least one seasonal beer and several guest taps.  The new flatbread pizza appetizers are quite good, and although the pizza isn't a traditional Chicago thick crust, it still makes for a good thick crust pizza.  I like the calzones as well, though $13 for the bigger one is really up there in price considering that is the normal size at other places, and they don't charge $13. However, they are way overpriced.  $4.75 for a 16 oz. pint of beer is a bit steep, pizzas are at least a dollar or two higher than elsewhere, and even with the lunch specials we find that the tab for two people is always $50-60.  This is for casual pizza/brewpub dining, and we're not drinking a lot."
Mary L.,"Peoria, AZ",19,62,,4.0,5/6/2010,"I have eaten at BJ's several times and I have never been disappointed, today was no exception. I took a friend that had never been there before and she was very pleased as well. We had a Margarete pizza appetizer that was delicious!  We had chicken sliders and beef sliders and they were wonderful!  We had an excellent server, our food came quickly, was hot and really good. I would very much recomment BJ's and besides, they have Pepsi products - Hurray!!!!"
Debra W.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,2,,2.0,10/27/2013,Food was good but service was terrible. Went with large group of 12 to celebrate a  birthday. Plan was to eat have a few drinks then take in a movie. Ending up tsking 2 hours and thats not counting the time to eat
Nancy H.,"Peoria, AZ",3,89,49,5.0,1/7/2012,Love this place!! We always get their wings (traditional with hot sauce) and pizza.. so yummy!! Usually have great service as well!!
Paul B.,"Goodyear, AZ",1,15,,2.0,8/21/2013,"The restaurant is nice looking but the food experience is far from it.  The entree's we had were room temperature and the service was less than can be expected.  For what was paid we should have received much better food and service.  I have been to  many of their establishments in AZ and CA where we received much better food and service.  Cheesecake Factory is 10 minutes away and a much better option, one we should have used."
Beth S.,"El Mirage, AZ",141,484,17,3.0,2/16/2009,"This was my first visit to BJ's and I liked it quite a bit. We went this past weekend for a family member's surprise birthday party. There were 22 of us in our party ranging from 2 years old to 90 years old. It was arranged for us to have our own buffet of food which was great! The service staff was cordial, but I wouldn't call them friendly. We had 2 servers helping us and neither of them cracked a smile...not once. They did provide adequate service for such a large party but to not crack a smile even once is kind of odd.  We had cheese sticks, hot wings, and the artichoke dip with chips for our appetizers. They were set out on a table near us in buffet style. The cheese sticks were crispy on the outside and cheesy goodness on the inside. The artichoke dip was flavorful and the hot wings were actually quite good. The wings were served with NO SAUCE on them and you could add as much or as little wing sauce as you liked to your own taste. This I liked quite a bit. The wings had a nice crisp to them and were plenty meaty. The wing sauce had a good bite to it and I liked being able to control the temperature myself.   For our lunch, we had salad with a choice of viniagrette dressing or ranch dressing. It was a basic garden salad, nothing special, but it was fresh and crisp and looked freshly prepared instead of pre-made as one might expect for a catered lunch. We also had several choices of pizza. My favorite was the barbeque chicken pizza. We also had tomato and cheese, BJ's favorite, and I think it was Mediterranean pizza. The pizzas are Chicago style so expect that thick, fluffy crust. This worked nicely for the selections we had which were loaded with toppings. The crust was able to take all the toppings and not get soggy. There is nothing worse than soggy pizza crust.  All in all, the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I would have given this a 4 star rating had the servers been more personable.  I'll definitely go back again with a group or just with my family and try some other menu selections."
Tracey S.,"Surprise, AZ",0,12,,4.0,1/4/2013,I had luncheon bleu cheese flatbread pizza and salad. Loved the flatbread and salad was tasty with variety lettuce not head lettuce.  Three of us shared a chocolate pizzooky and it was scrumptious. Nice environment and friendly waitress. I would recommend.
