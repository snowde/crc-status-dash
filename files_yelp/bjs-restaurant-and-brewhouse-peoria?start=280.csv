Melanie H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",200,181,25,4.0,10/4/2011,"I'm a big fan of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  My boyfriend and I have been there three times and each time, were extremely happy.  The service has always been good and the food is delicious (especially the parmesan crusted chicken! yum yum).   I am usually a little hesitant with breweries because I have a very small range of beer that I find tasty but they have a few options that even I love! I definitely recommend!"
Jessica P.,"Chandler, AZ",174,290,18,4.0,12/30/2008,"Beer is ALWAYS good. But BJ's beer is actually really good.  Most beers, to me, are just that... beer.  But these had a great taste, texture and aftertaste.  I had the sampler, the blonde, the red, the heffe, the stout, some blueberry beer (that tasted like sparkling wine really) and something else that for the life of me I can't remember. My favorite was the heffe.   We had a bunch of appetizers... the avocado rolls are FLIPPING AWESOME!!! The just blind you with their awesomeness. (lol I love that Kung Fu Panda movie)  We also had the lettuce wraps, which were ok, and the chips and salsa.  The salsa was great... good texture and just the right spicyness to not kill you. Then after that we all had the Mediterranean pizza... it was GREAT.  That was probably THE THICKEST pizza I have seen in my life, without having the huge crust of a deep dish.  Incredibly good. Service was good with the waitress.  She was attentive and nice. The only thing that was bad was they advertised the pumpkin ale, and they had run out for the season.  If you're out, take down the ads!! We'll be back, definitely."
Melissa H.,"Surprise, AZ",111,107,2,2.0,11/29/2008,"So this wasn't my first trip to Bj's, but this was the most impressionable. It is close to my sister's house and makes for convenient dinners with the family. Last night was probably the worst experience we have had at BJ's so far and it left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth.  First off, my husband ordered some pasta with lemon butter sauce, feta, chicken, olive oil, and some other stuff in it. He asked for no tomatoes or red peppers because he is a wuss like that. About 10 minutes after we finally ordered (and I mean finally) the waitress came out and informed him that the kitchen said his meal would be bland without the tomatoes and it would not be the same dish at all, then asked him if he wanted to order something else. After the award winning sales pitch he just received he said of course and asked for a menu. The waitress then disappeared, took another table's drink order, then made her way back with a menu.  Secondly, our waitress was spacey, non existent, and never really checked up on us. Typically I would not be a stickler for something like that but one of the people in our party was given entirely the wrong meal. Somehow fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken turned into grilled chicken pasta with broccoli. The manager came and apologized but that was 15 minutes after the food runner went back into the kitchen to see about the order. Our waitress passed our table 4-5 times during this time and never once asked why a large plate of food sat untouched and every person in our table was turning to make eye contact. She never even apologized for the mix up later.  Then they brought my niece's food was brought out about 20 minutes before our food. We were a little concerned when our food did not follow and then about 10 minutes later the waitress came to explain that she sent it out early since ""kids eat slow."" In reality it just lead to my niece being finished with her food before the adults and had plenty of time to frolic in the left over mac and cheese.  Finally, when the bills were brought out she boasted that she did not charge our table for our non alcoholic beverages (an ice tea and sprite) and acted as if she had done us a favor. I would of much rather preferred that I didn't have to flag her down to ask for a beer (which ended up being watered down) and management would of taken some sort of responsibility for the long wait (35-40 minutes for food- pasta and a burger), poor customer service, and total mess up on an order."
Ayesha S.,"Chicago, IL",124,315,75,2.0,8/4/2008,"I'm not going to lie, I was super excited when I saw this new plaza going up on 99th Ave and Northern- super close to home and the prospect of a cool bar within the plaza (because Westgate and I aren't really friends). The plaza is still under construction, but BJ's didn't excite me very much.  It is your everyday chain brewery.  I hadn't been to one before but I might as well have been.   Positives: *The beer I tried; the nit bit or bit nit- I can't remember  which way that goes, was pretty solid.  It tasted like a very light hefeweizen.   *The cute little chandeliers. *Service was friendly and quick. Negatives:   *My nachos lacked cheese.  I never understand how restaurants can mess nachos up by not giving you enough cheese.  COMMON SENSE. *Nothing particularly special about this place. Because of proximity, I am guessing I will be back at BJ's.  I think I'm going to put the pizza on my to-do list and hopefully that will earn a star or two."
Craig S.,"Peoria, AZ",25,300,99,2.0,6/13/2010,"It was dinner time and we decided to go to BJ's. I knew since it was 7:00 there would be a wait. We were told it would be 45min. This was fine with us. We were seated in about 30 min. The layout of the restaurant is open but the noise level was not bad. You can easily carry on a conservation at your table. We were seated by a very energetic hostess. I did not get her name but she made you feel like they were glad to see you and service was going to be great. Our waiter was Gabby. She took our drink orders quickly and brought our drinks. I finished my ice tea before our meal was delivered. It was several minuets till this was noticed and was offered a refill. Everyone ordered and food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I had ordered the half soup and salad. Not anything complicated. Wedge salad and clam chowder in a sour bread bowel. Others ordered BBQ chicken chopped salad, Angel Hair Toscana, and a Traditional Calzone.  All the food did not arrive at the same time and we had to ask to get the remainder delivered. My clam chowder was very bland and did not have much taste. There was plenty of clam meat but it was hard to tell it was clam chowder by the taste. Definite don't go for the clam chowder. I asked about the calzone and was told it had almost no filling. Very little cheese and was mostly pizza dough. So don't go for the calzone. The others reported their chicken salad and angle hair pasta was very good. We had to wait again for some time to get refills on drinks. Our waiter was not very attentive. Will I go back? I will probably give them another chance. I do know what I will not order next time. I do like the look and feel of the restaurant."
Danny D.,"Pekin, IL",18,6,,5.0,1/11/2012,"Great food, Great beer choices, great atmosphere, great staff, what more can you ask for. The Grand Cru is delicious, especially if you let it warm up a little. With it a little warmer you can taste all the suttle notes in it. The Jambalaya is not the best I have had but is tasty and you get plenty. I had enough for 2 people. I try to visit here at least several times each year I come down to this area."
Michelle O.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",168,546,80,3.0,10/8/2008,"Sheesh, the last time I went to a BJs, I was screwing around in SoCal ages ago and probably couldn't afford a night of beer & pizza @ BJs on a student budget but went anyway... Fast forward to today--which means my student budget hasn't really expanded but I still end up tryin out BJs again.  Despite the myriad of beers, I knew what I was gettin--the sampler.  The bartender had memorized the details regarding beers offered in their sampler, which was impressive.  My six beers came with a place mat, describing each beer. Brewhouse blonde, hefeweizen, porter, a red, a stout, brewnette & an Oktoberfest were my selections.  I know the other beers had more official names but the one I liked best was the one I remember the name to--'Brewhouse blonde'.  It was light & a bit sweet.  (I'm not a beer connoisseur & have been a Miller Lite girl since I started drinkin beer).  Would I recommend you try it?  Sure.  My sentiment on the whole place/experience/atmosphere is exactly as rated 'A-OK'.  Nothing fantabulous, nothing crazy.  Just another chain that is less cheesy."
Cameron C.,"Surprise, AZ",179,2,,5.0,6/11/2010,"Amazing!!!!!! Service was great, food was wonderful and I highly recommend the cookies and cream pizooky! I've been to a lot of restaurants and am a stickler about service, friendliness, presentation and overall taste and experience! BJ's got it all! I can't tell you enough that I and everyone I know is inlove with this place! Everything from the style down to the bathrooms are fantastic! A+++ to BJ's and its staff! To the ppl below me... idk what's rong with you saying all those negative things about BJ's! You must be smoking crack!  If you haven't eatin there before give it a try! I promise you will NOT be disappointed!                           I LOVE YOU BJ'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Vera S.,"Aptos, CA",0,21,2,1.0,12/16/2012,"Very disappointed !   We were asked to wait and sat down to watch people coming after us being seated.  We asked again and told they would get to us, and no they were not taking names.  Waited again and were not seated until it happened again.  We were seated and not given menus.  When I asked about gluten free we were given a list of foods in different categories, with no prices.  Asked again and were finally given a menu.  We made our choices and waited a long time for each course.  We reminded our server 4 times about our dessert and waited 40 min to finally get it.  The check came and were charged a dollar more for an item the server quoted.  Her answer was ""sorry, I was wrong."""
Duane T.,"Glendale, AZ",1,29,,1.0,11/20/2010,"I visited this restaurant four times last week. All four times I sat at the bar. The first time I has good service and a personal pizza that was good.  I drank the IPA.  I was excited about having another brewpub nearby. The second time there was a second bartender. She was in the wrong business. She was not happy to be there and made sure you weren't happy either. No personality, slow and inattentive. I had the pale ale and the IPA with chicken wings. Once again the beer and food were good. The third trip the first bartender was on duty. OK service, nothing to write home about and the red beer was very good.  Up to this point I was looking forward to visiting again. On the final visit the first bartender spilled an entire glass of beer into my and my guest's laps. Accidents happen. I expected that at least the first round of beers would be free for having bathed in beer earlier. When the check came all beers where on the check. I asked about getting the beers taken off and was told no, it would get her in trouble.  I shouldn't have had to ask. When I did something should have been done. I paid my bill and decided there are plenty of places with good beer and good food. The service I had from the two bartenders is the best reason to not return. Occasional bad service is to be expected but two bad bartenders out of two says management needs to pay closer attention."
Claudia L.,"Tustin, CA",323,94,51,4.0,1/1/2011,"I've been going to BJ's Restaurant since i was a little girl and i'm really glad that it is still around.  My husband daughter and i were in the area and decided to stop by and eat some good pizza while watching some Sunday Football.  The.y have several screens, so we were able to watch several games at once and were were lucky enough that there was one booth left at the bar.  We ordered half pepperoni and half buffalo which is one of my favorites and of course the artichoke and spinach dip.  Our pizza arrive and it was perfectly fine but our server thought it was overcooked and surprised us with a whole new pizza without warning.  We had originally ordered a large and we think he misunderstood and brought us a medium, but he ended up bringing a whole other one without even asking.  We left with our stomach's full otherwise we would have ordered a pazzooki...darn."
Bridget Y.,"Glendale, AZ",252,174,17,3.0,3/30/2010,"Great lunch selection and pricing.  I had a cup of soup and a half a baked potato.  Soup was great.  Potato was decent.  I also had a beer, the Oasis seasonal.  Yummi!  They said it was like a fat tire, but smoother, and i totally agree.  I'd go back for sure.  They weren't too busy, but regardless, the service was great."
Jenny V.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,7,,3.0,7/18/2011,"Went here with friends, only had their appetizers, and they were very good, we had a little of everything. The fried artichokes were the best. We were there during happy hour and they were hopping. Service was excellent, our waitress was very friendly. It was pretty loud, so you found yourself yelling a lot, but other than that we enjoyed our visit, and friendly service."
J P.,"Glendale, AZ",14,7,14,1.0,5/2/2010,Food sucked!!! Very bland!!! Plus service was very slow. We were there for 45min. Before we got any salad or meals. Shoulda known better than to eat at one of these corporate owned garbage places. What a waste of $100 !!!!
Cjfj W.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,37,1,2.0,5/7/2010,"I went there after driving 9 hours from California. I was starving and decided to go there, because it looked pretty good. We split the basil-tomato-mozzarella pizza which was just ok. For the main course I decided to get the Bj's Burger, expecting that the burger which is named after their restaurant is the best burger they have. Normally after a 9 hour drive and I am extremely hungry everything tastes great, but the burger was probably the plainest burger I ever had. I doubt that we will return to this restaurant."
Suzy P.,"Peoria, AZ",3,5,,5.0,2/13/2011,"Epic win! My husband and I stumbled into this restaurant wanting to try out something new. We were blown away by the large selection, the great service and delicious food. This place quickly became a favorite and we will definitely be visiting more often. After all, there are so many more menu items to try!"
Erika G.,"Peoria, AZ",1,16,,2.0,9/13/2009,This place is ok. I love the curbside food pick-up option. This is great when you are on your way home from work and don't want to cook. Unfortunately the food is not consistent in quality.
Margaret N.,"Avondale, AZ",0,63,6,3.0,7/5/2012,The food is pretty consistent and good.  We are usually looking for a change of pace from I Hop or Village Inn type fare  when we go to BJs.   Usually have to wait to be seated so we try to avoid the usual peak hours.  Service can be inconsistent.  Sometimes have to flag down other staff to get served.  Luckily they've been responsive.  We've learned to be aggressive about getting drink refills.  The burgers are good. The Tomato soup is great and the Angel Hair pasta is good too.  Avoid the flatbread sandwiches- uninspired.  Ambiance is okay but acoustics aren't great- loud.   Parking is lacking especially on weekends.  We will be back in spite of spotty service.   Good alternative to the AppleBees routine when you are looking for a restaurant that serves alcohol.
John B.,"Chicago, IL",9,26,2,3.0,5/1/2010,"""Chicago style"" pizza was not Chicago style, but other than that - the servers were nice, decor was smart, and the food was good.  Tasty brews as well!  They have a spinach and artichoke pizza I highly recommend trying."
Jaime F.,"Washington, DC",27,96,2,4.0,3/7/2010,"I love their Mediterranean pizza and they also serve great beers.  Piranha ale is my favorite, and definitely worth the drive to the suburbs."
