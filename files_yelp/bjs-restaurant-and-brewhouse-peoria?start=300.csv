Matt W.,"Goodyear, AZ",413,144,34,3.0,11/2/2009,"We frequent Bj's a lot. I could see why people have said everything good and bad about the place. Sometimes there service is dead on, sometimes your on your own. Some menu items are fabulous, they have the best chicken wings in the valley in my opinion. Also there cheeseburger pizza is great without some items for me (pickles onions) The salads are always fresh, the chili size is good, the pot roast is some of the best I have ever had! On the contrary, The club sandwich is soggy and gross, and the meat taste really cheap and store bought. The wedge is kinda plain, and other items could be better.The beer is good with lots of different choices. But it is super cold in there sometimes even when it's 65 outside it's 60 on the inside, so bring a sweater for your bj expierience. Â (by the way this is way cheaper than yardhouse, with food nearly on the same level)"

Lee B.,"Goodyear, AZ",1,1,,2.0,7/30/2012,"We've dined at BJ's many times and had both decent and not-so-decent experiences. I doubt we'll be back after this last time. There were four of us and we had appetizers, cocktails, dinners, and dessert. One of the entrees came with soup or salad and tortilla soup was ordered. When it arrived it was barely luke warm. By the time our server, Lacee, came around we told her that the soup was cold and asked if it could be reheated. She took it away without a word but before she returned all of our entrees arrived. When she got back with the soup she started to pour the broth over the dry ingredients without even asking if we still wanted it since we were already eating our dinners. When we said that we no longer wanted it because our dinners were already there, she rolled her eyes, made a face, and left the table while we were still talking to her. The rest of the meal was uneventful, the food was adequate although certainly not exceptional. The server tried to be more friendly towards the end of the meal but never once apologized for the cold soup. On our way out we stopped to tell the manager (according to the receipt the manager was April) what had happened and she could not have been more unconcerned. She smiled and listened but made no apologies nor did she even mention anything about talking to the server about the rolling of the eyes and the face she made. She obviously didn't care that her customers were less than satisfied. This is not the first time that we've had what I would consider poor service for the caliber of restaurant. Between mediocre food and mediocre service we won't be returning which is sad because it's a beautiful restaurant with an extensive menu."
