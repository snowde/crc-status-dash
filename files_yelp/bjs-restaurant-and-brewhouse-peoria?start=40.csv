Thomas W.,"Chandler, AZ",1,23,7,1.0,12/17/2016,"Beware those with allergies. My wife and I use to frequent BJ'S, we've never had an issue. However, this location made my wife extremely ill, and it happened at the Cardinal's stadium right before a game. We ordered takeout and noted her extreme allergy to dairy - she even ordered a salad that contained no dairy, yet about half way through the salad she noticed a slice of shredded cheese - and then more. My wife spent the game we were supposed to enjoy violently ill and very far away from home. You have ruined BJ'S for us. I called that day, my wife emailed, we were apologized to and told the staff would be re-education on the severity of allergies and cross contamination. A giftcard was mentioned, but never delivered. It's the principle of the matter, if you don't follow up on what you say, my wife will never be safe to eat at your concept. If you have an allergy STAY AWAY."
Jonathan V.,"Glendale, AZ",160,1,,1.0,8/14/2017,"Very disappointed. Calamari was the consistency of rubber and tasted awful. When our food came to the table, i unrolled my napkin and there was chewing gum stuck to the silverware and napkin. After eating, i asked for a to go box and it took the server yet another 20 minutes until he brought us the check, which I already asked for twice within the 20 mins from 2 other servers. Worst BJ's I've ever been to hands down. $0 tip left. Shoulda brought it up the manager but was pretty pissed."
Tammie L.,"Morristown, AZ",109,9,3,5.0,6/3/2017,"Artichoke and spinach dip was amazing! The house hot wings perfect! The brisket bacon burger, wow! I could not save room for my piezookie however I have had one before and no words can describe the gumminess! App is awesome! Atmosphere just right! Staff is great! Joe never left us without a refill."
Ashleigh J.,"Glendale, AZ",54,23,53,5.0,7/31/2017,"One of my favorites for ""deep dish"" pizza. This location is smaller than some but my favorite in the valley. Great staff and  food is always cooked to perfection. Highly recommend this place for date night, family night, b-days or celebrations, watching the game or just getting a rich and tasty local brew. This place is always a win. Moderately priced. Reasonable portions. Any appetizer is a tasty start. Enjoy"
Cheryl J.,"Sun City West, AZ",15,21,3,4.0,7/16/2017,Love this place. Our server was fun. Food was good. Beer is cold and the wine was fine. Love their bogo and all my coupons.
Mike X.,"Tehachapi, CA",7,44,5,5.0,10/16/2017,This is my favorite BJs. The service is always outstanding.  The food and beer is standard for a BJs which is pretty good. But the service here has always been a notch above
Este B.,"Phoenix, AZ",59,22,27,5.0,11/16/2016,"Been coming here for about a year now. We go for our company lunch. Awesome that you could order online and set it for a specific time when you are in a rush. This place gets better everytime. We always get The best beginnings platter for starters. I order the bj's classic pizza or The great white. You can never go wrong with those. I also get a pizookie. If you've never had it, believe me, order one you won't regret it."
Cindy B.,"Sun City, AZ",0,5,,5.0,6/27/2017,"Excellent! Food is wonderful. Drinks even better, and service is always good! We just discovered this location, so close to home. We will be regular customers for sure.  Our server, Steve, was awesome. Pleasant, funny, attentive, (but not too attentive)."
Samantha D.,"Peoria, AZ",2,24,2,3.0,4/10/2017,"My family loves the food and drink here and we usually dine there about twice a year. My husband enjoys the craft beer and there is never any complaint about the food. However, the service in the dinning room is always painfully slow. It takes so long to get a drink refill or find your server when you need them for something."
Monika Q.,"Goodyear, AZ",146,10,,4.0,6/20/2017,"Me and my boyfriend always come here when we can't decide where to eat. Inexpensive, a really good variety on the menu and I've always had a good experience, minus the waiters, you either get a really awesome one or one that's brand new and knows little to nothing about the menu."
Janed B.,"Glendale, AZ",2,180,,4.0,9/7/2017,"Enjoyed the barbecue chicken chopped salad with fried onion rings on top. Salad was huge so took most home. The freshly made chunky guac dip was delicious, a good sized portion that was inexepensive. Dessert was cookie and ice cream, a special three dollar deal to benefit those affected by TX hurricane. I hardly touched the monkey bread portion of my dessert, that was too much bread,dry and flavorless, but polished off the generous 2 scoops of ice cream."
Hindreen A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,5.0,9/24/2017,Amazing food and very friendly service specifically precilla  ! Definitely will be back :)
Antony M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",77,118,9,2.0,7/3/2016,"I'm visiting my Dad this weekend and we stopped in to get some drinks, lunch, and watch the ball game.  The place was fairly crowded for a Sunday afternoon and they only had one bartender. She got very backed up and my Dad had to wait a good fifteen minutes for his martini. I ordered a Diet Coke which came out flat.  We ordered chips and salsa to start, which were originally delivered to the wrong table. When we asked for a refill (as indicated by the menu) it took a while and they only brought out a half plate of chips and no salsa.  We opted to go elsewhere for our lunch instead of continuing to torture ourselves.  Note to BJ's: I don't live here and I'm not interested in getting anything for free or you doing anything else for me to ""make it right."" This is just a warning to others to take your money elsewhere."
Austin M.,"Glendale, AZ",0,1,,5.0,9/19/2017,"First time being at this location in a few years, and must say I picked the perfect evening to come in. Our server Crystal was super friendly and helpful. The food was excellent, particularly the Parmesan-Crust Chicken, and their own brewed beers were especially tasty. Definitely plan to return in the near future."
Donna W.,"Sun City West, AZ",1,18,,4.0,9/6/2017,"I had a Cobb salad and it was delicious. My husband had soup and salad and he liked it. The menus is like a book with lots of options to choose from. Our waiter was polite, knowledgeable , and available."
Benny C.,"Peoria, AZ",5,135,8,3.0,8/7/2016,I like their Chicago pizza. The beer is pretty pricey and not really worth it in my opinion but it's still a decent place to get some food.
Jesabel F.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,31,76,4.0,10/13/2016,I love the pizza at this place. Pan crust BJs favorite is the best. The wings are good. Just tried the root beer  glaze wings. They were really tasty just the right flavor. My family and I have had some of the pasta plate which are good but we always come back for the pan crust pizza. My husband loves the selection of beer and enough TVs to watch whatever game is playing. The service is good. So far all the staff has been great each and every time we come in.  Don't forget dessert! PIZOOKIES
Alyssa C.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,17,22,1.0,2/23/2017,"So someone did contact me about this and left me a message and when I called back, almost immediately afterwards, apparently that person was gone. They said they'd leave my name and number for her and I haven't heard a thing since. I get that the restaurant business is busy, I work in the business so I understand, but I'm still disappointed and won't be returning."
L L.,"Mesa, AZ",215,308,65,1.0,12/5/2016,"I can't speak for everyone in our large group as far as how they felt about their food, but my fish and chips was the WORST I have ever had!! I love fish and chips and order them often. It doesn't even have to be that good for me to enjoy! If we weren't there with a bunch of my hubby's co-workers I would have returned it!! I didn't even take the leftovers home despite having a convection oven to reheat it it up perfectly. The waitress took the entire meal and never even questioned if there was a problem! Also their ""tarter sauce"" is runny!! I will say the wedge fries were very good! My husband was ""okay"" with his food. I am not interested in ever going back."
Kurt G.,"Goodyear, AZ",61,38,3,4.0,9/10/2016,First time here but wont be my last. It seems like they are sort of a sports bar but I think they need more TVs as the coverage lacks.They have a very extensive menu. Everyone was happy with their meal but my dad. Poor him. He ordered the Chowder Bowl and got only the bowl. They were very apologetic and said he could keep the bowl while they prepared one for him in the bowl. What came next was a shock. They really over baked the bread bowl and it was dark near burnt and very crusty. They should never have delivered to the table. I got the the spicy pig pizza and my wife got the old country tomato basil. She ordered extra artichoke. Just a little advice When someone orders an extra topping out it on top so they can see it. At first she returned it because you could not really see but it was there and she did enjoy. We got biegnets for dessert and there were very good.  Service was excellent and attentive. For the type of restaurant I thought the ambiance was nice.  A little more quality control could bring this place to a top choice among the sports bar type restaurants.
