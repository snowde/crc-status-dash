Rene W.,"Phoenix, AZ",49,9,,1.0,12/30/2016,"I dined at bjs tonight, I ordered the chicken bacon club sandwich with fries. When the dish came out the fries were cold so naturally I sent it back asking for fresh fries. The second time around the fries were still cold and after eating my sandwich I found a hair hiding from where my sandwich was, I will not come back."
Lisa M.,"Sun City, AZ",30,19,8,5.0,2/23/2017,"I took my family here on Valentine's Day & the food/service was fantastic!!  The wait was only 5 minutes. Our waitress was warm, friendly & very helpful with beer & food selection. She had the patience of a saint with 2 seniors. My dad had the baked ziti which was absolutely delicious, my mom the spaghetti with jumbo meatballs also very flavorful & I had the chicken with vegetables from their light & fit section which was delicious! For dessert we ordered their signature freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. Total crowd pleaser.    As this restaurant is a brewery I must mention that their selection was vast with great variety. They offer 3 free 1ounce samples which our waitress helped select (but you can choose any on the menu) & the one my dad selected was delicious! He was very happy.    We can't wait to go back & try more selections from their huge menu. Awesome restaurant!!!  Great decor inside too... huge space!  Ya gotta go check it out ;-))"
Trisha T.,"Peoria, AZ",0,27,8,5.0,4/16/2017,"This place never disappoints, they have every craving you can have , plus there alcohol selection is great."
Gabriela T.,"Avondale, AZ",2,13,2,5.0,11/18/2015,"Strawberry blonde is all I gotta say! Bartender offered this and man!!! I'm still dreaming of this drink! The name says it all, a hint of strawberry flavor. Not sweet just the perfect mixture of flavor to make you want to have one after another...  I also had the North Beach Mahi Mahi!!  This plate was delicious, the shrimp was cooked just right. The flavors all together are simply delightful! The Kalamata olives, tomatoes, and onions;all on some couscous. It kinda reminded me of a soup since it has lots of juice.  I usually don't finish my food wherever I go, but this I finished it and was very tempted to lick the plate!"
Janice G.,"Mukilteo, WA",2,21,,5.0,3/16/2017,"We had a fantastic dinner!  Great food, and even better service!"
Debra G.,"Avondale, AZ",31,33,10,5.0,7/4/2016,Went here for dinner last night.  I got steak house one. It was so delicious best steak dinner I ever had. I ate it all and usually when I eat steak out I save half for later. Well I didn't with this one. It was that good. If you go there you have to try it. You'll love it like I did.
Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1416,1110,17405,3.0,7/31/2016,The only item that is outstanding here is the Pizookie. They have a large variety. My favorite Pizookie has to be the double chocolate flavor with vanilla ice cream. I also prefer caramel sauce on mine.
Dione G.,"Glendale, AZ",48,78,106,5.0,6/19/2016,I would like to thank the GM April. She was absolutely amazing. She eased my stress and made my dining experience at BJ's embarrassment free. Dealing with a mobility scooter can be difficult especially when areas are packed with people who don't see you. The food was perfect and flavorful. The restaurant was clean and staff busy but cheerful. Tony our server was very sweet and attentive as much as possible with as busy as it was. I was very impressed with how everything turned out for our Father's Day dinner. I will most definitely be returning. I highly recommend this place.
Andrea M.,"Glendale, AZ",1,55,,4.0,3/1/2017,"My husband loves to eat at this place. They have something on the menu for everybody. They are super busy though so our orders have gotten mixed up a few times. Overall, still a good restaurant to go to."
Anita N.,"Avondale, AZ",28,133,70,2.0,6/6/2016,"Food has always been above average here but the manager here (tall, older man) isn't so friendly! Have a seat, here is why: Being the techies we are we were excited to see that they had a mobile app now where you can pay your check with Apple Pay! The waiter dropped off the ticket but all we had to do was pull up our table number, check out, and was emailed the receipt fairly quickly.  I then opened the check on the table and noticed a different amount than what I had paid. The waiter simply forgot to add on an extra Coke and did so last minute that it didn't update in the app. I notified the waiter and was thinking all we owed was the extra $3 for the soft drink and would have been fine paying that separately. The waiter went to see what was going on but the manager returned. He started by suggesting possibly doing a second charge on the physical card to see if it actually went through and if I ended up getting charged twice then they'd refund one. I frowned upon that simply because I'm not going to make another large charge on my card just to ""see what happens"". I pulled up the receipt that was emailed to me by BJ's showing everything I paid for, it was just short the $3 drink.  The manager then sat down next to me at our booth, without asking, to look at my phone. I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable because there was really no room for him so his arm and leg were brushing right up against mine. It was so unprofessional and a complete invasion of privacy and I shot a horrified look at my boyfriend on the other side. Quickly I showed him the email on my phone hoping he would be satisfied and move away from me, but it was like he had never seen an email like that before...I had to explain that it was sent front BJ's and where it said I used Apple Pay.  I even offered to show him my bank account...something I shouldn't have to do or feel that I should defend myself with but we weren't going to be painted as thieves. At this point he was still rudely hovering over my phone I had to obviously turn my phone away so he wouldn't see me entering in my credentials. He finally got the hint and got up to go check to see if it was showing as paid in the system yet.  I pulled up my account and sure enough it was showing as being taken out and pending, it was incredibly awkward once again to have to show a view of my account transactions and prove we were not trying to skip out on the check. Sorry but I'm not going to charge my card again when we have all kinds of proof showing we've paid and we weren't trying to screw anyone over. The manager simply said ""well it's not showing as cleared so I'm just going to have to eat the check..."" and as I was about to speak he walked off without another word. We just sat there in silence for a bit as the manager stared at us from the front desk.  Sir...you're not ""eating the check"" as you passive aggressively stressed to us. You got paid, the money didn't just go into oblivion from my bank account, the BJ email receipt confirmed it, you were just short $3 for the Coke which we were happy to pay for on a different ticket. The waiter, a kinder soul, came back a few minutes later and I gave him the quick rundown of what happened because I certainly didn't want him getting the blame for the last minute addition. He went back to check the register and BOOM it was now cleared and he said that we were all good. It just took a little time to get updated apparently but the manager clearly lost his cool early and lacked a sense of boundaries with customers.  After an already long day and wanting to just sit down and get a good meal somewhere nice it was a real disappointment to then be hassled for something that was no fault of our own. We were the ones that brought up the issue and asked what we could do to remedy it not expecting the manager and how we'd ultimately get treated. I was just happy to be done with something that could have easily been solved...a measly $3!!! It wasn't that hard.  Will be reaching out to corporate regarding the personal space issue though, an apology from the manager would have been nice at least as we left.  We've come here for many birthdays and get togethers, however this customer experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and won't be recommending this place again."
Lynn G.,"Waterford, WI",0,36,16,3.0,12/3/2016,First time here.  We found the food just ok - nothing spectacular.  Tried the craft root beer which was ok as well.  Server was friendly but after she took our order we didn't see much of her - someone else brought our food and she didn't check back in until we were done with our food.   We had the opportunity to go to a BJ's in Orlando FL and decided not to based on this experience.
Jaci U.,"Phoenix, AZ",37,25,2,5.0,12/18/2016,"I am in the service industry and my husband is in culinary. We are hard to please when we go out but this BJ nailed it. Joanna,our server, was the best I have ever had. She catered to our children and was always available for us. My husband was impressed not only with the taste of his burger but the presentation was lovely too. Thanks for a great family night out."
Bernice G.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",13,30,48,5.0,7/3/2016,"Awesome waitress, ask for Crystal! We had the lettuce wraps, stuffed mushrooms and clam chowder! Oh and the triple chocolate pizookie. Started with a Bloody Mary! Yum!!"
Bebe S.,"Schenectady, NY",13,18,36,5.0,10/19/2015,"Every October I visit Phoenix and always make a special trip to BJ's. My mom and I love to grab a seat at the bar,so we can converse with the friendly bartenders. Everyone is always so pleasant and conscious of making sure we are completely satisfied.  We have never had a bad meal and the drinks and dessert are spectacular! I wish we had a BJ's near my hometown"
Lori G.,"Santa Monica, CA",38,10,3,5.0,7/30/2016,"We absolutely love BJ's Brewhouse. From the hostess to the wait staff and the food, everything is fabulous. I love being able to use their app to get my name on the wait list as I leave my house.  Will recommend to others and definitely will be going back often."
Laura S.,"Waddell, AZ",4,34,12,5.0,10/12/2016,"Every time we go we love the food and love the service!! Recommend getting the app, for some great reward points etc..the Hickory brisket bacon burger is amazing!!!!! And you just have to get a Pizookie!! The Monkey bread and the salted caramel are our favorite!! I also love how they will substitute anything I need to for diet restrictions!!"
Robyn H.,"Surprise, AZ",3,4,,4.0,1/9/2017,"Very friendly staff, the beer was excellent, did not eat but overlooked the menu and will definitely be back!!"
Robert A.,"Phoenix, AZ",33,58,278,5.0,4/22/2015,"Wow. Cant believe the ambiance herem  Great view awesome staff a menu to die for. Upon arrival at 645 was given a beeper. We were notified with a flash and vibration also had a text sent too our phone how kewl is that. Greeted by a wonderful waitress.  My wife ordered a tomatoe mozzarella salad and a sour dough bread bowl toasted nicely the chicken tortilla soup was cooked to perfection, next entree was a california burger very juice and thick with a side of fries. I had a small 9 inch deep dish pizza with sausage and a side of cripsy breaded mozzarella sticks and marinera sauce yumm. This place has a special look and ambience .  Reservation also are availabke. The menu is LARGE bring a empty stomach it is one of my favorite places now.   Price for all we had was 64.00"
Jacque H.,"Vancouver, WA",14,25,19,4.0,7/4/2016,"Whenever we are in the area we visit BJ's. Although the noise level is high, the service is always good. The menu has a wide range from appetizers, pizza, burgers, to full dinners of Parmesan crusted chicken, salmon, and steaks. Food is good quality and tasty. Has the right amount of pop flavor in each plate. I highly recommend the turkey burger. Best anywhere. They make their own beer, which is good. I wouldn't go there just for the beer, though. Be prepared to wait  , everyone knows a good place."
