Anthony N.,"Avondale, AZ",16,7,,3.0,4/17/2016,Came here with a party of 8. Didn't take very long to get seated. However the food was just below average.  Vegetables were not washes correctly and tasted like dirt. Waitress was sub par. Did not check in on the table regularly and took a long time to get our checks. The best part of the whole meal was dessert. I would not recommend this to friends.
George G.,"Peoria, AZ",0,2,,1.0,6/17/2017,"If I could give negative stars I would. Ordered delivery from here to try it out and not only did we not get half of our order, but food was cold and gross. My wife called and complained about incomplete order as was told they would send gift card for compensation, well it's been about 2 months and still nothing. Wrote to company and complained and never got a response. Horrible customer service and would not recommend delivery as food was cold and gross upon delivery."
Adrienne D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,3.0,7/2/2017,"The menu selection is great, the food was great, the service was okay- I don't know what the training is like, but I think the servers need to know the menu. Both the bartender and waiter had to look item up on their computer pad. That being said, we will return."
Amanda K.,"Surprise, AZ",7,52,7,1.0,8/3/2016,"I have gotten food from here multiple times with no issues. This past Monday (8/1/16), I ordered two pizzas and a kids meal to-go. Our food was horrible! The first issue was that one of the pizza's had NO sauce on it. You can see they put a tiny bit on there but I asked for extra sauce and it was bare. If I had time, I would have had them remake it but since I didn't have an extra 20min to sit there, I just asked for extra sauce on the side so I could make it right myself. Wasn't the same though and didn't taste good. The other pizza did not taste how it normally did- it tasted ""off"" according to my husband. Needless to say, we ended up wasting $30+ that night. We will NOT be wasting money here again."
Joel G.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,11,9,5.0,6/26/2016,This place is always Busy but usually can get a seat with on 30 minutes. We have eat there quite a few times and the food and beer has always been great. The wait staff has always been friendly and spot on. Large menu with lots to pick from for all types of tastes.
Yvonne H.,"Denver, CO",59,67,165,3.0,1/18/2015,"We stopped this evening since we were both hungry and wanted to catch the football game. My other half was a bit disappointed since we missed the first game and had a training session instead for Super Bowl volunteers, since I thought this would help with the football withdrawal and it did. Bad part: We were seated in an area that had several large parties that left and  being cleaned up and ready set for two more large parties.   Waited for 10-15 minutes trying ALL the wait staff in our area to get something to drink. Of course they all walked by as if I wasn't seen. The one server that was supposed to have our table wouldn't acknowledge we were there even if I was naked. Too bad she was the same girl complaining to her boss when we got there about too much work. She wasn't very quiet about it. Good part: Jessica saw me trying to get attention and greeted us and asked if she could get the drinks since the other girl was busy.   Apparently she was assigned or agreed to serve us since after she brought drinks and she let us know she was taking out table. She was friendly and attentive.  Kept the refills coming on the mock tail tea I decided to try. The pizza was smaller than I expected but on second thought was a blessing since it left room for dessert.. Can we say Beignet time? The hubs had the bacon cheeseburger and a Light Switch beer. Almost finished it too but it was well not medium as ordered, cold bun and not skinny fries but the wedges as he wanted but he was too hungry to send it back. The Beignet was yum...I love those things.  Someday  I hope to visit New Orleans for one there. I rate this location a 3 because we have always had great service and food in prior visits but a 2 for this evening and Jessica was a 10."
Laura W.,"Glendale, AZ",0,5,,2.0,5/21/2017,I typically love this restaurant. I recently used their app to order food to be delivered. The app was very easy to use but I was charged twice. I called the store to ask them about it and spoke to a man. He said that he can't see anything yet because it is sent through Uber Eats first then sent to them. I asked him if I should call back after it's delivered. He said yes but he would talk to the manager to see if they know why it's happening and he would call me back if he found anything out. The food was delivered and was great. I called back and asked for a manager. They got the manager on the phone and I told him what happened and that I called earlier. He said that he was the person I talked to earlier and he is still only showing one charge. I was a little confused because when I called the first time he told me he has to talk to a manager and now he's saying he's a manager. He said to wait a few days to see if one of the charges drops off and if it doesn't to call back. I'm hoping this gets figured out but I'm a little bothered by getting the runaround. I really don't want to pay $80 for a $40 meal!
Jake T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",23,25,13,3.0,5/2/2016,"I was close to giving this a 4-star, but I think the only thing holding me back was the appetizer. I read tons of yelp reviews before going here with a group outing - and got scared away from the fish. My buddy had the cherry chipotle salmon and said it was great. I didn't want to run the risk of a crappy meal. I had the buffalo burger, and while the meat and cook were decent enough - what made this dish so good was the barbecue sauce, pico de gallo, and grilled green chiles that were topping it. Seriously, amazing. The cole slaw that came with it was less than desirable haha, but I still a few days later now cannot get over how good the sauce and condiments for that burger were.  I had the calamari appetizer though, and it was really lack luster. Definitely do not recommend that. It was a good enough for me to be willing to try it again sometime."
Jazmin P.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",1,21,3,4.0,6/7/2017,We came here for happy hour and The NBA Finals. Our server Garrett was a pleasure. He was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. Our drinks never were empty and he was overall a great server. He recommended appetizers and drinks to pair with. We will definitely be coming back.
Deangelo H.,"Surprise, AZ",1,6,4,4.0,6/5/2016,"I am giving 4 stars. I had the ribs, French fries and house salad.  The ribs were delicious, not dry or old. Not that much meat on them so you need to order a full slab. Bbq sauce was good. Nice sweet flavor.  The shoe string fries was delicious as well.  House salad was ok. I'm just not a big fan of spring leaf lettuce.  Server forgot somethings we ordered also seemed like she was irritated with the fact that we had questions about the menu as it was some of my guests first time there."
Joyce W.,"Chandler, AZ",3042,631,2809,4.0,11/16/2013,"#100: It could be the chocolate mint martini followed by the candy cane martini which was then followed by the pomegranate sunset but I had a great time tonight [as I always do]! I went with the crew originally to another brewery at Westgate but the ASU game made parking non-existent so off to Park West we go!  BJ's was the natural choice for an evening of drinks, food, and good company.  The wait time at BJ's at 7:30pm on a Saturday was said to be 25-30 minutes but we were seated after 10 minutes.  No complaints here!  At such a big establishment, the atmosphere was of course gorgeous.  Let's talk food!  We had ordered: Crispy Calamari:  Typical fried squid you can get anywhere.  I personally love the garlic aioli. Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms:  Delicious, giant, and juicy!  Just like I like my men!  ;D  Just kidding... kinda.  Seriously though, I can eat that lemon pesto by the spoonful.   Two Steak plates [one had lobster too]:  Both steaks were not cooked to medium-rare and the lobster was a bit too salty.  Both steaks were offered to be redone but hey, we're not picky.  We ate that red meat like champs.  And that lobster tail... demolished.  I really liked the mashed potatoes!  The clam chowder accompaniment and the Caesar salad were also yummy --- especially the chowder! Hawaii Mahi-Mahi:  This was my main dish.  I was completely happy and in love with the juicy mahi-mahi.  The refreshing pineapple fried rice and stir-fry veggies made everything just a touch sweeter.  They had some Sriracha sauce on the side.  Don't be fooled by the fancy description: it's just pure sexy Sriracha. Cajun Pasta:  It was yummy!  The garlic bread was good. The creamy tomato sauce wasn't too spicy --- something I'm always grateful for.  I think food is meant to be tasted.  I don't need to be licking a chili pepper!   Grilled Chicken Pasta:  Creamy pasta is ALWAYS a good thing.  We got the grilled chicken instead of the blackened chicken and it was perfectly match.  I would've been happy with just a bowl of that rotelle noodles with the cream sauce.   Overall it was a lovely evening and our waiter was very charismatic, charming, and accommodating [one of us HAD to watch the Boise St. game.  x_x].  Cheers, BJ's!  Thanks for the great evening!"
Raquel A.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,111,13,2.0,10/7/2016,"Who knows how many stars it would get if we were able to actually try the menu.  I'm assuming that based on the number of people waiting for a table, he food should be pretty good.  So you're probably wondering why I'm giving it 2 stars if we apparently didn't eat here.  This review is solely based on service, or lack thereof.  We walked in and there were 5 people ahead of us at the check-in desk.  When we walked out more than 5 minutes later, the same 5 people were still in line.  There were 3 people behind the desk.  One was on the phone, and I'm not really sure what the other 2 were doing.  I thought one was talking to the first guest in line, but then she turned and was doing who knows what and the line still wasn't moving.  If a place is that busy and has a long line of people wanting to check-in, they need to make it a priority to address their guests - don't ignore them."
Liliana C.,"Phoenix, AZ",51,74,23,3.0,9/7/2016,Three stars because the beer is amazing.. always try the seasonal beers and they are great... had the wings and delicious... the jambalaya was soooo salty  I asked my friend who had it previously and had she had the same experience...
Dan S.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,6,,5.0,5/5/2017,We love this restaurant.  From the pizza to the southern fried chicken you can't beat BJ's.
Sandi D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,2/19/2017,"I am a vegetarian and ordered a sandwich with a veggie patty and no bacon. The sandwich came with bacon but luckily I saw the bacon before taking a bite. The manager offered a salad or soup while I waited for my replacement sandwich to be made which I did not want. This was the only accommodation offered. The replacement sandwich took forever to receive which resulted in me pretty much eating by myself since everyone else's food was gone by then. On my last bite of sandwich, I saw a small piece of food that I did not recognize but went ahead and ate the bite. I am certain it was a small piece of bacon fat. In addition to this, I ordered a beverage and had to flag down the waiter to get it because he had forgotten. This level of service is totally unacceptable."
Amber L.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",0,8,1,5.0,5/2/2017,I have gone to this specific location three times and have never had any concerns. The food is always fast and no matter which waiter/waitress you get you can expect to receive great customer service. They all know the menu and the sizes of all the items which makes it really nice if you have questions on what to eat. Even when they are busy the wait time is never over 5 minutes. I will always recommend this location to friends and family!
David S.,"Glendale, AZ",1,26,4,4.0,9/11/2016,"Pretty standard fair here. Nice place, clean and friendly staff. The food is always good as well. Only issue I have with this place is the fact that the darn floors are so slippery I have almost slipped several times and I've seen a couple people fall. Take care while you walk through the place."
Lola M.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",5,156,64,5.0,1/9/2016,"I stopped in with my niece and son today. I had the California Club with wedge fries, my niece had the baked ziti and my son had the kids hamburger. My club had nice thick pieces of carved turkey, it was perfect. The kids meal was on the large side and came with two burgers. The only leftover we had were a few of my sons wedge fries. The servers were very attentive and kept our drinks filled. We plan on returning for my birthday, so we can try some of their desserts."
G J.,"Sun City, AZ",0,40,7,5.0,9/12/2016,"Dropped in on a whim for dinner and don't regret our decision whatsoever!  The food was great, the service was every bit as great.  Thank you, Joshua!  There were others who helped make our experience a good one but he was the one who answered our questions and helped us to make the right choices.  I'm stuffed.  We'll do this again for sure!"
Regina M.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,30,,4.0,10/6/2016,Love the food but the wait was a little long but well well worth it. The service was good to especially for a bust Friday night. Thanks
