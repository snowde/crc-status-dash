Patricia B.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,335,363,5.0,12/31/2017,"This review is mostly regarding their holiday gift card promotion. Stopped here today to get a last minute gift card and I was quite impressed. For the purchase of a $100 gift card we got: *$100 gift card, obviously : P *$25 card to use early 2018 *VIP card (which entitles you to 20% of your check from January to February 13) *Plus 2 glasses. *Plus the points or cashback depending on which card you use to pay Nick was super attentive and professional, clearly explained the terms. (Good job Nick!) Now, about the food, we have work lunches here often, food is good and service is fast. Their lunch menu is decent. Just a few times we have been there for dinner and it is too loud for my taste."
Reinhardt H.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,71,27,5.0,11/6/2017,"What a huge menu. With that much selection, you would think the food is average, but its actually much better than average. Their pizza stands up to dedicated pizza joints. Burgers are nothing to complain about. Beef dip sandwich is also a solid choice. They serve a good ice tea and also have a herbal drink that is really good - the name escapes me. The desserts are the place they might be a bit weak. I guess here too much selection hurt quality."
Em M.,"New York, NY",0,58,189,3.0,9/30/2017,"The sriracha queso dip was pretty good. The barbeque bison burger and the black and bleu house burger were both great. The Oktoberfest was ok, but i prefer the pirhana pale ale. Overall the food was good.  The service could be better. The starter was brought out at the same time as the burgers and, and felt a little rushed."
Keith C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,80,11,2.0,1/8/2018,"I judge every sports bar by its burger. Bjs earned its place at the bottom of the heap. I had a bacon avocado burger and it should had been named the lime juicebuger. I understand they add the citrus so the avocado doesn't turn brown in 4 hours while they leave it out, but the amount of lime was overpowering. My second burger without the avocado was unseasoned dry and had frigid cheese. Not good value."
Brad S.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,218,15,3.0,8/13/2017,"Nice selection of house brews.  I like the fact that they have other breweries on tap too.  The pizza and wings are good and you can't skip the pizookie for dessert.  The churro pizookie although technically not a cookie is pretty fun to eat.   I come here in spurts because the food tends to be lacking in consistency.  Sometimes the pizza is great, other times you wonder what happened to the toppings and then next time you're eating doughy under-cooked slices. Service is pretty much the same.  One night outstanding, the next it's like a rookie is serving you and then on the odd occasion you get the what did I do to deserve this treatment."
Brittany M.,"Phoenix, AZ",474,73,197,4.0,6/17/2017,"The food and service were good when we stopped by here recently at the bar. Here's what we shared: - Bowl Of Piranna Pale Ale Chili *big enough for two people - Piranna Pale Ale - Vegetable Shrimp Penne Primavera For everything, we spent only $39.15, not including tip. If you are looking for a good place to grab drinks and food relatively late at night, this BJ's location is a good choice."
Stacey K.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/11/2017,"We have always enjoyed the food here. Our favorites are BJ's favorite deep dish pizza, BBQ chicken salad and tonight we tried mozzarella sticks & calamari! They were both great and quickly gobbled up. The service tonight was excellent!"
Jerry W.,"Mesa, AZ",16,13,1,5.0,12/8/2017,Gabe and his team hosted my department's annual Christmas Luncheon. It could not have gone smoother. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  I would not hesitate to hold another event here.       Great Job BJ's!!!
Stephanie S.,"Mesa, AZ",10,3,,1.0,12/27/2017,Never eating here again. Had the ribs on Christmas Eve. Spent the night vomiting the ribs. Ruined my Christmas. Never again.
Lindsey B.,"Peoria, AZ",118,57,33,4.0,8/3/2017,Really enjoyed their $4 beers! Ordered calamari and artichoke dips both were really great but my mahi mahi tacos were just ok. The service was pretty good and their were plenty of tvs to watch the game.
Treena C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",9,154,114,3.0,2/22/2017,"We ate lunch at BJ's today and it was okay. Lunch gets pretty busy. They have a large menu which I wish they would reduce to put a little more quality in to each dish. I ordered chicken tenders with fries. It was a decent lunch size but the fries were cold. My dinner mate ordered the soba noodle dish which had a nice flavor but was pretty soupy. On a bright note our server was James and he was very efficient and polite. We have eaten here before and the food has been better, they just need more care for each dish."
Justin F.,"Gilbert, AZ",6,71,313,5.0,9/3/2017,An amazing dinner here last night! The vibe is wonderful. We got seated immediately once we walked in. The staff are extremely friendly and fast. And the food was amazing. Highly recommend if you are in the area!
Cindy P.,"Las Vegas, NV",93,141,580,4.0,7/2/2017,"What a fun brewery!  They had so many different kinds of beer from so many different places.  I ordered a beer made by them called Nitwit. I know, very appropriate. It had this nice hint of orange. We got some onion strings as appetizers. They came with a ranch and another house made dressing. My husband ordered the bacon turkey club sandwich which was quite big. I ordered a clam chowder bowl. Very good clam chowder with plenty of clams in it. The service was very good the interior of the restaurant was fun. The place is probably a very hopping place later at night. We were there at lunch, so I would know. I liked the atmosphere and the beer. I would gladly return to this restaurant again."
A B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",153,378,62,3.0,9/10/2017,"The atmosphere is good, the food is really average. I felt like the server although friendly was rushing us. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which turns out to be a lot more lettuce than actual chicken. Prices are a little above average. Not really impressed!"
Rossy B.,"Paradise Valley Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,5.0,10/21/2017,"Great food, good portions, nice ambiance, AMAZING service from our waiter Deleon (not sure on spelling).  Ideal location with many shops/theatre/entertaining around to walk off your meal OR build up an appetite! Thanks BJs!"
Mr Photo Mtb F.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,94,33,4.0,11/2/2017,Today I'm having the barbecue rib special with garlic mashed and onion strings and churro pizookie like always great service
Jessica G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,38,,5.0,7/1/2017,"My husband and I had a date night here the other night. The food and ambience were pretty good. I loved the Brussel sprouts appetizer. The service started strong, but declined as the night continued. The server became increasingly irritable throughout the night. It could have been a bad night, understandable. When we go out we like to relax and take our time- a departure from regular life. So the kicker for us was that the server dropped the check before the dessert even arrived and continued to point out that the check was there. I get it- you want to turn your table, but this was inappropriate.  I would think that this isn't company policy to rush their guests out the door.  Assuming that this is just a fluke we will probably be back because the food was delicious.  Update: So hubby and I returned to indulge my preggo craving of potato skins. I read an article that featured BJs in the top 10 of potato skins in Phx, so I was sold. Soooooooo glad that we did. Those little nuggets of carbs and fat were delectable. My little boy was dancing in utero out of gratitude. Our server, Erin I think, was fantastic. She appeared swamped but handled it like a pro. There was a tiny issue with food (not her fault) but her approach was top notch customer service. So glad we came back to give it another try!"
David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,4.0,6/24/2017,"Still a solid 4...just a couple added thoughts: The flat bread pizza is only so-so. Not worth it at full price. Maybe worth it for the weekday special deal. The crust is like a Saltine cracker. The amount of meat protein toppings is seriously lacking. You're better off doing the ""make your own"" at one of the flash-fired pizza places. The pot stickers were surprisingly tasty. I guess I just didn't expect that from a brew pub with such a varied menu. The ribs are inconsistent from visit to visit. But the Ghirardeli triple chocolate pizzookie is really tasty. The cookie is not as good as the local pizza place one might think serves the ""pizzookie,"" but the ice cream is much better quality."
Taylor M.,"Phoenix, AZ",76,268,621,5.0,6/3/2017,"Service: Had the perfect waiter. He knew the menu. Never had repeat orders or special requests. Was quick, got orders right. Our group was big too. Food: Special on ribs. Had whole rack, two sides (got soup for one without upcharge and clam chowder was best in town, large clams, no sand grit, perfect consistency), salad (got wedge), and pizoutti desert all for $18.95 at lunch.  Ambiance: No complaints. Five stars, first ever visit."
Rachel D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,34,8,1.0,9/8/2017,"Tonight my friend and I ordered BJ's through door dash. Everything seemed to be in order until I realized my fries were not sweet potato as I requested but that was the least of my worries. Wait.... keep reading... I bit into my delicious looking turkey dip sandwich and was pleasantly surprised by the hearty turkey meat. Wait for it... I'm halfway through my sandwich when I realize my tongue feels a weird burning sensation. I look down at my food to find the culprit and as I turned the sandwich over I realized the bread was completely molded on the underside. Yes, you read that correctly. COMPLETELY MOLDED. I instantly felt a panic attack coming on. I called BJ's immediately and all I got was a 20 something year old manager that didn't seem too concerned. I was offered to have my order comped and that's it. There was no apology or any real sign of embarrassment for the fact that they serve moldy and potentially poisonous food to their customers. I am beyond horrified and angry. You couldn't pay me to eat food from this disgusting establishment again. I uploaded pictures and they can be seen towards the end of their photo gallery... enjoy!"
Bryce R.,"Guthrie, OK",0,16,,5.0,6/19/2017,"1st time ever being to a Bj's location, and was blown away. Our waiter Nick was absolutely on top of it the whole entire time we were there. To be honest it looked like all of the staff was working their butts off and getting things done. I just really have to say how awesome our waiter Nick was, super friendly and very informative!! The food was very flavorful, and not disappointing in any aspect. They have a portobello mushroom salad topped with goat cheese and cranberries that just exploded with flavor. The clam chowder in a bread bowl, don't even get me started. The bread bowl was toasted, I mean toasted golden brown awesomeness with clam chowder that definitely had plenty of clams in it. Not to mention their prime rib, was rubbed with the perfect amount of seasoning that was not too overwhelming. Plus you have to top it off with just a simple pizookie!  Great food, awesome staff, and just a great location!"
Susan K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,9,,1.0,12/1/2017,"My husband and I were just at BJ's it was awful. Our soup was cold, the salad had wilted lettuce, also chicken was cold We normally go there for dinner this is the first time we ever went there for lunch we will not be going back. I'm giving you one star because  our waiter was very nice."
Ryan F.,"Ontario, CA",28,60,9,5.0,2/4/2017,"Applebees on steroids ladies and gentlemen, Applebees on steroids. A few of my mates and I came here after going to a Korean BBQ place for dinner. We were famished. Not to say the BBQ was bad, we are just football players that didn't make it to the big league and got the appetite to prove it, but not the wallets.  There is more food on that menu than there are numbers in Pi. I wouldn't say there is a preferred item to get on the menu, just get what fits your fancy. Really isn't a speciality place. You're gonna eat good and I mean good on a budget. Everything is reasonably priced. We left there with our tummies full and some money left over to have a real doozy on the town. 5/5 would do it again. Just, if I were to go, there would be no preamble with Korean BBQ."
Cristian O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",27,46,27,5.0,3/27/2017,"It's been a while since we got such a great service.  Amber took care of us. Always with a smile,  never felt rushed and the order was spot on.  Food was great and the pizza was half off!?  What?!  Monday half off large pizza."
Kari L.,"Phoenix, AZ",75,62,57,3.0,2/3/2017,"I came in for happy hour for a drink and food. I was disappointed in the ""happy hour"" specials-only $1 off drafts and $2 off select appetizers. With appetizers averaging $9+ it wasn't much of a deal. Instead I ordered the ahi salad which was delicious however the ahi portion was also weak.  $15.50 for a salad and I expected a better ahi portion size.  Service was great in the bar area which was appreciated."
Linda S.,"Glendale, AZ",5,45,110,2.0,6/20/2017,"Honestly something has happened to this place since the last time I've been here. The waitress was definitely not visiting our table for offering us additional drinks... Considering you're paying 1495 a burger you think they would give you more than eight Fry's on your plate besides that you think that they wouldn't put meat on a vegetarian burger, although the manager quickly resolve the issue it was still a great disappointment when you have a group of 9 people there for birthday party and 9 out of 9 people were disappointed with their food will not be returning unfortunately..."
G C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,51,1,4.0,11/10/2017,The food here was pretty good. Great server we had. Nice atmosphere and quite busy. Great place if you're a veteran as they offer discounts on special military holidays too.  Recommend stopping in for a bite and a beer if you like them
Bob J.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,88,55,4.0,8/8/2017,This place is pretty good good size portions and we enjoy coming here. Unfortunately the service is not always on point. We will be back I just make sure we have a different server.
Kenya W.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,68,85,5.0,6/6/2016,"Delicious cider as well as the salads, the salad that I tried was the seared ahi salad, which exploded with flavor!! Sadly I didn't recognize the wasabi and shed some tears lol! Will definitely come back to try more of the great food that is served here!"
Brad P.,"Phoenix, AZ",27,7,,3.0,2/7/2017,"My wife and I come here from time to time - usually when we want to get a burger and beer.  Happy hour pricing is not a great deal, but they have a decent beer selection and serve excellent veggie burgers which my wife loves.   Their menu is overwhelming.  It reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory - where you sit down and they give you a novel to read.  So many items! This time I tried a new item - the Late Night Burger.  Here's the description: Open-faced burger | housemade pork chile verde | Applewood smoked bacon | jack + cheddar cheese | fresh fried egg  I really should have taken a picture.  When I think of an open-faced burger I don't think of both buns laid out with a patty covering the middle.  If that were the case, I'd hope that the buns were smothered in the pork chile verde.  Unfortunately there was a good 2"" on either side of the burger + toppings of plain bun, rendering the open-faced concept quite questionable.  I'd happily eat it with a closed bun because this presentation did nothing for it. I ordered it medium (pink) with a sunny side egg.  They weren't extremely busy at the time, however my burger was well done with a fried egg that was practically over-hard. Overall the dish was a disappointment, having so much unused bread and it not cooked properly. The service is always pretty great, I'll give that to our waitress.  I had a question about a beer and she proactively gave me a sample.  If their service dropped in quality I probably wouldn't come back."
Elizabeth D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,5.0,5/4/2017,"I eat here all the time, the Ahi salad is my personal favorite. They are not a perfect restaurant but I don't think that there is one out there that is perfect unless you want to pay several hundred a plate. That being said I would still say that BJ's is one of my Favorite places to eat.  Breakdown my Favorite's Apps - Flatbread Nacho's are awesome Crispy Calamari are also great, I love the bits with the tentacles  The boneless wings are good, the regular wings aren't the best but they aren't horrible the Avocado Egg Rolls are bomb, a little spicy but super good.  Small bites Salsa, Guac, Queso, and Salsa are all on point the stuff mushrooms are really good, the sauce is yumtastic Entrees Fire Roasted Barbacoa chicken is pretty good Spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles...bad-a** pad thai  Asian chopped salad i think is ok, my friend loves it cherry chipotle glazed salmon is super good  Mediterranean chicken tacos are really good the turkey burger is one of my favorite turkey burgers in the valley barbacoa cauliflower pita, sounds weird but is pretty good, kinda tastes like chicken lol Maple salmon tacos are so good, sweet and tangy  the Ahi Salad, is my utmost favorite, i order that all the time, its so good, tangy sweet spicy (with copious amounts of wasabi i add)  Shrimp and asparagus penne is not bad, i am not a big pasta fan in general but I killed it.  The super salad, not one to cheat on my ahi salad but this one holds its own. Sandwiches the hand pulled turkey dip is awesome, the horseradish sauce and the au jus make is yummy California chicken club is pretty decent mahi mahi taco's definitely one of the favs, super good. Desert who can go wrong with a gooey cookie still warm that it melts the icecream on top... people they literally invented the pizookie..."
Rebeca P.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,26,9,3.0,4/9/2017,Had the avocado roll..   discussing I couldn't finish it the avocado was so mushy and tasted old like over ripened avocado... pizza cookie was really good though but thats about it
Prescott P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,49,,4.0,7/30/2017,"Great place for a quality budget dinner.  Be sure to take advantage of the call ahead feature one hour before you plan to arrive.  We were promptly seated on arrival  Nearly every table taken at 6:30pm Saturday but not too noisy.  The short wall dividers between the bar and the booths for four and between the two rows of the booths for two really helped.   We had the Peruvian quinoa bowl with shrimp and the seared ahi salad, both really excellent.  Only $50 with two cocktails, tax, and tip.   Service was prompt at all stages and our waiter stopped by several times to check in."
Kal E.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,12,2,5.0,7/22/2017,I ordered the spaghetti. So delicious. Spicy. Loved the huge portions. My sister got the bison burger. Evrrtthing is so fresh and yummy.  Cheered me up for today. Would come back for sure.
Melanie A.,"Desert View Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/13/2017,"My significant other and I have been eating at BJs for the past 5 years, usually multiple times per week. We are disappointed after tonight's visit and unfortunately will never return. Things have gone downhill for the last year but have been really bad the last several months. We miss the excellent personable waitstaff and management that used to run this restaurant. Other reviewers have recently talked about the food coming out COLD and lacking in quality control. After waiting an hour, the first time our food came out, it was obvious it had been sitting there for awhile. The mushroom appetizer was cold, the lettuce wrap appetizer had cold chicken and the jambalaya was luke warm. We asked for the food to be remade from scratch because mushrooms taste horrible warmed up in a microwave. Then the food came out again 30 minutes later and the food was the same, not hot! The manager on duty argued with us saying he personally witnessed the cook making it and he kept saying it was hot although he refused to touch my mushroom when I asked him to in order to feel how cold it was. He then accused us of ""always"" complaining when we have been there literally over 200 times and he has only been managing for a month or so. And here is where I have an issue, he slipped and said, ""do you want me to warm these up AGAIN"" when he just had said he had the cook remake the dishes from scratch and witnessed it. He was overly condescending and not friendly at all. We miss the manager Gunner who was so personable and had excellent control over the restaurant! He made it feel like a tight knit family atmosphere and made an effort to come talk to us every time we came and knew us by name. And just for the record, we loved this place, the food, and the service for many years and tipped the staff upwards of 40% each time and never had problems with anyone, even the waitstaff knew us by name!"
Becca G.,"Glendale, AZ",245,49,64,2.0,9/25/2016,"What a great place for Sunday funday! Food was great, service was amazing! However was REALLY disappointed in the host staff, we had a little bit of a large party and they wouldn't accommodate us. We had to wait for our waiter to come around to ask if we could push some tables together so our group could be together. Even when I asked the host if we could  push some tables together he got a major attitude, and walked away without getting his manager like I asked. Not a fun start to our Sunday funday watching football.  Other than that mishap, I love BJ's and there great beer selection."
Lisa M.,"Far North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,1,,5.0,6/27/2017,"Amanda R is THE most amazing waitress I have ever had.  Super attentive, timing perfect. I had a million different diet restrictions and she listened and handled it with ease.   BJ's is very lucky to have her as an employee. Food was fabulous too."
Smuppy S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,25,,4.0,5/22/2017,"We come here from time to time.  Went in on Friday night to eat with the family and Christopher was our server. He was great!  Came back last night and sat at the bar, Collin is usually working. He is great too! I just wish their gluten free selections were more abundant."
Kaleigh D.,"Phoenix, AZ",404,2,,5.0,7/4/2017,"Amazing food and specials! The manager John is awesome, he immediately noticed an issue with my dish right as when the server dropped my entree off and he went out of his way to bring me a new piece of fish without even asking. Highly recommend this place! It was by far a fantastic experience."
Doug T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",724,324,1083,3.0,12/28/2014,"I've been to different BJ's and really haven't been too impressed with the food but never really tried the Desert Ridge location.  Nice ambience and very modern looking with lots of TVs. The place was packed and seemed like everyone was having a good time. Pretty loud and I would say normal for a brewery restaurant.  I had the deep dish BJ Favortite pizza. Let see it had pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, green peppers, mushrooms, & tomatoes. The pizza was good. Nice crust. Soft and chewy but again nothing compares to a Chicago deep dish. So it was pretty good. Not great.  My wife had the mediterranean chicken pita tacos. She thought they were okay. The chicken was a little dry. My son had the baby back ribs with clam chowder and Caesar salad. He thought it was okay but he did eat it all.  Can you say starving. Of course, we had to get a Pizookie. It's a must. We ordered the salted Carmel Pizookie. It came with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The cookie was warm not really hot but was good. Really liked the dessert.  Our server was pretty good. He greeted us pretty quickly and took our order. Only problem is that we had to ask for water refills but once we ask he was pretty good in refilling. He did apologized to us because he was so busy. Understandable. He was good in clearing out dishes and did check up on us every once in awhile.  So I thought the food was okay, service was okay and atmosphere was good. I'm sitting here scratching my head in how BJ's is always so busy. Packed house and waiting line. It was okay at best and we'll see if we come back."
