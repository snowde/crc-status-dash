Todd H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",22,287,386,3.0,1/22/2012,"To explain my rating, please remember that 3 stars means A-OK, it is not a bad rating, but it doesn't mean excellent either. A group of 9 of us stopped there just after 8 PM on a Saturday night.  One would think being able to get in to a restaurant at Desert Ridge on a Saturday night would not be easy but they seated us immediately.  The place was full but not packed.  It was a pleasure to go to a place that is not so noisy that you can't have a conversation with the others in your group.  I think part of that is that BJ's was designed with good acoustics.  We were surrounded by other diners but the noise level was well tolerable. Our waitress was generally pleasant, but we agreed she looked bored, or even upset. She messed up numerous times throughout the meal in taking orders and bringing the right items.  Again, the place wasn't that busy that she was overloaded. As far as the food is concerned, I give BJ's high marks.  I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants (although BJ's isn't as huge a chain as Olive Garden for example).  The menu is creative and varied and surprisingly inexpensive.  Most of us started with a beer, and we all liked the featured selection. Although BJ's originally started as primarily a pizza place, they now offer a lot of different types of foods, many of which are not usually found in restaurants of this type.  None of us had Italian food however.  My choice was Cajun Talapia, two large filets cooked as perfectly as you can imagine, over a bed of rice and seved with a spring salad.  The entre was served with a half lemon that was blackened at one end, perfect to squeeze on the fish and salad, resulting in a low calorie meal.  Although the entre was under $10 the quantity of food was quite filling. Others in our party had burgers, jambalaya, thai shrimp lettuce wraps and a nice Ahi Poke, all of which looked delicious.  Everyone in our group agreed the food was great and the prices were reasonable.  Our only negative was that the waitress wasn't that great. BJ's is a cut above the typical chain restaurant but not at a higher price.  Just an informal place to enjoy a decent meal with family or friends."
Alex N.,"Roseville, MI",0,3,,5.0,7/12/2014,"Awesome beer, food and service. Our server, Corey, was excellent. Had the deep dish pizza last time, went with the pulled pork this time. Both were amazing! My fiance is a vegetarian and was extremely happy with her salad. She was also thrilled that there is actually a selection of items she can eat. We are new to the area but will definitely be back!"
paula m.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,28,,2.0,7/10/2015,"Ate there last Friday (we have been there several times before - last time they forgot the chicken in my boyfriend's chicken salad). It was busy but not crazy. It took awhile for our server to greet us and after she brought drinks it took her awhile to come back to get our order. We ordered an appetizer and two dinners, which all came out at the same time. Also, I ordered a second drink which she finally brought as she brought a box for my leftovers. Food was good, but service was definitely off this time."
Cherry L.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,176,348,3.0,3/2/2014,"Ok, maybe only their pizza is good. Had their bruschetta small bites and gourmet Mac and cheese. Bruschetta bread was way too thick and nothing great. Mac and cheese - although ""gourmet"", I thought my nieces' Kraft Mac and cheese with their kids meal was better. My other friend agreed too. Ironic how the one thing that we adults liked the best was from the kids menu AND something we can make at home from the box itself!  Guess what I went to buy at the grocery store later that day?"
Brian H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",7,31,1,4.0,8/16/2014,"First time visiting a BJs restaurant and came away liking it. It was a bit small for a brewery inside, but had a great bar and TVs. Lots of beer and alcohol choices. Had a very good California burger. Pretty much a nicer version of red robin or chilies. Spent about $25 a person for food and a beer. Would go back"
Jennifer P.,"Phoenix, AZ",218,29,18,4.0,2/18/2014,"Always love coming here!  The staff has been great, and the food is pretty good. We don't normally have to wait long to be seated, and we enjoy the environment.  The fish and chips were definitely worth the Weight Watchers points and heartburn.  Yes... it was worth it.  I don't normally eat like that but I don't eat out a lot, so when I do, I endulge!"
James S.,"Campbell, CA",0,11,,1.0,11/14/2013,"Had a okay experience the first time. The food was about a 6 out of 10. The second time it was awful we asked to be seated in a both and the guy just wouldn't do it. He was very rude, guess he didn't want our business."
Scott D.,"Glendale, AZ",800,557,266,3.0,5/23/2011,"I went to BJ's Restaurant for the first time this weekend. And we had mixed results. The service by Brandon was excellent, but please tone it down on the upselling. He made a great suggestion regarding getting double meatballs in the Calzone as one of the two additional toppings that comes with the dish. The nachos were good, but could have used some Guac and Jalapenos to bring it up to excellent. The meatball Calzones were excellent (better than Uncle Sam's I'm told, sorry Sammy).  I know Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, and you Sir, are not Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Not even close, that's why the Yelp rating for this restuarant takes a header. This is what a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza looks like.......http://www.giordanos.com/. Their pizza was just a lot of crust with a thin layer of cheese and toppings. The Wendy's ""Where's the Beef"" lady would have been yelling ""Where's the Cheese"" if she had a ""Chicago Deep Dish Pizza"" at BJ's. Having said all that, my family and I really enjoyed the atmoshere and the great selection of entrees and will be back to try the other entrees, but just not the Pizza."
Eli G.,"Holly Springs, NC",687,345,221,1.0,11/14/2011,"Let me start by saying that usually I am a big fan of BJ's, but this time was a total disappointment! Started with the waitress taking our order orally instead of writing anything down. First my wife and I ordered chicken ceaser for an appetizer and pizza / burger for entree. All of the food arrived at once which was the first mistake. Secondly the pizza had the wrong toppings - write down the order! The burger and fries were only warm to begin with and after eating the salad it was cold.  Also, I didn't want to eat before my wife had her pizza. To re-fire the pizza took over 30 minutes! After all said and done I went to the manager (I Never do this) He comp'ed the whole meal - at least that! I don't think that we will come to this location again, but I will visit other BJ's near us."
Regina F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,20,,5.0,3/14/2016,"I frequent this place for lunch often, they have good lunch specials and their food is really good. I highly recommend asking your waiter what they recommend if you cannot decide, they always help point you towards what's good. I went there with three co-workers, we had a very good experience. Most of us decided to try something we had not tried before. I myself tried their turkey burger and my friend tried the chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. Needless to say the turkey burger was cooked to perfection, it was nice and juicy and honestly for a turkey burger it was great. My friend loved her chicken and spinach quinoa dish. My other friends also enjoyed their meals (which I believe were boneless wings and a hot ham and cheese grill sandwich). Our server Brandon I was absolutely fantastic and was really attentive. One of my pet peeves is not have my water refilled and he did an amazing job at keeping our drinks full and made sure to check on us. Will definitely continue to come here for lunch."
Peter W.,"Mesa, AZ",27,78,,4.0,8/5/2013,"We went to Bj's this past weekend we enjoyed our experience. First off I ordered a cream soda and I am now convinced that Bj's has the best cream soda out there, you gotta try it when you go. Our group shared a pizza it was very good, i would defiantly order it again. Our service was good, nothing to brag about but nothing to complain about either. We will defiantly be back!"
Alex K.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,10,3,4.0,6/10/2014,I came here with my family and what amazing service! I loved the flatbread pizzas you can't get any better! My wife and me shared a French dip and I've never had better. The horseradish sauce was really mild but that's why it was so good! I would deff recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal! It's good for family or friends
Mark H.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,20,3,5.0,3/5/2011,"Hadn't been to BJ's for a few years and I had forgotten how great the food is there.  Went on a busy Friday night, but only had to wait about 20 minutes or so to be seated. Started with classic potato skins.  Perfect.  Cheddar, bacon, and cheese with sour cream and/or ranch dressing.   Bring friends, this is not a single serving plate. For the entree I chose the Tuscan Chicken Lemone.  It's new on the menu and I hope they keep it for a some time.  Wonderful flavor - lemon and butter, good stuff.  Pasta was tasty too.  And the cheese bread?  Don't get me started.  Normally at BJ's I would have a beer, but I felt like something different so I ordered a nonalcoholic berry cider.  Only lightly sweet and very snappy, it was quite refreshing and a nice change from overly ambitious drinks that crowd out the flavors of a good meal. Too full for desert so nothing to report.  The service was very good - prompt, accurate, and engaging.   The only issue we had was with the fold out extension for our table.  Every time my friend (G.) hit the top of the table too hard (he's a big guy, but still) the magnetic latch would give way and the extension would swing down and whack one of us in the leg.  After a while I just moved my leg out of harms way and was mildly entertained every time G. would get stung in the thigh.  Probably an anomaly, but a stronger magnet might be a good idea."
Ed D.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",1244,394,455,4.0,11/7/2012,"The wife & I had our 28th anniversary here last year, and loved it! Nice menu selections, everything we tried was yummy! Going back for our 29th this month!"
Ryan C.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,1,,5.0,2/10/2014,Great service! Great food! I love dining here! I think their caesar salad is one of the best I've ever had in town. Their craft brews are on the hoppy side so if you are not into serious great tasting beer I'd suggest you stick to the mass-produced watered down beer for your drinking pleasure. Oh and there are plenty of televisions for sporting events.
Wendy H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,30,,3.0,5/1/2013,We have been here a few times and the food and service are usually very good.  Can get crowded on weekends but worth waiting a bit to get a table.  The noise level is not too loud like some other places.  Didn't care for their specialty drinks but the beers are good and they have a nice selection.
Scott S.,"Phoenix, AZ",639,11,,5.0,3/11/2011,"There is no losing here.  The food is so good!!  I usually shy away from bar pizza, but this was some of the best pizza I have had.  Awesome chicken wings.  And they have a large selection of great beer.  There is nothing like a beer with real flavor.  I usually do not like a really dark brew, but they have the best.   Great service, just a great place."
John C.,"Phoenix, AZ",163,40,35,4.0,10/23/2012,"BJ's always has good food but the service is usually sub-par. This place would get 5 stars if they could just improve in that area. I like their salads, burgers, pizzas and they also have some pretty good lemonades."
Jennifer A.,"Oak Forest, IL",2,2,,5.0,12/28/2013,"Their food is delicious, and they have a pretty decent happy hour special too - with food and drinks.  We have tried a lot of what's on their menu, and the only thing that I think didn't have much to offer was the tilapia dinner. The Buffalo Chicken pizza there is one of the best I've ever had, highly recommend ordering it."
Debi C.,"Gilbert, AZ",18,45,3,5.0,2/11/2013,"We went for dinner last night , Sarah, our waitress was amazing. We are at one of the BJ's restaurants weekly and we found Sarah to be the best waitress in our 4 year experience. Friendly, always keeping the drinks flowing, asked if we wanted our tea''s to go, understood their rewards program.  And as always the food was great. Always a great place you can count on for great food and always consistent."
