Kevin K.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,44,,4.0,5/6/2016,I am starting to really like this place. Today the service was great and he kept our drinks never empty. He was great on suggestions and the food was good to.. So now you might ask why I didn't give it a 5.. I didn't give it a 5 star because the food was VERY SLOW in coming out.. The salads were slow at about 12 minutes to come out after order and the lunch. Was 55 minutes for a pizza and flatbread. I think that is a bit much but other then that it was a great experience
Jocelle L.,"Dublin, OH",0,22,,5.0,10/1/2016,"Great service, great food, and we are here every week!  We love the chicken wings with the drizzle on the side.  The grilled Atlantic salmon us really good and you can't go wrong with any of their salads."
Melissa A.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,113,48,4.0,2/17/2016,This place reminds me a lot of like Granite City and Gordon Biersch type places.   They Brew their own beer and have a good variety.  I really enjoy the Hefeweizen.   They have quite a few taps with other beers and will let you sample before you commit.  The menu is very big and also has a wide variety.  It's a good place to pick if you have a group of people with different tastes.  They even have healthier menu options too.  The service has always been good when I've gone as well.  I've had the Mahi and shrimp bowl as well as the Mahi tacos.  Both were good with nicely cooked and flaky Mahi.
Matthew M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,5.0,5/12/2016,My wife and I love coming here. Even when they're busy the servers do quite well. And the wings and pizza are great!  Make sure you download the BJ's app. You can get on the wait list before you get there and you get points with every purchase.
Steve S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,4.0,4/4/2016,Significant improvement in the service upon our most recent visit. Glad we gave BJ's another try. Hope this continues.
Reese C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",202,531,116,3.0,8/25/2013,"So I don't really frequent Desert Ridge or malls in general.  Desert Ridge is particularly crowded and annoying, but I was meeting a friend in the area so I found myself there.   This is one of those places with a 10 page menu. Annoying to say the least.  After I read through their dissertation.. I mean menu.... I opted for the Thai Mango Chicken Salad.  I was pleasantly surprised and loved it.  Massive salad that I almost couldn't finish.  I mean it had an avocado, chicken, mangos .. what's not to love?  A waiter went past us with a pizza that looked divine.  This is a family friendly, sports watching, casual place to eat. Would I go there for dinner? No. Would I purposely seek this place out?  No. But did I have a good lunch? yes."
Cole R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,3.0,4/12/2016,"I love Bjs but both the waiters were snobby and not too friendly. When I asked for A small pizza she gave me a mini with four pieces that sounded alright and I thought these were big pieces but still I was not that hungry. Finally when we got our food My pizza looked like it came from the Pizza Hut inside of the target across the street. And it took them a good 20 minutes to get me my lemonade I've had better experiences with place. And you can never go wrong with their ""pozookies""."
Steve G.,"Union, NJ",540,808,,2.0,8/14/2014,"Although previously unknown to me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a part of a large, multistate chain.  Their standards of food and service easily identify this realization, in spite of the fact that it is stated on their menu. Not to be misunderstood, the turkey club sandwich that I ordered wasn't bad, and the requisite flavors were all there.  Sloppy assembly and plating, however, illustrated the plight of a kitchen slammed at lunchtime and simply trying to move to the next order.  To say that there was no ""love"" put into this sandwich would be an understatement. Our server (I believe that his name was Johnny) was apologetic- even funny- about how backed-up the kitchen was.  Yes, service was slower-than-slow, but a personable and attentive server made the extended wait somewhat bearable. Their desserts looked great, and I'm not a dessert eater.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't have had the rest of the afternoon to wait for them. So yet another restaurant chain is added to the list of those that I will try to avoid in my frequent business travel."
Subodh N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,13,40,3.0,4/25/2015,"For a sports bar its very sober, which i liked the most about it. A good place to hang out with friends, have a few drinks and spend some good time. The food is average but the drinks are different."
Sheri H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,1,2.0,3/24/2016,"I ordered the ribeye, which was over cooked, and my companion ordered a half a rack of ribs, which were burnt. We told the server they were burned so bad you can clearly see it. She doesn't even stop walking says oh you don't like them, let me put another order,  and never came back. Very disappointed.  I will not come back to this place again."
Mary R.,"Albany, NY",0,9,1,5.0,10/25/2015,"I have to give this 5 stars because there was nothing lacking here this  evening when we chose a casual dinner near our Marriott Canyon villa. The atmosphere was fun with sports screens but not too loud that we had to scream across the table. The food was reasonable priced and good size portions and delicious. Our female server gave us a good description of items to help us decide and it came promptly. I had a refreshing arugula & watermelon salad topped with feta. I tried the jambalaya which was delicious on the spicy side. But, the pumpkin cookie a la mode took care of the residual heat aftertaste. Glad we checked this one out and would definitely return."
Allen P.,"San Diego, CA",502,24,2,2.0,1/12/2015,"Went in an hour before closing for dinner. Food was amazing, but you had to practically call the waiter from across the restaurant.  There were only 4 other people here, and the staff was either cleaning up, or, like the manager, shooting the bull with the bartender. It was nearly impossible to order anything, and when I requested to order dessert, the waiter seemed annoyed that I was requesting more of him.  Worst BJ's I've ever been to due to the service."
Lindy F.,"Cave Creek, AZ",17,19,21,3.0,2/22/2015,"I give this restaurant a medium rating because the service can be very ""spotty."" In a way it's a victim of success because staff frequently gets slammed. The food is good. It's not a very good sports bar because the TV selection is rigid and you can find yourself watching golf and NASCAR while college basketball teams are fighting to get off the ""bubble."" You can guess what I'm watching now!"
Penny S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,25,1,5.0,10/9/2015,"BJ's has good food and a nice environment.  Been here many times.  But I write now because of their incredible server CHAD.  This guy deserves high praise.  Yes, he was efficient and courteous and patient with us waiting for a 3rd person, but he actually stopped my friend when she said the rest was his tip. He said ""I think you need to check your change"" So she took it back and realized it was about $80.  She misread the bill while chatting away, and this amazing, wonderful, HONEST gentleman realized that. We are so grateful he pointed that out. This employee is very RARE and should be very VALUED. Thank you CHAD and thank you BJ's for hiring such an ethical person."
John M.,"Peoria, AZ",4,215,161,5.0,10/21/2014,"i have only been to Bj's one other time but had no food, and I was very impressed with our dinner tonight. I had the chicken santa fe salad and it had a wonderful flavor and the quantity of salad was ample (the chicken was cut to make it looks like a lot, but in fact was not enough for every bite) our server was friendly and prompt.  The last time I was at Bj's we meet friends for drinks,and because of the design of the restaurant (open concept) it got very loud, but tonight was not bad I gave 5 stars tonight cause the food/service/price had a good balance for this type of resturant."
Jim C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,1,1.0,10/2/2015,Having some under-cooked chicken at BJs....sitting next to another guest with a complaint as well...manager putting out fires tonight...at least the beer is cold....avoid this place if you can...hopefully I don't get salmonella
CJ J.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,57,3,1.0,11/30/2014,"My first experience at BJ's could best be summed up as ""crap-tastic."" Here's how I arrived at that conclusion: -Bad Service: My server looked like hated his life; he never cracked a smile once, nor did he ever check on or refill our our drinks, which were empty halfway through the meal. -Dirty Glassware: At first glance, my water glass looked like it had some sort of flashy green garnish, like a mint julep might have. But this isn't the Kentucky Derby; this is BJ's. That green leafy thing sticking to the outside rim of my glass was a big ass piece of lettuce from someone else's meal, steam-stuck to the outside of my beverage. The offending lettuce was so big, so Mt. Rushmore-esque in size that I really don't know how even the busiest server could have missed it. Yuck. -Bad Timing: The appetizers took 20 minutes to arrive; entrees came out roughly 2 minutes later. -Improper temperatures: The nachos and the fried artichokes came out together; the nachos were stone cold, but the artichokes were nuclear hot. My chicken wings were crispy and delicious, but my boyfriend's wedge fries were cold next to a lukewarm hamburger.  Less than 2 hours after eating at BJ's, dinner revisited both of us with a vengeance. . . in the bathroom. I wish I was joking about that."
Lindsay L.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,28,17,4.0,7/27/2014,"Nice variety of food and they stay open late. I'm from Atlanta, GA where sit down restaurant stay open late. Here in Phoenix things tend to close early, unless it's a bar. My family and friends can always count on BJ's for a late night meal.  We stated coming here about four years ago when we bought our house. We met one of the servers, Jamie Harris. She's the bees knees. We always request her section if she's working. She's professional and very witty.  They make their own root beer. Yum-mee! I'm not a soda drinker and was never a root beer fan until now. It's a must have at BJ's."
Jason W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",227,173,298,5.0,10/7/2014,"I had a pulled pork sandwich with potatoes wedges and wow I was surprised I was eating in a bar. Very tasty sandwich which I cut in half and enjoyed the next day. It was a bit busy so we sat at the bar, great service."
Steve L.,"San Antonio, TX",26,170,77,5.0,11/14/2014,"The ribeye was cooked to perfection and was mouth watering delicious.  I would place this steak at the top of the food pyramid. We sat at the bar due to crowding, and enjoyed every moment of our time here. Great food, great service, great folks.  If I had ten thumbs, I would give it a ""ten thumbs up""! Highly recommend the Sante Fe Spring Rolls as an appetizer.  They were simply, ""Oh, my!"". Can't say enough so I'll shut up, a terrific meal and a good time abounded!"
