Krysta C.,"Tempe, AZ",30,30,,1.0,7/5/2015,"Pretty disappointed in our visit today. We were seated promptly and no wait, which is nice on a Sunday during lunch. During this visit, service was slow, had to remind server to bring our drinks. No refills were given on water or root beer....we were pretty much ignored by our server after our order was put in. Pizza had little to no sauce on it and crust was undercooked. We probably won't be back soon. I was pretty bummed because usually BJ's is reliably good."
Bryan K.,"Phoenix, AZ",182,9,,5.0,3/31/2016,"It's easy to understand where they get their name from. Truly the only thing better than BJ's Oreo Pazooki is going all the way. At first you start to question if it's as good as your neighbor Steve said it is. Luckily for you, your server just walked by to suggest taking a bite into the heavenly swirled Oreo mousse. Now that your world is completely upside down you find yourself contemplating other areas of your life that could use an Oreo Pazooki upgrade. Forgot that special anniversary? Oreo Pazooki. Your kids hamster just died? Oreo Pazooki. Uncle Dan is getting married for the third time? Oreo Pazooki. Have a pulse? Oreo Pazooki. Just remember kids, when life hands you grocery stores, you buy milk and reassure yourself that BJ's will be serving tins of greatness for you to eat your problems away. Except for student loans.. You'll be paying those off until you die and no Pazooki will save you from that."
Julie K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,16,2,5.0,7/14/2016,"Everything is great here! including the service, curb side and take out. My family either eats in or gets curb side a few times a month here at BJ's. Our favorites are the burgers, ribs, roast beef dip and chicken tortilla soup. Total Yum!"
Joe B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,759,7,3.0,6/14/2014,"Stopped in to watch the NBA playoffs and grab a bite. The restaurant has an older crowd...  I ordered some mojitos but they tasted just like a citrus drink with no alcohol..  The Tanaka Stout was good. Our waiter was staying on top of things... The food came out hot.  BJ's is affordable, quick.. It did bother me that the cocktails were not good at all."
Michael O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",49,20,,4.0,6/8/2015,Great beer and great dining experience. I ordered from their healthy menu items and my dish came out super salty but my wife's was good and so was the kids meal I got for my son. The Jeremiah Red is a great beer that they brew and I would definitely suggest you try it.
Manny S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",98,69,1,3.0,4/15/2014,"From BJ's website, ""Our menu features BJ's own delicious, innovative spin on your favorite foods, including deep dish pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, baby back ribs and so much more.""  That's all true. Well, the delicious and innovative claims are debatable but they do have an extensive menu. Possibly too extensive. The food is OK and much like that food you'll find at Yard House, Gordon Biersch, TGI Fridays, etc. Yes, they have their own ""spin"" but it's really not that much different. Service has always been friendly. The food shows up quickly and I've never had to wait for a refill.  They really push their BJ's beer but they have a number of other beers on tap (ask for a Bud Light - go on, I dare you!). Not a bad spot to grab lunch or dinner. Just don't expect to be blown away."
Albert H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",117,1222,281,1.0,4/8/2014,"Horrible policy here.  I used the call ahead feature on a busy night and was told that the wait is 25 minutes, and my name was now on the list.  Sounds good, right?  I arrive 25 minutes later to check in and I'm told that I should expect to get a table in about 25-30 minutes.  What?!? This is insane and unlike most other places that have the call ahead feature.  Minor mention:  the happy hour changed in the last year or so and several items are no longer discounted at all (like Mozz sticks), and the items that are discounted are presented on a separate menu that categorizes them by price (these apps for $7, these for $9, etc.)  This is a growing trend as places no longer want to clearly indicate half off, or a specified amount off, and want to try and redirect your attention away from how much you're actually saving by going to happy hour."
Michele K.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,107,36,3.0,9/12/2014,Went here because that's where a date wanted to go.....I must say our server Haley was outstanding.  She redeemed BJ's.  The food was actually good and I loved the corn fritters with bacon aioli.   Thank you Haley!
Mary B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,11,,5.0,10/20/2015,"This is one of my favorite places to go. Food is really good. I love their seasonal stuff. I've always received exceptional service, even a few times when I've had my young baby with me. I've found a lot of places treat me poorly when I have my child with me, but never here! Will continue to be a regular customer."
Birdie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,21,6,4.0,9/19/2015,They have great food.  Everyone at the table loved their diah. The waiter was pleasant and always on top of giving us more water. The atmosphere was great not too loud and beautiful surroundings. We will definitely be returning.
Cindy T.,"Chandler, AZ",252,160,55,4.0,7/13/2014,I haven't been to a BJ's in a while so much has changed...for the better.  The menu is very large now and offers some really nice lunch options.  The lunch portions are very large and well priced.  I was pleasantly surprised as I have never been a real BJ's fan in the past but I would definitely come back.  The restaurant was cuter than I remember.  I had the the shrimp scampi and tomato and mozzarella salad lunch combo.  Both were very good.  The tropical ice tea is delicious as well.  Our server could have been friendlier and more attentive but it wasn't a problem.  Can't wait to come back and give it another try.
david d.,"Arlington Heights, IL",1,12,,4.0,1/10/2016,"Came here on a Friday night with my wife after our flight into town. Overall this was a good choice for a late night dinner. Service: The server was very nice and informative. We asked for more than just restaurant stuff (things to do, places to go...etc). Waiter was thoughtful enough to think about the question and come back with a response vs. rambling off whatever popped into mind.  Food: Queso verde was good. Had a nice bite to it. The server (with disclaimer that he has never been to Chicago) suggested the Californian-Chicago style pizza. We were hungry so it filled a void, but I would never call it Chicago style. It had a puffy crust (comparably to Pizza Hut) which was cooked well. The sausage looked and tasted more like dominoes pizza. Roasted red peppers were tasty, but not able to redeem. Overall not a fan.  Beer was good. Ended up with the crazy brewnette. Good brown."
Jackson F.,"Cave Creek, AZ",66,80,6,3.0,10/5/2015,"Solid American restaurant.  Nicer than an Ruby Tuesdays/Fridays type place but did not have the service or selection that a Yard House did.  If I had to choose between the two, I'm going Yard House, however I would not be disappointed to end up back at BJ's again.  Everyone got their food in a timely manner, though it was not busy during lunch.  I hear it gets very busy during dinner."
Melissa S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",6,47,13,4.0,8/5/2015,"I met a friend here last night for happy hour.  It was a pleasant surprise to find out that bottles of wine(and glasses) were half price!  I believe that's just in the bar area though.  I live near BJ's and we frequent it often.  It's been hit and miss in the past.  Last night, we had a very sweet and attentive server.  I had the chopped salad and a baked potato and my friend had the gluten-free pizza.  We both enjoyed our food and our wine.  I am hoping that BJ's has made some extra effort to step it up with their customer service and quality of food as it seemed improved last night.  The food is a little pricey for a brewery, but all-in-all, last night was an extremely pleasant experience so I will be back again."
Mike M.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,34,27,5.0,7/15/2015,"I always forget about this place, but it's always good. We started with the carnitas fries... One of the best appetizers for my money. I had the New Orleans jambalaya, it's good but it gets a little over whelmed with the spices so it's a little hard to taste the shrimp and chicken, my girlfriend had the flat bread pizza which I had a ""taste"" of for the review. Solid choice for dinner, you really can't go wrong with all the choices. Best part of the night was that I left my wallet on the table and the server ran it out to me with all my cash intact. Definitely going back. Thanks"
Theresa S.,"Phoenix, AZ",50,3,,4.0,12/17/2015,"Everything was great! Happy hour was packed, but Gloria was friendly and made great beer recommendations."
Lori W.,"Phoenix, AZ",45,2,1,2.0,10/20/2014,"I have been to this BJ's a few times, and unfortunately, my experience has gotten worse each visit.  This last time was actually for my birthday.  We waited 20 minutes after being seated for our order to be taken, waited another 30 minutes with our food (had to request fruit and crackers for the little kids because they needed to eat SOMETHING while waiting for their meals), and when the food came, our salads came WITH our meal (with the exception of the 2 salads that were completely omitted), and a steak and a burger were prepared incorrectly. The manager was nice in trying to rectify the situation by removing things from our bill and comping dessert, but the experience overall was a disappointment."
Gina S.,"Phoenix, AZ",44,38,4,5.0,6/15/2015,"I forgot how much I loved bjs. It's been a very long time since I've even been to one and the menu has changed alot!. The service was great and the food and drinks were amazing. Just discovered their happy hour, I know where have I been right? I'll Definitely be back."
Aurelia K.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",8,30,7,5.0,7/10/2015,Our meals were excellent. I had the cherry chipotle salmon and my friend had the rib eye steak. Service was great and attentive. Also had the calamari for an appetizers. Very delicious. I totally recommend this place. Great food Great service.
Skip H.,"Avondale, AZ",3,32,8,4.0,7/9/2015,"Dinner with a group of 10 on Tuesday night.  Placed was packed but service was still good.  Great variety of draft beer, very good appetizers and Lemon Chicken was very good.  Definitely going to be a regular dinner spot."
