The O.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,11/8/2015,"So, first visit to BJs in Desert Ridge..AND MY LAST!!! I arrived with family to include my in laws. Well after waiting for a bit the waiter took our order. Thats where the ""ok"" part of this place stopped and why it should be out of business begins: Bathroom: too dirty for dogs Wait staff: 0 personality My order arrived way after the rest & when it did it was NOT anything like what was on the menu. The person who delivered it gave me some lame excuse as to why it didnt and attempted to appease me with "" we'll make you another one"". Really??? You had 35 minutes to deliver something that looked like a heat and serve microwave dinner!? DO NOT BOTHER COMING HERE!!!!"
Jo N.,"Cave Creek, AZ",3,65,7,4.0,6/28/2015,"Went in for lunch mid June, BJ's is always a favorite. I love their version of a caprese salad and the chicken tortilla soup is my favorite. We had the best server (Alicia) on this visit, she was friendly and funny and made our stay very enjoyable."
Tiffany C.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,20,3,4.0,8/29/2015,"Came here last night after a dbacks game and for a Friday night it was surprisingly empty. Got right in and served fast. My date and I had the lettuce wraps for an appetizer which were delicious! We then shared the Spicy Pig thin crust pizza which was delicious as well. I didn't pay but my only complaint is that the thin crust pizza (more like a flatbread) is one size only and it's like $14.50. I could easily have eaten the entire thing myself, just seems a little steep but again it was very tasty. I moved close to desert ridge so I'm sure I'll be back to try some other items."
J B.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,17,,5.0,8/27/2015,"Stopped by on Saturday for my Daughter's birthday dessert choice.  We LOVE the Pizookies and accompanied with a Stout, doesn't get much better.  Service at the bar tables was spot on and as usual. the restaurant was very clean and inviting.  Have been here numerous times and especially enjoy their flat breads."
Erin D.,"Phoenix, AZ",72,68,18,4.0,8/22/2015,"This was my first time at BJ's and I was pleasantly surprised. We started with the calamari which was cooked to perfection and had some delicious dipping sauces.  I had the Tavern-Cut Garlic Chicken Pest pizza and my wife had the Double Deluxe burger.  The pizza was a good blend of all ingredients.  My wife's burger was still juicy and delicious even when she ordered it well done. Even the beer was above par. I had the house lager which had some great robust flavors. The kind of beer I would expect to enjoy at an upscale bar. And last, but not least, our server Alicia (sp?) was fabulous.  Very accommodating, friendly and on top of everything. Although it was on the higher end of my price range, I would definitely eat here again."
Maria L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",294,297,45,4.0,4/21/2014,Came here for a late dinner.  Juicy Moroccan Salmon with some fun nuts to join it. The stuffed mushroom appetizers also really delighted our mouths.  Such a friendly waiter.  Would definitely come back next time to try the beer.
Joey A.,"Glendale, AZ",12,4,,3.0,8/15/2015,"My wife and I went to this restaurant on a Friday evening.  I was disappointed that the ""Happy Hour"" was just in the bar, we seat in the main dinning room.  I would have ordered a drink, it just rubbed me wrong that they advertise Happy Hour, thinking it's for the entire restaurant.  We ordered a salad and a main entry.  We waited and waited, then the entire came.  Halfway into our meal, the salads arrived.  We turned them back.  The manager came to us and apologized and offered us a free desert.  The food was very good, the desert was nice."
Kelly H.,"Surprise, AZ",0,37,9,5.0,8/2/2015,"Ate here for the 1st time on Thursday...amazing experience! Wish I could remember the young man's name that seated us...very professional and genuinely friendly. Our waitress, Laryn, was very knowledgeable and kind. She took excellent care of us ! The food was deeeeelicious and great portion sizes! Everything was sparkly clean and inviting.  We'll be back for sure :)"
James P.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,5.0,9/23/2015,"My fiancée and I love coming to this place. The food is piquant, the service is wonderful, and we always have a good time. I would suggest this place to anyone."
Allie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,32,1,3.0,5/25/2014,"3 & a half stars. First time at BJs & I'll probably go again.  We got the corn fritters with bacon aioli & mini bruschetta for appetizers. The corn fritters were Delicious & the bruschetta was yummy too.  My husband ordered the bison burger & I had the parmesan crusted chicken. Only one of my pieces of chicken had the sauce on it & overall it was pretty good but nothing I'd order again (kinda wishing I had gone with a pizza). Only had a bite of my husbands burger & from what I can remember it was good & he liked it.  Lastly, we ordered the cookies & cream pizookie & that was just delicious!!"
Tyler B.,"Glendale, AZ",222,325,15,4.0,4/8/2015,Conveniently located and never had any problems with service or quality of food. good in my book and it's somewhere my girlfriend and I go regularly.
Clint B.,"Phoenix, AZ",47,242,107,2.0,3/14/2015,"Well, I am pretty annoyed, and I will spell it out so you can decide.  Location=Great!  Service=Great Tried the Tatonka Imperial Stout and was very impressed. My wife and I also ordered 2 Shots of FireBall!   Ordered the Calamari and Ahi Tuna Poke appetizer. The Calamari was breaded perfectly, but was a bit chewy. The Ahi Tuna Poke was just ok. The Tuna's texture was a bit off. I also ordered a Black and Bleu Burger. Cooked a perfect Medium Rare and had some good flavor. Fries were nice and crispy.  The Food Prices were on par. $10 Appetizers and a $9 burger.  All in all, everything was very solid until................... We got our check!!! $8.25 for 1 shot of FireBall!!! OMG!!!! Are you out of your mind??? By far the most expensive shot of Fireball I have ever had in my life! Seriously? FireBall is one of the least expensive non-well bottles at the bar.  My friend owns a bar, and said he pays $6/750ml for FireBall and I pay $19/1.75L at Costco. I completely understand making a profit, but this was just insane! Typically priced around $5-6/shot depending on where you go.  Not a place I will ever go again, and had I just stopped for a drink, I would've given them 1 Star, but the food was pretty good.  I never ask how much liquor is before I order, lesson learned :("
Sandra H.,"Phoenix, AZ",80,17,,1.0,9/6/2015,I wouldnt know what the food's like... after 30 minutes after placing our order consisting of a burger and salad... we left. Never got our food. Ambiance ok... service sux!!!
Grace G.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,101,70,3.0,9/15/2013,The food is unique & good. I have eaten there for lunch and dinner and it seems to be a popular place. My husband had a burger and I had the chicken salad. Good service and decent meals. I enjoyed seeing many of their dishes trying to infuse different flavors.
Jennifer W.,"Kent, WA",2,33,,1.0,11/18/2013,"We have been to this location twice - once on New Years Eve (with a new trainee attempting to serve us) and years later for lunch.  First it hasn't changed with the horrible customer service.  The hostess avoids looking at me for about two minutes, then says, ""Party of two?"" and she points to the bar area to seat ourselves....We then seat ourselves, a waitress approaches us and we request water and menus  - we get those in a timely manner.  She then takes our order and we never see her again..... we sat there for at least 20 minutes with no other interaction from her.  We then go up to the hostess stand to do a courtesy notification that we are leaving because we have not received our order nor seen our waitress again and her reply is ""Do you want to speak to a manager?""  Obviously, this is a problem here!   DO NOT GO HERE - THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER CHOICES IN THE VALLEY!!!!!"
Sargis N.,"Glendale, AZ",225,139,105,3.0,1/2/2015,We came in with a party of 15. Yeah it's big but hey business is business. They made us a table and we sat down. The waitress didn't wanna do her job. Seemed like we made her night a nightmare. She came around a few times before the food came out but when they passed the food she didn't come back till everyone was done and she brought the checks. So for a good 25 minutes she didn't come or anyone asking if the food was good or if we wanted any refills I was stuck eating a chicken sandwich with no drink. Food is okay nothing to go crazy for.
Jackman R.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,81,9,2.0,12/7/2014,"Just another chain restaurant. Dry meat, cold fries, poor service. Not sure what I expected when I walked in."
Casey A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,14,,4.0,7/15/2014,I've been here a handful of times and I've always been satisfied.  only 1 time has my food come out wrong and the manager was very apologetic and and had the right dish out in no time. You can't go wrong with the flat bread pizza!
Shirley R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",13,79,4,1.0,7/9/2013,"Let's just say that the employees need to go through a re-training.  We get our food, and most of us are out of the water that we initially received.  We ask the server (not the waitress) for water, but it never comes.  Now we are completely out.  We grab another waitress - not ours because why would ours come back - and ask her for water.  10 minutes later she comes back - with one glass - for a party of 4!!!  We finally get our waitress to bring water.  She finally does - but no lemons this time.  I guess we are being punished.  Seriously, if employees have time to stand around talking, then they have time to grab pitchers of water and refill glasses.   I know there is no money in water, but it's all about customer service.  We were all obviously done with eating, and had been for a while, and I catch our waitresses eye.  She says ""oh, do you need something"".  Yeah, like how about your take our plates, offer us dessert and our checks??!"
Lisa G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",44,49,16,5.0,5/14/2015,"The food is AMAZING. The dessert is even more AMAZING. I became obsessed with this restaurant when I was pregnant, that was the first time I ate here. I think the rewards program is amazing, we are almost to the top reward 25$ off . they have so many selections, makes you come back to try it all!"
