Kelly H.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,35,,5.0,3/28/2015,We often have trouble finding places that can accommodate my son's shellfish allergy. This place did great. Food was delicious and we had a wonderful server. Loved the handcrafted sodas - all caffeine free. Will definitely go back
Beth S.,"El Mirage, AZ",141,484,17,5.0,3/28/2013,"I don't typically give chains a 5 star review but we had an OUTSTANDING experience at this BJ's last weekend and here we are a week later and I'm still very pleased! We had a group of 12 people and from the time of reservation to the time we got our check we received 5 Star treatment all the way!  The food was good, the service was EXCELLENT, and the overall experience was top notch! We will definitely be back!"
Emilie P.,"Phoenix, AZ",55,51,17,3.0,1/8/2014,"Reasonable HH in the bar area that is great for an after-work hangout. We ordered quite a few things off the specials and finished them all without complaints. In sum: -California flatbread was tasty and completely made by the bacon. Toppings were not plentiful, but adequate and the HH portion was reasonably cut into 4 portions. Not bad for $4, but I wouldn't order the standard size.  -Boneless buffalo wings were just as you'd expect. I like variations on other dishes, but don't mess with my buffalo. Good job on keeping it standard. -Spinach-stuffed mushrooms (not on HH, but ~$5 for a small plate) were not my favorite. If you like lightly flavored 'shrooms, then great. I, however, expected more flavor and these were drab.  -Avocado egg rolls were my favorite overall. Unique (at least to me!) and creamy, with a hint of spice that leaves you guessing what's going on in there. Our waiter was great, non-intrusive (though we hung out for about 2 hours), and cute...so that's a win! My standard gin & soda was actually kinda strong...in a good way! Though BJ's did not blow me away, it's nice, comfortable food that is great for all folks. I'll be back to try some of their extensive menu offerings."
Melaina S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,4.0,5/16/2013,"Went here for a mother's day lunch and had nothing to complain about. My dad and I got the same burger (don't remember which one; whatever the most original basic one was) and he was in LOVE with it, although I was not impressed. My mom and brother enjoyed their meals, and our server was nice enough. Not much to say. Food was fairly prompt. Certainly a just fine restaurant."
Tony T.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,125,,4.0,1/13/2013,"Well, I have been to this location twice now and both times the food has been excellent! I'm a Chicago pizza snob and I really did enjoy the thin crust with pepperoni & sausage - simple & delicious! My only rub on this place is the service.  Our first visit was horrible!! The place was more than half empty yet we still had to wait for 15 minutes for them to ""clear a table"" and then we had one server take our drink orders, then another shows up ten minutes after we got our drinks and proceeds to welcome us again & asks if we wants any drinks. WTF? Then we had a third server take our food order! It just made us dizzy and each one seemed more confused then the last. The second visit was better however, I overheard the table next to us complain because they didn't get the extra garlic bread they ordered until the meal was done. It cracked me up when a server finally brings the bread when they are paying the bill and says ""Do you still want this?"" So, good food - spotty service....place was packed on Friday night though. Oh, I forgot to mention - a glass of house wine - house wine - I did say house wine right? 10.25!! Yikes! house wine!???!"
Dave N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4,59,21,5.0,12/20/2014,"Great food and drinks every time we come here. Everything is always clean and well taken care of. Our server Kimberly C was amazing and made sure we had a great experience. Next time we are back, we will try to get her as our server again!"
Ryan C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",106,353,1254,4.0,4/13/2013,"I'm definitely a fan of BJ's. Their pizzas are very flavorful, come in many varieties, and they have plenty other choices if you're not in the mood for that. My personal favorite is the barbecue chicken pizza."
Cassie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,47,11,2.0,12/11/2015,"Went there for lunch today and this had to be one of the worst eating out experiences I have had in a long time.  To start, it took 8 mins before anyone acknowledged me sitting there. It wasn't until my friend showed up until we were greeted and asked for drinks. We knew what we wanted so we ordered our food at that time too. The meal did come out timely even with the lunch rush. (Earned one star). However, we noticed instantly that there was a long black hair in the coleslaw. No one came back to refill our drinks or ask how the meal was. We were forced to eat the remaining part of our meals while the black hair in the food started at us. The salad plate and side dish were stacked on top of each other at the end of our small 2 person booth. No one stopped to pick it up. We waited and waited for the server to come by so we could get out check. I eventually had to flag down another server to help find ours. At that time we made him aware of the black hair, requested that side item to be removed off the bill. He finally removed those dishes from the table but left our other food plates in front of us.  The manager came by (2nd star earned) apologized and removed an entire meal off the bill. He was the one that removed the last of the remaining food plates.  It took us 1 and a half hours to eat lunch and check out at this place. With the hair, crummy service and mediocre food, we will not be going back."
marty b.,"Scottsdale, AZ",54,92,1,2.0,11/19/2014,"Went here for my husband's daughter's birthday per her request.  This was our second visit.  Service was very poor with inattentive waitress that had zero personality.  I really don't understand this whole runner concept. Our food was literally dropped off at our table & there was no sign of our waitress to see if we needed anything, which we did.  Our son in laws order was wromg & there were no condiments for hubbies fries. So we waited & waited.   This is unacceptable for the prices we had to pay for rather mediocre food at best. We will not return again. There are too many good places that we can go to. Don't waste your time or $ here. Also when I asked our server for J&B scotch she didn't think they had it.  She was unwilling to go check & after some reluctance on her part found out they did have it.  Go figure."
Jeffrey B.,"Warren, RI",13,131,2,4.0,5/4/2013,We visited today for the first time and the food was very good. The Thai chicken wontons were fabulous. I had the turkey burger which was also very good. Others had salads and sandwiches and everyone was pleased.
Peter Y.,"Phoenix, AZ",243,61,16,3.0,11/2/2014,"BJs is a nice combination of a few things Sports bar, microbrewery and pizzeria.  The wait in a Friday or Saturday is not worth it but if you can get there at the start of happy hour there are usually enough seats.  Their hamburger pizza is awesome!  The beer is pretty good but not as good as four peaks.  They do have pretty good lunch specials as well."
Bill J.,"Glendale, AZ",44,173,660,4.0,12/30/2012,"I've been going to this location off and on for a couple of years now, typically for lunch with friends, colleagues or family, and it's never really disappointed me.  I'm a huge fan of their tomato soup, greasy though it might be sometimes, it is nonetheless delicious and I always have to have it. My only gripe is that their idea of a 'bowl' of soup is basically a coffee mug, not an actual bowl. If you're hungry, make sure you order the bowl or you'll probably only get about a shot glass worth from the 'cup' version.  For the lunch specials, my favorite has long been the chicken fettuccine, which has always been good, although I must admit I've had mixed experience with the pulled pork sandwich and the blonde shrimp, both a tying for a close second. Both the pork and the shrimp I've gotten in bad form a few times, not wretch inducing or anything, but it's definitely been sub-par from time to time (tough pork, badly battered shrimp, etc.). I've always gotten a sincere apology when things go awry and offers to make it right, but I have to hand it to them that there's never been an issue with the pasta or the chicken therein, so I keep my fingers crossed and stick with that these days.   If I'm not in the mood for pasta, my new second favorite is to go with their BBQ chicken pizza, another item that they've managed to be very consistent with. Probably not the best pizza out there, but for the money, it's certainly par for the course.  Service is typically pretty good, but if they're packed for lunch, you can generally expect the drink service to fall off the radar. This has been a consistent theme, regardless of who our server is, but it's hard to blame them when the place is packed. They definitely fill up quick around lunch time, so get there early if you want brisk service!  On the whole, I've no issues going back to this place. I haven't gotten any serious complaints from anyone I've taken here, whether they're friends, coworkers or visiting family members, so that says a lot. I'll definitely be going back."
Michael D.,"Mesa, AZ",48,44,15,2.0,10/17/2012,"First the good: I love the fact that as a business, BJ's supports groups like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is doing things in October for breast cancer awareness. I like that they have good seasonal brews - the pumpkin ale was quite tasty. They have a sizable menu - and the quality of the food is pretty darn good all around. However. The quality of the service keeps us from making this place a regular stop. It's just so sporadic - sometimes it's all right and sometimes it's sub-par like today. We were greeted warmly, our server (Erica A) came quickly and when asked for an additional minute returned quickly to take our order. This is where it all fell apart. After taking our order, we saw her only once more before paying our check. I know our $25 order wasn't laden with lucrative alcohol - but no refills on water, showing disappointment when only one of us ordered more than water, having to flag a bus boy for silverware while our appetizer got cold, watching the manager watch the football game more than the service - it all just sours us from coming more frequently.  It's a place that I'd like to come for happy hour post-work - but I just never feel good about suggesting it with the experiences we've had."
Brandon M.,"Livermore, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/15/2014,"Good food, horrible service. I've been to BJ's many times in the past, and the service has been a little slow. I didn't pay to much mind to it, as they were always busy. Today was different. I decided to take my mom to lunch and chose BJ'S. We were seated within a few minutes and got our orders ready. 10 minutes later, no waiter. 15 minutes, still no waiter. A new group was seated by us and they were served almost immediately by another waiter. After 25 minutes of nobody coming once to even get our drink order we got our menus, dropped them off at the front desk, and left. This was the first time in my life I've walked out of a restaurant. They definitely need to work on service. A lot."
Karen K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,2.0,2/6/2016,"Never again! Okay, let me start with i am not the type to complain about restaurants in this fashion. Usually i just say ""wow! That sucked"" and avoid the place. But this place needs to hear how bad this was. First, it took 50 minutes to be seated. It's saturday night..it happens. Then it took 45 mintes to get our food. (I had to send mine back because it was cold, of course.) On top of it all we only saw our waitress 2 times in 40 minutes(in the first 10 minutes) because we ordered drinks. Thank god the bartender was on point that night, that was about the only thing that saved our night. By the time our food got to us though the drinks had watered down from us trying to make them last..... never ever again. Also, it took me 20 minutes to pay my check.  All in all 3 hours at BJ's for a burger, pasta, and jambalaya. I'm just done."
John H.,"Mountain View, CA",60,112,23,4.0,2/21/2013,"Good food, great service, reasonable prices.   My only complaint is that, like many other places that THINK they serve Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, they don't.  What they claim is deep-dish is, in fact, just thick crust pizza - a loaf of bread with ingredients - far removed from what you get on Wabash Street in Chicago.   Chicago deep-dish is baked in a pan, but the crust is THIN.  It's the ingredients that make it a meal-on-a-slice.  Did it taste good?  Yes.  Would I have it again?  Sure, it was flavorful.  But if you are expecting TRUE deep-dish pizza, this isn't it."
John S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,134,4,1.0,12/28/2014,"This place was terrible. Our server was in la-la land, late to greet us and was terrible and botched the order. The prices in my opinion for a like-kind joint where expensive. I saw no pride of ownership, and management was all but gone. The quality of the food lacked taste, and the presentation was horrific. Save your money and go find another pub that appreciates your hard earned money."
Robb R.,"Edina, MN",54,123,145,2.0,2/20/2013,"First time there and thought it was a decent sports bar type place. I had the Jalapeño Burger. The burger was juicy and above average tasting. I like the toppings and overall flavor, but the bun failed. It was too big and didn't hold up to the burger. Half way through the bottom pretty much disappeared and I was left with the crunchy top part. The skinny fries were very good. The light Thai salad was decent but way over dressed. Good and friendly server who quickly replaced our first order of fries after they came to us cold. He even brought an extra order with our meal. Overall, decent food, good service, but it felt like a soulless corporate place. I would go back but would rather try someplace with more soul and a more unique feel."
Nicole G.,"Belgrade, MT",112,69,,2.0,5/31/2012,"While I try for the most part NOT to write negative reviews, I just couldn't help myself this time. I've been here for several lunch meetings and each time I think 'eh they're having an off day, next time will be better'. That's not the case. Every time I've been here (and it's only ever been for lunch), service is slow, servers seem confused and too busy (even though there are dozens of them on staff), there have been poor explanations of the dishes, food was served barely warm and of mediocre taste.  The restaurant does always seem to be busy though, so apparently other people have had different experiences - good for them.  ... On a lighter note, the beer is delicious. I've had the Pale Ale and the Red which both awesome. Perhaps if I were to try it again (doubtful) that I should just sit at the bar?"
Jeff E.,"Tempe, AZ",132,66,1,1.0,11/20/2014,"Our Waitress was great.  Very attentive, very nice.  Beer was ehhh, ordered 3 pizzas.  All 3 minis came out cold, undercooked, with no sauce at all.  Mine was so undercooked the dough was still in the doughy stage.  Needless to say the pizza was really bad, might have been the worst I have ever had at a restaurant ever.  Not a fan, will not ever go back....Giving it a one star cause our waitress was amazing.  She is the only reason I can say anything nice.  One of the best I have had in a long time.  Too bad the food was so poor."
