Hannah C.,"Tempe, AZ",77,236,790,4.0,4/8/2014,I knocked off a star because of one reason. Which is the slow service. I have only been here once but the service was bad. The 4 stars are for the great food I had to make up for it though. The food is great and so is the customer service although it can be slow. It is fairly priced and the quantity for what you pay for is good.
Kelly V.,"Phoenix, AZ",96,699,,4.0,7/12/2012,"Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous ""bitch fizz"" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception."
Seth B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/14/2014,This was one of my worst restaurant experiences. We arrived at noon and waited for about 25 minutes for a table. We were seated and ordered. It tok until 1:45 until our food arrived. The order was incomplete and it took awhile to get a server to correct it. There were 4 in our party and we all ordered soup and salad which should be a staple so we couldn't imagine why it took so long. My wife's soup was cold and I got seriously ill with a GI upset. You can be sure that we won't be going to BJs again!!
Nick J.,"Milwaukee, WI",72,46,11,4.0,6/5/2012,"As a large chain I will say that I am a fan of BJ's. One of the nice things is that this location is just like every other location, in that its the same menu and same food.  One thing that i love about BJ's is that I have always had good service, they do a great job of training and making sure that it is done right. Sometimes during busy times there can be issues with not getting your food as quickly but that is what is expected. Sitting at the bar is also a prime spot with the large amount of TV's and a solid selection of draft beer. When it comes to their ""craft"" beers they are hit or miss. As a huge fan of a good beer I cant say I love BJ's brews but they also offer a decent other selection. When it comes to food they are pretty solid all around. The ""deep dish"" pizza is good, i enjoy the BBQ and the pepperoni. You cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches or burgers they are all solid. During my last visit i enjoyed the wings as an appetizer and used the wing sause and ranch as a dipping sause for the crispy thin fries. Delicious! Best part about all the food i will say is the pizookie, i love the pizookie! you have to try it.  Overall, BJ's is good a little bit pricey for what you get but they do a quality job on all the food and service and are fairly consistent in all their locations. Good place to go for a family dinner, beers with some friends, or just a place to go and have a decent meal."
Katie G.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,71,26,1.0,3/10/2014,They were so rude! Which doesn't bother me as bad as the poor food! I had the Alfredo and my chicken was cold. My sister had the chicken pasta and said her broccoli was almost frozen. Won't go here again!
L M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,24,,4.0,7/21/2014,This is good standard fare for a Brewhouse. There is a good beer list and a wide range of menu items. We have been here many times and always have a good meal. Great for families as well and there are lots of TV's around to catch any game going on. We will definitely be back again.
Sarah F.,"Apache Junction, AZ",33,227,46,5.0,8/21/2012,"The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit"
Lisa F.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",54,60,22,2.0,2/16/2014,"I was very surprised by my visit tonight. This was not my first visit to BJ's. At our table of seven chairs, 4 of them were broken. This is a huge accident waiting to happen.   We started out our meal with the calamari appetizer. This was very good. No issues there.  Then with the meal, I ordered the margarita flat bread. I have ordered this before and loved it. Tonight was not the same. I think it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile before it was brought to the table. The last time I remember that it had more fresh basil on it, too. This time the basil didn't even cover the entire pizza and it was not very fresh. I couldn't even taste it. My daughter ordered the shrimp scampi. She asked for some grated Parmesan on it and they brought her some packets of Parmesan and told her they couldn't find the grater.  Really?  I am giving them 2 stars only because I know how good it can be ... how good it has been.  I don't know what is going on here but they need some serious attention from upper management to get it back to where it used to be starting with the broken chairs."
Trevor P.,"Phoenix, AZ",27,12,4,4.0,7/19/2010,"Well, I don't drink beer. That being said.  I'm a big fan of BJs.  I've eaten there a couple of times before, but never at the Desert Ridge location.  I found the atmosphere great.  Nice and open, clean and plenty of flat screens viewable from all locations.   The service staff was nothing amazing, but friendly and efficient.  Great menu, with lots to choose from -and the dish I got, the Piranha Pale-Ale Chili Cheese Burger was amazing.  The Pale-Ale Chili had a great flavor.  I'd say I couldn't stop eating it, but it was so big I had to.   My wife had a regular BJs burger, which was boring, but she said was tasty.  Daughter ordered off a good kids menu - lots of choices for a reasonable price.   And of course...the pazookie.   $40 for a family of three that doesn't drink beer isn't cheap, but it was worth it."
Patricia R.,"Condado de Orange County, CA",43,53,123,4.0,9/20/2012,"Awesome deal $19.95 dinner for two!! The salads were good, the pizza was ok, and the dessert good too! My husband went to picked up the food and he told me the people at the take out, weren't very kind."
Grace B.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,21,1,5.0,11/1/2014,"Food and atmosphere here is wonder, I love their spinach dip and their calizones. I would definitely recommend eating here you won't be disappointed!"
Claire B.,"Denham Springs, LA",9,67,4,5.0,5/11/2014,"I've eaten at other BJ's and wasn't too impressed. This location stands out for the service. From the moment we walked in, the staff were friendly and attentive. It is super kid friendly. The food came out quickly and was delicious. We also ordered takeout several times with excellent results. Overall, a solid chain restaurant."
Maggie T.,"Peoria, AZ",168,57,8,5.0,4/19/2012,BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA IS AMAZING!!!!! Pazookie is always yummmmy too!
Carol B.,"Toledo, WA",0,60,,4.0,4/17/2012,"Here in Phoenix for a week of spring training with March Madness thrown in.  We were here three times, mostly glued to a TV watching UNC. Good happy hour food and deals.  Pot stickers tasty, flavorful and just the right amount of crunch.  Flatbread, invent your own pizzas were very good.  I had the portobello with balsamic and motzarella.  Hubby  had the sausage and olive.  Crunchy crust, much preferred over the deep dish.   Bartender Shiloh ( dunno, maybe his mom was a Neil Diamond fan). Spotted us the second time we came in, knew our drink preference and offered up other spots to check out games.  Very nice, considering we'd never seen him. Looking forward to next year's cactus league, for sure."
E N.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,45,5,2.0,6/25/2014,"Lite tacos were actually pitas. Tasteless. My husband loves it as its a greasy food sports bar. But if I cant get a decent meal...even a basic salad or taco, they're dead to me."
Tasia T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",238,283,158,5.0,11/3/2011,"Haha, BJ's, now that that's aside... The food here is amazing! I came here for lunch with my mom even though I wasn't hungry at all. Their menu is large with something for everyone, even for those like me who come in with a very little appetite. They have a small bites menu consisting of stuffed mushrooms, ahi tuna, and a few other choices for $3. I ordered the ahi tuna that was seared to perfection for being such a small filet and the portion was perfect! My mom ordered the flatbread and salad lunch combo. I couldn't resist trying her flatbread. OMG, the crispy thin crunch of their flatbread...so delicious! I checked out their beer selection and was pleasantly impressed. I can't wait to come back with an appetite to try more items and beverages off their menu! The hostess greeted us with a smile while she sat another party in front of us and then came back right away and sat us. The server was quick and the food came out fast. The decor was nice, but its still a fun casual restaurant."
Deana H.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,10,,1.0,3/5/2015,Went in yesterday for lunch and wow did we get a greet.. Oh wait there was no greet lol waitress seriously walked up w a look of disgust on her face and said drinks?? Omg what where am I?? How abt how are u guys?? At least hi!!! Damn I was w my fiancé and our friend we all looked at each other like wtf but obviously ordered some drinks idk who trained This girl but usually when ppl order soda water u bring lime and when someone gets iced tea u ask if they use sweetener but whatever who am I?? Drops them off and seriously took off for five min then when she came back I asked for lime another five min I swear till I knew things were gonna be like this the whole time to where I got up asked for lime sugar and another server bc what I hate the most is when miserable servers ruin outings. She was pregnant idk what her deal was but u can still crack a smile but she was so not pleasant and awful omg like y r u in this industry if ur not pleasant go sit behind a desk if u hate ppl.. Sooo then we got alica and she was soooo sweet and perfect omg nit and day not just a great server w our order but so nice cracking jokes w us and really fixed everything pretty much so thank u alica I latterly thanked her for being pleasant from the nightmare we had b4 her so for the first part of service definitely put sour taste in my mouth and will not go back bc obviously the foods fine nothing to brag abt they re a lot of way better options to go spend ur money but at least the day ended good bc of alica.
Michael Z.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,125,5,5.0,8/21/2012,Sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service. Boy does that make such a difference. Friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive.   We did happy hour. I had a flight of their house beers. Really liked their Hefeweizen; crisp and tasty.  We had the wings buffalo style M with blue cheese sub for ranch. My wife didn't like them saying they were soggy. I thought they were ok but rather scrawny. They need larger ramekins to dip in too.  I had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was. Really thick with the meat.  Again bartenders Edith and Corey were outstanding. If we lived near by I would come back just for their service.
A V.,"Glendale, AZ",0,14,,5.0,7/18/2015,"Great restaurant & atmosphere! We shared the calamari appetizer & it was delicious. We had the cod & jalepenos burger for dinner. Both dishes were great!!! Nick is the nicest, most professional, down to earth waiter! He recommended great meals & his conversations were enjoyable! Thank you BJs & Nick!!!"
Meredith W.,"Glendale, AZ",291,14,1,1.0,9/7/2013,"My boyfriend decided that he wanted to have his 22nd birthday dinner at Bj's, it made sense because we were going to Dave and Busters afterwards. I called about four days in advance to make a reservation for 15 people at 8:15pm. I spoke with a manager and everything was worked out. We arrived a little early, around 8, and were told that our reservation had been changed to 8:30. This was unbeknownst to me which was irritating because they had my number on file and I had 15 hungry people showing up expecting to be seated at 8:15. Well, unfortunately this was just the start of things! We didn't ACTUALLY sit down at 8:30, we didn't even get seated at 9! We sat down to eat dinner around 9:15, PERFECT! By this point most of us were tired and mostly just wanted to go home. Personally I didn't even care about the fact that I was hungry anymore. So they assigned two servers to our table because we were such a large party which made me happy, I thought that would mean better service oh boy was I wrong! Our drinks took 20 minutes to come out, seriously? So we all put our order in and instead of entering all of our orders AT ONE TIME in the computer our servers entered them at randomly different times so all of our food came out randomly. Now let me add that everyone in this party has either served or worked in the restaurant industry before and we all know that when there's two of you, bringing 15 people drinks and appetizers should NEVER take 20-30 minutes. Now as far as the food goes, EH. Mediocre at best. The Long Islands were ten dollars and they tasted like shit. I had a five dollar Mai Tai and it was probably the most delicious thing I had all night! The ONLY thing I can give them credit for is their spinach artichoke dip, that was heavenly. Now we had all planned on leaving Bj's around 10:30 because Dave and Busters closes at one on Fridays. We didn't even get our checks until 11. SHOCKING. So we didn't end up walking out the front doors until 11:30. I was furious to say the least. All in all, I would NEVER EVER EVER reccomend this place to ANYONE or EVER come back here again."
