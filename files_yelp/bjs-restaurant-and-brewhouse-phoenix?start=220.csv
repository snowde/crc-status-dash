Scott W.,"Gilbert, AZ",411,40,7,4.0,2/14/2011,"My wife and I were staying at the condos at Desert Ridge and decided to go here with friends for dinner. We had a 30 minute wait for a table but a server came by and got us drinks while we waited and another came by later with some pizza to try. We were seated and our server was very attentive.  My wife had the chicken pasta and asked them if they could throw some cajun spice in it. Wow it was amazing, it should be on the menu. I had the pork chops, the apples and potatoes were good but I ordered the pork chops medium and they were well done. I was halfway through them by the time the server came by and I didn't mention it to her because I didn't want to wait for them to cook more. Our friends ended up having Pizza. It was good, not great. To be honest I am more of a thin crust guy and this was a thicker crust. All in all I would eat there again."
Boyd C.,"Phoenix, AZ",153,54,5,2.0,5/4/2010,"I was excited to try BJ's since I've had some positive experiences with Brewery's in the past few months. However, I left unimpressed.  I can't say the food was bad, but it wasn't remarkable. I had the burger, which was okay, but very greasy. My wife had one of the pizzas that had what appeared to be canned or stewed tomatoes on it which she thought were rather bland and tasteless.   I wasn't able to sample any of the brew selections due to constraints of the diet, but my wife did have a pint of their featured ale and she said it was really good.  The service was decent, and there was about a 15 minute wait to get seated.  All in all, I don't think I'd go back and so I'm filing this one under, ""been there, done that...You can keep the tee shirt."""
Tina M.,"Phoenix, AZ",33,45,6,4.0,6/30/2013,"I often meet friends here because it is centrally located for us. I have been to this restaurant many times and am never disappointed. They provide an extensive menu for a variety of appetites. And while I'm not a big drinker, their cocktails and beers have been warmly received by my dining companions. I've also found each waiter I've met to be pleasant, friendly and attentive to our needs. The only complaint is that it gets very noisy and on weekend nights the parking can be a bit challenging. All in all, I like this place, and enjoy meeting up with friends there because the atmosphere, food and folks are great."
Andrew K.,"Phoenix, AZ",249,156,3,2.0,2/9/2010,"One of our suppliers insists on taking us here for lunch about once a quarter.  It kinda sucks.  Not offensive, but awfully boring.  Things on the broad menu look like they should be better than they are.  Blah. Plus we can't booze at lunch.  What I've had for booze here (nothing recent) has not been at all noteworthy.  Avoid."
Sean C.,"Boston, MA",161,383,1,3.0,12/28/2009,"Vacation time spent by a trip to see the family is generally rife with compromises. After failing to produce an agreement on anything we all really wanted, we ended up at the somewhat unfortunately named BJ's Brewhouse. I half expected to see gaggles of teenage boys and tweenage girls (of roughly the same maturity level) stifling giggles about what ""BJ"" might stand for, but did not. The other half expected the food to be disappointing and for me to be already longing for some good Szechuan before I'd been in Arizona 2 hours, and pleasantly did not experience that either. Standard chain decor, standard chain service, standard ratio of operational to non-operational men's room stalls (non-zero.) We opted for the stealth $20 email special of a shared medium pizza (any specialty or number of toppings), a shared ""pizookie"" dessert and individual soup or salad which I would strongly recommend since normally a specialty pizza itself is $20. The starter? Minestrone with a bit of cheese. Italian. Adequate. Unremarkable. The pizza? A paradoxically Chicago-style Southwestern, like a chain boutique version of Pizza Hut. Solid crust, great by Seattle standards (low.) The dessert? A very thin (Peanut Butter, among the 5+ varieties) cookie in a pancake-sized tin topped with vanilla ice cream. I was more preoccupied with whether Madame K's Pizza Brothel, er, Bistro in Seattle copied the Screaming Orgasm from them or vice-versa (and thinking they would have been better off to copy BJ's pizza) than the experience of the sweet cookie. The verdict? For optimizing any particular aspect, one could do better elsewhere, but the pizza is quite good among mostly forgettable accompaniments. Chains are generally compromise candidates, and in that vein, BJ's Brewhouse performs the job."
Ilse K.,"Surprise, AZ",40,50,6,3.0,7/16/2014,"beer selection is good but the menu seems to be all over the place.  Their waitstaff tries very hard.  Bartender at the Peoria location is outstanding. Some of the small bites on the menu are good but the pizza is ""over-Americanized"", too fluffy, grease, too many toppings, a mouthful of yeast."
Alex B.,"Advance, NC",0,14,,5.0,9/2/2013,"I F*CKING LOVE BJ'S!  No pun intended. The restaurant is great too. The service is fantastic, but then again, who can say no to BJ's? The food is pretty damn good and the beer selection is awesome. Really though, I always feel treated right, the staff is awesome. The bar tenders are actually pretty cool and personable even when they're busy. Anyone who's read my reviews knows by now, that if it's a good review it's gonna be short and sweet, but my bad reviews are gonna be LONG and very descriptive. This place got the formula right. Great food, great atmosphere, great people, great beer, great desserts, terrible parking lot. The best places always have the worst parking lots."
Marisa S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",791,812,300,2.0,12/13/2011,"I have been to this BJs a few times, mainly because someone else drags me. I wouldn't come on my own. Our twin group president wanted to have our last board meeting here.  She called a month ahead to let them know we would need a large area, preferably a private room.  The person she talked to assured her that they could accommodate us.  The day of the meeting, she called early in the morning to let them know we would be meeting at 6:30.  We got there at 6:25 and they were not expecting us.  They told us to wait at the bar while they set up the tables.(We were 18 twin moms, yes large board).  Well, the room was not private at all, it was just another area, divided only by half walls.  The noise level was so high, we could not hear each other.  We ordered some food, which was ok, nothing to write home about.  My Fundraising co-chair didn't get her meal until I called a waitress and made her aware of that.  Our meeting ended up being the fasted we have ever had, mainly because we could not really engage in conversation.  I guess we won't be coming back.  I think I am finally out of people who could drag me to this place."
Tracy T.,"Phoenix, AZ",135,163,32,4.0,11/22/2009,"The main reason for the four stars is for their Angus Roast Beef Dip -- it is delicious!  It is up there on my list of favorite French Dips. The meat is super tender and juicy, and the horseradish spread really compliments the sandwich. Plus, it is a great condiment to dip your french fries in.   The portions are huge -- my sister ordered the Sesame Chicken Salad and she barely ate half of it. I, of course, devoured my sandwich. They have a huge menu, with a lot to choose from. They seem to be known for their pizzas, which look really yummy too. The atmosphere is similar to most sports bars, although I'd say this place is more of a ""high-end"" sports bar with chandeliers and mood lighting instead of ripped vinyl and dirty blinds.  There is a massive flat screen TV. above the bar, and little ones interspersed throughout the restaurant. The wait can be a bit long on Friday nights and weekends, but you can call ahead to get your name on the wait list.  And, they are nice enough to offer you some small pizza bites while you wait. Overall, BJ's is your standard chain restaurant/sports bar, but with a few extra niceties to make it stand out above the rest.  I'll be back for sure, and maybe next time I'll venture outside my love-for-the-french-dip and try some of their other goodies."
Jan C.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,29,2,2.0,6/5/2012,"I haven't been impressed with BJ's the last couple times I've visited and I'm not going back. I am newly gluten free and they have limited menu options for a GF person like me although I do appreciate that they offer a GF pizza. I can usually find something on a menu that will fit the bill so I ordered the Thai mango chicken salad. It was certainly nothing special considering the $12 price tag. I was disappointed to see that all their salads ran that much with the exception of the garden salad which was $9.75 + $3 extra to add grilled chicken. They've really increased their prices. My husband's vanilla Dr. Pepper was $3 and he was not offered a refill. So, like I said, I won't be returning."
Aimee S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/4/2014,"So disappointed!!!  I used to love BJs restaurant.  Their food is no longer the great delicious quality that it used to be.  It was as if they received frozen prepared food in a box, microwaved it and served it.  Everything we ordered tasted stale or like a cheap thawed out frozen dinner.  Our waiter offered no resolution whatsoever and had a ""so sad too bad"" attitude stating that corporate changed some of their recipes and they had no control over it.  He also charged us full price for everything even though we ordered happy hour specials. We had to remind him that it was happy hour.  Never going back."
Chris T.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,39,19,5.0,8/26/2010,If you don't like something on the menu... no big deal... they have 100 other things to try.  This menu is quite possibly the second largest menu (behind cheesecake factory) that I have ever seen.  And this is just the food!  My personal favorite is the Parm Crusted Chicken. Did I mention that this was a brewery that had some great beers as well?  There are very few seasonal beers I can tolerate but every season BJs releases a new beer (even if it's a repeat from last year) I am amazed at how delicious it tastes.
Barbara S.,"Cave Creek, AZ",0,49,,1.0,10/7/2014,"We haven't eaten here in several years and now I remember why...ordered the flatbread pizza app. , when he brought it out he dropped some pieces on the table, I said we aren't going to eat that so he said well I'll see if they can make a couple more..pretty sure they just flipped those over and returned to table..gross!! Didn't eat that!! Then came the cobb salad, old lettuce no romaine, no bacon either..very lame! Server was pretty much like casper..disappeared the whole time...."
Vince V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,6,,5.0,7/2/2013,We ate here again on Sunday night.  The food is always good.  The baked potatoes are a solid 2-3 lbs!
Jenna A.,"Glendale, AZ",5,16,,5.0,11/27/2012,"I went to Bj's when I lived in SF. I was excited to learn we had one in the north valley! Nothing short of spectacular. Never had a problem here, food is always excellent, and if the food is ever late or ordered wrong, we're always compensated with something small like a free beer, desert, or that specific entree/app for free! Waitresses, waiters, and bussers are on there stuff. I recommend this place to friends who want something a little more upscale than Outback, or someone who wants something a little different than your old fashion pizza. You've got to try their cheeseburger pizza, it's astounding."
Brad S.,"Phoenix, AZ",15,6,,3.0,1/17/2010,ok food in a applebees sports bar type of environment.  Good beers and ok food - although the pizookie was great - just needs more ice cream) Good selection of kids food as well.
Velika L.,"Phoenix, AZ",83,142,5,2.0,12/30/2009,"Skip the fettuccine alfredo. It's better at any italian restaurant. Wedge fries were good though! And of course, you can't resist the pazookie! Waiter was very nice and patient considering my friend and I sat there for 3 hours catching up."
Jasmine A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",149,694,154,2.0,10/2/2011,"Unfortunately this is the worst BJ's location I've ever been to, and I love BJ's food normally. The deep dish pizza was just not that good, and I normally think their deep dish pizza is a model of perfection. The crust wasn't really 'deep' and more like regular pizza crust. The toppings were pitiful - barely any sauce, practically no cheese, and very little of the toppings that were supposed to come with the pizza. I was so disappointed. The service is great but that doesn't really matter to me when the food they are bringing me is sub par. They have all day happy hour when games are on and the bar has a decent number of TV's with NFL Sunday Ticket but the food was too disapointing for me to go back."
Andrew R.,"Washington, DC",36,46,404,4.0,6/9/2010,"You must try the Captains Mug - Captains Morgan and BJs homemade rootbeer, delish!  The steak was good and the potatoes were huge. The fish and chips came with a generous helping, but were on the salty side. The pulled pork was also very salty Good service but a tad slow."
Tracy L.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,71,25,5.0,8/31/2011,"Excellent menu - servers are super friendly - great for kids!  What more can you ask for... oh yeah, the food is awesome, too!"
