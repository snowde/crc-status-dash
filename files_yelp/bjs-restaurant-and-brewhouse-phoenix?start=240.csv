R. C.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,224,16,3.0,11/24/2012,"Nice comfortable place, didn't eat this time just some drinks at the bar. Friendly service little steep on prices but would go back."
Melissa M.,"Anaheim, CA",64,64,14,4.0,6/4/2012,The service was great from walking in the door to the end of our meal. Our server was friendly and got our order right when we even had food allergies which is always a must. I got the new light salad:Thai mango chicken and it was awesome. I love a good fresh and a little spicy salad. It was very refreshing and filling.  BJs always has great brews too...try the lightswitch for a good lager under 135 cals.
Eric H.,"Phoenix, AZ",228,87,28,1.0,10/25/2011,Disgusting.  First had to send back the paint thinner tasting Jeremiah Red than on to the worse than frozen pizza and my wifes prime rib sandwich stayed a little too long.  Barf!
Ted J.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,37,27,4.0,8/10/2010,"I love coming to BJ's for their special brews of beer! They always have something unique on tap to drink! Beer is a little more expensive then your typical bar, but you are paying for a microbrew. There food isnt half bad either! They have a large selection of food to choose from - Pizza, Pasta, Sandwiches, etc. There is something for everyone here!  If your going on a Friday night or Saturday night do the call ahead reservation right before you leave the house. It will save you 15-30min of waiting in line for a table."
Evike R.,"Cave Creek, AZ",2,87,,3.0,4/19/2015,"i've frequented this place several times.  love the beer selection and the service was fantastic this time.  however, my girlfriend and husband had never been here and ordered the poke bowl and steak.  the poke bowl was extremely small to begin with and more than at the yard house in $$$.  i ordered the white pizza personal and it was delicious!!  i wish they had an outside patio :)  good idea to call ahead and we were seated very promptly.  very busy last night with prom but still a warm, pleasant atmosphere."
Jill A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",9,47,,4.0,6/4/2011,"Have to give this place 3-4 stars for food but 5 stars for service. Great service so I've gotta average it out. Basic chain restaurant food. My shrimp tacos weren't so great. Didn't care for the crispy, dry flour tortilla. I prefer the corn.  Not much shrimp in tacos. Sauces were okay.  The seared ahi salad looked pretty good. Tasted the pulled pork sandwich and I really liked the savory sauce...not too sweet. Pizza was okay. A bit greasy but edible. I prefer thin crust. Service was amazing.  Someone in my party ordered a mojito and her glass came to the table sticky. She told the waitress. Waitress offered to get her a new glass but she said she was okay and wrapped a napkin around it and was fine.  Even though she was fine w/ the glass, the manager came over and offered to replace the drink and she did.  Excellent customer service as the waitress did not just ""sit on it."" She took the minor complaint to management and they took a minor complaint seriously and did something/anything about it to please the customer. Top, top service. Had to bump up to 4 stars."
Amanda R.,"Prescott, AZ",11,58,10,3.0,3/4/2012,"Don't be mistaken - BJ's does not serve craft beer. Some of them are good but it is contract corporate brewing. We enjoyed the Scottish Ale and the Brown Ale and a dessert. Our bartender was a super nice, service was great. That's all."
Kenny B.,"Snellville, GA",32,21,,3.0,6/4/2009,"I suppose my score would teeter in the gray area of a 3.5. This place has it's great points: good, brewed beer; incredible deep-dish pizzas loaded with toppings; and, from what I saw, attractive wait staff (always a bonus).  My short-comings list would be: the Applebee's-esque environment; and horrible placement/identifying of the facilities. Those don't seem major, but when you need to go number 1 between well-crafted home brews, you don't need to make laps around the place. Especially weaving your way around the islands of high schoolers who are enamored to be there. Also, given that this place attempts to combine the sports bar with a family place to dine, it clashes too loudly and, on a packed-out night, I could see this place being overkill. I know this might be coming off harsh because they do have some magic working for them. Their pizzas are bomb. In this new age of pizzas with thinner crusts, these pies kick it old school with their Chicago style crusts. Complimented by their over-abundance of toppings, these pizzas rock. That is all I can say for their amazingness. You will have to try the pizza for yourself. As far as brew goes, with me being a beer snob, this was a good brew. I ordered the Kolsch and my broseph selected the Porter. Both had a good consistency and overall taste. The Kolsch was a little reminiscent of Four Peaks kolsch, perhaps with less vanilla. It had a some characteristics of a red ale to it. Overall,  I feel like they can put out some good beers. So looking back over this, I will bump up my teetering score to 3.75. You will just have to experience it for yourself."
Chloe C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,,4.0,6/11/2014,"Pretty good food. Reasonably priced for the great quality. Servers are considerate and nice and I've always had a great experience coming here. On weekends there can be a little bit of a wait, but that's expected for most sit-down restaurants. Definitely a fan(:"
Chukki S.,"Phoenix, AZ",95,1020,289,4.0,3/7/2011,"One of the best things about this place is that they serve food until midnight, when most of the other places stop serving much earlier.  Their menu is huge- everything from pasta to burgers.  Everything I've had on it is good.  The building is newer- it's a clean, comfortable place with a huge wall of TVs and cozy chairs.  Huge ceilings, very spacious.  Service is adequate- nothing special but gets the job done."
Hanner O.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,35,7,3.0,10/25/2013,"I've always enjoyed this place...it's very clean, good vibe, reasonable prices...but tonight it took 10 minutes for us to get 2 drinks....I've been staring at them at the bar for 5 min."
Leslie R.,"Phoenix, AZ",102,97,14,4.0,4/28/2011,"There are very few restaurants open late, and thankfully BJ's is one of them, giving them a bonus star. I've been to this location a few times and it's consistently good. Good service, good food, good drinks. Nothing special stands out, but we've never had any issues either (other than that one time a couple people in our group got into a yelling match across the bar area and were asked to leave...but that's a story for another day and had nothing to do with BJ's itself). Nachos with Blackened Chicken & a Berry Burst Cider = win."
Shari N.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,24,,4.0,1/24/2012,BJ's is a great spot to grab a bite or even catch a game.  The parmesan crusted chicken is so yummy and they brew their own root beer!
Tim E.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,26,2,5.0,5/17/2013,"Awesome desserts , wide variety , decent price!"
Renee W.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,78,,2.0,1/21/2012,"This is one of those cookie cutter type of place where you see your typical beer drinking crowd, your typical menu with not much surprise, and typical chained restaurant quality,  with your typical server trying rush you out of the door.   Nothing really out of the world but consistency is their best quality."
Paul T.,"Mesa, AZ",1,38,,4.0,7/22/2012,"We eat here fairly often. It is consistently good, and I like the variety. I like the ""house"" beers as well, I am a fan of the Tatonka Stout. The fish and chips are above average, and the size of the dish is large. My wife and I often split it. The potato skins are good as well, nice large crispy potato skins with cheese and bacon. They are not soggy and shriveled like at some places (Fridays....) I order the burger often, and it is above average. The crispy thin fries are excellent. I have had a few friends eat the steaks here, and they both enjoyed them. They have a strawberry shortcake like desert that is very, very good as well.  All and all, a well rounded place to eat. It is also usually relaxed with an acceptable amount of noise, and many TVs if your dinner date is boring."
Erin A.,"Peoria, AZ",33,33,2,5.0,4/13/2014,I wish this place was closer to home... Excellent food quality and consistently good service.  It is larger than it looks from the outside and has a completely open feel with high ceilings and a huge bar area.  Seems like it would be a fun place to hang with friends and it's also family-friendly; our kids love the menu!
Pete M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,55,2,5.0,12/14/2013,"Been to BJ's in Dallas and S Calf and decided to stop in here with the wife. We were told a 10-15 minute wait and the hostess was right on. For a Friday night, wow! We were seated and offered a beverage right away. We decided on the 2 for $35. I ordered Salmon, my wife ordered the Rib Eye. A little while later, Igor, our server told us there was an issue with a server error and another server took my wife's steak. It would be a few more minutes  before her steak would be ready but my salmon is ready now, do I want to wait? We said, no , bring out my salmon.  The steak was ready 5-7 minutes later. No big deal, but the manager came out to apologize and gave us a BJs Holiday Card worth at least $5. Great customer service and great meal. Igor, our server was great. Will be back."
Lindsey O.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,20,,5.0,2/17/2011,"I really like this place! There salads are awesome and huge! I love their BBQ sliders too! They are so yummy! I usually do take out and they are so kind, because I always call 15 minutes til the kitchen closes. I always look forward to eating here!"
Matthew K.,"Phoenix, AZ",1311,193,14,3.0,8/20/2008,"Average, average, average.   Had a few beers and tried several others.  All were fine but seemed watered down a bit. Had a few apps and they were standard issue.  Meh. I'd rather go here than an Olive Garden, I guess that's the best way to sum up how I feel about this place."
