Justin V.,"Phoenix, AZ",130,98,314,4.0,4/29/2011,"Until recently i had only had the pizza, but their enormous encyclopedia of a menu is full of tons of delicious options from sandwiches to pastas.  Overall very impressed with the quality of food which encompasses a multitude of genres."
Brian D.,"New York, NY",0,36,1,5.0,3/2/2014,Went in expecting typical pub style food and instead food was amazing!  Was a first time visit here - but would definitely go back!
Michael L.,"Chandler, AZ",10,10,,5.0,12/21/2011,"Great food, great beer, great service!!  Been to Bj's more times than I can count. Never a bad experience. Pizookie's Rule the World.....at least my world!"
James Y.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,73,10,4.0,4/24/2009,I like their deep dish pizzas a lot! The freshly chopped cilantro on top of the bbq chicken pizza is amazing. I love cilantro on anything! The best part is on happy hour the mini pizzas are half off.  Also for a place that does pizza mostly their chicken wings are darn good as well.  If you like deep dish pizzas this is one good place to get one. They are on the pricey side of pizzas so don't expect pizza hut 5 dolla specials here. Again the best time is to get one on happy hour!
Melissa W.,"Abbotsford, Canada",2,19,,5.0,2/25/2012,"Went here after a day at a nearby museum and the food definitely was more than I expected.  The waiter gave me a second soda drink without me asking and asked me if wanted a third, which I declined.  The Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing and more than I expected and wish I had a place like this to go home to!"
Bryan B.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,95,,3.0,5/18/2009,"The wife and I had our Friday night dinner here recently.  We are not a stranger to here, with this probably being our 5th visit or so...  The wife was having a hankering for their Berry Burst Cider...  For me, BJ's is probably to a 3.5 than an 'a-ok' 3 star...it's just there isn't anything terrible memorable about this place for me.  I mean, on the car ride over, I was trying to figure out what I like there, but couldn't figure it out.  I think it's that BJ's makes a lot of things that are good...but nothing that is particularly memorable to me.  I can't recall ever having a bad meal there, yet I can't recall having a great meal.   The service was good, friendly and fast.  We were lucky to get there early enough to not have to wait to be seated, which was good since they filled up pretty fast.  I had a french dip sandwich with fries.  Standard french dip, though I must say that the horseradish cream sauce had a decent bite that I liked. As noted above, 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars.  I wonder if the real thing that will hook me on this place is the pizookie, which I've never had...  (Oh yeah, I didn't like that happy hour was only in the bar, which it would have been the whole restaurant...at least it is decently sized (3 - 7pm)."
Brian W.,"Yorkville, IL",0,6,,5.0,1/18/2014,Great pizza and beer.  Enjoyed the spicy meatball pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza. Wonderful place to go grab a bite to eat. Good service.
Joshua W.,"Queen Creek, AZ",11,64,,4.0,6/24/2008,"There are quite a few things that are great about BJ's Brewery.  First off, their beer offerings are better than average and very consistent, no matter which BJ's you go to.  They fall short of the beer offerings from such brew houses as Four Peaks and Sonora Brew Pub (then again what beers come close to being as good), but they are solid offerings nonetheless.  I highly recommend the Pale Ale and the Stout.  Secondly, they have a great happy hour.  $1 off beers, $2 off all appetizers, and half off mini pizzas.  The mini pizzas are very good, and they have a wide range of great appetizers, all of which are quite tasty.  And for those of you with a sweet tooth, they have a pizookie that is to die for.  The regular menu items are divers and very good.  I used to go to the Chandler location a couple times a week and have had most items on the menu, all of which left me very satisfied. The restaurants is large in size, with a nice bar area and large screen TVs you can see from pretty much anywhere you sit.  They are also very family friendly, and can get quite crowded, especially on the weekends.  Despite the place being packed, and our server being the only one in the bar area, service was very good and very friendly.  They also have a take-out option (similar to what Chili's does), and I saw quite a few people while I was here take advantage of this service."
Janet D.,"Phoenix, AZ",96,11,39,5.0,2/23/2011,This place has everything to offer in the choices for food & beer. I just love the options. Kid friendly and the staff is awesome. Reservations maybe a good idea if you are going on the Friday or Saturday night as it can get very busy.
Miss C.,"Phoenix, AZ",21,138,189,1.0,6/2/2010,"Not worth the effort. The beer here is pretty bad. And they charge for tasters, so to try a beer to see how bad it is before committing to a full pint will cost you money.  It really irks me that they do not brew their beer at each location, yet have it shipped in... not very mirco brew of them. I have been to a couple of their locations, including this one.. It took me 4 tries of this company before I realized I was never going to leave thrilled and to just give up on BJ's.  The service on average is slow and at times moody (with the customers that is, with other staff members they goof around and snap each others exposed thongs-that was a bad dining experience). The food is bland and boring.  On my final visit my boyfriend's entree came out to the table and mine was nowhere in site.  Five minutes later our server finally came by to tell me that my chicken had been burnt and it was the last one they had, he was oh so kinda as to ask me if I wanted to order something else.  WTF? Really?!? Are you serious with me kid, no I want to sit here and watch my boyfriend eat.. what kind of question was that?  So 20 minutes after my boyfriends meal came, I got my meal.. some pasta thing.. should have just ate my napkin, might have had more flavor. The only MILD saving grace of BJ's is their pizza, its decent, not amazing, but decent.  But one decent pizza will not bring me back to this joke of a brewery.. and btw..what's with the garage doors on the wall?!"
Lucinda N.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,31,25,5.0,3/5/2011,3/3/11: Tonight it was a takeout smorgasbord of goodies... New pork chops tasted great in restaurant & now in takeout too. Love Santa Fe rolls - next time I'm asking for two each of the sauces because then I don't have to worry about double-dipping accidentally at home. Same for requesting an extra sauce with pot stickers when I'm sharing a meal with someone  :) Tonight the takeout food is as good as in restaurant & it's a rare restaurant that can do that.
Karen F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,25,,2.0,8/16/2013,"I first tried this place when they did a ""test"" meal prior to opening.  I wasn't impressed then and I'm not now.  The food is mediocre at best, the service not even that good.  Even the iced tea is awful.  And you could perish of thirst waiting for a drink refill.  I got a cobb salad, and it didn't even come with a roll, bread or cracker.  There are plenty of other places in the Desert Ridge area that deserve patronage.  Skip this one!"
Scat C.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,14,,1.0,6/2/2013,"Went for late lunch and we both ordered a deep dish large pizza at about $25 a piece, we wanted to take some home...If you love bread, then buy this...because 80% of our pizzas were bread with a little toppings on it...if this is their idea of ""deep dish"" it is very sad. I would have sent them back, but did not want to embarrass my son. You could have easily peeled off the layer of cheese and ingredients because it was that slight...Will never go back for their so called deep dish pizza."
A T.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,110,,2.0,6/9/2012,"With our 2 salads & beer, waitress was confused & had attitudeNo bread or crackers with salads & small portions!  Never going back."
Jerry G.,"Chapel Hill, NC",1,22,6,4.0,1/17/2013,"Went for a late lunch and it was an excellent experience from entering to leaving. I had the Pot Roast sandwich and my wife, a Hamburger Patty Melt. Both were delicious, the service relaxed and a good value. Don't miss their brand of tap beer."
Arnie K.,"Phoenix, AZ",115,31,,4.0,5/31/2010,"I have been to the particular location many times.  Except for the wait, we have always had a good experience. I just love that deep dish pizza. I am sure it is on slice away from stopping my heart, but not here for the health food."
Matt T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",14,8,4,5.0,8/8/2009,Great food and atmosphere. We eat here on a regular basis and have never had a bad time or food.
Kelly B.,"Phoenix, AZ",79,155,38,3.0,10/2/2006,"This place is a pretty mediocre restaurant for vegetarians who don't drink.  The only reason I've been back a couple times is because my fella likes their pizza... they also serve massive baked-potatoes.  Last night they wouldn't serve me a Gardenburger because there is spinach in it.  I understand that they are looking out for our best interests (so I don't get sick and so they don't get sued) but since it isn't FRESH spinach it seemed a little excessive.  The FDA lifted the ban, get over it and gimme my sammich!"
Joan A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,17,,4.0,1/9/2013,"I'm a regular there as I live close by and discovered a new salad that it just fabulous.  I eat healthy food and this fits my needs as it falls under their ""Enlightened"" category.  So next time you're in look for the Thai Mango Chicken salad.  It's very hearty and healthy too.  You may have to wait in line quite a while for a seat though.........."
hilary c.,"Phoenix, AZ",89,184,2,4.0,1/19/2010,"My best friend loves coming here for happy hour/lunch. We used to come all the time until the manager made a snippy comment about us going other places more, so we stopped coming at all for awhile. But last week we went back and it was good. I love the southwest salad with salmon on top. It's a tiny bit spicy and the dressing is just right-not goopy. I love the avocado's and black beans and the red pepper they use to dust the plate. It just works for me, especially with happy hour glasses of pinot grigio! MMmm!"
