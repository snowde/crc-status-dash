Richard B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,10,,4.0,8/16/2012,"I don't drink booze much these days so I can't speak for their beer etc. However their salads are great. The burgers are really good, the fish and chips are darn good for the valley, and so are their soups. The only thing I have had that I was disappointed in was the stuffed mushrooms. I would give five stars except the staff though friendly don't seem very organized, and often take rather long to check back (or at least that has been so with me)."
Sky M.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",31,98,2,4.0,6/18/2009,"We love the chili-cheese Burger, it's huge and is more than enough for both of us. We also only sit in the bar area, the service is quick and normally we want to watch a game while we eat. They have a good selection of Micro-Brew's, the Red and the Brown are my Fav's."
Marianne R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,8,,4.0,8/29/2010,"The menu at BJ's offers an extensive variety of entrees.  My mother and I decided on a lite lunch so we ordered the soup and salad.  The salad was pretty basic but the minestrone soup was delicious! And so much for the lite lunch, since it was all you can eat soup we did indulge. BJ's is a popular Restaurant and at prime time hours does fill up fast."
Brent S.,"Redmond, WA",527,85,10,3.0,4/24/2009,I have only been here a couple times but the food was really good every time. I have had the pizza and a couple of the sandwiches. All delectable!
Ellen R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,,5.0,5/31/2009,"My five-star rating is just for the deep dish pizza and its croissant-like crust.  It is delectable!  As a former Chicagoan, I claim some expertise in deep dish pizza (eating, not making), and I've got to say that B.J.'s makes the best.  I've never had any crust like that.  Ever.   I haven't had much else at B.J.'s  The multicolored chips and salsa was very good.  Didn't care much for the thin crust pizza appetizer.   The Pazooki (huge hot cookie served in a pie plate with ice cream on top) is yummy, but the last one I had, it was uncooked in the center.  However, you get a free one if you tell them it's your birthday! THE best BJ's is in Laguna Beach.  Order one in the restaurant, and go sit on the boardwalk at Main Beach.  Just something about that sand blowing on there!"
Arindam S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,7,,3.0,8/2/2010,I paid a visit last Friday. This place has good food and more variety than yardhouse. But the drinks are way costly. The long island comes at 9.75$ and a mojito comes at 8.50$. If you have the money it's worth paying a visit.
Nick L.,"Peoria, AZ",62,20,,3.0,10/5/2011,"BJs, overall, is a very average restaurant.  I like the variety on their menu, and the food is usually good, but it often takes a long time to get it.  The service is generally good (although we've had a couple of bad experiences), and the atmosphere is pleasant overall.  It really doesn't stand out to me in any way; it's a good place to visit when the mood strikes but not necessarily one of the top restaurants in Desert Ridge."
David K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5,32,3,4.0,5/14/2007,"BJ's is a very consistent restaurant. I have been them all over the West Coast and they all taste great. It is a great place for beer lover's because they brew their own brew, that's actually pretty good unlike some brewery's. For the underage or non-beer drinkers they also have draft root beer which is absolutely amazing.  There specializes are massive potatoes and pizza. To be honest the pizza is good but not great. It is suppose to be Chicago style deep dish but comes up short for true Chi-town pizza lovers. The potatoes, which are there own meals, are unlike anything I've ever had. They are very filling and very good. My favorite is the Blackened Chicken which comes with a potatoes, spiced chicken, cheese, red peppers, and Alfredo sauce to dip your bites in.  Also the sandwiches are great. The French Dip and BBQ Beef is highly recommended. If you have room for dessert, the freshly made cookie and ice cream called poozkie is great. A little secret is about BJ's is that all of the lunch specials that are said to be over at 4, are always available if you ask. The best is the half potato and soup/salad. I recommend the calm chowder, it is a hefty portion that can be a meal in itself."
Luke S.,"Laveen, AZ",8,56,12,5.0,7/31/2007,"Solid experience from a typical brewery. I have been to BJ's several times now, usually after eating somewhere else in the Desert Ridge area. The typical visit usually includes drinking their blonde concoction, and watching sportscenter. The food i have eaten there was really good, including a chicken pasta meal that is one of the best i have ever had. Its 3/4 restaurant, 1/4 bar with tall ceilings and no smoking. Other than good food and drink there is not much else that separates BJs from other breweries, but thats ok. You will find a mix of adults and families before 10, with mostly adults in the bar after 10. Not much on the singles scene, so bring a crew with you!"
Nick S.,"Phoenix, AZ",90,111,44,3.0,1/27/2010,"Bj's is just ok. They have some good dishes and some bad. I do have to say there wings are very good and i could eat a lot of them. They are breaded. Normally I'm not in to a breaded wing but these are good. The breading is so light and the sauce is delicious. I have been here many times for meeting with friend for a beer and apps. I have ha d a steak, it was good, the california chicken sandwich was ok, it would be better if it had bacon on it. They have shoe string fries and wedge fries. Its always good to have an option. The decor is nice,  upscale sports bar is the best way to describe it. The host and server s have always been nice and knowledgeable, but on more than one occasion after the food was served they never came back to check on us to see how the food was or to fill our drinks. When you serve the food you have to make sure the drinks are filled. I like there blond brew and there amber brew, but did not care for the others I tried. They do have a good selection of lunch specials ranging from $6.95-8.95. Overall I feel this place is hit and misss, some good some bad."
Jennifer M.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,54,,4.0,7/23/2010,"We have dined at BJ's several times and have always been pleased with the food.  Our favorite is their Happy Hour 1/2 off pizzas in the bar area.  The portion sizes are large and are great to share or take some home!  It is kid friendly whcih is a bonus for us.  We also really like the new smaller bites menu, it makes it easy to get several different dishes to share!"
chelsea k.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,17,,2.0,7/24/2010,BJs is all over the place and in other states. I have enjoyed their food but i have to say the service is really suck. I was a server recently for over 6 years and i know what good service is. Im not going to complain about the food because the food its great! But they could MAJORLY improve on the service quality.
Mandy B.,"Glendale, AZ",0,21,,5.0,8/29/2010,"I cannot believe I forgot to Yelp this place! Definitely deserves every single star and I would rate more if I could. My boyfriend and I recieved a gift card here and both had never been so we decided to check it out one night. It was a little later on a weeknight, around 8, so it must have been after a rush, there werent too many people in there but I can tell you it had nothing to do with the service because it was excellent. I wish I could remember our servers name because she was awesome, she helped us out (being our first time and we wanted to try some of their beers) She knew exactly what she was talking about and made great suggestions and comparisons. We started out with a couple of great tasting beers. I cant remember the name maybe the BJS blonde..(I know I am no help not remembering the menu items names) The menu was very large, so many things to look at and pick from, no matter what you were in the mood for. We each ordered an individual appetizer, I had the bruschetta, and he had the shrimp skewers, both were absolutely delicious and were decent portions. (I was worried when I read individual, usually that means mouse sized plates with one bite.) Next we ordered our meals, I had what I believe was a Cali chicken sandwich, and he had a Cali burger, both were amazing. The green chilis on my sandwich were my favorite part. The service, atmosphere, beer, food, and night were all so amazing it was a great experience and we will be back!"
BOB N.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,2.0,10/8/2011,"Been here twice, never really enjoy anything about it. The service is ok at best. As mentioned in other reviews these folks work real hard at ""upselling"" which is what they are supposed to do but it needs to be done with a better delivery, not so much of the car sales extra warranty and rain protector package. Now the food is about as boring and bland as anything I have ever had. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for the table as an appitizer, this may sound stupid but all they tasted like were mushrooms. They are supposed to be stuffed with some other stuff but did not detect much of that. On to the entrees. I ordered the fried artichoke hearts with an aoli dipping sauce. They tasted like crunchy. Thats rite crunchy, no flavor at all. I ate 1 and became disenchanted. My mother had the pork chop and told me to have a bite so I could be a believer in there food again. It was served with sauteed onions so all I tasted was onion, again lack of any disconcerable flavor I.E. pork. I must say that my 1 year old daughter enjoyed her Mac N Cheese and apple sauce very much.Oh my other daughter ordered the mini corn dogs but got Mac N Cheese. The server offerd to correct it but we didnt really care any more. 1 thing I found odd was that at no time did the server ask any of us how the food was even though I clearly had not eaten any of mine and nor had my wife, (chicken lettuce wraps) they were'nt bad just not good. Overall not worth the $60 bill for such medeocricy. Its ok though. People with a limited palate and bland taste need a place to eat to."
Ann Marie K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",81,215,17,3.0,5/25/2007,"When I was first brought to BJ's with a friend I was a little skeptical of the huge menu and the fact that it wasn't busy, but I was pleasantly surprised by their deep dish pizza which still keeps me coming back. Nowadays there is always a wait for this hot spot at Desert Ridge. Although BJ's does do a good pizza nothing about the restaurant or service really stands out to me. The service has always been hit or miss in my experience, and the huge menu can actually be a little daunting. One time while feeling like a healthier option I tried the other famous item on the menu the big baked potato. The potato was extremely dry and lacking in advertised size, so I left hungry and disappointed. Although average, I would recommend BJ's for dates and group gatherings as it is an open atmosphere with a menu that can please just about any one. Also if you have room after dinner try the pizookie! They have mastered this favorite dessert of mine, and it is offered in four different flavors."
