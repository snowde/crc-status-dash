Becky R.,"Gilbert, AZ",96,246,189,5.0,8/26/2016,"Fun spot near great shopping!! The food was good, lots to choose from! We liked the lunch specials. The chicken club was great & loved the wedge salad!"
Laz R.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,21,5,4.0,4/27/2017,"Love this place! Good food & great beer. The staff "" Alec S "" server rocked it. Knowledgeable about the menu & house beers. This is also a good family friendly environment. My go to for a good prime rib & top shelf craft beer lineup."
Ashley W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,41,10,4.0,1/25/2017,Came here on a Monday night with my husband for dessert and a beer. We got the salted caramel cookie desert. It was amazingly delicious!! The service was a tad slow for a Monday night. I might return again.
David L.,"Phoenix, AZ",111,177,34,3.0,2/17/2017,"We've been here a few times and unfortunately, the service is not consistent. It's not that it's bad. Sometimes it's very awesome and other times, the staff wasn't very attentive. One time, they forgot what I ordered and came back to clarify... you have notepads for a reason, right? 3-star because it's hit or miss depending on who's staffed that night. Nothing wrong with the food though! It's good as they come."
Suann M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,18,3,4.0,4/7/2017,"Service is wonderful! Easy to get a reservation with the app. We ordered the new Enlightened menu. Dear husband had the Peruvian bowl with chicken and I had the spicy peanut with soba noodles and chicken. The chicken was over cooked in both dishes. Both had great flavor. Mine was not spicy, I added red pepper flakes to kick it up!  And of course we had the Pizookie!"
Tracy W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",92,68,22,4.0,2/22/2017,Very nice restaurant. Came here for my sons birthday! Chicken parmigiana was good. My sons enjoyed their hamburgers. French fried the best!!! They really love the cookie  dessert! Our waiter was very nice! Good shopping area
Chris S.,"Racine, WI",1,18,16,4.0,3/10/2017,Stopped per yelp recommendations. It was busy but the service was fast and friendly and I loved my food. We love this area of Phoenix and once again not disappointed by our choice.
Jeff C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,54,18,5.0,4/27/2017,Awesome food and great black cherry soda im addicted to it and the restaurant is in my list everytime i have a soda craving
Laura L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",38,51,233,4.0,6/5/2016,"Large selection on the menu, went with the Santa Fe salad with blackened chicken. It was very good. The warm baked cookie with ice cream dessert trio was very tasty & more than enough to share. Nicely decorated sports bar. Prices are very reasonable & Amanda was a great waitress."
Paul M.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,3.0,8/28/2017,"Good food, good service.  Some beer prices are ridiculous.  $6.75 for a pint of Blue Moon!!  Not only do they NOT have Happy Hour prices throughout the place but they have the nerve to charge import price on a domestic beer brewed by Coors!  Last time I order that!"
Drew W.,"Peoria, AZ",0,5,,2.0,8/17/2017,I went here on Thursday ordered Parmesan crusted chicken. Chicken was warm not hot potatoes and vegetables were cold. This is second time I had potatoes and vegetables came out cold. I got quest and chips appetizer it came out with meal. I have received much better service in past and food was hot.
Jaimie D.,"Cave Creek, AZ",0,4,1,1.0,8/13/2017,"If there was a 0, I would rate it that. So we walk in on a Saturday for a nice dinner. We sit down and the service is ok. Our food came in like an hour. I ordered a deep dish pizza along with a side of fries. The fries came in a giant pile. They looked great. I ate probably 1/3 of the fries. My mom had like 5 fries and my sister had 2. We got home that night and I went to bed. The next day I thew up like 15 time. Over the next 3 days I threw up around 36 times. It was terrible. I missed school and felt sick for a week. So sick. My whole family got sick too. In conclusion, I would say never, never ever ever EVER go to BJ's"
Jim S.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,235,58,3.0,4/15/2016,"Have had lunch or dinner here several times and find the food very good. The service can be overwhelming at times. We were asked if we needed to go boxes not half way through our dinner. I finally had to shoo the waitress away. Their IPA is very good. All pizzas, burgers and fish dishes were very good. A great go to place in the area. I have always gone with family during the day or early evening but the bar looks like it could be a great place to go as well. Enjoy!"
Lynn C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,17,18,4.0,2/23/2017,Not a vegetarian but love fabulous veggie option..you must try the cauliflower pita tacos.
Sarah T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,15,,5.0,2/16/2017,We usually just go for the pizza and pazookie! But wow was I amazed at how good their bread bowl soup was! The place is kinda tight and it's always packed but like I always say... must be good food if it's packed.
KaylaMarie N.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,14,,4.0,2/16/2017,"My second visit to BJ's Desert Ridge was yesterday. My best friend Alex was in town from Canada and has never been. Two couples and a baby, so they sat us at a half-moon booth which was spacious and comfortable. Our order was taken quickly, although this restaurant has an enormous menu, practically a novel! Everything we ordered was plentiful in portion and prepared correctly. I love fettuccine alfredo and order everywhere I go...this version was slightly bland. My friend's triple decker sandwich had maybe two drops of mustard on it, but all we had to do was add more. Can't recall the server's name (young-middle age woman with half upper sleeve), but she was kind, knowledgeable and prompt. She left the restaurant before we did, but I am also a server and sometimes you just gotta go. We will be back next time we are in need of a casual meal."
Sean S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,53,8,3.0,6/19/2016,BJs -  I love the pizza and in house brew beer. There are two reasons I have give 3 star for this place. 1. Too much waiting time. I had to wait for hour and a half to get table?! Was the food worth the wait? Answer is NO? I can get same kinda stuff at many other restaurants  2. Too Loud!
Nick W.,"Phoenix, AZ",32,18,7,5.0,2/6/2017,"Slid into BJ's for dinner.  The wait was quick and the restaurant was nice enough.  I ordered the root beer cause it's supposedly made by them or something fancy idk the waiter suggested it so I went with it.  The menu was diverse to say the least. I thought about getting a pizza but just couldn't do it.  Then I noticed the spaghetti and thought ""it's time to get my olive garden on.""  The spaghetti was actually pretty good.  The waiter refilled my root beer on the reg and it wasn't expensive at all...like a dollar or two more than chilis."
Brad W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",203,1514,1940,4.0,2/11/2016,Join the email club for good offers. We got a large pie for half price the other day. The deep dish crust is light and airy. Plenty of toppings and free drink refils also.
Megan R.,"Glendale, AZ",188,162,3,3.0,3/13/2016,"Not impressed with this place anymore. I've been to many different locations recently in Arizona and California and there seems to be a common theme among all of them...bad service. Luckily, when I visited last week for happy hour, our server seemed to be one of the better ones. Their happy hour used to be decent and now it doesn't feel like much of a happy hour at all. The food is decent. Some of my favorites include: Chicken lettuce wraps Chicken potstickers Pork chile verde queso dip Parmesan crusted chicken Pizookie trio There are some things here that are hit or miss, but their menu is generally pretty good and one of the few places that has some healthy items that actually look like something I would want to try."
