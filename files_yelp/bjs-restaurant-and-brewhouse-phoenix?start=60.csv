Abigail T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,23,1,5.0,6/30/2017,"I really like bjs. They have great customer service, and their servers acknowledge our toddler, which I appreciate. You wouldn't believe the servers at most places who completely ignore our daughter. I get the clam chowder and the California chicken club. My husband loved the balsamic glazed chicken, but I think they've taken that off the menu. The pizookie is good, but I never get it now that I know what the pizookie at oreganos is like."
Catherine L.,"Memphis, TN",94,10,5,5.0,11/22/2016,"Great atmosphere, great beer, and even better pizza! Don't leave without getting a Pizookie (or 3)."
Karen V.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,8,,4.0,6/21/2017,"We had a large party - approximately 15 and request separate checks. The food was good, as always, but a shout out to our server, Gaelan K., who did a superior job handling our large table."
J. J.,"San Diego, CA",3,97,28,1.0,10/30/2016,Food was good but the 1 star is for the service.  Horrible service from the hostess to the waitress. We ate our food as quick as we could so we could leave. Never coming back to this location.
Monica C.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,70,46,3.0,3/27/2016,"Visited March 20th 2016 Desert Ridge location second visit and still not impressed.  The Pros: It was super busy and because there were only two of us, we were seated immediately. The Long Island Ice tea - one is all you need. Menu is large and can satisfy most in a party.  The in- betweens:  The lighting. Low lighting that probably makes every-one have a ""soft focus"" effect and look prettier :)  However, the lighting  casts a weird glare on their menu which makes it even more difficult to read.  The Cons: Menu too large to be able to specialize and pick something spectacular. I had the Mediterranean Tacos which my server claimed to be one of his favorites. I had no idea what I was eating, it was flavorless. The Mediterranean Tacos were supposed to have Feta but the Feta looked like a sprinkling of salt. My long island Ice Tea cost more than my meal (no joke). The font on the menu is too small, you will likely have to read the menu to anyone that may need to wear glasses."
Ali B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",373,367,529,4.0,1/5/2015,"While it is a pain that this place can get really crowded at times, typically it is worth the wait! I have been to this BJs location quite a few times, but had a pretty good experience when I last went here yesterday. I went with my family kind of early which was nice, because we just beat the rush! We were seated right away, and our server was kind and did a good job. To start off we ordered mozzarella sticks. I can be picky when it comes to my m-sticks, but these ones were incredibly good, was hard not to eat all of them. Didn't come with enough marinara sauce. One great thing about BJs is the massive menu, there are so many amazing options to choose from, it is hard! On Sunday I was struggling between going for the Avocado Eggrolls (used to order these all the time back in high school) or the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread. My mom and I decided we would get both of them and then split them! I hate to say it, but the Avocado Eggrolls just were not near as good as I had remembered them. They were kinda too cream cheese-y and spicy. They were ok, just not great. The flatbread on the other hand was incredible! I think I may have tried it once before about a year ago, but it was so delicious. Wish I had only ordered that!  For dessert we had to finish off with a pizookie..it is a BJs must! We just got a regular one. My only problem was that the cookie was all stuck to the pan! Had to kind of scrape it out. We destroyed it though, it was incredible.  Nice, fun restaurant to go to, I will be back for that flatbread and to try other stuff, have never been disappointed here!"
Bill L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,6,,5.0,5/24/2017,EXCELLENT service by Aubrey and staff.  Great food.  HIGHLY recommended. Thank you Aubrey for the friendly and attentive service.
Shokouh H.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",151,327,98,5.0,11/20/2015,"We never go wrong with BJ's. They have the best selection of very affordable and delicious appetizers (the tomato mozzarella salad and the stuffed mushrooms are my favorite).  Their entrees have never let me down, from their wraps and sandwiches to their signature deep dish pizza, there is something for every taste on their menu.  We last went there on veterans day and service was fantastic although the place was very busy. They were super accommodating of our very active toddler as well and our server even went the extra mile to bring her little crackers without an extra charge. Food is always good, the beer selection is awesome, desert won't let you down- what else can a girl ask for."
Mike S.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",0,6,,4.0,11/6/2016,We cannot say enough good things about Erica. There was a problem with our order and she went above and beyond to take care of us. We will definitely be back!
Analynn S.,"Peoria, AZ",64,106,11,4.0,2/22/2016,"Hello all my Arizona Chaps... BJ beet and arugula salad is a great way to jump start your lunch !!! Very fresh with lots a popping flavor . My husband and I then split the Grilled Chicken club . This tasty place is awarded Analynn's  Affordable prices , great services  and atmosphere!. Until next time ... Bon appetite ."
Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1317,1460,7211,4.0,8/13/2013,"What isn't there to love about BJ's?  The menu may take a few minutes to read if you don't know what you love there since it's large and has so many options - but I promise anyone can find something to eat here! The Pzookies are to DIE for - get one.  If you don't, you'll wish you had.  Promise."
Holly H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,20,23,3.0,8/21/2016,"Wait a little long for a near empty lobby. 20 minutes. Ribs were good, along with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  California club flatbread was less than stellar, very slight on all toppings for$10! Golden asparagus was way too greasy, i had to pull the asparagus out of the breading to eat it.  Wait person, Breanne was not very attentive. After being served she disappeared. We WERE going to have dessert, but after waiting and waiting for her return, I simply was turned off by having to ask the hostess to find her. The table next to as well were waiting for her to bring the check.  It was also quite chilly."
Picky E.,"Lancaster, CA",0,15,1,5.0,5/30/2016,This place was super awesome ! They got our burger wrong and so nicely fixed it. It was great customer service.
Doug S.,"Spring, TX",164,185,19,4.0,1/14/2016,"My wife and I met one of her college friends and her friend's husband for drinks.  We arrived around 3:30 / 4:00 in the afternoon and sat at the bar.  The bar staff when we first arrived were good, but the bartenders that took their place were much better.  I believe one of the bartenders' name was Ryan.  He was alot of fun!!  He was personable and friendly, and was cracking jokes with us and the staff throughout the night.  He was very attentive to our needs.  Some of the beers that I tried were Sculpin IPA (Ballast Point Brewing and Spirits from San Diego, CA), Union Jack IPA (Firestone Walker Brewing Company from Paso Robles, CA), and Jeremiah Red from BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  All three were cold and very tasty.  The IPA's were what I would call on the lighter side for an IPA.  Not really a strong taste to them.  We have a BJ's near us in The Woodlands, TX that we've been to before.  But this experience was much fun, and Ryan made it entertaining for us."
Craig G.,"Jersey City, NJ",90,304,69,3.0,8/5/2014,"Located in one of the many shopping complexes ringing the north side of Phoenix, BJ's is a brewpub/sports bar serving up casual fare at bargain prices. Blame it on the lunch rush: service was at a crawl, though the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. And the food was fine. I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries. I didn't get the chance to sample any of their dozen or so brews, but it looked like a solid selection. They brew their own sodas, as well."
Frank D.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,360,141,3.0,12/4/2015,"BJ's was a decent experience for my girlfriend and I.  We stopped in for an early dinner one night and some cocktails. There weren't any drink specials offered when we were there, but they do have a nice selection of drinks to choose from. I enjoyed a mojito, while my girl had a long-island iced tea.  Our server was super friendly, very accommodating and he took his time serving us so we could relax and not feel ""rushed"" to eat and leave. I ended up ordering their baked ziti and it was very good. The portion size was surprisingly small given the portions of their other plates.  For the two of us, a couple drinks each and dinner set me back nearly $70 (including a coupon for $10 off that my girlfriend had). I felt that for a chain restaurant, that was a bit high. I almost thought I was overcharged, but didn't feel like reviewing everything so I just took the hit end left.  In the end, I would possibly come back in the future, depending on how busy other restaurants are in the Desert Ridge area."
Pat C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,14,,2.0,3/23/2017,"Dinner on 3/2016 with friends.  Five(5)  different entrees. No one raved about their meals. They were ""OK"".  I personally had the ""new"" dish soba noodles with some peanut sauce.  It was soupy, weak tasting and definitely not something I would ever order again. I did not finish the meal.  Another party ordered a pizza. Nothing that warrants $15 charge.  Basic and plain.  Another party ordered a salmon dish, didn't finish the meal.  The steak dinner was rated ""ok"". And the salad entree was not finished.   We passed on dessert. Not the upside, waitstaff was excellent.  Given there are so many restaurants in the area to chose, I will continue to seek out better food."
Justin M.,"Glendale, AZ",22,9,,1.0,3/19/2016,It is date night with my wife. We have never been to this restaurant. We were seated promptly and that's where any service (I mean none) went out the window. We waited patiently for 15 minutes while we watch people entering after us get starved drinks. Our waiter/waitress was non existent. So after 15 minutes we threw in the towel and went down the walk to a different restaurant. This was my first and last visit to Bj's.  *(No star actually)
Matt H.,"Cave Creek, AZ",1,58,11,4.0,1/3/2016,"I've eaten here a few times now. Service has always been fast and friendly. They have a large selection of craft, imported, and domestic beers as well as fully stocked bar. While the dishes I've tried are not ""out of this world"". They're tasty, fresh and hot. Make sure to save room for desert. The cookie and ice cream thingies are to die for."
Ashley B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,11,1.0,3/6/2017,"I go here at least once a week. I love it. Always great service great people and great food. McGragger, the manager had one of the best customer service and I am so thankful. But don't get Jennifer. The horrible service I had with her is too long to tell. But mark my words don't get Jennifer."
