Victoria R.,"Mesa, AZ",8,39,16,3.0,12/1/2015,"I used to love BJ's. I went all the time when I was in high school and college, and when I met up with friends for dinner I was actually really excited they picked BJ's. But it wasn't how I remembered. They have changed their menu around so much a lot of my favorites are not there any more. There is still a great beer list which is awesome, and their appetizers were okay, but I was not impressed with my entree. Maybe I haven't been back in so long that the Parmesan crusted chicken is not a specialty anymore but it was just okay.  Our pazookies were really good as always, but I think next time I'll just sit at the bar and have a beer and dessert."
Dave N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",131,448,375,4.0,6/23/2013,"I don't know what needs to be said specifically about BJ's. It's a classic American restaurant/brewery chain. The menu is solid all around, the service is outstanding, and the root beer is amazing. If classic American cuisine is what you're craving and you're in the area, BJ's is not a bad choice by any means. Although the chicken fried steak was a bit chewy compared to my liking."
Sandra D.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,9,,4.0,1/1/2016,"My husband and I tried BJ's for the first time and the food was excellent.  After going through the entire menu (it's HUGE!!), we finally made a decision.   He ordered the braised short rib.  The meat was very tender and tasty. I ordered the steak and it was cooked to perfection.  The baked potato was a bit over cooked but I can overlook that. The server did forget my husband's beer but he apologized profusely for it.  Overall, we were surprised by the food and service."
R-unit K.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,57,12,5.0,2/20/2016,Lunch was awesome today. I had the Fried Chicken on mash potatoes and corn. It was outstanding once again! My wife had french dip and it was incredible. This place is great!!!
Simplelife S.,"Cave Creek, AZ",3,110,204,4.0,7/3/2016,Nice restaurant but very loud and dimly-litinside which  makes it hard to read the menus. The menu is too large and that makes it hard to decide what you want. A hamburger which was I have had the barbecue chopped salad which I probably would not get again my husband has the BJ's Pizza which I enjoyed.
Christine L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,,2.0,2/12/2017,"BJ's server was certainly warm and welcoming, but it took so long to be served our food.  We ended up asking our server twice what might be the problem.  We finally were served and the food tasted okay, but the hot food was luke warm that our friends ordered. Thank goodness my husband and I ordered salads.  But what was totally disturbing and in bad taste was the video that the business picked out on it's 4 panel videos throughout the restaurant.  The video was of OJ Simpson's life and it wasn't appetizing in the least to see his murdered wife and his wedding and them kissing, etc. There are a whole lot of other sport figures that would deserve to have their pictures played over and over while eating.  BJ's needs to show more care to their customers.  Spoiled my appetite!"
Janice P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,1.0,2/11/2017,"Super bad service. Starts with the hostess who could care less if you want a table and doesn't even greet you. Then it got worse after we were seated. The service was slow and we ordered a hamburger cooked medium and it arrived rare, practically raw. They took it back and sent out another one. This one was cooked medium. But service was slow. The manager came out and mumbled something that I could not understand . None of the staff speaks very clearly here. When we got the bill, NOTHING was comped. Most restaurants will comp a meal that was poorly cooked or at least give a free desert. But they comped NOTHING. So the waitress got ZERO tip. The waitress should have requested that meal be comped. They lost a customer tonight. This is not the first time I've had bad service but it will be the last as I won't return. There are tons of other restaurants to spend my money at and that provide much better service."
Bob H.,"Cave Creek, AZ",5,3,,5.0,12/5/2015,"Erica Is Simply theBEST!!!  Having a great meal at the bar while my wife was at a work interview. Being from Reno, NV,  I am a frequent visitor of BJ's. But hands down, though having good visits to my local BJ's, this was a most rewarding treat! Erica was a delightful lady to meet. Attentive, vivacious, and quite personable... Needless to say she is splendiferous while being quite professional and attentive to other patrons! Giving my visit a 10 for service, food, and above all friendliness & professionalism!"
Nancy R.,"Northport, WA",0,10,,2.0,1/8/2017,"Always look forward to meals at this BJs location when we head south for the winter. Today's experience was a disappointment for these reasons: after being seated right away, took forty-five minutes to get meal; waitperson was not too interested in her job (""What kind of beer? Well, I'll figure it out.""; never offered a soft drink refill; never said a word when setting drinks on table; never said thank you when placing bill on table). Meal was three stars, having easily been four or five in the past. We have purchased gift cards for family members in the past, but will probably discontinue that."
Lauryn G.,"Deerfield, IL",0,6,,2.0,7/9/2017,"When we walked into the restaurant we were never greeted. We waited almost 8 minutes until a very unfriendly host asked how many. Once we were seated, we were again not greeted by our waiter who threw menus down on the table before even saying a word. At that point we already knew we just wanted dessert. we ordered our food and the waiter very sarcastically corrected my order, which was entirely unnecessary since it was plain as day as to what I wanted. We waited nearly 30 minutes for our food, and as soon as it came out he handed the food to us with our check without even asking if we wanted anything else. We waited another 15 minutes after we were finished eating just for him to get done talking to his coworker and pick up our check. He didn't even acknowledged our presence, swiped our card and then thought it was be a great idea to be somewhat friendly to us just so he'd get a tip. As we left, we again saw the unfriendly host and another worker chatting, therefore, we also were never acknowledged on our way out either. These may seem like little details, but as a paying customer who also worked in the restaurant business those small details matter the most."
Kyle S.,"Chicago, IL",424,182,19,4.0,6/21/2015,"My favorite pizza in the Valley. Ya ya ya.....so what it's a chain. The proof and bake their doughs perfectly. The deep dish pizza is sweet and hot and is perfect for my pepperoni, jalapeño and pineapple tastes. Their brewed beers are fun and they recently started bringing in more unique styles.  No pizzookie this time but once I had the smores flavor I'll never go back. Until the promotion is over lol.  Where else can you find a fun little restaurant style sports bar open till midnight. It's great for industry peeps. Last but not least, Stewart is the best. He's the strong accented bartender that is pretty much a dream. He's been here for years which is amazing. He's polite, quick, witty and has a great memory. I will continue to try to steal him for my business!"
Nick W.,"Phoenix, AZ",87,42,2,3.0,10/10/2015,Seared Ahi Tuna Salad is awesome!  This place is very busy on the weekends but if you can make it before 530pm the wait isn't too bad.  Lots of great beer options! One of the few places you can find Ballast Point in Phoenix.  Good service and pretty good food. This is a good go to spot when you can't decide where to go. Lots of options on the menu.
Amanda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,26,1,1.0,8/2/2016,"Very disappointing!  Last night I ordered a hamburger medium-well.  I can't do under cooked hamburger meat. When I got it the inside was completely raw. So, I asked the waitress to please have the cook/chef cook it to my requested specification. She took it back and said that she would have the burger remade. I got it 35 minutes later and it was the same burger that I had the first time and it was cooked more, but someone added so much pepper to the burger that I choked when I bit into it. Will never return to this B.J.'S!"
Julia J.,"Glendale, AZ",0,15,,5.0,12/13/2016,"Can't say enough how much I love this place! From the chicken pot stickers to the ahi tuna salad to the pizooki trio this place has something for everyone! The bar has the best service in my opinion. The bartender who works late nights on Fridays and saturdays is awesome! Always leave full, satisfied and happy!"
Stephen R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,1.0,1/6/2017,"The food was good and the service was good, but at the end of the meal, our server lost my credit card and never found it. I just called back & spoke with a manager who explained they still haven't found it. So I just cancelled it and now get to begin the process of waiting for a replacement to reconfigure all of my auto-pay accounts that are linked to that card. I guess I would've thought they would have offered a comped meal or something, anything - heck, even a free appetizer on my next visit. I'm sure if I would've complained my food was overcooked, they would've done something. But all I got was, very simply, ""we're sorry"". Well, apology accepted, but I'm disappointed. Accidents & problems happen in business all the time, but how a business reacts and deals with those says a lot about their commitment to Service Excellence. I'm not really interested in a free meal, just a bit more genuine concern & attention to this matter than what was given. Show me this problem matters."
Lan B.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,82,7,1.0,9/12/2015,Tried to come here again since I thought I could watch the game with some close friends... Well the waitress didn't even smile.... I stopped thanking her for bringing things out since she wouldn't even acknowledge me. She seemed pretty angry about us not ordering drinks. There was a disgusting stench in the restaurant and it really made me lose my appetite. The guy at the host stand said we couldn't sit in the dining room... Everybody was cramped in the bar section and the smell was Terrible in this one section... Stay away. Manager is rude and doesn't even care about the lousy service.
JD N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",193,55,38,3.0,5/1/2016,Pizzas are OK and the salmon dish is a nice healthier choice.  I like to take friends here and get the pizza cookie because a portion of the proceeds benefit the charity for cystic fibrosis (CF) research.
Michael B.,"Cave Creek, AZ",63,32,1,5.0,11/16/2015,I had the chicken tenders and they were good  The waitress was Nice No Comments about how fast I was done lol overall great restaurant highly recommend
Christie G.,"Wilsonville, OR",23,42,6,3.0,4/13/2016,"If you're pleased with Chile's, Olive Garden and Applebee's then BJ's is for you. We prefer more unique and intimate restaurants. BJ's falls into the ""nothing wrong but nothing special"" category."
Kay K.,"Glendale, AZ",23,320,6,4.0,4/14/2014,"BJs is a nationwide middle to higher restaurant chain with a focus on beer. They brew their own. This specific BJs has about 8 of them. BJs has really wonderful service. The waiter was helpful, polite, and visited our table with the right amount of frequency. We had spiced salmon and Mediterranean tacos. Both were very healthy, but not too filling. a cookies and cream pizookie (Pizookie is the BJs classic dessert- ice cream on a warm cookie bottom) at the end of the night was a great way to finish. it tasted great!"
