Lizzette A.,"Tampa, FL",0,26,16,4.0,11/10/2017,"We picked BJ's Brewhouse, Wesley Chapel, for our monthly luncheon.   The commute was easy from Tampa and took us less than 20 minutes to arrive.  The restaurant looks new and the outside and inside were clean.  We waited approximately 10 minutes to be seated fir a party of 9 @ 1230. Our waitress promptly introduced herself and took drink orders.  The menu is extensive and covers a wide range of foods from fried, grilled, blackened, baked and raw. There are salads, burgers, wings, pizza, wraps, steaks and everything in between.  The roasted cauliflower with turmeric sauce was awesome! They could serve the sauce as a soup...delicious!  The roasted beets and the brussel sprouts were equally as good, but watch the salt!!  The salads were over the top and worth coming back for!! The steak was a little fatty, but the Salmon was cooked to perfection!  We would definitely recommend this place to have lunch or dinner.  They have a full bar and a good selection of imported and domestic beers.  A fair price for a good meal!!"
Shannon C.,"Brooklyn, NY",165,1,,5.0,8/1/2017,"I wanted to leave a comment about our experience because our server was noteworthy and our food was delicious.  My boyfriend and I have been vacationing in the St. Pete area for the last week. We came to BJs for the title Brewhouse and because we love our craft beer. Our server was Meghan and she was AMAZING. From the start she was extremely friendly and funny. She suggested Avocado Egg Rolls. I'm not sure what the sauce was, but they were delicious. Our dinner was just as good. His was also a suggestion, some sort of chicken dish. I personally loved their Cider beer.  All around great experience. If you are ever vacationing in the area I recommend you request our server!"
Bernice P.,"Tampa, FL",99,27,108,2.0,11/30/2017,"I had the peruvian quinoa bowl with shrimp. Its a 500 calorie meal. I think its a great choice for someone dieting or adamantly watching their calories. I ordered it because the combination ingredients sounded interesting. The bowl was good. I wasn't wowed, but it wasnt bad either. The seasoned tomatoe chunks and shrimp gave the dish most of its flavor. The quinoa didnt have much if any seasoning at all. I also signed up for rewards to get the FREE pizookie (pan cookie) salted caramel. Now im an absolute sucker for baked goods, but i didnt even eat beyond 2 bites of the cookie. It was sort of unappetizing. If it wasnt free i would have sent it back. The atmosphere is casual dining, clean, and family style."
Danielle V.,"Miami, FL",5,25,3,5.0,1/4/2018,"I had an amazing experience at BJs today thanks to my experienced server, Jen! She had multiple tables at lunchtime but juggled all of them like a pro and took her time with me, even though I was sitting alone! The menu at BJs is huge and it can be daunting. She provided thorough explanations for all of the different cuisines. Jen provided intuitive and delicious recommendations. I would recommend the tomato soup, margherita flatbread, and tomato mozzarella salad (best salad EVER). Thanks!"
Herbert P.,"Tampa, FL",51,7,28,4.0,11/11/2017,I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and sante fe salad.  Both were good.  Neither was spectacular but they weren't disappointing either.  The atmosphere is very casual and the setting serves the needs of many patrons.
Ralph L.,"Orlando, FL",88,73,47,5.0,7/12/2017,"MENU: 5 stars. BJ's has just about anything you can ever ask for, but it's a chain, so in theory won't most chains also have everything you could ask for? Maybe, but BJ just seems to have more of everything and do it better too. Case in point: their ribs are stunningly delectable and one of the very best I've ever eaten. Their ribeye steak also is phenomenal; their pork chop is second to none. I've had those things everywhere else, but I can tell you BJ's does them the best. Basically, you can't go wrong with a single menu option (outside of their pizza, which most people love, but not this guy). Prices are okay, they can teeter on the expensive side for some things, but their promotions more than make up for this. MOOD: 5 stars. I like BJ's ambiance. It's part brewery, part sports grill, and all class. The restaurant is well-groomed and displays some bits of the upscale. You can take a date there -- bowtie, martini, and all. Or you can simply relax at the bar area in jeans and sneakers to watch your favorite team get pounded. The point is, either way, BJ's has something for every occasion. LOCATION: 5 stars. The location is ideal, situated in the heart of Park Plaza. You can see the BJ's sign from different angles and the restaurant is difficult to miss. There is plenty of parking, which mixes and mingles in with Pollo Tropical parking, and if you really get desperate, Chipotle or PNC. STAFF: 5 stars. I've been here several times and I've never had a real problem with the staff. There are a coupe waitresses who have some RBF, but other than that, I've appreciated the service plenty. There have been times I have not enjoyed the food and I've sent it back, and they've accommodated me, no questions asked. The manager even came out once to see how he could improve my experience. If that's not fine service, I'm not sure what is. VERDICT: 5 stars for one of my new favorite restaurants and locations in Tampa Bay. This is a great fallback option anytime, and the versatile menu and tasty dishes make this a winner no matter what the day or mood you're in."
Brandy H.,"Gainesville, FL",153,19,12,5.0,11/11/2017,"Went today for lunch and our experience was awesome. Seated ourselves in the high tops in the bar area and we had a great lunch. Amber was our server, she was awesome. Not overly attentive but got us whatever we needed in perfect timing. she suggested the calamari and man it was so good. My boyfriend then got the ribeye with the white cheddar mash and broccoli and I got mahi tacos. His ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare with great seasoning and the mash potatoes are incredible. Broccoli was kinda weak but ehh it's broccoli. My tacos weren't as impressive. They were mediocre, I've deff had better fish tacos. We will be back to try more things off the huge menu!!"
Al E.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1,93,8,3.0,9/30/2017,Came in mid afternoon on a Saturday.  Seated quickly.  First few pages of the menu were completely stuck together. Next page had a long blonde hair on it.  Yuck.  Picked it out and kept going.  Next page had a curly brown hair stick to it.  That's it. Told the waitress and she brought another menu.  Guy came by to apologize and kibbutz.  Not really in the mood.  Wife had ahi salad and she said it was very good.  I had the chili and salad combo. Salad was good but the chili was lukewarm at best and not much of it.  Still can't get past the hairs.  If that's the cleanliness of the menus what does the kitchen look like?  Probably won't be going back. Chilis next door is just as good and a third less.
Jr H.,"St Petersburg, FL",229,23,5,5.0,10/14/2017,"I'm not quite sure why this place only has 3.5 stars but, myself and my family have always had outstanding food and service here. Also, I really like that they serve food until 1am on the weekends. We were headed home from a long flight and didn't want fast food. I had the Ahi tuna salad and it was fantastic! My wife had the chicken parm (as always) and loved it too! I had a multi fruit cider (sorry, I forgot the actual name of the beer) and it was really good. Definitely do not go by the 3.5 star rating, you'll be missing out especially on their desserts. I wish I would have took a picture of my salad but I didn't. You know how when you see picture ads or television ads the actual dish looks nothing like the advertisement...but this is exactly how it was presented by our very knowledgeable server Ashton."
Susan E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",13,108,72,5.0,3/30/2017,"The best happy hour in town. I enjoyed 2 double Titos - 4 dollars each, I wish I had gotten there earlier. My friend enjoyed a couple of Heineken lights for $1.95 each. We each had a salad and split the potato skins, brussels sprout appetizer and fried artichoke appetizer.. The entire bill came to $37. Now that's a great deal. Oh did I mention all of our dishes were delicious."
Tonya W.,"Largo, FL",1,25,10,4.0,11/29/2017,Lani  was an excellent server. Very professional and courteous. BUT!!!! Jennifer came out with an attitude as raw as the bison burger which was sent back. Lani is the reason for 4 stars.  Go Lani!!
Donna D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,11,,5.0,11/20/2017,"This is our ""go to"" place especially with company for a casual meal.  Great food especially the flat breads, tacos and pizza.  They also have a great bar that fixes awesome specialty drinks.  Fun place to eat, socialize and if interested watch sports on the dozen or so TV's."
Paula P.,"Pinellas Park, FL",214,36,69,3.0,6/30/2017,"I have been to Bj's a lot before, but Im not really a fan. I always end up coming for someones birthday. I don't hate it though. For this visit, I ordered the ribs which were surprisingly great because theu were tender and has great flavor. As an appetizer, I ordered the calamari, and it was great as well. The white sauce that came with it tasted so good! I loved it. At the end  I ordered the pizookie sample with salt caramel, triple chocolate, and monkey bread. Delicious. The reason why I am giving a 3 is because I feel like there food is overpriced when it is mediocre. Overall, I dont mind coming here, but I would never willingly choose it."
Ben C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,24,5,3.0,12/16/2017,Food is good usually. The pizza on Monday's are often made wrong. It's a pizza special day so the quality is not there always. But when the pizza is actually made right it is delicious. The lemon thyme chicken is usually good but there are many times it has no flavor at all. I would say there is no consistency at all here. If there was it would be higher on my list of places I like. The car side is a nightmare to say the least. I'm always waiting and waiting and waiting. Overall it's pretty decent
Mykie D.,"Valley Ranch, TX",498,898,757,1.0,4/2/2017,My sister had a long piece of hair inside of her avocado egg roll. My ribeye was flavorless and not cooked as I ordered it. They have Dos Equis on the menu but don't carry it. Customer service was just ok.
Michelle N.,"South Plainfield, NJ",55,100,15,4.0,9/14/2017,"This restaurant reminded me of an Olive Garden or a Friday's. The decor is nice, the place is huge, the food is good, and the staff is friendly. We came here for my boyfriend's birthday when we went down to Florida. We're actually from Jersey, so we don't have a BJ's Brewhouse up here. I got the alfredo, which was good. My boyfriend got the jambalaya. He finished it, so it was must've been good. My aunt got the Vegetarian Pizza, which she also said was good. She just wished the crust was a more crispy. I, overall, had a good experience here."
Christian W.,"Arlington, VA",43,21,4,3.0,10/8/2017,"Honestly, not really impressed with this place. Bartender was super swamped, bless her heart. The beers are not that good. For a brewery I expect better, but then again there are good breweries and bad breweries.   Overall their beer is not very good - I had a Brown ale, Oktoberfest, and a blonde ale, And all three of them did not impress me at all. We ate a queso and chips and some calamari and the food was decent, but the queso was fairly unmemorable. However, the highlight of the night was the manager Brett. He asked me how my beer was I told him it was flat - he checked the keg - fixed it and gave me a new beer even though I didn't ask him for one. He then introduced himself and had great personality. I'll give them another chance as a brewery because of Brett. thank you"
Amy L.,"Tampa, FL",53,163,15,1.0,12/11/2016,"One star is about the harshest yelp rating ever. I mean no stars would be, but then you wouldn't be able to read the opinions of cranky patrons. The thing is, I'm not really cranky. I'm just here to offer some criticism. Very constructive criticism.  We were in the Christmas Parade and wanted to go with our group somewhere close. We aren't jerks so they called about four hours in advance to notify BJ's that there would be 20 people coming. Four hours is enough time to have tables ready and staff accordingly. I think.  The first thing that didn't sit right is when we respectfully asked for another table to be moved over so we could have more room. The rude server was obviously bothered by that and declined us since he had another party coming. Half of our party had to sit in a booth beside the table while five tables in the middle went untouched. A large party did come, but there were other tables that could have been moved, and we didn't need his snooty attitude.  The second issue is that ordering went horribly. There was zero organization, and two kids didn't get their food. By all means, make an adult wait for their meal, but cater to the couple of kids who tagged along. I mean sure, they were teens, but still. Always cater to the kids.  Third: it took FOREVER to get our food, but the four top beside us had already finished eating, but they were part of our 20 person reservation.  All in all it wasn't a great experience. I don't think we will be back."
John B.,"Bonsall, CA",4,77,22,5.0,7/16/2017,"I was back in town for the first time in four years , Having lived in Pinellas County. 25 years  Previously I was blown away as to the changes that have happened all along US 19. This was my first visit to BJ's --- a friend suggested we go. Being a NYC born foodie I was sceptacle at first ... The place was busy as was to be expected on a weekend night, (Too nobody's fault a bit noisy) The menu was overwhelming with many wonderful options .. Better yet was our server Beth  (A taller woman with long blonde hair) - Beth explained the menu , at time even the ingredients to our table , she was very attentive bringing drinks immedralitely while giving us ample time to review the menu .. In the end Beth suggested the Deep DIsh Vegetarian Pizza, (a dangerous move to a NY born vegetarian). Often times I would not give a good review to a chain resturant Pizza...... But ,,,,,,,,, The was a awesome pizza .. A great mix of veggies and on great crust that although thick was  Done tastefully correct ... WIth all the options on the menu Beth's suggestion and especially service get 5*'s ...  Bravo ----  I be back for another soon !"
Kheila L.,"Orlando, FL",90,102,47,5.0,1/16/2017,"One word: PIZOOKIE literally the BEST dessert ever! My mouth drools just thinking about it. They are pretty popular around here so you might have to wait a little during peak hours. They have such a wide variety of plates, i think there is something for everyone. I love their pizzas and the jambalaya. My hubby lives their ribs. They have an amazing strawberry lemonade and their cocktails are not far behind. The TVs make the place a tad more casual and great for every crowd. I have been coming here since it opened and it's definitely always a crowd pleaser. Again, try that pizookie! Any flavor. Did I mention they have gluten free one?!"
Andrew W.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",348,265,2702,4.0,11/23/2015,"4 Stars for the variety of food and craft beer selection Thus would be a 5 star restaurant in my opinion if the prices were a little lower. Great selection of their own craft beer on tap as well as a huge menu of delicious food. The menu almost reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory's menu where there's so much to choose from that it makes it difficult. Though, I've been here quite a few times, this visit was for a drink and desserts. So, I tried their seasonal (think it was a pumpkin ale) - very good. Though, I usually just stick with their wheat beer. For dessert, we had their trio and WOW! It was delicious and just a perfect amount for two people. Restrooms are super clean and though this restaurant wasn't busy when we were there this time, it does become really crowded (usually a wait) on Friday and Saturday nights. It's also usually busy for lunch."
Lee S.,"St Petersburg, FL",40,19,,3.0,10/15/2017,Love the menu. Always have great servers but when the music goes off and the TV game noise goes on (cause you can't understand a word being said anyway) were out of there. There's a vibe we go there for and we left today without eating and went somewhere else because of this.
Dave O.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",651,2365,8182,4.0,6/24/2015,"I've been to a number of BJ's Restaurants but this was my first visit to this location. We stopped in for a business lunch between 11:30 AM and noon it was busy but not overly crowded. We were seated right away and greeted by our server she was very friendly and took our drink orders as she handed out the lunch menus. You'd be hard pressed to not find something you like here the menu is extensive not only in regards to the drinks but also appetizers, entree as well as desserts.  We ordered avocado egg rolls for an appetizer and placed our lunch order at the same time. Unfortunately the appetizer never arrived so I am deducting a star our server was very apologetic but the fact remains there was a disconnect between the floor and the kitchen, however it's wasn't the end of the world the salad and flat bread pizza I ordered was more than enough for lunch. I do like the fact that the food usually comes out of the kitchen fast the small miscue isn't a deal breaker for me I would definitely return."
Sieraaj A.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",16,35,190,3.0,9/8/2016,"(06 Aug 2016) We were invited to a friends birthday dinner here. We arrived at 8pm only to find out our friends have been waiting since 7pm for a table. They were told that the restaurant doesn't take reservations. We got seated just before 9pm.  Besides that, I had a good time! They offer beer tasting for the adventurous, ranging from various light to dark beers. They have an extensive menu which can be a little overwhelming however, it seems like they have a something for everyone. I got a portobello burger with skinny fries, it was superb! The wife got a mahi-mahi with shrimp, it was pretty delicious. A few people orders pot pizzas and soup inside a bread loaf.  I had a good time but was put off by the waiting."
Kelsey M.,"Southwick, MA",0,7,1,5.0,8/8/2017,"""Good beer, good salmon."" Bj's is a very good restaurant with delicious foods, fast service, nice atmosphere. I recommend this for any ages."
A.C. O.,"Largo, FL",0,46,,2.0,8/2/2017,"Went there for half price Pizza Monday and the Pizza was awful.  This place has gone down, maybe it is because of new management."
Annie C.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",313,307,225,4.0,10/22/2016,BJ's is a favorite of my son in law and hubby - doesn't matter how I feel they love the beer selections and get a menu with like 20 samplers lol I don't think it is that many but seems endless... food is meh but environment and the people we go here to meet makes for a great environment especially for large groups... parking is sucky but since it is in a mall parking lot just park across the road way
D C W.,"Tampa, FL",560,48,10,2.0,7/15/2017,"We ate there last night with a co-worker from out of town. he eats at the one in Los Angeles all the time absolutely adores it, other than our drinks being a little inconsistent in the amount of alcohol and tasting differently ..our service was just okay....we wont be back...."
Jack B.,"Memphis, TN",6,159,,4.0,5/26/2017,"Pulled off I75 due traffic being backed up for late lunch and pulled in here. Greeted and seated. 20 page menu overwhelmed. Staff friendly and helpful. Good food nothing fancy. Ate off lunch menu, portions were large. Upscale casual with lots of tv sports and big bar."
Amanda W.,"La Grange, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Only giving one star because I have to. Waited 30 minutes extra even though we made a reservation. Missing drinks and they all came out at different times. Asked if appetizers would actually come out before the meals and was told yes, they didn't come out till after our meals. Waitress seemed to be a mess and always forgot a beer here, a drink refill there or someone's food. Horrible experience all together. Steak was dry and tough. Shrimp did not come with meal, when we asked the waitress she said it wasn't even ordered. The whole experience was truly awful. Would never come back or recommended to anyone. Don't waste your money here."
A. S.,"Gibsonton, FL",1,29,21,2.0,12/15/2016,"Our take out order did not come with the right toppings or sides. The burgers were suuuuper greasy. It came out with no napkins, plasticware or condiments. I have only tried the burgers. Based on this order I would not recommend it to anyone and I will not be back."
Linda V.,"Seminole, FL",12,68,,1.0,1/14/2017,"I tried this place for the last time, even with the new gift card you gave to us, to make it right. Sorry Please do not send me anymore. Your chef still can not make this right. When you first opened up this establishment it was very very good. I loved it came here 2 times a week but for some reason it went down hill. You can not do much for salads but for some reason the avocado egg rolls were really bad. The quality of your food is still not up to par, not for the amount of money we have to pay. I did have however a nice crisp beer that I paid for, and a side dish that cost me an additional 10.00. which is ok, I did not mind to pay extra, there is not much you can buy for 20.00 bucks. Sorry we will not be back. My friends love it but you see there is not much you can do with iceburg lettuce and some salad dressing. My husband had the taco's which was skimpy little there was 3  pieces of chicken for 7.95 I think and mine was the avocado egg rolls for 9.95 they used to be much cheaper.. sorry but we will not be back not for the moon over the mountains. I am giving you one star for the worse food in Pinellas Park.  Bring back the original quality and then I may be back but for some reason you lost the original chef or you are starting to buy inferior products or products from GFS Foods, which is lousy to, me. Please Noah do not try to bribe me with another one of the free dinners to make it right it can never be right. I tried this 2 times for some reason your quality in your food has changed its not a SYSCO Products anymore what did you do to change this to a cheaper less quality products?"
Andrea K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",94,18,50,1.0,5/18/2017,My family ordered a Togo order a little before 8pm for Mothers day. I went to pick it up around 830pm & the order still wasn't ready. I didn't leave with my order until 9pm. I would have much rather spent that time waiting at home then sit there for 30 extra mins. I know mothers day gets busy. But even when I went to check the order off to the side all the items weren't there. I tipped the guy $10 and u would think after getting a nice tip and making me wait an extra 30 mins that he would at least make sure all my stuff was in the bag.. very disappointing..
Amy J.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,22,16,5.0,7/26/2017,"We came to BJ's this evening to watch the US soccer game and have drinks and apps in the bar. The game started at 9:30pm and we arrived at BJ's at 9:45pm. The late night happy hour starts at 10pm and our waitress Angel was more than happy to get us waters and a taste of one of the beers while we waited for happy hour pricing. By the time we got our water, tasted our beer, and looked over the menu, it was 10pm. Apps and personal sized deep dish pizzas are half off during happy hour. The appetizers you can choose from span two pages in the menu and you have plenty to choose from. We ordered a 4 meat deep dish personal pizza, asparagus with garlic sauce, and brussels sprouts to start. All were very good. We ordered a salted caramel pizooki for dessert. Delicious! With a tax and a 20%+ tip on the pre-discounted bill, our total came to $24. I should mention that our pizooki was free because we had rewards to redeem. Also of note, it's a Wednesday evening and the restaurant and kitchen are open until midnight."
Kat M.,"St. Petersburg, FL",253,302,2395,3.0,11/29/2015,"Not sure how to give a good rating. Ok, so I've come here a lot with my husband and I do love their beer selection. I've also had the chert glazed salmon and I can't remember if it's quinoa or couscous. But that is my fav item on the menu. They have delicious flat breads also. But the salad I ordered wasn't what I expected. I had the Santa Fe Salad. It's pretty much the same that Applebee's has only they have corn & avocado in theirs. The dressing is a Santa Fe ranch and it's good. But, I was iffy on the chicken. Nothing wrong with the way it was cooked or anything.....I'm going to sound weird, but the way it was cut I suppose it looked odd shaped. If it had been cut into strips I think it'd be better. I ate about half the salad and still didn't satisfy my hunger. I'm not one to send food back, unless it's steak and it's over cooked. This review is based on this dish. I know they do have other amazing food on their menu. However I will say this, the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts is a new fav! Grilled and blacked a bit seasoned with creamy Sriracha sauce. No hint of honey, but it was the perfect sauce to drizzle over these babies. I do love them! Give them a try! Also try the Avocado Egg Rolls, their clam chowder, and any of their flat breads!"
Jahaira B.,"Scarborough, Canada",51,277,1707,3.0,1/27/2015,"Avocado eggrolls. Didnt taste good. Was actually a spring roll. The cherry chipotle salmon with quinoa was good. I would recommend it. The pizookie was ""off the chain"".  The  Ghirardelli was the most intense chocolate ice cream I have ever had in my life. Best ever. Go there even just for that."
Christopher S.,"Dunedin, FL",219,518,839,4.0,1/1/2016,"I had to kill a couple of hours as my new car was being serviced so I had the Crown Courtesy Car drop me at Park This is the first time in a few years since I at a BJ's in Citrus Park. Barbacoa Chicken dinner, at 540 Calories. No dull black beans & rice here, chicken tender juicy cooked perfectly! Sat at the bar, Celeste was very informative. Menu extensive with an explanation of beer types (from pale ales to stout) and suggested food pairings. Thin crust personal to full blown crust pizzas that will fill a family!   This is just the tip of the iceburg. Suffice to say, I will be returning to fully explore the menus, food and Crafts! :-)"
Crystal H.,"St Petersburg, FL",435,435,1503,4.0,9/1/2014,"I have been a regular at BJ's for years now. We often find ourselves here because they are open late and way better than the other options in this plaza. I think part of the reason why I have not reviewed them yet despite my dozens(+) of times dining here is because the service and the food was really mixed in the beginning of our relationship. Now that BJ's and myself are old friends, I know where to sit, how to order and what to do if my order is bad. So, this review is going to be tip filled.  -Sit in the bar area if possible. The costumer service is SO much better in the bar area than in the dining room from my experience. You seat yourselves at whichever table you want and you are right in front of numerous TV's. Win-Win.  -If you are a beer snob (like me), skip their beer or order a known brand on tap. Yes, they are technically a brewhouse. However, they are more of a restaurant. The beer is okay, but not worth ordering in my snobby opinion. Note: If you are a Bud Light or Corona or {insert common beer brand} fan...order away.  -If your food is bad, ask for it to be remade or taken off your bill. Most of their food is good. However, I have had food come out wrong, be burnt or just awful. Recently I tried a new starter salad. It was supposed to have spinach, tomatoes, bleu cheese, bacon, hard boiled egg and vinaigrette. What I received was spinach and bleu cheese with almost no dressing. I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. I asked to have it removed from my receipt and they did. The rest of my meal was fantastic.  -Join the BJ's Rewards program:    It is free to join and you earn points towards gift cards/coupons/etc. to use on future visits. You will also be emailed coupons for free appetizers, Pizookies, etc.  -Save room for a Pizookie. A Pizookie is basically one of the best cookies that you will ever have in your life baked just for you to order. Then, it is topped with ice cream. Soooo good. Tip: You can order a half and half Pizookie and get two different flavors!  Other tips: -You can ORDER ONLINE for dine-in, pick-up inside or pick-up curbside -They have light options on their menu and they are good about substituting or excluding items if you prefer it. You can definitely eat here on a diet if you have the willpower to avoid the Pizookie. :)  Follow my tips and you are sure to have a pleasant dining experience at BJ's. Some of my favorite dishes on the menu are the BJ's Brewhouse Burger with Applewood Smoked Bacon and Cheese, BJ's Cobb Salad, Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad, Southern Fried Chicken, Fresh Atlantic Salmon, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Tuscan Chicken Limone and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. Enjoy!"
Malary J.,"Westminster, CO",390,407,1301,5.0,12/6/2015,"My husband and I love coming here. We're not big fans of chain restaurants especially with all of the options we have around us but we love BJs Brewhouse. We have been here tons of times and never had a bad experience here! We love beer and love the beer that is brewed by BJs along with the other selections they have! Love the happy hour deals if you sit at the bar! Yummy appetizer bites for $4!  My favorite is the chicken tortilla soup! Depending on who has made it that night, sometimes it's really Spicy and I love it!!! Everything is good. The pizzas, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, and pizookie deserts are all delicious! You won't be disappointed, this place is awesome!"
