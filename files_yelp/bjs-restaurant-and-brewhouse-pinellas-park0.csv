Martie P.,"St Petersburg, FL",116,97,20,4.0,11/23/2013,"I recently stopped at BJ's for lunch.  It was during the work week, so I didn't try any of their brews.  However, I did try their homemade black cherry soda, sweetened with beet juice.  It was delicious.  They have a few other homemade flavors, including orangecicle and cream soda, in addition to some of the ordinary coke (or pepsi...can't remember which) products.  The service was great; our server (can't remember his name) had such personality.  I tried the veggie flat bread lunch special.  It was wonderfully seasoned.  The crust was the perfect thickness and crispiness.  Chicago style pies.  Guess I'll give that a try next time!"
Darla A.,"St Petersburg, FL",1,9,9,4.0,12/8/2012,"Great place to eat. Very casual and the atmosphere is great too. I love that this place is a micro-brewery and has seasonal beers you can sample. I'm quite a beer fan, and this place knows how to make some pretty good beer.  I've been here many, many times and they have a large selection on there menu. I try to eat something new every time I go here and so far, I haven't had a bad experience.   These are some of the things I ordered which I have found to be pretty good- Clam Chowder Soup  California Chicken Sandwich Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich Crispy Jalapeno Burger California Burger  Fish Tacos The flatbread pizzas are good! Things I ordered which I would NOT order again- Sweet Pig Pizza (very dry, lacking sauce and needs more cheese toppings) Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad Angel Hair Toscana (very bland, taste like you are eating just a plain bowl of noodles, not enough sauce in this dish) Chicken A La Fresca (nothing special)"
Aron T.,"St. Petersburg, FL",124,11,5,1.0,4/7/2013,4th time in a row that I've been here and my order has been messed up. How do you make any money giving meals away for free? Last time I'll be here.
Jeanette A.,"Tampa, FL",101,109,9,4.0,12/22/2013,"Good food &great beer is what BJ's is all about ! This is the perfect spot for after works drinks  and to watch a game! Prices are fair, and ambiance is business casual; this place never disappoints."
Nora Brie J.,"Tampa, FL",5,12,,1.0,3/10/2013,"We went here for dinner, Saturday night - we expected it to be busy. After a seating mixup where another family took our table it took a while to get a drinks order in. I specifically told the waitress I was allergic to tomatoes and requested my food without. It came with anyway and took at least 45 minutes to get a new one. We were told the manager was aware and would provide us a free dessert, but neither materialized. After the second entree was brought we didn't see the waitress again for at least 30 minutes. Our glasses were empty and we were finished. She never even came back to see if we wanted dessert at all. Providing a coupon added another 10 minutes to our checkout experience. The food was just ok."
Taleena B.,"Largo, FL",1,8,5,5.0,5/29/2015,My husband and I came here on our first date and we have been coming back ever since. We recommend servers Chris or Sarah as both of them at different times have waited on us greatly. During the busiest nights they have both shown professionalism and promptness. I'm highly impressed. When you go ask for them.
Paul W.,"Marine Park, Brooklyn, NY",2,39,21,4.0,12/19/2013,"We were warmly greeted when we arrived. We did not have to wait long for a table at all. Once inside, we had great service, very good food, and the price was very reasonable. Very enjoyable."
Chad U.,"St Petersburg, FL",40,161,,4.0,1/6/2013,"BJ's is like an upscale sports bar that brews their own brands of several types of draft beer. The dinning area is pretty much one large room where you can watch the large TV screens from pretty much any seat in the house. The food is not typical bar food. The flat bread pizza's are unique and solid. The Nutty Brewnette is a tasty draft ale. And I'd recommend capping your meal off with a pizookie for your kid (and yourself!). I've been there about 10 times and don't ever recall having a terrible service experience. Nothing extraordinary but nothing so bad that I never wanted to come back.  I want to give this place 5 stars but the reality is that I stay away from it because of the crowd. It's located in a shopping mall that has a 20+ movie theater across the parking lot. Because of the varying movie times, it feels like it's ALWAYS crowded there. They have plenty of seating but the demand is so high, I think the area could support another one easy. The parking lot is small, so if you're going during peek hours, I'd recommend not even bothering with the lot around the building. Just park in the shopping mall lot and walk over to save yourself the hassle. Another tip that I'm reluctant to share.. there's plenty of ""in the bar"" seating and it's comfortable too. Keep an eye out for someone leaving a hop on that table!  Yes, it's a chain but they have a good business model. Don't be a snob go there and slurp down a brew!"
Michael A.,"Carver, MA",81,269,275,4.0,10/1/2013,Great place to have lunch on a weekday. The menu is very cool
Teresa T.,"Clearwater, FL",20,29,47,4.0,10/5/2011,"They are secretly keeping that they have the most awesome deep dish pizza!!!!  I haven't had pizza this good for years!!!!!  I like their top shelf margarita.  Drinks, including beer is high priced tho.  You can order food online for carryout which is an added plus."
Lisa P.,"St. Petersburg, FL",18,20,,3.0,2/21/2014,"Pretty good, food is very good, the wait for a table was extraordinarily long. Really enjoyed the chicken pot stickers."
Katie M.,"Pinellas Park, FL",4,26,2,5.0,2/5/2013,LOVE THIS PLACE! food and service is always consistent. their root beer and salads are absolutely amazing.
Just M E.,"Oxford, FL",34,132,,4.0,12/18/2010,"Service, ambiance, and most importantly, food hits the mark at this place.  In addition to a standard full bar of liquors, there's a great selection of craft brews. Someone mentioned that the beers aren't brewed on premises.  Perhaps the person making that comment had their ""authentic"" experience diminished, but for me it's a big ""so what?""  The Porter Ale didn't taste less good because it was trucked in.  Oh, and they have beer flights; which I'm looking forward to trying on my next visit.   Over several visits we've had pot roast sandwiches, pan pizza, burgers, cajun chicken and various pastas.    All have been good, but the biggest surprise has been the pizza.   We're from Chicago, so being pizza snobs is in our DNA.  I didn't believe there was any such thing as bad pizza until I moved.  There are differences between regular crust, thin, ultra-thin, pan, deep dish, and stuffed, and BJs gets the pan part right.  Not too doughy-cheesy-saucy, and a good distribution of ingredients, all perfectly cooked.  If anything, they cold use just a hint more sauce, but overall, this is good pan. Booths are comfortable, tables are well-spaced, and the ambiance is sorta ""upscale casual"".  (Comparisons to Cheesecake Factory decor are spot-on) While we both prefer independent ""hole-in-the-wall"" kind of places, we don't hate chain restaurants.  Most chains started as independents and achieved their status because they knew their shit and did it well.   So, here's to you BJ's.  Chain or not, keep doing what you do!"
Renee M.,"Tampa, FL",48,87,23,3.0,3/2/2013,"I have been to this BJ's location many times over the years. If you visit at a peak time, especially a Friday night, be prepared to wait! They do not take reservations, but they do call ahead - so keep that in mind if you are coming with a group. I believe you can grab a table in the bar area with no wait - so keep your eye out for any openings there. Service can be hit or miss. We have had some really great servers, but others try to rush you because they want to turnover your table as fast as they can.  BJ's has great pizza. I usually stick with the mini deep dish pizza. They also offer a new hand tossed crust, flatbreads, and gluten free pizza,They have a huge variety of non-pizza items on the menu and they are all just ""ok."" I am a firm believer that when you have too much of a variety on a menu, nothing is that great. That's the problem with BJ's menu- It can be overwhelming because it's too big. You can get everything from meatloaf, to pasta, to fish and burgers, and a lot in between. They do have great desserts! They are known for the Pizookie which is an individual fresh baked dessert, like a chocolate chip cookie or brownie, topped with ice cream. Keep in mind that they have a trio for around $9.99 - you can get 3 mini Pizookies which are great for sharing! The regular size can feed 2.  BJ's is also known for their beers and you can get flights to try."
Casey C.,"Seminole, FL",1,84,5,4.0,4/18/2013,Great beers and I love that they have appetizers as low as $3.00!  I am not a fan of their pizza but all other items were good.
Teresa H.,"Clearwater, FL",9,47,7,2.0,3/18/2013,"Just OK.  The food is nothing spectacular.  We had calamari for an appetizer - it was a little bland and soggy.  i then had the parmesean crusted chicken again a bit bland, the sauce on top was tasty but there may have been 2 tsp of it.  The service was slow, and I don't think I should have to ask the server to bring silverware especially since the place wasn't busy."
michael s.,"St Petersburg, FL",63,527,844,4.0,11/15/2010,"Brewhouse and Brewery are different. ALthough BJ's has their own line of beer, it's brewed in Texas, not here. The two giant vats one sees from the dining area are actually for their 'home-made' root beer. Alas, they were out of it on my visit. Too bad because I would have loved to try a homey root beer. Alison, the bartender, was very informative and attentive. She said that their most popular dish there was the deep-pan pizza. I liked the look of the fish tacos and salads which came past. Pretty crowded on a Sunday night and parking is at a premium."
Dani S.,"St Petersburg, FL",2,6,,1.0,8/19/2011,"I've only heard wonderful things about BJ's, after our evening there I doubt I'll be going back. We made reservations for 7 people and when we arrived at our scheduled time we had to wait another half our for a table while groups of people who walked in were seated before us. Our server arrived 10-15 minutes after we were seated took our drink orders (water) and vanished for almost 20 minutes before coming back to take an appetizer order. The appetizers came out quicker than our water did and they were delicious, the best part of the evening actually.  Our waiter goes MIA once again before coming back to refill our empty glasses and take our orders. Orders are placed and we end up waiting for an hour before anyone comes back to our table. They couldn't find one of the orders that belonged to our table so they had to remake for us on the spot (which would take another 30 minutes) and held everyone else's food until the pizza was done. When it all came out everyone who didn't order a salad had to eat cold, under-a-heat-lamp-for-over-an-hour- food. No one touched their meals except for the one who ordered the pizza.  The manager came by and comped us for our dinners without us ever having to complain about it and apologized for the long wait. We did appreciate the effort they made to right a wrong but I do doubt we'll be going back. In the end we were stuck at the restaurant for over 3 hours."
Jason R.,"Tampa, FL",34,21,2,4.0,8/8/2012,"If getting to go food, hope for Renee at the bar. Fast service, very nice. Food was good as always. She stepped it up and got it out fast.  Great service, great Gluten Free options (even Pizza!) and the place was great as always."
