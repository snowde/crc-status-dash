Marina R.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",71,3,1,4.0,4/16/2016,"My friend and I stopped in for lunch because we were STARVING. We sat in the bar and it did take quite sometime for someone to even great us, let alone bring us menus, which really turned me off and almost made me walk out. BUT Jenna made everything better. Super sweet, great suggestions and overall really friendly! We both got the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad and its was probably my favorite salad I've ever had. Definitely will be back!"
Ally S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",112,134,86,4.0,2/9/2015,"Jeff, our server, tonight was AWESOME!!! He came to check every 10-15 minutes. chicken wings are alright. He was sweet and always smiling. =)"
Lucy P.,"St. Petersburg, FL",9,56,44,1.0,12/22/2015,The food here isnt worth the price. My burger was gross as shit. Sent it back they literally just scraped the cheese off and gave it back to me after putting the wrong cheese in the first fucking place then give it back half the shit still on there. Dude walks it out all official and shit. I took one bite out of awkwardness as he lurked by the table but I spit it back on the plate. My server was on point though my meal was comped or something. She felt bad and even was like wow at how the burger shit went down. Kinda hard to fuck up a pizzookie so that was pretty good.
Debra H.,"Clearwater, FL",0,15,16,5.0,5/5/2016,"We sat at the bar on a football Sunday. We had the pleasure of being cared for by the bartender Wesley. Wow!!!  All restaurants/bars should hope to have a 'Wesley' in their employ. He's a dynamo!!! Yes, food and drink are great, but we will return for the Wesley Factor!!!"
Nikki A.,"Atlanta, GA",117,203,536,4.0,9/2/2013,"I love this place. They have a pretty solid beer selection. I am a big fan of the LightSwitch. They also have some yummy cocktails, my favorite is the Skinny Margarita. It is a little pricey, but worth it. The wait staff is hit or miss; I have had super friendly service and folks that just seemed bothered to be there. My favorite salad is the Honey Crisp, and we always seem to get the Bacon Cheeseburger pizza which is delightful. (Pickles on a pie? All day for this gal.) You must sit in the bar area if you want a good view of the sports, and also if you want to partake in any happy hour deals. I love going to the movies and then heading to BJ's to discuss the flick, over drinks and pizza. My husband and pregnant friends are lovers of the Pizookie: a just baked cookie dessert."
B K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",3,38,18,4.0,11/22/2014,"Been to this BJs many many times and I've only had one bad experience and that was only because the bartender didn't have a clue how to tend bar.  I've sat at the bar, in the bar area and dining room.  I really haven't found that sitting in one area is better than any another area.  Though you can sit yourself at the tables by the bar, but most people know this, so on busy nights people are scouting them out pretty aggressively. I believe BJs has the best blue cheese dressing ever made, pair it with a wedge salad and save some to dip your pizza in and you'll be a happy person.  Their clam chowder is really good served in a sour dough bowl, and their avocado egg rolls are really good, but not a big fan of the sweet syrup they serve with it, so get some blue cheese dressing.  The Root Beer is brewed in house and is served in a frosty mug, pretty good stuff, but you only get one refill.  All of their ""house beers"" are brewed off site, they're pretty good, but nothing to get to excited about. Not a big fan of their pasta dishes, they aren't bad, but are kind of bland.  The meatloaf is pretty good too, but if you get the meatloaf try to order it on a busy night, or you might get a dry piece leftover from the night before.  For lunch the French dip and wedge salad has never disappointed. The deep dish pizzas are really good, we order them to go a lot, and have found that turning on the oven to 325 before we leave to pick it up helps a lot.  When we get home we throw the pizza in the oven for 10-15 minutes and it's nice and hot.  Also I have found that when ordering something to go, always add 10 minutes to the time they say it will be ready."
Ryan S.,"Pensacola, FL",0,63,1,4.0,3/7/2016,Came here after church and was sat right away (around 12:30pm.) I had the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos with a side of steamed broccoli. They were as good as you can get from a chain restaurant that isn't Greek.  I also tried their sriracha chicken mac n cheese and was amazed.  It wasn't hot at all but the sriracha gave it that extra flair. Ordered their cookie a la mode dessert trio too. Leave the other cookie flavors alone and just get the salted caramel cookie with vanilla ice cream (I cannot remember he name of it.) You will NOT be disappointed.
Scott H.,"Clearwater, FL",129,187,230,3.0,1/18/2014,"I always enjoy going to BJ's the place has an open and casual feel with a touch of sophistication.  This particular location has something you do not see much anymore: a revolving door as an entrance.  Even though this place has that open feel you have different themes as the bar area is large but with its large TV screens has a sports bar atmosphere and the dining area is removed enough not to be infringed by the bar.  The seating is abundant with different varieties of booths and tables, allowing for two through eight to sit comfortably without pushing tables together. We went to BJ's for a team lunch for about eight people and sat in a round booth that was very comfortable.  The only odd situation was that there was a point where food and drinks had to be handed over because of the size of the table.  Most people ordered the unlimited soup and salad and the server made sure she asked everyone if they wanted it split between appetizer and entrée.  I enjoyed a cup of clam chowder, tomato bisque, and a house salad.  The beauty of their unlimited is that you can switch off soup items.  Both the soups came out hot and the salad very fresh and crisp. Considering the size of the group and we only had one server I did not notice any delays or perceived dissatisfaction.  Everyone enjoyed! Definitely an A-OK place and a recommend!"
Thomas A.,"Gulfport, FL",218,431,115,5.0,12/16/2013,"Food, drink, service...this place has it all. I literally can't think of a negative factor. So five stars it is. I admit, though, the Cheesecake Factory style ""yellow pages menu"" did induce a groan or two.  The highlight of the visit was the deep dish pizza. This is one of VERY FEW places in St Pete that offers a deep dish option and it is a home run. Light, flaky deep dish crust and top quality cheese and toppings make all the difference. The pizza was so good, I'd probably give this place five stars just for that factor. Also, the service was stellar...unheard of for Pinellas Park."
Eric C.,"Wake Forest, NC",177,460,409,4.0,8/2/2013,"I love the beer at this place...the happy hour rocks!! Went back several more times and tried the chili in a bread bowl (sourdough, my favs)...it's filled to the top and it's even better if you ask for jalapenos and extra cheese on top.  Mixed with a pint of one of the spectacular world-class beers and you've got a meal!!!"
John L.,"St. Petersburg, FL",219,279,16,3.0,1/3/2015,"I have to agree with the reviews. Nice place but the food is nothing special; just average. Ordered pizza one time and it seemed frozen and lacking taste. Today I ordered a burger and it was just ok. Charbroiled, which I like, but over cooked; I ordered medium rare and it came out well. Service was very good. Ambience is nice. Very spread out place with a decent amount of flat screens. The bathrooms are probably the best part of this experience. They were very clean and kind of fancy!  But don't worry - they don't have the annoying bathroom attendants.  They do have a great selection of good beer. If you want to drink in a nice place, come here. If you want to eat, save your money and find somewhere else."
Jenilee A.,"Largo, FL",58,50,169,1.0,9/18/2015,"The appetizer we ordered (spinach with tortillas) came out golden brown on top yet was disgustingly cold in the middle. Tortillas were inedible due to the amount of salt and grease caked onto them. So that was sent back. Moving onto our entrees. We both ordered the double deluxe. When it came out it looked absolutely amazing. My appetite had since returned in full force ready to gorge this delicious burger. However, delicious was not the case. The two patties were obviously frozen and drowning in grease. The thin crispy French fries were cold and tasted like the freezer. That was the only day I ever passed up French fries. My SO was willing to try another bite of his burger until he got a large bite of grizzle. At that point we had given enough second chances. I  had to call the manager over and leave. I  do not recommend this restaurant nor do I ever think I will have a appetite large enough to return and try again.  On a positive note the manager was extremely understanding."
Matt C.,"Riverview, FL",12,14,3,3.0,3/13/2016,"The food this time was great. The service, not the same.  It took three attempts for them to bring us a child high chair that was not missing the restraint straps. The server was not knowledgable at all as to gluten intolerant customers. As this is a restaurant that has many specialty gluten free items, the servers should know about this and all other food allergies."
Allen D.,"Atlanta, GA",5,19,9,2.0,5/6/2015,"Crusted Chicken was great, steak was good, vegetables were vegetables but the one thing that sticks out is the filthy men's bathroom, is the kitchen also kept up like this?! Two stars because the food was average/above average but no good on the bathroom folks!"
Tyson D.,"Clearwater, FL",0,2,,5.0,4/1/2016,"For a chain restaurant this place can NOT be beat.  I have been to BJ's at least 200 times in the past 5 years.  I have had one experience where the food was just 'ok'.  Consistently delicious, overly ample portions, and a value served by competent and convivial wait staff.  I'm super serious this place rocks.  If you ever do have an issue of any kind just get a manager, they bend over backwards to exceed your expectations.  Join the rewards program."
Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1322,988,1475,4.0,5/4/2013,"I always enjoy BJs.  This one is no exception. I cannot believe that it was a 40 minutes wait at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday and that it actually took that long.  They were nice enough to bring around bits of pizza for people waiting.  Honestly, I think it was just that time, because by the time we were seated there was not a lot of people left waiting. Our waitress was spectacular.  We said we were in a hurry and she got us in and out of there in a little over half an hour.   I got the Thai mango chicken salad under their Enlightened menu.  I like that they have an Enlightened menu, so you know that what you're eating is relatively healthy.  It actually worries me then about how unhealthy the rest of the menu is!  The salad had a good amount of chicken and avocado.  It was pretty good, but I would probably try something different next time. My fiance got the Chicken Marsala.  The chicken is really tender.  He really enjoyed it, but he didn't think the green beans really added anything. This really is one of my favorite chains.  However, you really should call ahead before dinner on a Friday night!  They recommend calling when you leave home and then you'll be added to the wait list right away!"
Sabella S.,"St Petersburg, FL",0,1,,1.0,8/9/2016,"Horrible customer service. Asked to place a take out order and they put me on hold for 10 minutes! And as soon as I finally get to talk to someone he puts me on hold again to ""grab a towel"". I would pass if you want to place a take out order. They clearly don't have their stuff together."
Alexander K.,"Rockville, MD",65,226,749,3.0,9/7/2013,"We arrived here for a early dinner due to the proximity of location.  I ordered the scampi pasta with shrimp. It was accompanied by toasted garlic bread and topped with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. The plate came out very hot and the angel hair pasta was not overcooked which is one of my greatest pet peeves when it comes to pasta. The dish itself was not overly dressed with the sauce and I respected that. I do realize that this is a massive chain restaurant, but I was disappointed to see the shrimp that came with it were of the quarter-sized frozen variety. I mean, we are in Florida after all.  I also had the orange twist drink which was decent; I normally don't drink soda or soda cocktails but it wasn't too overpowering with the carbonation or the sweetness. The other members of our party ordered parmesan crusted chicken, new orleans jambalaya, and chicken tenders. Everyone seemed to be somewhat pleased with their dishes.  So I'll give this location a solid 3 stars. Nothing spectacular, but nothing spectacularly bad."
Marcus M.,"Pinellas Park, FL",1,3,,2.0,8/14/2015,"First off our waiter, I forgot his name. Well just call him Sassafrass. His service subpar for a lack of better term waiter was very slow and seemed to have a attitude, drinks were constantly empty ordered food took over 50 minutes to get it and it was no better then a dollar menu at McDonald's probably won't be coming back. And I asked them to sing my nanny happy birthday.... And nothing that absolutely upset me the most. She passed the next day."
Julie L.,"St. Petersburg, FL",19,4,36,1.0,8/2/2016,"I was just at BJ 10 mins ago! Wait how many stars is this restaurant? At least 3. But the service sound like a very low class restaurant, i had a black server and he came out serve my table with a attitude he made me feel really uncomfortable And i feel like he racist! Take him 10mins to come and ask us what we wanna drink, take him 10mins to bring a water and a ice tea! After that he ask us if we are ready to go head and order, are u kidding me it been 20mins i have been looking at the menu! So he took our order with no pen or the food order note he just gonna memorize our orders! Ok, 20mins later come out ask me what kind of salad did i want again, and bring out my main dish wrong! After that he said well i thought you said boneless chicken! I never eat boneless chicken in my life! And he even told me if i want to change the order it gonna be a while! What kind of service is this? You bring me the wrong food and you told me to wait another 20mins, when the couple who walked in after me got serve before me when they left about 5mins that is when i have my food on the table! I come to bj for the longest time and this is the first time i got serve like that, horrible!"
