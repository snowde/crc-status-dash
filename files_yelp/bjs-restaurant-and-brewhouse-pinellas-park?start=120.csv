Aaron A.,"Granite City, IL",122,160,,3.0,11/9/2015,"This was an ok sports bar and grill that my girlfriend and I tried out on vacation. It was good but didn't really set itself apart. Decent beer selection. I got a gyro that, while pretty tasty, fell apart as soon as I picked it up and left a tzatziki puddle all over my plate. Like I said, good, but no real defining quality to set them apart."
Laura W.,"Orlando, FL",21,122,,3.0,2/13/2016,"I can recommend BJ's for families or friends to visit together. There is a huge menu with options that will allow everyone to find something. The inside is nice-looking.  Now to the food. I ordered the portobello mushroom hot sandwich with thin fries. You can get it with or without a meat patty (strangely, the price is the same either way). The mushroom burger was very good, and included a grilled bun, swiss cheese, pesto, and a sauce similar to mayo. My friend got the pepperoni flatbread pizza, which was a thin crust with lots of pepperoni. We both ate/enjoyed all of our entries.  We also tried the BJ's-made beers. My friend ordered a flight of 4 different beers and I ordered a German-style beer. I have to say that the beer I tried was watery and not one I could recommend. My friend was ok with her flight of beers, but again no superlatives. While BJ's makes their own beers and is very proud of their offerings, I may order a different brand next time I go to BJ's. For $5.99 a pint (which seems high for a non-speciality brand), I can do much better with a national/international brand. There were no beer specials mentioned by the server. As information, my beer and sandwich came to around $20 with tax. The service was okay. Our waitress must have been taking a break or been called away, as someone else delivered the food and a supervisory employee checked on us to see if the food was okay. We were more than ready for the bill by the time we saw our waitress again. No refills on water or questions about how we liked our beers. Perhaps the table should have been handed over to a different server while the waitress was away? My recommendation would be to mark the menu for speciality diets - gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, etc. I have been to this BJ's twice before or after a movie at the nearby theatre. There is plenty of easy parking nearby and something for everyone. I think it and Chipotle's are the best food options in this Pinellas Park shopping center. This restaurant has recently had a good inspection. Florida does not require that health inspections be posted in the restaurant for the public, so you have to go to the web site, below:"
Stephanie W.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",3,5,,1.0,2/7/2016,If there was a way to give a negative review it would be a negative rating!  Appetizer came out cold!  Entree came out cold!  Mojito had barely any alcohol.  The server was poop!
Anthony D.,"Pinellas Park, FL",8,32,4,4.0,2/6/2016,"Great beer, food is ok I only like to come here for the beer food just taste like chilies and apples bees & cheddars  to me. it's just heavy food/sodium so I can't drink anymore of there good beer they have lol."
Raaj T.,"Lexington, KY",60,9,,4.0,12/24/2015,Good food. Great beer. We had a couple of appetizers and a flight of 4 house draft beers.
Vylunda K.,"Hershey, PA",10,5,,5.0,11/13/2015,"I don't usually rate places but I just recently moved to Flordia and everywhere I went here when I visit and since now I'm staying here, this is the far best place I been here. Good is delicious. Server was very professional and knowledgable. Drinks was amazing. So I ordered a the cherry glaze salmon for lunch and a watermelon basil margarita. I had my sauce on the side because I'm not a big fan of the sound of the glazed and I also asked for the lemon champagne glazed on the side and that sauce was so much better on my salmon. My boyfriend order an ahi tuna salad and that was also amazingly cooked! Over all everything was great! I would definitely come back and recommend some family I have down here also our server was named Danny I think"
Denice M G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,5,,2.0,2/11/2016,"Had lunch there this afternoon, the ad in the Sunday paper looked amazing...salmon quinoa bowl, don't be fooled. The salmon was so dry and I could count the vegetables. I told the server and she was so unfazed, then I asked for Italian dressing to add moisture. PS, my server was, well enough said. I have never done a negative review before, but I'm so tired of poor food and mediocre service. There are some Great Restaurants in St. Pete with wonderful food and 5 Star service, this is just not one of them!!!!"
Lexie G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1,3,5,5.0,6/23/2015,"Delicious! I love the parmesan crusted chicken, I get the same thing every time and the white cheddar mashed potatoes are so good! Also the fish tacos are delicious coming from a non seafood eater! The staff is always friendly, the only dish I didn't enjoy was the potato skins, too big and a little dry. Santa Fe spring rolls are always a favorite the dipping sauces that come with I could dip any and everything in them!"
Nina M.,"Pinellas Park, FL",80,418,261,4.0,4/19/2014,"I've always like this place. You can't go wrong with their selections of craft beer, deep dish pizzas, and the pizookie.  With that being said, they do those items VERY well, however, their menu in other areas is something I haven't explored, so I'll leave it to my fellow Yelpers to comment on them.  The place can get busy most nights aside from the middle of the week so I advise you to call ahead."
Diane H.,"St Petersburg, FL",45,378,214,5.0,9/20/2012,"My third time here.  The menu would take years to get through, it's huge. Great drinks, great food, great atmosphere."
Jennifer G.,"Clearwater, FL",0,242,93,5.0,4/24/2016,This is our favorite BJs location. It's always busy but service is quick and precise. The food is cooked fresh and as ordered. The restaurant is also kept clean. This is a great place for kids too! My kids love the homemade root beer. I love it too but it just has too much sugar for me. I'm hoping one day they'll make a diet version. That would be awesome! That root beer can't be beat. The pizza is deep dish and so delicious. I also love the Parmesan crusted chicken. We have tried almost everything and never had something we did not like. Please bring back the meatloaf sandwich!
Leslie S.,"Largo, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/22/2016,"Lets say that we sat down with no waiting but when seated waited for 5 mintues and still no service . But what gets me is that people who just walk in the door ,sit and they get service ... and to me it doesn't matter if its a two top or fifthteen top , at least have the balls to come over and say i will be right with you"
Matthew D.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,12,1,1.0,11/29/2015,"Went in for dinner after seeing a movie and had an unpleasant experience. When we arrived the hostess was at the front desk on her cell phone, at which point we had to tap on the counter to get her attention. It was then obvious that we were being ignored at our table, while the waitress stared at us from the hostess stand. We left after being seated for 5 minutes while all of the tables in our section were tended to multiple times. This is by no means a review of the food at this restaurant, since we were never even given the opportunity to order."
Nat W.,"Kapolei, HI",241,1882,1401,4.0,2/14/2012,I have been meaning to try this place for so long but never did till last night and what a nice surprise!! I  did not have a high expectation for this place for the fact it is a chain restaurant.   The parking lot was pretty full and there were a lot of people inside considering it was a Monday night.  Our waitress was attentive and the food was good too!  I like their menu has varieties....now they are offering Asian fusion!  I also like their mini appetizer...perfect size!  Does not fill you up like regular appetizers before your entire. The food came out pretty quick...probably like 5 minutes after ordering though the place was not slow.   Very reasonably priced menu!  I would definitely  like to go back there again :)
Ali C.,"St Petersburg, FL",251,490,41,3.0,2/3/2014,"One of the few full service restaurants my daughter actually eats at so we end up there on occasion, there is always a crowd and sometimes a wait.  It is a big place though so you are usually seated pretty quick.  The menu offers everything and anything you can think of including stuffed baked potatoes . . . think Cheesecake Factory as others have mentioned.  A few items I really like - avocado eggrolls, California Chicken Sandwich, BBQ Chicken Salad, Pazookie dessert.  Enjoy!"
Kristen B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",38,17,5,1.0,7/4/2015,Terrible service. I even asked for a manager and the manager had terrible service! Very disappointed...
Ed A.,"Clearwater, FL",57,75,67,2.0,7/3/2015,"What was that for $65? We sent back fish tacos that looked like they came out of a Gordon's box. Instead, we ordered the jalapeño burger. We are glad we did. It was amazing. Still, we don't feel like the situation was handled properly. Our food was served separately an the dinner was compromised. It is not just about the food. The experience is at least half of it. These things leave a lasting impression - and not a good one."
Stephanie G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",2,16,,2.0,7/19/2015,"I came here with a group of 6 people from work at lunch time. Our food took FOREVER. It took close to 40 minutes from the time we sat down til the time our entrees hit our table. Let's just say our hour lunch turned into closer to an hour and a half that day and no one ordered anything extra well done or anything. I guess the place was just not pushing food out of the kitchen the way it should've been that day. I ordered a salmon entree which was good, but getting a water refill and a to go box proved to be fairly difficult as it seemed that our server was preoccupied."
Michelle M.,"Tampa, FL",358,1149,1892,3.0,1/20/2012,"BJ's is better than a lot of chain restaurants, but it's still a chain restaurant.  The menu is huge and the food is good (good, not great).  I think the best things on the menu are the meatloaf sandwich and the pizza. The salads can be hit or miss depending or the freshness of the ingredients.  The restaurant does get very busy on the weekends, especially if a game is on. BJ's offers a nice sized bar, friendly waitresses, plenty of large screen tv's.  The food is reasonably priced, but the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  I was not too impressed with my martini.  A little too sweet, I didn't care for the aftertaste that the mixer left.  Would something more basic like a rum and coke next time or stick with beer."
Rígel J.,"Belleville, MI",35,36,10,4.0,5/22/2015,"Never been here before and was pleasantly surprised coming in at 12AM and still getting stellar service and tasty food that didn't feel like it was going to kill me. Great menu, nice atmosphere and open late. This is a great place to be."
