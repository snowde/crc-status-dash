Melissa R.,"St. Petersburg, FL",287,102,49,5.0,12/20/2014,Great place if you love craft beer and they have an awesome gluten free menu. I love their gluten free pizza and the berry burst cider. We come here pretty often and we love their point system. Would recommend to anyone!
Pamela C.,"Milton, MA",38,45,36,4.0,5/30/2015,This was another great yelp find. Had something for everyone. Large menu. plenty of space in the dining room so you didnt feel like you were on top of the next person. All of our meals were great and very reasonably priced.
Seth R.,"Dyer, IN",0,16,,2.0,1/31/2015,"Not awful.  In fact, I went here twice and the first time had some of the best ribs I've ever had.  The second time, I went with two people who got the ribs.  They were flat out terrible.  I had chicken alfredo and the chicken tasted like the bagged chicken you find in the refrigerated section at the grocery store.  That kind of chicken has a specific kind of taste and it is terrible tasting to me.  The service is also hit or miss.  Our first visit had a terribly unfriendly waitress, the second time the waiter was nice enough.  Wouldn't recommend after the complete 180 that they did to the ribs."
Marik R.,"Ventura, CA",0,24,,5.0,9/18/2015,"This was the first BJs brewhouse I've ever been to and it will always standout in my mind as the best.  Food is awesome!  We've had the flatbread pizza appetizers, burgers, deep dish pizza, salmon, Pizzookie...pretty much all of it at one point or another.  The thin and crispy fries are the bomb!  Their drafts are also great!  Personally I like Oasis Amber the most, the Hefewizen is also a great one to try!   My fav place to go on a night out!"
Liz H.,"Carmel, IN",12,39,11,3.0,6/11/2015,"Came in late around 10ish after seeing a movie at the theater in the same plaza. No problem being sat right away.  A bit loud, but that was probably because of the hockey game going on.  We ended up sharing 2 apps. The calamari.  Nice portion,  loved the sauce,  a little over cooked so they were a smidge rubbery. And the wings. We did half and half garlic parm and regular.  Those, unlike the calamari,  could have cooked a little longer.  They were nice sized wings which is great.  However a few with slightly pink and the skin was flabby and limp."
Emanuil I.,"Imperial, MO",6,4,4,2.0,1/10/2015,"All though our food was over all satisfactory if not a little above satisfaction compared to the service we had, absolutely outrageous. Our sweet tea was empty for at least 25 min. Three tables left and she greeted a 7 top. After we already had asked for the refill. From there out side dish the spinach mushrooms came out cold. The manager ran out a new one didn't really say anything other than sorry and here you are(implying giving our food). Then all the other things I could point out by just what I saw from the service other tables were getting. I'd deff advise sitting at the bar."
J C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,69,8,1.0,4/13/2016,"I like BJs but tonight I came in to watch the laker game (I called and made sure it was being shown, and they assured me it would be on for kobes farewell) and they almost didn't want to put it in tv for us. We asked if they would after the lighting game (respectfully) and then when that ended they told us they wouldn't put it on until after another game that was about to end an NO ONE WAS  WATCHING. We ended  up missing the Kobe tribute because of volume that they ""couldn't""turn up ( even though the  hockey game was loud and clear ) long story short, the ""manager"" screwed his server/bartender and we left. So disappointing especially since BJs was a favorite of ours in California. For the record our server was awesome, totally not his fault . He tried. A lot."
Eva P.,"Clearwater, FL",82,168,432,4.0,4/7/2015,This place had homemade beer and root beer. I had the root kind and it was good. Tasted like A&W but good. I had the avocado wrap app with the dipping sauce and the sauce made this dish! We also tried the calamari which was delicious and not overly greasy. The cream dipping sauce was very tasty. I had a custom sandwich- I did blackened mahi on bread like the Cali chicken club minus the bacon. They charged an additional $4.95 for the change. I also added BBQ sauce. The fries thin fries I didn't care for but the wedge fries where lightly seasoned and where fabulous. I want to try the Thai shrimp lettuce wrap next time.
Brittni L.,"St. Petersburg, FL",45,112,107,3.0,3/4/2015,It's overpriced for the quality of food. Service was poor you should never have to flag down you're server the entire meal but here you do. We both ordered the same meal we both sent it back twice. 1st under cooked. 2nd time over cooked. If you want to try BJ's go to the one in Countryside you would think they were two completely different restaurants. ..
Arthur S.,"Parrish, FL",12,74,31,3.0,9/23/2013,"Went here for lunch after spending the morning going from bank to bank trying to secure finances. I was greeted with a very nice hostess and was then passed off to another that insisted we had to have an application for their rewards program. Please don't push that stuff on me if I don't want it. My server was very nice and attentive. I ordered a Jeremiah Red Beer and it was a bit of a darker beer but very smooth with no bitter after taste. My meal consisted of the New Orleans Jambalaya. I honestly cannot make a true comparison with a Jambalaya from New Orleans, but this dish had a good taste, with plenty of shrimp and meats and had a nice spice to it that made it just hot enough for my tastes. The meal was plentiful and I left feeling satisfied. This restaurant would have received the fourth star if they did not try to force upon me the rewards program."
Michael H.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,24,1,4.0,7/29/2015,Great beer selection and the menu is pretty robust and I haven't had a bland meal yet from any order. The place is always packed so plan ahead.
Nina B.,"St Petersburg, FL",30,19,2,5.0,12/8/2014,"Yum yum yum! This place has good service and great food! I've haven't had a dish there that I don't like. And if I order the same thing on different visits, it's always delicious. So it's nice to know you're guaranteed a yummy meal! Their desserts are CRAZY GOOD! Sign up for their rewards program, you get points and $$ off your meals."
Stacy C.,"Bradenton, FL",257,99,281,3.0,9/15/2014,"The layout and decor of the restaurant certainly pull you in.  I had high expectations Immediately.  There is a warm feel with a casual touch of class however, one of my pet peeves is an establishments that has a well-planned and extensive drink menu and then fail to deliver a quality cocktail. I ordered a Long Island iced tea and it was so sour and acidic it made my face pucker.  I hardly ever send things back but at $9.50, I want to at least be able to get my drink down without gagging!  My sour puss expression was soon joined by a look of confusion when the bartender's second attempt returned nearly identical to the first. At this point my thinking turned to, ""If they don't get it by now, they aren't going to get it the third time"".   Onto another pet peeve.....dirty bathrooms.  Specifically toilet paper all over the floors and establishments that choose stainless steel fixtures and stalls and never clean them properly. The appearance of the bathroom stalls were so smeared and covered in splash marks it made me opt for the classic squat and try not to touch anything method. (Always a joy for a female with a purse)   I would rate the service as average and slow at times. The food was pretty darn good and that being so, I would be open to giving BJ's another shot at some point regardless of the negative points."
Melissa P.,"Clearwater, FL",1,3,2,5.0,11/8/2014,"My wife and I came for lunch today and the service was amazing! The waiter was on point, super nice and the food was delicious. They accidentally got my wife's order wrong and the manager came out and personally apologized and offered a soup or salad while she was waiting on the correct order. That certainly wasn't necessary, as we weren't upset at all. However, that was some of the best customer service we have ever had. Not only that, they ended up giving us free dessert anyway. Definitely coming back for the customer experience!!!"
Cameron M.,"Vancouver, WA",1,6,,1.0,3/13/2016,Beware the service here. I took my parents and brother there. Pretty simple order. My brother and I ordered salads to go with the entrees. They did not arrive before or even with the food so I asked the server to take it off the bill. He said he would get a manager. 15 minutes later neither the manager nor my moms food (soup and a salad showed up). So the server quit because he had apparently been dealing with this his entire shift. So we walked out - with the hostess futility saying she'd get a manager. They were not that busy at the time either. Avoid this disappointment to the BJ's name
Christopher B.,"St Petersburg, FL",135,128,107,4.0,11/11/2013,"I really like this place.  If you like quality, small batch beers and high quality american food then this is the place your you.  This restaurant has a ton of charm.  From its revolving door to its visible fermenters to the giant propaganda style art on the wall, this place is unique.   We have brought numerous people here and everyone has loved it.  I am especially fond of the lunches because they have specials.  I just had the friend chicken for $6.95.  We also ordered 3 of their house brand craft brews for a hair over $10.00.  Can beat that.  The burgers were excellent.  The flat bread was crisp and tasty.  And on veterans day they gave us a huge discount for the vet in the group. And don't forget the wall of TV's.  I have watched many a game here. Give it a shot."
Melissa O.,"Clearwater, FL",77,168,32,2.0,12/2/2013,"I haven't been back in a long time so I gave it another shot last weekend. Still not a fan. The service was great, so no complaints there. It was practically empty so we were seated right away. I had the French dip and subbed Tortilla soup for the fries. For twelve bucks, I thought it was on the small side. I would not order it again. I did like the presentation on the soup but it wasn't a great soup, but it was good.  He had a burger that was so super salty it was inedible, as in we didn't even take it home for the dog. The fries went uneaten as well. I didn't try them, he just said they weren't good.  I think it's way over priced for the food quality and I don't see myself coming back here."
Vickie J.,"St. Petersburg, FL",94,145,21,4.0,1/2/2015,Good food. Decent prices. Good service. Good beer. Their mixed drinks are very weak. But overall a good casual dinner.
Michael J.,"Lyman, ME",17,52,1,4.0,5/4/2013,"Solid!  This is a great place that locals seem to love and rightly so.  Good food, friendly service and cold beer.  Try Beanie's Red on tap - really smooth.  Their Reuben is as good as any NY Deli and they can grill the rye bread without making it greasy! If you want a break from fried seafood, Beanie's is the place"
Will M.,"Easley, SC",251,7,,4.0,7/24/2014,"I had never heard of BJ's before I moved to the area. My family and I decided to stop in for dinner one night since it was very close to our apartment. I was pretty surprised. We walked in on a wednesday night and couldnt believe how crowded it was. It's a big restaurant with some great features. A full bar and a bunch of TVs to watch the game. I guess this is a chain but, in my humble opinion, I think it's definitely a step up from a typical Chiles or Applebees. Maybe on par with a cheesecake factory or something to that affect.  At any rate, the atmosphere was casual but nice. They have a good selection of domestic and import beers as well as their own house brews. I tried the piranha pale ale and the hopstorm IPA. Both were pretty good. For dinner, I had the jalapeño burger with wedge fries. A generous portion but not overwhelming. What topped it off though was our waitress.  Right off the bat, Courtney was extremely helpful. Everything from course selection to beer recommendations. She was on top of it. Since we were new to the area, we figured we would ask about some other good places to eat and go out. She was a wealth of information on the local eateries and bar scenes. We got way more than we bargained for. Not only was the food and beer great, but the service and atmosphere was outstanding. I will certainly be back soon!"
