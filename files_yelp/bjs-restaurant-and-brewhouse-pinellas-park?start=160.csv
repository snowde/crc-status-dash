Meagan D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,7,2,1.0,6/10/2015,"They're disgusting!!!!!!! KEEP YOURSELF AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!  I ordered food online from this place tonight & got a hair in my food. I ordered the angel hair pasta with shrimp & as I was almost half way I felt something weird in my mouth.... Then I thought ""oh it's probably just my hair""... Then as I took a look at it (I'm blonde) it was a nasty medium size black hair. HOW F******NASTY COULD A RESTAURANT & PEOPLE WORKING THERE BE?!!!?!!! Wow!!! You guys need a better manager & clean/smarter workers at that shit hole!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, & HEALTH EATING THAT TYPE OF TRASHY FOOD AT THAT ""RESTAURANT"""
Julio M.,"Tampa, FL",3,58,21,3.0,1/21/2015,"Had the new lighter version of lemon thyme chicken for lunch. Food was not as expected. Taste was off, tool salty, cold, etc ... Nevertheless service was great. Server was very attentive."
Michael C.,"Oakland, CA",865,734,363,4.0,1/28/2011,"I love brew pubs. Titanic was my favorite dining location in Miami, and now that I'm in Tampa, I'm looking forward to trying the many breweries and brew pubs in the area. For my first night permanently in town, I wanted my friends to take me some place we don't have in Miami, and we decided on BJ's. They have 8 beers brewed in house on their menu, plus a seasonal. You can try a flight sampler of the 4 light beers, the 4 dark beers, or what I did: all 8. And these aren't small sample glasses, these have more than enough to taste. While I recommend trying all 8 to get an idea of what you want, I quickly learned that the 3 lightest were not my favorites. I would stick with the Pale Ale, the Irish Red, and the other dark beers. Now there's the menu itself. There is a large selection of appetizers including the usual stuffed egg rolls, nachos, sliders, flat breads and more. They also have individual appetizers also known as ""sides"". I didn't get any of these. Instead I focused on what I actually wanted. They have huge salads, a selection of burgers and sandwiches (I'd suggest for lunch), a lot of different pizzas, plenty of pasta, and American entrees like meatloaf and pot roast. I went with the chicken fried steak. For $12 you get two fried steaks. I could only eat one, so $6 per meal isn't a bad deal. Then there is the dessert. My friends raved about the Pizookies. Simply: its a fresh out of the over cookie covered with ice cream. And its a damn good cookie too. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful the whole night, spending some time to talk to us, and she brought out the food rather quickly. I look forward to coming back."
Chris A.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,5,,2.0,5/9/2015,"The server was very nice, but that about the best thing I can say about them .  I ordered a steak cooked medium.  When it arrived it was WAY-over cooked.  I sent it back and asked for a replacement which took another 20 minutes to get.  At that point I asked for it to be boxed so my dinner partner and I could make our show.  I later attempted to eat the meal and the steak had so much pepper on it, I couldn't eat it.  They did comp my meal, but given that it was inetable, that's not much compensation.  This use to be a really good place.  I wouldn't say that now."
Andy D.,"St. Petersburg, FL",85,391,67,4.0,6/1/2013,Love the beer selection!  Lunch deals are good.  I have nothing bad at all to say about this place.  It's always clean and the service has most often been great.
Michael K.,"Hollywood, FL",107,10,17,5.0,11/23/2013,"Dropped in before going to the movies for a quick appetizer. Ordered the skewered shrimp for my date and the bruschetta for me.    Awesome flavors. Perfect for what we needed.  Mike, our server was absolutely paramount. He was exceptionally bright and funny. He also recommended we purchase our movie tickets from BJ's at a discounted rate.  Of course we did.  I like his style, on the consumers side. This review was in 2010, it was not posted properly from me at that time.  I still stand behind this review."
Thomas P.,"Moscow, ID",141,165,9,3.0,6/8/2013,"BJ's has a huge menu selection. I've tried a number of dishes and most were pretty good. The mini-bruschetta with grilled Focaccia bread, topped with melted provolone and a blend of fresh Roma and sun-dried tomatoes, onions, basil and roasted red peppers was okay, served with a pesto vinaigrette. The crispy fried artichokes were tasty, lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Served with lemon garlic aioli which was just OK. I preferred the artichokes with a squirt of lemon juice. Both of these small plates/bites were under $5.  The New Orleans Jambalaya with blackened chicken, shrimp and chicken-Andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce was served over a rice pilaf and topped with green onions. I thought it could have been a little bit spicier. The dish was way too greasy from the oil and sausage combination.  They have specialty beers and cocktails, huge bar, and jumbo TV's. Décor is nice and service was very attentive."
Jessica J.,"St Petersburg, FL",36,162,1,3.0,12/20/2012,"This review is based solely on food.. have not experienced their brewhouse offerings. At first I totally loved this place. It's really quite nice inside. I love that they offer chicken lettuce wraps for the carb-conscious diners. They have an awesome selection of small bite appetizers for 3 dollars!! And the portions for those items are actually quite generous. Most restaurants don't do this. The tomato mozzarella salad was so amazing. The menu is quite a lot to digest.  Their in-house made sodas are AMAZING!!! Especially the root beer and the orange cream. I don't drink soda, but I downed that orange cream like nobody's biznazzzz. (Beware of the black cherry.. I didn't personally try it but our server claimed it tastes like Robitussin.) Last time I came here, though, I was a bit disappointed. But disclaimer.. they are known for their pizzas. I did not order a pizza. So maybe one ought to stick to the specialty item. I had some pasta chicken and the chicken kinda tasted like some frozen crap meat... similar to Olive Garden's chicken. No thank you.  Also tried their famous Pizookie, a decent sized cookie in a pizza pan, soft and gooey with ice cream on top. Look folks, I'm half Jewish, but there's nothing ""halfsies"" about the sweet tooth I inherited. I live for cookies. Especially warm gooey cookies. But this chocolate chip dessert was even too sweet for me. Just too artificial and not enough home baked goodness. Same with the vanilla ice cream on top.. It was very artificial tasting. I don't know how else to describe it. You can taste the difference between a Haagen Daaz vanilla bean and this frozen garbage. I don't mean to be so harsh.. but for something they are apparently well known for, I was incredibly disappointed. On a plus side, I sampled the chicken bacon ranch pizza and it was totally delicious. I usually can't stand non-traditional flavored pizzas, but they knocked this out of the park. Also the service has always been absolutely superb! Thank you to James for your very knowledgeable recommendations.  I will be back again.. for pizza and appetizers only! And also because it's right by Marshall's, which I cannot get enough of."
Mike F.,"Parrish, FL",4,20,34,4.0,8/17/2013,Great ambiance and the perfect spot if you want to watch a game and enjoy there in house brewed beer.
Rosin E.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,5,4,4.0,3/6/2015,"The food today was a little over cooked.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were a little sad.  They were slightly over cooked and shriveled up and small comparatively to other times that we have ordered them. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted  Chicken which was good, but a little too crispy. There is suppose to be a butter/Parmesan sauce drizzled on top. There was barely any on so my meal was a little dry. My husband ordered the Blackened Chicken fettuccine which was overly spiced with the blackened seasoning. Not as good of a meal today"
Tayler B.,"Auburn, IN",11,51,5,5.0,11/24/2014,My wife and I ate here and we're so impressed. I had a gluten free pizza (it was amazing) and she had a deep dish. We both said how great the food is!
Andrea R.,"St. Petersburg, FL",53,97,207,2.0,5/25/2014,"BJ's Brewhouse seems popular as it's usually packed in the evenings so I was interested in trying them out for dinner. This evening was no exception with families and sports fans waiting for tables. My dining companion and I ordered drinks and after a good 15 minute wait the waitress came back to curtly take our order. I ordered the broiled shrimp tacos. I've had shrimp tacos at numerous restaurants around the bay and must say these are way down on the list. The shrimp were cooked well but all other flavors in the taco were forgettable. Served with WARM guacamole, salsa and bottom of the barrel chip remnants I was underwhelmed. Our waitress was truthfully unengaged in providing anything other than extra spicy mayo to improve my tacos, which it did not... She never offered dessert, coffee or refills on our drinks and once our bill was paid she made every effort to make sure we felt the pressure to leave. Don't intend to return anytime soon."
Jeff L.,"Largo, FL",0,3,1,1.0,2/9/2015,"Went for the deep dish pizza! I had heard that it was like Chicago style pizza! What a major let down it was. The pizza had little to no sauce and barely any cheese so it was very dry and kind of crunchy at times. I have had better frozen pizzas with more cheese, more toppings and better flavor. It was more like focaccia bread then actual pizza. If you're going for pizza save your money and go someplace else."
Jenny S.,"Largo, FL",20,71,4,4.0,4/14/2014,They have great Happy Hour drink prices and 1/2 off appetizers. The apps are quite tasty and plenty enough to share. It was very busy so the service was pretty slow but our server had a lot going on. Happy hour is just in the bar area which I don't love but it's a great place to get together with friends after work.
Chet L.,"Nashville, TN",113,225,216,2.0,4/5/2012,"Beers on tap were flat...BJ's brews were fine, however.   When letting the manager (Heather) know they may have an issue with their guest tap beers, she rudely said ""well we can't shut down our restaurant...we're a brewery..."". Nobody asked her to do that or be condescending, but then, nobody asked me to YELP about the mgmt. problem here...so I guess we're even.  Our server Gina was great...one of the best servers I've ever had.  Heather, you need help...corporate will hear/read about this...bet on it. This place deserves 4 stars for the previous experiences...however a chink in the armour (is that allowed anymore?  Sorry Jeremy Lin) is needed to bring the average down for this visit."
Jeremy L.,"Largo, FL",57,108,77,3.0,3/5/2013,"I love the food at BJ's.  I especially like the jumbalaya.  The service at times is quite slow.  I was unable to order more wine with my meal, as I could not seem to find my waiter.  I also had to ask to order dessert, rather than have it offered.  All in all, the food is great, but service really needs improvement."
Kristina T.,"Pinellas Park, FL",1,11,5,3.0,9/26/2014,"First time here and I ordered the shrimp pasta, all I could taste was the seasoning bits in it - ended up not finishing it at all. Other than that, it was just okay. My bf had a steak that wasnt the worse but wasnt great either. But I have to say the dessert we got was the best icecream dessert ive ever had. It had chocolate and vanilla icecream with hot fudge on the side. The place is nice and dimmed which I like, but we paid overprice for something that was just decent. We probably wont come back, only for the dessert LOL"
Leo J.,"Clearwater, FL",1,5,6,3.0,8/28/2011,"We come here average twice a month for the food and mostly the good beer. Altough lately the food has been average. Went here yesterday and although it was Saturday afternoon and they were busy both meals were disappointing. I ordered the California Burger and as usual asked for the sauce on the side. Although it was on the side, the kitchen staff managed to also put it inside. It was sent back and then the second burger arrived on its own. The fries came about 5 minutes later. My hubby ordered the shrimp tacos which are very good. This time the shells were so overcooked they crumbled.  The service here can be very good or very bad. It is never in between. We have had waiters that disappeared never to be seen again. Since we come here often we have come to know the waiters who are the best and always try to get one of their tables. The beers are really good. Especially the sesonal ones they bring on at different times of the year. Our favorite are the Nit Wit (on now) and the Pumpkin beer coming soon. Agree with other reviews that the menu and portion size is similar, although not up to their standards, to The Cheescake Factory. Their special cookie dessert is very good and they now have a few gluten free items on the menu. Monday's they have a special $19 menu where two people can get a soup/salad, a medium pizza and then share a cookie. A good deal if you can make it. We will continue to come here for the food and beer despite the sporadic service."
Janet G.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",30,11,,4.0,9/22/2014,I always get the same thing because its SOOO good! For starter we get the fried artichoke hearts and then I always get the ahi tuna salad.  Service is alwas good.  If we go to the movies we are eating here!
Ian T.,"Largo, FL",0,7,,2.0,12/18/2013,"Great beer, but the food tastes like it's all frozen corporate crap that is reheated on premises.   Have been eating at BJ's for about 10 years, originally moved from Los Angeles, and we were excited when they opened this one up 5 years ago or so, one of their first in Florida.    But the food is not as good as I remember it to be.   We order the deep dish pizza, the potato skins, the avacado egg rolls and pizzouki.     A couple of times ago we went and the pizza was undercooked and seemed cold.   The potato skins were not as crispy as we remember them, and taste like frozen reheated food.   The egg rolls were bland.   We said we'd never go back.   It's a little more expensive than we like to spend as well. Well we returned recently, as my 5 year old daughter loves the place because of the pizzoki.   It was bad again.   Why do I support this corporate chain with mediocre food when there are so many local businesses that are better?   Won't be returning unless for happy hour beer."
