Jillian K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",5,79,27,2.0,7/28/2015,Nothing special at all. There are much better local places for good food and amazing craft beer. Drive any direction and you'll find something you'll enjoy. Yelp search craft beer near you. Most other breweries and tap houses feature food trucks or are next to decent dining. This area has great craft beer and food. Don't settle for blah
Fulano D.,"Tampa, FL",14,63,66,1.0,6/13/2012,"Went to lunch today with my wife. First,  her Ahi tuna salad had an additional dressing poured over the tuna which made it very spicy.  The menu does not indicate this and she can't eat food like that due to health reasons. I asked for my salad dressing on the side as I always do for a variety of reasons, including no spiciness. I received my salad drenched in dressing. I ate it anyways to not have to wait like my wife was. The waitress, a petite middle aged Latin female, was absent and we had to get the manager to help.  She waited and I waited as well to eat with her. Later the waitress said the salad would be comped.  We said great, thank you. When the check finally came, it  was in fact comped.   When the card came back  it was for another table, for a different amount but my card was put through already by the time I noticed. I reported this to our absent waitress and she then took a  long time consulting with the manager, a short w/m heavy set with a shaved head.  I approached them at the cash register and asked what was the holdup.  Since this was lunch and we had things to do, other than a two hour lunch. Rule #1 Mr Manager: do not cop an attitude with the customers. That is what he did.  This guy asked me what was wrong with a tone that implied, I'm about to kick your ass.   I told him the litany of problems and also told him the waitress was not good at her job.   He said, ""that's very rude"".  I said that is the truth and I am the customer. The manager returned my card and said this is on the house. He gave me the card brusquely and I left.  later I found I was in fact charged for the original wrong amount so nothing was comped. Overall,   the food menu does not explain sauces well for people with  spice issues.  The staff needs training, my waitress had communications issues in English.  That and her lack of attentiveness. The thuggish manager needs to chill out and realize if one goes into the food business to treat customers better and with civility, not like a bouncer at a baseball game.  I will not go back!"
Matt P.,"New Port Richey, FL",5,3,3,1.0,9/7/2015,"First off I rarely write review about experiences at restaurants....either I have been blown out of the water by the service and preparation of the entrees or the experience has been absolutely garbage to the point I find it necessary make sure everyone know what kind of clusterf*** they are getting in to....unfortunately in this case my experience has been dreadful. Our reservation had been set for 630, our waiter who I assume is new? Didn't seem to have any kind of personality what so ever,by the time we received our appetizers it was 745...two couples in our party had ordered the calamari one plate was full and seemed to be plated properly, the one I had received looked like a half order AT BEST, I didn't say anything because 1) I was hungry and 2) wasn't that big of a deal at the time. The entree...... I had ordered the shrimp scampi pasta...when the waiter put the dish down the first thing I had noticed was the trifecta of pasta that was in my bowl, when it was only suppose to be angel hair pasta....I go in for my first bite, I was shocked....how utterly bland and over cooked my meal was. For a $17 bowl of pasta it was the most disgusting thing that had ever past the threshold of my mouth, the pasta tasted like it had been boiled in old shower water,the shrimp were just as bland as the pasta. After digging  around and stirring the bowl in hopes to retrieve any flavor at the bottom of the dish, the only thing I found were a few pieces PINEAPPLE which I didn't remember in the description of the dish in the menu......I had asked for another menu to double check,it didn't say anything about pineapple...after about five bites I had enough of the torture and told the waiter to take it away.....moral of the story is I will never be returning to a BJ's because apparently they don't care about the quality of the food they are feeding their customers, along with the absurd prices for their soup kitchen quality entrees...$52 for a half ass appetizer, 2 entrees that were either over seasoned or just flat out not seasoned and a beer that I had to ask for 3 times by the time he finally got it to me. I've paid significantly less money for far better food and customer service."
Becky S.,"Seminole, FL",0,155,,4.0,1/13/2015,I like their poke and sandwiches. they have a great happy hour menu and it is a good place to have a beer and watch football while eating tapas.  It gets crowded for business lunch and I have had a problem getting se3rvice.
Casey H.,"Orlando, FL",31,344,389,4.0,11/27/2012,"My god - it took forever to get us in this busy place. Once in, I highly recommend the tuna salad... it is sooooo good! For desert - go for the cake like things that has 3 samples... don't remember the name but you won't be disappointed. If it wasn't so darn hard to get it - 5 stars As a last note - a lot of people eat the pizza or pizza on flat bread... looked great."
Patrick K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",24,86,1,4.0,5/15/2014,"This place is pretty darn good.  It's a casual pizza/brew pub that has a ton of pizza options - all of which are available in personal or larger sizes.  They brew their own beer (and root beer for that matter) and are always packed!  The downsides are that it is always busy so you have to park pretty far away and the service has been slow to awful every time I've been there.  That being said, I really like the food and it's worth a visit, especially if you can go during an off peak time."
Susan H.,"New Port Richey, FL",211,33,1,5.0,11/1/2012,Great lunch spot @ Citrus Park Mall. Had the 1/2 flatbread and salad combo. The flatbread pizza was a new item on their menu -roasted vegetables with Gorgonzola
Christopher N.,"St. Petersburg, FL",821,60,71,4.0,5/11/2014,"Great happy hour! You must sit in the bar to take advantage of it. Happy hour has a good selection of half price appetizers and discounted cocktails. This place is lively and a fun place to meet up with friends. Sports fans will love it. BJ's is ideal for those that can't decide what they want. This place has a variety of pasta, chicken, steak, burger and seafood dishes. This place is a favorite of mine."
Fred S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",1,4,,4.0,4/18/2013,"I haven't been to a BJ's since I lived in California. I was excited to find out that one was so close by.  Called up a buddy and off we were.  We stopped in on a Thursday night around 8pm and the place was packed. We didn't want to sit at the bar as we were both starving and wanted a table to eat at. Lucky for us there wasn't a wait for 2 tops. If your going with a party I suggest calling ahead. As we were walking in we overheard a group of 8 or so complaining about waiting for 30+ minutes. What do you expect when the place is packed?   I wish I remembered our servers name. She was absolutely phenomenal and hands down some of the best service I've received in awhile. Believe me, you can have the best food in town but if the service isn't there I won't be a customer , so it's very rare for me to enjoy service such as this. It was personable and over the top from start to finish just the way it should be. The food itself is good (not great). I know their known for their pizza but I wanted something different. The menu is huge so be prepared to do some studying before you order. We started with the avocado egg rolls. Those things are awesome. The sauce that they serve with them is the best part. For the entree I got the rib eye. Yes I know, this isn't a steakhouse. It was what to be expected. Nothing to write home about but didn't leave a bit on the plate either.  Another awesome thing is their beer. I'm not a big drinker but tonight I decided to go for it. I mean after all thats partly what their known for. My buddy and I each got their sampler set which is 8 5 oz beers ranging from their lightest to their darkest. I'm not a big fan of stouts but whatever they were serving was actually decent. Hands down the nutty brunette was the best.  Although the food didn't blow me away the personable service is worth returning for in itself."
Sam S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",4,3,,4.0,10/22/2014,I went there with buddies I haven't seen in a decade and the servers were so friendly and patient and the food was the bomb
Cassandra F.,"Strasburg, CO",23,7,,5.0,9/27/2015,Shannon was absolutely amazing! We just moved from Colorado and loved Bj's there as well. Thanks to Shannon she made us feel right at home
Dawn D.,"Clearwater, FL",32,46,33,4.0,3/31/2014,Our server Courtney was awesome.  They have a great selection of wine in addition to beer.
Steve S.,"St Petersburg, FL",4,34,12,4.0,7/6/2012,"Our waitress, Lisa, was attentive, but not intrusive.  Nice job. I had the chicken al fresca.  It was good.  If they would have dressed the arugula, it would have been great. Overall, it was a good meal after a frustrating golf game."
Jesse W.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",10,2,,5.0,10/29/2012,"I've been coming here on a regular basis since they opened. The service is almost always top-notch, and the food is consistently good. They have a full-line of craft beer, and boy is it good. I like their Piranha Pale Ale, and the Hop Storm IPA. I was surprised by the quality of their deep dish pizza, and the New Orleans Jambalaya is one of my favorite dishes. Get the Triple Chocolate Pizookie with vanilla ice cream. It's fantastic."
Brian S.,"Bronson, FL",14,40,57,2.0,8/8/2011,"It's just OK. Went with a group of 8 so this was not my personal selection. I did check the State health inspection reports the next day (this morning) and fortunately did not order anything repulsive.  Outer appearances are fairly clean, but what happens out of sight can be scary.  The food is the best part. I'd ordered two mini taco plates as a small meal;  VERY tasty, but they were quite soggy and runny to eat.  The sauce is perfect!  Service was poor, but maybe a Saturday 7 o'clock is too much for some servers.  My comment, ""service is almost existent"" got a big laugh; the server had to be flagged down every time.  My second draught beer order was the wrong brand, and had to be replaced.   Downside: high noise level and smelly men's room."
Don B.,"Florence, KY",0,3,,5.0,8/5/2014,"I ordered the New House Sirloin tonight and was it great, my wife and daughter ordered the Chicken fettuccine and loved it, my son ordered the French Dip and said it was awesome. I can't say enough about our waitress I just wish I could remember her name so I could give her some cud o's. Great food and exceptional service all together helps make a good vacation GREAT. 5  stars BJ'S thanks!!"
Lynn T.,"Modesto, CA",0,21,,4.0,6/6/2015,"We love BJ's and make it a point to visit them while we travel, as well as being ""regulars"" at our home town restaurant. This particular BJ's didn't let us down. Food and beer was exactly as anticipated. Service was really great! We tried a few of the brand new enlightened entrees, the Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken (now my new favorite) and the North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp (husband loved this). These entrees have so much flavor, the kind you'll keep craving. Would have given 5 stars if the manager had come over to visit us as requested to the hostess. We wanted to take a pic to share with our local BJ's team."
Valerie K.,"Largo, FL",24,37,18,4.0,3/26/2014,"I love this particular BJs! Their happy hour is actually one of the cheaper ones in the area. $3 wines and half price appetizers. Just make sure if you go for happy hour to sit in the bar, and it can fill up quick! So I recommend getting there before 5 on Thursdays and Fridays to get a spot at the bar."
Kat E.,"Chicago, IL",75,111,100,4.0,1/17/2014,"I like BJ's. The food is consistently good and they have a fabulous happy hour until 7. Drink deals vary by day of the week, but all apps and flatbreads are half off during HH. The place was packed when I got there around 5:45pm, so instead of going on the wait list, I lurked in the bar for a bit until I could grab one of the first come first serve booths. Our server was attentive considering how busy it was! Had the spinach artichoke dip which was good, along with the caprese salad small plate. There is literally something on the menu for everyone, and to satisfy all tastes. We will be back again, to try a p'zookie!"
Karen R.,"Kansas City, KS",0,6,,4.0,4/6/2014,AWESOME food! Great seasonings and unique dishes. A little pricey but loved everything I tried there. My favorites were the deep dish pizza and Pizzukies. I ate there three times in a week while on a business trip. Wish they had a BJ's in my area! The carry out service was excellent - very friendly and professional. I did not eat inside.
