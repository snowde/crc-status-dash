Rod K.,"St Petersburg, FL",69,65,,4.0,3/2/2013,"Recently after leaving the movies we stopped in to grab a bite & brew.  We sat at the bar and was greeted by both the manager and bartender.  Our service was friendly & quick.  The food & beverage quality was good for the money.  Good selection of cold beer draft & bottle.  The food was well portioned and pretty good for semi fast food.  No rush here, but nice casual dining.  Good for all ages, family and ""Date Night""."
Kim J.,"Treasure Island, FL",2,13,4,4.0,7/2/2012,Great happy hour specials till 7:00 during the week!
Margi V.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,1,,2.0,1/3/2016,"I have to say i was very disappointed in the food.. The appearance does not keep up with the quality of the cusine. My family and i ordered ahi poke and calamari as an app. Calamari was very greasy and half the size of the picture. The ahi poke was flavorless. The menu said it was marinated in a sauce but it was dry and basically cubed tuna with stale wontons. I also ordered clam chowder which was good must have been made by sysco.... My main entree was bjs bacon chesse brewhouse burger. The food took a while to get which i was happy with because my salad, apps and soup came all at once. If you appear to look upscale at least id like my food in courses but it was slamed out like waffle house which i did not like at all. Anyway by the time we got our burgers the brioche buns were crispy and my meal was luke warm as well as the burgers being super greasy... I was very dissatisfied with my meal my waitress was very pushy with hurrying on getting a order especially after i told her it was our first time dinning there.  We got no help no explanation of anything. For what we experienced this evening i would never return and id would rather have spent 80 dollars elsewhere. That was not including alcohol..."
Ray C.,"Denver, CO",25,190,113,4.0,10/22/2012,"This BJ's Restaurant is the first restaurant built in the state of Florida!  The headquarter is from California!   Anyways, I would name every food on their menu was supremely amazing! I tend get their delicious Sesame Chicken Salad and it was so much for the right price!  About their dessert, you MUST try  BJ's Famous Pizookie Cholocate Chunk cookie with ice cream on the top!  Omigosh, it was like heavenly!  When I leave the building, I could still taste of their dessert for a short time and it was such as mouthwatering! I promise you that you won't be regret try this ;-)  Enjoy the life!"
Graydon M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",86,192,30,3.0,9/25/2012,"BJ's is your typical American brewpub chain.  The food is good but not inventive.  The beers are solid performers as well - nothing that makes you want to say ""hey we need to come back here because this beer is fantastic"" but you will enjoy them while your here.  I have one location near my work as well as one near my home.  For me this is a good fall back place to go when no one can decide what they want.  There is typically something for everyone on the menu here."
Dessie M.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,5,6,4.0,9/6/2013,Awesome drinks. The food is good service depends on the time of day and waitress staff.
Lance W.,"Dana Point, CA",82,36,6,3.0,8/26/2012,A familiar spot for us as they're a national restaurant. Their beers always do well at the GAGF and we had some decent ones this day. Basic pub fair food and better pizzas.
Jason S.,"Seminole, FL",7,15,15,4.0,2/25/2014,I visited here today for my first time. The building is beautiful inside & out. Service was good. I had the stuffed mushrooms with spinach which was very good. I had the jalepno burger which was very good but i asked for it well done and it came out pink in the middle. Overall it was a beautiful restaurant with good food. Prices are a tad bit high though but the ambience and quality of the food is worth it.
Rosie G.,"Clearwater, FL",0,13,9,4.0,3/21/2012,"Went for an early dinner with a big group of friends. The selection of food and beer was awesome. Huge selection for the picky eater.  Our server was great, very friendly and not overbearing. She was on it when our drinks were low and she checked on us to make sure we were happy.  I wished I remembered her name but I was enjoying my beer too much! Everyone in our group was very happy with the food and service. We had pizza, appetizers, small dishes, steaks and desserts- it was all good and cooked like we wanted. We will definitely meet there again!"
Greg T.,"St. Petersburg, FL",2,21,2,5.0,2/4/2013,"Don't get a meal, the three dollar appetizers are the way to go! The nutty brewnette is a really good beer that they make in-house. The service was actually pretty good, considering how busy they were. I went on a Saturday night, and the place was packed.  We really liked the atmosphere. It had a very unique feel, with the theme they were going for."
Joe S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,4,,2.0,7/17/2013,"Have enjoyed a couple of lunches a year or two ago, so I thought an early dinner before an early movie made sense. I was happy to see the place wasn't crowded. We were seated promptly, and awaited our server. She had THREE tables to handle, but apparently this was either above her skill level, or perhaps, interest level. Long story short, she kept disappearing, and  asking for Mustard for our hamburgers (twice) took almost ten minutes.  Weirdly, after asking for the check, she disappeared again... not the best way to optimize your tip.  Do yourself a favor... apparently the varsity servers aren't scheduled on weekday afternoons. Frankly, the food was not up to their normal chain restaurant standards either. It will be awhile before we return."
Myrrh R.,"St Petersburg, FL",4,28,,4.0,10/26/2010,"I don't usually like chains, either, but we always have a good experience there. The food is pretty good (I love the tomato soup and the french fries) and the service is friendly. The wait can be a little long, but they are always busy, so going for dinner when you're really hungry is tough.  When we want snacky-bar food in casual clothes, this is our default, no-brainer pick. I leave happy every time."
Marie-Noelle C.,"St Petersburg, FL",20,11,,3.0,11/20/2012,"So this is a place that I go to for lunch mostly because their lunch menu is reasonable and not bad in terms of food offerings. However, if I do go I definitely need to be there shortly after they open because the service can be a tad slow and working with a hour lunch and 10 min drive cuts into food time. The menu in general is huge ala cheesecake factory which makes deciding on anything quickly not likely. But in terms of the lunch menu it's pared down to a page. I like the salmon because it comes with steamed veggies and pilaf and I get it blackened. However, I've been getting the southern fried chicken which is not so bad with the corn succotash over mashed potatoes and pretty crispy chicken breast. The gravy is ok and not in excess to me."
Britany A.,"Tampa, FL",29,62,9,5.0,8/21/2011,Came here for a work lunch. Service was great. Menu selection was expansive. I ordered a mini pizza & salad . Broad lunch specials to choose from. Pizza was delicious. Best deep dish I've ever had!!
Donna Stlouis S.,"Seminole, FL",0,18,2,1.0,7/15/2014,Worst dinner and service ever experienced. Sat in bar took 20 min to be acknowledged then ten more minutes to take order. Food pizza a Nd salad awful. Had to ask for silverware and drink after food delivered. No salad dressing and didn't get any until I finished salad. Don't ware ur money !!!!
Cher M.,"Oak Park, IL",85,147,49,3.0,12/2/2011,"BJ's is clean, the servers prompt and good-natured, and the food is good. Nothing really stands out, but nothing fell short either. I'd go here again, and expect a good time, but there's nothing exceptionally awesome about this place. It could have been any other chain brewery. I did like the pear cider bear, however. This is a place that won't screw up your food, but won't knock you off your feet either."
Moon B.,"Greensboro, NC",0,34,,5.0,4/14/2012,Wow great BJ's Porter!!  I tried BJ's Porter IT WAS AWESOME!  Also tried BJ Red... Not as impressed since very much like Killians.  I had to come back just to get more Porter before we left town.  They have plenty of other beers on tap if you dont want their micro brews.  The resturant has a nice ambiance.  The food is good also with a nice variety ranging from burgers to unique pizzas .....also has four flat screen tvs at the bar if you wanna keep up with  sports.
David G.,"St. Petersburg, FL",31,41,1,4.0,2/8/2010,"Been here a ton of times and the food is great, the service is usually excellent and its a great place to get together with friends and watch a game. Its always very busy and we'll only wait 25 min at the most to get in. But it makes sense because this place is fantastic for the type of atmosphere they provide. You cant go wrong w/BJ's if thats what youre in the mood for..."
Shane H.,"St Petersburg, FL",5,77,,3.0,5/30/2012,Great place to drink and eat. I personally love the atmosphere however the food is very greasy. Great service!
Michael Z.,"St. Petersburg, FL",150,402,5,3.0,8/23/2011,A nicer chain with a large beer selection and standard pub type food.  Lunch specials are reasonable and I would dare you to find a seat that DIDN'T have a view of a flat screen TV.
