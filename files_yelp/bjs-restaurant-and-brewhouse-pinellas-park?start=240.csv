N.C. F.,"St Petersburg, FL",0,45,27,4.0,1/16/2012,"I really like the uniqueness of BJ's.  I've used it for business as well as social meals and my guests have always been pleased.  The menu choices are plentiful and served in pleasing table settings.  It is one big room so it can tend to be noisy, and oftentimes if you are not there before noon, there is a wait.  The lounge is at the end of the dining area but quite large.   There is a take-out area which speeds things up if you care to dine that way. They frequently offer specials if you sign up for their email list.  The pizza is good, as are the ""tapas"" type menu items.  And...if you have a sweet tooth, you'll surely be tempted!"
Jay N.,"Bradenton, FL",3,1,,4.0,7/4/2010,"This is one of my favorite places to eat. That being said, is because the food is top notch.  Plenty to pick from, from the vast menu. The beers they have as their own are good and unique.  But the mixed drinks we had, were mediocre at best.  I had a top shelf margarita, my wife had the Long Island. Basically it was like having a lime flavored kool-aid and ice tea with no booze in them. (problaby a bartender that just got out of bartending school)  Granted the food and ambiance of this place over-shadowed the lack of quality in the mix-drink dept. which is fine."
Desiree' C.,"Clearwater, FL",5,45,,4.0,8/1/2011,"Sat at the bar the other night for a few cocktails and appetizers. Service was fine, though not overly friendly. I ordered the Cherry Coke cocktail with black cherry vodka, vanilla vodka, and soda and I liked it. For snacks we had the fried artichokes- which were great, the mini beef corn tacos - which were amazing and the chicken pot stickers which I felt were a little on the bland side. This was about my 4th or 5th time here and it did not disappoint."
Al C.,"Largo, FL",0,6,,1.0,3/14/2014,"Unfortunately I can't rate the restaurant since we never did get seated. We arrived with call ahead r reservations. Upon arrival we were given abuzzer and told it would be a 15 minute wait. Half an hour goes by and we inquire with the hostess who informs us that they assign a table upon arrival and as soon as that table is vacated we will be seated.  The party at the table we were pre assigned had been served, eaten and paid their check but hung out at the table with no additional food or beverage orders for over an hour. Pour table management and turnover. Not how a restaurant makes money. Needless to say after waiting over an hour my party of 6 decided to leave. We went home got very good Chinese takeout, ate in the comfort of our home and probably did so while the people at that table were still BSing.  BJ's seating policy cost them a pretty good sale, especially since many in our party drink beer."
Sandy J.,"Alexandria, VA",240,257,280,4.0,7/6/2010,"I normally don't review chains, but I never knew about their happy hour until now and had to share.  So, this review is mainly for their happy hour and dessert.  Definitely stop by during happy hour, all appetizers are half off.  Score!  Yes, I went crazy and ordered almost every appetizer.  I was a little ridiculous and didn't realize it until all of the food came out.  We barely had room on our table.  (To give you an idea...I went there with a friend and we sat at a four top booth.)  The service was great and if you've never had a pizookie (Their dessert, it's a pizza-cookie and it's so YUMMY.)...it's about time you did unless you're lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten (Oh, by the way for those of you that have Celiac disease, they have gluten-free pizza which my friend said was pretty good)."
Richard P.,"Largo, FL",26,12,6,5.0,3/21/2011,The beer is just great!  If your out with friends and not sure which beer you like order the beer tasters.  They have them in 4 or 8 orders. I highly suggest you order the 8.  Also the avocado egg rolls are AMAZING!!!!!!  Pirahana was my favorite beer will definitely go there more often.
Virginia G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",286,788,879,4.0,4/20/2010,"Stopped in here yesterday afternoon to try the new menu offerings and was not disappointed! The mac and cheese with chipotle & bacon was delicious and what a deal at $3.95. A large bowl of it, creamy and hot, would have been better without the bacon, but yummy just the same. The homemade kettle chips with parmesan sprinkle and creamy onion dip (which is more like ranch) were hot & crisp and all of $2.95 for a huge plate. The mozzarella salad was also great with fresh basil, roma tomatoes and a balsamic glaze ,again $2.95. Hubby had the california burger on sourdough toast and could only eat half. Of course the beer selection is nice as well. Unfortunately the day staff service here is just poor, poor poor poor. Thank  god shift change came and when the MIA bartender/waitress asked if we wanted to cash out we told her ""no"" (she didn't deserve a tip) and thankfully ended up with a new waiter who actually smiled, chatted, left when we wanted and came back when we needed. Had a great time, will definitely be back."
CJ Q.,"Chicago, IL",0,24,3,4.0,1/5/2013,"A bit of a wait to be seated, but we weren't in a hurry and so didn't mind. Food and drinks were satisfying. Enough tv's so you can catch a score and a few plays without being in your face everywhere. A bit loud, typical sportsbar volume. It was ok for us, but if you're trying to catchup with friends, it may not be ideal for great conversation. Otherwise, pleased with our experience. Next time I might try to see about reservations to cut down on the wait. (Must do a mean curbside-takeout business! Staff blasting past us repeatedly to take orders outside while we were waiting to be seated.)"
Jeff L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,142,1,3.0,5/17/2008,"For me, BJ's a cross between Bennigan's and The Cheesecake Factory (portions and menu items).  Even the long wait is similar to Cheesecake Factory!  Their menu selections are quite varied, which is probably their biggest strength.   I would recommend getting their Fish Tacos, Cobb Salad, or Jumbalaya.  Most of their appetizers are pretty good too.      Their pizzas are not bad, if you don't go in expecting their 'deep-dish' pizza (more like a pan pizza) to be like Chicago Deep Dish or else will be deeply disappointed--no pun intended.   I've been to BJ's probably 6 times and I've found that their service is hit-or-miss.  Sometimes, you will wait forever to be served and at other times, service is good.  For their service, i'd give it no more than 3 stars."
Melissa O.,"Largo, FL",0,18,,4.0,10/26/2012,"This place is the best. What a great selection of beer, it was like going around the world on a beer tour. I love the pizza...I had was excellent. The selection is your typical brew house, not extreamly innovative but can settle.  This was great after our extended golf day...will be back with a few friends!"
Ronald M.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,2,3.0,7/7/2008,"BJ's was okay. Ate there a week ago.  We had the chicken and ribs, parmesan chicken, and jambalaya pasta.  The food was tasty.  They recommend getting the pizza because that is what they specialize in, but I don't like going to a restaurant just to order pizza unless I'm at Pizza Hut.   And the restaurant did remind me of the Cheesecake Factory as far the menu goes, not the ambiance.  However, the menu selection on BJ's menu is significantly less appealing than that of the Factory. Also the service was good too.  They waitress was kind and checked back on us frequently which was nice.  Overall, nothing really bad about this place.  Although I wish the menu had a better variety of food to choose from.  Maybe next time I go there, I'll try the pizza..."
Jason G.,"Greenville, SC",5,26,,4.0,7/4/2009,"This is one of the few national chain restaurants that I frequent of my own free will.  Good beer selection with most draft's being their own branded ones.  If you like tasteless macro brews like Bud you'll be disappointed as they don't carry any AB products.  Food is consistent and varied.  Chicken Cobb sandwich, California Club, and Meat Loaf sandwich are all good choices.  Pizza is good but then again its Chicago style which isn't really pizza.  BJ's is a good place to go grab a beer and snag a quick bite to eat.  This is one of the only places in mid-pinellas that you can get a decent beer and meal together.  The majority of eateries in this area consist of the likes of Applebees and Chiles.  Unfortunately BJ's does share a similar ambience to the Cheesecake Factory and I'm not a fan of the CF."
Stephanie C.,"Seminole, FL",0,6,,4.0,12/4/2009,Remember that old restaurant called Hops? Well meet it's new and improved sibling. This place is very trendy and doesn't lack in flavor. I always get the crusted chicken (back of the menu). The mashed potatoes are like eating a piece of heaven. They serve REAL root beer hand made in the restaurant. The pizookoe is to die for! Warms oreo cookie that makes the ice cream just melt in your mouth. Yum! Not a quiet place though. TVs are positioned throughout the place with one big screen above the bar that is split into like 4 channels. I love this place with a passion!
