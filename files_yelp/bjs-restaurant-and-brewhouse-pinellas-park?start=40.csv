Natalie N.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",6,122,161,5.0,4/19/2016,Food is good. Staff are pleasant. No complaints. Waiter was Kevin M. He was funny and anticipated needs every need before we had to ask. Honored Yelp coupon. Definitely coming back!!
Lisa J.,"Fort Myers, FL",52,8,,2.0,4/3/2016,"The food was as expected for a chain that we have eaten at before.  However the service was sub par. After we sat at our table for 15 minutes,  we were greeted by our server with,  ""some of you have drinks,  anyone else need anything?"" Twently minutes after that she returned to take our orders. When someone in our party could not hear her,  she responded with,  ""Sorry. I have Skittles in my mouth.  It's my dinner. "" I think she forgot to put in our apps as we had to ask for them and one came after our dinner was delivered.   I would eat at this chain again, but not this site."
Jayne B.,"Seminole, FL",1,15,8,5.0,3/9/2017,BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants. Great variety of food and good service. Pizooki is delicious!  Lots of beer choices. The porter is really good.
Kayne G.,"Nashville, TN",407,19,1,5.0,11/13/2016,"Not quite sure why the rating here was average. My boo and I went while on vacation and I was familiar with the brand from dining there in Norman, OK. and the food was always great. So glad I trusted my instincts because we had an incredible meal and experience. The special Grand Cru seasonal beer was awesome and 10% ABV. The waitress was great and let us sample a couple beers till we found the one we loved. The food was incredible! We ordered the Salmon Quinoi bowl which was cooked to perfection and shared a small Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza which also didn't disappoint. Trust us, just go."
Jeremy B.,"Atlanta, GA",151,334,1179,5.0,9/28/2015,"Boy do I love this place, I've been coming for years when I vacation in Florida & Texas, now we finally have a location in Huntsville, AL; that leaves us in Birmingham waiting our turn. I first discovered a great Belgian beer here called lambic a few years ! Such a great variety of  to select from and boy do I love the pizookie. I also like the new mediterranean chicken pita tacos, so delicious! This place is 1 of the few places I know that can cook such a variety of good, so well. Everything I've had over the years tasted delicioso!"
Puc C.,"Pinellas Park, FL",0,2,3,1.0,3/3/2017,Short of staff. We had to wait 50 minutes to be served. Many diners in the same situation.
Joseph D.,"St. Petersburg, FL",33,112,187,4.0,5/11/2016,Revisited BJ's yesterday with my wife for lunch. This visit was sooo much better than our last visit. The dining room was clean. We were promptly seated and our waiter Jeff was at the top of his game. Kudos to you sir. Drinks kept filled. Responsive service and a wonderful chicken club sandwich. Keep up the good work. We will be back.
George K.,"Bradenton, FL",12,16,,4.0,8/12/2017,I posted an earlier complaint and the manager got right back to me and took care of the problem.  I think this says a lot for a business.
Willie N.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",75,20,48,4.0,6/21/2016,Second time here and I must say this go round was way better my steak was well done and seasoned the white cheddar mash potatoes are to die for and I'm not really a soup kind of guy but I took my girl advise and I can not lie the broccoli and cheddar soup was exceptional. Service was great as well.
Kathy D.,"Clearwater, FL",8,1,,1.0,2/8/2017,"My family, friends and I have dined at the BJ's in Pinellas Park many times and always enjoyed the food.  However, tonight my husband and I ate there but our experience was disappointing. Neither of us are one to complaint about our food, however, I had the Cherry Chipotle salmon which was very good, but the asparagus that came the dish was old, stringy, chewy, and unedible. The manager Jim came by to ask how our meal was and when I told him about the asparagus, he said,""oh we cook that in the pizza oven and sometimes it gets over done.  Sorry about that""  and walked away.  I was not expecting a new meal of even a free dessert. I was, however, expecting to be treated like a guest.  I think this is the last time we will go to BJ's. For a manager to have that attitude is horrible. I would like to say the Elaina, our server, was very good."
Tim R.,"Kapolei, HI",12,48,27,2.0,9/28/2016,BJ's served cold meatballs.  The spaghetti and meatballs were unacceptable.  The first time they came just plain cold like being reheated from a can.  The second time was just a bit better. But still not BJ quality.  I think they are really going down hill here.   This should be a solid four star restaurant but it's not.  I was severely let down.  I guess I won't be back.  The picture is of the empty place where my wife couldn't eat.   I guess we will go through a drive through for her dinner.
Thuyen B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",155,438,1304,4.0,4/25/2014,"VERY big menu. Too much to look at lol. Surprisingly big restaurant- I had no idea just driving by it all the time how much room is inside. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, shrimp lettuce wraps, corn fritters, pulled pork sandwich, Moroccan spiced salmon, and my son had the chicken tenders. So. Much. Food. And it was all excellent!  Lots of flavors going on with the shrimp lettuce wraps. And they all melded together very well. Avocado spring rolls were crunchy and creamy. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was huge! I had to cut into fours to eat it. Pork was nicely marinated and the crunchy fried onion topping gave it a nice crunch. A beignet was ordered for dessert. I was too full to try it but everyone else at the table said it was good. Service was ok. A bit slow and lots of ""where's the waitress?"" at one point. She came and apologized though- had a spill happen that she had to clean up so completely understandable. Food came out pretty quickly and BJ's is utilizing the self pay at their tables so we were able to finish eating, pay at table and leave. Seems like a great place to grab food and drinks with the guys/girls any night of the week. I'll definitely have to come back and try their happy hour specials."
Lorri S.,"Gibsonton, FL",25,3,,4.0,1/13/2017,Great service and delicious food. I came for lunch and would definitely come back. My husband is particular about burgers and enjoyed his there very much.
Veronica R.,"Flushing, NY",13,215,338,3.0,9/8/2016,"Our friends recommend this place when we were down in Florida. This was the only place that stood open late. Upon arrival no hostess...ok no problem. We were seated and the server was very quick to take our orders. As apps we ordered buffalo wings, spinach stuffed mushrooms and pot stickers. Wings were good, stuffed mushrooms were good and pot stickers were good. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, bf ordered a California chicken club and my friends ordered a custom pizza. My bacon cheeseburger was not great, dry and flavorless my wedges were good. The chicken club was very good according to the bf. And the pizza was very good. Wish i would've ordered this. The pizza was deep dish sorta like Uno's. But i think this pizza is definitely better than Uno's. They have a variety of brews here so this is a must try when coming. The service was good and depending on what you order the food is good. Think I'll try this place again when in FL next time."
Dylan F.,"Portsmouth, NH",0,4,,2.0,6/29/2017,"Don't really like to give negative reviews, but my wife and I ate at BJ's and were not satisfied with the food. The staff and cocktails made were awesome! Not a bad atmosphere either! We had a pretty basic appatizer, which was great! Unfortunately, our main courses were surprisingly not good. It was decent food, edible, but for a ""brewhouse"" and being from a brew- dominant culture  (new Hampshire) we expected some awesome burgers! Unfortunately, the burger was very thin, seemed to be frozen, and really didnt ""wow"" us. Even some of the better fast food restaurants made a better burger. This is our second time here, and not sure if we'll go back. Maybe for drinks and an app, but not dinner. Again, i want to say great service, fun atmosphere, but not great food. Maybe shrink the menu and focus on better quality bar food, rather than trying to have tacos, pastas, and dozens of other things that the chef/ cooks have to make."
Christy R.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,1,,5.0,6/25/2016,"We went out with the family for my birthday dinner. Our experience was the best it's ever been! Our server was Brittany. She was super attentive and anticipated our needs before having to ask. My husband and I enjoyed half of the appetizer menu. (Half off during happy hour). Things were made extra special after the meal as well....  with my ""free"" surprise birthday pizookie! Great food, Great service , we will defiantly be returning! Thanks again BJS!"
Lisa T.,"Huntington, WV",81,23,1,5.0,10/16/2016,"Were visiting the area, stopped in and it was awesome!! Staff was friendly and recommended the ribs and pulled pork.  So we ordered the recommendation the food was perfect.   BBQ sauce was excellent and the ribs and pork were tender.  We will visit again!"
Bob J.,"Clearwater, FL",0,7,,5.0,6/4/2017,Took my Mom to dinner tonight at BJ's. Food was great. Service by Julio B. was outstanding. I would recommend asking for Julio B. as your server. You will be pleasantly surprised. Management and other servers should take notice.
Hans E.,"Clearwater, FL",247,30,9,4.0,3/10/2016,Returned today for another meal and had the Santa Fe Chix salad but swapped seared ahi for the chix. It was well prepared and tasted great. Service was good. This time I ate in and I must say I enjoy the design of the restaurant. It's very open and aesthetic.  Planning on returning.
Monika S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,20,3,3.0,5/2/2016,"I love Bj's food, and their menu is all over the place, which I like, but I cannot tell you how many times they've messed up my orders! Bjs is sort of bipolar in the way that you never really know if it's going to be exceedingly great or exceedingly terrible. The exceedingly great visits prevent me from totally giving up on them, but man oh man those bad trips. The highlights of my bad experiences are:  * One time there were shards of glass in my drink  * One time I ordered a brisket bacon burger and they didn't include the brisket or the bacon  * One time I placed my order in the app and paid for it and they had no idea when I came in to pick it up  But if you send an email about your bad experience, they will reliably send you a $25 credit for your next meal, so there's that. I love their Mac and cheese, I love their pizza, I love pizookies, but get it together, Bj's! I want to not hate you!"
