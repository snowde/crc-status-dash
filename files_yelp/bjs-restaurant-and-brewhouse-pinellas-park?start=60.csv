Kristen F.,"Miami, FL",4,62,59,1.0,10/30/2016,I'm rating 5 stars for this location only! I came here with my kids and my son ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and the noodles were way undercooked! service was horrible. I used to be in hospitality so I understand how it is but it was really bad.
Grant A.,"Kailua, HI",7,11,10,2.0,7/24/2016,"The food wasn't that great and even with a 20% discount on the App it was still overpriced. The waitress was sweet but the rest of the staff couldn't care less. Not impressed, won't be back."
Brittany W.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,28,,3.0,4/30/2017,"Amazing selection and really good food but been here about 4 times and each time it's impossible not to notice that the staff, while none of them have actually been rude, either look miserable or seem to have a lack of communication amongst each other. There's usually a pretty long wait time to get your food - today my boyfriend and I came for lunch and after waiting 30+ minutes for our appetizer, our main courses came out without the app ever arriving. They were very nice and attentive and took the app off our bill and made sure to be extra hospitable afterward, but it was still annoying. Bottom line is not sure if it's management or staff who has something amiss here, but it's probably not enough to keep us from coming back."
Riley L.,"Tampa, FL",0,408,585,4.0,12/22/2015,"I love this place.  Whenever I come home to visit, I feel I owe it to myself to eat here. I've been coming here since it opened and haven't had a bad experience so far.  Sometimes the wait can be a bummer, but there' s really nothing that they can do about that.  The service has always been great at even the most busiest of nights. My favorites:  Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Irish Root Bear (alcoholic), Avocado Rolls, and Pazookie (half chocolate chip and half red velvet). The Baked Potato and some of the flat breads are good as well.  If you're not driving, i would also suggest the eight beer taster (only $12.95) to try out at least once.  Not only is it cheap, but their beer is pretty good (definitely not the best)."
Shannon M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",10,22,27,4.0,4/26/2016,Good experience with good food and a better drink! The waitress was very attentive and helpful while I dined alone and didn't make me feel bad! She also got a nice tip from me and helped me pack up my left overs even before she saw her tip! I'll be back!
Michael D.,"Pinellas Park, FL",640,33,89,5.0,9/6/2016,Went in after work and needed to eat. Got a great greeting from Renee and tried the new cider. Excellent suggestions. Michelle brought me a menu and said hello. Even Tony came out to check on my meal. Made my day. Great food and excellent service from the moment i walked in.
Hillary V.,"St Petersburg, FL",341,555,1392,3.0,11/27/2013,"The building & staff... This is a big ass restaurant with TVs galore. The parking situation isn't too bad. The servers are very nice.   The food... I find their menu stressful. I hate when places have too many choices, but I've liked what I've eaten here this far. Their fries are phenomenal.  The drinks... I am very into craft beer, and BJ's is kind of weird for me. Since they are a brewhouse, I think that's where my rating come into play. I like the pale beers and really enjoyed their Oktoberfesr brew. But their dark brews are kind of a disappointment. When you can make a helluva stout, you can call yourself a brewer. (Is that not a thing?) Overall, BJ's isn't too bad. Good place to stop in before a movie."
Suzanne H.,"Brandon, FL",133,20,6,5.0,4/3/2016,"My husband and I went on a Sunday for lunch. Desiree was our server. She was sweet, attentive and pays attention to details. The the brisket and bacon burger my husband had was great. The portions were generous. I had the soup and salad. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup in a bread bowl. They put avocado, cheese and tortilla strips in the bottom of the bowl and pour the soup in at the table. It was yummy! We had berry ale, it was a light summertime beer. Awesome experience!"
Dan L.,"Rochelle, IL",0,20,6,5.0,4/30/2017,"Great Happy Hour and super BOGO offers. Their appetizers, selection of beers and dinner plates are great. Super place to watch sports or bring the whole family for a great time. It's definitely our go to place a couple times a week. Download their app for deals, reservations and paying your bill."
Susan T.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,16,4,5.0,3/23/2017,Best happy hour in the area. The food is top notch. Great variety and special prices at happy hour for food and drinks.
Mary E.,"Clearwater, FL",159,14,2,4.0,2/14/2016,"The barbeque bison burger is delicious. So was the salted caramel mini cookie. Our server was a little slow, but all in all a good meal after the movie. The only downside was my drink didn't come with the garnish I requested. And even after mentioning it a couple times I still never received it. If not receiving the garnish for my drink is the only bad thing, I'll take it.  Hey bartender - blue cheese stuffed olives with the dirty Martini stirred (not shaken) ;)"
Jacy H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/3/2017,"Short of staff. I gotta wait too long, 45 minutes to be served!!! So frustrated!! . Still gotta wait too long for the food after ordering."
Annette R.,"Pinellas Park, FL",6,31,1,3.0,7/23/2016,"We eat here frequently.  Service is always good.  Food is good.  It's clean, and atmosphere is casual. We will continue to go here."
Heidi T.,"Largo, FL",0,11,37,5.0,2/20/2016,"Huge menu,  from salads to Flatbread to fish tacos salmon, deep dish pizza, burgers. Lots of their own great brews (try the berry burst cider) to many other drafts and creative cocktails!"
Bella G.,"Clearwater, FL",0,2,2,5.0,3/19/2016,"A good place to eat with various savory food on the menu. Very clean, affordable, good place to eat! The staff are very cordial every time I visit in this location. Thanks Bj's!"
William R.,"Warner Robins, GA",422,26,4,5.0,1/5/2016,"New to town today and was looking for a chill place for a late lunch.  Yelp sent me here. The server was awesome, happy and a great attitude. Had the burger with jalapeños and the wedge fries.  I've eaten burgers all over the country and this ranks up there in the top 20 if not the top ten. The burger was cooked medium rare like I asked. And with most specialty burgers, the last couple of bites were done with a fork, some people don't like that, but to me it means the burger was juicy. The fries were like most, I'm not a big fry lover so they did their job. For desert I had a pint of the house porter, it was good, not the best porter I've ever had.  I may make it back here, but have so many more exciting places to eat during my stay here."
Karena M.,"Pinellas Park, FL",18,2,,5.0,4/25/2016,"My fiance and I dine frequently at this particular BJ's. However, this 5 star review is for the service, hands down. We enjoyed our food. We had a pasta dish, which was very generous in terms of portion size. My fiance also had a steak, which was a nice cut (we have had the T-bone before, which is a little too fatty for our tastes and we wouldn't recommend it). However, the server Madelyn is by far the BEST server I have ever had at ANY BJ's locations -- or any restaurant ever, really! She is very attentive and anticipates the customer's needs. Every question we had was answered and we never had to ask or wait for a drink to be refilled. She was genuinely kind and seemed almost as if she had been a friends with us for years. The experience and professionalism that she displays is OUTSTANDING. 10/10 would recommend this young woman to anyone who eats at the Park Blvd BJ's. Ask for her if she is available and you will not be disappointed! EDIT: To add a tip, sign up for their Premier Rewards club if you haven't already... if you download the app (if you have a smartphone), you can get a free mini pizookie. You can also put your name on the waitlist and order during busy times before you arrive to the restaurant. It also adds up to points, which can take some money off of your bill or get you a free, full sized pizookie."
Alexis H.,"Cypress, TX",3,16,481,5.0,12/26/2015,"I've been here like a lot, especially when I moved out the state for many years, I have to come here every single time that I come back to the town. The foods always great, atmosphere are awesome, always busyal and crowded doesnt matter what day and what time. Staffs are super friendly and helpful. They updated the menu all the time. I will sure come back here many more time."
Ashley R.,"Dunedin, FL",16,107,89,4.0,10/13/2015,"Something for everyone here.  We've been a few times and the good thing is this is the place usually everyone can agree on when you can't agree on a place to go. The menu has lots of options and the portion sizes are hefty.  Considering I usually get two meals out of any entree because the portions are generous, I'd say the prices are awfully fair too.   I like their beers that I've tried, I don't LOVE any of them but they are good.  Recently tried he Oktoberfest and it was a nice seasonal brew.  The ribs were surprisingly good (it's not a know rib place) as well as the parmesan crusted chicken."
Mike M.,"Tampa, FL",71,267,175,4.0,9/19/2015,"This location of BJ's Brewhouse is a very good one, and it proved to me that writing off an entire restaurant chain because of bad experiences at one location isn't always necessary.  We recently relocated to Tampa from a Fort Lauderdale suburb, and had given up on the BJ's Brewhouse in Pembroke Pines after plenty of chances. Bad food and absolute uncaring staff and management were the norm, so they were off the list. My wife, daughter and I dined at this location after a Rays game, and it was a very good choice. We really liked the texture, taste and presentation of our Chicken Lettuce Wraps appetizer, served with fresh ingredients and prepared with care. My daughter ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and my wife had the Southern Fried Chicken. Both smelled great, looked very appetizing and were very much enjoyed. Nice portions and well prepared. I had the BJ's Favorite version of their deep-dish pizza. It was loaded with chunks of Italian sausage, meatballs, pepperoni and veggies. The crust was still crisp, instead of soggy like so many competitors. It tasted great, was prepared very nicely and was very filling. I'd order it again without question.  Our Server, Danielle, made the night. She was very attentive, ensured we always had what we needed and were satisfied, and she was so personable and professional. Very, very nice job. This chain is back on the good list thanks to tonight's very surprisingly satisfying meal!!"
