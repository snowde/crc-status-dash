Jocelyn V.,"Seminole, FL",0,21,13,4.0,8/16/2016,"Really good food, usually good service, a tiny bit overpriced for what you get but that's based on location."
Jennifer B.,"West Chester, OH",1,6,,4.0,8/8/2016,Mary was excellent and pleasant!! The half price pizza Monday deal was a pleasant surprise.  My beer was flat unfortunately but the IPA my husband had was very good.
Karen F.,"Orlando, FL",8,19,,5.0,5/29/2016,Service is great here. They were closing and we still received exceptional service. Food is always good!
Vanessa G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1,13,7,4.0,6/20/2016,"Went with my family for my birthday dinner. It was a Thursday night and we had to wait 45 minutes for a table, then our waitress disappeared repeatedly, making it difficult to order food and get drink refills. However, the food was great. The waitress let me order from the lunch menu and adjusted orders for others at my table as well. We ended up at the restaurant for much longer than we wanted because the service took so long, but a great pizookie at the end of the night made it worth it!"
Michael P.,"Tampa, FL",108,152,118,5.0,4/18/2016,"Really good food. They have a humongous variety of foods on their menu, and for the most part, it tastes excellent. You'll love their garlic Parmesan boneless wings and grilled chicken Alfredo. Service is quick, of quality and super friendly. You'll love this place."
Jord B.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,9,6,3.0,12/14/2016,"I previously gave a rave review to BJs. I haven't changed my mind about the food and the overall restaurant , but- I ordered in last week and it was a horrible experience. Maybe a one time thing, maybe there were some in-training setting up the dishes, but I will never ever order in from BJs. I don't say you shouldn't- but good luck to you.  They forgot 2 dishes (the kids' ones, which is the worst thing they could do...) and someone came over special to bring them- I appreciated that very much.  The rest of the food was less then eh. Salads were measly, potato was hardly cooked, they forgot dips, salsa, the sharing appetizers looked like they were forgotten in the tray for at least one day... ugh. Just real bad experience. Not to mention it was my kids' birthday and I had my in laws over for a ""nice"" dinner :-/ So in short- definitely would still go inside the restaurant, but would never ever again order take out. Oh and they sent me $25 e-card. Sorry, was not enough to compensate for this... :-( maybe if they covered the whole $76.51 bill... I just couldn't believe I paid that much for what I got!! I debated giving less stars, but considering most people eat in the place itself- it's still a great restaurant. Too bad they left such a bad taste after this experience... :("
Michaelle W.,"St. Petersburg, FL",116,107,323,4.0,2/10/2014,"Relaxing and delicious! Two words that sum up my experience here. After seeing a movie across the way at Regal, I stopped in here intent on a salad with some protein on top. My friend and I sat at a tall table in the bar area and were given menus. I am on a strict body building diet and needed a simple salad with protein. My friend and I ended up splitting two salads so we could try both. Our food arrived quickly and was savory and delicious. I had an ahi tuna dish which I enjoyed. The salad vegetables were fresh and crisp and the tuna simply seared.  I only give a four because I didn't find the food to be one of a kind. It's a great place I'd frequent again if I'm in need of a sit down meal after the movies."
Elena L.,"Clearwater, FL",1,20,2,2.0,4/8/2015,"What happened to this place? It used to be my go-to place with family and friends. And like all of a sudden, BJs stopped trying. Was there Friday 4/3/15.  Here's what I liked:  My party of 2 was seated almost immediately. That's it. Here's what I didn't like: Spinach/artichoke dip was cold and literally flavorless.  My hubby and I both had the Shrimp Scampi Pasta. Hello, we live in Fla, and we have access to some of the best seafood. So why does BJs use tiny little pathetic shrimp in their dish? Plus there were hardly any I there. Instead they weigh the dish down with oily, ""seasoned"" breadcrumbs. Very disappointing. Oh, that was bland too. Also, I don't think it's clean or professional when the server places her hands palm down on my table while she's talking to us. Also with her head down and talking so close we smelled her breath.  Plus, nobody cleared our plates and when we paid, our spinach/artichoke plate was still there. Not ever going back. Also, the menu is too busy and probably never gets wiped down. It's love to see what nasty microbes and gems live on the multiple pages of those bulky things.  They aren't clean and they feel greasy and disgusting."
Ashley P.,"Phoenix, AZ",314,164,68,5.0,2/4/2014,"I've been having the hardest time finding great servers in the St. Pete area but BJ's has restored my faith in amazing service! I've been here three times in the past week and a half because of how amazing the service is. They're also gluten and vegan friendly and all the servers have been helpful in making my meals meat-free! When I stopped in today for lunch I had Regina K. as my server and she was amazing! Great with refills, answering questions...a 10/10 server!!! If you go, ask for her! I'm definitely going to stop in for lunch more often, they have great prices for a lunch menu and the portions are great too! Honestly I have nothing bad to say about this place, their entire staff is really great and I'm so glad I found this place!"
Christiane H.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",16,28,2,1.0,8/28/2016,After visiting this location several times this is the first time i feel prompted to leave a bad review. When we arrived we sat in the bar area and our server was nice enough. I asked for sparkling water then realized once i opened the menu that they have options for sparking water drinks. So...no upsell on her part offering a new drink. We ordered the boneless rootbeer wings as an app. Turkey burger without red onions and the parmesan crusted chicken. Rootbeer glazed RIBS came out and we said..no we ordered the boneless wings. Server owned up to her mistake and i realize it happens. While waiting for the wings here comes my turkey burger but no parmesan chicken. Well...i don't want my entree before my app so send it back. Now here comes the manager on duty to apologize. Wings came out then the entrees. With red onion in my salad...serioisly?? Again manager came over to apologize and they sent out a side salad. The server asked if we wanted dessert n did send out a small single size pizookie on the house. But in my opinion...the manager should have comped our wings at the least. We never go out looking for free things but this dinner and overall experience was awful.
Amanda R.,"Dunedin, FL",0,1,,4.0,6/24/2016,"We had a double date night we close friends. Everything was going well and we made it in time for happy hour. Half off apps and cheap beers. So we all order. The 2 gentleman ordered 2 apps each and the ladies an app and dinners. All the food came out together. Apps and entrees after we told the waitress Brittany that we wanted one first and then one later. All ordered in the happy hour time frame. Bill comes and we get charged full price for the apps. When we ask for an adjustment, she makes us feel stupid that we ordered at separate time (which did not happen) both checks were wrong and had the manager adjust. She then comes back again and puts us down and is condescending that we even asked for the adjustment.  The manager and good food saved her butt from being rude and ignorant. We will be back but certainly hope she is not our server."
Jess D.,"Asheville, NC",49,88,24,2.0,2/2/2015,"So, this was my first time coming to BJs. The reviews seemed decent so my girlfriend and I decided to go for lunch. (She had already been to a BJs up in California). The space is nice, but the interior design is all over the place. So the theme of the restaurant was very scattered. The music was loud, but there is a lot of seating. Our service wasn't good at all. I was very disappointed. Our server never smiled, barely spoke to us, and acted like she was mad and didn't want to be at work. We were very nice to her, understanding she might have been having a bad day. Next, our food. I had the California Chicken Club, which was okay; but the avocado and Swiss cheese saved it. The avocado was a great addition to the club, and gave it flavor and texture. The bacon was rock hard, and the chicken was a little tough and dry.  Morgan had the BJ Brewhouse Burger, which she didn't like. She explained to me that the meat had no flavor and we tried putting salt and pepper on it, and it didn't help at all.  All in all, we were disappointed and won't be returning."
Kelleigh M.,"Tampa, FL",119,909,712,4.0,2/5/2014,"For chains, this one is pretty good.  Well appointed inside and clean.  I met a friend for a quick lunch and was happy to see that their menu hasn't changed too much. Yes, they offer specials here and there, but the dishes that they do well were still on the menu.  I opted for the grilled fish tacos and they did not disappoint. For $10, they were a good lunch deal. My friend had a southwest type chicken salad and it looked fresh. The huge chunks of avocado won me over.  Overall, this is a good option for lunch while in the area."
Skye C.,"Pinellas Park, FL",32,77,73,4.0,5/24/2015,"Our waitress was awesome. She worked in many areas including the kitchen and it showed with her knowledge of the food and menu.  My boyfriend wanted the classic cheeseburger and wedge salad. Both he said were great and since there was nothing left I'm confident he enjoyed it.  I was in a snacky mood and decided on nachos (which were no longer on the menu) but was truly happy with my selection.  Although I probably should have stopped eating them I couldn't. Fresh tomatoes, green onions, black olives and cilantro and cheese was great!!  yummy"
Tonya F.,"Indian Rocks Beach, FL",12,9,9,4.0,7/8/2015,The chicken tortilla soup was tasty but I never found any chicken. The clam chowder was very good!
Beverly G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,16,1,3.0,12/4/2016,"One of the chains had a long wait on an evening night, so we went down the street and ended up at BJ's.  The service was prompt, friendly and efficient. The pink tickler? (not sure if this is the right name) was strong and tasty. For an appetizer, we had the fried portobello mushroom strips: a bit too much batter, but good. We ordered the quinoa bowl with salmon, a full rack of ribs dinner, and a steak dinner. The quinoa and salmon was tasty, the steak perfectly cooked. The sides were nice additions to the meal: cheddar mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts, asparagus. The ribs were as good as most that we have had, the only problem was..... Dunno if this was a genuine oversight or mistake, or intentional: but,we were originally served only a HALF RACK of the ribs. WTF???When questioned, the waitress did bring us another half rack of the ribs, but... all I can say is wow. As mentioned, the ribs were good but, still...."
Jean T.,"St. Petersburg, FL",1,12,3,4.0,5/4/2016,It's a well managed corporate restaurant. They have good offers for email members. Our server was spot on on refills and timing overall. Very friendly and polite. I was impressed to see always 2 managers with eyes on the whole room to make sure it was moving properly.
Eric R.,"St Petersburg, FL",62,82,38,4.0,4/10/2015,"This is my go-to brewpub in north St. Peterburg. The menu features standard Americana, but it's the beer department where they really shine. The staff is always friendly, but the food always takes a while to come out. Their take out service is very efficient. I recommend it."
Brett N.,"Tampa, FL",2528,1899,1919,4.0,10/14/2013,"Why 4 stars? Because it's a good menu. And thorough.    ---   ---   --- Big Lebowski is so quotable... sometimes I just can't resist, even if it's a bit of a reach. I never stopped in to BJ's, as I assumed it was more along the lines of all the other sporty, general-menu chains. Well, it's not. BJ's seems to meet the allusive combination of quality and quantity. Their menu is of the Cheesecake Factory variety, in that, it's a really expansive list of selections. And everything I had... was super solid. I was *this* close to ordering a pumpkin beer before I called an audible. and went with a diet Coke. I was trying to be healthy... and even kept myself in-check with an ahi tuna salad. I basically never order a salad at a restaurant... once I've decided to go out to eat, I'm almost always going to become a calorie intake machine.  My first experience in being a good kitty, was actually a pleasant surprise. The ahi tuna salad was amazing, and it felt incredible to resist temptation and eat clean. Then, the pizzokie happened. My dining partner is a regular at BJ's (TWSS) and shared her knowledge of the golden plate of food that is a pizzokie. It's a giant cookie in a deep dish pizza tray, covered with ice cream. And yes, it's better than a winning Powerball ticket. We had the macadamia nut, and it literally made me feel like a better human being. I'd say I felt bad for cheating on my diet, but it was so life-changing that it was worth it.  Bottom line: I feel like I need to visit BJ's many more times to get a full-grasp on the place. I tried my friend's pizza and it was out of this world. Some of the best pizza I've ever had. There's just so much menu, and so few cheat days..."
Perry A.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",83,22,2,5.0,3/25/2016,"My wife and I went to BJ's for dinner this Friday. I had the mahi tacos and my wife had the pita tacos. Both entrees were great we also had drinks and everything was great.  Kim our server in the bar area was very attentive, she made sure we were satisfied with everything. My wife and I will definitely be back to enjoy drinks and food. I really like this place !!!"
