Eric B.,"Watsontown, PA",6,22,10,5.0,9/3/2017,"This was our first time visit, never heard of BJ'S before. Sunday visit around 1pm, the place was about half full. The menu is HUGE!!!  We saw allot that looked appealing but my wife ordered the Crusted Chicken Parmesan and I ordered the special, Prime Rib. We both got the same sides- White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli. My meal came with a salad, I picked a Caesar Salad. The salad was decent, I've had a few better but it was good and I enjoyed it, it was just a salad. Meals came quickly, hot and large portions, large enough for us to have leftovers! Both were VERY tasty.  The Chicken was tender and flavorful.  The Prime Rib was equally tender, well seasoned and excellent cut with little fat.  Saving room for dessert, we got the Triple Chocolate Pizookie...fancy word for a large baked cookie, topped with chocolate ice cream.  It was also very good and we like the dessert.  Prices were decent, nothing outrageous, so wet felt we got our monies worth.  The place was clean and in good shape.  Service was good, people were mostly friendly, with our server being pretty attentive. The Greeter could've been a little more friendly or positive when we walked thru the door.  Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and food and will be back to try something else on their large menu."
Shannon D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",12,38,52,3.0,8/7/2017,"Mediocre food/ sloppy service I really wanted to like this place. It looks like a neat brewery but is more like a generic chain. Too bad because I miss Gordon Bierch's beer since moving to Pittsburgh...BJ's is not an equivalent substitute.  We went on 2 separate occasions...both times the restaurant was busy and there was a wait for our table.  Our waiter on the 1st visit was slow to take our order and slow to bring our food. The table next to us ordered after us but was already on dessert while we were looking for drink refills. Their waiter checked on them more often.  Food was okay. I had a salad with grilled salmon. The salmon was a tail section and over cooked so a bit dry. We tried a few of their drafts. I liked the brown ale ""Nutty Brewnette."" Our waitress on the second visit didn't know much about the menu. My husband asked questions and then didn't get what he thought he was going to get. I was trying to avoid a cocktail with pre made mix but ended up with a sickeningly sweet one.  With so many options around, we might skip this franchise in future."
Susan T.,"Monroeville, PA",79,419,861,4.0,7/12/2017,"Get yourself to BJs. Because the food is that good.  There is something for every person in your group, from picky to somewhat exotic... Seriously: every person! We had Brussel Sprouts and salads and we looked around at what was walking past our table to other destinations and realized that all pizza is clearly NOT made the same.  It was our remorse - that we didn't get pizza.  Hard to do when everything sounds great. Our server helped us a lot in our selections and did not steer us wrong.  However, he was a better concierge than he was a server.  Very personable, not so much on the plate removal, drink refill, meal inquiry. Parking is great, restrooms are clean. One HUGE pet peeve of mine:  the need to give my cell phone for seating.  You get my cell number, I get a welcome text - which I don't want.  Then I get a your-table-is-ready text while looking at the host/hostess...  right there - hey! whatcha doing!?  Human beings over here!  Look, Look!  Sorry that this is becoming a rant here Yelpers, but for pity's sake make eye contact and act like a host/hostess - not a technician!  I know:  Corporate progress, cutting edge stuff..."
Darryl D.,"Wexford, PA",5,33,13,5.0,1/1/2018,"Well...... it's been two months since I last wrote a review about BJ's and I must say it was worth the wait. We stopped in Friday the 29th for dinner and I must say, everything was fantastic!  The greeters were pleasant and out preferred waitlist app worked well and out table was waiting when we arrived. Our server Nicole was one of the best I've ever had. Always there to refill a drink or remove a dish that was no longer needed and just a pleasant person that made you feel at home.  Everyone in our party was very pleased with their dinner selections and my roasted double pork chop was, without question, the best pork chop on earth!  We can't wait to return for another great dinner."
Andrea S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",46,75,117,3.0,10/25/2017,"I really like the concept of this place. It's a newer chain restaraunt that seems like a more modern Applebees. They have an extensive beer list & a decent amount of cocktails. The food menu is HUGE & I think they can afford to downsize. I think it's weird that a large portion of the menu is for lunch hours only. There are more vegetarian options for lunch than for dinner. They have a space on their menu that says, ""We have LOTS of vegetarian options, ask your waiter what meals can be made into vegetarian options"". I wish that they had a leaf marker on Vegetarian/Vegan options like most other places do to make it easier for the customer. Food quality isn't too notch, but it is what you'd expect from a chain restaraunt. Nothing great, nothing terrible."
Rosa A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",43,31,23,5.0,12/4/2017,"I'm not sure how I've never reviewed BJ's because pizza is one of my favorite things, and I love going there! I've been to this BJs and also the one at South Hills Village many times. Only once did I order something other than pizza (I believe it was tacos!). My boyfriend and I loveeee the pizza. I usually get a small (for myself) because I like to take a few pieces for leftovers! My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza, my boyfriend's is the classic combo. The chicken bacon ranch and bbq chicken are also good contenders. Tonight I tried the Great White, which had Alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes. So good!! We've always had really friendly service at both locations and the beer they have on tap is pretty excellent too!"
Sammi A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",58,28,40,5.0,11/21/2017,Came in here for lunch. I had the flat bread and soup. It was really good. Took awhile to get our food but other than that everything was good. Decided to get dessert and holy moly!!! This was crazy good. Be sure to get a dessert if you go!
Laura C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",32,44,239,3.0,1/14/2017,"This review is just about the food at BJ's as we got it to go. I have eaten inside as well and the service was normal in attention and speed.  We got the avocado egg rolls for appetizer and that tasted strange to me - not off but just having avocado in a dish that was warmer seemed strange to me like it needed to be eaten chilled. The taste of the avocado egg rolls was not to my liking, either, not being able to make out the avocado and chicken components. I also got the in-house root beer which I rate at 6 our of 10 on my scale, and it had a strong licorice flavor. For entrees, my husband got the baked ziti and that is just as you'd expect with a nice flavor to the tomato sauce and a nice bite to the pasta. I ordered the fish and chips and it came with string fries which were very good. The breading was light and the fish had a great flavor. I will be ordering that again.  Finally, for dessert we ordered the peanut butter pizookie as I've had it before and it's always delicious."
Olivia A.,"Allison Park, Allison Park, PA",12,48,54,5.0,10/9/2017,"Checked out BJ's for happy hour. They have great happy hour deals and their pumpkin beer is delicious. Not too sweet but a nice subtitle pumpkin flavor. Best of all the bartender gave us the courtesy of asking if we needed anything else before happy hour ends. Thanks, Darnell!"
Harold P.,"Murrysville, PA",0,4,,2.0,12/10/2017,"My wife and I visited this restaurant for lunch Saturday, December 9 , 2017. We were able to get a table easily. The restaurant has a pleasant contemporay vibe. The decor is modern-bland, but totally acceptable.  We looked at the beer menu, and found it to be overpriced with 16oz setting you back +$6. Beer from other breweries were similarly priced. So, they have elected to overcharge for their own brews, favoring high profit margin over promoting their own brand. Compare this to 16oz at my local Rivertowne brewery for $3.50. Wine prices are average. A glass of Kendall Jackson chardonnay is priced in the mid $9 range. Food: we elected to split a California Chicken Club Sandwich (our appetites aren't what they were in our 20's). The sandwich arrived promptly, and that is where the good experience ended. It looked fine on top. I bit into my sandwich to encounter a bitter taste. I turned the sandwich over to discover that the bottom of the sandwich was totally black ... having been carbonized to a uniform layer of glossy black charcoal. I considered sending it back, but time constraints stopped us from doing. I wanted to take a picture, but my hands were so covered in grease at this point, I didn't want to reach into my pocket for my phone ... anyway, to visualize it, think of the glossy sheen of Darth Vader's helmet. I scraped the charcoal off the sandwich, my wife simply discarded her burned bread, and found the remaining product to be tasteless and bland. We will not be returning to this restaurant. They obviously have poor quality control, and there are plenty of better choices for your restaurant dollars."
Briana B.,"Mansfield, PA",14,16,25,5.0,6/23/2017,"Food was delicious! Much better than I expected based on the reviews. My boyfriend and I came here on our cheat day and decided to go all out with drinks, the app combo, meals, and a pizookie. The server told us that if we signed up for the app, we get a free pizookie. We decided to sign up for the app but it turned out that only mini pizookies were in the special. He apologized and it's not a big deal, we probably wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't advertised to us though. Super delicious!"
Evan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,3.0,12/9/2017,"Solid Chain Restaurant, always great for late night food when many other places are closed."
Stacey B.,"West View, Pittsburgh, PA",59,88,78,3.0,12/3/2016,"BJs is a solid consistent casual place to dine.  It's always crowded for dinner and you can either get a pager and wait it out or try your luck scoping out one of the open bar or bar area table seats which are all first come first serve.  They have a nice selection of draft beer to choose from and brew some of their own tasty concoctions as well as featuring many mainstream local and national favorites.  We have one favorite dish on the menu that is hard to pass up.  It's the North Beach Mahi Mahi and Shrimp and it is so delicious.  It features black olive pieces, tomatoes, and pearl cous cous in the most delightful broth featuring an anise licorice flavor.  The fish is moist and meaty in texture and flakes easily.  It is just the right amount to fill you up but leave enough room for one of their delicious peanut butter and jelly pizookies.   This last visit we tried something new: golden asparagus with lemon aioli sauce.  It was good and fried.  I mean, who doesn't like fried, right?  This is a tempura-like batter that was a little thick in certain spots but very tasty.  The service is always good and efficient.  We often stop by for a late meal."
Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",354,768,3120,2.0,9/5/2016,I must admit that this is the 2nd BJs I have visited and I was a bit disappointed to learn that they are not alike. They APPEAR alike because this restaurant is an exact copy of the one I previously reviewed at South Hills Village. We had a 15 minute wait to be seated. I have the app but wasn't sure when the rest of our party would arrive so I did not reserve ahead of time. When you have to wait you give them your name and cell number so they can text you when they have a booth waiting for you. The menu and beers are identical to the South Hills one. I showed my waiter my rewards number on my phone so he took note of it. When you spend so much on a tier then you get a small reward. My son and daughter decided to split a large deep dish pizza since on Mondays pizza is half off. I went with my lunch portion of the thyme chicken I had before.  I sampled their pizza and it was very rich and quite filling. When I started my meal again I found it was not heated up. So I asked my waiter to heat it up which he did. Later I found the ice had melted in my tea so I had to wait a while to get a cup of ice to cool it down. The food is the same and was just enough for me. We decided to order the pizookies for dessert. This time I got the chocolate chunk mini and my kids got the chocolate cookie covered with ice cream for the dessert. As always they were very good. The waiter brought my check early and then when he added in the desserts I later found out that I was not awarded my points for this visit. I found that out after we left so I called over there and spoke to a manager. He told me he would credit the points to my account but it would take a few days. Normally when I ate at the one in the South Hills I would get an email immediately . He told me this wasn't the case. This BJs sits in a strip mall which is part of McCandless crossing. I also learned during this visit that they are planning on building a third location out in Robinson. My guess would be Settler's Ridge but time will tell if it will go there or among the restaurants near the mall of Robinson. They also plan to build one in Cranberry as well.
Rachael G.,"Seven Fields, PA",115,58,22,4.0,2/15/2017,"I really like BJs brewhouse. They have a good menu with a ton of options so you are sure to find something you like. I went with a big group and it took quite a while to be seated, although we expected it being 6pm on a Saturday night. They have a nice bar so you can pass the time there until your table is ready, this is always a plus when we go out. It is a bit loud, but it's such a large space, I wouldn't say that it was detrimental to the conversations.  They have a huge beer menu, and a great cocktail menu as well.  The servers are all very friendly and helpful and it was a good experience over all."
Jamie D.,"Cranberry Township, PA",139,76,8,3.0,1/2/2017,"Nice chain restaurant tucked away in McCandless Crossing. American fare with very little imagination.  If you're a beer drinker then BJ's was built with you in mind.  Little impressed me about their food selection, but they have an enormous beer/cider selection.  Not being much of a drinker, the best I could muster was three stars. The waitstaff wasn't great, the food was unimaginative, but what I ate tasted pretty good.  They did mediocre exceptionally well. Good for groups, kids, but the parking is awful.  They share a lot with a grocery store and another restaurant. Expect to walk a pretty good distance from your car to the door, and if it's calling for rain - bring an umbrella.  It's a hike."
Adam S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",44,25,6,2.0,9/11/2017,"This is one of those places that's all over the place and has no idea what it wants to be. Huge menu with a little bit of everything for everyone. They do a lot of things just ok but don't anything very well. Ribs were dry and over cooked and not very tender. Mashed potatoes were bland and cold. Asparagus pasta was bland and completely forgettable. Probably the biggest disappointment was the draft beer. I tried two selections and both came out with that sour, metallic-tasting, semi-flat taste that is probably caused by dirty lines, incorrect temperature, improper co2 regulation etc. It was so bad and skunky that I didn't finish my second beer. I wouldn't recommend nor would I go back."
K W.,"Allison Park, Allison Park, PA",0,14,1,4.0,10/21/2017,I've been here a couple times and I would go back. I gave it 4 stars because whenever we order something med it usually comes out very over done. But service is always nice and friendly. take out is always good as well.
Paul K.,"Irwin, PA",32,68,11,5.0,4/10/2017,"Our friend highly recommended this place, and it lived up to every expectation. The food was reasonably priced and the portions were great! The burger we ordered was delicious, and the deep dish pizza was fantastic! We did not try a pizookie, but they looked delicious. The service was great and the staff was friendly. The atmosphere was great as well. We did not try there brews, but they had many special beers on tap from local breweries as well. I would highly recommend them!"
Dave V.,"Harmony, PA",55,110,44,4.0,4/5/2017,"Every time I have ever visited a BJ's the experience has been a wonderful one.  Their beer is awesome, the food is well prepared, and the service is always friendly and prompt.  When I want to just step out of the world for a few, have a few beers, and enjoy a good meal .... I come here ....."
Mark M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,9,1,4.0,7/9/2017,"This.  is the second time my wife and I were here and both times we sat at the bar and had excellent service. First time, I had Jambalaya (second only to Emerils in Miami) and she had wings. Decent wings, leave it at that. Today we went. She had Calamari...decent calamari, leave it at that. I had the chicken fried burger...Amazing. Light breading on the burger, awesome black pepper gravy, fresh avocado, perfectly fried egg. I mean, come on...what's not to love?  Both times, Darnell at the bar has provided amazing service and recommendations. Oh, and anyone that has had the pizookie..Forget about it. Only question is, which pizookie is most amazing? ..Macadamia nut pizookie is OFF THE HOOK. Love this place and will be back."
Clemustine S.,"Coraopolis, PA",0,5,9,1.0,8/18/2017,"This review has nothing to do with food because I did not eat here, but once you read the review I hope you understand the reasoning.  My in-laws were in for the week and on their first night we decided to try BJs because we are also new to the area . We called to place our name on the call ahead list. I called and asked if we could be added to the list at 6:30. The call to be placed on the list was took place at 5:35. We got to the restaurant at 6:25 and said we were on the list for 6:30.  The hostesses then proceeded to tell us it would still be a 50-60 wait! I was shocked ! I had a 3 year old in the party. I wouldn't have been upset had they told us this when we called, but there was NOTHING said in the initial call.  Give us the opportunity to choose to be there and get the chance to eat someone else. This was horrible."
Tricia B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",53,202,264,3.0,8/3/2016,"Yelpers, you seem to have this one right on the money. Three stars is a pretty accurate rating for this middling restaurant. We came here with some friends the other night. In general, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I try to keep an open mind. Chain or not, if a restaurant has good food and service, I'm game.  Unfortunately, BJ's Brewhouse doesn't excel in either food or service. On the Saturday night we were there, it was quite busy, and apparently is usually that way. With so many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, I can't quite understand why, but some mysteries of the universe don't have a good answer. We grabbed drinks and an appetizer at the bar while we waited for our table. Our appetizer, the chips with sriracha queso dip, arrived quickly, but it was lukewarm. Lukewarm food is always a punishable crime, but it gets elevated from misdemeanor to felony any time cheese is involved. Because it wasn't hot enough, the queso was thick and semi-coagulated...quite unappealing. Also, despite its name, there was no sriracha flavor in the queso at all (which was so disappointing, as I love me some sriracha).  Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to refresh our bar drinks and take our order. And unfortunately, it was this way throughout most of our meal...our server was largely absent, and we had to repeatedly flag him down when we needed something. As for our food, we all ordered different things, with mixed results. One friend ordered fried artichokes, tomato soup, and a mozzarella and tomato salad. She reported that the soup and salad were good....fairly standard (as she pointed out, it's pretty hard to mess up tomato soup and mozzarella salad). The fried artichokes, however, were disappointing in that they didn't have any discernible artichoke in them....she said they pretty much just tasted like fried breading. Another friend got the spinach-stuffed mushrooms and thought they were tasty. My husband got the California Chicken Club, which came with a mountain of fries. He thought the sandwich was way too greasy. The bread was very heavily buttered, which made this light-sounding sandwich much heavier than it needed to be. I tried a few of his fries and they were decent....very thin cut and crispy. As for me, I opted for boneless wings with Peppered BBQ sauce. The portion of wings was HUGE....I clearly failed to notice the menu description stated that it was a pound of wings. Uh, whoops. A pound of fried anything for dinner is never well-advised. So needless to say, a doggie bag was needed. The wings themselves were crispy and meaty (thumbs up), but unfortunately there was barely any sauce on them (thumbs down). I wanted to ask for more sauce, but couldn't find our server. So most of the wings I ate were dry and largely devoid of flavor. Total bummer! As for drinks and dessert....my one friend ordered a watermelon basil margarita and found it to be sweet to the point of being undrinkable. To our server's credit, once we flagged him down and told him that she wanted a beer instead, he took the drink back and didn't charge her for it, so that was good. My husband ordered a couple of their porters and thought they were okay, but was expecting more from a place that brews its own beer. For dessert, we of course had to try their famous pizookie, which is a freshly-baked cookie with ice cream on top. We shared the pizzokie trio so we could try several flavors (we chose salted caramel, cookies and cream, and peanut butter). My friends went nuts over the pizookies and thought they were insanely delicious. Personally, while I thought they were good (I mean, you almost have to actively *try* to make anything with cookies and ice cream taste bad, right?), I thought in general they were a bit too sweet and the individual flavors of each pizookie were drowned out in the overload of sugar. So all three mostly ended up just tasting like generic cookie with generic ice cream to me. Also, the edges of the cookies were overcooked to the point where it created a very unpleasant tough texture in those spots. I dunno...I guess I fancy myself a bit of a dessert snob, so when something is hyped up to the extent the famous pizookie is, I expect it to deliver. This was just so-so for me (but again, my friends loved it, so different strokes). The above rambling dissertation essentially boils down to the fact that BJ's is quite average across the board. While it's not terrible, it's not a place that I will seek out, and it's certainly not worth waiting for on a busy Saturday night. Go elsewhere, my hungry friends."
Robyn S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,1.0,9/23/2017,"The bartender and wait staff were very nice and professional.I had ONE drink at the bar, then we were seated, The manager at first seemed friendly, we spoke about the restaurant business in general, It was my daughter.s birthday, and she said it was her favorite restaurant, Again, I had one beverage and asked for a glass  of wine with dinner. He claimed that I was slurring my words and appeared drunk. He is 25 years old, and has no clue what a drunk individual looks like. My friend was so intoxicated that I drove him home.  He had 5 beers, but was not questioned at all. I think this MANAGER is possibly a woman hater or something. As a former manager and owner of restaurants, I know what a liability it can be,  He ruined our evening, BTW I have a medical condition that prohibits me from having more than two beverages. Also said my eyes were dialed. Yes, they were, I had drops in them as I had poison ivy in my eyes and lots of other places. It is a shame that the staff is very good, and ruined by this manager"
Jen C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,101,7,3.0,9/12/2016,"I went here for lunch during the week with some co-workers.  I thought BJ's is incredibly clean and the server was really attentive. The interior is fun and the lighting of the bottles on the bar created a really cool atmosphere. I ordered the Mini One Topping Pizza with a side salad.  It was only $7.50 which I thought was an awesome lunch time deal.  I wasn't really thrilled, though.  It's a deep dish pizza, which is fine, but it just felt so...messy.  I ate it with a fork and knife because that was the only option, but even then I didn't feel like I could enjoy it.  I didn't know anything about BJ's prior to the day of, but as a chain restaurant it definitely has that chain restaurant food taste.  So I wouldn't expect much more than that. We also all commented on the loud echo in the restaurant.  There weren't many people there, but everything reverberated. I don't drink but there was a massive board with a list of beers.  If you're a beer drinker, this really wouldn't be a bad place to go to sit and hang with friends over a couple of beers."
Natalie M.,"Tavares, FL",0,11,2,4.0,7/14/2017,"I want to start off by saying I don't understand why this is only rated 3 stars. I've been here 3 times, and every time was enjoyable. The menu is huge so selecting your meal can get a little difficult. I've always had a great waitress, but the one I had the most recent time was the best. Her name was Alexis, and she anticipated everything we wanted. She always had drinks coming, was able to easily split the check, and was super friendly. I was in a group of 5, but she managed to stay on top of everything. We really enjoyed ourselves and are excited to go back again."
lindsay d.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,27,,4.0,6/18/2017,"I don't think the reviews on here do this place justice. Good beer, good food from beginning to end. Very good service every time I've been there, along with friendly waitstaff. The steak was done how I wanted, and the side veggies were flavorful. Was it unique, per se? Not really, but the food is consistently good and filling, the staff is consistently on point, and that's just fine with me. My favorite beer is the porter, and make sure to save room for a pizookie! If you're unsure, get the sampler. They're all delicious."
Michael A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,16,,2.0,7/28/2017,"Really bad food!  The mini pizzas were nasty!  Had the barbecue and it was LOADED with BBQ sauce!  Basically a 6"" round pizza deep dish with a load of BBQ sauce squirted in top! Provolone sticks were dry and they had a bad texture.  Really just not great food! Highly disappointed and I will never go back!"
Meghan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",183,474,736,4.0,1/13/2017,"I came here for a day lunch date with my friend and we had an awesome time. We sat at the bar, had great service the entire time and really enjoyed our food and drinks. We tried about 8 different beers from BJ's and I liked them all! Their seasonal double IPA was super delicious, and their stouts were really tasty as well. For food, we ordered a couple small items- the fried portabella strips appetizer, the Brussels sprouts appetizer and a small Hawaiian pizza with habanero added (the bartenders recommendation). Everything was great- the portabella strips were juicy and the sauce that came with them were so complimenting. The Brussels sprouts were just as good, although I would have preferred if the sauce came on the side, rather than them swimming in the sauce. Regardless, the sauce was REALLY tasty. The pizza was super delicious, although I didn't really notice a spicy kick at all from the habanero. Just when I thought we were done eating, my friend ordered the ahi tuna appetizer. This was the first time I had ever tried raw tuna... and I really liked it. It was fresh, and the portion was pretty generous as well. Overall- we really enjoyed our afternoon here and I am looking forward to coming back for dinner sometime."
Lauren O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",73,70,5,3.0,7/11/2016,"Service was great, food was just okay. We started at the bar and had a few drinks before being taken to our table by the friendly hostess.  We ordered the lettuce wraps. They were pretty good, but there was not enough filling for all of the lettuce they gave us (I am talking about a scoop per lettuce piece if even that). Tasted pretty good though, but nothing spectacular.  As a main ordered the barbacoa bowl and my husband had the fish tacos. The bowl was okay but extremely salty. I probably shouldn't have ordered that at a place like this (I should just stick to chipotle for that stuff). My husband said the fish tacos were just average. Maybe we should have stuck to their pizza or burgers thought.  I ordered their peach beer which I enjoyed as well.  Overall, average food, good beer selection, great place to watch a game. We would give this place another go."
Amy R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",69,262,13,3.0,1/6/2017,"We get take out often from here, and the menu is sort of hit and miss for take out.   So far, we have found that the deep dish pizza, the tortilla soup, the pot stickers, the burgers, the chicken lettuce wraps, and the root beer ribs are great!   Not so great - wings of any kind (always soggy!) and the flat bread pizza (does not travel well). I love their homemade cream sodas too!"
Gary R.,"Chicago, IL",80,476,1056,2.0,8/16/2015,"Ok, I've given this place a couple of chances. Here's the bottom line. Atmosphere is comfy with a very nice bar area. The beer is good. The food is mediocre. The service is abysmal. My advice if you're determined to come here? Sit at the bar and don't get food. Just order beer. You have half a chance of actually enjoying it.  This time we got there 10 minutes after they opened for a pre-movie lunch. 35 minutes later all I had was a water, nearly empty. There were no more than 5-6 other people in there. There were at least 10 servers, 6 of whom yakked it up in one corner and didn't move the entire time we were there. Ok, maybe there was a meeting. If so, I hope it was about how crappy the service is and what they need to do to fix it. But I doubt it.  The food is just ok. The fries are so skinny it's like what's left over from the potato after the real restaurants take what they need. And they are not good. Burger was ok but I've had better at most bars. Yeah, I've had way better. And without the disaster that is their service. Don't look for me here. I'll be somewhere where the food tastes great and customer service actually means something."
Mac R.,"Chicago, IL",162,344,841,3.0,8/16/2015,"We've eaten here twice now and I've definitely formed an opinion. BJs is a chain restaurant with a decent concept of large beer selections (many their own house brews) & a huge menu with so many options that seem to be executed in a very average way. Not bad but nothing that would ever wow you. And like many chain restaurants you get inconsistencies in service from a very large staff.  Their Hopstorm IPA is pretty solid and at $3.50 a glass at lunchtime one day, we were pleased. Their lunchtime BBQ plate was very reasonably priced under $7 and plenty of food but the pulled pork slider & BBQ chicken breast were average tasting fare. I'd describe the pesto chicken sandwich I had today exactly in those same terms with the addition today of slow service to go with it.  We definitely had better service last time at the bar than at a table today. There seemed to be lots of servers running around & standing around but very few people getting food.  I've heard this place has been super busy with long wait times. Today it was nearly empty and we had a long wait - well over 30 minutes for lunch to arrive. Something to definitely keep in mind."
Kim H.,Cranberry Township,2,67,7,3.0,6/19/2017,"We ate a late lunch around 2PM in the bar.  The bar was almost empty that time of day.  The restaurant dining area wasn't crowded either.  I ordered a salad with shrimp and quinoa.  My husband got a crispy chicken salad.  The service was slow.  When we finally got our food, they brought out my salad with salmon on it....not the shrimp which I ordered.  So then I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The salad was good.  I like the large menu.  Plenty of choices.  Even with as little people there, the place is noisy.  Kind of hit and miss there as I ate there awhile back and they got my order right."
Brenda G.,"Sewickley, PA",17,13,,2.0,5/6/2017,"Now this is a ""hit or miss"" place!  If you have plenty of time to spare then you are OK; but if you try to go there and then a movie - forget about it!  We have had good experiences and not so great!  My hubby does like some of their brews though so a thumbs up for that.  I hate to send negative reviews but sometimes you just have to be honest and tell it like it is!  (-:"
Steph K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",28,79,109,1.0,2/18/2016,"Came here for happy hour and dinner with a friend - attempting to give it one last go.  The one star rating is for our excellent, friendly and attentive waitress. She was great and by no means does she deserve a one star. The peanut butter s'mores pizookie was also quite good - albeit a bit sickeningly sweet.  I don't even know how this many bad things  are possible in one meal, but it happened -gritty guacamole with an overwhelming and strange sour flavor in it (are they squeezing a fresh lime into this?), lip puckering levels of salt on tortilla chips, a ""porter"" beer that was like a watery, flavorless, and flat soft drink and of course the ""star"" of this evenings failure - the 14.95 ahi tuna salad - about 6 pieces of 1 inch tuna and some greens with giant tomato chunks and greasy wonton strips all soaked to death in the most disgusting dressing I have ever tasted. To top it off my salad bowl was covered with some inexplicable green powder sprinkle that also tasted bad - I ate the tuna squares and left the rest. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I have left a full plate in a restaurant and unfortunately tonight was one of them.  So disappointing. Sadly, I can't see myself ever seeking this place out as a choice I will ever want to spend my money at. Third time was a charm for me."
Amanda M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,20,,2.0,2/23/2017,"I have eaten here a few times and am unimpressed. We've had a very bad experience one of the times, which the manager made good on by comping some of our meals, giving us a free dessert, and a $50 gift card. However, while the next visit was better, it wasn't anything special."
Bob L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,17,,1.0,7/28/2017,"I am an HR professional working at the headquarters of a national company located about a mile away from this restaurant. Part of my job requires me to cater lunches for visitors to our office which can be a challenge in the North Hills. On Tuesday, July 25, 2017, I decided to give BJ's a try for a take out lunch for seven. As is my preferred practice for these events, I placed the order online, but was surprised that no payment was requested. A few moments later, I received an order confirmation email with an online payment link. Upon clicking the link, an error message pops up that online payments are not accepted via the link until 15 minutes before order is ready. I waited until 15 minutes prior and entered my payment into system. I then received online confirmation of my payment and requested an email receipt which was received shortly thereafter. Upon arrival at the restaurant, the server putting my order together claims no payment was showing. I advised that I paid online. The server goes into the back and brings out Junior Joe Manager who restates the same. I advised him that I paid online and will not pay twice. Junior Joe states no payment received so I tell him to have a nice lunch, turn and begin to leave. Junior Joe states that if I leave he will call police because I ordered food and did not pay for it. I advise again that I paid online and I will not pay twice. Junior Joe states he will not tolerate my aggressive behavior and I must leave. I gladly left without food never to return again. Upon arrival back at the office, I called BJ's corporate office in California and explained situation. Tiffany stated she would investigate, make sure payment is credited and call back. No call, email, fax, telegram or carrier pigeon has been received. As someone who understands the challenges of having employees with diverse skillsets, I normally would recommend a thorough program of retraining for Junior Joe. However, given the serious nature of this incident threatening legal action against a customer, termination is absolutely justified. In addition, I strongly recommend staying away from online payments at this place because clearly they have issues which border on a scam that they are unwilling to address with their payment processor. Personally, I will just stay away from BJ's altogether and continue to purchase from competent restaurants that appreciate my company's business. The ""F"" rating BJ's has earned with the Better Business Bureau is very well-deserved in my opinion."
Mady M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",39,3,,5.0,6/12/2017,"Wonderful restruant! I come here with my family for special occasions and it is perfect. There is lots of choices in alcoholic beverages for the adults, but they also have fresh brewed soda off the tap! Lots of choices as far as eating goes. I've gotten the brewhouse burger (Great with buffalo sauced dumped on top), and the buffalo chicken pizza. Pizza here is greasy, but I don't mind so that didn't change my opinion on the pizza. The pizookie is really neat too. Warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top- completes any meal!!"
Randy M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",10,6,,3.0,9/11/2016,"BJ's has been around for a while, and I've always wanted to go.  I don't eat at chain restaurants often, but every once in a while I do.  Their specialty is pizza and beer, and I was expecting a lot from BJ's and came away not impressed, but it wasn't awful. The good: The fried portabella fritters were awesome.  They were crunchy with a lot of breading, but there was a lot of portabella in each fritter.  Dip it in ranch dressing and it's a match made in heaven.   The pizza crust was excellent.  It was a deep dish pizza  and the crust was light, fluffy, and buttery. The bad: I got the BJ's Classic Combo pizza, which contained mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, and pepperoni.  The sausage was okay, but could have been better and lacked flavor(needed more fennel).  The mozzarella was actually pretty good.  What killed the pizza for me was the pepperoni.  The pepperoni looked like it came from the supermarket and was not high quality to me.  If I'm going to pay 15 bucks for a small pizza, I want to have quality ingredients all around.   Overall, the food was okay.  They need to get better pepperoni."
