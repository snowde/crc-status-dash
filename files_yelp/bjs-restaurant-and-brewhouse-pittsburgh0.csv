Jody F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",39,8,,4.0,10/6/2015,Great sports bar! Food and service were wonderful! Try the calamari and any salad! Great selection of beers as well!
Brian M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,5.0,10/3/2015,This place was great.  Food and service.  Wait time may have been an issue but got in just before dinner rush.
Jamie R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",162,4,,1.0,8/25/2015,"As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were greeted by a scowl. I, the guest, was smiling at the ""Hostess"" while she continued to scowl at me and then asked, how many? No hello, no welcome, nothing. I told her 2 and she said there would be a 15 minute wait and tried talking us into the bar area. I kindly declined and told her we would wait for a table. The hostess then shoved the number pad at us and demanded a phone number & name. Wow, was this woman rude. As a ""Host"" you're the first person your guest sees and should be greeting each person with a welcoming smile. Didn't happen for us. This particular host must of had a problem with us because she then said hello and smiled at every person from us on. Can you say petty? Be professional, this isn't high school. Our server was super weeded in her section and looked so confused the entire time we were there. Food runners ran our appetizer and salads on top of each other and when our food came shortly after our app & salad, the food runner did not clear the plates. Drop and go must be BJs thing. Our stuffed mushrooms were cold and my califronia chicken sandwich was burnt. I used to love BJs down south, but this experience has ruined my love for your restaurant. The thing is, your food is still good and consistent...but I will never come back because your staff is sub par and has affected my experience tremendously. My suggestion is get better servers, hosts, and food runners because you guys have it all wrong with all the wrong people. Indulging guests is easy with quality people that care for their craft."
Vanessa S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,,3.0,7/23/2015,"The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a promising menu. I was disappointed by some of their beer they made, it tasted like water. Also the pizza was small and overpriced. I'll give it another chance but not that great."
Ann S.,"Hampton Township, PA",0,1,,4.0,7/5/2015,The restaurant seemed to be clean and there was no wait time to be seated on a busy afternoon. The menu for food and beverages is extensive with suggested pairings. The prices seemed to be very reasonable. I ordered the black and blue-house burger and it was absolutely wonderful. They also give you a ton of fries with your order. The people next to us had a problem with their food order and the manager came out and fixed the problem right away. I look forward to returning to try other items.
Justin E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",39,46,,2.0,7/31/2015,"For a chain I'm a big fan. Keep in mind that it's nothing super unique and more like Cheesecake Factory than anything else. Along those lines, it has a huge menu but focuses on pizza and burgers which I like. They have some entrees of course but they aren't trying to do every single type of food out there.  The place is very large and can accommodate large parties well, but does get busy. Servers are good and the prices are pretty standard.  They have a large bar and a ton of beer on tap. Food-wise the pizza was great with tons of different types and sizes all the way down to mini. The apps were great too, stuffed mushrooms and all the different fried ones were cooked very well. They even have their own brews and can do flights and pitchers of all the different types they make.  This disappointing thing about this location and why I took away two-stars is because they don't brew their own beer like all of their sister locations.  WTF - C'mon!  This is the whole reason I go to BJ's over competitors.  I won't go back to this location."
Matt G.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,3,,1.0,1/17/2016,my girlfriend and I made reservations on Saturday 1-16 on their mobile app because we know they are very busy on Saturdays.  the app told us 35 minute wait which was perfect because that's about how long of a drive we had.  when we arrived we gave out name and they asked to see the reservation on my girlfriends phone.  the host told us that we made it for their other Pittsburgh location and that we had to wait many hours to get put in as a walk in.  we left at that point t.        after thinking on the way home I couldn't imagine where their other location was at so I checked online and couldn't find one.  I called the restaurant and a woman rudely answered and said their app is all messed up and it never works right. my thought is  so why have it?   anyway she told me there is not another one in Pittsburgh.  so an hour and a half of driving for nothing.  personally I don't think it's worth the wait and hassle.
Jay V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",13,13,,1.0,4/23/2016,"worst BJ'Sever.. i've been to bj's many times but this was the worst.. we ordered 2 beer and 1 single malt. waitress took the order and came back after 10 minutes and said they do not have one of the beer and asked to change the order (and she didn't bring the other2 drinks!). came back after 10 minutes with 2 beers but not the single malt saying they don't have that one! i changed the selection and it took another 10 minutes to come back with same answer  (they don't have that one either!!) i asked her to bring any single malt they have but to make it quick..she came with chevas regal (not a single malt!!! c'mon bar tender suppose to know it!!) i took it since it was almost 30 minutes wait for the first drink. we decided to order all the appetizers n food at once so we don't have to wait.. food came fast, but no silver wear and no napkins! ! we had to remind that we don't have anything on the table.. food was worst..highly disappointed."
