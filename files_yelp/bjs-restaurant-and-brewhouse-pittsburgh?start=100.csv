David K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",85,54,35,4.0,4/21/2016,"Been here a few times now. First couple visits you couldn't go without waiting 30 plus minutes. Now that it's been open for a few months the crowds have died down especially with Burgatory opening next door. Anyway, this place has a large seating area with a bunch of televisions. They have homemade Root Beer, orange soda, cream soda, etc. The root beer is really good. As far as the food the pizza is very solid and the burgers aren't bad. My favorite though is the balsamic glazed chicken (pictured below). It comes with mixed greens, onion straws and mashed potatoes. You get two decent sized pieces of grilled chicken smothered with balsamic vinaigrette and covered with the onion staws. It's the perfect portion that will make you comfortable full but still have room for desert. I would recommend this dish. The desert are amazing. They have P-Zookies cookies fried with ice cream on top that are to die for. Service has always been exceptional. One of my new favorite spots to go."
Rebecca G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",166,455,80,1.0,7/12/2015,"So, I want to like this place, the food wasn't bad, the beer wasn't bad, but nothing I ordered came out correctly. Nothing! I got salad without bacon, came out with bacon. Veggie burger on lettuce, came out a turkey burger on a bun. Not only that, but 5 of the 8 orders at our table were incorrect in one way or another. Then the manager comes over and jokes about the fact that me and one other person don't have any food because they made it wrong. Everyone was done eating by the time we got our food, and bedside joking about it he didn't formally apologize, take money off of the bill, or check to make sure that the food that came out was correct. Really really bad management and possible service?? Or the cooks don't follow directions??? Who knows..."
Christine T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,80,33,3.0,6/21/2016,This place is pretty close to home so I wanted to love it. They do have a nice selection of beer and their own beer is decent. But the 3 stars goes to their food. It looked really good but the taste was just mediocre. I was also disappointed that they don't have outdoor seating. I'll be back but probably just for drinks because there are better food options within walking distance.
Jason A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,12,,2.0,2/9/2017,As a server being served I wish I could have one person serving me. If you can't handle the pressure don't be in the biz. Why is every plate dirty? Drink runner?! LMAO!! Amateurs.....
JBaby S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,276,61,2.0,8/8/2016,Subpar franchise with generic music and watered down crappy cocktails . We've been there 3 times and had disappointments . It's for the masses without a palate
Jon C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,9,,5.0,2/3/2017,"Great food - truly very good.  Love the pizzas, both the tavern cut and the deep dish.  Excellent beer selection - they have their own brand as well as a good selection of craft beers."
D B.,"Freedom, PA",6,69,72,5.0,10/5/2015,"stopped in here on a ""lark"". this is an excellent spot for a beer and food. You would expect a superior array of unique brews, and they did not disappoint. I am a craft beer follower. This is as good a spot as I have ever been. We had nutty brunette- excellent1 good color, nose and great taste.  I am a successful weight watcher, having lost over 100 lbs! My choice was a ground turkey breast burger. It was excellent. Basically a hamburger without the fat. Cooked perfectly, and well presented. My wife had a basic burger, she is a gourmet cook, wand knows the difference between average and excellent. She proclaimed it excellent. What is unique is the pairing suggestions with each brew. We followed that suggestion. It was wonderful. The beer tastes better, and so did the food. They each enhanced the other. We will be back, and take some craft beer folks with us! I highly recommend this place. Go when you can have a nice brew with your meal. They do have a full bar for those that don't prefer beer. They had bourbons and other libations."
Dresden D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",107,9,3,3.0,7/23/2016,"I usually love BJ's, but today just wasn't all that great at this location. First time here, and I as greeted and sat immediately. But then it kinda went downhill. It took 10mins for a server to come to me, and I watched people get seated and drinks after I was sat down. My waitress barely said 20 words to me the whole time. Never really looked me in my eye. Whenever I said ""thank you"", she responded with ""mhm"". I got a strawberry mojito (which tasted amazing) but the guy who dropped it off did a moving drop - never stopped to place it at my table, just dropped it down and kept moving. I got a create your own pizza and the guy who dropped that off was much better. And placed it on my plate for me. I came around 2pm and they were pretty slow but got my food around 2:30. If I'm craving their pizza I'll go back, but I'd rather try a different location."
Zach R.,"McKnight, PA",51,22,1,3.0,5/25/2016,"Got a flatbread pizza which was good and a pulled pork sandwich which was just okay. Prices are a little high for the quality and quantity that you get. Dessert pizookies are delicious, but can't beat a Conley Cookie from Monte Cello's! I will probably come back not for the food, but to try their house craft beers. It seemed like they had a pretty wide selection."
Kristopher P.,"Gibsonia, PA",6,54,1,3.0,1/17/2016,"If I were able to, I would rate it 3.5 stars.  I thought it was a little better than okay but not great.  Our server didn't start off well as when our hostess was seating us, I overheard her say ""you better find someone else to take these tables cause I'm not doing it"".  That didn't exactly start if off right for us.  I was a party of 6 with my family so I was a little surprised to hear that on a Tuesday night that wasn't packed.  I would have thought this would be welcomed, but I guess I was wrong. Anyhow, the food was okay.  We got garlic parm wings to start and they weren't amazing.  I have had some that were amazing and these were okay.  The flavor was a little lacking but all in all okay.  Each of us got the hickory brisket burger.  I thought it was again average.  It sounded awesome on the menu, but the bbq flavor I tasted was more from the sauce than the brisket.  Again, a little better than average. So basically my experience was okay.  I would go back to see if it was more about our server rather than the total experience but also would like to try more menu items."
Dan M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,18,5,5.0,3/28/2016,"Been coming here since they opened. Always have a good meal and can't complain. The only thing that I had a problem with was, one time I had a burger and it was a lityle dry. But still really good.  You have to get the app so you have a clue in seat times or get in line ahead if time.  Beer cost are average. Pizza is the best around (my $0.02 of couse.) I can't figure out why the possible negative reviews. Lo g wait time yes but that's it. Most all places around are about the same wait. So I ignore those people. They are never happy."
Megan E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",31,35,1,3.0,3/12/2016,"They have great deep dish pizza, a huge menu, and large beer selection. But don't come here if you're in a hurry - service is usually slow, and in the couple times I've been it has taken 40 minutes to get my food. The last time they delivered one of our pizzas to the wrong table, so I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to eat. So not the best service, but good food."
A C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,12,,1.0,1/2/2017,"I've been to this restaurant 3 times.  I hope I don't have to go back again. The service is consistently bad, the food takes forever to be delivered to the table (45+ minutes average) and the food is average at best.  I honestly don't know why there is always a wait to get a seat."
Jamie G.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,52,16,3.0,8/9/2015,"First, this place has a great beer list.  Second, the food was above average, but nothing spectacular. We started with the chicken pot stickers, and though they were good, the portions were very small for the price.  We had the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza. This was also pretty good, but not worth the price. The crust is excellent, but the buffalo chicken was pretty bland.  Service was below average. It took at least 10 minutes just to be asked if we wanted a drink. My wife had the watermelon mojito and loved it. I had a limited release Stone IPA that was blended with a BJs beer. It was unique and was good.  We asked for a side of ranch that took about 20 minutes to show up.  Not sure if we'll come back. Maybe for a drink."
Tim T.,"Harrison City, PA",2,1,,5.0,3/21/2016,BJ's is one of my top places to go to out of town. So glad it came to Pittsburgh. The avocado egg rolls are my number one appetizer ever anywhere I have been and I have been many places. The beer is also to brag about. I have told everyone and anyone they need to go here.  I had the ribs for the first time and they were also excellent.  Nothing I have ever had there has been anything but good.  Highly recommended especially if you like beer!!
Steyn T.,"Gibsonia, PA",10,9,1,4.0,9/19/2015,"Not even sure where to start when complementing BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, but I'll give it a go. Once you enter this heaven brehouse if there isn't a line to hold you up in of course the wait is worth it.   If your lucky enough to get a seat at the bar then you'll be able to see there many beers they have on tap. There food is well prepared, and they also have wine if your not so much a beer drinker. The one thing that did draw me away while drinking were the high chairs they use in the upper part for seating, but the multiple flat screen TVs took my mind off of that almost right away. They do not have TouchTunes so the music option is out, and all your left w/ is lite chatter w/ the friends your w/. When you think of a brewery or Brewhouse usually you don't pair that w/ a family themed restaurant, and yet BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse completes that circle."
Mary G.,"Zelienople, PA",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Never made it in the door.  Used ""call ahead seating"" option only to be told we would have about an hour wait once we arrived.  The only benefit to calling ahead was that if we arrived at the same time as another customer, we would be seated before the other customer.  So drive 45 mintues to wait another hour and all the time waiting to beat out some poor sucker who walked in the same time as my group?  Doesn't make any sense and no thanks"
Peyton W.,"Oak Ridge, TN",157,5,4,4.0,10/16/2015,"The food was amazing but the wait to be seated took forever. Friendly, fast service otherwise."
Kathy D.,"Wexford, PA",5,4,,5.0,12/18/2015,"Really good food a little pricy. Good berry drink no carb and no alcohol. Appetizers very tasty . A place for every one family, Date, celebration, or sports."
Craig N.,"Cranberry Township, PA",1,52,12,2.0,8/12/2016,"Food was good enough, but went on a Friday and their wait staff was spread way too thin.  Apps came out after 30mins and only 3-4 mins before dinners. Oh and they messed up my check so I waited another 10 unnecessary minutes with kids for a managers approval.  Look elsewhere if it's a weekend. I've been fine eating here during happy hour for what it's worth."
