Don H.,"Canonsburg, PA",1,3,1,2.0,7/12/2015,"Beer choice is good that's about it.  Long wait to be served, parking lot is too small for the amount of restaurants in the area.  Food is just not good, poorly cooked  Really not worth the time."
Luke O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,4.0,5/18/2016,"My family of 7 came here last night when the wait next door at Burgatory was 90 minutes. BJs was full as well, but they did a great job getting us seated inside 15 minutes. The food was very good, and the service was decent though not without a few issues. A few individual thoughts: Deep dish pizza got rave reviews. Really top notch and a spot on the favorite pizza list. New Orleans Jambalaya was excellent. Just the right amount of spicy. Burgers were quite good. One was over cooked so only got an average review. The bacon cheeseburger was excellent. Shoestring fries are great if that's your thing. If you like your fries more potatoey, these won't be your favorite. Service was quite fast overall, though they did get a couple things wrong. No cheese on a burger, fries instead of salad as a side, etc. But not a huge deal. We will be back!"
Tracy T.,"Allison Park, PA",11,5,,4.0,3/30/2016,BJ's is great! The menu has a lot of options and the beer's are great as well. I went on a Wednesday and the place was packed. Had to wait for a table for 2 for about 15 minutes but we just went to the bar and got a beer. Definitely recommend!
Michael M.,"Aliquippa, PA",1,11,3,4.0,1/10/2016,I've been here a few times and it's a pretty cool spot. The food is always good and the prices aren't bad. Apparently there known for there deep dish pizza!?! They make there own beer! Love the Jamaican Red! All in all I've never had a bad experience here.
Peter C.,"Mars, PA",3,65,3,3.0,12/24/2015,We went here for the first time.  Great atmosphere and a great selection of craft beers.  They do not offer bread with your meal.  I had the gluten free pizza which was ok and smaller than I receive at other restaurants.  The salmon and quinoa was good and a decent portion.  My wife enjoyed the fish tacos.  Overall the service was good but you had to ask for items that you sometimes expect from other restaurants.
Chuck B.,"Valencia, PA",0,1,,2.0,4/9/2016,"I understand it is hard to be accurate when trying to estimate when you can be seated,  but when I call 20 mins ahead,  get there,  and get told it is about a 40 minute wait still,  and 1.5 hours we are still waiting,  that is just wrong.  Do not lie to me,  let me decide if I want to wait, I would not have waited that long this time,  but would have tried another time,  now I can promise you I will not be back,  in spite of the food and beer being good. I know it is busy Saturday nights,  but when you tell me I can call ahead 30 mins, and tell me a reasonable wait time, just to trick me into waiting, I cannot respect that.  As mentioned,  the food and beer are good,  but relative to the wait to get to a table,  not THAT good."
Dan Y.,"Baltimore, MD",61,32,12,3.0,7/6/2015,"I give the service a pass because they are still new and trying to figure things out, it wasn't terrible, but the bartenders weren't too friendly with each other. I got a Hawaiian deep dish pizza and a few of the BJ's beers. The pizza was okay, nothing to write home about. The BJ's beers were less than impressive. As a self-proclaimed beer snob, I was dissatisfied by the lack of hops in their session IPA and regular IPA. The Imperial Stout has a big boozy flavor to it, not the roasty/malty taste that's enjoyable.  All in all, a lot of different average beers, and a book of a menu."
Christopher B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,9,28,5.0,6/22/2015,The service was amazing considering that it was so busy. We waited 60 minutes on a Friday night during the dinner rush. It is still a new restaurant so it would be expected that it was so busy. This restaurant does not use the app No Wait but does use their own app. Just search the App Store for BJs. You get $5 off your bill once you download it. The bar staff was great while we waited and the service was quicker than expected. They even talked about their beers and suggested food pairings as they got our drinks. The pizza was amazing along with the calamari. Will post more about other food once I have tried it.
Kolleen J.,"Wexford, PA",24,19,22,3.0,1/18/2016,Great beer on tap.  The menu is very large and I found it to hard to choose!  If you are looking for great beer this is your place but pass if it is a great meal you are in search of. My review is based on similar to its price range.
Kristin H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,21,3,2.0,2/10/2016,"I have officially tried this place twice, and I don't recommend the food. I would go back to try one of their brews again. First time around: Order messed up, I have a food allergy, let our server know, and found that ingredient in a pizza, but it was not listed in their menu. Second time around: Shoestring fries that were so tiny and thin that they were unpalatable. Overpriced fish fry."
Erin K.,"Wexford, PA",59,12,,1.0,3/24/2016,"I hesitated in giving a one star review, but after 5+ trips, they earned it. The food is usually good - 3-4 stars - and the beer and drinks are good. What kills this place is the horrendous service. It's beyond bad. Like a 0 is more appropriate than a 1. They are slow on food and drinks. We got our meals before the appetizer on two occasions. Once they ran out of what we ordered and the server never came to tell us - we were there for about 2 hours, were served one drink, never got what ordered, then had the manager come and tell us he ""put something in"" for us and hoped we would like it because they ran out of pasta (seriously?!). It's just not worth the continued aggravation to try to give this place chance after chance. It's so convenient and this area desperately needed some other dining options but this place is just a disaster."
Joe C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,24,,4.0,1/13/2016,"2nd Time here. The beers are great. We had the BJ's thin pizza--it was delicious. Just a note that this place is almost always busy and you will have to wait, unless you get lucky and get a table by the bar. I recommend it!"
Latasha W.,"Wexford, PA",152,3,,5.0,3/19/2016,"Ate here last night... Tomatoe Soup is fantastic, drink selections are on point as well. Pricing is very fair."
Andrew S.,"Gibsonia, PA",3,12,9,3.0,11/14/2015,"I went to a Bj's out in California on vacation one time and was very please to hear that we were getting one here in McCandless Crossing. That happiness was short lived. On a regular day,mind you, it took our waitress more than ten minutes to come and get us our drinks. The service in there is some of the worst for a restaurant chain. The food is alright but doesn't make up for the lack of service."
Kristan K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4,28,1,2.0,10/12/2015,"Had an ok experience here. It was packed at six thirty on a Tuesday night, so beware. Service was poor. We ordered an appetizer and never got it. Plus, it took forever to get our drinks and entrees. I had a beer sampler, which was really good and a lot of beer for the price. A great value, I would definitely recommend it! The pumpkin beer is one of the worst I've ever had - flat and watery. I had the ahi tuna salad for dinner; at $14 I  was really disappointed in the size. I few pieces of ahi and about the same amount of lettuce you'd get with a side salad. Friends ordered the small pizzas and were pleased."
Chris H.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,78,5,1.0,12/28/2015,Ouch. Fries were cold.  Burger charred and overcooked. Wife's wine glass dirty.  Stick with the beer and don't eat here.
Wascally W.,"Sewickley, PA",6,45,6,2.0,8/16/2015,"YOU NEED TO READ SOCIAL MEDIA!!! I had high hopes for your new restaurant, but since it opened, it's ratings on Yelp have been going steadily downhill. You need to bring in a professional management team to turn this new opening around. We were told an hour wait at 6:15 pm on a Saturday night, and though I noticed a lot of open tables sitting for quite a while, we weren't seated until 7:30 after I went up and pointed out an open booth. I like the setup, I like the menu, and actually, I could like the food. The beer selection is top notch as is the layout. We ordered an app of fried calamari, and the order was out exactly when the waiter took the order in. And it was barely luke warm. We sent it back, since a $9.95 app of calamari of that size better be spot-on. It's replacement came out 30 MINUTES later. And it could definitely have been more crispy and less greasy. And nothing close to an apology from anyone. We had a table of 3, consisting of 2 burger orders and a salmon quinoa bowl. After our dinners were delivered 30 minutes after the appetizer was finished(!), no questions as to whether we needed anything else. Ketchup on the side? No offer. Sauce on the side that was ordered for the salmon  - no sign, and no one asking. Everyone was quite happy with the food - burgers, fries and salmon were all cooked perfectly. So the fault is NOT with the food. As we sat during our 3 hour and 15 minute experience, we noticed an awful lot of unoccupied tables and a continuing waiting crowd. That's lost revenue, especially after these people suffer bad service. I really think this is a reasonably easy fix, but you better get it done soon. Once a new restaurant gets a bad rap, it's very hard to overcome, especially with several new restaurants opening right in the same development. Since this is your first entry in the area, you may want to polish your local image. Oh, and parking is horrendous. Who thought up building 3 restaurants in a row with a Trader Joe's in the middle, with a small shared parking lot? Summary: decent menu, food good but could be way better, food delivery horrendous, table turnover and wait time estimate poor, wait staff inattentive, bar and draft selection above par."
Jen M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",57,11,1,1.0,7/21/2016,"Food was pretty good--no complaints there. But the service was downright abysmal. We showed up at 4:30 p.m. for dinner and were seated immediately. The place was empty, so we figured service would be quick and attentive. We were very wrong. They were completely out of kids' menus, so we had to guess at what to order. Appetizer of guacamole and chips took 20 minutes to arrive. Kids' meals arrived shortly thereafter, but their applesauce was served in a sealed generic GFS container. A bowl would have been too much work, I guess. My husband's salad never did show up, so we asked for it to be removed from our check. Drinks were woefully neglected, and the check took another 15-20 minutes to be taken care of after we requested it. The whole time, it was impossible to find our server anywhere. Usually we give places a couple tries before we give up, but we aren't willing to drop another $50 on this place. Save your money and time and go elsewhere."
Cynthia H.,"Gibsonia, PA",25,10,1,3.0,2/28/2016,"Drinks were amazing, waitstaff was expected and food was subpar. The appetizer needed to be sent back to reheat it and the Brussel sprouts were burnt."
Janice K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,63,,2.0,7/3/2016,As an avid burger fan and fat ass that loves to eat I have to give this place two stars. The food was average and the wait staff was awful. The server looked annoyed she even had to breathe much less work there and not a fan of the ambiance/environment. Nope. Thanks. Next.
