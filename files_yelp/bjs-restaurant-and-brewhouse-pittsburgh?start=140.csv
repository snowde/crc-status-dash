Ruby B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,4.0,2/22/2016,"Bartender provided great service considering how busy the place was with an hour wait. We ended up ordering food at the bar 45 minutes after getting a few drinks. Beers were really good! My glass of cab was a little pricey, that price for my wine I'd expect to pay in a steakhouse - not a brewhouse. Pizza was really good! Overall great service and food."
Alyssa R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,4,,4.0,9/13/2015,"We've been here twice and our experience in the restaurant has been great - great service, great food, and their beers are pretty good. However, experience in the bar was another story. We were sitting at the bar for 15 minutes without being served, while several other people who came in after us got served before us."
Aaron B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,8,,3.0,11/28/2015,"The service is always great. Very attentive and friendly. I just wish the food was better. And the beer is kind of meh. It's on par with Applebee's, so if that's your thing, then by all means, rush right over. If you're looking for a solid brew pub experience, make the trip to Church Brew Works. They have it full time."
NIck S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,3.0,1/27/2016,"My wife and I went here a few times and had good experiences.  So when my family was looking for a place to get together over the holidays I recommended BJ's.  This was a big mistake. Our reservation was for 6:30 but the table was not ready until well after 7.  No problem, a few members of our party were late anyway so no harm no foul.  We had 16 people and it was busy that night so a few small errors in service would not have been a big deal.  Though, almost everyone had complaints.  Twice I ordered one of their beers only to have a server try to give me a mixed drink.  My cousin asked for a dish (cant remember) and was told they were sold out only to see the same order leave the kitchen numerous times afterwards.  One of our family members received the wrong dish, multiple items were forgotten and when the check came the servers proved completely incompetent in dividing the check between 3 groups.  While my sister tried to assist them in separating the bill one of the mangers stood there and did nothing to assist his struggling employees.   On our way out my sister approached two of the ""managers"" only to have one turn face and walk away from her and the other (younger guy) offered no explanation, no resolution, no nothing.  When she inquired further he at least offered to take her information and have someone follow up with an apology and possible gift card for our troubles ($500 bill by the way).  One month later we have heard nothing. The food here is excellent and I may be back in small groups, but large groups should avoid BJ's like the plague."
Lindsey W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",44,26,1,1.0,9/3/2016,"Lol well where to begin. We had a good start but then it unravelled from there. We had a waiter named Blake who was really nice but forgot my mothers apps which happens but told us he was overwhelmed with our drink order so he gave up our table(we were a table of 10). So he gave up our table and half the dinners came out meanwhile the other half were again forgotten. Then the new person waiting of us named Chelsea started and no waters filled or empty plates taken. Not a big deal but she would ask who wants a water and then just walk away lol. My moms app came out like after she canceled, the manager was nice and took it off the bill. The waitress Chelsea in a sarcastic way said ""well this is gonna be a great night"" right next to us. Just not something a waitress should do in front of her table. After this experience I don't think id ever go back, along with the party I was with :("
Erin H.,"New Brighton, PA",2,79,7,5.0,7/23/2015,I finally made the time to venture down to BJs after work one night. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a homemade root beer with a mini pizookie. The burger and fries were amazing. Not a thing to complain about. The pickles were amazing little crunchy pieces of heaven. I'm wondering if I could go in and just order a jar of pickles?  The root beer was probably the best soda I've ever had and who knew that something as simple as a chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream could make you feel like you just won dessert lottery?  They have a ton of different things on their menu. There is something for everyone. Next time I'm bringing a DD and trying a few of their cocktails and sangria. They also have a decent wine selection and obviously plenty of beer.
Brad V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,7,1,3.0,6/27/2015,The beer was good. Wife's pizza was good. But they couldn't cook my burger mid well...twice. Manager comped mine and my wife's. Because of him we will be back to give it a round 2.
Tom M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,7,,2.0,1/16/2016,If you have an hour and half to experience bad service and so so food this is the place.  Not sure I'll be giving it a second chance.
Sophie G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,1.0,4/10/2016,"I tried this place last night and was seriously shocked at the lack of service I received. The high school girl taking names at the door could care less about her job and clearly would rather be anywhere else but there. It was a busy Saturday night and the girl told us the wait would be 45 min. We deiced to wait. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. From the start I thought this was a terrible idea. I also have an out of state number so from the start I was worried something would go wrong. As we sat and waited the high schooler told each party after us a different time. The people after us was an hour, a few more people later it was 90min and then it was 25min. Clearly she had no idea what she was doing.  Finally after about 40min I started to notice people being taken that had come in long after we did so I decided to inquire. The snotty high schooler gave such sass when I asked that I almost walked out right then and there (and trust me I should have!). Without looking up my name or  any sort of information she told me the people were being taken because they'd called ahead. That very well may be but she hadn't even looked my name up to make sure that was true. Clearly just an answer the management teaches the hostess to say. So I then inquired how long it would be until my name was called and she proceeded to tell me that actually my number had already been texted and I had missed my table. We had been sitting right in front of this girl the entire time with my phone in my hand and I had not missed a text. She then read me my number that I supposedly had given her and it was all sorts of wrong. Now I don't really blame the girl for messing up a phone number because it was busy and loud, and one that was out of state, but it was her attitude and her ""I don't give a crap"" tone that made it not okay. I started to get really angry because I was getting no where with this child who didn't know what she was doing. I proceed to ask how much longer it will be and she says ""it will be the next table"" so I ask again ""how long"" and she just kept giving a snarky response of ""it will be the next table"". Due to this girl's attitude I decided it was time to ask for the manager. I had to ask THREE TIMES before I got the manager. The first time the manager was not around, the second she, the hostess, blew me off and the third I realized he was standing, hiding behind some other hostesses because he saw what was going on and didn't want to deal. It took three tries to get the manager and even on the third try the girls working the hostess desk played telephone to tell him why I was mad and he finally, slowly made his way over to me. At this point I was pretty upset and told him what a crappy job the hostess was doing and how disappointed we were. THE MANAGER WALKED AWAY FROM ME. In the middle of my rant he just walks away and disappears. Now I was upset but I was in no way out of control or doing anything that would require him walking away. A simple apology and a table would have done the trick but he walked away. At this point another hostess takes us to our table and the manager is still out of sight. He finally comes over a few minutes later and said ""sorry I was making sure you got a free app"". Still never did I get an apology for the poor treatment from the idiot at the door or from him...I didn't even want a free app!!! After we sat down I tried to calm down but was still really shocked at how disrespected I had been. I was really hoping the food would make up for the lack of service but unfortunately it did not. The free appetizer we got wasn't bad (avocado spring rolls) but the pizza we ordered was TERRIBLE. We order a pizza with olives, onions, pepperoni, and sausage. The moment the pizza was put down on the table I looked at it funny, questioning if it was even throughly cooked. The second I took a bite I knew it was not. The pizza tasted uncooked and was cold. I wasn't about to complain after the lack of respect I had already received from the manager but the food was awful.  I would not recommend this place at all. I have been to the one in Columbus and it wasn't bad but this place is truly awful. Even the staff that I didn't have a run in with looked miserable. It's a shame this place is so terribly run and doesn't offer good food when it just opened. I would recommend skipping this place and choosing somewhere else in Mccandless Crossing or somewhere else on McKnight Road. I will not be returning."
Stacy M.,"Lakewood, CA",11,14,,5.0,6/12/2015,"Ok first off I just want to say FINALLY!!!! I've been waiting 2 yrs for BJ's Brewery to move here. I'm from California where they are in every major city and man oh man have I've missed you guys!!! All I can say is yummy food, yummy beer And ahhhh yes Pazookie!!!!!!!!!! You have to try this place they are Amazing!!!!!!"
Adam K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",12,2,,3.0,12/27/2015,I gave a 3 star rating because I've eaten there a few times and the food and beer has always been very good but I have found their wait staff very poor. The waiter this last time was very attentive but forgot things the servers were very surley bordering on mean we did not get our silverware till after our food arrived. I don't  usually write reviews but i felt that i needed to being that I had another poor experience with staff at BJ's. I wiil eat there again I just hope the staff improves.
Amanda Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",23,16,,3.0,12/24/2015,"I've found items on their menu hit or miss...the appetizers and small plates are good. I especially like the honey sriracha brussel sprouts and crispy fried artichokes. However,   I was not impressed with their pizzas"
T B.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,19,,1.0,6/26/2016,"Went there for dinner for the first time tonight. Probably the last. Semi crowded, got a table kinda near the bar which had extremely loud music playing. Not good for conversation and actually gave me a headache. Ordered mahi tacos, wife ordered similar. Pretty quick service and waiter was nice enough. The food was just so-so, not great by any stretch of the imagination, i.e. not seasoned well and very little flavor, and the servings were pitiful...two small tacos with 5 chips and salsa. Overpriced and not a good value at all. Left there still hungry and feeling a bit ripped off. Went to Trader Joe's for snacks. Will not return."
Patrick W.,"Allison Park, PA",2,7,,1.0,9/20/2015,We've tried this place twice and have been very disappointed both times. The food and service are both very bad. The first time my order was completely  messed up. The second time I received a soggy salad drowned in dressing sk bad I couldn't eat it. Each time we waited an incredibly long time for what we ordered. The only redeeming  factor was that the manager handled things well and apologized appropriately. I won't be back. If I want good beer I can go elsewhere. If I want edible food I can go anywhere.
Kathy B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",16,34,3,4.0,7/25/2015,Back again    Food was awesome   I had shrimp/fish tacos. Husband had jambalaya    Yes it's spicy. Girls split a steak. Prob more char on it than they would like.    The long wait for a table stinks.  But Bethany is the best was  server !! We'll be back and will ask for her !!
Marijn F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,6,,3.0,6/21/2016,"Some of the food was very tasty. The check, however, arrived when we were still eating our main course. We weren't being slow and there were only a few of us. Half the restaurant was empty too."
Cierra S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/29/2015,"The only thing we enjoyed about our visit was our server Spencer. He was very friendly and attentive.  He actually seemed to be doing his job rather than congregating with other staff and talking very loudly. This was our first issue. My boyfriend and I were sitting at a booth at the front of the restaurant and right behind us were about 5-6 staff members hanging out and talking so loudly that we could hardly hear each other and pretty much had no choice but to listen to their conversations rather than have our own.  The food - presentation was great but that was about it. The bread bowl with broccoli cheddar soup was the only thing we enjoyed. My boyfriend ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. The brisket was lukewarm at best but tasted decent. The burger itself seemed like a frozen burger thrown on the grill, looked great on the outside but undercooked in the middle. The bacon was super greasy, like it was thrown in the dryer and put directly on the burger. I ordered the southern fried chicken. The mashed potatoes were good but the chicken was terrible. It way over cooked and hard to chew. We're not the type to send food back, we just probably won't be back. It was almost $40 (pretip) for lunch for two that neither of us enjoyed."
Cookie S.,"Glenshaw, PA",1,11,,1.0,6/15/2016,"What a HORRIBLE experience.  Couldn't get my steak right (it was either dry like cow hide or so bloody it could have been mooing).  My mom's chicken was fair (she did NOT complain or send back).  It took so long to take food order that my hubby had to ask for someone, and the manager showed NO managerial skills.. instead he was a jerk to US!  I was offered no bread, chips, water, etc as I watched my family eat and finish their meals.  I had just gotten back into pittsburgh from visiting Erie, so we were tired and starving.  That experience was so HEINOUS I wouldn't go back If they offered to comp our next 5 meals!!"
Shannon G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",60,14,1,4.0,10/17/2015,"I've been to this BJ's once, and it was a good experience. However, it seems that being new, this location needs some time to figure out what they're doing. I've been to another BJ's, which had a much different vibe to it. The food, like any chain that knows what it's doing, is consistently good, and the menu is huge. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu, but I can't say this is one of my favorites (yet)."
Jonette M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",11,1,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Absolutely horrible service, save yourself the aggravation and skip this place. The waitress never came back to see if we wanted anything else to drink nor did she check on us once our dinner was served. My husband had to leave our table and chase after her to get more drinks for us. I informed the manager and he said i should have told him earlier,  how could i get his attention, never saw him going around checking on his own customers, couldn't get the waitress to wait on me, how would i have got the managers attention. Place is not worth going to."
