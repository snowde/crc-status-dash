Shirl R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",17,9,,1.0,9/16/2015,"Hubby and I finally went to this restaurant on Thursday night. First and last time we will. Service leaves a lot to be desired for. Food took forever to get. Waitress came to us several times to apologize, and say that the food was coming soon.  It was NOT worth the wait. I ordered the burger with a side of mashed potatoes. They brought it, and the burger was overcooked, and had bacon on it...I didn't order it this way...I don't eat pork, and was totally turned off. Told the it wasn't mine, and the server insisted it was. I told her it wasn't, as I did not order bacon, and she said, ""oh, it must be HIS"", meaning my husband. He already had his burger in front of him, with the bacon that he ordered.  They just made them both the same. I sent it back, they offered to take the burger off of my bill, AND get me a free one.  I told them no, I would just eat the potatoes. They tried several times to make me another, and I politely refused the offer. The waitress then said, ""Why wouldn't you want a FREE burger?"".  I told her because if they could not get it right the first time, I don't want it.  How hard is it to get a rare burger with cheese?  They specialize in burgers, don't they???? Anyway, I have a personal rule for myself. If I wait forever for my food, and they mess it up, I don't want it or anything else from the ""chef"".  Period. I watched too many movies where the cook spits on the food, since someone complained, and I am not taking the chance. I ate the mashed potatoes, and they were pretty lame.  My husband's burger was mediocre, at best.  He told me to be glad that they took mine back, as it was pretty bad. Sad that the North Hills can't get any good restaurants. All they are getting are chains, and the procedures are an assembly line, I think.  No thanks, before I pay for bad food, I will just eat at home."
John F.,"Wexford, PA",0,23,,2.0,6/18/2015,I'll chalk this up to being open a very short time.   Great beer selection and the food was pretty good.   The service left a lot to be desired.  It took 20 mins to get drinks - and we only got them after we asked a 2nd time.  We ordered the appetizers - which came out in a reasonable time - but we didn't get any plates.  Overall - our server was not very attentive.    We will give them a 2nd chance - but we'll wait a while until they get kinks worked out.
Drew L.,"Erie, PA",228,7,,5.0,6/17/2015,"Great service, great food, and fantastic atmosphere! You can taste the freshness of the ingredients used in the food! I will definitely be returning and recommending this place to friends!"
Reb G.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,3,,3.0,9/9/2015,"Was seated right away which was surprising because it was a busy weekend and we had a party of five. But it was probably 10-15 minutes before a waiter came to get our drink order. Another 10 minutes before we got our drinks. Service is definitely slow. Burgers, fries and beer were delicious!"
Brenda G.,"Sewickley, PA",41,1,,3.0,9/6/2015,"Okay been here a few times now, however today the service was so bad.  We liked the deep dish pizza but I ordered a wedge salad with ranch instead of blue cheese but alas it came with blue cheese.  Not that it really mattered as our pizza came within THREE minutes after our salad was delivered.  I needed a refill and my hubby wanted another beverage  but again getting service was impossible!  If you don't mind lousy service and are NOT going to a movie they do have a wide variety of of brews, but overall not a recommendation in my book.  Sorry as this is a new place but too many visits with really lousy servers!"
Beth O.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,11,,1.0,8/21/2015,"We came here at an off time - maybe 3-4 in the afternoon and the restaurant was not super busy. We were seated right away, but then we waited and waited...the tables around us were filled, but waitress after waitress passed us by. There was no acknowledgement we were even there, much less a drink order or anything. After about 10-15 minutes of just sitting there, we decided to just leave. No one even noticed. I also noticed a lot of the waitstaff just standing around. There was a Pirates game on and they seemed more interested in that."
Drew D.,"Wexford, PA",0,4,,2.0,8/13/2015,"It's a typical chain experience. Nothing special. The menu presents very well, and I was intrigued by the variety of layered beer drinks they offered (aka a 'black and tan' but with several other combinations). I gave the bartender two shots at making what they called a 'Dark Side of the Moon' (their stout over a blue moon), but he poured way, way too fast and it came out a light brown mess.  My wife had to return her fish dish because it was clearly foul, and my 'deep dish' pizza was closer to neapolitan style than Uno's or Lou Malnati's No reason to go back."
Bryan M.,"Mars, PA",0,6,7,3.0,10/22/2016,"Added our name to the Waitlist via the BJ's app on Friday at 5:15pm. It initially said there was a 15 minute wait for parties of our size (3) which was perfect because that is how long it takes us to get there. We arrive and check-in. The Wait Time on the app now says 35 minutes which we expect to be no problem as we don't mind waiting a few minutes until 5:50pm for our table to be ready. The App also mentions that ""This is not a reservation, so you may experience a slight wait when you arrive."" As it approaches 6pm and we hear other parties with similar sized groups being called to be seated we start to wonder if the Wait List has even helped our place in line. This location is rather new and there always seems to be a crowd in the lobby - which is totally normal and expected. On this visit, though, they actually served small slices of pizza to the guests waiting for their tables. We thought this was a great! (I always thought a restaurant should have a separate sidebar and waiting room with light snacks to make the wait a little more bearable.) Anyways, we are seated at 6:05pm and order our drinks. We tried to order their newly advertised Pumpkin beer and our waitress tells us that they sold out in 6 days and it's no longer available (it's not even November!). We decide to order an appetizer - Sriracha Queso with Chips. Our family is no stranger to queso and this is our 2nd time ordering it at BJ's. We are always surprised how it seems to lack the Sriracha part. For dinner, I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with fries. My wife, K, ordered the Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles which was a new addition to the menu. Our son, G, ordered the BBQ Boneless wings - and the waitress suggested he try their Root Beer BBQ sauce on the side. We had a longer wait for our food than normal. Both adjacent tables who were seated after us received their meals before us - but there was no worry because our server brought us extra chips! Once the meals were delivered, I now understand why it took so long...they had to wait for my wife's dish to be delivered from Noodles & Company in Cranberry! The noodles and the portion size was much smaller than pictured. There was really no spicy component to it - it tasted more like an orange flavored sauce. My sandwich was delicious - lightly toasted and a healthy serving of avocado. G's Boneless Wings were plentiful - there had to be at least 15 on his plate! Overall, an OK experience that's why I gave it 3 stars. We still enjoy BJ's and their expansive menu - and especially the beer! The Jeremiah Red is my favorite! In the end, $50 for 3 is absolutely fair. We will be back again."
Matt A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,7,,1.0,4/18/2016,Been there about 4 times now. Service has been terrible each time. Food is average at best. Won't be going back unless I have too.
Anne M.,"CRANBERRY TWP, PA",0,4,,2.0,7/31/2015,"Service was a bit slow, and quality was lacking.  Husband didn't receive Parmesan for his spaghetti until he was halfway through it, my salad came out with large toothpick buried in it (which I found by biting on it), baked potato was not hot, one of the servers I saw (not ours) had her thumb squarely on top of the food on the plates she was carrying (multiple times).  I don't know that I would return voluntarily."
Shawn R.,"Wexford, PA",5,5,,2.0,10/8/2015,"I can never figure out why this place is so crowded.  The location can't make up for the mediocre food and ineffective busybody service.  If you liked TGI Fridays 15 years ago this place is the updated brew house equivalent, with a dose of cheesecake factory for good measure.  After 3 visits the photos in the menu are the most impressive thing about the food.  The environment at BJ's  is stressful due to the busy crowds and chaotic haphazard service.  They have good beer,  but the house offerings are all pretty uninspired and safe.  The best beer offerings are available nearby in much better restaurants,  especially if you appreciate sole-proprietorships and less ""corporate""  atmospheres.  Again 10-15 years ago this place would have been something.  Today it's only notable quality is the crowds."
Burghers And F.,"Coraopolis, PA",0,5,11,2.0,7/12/2015,"I have tried this location four times, with the most recent being Saturday July 11 at 10:30pm.  They seem to be making small steps to improve their service. During my last visit the table runners appeared to have learned the table numbers because all food and drink brought to the table was correct.  A few people have complained about the wait time. I have been there twice on Saturday evenings and each time I was told the wait would be 5 minutes and was seated before that time. My first visit was a Sunday afternoon and although I was seated promptly they got busy quickly, be prepared for a wait on Sunday afternoon.  After being seated the waitress was prompt to take drink orders. However, the orders needed to be repeated due to how loud the background music was. They had the Cardinals vs Pirates game on the televisions and someone was raising and lowering the volume based on which team was at bat. One area they need to improve on is kitchen communication. I have ordered their chicken potstickers twice, my first time and most recent visit. When the potstickers got to the table the chicken was cooked thoroughly, no pink, but was cold. The first time the potstickers came out then 2 minutes later my entree arrived, the most recent time my entree arrived before the appetizer. For this trip when my entree, New Orleans Jambalaya, arrived cold. I have had jambalaya in New Orleans and the dish I had at BJ's lacked the flavor and spice that would be in a jambalaya in New Orleans. The highlight for any trip to BJ's is their beverages. Their home made beers and soda's are tasty. The first time I was there my waiter said they are like the Cheesecake Factory. After having been to BJ's four times and the Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count I disagree with what my first waiter said. The food and service at BJ's is well below the level that one gets at the Cheesecake Factory. If you are looking for a place to eat go the extra 3 miles down to the Cheesecake Factory. I won't be going back until September to give them time to improve."
T M.,"Imperial, PA",0,4,,3.0,2/21/2016,Beer was great! Food was almost great! Service was horrible. Almost three hours to get out of this place.  Probably 30 minutes between seeing our server. Pointed to what I wanted and was brought something different.
Jill B.,"Wexford, PA",69,10,13,2.0,4/3/2016,"Unfortunately this place has gone down in quality over our visits in the past year. We visited this location a total of 4 times. If I rated this place after my first trip I would have easily given it 5 stars. On the first trip our service by Courtney was amazing, the beer selection was great (and still is), and the chicken dinner and pizza was really good. We enjoyed it so much we came back. Every trip we waited over an hour for a table for 3. The ""online check in"" never worked for us. It would say 45 minute wait and we'd arrive 45 mins later and still wait 45 more mins. This actually happened all 4 times. Our second trip my salad was forgotten. A person brought my daughter's salad and said mine would ""be right out"". Our dinners arrived and still no salad. Our pizza was served with very little toppings for the cost and we were disappointed. We decided it could have been a fluke so we returned for trip 3. This trip our server carried out the mug of root beer grasping it with her hand over the top of the mug instead of using the handle. When our pizza arrived it was served by another person and not our server. Our server came to our table and said she couldn't believe how lazy the staff was. She said the person who brought our food was supposed to serve us our first piece of pizza. I said I didn't care and it was ok but she continued to rant about her lazy co-workers. She said she would serve it to us (Which I insisted she didn't need to do). She proceeds to cut a piece with the utensil and actually lifted up the pizza with her bare hand and placed it on my plate. I was so grossed out by this that we asked for a box and took our remaining pizza home to eat..and obviously left the pizza she served with her bare hands behind. It took us 6 months to decide to give this place ONE more chance (stupid us, I know, but we kept hoping for a trip like our first visit). We returned as long as as we didn't get the same server that clearly had never attended a food handling training. Our final visit started by being seated at a dirty table. Then my husband got a salad with a giant hair (looked to be about 10 inches long) tangled all through it. He told the server and she lifted it up and said ""where, I don't see it?"" Then she goes ""oh wait, there it is! Wow that's really gross!"" .....umm yes it was. My chicken dinner was served on a plate with red crusty sauce stains and my chicken had white sauce in it so the crusty marks were due to using a dirty dish. At this point I was fed up and angry at myself for giving this place so many chances. The server didn't bring out my husband his ""hair free salad"" until our dinners were served, and the salad remained on our bill and a manager never came to talk to us. It was all very unfortunate because the place had a lot of potential with a prime location, excellent beer choices, and a gigantic menu. However, poor service and lack of cleanliness has caused this place to be on our never return list. The beer quality and quantity is the only reason I was willing to give this place a few stars. The only way I would recommend this place is to stop in and get a growler of beer to go."
Douglas S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",27,2,,2.0,6/30/2015,Parking is really bad... we ordered the speing rolls for app they were warm to cold....Deep Dish Pizza was dry and did not look like the picture in the menu....Beer was average...pizookie by the time we got it the Ice Cream was melted....was curious to see the place..... was just average inside kind of tight... Service was good got our food pretty quickly....never offered another water and waitress never asked how was everything
Allison M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,24,,3.0,6/27/2015,"We got takeout on a Saturday night. The place was packed with people waiting.  When I entered I waited in line at the front desk only to be told the takeout desk was up the stairs by the bar.  My food was ready and brought out promptly. I'm giving 3 stars for the lack of organization inside and the price.  We got an appetizer 1 medium pizza and a tavern style pizza for 50.00.  The pizza was good, but not great.  Nothing I would need or probably will have again. This place is worth a try, but probably not a place I would return to"
Catherine L.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,12,,5.0,3/29/2016,"Half off pizza on Monday was the reason I decided to come to BJs. It was a great deal and with the lunch draft special, I will definitely be back for lunch!  Also..Try the honey sriracha brussel sprouts, the twisted BLT salad, or the lemon pepper wings with your meal -yum!"
S J.,"Wexford, PA",0,33,1,4.0,7/20/2015,"1st visit....our server T.D.  was excellent, great follow up and knowledgable. We asked her for suggestions, which were good delicious choices.  A nice selection of beer.  Our food was unique, and delicious. I'm surprised reading the previous negative reviews, my experience was very good and will return again. Only negative-parking. Opening your restaurant across from Trader Joe's and sharing the same parking lot."
Ashley K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",62,17,,1.0,1/1/2016,"This was our first time at BJs. Four adults and 3 children ( 2 of them being 7 years old) for dinner today. They were busy, but we only waited a short time to get a seat. Once we were seated, we waited about 15 minutes for a waitress to come and take our drink order, then another 15 minutes for them to come. We each ordered a beer and were then asked for our IDs. With 3 older kids at our table the waitress stood there and scanned every detail of each of our IDs (mind you, we are all in our 30s with children). After trying to order chips and dip for appetizer, the waitress returned, much later, to tell us they were out of them. After our appetizers came we had to flag the waitress down and ask her if we could order, at this point we had already been there an hour! She finally took our order and then returned 3 separate times to tell us that they were out of the things we had ordered! Refills were never offered or given and we had to ask for dirty plates to be removed. I ordered the slider burgers with fries. The burgers were thin chip-like burgers that were burnt. I asked the waitress if they were supposed to come with grilled onions like the menu said and she stated they were in the patty. I found ONE onion in one out of 4 burgers! No apologies for the terrible food and service. The service was absolutely unacceptable, and 2 hours for dinner is outrageous especially when you're trying to entertain kids! We will certainly NOT be returning!"
Becky R.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,3,,2.0,12/30/2015,"I have given this restaurant 3 chances and they have struck out all 3 times. I'm not one to write reviews, but I feel that a review is necessary for BJ's. Never have I been so disappointed on multiple occasions by a restaurant, and I don't understand how they are still getting business. My 3 encounters are below:  1st visit: I and 2 friends went on a Saturday evening (around 9 o'clock, so the dinner rush was gone and we sat immediately). The waitress was initially nice, but when she found out that we were only ordering dessert she quickly lost her charm. She was rude and repeatedly gave us dirty looks throughout the night. Then when our food arrived, she returned with the check before we reached our 2nd bite.  2nd visit: Returned with a group of 8 for a birthday lunch. The drink orders were repeatedly wrong, the waiter had few manners when it came to reaching across the table and mixing up orders, and to top it off one of our guests was elbowed in the head by a passing staff member.  3rd visit: Five of us sat in the bar area to avoid the 2 hr wait to sit on a Monday night. The waitress (who I feel bad for) had to repeatedly apologize to us because she was the only staff member working the entire bar area. Meanwhile, there were 2 or 3 staff members just standing around by the kitchen door. It took a minimum of 15-20 minutes for her to make it back to our table. After the 20 minute wait to receive our drinks and get our orders in, we waited an hour for our food to come. We then had to request our checks when we ordered dessert because we had a movie to get to. When our checks finally came, they were all wrong. We also never had our waters refilled. And to top it off after the 2 hour ordeal we were late to get to the movie theater and it was sold out by that point. You'd think getting to a restaurant by 4:45 on a Monday would be plenty of time to make it to a 6:45 movie showing...clearly not.  I am very disappointed by this restaurant. They are now reaching the point where they can no longer use being a 'new' restaurant as an excuse. The service is horrendous and slow, and the food is mediocre at best.  The only reason I am giving them a 2 stars is because the beer is pretty good. Unfortunately, a good beer will only get you so far, and good beer paired with good food and staff can be found in MANY other places within a 15 minute radius."
