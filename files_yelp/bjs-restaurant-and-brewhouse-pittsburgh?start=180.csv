Mike D.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,,3.0,2/24/2016,"Food is pretty good, service has needs attention. Bartenders just like to talk themselves.  Can't get their attention to order drinks or food.  They are new wait 6 months to try."
Jake C.,"Hurlburt Field, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2016,Called ahead and they told us to be in at 615pm. When we arrived they had no record of us in the system. They refused to help or fix the problem and told us we would have to wait a hour and fifteen minutes. Terrible service lady at the front could care less and did nothing to help.
Diana J.,"Greencastle, PA",0,24,,4.0,2/7/2016,Great place to go in with family and friends to enjoy the great food they serve.  Lots of great brews to pick from.
Matt S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,11,,5.0,8/18/2015,Cool. Nice selection of drinks and food. It's an ale house so take it with a grain of salt when you see others complaining about the menu. I'm definitely going back.
Fae S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,1.0,7/31/2016,"My partner and I have been back to this place about 5 times.  We used to be regulars at the location in our home town in Florida.  We were excited when they opened.  EVERY single time the service is absolutely the worst.  From the hostess to the wait staff.  Whenever we approach the hostess station we are met with a blank stare - no greeting, they don't ask how many we have, there is just an awkward silence before I feel uncomfortable and end up greeting the hostess instead...  Our first visit we were told by the hostess there was a 15 minute wait, so we sat down and waited around 20 minutes, making eye contact with the hostess, a young couple walked in and were seated immediately.  Then another, who were also seated immediately.  We stood up and asked why we hadn't been seated and the hostess simply replied ""Oh I forgot you were waiting.""  No apology, nothing.  The wait staff is awful - no refills, no check in, different people delivering your food, no condiments, no silverware, getting a different drink when I do get a refill. On one occasion our waitress told us the cook ""forgot"" to cook our meal, so we waited almost an hour. When the manager came to our table he said ""I'm sorry I think our cook may be dyslexic."" Eh - super offensive joke dude.  It has just always been an unpleasant experience.  We like the food and my partner loves the beer selection but it's not worth the hassle to come.  Sometimes we grab takeout but avoid the dine in experience and go to Burgatory.  Only plus is their deep dish pizza is to die for."
Shane E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,4.0,1/28/2016,"Terrific atmosphere, lots of room to sit. Portions are on the smaller size for what they charge. Overall I reccomend giving them a try. They brew their own root beer which is phenomenal."
Jennifer K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,8,,5.0,1/24/2016,"I'm so happy to have something new in the north hills! The food is always great. I try something new every time I come in. Sometimes the wait is a little crazy but that's not exactly a bad thing, for them at least. The berry cider and the cookie desert, omg! One of fave places!"
Peg K.,"Gibsonia, PA",1,30,30,5.0,10/6/2015,Very happy to have one so close to us. We love the one in Mesa Arizona and this is the same excellent quality. Staff is great food is excellent. Very happy there here!
Glyn E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,8,1,1.0,7/30/2015,"We tried to go there one evening a few weeks ago, and there was a 3 hour wait for a table. Yesterday, I had customers in town and tried to go for lunch. We were seated immediately (as the restaurant was not full), and then were forgotten/ignored by the waiters for more than 20 minutes. Not even water or silverware was delivered. The wait staff seemed to deliberately avoid looking in our direction as they walked past.  We flagged down a bus boy who seemed rather surprised that we should ask for a waiter. After a further 5 minutes, we left, again without a server coming to our table. As we left, the server and manager tried to intercept us but my customers had already left. After two attempts to try BJs, I doubt that there will be a third. Long wait times to get seated or being ignored after being seated do not seem to be a good indicator.  As a general note, the parking situation is terrible at McCandless Crossing. Hopefully it will improve once the construction is finished."
Bob C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",61,6,,1.0,1/8/2016,If you want below average this is the place to go. I do not think I'm being overly critical of this place because this has happened a good amount of times since I have been there. Long wait times and mediocre management  have more or less guaranteed me never returning.
Nicole T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,3,1.0,1/2/2016,First trip to BJ's almost an hour there before we received our appetizer (mozzarella sticks). Another 30+ minutes before we received our burgers. I like them pink but I ordered medium and it was raw inside. We were so annoyed with how long everything took that we didn't even order dessert. Our waitress never once apologized for the delay and took forever to refill sodas. We will not return after how long it took to get an appetizer and our meals. Meal overall for 1 appetizer and 2 burgers took over 2 hrs! Awful experience.
Brian C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,3.0,12/29/2015,"If you are looking for a great pan pizza try this restaurant. If you want great craft beer, go elsewhere. Their beer is average, but you'll pay a premium for it. A fair number of beers are not even on tap, which happens a lot. The service was perfect the first time I went there. The waitress read through the menu and made suggestions all while tending to drinks and not having to be flagged down. The last time I went was not good, I had an empty water and a waitress who didn't care to check on the table until I was ready to leave. The food is decent enough for the price, if there is no wait it's worth a stop."
Mallory M.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,14,,1.0,6/21/2015,"Wait people, wait!!!!  That's all I have to say about this place.  Give it several months to get in the groove before you come. We have experienced all service problems other posters reviewed- in particular a sketchy front desk system and many wrong orders coming to our table.  And the kicker is the place is packed at 3:30 on a Sunday, we had a 1.5 hour wait, we have been waiting 20 minutes for our drinks and there is a gaggle of servers standing right behind us just chatting away.  They are obviously getting to know each other but seriously girls, you are in the weeds!!!  Won't even review the food however menu looks good.  If you have a ton of time and are not easily aggravated then come now.  Otherwise wait for a few months."
C D.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,39,28,3.0,9/25/2015,"I have been here twice, both times I had to wait about 15 min for a table. I would recommend coming at an off-peak time. Excellent selection of beers, drinks, and unique food, although the menu is very large and can be a little overwhelming. Charismatic servers and good service but the kitchen is slow to get food out. The restaurant is a welcome change to the sea of generic chain restaurants in the Pittsburgh area."
Mark L.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,4,,3.0,12/17/2015,"Bar and bar staff are great.  After drinks, we sat at a table in the bar and the server recommended a pizza and spinach dip.  Pizza was below average at best and spinach dip was horrible.  However the service was great and the house beers were also great.  if they can fix the food I'll be a regular."
Marissa S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,5.0,12/9/2015,"This was my second time at BJs Restaurant and I cannot explain how great our experience was. We came with a group of 8 for a birthday party. We are all servers and bartenders so we are pretty picky about our service. Kayla was our server and she was beyond great!! Not only did we have great service but our food, drinks, and desserts were all amazing. We are always looking to go somewhere and have great service- this was the best service and meal combo we've had in a long time!!"
Jim H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,4.0,9/3/2015,Great place to get a brew and a burger the seating wasn't the best  but the atmosphere was good.
Jennifer W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,48,,2.0,11/8/2015,"Mediocre is putting it nicely. I went for lunch with my sister and mom to watch some college football. It was busy but we stayed wanting to catch the end of the noon games. I ordered a yuengling draft and was surprised to see that cost almost $7. For a draft!? Anyways. We wanted pizzas as that seemed like the popular item to the folks around us but found out they were out of dough. After an expensive beer and no chance for pizza we weren't off to a great start. We ordered the potato skins, wings and 2 of the salads to share. The food was just o.k. Some of the potato skins were burnt and others seemed not cooked long enough. I also like mine with tons of cheese and bacon. These barely had any. The wings were pretty awful. Chicken was tough and chewy, not enough sauce on the wings which made it bland. The atmosphere is cool and our waiter was nice but overall I was disappointed."
Lisa M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,5,,1.0,7/24/2015,"One star for the beer. The food was just average. The service was horrible. Our server came to our table three times to tell us she would be back right after she put in other table's orders. When she finally did take our order, we ordered an appetizer and meals. It took forever for the food to come and the meals came out before the appetizer. We ended up canceling the appetizer because there was no point in eating it. It would have been nice to have it while we waited 30 minutes for our food to come out. After eating, we then waited forever for her to bring us our check. We will not be going back because there are other restaurants with just average food but excellent service."
Alexis L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",63,6,1,1.0,12/16/2015,"I really wanted to like this place...I went here with my family after we saw a movie.  We got seated quick and got our drinks. I was excited when I saw how extensive the menu was and, looking at the prices, I figured it would Cheesecake Factory quality stuff.  We ordered a Southern Fried Chicken, Deep Dish Ziti, and Flatbread Pizza, which arrived within 10 minutes.  This is when it fell apart.  My corn was cold, and the chicken and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm.  The chicken was paper white inside and disgustingly dense, rather than the tender and juicy chicken I had been expecting.  The sauce on the ziti tasted like tombstone pizza sauce and had no distinguishable flavored.  The pizza had a soggy crust and the cheese tasted like a cheap version of Pizza Hut.  All of it was awful, but I guess the pizza was at least edible.  The conclusion we came to is that this place uses frozen meals (think Banquet, Lean Cuisine) and heats them up.  That explains how the chicken could be cold, yet cooked through and the total lack of flavor.  You could honestly find better food in the freezer aisle of Giant Eagle, at least it would be hot.  Will not be going back.  With all the options for food in this area, there's really no need for this house of horrors."
