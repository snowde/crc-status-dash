Maria I.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,2,1,5.0,3/7/2017,"Great food awesome beer. Definitely recommend this place. Huge menu. Lots of light food. Everything taste so good and fresh.  Big thank you to bartender Megan, she bring amazing professional service."
Jody A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",14,67,56,4.0,8/30/2016,"First time here. Not a long wait on a Monday. We sat in the back corner which wAs nice since it's loud in there. Finally a waiter arrived, nice kid, talked it up and took our order. Had calamari - it was good but they could have drained the oil better. I had a burger- it was good. Fried are thin and could have been hotter. Husband had the jambalaya spicy...it was. Got a free dessert because I mentioned it was our anniversary. Overall not a bad place if you don't mind the noise level."
Jeremy M.,"Allison Park, Hampton Township, PA",78,7,1,5.0,2/25/2017,"Fantastic food, & great staff, very friendly and accommodating! Been here quite a few times & will certainly be back!"
Christopher C.,"Shaler Township, PA",15,1,,2.0,4/29/2017,"Food was cold and took forever, service was great.  For a strip mall restaurant it barely meets very low expectations!"
Greg N.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,6,,1.0,9/10/2016,"Really wish i had something good to say about this place. I definitely had high hopes.  Unfortunately the service was slow. The appetizers were delivered nearly the same time as the meal. And to top it off, my burger was so burnt it was impossible to eat.  No apologies. No caring. No return."
Jaime M.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,100,49,1.0,1/2/2017,A+ for the hostess but a big F for the server who never greeted us.  My family and I went on New Years Day and had two little kids with us.  The hostess alerted our server twice about us and he still never came up to us.  Waited about ten minutes then walked out.  This place was not busy either! Pretty sad because I have loved BJs on the west coast.
Carol S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,47,6,3.0,8/7/2016,"I've never been here but my parents had while in Alabama. I tried the Barbadoa chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The fire-roasted tomatoes were a nice touch. The rice and beans were decent, although I did not taste any feta cheese. My mom tried the shrimp tacos which she enjoyed.  It seemed like the wait staff was tired and running low on energy. Mind you it was only 12:30. Our waitress was nice but was hard to find. I'll like to try some other dishes."
Michael G.,"Niles, OH",76,168,1292,4.0,12/16/2015,"Against my better judgement I gave this place another chance.  It was the Pizookie that brought me back, but I'm glad it did, because it was a completely different experience this time. I had the Beachhouse Blonde beer battered fish and chips this time.  it was delicious.  The fish was perfectly fried, light, and not greasy at all.  The fries were crisp and hot.  And our waitress, Taylor, was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. For dessert, I went with the salted caramel Pizookie.  It was yummy. Some of the caramel got crispy and that gave it a nice little crunch. I'm glad this trip was better than my first.  I'll be back again."
Emily M.,"Aliquippa, PA",1,27,10,4.0,2/27/2017,"I've eaten here twice now and both times were really good!! Tuna poke is awesome! Pizza is awesome! Guacamole is amazing! I love their French dip sandwich. There's a ridiculous amount of options and usually that scares me on a menu, because I think well they can't make EVERYTHING well, they should specialize in something, but I've tried a variety of things each time and have not had anything I wasn't a fan of."
John D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",32,11,5,2.0,7/25/2017,"We have been twice over the past month. Had never been before. The first visit, service was poor. Waiter serving us was very low energy and just didn't seem to want to be there. The waiter serving the table next to us was running circles around ours, and smiled. The food was salty, salty, salty (beef sliders and the turkey dip) The draft beer menu is impressive. I ordered the Nutty Brewnette which was really good. Once we gave our main course order, I ordered a ""flight"" of beers. I literally asked for the flight to be sent along with main course 15 seconds after ordering. This seemed to annoy the waiter who said ""it's already been sent, I'll let them know."" This was an odd claim because the waiter hadn't left our table yet and we were very close to the bar. On our second visit, the service was great. Our waitress was on point, energetic and welcoming. Unfortunately the food was salty again. I ordered beef sliders which tasted good, but one of them was literally the size of a quarter, like as if they ran out of beef. We also ordered the boneless wings which were terrible. The level of salt was truly unlike anything I've ever experienced. I drank plenty of water and could not finish even though I was hungry. If they could step up the food quality a bit and show some enthusiasm and knowledge of the craft beer menu, I'd be happy to give them another try. Sadly, I don't think we will be back a third time. They should try to emulate Gordon Biersch in my opinion."
Chad B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",46,132,188,3.0,7/18/2016,"My friend brought me here after a recent interview I had in the area. There was a bit of a wait so we grabbed a beer at the bar and I was happy to see that they had a large selection. Lots of craft choices were available. Once sat, our waitress was very attentive and answered a few questions for us. We placed our orders and got another beer each. Everything went quickly and the service was great. We put in for an appetizer which came out very fast. The Avocado Egg Rolls were very tasty and a great starter. I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger with fries. The burger was decent but I had to ask for extra sauce. There wasn't enough to even taste initially. The fries however were of the shoestring variety which I like but the were cooked to a crisp and were stiff and crunchy. Way overdone. I asked for a side of Chipotle Mayo to dip them in which helped a bit but over all they were just bad.  There is a lot of potential for what I ordered but it just missed the mark a little bit on this visit. I do like the atmosphere and beer selection. I will make a return trip and try something different on my next trip."
A A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,39,11,2.0,11/20/2015,"This restaurant has the best location for dinner and a movie! Too bad it's not that great...  We went right when it opened and had an awesome experience. We sat the bar, the bartender was awesome, and our food was fast and good.  Just went back after a few months and it was terrible! My burger was so greasy that I couldn't eat the bun because it was soaked through (gross, so I didn't eat the burger either). The fries were cold and had definitely been sitting for a long time. My boyfriend got the mahi mahi and shrimp over couscous and didn't care for any of it.  Disappointing."
Todd A.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,1,,1.0,2/9/2017,"Food is good. Expect long waits if you go at prime time which certainly should be no surprise.  Wait staff and hosting station is hit or miss. We've had outstanding service and horrible service.  My biggest issue is with the deception of their menu and lack of ethics on the part of their management.  Their website (not the national one either, specifically the one you get after choosing McCandless) says that Tuesday's they have half off Glasses and Bottles of wine.  They told my wife that it does not apply to PA because of the liquor laws they can only discount so much.  Fair answer....except there are multiple other restaurant chains in the market that do offer half off bottles...in particular one that does so on Wednesdays and another on Sundays (I'll leave them nameless).   Needless to say if the Manager is that much of a jack...it speaks volumes as to why the service and attitudes in general are spotty.  Go elsewhere. There are a TON of great options in Pittsburgh."
Colin M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",109,298,87,3.0,9/17/2015,"Hopefully not a sign to come as my second visit was a major step down from my first trip. A buddy of mine was in town and thought this would be a good spot to take him to dinner. Pretty busy for a Thursday night which in turn meant a pretty long wait before our first beer arrived. Host and waitress were both pleasant but the food this time out was just OK. Brussel sprouts weren't crispy like they were during our first trip. My buddy ordered the Chicago style pizza and it looked good as that's what I had the first time around. My meal however was pretty forgettable, and I knew I shouldn't have ordered it. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Considering you can get a comparable meal at most chain restaurants this was the most bland version I've ever had. Everything was just a bit dry. Chicken was saved only by the toppings but I barely touched the mash potatoes. My side salad I started with was fine albeit I hate when they load up on croutons. I'll certainly be back but I think I'll stick to pizza or bar food in the future and avoid the entrees."
Joanne A.,"CRANBERRY TWP, PA",74,234,841,2.0,9/28/2015,"Came back for dinner before the movies.  Service improved a bit or maybe bc it was a weekday.  We sat at the bar area to see if the wait will be better.  Started slow but at least not as bad as last time, and our server got the orders correctly. The hubby and I shared the 2 for $25, which includes a soup/salad, medium pizza and pizookie.  I had a cesar salad and hubby had the house wedge salad that has bacon, tomatoes, & vinaigrette dressing.  Both were what you would expect.  We had the BJs favorite deep dish (peperroni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, olives).  It was delish, but don't get it if you dislike raw and chunky veggies.  It was lacking in the meats though.   The salted caramel pizookie was the highlight.  I'd say the 2 for $25 is a good portion for 2 people.  We had pizza leftovers.  We also had a very berry margarita (strong but tasty) and a wildberry mojito (pretty good).  Cocktails are pricey.  Happy hr is $1 off drinks. I didn't see the 2 for $25 on the menu, so you would have to ask the server if they are offering it when you go.  One thing I noticed that's different here from other BJs is that the servers do not ask about your interest in the pizookie until you're done w/ dinner.  I can understand that that's probably more with etiquette.  At other BJs, they ask you in the beginning so they can time the pizookie perfectly since it is made to order.  I hope this place keeps improving in service."
Amy C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",168,430,1429,2.0,8/16/2015,"The beer and drink is terrific. The service was fantastic! Our waitress, Maria, was attentive and friendly and knowledgeable. The food was not good. The flat bread we ordered was okay. The entrees, ugh. I chose the Hawaiian Mahi Mani. It was a stir fry kind of dish. The fish was overcooked and I think there was an entire onion mixed in with the over-soyed rice. The rice was soggy. The hubby got the ""dinner"" sized portion of the southern fried chicken. It comes on a bed of corn. He got two small pieces of tough, stringy, over cooked pieces of dry chicken on a bed of overcooked corn. Not good. I feel like the menu is way too big. Maybe if they focused on bar type food it would be better but we won't eat here again. Beer and drinks for sure but food, no way!"
Matthew M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,36,49,2.0,1/1/2017,"Went there with 6, place was dead, server never showed up so we complained to the hostess. She said something to him and he walked the other way so we left and are now at Burgatory! Update:  Burgatory was AMAZING!  It was awful to have to remove my party (including two kids 4 & 1) across the street but well worth it.  I've been to this restaurant before, and the food is pretty good, but the competition in the area is a lot better. Updating my review to two stars based on previous visit, because I am less irritated as Burgatory filled me up, but I won't be back again. Too many better options around that actually want your business."
Kathryn F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,102,20,3.0,8/24/2015,"DOWNLOAD THE APP ...it has call ahead seating.  The food (salmon, shrimp, ribs, steak, pizza) is always very good.   The hostesses and management need to get a better seating system. I put in for 2 people for a 4 person booth  (the 2 seat booths are tiny) OR a 4 person table.  Got there 15 minutes prior to planned arrival, checked in .... and waited 45 min for a table.  We watched multiple tables of 4 be seated ... I spoke to hostess multiple times ... couldn't grasp the problem ... Getting past the front door is the only hurtle ..."
Maria E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,17,,5.0,7/14/2017,"My husbands favorite place. Food is consistently good, the menu is big and we haven't had anything we didn't like yet. Our pizza took a long time and came out with onions when we had asked for none so they comped our bill and gave us a second pizza for free."
Jamie S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",99,10,,2.0,1/16/2017,"So ok, it's a holiday and people are off, but one bartender during a heavy lunch service is ridiculous. And he is doing the best he can no doubt, but shame on BJ's.  and he is really good. Mgt must have their heads up their ass as usual at restaurants.  Food, very good. I had unlimited soup and salad. I had chili, broccoli cheese, and a wedge. All very enjoyable."
