Beth M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",94,8,3,4.0,12/27/2016,"Have been here several times over the past year or so and have really enjoyed all of our dine-in experiences. However, takeout out has been less than satisfactory. If you are a Sally like me its best to actually eat there then to try and order through the app. Any special instructions I have submitted have not been followed through on.  I have enjoyed their specialty brew flights and my daughter really likes the homemade sodas. Try the brussel sprouts appetizer you won't be disappointed. And the gluten free pizzas are some of our favorite."
Jenny C.,"Gibsonia, PA",61,100,22,4.0,8/25/2015,"Note: this was my first visit - I will update again Time: Tuesday 4:00pm We were immediately greeted and asked if we had the BJ's app on our phones. - If you have the app they will scan it and automatically apply any points to your account. With the app you may also pay through your phone.  By paying this way you will receive a 20% discount off your bill.  We had zero wait time! To drink I ordered the peach berry iced tea (non-alcoholic).  It was very light and refreshing. The refills were free! I had the barbeque pulled pork sandwich with shoestring french fries.  The sandwich was delicious.  The pork was tender, the onion straws were crispy, and the sauce was both sweet and smokey. The downfall of the meal was the fries.  While crispy and flavorful they were also cold.  My only regret is that I was too full to try one of their exciting desserts! Next time I plan on getting a dessert and maybe trying one of their many craft beers."
Daniel C.,"McKnight, PA",14,3,,2.0,6/28/2016,"Well, 4 stars for the half dozen times I've been here in the past, 0 stars for my most recent experience (6/28/16). I'll say we'll split the difference at 2.  *Editors notes: I might have written the better part of a mark twain novel here, so I apologize. 8:30pm - walked in to the restaurant with my lady friend, greeted kindly by the hostess. ""Just going to sit at the bar, thanks"".  8:31pm - sat at a pair of open seats at the 60% occupied bar. DIRECTLY in the middle. Easy enough.  8:32pm - bartender, who is a slightly younger than middle aged woman, passes by my area, and without stopping, turns her head to say ""make sure to get your IDs out"" Strange, I think, because even though I'm relatively young, my lady friend and I are both in our late 20's. Haven't been asked to order anything at this point, mind you. The tone of this premature ID request was a bit accusatory, prompting me to think, ""it's like a damn police state."" ""Do I need an ID if I was ordering soda?"" 8:40 pm - ""do you know what you want?""  ""Yes"" I reply. Lady friend orders, I order, ""piranha pale ale please"".  ""Have you had this before?"" ""Uh, yes?"" Strange question. She asks ""would you like to try it?"" ""No, I'll just order one"". 8:43pm- drinks arrive. ""May we also have a menu?"" ""Sure"". Menus are acquired. 9:00pm - (this is 15 minutes later) ready to order. Awkwardly opening my menu, closing my menu, placing my menu closer towards the bar, stacking both menus. Every common ""sign"" that a table is ready to order. Eye contact with bartender established, signs of hope, then hope is lost as I spend the next 10 minutes watching bartender pass back and forth, awkwardly avoiding eye contact. 9:10 - starting to get irritated. Aside from shouting at bartender vs. lighting myself on fire in protest, I can't seem to afford her attention. Getting too uncomfortable and awkward to order. We determine that unless we're acknowledged in 5 minutes, away we go. 9:20 - my 5 minutes turned to 10, I finally lean over the bar, and ask for the check. ""Sure"". Check arrives. I pay in exact change, leaving a $1 tips per drink. $2 in total extra on a $13.11 tab. We take our leave. 9:21 - I'm across the street, being seated at Burgatory, where I had a delightful experience before a 10:30 movie. I will be going to Burgatory from now on. Moral of the story, I'm PAYING you for food and drink, don't make me work that damn hard for it. The food is standard American chain restaurant fare, although not bad by any means, not worth being unappreciated as a patron."
Roy R.,"Baden, PA",111,607,4,5.0,6/9/2015,"I never do a 5 rating. But... now I do for the new BJ's that just opened up.  Family was there for the soft opening, and we (Alicia and I) went on Monday for the first day.  Quality control.... every server had a corporate trainer/shadow.  Kitchen -- all cooks and su chef had a corporate trainer/shadow.  Manager, Brian Torgerson, was all over the place for day 1... Beverages were as advertised, beers fine and most ""local,"" food well managed in presentation.   Honestly, I do not like chains... but this one seems to break that mold a bit by focusing on servers with people skills, then training them, and supporting them for nearly a month!   This model/template for chains is to be understand and respected.     A dozen big screens.  Bar seating excellent.  Great parking.  Visibility from route 19.  ...   A nice place for many reasons."
Victoria D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",64,148,5,3.0,7/10/2015,"2.5 It hurts my heart to write this because I went here three days after its grand opening and everything was amazing.  The food was great. The service was honestly the best I can remember having at a restaurant.  I ordered their Asian salad and the chicken was cooked to perfection I came back on Monday of this week during lunchtime to meet my family for a quick meal.  My quick meal ended up taking over an hour and a half for a total order of: 2 unlimited soup and salad meals, the santa fe salad, and my brother got some type of chicken dish.  Aside from the fact that they have one group of people waiting on tables and another group running the food and that is clearly extremely confusing and only causes more issues than productivity, I think the entire process needs a review.  I think their way of trying to be efficient having people designated to sections & tasks in this huge place is more negative than it is positive. I won't get into details, but my parents' soups and salads were coming out in doubles without spoons, our waiter was nowhere to be found for a period of time, three different people brought out the orders.  It was just chaos.  My brother and mom had also been here on two separate previous times within a week and had the exact same issue with the confusion. They have really really great food here plus an extremely extensive menu, but if you are looking for somewhere to go on a date or somewhere to relax, I would give BJs a couple months to get everything sorted out and settled.  I know I will wait to go back."
Christopher A.,"Sewickley, PA",200,20,47,5.0,6/9/2015,"BJ's has been under construction for awhile and it finally opened the other day, and I'm so happy that it did. Right from the start, you can tell that BJ's is a legit place.  I thought it looked nice on the outside but once you walk into the foyer, you know that this place isn't messing around. Such a sophisticated yet casual environment. You can go for a casual lunch with friends or a classy dinner with some co-workers.  They have a huge bar area with a wall of liquor, planked by two massive televisions. Perfect for any sports go-er.  In general, it IS a brewhouse and they have an endless list of craft beers. They even have a ranking/rating system of the beers on the menu that tells you what each beer is well paired with.  I thought the Cheesecake Factory had the biggest and best menu... but I must say, BJ's is going to give it a run for its money. It took be awhile to figure out what exactly I wanted, which is a good thing. They literally have anything and everything: burgers, tacos, deep-dish pizza, fish, fried chicken, etc.  At first introduction, the staff was a little too up-front and personal with me but my waiters ended up being super nice and sociable. Very knowledgable about the menu and especially the beer! They even have a mobile app where you can pay right on the app, rather than with your server. The app also utilizes a point system that earns you rewards over time.  I recommend this restaurant 100%."
Krissy G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",45,102,416,4.0,7/9/2015,"Great place to try a variety of beers (and other drinks), as well indulge in a wide selection of food. It's a great place to narrow down your likes or dislikes (order a sampler!). There's really something here for everyone in your family - yes they even have a kids menu and root beer on tap!"
The Reviewer S.,"Butler, PA",12,16,6,1.0,10/22/2016,"Terrible from start to finish.  Don't waste your money or time!  We had dinner here last Saturday, chose to sit at the bar, first mistake.  The service was painfully slow, the bartender, an older guy, was not interested in waiting on us, he was more interested in washing glasses.  We ordered the deep dish pizza, gourmet 5 meat pizza, wings and boneless wings.  Both wings were terrible, cold, hardly any flavor or sauce.  I failed to mention we also ordered Mediterranean chicken tacos which never came.  We all had belly aches on the way home.  This place sucks, TGIFridays is better and that's not saying much!"
Erica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",51,78,62,4.0,8/24/2015,I ordered the turkey burger which came with a salad. It was really good. I only going to give it a four because the bun was a little stiff. It would have been better with possibly a softer wheat bun to go with the healthier concept of the sandwich. Overall I enjoyed the restaurant. Nice atmosphere and good food.
Ron A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",27,3,,2.0,1/15/2017,"This is one of those places that has just about anything you could ever want to eat. The downside is it tastes like frozen, processed garbage. Very similar to NPL."
Mary Beth P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",24,7,,3.0,4/1/2017,"We almost didn't go to BJ's because we had trouble trying to make a reservation. Called to make reservation on a Wed for Fri night. The phone recording clearly states they take reservations for 7 or more. Young lady who answered took my information and said she needed to check with a manager to verify availability and I would receive a phone call within 24 hours. Thursday comes and no word so I call back & there is no record of my info from Wed call. So I leave my info again. They say I will receive a call Friday morning to confirm & to ""stay by the phone."" Friday, the day we are requesting the reservation for 7:30, 3:00 PM comes and no confirmation call. I call again & there is no record of our reservation. I was exasperated. I explained all of the above to Terry & she assured me she was personally pencilling us in. When the first of our party arrived they were told it would be  another half hour & they don't take reservations for parties of 7 (it clearly states on their recording they do.) Anyhow we were seated by 7:30. They pack you in! The service was wonderful, food good. They were very accommodating by bringing out the Birthday cake we had brought w  candles lit- no annoying Birthday song! I would recommend going here again but if you make a reservation, follow up because the staff doesn't seem to know how to do it."
Kyla W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,9,,1.0,12/29/2016,We've been here a few times but this will probably be our last.  Went the day after Christmas so the wait for a table wasn't the issue.  The lack of staff made it a miserable dining experience.  The server was overwhelmed with too many tables so we had a few different servers bring out appetizers and food with drinks out to us.  This created a mess at the table as no one was clearing out plates or collecting our empty glasses and there was no server to refill our drinks.  We had to also wait for our check.
LaMar W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",27,62,51,3.0,2/24/2016,"New restaurant in my neighborhood and went there for a fund-raiser event.  Service was polite, but ultimately crappy, because we had one very nice, very kind waitress who was in charge of over a dozen fully-loaded tables all by herself (not her fault, but strike one star). Had the mozz sticks (meh) and the Sriracha-drizzled Brussel sprouts (something new), which I probably would have enjoyed more if they hadn't lost that battle with Smaug before they came out (practically charred black).  What wasn't burnt black was very tasty, but they clearly swore revenge as they went down (the aftertaste lingered for HOURS after and the gas was...  OMG it required apologies). Anyhoo...  my main entree was the mushroom-swiss burger and fries with a side of BBQ sauce.  The food was accurate, but we waited forever, and everything but the fries came out room-temperature, due the above-mentioned service/staffing problem.  The bright spot?  The fries!  The fries were a wonderful surprise: long, salty, super-thin straws of crispy, potatoey goodness. Om-nom-nom!!  Oh, and that side of BBQ sauce was amazing. All-in-all, I recommend going and will try this place again myself, but make sure that it's during a time when they're not so understaffed."
Jen M.,"Glenshaw, PA",0,2,,2.0,6/15/2017,This was our first time dining at BJ's.  The place is spectacular to look at but the food was just ok for the prices.  It did take a while to get our food and the food was not hot when it came out.  I don't think we will go back.  I noticed a table next to us waited a really long time for their dessert.  Our waiter seemed stressed.
Tara W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",17,17,81,3.0,6/17/2015,"We arrived early in the evening at about 5pm and were seated before the dinner rush. Parking is a bit nutz - not enough spaces!  Servers are new and eager but some kinks need to be worked out. Great positive attitudes though so, no doubt improvements will happen over time.  Beers and hard cider were great and large amount of selections on menu.  Calamari came with two dipping sauces that were tasty separately and together  Crusted chicken dinner was wonderful but side dish veggie of broccoli was skimpy on amount.  Tortilla soup is amazing - definitely get some just make sure you get a spoon with it lol.  They make a great presentation of pouring the soup into your bowl which contains tortilla strips and a few other things but forgot my spoon - not a big deal but it took three requests just to get a spoon and it was darn worth it with that soup!  Jambalaya is awesome and pretty spicy.  Will try this place again. Especially because my fiancé loved the craft beers.  Oh, I really liked the decorations of framed pics with a vintage vibe. Nice place! Happy vibe."
Tom W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,2,,5.0,6/5/2017,"Stopped in for a late dinner with my daughter. Food was excellent, we had the pineapple pizza, service was good. All in all a really nice experience."
Joe D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",405,549,447,3.0,1/5/2016,"Another ""warehouse"" brewery with exposed pipes, air conditioning, and light fixtures. Time to retire that look, it's been done to death at the Rock Bottom, Dave & Buster's,  and hundred of other chains. Want to see a beautiful ceiling while drinking beer, head to the Church Brew Works.  BJ's is located in the new McCandlis Crossing off McKnight road. Another giant hodge podge of Ethan Allens, Super Cuts, Trader Joe's (this is Pennsylvania, no two Buck Chuck, TJ Brew or Trader Joe's Cafe) and other boring chain places that dot the western Pennsylvania landscape. BJ's is new to Pittsburgh, a brewery/restaurant/bar miss mash with their beer as the star of the show. Stopped in with a friend, had a double IPA, not bad, tasty, hoppy, floral in the front, hints of lime, grapefruity finish. 5.75 a pint, my friend loves stouts and enjoyed their version. We'd eaten before stopping in for a nightcap but did look the menu over. The large menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory, lots of choices, lots of calories, a few lighter menu items caught my eye like the salmon over quinoa & vegetables, at 1050 calories, I didn't find that very light. Fish tacos, flatbread, deep dish pizza, and burgers make up the bulk of this menu.  One thing did catch my eye though, they carry brews from other breweries, including the Pius Monk Dunkle from Church Brew Works. Kind of odd to carry brews from other local brew houses, IMO. In a world of chain restaurants, when something new pops up give it a try."
Tony R.,"Bonita Springs, FL",104,8,,1.0,8/20/2016,I put my name in at 606pm on the app and checked in at 630. The app said I had a 60 minute wait. Once I got to the restaurant they quoted me at 1.5 hours for a total of 2 hours. When I asked the manager he said I haven't waited that long. Overall it's not his fault but it was handled poorly. This is my second bad experience. I planned to use a gift card the company sent me because of my previous bad experience. I'll give them another chance since it's still new and the people are nice.
Teri H.,"Andover, OH",6,25,1,4.0,9/17/2016,Noisy and crowded on a Saturday night but our party of 6 got seated quickly. Service was slow. Of the six meals ordered only one was unsatisfactory. The turkey burger did not have enough patty to fill half the bun. However the Mediterranean Chicken Taco Pita was wonderful.
Ms P.,"Warrendale, PA",0,11,,4.0,4/8/2017,"We've been there 2x now and had a good experience both times. Well technically 3 the first time we left because the wait was too long - def call ahead! Large menu can be a little overwhelming. We've tried the deep dish pizza and it was very good! My husband and daughter raved about the siracha Brussels sprout appetizer. We also tried the artichoke spinach dip which was good but not great wouldn't order it again. Two of us tried the prime rib dinner (weekends only) comes with soup or salad and their cookie:pie dessert. Everything was very good, although order towards the rare side the med was really med/well and the medium rare was medium but tastes great. Overall a good experience would definitely recommend it. Large dining room  And fairly noisy good for families and larger groups - prob not for a date!  Service was good and so was the food! My only complaint was a glass of wine was really $$ - maybe stick with beer instead!"
