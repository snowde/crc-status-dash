Kaitlyn B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,17,3,1.0,9/30/2016,"I previously had 4 stars for this, but my opinion has changed.  The past 3 times we were here we waited over an hour for our food.  Our stupid fault for going back, but I like the Oasis, which they are also consistently out of...so I don't know why we return.  Last night we sat at our table for 15 minutes before we got up and left.  Went to Longhorn, got a delicious burger, 2 cocktails all in 30 minutes and made our movie on time!"
Lindsay L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,5.0,11/4/2016,"Food never disappoints - great variety if you happen to be vegetarian-- menu is always open to modifications.  We come back weekly for Holly, who serves us in the bar area amazingly.  On her days off- we enjoy sitting at the bar with Darnell.   Other servers are hit or miss, but never deters us from returning. We thoroughly recommend BJs overall."
Anthony P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",56,3,,1.0,5/2/2016,"Food was great Service... Yeah not so good Typically come here at night and the servers are great.  But today during lunch  We had this waitress named ""Anna C"" Things she did wrong  1. Not attentive (restaurant wasn't busy) 2. Forgetting orders (ordered a salad and she never brought it)  3. Laziness, which she spent 20 minutes cleaning one small table which just needed whipped down 4. Took forever to return my credit card  5. I asked for a drink almost 20 minutes later ""sorry we dont have it, bad batch""  Things she did well.  1. Got our drinks right  If you are to go to this restaurant  Don't let her serve you, she was pleasant with a passive aggressive attitude.  Ive been in the food service industry for years, and it seems to me this server didn't care about her job."
Liz G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,51,41,2.0,11/5/2015,"I really really want to like this place ! I have gone 4 times. The first time was good. I ate at the bar with friends.  Had a pizza and some apps and it was great.  Second time I went with my husband. I got a salad with shrimp and the shrimp were absolutely horrible. Tiny and tasted so fishy and old. Not the way shrimp should taste. Waitress took my plate, and pretended to not notice that all my shrimp were pushed to the side with my salad barely eaten.  The 3rd time my husband and I went with another couple, and their twin babies, who were 4 months old. Our waitress started out great. Really friendly. But then almost got too friendly where she felt comfortable enough to complain about working so long.  She put our appetizer order in, and the apps were good. About an hour later, my husband asked about our food. She said ""don't worry it is coming!"" After another 15 minutes, he asked again. She had a distraught look on her face all of a sudden, and said she'd be back. Then the manager said she forgot to put our order in !  Let me remind you the 2, 4-month old babies who were with us. About 20 minutes later we got our order. The waitress came to our table, did not apologize or even acknowledge anything was off. It was so unprofessional.  My husband and I went back a 4th time this past weekend and got the siracha cheese nachos for our appetizers and the cheese was cold, and was not spicy or tasty at all. He ordered a chicken salad and I ordered a pizza (cuz at this point I'm nervous to order anything else, to be honest!) and my pizza was so cold when it came out, and my husband (who isn't picky about his chicken) said the chicken was really rubbery and tasted old.  I really wanted to like you, BJs, I just think you need to work out a lot of kinks before I'll go back for a while unfortunately."
Karen O.,"Allison Park, PA",0,17,6,4.0,10/18/2016,"Ok, I now I just wrote about not patronizing franchises, but this menu is great.  The sirachi Brussel sprouts are to die for.  They even honored a $10 off coupon I found on line.  The McCandless crossing location has been a favorite of mine 3 for 3 tries."
Farah A.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,15,75,5.0,1/6/2016,"Bj'a is my cheat day destination. If you are looking for a menu with low calories stay away. Literally everything in their menu is delicious. For the appetizers, I recommend the avocado egg rolls they're really good! A bit spicy and the sourness of the dried tomatoes gives it a really unique taste! Another favorite is the deep dish pizza. I've been here many times and I've been always satisfied with the service!"
Shawn M.,"Youngstown, OH",0,9,2,3.0,4/14/2017,"Very crowded and the staff was pretty nice!  They seem to have issues with communication among staff though.  I would give 5 stars, but my food was cold.  I would've asked for it to be heated up, but the poor guy waiting on us had like 15 tables and was running like crazy.  I'll definitely try it again."
Brianna T.,"Allison Park, PA",165,5,1,1.0,1/5/2016,"Went in for a quick lunch and came out two hours later frustrated and annoyed. We went when the system was down and our waiter could not handle our table and the other three that he was waiting on. It took half an hour to get our order placed and another 45 minutes to get our food. When done with the meal we waited 15 minutes for him to take the check and credit card but got so tired of waiting that we, along with the other tables he was serving, have cash and left rather than waiting for him to show up.     The food was lukewarm and overly greasy. 0/10 would recommend to a friend."
Ed S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",15,104,17,2.0,11/11/2015,"Eh experience. Had some beers which were solid and a good price. Nice interior, clean . Food was not good ,had a bison burger and fries. Burger was way overcooked and nothing special. Fries were ok. I understand it's a chain store restaurant and it pretty much fits the mold of one. I'd go back for beer and maybe try something else to eat. Nothing made me say to myself that I need to come back here though."
Jason F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",150,1178,154,2.0,11/7/2015,"I stopped by here last night, a Thursday, with four other guys for dinner.  We were planning on eating at 7 and one of our party arrived there at 6:45 and was told that there was a 50 minute wait.  That ended up being almost spot on as the text message came in at 7:30 telling us that our table was ready.  The inside of BJ's looks quite nice as it is large and fairly open.  On one side of the restaurant is a large well lit and well stocked bar while the rest of the restaurant is for seating.  They also have a large chalkboard menu for their beer selections, a large number of TVs and some random open garage doors as dividers. To start off the evening I went with a sampler of their beers and picked their Irish red, imperial stout, pale ale and IPA.  All of it tasted pretty good with my favorite of the bunch being the pale ale which had an interesting flavor to it.  After getting our drinks we all put in our entree orders and I went with the sriracha chicken macaroni and cheese.  In the meantime I pulled my silverware out of the napkin and put it on my lap.  The napkin was wet and would ultimately end up getting my jeans uncomfortably damp.  I didn't say anything at the time but at a later point it came up at our table and we found out that four of our five napkins were this way.  Our food ended up taking almost an hour to get to our table.  I chalked it up to the place being busy but whenever we looked around we discovered that no one in our section had food.  Whenever the food was finally delivered it was quite the disappointment as well.  The chicken in my macaroni and cheese was cold (thankfully precooked) while the rest of my dish was luke warm at best.  So I asked the table whose dish we had waited on as one of ours ought to have been hot.  Bizarrely everyone's food was pretty cold and even the deep dish pizza pan that they had carried out to our table with tongs was at room temperature.  My buddy next to me had the wings and took one bite before sending them back because they were cold.  Another friend ate half a shrimp taco before noticing a grey shrimp and stopping.  In the meantime I plowed through my luke warm pasta and cold chicken.  The flavor of the food actually wasn't that bad as i loved the cheese and sriracha with the chicken.  It would have been so much better if it was hot though as who likes cold Mac and cheese? My buddy who got the cold wings ended up calling the manager over and politely informed him of the issues and asked if there was a problem in the kitchen that night.  The manager informed us that they just got backed up and didn't really say too much else.  His whole visit to our table lasted around 45 seconds and he ended up comping every meal at the table which was nice.  So in the end, all that we ended up paying for was the beer and tip. The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back here again in the future.  My friends strongly urged me to give it a 1 star review and I considered it.  While this was certainly one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I have had recently, at least no one that I know of got sick and there was the positive aspect of good beer."
Jennifer C.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,14,,1.0,3/19/2017,"We arrived 6 pm on a Sunday and told 30 minutes for party of 3. We watched as party after party, including a group of 19 were seated in front of us. Finally told we were next then saw yet another group seated in front of us. We left at 40 minutes and went to Longhorns. We won't be coming back."
Kerry M.,"West View, Pittsburgh, PA",23,13,,4.0,10/13/2015,"So, I have given Bj's 3 tries. The first time I went, I was with my boyfriend and we shared a beer and a couple appetizers. It was the middle of a Saturday and we had no wait. The waitress was great! Food came out quickly as well as our beers. The pork fries on the app menu is delicious and the flatbread was just ok. I enjoyed my experience and encouraged friends to try it out as well. The second time I went was with 3 girlfriends and it was less than stellar. I ordered a flight of beer and was disappointed when knowing nothing about the house beers could match them up to the appropriate name better than her. It was awkward. That was the first time I tried the personal deep dish pizza and it was probably the most amazing thing ever. Our waitress for the table was nice and sort of attentive but the amount of other people that come to your table to bring drinks, salads, entrees, is unbelievable and weird. It makes it hard to ask for refills or even an extra napkin. So, after this time, I understood the complaints about slow food and service from friends.  The third time I went was with another couple. When we showed up, we knew there would be a wait since it was a Sunday night. The way they have the front set up is weird with 2 different stations. Even though I had already been there, I was unsure which station to go to. We put our name in and waited by the bar. After waiting for about half an hour, we asked if the booths in the bar area were seat yourself, they said yes! Why didn't anyone tell us this! So we sat at an empty booth and proceeded to have a pretty good time. I ordered the jalapeno cucumber margarita which was delicious and my friend ordered a house made crème soda which she said was amazing. We all ordered different things, deep dish personal pizza, alfredo pasta, brisket burger, and another deep dish personal pizza. We all finished our meals and they were all very well made.  In conclusion, I will keep going  back because the food is so good, just knowing the service is VERY hit or miss and you should pace yourself on any drink because you are unsure when it will be filled again."
Ryan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",109,24,14,2.0,12/10/2015,"I have been to BJ's twice now and was extremely impressed after my first trip.  I ordered the Barbacoa Chicken with Rice and black beans and my girlfriend got the pesto chicken sandwich, both of which were delicious.  We also ordered the sliders, which were really flavorful - but the buns were really greasy. I was excited to take some friends there after having a really good first experience, and we went back yesterday and couldn't have been more disappointed.  The menu is very large, which in theory isn't a bad thing as long as you can make all of the dishes well.  We ordered the avacado egg rolls and a mini pizza for appetizers.  One of us got chicken tacos and 3 of us ordered burgers done ""medium.""  Our appetizers came out a few mins AFTER our main courses.  The Medium burgers all came out WELL done.  Zero pink in the middle, char burnt on the outside.  It made for an extremely below average burger experience.  The avacado egg rolls has a brownish tint to them - which indicated that the avacado wasn't prepared freshly.  They were very average.  The pizza and chicken tacos were really good - and because of the mixup with our order the manager comped us our dessert.  We got a few pizookies which was the highlight of the night.   All in all really disappointed with the service.  Most of the knocks on this place are service related and it starts from the top down (management).  The servers were really polite and seemed to be doing the best they could.  Also don't waste your time ordering a burger here, opt for something else."
Charlotte D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,11,,4.0,6/11/2016,"I am mainly pleased with B.J's Restaurant. The food is sometimes too greasy, but everything else is great!"
Joe U.,"Wexford, PA",0,24,6,3.0,7/29/2016,"We would really like to like this restaurant. Visited four times and each time the food is uneven and the service. We have the watermelon and feta salad.  We asked for something to be substituted for the Feta. We were  told we could have avocado our surprise came with the bill, there was an additional charge. The avocado eggrolls were great. And they do hamburger and french fries pretty well. The price seems out of line with quality of the food. It's in such a great location we will probably try it again but if you're going for burgers and fries I probably would try the near by bistro or burgetory."
Julie D.,"Wilmington, NC",380,1200,1382,3.0,8/4/2015,"If I had written this review earlier, it would have been 5 stars.  After last week, they get three.  We had visited on some very busy occasions and each time, the wait time was reasonable, service was good and the food was great.  The bf loves all the brew choices and would be happy to dine here everyday of the week!   We have tried items from their Enlightened menu, keep in mind even though the calorie count is fairly decent, the fat content is still pretty high.  We tried both the salmon and the chicken/spinach quinoa bowls and both were very tasty.  We also tried the barbocoa chicken and the Asian chopped chicken salad, delicious.  My favorite meal here was the bison burger served with tasty slaw.  The bun was perfectly toasted, the meat was a perfect medium well.  Not from the Enlightened menu, the bf had the clam chowder in the bread bowl.  Best bread bowl ever.  Amazing.  One time, we even tried a calorie laden Pizookie.   With all these raves about the food, why only 3 stars?  As fans of the restaurant, we had downloaded their app and used it on our last visit to get added to their ""preferred wait list"". We were given a 40 minute wait time estimate, so we planned our arrival time around that.  When we arrived, there was only about a dozen people waiting.  We were told, so sorry, but the app doesn't really work and we should have called instead.  But they would do their best to get us a table in about another 20 minutes.  We went shopping at Trader Joe's and then decided not to wait for BJ's and went elsewhere for dinner.  Wouldn't you know, we had finished our meals when we got the text from BJ's that our table was finally ready.  Needless to say, we have not been back.  After being open for 2 months, customer service should be improving, not going downhill.  You give a guest the expectation of being seated in 40 minutes and you can't deliver that in over an hour and a half?  Ha."
Nichole A.,"Mars, PA",128,1,,1.0,2/26/2017,"I really want to know how this restaurant functions on a night that it's actually busy. Came here for my birthday tonight. My sister in law tried calling ahead to make a reservation as it was going to be 8 adults and a baby. She was told that we couldn't get a reservation because our party was larger than 6 people (first red flag). However, she was assured that they are NEVER busy on Sunday nights and that we should have no problem being sat right away. Okay then- we decide to go. Get there just before 6 pm. There's a decent amount of customers in the restaurant, but nothing crazy. We go to the hostess stand and are told, ""Oh, well since we have to push two tables together, it's going to be a 45 minute wait."" We were hesitant, but then looked at how many tables were open + how many people were leaving the restaurant and figured it wasn't going to even take 45 minutes (and probably wouldn't have anywhere else), so we put our names in and wait. And wait. And wait some more. Meanwhile, all these small parties of people walk in and are getting sat right away. During this time not once did either of the hostesses come to check in on us or say they were working to get a table together for us asap- just nothing. Finally, after an hour of waiting my other sister in law, husband, and their baby (my niece) have to leave because the baby is getting restless. THE WHOLE POINT OF US GOING WAS TO BE TOGETHER FOR OUR BIRTHDAY DINNER. So we go back to the hostess stand to let them know that our party is now going to be just a table of six. As we walk up to the hostess stand, the hostess literally looks over my fiancée's head to ignore him and sit another party that had literally just walked into the restaurant. I'm ready to leave and just go to Panera at this point, but we decide to stay. I wish I could say it got better from that point on, but sadly it did not. We were sitting for about 10-15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Then as we're getting our drink order, my future father in law tries to order a beer, but our waiter interrupts him to tell him that the beer he wants is very similar to another beer and that he'll get him a taste of both (ummmmm okay?). So he goes back and gets our drinks. My future in law tastes both beers and orders the beer he originally tried to order to begin with. At this point we don't know how much longer we'll have to wait until the next time we'll see him, so we figure we need to order our food as quickly as possible. I we order appetizers. And wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, we get plates, only to realize that we weren't given enough plates. Oh, and at this point we don't have silverware or the beer my future father in law order. So we say something, finally get the amount of plates we need and the silverware. Still waiting on the beer. The beer finally arrives, but it's the wrong beer. Luckily, that gets fixed fairly quickly (and by fairly quickly, I mean we only wait 5-20 minutes before the correct beer is brought out). Finally, after being in the restaurant for almost 2 hours, our appetizer arrive. I wish I could say they were terrible, but they were pretty good. We had the chicken pot stickers and lettuce wraps. Then we got our food- oh, except for me because they messed up on it and our server surprisingly caught it and had it fixed. We finish our meals and then then bill came. We see that nothing was comped even though we had expressed our grievances throughout the dinner. At this point, I'm ready to scream, but miraculously hold it in. My future father in law says something to our server, who responds with ""oh, was it anything I did?"" Weird. But, we did end up getting some of our meal comped. The manager never came out to apologize or check in on us what-so-ever, so it's clear as to where the problems stem from. So, that was mine and my fiancée's birthday dinner...... The only reason that this is getting one star is because the food is good. Horrible service and there is clearly a management problem, but decent food. Sadly, it's not good enough for me to ever go here again."
Elizabeth M.,"Ross Township, PA",164,191,55,2.0,8/9/2015,"The service here was so bad...we waited forever for our meals, our glasses ran dry begging for refills and the waiter forgot several of our requests. The only redeeming factor was that I did find the food good and I know the restaurant just opened, so I'm hoping the service improves and this was just some new restaurant jitters."
Rick A.,"Glenshaw, PA",11,17,3,4.0,8/27/2016,"Waiter was great, food was good however my friend and I got the same rack of ribs and mine was noticeably smaller. Waiter apologized but manager never came around. Craft beers were pricey compared to domestic."
Alexis P.,"Coraopolis, PA",1,20,40,1.0,12/4/2015,I couldn't wait to get to bj's. I ordered take out and was extremely disappointed when I got my pizza. The pizza was dry and the cheese was over done. There is no way this pizza would have made it on the menu because it looked nothing like the pictures. Someone just threw this thing together. I was starving and the place was packed and I didn't feel like waiting for them to fix it. Not the best experience to say the least!!
