Sumeet K.,"Plano, TX",44,71,18,5.0,5/8/2017,Amazing place when it comes to good food (with tons of healthy options) and cheap beer. Their own beers are really good as well. Just tell the server the name of the branded beer that you love and they will tell you their matching or similar beers (typical of brewery) !! I love their enlightened menu options as well. Great service on this location. A minor issue happened where our tables were cleared after we went to the restrooms. We had asked to have the leftovers to-go'ed. But tables got cleared by mistake. Manager was courteous enough to get us the complete new order of our food made and packed to-go (in 5-10 mins) along with an apology. Very polite management and top customer service. :)
Hannah M.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",0,15,17,3.0,10/2/2017,"Went to BJs for a date late dinner date. I was craving dessert so I ordered a chocolate chip pazookie. It was delicious, soft warm cookie and two scoops of vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend orders baked zitti. His pasta wasn't fully cooked and it was pretty bland. It came with a garlic knot and the knot was hard as a rock, so we didn't bother eating it, wasn't very appetizing. We had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, those were cooked to perfection. Very yummy, will order every time I go there!! Service was exceptional, as usual. The energy there is always great too, it's a great place to catch games and drink some beers. I'm giving them 3 stars because of the baked ziti, it definitely fell short of expectations. Will definitely go back, but I won't order the baked ziti again."
Aubrey E.,"Celina, TX",181,42,34,1.0,8/24/2017,"I usually always enjoy my experiences no matter how it turns out but BJs Brewhouse did NOT make a very good 1st impression.  The food wasn't to our liking and I tried my girlfriends and my other buddy's sirloin (he was our 3rd wheel :) ) Please have the owner contact me. We had to check on our alcoholic drinks due to wait time; luckily I ordered water and lime. I never got the lime. The alcoholic drinks got there right before the food arrived (15-25min wait).  Service was terrible despite it not being ""too busy"" but she still earned 35% tip. We didn't even take the food home; sirloin went to our handsome huskies."
Dallas G.,"Dallas, TX",210,21,262,1.0,4/30/2017,"One star for being able to fulfill our 1 hour call ahead reservation. We arrived at 5:50pm and were seated by 6:05pm. I chose this establishment for my sister's birthday to accommodate some picky eaters in our party.  We ordered a couple of appetizers, classic fried mozzarella sticks & spinach artichoke dip. Basic as it gets.  What really bothered me are the plates. They were so filthy, greasy and wet. I had to find another server to switch them out. Only to get another set that were just as disgusting. That really pissed me off. I couldn't help to think how unsanitary the kitchen is, how they prep, handle food and drinks.  They also had no Chimay and Heineken in stock. I ordered the deep dish pizza. Pretty much raw vegetables thrown on top.. the line cook may have hoped it'll finish cooking from the residual heat? The meat, pepperoni, sausage couldn't taste anymore fake than it was. I also ordered a side caesar salad, dressing on the side. It was on the side alright, but recall the dirty plates? My ramekin was most likely was pulled from the dish pit (see pic), crusted with old food and oil, nestled on my salad. Perhaps the dishwasher might not have been working properly tonight?  We brought our own birthday cake and was given to our server before the meal. When it came time, I expected the server to at least get it out of the box and place the candles on it. Nope. We had to open it up and prepare everything in front of my sister. Nice cake surprise presentation huh?  The managers never stopped by to do quality or experience checks. One of them dropped glassware next to our table. Didn't apologize or made sure the other guests were okay. To top it off, he picked up the shards with his bare hands.  Careless in all ways possible. What a pathetic experience."
Josh H.,"The Colony, TX",221,47,21,4.0,4/14/2017,"I have been to BJ's only a few times in my life, but have always had a great experience each time I've been.  This location in particular is close to my work and a great place to come for a quick bite and break from the mundane! The menu has a great range of various items for the health conscious to the eh... fried conscious *shamelessly raises hand*.  I will say, if you are one that gets a bit overwhelmed with a small novella menu of options, stay focused...they have a lot of options :)   The food here is always great and reasonably priced.  This trip I had the California Club Sandwich, which was a grilled chicken breast with cheese, avocado on toasted bread.  It was very good. My work colleagues said that the Ahi Tuna salad was great as well as the BBQ sandwich.  Our server was kind and efficient.  The desserts are definitely worth a look...that pizzokie especially.  (a cookie pizza....um YES!)."
Ray F.,"Dallas, TX",78,414,158,2.0,4/2/2017,"I was with a party of 9 on a Friday evening.  I was with a date and we were there 30 minutes early.  We made our table request for a table and were told 45-50 minutes.   So we went on to the bar to wait. The bar staff were friendly, but no Bushmills.  I settled on something else and waited.  At the 40 minute mark, we were told they were ready for us.  It was a booth and that wouldn't work with our group.  So we waited another 10 minutes and a table was ready.   As we were sitting down, the staff dropped a drink which splattered on my open toes and my cast.  As a couple of wait-staff began cleaning up the liquid, another dropped his tray with a loud bang.  Three times during the meal, one of the waiters knocked into my chair. Of all of those incidents; one apology on a chair bump.   The food was delivered with the expected confusion for a large party's order.  All was quickly sorted out. A couple noted the pizzas were not really well cooked. The rest loved their meals. We ordered desserts and for some reason, one was brought to go (mine).  (I guess they really wanted me to leave?) The billing was also a problem and took a couple of tries.   Other than that, the server was attentive. Another note, the background music was quite loud which required all to have to talk loud.  My ears were actually ring when we left!     Perhaps it was the party size?  The crowded Friday?"
Larry J.,"Dallas, GA",256,44,22,5.0,3/18/2017,"This is an excellent place to meet with friends and family for good mixed drinks, beer, food and watching sports!  Me, my sister and Mother ate here after shopping.   my sister had a Chicken Salad that was huge. My Mother had the California Chicken Club, and I had the Smoked Salmon With Cherry Sauce. All three of us loved our meal! The Smoked Salmon With The Cherry Sauce was so good! I have eaten at many white table cloth fancy restaurants and this dish blow every dish away that I have had at every fancy restaurant.  Totally Delicious!   My Sister and Mother both had margaritas and I had a mixed strawberry drink that tasted like strawberry cheesecake!  That drink was so good.  Also, I guess due to the size, you not only have your waiter, but there is another person floating around making sure every table was alright.   I think that is an awesome business model for any large and very busy restaurant."
Harvey S.,"Frisco, TX",163,217,123,2.0,8/1/2016,Over the years I've been here many times.  Lately the service has become spotty at best.   Today at lunch we had to wait 15 minutes after being seated before we were able to get a servers attention.  The manager came by and gave the perfunctory sorry and promised to speed up our food.   It didn't help.  It still took a long time and my companions chili was just above room temperature.    We will have to find another place.
Joe M.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/14/2017,This restaurant in plano always seems to not meet my expectations. I go to the one in addison quite a bit and it is excellent. I used my app ( member) to reserve a table early. I show up and they say no reservation. I check my app and I have a bill on my app. They gave my seat to someone else who is no using my account number. They manager closes the tab out. Never offers an apology. So calmly I sit at the bar. I go to the desk after 15 minutes and they say we have been texting and calling u for a table. I check my phone ( only number they have) no texts or calls. They top it off with lying after they gave away our reservation with no apologies. Guess I have had enough. Time to move on. The waiters seem r To turn over a lot and the service has gone down hill. Next time another place
Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,950,1677,4.0,9/23/2016,"My team did a fundraiser here one night. They call them ""spirit nights."" The restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected. They have a bar area and a general dining area. Their menu is a bit overwhelming because there are SO many options. I couldn't figure out what I wanted because everything sounded amazing. They have gluten free options for those with a food allergy. I chose to get the ahi tuna salad. It was great! Light but filling! They actually give you a good amount of tuna.  The food is decently priced and the portions are a good size. I would definitely recommend stopping in here."
Yong Y.,"Richardson, TX",61,214,345,4.0,12/7/2016,"Oh man, their tap beers are pretty good. Light yet still hoppy and dark. Super good. But please don't get their berry blast cider. It was not good at all. It tasted like some energy drink which I hate. Anyways. My bf got the blonde ale which was so much better. Upon opening the drink menu, we ordered the Taster Sampler and asked our waitress to pick some good ones. The taster sampler is the way to go! You can choose and it's more variety. Who doesn't look that? I got the kale salad and my bf got a burger. The food was decent but the beers left a better impression on me. Maybe that's because I haven't drank any beers when I go eat out now?  For dessert, we got the chocolate chunk pizookie which is great as well. Service was good despite us coming in at almost 10 pm. I like how their hours are late so I don't have to drive to Cafe Brazil for some mediocre food and non existent service.  Definitely recommend here for late night, non-breakfast meals! Also, they have reverse happy hour from 9pm-11pm!"
Toya H.,"Richardson, TX",0,19,4,3.0,10/8/2017,"Pizooki is good but not worth the huge cost of $6+. Think Papa Johns cookie pie, but only a 1/3 of the size.  I've never dined in, only ordered twice for delivery- which was through Doordash- which is a very fast service and I like it. Last time I ordered they forgot the fries that go w my burger UUUGH (even though there were a few fries somehow stuck to the cheese on my burger) and didn't honor the substitution I asked for, so I guess typing it IN ALL CAPS on the app wasn't good enough. Decent food overall though."
Ashley B.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,1,1.0,9/1/2017,"HOLY COW. I ordered the Brussels sprouts appetizer and had it delivered to work, and the sulfur smell from how burnt they were spread throughout my office. They were literally inedible and I had to throw them away and apologize to everyone around me. The picture of them on the menu looks great, so I was pretty disappointed."
Shannah H.,"Plano, TX",243,726,1111,4.0,10/23/2016,"I really like BJ's - for a chain, it offers good quality food, consistent service and an easy in-and-out dining experience. The menu is very extensive (ala Cheesecake Factory) and probably could be edited down. That is, if everyone else is like me and tends to order mostly the same things every time they visit. The other thing that's nice about this location is the large dining room that somehow balances offering lots of seating without becoming impossibly loud."
Annie C.,"Richardson, TX",33,100,363,3.0,1/8/2017,"The service has always been consistently well with patient and understanding staff members. Combined with the beers, service, and atmosphere, this restaurant could have easily been one of my go-to American dine in locations, but the food is the main issue. It is strange how every time I have their baby back ribs, I get food poisoning later that night (moments after consumption) or the next day. That never happens when I eat barbecue, with ribs being my favorite meat to order, so I must say there is some peculiar ingredient(s) in their rub and sauce, both of which taste great and complement the tender meat below.  The food is always the most important part of dining in a restaurant, and because I cannot stomach their food, I am giving BJ's three stars."
Angel M.,"Plano, TX",0,20,,1.0,1/23/2017,"My husband and I have been to this particular BJ's several times. They offer a variety of meals, including some gluten free options, which is wonderful for those who, like myself, have a gluten sensitivity. Food aside, this review is more about the service, or lack there of, each and every time we visit.  My husband and I are young. I'm going to assume this alone gives waiters the impression that they can be a little more lax with us and treat us more like buddies than paying customers. We also both order water because we actually just LOVE water. There is a shift in service after the drink orders as well we've noticed. I suppose they think we are trying to save some dollars where we can? Be cheap customers? Can't say for sure. Our most recent visit was the last straw. My husband and I were seated at the two person booth right next to two tables that sat four. Our server gave great attention to those tables while we were ignored. We had to get our waiters attention to ask for an appetizer because we weren't even asked if we were interested in one.  For the entree my husband asked for tomatoes on his pizza which weren't even there. He told the waiter to which he replied - ""Oh, they are there, they're just really small."" Really? He didn't refill our waters not once even though we put them in clear view at the edge of the table. We were left with empty glasses for the last 20 minutes of us being there. He then walked by to drop off the check in the middle of us eating without saying a word. By the way, we had planned on getting dessert. It would have been nice if this were offered instead of, what felt like, him rushing us out of his section by placing the check down two bites into our entrees. We had to again call his name as he was walking away from one of his two tables of four to ask for dessert...to which he barely acknowledged with a nod before running off.  All around just awful service. My husband used to be a waiter and I worked in the food industry for 6 years. We both understand working for tips, so we always tip well even if it wasn't deserved. It is a shame that we get stereotyped as ""that young couple that probably won't tip well so we shouldn't even bother with giving them great service"". It is frustrating and insulting. ALL customers should be treated equally with great service.  It will be some time before we go back to BJ's."
Patricia S.,"Dallas, TX",2,101,,1.0,3/23/2017,"The trifecta of fails. Once again, after making a reservation AND talking with a ""manager"" our group of 20 had to wait for a table to be made ready for us WHICH took half an hour. But dog forbid they should be ready for people who plan ahead and notify a restaurant that a large party would be arriving on a certain date and time. It WAS nice to see that they had NO problem seating a party of 14 who walked in without a reservation.  Cold food, waiters who had NO idea of where to put the food, ""oh, not finished your soup yet sir, here let me place this plate of ribs on your soup bowl then"".  ""Your turkey burger is cold? I'll have the chef make you a new one, 30 seconds later, here's your nice hot freshly cooked burger!"" Maybe I'll be back one day. 3 years with no pizookie, I kinda would like to try one. Once."
Ify O.,"Dallas, TX",364,129,223,1.0,6/9/2016,"Ate here plenty of times and never had a bad experience. First time ordering to go and it was a disaster. All I ordered was a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Got home and the cookie was hard and completely burnt. Literally thought it had to be a joke because it was clear you should NEVER serve this to anyone! Completely ridiculous and never plan on ordering to go again. Like one of my fellow Yelpers said ""More like a pizpoopie..."""
Kartik P.,"Atlanta, GA",52,191,78,2.0,7/7/2016,"I should have not ordered Chicago Deep Dish in Texas. Just like the physical location of Dallas, the pizza was no where close to the deep dish that I know of. It was a bread which was stuck in the oven till it cooks and then topped it off with tomato puree and onions, peppers and meat of your choice. Really thats how you are going to make the deep dish? And moreover you have a full page of menu dedicated to deep dish!  Anyways I would consider it my mistake of expecting something more.  The other party on my table had their soup and they did not seem to have enjoyed it either. I wouldnt be able to comment on what they did not like but yea no more Bj's :P (jk)"
Ginny T.,"Murphy, TX",186,61,111,3.0,7/1/2016,"I recommend coming here to try their hand crafted beers and pizookies.  Bjs has such a diverse menu. From salads and quinoa bowls to pizzas, steaks, wings, pastas, and grilled cheese sandwiches; there's an option for everyone. I really enjoy eating their burgers with wedge fries but I heard their deep dish pizza is a good option as well. Their appetizers are pretty large so feel free to order one to eat as your entree. I recommend getting the grilled chicken flat bread pizza which comes with chicken, tomatoes, avocados, and bacon.  As for their pizookies, they come in two sizes: regular and small. A small is about 3-4inches in diameter and is usually enough for around 3 people to share. My favorite would be the chocolate chunk or white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie but if it's your first time here and you're not quite sure what to get, they have a trio option which allows you to choose 3 different small pizookies with a scoop of icecream on each.    Their service was not the best. The waiter seemed to be in a rush to give us our checks and only refilled our waters twice during our dine in even though we were out of water. We paid before dessert and didn't see our waiter after that, leaving us with no water when the pizookies came out. Pizookies tend to make you thirsty but because we never got refills, we left dehydrated."
Queen D.,"Plano, TX",219,35,2,2.0,6/2/2016,"Seriously....come here at least once a week....but all of a sudden the service sucks, so that will be changing. Everything is so slow now . The last two service members we had, took way too long between visits to check on us. It took 20 minutes to get out first glass of wine, yesterday....and 20 minutes to get dessert today. I brought my brother,  BJ (ironically), to here for the first time today...and he's already said he will NEVER be back. Damn. What has changed?!? #nothappy Check please!"
Pam D.,"Addison, TX",153,619,1091,4.0,7/23/2015,"After a long week, some ice cold beer was in order. I knew my husband would enjoy the large, no nonsense selection of food, too.  In comparison to Yard House, a similar concept, BJ's is more family-oriented and less trendy. Yard House usually has 50 or so craft beers, while BJ's focuses more on their own beers and only offers a few craft beers.  We arrived around 6:15pm and as such, we were able to order drinks at the happy hour pricing. I really enjoyed the IPA brewed by BJ's.  We shared a deep dish pizza. Although we were turned off by the pricing - $23 for a large! - I have to admit the pizza was quite good. Unlike traditional Chicago deep dish, the crust has a nice, lightly crunch cook on the outside. The dough and fillings make up a light & fluffy inside. A large is easily splittable by 4 people- or you can take home leftovers like we did.  Our server was great! Very attentive, friendly, and frankly one of the best personalities from a server I've had in a long time. He was really honest about his preference on menu items, which I love from a server.  Overall a good experience. We would gladly return if we are in the Plano area."
Cory M.,"Austin, TX",308,30,11,5.0,1/5/2017,"I absolutely love the experience we receive every time we come to BJ's. My wife and I are what you would call ""regulars"". We live a block away and visit at least once a week. We understand that no restaurant is perfect, but it's how you handle the situation when adversity presents itself that is important. To name a few names, Matthew is an AMAZING server (Mason is awesome too!) and Michael is a STAR dining room manager. We genuinely appreciate the service we receive and hey.....sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name. ;-)"
Vinny N.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2017,"Service was not the best. It took 10 minutes get water, and 45 minutes to get our food and it was not even busy. They gave my Girlfriend and I the wrong type of fries, and her hickory brisket bacon burger was dry and the meat was uncooked. The meat was still soft and pink. Also no water refills and to get the check was another 15 minutes. I would not recommend this location for BJ's."
Zi-on C.,"Dallas, TX",434,246,122,3.0,2/24/2016,"Very few things in life beat a reverse happy hour, especially one that lets you get away with half-priced personal pizzas (though they're more like pepperoni breads than pizzas) and a dollar off their already affordable draft beers.  Their golden child is the pizookie, but other than that, the rest of the litter are duds. Still, if you're ever in the need for a $5 Laguanitas IPA on a weeknight, this is the place to be."
Hugh T.,"Richardson, TX",0,11,9,1.0,3/8/2017,"The new management vis horrible, I asked to have my food prepared a specific way due to health reasons and management didn't care if they cooked it correctly. This is the worst BJ's Restaurant I have been to lately. We have been coming here for several years not anymore. We are going to where Cristina works."
Charon G.,"Plano, TX",0,5,,4.0,7/2/2017,"Good food Awesome service by Tim Fuller great guy, the ribs the wings the watermelon salad just fantastic"
Faaiz A.,"Plano, TX",1,36,,2.0,8/4/2017,"Food was good, as always. I come here decently often and the food is not the issue. My problem was that the last time I went, I had a terrible waiter. I understand it was late at night and he must have wanted to get home asap. But do your job man, you're getting paid to work, not be ridiculous to your customers. No such thing as free money, do a proper job and earn your check. Guy was condescending, grumpy, and actually banged the table out of frustration."
Dmitry B.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/26/2017,Very good beer and food and vibe is always good. That's got to be a reason why their parking lot is always full. One of my favorite places.
Kat O.,"Carrollton, TX",353,102,193,3.0,3/9/2016,"BJ's is the younger, hipper sibling of Chili's or Friday's.  The beauty of BJs is their extremely lengthy and diverse menu. Any time you and friends can't decide on a place, BJs is a safe bet, serving multiple genres of food.  To further distinguish themselves, BJs is a brewery with decent in house brews! I recommend their heifewiezen for a smooth finish.  I only had two appetizers on this visit: avocado egg rolls and spinach artichoke dip. The egg rolls were great! The chips with the dip were way too thin and broke every time I tried to dip them... talk about frustrating!  On a previous visit, I had their lime quinoa chicken bowl. DELISH!  This place is great for work lunches and family dinners. Go try it out!"
Alexis P.,"Frisco, TX",438,43,234,2.0,7/19/2016,This BJ's was packed for a Saturday early dinner! Definitely expected since it's right next to 75. I didn't end up eating too mch because I was already full. I was with my BF and his brothers and they started with queso and chips. It looked like any normal (average) heated up queso. Both his brothers ordered BBQ brisket burgers and they both said it was okay. His younger brother said his burger has like 3 pieces of brisket. My BF got an Ahi Tuna salad and he said it wasn't very good. He didn't finish it or take it home. I got the Portobello Swiss burger which was okay but the portobello mushroom was way too chewy for me to enjoy the burger. Service was good though!
Anthony V.,"Corsicana, TX",0,17,,5.0,3/21/2017,First time here. Good quality food. Will be back to try other things. Great beer selections a lot to choose from.
Ellen T.,"Plano, TX",65,25,9,4.0,10/19/2016,The food and service are above adequate. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. My only complaint: the music is a little too loud which makes good conversation a little difficult.
Matt W.,"Dallas, TX",238,181,159,5.0,1/28/2016,"The 5 Meat Pizza is the way to go. They have a variety of different drinks (alcoholic and sodas). My friends and I got the large pizza, wings, and calamari. For 3 people, it was quiet a lot of food and we even took some to go. A medium pizza would have done the trick to get us full, but we decided to get the large.  The service was great and we were always getting our waters filled up by the servers. Great environment, and even though it was a full house on Friday night, they knew how to take care of you!"
Iztihaad H.,"Plano, TX",2,59,81,3.0,1/14/2016,"Just here to say their famous Pizookies weren't as  great as it was advertised. They were overly rich and melted the ice cream too quickly. Not my kind of place, but my friends won't choose where to get dessert next time without gold research. Edit: The platter pizookie deal they have is a much better option for when you go with a group of 6-8. It'll get finished quickly and come out equally quick."
Jeff B.,"Plano, TX",7,116,712,4.0,7/9/2016,"Love this place mostly for their deep dish pizza, but their broad menu has a lot to offer.  This time we went for their blonde beer battered fried asparagus and shared the chopped barbeque chicken salad with light fried onions on top and a wrap filled with pepperoni, sausage and cheese (basically a pizza inside a wrap) that came with a zesty tomato sauce dip.  Food was fantastic as always and service was friendly but our waiter always seemed in too much of a rush for us to ever finish talking to him.  Still, overall I'd give this place 4 stars, mostly because I've never had a bad food experience here."
Dawn S.,"Plano, TX",384,76,460,3.0,8/19/2015,"Came here for lunch, their prices are good and there's tons of selection on the menu, took me a while to make a selection but I finalized on the half chicken club flat bread with salad for less than $8! The salad was a small portion, pretty simple paired with vinaigrette, the flatbread on the other hand wasn't so good, I think mainly because they flavored it with a lot of ranch sauce, too heavy and it overlaps the natural flavor of the chicken, avocado, and I believe bacon or pepperoni, I ended up having to wipe some of the ranch sauce off.  Service was below average, we waited around a few times not being checked up on, but in their defense, lunch time is a packed house, also when they gave me my flatbread they accidentally swapped my order with a gentlemen from another table... Still gave it to me because apparently he hasn't touched it. Not the most appetizing start but I was starving, after the few waiting periods. I wouldn't recommend BJ's food to anyone, and their service isn't anything you can count on, i'm not a beer drinker and I noticed that's one of the things they're known for, but can't supply much input on that. I don't plan on coming back."
Mike F.,"Longview, TX",19,55,1,2.0,3/20/2017,"This is my third trip to a BJ's Restaurant and probably my last. $13.50 for a hamburger is too much money. Later that night I had basically the same burger for $6.50. Four of us generated a lunch bill of $74.00, plus tax and tip. They are nice clean restaurants and normally have good service but the high prices lower the overall value rating so it is not on my future agenda."
Yu-kwong C.,"Plano, TX",90,204,954,4.0,11/21/2015,"Tried Pazookie trio for the first time. It was wonderful! The ice cream went really well with the warm, soft cookies. Sweet, creamy, and flavorful. Will definitely try again next time."
Angie D.,"Richardson, TX",30,6,2,1.0,11/20/2016,The food is bland and very very over priced.  $15 salad that didn't even have freshly prepared meat. Soggy food.  Horrible service.  Go ANYWHERE else in the area.
