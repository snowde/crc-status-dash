Brad H.,"Spokane, WA",26,66,9,1.0,11/7/2010,"We've went to BJ's consistently in California and until we arrived here, never had a bad experience. We waited over 50 minutes to get our food here, the service was awful! The table behind us was consistently getting food the whole time we were there because of the many mistakes they had made with their food. The manager is a complete moron and the kitchen could not keep up with the full house. This is the last time we eat at this BJ's! Do yourself a favor, head over to the Stonebriar mall in Frisco and check out the Cheesecake Factory, the food is great and so is the service."
Moriah A.,"McKinney, TX",194,23,1,4.0,8/1/2009,"Let me start this review with saying, stick to the basics.  If you know it is good, don't venture away.   We love BJ's pizza.  Now it isn't as good as Star Pizza (in Houston) or Pizza Port (in San Diego) but it is about as close as we have found in the Dallas area.  It is great, deep dish pizza with as many toppings as they can pile on.  We ventured in for lunch just a few days ago and were awed by the salad and pizza special.  Seven dollars for this awesome combo, we understand the wait yet will be returning! (Their personal pizzas are usually $10 each) There have been a few times we ventured away from the pizza and those have been the only times we were not satisfied.  Other people are correct, it can take a little time to get a seat  (you can always grab a drink at the bar while you wait) yet we have always had good service.  Choose Jason's Deli down the street if you are in a huge hurry."
Petros K.,"Plano, TX",0,11,,1.0,1/25/2014,"I have been going to lunch  with a business partner for several years and iit was  always an acceptable place in terms of food and good service.  The last time I was there I ordered luncheon special quassadillas, there were two minuscule tortillas with hardly anything in them folded, very sad!. Tne time before we could not find the waitress to bring some refill ice tea or water, when finally we saw another waitress we waived and she brought some water, our regular waitress comes back and ask us  ""What do you want!!"" Verbatim. Iwe are not going back"
Thomas W.,"Plano, TX",10,442,,4.0,7/14/2013,"It's a chain, but it's definitely a step up from Chili's. The type of food you'll find is more or less the same, but a few notches better as far as quality goes. Craft sodas and craft beers aren't something you see everywhere. The food is very rich in sugar and grease, so prepare accordingly."
Dhara A.,"Plano, TX",5,2,,1.0,11/21/2012,"It was my first experience ever going to this restaurant and I was very excited to celebrate my birthday here. The food was excellent but the service on the other hand made my night terrible... At first I already had a wierd feeling about the ""experienced"" waiter and her demeanor towards me and my friends. To be honest, it felt as if she didn't want to serve us. Our meals were finished and we were ready to pay. When all the transations were done, she claims that one of my friends hadn't paid, when we clearly saw himr put a bill in the folder... She approached the situation as if we were little kids. She was rude and VERY sarcastic.. How can you wait 10 tables at a time and not get the tickets mixed up? Well, my friend talked to a manager and he wasn't so forthcoming either. He was nicer about the situation but having all the restaurant employees just stand there to stare at you while dealing with a situation seemed very unprofessional.. I can tell you right now that my friends and I won't be coming back.."
Joseph B.,"Dallas, TX",464,600,274,4.0,3/28/2008,"One of my roommates and I had a craving for burgers, but we originally had intended to go to Fuddrucker's up Central, but we got there like 10 minutes before closing, so we just decided to go somewhere else on our way back home.  I am so glad we stopped here. Their bacon cheeseburger was ginormous! It was the size of my palm. I cut in half so I wouldn't get so messy and I only ate half because we wanted to check out their lovely beers. My roommate had ordered the chili cheese burger deal, it was huge and messy. He had to fork and knife it! We both had leftovers for the next day. Just awesome.  The beers they have were great. Although, I kept ordering the Harvest Heffeweisen. Once you've found something good, don't change it! Ooooh, we actually arrived right at their happy hour, 9-11pm and they have another one from 5-7pm. We lucked out. My only complaint for this place is that it's no smoking in the bar area, so we had to keep going back and forth outside for smokes. DAMN YOU Plano! I think the establishment understands us smokers, so they at least put several benches outside with ashtrays next to them."
M. V.,"Sachse, TX",15,52,2,3.0,1/2/2014,"Good food, but this visit the service was a little off. Not to busy but we had to remind the server about a side salad that didn't make it to our table. The husband had a burger but thought the added grilled onions over powered. I had a mini chicken, bacin, ranch deep dish pizza, very good. Their advertised happy hour menu looks promising we hope to come back for this."
Cynthia W.,"Austin, TX",496,4,,4.0,7/6/2013,"Overall, the food there is decent, and the place is ideal for families or hangouts. The lighting in the restaurant is sort of dim in some places, and they usually have sports games playing, so it's pretty noisy.  I went with some friends to celebrate a birthday, so it turned out to be a pretty great place to hold such an event. We chose a blue cheese flatbread/pizza appetizer. I would not recommend this if you are not a fan of the strong blue cheese flavor. The pasta I ordered was okay. It was not really special or anything.  However, if you plan on going here, be sure to leave room for dessert. The pazookies are just amazing. It's probably a good idea to share one with another person, because each pazookie is quite big. We ordered the triple chocolate pazookie and it was like a piece of heaven. Just amazing.  In summary: Appetizers and main meals aren't very special, but the desserts are definitely worth the visit."
Stephen W.,"McKinney, TX",167,88,33,4.0,1/16/2011,"This place is great! Very nice beer selection and the ""In-House"" brews are pretty tasty and nice quality (Not brewed on site at this location but contracted with St. Arnold out of Houston). The bartenders in my experience are pretty good and dress professional. The food is not bad at all, I always do enjoy having the pizza here and service is nice. The atmosphere has a nice them to it and border-line classy for a pizza and craft brew joint. This is a place you need to check out! Hang out at the bar or grab a table. Also has a nice, HUGE flat-screen at the bar."
Ashley R.,"Frisco, TX",238,219,9,4.0,1/24/2013,"I enjoy going to this BJ's...The wait staff is always friendly and funny and quick to correct any mistakes that they may have made.  I am also a big fan of their enlightened entrees menu; it definitely takes the guilt out of having a mini pizookie for dessert.  Their Thai Chicken Mango Salad is delicious (though I did have some awkwardly large lettuce leaves-which by the way, were not your standard iceberg lettuce), and their fried artichokes were so good too!  Their oreo pizookie is my favorite, ala mode of course (see! the salad was necessary!!)-I like the oreo flavor because it's not too sweet and makes a delicious cookies and cream dessert.  As far as beers, I am totally loving their Nutty Brewnette.  Not because they named it after me, but because it's a great dark beer that is not super heavy.  My only complaint is the parking, but it's not that big of a deal; most of the spots are on the side or behind the building, so if you're there when everyone else is, you will end up walking a little further."
Andy P.,"Dallas, TX",262,503,8,3.0,1/27/2010,"We came here with my parents last night and I was surprised at how ""nice"" it is inside. Compared to some of the other chains, I really like their bar and dining area. The tv's around the restaurant and brightly lit bar are definitely excellent for gamewatching. My dad tried their red ale and I had the lager-ish beer and they were both pretty good. We shared a pizza and the santa fe spring rolls which all turned out to be pretty good. My fiancee had the jambalaya which was ok for a pizza place. MY only complaint is the food/bvg prices are fairly high for this type of restaurant. It was $4.75 for a pint of beer, our medium pizza was $20, and the entree prices are well over $12 each. I might come back for beer and some appetizers but will probably skip the food unless they have specials."
Alex L.,"Plano, TX",29,50,5,4.0,9/8/2010,A tad expensive. Get the deep dish pizzas. They are GOOD. Nice clean atmosphere. The rest of the stuff is ok. Tried the french dip sandwich and burgers and they are just ok.
Erik S.,"Garland, TX",1,13,,5.0,4/10/2011,No shortage of great food here. Large quantities and moderate pricing. You cant go wrong with a large pan pizza with meatball/ham.
Debbie J.,"Wylie, TX",99,258,5,2.0,7/13/2010,"Did not have a good experience dining there this past Saturday.  The fish and chips are listed as ""favorite"" and it was a disappointment. Saturated in grease and no taste.  Also, the Sante Fe salad was just as bad.  The Manager did comp the meal and invited us back.  I doubt if we return."
Langly L.,"Plano, TX",13,84,3,2.0,5/16/2012,"I really like some of the salads here. I've had them at other locations. This is my second time to this location. The first I waited 5 or 10 minutes and no wait staff made contact. I left. Second visit. I seat at the bar. I order a Water with lemon and ahi salad And explain i need it quickly. This open so no one is here. Water arrives with no lemon. I ask for lemon. I get one lemon slice, while the bar staff make each other smoothies? Wow. It takes me 10 minutes to drink the water and it sits empty for about 4 minutes. Salad comes in a little over 10 minutes with more lemon and check. Start was a little rocky. My expectations are a little higher for an $18 salad after tax and tip."
Kristen M.,"Plano, TX",0,16,,4.0,1/13/2011,"The food here is consistent-not sure how much is made in house, but....the spring rolls are to die for, delicious, the flat bread was pretty good. The pizzas are inconsistent, and for the price, they really should be spot-on at all times. Great drink selection, cool place to hang out for HH. I always go  to BJ's when it's time to kick back after work."
Brooke G.,"Dallas, TX",67,230,59,5.0,10/11/2008,"Fabulous raspberry iced tea and a wonderful pizza: the hawaiian pig.  Go get you one!  I usually only need the individual to make me happy.  It's deep dish, gooey, with succulent tomatoes and sauce to boot.  Bring a friend if you want a larger pie, you'll be miserable later but you'll be smiling ;)"
Mary S.,"Garland, TX",109,223,8,4.0,10/5/2009,"I like the food here, but I mostly go for the beer.  They have about a half dozen of their own house brand micro brews, and a pretty good selection of imports.  I believe their house beers are on tap, most if not all the imports are bottled.  They have a full bar and a menu of predictable mixed drinks, mojitos, margaritas, and all sorts of frou-frou  fruity stuff.  Pizza is Chicago style deep dish, the outer crust maintains some stability, but the top seems to go soft under the weight of the sauce and cheese.  The pot stickers on the appetizer menu are really good, the Angus Beef Dip is one of the best I've had.  The menu could use some tweaking to give it more originality."
Cynthia S.,"San Diego, CA",149,165,1,4.0,11/12/2008,"I just went here with my mom and a bunch of her friends.  I wasn't expecting much, but this place was really good.  I had the Harvest Hefferviesen (I know I didn't spell that right) and it was really good.  I also had the fish tacos and some of my mom's spinach artichoke pizza....yummy!"
Patrick K.,"Plano, TX",6,31,2,2.0,10/13/2011,"Pizza is good but don't order anything else. I ordered the grilled pork chops which you would assume would be grilled. No, they were those precooked prepackaged pork chops that had grill marks stamped on them and microwaved. NASTY! I could not eat them and had to send them back. Ordered the fish and chips, which at least are fried there, and they were okay but not impressive. If you are going to offer a menu item that says ""Grilled"" at least have a grill to cook them on and not some nasty microwave entree that I could have bought in the freezer section at the super market."
