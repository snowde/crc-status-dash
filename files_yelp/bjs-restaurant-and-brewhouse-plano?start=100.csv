A S.,"Plano, TX",26,140,133,2.0,8/30/2015,"I went here with my daughter . The food was good. The problem was when I received my credit card statement. My bill was around $14 dollars. I gave a $3 tip. So my total bill should have been for $17.  When I get my bill someone had decided to give themselves a bigger tip. My statement said $20.  If this was done to me I wonder how many other people this has been done to. I did let the manger know and got an apology and a free meal in the future, which was nice of him.  I never did get an explanation as to why this happened, and that's what I wanted to hear. I had to email him twice. So just a warning to check your statement when you get it. I also let the manager know the name of the girl who served us."
Robert B.,"Irving, TX",7,261,,4.0,2/11/2015,"I've been here a number of times. My buddy meets me here to drink, and it's close to our work. I usually come here just to drink, well we and usually get some appetizers too. I've never had a problem with the service, even when we sit at a table, but we usually sit at the bar. Food has always been decent too, a little pricey. $ 10 for calamari app. My friend comes here all the time, it's his go to place"
Jeff F.,"Plano, TX",27,123,85,2.0,12/17/2014,"As I sit here, almost exactly 1 year from my initial review, staring at my empty tea glass, half eaten Jalapeno burger, and my wife sitting across from me with nothing to eat because once again they put goddam onions on her French dip sandwich, I stick to my initial review except I'm dropping a star. And yes, we are getting a free Pizookie. Great Job BJ's your consistency is amazing."
Crystal N.,"Garland, TX",333,43,62,4.0,10/26/2014,Buffaaaaaaloo chicken pizza & the wings are my absolute favorite here! Yum! & also the wideeeee selections of beer are awesone for you beer fanatics
Erin H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",44,211,23,3.0,10/14/2013,"The BF and I flew out to Dallas to pick up his new Harley then drove back to California. This was the first stop of our journey. This strip of highway has several eating options, including Redneck Heaven (which the man at the Harley dealership enthusiastically recommended) but we decided on BJ's simply because we were starving and we were close.  It was around 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't busy and there was no wait...well, not for a table, at least. We did have to wait about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us standing by the hostess stand, and when they did greet us, they offered no apology for the wait. Instead, the young man who came to the desk looked at us and said, ""how can I help you?"" Uh, a table so we can eat would be a good start? Not sure what the purpose of asking this question was...very strange.  Anyway, once we were seated our waitress came over and took our drink order. A few (10 or so) minutes later she came back and took our food order and brought the drinks. We ordered a deep dish vegetarian pizza with chips and salsa to start.  The chips and salsa were kind of weird, the chips weren't crispy. More soggy and very salty. The salsa was okay though. The pizza came out a while later and it was fine. Nothing great, but not bad either. It was bigger than we were expecting so we only ended up eating a few slices each.  We weren't offered refills on drinks or dessert so we just paid the bill and left. Overall, this BJ's is not the worst eating experience I've ever had, but I've certainly had better.  3 stars."
Peter H.,"Richardson, TX",567,453,522,3.0,12/12/2011,The house made sodas are pretty solid.  The cream soda and root beer are my favorite. The pizzas here are not fantastic but not horrible.  You go to BJ's for their awesome collection on tap and cool craft beers.
Tim S.,"Monument, CO",64,584,22,3.0,3/13/2014,"I will admit I've only ever had the beer here, but the food smelled heavenly.  The arsenal of house brews are very nice and worth a try.  Service is friendly and prompt.  Clientele tends to be local business types who aren't terribly obnoxious, which I like."
Lynda B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,161,4,4.0,4/15/2016,"We are from Colorado Springs CO. We are here working. Was glad to see BJ's here. Love the 1/2 price wine on Tuesdays. Jay was our bartender. Very easy to talk with and great service. Had the dry rub bone in wings and mini pizza., our favorites. Brook then came on after we were closed out but she was very friendly and made sure we were ok until we left."
Anonymous P.,"Richardson, TX",0,18,,1.0,1/13/2016,Had a horrible experience with a party of 13 people.  They forced us into a table that was barely suitable for 8 not 13.  Food was typical bar food and not worthy of being tortured in cramped seating.
Nick S.,"Houston, TX",60,233,943,1.0,7/5/2013,"Service sucks! Complete chaos. walked in and have been seated, then no server for the foreseeable future. I went to find a server myself. She got the order and another long wait. Food came no silverware. Again server went to find silverware talking to other customers on the way to get them. Ordered pizza that at BJ comes by default with parm and crushed red pepper shakers. No such provided. At each step sever takes 5 minutes to bring something, not counting the additionally requested stuff. Meanwhile, the manager is holding bossy some radio at the hostess desk and flirting with her instead of helping clueless servers or those with many tables. Otherwise good pizza."
Amy J.,"Justin, TX",7,19,1,5.0,12/7/2014,"Awesome job tonight! We had a party of 25-30 (mostly teen girls) and it amazed me how organized our waiters were. One's name was Dustin.. I can't remember the other gentlemans name. In any event... They were quick with the orders, kept the drinks filled and all the orders were correct! (Awesome job to the kitchen for being efficient). I couldn't compliment these men enough! Oh.... And the checks were separated in about 10+ ways... AND THEY WERE CORRECT! Thanks for all your hard work!"
Michael W.,"Plano, TX",23,8,,5.0,3/30/2016,Ventured here many times and the food is always great. Service was the best it's ever been. Friendly staff and attentive servers.
Melissa B.,"Garland, TX",132,510,173,4.0,2/26/2012,"First time here. Lots of beer to choose from. I'm a cider beer drinker and they even had a few options for me! Pretty cool b/c places don't usually have cider beer. The ribeye was cooked well and perfectly juicy. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were ok. My fiance liked them better than I did. ""They're dry like I like them"", says he. The salad was nothing fancy. My fiance ate every bit of his tilapia dish and our friend loved his New York strip steak. We didn't try any dessert on this trip. The food was good but a little pricey but all in all, not too bad."
Bosco Jones C.,"Dallas, TX",19,42,1,4.0,8/18/2013,"They deliver on good food.  The pizza's good.  Everything else is well thought out and tasty.   Bad points: confused identity - they say they aren't a sports bar!  What?!  They don't put sound on games.  There was sound today on a preseason football game.  Why not play off NBA, much less finals NBA.  Come on guys!   Service is good.  Manager is on point.  He came by a couple times before there was a problem.  I had a date sticker baked into the crust.  The waitress would not take no for an answer and immediately told the manager.  The manager offered to make us a * whole* new pizza.  When refused, he offered us desert, which we took.  That's good management.   I'll go back 100 times.  That's service.  That's pride in what you do.  Other good points, service is friendly.  Service is prompt.  Service is attentive.  The food is better than average and the deep dish is notably good.  It's a good chain.   It's not a first date place.  However, it's a ""we're established, but I want a nice place to take you kind of place.""   Long and short: I'd take a good girl there.  I think we'd have good fun despite it not being the hippest place and not in the hippest neighborhood."
Brooke S.,"Plano, TX",88,255,132,4.0,9/28/2013,"We've been here several times because it's a good microbrewery in the neighborhood.  The food is great and the beers are decent. Happy hour is the time to go.  Service is meh. Hostesses are always bored looking and douchey. Always. If my decision to go to this place ever rested on their ability to seat me in a timely fashion, and treat me with respect, I'd go running for the hills.  (Seriously though, hire some better hostesses.)"
Amy M.,"Atascadero, CA",3,2,,1.0,5/21/2015,"One of the worst dining experiences my husband & I had- ever. Waited an hour, never got our food, waiter (who was training) & the waitress (supposely training the waiter) never came over to explain what was holding up our simple pizza order- they just avoided our table entirely. In the mean time multiple tables who were seated & ordered after us received their food. The 1 & only time the waitress refilled my drink, she spilled it down my left side & had the nerve to say ""it's just water..."" Needless to say we will not be going back & will ensure all our family & friends know how bad our experience was..."
Dustin B.,"Glenpool, OK",18,16,4,1.0,11/3/2014,"I like BJ's in general, but I don't like sitting and waiting for a half hour to order. And unfortunately for our waiter, saying I'm sorry when you realize you you messed up the 7 guy check and tip doesn't really do much for me. Find another BJ's or find another  restaurant."
Renee C.,"Richardson, TX",97,144,138,4.0,12/26/2014,"I'm not really into chain franchises but I have to give it to BJ they know how to treat a girl. They have a great variety of food. I personally love their tortilla soup. It has a rich flavor combined with avocado and tortilla chips. Their pizzas and pasta's are great too. I've been to this location a few times and the wait time is normally reasonable. The service really depends on who you get. ( I've have varying experiences)  One thing that has forever trapped me as a customer is their pizookies @.@ the oreo, the cookie dough, the white chocolate, the red velvet.(drool.....)  I've almost had them ALL! If you've never tried a pizzookie you are missing out. I'm a little disappointed they removed some of the flavors recently but it's still an amazing desert I cannot live without."
George T.,"Richardson, TX",0,13,1,3.0,5/18/2015,"I was part of a large party of people having a graduation celebration at this facility.  The venue was very appropriate for the purpose.  The bar was very good the menu significant enough to meet the varied pallets of our group, and the prices provided great value for what we learned was very delicious food.  The unnecessary length of the wait finally yielded a culinary treasure chest of goodies.  As good as the food was, and even considering the great value we received; the inordinate wait was insurmountable.   I admit to being a fan and look forward to my next visit in the hope that a smaller party will result in a diminished wait and an enhanced rating."
Phuong V.,"Arlington, TX",20,146,65,4.0,1/4/2015,Its the typical chain restaurant from BJ. Nothing special compared to the others but the food is great and the staff is always good here. Ive never had any complaints of this location.
