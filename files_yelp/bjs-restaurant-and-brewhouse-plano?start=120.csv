Roddy S.,"Dallas, TX",100,103,55,3.0,9/26/2013,"For a Chain Restaurant that is super busy my service was awesome and the server was great, the food came out quickly and my food was good ( veggie Burger with Wedge fries)  The family ordered The spinach artichoke dip and they raved over it , but the chips were ehh. My wife had the fish and chips and it looked ehhh to me, she said it was ehh too and she would probably give a three star based on her food.  Now if you've had Old Monks fish and chips once or twice you'll ""ehhh"" others unless they meet that level of mouth watering. The menu at BJ's is huge and there is also a huge beer selection:)  The place was clean and for a cowboys football day it was not to loud."
Gaylen G.,"Plano, TX",0,11,,2.0,2/18/2016,"A friend of mine and I came here for dinner tonight. The food and service usually are decent. Our waiter was nice and the only reason we gave this 2 stars. I had the pulled pork sandwich and thin cut fries. The meat was lukewarm and the fries very soggy and cold. My friend ordered the sirloin steak cooked medium. The steak was overcooked and so tough that we could barely cut into it. The runner who brought out our food said ""steak"" and ""pulled pork"" and left without another word. The steak we sent back and the manager who came to drop off a burger instead didn't say a word either. When the check came the steak was still on it. We have both worked in the service industry and understand mistakes happen. This was just a bad display all around. Everyone just seemed to have better things to do. Definitely one of the worst restaurant visits I've ever had."
Zamora R.,"Garland, TX",104,14,1,1.0,5/30/2015,Had lunch here today with my family. Thought it was a good choice since they have such a variety on their menu. First we had calamari my children saw the picture thought it looked good. When it came to the table is full of tentacles rather than rings. Nothing like the photo and Not only was it only tentacles but they were overcooked and hard. Then came our meals I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger. Figured safe bet you can't mess up a burger well I was wrong. The bottom bun was hard the tomatoes looked old the lettuce was Wilted and the cheese was so burned it didn't even look like cheese. And the meat  was like roadkill flat full of holes it didn't even take up the bread. My four-year-old refused to eat it I decided to take one for the team and not complain and eat it and since then I have done nothing but taste my food for the last five hours. I feel so sick I would never go there again.
Chrissy W.,"Southbury, CT",0,20,,3.0,2/7/2015,"I went to BJ's for the first time last night. I ordered a bacon cheese burger and fries which was DELICIOUS! Our server was a very nice gentleman and the staff there all seemed very cheery. However, it took at least 10 minutes after we were sat for our server to come over. Again, another 10 minutes to get our waters and another 10 minutes for him to come back to take our order. It was a good thing my friend and I wanted time to catch up and weren't that hungry or else I probably would have said something snappy (I'm not me when I'm hungry...)"
Persia A.,"McKinney, TX",308,397,357,4.0,7/20/2011,"Place is GREAT! A little more expensive than it should be, but the food is great! Nice portion sizes and the entrees never disappoint. They are famous for their pizzas, apparently, which are pretty dang large. My brother got the Small size and it could feed 3 families (exagerration).  If you go here, you MUST try one of the Pizookies! They are giant cookies with ice cream on top. Can I say that they are the best cookies I've ever had, of ANY size?! SO FREAKIN' GOOD!"
Benjamin G.,"Addison, TX",0,4,1,3.0,9/13/2014,"I've been to this place at least five times. I try to be fair and objective, but out of the five times all five the service was terrible. Even though they weren't busy, the waiters were impossible to find or track down. Getting your drink, food or check will take quite a bit of time - so come prepared to wait. The only positive is their food is typically well prepared and presented. One of the worse BJ's that I've been to."
Shahbaaz A.,"Richardson, TX",247,108,,4.0,12/16/2014,"Their pazookies are famous! Oreo is my favorite. Food wise almost everything is pretty good, but I really like the chicken tenders with wedge fries. Their chicken fried steak is good also, it comes with 2 steaks :)"
Jessica J.,"Plano, TX",0,1,,4.0,8/5/2014,"Usually I love the place, tonight however is a completely different story. The manager had to come ask what we were drinking because our waiter was lallygagging. My waiter was acting like there were 20 other places he would rather be. As someone around children often the fact that he avoided a knife on the ground for thirty minutes instead of picking it up offended me. I did speak to the manager when I left, she was really attentive and thanked me. They are going to speak and hopefully it's never happens again."
Walter G.,"Euless, TX",25,89,52,5.0,1/19/2014,Been there several times.  Even when we had a very bad server we had a great time because the manager took charger to fix the problem.  Food is great and the ambiance is always good.  Lots of options and try the Jeremiah beer. Oh my...
Waseem N.,"Plano, TX",28,22,15,3.0,11/6/2014,I like BJ's menu and food ... but a few things are still lacking: - Royalty program suck! They need a better process - WIFI Access is not as easy as Starbucks ... come on .. make life easy ... this location is in the middle of the Technology area - Some of your staff dont have a friendly customer service attitude :(
Joey P.,"Dallas, TX",5,47,38,4.0,11/19/2014,"Great food. Amazing  orange cream soda. I eat at BJ's often but this is my first time at this location. Great staff, attentive and friendly. I will come back to this location."
Alice R.,"Plano, TX",1,58,75,3.0,8/9/2014,"I usually get one of the pizzas but I wasn't extremely hungry so I looked at the healthier choices. With less than 500 calories the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon seemed like the perfect choice. And it was! The salmon was perfectly prepared and all the spices and vegetable tastes worked well together.  The only thing keeping this from a five star review was the service. They weren't that busy, but my iced tea glass was empty for about 10 minutes. This was upsetting."
Lily Y.,"Dallas, TX",265,55,4,4.0,9/16/2013,"Went for a company lunch and it was my first time there. They were really packed on a Friday around 11:30, so it's probably best to make reservations well ahead of time.  We ordered the calamari to start off with. It was good. Not the best but hey it's still fried food~ I got the chicken tortilla soup (sooooo good!). It's a little spicy but not too spicy. Main dish: Cajun pasta. The pasta was very good too! Also a lot for the price. Too bad I was so full from the calamari and soup that I only ate a little of my pasta. At least I had dinner ready for me~ :D Service was good. I'm guessing since they were busy during lunch they were rushing us a bit when we were trying to order.....like lingering..."
Albert R.,"Plano, TX",0,18,,5.0,12/17/2014,This place is aweseome!! i went here for a quick bite in the later afternoon and was plesanyty surpised. The Manger ( think her name was christina) came and checked on me and was very friendly and hospitable
Hanh N.,"Richardson, TX",2,66,30,2.0,3/16/2013,"Never stopped by this place because it looks expensive.  However, many people I've talked to rave about BJ's famous root beer.  I LOVE root beer so I've decided to stop by to give BJ's a try and see how their food is. Husband and I stopped by @ 11am to avoid lunch rush.  I ordered the FAMOUS root beer to give it a try.  We ordered fried calamari, sandwich and soup and flat bread pizza/salad lunch special. - ROOT BEER:  not as good as I expected since there wasn't enough carbonation.  I still like IBC root beer over BJ's. - FRIED CALAMARI:  Like others have reviewed BJ's calamari, I agreed with them.  It wasn't crunchy at all.  It's more on the soft side.  Also, later guests calamari plate looks more than what we had, theirs look full while ours were half the amount.  My husband guessed that our plate was not full since we were the 1st ones.  Very disappointed in taste and portion. - CHILI with sandwich combo: The chili was ok.  Why?  It wasn't hot when it came out and the taste didn't stand out in flavor or anything.  Taste like it came out of a can.  Sorry BJ's. Overall, this place is like the high end, expensive Chili's.  My husband and I tried it before bringing the kids there.  Not worth for the whole family of 5."
Michael C.,"Plano, TX",33,170,18,5.0,7/22/2012,"BJ's delivers well on what it tries to be, a brewhouse that serves food. It's a great place for lunch because they have a host of great deals and they tend to get you in and out reasonably quickly.  It can be a bit loud or distracting, so intimate/romantic chats may best be held elsewhere...but it IS a brewhouse after all. On that note, grabbing a quick bite and a beer at the bar also works great.  If you want to watch sports, they have a quartet of giant screens right over the bar and some redundant ones scattered about the restaurant. For brews, my favorite is the Jeremiah Red, a full flavor and it does not hurt that it is the strongest beer they have. For meals, I like and heartily recommend the following, if you want some advice: - Ahi Tuna Salad -  There is not a ton of protein in there, but it's very good; beware the wasabi, they made it pretty strong last time I tried it - Baby Back Pork Ribs - the meat slides right off the bone, you can eat this dish with fork) - Half Sandwich & Soup - I like to specifically get it with the Turkey Cobb & Clam Chowder - Garden Medley Salad (add Salmon) - I would add salmon to this occasionally, but it's great alone; which is good, because I believe they use farm-raised Salmon, of which one can only eat to much (because of PCBs, not mercury)"
Jessica B.,"McKinney, TX",116,64,59,4.0,12/30/2013,"BJ's is one of those places that's easy to get to, a variety of different foods, and a consistent service.  Don't expect SPECTACULAR food, but they do have their specialties that set them apart.  I personally love getting together with friends and sharing a Large Pan BBQ Chicken pizza or the BJ's Classic Combo and pairing with one of their craft beers or a glass of wine.  It's one of those chain restaurants that you're not ashamed to say you went to (I'm looking at you Applebees and Chili's **cough, cough**).    I actually tried something off their ""lite"" menu a couple days ago and REALLY liked it and didn't feel like I was still hungry.  I got the Maui Glazed Pork Chop, which came with oven roasted potatoes and steamed green beans.  The veggies were crisp still, not soggy, and lightly salted with no sauce.  This truly is how you're supposed to eat veggies to get the most nutrients and I really appreciate their effort.  I will definitely be getting this again, because I'm already craving that pork chop!   All in all, if you're looking for a place to meet friends in Plano, this is a good alternative to satisfy different palettes and easy access to 75 & 190."
Joseph H.,"Tacoma, WA",367,204,122,4.0,1/5/2013,"Was inb town for work for a month and to be truthful we spent most of our nights eating here since the World Series was on. This place is awesome for food, beer and watching sports with out having to deal with a Buffalo wild wings atmosphere with terrible food  There pizzas are bomb, there sandwiches are delicious for what it is. I had a ahi ahi tuna something that was surprisingly amazing. Now the thing i loved the most is BJs brewed blonde beer. super sweet and super light with out being watered down tasting like cheap beer.  Would come here to eat over TGIF or any other place in the area"
Jackie C.,"Chicago, IL",144,543,107,4.0,11/30/2012,I love their Santa Fe Salad!
R G.,"Lewisville, TX",4,9,11,4.0,8/31/2014,"Came here with my wife and 13 month old baby. We were promptly greeted and taken to a table. They promptly brought a high chair for our baby, which was clean and complete, not broken like on other places. They also brought him some crayons and stuff to play with. Our server, Joi D, was very attentive and efficient. Our food and dessert were brought faster than we expected and tasted delicious. BJ's is one of the few restaurants that has rasp berry sweet tea, which my wife always asks for at restaurants. The cream soda I ordered tasted very creamy. We ordered a shareable hand tossed medium pizza with pepperoni, extra cheese, green peppers and jalapenos. The taste was great. Even our 13 month old was hooked up with the small bites of peperoni we were giving him :D After the pizza, we ordered a triple chocolate pizookie... OMG Two scoops of chocolate ice cream on top of a warm brownie. You have to experience this!! My wife and I are chocolate lovers :D so we both enjoyed this a lot! We went home completely satisfied and ready to sleep. We definitely recommend this BJ's location."
