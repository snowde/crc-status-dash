Alicia R.,"Plano, TX",88,118,18,3.0,4/23/2014,"There is a ton of food options to choose from.  You can't be disappointed with the avocado egg rolls, parmesan chicken, any fish choice, angel hair pasta and berry bursting cider.  There is usually little to no wait to sit down but when I go here I feel like the wait to be greeted by a server is always long.  I see them but we must be invisible for the first 15min.  That is really my only complaint but it is always frustrating."
Carli S.,"Plano, TX",94,8,1,2.0,8/16/2015,"I usually love this place food is always great servers are Alright. However tonight after waiting over 20 minutes just for our waiter to come greet us and then the long wait to get our drinks which were extremely over priced for what we got and waiting for our food. I had bragged big time on the place walking into it with my boyfriend I was even excited that they were playing a song by my favorite band when we first walked in. Everything went to hell after that. If the wait wasn't bad enough I finally got my food which after a few bites I found a HAIR in my mashed potatoes!!!!!! I've always been a loyalty member and always recommending the place to my friends but NEVER again. I even asked to speak to the manager who did absolutely nothing to help the situation. After declaring the place my favorite restaurant to it taking forever to even get a waiter to finding a hair in my food, to the manager not even caring!!! I highly doubt I'll be back. Which sucks because I really liked this place."
Nick C.,"Plano, TX",1,40,6,4.0,3/13/2015,"The restaurant is very nice with high ceilings which keeps the noise down and the air clean. Wait time 20 minutes on Friday night.  We ordered 2 salads, sante fe and chicken tender salad. Both were good. Finished the meal with pizookies, one cookies and cream, and the other chocolate chip. Both were over the top with sugar, a little goes a long way.  Service was good."
Noah H.,"Allen, TX",17,6,,2.0,8/23/2013,"I have been here many times because it is close to where I work.  When the food is right, this place is four stars.  But unfortunately, all too often it is closer to bar food - cold and tastless. The pizza is very original for this area.  Thick and gooey.  But the rest of the menu, even though it is long, is lacking any really tasty dishes.  Wish I could rank it higher. Oh, and their root beer is quite tasty also."
Glenn B.,"Plano, TX",0,6,,5.0,4/10/2013,"I've read the reviews and I have to say that I probably eat at our BJ's (75 in Plano) about 45-50 saturday nights a year. I have been eating there since shortly after it opened. We always eat at the bar, the bar staff is incredible, the mgrs are equally as friendly and accommodating. I have never, repeat never had a bad meal. Oh some are not as good as others but the menu is large enough they provide ample variety.    The place is clean. The bar, the restrooms and the one or two times I have sat in the main dining area I have found the waitstaff incredible. Overall its a great place to eat....OBTW......tip your wait staff and bartenders. Any one in that industry more times than not work a demanding and challenging job, they deserve your respect and your patronage in the form of an adequate tip, not just the bare minimum 10% you tight a**. They are there to serve you not to take your disregard of the function that they serve. No my kids or any relatives for that matter work there. GB"
Jasmine N.,"Atlanta, GA",0,15,7,2.0,8/3/2015,"I would not recommend coming here after 9:30-10pm although they are open until 12. Be prepared to get served cold food with sub par service, very disappointed I had to get my plate reheated along with having to send back the appetizer"
Kim W.,"Plano, TX",0,59,,4.0,8/13/2015,"BJ's Restaurant has an extensive menu.  I like that it has several gluten-free options.  They have lots of appetizers, which is great.  Fun to have several appetizers and make it a dinner.  All the food we have tried has seemed very good."
Kristen D.,"Plano, TX",189,561,79,4.0,4/23/2012,"Excellent food. Great variety of menu items. I highly recommend the egg rolls and pizza.  I am not a big beer drinker, so I have to mention that their martinis and fruity drinks are very nice.  It normally takes a while to get seated on Fridays and Saturdays, but I can normally get in for lunch in a timely manner."
Shanda T.,"Tyler, TX",35,20,,4.0,11/7/2013,Went here around 11am on a Sunday with my boyfriend. We had the calamari and lettuce wraps. Everything was fresh and delicious. Our waitress was on top of her game. Not too intrusive but attentive. On a previous visit I had the pizza which I loved. I'll be back with the man soon!
Skye C.,"Plano, TX",0,7,,5.0,7/28/2015,"Shrimp fettuccini and wedge salad..... MY FAVORITES. So good, worth the drive. Kids love the pizookie too."
Fernando F.,"Richardson, TX",0,32,,4.0,7/31/2015,"Great food, and beer. Friends loved the pizza, I really enjoyed their fish tacos."
Fred P.,"Allen, TX",0,31,2,4.0,6/5/2015,"It's my girl's favorite restaurant. I'd call it overpriced. I've had bad service a couple times, but the food is always great."
Jeff B.,"Edmond, OK",9,21,,1.0,10/5/2013,"Tried to order a couple of the seasonal beers from their Oktoberfest menu and they were out of both, the waitress was very clueless, she continued to come back to the table and ask what we ordered?!!?! I would not recommend this place to anyone."
Ryan W.,"Plano, TX",34,107,5,4.0,6/18/2012,"Took the family here for Father's Day. GOODS: Food was good for the most part, my dish was bland, but my wires salad was good and the kids have mac n cheese as well as chicken strips. No complaints their!  Staff was very polite, attentive and fun, cool actually. I had the Imperial Stout and it ruled! BADS: My dish was a big disappointment. $10.00+ for a small veggie pizza that was for one, but looked like it was for one child. No flavor, but the ingredient were very fresh."
Delaney S.,"Dallas, TX",115,32,2,2.0,5/7/2011,"The last time I was there, my salmon was way undercooked & while the waitress did bring another one out, the manager never even came over to ask if we were ok, much less comp anything or apologize. I won't be going back. There are too many places to eat in Plano/Dallas to give this place another shot."
Christa P.,"Dallas, TX",99,34,13,2.0,5/25/2013,"Good food. Calamari cooked perfectly. My steak was medium rare, just as I had ordered it, and seasoned well. I was impressed. However, our server was terrible. No smile, no personality, could not care any less that we were there. Kenan was his name, I believe. Will not be returning to this place because of the slow, poor service."
Ingrid W.,"Fort Stewart, GA",17,31,30,5.0,1/7/2014,"Every time we visit Dallas, we make sure to visit Bjs. Love their root beer. I don't drink much soda, but the root beer is a must have. Their pizza is delicious. We always order the cheeseburger pizza. It is actually not on their menu anymore, but the cooks are still able to make it. Recommend going for drinks, food, if theirs a game on, or all of the above!"
Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,63,2.0,10/16/2012,"Well.......... as much as I hate writing negative reviews and the fact that I have been to BJ's on several occasions in the past with groups from work and had a nice time, I just can't let our latest experience pass by without mention.   Last week, hubs and I were craving pizza, which we always either make ourselves or order in, but instead said ""where can we go to sit down and have get a good pizza?""  Then it hit me, I remembered having great pizza at BJ's in past years with our friends from work.   So, off we go, looking forward to a yummie pie and some great cocktails & beer.  We ordered a pizza with EXTRA sauce and several toppings, an apple martini made with vodka, apple pucker & Midori (the original appletini recipe) and a Blue Moon beer.  Our waiter was obviously new and took his time getting out our drinks, but that's OK, completely understandable.  But, then the pizza arrived with NO sauce......  we both took a few bites and then realized what was wrong, so we explained the problem to our waiter and another pizza was promptly ordered and the original removed.   Still enjoying our drinks, they were just about gone by the time the second pizza arrived.  So another round of drinks was ordered and we dove into the pizza - we were starving at this point.   One mouth full and all our excitement about pizza night out were gone.  This one had a little bit of sauce but was undercooked as well.  It was edible, but just not what we had anticipated or what we had ordered, so we went with and enjoyed our second drink.  About 3/4 finished with the second pizza, our waiter arrives to ask if everything was good.  We explained to him the disappointment with the pizza again and he said he was sorry, etc, etc - the same BS you get from every waiter - they really don't give a RA if you enjoyed your food - they are only trained to ask this.   So, anyway we were now ready for the check and that's where things got hairy..........  We get the bill and just happened to notice we were charged for two appletinis and two ""shots"" of Midori for a total of $30 for two drinks! (No way was there an ""shot"" of Midori in my appletini.   So, my first complaint would be that there are no prices on the menu for alcohol and we were not told that requesting Midori to replace the cheap and carb-loaded ""sweet & sour"" they add for their non-traditional appletinis would add an additional $7.50 per drink.  That, on top of the really bad pizza, called for a meeting with the manager.   The manager arrived promptly to explain the cost of the Midori.  He and I had a rather heated discussion that there was not the volume of a ""shot"" in each drink to justify the charge and I asked they be removed.   He hesitated, so I explained it to him like this...... either he remove the Midori charges or he could remove the entire pizza since it was awful and had to be ordered twice.   He then agreed to remove the Midori's (of course - as they were the cheaper road to travel).  Had this happen, you would not be reading this review......... instead he removed ONE Midori and presented us with a $10 gift certificate for a return visit.   Well, that just doesn't work for me.   Don't lie to me and then try to cover the lie with the addition of a gift card.   We have no desire to return to BJ's and will pass the card on to a friend.......... or trash it - one of the two."
Katy B.,"Plano, TX",22,58,11,2.0,12/5/2012,"We went there for the gluten free pizza. My husband said it was as bad as the frozen versions. Apparently Domino's is better. Yikes. As for the non-gluten free pizza, I would say the same. Domino's is better, and I don't particularly like Domino's. It was soggy! The crust was soggy and not delicious, the cheese was lacking and I'm pretty sure it had no sauce. Yuck. Won't be returning, based on the food."
Kristy V.,"Centerville, TN",26,24,,2.0,2/21/2015,"Took 40 minutes to be seated. The beer choices were extensive. Tasted the orange cream soda and thought it was good  Our waiter barely waited on us,  didn't refill any drinks.  Appetizers were great. Dinner was sub par."
