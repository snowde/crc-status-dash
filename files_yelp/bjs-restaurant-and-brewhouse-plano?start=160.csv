Tim T.,"Wylie, TX",5,65,10,1.0,11/23/2012,Our experience here with the food confirms my belief to stay away from the big factory food chains.  The food was horrible for the price.  Wife had Chicken Cesear Salad.  Greens were not fresh and the chicken was dried out and cold.  My Son's burger was good but he stated it had a burnt taste to it.   His fries was warm to almost cold.   Chicken club I had also had the same problem as the burger - kind of a burnt taste to it.   Wedge fries were the only good item - hot and fresh.  Our tab with one glass of wine and two ice tea's with tip was $50.  I feel cheated and will never return.   I am amazed how crowded the place was considering the low quality of the food.
Valerie R.,"Sachse, TX",0,3,,2.0,3/1/2015,"Went there last night and really wasn't impressed. The service was slow. We had beer and nachos. The serving size was small considering what they were charging.there were too many options on the menu, it was just overwhelming. Won't be back. Don't go!"
Joey L.,"Plano, TX",0,26,,5.0,2/28/2014,The food is good and the of course the alcohol is good! The prices are pretty fair! Every time I go I get pretty good service and I don't think I've ever encountered a problem here! Really good place to go!
Jordan H.,"Wylie, TX",11,105,20,3.0,7/3/2011,"I found myself at this restaurant for the first time (both in location and the chain itself) last weekend while having lunch with friends. I was assured that the food was good and the brewed drinks were even better.  First of all, the environment and ambience of BJ's was pretty nice, featuring a more upscale and adult vibe than your average, Chili's-esque dine-in restaurant. This was so much the case that BJ's definitely seemed out of place while sharing a parking lot with a grimy Jack-in-the-Box and strip mall.  For drinks I sampled both the root beer and an Irish root beer (alcoholic), two of the many drinks they brew in house. While the Irish root beer was a delicious and clever combination of ingredients, the regular version was nothing to write home about. It was good, but nothing in it's taste or composure really set it apart from other root beers - except the price.  The food was good and there were a lot of options to choose from, some of which were things you wouldn't find on any other menu in town. Their deep dish pizza's are deliciously fresh and have a professional homemade quality to them. I had a GIANT baked potato stuff with chicken (which was overwhelmingly of the canned/processed/cubed variety), broccoli, and cheese while my husband enjoyed the parmisiano pasta. All dishes were really delicious (but not extraordinary or super amazing).  The major con with BJ's was the price. One soda and two of the cheapest entree's on the menu still cost us $30, which is pretty uncomfortable for those on the budget. But if that price range is comfortable for you, then by all means don't listen to me complain about it. Other than that, the service was mostly adequate, considering the restaurant was at about a medium-heavy occupancy.  Depending on the weight of my wallet I would definitely consider eating here again in the future."
Ron G.,"Allen, TX",120,254,7,2.0,8/15/2008,"Well, I'm going to have to drop my rating a couple of stars. In the past few weeks I have twice taken my team to lunch here. Both times the meal service was completely disinterested, slow, and somewhat random. Everyone's food arrived over a long period of time. The servers never said anything about why or when the food would be out. Drink refills were never offered nor was anyone ever asked if their meal was OK. On the most recent visit things were so bad I complained to the guy passing himself off as a manager. At first he denied anything had gone wrong. But then offered a big discount off the meal plus a gift card along with an admission of failed service. If it hadn't happened twice I would have let it go. But twice in a row means something is wrong and the rating needs to be revised."
Vanessa U.,"San Diego, CA",88,13,10,4.0,10/20/2013,The service was great. Started off with a cup of tortilla soup. That was delicious. Ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps . It was bigger than I thought it would be. The table next to us ordered a fruit cobbler with vanilla ice cream that looked amazing . Decided to take it home since I was too full to eat it at the restaurant. It was delicious.
Ryan B.,"Richardson, TX",222,395,202,3.0,3/5/2013,"Two observations after a recent visit: 1) Our server, while effective, was amped up so much that it could only be explained with chemical substances; and 2) don't take your kids to BJ's on a Saturday night for their birthday. It's a brewpub for crying out loud. I don't go to Chuck-E-Cheese for happy hour and tell/yell dirty jokes, so don't drag your brood out to have sing-alongs at a group table and run around like it's a freakin' playground."
Jon P.,"Plano, TX",38,9,,1.0,11/23/2012,"Used to be a great place to eat, now the food come out cold and looking tired.  The night manager is a jerk as well, we complained about the food and he took an attitude with us.  After going here at least 10 times this year, tonight will be our last visit."
Rick O.,"Dallas, TX",22,119,1,4.0,5/17/2011,"For a chain joint, it's a bit pricey, but the food is really good. And if you sit at the bar, the TV setup is very nice for sports hounds. Since the demise of the Stone Elephant a few months back, I've had to range far and wide to find a decent stand-in. I found myself up here in Plano a couple of times in the past couple of weeks, and I left a happy man. The beer selection is quite good - on top of their home-brew stuff - so I was able to enjoy the Saint Arnold IPA on draft. Not cheap, but very good if you like IPA. Their pizza is all kinds of awesome. We got the Mediterranean, topped with grilled chicken, roasted garlic, Kalamatta olives, and feta cheese. Picture the good parts of a Greek salad strewn atop a fluffy, buttery crust. I'm drooling just thinking back to it now. Mmmmmm... On my return trip, I had the California Chicken sandwich. The avocado, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, AND ranch dressing melt into gooey mess, but the sourdough bread keeps things mostly contained. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked - tender and moist. I'm going to out on a limb and say it challenges Kenny's for Best Chicken Sandwich Ever. Write it down. I'm knocking off a star just because they seem to be a little proud of what is essentially jazzed up bar fare. Very good bar fare, mind you, but essentially pizza, burgers and sandwiches. The atmosphere is nice, and the service is great. It has kind of a ""Houston's Lite"" feel to it. So maybe that's their justification. I'm still on the hunt for a stand-by sports bar, but I'll definitely be back to BJ's."
Kyle T.,"Flower Mound, TX",91,4,,4.0,10/11/2013,"not bad. took my girlfriend to go hang out. They had good specials on drinks and prices were not bad. Service was just a little slow, but the food itself came quickly so nothing to complain about."
Jessica C.,"McKinney, TX",49,192,53,4.0,8/23/2010,"We regularly visit this location (it's much better than the one in Addison) and although it's a chain, it's definitely one of the better ones out there. Ambiance: We typically sit in the bar area, but the entire restaurant is very open and airy.  It's a great place to unwind after a long day at work or to relax with friends.  Despite being quite crowded at times the noise level is quite manageable.  Expect a wait during peak times. Service:  The service in the bar area is great.  The servers are friendly, attentive, and have a great attention to detail for a place like this.  The few times we've had issues with our food they're always quick to notice and correct the problem. Food: The menu is ridiculously large and offers more than enough options.  We typically stick with the deep dish pizzas which are great.  The crust is nice and buttery and the toppings are plentiful.  I highly recommend the BBQ Chicken and the BJ's Favorite.  Every appetizer we have tried has been good as well.  The food always arrives hot and tastes fresh.  The highlight of the meal though is always the pizookie for dessert.  A warm gooey cookie with ice cream - doesn't get much better than that!  That being said, the ""original"" chocolate chip version is my least favorite - the triple chocolate with vanilla ice cream or the peanut butter with some hot fudge are the way to go!  Skip the apple crisp; it's not that great.  Prices: I think the prices are fair based on the portion sizes and quality of food.  This is definitely a step up from a Friday's or Chili's and it shows.  They also offer some good happy hour specials in the bar area M-F."
Brad H.,"Birmingham, AL",56,313,90,2.0,7/25/2012,"Microbrews were very average and the food was run of the mill (think TGI Friday's or Applebees). Glad I was on the company dime for this one, won't be back."
Brittany G.,"Irving, TX",57,119,18,2.0,3/26/2014,"Awful. One of my grandparents' favorite restaurants is BJs and we come here often. Thankfully this wasn't our first trip or we wouldn't be back. Although, we will probably not give our business to this location anymore related to the lackadaisical manager. So we arrived at 5pm on a Saturday, beers came out quickly and we ordered at 5:10. By 5:50 I'm looking around for our server to ask why it is taking our food so long. Finally at 5:55 it arrives. I had subbed my fries for broccoli and you should have seen the amount I got. 3 pieces as a side? Not to mention it was cold! Both my grandmother and grandfather's food was cold as well. So we get our server and explain the situation (and also that the 3 twenty something's at the table were servers) and I ask to speak to a manager. This guy didn't tell me his name, but he was a heavy set middle aged white guy with glasses. He could not have given two shits less about everything and instead went off on a tangent with my grandpa about wedge fries vs thin cut fries. My grandmother not wanting to create a problem said her food was ""edible"" and in the restaurant world that screams FIX IT! When he left the table I was fuming more than before! I told our server (who was very helpful and caught in the middle of a situation out of his control) that his manager was useless and could not have cared less. Our new sides arrived (still ridiculously small), my grandma ate her cold pasta and we left. The manager took my sandwich off the bill, but honestly if he had just acted like he cared more I wouldn't have even wanted that. At that point he needed to do more than take off a $9 sandwich though because not only did he not fix the situation, he multiplied my anger. At the end of the day the beer and service by our waiter was good, but the food and attitude of the manager ruined everything. We won't be back any time soon!"
Cindy L.,"Richardson, TX",0,9,2,1.0,7/16/2013,"Worst service ever -- went there tonight, sat at a booth in the bar, ordered a couple of drinks, waited 15 minutes in an empty restaurant, drinks finally came and mine was wrong (sigh).  Ordered food, got food (so-so), waited and waited to get another drink ordered. Asked for manager (condescending and indifferent) who got us some drinks about 10 minutes later (sigh). Not busy at all, employees standing around, but for some reason, our waiter seemed slammed. After a hard day at work, not the place to come to unwind and spend your hard earned $$. Go somewhere else... we'll see you there."
Kacie M.,"Dallas, TX",261,452,15,4.0,1/15/2010,"BJ's may not stick out of the crowd of chain restaurant/bars. HOWEVER.... their pizza.... oh their pizza. It's delicious. Tangy sauce, deep dish, SO GOOD.  And, if you're really going all out, their pizookies (pizza cookies - baked cookies topped with ice cream) rock."
B R.,"Plano, TX",0,14,,2.0,10/2/2014,"My husband and I went last night for dinner.  Waited almost 10 minutes at our table before we were greeted.  The waitress was very nice but she was very,very slow.  Not sure if she was busy, but it was way too slow.  Our drinks were constantly empty, she was never in sight, our appetizer took almost 15 minutes which is slower than usual, food took over 30 minutes then came out wrong. Our pizza had TONS of tomatoes on it, asked for no tomatoes.  They remade it, but must have rushed the order because the pizza was very soggy and no even edible.  No one came buy after the food was redelivered to ask how anything was.  Our other guest ate alone while we waited for the pizza then only ate a couple bites  It was very doughy and not golden on the edges as usual and completely sunken in on the middle area.  Very disappointing.  THEN we were charged for the pizza, had to ask to have it removed, then the waitress lost our debit card and it was not returned to us in the folder with our check.  After another 10-15 minutes of waiting around, another server found it somewhere....1 hour and 45 minutes later we left.  It was very disappointing.  Check # 315a Table 804 Karen R Location #439."
Michael B.,"Austin, TX",367,395,81,4.0,12/18/2009,"You know, I never have a bad time at the BJ's bar. The bartenders are friendly and on there best game. And I mean every single time I have EVER been here and sat at the bar. They always introduce themselves and want to know my name too! They are always positive, conversational and just seem happy to be working there. This time was no different.  Tonight we wanted a pizza and a bottle of wine and to just chill out before we did a little Christmas shopping. Service was great. And the Mediterranean pizza was delicious. Loved the greek peppers on it. I've been a little luke-warm on the BJ's in Austin after our last dining room experience recently, but maybe after this positive Plano experience I will give them another try! At the bar!"
Javier O.,"Plano, TX",12,23,1,4.0,12/18/2010,"I absolutely love this place. It's a great place to go with a group after work to get some good, cold beer and amazing appetizers. They have three different kinds of ""sliders"" (pulled pork, beef, and chicken), all of which are great. Their avocado egg rolls are creative and delicious. You really can't go wrong with the appetizers, I don't think.  Unfortunately, I haven't been as impressed with any of the entrees. A lot of people love the pizza, but I'm not a huge deep-dish fan. Still, the beer and the appetizers make this place one of my favorites for meeting with a group and getting drinks."
Derek S.,"Richardson, TX",5,49,,4.0,2/16/2013,"I love the atmosphere and the plethora of flat screens.  For a chain, the food is quite good with numerous items to choose from.  I have been to this restaurant several times now, and have always had a good meal.  I really like their house-made root beer and black cherry cola, but I didn't find anything special about their house beer selection."
Dee E.,"Little Elm, TX",0,5,,3.0,9/24/2014,I LOVE the food.  The service at this location is lacking!! I have never had a great experience there.  I typically go on my lunch hour and am always late getting back to work.  We usually don't get the things that we ask for either.
