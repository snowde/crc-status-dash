Billy M.,"Dallas, TX",10,47,30,4.0,8/25/2010,"I was deeply suspicious of this place the first time I came in.  It has the look and feel of every middle-tier brewpub/restaurant out there... Bennigan's, Chili's, etc.  Glad it didn't stop me!  This place rocks. The burgers are fantastic and huge.  The cottage fries are plentiful, hot and just right.  Plus, BJ's has myriad great salads... I'm a big fan of the Cobb.  Good pizzas, too. The place is massive, but I've never had trouble with the waitstaff.  Requisite TV's everywhere, so can get very crowded on game night. As others have pointed out, the beer prices are on the high side, but overall this place is worth the stop."
Glaser J.,"San Diego, CA",60,123,13,3.0,7/20/2010,"Went here recently with a group of guys from work.  What better way to celebrate a significant work milestone than by drinking at 1PM... Beers here are not too bad.  Not as good as my favorite microbrews, but good nonetheless. My favorites are either the Piranha Pale Ale (crisp and hoppy) or the Jeremiah Red (malt smooth), depending on what I'm in the mood for. Can you call yourself a brewhouse if you don't actually brew beer here?  Oh wait, root beer is brewed here.  Nevermind, carry on..... but seriously, I was told BJ's has their beers brewed at an Anheuser-Busch facility, but the BJ's brewmasters oversee the operations.  Hey, it tastes better than the Anheuser-Busch beers, that's for sure. As far as the food, I like the calamari.  Burgers here are ok.  But their ice cream topped cookies are what I look forward to."

Todd E.,"Frisco, TX",152,233,78,2.0,5/22/2009,"Not very impressed...I haven't laid the smack down on here yet...I'm a pretty nice guy but I don't think I'll be going to back to BJ's.  Went with a group of coworkers for lunch and I think it pretty much sucked.  The service was horrible.  Granted we had a pretty big party but still you'd think they could get the orders right.   The food was alright, nothing that I would have to have again.  I looked over their beer list and wasn't really impressed either.  I guess the bottom line is there was nothing about this place that would make me say I want to go back..."
Scott C.,"Dallas, TX",21,84,,4.0,9/10/2009,"Since I'm a life long fan of Humperdinks and after my scathing review of them I feel so dirty going over to the competitor.  However, if Humperdinks isn't going to get their food right, I need somewhere to go when I need to eat. BJs is a national chain so I feel double dirty for not staying local.  I've had the pizza, the spring rolls and now one of the smothered burgers and, of course, the beer. The beer is the thing. I've had the red and pale ale and the porter. All good.  The pizza is deep dish and a little too deep. If you like a loaf of bread with toppings then you'll love it. OK, its not that bad, but it does rise a lot and is a very thick but airy crust. Its a little different than what I like but I can't really fault it. Next time I want to try the appetizer thin crust pizza. The other food I've had is also good but not outstanding just good and consistent. I don't want BJs to become my default place when I want food and craft brew but for now it may have to be."
Jon L.,"Richardson, TX",0,9,1,1.0,12/2/2013,Their so called deep dish pizza is a joke. It cost $25 bucks for their large deep dish. I've tasted better frozen pizzas found at the grocery store. Their pizzas are over priced for what you get.
Michael L.,"Plano, TX",34,37,1,3.0,5/6/2012,"Reliable.  The BBQ chicken salad and ahi tuna salad are my 2 favorites. Oh yeah, they have"
Natalie S.,"Plano, TX",9,71,,3.0,4/3/2010,"BJ's is pretty standard ""American"" food; greasy goodness in large portions. We've ordered the deep dish Mediterranean pizza a few times and, though the first few slices are pretty good, the grease on the bottom of the crust gets to be too much after a while; I'm not sure whether it's olive oil or butter that the crust is saturated with, but man is it greasy.  As far as sandwiches and burgers go, their roast beef dip and California chicken sandwich are pretty good. The burger melt is gooey, greasy and cheesy, which is exactly what you want when you order something called a ""melt."" All sandwiches and burgers come with your choice of fries. I like their thin cut fries, but if you like a thicker fry, they also have wedges. We've eaten in the restaurant, carried-out, and had them deliver. When we've eaten there, the service has been pretty good, even when they were swamped; I don't think we've ever had an issue. Both times we did carry-out, something was missing or incorrect in our order. Bummer. As for their delivery service, they charge a fee, which is lame. I can't remember the exact amount, but I want to say it's in the $2-$3 range. Because of that, I have only had them deliver once; I don't live all that far from the restaurant, and, though delivery is always more convenient, it's just not worth it to me. All in all, BJ's is about what you'd expect it to be. The prices are pretty reasonable, and the food is ok. Solid 3.25."
David D.,"Plano, TX",14,18,,3.0,4/30/2010,"Went here with a few friends of mine. This is my second time being here at this location. The second time was the better than the first. The first time I went they ran out of ice cream for the pizookie. I know! how can you run out of ice cream?! They had ice cream this time so it was all good ;) A few things: Service here is a bit slow. We've waited for our food for quite some time. I must say, their bar is pretty darn nice. They have a good collection of alcohol beverages on display. Food is not bad. It's actually pretty good. I only got dessert the first time I went so I wasnt sure how the food was. Their deep dish pizza is the BOMB. I was quite surprised. Be warned, If you're a health freak, the pizza is greasyyyyyyy.   So my favorite pizookie is the white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream on top. This thing melts in your mouth with every bite. One of my favorite desserts around the area.  Other than that, BJ's is not over the top. It's a fancier Chili's basically. It's good though, so do check it out :)"
Rick G.,"Austin, TX",1,22,1,3.0,1/20/2009,"My son and I visited one Monday evening when we were bach-ing it.    The server, Christina, brought drinks quickly and was attentive throughout. My son order a turkey cobb sandwich with skinny fires.   The fries were very flavorful but also very greasy.  He really enjoyed the sandwich. I had the minestrone soup to start.  I ordered the strip steak with a baked potato - pretty standard fare and not to difficult.   The soup was tasty but thin for minestrone.   The steak was alright - nothing spectacular.   Since it was his birthday, the server provided their signature desert -  a pazookie.  Yeah, if you are looking for sweet overload, this is for you.  It's like a freshly baked cookie smothered in ice cream.   So if I was Randy on AI, I would have to say it was a-yit."
Megan M.,"Dallas, TX",583,320,381,3.0,11/5/2008,"BJ's isn't bad.  But despite the name, it doesn't rock my world.  However, my lunch buddy loves their veggie pizza so I indulge her once and a while. Most of their dishes are overpriced for lunch, but they do have a few items that are reasonable.  I got the sandwich/salad combo - 1/2 turkey Cobb sandwich, wedge cut fries and a house salad w/garlic ranch, which was pretty tasty.  Add an iced tea and it was $10 after tax.  Not bad at all. The service can be a little slow at times, but it's a huge place and it fills up quickly so I try to give them a break on that.  If you do plan on going for lunch - and only have an hour for lunch - don't even try to show up after 11:45 or so.  The wait for a table and possible slow service almost insures you won't make it back to work in under an hour. I've never been able to try BJ's for dinner, which also means that I've never been able to try their many flavors of beer.  Maybe that's what I've been missing."
Lisa C.,"Dana Point, CA",24,19,1,1.0,8/21/2012,Not a fan.  Meet a girlfriend there for lunch.  Had the avacado eggrolls.  They were terrible!  Service sucked.  Servers were sitting behind us chilling in a booth instead of checking to see if we needed anything.  Best thing about it was the TVs with football on!  Wouldn't eat there again.  Not worth the money.
Christopher L.,"Garland, TX",94,134,,2.0,8/1/2009,"I'm sure I'll have to update this later when I go back for real food. But my first experience here was, quite frankly, a bit laughable. We had stopped in for Pizookies, initially having had a craving for the, now closed, Cheddars' cookie monster. At 11 at night, what else should we be going to BJ's for, right?... Anywho, we were gonna split a dessert apiece, after each ordering drinks. Our waitress was nice at least, if not a little hurried. She then informed us that kitchen had run out of vanilla ice cream. This is a shame, when all of the menu desserts have it in their descriptors, but I digress. We opted for chocolate ice cream instead. The craving for Pizookies was great. The Triple Chocolate Chunk PZ was good. The Oreo one I got on the other hand was a little disappointing. It should probably have just been called a Too Much Chocolate In Your Face. I am still convinced that vanilla might have saved it. The greatest foul up though was in waiting for our group's last Pizookie to come out. After four of us were finished eating the two that had already arrived, a manager brought out the fourth, sans the ice cream -- chocolate, vanilla, or any other. And after setting it before my two guys, he made as if to walk away hastily. Only at the objection of my friend did he double back to our table and inform us that the kitchen had also run out of chocolate ice cream. It took asking the waitress to see if the dessert would still be charged to us, seeing as how it was essentially only a large, sugary White Chocolate Macadamia Cookie. Good day to you, BJ's. I SAID GOOD DAY."
Aaron M.,"Plano, TX",10,85,20,4.0,5/17/2010,"I can't believe I like this place.  But I do! It was so clean and nice....floor, design, everything. Prices great except beer-4.95 per pint....youch! The CFS with veggies was great--and well presented.  It was like we are not in Texas.  The Pot Roast sammie was very good--not too gigantic and actaully very very good.  Garlic Parm pot chips were nice...Gourmet Mac and Cheese not cheesey but bacony instead--nice twist.   The pizzas looked awesome.  The staff was excellent..  A $.95 kids ice cream sundae..who has a scoop of ic for under a buck anymore?"
Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,4.0,2/29/2012,"Loved the large menu as there was food for just about anyone's taste. The service was excellent and the food likewise. Two ordered gluten free pizza (personal size) and they advised they were delicious. The calzone and chicken fried streaks were very good. Hamburgers were large and juicy. One down side. the menu stated they had chicken wings, so an order was placed. What they served was not ""chicken wings"" but chicken nuggets. I rechecked the menu and it still stated chicken wings. Thought I was being served at a fast food joint. While the Chicken nuggets were delicious they are not ""wings"" need to change your menu. Prices are a little steep. Almost $15 for a single pork chop and that is a little high in  my book."
Ronald J.,"Plano, TX",197,10,,2.0,4/8/2011,"The food at this location is great!  The service is terrible!  A lot of employees seem to mostly be doing nothing most of the time.  Waiters, waitress and bartenders everywhere but if it is not the busy times they don't seem to care about anything but gossiping.   Yeah, call it hating if you want but its true! Good luck getting good service here!"
Dustin S.,"Apopka, FL",37,40,13,3.0,9/21/2011,Yummy food for a chain. They have a large selection of food and great pizza. The craft beers keep me comming back. I used to watch teh football games here casue it does get a crowded as the sports bars.
Ryan C.,"Richardson, TX",0,10,,5.0,1/31/2012,I love this place. Their brews are great. I especially love the porter. Very tasty pizzas. My favorite is the classic combo. If you have never been there before you may have to spend a lot of time reading the menu before ordering because they have a huge menu and wide variety. A little pricey perhaps but you get what you pay for. I got there during half price mini pizzas. The place is very clean and well kept. Low lighting and upscale atmosphere for a casual restaurant.
P L.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,28,,1.0,10/11/2012,"Work colleagues and I go to this BJ's about once a month or more, and have done so for the last two + years. Sadly, we have seen a steady decline in service and quality. This was made abundantly clear when 5 of us decided to have lunch there on Oct 10th to celebrate a birthday. Beverage glasses were left empty, refills were few and far between. the appetizer we ordered was over done and not very good. entree's were delivered one or two at a time over a period of 20+ minutes. a nice easy work lunch took nearly two hours, the food was cold, the service really lacking. The restaurant remained busy and generally seemed mismanaged. we wont be going back and have removed BJ's from our lunch options. Sad things have come to this, but our last experience was so horrible, we see no alternative especially along the 75 corridor where restaurants are abundant."
Jack M.,"Celina, TX",1,86,1,3.0,9/24/2011,A little expensive for a lunch time meal. Service was so-so because the place was packed. The food was good.
