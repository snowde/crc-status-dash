Jennifer D.,"San Jose, CA",7,36,,4.0,6/22/2008,"Went here for a birthday dinner and everything turned out pretty well. The prices were great for what they served. What I also love about this place is that they have many, many choices of food to choose from. I personally love pasta, and it was great that they had several different dishes for that. The service was also great. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful. I totally didn't think that this place gets so many people. I called to be on the waiting list 35 minutes before we got there and once we did get there we had to wait another 20 minutes. Overall, I guess it was worth the wait. The lighting and the decor set a really good mood for you to relax and enjoy your dinner. So I would definitely come here again."
Zachary K.,"Cuajimalpa, Mexico",470,529,52,3.0,8/15/2008,"Not bad. My steak was pretty good. Salad was good. The blonde beer I had was grrrrreat. Clean place, decent service all in all a winner but no smoking which sucks but thats Plano for yah."
Rebecca H.,"Chicago, IL",25,234,6,2.0,2/17/2009,"Not bad, but nothing noteworthy. The service was typical overly happy 20 something college kids that don't bother to stop at the table until you have food in your mouth and then disappear as soon as you need something. they do have root beer barrels instead a mints, and that is pretty neat. Really noisy on weekends and the beer isn't half bad."
Niccole S.,"Frisco, TX",107,1,,5.0,11/10/2008,Bj's - Plano location- is one of my fave's !  I try to make it once a week.   Always consistent with great food- great service and an overall fun place to relax or have a night out with friends.  I have been to the Addison and Lewisville locations but have found Plano to be the most consistent -all the way around!  Enjoy
