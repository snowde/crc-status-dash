Kenneth E.,"Plano, TX",4,88,172,2.0,10/29/2015,"I was hesitant about going there but the wait staff were very clean bathrooms ,kid friendly I have to say the food was good, pizza was good ,strong drinks I would go again. If you are a bear guy they have a very very big selection of beer.but I was a big fan of the pizza it was a little pricey $14.00 for a small pepperoni pan pizza !! good thing I didn't get the large"
N G.,"Plano, TX",0,44,5,5.0,4/6/2016,"This place is a family favorite with great drink options, great food, and excellent service.  The things that set this place apart from other BJ's across the country is the consistency and the willingness to accommodate our preferences.  Surprisingly we have not seen that at all of the BJ's that we have been to, but this location definitely does their part. The only negative thing I have about BJ's in general is that they keep removing menu items that we order, such as the Shareable Pizzas, the Brownie, and the Spicy Marinara (Pink Sauce) Spaghetti. Still though, it tends to be a place we return to often."
Chad C.,"Lexington, KY",424,823,1602,4.0,8/15/2014,"I went here for a nice cold beer and some pizza, but ended up with beer and burger.  The burgers looked so good, I had to try one with a wedge salad to boot.  And glad I did.  The blue cheese dressing on the salad had a bit of sweetness to it.  I loved it. My partner ordered the pizza and it was tasty.   We were there on a crowded fathers day, but still received fast seating and great service.  Lucky there were only 2 of us because some of the large families where waiting for quite a while.  We finished off our meal with the 3 cookie combo with ice cream.  It was yummy.  I can't wait to stop in again."
Terry S.,"Dallas, TX",890,55,343,3.0,1/24/2016,"BJ's used to always be a favorite of mine.  Recently though not so much.  Their food is OK as always, and the beers are always good.  What I wish they would change is there happy hour.  When you advertise a different price than what the drinks truly are, then it just gives you an upset stomach.  Advertise your happy hour prices better (and give better prices), and I guarantee you will attract more people to your establishment.  :)  Happy drinking and eating folks."
Marianne C.,"Plano, TX",375,535,1271,3.0,2/23/2015,"Living 10+ years here and I've never been to any locations of this place. I wasn't expecting it to be really nice and cozy inside. However, the table setting (high tables) are sat very close together. It would be really awkward eating with your elbow reaching your neighbors table.  We ordered their burger and chicken fried steak. Burger is good, huge and juicy with a side of wedge potatoes. It was very flavorful.  My CFS however, is dry. It would've been really good if they sent out more gravy. Over all it's a place where you can get food late at night . Another option added to my late night binge eating. :-)"
Mitchell M.,"Garland, TX",0,1,,5.0,5/30/2017,Amazing location! I was blown away by the service ! RJ ( our bartender) is one of the coolest most down to earth bartenders I've had the pleasure of talking too. If you've dined there before on a weekend night I can already assume you've had Christina come by your table to make sure everything is going well. She is incredibly nice and I can't wait to come again to see her !
Stephanie H.,"The Colony, TX",36,461,57,5.0,1/23/2015,I got a to go order of the great white deep dish pizza and a chocolate chip pizookie. The to go order was made fast and the food was really good. I like this location because it's close to my school and they have good food. I have been eating here for 5 years and I would recommend you eat here. They also have their own brand of beer and cider. I got the berry burst cider and it's really good.this place has a lot of menu options.
Phronsie D.,"Plano, TX",22,74,28,4.0,4/21/2016,"Very consistently good.2nd  time in as many weeks.  It was really busy. They had a lot of waitstaff, but we almost got overlooked. Almost. A waiter took our table even though we weren't his table. He was nice, and fun and we never wanted for a thing. Great food, especially for a chain."
Wendy R.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/19/2016,"We went here tonight and sat at a table with many wait staff members walking by and no one even looked our direction for over 10 minutes. No drink, no avocado egg rolls, nothing. The people sitting next to us said they waited a long time too. When we got up to leave, no one even seemed to care, even the manager. Won't be going back to BJ's again. Too many other restaurants around here to put up with those shenanigans."
Amanda A.,"Richardson, TX",7,50,14,3.0,11/2/2016,The food is nothing but average the sizes are humongous but nothing to write home about if you're looking for a bar type atmosphere and late night food I guess it's a place to go if you're not wanting IHOP
Carmen M.,"Rockwall, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/17/2016,"Service was absolutely horrible. After 5 different people coming to bring food to our table, none of them never noticed we didn't have our drinks. We didn't get our drinks until it was time for the check (and we asked for them several times). Our actual waiter only came by twice, once to ask for our order and second to ask if we were ready for the check. He was only waiting on two other tables. Horrible experience!"
Sarah W.,"Dallas, TX",1,11,,1.0,8/5/2016,I am never going back to this place!! It was horrible and I waiter was worse:(  It was a 45 minute wait just to get a table and when the waiter came to bring the food it was all wrong and he spilt ranch all over my meal! He never gave me a discount nor cleaned up the mess:( he treated us terrible with no respect AT ALL!! I am very disappointed in the restaurant and they have awful service! The waiter was also so rude to my children!!! NOT HAPPY
Lisa P.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,2,,5.0,7/12/2017,"This started as a 1 star review. We were very disappointed. Our waitress was inattentive, did not give us plates for our appetizers or silverware. Our food was not cooked properly and overall was a disaster. We we about ready to chalk it up as a bad dining experience. However, the look of distraught in my face caught the eye of another server. Colin. He had the decency to stop at our table even though he was carrying an arm full of drinks to another table, to ask if we were ok. After we told him we were not having the best experience he sent the manager over. The manager Brandon, was more than apologetic and not only gave us new property cooked entrees but his demeanor was incredibly sympathetic. After that he sent an amazing young man to take care of our needs. Benjamin. Ben was attentive and took care of us in every way. He made sure he checked on our needs frequently. The 3 of these young men made my birthday night out with my husband turn from disappointing to amazing. I thank them for listening to our concerns and not only addressing them but making them a priority. What a wonderful team to turn things around for the guests. Thank you Colin, Brandon and Ben for making things amazing for us. If you need amazing service turn to these guys for your needs and you will not be disappointed!!!"
C G.,"Frierson, LA",0,48,,5.0,3/25/2017,"Just celebrated Grandpa's 86th birthday at BJ's! Great meal, great beer, but equally as important we had the BEST WAITER. When you go ask for Jory! He is sharp, quick with the refills, and very in tune with what we needed throughout the meal. Jory was attentive without being bothersome. He gave Grandpa an extra scoop of ice cream on the pazookie and time to open up the gifts before he brought us the bill. What a personable young man! When we go back we will ask to have Jory for our waiter. You should too!"
Valencia J.,"Dallas, TX",171,224,1243,3.0,10/6/2015,"We had lunch here for a work outing. I was less than impressed with the service and food. I ordered some type of mini deep dish pizza. First bite, I thought it tasted like a frozen meal. My coworker's salad looked a lot more appetizing. I probably won't return unless it's a group outing again. Just too many other options in the area that are better."
Jennifer S.,"Plano, TX",23,31,,3.0,9/5/2016,My friend and I frequent BJ's often for the beer. The service is normally good and the beer is cold. Unfortunately the food is just ok. My friend loves the baked ziti dish but I just haven't found anything on the menu that is memorable..... and it is a HUGE menu. The pizookie is good but I need a good meal before dessert.
Christopher L.,"Princeton, TX",2300,644,44,4.0,6/29/2015,"Good lunch with a coupon is always a plus.  Food was excellent and served quickly.  Service was polite and steady.  Two little things keeping it from a five... even though there was a pretty wide open floor, they seated a party of ~10 (including a bunch of children) right next to me.  The other issue was that apparently there was a ""problem"" with the women's restroom, and the discussion about it was loud enough to hear in the customer area."
Jennifer K.,"Dallas, TX",109,33,2,2.0,8/20/2016,"This use to be a place my family and I would enjoy, however that time is cut short. It was a packed night so good sign, but when you come to a restaurant for a purpose to eat and the food is mediocre at best, it's time to find a new eating/meeting spot. I'm surprised how popular it is still. Service was good on high note. Food: calamari good, pizza was dry, pasta was bland and watery, Parmesan chicken flavorless. Beer: good. If I could give it 2/12 stars that's my rate for this once great place.."
Jason M.,"Plano, TX",937,152,174,5.0,11/28/2014,"The food & service here is great! Join the Rewards program & you will be awarded points for every dining experience. If you're into alcohol, their selection is top notch. The lighting, mood, & ambience fits for any occasion."
April B.,"McKinney, TX",120,728,447,5.0,7/17/2016,The food and service was amazing.  Our server was on top of things.  Never had to wait for anything.  I wish I caught her name so I could acknowledge her.
