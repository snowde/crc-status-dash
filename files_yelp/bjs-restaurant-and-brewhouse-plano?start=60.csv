Andy H.,"Overland Park, KS",95,19,,4.0,8/1/2016,"Nice place with great food and drink options for our family with a variety of palettes.  If anything the menu was a little overwhelming with too many options.  They had all the standard faire for the kids menu which all the kids gobbled up which is generally a good thing as my kids to tend to have strong negative opinions when their food doesn't live up to their needs so this place passes the kid test with flying colors.  Food overall was pretty good although I felt shell of my chicken tacos were a little stale, but overall I felt like the service and the food met the mark and made for a nice late lunch in a well air conditioned restaurant on a hot Texas day with an excellent dark stout beer as we hung out and caught up with old friends."
Alex E.,"Allen, TX",14,162,1,4.0,7/8/2015,"Had some cajun pasta & a caesar salad for lunch, it was pretty good. Pasta seemed a bit overcooked/slimy, as if it was microwaved. However the chicken was cooked perfect and moist, sauce had a nice spicy kick to it, and salad was fresh. An odd thing about this place is that the straws were not wrapped, just sticking out of the server's apron. Seems a little unsanitary to me, especially since I don't know the last time that apron was washed. Overall, a nice place, would visit again."
Janice C.,"Seattle, WA",101,240,33,3.0,4/16/2015,"Honestly the food here isn't the best.  I got the chicken southwest style salad. While it was good, my problem was that the salad was not cold at all. It was warm. When I eat a salad, I expect crisp cold vegetables and warm chicken. I got warm chicken and a warm salad and a cold plate....  Stick with the pizzookies."
Fritzy A.,"Richardson, TX",6,7,16,3.0,6/13/2015,Came to BJ'S for the first time. The ambience was good. The good was okay nothing to complain. Wish the service was better. Poor customer service skills.
Sebron H.,"Plano, TX",0,16,3,5.0,12/25/2016,Love this restaurant. Our server Ashley was awesome! Very friendly and engaging without being pushy. Food was delicious as always.
Andrea M.,"Plano, TX",69,26,18,3.0,7/24/2016,"Although this place holds a special place in my heart because I had my first date with my now husband, the drinks and appetizers are all that's good. The food is average. The wait is extensive with a full bar so no place to wait your 20-30 minutes. The food just isn't worth the wait."
Swathi S.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,4.0,12/26/2016,Hi Cheese mushrooms is the best thing in bj s. Absolutely love it love it love it. I recommend it to everyone. That is one awesome dish you got to try if you go to bj's
Ashley R.,"Dallas, TX",42,3,4,5.0,6/19/2016,I had the Han n cheese so good!  My fiancé lovlved it too. Staff friendly and seated us immediately!  I will be going back an recommend bjs highly!
Jamie D.,"Dallas, TX",245,128,149,2.0,1/12/2015,"I used to love this place a lot about a year ago. I came here last before I went to study abroad with some close friends. Great food, drinks, and atmosphere and a beautiful bar at the back.  Tonight's visit sorely disappointed me...we waited over ten minutes for water alone.  Our server (maybe he was having a bad day, who knows. I'm also a server but I don't bring it to work. Or maybe it's because we're a table of young college asian girls that he wasn't happy about) regardless, he didn't smile at me once. I asked for a drink recommendation that wasnt too sweet and he didn't even give me one, only stating ""they're all sweet..""  Alright pal. Within 20 mins in and not even ordering our food, I already decided that I am not going to give him a 20% tip.  It's not very often that I get treated like straight up trash at a restaurant.....my friend had to box up her own food.... when usually, the servers box it up for you. I know I do.  2 stars for the food was good. Otherwise it would be a 1. I probably won't give this location another shot unless I have to. And if I did, I will make sure I get a different server."
Rudy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,159,27,3.0,1/30/2014,"A co-worker and I wanted to find a place to sit down and have lunch. We chose BJs, because that is her favorite place. Today I ordered the balsamic chicken served with mashed potatoes, thin onion straws, and field greens. The chicken was fantastic. I don't think I will order it with mash potatoes again, because I got full incredibly fast. We did order calamari beforehand, and it would be better if it was not so burnt.  I would have given this place a 4, but the waitress should probably not be one. I believe if you are in the service industry you should have a smile on your face at all times and the desire to actually serve and conversate with your table. She was very plain and simple, didn't talk unless she was verifying our order. It was not a positive memorable experience. I hope I get someone else next time for sure.  Other than that the food was great except for the overcooked calamari."
Richard J.,"Dallas, TX",139,33,33,4.0,7/20/2015,"Went for dinner with my parents, both of my brothers and their wives, and one nephew.  My dinner was delicious.  I had the sirloin steak, medium rare, which could have been a touch rarer, but had 0% visible fat, looked like a filet, and was almost as tender.  It lacked seasoning, but salt and pepper took care of that.  The roasted Brussels sprouts were good, but I wanted more.  The side salad was good, but again I found it a bit skimpy.  Service was excellent."
Elizabeth M.,"Dallas, TX",13,36,22,5.0,7/31/2016,"First of all I want to say that we have been past this  restaurant several times.. H time  we decided to go other places this particular time our friend  wanted to go here because my mom is here and we were looking for vegan friendly restaurants to go to.  what a surprise what a great restaurant to go to, with several choices with several dishes great dishes to choose from. Each person has something different and all of our food was great!!!! I am a very picky person and every time I've gone to a restaurant there's always something wrong this time to my surprise Not only was nothing wrong but we had an abundance of food the prices are reasonable and their servers and the manager were excellent. I will definitely come again with my family and we plan on being regulars. All the people who are saying this is a bad place and the food is horrible there's not telling the truth I don't know if you had a bad experience but I highly recommend you try it again. The server CHRIS was great and the managers as well."
Lana H.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",357,89,208,5.0,5/31/2015,I love the fact that they have a great variety of lighter meals! A great place to have a drink for watching a game! The food and staff are great! Great place for a mixed crowd of dieters and non-dieters:)
Marri Jayne M.,"Plano, TX",63,22,12,4.0,3/24/2016,"Visited BJ's near our house again last night and Pasia was an excellent server. She remembered us from our visit two weeks ago, and was funny and cordial but didn't try too hard. Also Christina, the manager on the floor stopped by to check on us and was very friendly. She answered questions we had about the mahi and shrimp dish and added to our overall dining experience."
Bruce C.,"Richardson, TX",372,609,245,2.0,5/10/2013,"Aw man.  I hate to do this but this is gonna be one of those reviews. We were so hungry.  I had gotten a slurpee late in the afternoon and my stomach was full on high fructose corn syrup.  The Wife came home and was tired so she went to take a nap.  By 8:30, I was getting hungry and she was just getting out of bed.  She was craving pizza so off to BJ's we went. We get there and it's crazy busy.  It's 8:45 and there are still people sitting outside waiting for a table.  We go inside and ask how long the wait is.  ""oh, 15 minutes.""  That's not bad.  So we wait for about 5 minutes and our pager goes off. We sit down and we know we want pizza so we order a half BJ's favorite and half Sweet Pig.  Then we wait.  It feels like forever and the Wife thinks it took about 30 minutes.  It finally comes out and as the server puts it on the pizza stand, I immediately spot a long curly (not kinky, mind you) hair on the pizza. Server: ""Would you like me to serve you your first piece of pizza?"" Me: ""There's a hair on it."" She says, ""Yup,"" and immediately takes it back to the kitchen. The Wife, ""Why'd you say that?!  I'm so hungry."" Me: ""There was a hair.  I couldn't help myself."" So the server comes back and says, ""They're making you another pizza because that is gross."" Me: ""We're so hungry..."" Server: ""Would you like me to bring you a cup of soup or a salad?"" Me: ""What do you have?""  (server lists off soups) ""Oooh clam chowder!"" The Wife: ""I'd like the tomato and mozzarella salad."" The server comes back in like 5 minutes with our starters and I will have to say, this is the best part of our meal.  The chowder was perfect.  I've probably only once had better chowder and that was in San Francisco.  This soup had a TON of clam in it.  It was thick and hearty like it should be and had the perfect texture.  You know how some clam chowder is really thin or it has a ton of potato and no clam?  This was exactly how you would want it. The Wife's salad was very good too.  It was actually a decent sized salad.  She commented that if she wanted a light dinner, this might be enough. Then came the pizza.  I'm sad to say that about 2/3 of the pizza was sweet pig and 1/3 was BJ's favorite at best.  Then of course, there are the overlap areas so technically only about 1/4 of the pizza was strictly BJ's favorite.  I was going to say something but we had already sent a pizza back for the hair and it was just getting too ridiculous.  On top of that, the pizza had been rushed and wasn't baked enough.  The crust was doughy and soggy.  Disappointing at best.  =o/ *sigh* I am very glad that they made up for our hunger with free starters.  That was very classy of them, but rushing the pizza was not the right choice."
Ritz L.,"Plano, TX",96,196,259,3.0,2/4/2015,"I was at BJ's at this location today with my husband. I've been to this location 7 years ago, but one of us had a bad meal, so we didn't return. I wanted to give this place another try. I was impressed as to how many items they have on their menu. I ordered calamari and shrimp taco. The calamari was a ok. It certainly didn't look like the picture on their menu. I really liked my shrimp taco. It was good. The waiter was very nice and friendly. One thing I noticed was that the it was a bit pricey. For that reason, I probably won't return for the 3rd time. I also might add that cookie crunch(big ole chocochip cookie with 2 big scoops of vanilla ice cream)was delicious."
Sree D.,"Plano, TX",48,57,48,4.0,3/8/2015,Tomato bisque is the bomb.get it. The best flavor so far. Service needs   can you miss my appetizer order? forget my silverware and then keep me waiting while my food turns cold. Isnt the second step in training is to provide silverware and take my drinks order. Avocado egg rolls were quite surprisingly tasty with the tamarind dip. The flight of beers were good as usual.
Richard H.,"Far North Dallas, Dallas, TX",426,200,186,2.0,5/29/2013,"Who doesn't know BJ's? Although, this is a spot my friend's often suggest. We never have a fulfilling experience. Their own drafted root beer and pizookies always bring people back, but the service and food is definitely lacking. Definitely experienced better food for the same price elsewhere. Only go for the pizookie if you are really a sweets fan."
Dawn B.,"Coppell, TX",104,217,94,2.0,1/14/2016,"Trying to be health conscious, I ordered the salmon quinoa bowl.  It seemed to be a fairly new offering on the menu and picture was so appetizing looking.  I forgot to not be fooled by the pictures,  ugh.  So my order came out and there was some white rice in it, obviously someone else's food in there.  It was just sort of sitting near the edge of the bowl/quinoa.  For some reason that just freaked me out and I started wondering where that rice could've come from.  I asked the server to make the dish again. 2nd dish came out but was missing most of the vegetables it was supposed to have on it.  What the?!?  Anyway, I figure it's probably best to play it safe and not try to be health conscious here.  Maybe they just don't do that well. LOL. I ordered the California cobb flatbread since someone else in my party had it and it looked good. They offered me a salad to eat while I waited for the flatbread, everyone else was eating at the table so that was a nice touch. The flatbread was very good.  The manager came over to apologize, ok great. BUT when I got the bill they had charged me for the flatbread. I didn't feel like chasing after it but isn't it customary when the customer has all that hassle for the food to be complimentary? Oh well."
S C.,"Plano, TX",0,3,,4.0,10/4/2016,"Just had a very pleasant dinner with Spencer as our server. My husband had a Triple Decker sandwich that came with hot and crispy fries. I had the Salmon Quinoa bowl which was tasty and well seasoned. Spencer knew we wanted a pizookie and checked with us as we were finishing our meal so he could put in the order and we wouldn't have to wait. Try the triple chocolate pizookie, it's great!!"
