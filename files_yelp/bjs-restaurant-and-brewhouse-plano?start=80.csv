J D.,"Plano, TX",0,22,,3.0,10/2/2016,"We have been eating at BJ's in Plano for years and used to love their food. Service has often been slow. Last night's meal had its pluses and minuses. My steak was very good; mashed potatoes were also good; roasted asparagus was the absolute worst asparagus I have ever eaten in my life....dry and zero taste. I requested something else and got corn......equally horrible.....dried out and was like left overs from days back. Very disappointing. No offer of adjustment on our bill was made, & the waitress made no effort to discuss it with the manager. $23 for a meal should mean it is palatable."
Clara N.,"Richardson, TX",17,102,7,3.0,12/15/2014,"First time going here. I came with friends around 10ish. When we first entered the place, the waiter was just standing there. No greetings. We had to ask  if we can just sit down anywhere, then the waiter  just walk away, expecting us to follow.. I ordered a sirloin steak dish, because I was really craving for it. But when I received it, I was super disappointed.  I was expecting a round steak, bigger than the size of a palm.. but it was a long skinny one.. like seriously, when I first received the dish, I was staring at the meat like ""what the f***"" . And I was kinda dissatisfied with the sides. I wasn't fond of the mashed potatoes and I wished that they gave me more broccoli. Does it cost extra for more broccoli? SIGH  My friend ordered a chicken tenders dish and the dish was FULL. Compared to my dish,  it was worth the money (about $6-7) while mine was like ($14-15) it can prob feed a kid. We ordered a biegnet for dessert. and it was good! Though there was a lot of whipped cream... and $7 for just one fried dough? :/  Overall BJ's is okay for other dishes beside steak."
Kelsey B.,"Tulsa, OK",0,2,,1.0,6/13/2016,I ordered a veggie cheese steak to-go and they messed my order up TWO TIMES! The first time I received a grilled chicken sandwich and the second time I received a different vegetarian sandwich --- after I confirmed that I ordered the veggie cheese steak.... When I went back inside for the second time they got the order correct but when I was eating my sandwich I noticed that their was a chunk of grilled chicken in my sandwich...... I'm a vegetarian for health reasons and with the poor service and incorrect order almost three times.. I won't be coming back. Is the cashier on drugs or something?
Joel W.,"Wylie, TX",33,13,5,5.0,3/5/2014,One of our favorite places to eat--in fact it's definitely our favorite restaurant late at night.  The gluten-free pizza is good. So is the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad; we always sub Napa cabbage to make it extra nutritious.  A good variety of brews--including ciders and their own root beer.  Blake and Vince are the best servers--and they always remember our order. :-)
Bianca S.,"Plano, TX",310,392,61,4.0,11/20/2014,You can't go wrong here.  The food is pretty good for a casual chain and there is something for everyone.  I love the avocado egg rolls and the parmesean chicken.  Of course you can't go wrong with the pizza.  Stop by during their great happy hour for cheap apps and drinks too.
Su L.,"Dallas, TX",186,366,207,3.0,8/15/2013,"Holy macrol this place is jam packed on a Thursday evening. It is insanely crowded and busy. We had friends already seated so we were luckily able to skip the wait. The draft beer is expensive here costing $5-6 for a short so you may as well get a pitcher for $16-17 instead and either look like an alcoholic by yourself or split it amongst you and your friends. Happy hour ends at 7 pm and it is only applicable in the bar area. The calamari here is super tasty and crunchy. And the pizookie (giant cookie in a tin) is a giant tin of happiness with a scoop of ice cream plopped on top. Service is pretty slow and it can take a while to get your drink order, even if it is for a glass of water. Strangely enough, the food orders tend to come out a lot faster than the drink orders. Other than that, BJ's is a pretty lively place to be at as long as you don't mind the wait."
Javan C.,"Plano, TX",52,8,,2.0,6/17/2015,"First time here the steak was great, pizza excellent, and baby back ribs fall off the bone good. Second time the ribs were WAY over-seasoned but the pizza was still awesome. Third time the steak was very salty over-seasoned to where we actually scraped off salt granules and seasoning. But again, the pizza was bomb. So do yourself a favor, stick to the pizza!"
Kristen D.,"Sachse, TX",3,36,3,4.0,9/12/2015,"I was pleasantly surprised with BJs! I was assuming it would be just average bar food, but their menu is very extensive! There is something for everyone here, and from what I could see, everyone's food looked great. Our waiter was so sweet and very attentive, the manager even came over to see how everything was tasting and how we liked our server. We went around 9 p.m and the atmosphere was also great. Overall a very pleasant experience. I will be returning."
Jeff H.,"Murphy, TX",69,105,115,5.0,6/6/2014,"Great deep dish pizza and excellent beer selection. It's usually pretty hard to find a restaurant that carries my favorite beer (Chimay) but BJ's carries it. The menu is big and there is a wide variety of different types of food to choose from.  Make sure to order a p'zookie for dessert. It's a warm, fresh-baked cookie served w ice cream. Sounds basic but it is delicious. And I never order dessert at restaurants."
C C.,"Plano, TX",6,39,3,1.0,6/4/2014,"Ordered a Blue Cheese burger and it was disappointed.  Good selection of beers, The waitress I had was dry and pushy. Barely came to check on us and seemed in a hurry to get us out there .  Ok place."
IsabellaAnna C.,"Houston, TX",24,34,1,2.0,9/9/2015,"We came on a week day and it wasn't very busy.  Yet our appetizers came out AFTER the table next to us, who got there AFTER us. We had to ask for refills and barely saw our waiter. The last time we ate there the food and service was excellent.  Tonight, not so much. We had hamburgers with wedge fries (got string fries) and the chicken wings were barely sauced.  It's the last time we are eating there. Too much money for bad service."
Daron S.,"Plano, TX",187,9,1,1.0,4/22/2015,"UPDATE: Absolutely nothing to report from BJ's. They replied to my previous review, I can only assume, purely so they'd have the appearance of caring. As instructed, I emailed them about our experience over a week ago, and no response. You're not fooling anyone with your cookie cutter fake response on here BJ's, you have bad service and/or bad management, and what's worse is you don't care. Not even the decency to reply to the email you requested."
Evan R.,"Manvel, TX",2,27,2,5.0,9/18/2015,"BJs Brewhouse is amazing. My wife and I have eaten here probably twenty times in the past two years, and it's time to write a review. It is extremely rare that one dines at an establishment and NEVER has a problem. Well, that's our case. Between the excellent brews, the awesome food, and the desserts (we rarely get those), we've never once had a problem. Hats off to you guys. Also, having the BJs app is nice, as we can get fast seating, and pay whenever we're ready as well as reap the BJs points. Great job guys, keep it up!"
Sunni M.,"Plano, TX",12,15,24,4.0,10/6/2015,The food is yummy here. The pizza is great but I usually ask them to remove the extra tomatoes that they like to add. The service is lacking a little but the food makes up for it some. The ambiance is always cool.
Jane K.,"Dallas, TX",129,89,68,2.0,1/12/2015,"Where do I begin. Service was absolutely horrible.  I came in to eat a late dinner with a girlfriend of mine. It took a while for us to get greeted, but we didn't think much about it. Our server finally showed up, dropped off coasters and then just walked away. Maybe it's the fact that we're young Asian girls and he thought we'd tip him bad that we had such poor service? But hello! If you give us bad service, you'll get a bad tip. Our server didn't smile at us even once. He looked angry and irritated the whole time. There was even a moment that he asked is ""anything else for you guys?"" while walking away and not looking at us. I've never had such poor service in my life. I would have given this place a straight up one star if it wasn't for the food. The Deep Dish Lasagna was really good and very big in portion (at least in my opinion). I had to take more than half of it home because I couldn't finish. Overall, if I ever come back to this location, I'll sit at the bar or somewhere. Our server needs to learn to smile and check up on us. We felt like he just wanted us out. Also, on a very petty note, I've never had to box up food for myself. The server has always asked if we wanted them to box it up for us. Instead, our server just handed me a box and walked away. Cool."
George S.,"Plano, TX",2,44,5,3.0,6/15/2015,Is the second time coming here first time was not bad service had been better than average but the food in the bar service has much to be desired my daughter and I like our hamburgers rare but we were told that the only choice that we would have would be medium well. After dinner I ordered an Irish coffee it came as a coffee with whiskey in it there was no presentation to the coffee there was no whip cream it was  like they didn't ever have an Irish coffee before and they charged over 8 dollars for it chances of me coming back are slim except for possible beer at the bar.
Turbobink B.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",7,3,,5.0,10/30/2015,We liked the menu. Ordered burgers and steak. The ribs look good too. Clam chowder was good.  Was told would take 20 minutes for table only took five minutes
Karen S.,"Carrollton, TX",201,29,14,5.0,12/1/2013,"There are so many things I love about this restaurant (the Plano/75 location) it's hard to know where to start. The service, especially if you know who to ask for, is excellent. I have never had bad service when I ask for someone by name.  Never!  I ask for Lauren M. unless she's tending bar.  She is awesome & deserves 5 stars. Best ever.  Friendly, charming, on top of her game. Jay is great, but he is usually at the bar so I don't sit with him as often since I prefer a booth. Blake is also very good, very efficient and goes the extra mile.  Leah is great and so is Casey.   There are lots of great servers, it's hard to get bad service unless maybe you get a new server or someone is having an off day. The menu offers so many different choices you could eat there for days...even weeks...and not repeat.  I love the clam chowder loaf, all of the burgers, the chili loaf, the onion strings.  The pizza is wonderful and if you love micro-brews, this is the place for you.  The food is always served at the appropriate temperature which I appreciate. I love the atmosphere and usually sit in one of the booths in the bar area which is open seating.  There are also many cozy booths around the edge of the restaurant if you want a less noisy location.  The bar is definitely more noisy than the restaurant, but not outrageously loud. The management is very caring and will walk around to check out the operations.  Michael M. is the GM and he gets to know all the regulars by name.  Michael M's other managers are all good and always willing to help with any problems that might occur, although rarely have I had a problem of any kind. The hot cookie desserts are amazing and not to be missed. Parking is plentiful and free.  The best time to go is right when they open for lunch  which is 10 am on weekends or 11 am during the week.  This restaurant is very popular and in my humble opinion, the best of the BJs in Dallas.  If you go for dinner, especially on the weekends, go early.   They have a wonderful take-out operation so if you want the food, but don't want to wait for a table, you can order and have your food to go very quickly. I have no complaints about this restaurant.  Everything about it is awesome as far as I am concerned.  Not everyone will agree with me but for my needs, it rocks."
Sheila H.,"Plano, TX",0,9,,3.0,5/28/2016,"I still really like BJ's, but the service has been off the last two or three times I've been there. Super slow to place your order and then a long wait to get your food. The last time I got a Caesar salad before my meal and asked them to take it back because I couldn't find one green piece of romaine lettuce in it. They brought me another that looked the exact same. The manager lady (really nice) walked by to apologize for the first salad. I asked her why the salad was so yellow, and she said that's the color of the lettuce they get from their supplier. Ooookkkkkkaaaayyyyy?!?! Weird. The pizookie is still the best dessert ever, so I'll be back!"
Will D.,"Plano, TX",5,76,1,3.0,6/11/2014,"BJ's is a solid restaurant for you money.  We typically go during the week for lunch.  The Soup/Salad combo is hard to beat.  Not very expensive and you can get multiple salad and soups. Great for a quick bite.  It can get busy, so we always just walk in and seat ourselves at the high top tables."
