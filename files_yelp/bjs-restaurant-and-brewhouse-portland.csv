Michael L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",10,401,37,4.0,10/25/2017,"What can I say?  It's just like any BJ's in the US.  My ""senior"" buddy likes the jambalaya and insists on meeting here.  I recommend the jambalaya, Cajun pasta and rib eye steak."
Lauren Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",93,203,6,3.0,1/5/2018,Extensive menu with a variety of options! I chose the blackened salmon. It was good. Not great. Date had pizza and a beer. Nothing special. We weren't expecting great we were starving and shopping at jantzen beach.  Yah I'd come back and try one of the 5 million other things on the menu. Kirk was our waiter and made the experience way better!
Whitney P.,"Portland, OR",39,213,555,3.0,12/22/2017,"If you've never been here, be prepared to spend a lot of time perusing the menu.  We came here expecting pizza and sandwiches, but the 5-6 page menu offers A LOT more than that. I hate a Greek Gyro and Caesar Salad.  The gyro was really good (excellent taziki sauce) the salad was just average. One of my friends got the baby back ribs and said they were delicious (they sure looked and smelled good!). My other friend got a burger, ordered ""rare with lots of pink"" but it arrived cooked well-done. Our server was nice, but she never checked on us to see if we needed beverages re-filled or if the food was okay (?). She brought the check and asked if we wanted dessert and still didn't ask if our food was ok or not.  It was before lunchtime (11:00am - 12:00pm) so there were hardly any other customers, which is why we expected more attentive service. There were a few items on the menu that sounded good, so I'll be back :)"
Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",504,559,1042,2.0,12/8/2017,"Bummer! I've been to BJ's many times throughout the years but never dined at this location. I came here once when we first moved nearby hoping to get my favorite wine but they don't carry Mirassou moscato at this location. Anywho, months later I came today with my friend because we needed to go next door to the dentist so stopped by for happy hour. Only to be more disappointed because happy hour's changed?? No more half off apps and such?  Ugg, lame. It's only $2 off now and I enjoyed their happy hour because prices tend to be on the higher end even for appetizers.. we ended up ordering the pulled pork sandwich. I wanted to enjoy the fries, it's got that special crispiness I enjoy but.. it had a funky aftertaste. Maybe the fryer oil had gone bad? The pork itself drowned in BBQ sauce was plump and good but that had a weird aftertaste too.. maybe something was wrong with my tastebud? The coleslaw was just horrible to even look at. Not much creaminess.. chunky and huge.. rather than chopped up finely.  We sat in the bar and it was just way too dark. I could barely see where I was walking. This BJ's is a disappointment compared to the other locations I've been to."
Katrina T.,"Vancouver, WA",16,38,9,3.0,11/13/2017,"We come here often for the Monday pizza special.  Unfortunately, it's very inconsistent.  When it's good, it's GREAT!  This time around, the sauce was the consistency of water on two of the four pizzas we ordered.  Both were the ""Spicy Pig"", so I thought maybe it was the pineapple; asked to have them remade with pineapple on the aide, but they still came out super runny.   They did take care of us by first replacing the pizzas and second providing a couple of free pizookies, which we appreciated.  Just wish they could be more consistent.  We really hate being the complaining customers  Also, their customer loyalty program is a bit different than others; the customer has to actually tell the server when they want to use a reward.  I think it's odd that the server doesn't at least say something like ""you have a $10 off reward, did you want to apply that today?"""
Malena W.,"Southwest Portland, Portland, OR",0,2,2,2.0,12/17/2017,"I've been to many BJ's restaurants over the years and I was extremely disappoint by the experience today. The only redeeming quality was the service, which was fast and friendly.  We started with chips and queso, which had almost no flavor but tasted a bit like cucumber. Next, we got avocado egg rolls. The sauce tasted like a mix of soy sauce and high fructose corn syrup, and the egg roll itself had very little flavor. Last, I got a personal deep dish pizza. It was served on a dirty plate rather than its normal cast iron pan. The pizza was cold and the cheese was not melted. The crust was soggy and flavorless. The ""fresh tomatoes"" were either canned or had sat in the fridge for too long- they were mush. My friend had an Asian chicken salad which she said was okay.  I would not recommend, or return to, this location."
Sandy L.,"Lakehead, CA",39,3,1,1.0,8/29/2017,"This location doesn't even deserve 1 star. (& I say location, because the BJ's in So Cal is amazing). We waited 40 min at curbside,paid $39 plus 20% tip, & this is my husbands sandwich . Nothing on it."
Tricia S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,127,195,3.0,11/19/2017,"I placed an online order for curbside pick up; I was only a short distance away so I got there 15 minutes before my designated pick up time. I still called the number (as directed) to let them know I had arrived. The hostess came out and took my payment, asked if I needed utensils and napkins (I said yes), and told me it would be a few minutes. I was impressed with the speed, because it was still 10 minutes early. So I waited ...  I waited nearly 30 minutes, 15 minutes past my quoted time! The place was busy so I didn't fault the hostess ... I took my food and thanked her and drove off.  And because it was just that kind of night, I discovered that I had no utensils or napkins after I had gotten into PJs back at my hotel.   The food was delicious ... but the service and missing necessities left me desiring more. Better luck next time?"
Greg E.,"Vancouver, WA",10,6,,2.0,12/19/2017,Prices are high. Food is mediocre at best. The red sauce for the spaghetti and the shrimp with asparagus and penne was really bland.
Rose B.,"Newark, CA",15,26,4,5.0,12/15/2017,"After looking at a bunch of pizza places, none of their pictures appealed to me until I saw BJ's. I have been to BJ's before yet never ordered the pizza. I decided for BJ's favorite pizza. I was not disappointed. Even the crust was better than most pizzas I have had before.  I was only going to order a small pizza for myself when the waitress informed me I could order a large for the price of a small. Really?!?! This just make this deal even sweeter! I know what I'm having for dinner tonight!!"
Sheri C.,"Seattle, WA",210,1826,1610,3.0,2/12/2017,"Chain restaurant that we didn't want to go to from all the bad reviews we've heard of other locations but thought we'd try it given the limited choices in the area late at night.  Overall, a 3 star experience. A long menu offering pizza, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, fish, steak, ribs, salads and more, I couldn't decide on what I wanted.  Finally got some chicken wings which were the wingless type, so more like long chicken nuggets.  The waitress brought three sauces to try.  The husband really liked the root beer sauce.  Their odd version of ranch was bad.  We shared some avocado rolls that were subpar - burnt on the edges, lacking seasoning and mostly a weird mashup of cream cheese with some sprinkled shredded carrot and a dash of parsley.  The menu said they came with sundried tomatoes, cilantro, red onions, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices - nope to all of that. See my picture.  Husband got the spicy chicken with peanut sauce and soba noodles and said it was all right.  We shared a salted caramel pazookie which was a mooshy, hot cookie with caramel and salted caramel ice cream sprinkled with chocolate chips - that was really good. The waitress checked on us often and was helpful but not in our face.  The hostess didn't seat us, telling us to go seat ourselves in the bar area which I thought was odd. Bathroom was clean although the hallway is dark. Food: 2.5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Parking: 3"
Tim T.,"Vancouver, WA",267,17,8,2.0,11/19/2017,We stopped in for lunch today and we were very disappointed. Wedge salad was just ok. My chicken was over cooked then served cold. Sides were cold too. My wife's sandwich and fries were also cold. Server never checked to see if we were ok so we ate our cold mediocre food and left. Service and food quality was off on this visit. Should have had my birthday lunch somewhere else.
Marty E.,"Vancouver, WA",0,9,,2.0,11/4/2017,It is really bad when your food arrives and you have to ask the server if you can borrow a fork because we forgot to bring our own. Oh wait they didn't bother to set the table and the server wasn't attentive to notice the lack of silverware and napkin. But its not over yet because the same thing happened at a table across from me a few minutes later. Of course there wasn't a manager on the floor managing the people. Do the inmates run the asylum or is this just a lack of qualified management?. They should hire me as a consultant to retrain management to industry standards as I used in my 28 years in the restaurant business at all levels up to and including Regional Manager.
Dawn G.,"Olympia, WA",10,201,1320,4.0,1/26/2017,"Hungry from a morning and afternoon of shopping and happy hour here was perfect! Courtney is a fabulous server in the bar area..... we were immediately greeted and given menus, checked on frequently, everything delivered quickly, and always with a smile! Our table had two appetizers - the Santa Fe Rolls and the California Club Flatbread to share. Both were excellent. Then I had the crispy Jalepeno burger and it was delicious as well! And the lemon drops and cosmos were good as well. The happy hour drinks are only $5 and appetizers $4-$6. Overall we love this place and will stop by again when we are in the area! Even if it isn't happy hour the menu is huge and well prices and the service is excellent!"
Hannah V.,"Mercer Island, WA",0,12,4,2.0,8/13/2017,"The picture of the soba noodles looked very good. In reality I got a small, mushed up pile of gray strings."
Iris P.,"Vancouver, WA",66,37,36,4.0,12/25/2016,"This is such a great happy hour joint! Mon.-Fri. From 3pm to 7pm and Sat.- Thur. 10 to close. Half price mini pizzas, which are spectacular and filling. Also, $2 off apps. And $1 off draft beers. I totally recommend the berry crisp cider, which is hands down superior to Mcmenamin's Ruby."
Gary G.,"Troutdale, OR",29,3,,5.0,12/11/2017,"Great food, great service, nice atmosphere and a terrific menus! I'll definitely be back!"
Victoria P.,"Boring, OR",70,5,3,5.0,6/10/2017,I can't say enough of how great this place was! The atmosphere the food the service everything was on point!!!
Flory W.,"Portland, OR",309,560,6,3.0,7/23/2016,"After ordering what we wanted, and already started eating our meals, our waiter told us, it's all-you-can eat salad & soup, on Thursdays!  We ordered Caesar Salad, one of my favorite salads, we had seconds. Hubby ordered clam chowder in a toasted sourdough bread bowl. IT was VERY HOT, but once it cooled off a bit, it was so good!  We wanted seconds for this, too, but we couldn't!  Our waiter had new customers that sat behind us, and they talked & talked & talked, and we also waited so long for our ticket, because he went to deliver them their drinks and continued visiting with them - they're acquaintances.  We have an agenda to go to, and we've been here longer than we thought, otherwise, we could have asked him for more clam chowder, instead we're so upset by now, we just asked for our ticket! I also ordered the Classic Grilled Cheese Grilled sourdough filled with Havarti and cheddar cheese, with tomato slices in between. The fries & the sandwich are both one of my favorites, and if you love seasoned thin crispy fries, this is where to go! Negative: the restroom's toilet is problematic flushing."
Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4468,2212,19024,4.0,12/31/2015,"Pizzookie, Pizza, and Beer. Life can be so simple sometimes. Keepin' life simple is the BJ's chain of restaurants and brewhouses and the Jantzen Beach location on Hayden Island in the Columbia River is a convenient tax-free simple slice of life.  Jeremiah Red is my favorite beer at BJ's, but you can't go wrong with a HopStorm IPA or the Harvest Hefeweizen. It's beer. The brew it here (or some of it). It's all totally a-ok. (3 stars) The deep dish pizza is classic greasy thick pizzaness. Go half-n-half to try different toppings and add Jalapenos if you want a little kick. An order of Chicken Wings are served drizzled with Ranch Dressing and Buffalo Sauce. Between the pizza and wings, you're gonna need more napkins. My wife got the Brussels Sprouts appetizer for a healthier, but not nearly as yummy take on your mom's least favorite vegetable. (3 stars) If you like freebies for your birthday, sign up for their mailing list and enjoy a free warm mini-Pizzookie dessert with Ice Cream. My choice? A White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizzookie. (4 stars) BJ's isn't a magical pizza or beer pub, but it is 3.5 stars rounded up for being a simple, convenient, and reliable choice for beer, pizza, and a pizzookie."
Sarah M.,"Vancouver, WA",16,11,,4.0,6/17/2017,This place isn't that great. Went for take out... Didn't seem to be ran well n the food wasn't worth the price.  I have been again for dine in a few times and the food was much better. S
Anna M.,"Portland, OR",0,10,8,1.0,3/5/2017,"I'm updating my review.   We ordered the Seared Ahi Salad which I loved last time.  The $15.95 salad is described as:  ""Baby field greens, Napa cabbage, romaine and red bell peppers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette. With tomatoes, avocado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, crisp wonton strips and green onions."" The salad I saw when I opened the box at home was about half the size of the salad I previously enjoyed, had about half the number of the seared tuna, had a few chunks of tomatoes, maybe a couple slices of red peppers, and absolutely NO AVOCADO, PICKLED CUCUMBER, CILANTRO, GREEN ONIONS OR WASABI. The host was nice as always, and it was busy in there.  However, I paid almost $16 for a salad that wasn't even worth $5. It would be one thing if I ordered it and it contained everything listed on the menu description and I just didn't like it, but to leave out the good stuff? C'mon.  And the avocado egg rolls were somehow tiny and so very lacking compared to previous orders.  These items were a far cry from BJ's back in the day. I've loved this BJ's since I was a kid.  I don't see myself ever going back."
Janelle V.,"Vancouver, WA",1,13,2,4.0,9/22/2017,I love all the staff that works at this location!! They are always so friendly and great service. We always sit at the bar. I have never had a terrible meal here. We love it for a quick bite for lunch or happy hour gathering with our office. Their menu has a variety and everything I have eaten was really great.
Rachel B.,"Lahaina, HI",129,14,4,5.0,4/5/2017,"I looooove BJ's! Their pizookies are to die for. I've gone here on multiple occasions just for a pizookie. The triple chocolate Ghirardelli one is my favorite! They also have great food and drinks. An American Moscow mule with strawberry added to it is my drink of choice. It is cheaper to get a pizookie than that drink, though! They also have great deals like $3 pizookies on Tuesdays, as well as $9.95 burgers with unlimited fries on Wednesdays. I didn't know it the first few times I went, but they have their own premiere rewards program. It gives out more free goodies, so you can't go wrong with signing up! I also have to add in here that Riley is an amazing server! We've started to request her. She remembers us and our orders, plus she is great at making sure we are being taken care of!"
David P.,"Bentonville, AR",32,244,616,4.0,8/3/2016,Ordered dessert. The Pizookie Trio three minis each served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. You get to pick your three flavors.
Sara M.,"Vancouver, WA",36,94,66,5.0,5/25/2016,"This place is pretty great. I've been wanting to try it for awhile now and we defiantly didn't want to go to hooters across the street so this was the best choice.  I got the lunch chicken alfredo with a mozzarella and tomato salad. It was fantastic. And for a really good price. The deep dish pizza that my partner got looked delicious too! The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was pretty good. Reminds me of home with all the wood decor. I can't wait to go back so I can try the pizza cookie things that they have for dessert.  The ONLY downside was, when we got to our car someone came up to us begging for money."
Andrew C.,"Battle Ground, WA",11,290,360,4.0,6/20/2016,This visit was very pleasant our server was josh U. Not the same josh from our last visit. He was very attentive and personable. The food is always good and consistent. I recommend this place for a good meal and great beers
Stephen K.,"Damascus, OR",40,166,559,4.0,8/16/2015,"BJ's is a solid restaurant with a HUGE menu.  It is definitely better than The Ram, which is its closest competitor from my experience. Their menu boasts that they are known for their pizzas, but they honestly taste just like they could be bringing them in from Pizza Hut (which is not a good thing). The chicken wings are particularly good, and are done differently here than at most places.  They do not toss the wings in sauce, unless you ask them to.  They drizzle a bit over them for garnish, and serve the sauce on the side. BJ's has a lot of cool ""technological"" things such as a mobile app that lets you place orders, get reward points, and pay at the table. The ambiance is more upscale than one might expect as well.  BJ's gets VERY busy, so call or reserve on-line ahead of time."
Chelsea C.,"Portland, OR",1,63,17,4.0,7/30/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by me dinner at BJ's. I use to really love BJ's but a few years back it went down hill. I was hesitant to go back again, but last night I was satisfied with my dinner. I got a drink, a small bites plate, and a burger for less that $25, which was a surprise considering what I remember prices were a few years ago. Will still be cautious when I go, but if they continue like they did the other day, my opinion towards BJ's might soon be different."
Sarah M.,"Portland, OR",118,27,18,1.0,7/1/2017,"I'm from California and when I see that there was a BJs here in Portland I was ecstatic! So being that I live in deep Oregon City, 42min plus drive smh....I decided to go get BJs for dinner and to my disappointment was it horrible!!! The Jambalaya was so dry and yeah it was spicy but it was bland nothing too rant and rave about! I spent $69 and I am going to do complain due to the fact I work hard for money and I expect to at least get good food regardless if I make no money or a lot of money!! BJs needs to make this right!! Now that I seen and read the reviews they really need to change things desperately!!"
Everett M.,"Saint Louis, MO",329,80,304,3.0,3/24/2016,"Came here with a friend on International Pizookie Day for a free pizookie and was not disappointed. Our server was phenomenal and ensured that we were well taken care of. This BJ's has a pretty good beer selection considering it's located in Portland and has a pretty nice happy hour. Some items on the menu are quite delectable, such as the deep dish pizza. Not to forget about their delicious pizookies. For those of you who are unaware of what a pizookie is, it is a giant freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream. Being a chain there's nothing too special here in particular, but it still is a nice restaurant to go check out if you're in search of a bite to eat and something to drink. I would recommend this place for groups or for a nice relaxed date night."
Captain C. Branagain G.,"Astoria, OR",47,575,8,4.0,9/7/2016,"Most chain eateries like this bore me.  Uninspired bar food attempting to be flashy and hip that is priced too high, served by perky co-eds trying to make ends meet.  While BJ's gets lumped in this genre of chains, it does a pretty damn good job at rising above the sea of mediocrity. The menu takes a few weeks to read all of the way through. So many choices that even your picky pain in the ass mates can find culinary satisfaction. We arrived around 9 to be quickly seated.  Service didn't really suffer despite the crowded house, though drink refills seemed to challenge them as far as efficiency was considered..  Mixed drink prices were pretty high, but food prices were in line with the quality. Bottomless chips and salsa was the perfect starter.  Flatbread pizza appetizer was really flavourful.  Kitchen was not as attentive on some special orders, but the server quickly took care of them to our satisfaction. All of our entrees were really good.  The ladies devoured their salted caramel cookie creations as afters. This was my first visit to BJ's (we even went to a different location the following night) and it is now going to be a regular option when we are in the Portland area."
JP B.,"Boulder, CO",66,75,36,5.0,5/2/2017,Best BJ's we've been to! Food was hot and fresh. Waitperson attentive and friendly! We had trouble finding a meal in Vancouver so headed to familiar BJ's. Happy we did!
Melissa S.,"Vancouver, WA",126,21,1,1.0,7/20/2016,"We have been to BJ's on multiple occasions and I have always felt that they have had good service and I am all for 2nd chances, however tonight was horrible and the staff didn't seem to care. We arrived and had a party of 10 total.  The waitress took drink order and gave us time to order.  When it was finally time to order we ordered around 9:55pm, we had 2 more join us about 10 min later.  After everyone ordered she never came back to check on us or refill our drinks.  Another waitress brought out 1 part of our order for 1 person that arrived last and after 30 min the rest of our parties food never arrived.  Oh and did I mention this also included 2 kids under the age of 7 that did amazingly well. By 10:30 we decided to leave, we requested our checks.  There was never a sincere apology or reason as to why our food never came out.  The waitress didn't even seem to care.  I would have paid for my food to go, but was never offered a chance.  A manager just said sorry.  Poor service, very disappointing.  Hope they can figure it out and actually care what their customers think."
Autumn B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,2.0,6/3/2017,"Food was terrible, service sucked.  First off we show up and the hostess isn't very welcoming. She brings us to our table. Our server took 10 or more minutes to show up to greet herself and to take our drink orders. we get our drinks and ordered our food. We waited well over 45 minutes for our food to arrive. My boyfriend ordered something with rice and the rice was completely under cooked. Like it was still crunchy as if it was cooked for maybe 5 minutes. My food however tasted like old pork and was absolutely disgusting. Im only giving them a 2 star because the manager didn't make us pay for either dishes and while the waitress completely was terrible she was still really nice."
Meredith M.,"Vancouver, WA",69,184,,3.0,8/25/2016,"I'm giving this an extra star because our waiter was on point and our food came out quickly.   The beverages were pretty good.  I had their new peach beer and my husband had iced tea.   Sadly, that was the best part of the food experience.   Salads sounded good on the menu so I ordered the wedge and husband ceasar.  The downside was they were served on very warm plates and were drowning in dressing.   We also each ordered a small deep dish.   Keep in mind they are more than happy to substitute toppings which I partook in because I really wanted pepperoni instead of grilled chicken on my pizza.  Pizzas were pretty greasy and weren't that great.   If you are in the area try Stanfords instead."
Brooke M.,"Portland, OR",160,15,,5.0,5/25/2017,Awesome beer !! Great food! Try the red beer it's the best beer I've had in a long time! Kid friendly. Fast service and nice wait staff :)
Wiley M.,"Ridgefield, WA",19,6,3,4.0,7/27/2017,"Stopped in for dinner with my sister not expecting an amazing experience but boy was I wrong! There was a wait when we walked in but instantly the hosts (cami and darcy I believe) were so friendly and accommodating it was refreshing to have a sincere smile as soon as we walked in. Our server Ray was over the top with customer service, we didn't like the boneless wings (pretty much just nuggets tossed in sauce) and as soon as I mentioned something he was quick to bring us something different. Food ended up being amazing and scored a free mini pizookie! I now love bjs ;-)"
UmiD S.,"La Mesa, CA",2,25,,5.0,4/15/2017,Came here for dinner the other day. Hostess was very nice and very friendly. Hands down to the best waitress. She was very nice and very polite. She'd take her time with us and would check often if we needed anything else. Good food and great people. Definitely will be coming back. I highly recommend for travelers as well. It's right off of I-5.
Joan F.,"Portland, OR",117,354,774,3.0,10/31/2015,"We've only had pizza to go here, but we've ordered five different times because Dominoes won't deliver to Hayden Island, so I feel informed enough to avoid this place.  I've only had the pathetic gluten free pizza--save yourself money and avoid this stuff. You'll find better pizza in the frozen aisle at Costco.  My teen son thinks the regular pizza is much better than the gluten free fare. The service is fine, and the restaurant is clean and bright. It's always busy when we drop in, but I find it marginal and not worth the cost."
