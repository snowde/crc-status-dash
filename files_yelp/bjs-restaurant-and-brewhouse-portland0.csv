Hunter O.,"Murfreesboro, TN",41,375,43,3.0,5/11/2012,came here on a lunch meeting and it was ok just normal food ok price and the staff was ok..
Christine S.,"Portland, OR",41,77,32,3.0,10/2/2009,"Good food and good beer and great service. We had a flight of 7 beers that looked to me to be about 6-7 oz pours. None of the seven were bad and none of them were exceptional, just a good selection of beer, none of which were incredible but none of which were bad. I thought the food was a little over priced and it didnt have great atmosphere but if i lived or worked close by i'd stop in occasionally."
Wanda W.,"Coupeville, WA",0,14,,5.0,9/29/2012,"Can't think of anything bad about our experience here.  The service was great and our server's recommendations were helpful.  She knew everything about the beer choices.  The food was terrific, the beer was delightful and the ambience was perfect.  This is a nice place to have a beer, food and a pleasant visit with your friends."
Rachelle C.,"Vancouver, WA",2,22,1,4.0,2/11/2012,"We're originally from San Diego, so we were familiar with BJ's before moving here.  This location was alright, we went for lunch on a Sunday and it was busy but we were seated right away.  We started our meal with some appetizers, the spinach and artichoke dip was alright, I found it a little salty and wished they served it with toasted bread instead of tortilla chips :( We also had some fried artichoke hearts, these were crunchy and yummy when paired with ranch, (on their own seemed just a little on the bland side) and we had some chicken flatbread pizza.  The pizza was really more like a cracker with toppings, it could hardly be considered a pizza, it was ok.  For lunch I had the salmon with veggies and my husband ordered a double jalapeno burger.  My food was good though I didn't care for the sauce they poured over it and my husband raved about his burger.  Overall it was a good trip, slightly overpriced, but decent."
Paul R.,"Portland, OR",0,7,,2.0,5/10/2010,"I went into this experience full of hope that Bjs would impress me, after all, as a microbrew fan, I really enjoy the experience of trying a locally made beer. So I was very disappointed when I ordered a ""pint"" of their porter.  Is it too much to ask that a place with ""brewery"" in the name know what a pint is?!  The glass was much smaller than a true pint and wasn't even cold.  I just expected so much more.  If you want to get a real pint that comes in a nice cold glass you could try the Ram, much better. The food was pretty average, similar to what you would get at applebees.  I got a California burger, which was good, but nothing worth remembering. One redeeming factor was the baked potatoes looked really good. They are huge, my brother and mother both got one and seemed to enjoy them."
Kathy D.,"Vancouver, WA",0,53,,5.0,4/1/2012,I'be been coming here for years.  Consistently great food and service!  Delicious lunch specials.
Maggie N.,"Tulsa, OK",42,221,,5.0,2/4/2007,"This is my favorite restaurant on Jantzen Beach. The calzones are incredible, and so is almost everything else I've tried from the pot roast to the nice variety of very delicious and unique beers. Every time I go without my man, he requests that I return home with a giant stuffed baked potato. He's obsessed with them. You can check out their menu online, too."
A N.,"Seattle, WA",31,100,7,4.0,7/9/2010,"Service can be spotty but the food is good and the beer is tasty. I've been here several times and more recently (4th of July weekend) we did take out and had a picnic. YUM! Salads are huge, burgers are good and the kids don't want to play their ds they actually want to eat! Awesome!"
Sara R.,"Eugene, OR",0,27,,3.0,4/5/2010,"Just good enough sums it up.  Most things are reasonably priced, and decent food.  Better than most chains, but still a chain and it shows."
Chad P.,"Vancouver, WA",0,16,,3.0,3/20/2010,"First time going. Waiter took a little longer then we liked to serve us, but nothing too bad. Some of the beers on tap were good. food was alright, probably won't go back though. Overall, I prefer Red Robin, or some of the other chain places over this place, but if you are in the area, I didn't see anything better, give it a try."
