Roni S.,"Reedsport, OR",50,3,1,5.0,9/17/2014,This chain never disappoints. Good service. Like the variety of menu choices. Great beer.  Family friendly atmosphere.
Holly K.,"Welches, OR",876,483,578,3.0,10/21/2011,"We were starving when we pulled in here, it was lunch time and people were really piling in. I thought for sure we'd have to wait forever, but it turns out, the place is ginormous and we got seated right away. The waitress was really on top of it. We started out with wings, which sort of threw me off, since they were going to rock it all fancy and just add lines of ranch of and buffalo sauce over the top. Like some fancy ice cream sundae. Applause for originality here, but boos for, where the hell is the sauce? I uploaded a picture of them and no I was not drunk when I snapped it, just appears that way. They had an okay flavor, and then I added a Mozzarella salad for $2.95 and was surprised by the the size, the flavor was good. I was feeling pretty hopeful about my selection of shrimp tacos. My son had the cream of broccoli soup, which was pretty good, he gave me the last 1/2 cup of it or so. The small version was pretty large and he said it was getting really rich.  Then they lost their other two yelp stars after that, the shrimp tacos were a major let down. Zip on the flavor and lots of stale chips on the side. Oh, they were pretty reds and blues, but tasted like they'd sat out all week. the shrimp tacos and chips came with two tiny cups of a sauce and salsa, not enough to dip chips, if you even were considering it and barely enough to add to the shrimp to bring em back to life. I asked for extra sauce, and the waitress didn't remember to bring it, and I was pretty much over it by that point.  They are friendly enough, but if I had to do it again, I might have stuck with the lunch special for $5.95, in the picture it looks really small, but we saw them going by and it would have been plenty. My son had a lunch pizza and said it was really good and said the crust was really light."
Mark E.,"Dryden, WA",19,43,54,5.0,11/2/2013,"We chose  BJ's based on proximity to our hotel. When we arrived we had a 30 minute wait which told me it shod be good.  We ordered a mini chicken garlic pizza on hand thin crust and it tasted spectacular, the crust had a buttery garlic flavor with the perfect crispity crunch  we also ordered the jambalaya with shrimp,chicken and Andoli sausage,  it had the perfect amount of spice throughout. The staff was friendly and attentive throughout and when my glass was half empty there was a full one sitting there waiting.  To top it off we had the triple pizookie for desert. A perfect blend of warm cookies topped with a scoop of ice cream.  You can't go wrong with this place"
Susan G.,"Vancouver, WA",22,5,6,4.0,5/10/2015,Always great food and good service.  The clam chowder is excellent.   So are the crispy fries. Having spaghetti marinara.
Amanda K.,"Portland, OR",266,216,55,4.0,1/3/2014,"Um, sorry guys. I know we live in the Great Land of Locally Sourced Hand Crafted Food and Cocktails, but sometimes, you might end up eating at a chain restaurant. And it might actually be.....GOOD?! The salad dressing was meh, the beer is meh, but the pizza? Sorry again, but the pizza is KILLER. The deep dish is so yum. Light sauce, crispy yet chewy and soft, basically awesome. They also brew their own root beer, which my little brother is convinced is the final word in ""craft soda"". HAH!!! Craft soda. And they were able to accommodate my giant family of 6 (not including a toddler) on a busy Sunday night at last minute. Bonus points."
Bob V.,"Vancouver, WA",0,9,4,5.0,4/16/2016,The management and service go beyond great. The food and drink are also on top of my list of good places to dine.
Kaysea B.,"Longview, WA",3,2,,5.0,7/24/2015,This place is amazing :)!! The broccoli cheddar bread bowl was amazing and so creamy! ! They are fast on service and make sure you have drinks at all times ! VERY FRIENDLY! !!! I would come here again for a 3rd time :)!!
Justice L.,"Vancouver, WA",23,25,2,3.0,9/30/2014,only come here for 2 things... the pizookie and their Avocado Egg Rolls... they are to die for. You can find this chain mainly in California but Im glad to see one up here in Oregon for my Avocado Egg Rolls fix... too bad they closed the Lloyd Center location. Also wish the Avocado Egg Rolls weren't $10 for 4 :(
Heather S.,"Portland, OR",360,706,251,4.0,3/24/2013,"Really good veggie pizza -- they can make it standard or thin crust (we had the thin crust variety) and it was well worth going off our Paleo diet. YUM! Also, really reasonable prices. I would definitely opt for BJ's again!"
Nancy R.,"Covington, WA",119,61,15,4.0,1/8/2015,"For a chain Bj is pretty darn awesome! Avocado egg rolls are a must have. I've been to the Tukwilia location numerous times and every time I'm greeted with kindness! Great food portions,Great beer selection, what more can you ask for?"
Jolo L.,"Papaikou, HI",53,1,,1.0,3/20/2016,If you are staying in Jantzen Beach - I highly don't recommend it. Orders were messed up and I waited over an hour to be served my food. Waiters were asked about the status of the food multiple times and nothing was done. Amends were attempted to be made but nothing could have been done to repair the emotional damages.
Cortney C.,"Phoenix, AZ",29,7,8,5.0,1/17/2014,"We had a great experience for a late lunch BJ's. Food was fabulous and healthy!! We managed to save room for a gluten free pazookie (not so healthy).. Our lunch lasted long enough for Happy Hour... Had a glass of Cabernet  on the happy hour menu, tasty wine!!!"
Sporthaven M.,"Vancouver, WA",1,19,1,3.0,6/11/2013,"My wife and I stopped here on Sunday in the afternoon for a light lunch. I got the Mexican burger and it was bland with very little flavor. My wife got a chicken sand and we both had fries and an order of deep fried cheese sticks. The da core is nice ,waitress was great and the beer was real good, Just the burger was more like a fast foo burger. Total cost with tip was $50.00 and seemed a little high for the lunch."
Maya M.,"Portland, OR",0,6,2,2.0,2/27/2016,The food was okay I ordered chicken strips and French fries the fries were  skinny and the chicken strips were ok I had better also when you kepted eating the French fries it  left a wired taste in my mouth and needed a little salt
Alex W.,"Portland, OR",0,2,,1.0,4/12/2015,"I would put no stars if available, love the food but the customer service was 100% terrible. Workers Sitting in the booth next to us using profane language talking about inappropriate personal life stories . Unacceptable!!! By far the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in my life. Pray for your workers and this reminds me of where the world is going, America......."
Gin B.,"Brush Prairie, WA",0,34,,5.0,12/9/2015,"We've eaten at BJ's a couple of times now.  Enjoyed our visits very much.  Good food and gluten free options.  Our waiter, Pooya, was very helpful, pleasant and a good server.  We'll go back!"
Kristen M.,"Hillsboro, OR",948,916,922,3.0,7/17/2012,"BJ's is one of my favorite chains to go to! WHY??!! Well I've got 3 Reasons: (1) Great selection of decent beer (2) I love their pizza (yes it's greasy, but so good with the beer). I know it's not the best pizza in the whole wide world, but it's pretty good for a chain! (3) But most of all, I love their chocolate chip pizookie, which comes a la mode! ($5.95) This can be quite sweet for many, but this dish is definitely great to share with a couple of friends (or a date!). This BJ's is a bit smaller than the California chains I've been to. Service was decent. They have their own parking lot. The restaurant can be seen off the 5 freeway and is located next to Target and McDonald's. I wouldn't mind coming back here for a pizookie!"
Kris O.,"Vancouver, WA",8,47,2,2.0,4/28/2015,They changed the bar into seating that allows kids. We used to enjoy the kid free zone. I say let them have happy hour in the restaurant and let us have our adult only zone.
Jon P.,"Bremerton, WA",0,26,1,4.0,11/17/2014,"I was staying at the rv park around the corner and decided to go there to have a beer and wound up having several and a happy hour order of the avo egg rolls. I have been to several BJ'S before in Stockton and Tacoma and was surprised at how small this one was. I sat in the bar and all the staff were quite friendly as were several of the other folks at the bar. We had several conversations and the guy next to me,who turned out to be the asst of the Hooter around the corner, asked if I had ever tried a Buffalo bite and bought me one to try. It's 3/4 Tatonka stout and 1/4 berry cider and was awesome. Tatonka is 8.5% and so you need to be careful. A fun time and good food and beer."
Dave B.,"Gladstone, OR",73,21,,4.0,6/19/2013,"This is one of my favorite go-to places. The service is always excellent there and the food is great. I don't know how they keep such reasonable prices with such a large menu.  You can get just about anything you want there. I have never been disappointed in the quality of the food. I usually find myself asking for a to-go box because the portions are generous. This location, near my home, has the best people working there. Always a friendly face and attentiveness. My water glass and Iced Tea never seem to get to less than 1/4 full before my server or a runner is there to fill them up. There is another large franchise right across the street from them I will not patronize because their service stinks and the food is overpriced."
