Bob R.,"Gresham, OR",0,6,,3.0,7/19/2015,"Good food and drinks, but service is slow. 15 minutes just for drinks. And if you're thinking of buying a beer/cider mix, just move on--tastes like cough medicine. Love Tatonka!  Food is consistently tasty faire. Just wosh they could speed things along.  If you're patient, this is your place."
Courtney F.,"Vancouver, WA",0,5,,5.0,2/12/2015,"I can't say enough good things about this place! I'm so glad I work so close! The staff is so kind and attentive and even the manager is a kind an active member of the BJs team. The menu has a pretty large selection, which can make it difficult but only because everything is so tasty! My favorites are most definitely the Maui glazed pork chop and the peanut butter smores pizooki. Neither dish sounded like something I would typically go for but the Maui pork chop has an amazing spice in it that gives it a delicious kick and the smores pizooki is a great way to end a wonderful dining experience! If you read this all the way to the end you should go reward yourself with a wonderful lunch, dinner or dessert with the wonderful BJs team!"
Bruce W.,"Vancouver, WA",1,8,,5.0,1/13/2016,"I've eaten at this location for years. I've had the occasional less than perfect meal, but that is so rare, I cannot rate less than five stars with all the positives. Pricing is very good for quality and serving size. Favorites include the clam chowder, cherry glazed salmon, not fresh pacific salmon, but at $14.95 I don't expect that. Also like the beef dip and jambalaya. The jambalaya is not as spicy as some would like, but it's just right for me. Salads are average, so I go for their vegetables that always seem to be cooked just right. One of my new favorites is the Mediterranean peta tacos. Very tasty, cheap, filling and low fat and low calories. I eat here about once a week with either my mother who is 89 years old or my wife. They always take great care of my mother, so it is one of her favorites also."
Beth H.,"Vancouver, WA",63,2,,5.0,1/13/2016,"Food is always good. Especially like the cherry chipolte salmon!  Exceptional customer  service, never once had a grumpy server....although Kendall is the BEST!  Portions are large, prices are reasonable."
Glenda H.,"Beaverton, OR",23,114,1,2.0,10/31/2014,"I miss the huge backed potatoes, that used to be cooked to perfection at the Lloyd Center location.  Last time I had one....small and way over cooked at the Jantzen Beach location I was NOT impressed....rate 2.  The pookie was still the same and good."
kelly s.,"Portland, OR",31,325,18,3.0,5/21/2012,"A little embarrassed that I ended up here due to the fact that there must be no less than 6 better places to eat in a 2 mile radius, but I must say, BJ's was actually not as bad as I thought it would be.   For starters, the name leaves a lot to be desired.  Little piece of advice, if the name of your restaurant is a euphemism for fellatio, you might want to go back to the drawing board on that one.  On the other hand, Ceasar Salad and Clam Chowder were actually not too shabby.  The bartender did kind of butcher the process of making a whiskey and coke.  Went something like this: -pour booze into empty cup -dribble a couple of sad ice cubes in there -top with a butt load of semi-warm coke to fill glass =half iced, over coked, mess. To his credit though, he was friendly- and they have earned one of the higher slots on my ""Chowda Heads"" list of yummy Clam Chowders in town."
Paige L.,"Vancouver, WA",28,61,17,5.0,3/1/2014,"BJ's has never failed me. Great food, fantastic servers and their happy hour rocks! I suggest the avocado egg rolls and boneless buffalo wings. I also recommend the pulled pork sandwich if you're really hungry. I love it at this location! Also, if you like beers such as bud light, coors light, etc... they don't have those, so your best bet is to order their ""House Blonde"" beer. It's the lightest beer you'll get there and it tastes so similar to coors. They have the BEST cookie and ice cream desserts. If you've never been to BJ's, they have a warm cookie with ice cream on top and you have a choice of 4 different flavors, from what I remember. Honestly, ANYTHING you get at BJ's will be great."
John G.,"Portland, OR",0,8,,2.0,2/17/2014,"Two stars, entirely due to the nice atmosphere.  Especially if you have a large group, you will have adequate space and seating in a large, open and clean, sportsbar type setting.  Now as for the food - ughhh - it is like eating from the frozen food section of the local supermarket.   The pizza is pretty bland - you can almost taste the cardboard.   If you think this is good pizza (as some on yelp have said) then you don't know what real pizza is.   And as others have hinted, you can bet those chicken wings are 100% pure pink slime shaped just the way you like 'em.   Beer is not bad but nothing special - and WAY overpriced."
Michael R.,"Cazenovia, NY",151,704,212,4.0,7/14/2010,"I just had lunch at BJ's sitting at the bar. The bartender, Courney O, was fantastic! Very friendly, fast and personable all while running the entire bar and lounge area. Courtney gets 5 stars all the way!!! I had the tomato soup and grilled ham & cheese. The soup was great but the sandwich could've been a little warmer when it arrived. All in all I enjoyed my experience although it is a typical big name chain kind of food so nothing too special."
Andy C.,"American Fork, UT",74,132,4,4.0,5/8/2014,"Hostess was rude... not happy that I came in 5 minutes before close. Server named Rachel was gracious and attentive. Food was pretty good. Too much dressing on the house salad and the angel hair stuck together, but the flavors were good. Atmosphere would be great when they are busy. Televisions are everywhere and music was just right."
Kelly M.,"Charlotte, NC",14,272,23,3.0,2/3/2014,"We were staying at a hotel nearby and decided to give this place a shot when we saw the words 'brewhouse'. I was disappointed to find it to taste and appear exactly like every other chain restaurant. We had the avocado rolls for an appetizer which were ok but you couldn't taste anything but the avocado. We tried the calamari which was possibly the worst I have ever had, it seemed to me just frozen and reheated. We also tried one of the pizzas which was incredibly small but ok. It was the  best thing we ate but nothing to write home about. The hostess was really sweet."
dan e.,"Novato, CA",0,16,2,3.0,2/27/2014,"My go to place for beer and decent food. Travel up and down West coast and have eaten at many BJ's.  Usually very consistent service, atmosphere, and good food. Ahi salad and steak salad are two favorites! Best Bloody Mary's ever! Love the Nutty  Brewnette beer! After driving 10 hours to Portland I went to BJ's because I knew what to expect! Almost right. Atmosphere and food good but service sucked. It was slow in the bar area and our server Lauren S. was unpleasant from the minute we sat down. She wasn't as unfriendly to my teenage daughter but after taking our order hardly spoke a word to me again. I wanted another beer but Lauren didn't reappear until I'd finished my shrimp lettuce wraps (great!). Disappointed, especially since the other waitresses seemed very friendly. Luck of the draw I guess.  Ate at BJ's San Rafael, CA today and had a exceptional  food (pull pork sliders) and service. Corporate... Do you read these reviews? Time to retrain Lauren S."
Erik B.,"Kenton, Portland, OR",2,11,,5.0,7/20/2014,"I am basing this review solely on my experiences ordering delivery through Delivered Dish. Bjs is one of the cheapest delivery fee restaurants that delivered dish offers, but my food has always been exceptional. On this occasion I  ordered a full rack of ribs, a Caesar salad and a side of potato wedges (I was nursing a wicked hangover). The food showed up beautifully packaged and was everything I was hoping for and more! The ribs were fall off the bone delicious. It cost around 28 dollars because I had a $5 coupon. With the quality of food received and large quantity I would gladly pay that again! Oh, and I also received a large scoop of DELICIOUS mashed potatoes that I hadn't ordered or expected. 5 stars all the way!! Thanks!"
David H.,"Vancouver, WA",15,20,2,3.0,5/31/2014,"Used to love this place but tonight was likely the last visit for us.  Food was mediocre at best, service decent, sat in the bar and the had children seated next to us.  When they say open seating in the bar, there is some conventional understanding in the adult world that is there will be no children there. At BJ's this is not the case.  We will enjoy spending our money in the company of adults."
Tina E.,"Portland, OR",8,6,,1.0,8/13/2014,"So disappointed - we walked in and there was a strong odor of wet dog, mentioned it to manager who just shrugged his shoulders and said it was carpet.  We couldn't even make it thru our full meal, the place smelled so bad - paid check and left. Really sad when mgmt doesn't care about obvious issues like this - whatever cleaners they are using, use dirty, foul water."
Bettina B.,"Auburn, WA",11,178,2,3.0,9/4/2012,"First of all their Happy Hour goes til 7 which was perfect for us.  Avacado Egg rolls are a must when I frequent any BJ's. The happy hour was good, got a mini pizza for $5 off. So thats what we got, I had the buffalo chicken pizza, it was ok. The pizza dough itself was AMAZING!! Nice and Fluffy!! Next time I will go for a regular pepperoni pizza. I get the Nutty Brewnett beer every time. I love it Service was kind of slow, and didnt seem that busy. But all in all it was a good time."
Mega B.,"Portland, OR",2,52,8,1.0,10/31/2013,"Worst BJ's location. Seriously, skip it. I've been to numerous other locations in other states and this is by far the worst of the worst. Salad was wilted and lettuce was see through, pizza came out cold (???), hardly any cheese, no sauce. Waste of time, waste of money."
Mike R.,"Olympia, WA",14,39,4,5.0,3/19/2012,"I don't give 5 stars for just anyone, but this was one of the better places I have eaten since coming out here from the Midwest. Great white mini pizza (chicken) and a combo mini pizza. Great flavor, could go a little lighter on the tomatoes but it is easy to pull a couple off. And for desert, triple chocolate pizookie. Warm chocolate brownie, chocolate ice cream, and Gherideli chocolate, as a big chocolate fan, I was in heaven. Happy hour half price mini pizzas allowed me to experiment with the flavors, saw a variety of food go by that I really wanted to reach out and sample. I will be back. My wife had the vegi calzone (you don't see this on the menu very often) and said it was good, and loved her white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. I go on, but basically if you near one of these, you need to give them a try, excellent variety on the menu, and great prices. On the drinks, good beer selection and my wife said her Bloody Mary was very good, and probably a little stronger than she gets at most places."
Denise D.,"Seattle, WA",0,93,,4.0,9/21/2014,"After eating at the Southcenter BJ's in Tukwila, I was hesitant about trying another BJ's. Well I'm glad we did. This place was great. The food was good, the service was good and any time I see a manager running his buns off to clean a table or to support his workers, I appreciate it. We had the turkey pesto sandwich, turkey bacon sandwich, lemon chicken, chicken fingers and grilled chicken pasta. All of it with the exception of the grilled chicken pasta was outstanding. With the amount of people that were in this place, it was really great how our waitress kept up on making sure that we had drinks that were refilled and that we had everything that we needed. Two of our party ordered the pazoolie's and they loved them. We were tired from attending a convention and it was so nice to find this place and that it was worth it. Good job here."
Scott S.,"Livonia, MI",29,106,,3.0,11/1/2012,"Pretty good overall. Frankly, the beer was better than the food, but still pretty good. The building appears to be a conversion of some ""chain"" type of restaurant, maybe a Big Boy or something...kind of makes the dining area a bit disjointed. Chicken noodle soup was very good. Fish tacos were simply so-so. Lacked any real flavor and appeared on the menu because they were expected rather than something the restaurant took any real pride in. The highlight of the evening was actually the tap selections...very good. I'd go back, but would prefer to eat at the Stanford's across the street and come here for the pours."
