Chris R.,"Auburn, WA",5,7,3,5.0,1/10/2013,"Been here several times on business and have always been impressed with the staff. Food is always great. Courtney in the bar knows her stuff and I can tell she is a real asset to this establishment.  I really wish they had WiFi here though. Other than that, highly recommend!"
Gracie C.,"Vancouver, WA",163,144,79,4.0,7/13/2012,"I actually love this place! My food is 99% of the time GREAT! I did go late night once and my pizza was a bit chewy but out of 20+ times going, that's not bad. I just recently discovered that they have a low call menu called the ""Enlighten Menu."" OMG, can you say tasty? Great choices where you just feel you are being so naughty. I have tried the veggie pizza on whole wheat crust, the chicken fresca, and most recently, Talapia. These dishes are very flavorful. Why 4 stars vs 5? I feel they can work on their service. I have had pretty good service but when you get a bad one, it ruins it for the rest. I definitely recommend this place. OH, BTW, BEER LOVERS (on diets).... ...they have a low call beer...and it's not Bud Lite or Coors Lite! I think it's called LightSwitch. It's really good!"
Brandy C.,"Vancouver, WA",125,5,1,3.0,5/3/2014,"I'm really glad this place is here. There are not many viable choices In the Jantzen Beach area.   I had a disappointing experience here with my son. It was just the 2 of us and we had to ask for a server to help us. Not amazing. This place is definitely geared for large parties, and as a twosome we weren't getting a lot of love.   We did get someone's attention, and they worked to make our experience better, so I give them props for that.  I had the Thai chicken salad and for a chain restaurant it was quite good.  Jack, a very kind and concientious server worked hard to make our experience better.  Again, glad that this place is here. Thankful for a decent meal in the Jantzen Beach area, and shout out to employees like Jack who work hard to make a difference."
John G.,"Jackson, WY",28,11,2,4.0,2/12/2014,"On an impromptu trip to Portland, we stopped and had dinner at BJ's. I choose the Southern Fried Chicken. Not bad at all. The chicken was cooked in the southern tradition and it was damn good but the mashed potatoes tasted as if the came from the box. The portions were average while the prices were slightly above average. Other members in my party had the Pasta Alfredo, she stated the pasta was slightly above average but the Alfredo Sauce tasted as ID was out a can or jar. Another member of the party had Crusted Chicken Parmesan and she stated it was to die for. All and all 3.5 to 4 stars."
Maggie A.,"Portland, OR",121,38,,5.0,4/6/2014,"The pizookie. Oh, the pizookie. I've had a couple different sandwiches, a few beers, and a few pizookies (a warm deep-dish cookie with ice cream) and everything was really good. But those pizookies call to me."
Rob G.,"North Saanich, Canada",0,9,2,4.0,8/9/2014,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant after reading many of the reviews.  The pizzas were enjoyed by all in our party and the service was very good.  An ""off the menu"" request was handled with no problems and was accommodated nicely.  I particularly enjoyed the seasonal IPA.  If, like us you are staying on Jantzen island then this is the place to go !!"
Stella R.,"Kirkland, WA",9,59,,4.0,6/30/2012,"Really nice and quick service. The waitress wasted no time with taking all the orders are getting them out really quickly. They have really good Ceasar salad and fantastic root beer that they brew themselves. The fries could either be ordered thin, which were soft and a bit crispy, or thick and wedged. The sandwich I had was good, but lacked the flavor that I expected for all of what was in it. All in all, it's a really great place to come and stop by if you're in the Portland area. Good service, pretty good food, and the place just looks amazing."
Chris T.,"Vancouver, WA",0,3,,5.0,8/2/2014,"I came in today for lunch with a friend. We took awhile to order because I was picking up lunch for the new mother of my child. The waiter was very professional, keeping the bar area extremely presentable and clean. We spoke briefly and he suggested a time frame in which would be best for a to go order. Five stars for excellent customer service from Kirk, as well as the team he works with."
Clare M.,"Milwaukie, OR",104,168,23,2.0,6/10/2011,"I used to LOVE BJ's....before I moved to Portland.  BJ's is the closest thing Houston has to a brewpub...and it was actually one of my favorite restaurants for that reason...great micros, solid food and consistency. Then, we come to Portland, which is the Mecca of micro breweries, and all the breweries here also have tons of great food.  There were other non chain breweries in Houston, but they didn't operate as brewpubs and were set up mainly for tours with samplings of their beers and that was it.   I actually did visit the BJs in Jantzen Beach, and it was a very subpar experience.  The beer was very flat...the waiter questioned me like maybe I didn't know what I was talking about, but I sent back for another type of beer.  This was also flat.  Then I got to thinking that maybe the lines were dirty or something.  It just tasted bad.  I am familiar with nutty brunette and Jeremiah red, and loved them back in Houston but they both tasted really off and flat. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about.  I got my standard parmasean crusted chicken and it was just ok.  I personally think BJs might not do so well here because of all the great local brewpubs, which makes me a little sad because I used to really love it.  I probably won't go back to this BJs but I will most likely visit one when I return to visit Houston!"
Kristina A.,"Vancouver, WA",5,56,12,5.0,5/24/2014,Our favorite spot close to home! Have been happy with EVERYTHING we've tried. Can't beat their pizza and beer!
Gillian M.,"Portland, OR",0,1,,3.0,7/18/2014,"This is my first review. The service at BJ's at Jantzen Beach prompted me to write this review. We came in on a Thursday night as a group of 7, three kids and four adults. They said it would be a minute, which turned into more than five. They were busy taking phone orders and seemed to forget about us.  When they finally seated is, it was at a small table and we all squished in together.  So we order. The server didn't even ask us about the salad that was supposed to come with our meals, I figured she'd just bring them. Salads never came. My friends soup bowl never came, nor did the veggies that were to go along with my son's kids meal. We didn't even bother about the salads at that point. The server said they had to make the soup, which is why it was late. Odd. must have been some sort of can or boxed soup.   After the server brought the check and took the card, she never came back. We waited almost 15 minutes for someone to walk by and notice us. We needed Togo boxes.  While the food was okay-- the beers were good, but the missing food and lack of apologetics makes me give this a three stars.  Additionally, the table next to us had their appetizer come out well after their dinner, and there was an obviously very intoxicated woman at a table a few away and she kept getting served drink after drink."
Joe B.,"University Place, WA",8,165,37,3.0,6/7/2013,"Had a Mediterranean pizza, deep dish. It had really awesome flavor and lots of toppings. Beer selection is kind of lame and they don't actually brew it there, so their name is kind of misleading.   I'd go again, but wouldn't go out of my way."
Susan R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,3.0,7/13/2014,"The food was ok, or server was less than stellar. A hostess was seating people with a cup of Starbucks in her hand. And beware of the phone app checkout, it automatically adds an 18% tip after you sign and click done!"
Stephanie H.,"Seattle, WA",82,178,21,3.0,8/25/2013,"This place is freezing cold. Make sure you bring a jacket I have been shivering all through lunch. Honestly all I could remember about this experience was how cold I was the entire time, and not just me other people were complaining so much that the poor server could only respond with, ""im sooooorrrrrry I knooowwww"". I got the AYCE soup and salad special and enjoyed the presentation that came with the tortilla soup. Id go to another BJ's but not this one again."
David S.,"Portland, OR",33,34,1,4.0,3/16/2014,A bit of a wait even at 5pm but once seated the service and food was great. My son loved the fish and chips and the black and blue house burger was very tasty. Parking can be a bit tough.
Laura M.,"Portland, OR",0,3,,1.0,3/2/2014,"I ordered two pizzas online for pick up.  The photo of their pizza looked great for their hand tossed pizza.  When I picked up the order I actually stopped and opened the boxes because they felt so light I was afraid they had forgotten to put the 32.00's worth of pizza in the boxes.  Thin, dry, terrible pizza.  Never again.  I should have gone back and complained right then but I was late for the party I was bringing them to.  Everyone went home hungry!"
V K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,14,1,2.0,12/23/2013,"It's nice that happy hour is extended until the football game ends. I would have been upset if I would have paid full price for the food we received otherwise. We ordered boneless wings in both buffalo and Parmesan garlic, the pot stickers and a chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza. One word would describe all ""bland"". Service was great so that's why they are getting 2 stars."
Jenna P.,"Portland, OR",0,13,,3.0,3/30/2015,"I've been here a few times and have never gotten that meal that makes me order it over and over again.  I recently went there, pregnant and craving the Avocado Eggrolls.  They were pretty good, but WAY too spicy and nothing like I remembered.  I was very disappointed."
Mike G.,"Vancouver, WA",24,51,111,4.0,1/21/2011,"Tasty sandwiches and pizza, great lunch specials & a nice selection of home brews. Food suggestions: Sandwiches, Pizza  Beer suggestion: Nutty Brewnette"
Tommy B.,"La Center, WA",0,18,1,3.0,1/3/2015,"I have eaten at quite a few BJ's as they are my go to place for casual lunch meetings because of the wide variety of offerings.  This location continually disappoints, the service is great but the food is not to par of the other locations"
