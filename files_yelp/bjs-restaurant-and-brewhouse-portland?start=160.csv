Quisha F.,"Great Lakes, IL",175,198,406,5.0,4/9/2013,"Best pizza around! Good drinks that get the job done! I have always had excellent service here every time in the restaurant area & bar. This is probably one of the best chain restaurants around! I've been to them all around the North West & same constancy at each one! I love coming here for my Birthday dinner. You can get some good drinks, order a pizza for yourself, then go out for the night, come back home drunk, & you have the rest of your pizza to eat!!"
Justin K.,"Vancouver, WA",8,1,,2.0,9/21/2013,"2nd time we have walked out because of bad service. Waited 10 minutes after asking for water and nothing came. Way more expensive than it needs to be, especially for crappy service!!!"
Jaime L.,"Hillsboro, OR",33,58,88,3.0,2/2/2011,The two and only two reason I go here.  1. The Berry Burst Cider is so tasty and very refreshing. I often find myself craving it  2. Tex-mex spring rolls they are indescribably good. A must try for sure.   They are known for their pizza but I have tried it several times not my favorite and to be honest I try and avoid the pizza there are several delicious over priced pizza places that are heck of a lot better!
Joe Q.,"Lincoln City, OR",5,2,1,4.0,6/11/2013,First time here and the food was great.  Had a brown ale that was super.  The service was good and prompt.  We had stuffed mushrooms that tasted like little pizzas.  We will be in Portland for a week and will come back before we head home.
Artie E.,"Scappoose, OR",2,4,9,4.0,9/30/2012,"I love their whiskey stout cask beer... it's a dark beer with a bite!  Great food selection, too.  I usually have the jambalaya; it's pretty spicy with lots of Cajun seasoning.   They could probably skip the extra dose of Cajun to tone it down a bit, but I still like it either way.   This place is very kid friendly. The children's menu lets the kids customize their own meals. We have to drive from the Westside of Portland to get here, but it's definitely worth battling the traffic to go here. As you can probably imagine, I can't wait for them to open their Restaurant & Brewhouse in Hillsboro this Fall!"
Andrea B.,"Portland, OR",173,92,27,5.0,12/16/2012,"There are so many different options at BJ's! Of course the pizza and pazooki are amazing. One of my friends works here though so I've had the opportunity to try many other items on the menu. The Clam Chowder bowl is soooo good! I also enjoy the fire roasted chips and salsa. They have wonderful pasta, and their alcoholic cider is to die for! This is a great place to come for a date or with family. It isn't too loud, the service is great, and the prices are great too. Be sure to get their (free) rewards card because every time you spend money, it adds up and you get free items like drinks and desserts once you've spent $100."
Jarrod S.,"Portland, OR",162,219,66,3.0,3/20/2010,"So here goes a bizzarre review. Was here last may. Some memories, good, some not so much.  Pizza good, pricey as hell for a personal pizza, but damn good.  Beer...decent, I tried several, all were served too cold for taste to really really matter, you could probably order by color. Experience. ...waiter was overly attentive and made for several awkward situations of go away but your doing a decent job.  No marks against this, people get new jobs, things happen, kudos for the effort and the genuine try. The birthday party next to me got me the hell out, and this is not a knock on the restaraunt but the skinhead version of a birthday party was a bit distracting.  Price was too high, service was dicey buy nice, quality was almost there.  This was my first time at this chain and I may give it another go, preferably on a day with the third reich is at denny's."
Allison D.,"Portland, OR",1,28,3,5.0,1/26/2008,"I love the pasta and pizzas served here, they also brew their own Root Beer! (Which is nothing spectacular) The place is divided into 2 areas, one for casual dining and the other is a bar with TVs. Prices are typical of what you would pay for this type of establishment. And yes this place has a  full bar with tons of mirco brews on tap. Yes happy hour exists here. They also have a private room for special occasions. And you get a view of Dennys and the Shopping Center across the street. And you have to save room for desert and try the PIZOOKIE! Don't ask questions, just eat it!"
Barbara V.,"Harrisburg, PA",43,168,,4.0,8/29/2012,Has the Thai chicken salad and tomato bisque. Salad was very good with just enough spice (heat) to be interesting. Soup was divine!!! Good service. Have had the pizza before and liked it along with the avocado eggrolls (different).  Huge menu will satisfy large group.  Great happy hour specials on drinks and food ($5 pizza).
Julie M.,"Portland, OR",287,194,433,3.0,1/26/2008,"Decent food,  and if you are a micro-brew afficianado  you'll be happy here.  Award-winning brews - and really big dark beers.   The Company is shuffling things this winter, and Vasilios, an energetic and award-winning Brewer may be available for hire...Let's help keep him in the Brewing industry in Portland. Tell a BrewMaster you know to contact him quick!"
William G.,"Sedro-Woolley, WA",2,26,7,4.0,3/3/2011,"OK, this is a chain microbrewery, but I really liked their beer! Whiskey cask aged Imperial Stout, unique stout flavor, without being cloying or watery. This is SO much better than (cough)McMenamin's thin offerings. I ad the Santa Fe salad, which was the best I've ever had. Todd was a GREAT server!! We'll be back for more, believe me."
Given B.,"Vancouver, WA",135,12,,5.0,8/29/2013,"Friendly service, great food, wonderful dining experience, and reasonable prices. Definitely will be going back"
Kelly O.,"Portland, OR",4,55,,2.0,11/20/2012,"It was ok-ish... Food was bland, service was sucky, the server dropped my food, and not even two minutes later she dropped my check, making it pretty obvious I wasn't welcome. Not very friendly or personal. The only highlight was I got a huge sandwich and fries on the lunch menu plus an iced tea for less than 10 bucks."
Cynthia A.,"Alameda, CA",57,159,3,4.0,1/23/2010,"We were here two or three times within the past week with our friend. It wasn't nearly as great as the one in Roseville, CA, but it was good enough. However, sometimes the server just isn't as attentive as you think they'd be ... sigh. Which is why I took off a star. The food is as you'd think it is if you're used to eating from BJ's. It's yummy and at a great price!"
Jil S.,"Coquille, OR",97,137,26,5.0,7/31/2012,"FIrst time to Bj's..love it. Our food was excellent. A bit noisy, but it's a brewhouse, so that's to be expected I guess..lol. Great service. Really enjoyed it and plan to return next time we are in Portland."
Aimee L.,"Portland, OR",0,593,60,1.0,10/9/2013,"Gross.  Ordered (via Delivered Dish) the ""premium boneless wings"" and they are basically reheated frozen chicken nuggets. Actually, they were smaller than McDonald's mcnuggets - I am not kidding! Nasty. (And they gave us buffalo wings instead of bbq wings).  We also ordered the gluten free pizza and first, it's smaller than a medium pizza (D-Dish doesn't tell you that, just that it's costing you $14.50) you'd think with FIVE toppings it'd be covered in food but it was a scraping of tomato sauce and such sparse toppings you could see the bare crust.  Horrible horrible waste of money. Never again."
Annette G.,"Dublin, OH",0,23,6,2.0,7/20/2014,"The worst BJ's we have ever been to. We stopped here for lunch because we were familiar with two different BJ's where we live and this BJ's was awful. Hubby found a rock in his pizza!! and my ahe tuna salad was un-recognizable, consisting of rotting lettuce, stale cucumbers, and poor grade tuna. When you stop at a chain restaurant you think they're all going to be the same, this BJ's was definitely subpar."
Shep G.,"Bellevue, WA",50,406,39,3.0,2/28/2007,"Less than a block from I-5 this spot is easy to get to right off the exit/on-ramp. I liked the beer but the BBQ I had was not so great...maybe I should have read Maggies review and had a Calzone? I liked the beer, and the service was pretty good, although I was never asked if I wanted desert they just threw the bill on the table so I paid and left. Bottom line, good road food... THREE STARS"
Windy S.,"Portland, OR",150,369,85,4.0,8/25/2011,NFL ticket and all day Happy Hour on Sundays...
Mindy J.,"Vancouver, WA",24,11,,5.0,7/2/2011,"Amazing. My perfect meal; Spinach Artichoke Dip, BBQ Chicken Pizza, and a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie with their Root Beer. You can't go wrong with any of their specialty pizzas and you can't go to BJ's without indulging in one of their melt in your mouth delicious Pizookies. If you're not feeling like pizza, they make humungous salads and delectable burgers. I love this place."
