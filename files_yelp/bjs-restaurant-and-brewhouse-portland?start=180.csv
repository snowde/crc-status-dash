Karly W.,"Ellensburg, WA",43,16,,4.0,10/3/2011,"Perfect amount of sauce and toppings; the crust is buttery, chewy and crispy. Save room for a warm pizookie."
Holly M.,"Astoria, OR",46,139,,4.0,3/6/2009,"Okay, BJ's is a chain, but it definitely gets points in my book. They may have ""sold out"" to the chain concept, but their food is good, their beer is good, and their atmosphere is way better than any other national chain sellout (I'm looking at you, Red Robin!). Their beer is decent, and their selection rotates, which is good. Their pizza is good, and so (oddly enough), is their fettuccine alfredo!"
Warren C.,"Portland, OR",115,221,5,2.0,8/15/2011,"BJ's has never really ever been something for me to ever write home about but my friend Genell was insistent on coming over here for a meal this evening.  As we arrived to the restaurant we chose to be seated at the bar and was immediately greeted by Lindey our server/bartender. We started off with a couple of appetizers which were the Calamari and the Ahi Poke and two peach margaritas.   First off the Margaritas were very tart and even my friend Genell which is a bartender agreed with me as well. Her suspicions was it might have been too much mix.  The Calamari was a bit dry and the oil it was cooked in needed to be replaced. I know from my experiences with my parents owning a restaurant that you need to leave some of the old oil to give fried food some of the color needed when things are fried. The coating tasted burnt. This comes with either Marinara or a Lemon Garlic Aoli. The marinara did not go well with the Calamari and the Aoli was really just ranch. The Ahi Poke was really good considering this was made by mainlanders! The Ahi was tender to the touch and they did not skimp and buy cheap Tuna. This was mixed with avocado's and served with won ton chips which really looked more like tortilla chips to be honest with you. After finishing these two orders we couldn't really decide what to have for the meal so we decided to continue going with appetizers and ordered the Bruschetta and a Tomato and Mozzarella salad which is basically a Caprese salad.  The Bruschetta was good but there was one thing that seemed to make this appetizer a bit difficult. It was the size of the foccacia bread. The slices were literally an 1 1/4 inch thick. I joked with Genell that they sliced up texas toast because they were out of foccacia.  The tomato mixture was really good and the pesto vinagrette accented the flavors really well. As for the Tomato and Mozzarella salad. Everything was very fresh. The Mozzarella was very tender but diced up in cubes as opposed to the traditional slices. The basil was very fresh and opened up your palate to an array of other flavors. I would definitely order the salad again.  Overall, I wasn't really impressed but I wasn't disappointed either. Our bartender was very attentive and asked us at one point how everything was and I thought it was fair that I at least speak out about the qaulity of our appetizers. She paid attention and listened to what I had to say. We even had a manager come up and ask us what we felt was wrong. I made it clear to the manager that I did not want to be comped but wanted them to be aware of the mistakes that were made. He was very friendly and apologized for the mistakes.  The total to the bill came out to almost 60 bucks. This is for four appetizers, two margaritas, two glasses of wine and a cup of coffee. It seemed a bit steep but I think it was more the sting of the mistakes that were made that left a sour taste in my mouth.  I wouldn't steer anyone away from this place but I will say not to expect a whole lot either. For the money I would of rather gone somewhere else. I want to give you 3 stars but I can't morally justify it after my experience."
vi a.,"Vancouver, WA",2,107,,3.0,3/25/2012,"First visit to this restaurant is a three star. We ordered pizza and thought it was okay.. but everything we ordered, the fries was the highlight of the night... It was different in a good way... but downside, waiter was a lil on refilling drinks..."
Jim A.,"Sherwood, OR",113,175,132,5.0,10/15/2008,"Why did they close the BJ's over by the LC (Loyd Center)?!?! I LOVE BJ's but the trek up I-5 scares me. I can't put my finger on what make their pizza so good, but they are. Maybe is the ass load of cheese they use? My only problem is my hatred for unprocessed tomatoes, and they put them on nearly every pizza, but one could always just ask for no tomatoes. They really know how to take care of their customers here. We had a long wait for our pie once, then it came out with the wrong stuff on it. The waitress ordered us a new one, and about 2 minutes later the manger came by and took the pie off our tab. He didn't have to do that, but I was appreciative. He went way above and beyond to correct things. The root beer that they brew here is GREAT! The great food, root beer, and service is well worth the agitating I-5 rush hour drive."
Kalon W.,"Vancouver, WA",116,126,141,5.0,8/7/2011,"Great food, Great service.  Try the pizza or chicken wings!"
Krista T.,"Vancouver, WA",8,6,,3.0,3/12/2010,"Co-worker convinced me to go to BJ's today. The name sounds a lot more exciting than this chain actually is. Food is okay...about the same level as a Red Robin.  I had soup and salad and shared an appetizer.  I'm not sure how this ended up being more than $20 with a tip.   Service was good.  Our waiter was a lot more attentive than others I've had here.  But it was also slower today than normal. Nothing special, but nothing bad."
Alan W.,"Portland, OR",3,1,,3.0,1/25/2015,"DW and I thought it would be a nice idea to grab a pizza and a salad, then head down to the dock and eat them on our small boat.   I used a YELP search to find out that there was a BJ's Pizza on Hayden Island - perfect.   This was on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed - not just a few extra people, but hoards of people waiting for a table.  This must be a testament to BJ's fine food.  We quickly settled on a Margherita Fresca pizza, a Golden Beet and Arugula salad, and the crispy Calamari - all from the take out menu.   Our order was taken immediately, but took 25 minutes to arrive, which is not surprising considering that it was apparently Prime Time for food at BJ's.   The take out bag full of food was a light as a feather - even with all the packing boxes, napkins and plastic cutlery.   Turns out, this really was a lunch just barely good enough for one person, and we are not 'big eaters'.   With a tip, this lunch cost 25 bucks.   The salad was small but delicious.  The crispy Calamari was also very good, as were the two dipping sauces that came with the dish.   The pizza was unimpressive and as far from Italy as you can get.  Turns out, we had unwittingly ordered the 'appetizer pizza.'    Sadly, there wouldn't be any leftovers for lunch the next day.   When I go to BJ's again, I will set my expectations for good food, small servings and high prices."
Ziyad A.,"Portland, OR",16,72,10,3.0,9/4/2011,"BJ's is an average American restaurant. Their deep dish pizzas are good. The appetizers are really delicious with good portions. What is really special about that restaurant is their dessert. I usually go there for dessert. They have an oven baked cookie (Pizookie). It served hot topped with a vanilla ice cream. I prefer it with a glass of cold milk. But it's a must. I am not a big fan of sweets, but I love their PIZOOKIES !"
Ruthie S.,"Bellingham, WA",3,82,1,2.0,8/12/2011,"wah wah. Not sure what the hype is all about... for a brewhouse, their beer kinda lacks. Food was ""eh"" atmosphere was double ""eh"""
Jon W.,"Ellensburg, WA",19,12,,4.0,10/1/2011,"BJ's pizza has the great combo of fluffy buttery crust and the right combo of ingredient to sauce ratio.  The pizooki's there are awesome too.  Not a gourmet thin crust, but just really good old fashioned american pizza!"
Stanley T.,"Portland, OR",193,289,9,2.0,4/8/2008,"Two stars might be generous. Service was ho hum. The hostess pretty much ignored us in favor of the phone in her ear (no talking going on - on hold?) then finally deigned to seat us. Our waitress forgot part of our order and we had to run around to find someone. On our way out the same hostess couldn't tear herself away from her magazine to acknowledge our presence with a thank you or have a nice afternoon. Oh well, I'll get over it. The food was less than ho hum. shrimp tacos were a pretty bland filling inside of dried out tortillas. the lime wedge accompaniment was so dry  I could have used vice grips to get a few drops of juice. The little bowl of red salsa was mediocre - the little bowl of green stuff (allegedly guacamole?) was pretty disgusting. The sliders (four tiny hamburgers) were dried out overdone patties with sad lettuce and tomato garnishes. The beer (brown ale and oatmeal stout) was a little better but nothing to write home about. Two stars cuz I gotta save that one star rank for the really horrible."
Mary J.,"Scotts Valley, CA",6,186,1,4.0,2/24/2013,"Above average.  We usually go in a group of 6-10 peoplw, ans I think they do a good job for as many of us as there are.  They are also OK with separate checks.  We don't ask for one for each person!  The food's moderately priced, and above average.  There is usually a wait for a table on weekends (when we go), but it's scarey if a restaurant isn't busy on a Saturday night!"
Ashlee H.,"Portland, OR",57,106,6,3.0,12/19/2008,"As far as chains go, BJ's is pretty solid. The pan pizzas are tasty (the buffalo chicken one is my favorite) and they have a really good lunch special where you get a small one-topping pan pizza and a salad. The BBQ ranch dressing is yummy. If you don't drink much (I realize I am probably getting much lulz for that statement in Portland), try the root beer. It's excellent."
Jenny C.,"Portland, OR",146,355,66,4.0,1/5/2008,"I'm convinced Janzen Beach is some crafty black hole disguised as a not quite urban - not quite suburban commercial center determined to suck you off of I-5 and then make it impossible to figure out how to get back on.  That being said - at least there are some good restaurants, BJ's being one of them.   I've only had pizza and salads here, but they're routinely good.  Service is prompt, with the longest wait usually being for a table.   Also, there's a quote on the wall by Ben Franklin that says ""Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.""   Who can argue with that?"
Courtney D.,"Portland, OR",24,311,108,4.0,3/1/2007,"Big, stuffed potatoes rival tasty pizza If you're looking for a place to watch a game and nibble on some tasty pizza and the biggest stuffed potatoes you'll ever lay your eyes on, then this is the joint for you.  These potatoes are a meal in itself, which you can stuff with any topping you can imagine. If they're not your thing, order one of their pizzas or calzones. You can't go wrong with the BBQ chicken pizza, especially if you're a cilantro and hickory sauce fan. Whichever entree you pick, make sure you leave room for dessert. Their fresh out-of-the-oven big cookie with ice cream is to die for and a definite must.  Tip: Great spot to go after a day of shopping at Jantzen Beach."
Heather E.,"Sierra Madre, CA",99,35,,4.0,11/13/2012,Really nice place I love the food and it's cheap staff was ok. They need to change their hours online since i am pretty sure they are wrong.
Jamie R.,"Snohomish, WA",236,643,1271,4.0,5/28/2010,"Yippe, there is one in Seattle now! South Center Mall. Not quite as good as others but still worthy! I heart the avocado egg rolls and don't leave w/out trying a pazookie! What is a pazookie you say? I warm giant cookie cooked in it's own pan w/ice cream on top!!!!!!"
C. J.,"Portland, OR",0,150,4,4.0,9/15/2012,"Pretty good food.  Not the best we've ever had, but they're okay."
K N.,"Portland, OR",0,21,,5.0,4/29/2011,"It may not be snobby Portland gourmet, but this is the place I pick for my birthday dinner every year. I love the spinach and artichoke pizza, the home brewed root beer. Here's why you should come here on your birthday: you get a free pizzokie (a cookie the size of a mini pizza hot out of the oven with ice cream)!!! Great place after some shopping at Jantzen Beach."
