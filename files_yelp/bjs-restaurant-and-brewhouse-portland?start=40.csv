Sarah S.,"San Jose, CA",87,502,57,2.0,7/29/2016,"Came here on Monday night at 8:00 and there were clearly some service issues. Our table ordered a salmon, regular pizza, and a bowl of soup and it took over 45 minutes for the food to come out. No explanation from our waitress and the place wasn't even packed. If there was an issue in the kitchen or if certain items could have come out sooner we would have appreciated some sort of communication. The pizza came out cold and the bottom was soft and not crispy.  The hostess kept on disappearing into the kitchen every few minutes which seemed odd and then he was the one who finally closed out our check since there was a long wait for the waitress to ever return. Even then I saw him show the bill to another staff member, chat, and then finally go to the back to close our account. Waitress didn't even notice when we left."
M. D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",4,39,32,4.0,2/4/2017,"Visiting from Hawaii, I asked my family to bring me to a deep dish pizza place. So we are here! We we're sitted right away and the ambience of the place is casual, laid back. We ordered calamari for appetizer and it was fabulous. Then when it comes to my turn I ordered the medium BJ's classic. Yummy. I was in hog heaven. I don't usually drink beer but what the heck, I ordered their blonde. A pizza without a beer is a crime! I think I ate about more than half of the pizza because it had a lot of toppings and they were fresh! I have to say that it is very similar to Pizza Hut's super supreme pan pizza. It wasn't a traditional deep dish pizza pie like Chicago's finest. I was slightly disappointed but in the end, because it was fresh and plentiful of toppings, I rate it 4 stars. Our server was great and for that, I gave him 20%. Try this place out because it has so my items on the menu."
Geghard A.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,5,,5.0,3/15/2017,"Had an amazing dinner, this cherry glazed salmon is something else! And if you aren't about that salmon then you gotta try the Parmesan crusted chicken! For real though! Our server, Rachel, was very kind and made sure our experience was nothing short of excellent. We will be back. Well done BJ's!"
James J.,"Camas, WA",19,28,3,2.0,6/18/2016,Came in to find an hour wait but we were told take-out would only be twenty minutes or so. After 30-40 minutes we received one of two orders and the other would just be another five minutes.  Twenty minutes later we received one warm pizza and two lukewarm items.  Plus one of the pizzas was made incorrectly. The pizza itself was acceptable but overpriced and underwhelming.  If I was forced to come back I wouldn't refuse but it sure won't be take-out and I won't be coming back of my own accord.
Eric E.,"Salem, OR",14,601,248,4.0,7/6/2016,"Came here late one night to get some dinner with a few kids I work with.  We were visiting Portland and they had a coupon of $10 off $35.  So we came here and got their pizza which I had never had before and got some Pizzookie's.  The pizza was really good and we all LOVED the pizzookie's.  Service was a tad slow but for as late as we were in there, they were quite busy."
Darya K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,15,5,4.0,8/16/2017,"This was probably my third or fourth time visiting BJ's and they have yet to disappoint. This time around I got the classic chicken sandwich which has fried chicken tomatoes lettuce and pickles. I was going to get their new Nashville chicken sandwich but I wasn't sure if I wanted something spicy at the time. I did however get there Nashville sauce on the side to dip my fries and sandwich into it and just to basically try it. The sandwich itself was very delicious, However it did not come with mayo and I thought that was kind of weird but my waitress, Mindy J, Was very attentive and tended to my needs promptly. The Nashville hot sauce which I believe was probably sour cream or mayo mixed with very good spices was the right level of spice...not anywhere near burning your insides...but also not so mild that it was bland. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience. Unfortunately bjs doesnt exist in Minnesota, so i will miss it when i move."
Kimiko F.,"Vancouver, WA",28,23,4,2.0,5/9/2016,"Came in for Mothers Day, expecting that all dining places would be busy... Unfortunately even expecting longer than normal service didn't prepare us for the 2 1/2 hour waiting game.  My mother in law wanted to dine here because of the Avocado rolls. Unfortunately they added spicy peppers or made them more predominant in the recipe because she could barely finish one.  The stuffed mushrooms were great (along with the monkey bread pizookie), but that is where our satisfaction ended.  First, either our server had been working a double or has incredibly short memory. The table next to us asked for a lime for a drink 3 times (after the initial drink order) before she actually brought it over.  We ordered appetizers, and no plates, napkins or utensils were brought till we asked for them.  My daughter ordered orange juice but it was too tart for her so we asked for another water... Over the next 2 hours, the waitress refilled our drinks, brought our food and never brought the water despite being asked no less than 6 times for another water to be brought to the table.  As a former waitress, I try to be understanding, but she seemed to be in lala land. We also were casually talking about birthing stories since I'm expecting my second child, and she chimes in with a 3 minute story about herself (and still forgot the water).  Admittedly, I asked for a modified menu item, so I was expecting an upcharge or possible confusion. I ordered a seared ahi salad, but since I don't like seared ahi but wanted the salad (which they don't sell on its own ala cart), I asked to substitute seared ahi for the poke. They brought out the salad with raw, unseasoned fish (fish cubes). Poke is a Japanese item that is popular in Hawai'i (where I'm from) that is traditionally sesame oil, soy sauce, sea salt, green onions and other flavors with raw ahi tune cubes.  The first time I sent it back, they brought it back supposedly coated in sauce. Tried a piece and was definitely still just raw fish no seasoning.  We asked for a manager and I explained that if the substitution was not possible I'd order something else. He took it back and actually had the ahi poke made according to the recipe for the appetizer (which is what I expected the first time).  The burgers that my husband and brother in law had were overcooked. And everything seemed priced $5-15 over other establishments that make better food.  Unfortunately, unless I'm craving stuffed mushrooms or monkey bread (Cinnabon is better), we will probably not be returning."
Clifford W.,"Daly City, CA",13,409,1024,3.0,5/30/2016,Ate dinner here. Free parking in lot outside. Baby back ribs and two sides. American food similar to other BJs that I have eaten at. Clam chowder was thick and salty because it was probably in heating tray too long and needed more water or cream. Service was prompt since we ate off hours. Happy hour available at 3pm so if you want just appetizer and drinks then sit in the bar area.
Ginny T.,"Portland, OR",0,13,,5.0,7/23/2017,Have eaten here numerous times over the past few years. Have always gotten good service and good food.
Shon J.,"Mesa, AZ",11,17,2,3.0,3/7/2016,"Food wasn't bad, i had the grilled ahi salad. It was funny because I was asked if I'd saved too for monkey bread, sort of defeats the whole eating healthy thing, right? Don't believe when they say 20% off with their app. I reserved a table with the app, I identified myself, mentioning I reserved with the app, saw placards on the table mentioning that reserving with the app is one of three ways to get a 20% discount,  tried paying with the app unsuccessfully, it said thrre were no orders in the system for me, but did I get the discount? Of course not. I don't complaine, not after mentioning it at least twice, I just never EVER go back. Now I'll uninstall the app. By the way, m a business traveler who eats out on business 30+ times per month. That's a lot of potential lost revenue."
Katinka R.,"Lynnwood, WA",8,173,,4.0,11/5/2016,"We found ourselves at BJ's for an uber-late dinner on a Friday night. I think we arrived at 9:30. The ideal booth they offered us was dirty and gross, so we were moved to a little table. They cleaned the booth, but we were served and ate at the table. This is the only reason to minus one star. Anywho... the service was wonderful, the food was wonderful. My daughter had the giant spaghetti and meatballs and loved it. My husband had the shrimp soft tacos and I had the Mediterranean soft tacos. the food was very healthy and fresh. I love their menu."
Jessica F.,"Vancouver, WA",20,2,,5.0,7/8/2016,I absolutely love this place! Every single dish is cooked to perfection. The sauces and glazes are unique and and wonderfully flavorful. My favorites are the Cherry Chipotle Salmon and the Parmesean Crusted Chicken in a lemon and white wine sauce. So much more than amazing pizza and their own brewed beer!
Liv V.,"Seattle, WA",98,19,5,1.0,8/28/2016,With my table there were only a total of 4 tables in here... All small groups. It shouldn't take an hour and ten minutes for the food to come out. We observed other tables getting mad and impatient about the service from both BOH and FOH. First time here and it was a disappointment .
Dave C.,"Camas, WA",213,116,9,4.0,3/23/2016,"Been here more times than I can count. Best pick of any of the Jantzen Beach food places and would hold its own most places. Food is good, solid offerings from a massive menu. Beer is pretty darn good. IMHO pick one of their higher ABV beers, they seem to excel with those styles. Servers are pretty efficient as this place can get crankin busy. Beats the hell out of Hooters on the other side of the hwy. Unless you are less interested in food."
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,5.0,11/29/2015,"Overall a decent value for the quality and portion size of food received. The location was very busy but after a short wait self seating tables were available in the bar section in the far back. The food was delivered in a quick fashion, drink refills were on spot and the server (Kyle) was friendly and personable. The menu variety is large allowing something for anyone in your group. Would recommend this location."
Mary Jane C.,"Torrance, CA",414,444,268,4.0,9/8/2015,"Came here for a large group.. was very pleased except when my first reservation was accidentally made a few days earlier.  Thank you to whomever called me to confirm my reservation and adjusted it accordingly.  We ended up ordering some appetizers early on with a smaller group then moved to a bigger group to order all our pies and pizookies.  Staff was super friendly and attentive, everything went great!"
Jay D.,"Newnan, GA",132,26,60,4.0,6/10/2016,"Basically ultimate bar food. Didn't try any of the beers but they do make an in house root beer that was really good and they provided unlimited refills. Staff was friendly and on point. For apps. we got calamari (delicious, crisp and moist) and chips and guacamole (really good). For my meal I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich that was really great the cheese was really good."
Matt C.,"Lindsay, CA",1,21,5,3.0,2/19/2017,"We went for lunch around 130pm on a Sunday. We waited for about 20 minutes for our table after making reservations before arriving. The service was very polite but extremely slow. We think our waitress was on break a couple times while we were sitting there waiting, cause she was no where to be found. I had to ask to have my drink refilled do to slow service. The appetizers came out at the same time our food did. The food was very good. They left the table next to us full of the dirty plates and glasses from the people who were sitting there for about 15 minutes. Then one person came and grabbed the plates, another person came and got the cups and cleaned the table half ass. Then the hostess had to come clean the table and seats because the 2nd person did a terrible job. So it took them 20 minutes to get that table ready for another group to sit down. There's definitely no rush to get people in or out of there. Needless to say we left a small tip. Hopefully they step up their game in the future."
Kristen K.,"Honolulu, HI",276,269,557,2.0,5/8/2014,"I guess this is a chain....we don't have these back home so I didn't know. The Jantzen Beach location was located nearby our hotel.  In terms of chain places, the menu reminded me of D&B. TONS to choose from, but not as tasty or good as Yardhouse or Cheesecake Factory.  We did try a few of their brewed beers though, and those were good! They have flavored teas and lemonades that have bottomless refills (which was a lifesaver since I'm spoiled by being used to ""Hawaii water"" and couldn't get over the chlorinated taste of the water everywhere else)  Service was fair. The food was forgettable. I don't even remember much of what our party ordered, come to think of it. But I do recall the deep-dish pizzas--just because they put special stands out on the table for the pans."
Robyn L.,"Portland, OR",0,13,79,1.0,7/2/2016,Worst food and service ever. Was so excited to meet my friends here but the food was horrible and the service even worst. We had to track someone down to be serviced and when we asked to sit in the bar they let us stand another 5 mins just to find out the bar was open seating. This place sucks period!
