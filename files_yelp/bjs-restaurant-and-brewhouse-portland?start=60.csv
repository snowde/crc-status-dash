Heather S.,"Portland, OR",75,62,1,2.0,5/20/2015,"It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night.  Our server was definitely stressed, as my sweet 10 year old son said ""I can see it in her eyes"".  I get the feeling that's pretty much the corporate norm there.  She handled it well and was friendly, but our service was sub-par. Food was ok.  We waited 45 minutes for our pizza, to which the manager came by and said ""I had them make you a bigger pizza"".  Appreciated, but not necessarily a solution.  My burger was good, but the lettuce, tomato set up was forgotten on my plate.  I was half way finished by the time I got it.  I did like the wedge salad, very fresh. Not really sure if I'd go back.  The overall vibe of the staff was super stressed and unhappy.  I saw one server be extremely rude to his unhappy customer.  Not a very relaxing experience unfortunately."
Sean G.,"Kingsford, MI",0,1,,2.0,5/23/2015,Food was mediocre at best. The waitress had attitude. I would not suggest this place at all.
Ranae H.,"Redmond, WA",3,17,16,3.0,9/14/2015,"Just visit the BJ's again with a friend. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, and soups with salads. The dip was good, but the chips were very thin and cover with salt. I had to brush salt off, it was crazy salty. The soup was good, and my waiter noticed that they forgot my bread bowl and immediately got me a new dish with the bread bowl. My friend really enjoyed her tortilla soup and my clam chowder was also very good. The salads were fine, but my friends ceasar was dowsed in dressing. Once again, BJs proved to be... just oK."
Angela N.,"Hillsboro, OR",23,28,9,4.0,5/25/2015,"I would go again.  Beer: average Price: a bit overpriced Service: great Club Sandwich: not great.  Fries: thin cut fries were the BEST -it would actually be a big factor in going back! And I'm not a big fry person! Ambiance: comfy, clean, casual, busy but plenty of seating."
Stuart D.,"Seattle, WA",389,5,1,3.0,7/8/2016,"Look I have given 3 stars for the customer service here. For me the food was very very average for the price. Normally I would give the place a 1 but they really did go above and beyond to make sure I was happy, so that's worth a lot in my book. Give them a try my experience could have just been a on off with the food."
Katy P.,"Manhattan, NY",77,71,32,5.0,3/16/2016,"Our server,  Payton, was attentive,  positive,  and a true rockstar at her job.  Our portions were enormous and delicious.  It was a great all around experience,  especially for this out of towner."
Morton M.,"Woodland, WA",0,1,,1.0,12/4/2016,I had reservations at 6:30 for a birthday dinner and didn't get seated 7:30 and I was treated very poorly  by my waitress and I will not be coming back for a second visit
Jamie C.,"Vancouver, WA",0,39,,2.0,4/5/2016,"Had the chicken lettuce  wraps tonight which were really off! I would not recommend. The service is cool though, you just call and place your order and then park in the curbside spot when you arrive. Call and tell them your there and they bring your food to you! Neat but still didn't make up for horrible lettuce wraps. Never again would I order that."
J R.,"Portland, OR",3,76,28,3.0,3/25/2016,"The service in the bar is great and the hostesses are great as well, I need to start this review off with that. The food is ok, the honey Brussel sprouts have way to much spicy sauce, and the Bloody Mary isn't good. Also, the root beer wings  were ok. The California flatbread is great. Most likely will not return, but apparently this place is busy usually, so that works out for them. We came because we had never been, and someone gave us a gift card. Nonetheless, I still tipped off of what our bill was , not after the gift card was taken, as I said before, the staff is great."
Michelle J.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,27,,4.0,10/11/2016,"I am in town for work and BJ's was close by. I ate lunch and dinner there on my first day in town. The food was excellent (lots of choices) and service was great... their beer even more amazing! I have traveled the world and don't always find the best options, particularly when you are unfamiliar with the area. So this was an unusual and great find. Very unassuming place."
Chad A.,"Portland, OR",208,507,5618,4.0,9/25/2013,"W side of N. Center N of N. Jantzen Street on Hayden Island I do not have a problem admitting my fanship to this Pizza Chain at all. I love their diverse and fairly expansive menu that offers food for all moods. I love their brewskies...now there's a shock...(Portlander who loves beer!) My favorites are the Jeremiah Red and the P.M. Porter, but I do enjoy most of them. I've come here both in California and the Portland location many times and mostly for their mini pizzas and to indulge on one of their famous and delicious Pizookies. Their pizzas are sort of a hybrid of what most are used to and a Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza right down to the Corn Meal infused sweeter crust. I love their inventiveness and creativity on some of them pies. If I have room I simply must cram down one of their famous Pizookies which is a choice of a large warm cookie with two scoops of creamy vanilla bean ice cream on top! My eyes roll in the back of my head with every bite. Oh oh back to the pizza. I find them filled with multiple textures and flavors that have my taste buds tingling and my soul warmed. This location is much smaller than what I'm used to, but still offers three types of seating: either booths, regular tables, or up at their bar. Decor is modern and clean and consistent with most other locations. Service has always been kind, patient, and informative which I can totally appreciate. I find their prices to be pretty reasonable for not only being a chain, but also for having such a large menu. There is plenty of parking, but close parking can still prove kind of challenging during busier periods! Their website is well laid out, easily navigable, and informative. I highly recommend checking it out whether you're a rookie or a seasoned pro of BJ's."
Sandra M.,"Portland, OR",13,19,,4.0,7/20/2015,"We decided on BJ'S this evening for dinner. We walked in and noticed that the wait staff are happy and energetic. I love the big high backed round booth we sat in. Made for good privacy since we were at the beginning of the dinner rush.  The menu is pretty massive so it took us a bit to take it all in before we ordered. My hubby and I ordered the same thing, which rarely happens. Both of us settled on a roast beef dip sammy. My 10 year old got chicken tenders and my 9year old had cheeseburger sliders. They both had a cookies and cream puzookie for dessert. Our energetic waitress (whos name escapes me ATM damn it I hate when I do that) was knowledgeable on the menu and super sweet. When our dinners arrived, they made kind of a big deal over it by having three of the wait staff bring it to our table and teasing our daughters over who got what which I thought was a sweet thing to do. My sandwich was piled high with moist and tender roast beef. It did have cheese and also some thin sliced caramelized onions and all came on a great baguette.  It also came with some herbed au jus and horseradish for dipping which had great flavor as well. Then some thick cut steak fries. I guess you can pick those or shoestring. Washed it all down with a glass of ice cold Dr. Pepper. My daughters had no complaints and love their puzookie dessert (a puzookie is a hot fresh baked cookie of your choice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dollop of flavored whipped cream). Next time we come here I will be indulging in one of those. The girls said they were awesome.  Overall it was a pretty good dining experience, from the happy wait staff all the way to dessert. Thanks to you we left happy, full and very satisfied!"
Mindy W.,"Republic, MO",0,9,13,4.0,3/21/2016,"Had dinner on Sunday night. The Red brew was very tasty and My dinner was good as well. Server Ryleigh was exceptional! Good, clean chain restaurant."
Ben H.,"Walpole, MA",22,22,12,5.0,10/17/2015,We recently ate at this restaurant.  It was an affordable choice and we enjoyed the selection of food and alcohol.  Our staff were incredibly accommodating to our large group and the need for separate checks.  I was particularly impressed with their positive attitude.  If you are staying in Jantzen Beach - I highly recommend it!
ILove Foo D.,"Vancouver, WA",11,95,17,3.0,12/16/2014,"Stopped in for an early dinner while doing some shopping and sat in the bar for happy hour. Small but nicely priced selection of happy hour drinks and food. You can't go wrong with a strawberry mojito for $5. The California flatbread was good, too. Their burgers have small patties which was a bummer. I was so happy to see that they serve clam chowder in a sourdough bowl - I have been searching for a good chowder and sourdough together. The clam chowder was really delicious with large tender pieces of clam that you can bite right through and aren't rubbery at all. They lightly toast the sourdough bowl which I liked. I can't say that it was the best sourdough but it was pretty darn decent.  BJ's offers a nice menu with a good selection. I'm thinking our next visit we will have to try their pizza since we enjoyed the flatbread so much. Also, our waitress was super sweet and helpful."
Kevin H.,"Battle Ground, WA",61,7,2,5.0,1/22/2016,"Great food. Roast beef sandwich and au jus was spot on. Fast service.  Tried out their online ordering, it was easy and they made it super fast even with a packed house on a friday night."
Blnde842 L.,"Lake Oswego, OR",11,215,28,5.0,11/13/2015,ATTENTION BAR MANAGER/MANAGER!!! Mindy in the bar Friday the 13th was amazing ! Please recognize her for great service!!! I love this location ! They have the best service and the bar is a cozy little spot but the restaurant itself is fairly large. I've had bad food here and they take back every time if you don't like it. They're rootbeer is amazing ! Multiple beers of their own on tap. Lots of food options and large portions. I have great food every time i come here. And it's open a little later. And a big reason I will continue to return was the service I got tonight. Keep it up guys !
Laura D.,"Portland, OR",0,43,,4.0,8/1/2016,"They had a good lighter calorie menu with a variety of options.  The pizookie is what we were truly there for, however, and as always, it was delicious.  Instead of getting the full sized one, we ordered kid's menu pizookies for each of us which were much more reasonably priced, and a great size for each individual to have their own.  The kid ones are only $2.50 each (which is a lot cheaper than getting their trio sampler, which is $10.75 for essentially three kid pizookies.)"
Brandi K.,"Vancouver, WA",143,489,758,5.0,7/22/2013,"I have been here a bajillion times and never once been disappointed! I think I may have had almost everything on their menu. The food is delicious, sometimes the prices are a little high, but always worth it. My recommendation is the cheeseburger pizza. You don't think you want pickles on a pizza until you devour this guy. Mmm. Always finish off with a pizookie!"
Nita R.,"Portland, OR",0,11,3,1.0,9/7/2015,"Ordered shrimp santa fe salad because I am a vegetarian.  After 5 bites I noticed lot's of chicken in my salad.  The server was not empathetic at all but the manager re made it ""to go""and took it off my bill.  My mental space was bad leaving since I am a vegetarian and i just ate from a plate with meat. :-("
