Laura M.,"Algonquin, IL",16,12,2,5.0,7/18/2016,"After a very trying day, we stopped by for take out. Brian the manager asked about my day and I told him about the ups and downs of the day. He just listened and really just wanted to end our day on a positive note. And he did. We will come back and enjoy this food again. Thanks Brian."
Tanya F.,"Portland, OR",1,8,8,4.0,2/9/2016,"Good meatballs at a good price for the kids or ala carte, and one of the lowest delivery fees on Delivered Dish. Open late and good take out option for N. Portland which doesn't have much."
Mary G.,"Arlington, TX",23,59,29,5.0,5/27/2015,One of my favorite restaurants.  The beer is good and so is the food. Service is always great as well.
Katherine L.,"Portland, OR",11,33,3,3.0,7/25/2014,"I have now been to Bj's five times since starting my new job about three weeks ago.  This is what I have experienced. The first time I ordered just a wedge salad.  Good service, salad was good.  So I decided to give them another shot. The second time, they put the tortilla soup toppings in an entree to go box making it very difficult to transport my food back to my office. The third time, their systems were down so they never received my order - but I had a receipt in my email for it. The fourth time they gave me someone else's entree salad on top of my order. The fifth time I ordered my usual soup and salad.  They asked if I wanted utensils, I said yes.  Should have checked before I left because all they gave me was a fork. I really do like their food, but not sure if their service can justify me coming back. The three stars are for the food only."
F Joe A.,"Vancouver, WA",1,27,,4.0,7/5/2016,"Have been here a few times in the last 4 months and always leave feeling I got my money's worth.  We've had their pizza, steak, fish entrees and pasta and have never been disappointed.  If you went to a place that specializes in those specific items then yes you can find better out there.  But if you're traveling it's very easy on-off from I-5, and if you have a few people that all want something different this is a great place to go.  We've also always had very attentive service from friendly folk who do seem to want you to have a pleasant experience.  The only time there was any kind of issue was when my steak was overdone.  A replacement cooked just right was at our table in a very short time.  They have a decent variety of beer that they brew themselves; I've enjoyed 4 different ones liking all of them especially the Stout; and oh yeah, those Pizookies are great."
Maylene K.,"Portland, OR",101,51,8,4.0,10/10/2014,"Met a friend for dinner here a while back and had a completely forgettable experience. Fast forward a couple years and Labor Day Monday saw every brunch place in a 5-mile radius with 1+ hour waits. Yeah, no. We had some errands to run nearby and ended up here on a whim. What a happy accident. The lunch specials here are fantastic, and the thick crust pizza is the best thick crust in town (there, I said it!). We've been back a few times and can confirm the excellent lounge service, food, and dark beer. Easily recommend for lunch."
Greg M.,"Portland, OR",6,8,1,1.0,5/22/2015,"Not much of a brewhouse.  I asked for 7 different beers from their import/craft bottle list and was told ""they were out.""  Of each one of them, all beers listed in their menu.  They were, however, more than happy to pour their poor to mediocre house offerings.  Never again."
Sasha S.,"Vancouver, WA",1,2,,1.0,6/26/2015,Identification was stolen and had to replace my drivers license. Tried to order a drink using the temporary and the manager told me it wasn't a valid form of ID. Since when is a government issued temporary not valid? The server was quite kind - but the manager is an idiot.
Michelle V.,"Portland, OR",0,18,9,2.0,5/30/2016,"Service didn't really care or pay attention,we had to ask for a refill 4 times by our server. The server that brought our food wasn't so polite and threw an attitude at us when we asked if we forgotten to order to something but he prompted right back with I only have two hands. Well geez. Sorry if you had a bad day at work. Food was okay as always,  we will only come for the baby back ribs! Other than that we will go somewhere else...."
Jeri C.,"Corbett - Terwilliger - Lair Hill, OR",9,8,10,4.0,10/9/2015,"The menu is too much, cut the thing in half, in my opinion. I go here for their Broccoli Cheddar soup, it is fantastic. One of my lunch time favs!"
Crisa m.,"Portland, OR",49,33,23,4.0,3/19/2014,"I really liked BJ's on Hayden Island. Food was pretty good. I had the margarita and it could have used some more tequila, I couldn't even taste it, and for $9.75 I should have been. Prices are a little high for what they serve, and for the fact its a chain. They do brew their own beer and root beer.  all in all pretty good, might be back in were in the area.."
Chris K.,"Vancouver, WA",1,60,25,5.0,11/28/2012,"One of my favorite places, great food and great beer. I can get busy at lunch time and parking can be hard to find. Personally I have not had a bad meal here and I come here often. My favorite beer is the seasonal pumpkin which must be the favorite of a lot if people as they run out very fast every year. Brew more please! The blonde beer is my favorite standby.  As well as the pizza, one of my favorite dishes is the clam chowder bread bowl."
Justin M.,"Vancouver, WA",262,12,1,4.0,7/31/2015,I'm eating the New Orleans jambalaya and it is fantastic. I love spice and it has the perfect amount for me. If I was older I would definitely get a beer or two with this. A little salty but not too salty to not enjoy my meal. Knocked off one star because one of the people I'm eating with meal was very salty and didn't want to finish that. The other other person got a small pizza and is very satisfied. Everybody was nice and timely!
Angie G.,"Bonney Lake, WA",6,6,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Came in for dinner with family of four tonight (2 adults, 2 children). We were seated right away, but then ignored, overlooked...for 15 minutes. Restaurant was busy, but not slammed, and other tables were seated and provide service while we continued to be ignored.  We got up and walked out. We will not return."
Heather S.,"Portland, OR",29,71,,4.0,3/3/2014,"I can't believe I actually went to a chain (GASP!!) and (huge GASP!) enjoyed it! Yes, we waited a long time to be seated. And even then we sat in the bar. Service was slow, but there were so many people in there and only two waiters for about 20 tables. Seems a lot in my opinion.  The food is really great. We were offered some pizza while we waited and it was average chain pizza. My husband liked it and he doesn't normally like thick crust pizza. I thought it was a bit greasy.  One of the main reasons I liked this place is they have an actual ""Light"" menu that is quite extensive. I got chicken pita tacos and hubby got Mahi Mahi tacos. My daughter and her friend got the angel hair pasta with shrimp. All were great! As someone who has recently just dedicated themselves to losing weight before vacation (aren't we all?), i really appreciated a lighter side.  Drinks. They also had light drinks that were pretty good. I had the guiltless martini and he had the skinny-rita. They might have been light on alcohol, but they tasted good. They seemed to have a really good happy hour too, but we missed it. It ends at 7:00 which is a plus if it takes 45 minutes to be seated.  Overall I was pretty impressed and I was really surprised. I mean, it's a chain for godsake. The price was pretty right too. So not bad at all.  Clientele was definitely not your average ""Portland"" crowd, which can either be bad or good."
Laurie V.,"Vancouver, WA",2,4,,4.0,7/15/2015,I would definitely go there again the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with the White cheddar mash potatoes were so delicious.  The server could've been a little more attentive because we waited a long time for our second round of drinks and in fact I had to go find her and ask her if we could have another round.  But the food was really good.
Bridget L.,"Phoenix, AZ",168,25,19,4.0,1/17/2014,My visit here was at the top of happy hour. It was a slow hour for any restraurant.   The Moroccan salmon was DELICIOUS! The happy hour menu isn't real big but good wine. And by far- the best desserts are at BJ's!!!!!
Lanette S.,"Vancouver, WA",0,1,2,5.0,10/31/2014,"Mediterranean Taco w Black Bean Corn Relish is Very Good.  Maui Glazed Center-Cut Pork Chop was the ""Bomb""... Sangrias are amazing!!!  Beer selection is Wow!!  Service & Menu are incredible!!!"
Peaches A.,"Pasadena, CA",2,126,138,4.0,7/25/2015,"I came on a work business trip where I was working for about four days at the Portland Convention Center and I stayed at a nearby hotel to this BJ's. I got a cold about a day before the trip so I wasn't feeling to adventurous to go out and eat. This BJ's was about a two minute drive from the Red Lion hotel I was staying at and while I'm not a huge fan of BJ's and don't really eat here when I'm home it's a great option where you can get pretty good food easily and that actually has lots of options. All in all I came here for three dinners, all of which were take out and all that I was able to easily order online. Over the three dinners I had a steak with tortilla soup, a personal pizza with the tomato soup and the parmesan crusted chicken. I enjoyed all the meals I ordered as much as I could having a cold and all. The hostess was very nice and they made sure to get my to go order quickly and made sure I had everything I needed. All in all I was happy with the food, service and ease of being able to order online and If I'm ever in the area for work again I would return."
Chuck M.,"Silverdale, WA",2922,434,5215,4.0,8/20/2013,"I have been here before, but it has been some time. Service is great, very attentive to your needs. Tonite I went with the Sirloin Steak...medium-rare, with steamed veggies, and a cup of soup. Perfect, perfect, perfect...mmmm, perfect...!!!"
