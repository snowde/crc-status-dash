Angela L.,"Spanaway, WA",3,19,,5.0,10/14/2017,"We had the best service from this young man named Nick. He looked like Kai from Vampire Diaries. So sweet and very attentive. Lots of ice in my tea. The boneless wings with sriracha dry rub are amazing. Oh and my fish and chips were awesome. Usually I eat the spaghetti because it is really good and I am a picky picky pasta eater, but I wanted to try something different and I was not disappointed. The fried fish rocked. The clam chowder is pretty good too. I love their fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea.  I wish we had had Nick the next time we came in. My husband felt we should sit in the bar. Never again. Soup without crackers, fish and chips no ketchup. Iced tea no ice. We rarely saw the server I was so disappointed in her. Service for me is one of my highest expectations. So when it is not up to par I am very sad. The food was wonderful as usual though.  We will continue to dine here and I highly recommend this restaurant.  I have two suggestions make sure that Ice tea has lots of ice and the booths need to be made wider. I am a fat girl and could not sit in a booth, not enough room."
Leah G.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,6,1,2.0,12/31/2017,"So disappointing! It's happy hour and they ran out of their happy hour wine!  They can't (won't) make a substitution because the cabernet sauvignon they DO have is considered their ""high end"" wine and is ""too expensive"" to substitute. Now -- to be real -- these are both wines that you can get at any grocery store for between $8-$12, so it's not REALLY a high end wine but whatever.  So poor planning on the part of whoever does their ordering to run out if something so basic as their house red. Add to this, the manager pinching pennies at the expense of customer satisfaction and subsequently earning his restaurant this unfavorable yelp review. Bad idea to make the customer pay for someone's incompetence, mistake, or whatever it was that caused them to run out of their house red wine.  Incidentally, BJ's has all wines half price on Tuesdays so it's a little ironic that the manager considers it too expensive to substitute today but will be selling it at half price in two days from now."
Kelly S.,"Wenatchee, WA",109,12,13,5.0,9/12/2017,"Ordered: Root beer glazed wings, prime rib dip, and Oreo pazooki Positives:  service was awesome!  Our waitress was very attentive even with it being extremely busy.  The manager was even out helping!!  The wings are to die for; I'm usually drawn to buffalo wings but these are some of the best wings I've ever had.  I was torn between my ""go-to"" menu item (parmesan crusted chicken) and trying the turkey dip.  The waitress suggested the prime rib dip instead.  WOW!  So glad she did!!!  As always, the pazooki was delicious, definitely my favorite. Negatives:  the parking is shared with four other major restaurants so can be a little tough.  The hostess that took our names walking in and then later sat us looked/acted as though she would rather be cleaning gum from under park benches.  I don't like to put people down but compared to the rest of experience, her attitude really stuck out.  Maybe she was having a bad day but it was really off putting.  I really can't think of anything negative besides those two things, our whole meal from walking in to leaving was fabulous!"
Carrie T.,"Boise, ID",37,44,,2.0,8/28/2017,"We had a party of 8 stop in for drinks and apps around 3:45 on a Saturday afternoon. As it was in between lunch and dinner, it was pretty empty except for the bar. It took several minutes to be seated, and then another 20 minutes for any kind of service, which was rather disappointing. Our server stopped by after we sat looking at the menu for 15 minutes to notify us she had a couple of other tables and would be back later. Huh? She then took her time closing out the other customers before stopping by to grab our drink order.  Once the drinks came, they were all very good. They have several flavors of sparkling water and a great beer/alcohol selection. The appetizers were typical - several orders of mozza sticks, spinach & artichoke dip, and garlic Parmesan knots. Overall, a pretty meh experience. I would recommend bar seating in the future."
An D.,"North Canton, OH",0,16,7,5.0,12/18/2017,Jeremiah red amber is delicious! Saracha Queso dip is fabulous! & they have the football game on on a Monday. Happy camper! Plus they have happy hour for any NFL game going on! Super nice
Josh J.,"Spanaway, WA",0,1,,2.0,12/23/2017,"I'm torn. The staff was great... except for the chef who prepared my rib eye. Quite possibly the worst rib eye I've ever had. Which is very disappointing when you pay for quality, and get trash. The Mrs. got the sirloin, and it was also sub par. The waitress was very nice, but even though i told her we were there celebrating my wife's birthday, and that we came there strictly for the free birthday Pizookie, she forgot. Granted it was rather busy, and her section had most of the large tables. White cheddar mash, and my daughter's French fries were very tasty."
Joe R.,"Bellevue, WA",78,154,30,4.0,6/19/2017,Expect: This was my first time at this location and it wasn't too bad! We called to make a big reservation which had to be confirmed through the manager (which took a little while...). But our server was awesome and the food was pretty good! I can definitely say that we will be coming back sooner or later.  Service: 5 Cleanliness: 5 Quality of food: 4 Quality of drinks: 4 Tip: BJ's are typically busy; I would advise a reservation.
Trista H.,"Everett, WA",39,376,2729,3.0,10/2/2016,"A group of four stopped in here for a brew and lite bite before checking into our hotel room. Free parking can be found in the parking lot. Discover is an accepted form of payment. Tabs were easily split. BJ's reminded me of so many other sports bars/burger joints: Bob's, Boston's, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc... The decor is spacious and modern.  The beer and wine menu is extensive and takes some time to peruse. With that being said, it would be helpful if the servers gave the patrons a couple of minutes to browse the vast selections rather than hover around waiting for an order to be placed. My wife and I chose a couple of pounders of Oasis Amber for $6.25 each. A bit high-priced to me. We shared the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer for $11.25. Our server stated these egg rolls were on the spicy side, which was incorrect. Sweet chili dipping sauce does not constitute spicy. The egg rolls were packed with fresh avocado and were a bit flavorless and extremely rich. Poor choice on our end. Our server was pushy in the beginning then became very scarce once our orders were served. We actually had to request our second beers from another server. Thank you BJ's for whetting our whistle while we were waiting for our hotel room."
Ana G.,"Puyallup, WA",0,5,1,3.0,11/27/2017,"Bj's makes my favorite salad anywhere: roasted Brussels sprout and kale salad with blackened salmon. Absolutely delicious. The salmon is always excellent and not overdone. Unfortunately, we don't eat here that often because the service is so inconsistent. Tonight, they forgot our salad dressing and service was slow. We might have had a second round of drinks but we were never asked. Too bad for a restaurant with decent food in Puyallup."
Jennifer L.,"Arlington, WA",0,41,49,3.0,8/16/2017,"Not only do I base my reviews on food, I do it for customer service as well...food was decent and customer service wasn't that great. My friend and I were here for lunch and it wasn't busy. From the moment we sat down we waited 10 min before we got our water (we know exact time, cause we posted a story to IG, so this is how we kept track of time). Our wings came out 31 minutes after being seated. We got lemon pepper and spicy buffalo, which were both pretty good. I liked the lemon pepper better. After that the salads we got came out 10 min later. We were wondering what took so long, by I guess there was no cook and I overheard the server saying there was a manager helping out. I got the Cobb salad which was sooo good and hearty! My friend got the seared ahi salad which was delicious. Huge portions and I recommend sharing the salad."
Sabrina J.,"Puyallup, WA",111,25,7,4.0,10/28/2017,"I absolutely love this place. I really enjoy the happy hour menu. I've come here for meetings, family celebrations and just dinner with my husband. They have great beer on tap md delicious salads! I would give it a 5 but the employees sometimes seem like they hate their lives..."
Faith F.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,1,3.0,8/25/2017,My husband and I usually come here at least twice a month. It's usually pretty good and we've started ordering takeout here. However when we got home our pizookie was a squished mess that didn't even fill half the bowl it was in. Kind of a disappointment.
Madison F.,"Puyallup, WA",0,10,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Literally the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant! The only good thing about it was our poor waitress who kept having to deal with the kitchen's screw ups on our orders. We all ordered our food and a manager came out to tell us that they were missing a prep cook that day and couldn't put guacamole on the four of us's food who ordered something with it. Three of my friends asked for just avocado slices instead and I decided to order something else (odd that they couldn't just make some guacamole real quick, I've worked in lots of restaurants and know it's super simple to make). Our food is brought out and my tacos has cheese on them. The waitress apologized and said that there was a new cook working and that cheese isn't suppose to be on the shrimp tacos and took my food back. One of my friends was eating his soup and found a huge chunk of plastic in it. Instead of comping his meal, they offered him a free dessert. Finally, once all my friends were done eating, my fixed food came out. So I awkwardly got to eat my food while the rest of my friends were already done. Not only that, but my food was freezing cold and absolutely disgusting but I was so hungry and didn't want to wait for them to recook my food for a third time. The waitress overheard me telling one of my friends at the table that my food was gross and a manager came over an apologized for the food and offered me a dessert(I said no, they don't have anything dairy free). We got our checks but they were completely messed up. My friend never got her check and neither did I, but they still made my other friend who found plastic in his soup pay for his meal. I don't think any review could ever truly bring light to how much of a s*** show this dining experience was, but when we all left we agreed to never come back.  To our poor waitress: you were amazing!! She was the only great thing about this experience."
Larry K.,"Federal Way, WA",27,1,2,4.0,7/9/2017,This was a cool place with great service I enjoyed the steak and potatoes I had while my girlfriend enjoyed her cheese and ham grilled sandwich the only problem we ran into is that there was flies on the patio outside I would recommend this restaurant to some of my Amigos
Tamara H.,"Tacoma, WA",34,2,2,2.0,2/20/2017,Don't wear high heels in the Puyallup location  I have SLIPPED ON THEIR FLOOR EVERY TIME I HAVE COME HERE.  I wonder how many women have and didnt catch themselves in time. Lawsuits waiting to happen
Kristina G.,"Enumclaw, WA",17,46,183,4.0,2/18/2017,"Really enjoyed coming here- had really good food and a great waitress through a couple of hiccups.  Strongly represent the mashed potatoes and Parmesan crusted chicken and the wedge salad. Also the Red ale was very drinkable and smooth!  We went on Saturday evening for dinner where the wait for a table neared a half hour. It seemed like multiple occasions occurred where parties didn't hear their names being called out despite the waitstaff yelling out a couple of times. Once we were seated, we got our drinks and looked through the massive menu.  Had a small issues with a steak that was over cooked but our waitress and the manager were incredibly supportive."
Colleen I.,"Tacoma, WA",103,3,,5.0,3/26/2017,"To MY favorite bartender, Thank you ! If you like whiskey, then you will have to know that he makes the BEST manhattans.  Tell him Colleen sent you."
Mark V.,"Graham, WA",0,26,3,3.0,8/3/2017,"I would give it a flavorless one star, but my wife would say it is a five.   I find it too corporate, too formula and the beer too hoppy.   My wife likes the salads and healthy options."
Ryan C.,"Puyallup, WA",128,138,4,3.0,4/21/2016,"We've been back once since our bad experience. Things were a little better this time, but service was still slow and some what inattentive.  Food was correct, and good this time though so thats good. Still not sure how often we'll be back because there are so many other options in Puyallup, but I suppose we might try again."
Rachel D.,"Tacoma, WA",36,22,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"Service slow. Ordered a kale and Brussel sprout salad. Received mixed greens but not kale. It was a healthy salad but so much dressing. Ick!  And as I got to end of salad , a hair!  Gross"
Brent T.,"WA, WA",1,6,8,5.0,2/14/2017,"I have been to BJ's multiple times. Every time I have gone, the food and beer have been great. Last night, I went with a group of 4 adults and two kids. We were quickly seated and the kids (4 year old and almost 2 year old) were given a cup of mixed fruit and a folded breadstick. The avocado egg rolls were a great appetizer.  My entree was the Ahi Salad, which was fantastic. The fish was seared (as Ahi should be) and came with wasabi.  I also tried the Grilled California Club, which was good. They didn't skimp on the avocado and the bacon was perfectly cooked. As for beer: I recommend the BJ's Blonde or the Jeremiah Red. Service was great. Food came quickly and my water cup never went dry."
Michael C.,"Windsor Locks, CT",157,1,,1.0,4/1/2017,Food came out twice cold and under cooked.   Getting a waitress to refill your drink is like winning the jackpot.
Bruce W.,"Puyallup, WA",0,50,,1.0,9/10/2017,"I vowed never to return to this place, but my grand daughter wanted to go so she could try the new dessert, Churro Pizzookie. My previous reviews chided their poor service, and that has not been fixed. When we first arrived about 90% of the tables were empty. I asked for a table for four and the host said it would be about 5-minutes. Really, the place was empty. Our server was very nice, but I don't think this organization has the tools in place for good service. The food is generally OK, but something is always wrong. This time the asparagus was way overcooked and the table behind us also sent it back to the kitchen. The asparagus was obviously not right and should have never been brought to the table. The manager did address our concerns but continued to ask what was wrong with the asparagus. The wait between every step of the meal process was too long for this type of establishment. The new dessert, well the ice cream was good, but the Churros were not prepared properly, were chewy, and honestly tasted like they had just been thawed and dumped under the ice cream.  At some level this restaurant (or maybe this chain) needs to find management that gives the employees the tools to run a better place. I think I'm done with BJ's Brewhouse."
Garet K.,"Sumner, WA",29,3,,2.0,5/13/2017,I have been here 3 times now and every time the service has been poor. The only reason we came a 3rd time is we received a gift card. Otherwise I would come anymore. The waiter pretty much leave you for long stretches of time.
Shania S.,"Seattle, WA",39,4,2,5.0,6/11/2017,Tonight we decided to go out to Bj's and it was the best decision ever. Corinne was our sever and probably the best one we have ever had. She was very thorough and kind throughout our entire visit. She made sure we had everything we needed at all times. Both of our meals were cooked perfectly and we were both very satisfied. Corinne made us feel very welcome and appreciated. We will definitely drive down to this location to visit her when we can!
Cassandra C.,"SeaTac, WA",174,118,264,3.0,3/4/2016,I love the ambiance of all BJs restaurants. The one in Southcenter has a place in my heart because that's where I watched the NFC championship game against the 49ers. That is the year Seattle won the super bowl. Also Tacoma is where we found out the gender of our baby by the server putting a pink Splenda packet under our pazooki. Anyways! Enough about me. This visit was great except for the fact that they put dressing on my salad when I asked them not to. However I was so hungry I just ate it and the extra dressing on the side they gave me went unused. *shrug You lost a star guys but to be fair I only give 5* out to an establishment that went above and beyond. Everything else was great. We came on a Friday evening at about 6p. We were seated pretty much right away. A quick 10 minute wait was all. There are TVs perfectly placed so the entire restaurant has a view at their own seats.
Emily S.,"Casper, WY",1,28,6,5.0,5/11/2017,This place is great! It is popular so it can get busy and sometimes there is a wait but it's worth it. The homemade cokes are amazing! And the pizza is the best thick crust pizza in town even though it is a chain. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone. Even health conscious or people who are into gluten free. I've never had bad service or a rude waiter. They also have some great lunch deals that they usually let you take advantage of any time of day. The pazookies are incredible! Probably my favorite dessert of all time is the cookies and cream pazookie. I've even gone here before just for dessert. If it is a weekend evening and you are in a hurry or really hungry I suggest calling ahead for a table. It'll save you probably 30+ min.
Smaly K.,"Tacoma, WA",110,418,1541,3.0,11/29/2015,"I guess they changed up the menu, because we didn't see a lot of the usual items, including the Cajun Pasta that my cousin and I always order.  My cousin ordered the Jambalaya, which was a little too salty.  I decided to try the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne, which was a new menu item.  It was good, but didn't taste like it was worth $16.  It tasted like your simple, basic pasta, the kind you can make at home with a jar of marinara sauce.  For dessert, we shared a Chocolate Chunk Pizookie, which never seems to be disappointing.  So good wasn't bad, but service wasn't the greatest.  Our server was nice, but very quiet and not attentive."
Alexa C.,"Puyallup, WA",137,8,4,2.0,6/25/2016,I usually have a great experience there and I absolutely love the pizooki but the burger I got was no better than something off the dollar menu. The service was crappy and extremely slow and after showing the waiter my burger he just chuckled it off without even asking if I would like more tomato (see picture) overall it's extremely over priced for the off brand Cheesecake Factory it's pretending to be.
Brian S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,7,,3.0,4/19/2017,Good food and beer plan on waiting a while for a table during peak times. Parking sucks here you are lucky if you get a spot in the lot
Avniel Y.,"Renton, WA",8,3,,4.0,3/7/2017,"So many options! I love using the app to hold a seat, pre-order, and pay. Great place."
Frankie S.,"Seattle, WA",1,13,9,1.0,9/11/2015,"9/11/2015 Nasty Menu was all sticky.  Absolutely no attention to details here. All brain dead employees are mostly concerned about trying to speak politely... They missed it all because it's a restaurant not a place for you to try and learn the English language, just worry about cleanliness and my food... 08/16/2015 walked in at 7:04 pm ordered within 5 min... 7:57 pm still no dinner at my table for 2... This is by far one of the slowest BJ'S Restaurants I have been to on the west coast... it must be the hillbilly deluxe style in puyallup...?  Yes all the other negative reviews are true... Usually dirty silverware, slow service, and my last time here. Red Robin and a dozen other places are all around within 2 minutes. Slowest Dine in place on earth and disorganized  What a Joke For A Restaurant... They provide fast service to cops first for some reason when we were seated first and ordered first... Maybe these state patrol cops that dine here are over paid..."
J C.,"Puyallup, WA",0,27,9,4.0,2/19/2017,Beer and food is great. Can be a bit pricey though. Not the best place for date night. It's hard to hear in there sometimes. Try the Tatonka Stout and Jeremiah Red.
Ryan M.,"South Hill, WA",24,1,,1.0,5/21/2017,"This might have been the worst dining experience I've ever had. My son and I came in because we had a free appetizer coupon we wanted to use, on Sunday night around 6:15. The hosts were very friendly and brought us to a table immediately as the restraint was not very busy. The service, however, was atrocious. Our server, April, greeted us in a rude manner, she was definitely not happy to be there and it showed. We had to repeat our drink order because she said she, ""spaced out"". Then she offered the excuse that she had been there since 11:00 AM and was tired. I am a server myself and one thing you should never do is tell your guest you were spaced out when they were ordering, and that essentially you are too tired to do your job! I'm sorry you were there so long, April, but were you getting paid that whole time? Yes! So do your job or find a different line of work! We ordered our appetizer and she asked us for our dinner order at the same time. Our dinner came out before our appetizer, and we didn't have silverware on the table so I asked for some utensils, as I had spaghetti and then April went to take another tables order before giving me silverware. The food was mostly forgettable. The spaghetti was mushy and the meatballs looked underdone. My sons grilled cheese sandwich looked as if it sat in the window for 10 minutes, it was hard and wholly unappealing. 10 or 15 minutes after our food was delivered our appetizer came out, and I declined as we were both finished eating. We asked for the bill and when she brought back my card, she had charged me for another tables bill, double what I should have been charged. She then never came back and we had to get a manager to fix the overcharge. The manager was apologetic and assured me the charge had been reversed and charged my card the correct amount. He told me to keep the free app card we had, which since our app came after the meal, I was going to do anyways. Overall this experience was terrible."
Jason A.,"Puyallup, WA",6,50,1,3.0,6/9/2016,Usually pretty good food. Took away my chicken tacos which was my go to. Ordered bison burger. Burnt it and Hun was soggy at start. Amazing service though. Avo eggrolls a++++ B Have a question or wish to follow up on my review ?  Managers or owners : feel free to email me 
Brian D.,"Puyallup, WA",8,23,9,3.0,11/23/2016,"Wife loves the place, me not so much. I just am not a fan of their menu or beers."
Katie G.,"Puyallup, WA",11,29,8,4.0,5/26/2016,"We went on a Wednesday night. Were sat pretty quick and our Server Jorge Z came over to get drinks going. He was super, duper attentive and friendly. Having worked in the restaurant world for 8+ yrs I don't praise servers often but he's the Best server in Puyallup that we've encountered so far. We'll be requesting his section from now on. He's THAT awesome.  The burgers we delicious. The Pizookie is orgasmic. The beer is good but pricier than Red Robin across the way. Other wise the two are comparable in (burger) prices but you get a swankier feel and better burgers!  This BJs was much better than the first one I went to in CA. Looking forward to returning."
Ian S.,"Puyallup, WA",2,11,,2.0,4/23/2016,My roommate and myself both started out with the clam chowder.  It was very bland and luke warm.  We both agreed that it tasted like it came out of a can. For dinner I had the Brisket and Bacon burger.  It was acceptable but very dry.  My roommate had the same thing.  He ordered his medium well and I ordered mine well done (I know well done burgers are not ideal but I get sick from anything less).  The burger just did not have any (or very little) sauce and was very dry for both of us.  It was also VERY salty and I love salty foods. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the waitress was good and kept our drinks full.  We should have just went to Red Robin in the same parking lot.  We will not be back.
Bridget A.,"Modesto, CA",167,25,15,5.0,5/8/2016,Bjs was my goto for an late afternoon beer when I lived in Cali. But Washington is so much better getting to leave with a groweler of their jerry burst was enough to make me never want to leave! Not to mention the coolest bar tenders! This will be my new spot in my new home!
Andrea S. M.,"Ashford, WA",7,2,,5.0,1/18/2017,"I just had dinner at this restaurant with my husband for the very first time. To put it simply, we are quite impressed. Sujenti was our server, and we really enjoyed conversing with her as well as her service. So the service was awesome, the food was delicious, the restaurant wasn't too loud, we didn't have to wait very long to be seated, and we will definitely go back!"
