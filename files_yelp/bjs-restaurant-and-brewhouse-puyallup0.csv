Anna C.,"Frisco, TX",1,12,1,5.0,5/17/2014,"First time eating at this location. Found it to be just as good at the Tacoma Mall location, but with more convenient parking. Food was fantastic (as usual) and our server was very accommodating with special menu adjustments we requested. The beer choices are endless & each is better than the last. I would highly recommend this eating establishment to my family & friends!"
J. S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,13,,2.0,1/25/2014,"Don't go on Friday or Saturday in a group.... Six of us showed up at 7:00 pm, and was told there would be an hour wait. A couple dozen people were seated before us, all in parties of 4 or less. To make matters worse, they had an entire section of open tables that we could have been seated at. When they took us to be seated, it was clearly evident that we could have been seated sooner... The food was good.  Our server was polite, but seldom seen.  It leads me to believe that they may have been understaffed, perhaps which is why they left tables open without seating my group."
Tim F.,"Puyallup, WA",5,50,5,1.0,6/3/2013,"Kitchen is slow.. our starter came out cool, called waitress over an informed her our wings was cold an she just gave a blank look an we waited for an answer so after a few seconds of awkward silence I told her take them off the bill. Wife had the stuffed baked potato I had the jalapeno burger. The potato was dry but it did come out hot almost over cooked. The burger was cool kept cuz I was hungry. The burger was good would of been better if it was hot. Over all I'm no impressed with the place. Can say will not come back an can't recommend this place.."
Tracey P.,"Bonney Lake, WA",77,41,,3.0,5/21/2014,"My two sons and I visited last night and had a great dinner - waitstaff was very nice, as was the décor.  We had never been to one of these restaurants before.  I am really glad we stayed, because I almost walked out.  When we came in there were MANY open tables, yet a line.  There were two hostesses behind the counter and I have no idea what they were doing.  One girl seated a party of four, and the other began talking with the next party.  They were then seated immediately.  Now it was my turn - she asked me if I was a rewards member I said what's that we have never been here before - oh ok wait over there......She never answered me about the rewards club, she never said welcome I am so glad you are here for the first time, but looked at me with distain and made us wait for a good 5 minutes while she and the other girl milled around and then finally looked over and said okay we can seat you now.  Was I being punished for coming in for the first time or not being a member of a secret club or what - there were tons of tables available and were well staffed.  There are a lot of other choices in the same parking lot and because of the look of the restaurant we waited - I was curious.  I would, however, find some new hostesses - train them on how to be nice, et cetera.  Not a smile out of either of them, as a business owner I would not tolerate that, and obviously it was an issue or I would not be taking the time to write this note.  We will come again because of the waitress who was tipped at 20% she saved the day.  Oh and these were my 2 adult sons so it was not me and 2 small children.  They eat out a lot too and have a lot of 20-something friends and were also put off by these girls.  Just saying.  Hey and maybe you can contact me back and tell me about the Rewards Club or whatever I am not a member of - still wondering what's wrong with me that it was a secret on my first visit ever."
Draven W.,"Puyallup, WA",2,18,1,1.0,5/7/2013,"Really wanted to like this place. I ordered the grilled chicken club and my wife ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. When our food came out it was a turkey club and the fettuccine Alfredo. i didn't order the turkey club, honest mistake I get it. Not once were we asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks after that missed  order  nor did the waiter acknowledge us as he helped others around us.  After watching my wife gnaw on the hard as a rock garlic bread that came with her fettuccine Alfredo my grilled chicken club finally came out, it was mediocre, and there was no ketchup in sight nor was I asked if I needed one. We flagged down someone to get more refills and ketchup. There's a grip of workers there for such horrible service. I'll never go there again or recommend to anyone."
Ed S.,"Federal Way, WA",28,8,,5.0,12/13/2013,The pizza here is awesome. Little personal size ones for cheap on Fridays. They have great home brewed beer. The seating is open and fantastic service from the entire staff. Never had a bad meal. Would recommend this place to anyone. Got a hot date go to BJ's!
Bill H.,"Bonney Lake, WA",14,7,2,4.0,11/29/2013,Great food. Lots if variety tasty appetizers. Lots of brew selections. Will be going back. Wait staf top notch.
Trevor S.,"Puyallup, WA",1,5,,3.0,1/28/2015,"I have read several of the reviews here on Yelp and so far I have not been convinced to try this place. I have been by it several times and it appears to be a very nice establishment. After reading the reviews, it seems that it may need a lot of training on the service side of things. I am going to give it a shot, but you have a lot to live up to. One is that the food service should not be more than 12-14 minutes from time of ordering to delivery for the entrees and 7-8 minutes for the appetizers upon delivery. The beverages should never be more than 5 minutes. And, when the beverages come out so should the flatware and the coasters. This way the flatware is available upon arrival of the appetizers and no one is left wondering. Get ready I am coming this week and I only ask for these few things to happen with a  sincere smile. I love to give compliments and catch people doing things right and never really want to write anything the contrary. Good Luck!"
Kathy N.,"Tacoma, WA",0,7,,5.0,4/8/2014,Don't understand the reviews~~eat here at least once a month since they opened and have never had a bad meal or service~~their burgers and pizzas are the best in puyallup~~they do put too much pepper in their southern gravy~~great place
joel s.,"Puyallup, WA",30,3,2,3.0,4/28/2013,good service. good beer. great food. tables are way to close together. i dont like someones butt over my food when they try and squeeze in between the tables
Debbie M.,"Spanaway, WA",39,65,3,3.0,12/17/2014,"foods good, drink prices are a little high, nice inside"
Dede H.,"Bonney Lake, WA",1,5,,2.0,3/13/2014,"It has been several months since I've been to this BJ's but I tried this place twice.  The first time the services was super slow but the fish & chips were really good.  We decided to try it again a couple months later.  We sat there for 20 minutes and finally a server was walking toward us.  She passed us and stopped at the table next to us and they were seated 10 min after us.  So I'm thinking okay, she will come here next.  She walks off in the opposite direction of us and disappeared.  At that point we just got up and left.  The other weird thing is it was lunch time and there weren't that many people in the place but they sat the other people that came in after us right smack up against our table and they asked to be moved.  So later that day I emailed BJ's on their website, nada.  No response what so ever.  They could have at least said they would look into they slow service or whatever.  So since they are a chain and could care less about customer service, I will not be back!  They only got 2 stars because the fish and chips were good on our 1st visit..  If you have 4 hours for lunch, check them out.  Otherwise go to the one in Tacoma, had a better experience there."
Andrew A.,"Tacoma, WA",0,18,1,5.0,7/18/2014,First time here. Ordered a burger and a beer. Both were delicious. Our server Paisley was awesome. Very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. I will be coming back especially if she's gonna be our waitress.
John D.,"Puyallup, WA",1,16,,3.0,10/29/2014,Food is fair. Pretty pricy and not too many different options. Would like to see a bigger burger list with spicier burgers. Lunch is the best deal. Chicken tacos are to die for. Dine in or carry out.
Mark S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,5,,1.0,9/8/2015,"My wife and myself along with my daughter, her husband and two Grandkids, 1 1/2 and 6 years old, went to our local BJ's on 9/6/15 at aprox. 7:00 and were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. The kids were rather excited and rambunctious so we patiently waited outside so as not to bother other patrons also waiting inside. After approximately a half hour we inquired how much longer our wait would be and were told by two very pleasant and empathetic hostesses that they were working on it. After another 15 minutes, with the little ones being very hungry, we again inquired how long our wait might be. We were told that some patrons were occupying their table for 2 hours but we were first on the wait list. AFTER AN HOUR WAIT, we were finally called for a table! We were seated in the back half of the restaurant and were surprised to see that about 80% of this area had open tables!!! Our server, Tony, was effusively pleasant and took our drink orders. We asked him if we could speak to the manager. The manager on duty came to our table and we proceeded to tell him how long we had waited and asked why we hadn't been seated much earlier in the back area that had so many tables open. He went on to explain that, being Sunday night, they usually don't expect to be as busy as they were and suggested a shortage of waitstaff to cover the whole restaurant. He also offered to buy us all desert as compensation. The service we received from Tony was abysmal! My son-in-law ordered a burger without tomatoes. It arrived with them! My Grandson asked for applesauce with his meal and instead got fries! My wife ordered a side of fries and never received them! We were NEVER asked if we needed drink refills and had to ask for them after the meal was over! The bills were split and items were mixed up on the bills! Even the gratis deserts were screwed up with two of them denied because they were out of Peanut Butter Pazookies. And my Grandson received his sundae without the cherry on top! Everyone, especially a 6 year old knows that the cherry is what makes the sundae!!! The service was so painfully, frustratingly slow that we didn't end up leaving the restaurant until 9:30!! This was way past the baby's intended bed time and she actually ended up falling asleep in her high chair! While the manager tried to compensate us for the extremely long wait time for a table, this was before insult was added to injury with the incredibly slow service! Worst dining out experience I've ever had!!!"
Stephanie H.,"Tacoma, WA",30,6,,5.0,6/19/2014,My husband and I love this place.  The pizza here beats any other place.  We recently had our Anniversary and decided to have lunch here.  The Baked Beignet is Amazing.  I'll be ordering 2 next time so I don't have to share.  I love being a BJ's premier member.
Coryn S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,12,3,2.0,4/7/2013,"I was hesitant to write a review because the place JUST opened about 1 week ago but I feel the wait staff needs major improvements. For one, there were SO many staff members it was crazy! We had a total of 4 or 5 waiters/waitresses come to our table alone and none of them were communicating with each other on if/when we had ordered our drinks or our food. We were asked for our ID's twice. We were never offered water!  We had to ask for napkins. Food came out warm, not hot. They asked us if we were aware of their points card. They explained that you receive 1 point per dollar spent so we asked them to sign us up. NEVER got the card. After spending $78 there on food and drinks, it would have been nice to have those points credited. We may go back once the place has settled in more and the wait staff knows their left hand from their right."
Jerry J.,"Puyallup, WA",30,19,8,3.0,6/12/2014,"Food is good and a fair value. The beer selection is good, there are several beers on the menu that are not available. The service leaves something to be desired."
Lindzie K.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,15,2,1.0,10/6/2013,Worst food and lemon drop ever. I mean horrible. Go to the Ram or Olive Garden if you want big chain restaurant food. Shoot even any fast food place would be better. Yuck. Zookies are way to sugary and have the texture of raw cookie dough. Lemon drop is watered down vodka with a sugar rim. I mean the drink was damn near transparent.
L M.,"Puyallup, WA",14,6,,1.0,5/2/2013,"This place is a joke. It was slow so we expected to have at least decent service. We got the worst service. Everything we wanted they didn't have, so they had to come back to our table repeatedly to let us know we had to reorder. Never again."
