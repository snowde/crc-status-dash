Sarawr O.,"Post Falls, ID",17,59,19,3.0,1/21/2015,"I enjoyed our date night here! THIS was the deep dish pizza we'd been looking for. Their beer is good- I loved the Jeremiah Red. They offer cute little half pints, which is so great- that way you can sample different beers but have more than a little shot sample. Buffalo wings were nice and spicy. We got a little 5-meat deep dish pizza and we were SO SAD that we hadn't gone here for Alex's birthday dinner instead of freaking lame Farelli's. Alex said the deep dish crust might have been the same as pizza huts frozen crust.. which is fine, since he loves it. I hope it's not but with the right amount of gourmet toppings, I don't care too much. We will be back to try it again!"
Randy P.,"Puyallup, WA",16,3,,2.0,10/10/2015,The service is really slow. We came with a group (10) for a birthday party and they said we would have a table at 6pm. At 630 we are still waiting and they are like oh we forgot about you and it will be another 15 to 20 minutes. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Kenneth D.,"Seattle, WA",11,5,7,4.0,1/17/2015,Great place for good food. Perfect for any occasion.  A bit pricey but we'll worth it's taste
Kris H.,"Puyallup, WA",94,42,18,4.0,12/3/2015,"I came here for the beer! They have their own brands of cider that I could drink all night, and it's on tap. I haven't been able to find better in Washington to be honest! I will always come back for this!"
Ky J.,"Puyallup, WA",0,18,3,5.0,7/12/2014,"Sat in the bar tonight with a group of friends after we finished our shifts at work. Our server was attentive but not too overbearing at all. Everything came out great despite a small mis communication with our dessert, which our server fixed right away (we didn't care at all, weren't in any rush). My friends and I are all in the industry and definitely appreciate when we can go to another establishment and receive great service. Wish I could remember her name (tall, slender blonde) Will definitely continue to come back!"
Russ A.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,1,2.0,2/23/2016,"I like BJ's menu and atmosphere in general. My experience at this location on not a busy Friday night(40% of capacity) was super slow service and lack of concern about it. I had friends in a party of 8, and another in a party of 6 that had the same experience.  An hour wait for food without service. No Bueno."
Discerning Z.,"Tacoma, WA",36,42,7,2.0,7/9/2014,"Having had their endless salad and soup lunch special before, my daughter and I decided to stop here for lunch earlier this week. Service was OK, though a bit slow for a quiet Monday at noon. She went for the stuffed mushroom appetizer (OK, though over $8 for 8 small-ish stuffed mushrooms is a bit pricey) and Tuscan chicken (too salty) and I again went for the soup and salad.  The chili was good - made with their beer and topped with sour cream and green onions - but my salad contained not only plastic wrap from the salad dressing but also the dirty stub of the lettuce plant - ick! I complained to the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen. When she returned, she asked if I wanted something else instead - I said no, since the literal garbage in my salad had rather affected my appetite, but that I didn't feel I should pay for it. ""Oh no,"" she replied, ""the manager took care of that.""  When my bill arrived, I was surprised to find that the manager had given me a 50% discount on my lunch - $3.50 off for the salad. I had expected to either not get a bill or to have my lunch not charged but... I paid it and will not be returning anytime soon.  With so many restaurant choices out there, who needs garbage in their salad? And if they're this careless with a simple salad, think what the kitchen staff might put into a burger? Or on a pizza? Ick again!"
dustin g.,"Puyallup, WA",22,228,133,2.0,9/19/2015,"Not impressed. Brand new employee and long wait for food that was average. My second visit here in as many years and I guess I forgot what this place is like. That's right, not memorable. Should have stayed over at red robin with their one hour wait and probably got food quicker. Rough night at BJs"
Michelle G.,"Puyallup, WA",0,6,,5.0,1/27/2016,"I see that they have my favorite dish, the balboa chicken, as their picture! It is spicy enough to enjoy from a super spicy lover, yet the feta and black beans curb that heat and give a great texture and flavor to accompany the heat from the cumin. I ordered the mahi originally, and it was incredibly overwhelmed with fresh tarragon and I just couldn't eat it. They took it back after just seeing the look on my face. I didn't have to say a word! The waitress was overwhelmed by the smell, then the manager was overwhelmed when just passing by. I didn't have to worry. My new Balboa chicken came out and I ate every single morsel on the plate! I hiiiiighly recommend!"
Brad M.,"Tacoma, WA",6,7,,2.0,12/5/2015,"What is BJ's supposed to be? It's not fine family dining, it's got sports games going on which nobody can see or hear. Their prices are too high for the quality. Greasy food, slow service. I wouldn't recommend going on a busy night."
Doug C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10,23,5,4.0,9/16/2015,"Just had dinner at this cool place. I'm from middle TN and have never been to a BJs Brewhouse. The service here was spot on and the food is crazy good. I had the jambalaya and its was spectacular. I did some research and discovered that it had about two days worth of sodium in just one dish. That's super bad news, but not the fault of this particular store."
John S.,"Lakewood, WA",0,2,,1.0,1/30/2015,"Would give 0 stars if i could.  I downloaded this app solely to leave this review. We made a ""reservation"" for bjs 8 hours prior to our arrival time.  They informed us that they do not make reservations but would do their best to accommodate us. We showed up 10 mins early. After over an hour of waiting, watching walk ins get seated before us we decided to leave, with hungry children in tow.  We never got an explanation, or even a word from the hostess as to why, or when we would be seated. We were left to stand there, to be ignored, even when we tried to ask about our table.  I've worked in restaurants for a long time, and have never been more disappointed in service (or lack there of)  If you want food in a somewhat timely manner, do NOT go here, you will be severely disappointed."
M. J.,"Bonney Lake, WA",1,42,40,1.0,11/11/2014,"Second time here (our kids wanted the Pizookies) should have just ordered that. Mozzarella sticks were good- and so was the Pizookies- but the service & meal sucked. Waitress sent home after taking our order - never saw our new assigned waitress till we asked after our food was delivered. No drink refills, food arrived less than hot. Roast beef dip was awful! Sourdough bread burnt not toasted on California burger. Fries barely warm. Manager came to table and admitted that our service was less than acceptable, but didn't even offer to comp one of the Pizookies. Won't be back - really should be able to give a zero star review. Oh yeah - the lights were so dimmed we had to use phone flash lights to read the menus!!"
Ayee M.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/26/2015,My Experience Party of 9. Seating was fair. Wait time to be asked what we would like to drink was 20-30mins. (absolutely ridiculous) We had to ask 3-4 waiters if they could take our order before finally being helped  (Made my family feel as if they did it on purpose because of our ethnicity) Stay Away and Beware of... -Calamari (tasted burnt) -Ahi Poke (too much onion)  -Jambalaya (not seasoned properly) -Atlantic Salmon (dry and over cooked) Food Recommendation: -Ceasar Salad -Clam Chowder -Siracha Chicken Bacon Mac and Cheese -Double Deluxe Burger -Hickory Brisket &Bacon Burger
R T.,"Pullman, WA",0,41,,1.0,2/21/2016,"02/20/2016 Long wait, poor service, manager that doesn't have a clue. Went to BJ's for dinner with three others. Arrived just after 7:00, waited 35 minutes to get a table.  Server took order for waters and two drinks and disappeared.  Other tables around us getting their beverages.  Server eventually showed up with drinks and took our food order - simple calamari and flatbread appetizer, salad and pizza entrée. After 30 minutes server came by and apologized they were having issues in kitchen then disappeared again. Food finally arrived. Calamari was tasteless gooey breaded item and the dipping sauces bland. I did not eat the mess and told the server how bad the dish was.  Server did not offer to replace with alternate.  Other food ok but nothing worth the price.  Server was inattentive during the 2.5 hours we spent but at one weird point sat down at the table as if she were a friend of ours??? Asked the server to remove the calamari from the bill as it was inedible.  One dessert dish ordered that took 20 minutes to arrive - after I got up and asked a couple of servers and the host desk why it was taking so long.  When leaving I asked for the manager. I spoke with him for a few minutes but he just argued they were busy and had kitchen issues so basically they don't have a clue how to handle these situations and if it happens again customers will just have to suffer through poor service, long waits and uncaring staff."
Chloe S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,23,,4.0,8/31/2015,"Paisley is an AMAZING waitress, always so helpful! This is one of our favorite places for date nights, pizzokis are too good!!! So many different choices too....I usually stick with lemon parm crusted chicken and it is always amazingggggg!!! A few times I veered from my usual and wasn't as happy, husband loves the burgers and both types of fries!"
Joelle C.,"Sumner, WA",36,4,,1.0,10/10/2015,"First and LAST visit. This place is a joke. If they tell you it will be a half hour wait be ready to wait 2 hours! Normally we would have left but, with a group of 11 trying to leave and go somewhere else was not feasible. The manager was a joke as well.  Trust me when I say spend your money else where. The food was ok. However, after the inadequate hostesses and manager free would have been too much money!!"
Denny C.,"Puyallup, WA",14,50,34,4.0,7/30/2015,"Despite mixed reviews its worth checking out BJ's to form your own opinion. I've been to BJ's multiple times, this location as well as others and I have not had a bad experience. They have a lot of options to fit different eating habits and the food is really good for a big national chain restaurant. Not to mention great beer. During this visit it was my friend,  my 6 year old and I. Upon entry the staff was very friendly and professional. They instructed us it would be a 15 minute wait, fortunately it was less than 10.  After we were seated our waiter was quick to our table taking drink orders and offering his help.  From that point forward we were absolutely impressed by the level of service. Our waiter, wish I could remember his name to give him accolades, didn't miss a beat. He knows how big a difference the small things make in someone's experience. When I asked if they had a certain sauce, but they did not so I ordered another,  he brought out what I ordered plus what he thought I might like based on my request.  On top of that my friends dinner came out and before we had a chance to look at it he said he noticed the pita bread to have a slight burn on a small portion so he has already requested another order be made at no charge. First I've never had a waiter point out an issue prior to me,  maybe if something was requested to be left off but was not, but definitely not in relation to the quality of preparation. Then to have another order already in the process of being made to accommodated this minor issue, that is going the extra step to make your customer happy. Oh and he didn't take my friends plate that was brought out just to make her wait for the new order.   The My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the kids Mac'n'Cheese is no different than what I'd buy in a box at the grocery store. Outside of that I've been happy with the food,  service, atmosphere and cleanliness at BJ's. I'll absolutely be back and recommend you visit yourself."
Bev R.,"Auburn, WA",1,14,9,3.0,9/11/2014,"Beautiful inside, good music, awesome selection for a menu; not sufficient wait staff though. Need at least one more waiter so the wait ordering and receiving food doesn't take so long."
Brian P.,"Puyallup, WA",0,3,,1.0,11/9/2015,S-L-O-W service! Over an hour and 20 minutes to get our meals. Meals came out wrong and had to send back Buffalo Burger because the bun was stale. Ordered pazookis and 1 came out wrong...it took 15 min to get correct desert. Slow service and bad food... Cannot think of two worse things for a restaurant.
