Lynne G.,"Puyallup, WA",0,11,,2.0,2/22/2016,"I went once and will not be back. My sister ordered a French Dip which had maybe four slices of roast beef which tasted like they were purchased from lower quality deli. The french fries could not have been fresh, they tasted like they were frozen and then deep-fried. I ordered a burger and it was mediocre. I  would much rather go to Out & in or a red Robin. It was a party of three and we all agreed we would not go back to this place... the service was OK considering there were not many patrons inside. The pictures that are posted on yelp are definitely not what was delivered to our table."
Keith B.,"Puyallup, WA",17,36,1,3.0,10/31/2015,"Food is usually prepared and tastes delicious. My only negative is service is generally very so from the kitchen. The bar service is great, however."
Kristi N.,"Puyallup, WA",143,25,2,5.0,10/28/2015,"I've been here 3 times now and have never had slow service or issues with the wait. I'm from Atlanta and this place reminds me very much of Cheesecake Factory. I like that there is something to please everyone on the menu so I typically bring family here. I've had the mushroom Swiss burger and LOVED it as well as some really good salads and lots of beer. I would like to see this business move away from the corporate feel, since this is what is trending in the food industry, but overall I give it a great review! I also like that they have good email offers which keep me coming back!"
Kourtney R.,"Issaquah, WA",1,13,,5.0,3/8/2015,"I've been here multiple  times, always pleased. However  it's usually  during the day where it's slow. Last night (3/7 at 6pm) my family of 6+ a baby came in for dinner, it was very busy! Line out the door! We got in very fast and had a great experience! I'm a server so when I see a busy restaurant  I relize I'm going to be there for awhile, and I'm okay with that. The kitchen and servers get backed up, so I don't expect my food out fast. But even as busy as it was, our food was out within 30 min!!! We were shocked.  We were more then happy to wait longer since we were catching up with family  but happily surprised that it all came out so fast. Our server was awesome also! I didn't catch her name tho, she was blonde and tan, very sweet, funny and efficient. There was a manager  also helping  and checking on us. That's a great team!"
Crystal N.,"Puyallup, WA",55,11,,5.0,10/19/2015,I was very impressed with this place! The service is great and the food is excellent! I look forward to dining there again
Jonathon D.,"Kent, WA",2,2,,5.0,7/17/2015,"I just dinned in at the south hill location BJ's Brewhouse and I was very satisfied! I sat out on the patio and Jessilyn my server was amazing. Honestly the best service I have had out in a very long time. Jessilyn was very sweet, friendly and always refilling my drink right on time. She had a lot of tables at the time but took very good care of my table. I ordered the new bbq burger with modifications and it came out perfect and very quickly! I would definitely come back and ask for Jessilyn again."
Jeremy S.,"Puyallup, WA",26,27,5,5.0,1/22/2015,"Always love coming here. Usually order my favorite the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which is always amazing, salad and of course a Pizookie for desert."
Amanda S.,"Bonney Lake, WA",79,41,39,2.0,11/24/2013,"Had a great Gluten Free pizza, I will say that you should not come eat here if you have a time line or you don't like to just hang out. Second time we ate there the Tortilla soup was GREAT, but everything else thumps down. I think they have a menu that is just too big."
Lorraine G.,"Puyallup, WA",10,6,4,4.0,9/3/2014,"Had a fantastic lunch at Bjs today, but then every time I go there it's an enjoyable experience.  There is rarely a time I have had to wait for a table because it has so much seating! The food is great and well priced. My family's favorite item is the pizookie. It's 3 heated cookies with a variety of icecream choices on top. Yum!"
Dianna J.,"Puyallup, WA",2,9,3,2.0,8/25/2013,"I have to say first and foremost: I love BJs! I've been to Southcenter and regularly go to the one in Tacoma  and the service and food is always incredible and delicious! I think the Puyallup location has a lot to love up to. The service is alright, though slow. The food on the other hand is not where it should be.  We ordered nachos and our favorite pizza and both were VERY light in ingredients. There was barely any cheese or toppings on the nachos and the chips were burnt. The pizza was dry and mostly crust. It's not cheapest place to eat so when the food isn't worth it, than the experience is a bust."
Kari H.,"Tacoma, WA",438,22,2,1.0,8/24/2013,The Tacoma one is excellent but I don't know what happened here. We tried it 3 times.  I give up on this place. Tacoma is the only one worth going to. Jambalaya burnt.  Streak Fried chicken burnt and dry.  Pizza dry like a pizza time pizza. Impossible to get a refill or another beer order.
Lisa S.,"Puyallup, WA",20,113,15,3.0,3/8/2014,Not bad for a chain. Their hand crafted root-beer is great if you like sweet root beer.  Service can be slow especially on weekend nights. Food seems to be really good or bland. I enjoy their salads and pizza most. I grew up in Chicago and their pizza is similar to Chicago pizza in the depth and butteriness category.
Gregory H.,"Puyallup, WA",14,1,,1.0,10/10/2015,Terrible service. Took 90 min to get a small pizza along with 2 salads and a burger. Asked where our food was at got a totally lame excuse from our server (we are busy) The manager didn't come to see us. Got offered a free desert and then 40 minutes went by and we had to get to our movie while begging for our check. This place sucks and customer service is terrible. Should have walked out without paying. I will never go back if I have a choice. Don't go if you have a choice. Red Robin is better.
Rachel H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",745,954,13280,3.0,7/10/2013,This BJ's is as good as the ones in Cali!
Scott M.,"Puyallup, WA",4,8,6,4.0,10/25/2013,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience here. It was a Friday night, so a long wait for seating was expected. Five stars for Shea  our waitress. As busy as it was, she was attentive and nice.   I had and recommend the Balsamic glazed chicken. The chicken was grilled perfectly! It was still juicy and tender. My girlfriend had the Blonde fish and chips and liked it. The one and only complaint that we had is we were called up to be seated but stood around for another ten minutes while others were seated ahead of us.    Overall, I recommend you give it a try."
Julia M.,"Tacoma, WA",6,28,30,1.0,11/12/2014,"Arrived at 6:20pm & It was very busy. Was told 30 min wait - no problem. Waited 55 mins to be seated (3 of us). It seems the crowd died down after 7:30pm. 5 mins later the waitress comes to say ""what can i get for you"" with no smile. We knew exactly what we wanted since we looked at the menu while waiting for a table. It only took a couple minutes for our drinks to come out. 40 mins later our order is brought out by someone else. I wanted a medium-pink burger and fries and it came out crispy and black and the fries were cold. Friend ordered a soup and salad and her soup came out by itself. 10 mins later after her soup was gone the waitress checks on us and we had to tell her she only received half her meal. We never received drink refills. Hungry and thirsty and over 2 hours later we are just ready to go. We ask for the check and 20 mins later did not receive it. we start walking to the front of the restaurant searching for any waitress or manager. A manager approached us and we told him what was going on. He explained they were short staffed and he was the only manager on site and he is having a horrible night. He comped our meal. I appreciated that. Overall it was just a horrible experience with no acceptable excuses for the following summary of errors; 55 min wait time when we were told 30 95 mins to receive food from arrival time cold food wrong orders no drink refills dirty windows no check out"
Chris C.,"Graham, WA",0,15,,4.0,3/14/2014,"My wife and I stumbled upon this place a few weeks back and have been back a couple times.  They have a pretty diverse menu and lots of great appetizers and small plates, so instead of getting entrees, we just sampled. We tried southwest eggrolls (great), boneless wings (ok), garlic chicken wings (awesome!), stuffed mushrooms (great), and flatbread pizzas (great).  Haven't found anything I'd call bad. Their pizza menu looks interesting......will have to try the deep dish pie on the next visit."
Brittany B.,"Puyallup, WA",2,62,10,4.0,1/3/2015,"My boss gave us a gift card to this place for Christmas. We utilized it tonight. The double brew house burger was excellent , and I had the CA Club Sandwich and it was really good . We each ordered an app.  The garlic wings and calamari were both crunchy, fresh, and yummy. I was impressed with the take out process. Pull up, call the number, and get your food Puyallup BJs was on time, with great food, and outstanding customer service.  Thanks and we'll definitely see you again soon."
Robyn W.,"Airville, PA",10,5,1,4.0,4/11/2015,"I loved this place! The food was awesome and the customer service was outstanding! To start our meal we tried the avocado eggrolls and were not disappointed. We also had the Mahi - Mahi tacos and a wedge salad, and both were excellent.  Our kids were treated awesomely and again service was top notch.  We will definitely be coming back!"
Todd M.,"Fairfield, CA",33,26,3,2.0,1/4/2014,"I was heading to Tacoma with my daughters to catch a monster truck show and we decided to get some dinner first.  We intended to go to Olive Garden, but the wait there was too long, and so was the wait at Red Robin.  We'd never been to BJ's, but I figured it would be a good time to check it out -- the wait was a lot shorter.  I guess I should have seen that as a message. The good:  The restaurant was clean.  Our server was pretty nice, and she was pretty good at making sure we had full drinks.  My 9 year old really liked the chicken alfredo.  She said it was some of the best she's ever had. They had lots of TVs and it looked like they had a decent bar area. The food:  I ordered the California burger cooked medium with the thin cut fries and a side salad with Italian dressing.  One of my daughters had the Chicken Alfredo and the other had a personal sized pizza with black olives.   The burger was cooked as I ordered, but tasted very bland.  It was as if there was no seasoning added to the meat at all.  The fries were chewy and also flavorless.  The salad itself was pretty fresh, but the dressing was bland and they definitely skimped on the quantity. I didn't eat either of my daughters' meals, but the pizza was overcooked.  As I mentioned earlier, my other daughter really liked the chicken alfredo. Although our server was good at keeping our drinks filled, she also hovered while I was reviewing the bill.  At a total of $50 for three meals, definitely not worth it.  I probably will not return to BJ's unless I'm meeting up with some friends to watch football.  Even then, it wouldn't be my first choice."
