Jim S.,"Tacoma, WA",8,38,,2.0,6/17/2013,"I have to agree with all of the poor reviews here.  Admittedly it was only open for a couple weeks when we visited, but the service was probably the worst we have ever had.  The meal took FOREVER to come out, and our server never checked on us, never offered any explanation, or any excuses.  Food was ok, but nothing so unique that you can't get it somewhere else with better service.  Typical mall type restaurant.  Crowded, slow service, and bland. Do yourself a favor and go try a small, family owned local business."
Syndi B.,"Yelm, WA",47,205,15,4.0,10/13/2013,"I love BJs. I have gone several times and have never had slow or terrible service. Granted I typically go shortly after they open when I know it won't be packed. The food is wonderful though. I absolutely love the garlic Parmesan boneless chicken.  Their pulled pork sandwich is moist and tangy. Their fries are very thin, which is unusual, but a nice change from the steak cut fries at every other place. The pot roast is tender and the veggies that come with it are presented beautifully on the plate. I've tried several of their handcrafted non-alcoholic drinks (cream soda, root beer, etc) and they too were good....though not much different in taste than name brands.  FYI- they open an hour early on weekends during football season. There are always games on throughout the restaurant so you can watch some football and eat a nice meal!"
Amanda M.,"Sequim, WA",0,11,1,5.0,5/18/2015,"I have not been to BJs for about four years so bear with me. IF you see avocado egg rolls on the menu, it is a must have for sure. My mom and I used to stop in whenever she visited me. I love the pizzas they make, and every once in a while, this was a place I would frequent when I just wanted dessert. All in all, a good eating experience waiting to happen."
Jennifer A.,"Spanaway, WA",14,11,22,1.0,10/17/2015,"We went to BJs in puyallup for lunch today. We arrived at 1pm, waited for about 10 minutes for a table, and then we were seated. There were two adults and 3 children aged 2 months, 1, and 3. Our order was taken at 1:15pm but we didn't get our food until after 2pm. We ordered a French dip sandwich with no onions, a ahi tuna salad, a kids chicken fingers and a side of mashed potatoes for the 1 year old. First of all, I asked for a cup of warm water to heat up a bottle. This alone took 30 minutes. Then when our food finally arrived over an hour later, there were onions on the French dip, the fries were cold, and we never even received the mashed potatoes. We had ordered two iced teas to drink and when we asked for a refill (yes we had to ask), it took the waitress 10 minutes and she only refilled one of the iced teas and left the second one empty! Oh and we had waited so long that the iced tea no longer had ice and she filled it with warm tea. We had to ask for the manager not once but twice. When he came over to our table (after a good 20 minutes), he just made excuses for why our food took so long, was wrong, and cold. He said due to their being short staffed and a larger party that came in we had bad customer service. Yeah we didn't want excuses. Then he comped the French dip and did nothing else for our extremely horrible experience. Being paying customers we don't care about what went wrong. We just care that we had such a horrible lunch. We spent over two hours at a restaurant to get a salad and a sandwich. Ridiculous! Then when we were trying to leave we had to ask for our bill. It was never brought to us so we ended up having to drag 3 screaming kids who were very unhappy up to the front to pay our bill. We won't ever be returning and honestly you shouldn't waste your time at a restaurant that cares so little about the quality of their food and their lack of customer service."
Dannette W.,"WA, WA",6,14,,4.0,5/11/2015,Food was all good.  Environment was nice.  The manager went out of his way to make sure we felt welcome.  The french fries came out cold and he replaced them with no issues.  We will eat there again.
K R.,"Lincoln City, OR",0,4,,1.0,2/21/2014,Waiting for 20 minutes and didn't received water. The previous time the food was cold and over cooked I'll not be back.
Joe H.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,26,17,4.0,2/18/2015,"Other than the dark atmosphere, this place is an adequate dinner place for family or dates. Extra star for knowing how to make good mozzarella sticks, and having tasty IPAs. Service is nothing special, my guess is they probably aren't good to their employees. Nevertheless tip em good, they're trying."
Dean S.,"Puyallup, WA",111,42,,3.0,2/11/2014,"I have eaten there about 6 times. Every time I have really enjoyed the food. However, getting served and the speed of the kitchen has sucked. 3 of the 8 times we almost walked out.  If you have A LOT of time, go enjoy the good food. Avoid this place if you want regular speed of service."
Allen B.,"Tacoma, WA",5,126,1,4.0,12/24/2013,"My first visit here was about 2 weeks after they had opened. Not impressed. But they will readily comp unsatisfied patrons. I didn't post a review because I wanted to give them some time to work out the kinks. I can happily say they are on the right track.  Very friendly and attentive service. The shrimp tacos had great flavor and a lunchtime bargain at 8 bucks. The burger did the trick and also not a wallet drainer. Beers were frosty cold and tasty. As long as the place isn't slammed, you'll get served in a timely manner."
Sweet P.,"Puyallup, WA",0,50,11,5.0,6/14/2014,"Shea at BJ's is the best!! She was an amazing server and bartender. Not only did she provide OUTSTANDING service to us, she even asked about our weekend plans, and our upcoming wedding! Shea really made me feel special when she asked to see pics of my wedding dress. :) That's about the quickest way to make a gal feel special! Thank you Shea, for leaving a lasting impression. You are a great employee!"
Gerald M.,"Honolulu, HI",10,6,2,5.0,11/28/2014,"Very good menu selection, very good service, and very good quality food. Great selection if beers on tap. A definite place to return   To."
Carrie B.,"Rio Rancho, NM",20,25,57,5.0,10/6/2014,"Went here and wasn't to sure about t because my family had a horrible experience about 3weeks ago. However it was awesome tonight! We were seated fairly quickly and in the section with all the other Seahawk fans, I assume because one of our party was wearing one of their shirts. It was a little loud but my group did participate in the hooting with the ""goals"".  I ordered the California Chicken Club and it was perfect! I loved the garlic mayo and the wedge fries weren't drenched in season salt which is a plus. My group also had a Roast Beef Dip sandwich, and a BBQ Chicken Salad. They both enjoyed their meals as well and the sizes on all of the food was so big we had enough to bring home for leftovers.  Our server, Kelly I think, was awesome. She took her time to joke with us and remembered what we had mentioned earlier in the evening. Our food was super fast and she kept our drinks filled. A++ all around."
Soraya V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",41,36,38,2.0,11/20/2013,"Terrible service! My sister and I went for an early dinner and we were very disappointed. The waitress was sloppy, left us waiting, brought food to our table and we didn't even have utensils, the drinks were not properly made and at one point I asked for a napkin and she took out one that look like she had been using as tissue paper and put it on the table saying; ""oh it looks bad but it's clean"".  The food was good, no complains there, but this place needs a serious service overhaul! I agree with a lot of the previous reviews."
Kaylie Z.,"Puyallup, WA",67,23,4,1.0,1/15/2016,My boyfriend and I went to this location last night. We got seated right away and the hostess was really nice. We sat there patiently waiting for the waitress to come take our drink order. There were 3 other parties that come in after us. All 3 parties that came in after us got served before we did. We patiently waited for about 45 minutes before leaving. Never did the waitress come over to us once. We spoke to the hostess and he apologized to us. I don't understand why they didn't acknowledge us when they weren't that busy and there were 4 waiters. We finally left and went to buffalo wilds wings. Their service is so much better. We usually go to Bj's all the time but last night was the last time we will be going to this location.
Anastasia J.,"Puyallup, WA",9,35,10,1.0,9/19/2013,Today we decided to spend my sons first birthday at Bjs. I was told at the front to let my waiter know that it was his birthday because they do special things for birthdays just like evety other place. I did. I was seated at table 301 with svrck 4 on 9/19/2013 at 5:14pm Im going to guess my server did not belive me because my son looks like he is 6 months old. But I was very disappointed after being told something and it not happening.  He was very pacient with me while I was trying to order my drink and I was very apriciative of that. But he was very short with us. Was not as friendly as I would have hoped and did not tell anyone about the birthday we were celibrating. The food here is wonderful the burgers are one if the best I have had. But I don't think I will be coming back any time soon.
Otto R.,"Puyallup, WA",204,456,209,3.0,6/5/2013,"Gave this place a 3 or average.  I had the balsamic chicken with mashed potatoes and it was pretty good.  Price point was on point as well.   Wife had Santa Fe chicken salad and remarked that she liked it. Things we didn't like was how low the booth dividers,  pretty low,  especially challenging if you have little ones in tow.  Also I get they are trying to figure out capacity with demand but it took us about 25 minutes to get our food at noon.  A little too long for wait at noon."
N C.,"Tacoma, WA",0,15,3,2.0,8/7/2014,"Puyallup BJ's has the slowest service. Regardless of the time of day we've gone or party size, the service is always very slow.  Happy hour apps and drinks are only served in the bar area, too."
Melissa J.,"Puyallup, WA",46,94,159,3.0,6/21/2014,"If you sit at the bar you will get great service. The food is generally consistent but if you bring family in, plan on waiting a long time. The service is never good and always slow. The servers may be friendly but they are spread too thin and only return once in a while, to bring food out it back usually. They have a young staff that needs a little more training."
Jordan M.,"Tacoma, WA",19,9,,1.0,5/16/2014,"Extremely disappointed with our experience tonight. We had a choice between Red Robin and BJ's, we tried BJ's for the first time. WOW what a waste of money! First of all we called ahead to get on the list which was an hour wait at that point, get to the restaurant an hour later and now have a 20 minute wait.  We're seated at our table and waited about 15 minutes before being asked about beverages, and apparently water isn't a given anymore? Whatever. Anyways we ordered appetizers. Took about 30 minutes to get those, whatever. We got avocado rolls and flatbread pizza. The flatbread pizza is comparable to a Tony's Party Pizza for $1 at the grocery store, the avocado rolls we're the only good thing I ate all night. Oh! and we were asked if we'd like to order our meals while we were waiting for our appetizers because apparently we had been waiting awhile already. So we finish the appetizers and we're talking, and waiting..... Waiting some more..... WAITING. NO ONE came to say ""Hey sorry it's taking so long"", ""Your food will be right out"", or ""Can I get you anything else while you wait"". NOTHING.  After about an hour and a half of being there we finally get ours meals, just as we were about to stand up and investigate this wait. Well, the food was not worth the wait. Subpar burgers, tastless pasta, and blah overall. While we were eating our meals we ordered our dessert as well so we wouldn't have to wait again. We order the famous cookie pie. Again, disappointed. It's hot cookie dough with some ice cream....  OH I also forgot to mention we had two small children with us patiently waiting thru all this without any screaming episodes, they were troopers. Needless to say, we will NEVER be back. We also will not recommend to anyone.  *Side note, my fiance ordered a beer while we were waiting to be seated and the bartender served him the wrong beer. When he sipped it he handed it back and said that's not my beer. The lady bartender replied ""Damn, I was hoping you didn't notice"". Classy, real classy BJ's.*"
Cathy F.,"Puyallup, WA",0,8,,2.0,2/21/2015,"Our favorite place for Mac and cheese...NOT ANY MORE!  Used to be gourmet...light and tasty...now, dry and the cheese sauce very salty and gloppy!  Probably won't have it again... California flat bread not the same either...pesto used to be on it...now a ranch sauce... Why do places mess with good things??"
