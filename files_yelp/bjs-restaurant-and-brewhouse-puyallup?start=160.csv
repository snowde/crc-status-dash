Keri G.,"Eatonville, WA",0,4,,4.0,2/11/2015,"It took a little over twenty minutes to get our food.  The hand crafted root beer and cream soda are delicious! I thought the black cherry soda tasted flat. I ordered the bbq lunch platter. The bbq chicken was salty and the bbq sauce on it didn't compliment it well. The bbq pork slider was delicious though. The cole slaw side had quarter size hunks of cabbage heart. Yuck! The wedge fries were well cooked but flavorless. My husband had the chicken quesedilla lunch special. The black beans were very well seasoned. The quesedilla had only a little bit of filling though. He loved the avacado cream sauce on top. For two of us, it only cost $22.15 for lunch. Nice atmosphere. Very nice staff. Will return to see if other menu items are better."
Steve S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,7,,2.0,1/24/2015,"Sat at bar,  Service slow.  Had to beg for simple silverware or salt or a napkin.  Food was lousy.  Won't come back."
Tim I.,"University Place, WA",0,6,1,3.0,9/20/2013,"The hunt for real Deep Dish pizza continues.  I spent 4 college years in Chicago and have yearned for decent deep dish here in the Northwest.  Has anyone found real deep dish? The closest I've seen is San Francisco.  First time to BJs and saw deep dish on their menu. Needless to say I'm still looking.  Not only was it not deep dish (I'd say it's more ""dish"" than deep) but the bottom of the pie was a little soggy.  That being said, the service was good and the flavors on the 5 meat was good and the dough tasted really good."
Jason C.,"Tacoma, WA",38,9,10,1.0,11/11/2014,Nope won't be back..... Kelsey was good.... Cook must have been greener than the sad asparagus that show up on my plate..... Absolutely the worst rib eye ever. Guess I should have stuck with the south center location.
L L.,"Olympia, WA",22,17,17,1.0,11/8/2015,Stopped by yesterday party of 3 I love Bj's is Tacoma but this was very different experience. Very slow service. Our waitress was nice but disappeared for long periods of time. The staff that checked us in and seated us where very snobby and rude. They also skipped seating us and we waited along time to be seated. We eventually had to change our order and get our food to go. I ordered a virgin drink and all they did was pour syrup over ice it also made me throw up I had to fix it with sprite. They may have the same food but this is nothing like the BJ's i have been to before!
Kalli S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,26,16,1.0,11/5/2014,The waitress spilt ranch on half our party. When we asked for more water it came 15 minutes later and she gave it to another table that asked her right then for water. We never got our water after asking again.. the food came out and I didn't get the right plate and my bf didn't get his at all. We walked out because of such bad service. I will never go back.
Jennifer D.,"Tacoma, WA",21,26,18,4.0,6/11/2014,"! Please read this!        I came in for lunch today and I decided to get  the half sandwich and soup or salad.  I ordered the California chicken sandwich which had pepper jack cheese, green chilies, grilled chicken, avocado, Chipotle mayo on toasted sourdough. I found out it not only comes with soup or salad, but it also comes with ether thin fries or wedge season fries. I asked for the think crispy fries and asked for a house salad. I loved everything about my meal. The sandwich was not spicy at all but yet very good. The salad was really good I asked for balsamic vinaigrette and that was awsome I left both of my plates clean. I got all of that a salad, half of a sandwich and fries for $8.50 I thought it was a deal. I would love to go back. Ps. It can get pretty busy."
Renee R.,"Puyallup, WA",74,12,11,2.0,8/2/2015,"Okay, so I can honestly say that I have been to this restaurant several times and each experience has been mediocre at best. What is giving this restaurant two stars is the simple blatant lack of basic customer service. Every time I've eaten here, the servers are not friendly, nor do they go out of their way to ensure that their customers are satisfied. I went here last week with my kids and my friend, and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 40 minutes after that to get our food! Not to mention that the waitress never once checked on us or apologized for the delay. I mean, seriously?!? How long does it take to make a pizookie trio and an appetizer? Maybe I am wrong and the pizookies do take a long time to make, but even so, there is absolutely no reason why our server completely ignored us for nearly an hour, and only came by our table to drop drinks off. I had to stop her at one point and ask how much longer it was going to be since my six-year-old was getting restless. She came back with our food within minutes, and still failed to apologize. She didn't have an out-going personality or have a smile the entire time...I mean, I understand that we all have ""off"" days, but this is your job!! The ONLY thing that keeps me coming back is their amazing pizookie desserts! Yum! Aside from that, I would rather go to any of the other three restaurants surrounding BJ's."
Tricia W.,"Puyallup, WA",17,15,,2.0,7/20/2015,"This is a late post. My husband and I have been here twice this month to meet a group and both times have been horrible. We usually love Bjs. It seems like this location is going down hill, the service is horrible. It seems like the waiting staff maybe stretched too thin...the service was so slow, we could not get a refill and both times our food was mixed up. We may drive out to Tacoma if we decide to go again, unfortunate!"
Rachel G.,"Orting, WA",0,7,,1.0,6/19/2016,"We went here last night for my daughters birthday the service and food was horrible, the place wasn't even packed we placed our order and 40 min later the waitress comes back and tells they are remaking one of the meals because it had been sent to another table.  She came back 10 minutes later and said the manager would be by she never asked us for refills on our drinks when food came out it was disgusting had been sitting under heat lamp and the sandwich that had to be remade was cold along with the fries.  While sitting there we noticed 4 other tables come in and order and receive their food theme was have someone who graduated from Puyallup with you and get service.  Manager came over and did nothing we walked out the only thing he said while twiddling his thumbs and not looking at us was give my daughter a gift card for like $20 really.  We will not be back.  Let me also add I got food poisoning from my side salad which was the only food that came out."
Lissette S.,"Fayetteville, AR",4,33,4,3.0,8/6/2015,"Pretty good. Standard American fare with more healthy options than your typical chain restaurants. I had the Kale and Roasted Brussel Sprouts salad with shrimp; hubby the chicken and Quinoa bowl. Both were good, although not great. Our kiddo wasn't fond of the happy face potatoes, so we will stick with standard fries in the future. Our server was friendly enough, but service/kitchen was REALLY SLOW. I mean, REALLY SLOW. Didn't stay for dessert."
April And PJ D.,"Seaside, OR",1,103,5,2.0,11/1/2015,"Nailbanger Here Again;I recieved a $10 Off a $35 via email and decided to give it a go. We ordered the Potato Skin Appitizer and the BJ Special Deep Dish Pizza.The Potato Skins were O.K. but not worth $10. The Pizza was better but not worth $26.So over all the food was O.K. buy not worth the cost.They have a full Bar, but watch out the drinks are not priced and are crazy expensive.The service was a bit slow over all ,but bearable.The attmosphere is Upbeat and nicely done.They have plenty of well lighted parking."
Teri B.,"Buckley, WA",6,36,12,1.0,2/19/2014,"Once again we tried to go here as my daughter was craving jumbalya. unfortunately the avacado spring rolls tasted old and frozen instead of fresh oh and cold! The pizzas actually came out cool to touch and my grandson would not even eat the mac cheese! what 8 yr old dosn't love mac n cheese. The only thing that came out hot and fresh was the jumbalya. VERY SAD!! Manager did come over after we asked for a different kids meal, they replaced it and took off the spring rolls but still its been over a year you would think this would not be happening it was as if everything waited for the one meal to cook and was just sitting there under the lights. VERY DISAPPOINTED YET AGAIN"
Kenny G.,"Tacoma, WA",45,5,7,5.0,6/23/2015,Back again :) everything is great as usual! Brought an apitite for destruction tonight. Ready to wreck the double burger. Seemed fitting with this perfectly pour  (almost too strong) double tequila sour. Wedge fries for the win with this leaning tower of beef bacon and cheese.
Maddy D.,"Puyallup, WA",1,3,1,5.0,11/25/2014,I LOVE this place!! It's so good! My favorite is the bacon cheese burger with shoe string fries #yummy
Scott L.,"Seattle, WA",49,28,,2.0,5/18/2014,I'm giving this place two stars for the ambience.   They had a Shrimp pasta dish that I requested be substituted with chicken.  I took a couple of bites and pushed it aside.  Extremely over seasoned and you could not taste any of the true flavors if the dish.  Very simply dish with a little olive oil and chicken. Not sure what was used as a season but it was way too much.
James M.,"Spanaway, WA",52,123,44,4.0,12/9/2013,"Love the atmosphere, great prices, and good food.  We have been here two times, and both visits where good. They have a great selection of beers and ales.     They can get very busy at times."
Shannon V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,44,8,1.0,12/5/2013,"Awful service and food! The first BJ's I went to was in Las Vegas and it was awesome! I went to this one with my family and the service was awful- they barely came around to check on how our food was or to fill our water glasses. And the food was terrible, let alone the fact that it took a whole hour for them to bring us our food after ordering! Extremely unimpressed! What happened, BJs??"
Heather A.,"Bonney Lake, WA",75,66,3,1.0,3/30/2015,"Well so disappointing!! We ordered the French dip and soups and salad. Salad came out 17 min after we ordered by itself. Ten minutes later the rest of our food came. My husband's sandwich was burnt so we sent it back and let them know we were in a hurry. Mine was the unlimited which is a good concept but when you have to wait ten minutes to get your next soup or salad it's not worth it. It has been 50 min right not since the time of ordering and still don't the next soup... I don't get what's going on here. Had to add ran out of water twice, calm chowder was good, chili tasted alot like the ale and tortilla soup tasted alot like lime. Don't ever plan on coming back. Last thing I think the lady that brings the food out hates her life."
Marcie L.,"Orting, WA",1,4,,1.0,5/27/2013,"Today was our first and last visit to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.   We were told we would be seated immediately if we chose to sit in the covered, heated outdoor patio.  We still had to wait.  After that it was a continual wait for service.  My husband's fettuccine alfredo had undercooked noodles.  We sent it back.  The waitress offered my husband a cup of soup or salad while he waited for his dish. The clam chowder seemed to be canned. The fettuccine Alfredo returned only to be in the same condition.  This time my husband said never mind he didn't want it back or anything else.  The waitress apologized and said she would have the manager come over to talk to us while she got boxes for my son and my leftover food.  She came back with our boxes, grabbed our card for payment, and came back.  The manager never came to talk to us.  Needless to say the service was poor and the fact that the manager didn't even come to offer an apology speaks volumes.  The waitress said she told him 2x to come see us. My burger and my son's pizza were both good; but we will not return."
