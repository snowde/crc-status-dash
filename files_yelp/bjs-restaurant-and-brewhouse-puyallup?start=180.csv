Tim M.,"Tacoma, WA",3,98,21,4.0,6/16/2013,"Went here yet again, 4th time since the opening. I have yet to go here when it wasn't absolutely slammed to capacity. This place really packs email in! Every time I've gone here the food has been great. I see a lot of reviews complaining about wait times, but if you realize it's a 200 seat restaurant filled to capacity you might understand the kitchen is probably slammed. I'm willing to give them a small pass on an extra 10 minutes if my food quality stays the way it's been. I'm still a fan of this place and will continue to be a return customer."
Rich C.,"Puyallup, WA",9,103,1,4.0,8/13/2013,"Truthfully I'm really not sure why everyone else is banging on this place (for once). We had a large family table and our server Gwen was an absolute joy. All of the food was family style, just right for sharing and we all enjoyed it right down to the last morsel. The beer was decent. It wasn't ""stellar"" as far as beers go, but it was good enough that I'd try it again. Also it was clear they knew we had 3 kids with us at the table and they hurried to get the food out and it came out quick, and hot. The other thing was really nice was my son wasn't 100% sure about their BBQ sauce. They let him try it to make sure he liked it before ordering wings! Give it a shot, folks and I'm sure if you're right time right place you'll go home happy. By the way, skip the lunchmeat if you can. It was a take home, but was spoiled walking out the door. For a 10$ sandwich, they should know better."
MacKenzie M.,"Federal Way, WA",1,8,,2.0,7/11/2014,"Currently sitting here right now. Watching 8 of their employees stand around and chat, while a couple in the bar just walked out because they weren't greeted for over 10 minutes. Great customer service, guys."
Andy V.,"Spanaway, WA",0,3,,4.0,7/8/2015,"Great food, great service.  The fried chicken is the best!  This restaurant is always clean, fast and friendly service.  They have a great rewards member card that builds up over time and just payed for my last dinner!"
Destiny B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,38,2,1.0,9/17/2014,"One star, only because the manager comped our meal! So tonight, we go here (my other half dragging me by the hair, 2 previous, horrible visits, and his ""lets give it another try attitude"") let's just say it was just as horrible as the other 2 visits if not a bit worse! So let's just say this started off not so great from the beginning and gradually got worse as the evening went on! Our server took forever to take our order, my 2 year old was nearly chewing my arm off she was so hungry! Then our food arrived, they bring me the wrong food, and bring my daughter her order which is 1/2 correct. So the server, Nick, takes my order back and even managed to admit he put in the wrong item for me and my daughter. After about 10-12 minutes they bring me out another plate of food, yep, still wrong! At this point I'm done, as server after server (I believe 5), kept bringing the wrong side dish to my daughter. So finally a manager comes over, offers to remake my food again, nope, I'm done! Then wants to give us a card for a percentage off our meal next time we come in, um....nope! We WILL NOT be returning. So she goes off to wherever and comes back and says she comped the whole meal, I told her she didn't need to do that, and she said she wanted to. Okay, fine...but does that mean at that point we get NO service at all? Yep, none! My son and my other half, got zero water refills, zero soda refills, ZERO attention from any staff member! As we left, pis*ed off, the manager and said server, Nick were outside chatting it up! Thanks for the superb service, NOT! I'll be sure and tell everyone I know to avoid this place!!!"
Shannon M.,"San Diego, CA",11,13,2,1.0,6/16/2013,"Worst service I have experienced in a long time. Food came out cold or in some cases didn't come out at all. Had to send back the pizza to be warmed up and that took forever. Manager offered a free Pizookie to make up for the service. It took a 1/2 hour to get the Pizookie and we had to ask someone to go check to see where it was. Terrible and no, they weren't that busy."
Michelle L.,"Halifax, Canada",21,15,3,1.0,2/14/2014,"one of the worst visits to a restaurant ever. The waitress was horrible.  She never brought us water, she reached over our plates and wiped her hands over our food. The seats facing the door are almost impossible.  You can't see the people sitting across from you.  The burger was dripping grease, my fries were not hot and the bacon was barely warm.  The table was dirty and she was LITERALLY turning her head and paying attention to other tables when I was trying to tel her what we wanted. She actually walked over to another table while I was talking. Ridiculous!  She messed up my order and generously messed up. It is not worth your time. I promise."
Patrick B.,"Tacoma, WA",61,6,5,3.0,6/28/2014,"Enjoyed the tortilla soup and the black & blue burger. Good brew, great food. Staff. . . did I mention they have great food?"
Paul C.,"Puyallup, WA",2,11,,5.0,2/1/2014,Went to BJ's for dinner tonight with the family. My son had an Excellent Achievement award from school. This got him a free kids meal. The manager took the time to come to the table and shake his hand and have him an achievement pin to show what he had done. Very classy and much appreciate the manager taking the time to do this. Not to mention that all the food was good and the service was nearly perfect.  We will be back.
Jeannie R.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,10,,3.0,8/11/2013,"I have been here four times since they opened. I have to say they are consistent with SLOW service. Here are a couple of other things to say: My husband and I ordered the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps Appetizer. They did not bring plates for us to eat from so we were both eating over the one main plate. We wanted to ask for small plates but our waitress was not around. We were there after the dinner rush - 8:30 and it took over half an hour for us to get our meal. My husband ordered the boneless chicken wings and was very disappointed. The chicken  was poor quality pressed meat, like a chicken McNugget. The celery that came with it was hot on his plate. Maybe they should wait to add the celery until they bring it out, not let it sit with the chicken under the warming lights. In the bar, the tables are placed very close to each other, so you are practically elbow to elbow with strangers. Beware of the parking lot - the spaces are all for compact cars and you will probably get a door ding. All that being said, I do like some of the other items I have ordered. The stuffed mushrooms are a very good deal. I liked the Shrimp Lettuce Wraps very much. I also like the veggie flat bread pizza. i was also pleased with their happy hour offerings. On a different visit, two of my friends ordered the Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza and were very disappointed with the lack of toppings. One time my husband ordered the Mahi-Mahi Tacos and there was hardly any Mahi Mahi in them."
Jessica J.,"Puyallup, WA",51,78,26,3.0,12/3/2014,"I love BJ's and it's a great place to eat anytime: lunch, dinner or late night Happy Hour. Their menu is pages long, so you can sure to find something you like. I highly recommend the Crusted Parmesan Chicken and the Asian Chop Salad (it's on the EnLIGHTened Menu!) Both are super yummy! I do prefer the Tacoma location as opposed to the Puyallup location. The Puyallup location has been open for about 2 years, but they are still so slow. When we go during lunch, we always tell the waitress that we're on lunch but they're still so slow to get us our food and bill. It's frustrating, because the food is good, but most of the time we'll pick another restaurant altogether. Even today our waitress kept forgetting to come check on us and when she did, she'd forget our drinks or our bill or the fact that we had a To Go Order. If you have time to spare, I'd definitely go, but if not, I'd pick another place."
Heather K.,"Seattle, WA",0,22,,3.0,2/8/2014,"I have liked the other BJ's in Tacoma and Southcenter and have given the Puyallup location several opportunities and it's just ok. There are better options on South Hill. The 3 stars are because it has nice decor, wait staff had been fine and the pazookie dessert is a signature."
Tim T.,"Puyallup, WA",0,8,,1.0,6/28/2013,"Worst burger I have ever had. Server was inattentive and slow.  Took me asking twice to get napkins and silverware after our food had been served to us. I got the beer I ordered after eating half my ""burger,"" if you can call it that. IF I go back I will try the seafood. Not sure I will go back though."
Anthony B.,"Puyallup, WA",3,26,,3.0,4/21/2015,"Still among my favorite foods in town, but twice disappointed by the sports selection.  If you don't subscribe to all major sports packages, you are not a sports bar. Similarly if you air documentary over both NHL and NBA playoff games, you're failing. If you showed sports I'd rate five stars."
Jennifer S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,9,1,1.0,5/3/2013,"SLOW, COLD food, Horrible service.  We went to BJ's for the first time last weekend, everything started out fine until about 45 minutes had past and we were still waiting for our food, and no server in sight. When our food did finally come out (not even all of it because mine was apparently still not ready) it was ALL very cold, like it had all been sitting out for quite a while. When mine finally came, my fries were hot but the rest was ice cold! We let our server know that all the food was cold and asked nicely if he could just take it off the bill because we were not going to eat any of it, nor did we want to sit and wait for another HOUR for them to microwave our meals. I am not a picky eater, but our food wasn't even lukewarm and it wasn't something I was going to let my children eat when God knows how long it sat out.  We will NOT be returning to BJ's."
HP T.,"Puyallup, WA",0,4,,1.0,1/11/2014,"Three strikes! Third visit here and food is sub par and the customer service all visits is the worst in the restaurant business.   Today the bartender was surly, rolled her eyes at customers when they were not looking, and somewhat defensive when questioned about needing more help at the bar on a NFL Divisional local gameday. I ordered the top sirloin rare, steamed veggies, and baked potato.  The steak was over cooked, some of the veggies were mush and others were still raw.  Dessert of a scoop of ice cream with chocolate sauce heated on the side had to be sent back twice before it was correct.  Too bad this BJ's is consistently below average."
Ryan H.,"Haines City, FL",0,6,,1.0,3/14/2014,Been here twice now. Literally the worst service I have ever had! People are horrible! Food average! Managers are a joke!
Marissa L.,"Tacoma, WA",101,283,100,3.0,4/15/2013,"I've loved BJ's food since I lived in California and was finally able to convince the boyfriend to go with me for a late lunch yesterday. When we got there the wait for a 2 top was 15 minutes so we hunted down 2 seats at the bar. The food as usual was yummy. I had the fried artichokes which happen to be a personal favorite and did not disappoint. I also tried their new Black and Blue appetizer flatbread pizza which was good, but could have been a little more crispy. Josh had an asian salad of some kind which he thought was OK, but it took him awhile to locate some of the supposed ingredients (like mango) and it appeared that the kitchen was in a rush as they barely cut the avocado on top leaving Josh to have to cut it on top of the salad (not cool). As to the service it started out fine, and progressively slipped. At the start of the meal I asked the bartender to please split the check as we were going ""dutch"" on this date. I am quite sure she heard me because she said ok and nodded. Every time she added something we ordered she came back with one slip (I thought maybe it was split on the one check so I didn't sweat it and never picked it up). After a fairly long wait for our food I looked at the check to find it was NOT split. By this point our bartender serving us had disappeared. The new bartender seemed to take forever t help us and when he did there was apparently nothing he could do because the check was on the other girls name...While he was attempting to find someone to help she whizzed by the back of me claiming she ""had to go"" and touched my back asking if I was ready to pay. The new bartender then explained I wanted the checks split so she then split the checks and disappeared again. We waited about another 5 minutes to have them collect our credit cards so we could pay and leave. It's a good thing I enjoy their food cause the service left a lot to be desired."
Kyle B.,"Olympia, WA",79,36,4,3.0,6/17/2013,Looks classy. LOOKS. Beer is served warm. Slow service. My chicken parmesean sandy was pretty darn tootin.
Janelle F.,"Puyallup, WA",1,31,,4.0,2/24/2015,"We ended up here for my daughter's birthday, as the Red Robin next door was really busy. I have had a few experiences with really ridiculously slow service at the Tacoma location, so I was wary, but we decided to give it a shot. First of all, no one greeted us for several minutes when we came in, even though one employee was at the front for a short time. We were literally about to walk out and try our luck at Olive Garden when the host walked up. We were seated almost immediately (there was a decent crowd but it is a nice big restaurant) and received attentive and friendly service for the remainder of the visit. We tried the deep dish pizza, and were not disappointed. My husband recently took a business trip to Chicago and was not impressed with the greasy cheese slabs there, so he was very happy with this lighter take. Drinks, salads and appetizers were all served quickly, and our waitress was very cheerful and even patient with the seven-year-old, who threw a couple of odd requests her way. As for the food, the pizza was great as mentioned, the roast beef dip and turkey, ham and bacon sandwich were fine, the chicken wings nice and spicy, and the mozzarella sticks were all that deep fried cheese should be. We were happy with the selection of local brews (Iron Horse Brewery Irish Death! Try it.), and the free birthday pizookie was a nice touch. All in all it was a very good experience, and we will definitely be back. Tacoma could learn a thing or two!"
