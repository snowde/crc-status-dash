Sarah K.,"Tacoma, WA",62,16,1,1.0,5/16/2013,"One star is being kind! My friend and I got to bjs and told we would have a 15 minute wait. 30 minutes later we were sat. Our waitress took our drink and appetizer order.. came back 10 minutes later with our drinks. 10 minutes later she came and took our main order. Over 30 minutes later we finally received our appetizer, cheesy bacon potato skins. Needless to say there was barely any bacon or cheese on them. Our waitress came to our table many times to apologize for the wait at the same time neglecting to bring us new drinks that's had been sitting empty or removing the finished appetizer tray. Once our food finally arrived 45 minutes later my friends calizone was completely doughy. My salad was completely caked in seasoning where I couldn't even see the lettuce. Needless to say worst restaurant experience I have EVER had!!! They need a whole new staff and management! !!! We went to red robin next door and recieved excellent service and food that was prepared correctly I wouldn't waste your time with bjs."
Stephanie K.,"Puyallup, WA",0,2,,1.0,4/24/2013,"Worst service I have ever experienced. Water not brought to entire table, drinks took forever or were wrong, salads that never showed up. Took forever to pay. Food was ok but after waiting that long, who really cares?"
Jessica L.,"Puyallup, WA",0,7,,5.0,5/4/2013,"So we went in tonight. Friday night. And we had amazing service, food and drinks! I don't know why people are being so hard on reviews?? They are still a brand new restaurant! We will be going back soon :)"
Jon T.,"Tacoma, WA",9,232,2,3.0,6/27/2013,"In my opinion, you generally know what you are getting into with a Restaurant like BJ's.  Brewhouse as a name is somewhat of a misnomer.  They ""contract"" out their brewing operations to I think two or three companies.  As a whole though, you could do a lot worse.  Food is fairly consistent, although on occassion we find some variances on some of our favorite dishes between Tacoma, Puyallup, Tukwila, and others that we may visit.  Things like the fish and chips and baked potato can vary based on our experience.  While I appreciate the selection of beer, it is disappointing that the Happy Hour pricing is only available in the bar area.  This unfortunately limits some clientel because of that limitation from having appetizers and drinks at a discount.  The parking spaces at this location are terribly narrow.  I suggest parking closer to the ""road"" that goes through the mall.  You may find a little more room to open your door. Much of the negative comments on this particular location seem to have ironed out over the past several weeks since opening.  If you had a bad experience in the weeks immediately after opening, it may be worth a second look. I do find all the Stalinist artwork a little amusing.  But so long as they continue to have a good beer selection they could put Kim Jung Il on the wall and I probably wouldn't care."
David B.,"Spanaway, WA",6,80,3,1.0,9/28/2013,"I stopped in for the first time.  I believe this particular restaurant recently opened.  As other reviewers have noted, I too was expecting the same quality as the Tacoma location.  I was disappointed.  The service was good but the portion size was very weak to say the least.  Perhaps, there is a kitchen manager in the back obsessed with portion control.  I ordered the lunch ""special"" which was a black and blue flatbread and a salad.  With very few shreds of lettuce I noted a limp and damaged leaf.  This ""salad"" looked more like a garnish and the manager of this place should be ashamed.  The flatbread was tasty but again, very skimp on portion and arrived more as a light appetizer than a meal.  I paid my tab of nearly $20 and left hungry.  I went down the road to Applebee's and had half off food and drinks.  I ordered a double margarita there to put the bad B.J's experience behind me.  If anyone is thinking of visiting this location, you are warned.  Take the trip to Tacoma if you are thinking about sampling the food."
Nik S.,"Puyallup, WA",0,4,,1.0,7/19/2013,"It looked busy, but we waited less than 10 minutes for seating.  The waitress came to our table and told us that since they have a large menu, she will come back to take our order.  I told her I was ready to order drinks now and her attitude changed to one of like I was inconveniencing her.  She brought the drinks 15 minutes later and took our order.  I asked for mushrooms appetizer, a baked potato, hamburger, and a veggie pizza to go.  After what seemed forever, the pizza in a box was brought to our table.  I explained to the different server that brought it out that I was hoping to get the take-out after eating the main meal.   The original server told me that I did not specify that I wanted the take-out after the meal, but she will send it back to the kitchen for them to keep warm.  I asked her where she expected me to store the pizza while I was eating because the table was so small.  We waited again.  Then our appetizer and meal came out together.  I told yet another server that I thought traditionally the appetizer would come before the meal and she told me that the appetizer was written on the same paper as the main meal.  When I finally saw the original server, I asked for some ketchup to which she gleefully said ""Sure!"" and went to the back register area (right behind our booth) and talked to her coworkers for 10 minutes before coming back to our table and snatching the ketchup from the table across from us and setting it down hard on our table.  I don't know what I did to this server for her to act in this manner."
