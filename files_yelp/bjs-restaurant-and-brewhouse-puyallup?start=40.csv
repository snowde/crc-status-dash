Carol H.,"Puyallup, WA",9,124,399,4.0,4/9/2016,"I'm updating my review since our last visit last summer wasn't up to par yet I failed to review it . That visit the service was the worst we'd had at any restaurant in years and the entree salad barely had anything but the greens plus got order mixed up when we finally did get served, ugh. So I'm happy to say yesterdays visit was a pleasant experience given it was celebrating my birthday. We ate in the enclosed outside area which was very nice on a beautiful day. We had two servers, obviously one in training and both were professional. We started off with an app. we'd never had before, the hot spinach dip w/ tortilla chips....really good! Chips hot and fresh and the dip was cheesy goodness with enough art/ spinach. Appetizers are a bit pricey, at 11.50 you'd think it might have shrimp or crab. It was a Friday at 2:00 so we were able to also choose from the weekday lunch specials. I had no clue they offer an UNLIMITED soup/salad for 8.99!! The cool thing is it's not just one type of salad and one or two soups....it's all 3 salads (caprese, ceasar, and blue ch. wedge) and for soups it's 5 offerings (clam chowder, cheesy broccoli, tomato bisque. Ale chili, and chicken tortilla). On the weekends you can do a soup/salad combo at the same price but it's one bowl/one salad not unlimited. It's fun to be able to be able to do a couple different combos before your stuffed to the gills! My first round was caprese' salad (fresh mozz/tomato with diced red on., basil w/balsamic glaze) with broc/cheese soup. Both were really good, although my personal preference is the sliced larger mozz. over the tiny mozz. balls. The broc/cheese soup was super cheesy, like velveta soup with broccoli but I'm not complaining, lol good but really rich! I was getting full on my first round and it certainly wasn't due to the small light salad. My daughter had the chicken strips/fries and they let her order a side ceasar for only 1.50 more and it was a nice size! She was very happy with everything. My hubby had the california chicken club and it was impressive, nice amount of all the fixing's...bacon, avocado, tomato and of course chicken with a garlic aoli he enjoyed. His only mild complaint was the tarter sauce being on the sweet side. I went on to order a second round of soup/salad. This time I did the clam chowder and ceasar. I noticed this time the soup came in a cup instead of a bowl  but that was fine as I knew I wouldn't likely finish even the cup. I must say it wasn't the superb chowder we've had in the past, the problem being the diced potatoes were still firm, eekkkk, disappointing only ate half. My ceasar for some reason was saturated in dressing. Now I like dressing to be on the generous side but this was so heavy the romaine was getting soggy, just way too much so much got left behind. I must mention the drinks. I started with a Ultimate Long Island Ice tea hoping for a little boozy kick, wrong..good but not potent like a good one should be. My daughter changed off between the flavored ice teas and lemonades which was a great deal for 3.25 being able to get refills. My hubby had a craft beer, the new peach one which was refreshing and only 3.95 on the lunch weekday special which ends at 3:00. I had a hefeweizen for my second drink which was really good too. We were all feeling pretty darn full an hour or so later. The servers were very attentive the entire meal and brought me a small complimentary pazookie with a scoop of ice cream to top things off. I had to take it home and enjoyed it later. Those darn cookies are sooooo rich and yummy, wow. Our bill for all this came to 67 bucks, not bad at all. Overall nice experience...the couple mishaps weren't enough to put a damper on the entire lunch. Luckily my first round of soup/salad was a hit."
Amanda O.,"Spanaway, WA",16,1,,5.0,1/11/2017,This is definitely my favorite restaurant to visit. The service is fantastic and the people are all so kind. Not to mention the food is delicious. They've got the best mashed potatoes. It's a restaurant worth visiting. I've never had a bad experience and I always feel the desire to come back.
Jessica T.,"Occoquan, VA",47,20,2,3.0,3/15/2016,The food and service are just fine for a lunch. Dinner is another story. It is always a long wait to get anything.  They have decent food and I LOVE their always crispy thin fries.
Joshua S.,"Tacoma, WA",0,13,,4.0,7/6/2016,"We generally sit in the bar or in their indoor/outdoor seating.  We've always gotten prompt service and cold beer. I wish their menu was laid out more simply and that they paired down their menu so it's not so unruly, but on the bright side there's definitely something in there you haven't tried yet. Good beer and great service.  They're even great with kids and work hard to make things right when they make a small mistake."
Debbie L.,"Olympia, WA",29,26,12,2.0,9/14/2016,It was noise end they should lower their prices even though the company was good it just wasn't enoungh
Tres B.,"Seattle, WA",734,1356,1242,3.0,3/15/2015,"In puyallup, this is a top flight restaurant. It looks beautiful and the service is generally quick. But the food is truly hit or miss. Soe, dishes are spectcular (stuffed mushrooms) while others are intolerably lame (most appetizers) . Also, the beers, which is their calling card, are sub par. That's a bit astonishing."
Jennifer P.,"Puyallup, WA",81,6,,1.0,12/14/2016,"When this restaurant first opened, it was great, large portions, great service. As time has gone on, the service is not so hot, and the food is smaller portions, and last time, it had dirty silverware, so bad, the restaurant starting using plastic! Unfortunate the manager blamed it on a new person who washes the dishes, we that couldn't be the case because there was food literally stuck to the forks, meaning faulty dishwasher, not a person!"
Rachelle S.,"Kent, WA",0,3,,5.0,7/3/2017,"Took my dad here for Father's day, we were able to find a booth in the bar right away! Our drinks took awhile but our waiter was super nice and a manager came over and gave my dad a coupon and a cool glass to take home! Some special they were doing for all the dads. Love their beer selection, would definitely come back!"
Blyth D.,"Federal Way, WA",0,5,8,2.0,4/9/2017,"I have never been to BJ's before. I probably won't be back. The staffs uniforms were dirty (front of the house staff should not be THAT dirty) and the host that sat us looked unkempt and not professional. We sat next to a window that had a really dirty window sill, almost like they never cleaned it. Regardless, I had high hopes because they're Ahi poke and calamari apps were delicious. I had the kale and roasted brussel sprouts salad with salmon. The salad lacked an identity and there was so much going on with the stuff inside the salad, but I will say that the salmon was cooked to perfection. My brother's dish was mediocre but tasty. My sister got the Peruvian quinoa dish which was underwhelming and under seasoned; but like mine, her salmon was cooked well. (if I could I would give the fish station 5 stars.) All of the plates came out dirty and my sister was given a glass with old lipstick marks on it... (she was drinking out of a straw). Now, I don't know that ALL BJ's locations are like this, but I wouldn't recommend the one on South Hill."
Darian B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,27,12,1.0,3/25/2016,"God awful service, or lack there of. Have been here a few times (not my vote), and each time the food has just been terrible and the beers I want are always out.  The location near Tacoma mall was entirely different. Fast and friendly service, and shockingly delicious food."
AngryDiver M.,"Bonney Lake, WA",2,8,13,1.0,10/24/2015,"Service was slow, food ordered was screwed up, after being comped for a free appey we were double charged.  Noticed lots of other patrons waiting long periods for food.   Won't be returning."
Stephanie V.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,10,,1.0,10/8/2015,"Whenever we go to this location we have a pretty frustrating experience. The wait is ridiculous, like others have said WITH a call ahead we are told 15 min and end up waiting 25-30. Not sure what the point of a call ahead is. It took quite a while to get our drinks but once that happened everything came out pretty quick because we ordered everything (drinks an appetizer and dinner) all at once. It took a while for us to get our dessert and the check wasn't correct and it took 15 minutes just to get the check correct. They didn't know how to get $25 off from their own point rewards program. Face palm. Anyways we gave this place a second shot and it's just not worth the 2.5 hour trip. We even had three kids with us. Thank goodness they were good.   Last time we came we sat in the bar and barely saw our waitress  and everything took forever, my food was gross, and the place wasn't even busy. I don't know what the issue is but I can guess it's they don't have enough people staffed because I barely see any worked buzzing around. Other locations do a much better job."
Bill G.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,9,,2.0,4/21/2017,"My wife and I eat at BJ's twice a month and this particular experience was disappointing. Vegetable under cooked, steak Luke warm and fries cold. I expect more for a $81 tab"
Kris F.,"Puyallup, WA",93,3,,1.0,11/1/2015,"My friends and I decided to go have brunch today and we decided to try BJs. That was the worst choice we ever could have made. There was no one in the restaurant which should have been our first clue but we took a seat in the bar anyway. It took almost 45 minutes for our 3 meals to come out even though there was NO ONE in there. We had to physically go to the bar ourselves to refill our water and to get our checks. The waitress was completely rude and they wonder why people hate going there! It's completely ridiculous how even after being open for awhile, this place still can't get their shit together. Honestly if I could have given this place no stars, I would have.  If you want BJs Brewhouse, make the trip out to Tacoma or SouthCenter. You will be much happier at either location."
Veronica M.,"Graham, WA",7,34,17,3.0,7/31/2016,Pizza is great and the service is always nice. But it's time to talk Pizookies- why do they taste like they were made in an easy bake oven??
C M.,"Auburn, WA",35,52,106,5.0,12/22/2015,"Amazing! Our server Tony was attentive and authentic, he suggested delicious appetizers and was quick to refill our beverages. The meal was more than satisfying, it was a welcome relief from the bustle of holiday shopping. This B.J.s is much better than others I have visited. I would recommend this place to any who want a slightly pricier meal with superior service and impeccable taste. Thank you B.J.s!"
Destiny P.,"Shoreline, WA",66,19,8,2.0,8/31/2016,"I've been to BJ's a couple of times now because there are only so many options being out in Puyallup for late night snackage. Each time has been mediocre at best...the food is ok, but in my opinion for the quality of it its over priced and nothing special. The customer service is REALLY hit and miss. There have been multiple times when I've gone in and the staff seemed like they just didn't want to be there [which I understand, I have days like that too, but being in the service industry you learn to fake it for your guests]."
Carlos O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,49,,5.0,10/2/2016,BJs has always been great. They have a great menu with lots of selections. Kind of feels upscale without having to dress up. The only downside was the last time we were in there they had on the Husky game.
Greg C.,"Puyallup, WA",12,54,22,2.0,7/13/2016,"We live right around the corner so it's very convenient for us - and the food is pretty good, but we have literally never had good service from the staff here. Fool me once, shame on me.. Fool me 10 times, I'm really an idiot for continuing."
Tina M.,"Puyallup, WA",17,18,12,5.0,7/21/2016,"One of the best places to go for a date night or family. They're great and give me military families their discounts & managers are always friendly and willing to help to explain anything that comes up with your order staff is always friendly and helps with any needs that you might have. One of the best items on their menu is the twisted BLT salad, their burgers are always juicy & barbecue ribs are always flavorful."
