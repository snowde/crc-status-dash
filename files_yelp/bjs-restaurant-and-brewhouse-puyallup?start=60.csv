Charles S.,"Graham, WA",8,4,2,2.0,2/21/2016,Egg rolls were a joke for $11. Southwest salad got a double hit from the spice weasel today. Cooks and wait staff get a D today.
Paris C.,"Puyallup, WA",20,54,77,4.0,10/27/2014,"EDIT:( manager just came out to appologize for the pizza being so small, said it wasnt normally like that. He gave me a giftcard and told me to come back and try it again! Not sure if he saw my review or he realized how tiny it was but im greatful for the customer service and im changing the stars to 4/5 instead of 3) Very average food for an expencive price. Good thing is you can make their hand tos sed pizzas vegan if you ask for no cheese and no butter on the crust. I got the vegetarian pizza and it was tiny tiny for 13 bucks. Flavors were OK but didnt fill me up at all. It reminded me of an appetizer.  All of my omnivore friends rated their food as very average as well. Pasta dishes come with a ton of pasta. But pizza..... so small :c atleast adjust prices. Dont come an hour before close if you expect good service. Ours kinda sucked, she expressed annoyance of us. Like we were a bother."
Jazmine L.,"Columbus, GA",0,17,17,5.0,11/11/2015,"Well its veterans today so free is always good. The food was awesome after i finished my food i even helped my husband finish his regardless of the fact that i was full. I had the rootbeer babyback ribs with coleslaw. Those ribs was so tender they fell of the bone and everybit of the that flavor was on point. My husband had siracha, chicken, and bacon macaroni and cheese pasta. That was super delicious  i would def. Recommend BJ's and I would gladly return anyday!"
Nesh B.,"Puyallup, WA",92,8,,2.0,9/4/2016,"Great atmosphere. Great service. Great drinks. Um...... I ordered the deep dish ziti and my boyfriend ordered the jumbo spaghetti and meatballs. The cook is completely against seasoning pastas, it hurts my heart. Pastas need a little extra season for it to stick and I don't think the cook is aware of that because the pasta came out extra plain."
Michael H.,"Puyallup, WA",3,164,274,1.0,10/19/2015,"Nothing towards BJ'S, it's just that our night was ruined due to a lady blowing her nose at the table across from ours. Why do people think that blowing there nose at the table is acceptable?  It's nasty, and no one wants to hear buggers being blown while eating. People, stop doing this!!!!"
Heather L.,"Puyallup, WA",150,24,29,1.0,9/2/2016,Always a crappy long ass wait to get your food....been here for 40 mins with a baby in tow....stillllll waiiitttinnngggggggggggg for a bowl of chili......
George N.,"Graham, WA",18,3,,1.0,8/27/2015,"*Won't make that mistake again. * So we decided to try out BJ's for my Birthday dinner.  *Upon arrival they told us it was about a 15 minute wait not to bad for 6 pm.  *We were seated at about 6:20 *Took drink orders pretty quick drinks came about 10 minutes later not too bad.  * Took our order about 15 minutes later in part because we weren't ready.  *After about 20 minutes noticed it was quite cold with a arctic draft coming down the wall and onto our table. Mentioned it to the waitress who was quite nice. She said she would talk to a manager to see if anything could be done and never heard anything nor did the arctic draft from the AC stop or even slow down.  *About 45 minutes into waiting for our food my children boy age 7 in shorts and T-shirt and girl 9 wearing a lite summer dress were both complaining they were freezing. My wife and I were also both cold by now. It is important to note I DO NOT as a rule ever get cold.  *Finally about an hour after ordering, our food showed up kids first followed by my wife and I about 1 minute later.  *My wife ordered the Mediteranian Chicken Taco which she said was very good. This may be the best bang for your buck here. * I at the waitress' recommendation ordered the Ribs which I chose to pair  with the White Cheddar Mashed potatoes and the Clam Chowder. The clam chowder never came until my meal was delivered. We asked about it and it was promptly brought out and was told that This is unacceptable I will take care of it by someone whom I thought may have been a manager. I mistakenly understood that to be there would be some adjustment to out tab. NOT THE CASE. As for my meal the chowder was only okay definitely nothing special at all. The potatoes were clearly instant and where underwhelming. The ribs were only a minute or two from being completely overcooked. They were on the edge of being dry definitely not the moistness one would expect from good ribs. These ribs were okay tasting nothing special. Overall my meal was just short of completely disappointing.  It took way too long to get a box for what was left of our food and the check.  I definitely think they were understaffed. One of the servers dropped a plate on the floor near us, sauce was splattered everywhere when we left about 20 minutes later it still had not been cleaned up.  It is unlikely we will return to the Puyallup BJ's."
Joseph B.,"Spanaway, WA",43,1,,5.0,2/6/2016,"Our group of five was waited on by a wonderful young woman named Rose. She has been personable and fun, while also being very on point with our orders and drinks.  A mistake happened with our pizza and Daniel, the manager, was very prompt. As people who've worked in food for years, we have been exceptionally impressed.  Of course, the Pizza, burgers, beer, and mozzarella sticks were wonderful."
V C.,"Puyallup, WA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2017,My son and I decided to have dinner at BJ's on Southhill we were seated nobody showed up everybody else around us was served the people in front of us behind us but not us is this OK that a black woman and a white child are not served is BJ's now only serving white people I thought those days were long behind us I guess not!!!
Kim h.,"Puyallup, WA",22,17,15,2.0,5/20/2016,My husband and I have eaten here many times and had consistently good food and service.  Today we ate with our son and daughter.   Our food was mostly cold and not that tasty.  The service was less than desireable.  Our dirty dishes sat in front of us for 30 minutes. Really a disappointing visit.
Joel R.,"Spanaway, WA",133,131,32,5.0,5/22/2015,Ok here we go. I had to really think about this. To start the hostess team was really great and had wonderful  customer service. It didnt make sense that there was like 8 empty tables and there was still a 15 min wait but it was friday. The food was great though. I got the california burger and my wife got the cajun pasta and it was actually pretty good. My only comment would be that  it was pretty chotatic with the staff and it wasnt very organized. But you won me over with the food and your girls in front.
Christi H.,"Seattle, WA",20,53,27,4.0,6/12/2015,"How long has Puyallup needed this?! An upscale casual dining experience. Great ales, good happy hour specials ($5 lemon drops) food is good. This is not slammed out in a rush so expect a little wait. Ahi tuna is amazing along with Fish and chips. My husband thought they were the best he had anywhere!"
Sara T.,"Muskegon, MI",25,144,1072,5.0,6/26/2014,"DO NOT expect the pizza you see in the picture.  I can not stress this enough: DO NOT expect your pizza to look like the one in the picture.  It is NOT a deep dish pizza, and definitely not as ""deep"" as in the picture.  It's still a good pizza, just not what I was expecting.  So we continue our search for deep dish - We're from Michigan and were big fans of Chicago Pizza.  There's just not anything close here. Anyway...Moving on. Even though it's not a true deep dish pizza, I'm still VERY surprised that this place is rated so low!  This has actually become one of our favorite places to go out to eat and have a couple of drinks.  The pizza may not be a Chicago pizza, but it's still a darn good pizza. We've been here probably 5-6 times and have never had bad service.  (HUGE shoutout to our awesome waitresses: Samantha W, Elsy P, Rebecca P!).  We don't go in expecting service to be quick - It's a big place, is busy, and it's not someplace where you're going to get your food in ten minutes. The last time we went, the boyfriend got a burger instead of pizza and it was okay - I'm going to stick with pizza though.  They tried to put ""grill marks"" on the burger and it ended up being medium on the inside (how he likes it) but with a burnt outside (NOT how he likes it).  It wasn't bad, but I don't think we'll be getting it again. The drinks...Ohhhhhhhhhhhh the drinks.  :)  I'm a big fan of the watermelon mojito but I also recently tried the Pomegrante Paradise (so good!) and our new favorite drink is the Irish Root Beer: Bailys, Jameson, and root beer. This tastes like root beer and cream soda had a baby and it's beautiful.  Don't be fooled - There's a LOT of alcohol in it but it doesn't taste like it.  We will go back again JUST for this drink...Or eight.  :) Again, pretty surprised at the low reviews, but we like it."
Joe A.,"Puyallup, WA",70,62,123,4.0,5/23/2014,"I guess my BJs story begins in Summer 2012, in Carlsbad, California. After spending an amazing day at Del Mar Beach, we discovered an awesome, California home, restaurant called BJs. We were astonished by the awesome food and how we wished they had one back home in Western Washington.  A year or so after that, we finally moseyed our way out to Tacoma for my birthday celebration at the much anticipated BJs Tacoma. And let me say, I was thoroughly embarrassed and mortified at the terrible experience we had there to the point of me losing their business forever. So, I guess I was pretty skeptical about eating there tonight, especially since the mixed reviews seem limitless. Earlier tonight, we walked in to a great service and atmosphere and literally no wait to be seated which was a fantastic upgrade from their crappy Tacoma location. All of waitresses were very kind and courteous. I started with the appetizer of chicken wings which were really good :) And believe me, I KNOW chicken wings! Then for my entree, I got a deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage! It was delishhhhh. And then to end things off, I got the new salted caramel pizzookie and that, my friends, will hit every single sweet tooth in your body :) Again, the atmosphere and service was superb which is huge upgrade from Tacoma. My one and only con, is that it was a tad slow, but that's all. Overall, I found a new respect and love for this franchise. Love it!! Totally recommend!! Oh and I dunno why but the pics below are from my accidentally deleted review of their Tacoma location and I don't know why they showed up here :/"
Nataly B.,"Seattle, WA",1,29,2,1.0,3/5/2016,"After the movies me and the family came in for a late dinner about 9:00. I've ate here many times, and today I have never seen the women's restrooms so filthy!  Toilet paper roll stretch out in the stalls, no napkins in each slots. No soap are you kidding me? I've seen Mc Donald's bathroom cleaner than this. Is it because it's late in the day? Im not sure but a clean bathroom is important to have especially a establishment like BJ's."
Andrei M.,"Seaside, OR",0,7,,1.0,12/26/2016,"I came here with a small party of four and we were told the day staff was ""switching out"" for the night staff and that the wait time would be longer. I was given an estimated wait time of approximately 20 minutes. Somewhere around 40 minutes later we were still waiting and watching as the hostess called out for the same three parties. None of these people were even in or around the restaurant and never came to the hostess podium. (One of them was a party of 9! They could have seated a third of the people crammed into the lobby if they'd have moved on.) As more and more guests arrived the hostess continued to offer the same poorly crafted excuse that there was a staffing switch (that apparently lasts for nearly an hour) and the wait time was about 20 minutes. She still called out for the same 3 parties. This was exacerbated by the fact that the ""waiting area"" consists of two tiny benches filled with other people already waiting, so my family was forced to stand directly in front of the hostess station, near the drafty rotary door, in everybody's way. The hostess never smiled, clearly didn't want to be at work, and was short and unconcerned with our and others' wait time and inquiries. She didn't even respond to my wife's questions other than to raise her eyebrows. That said, with such little faith in the way this place treats its prospective guests, we decided we would be far better served else ware, where the business actually appreciated our patronage.  The staff at this facility during our visit seemed to be not only unprofessional, but blatantly disrespectful to their customers and showed absolutely no signs of caring or having any interest in good service. Everyone has long and/or bad days at work, but thats never been an acceptable excuse where I've worked.  What pushed me over the line and ultimately caused me to leave this blunt and painfully honest review (I'm not this hard on folks if I see they're trying) and vow never to come back to this place or recommend it again was the fact that even our children recognized how rude the portly and ill-tempered hostess was and asked why she purposefully ignored their mother, who had been very polite to the hostess and stood patiently at her podium for almost a full minute awaiting a response before I told her we were leaving. There are no excuses for that kind of behavior.  My advice is to avoid this terribly managed place at all costs. Don't subject your family to such an apathetic group of disgruntled employees. Clearly the people that work here don't want to, and at least during our visit they weren't even trying to hide that fact."
Moda L.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,2.0,3/12/2016,"This was our second and will be the last dining experience here.  Tonight we had a party of 18.  Being a Saturday it was busy.  From the time we began to place food orders to the arrival of all 18 meals was around 45 min.  Focusing only on our family, the food was average. One order was the $12.95 portabello mushroom burger that was cooked nicely done.  Fries were average at best.  The Garlic Chicken Pesto pizza $15.75 was a bit smaller than expected.  For some unknown reason, the shape resembled an eye or a fish rather than round or square. Some of the edges were burnt to a crisp. Flavor was good yet seemed to be lacking the main and therefore the reason it was ordered...Garlic. The garlic flavor was weak, undetectable. Another order was to be gluten and dairy free including sauces, meats, toppings, etc. Desiring to eat something other than salad this was ordered piecemeal. This special request was repeated to the server at least twice, and she acknowledged each time. Beforehand research was done reading the tiny online food sensitivity menu. It would have been useful to be offered a separate menu for food sensitivities during ordering, yet that was not an option we were told about.  So with limited options from the main menu, a separate plate was prepared with a half cup broccoli, and two or three deli thin slices of ham.  Too bad the ham was very salty and not eaten.  Then on this order the kitchen goofed and added someone else's asparagus with butter (dairy) onto the no gluten no dairy plate.  The server returned the order to the kitchen returning the plate with removed spears leaving a noticeable gap between the broccoli and deli ham.   We did not expect the lemonade to be so sugary, so requested extra water.  The waters did take some time to get refilled, and my original lemon had been squeezed dry three glasses ago. Didn't want to make a stink about it as our busy server Hailey M. had her hands full.  Overall our party had a nice time chatting.  Yet the overall visit left a bit to be desired.  Next year's yearly gathering will be held elsewhere."
David W.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,,3.0,6/21/2016,"My boys took me out for Father's Day. We ended up at bj's. No wait. Service was decent and the food came to us relatively fast. I had fish and chips and my boys had hamburgers. I enjoyed my fish and chips. Was it the best, no but was edible and the boys enjoyed their hamburgers. The bill came and wasn't bad. Would I go back? Yes. But not my favorite place I ever went.  But for the price,you can't beat a good sit down meal and plenty of tv's to watch sports."
Darvey S.,"Seattle, WA",0,41,4,3.0,8/10/2015,Went there for lunch Saturday at 12:15.  They were not busy but lunch took forever. Especially considering I ordered a salad and my daughter ordered Clam Chowder.  This has happened at this location before to us.  They need to take lessons frokm Tukwila.  They are much quicker. Jerimiah did a great job on our service. Very polite!
Nayoung K.,"Auburn, WA",315,35,37,3.0,6/11/2015,"Very busy restaurant for sure. Great looking restaurant inside and out. However with the food, it's either a really good hit, or a really good miss. Most appetizers are very small in portion, but no where near inexpensive. The appetizers cost just as much as a regular entrée!"
