Meagan K.,"Graham, WA",0,10,16,5.0,3/27/2014,"My fiancé and I have been here twice now, first time we ordered pizza - might I say the most delicious pizza I've had in years! The second time we both ordered burgers which were also amazing.  I'm not sure if they have new bar staff, but they aren't consistent with the flavors. Don't get me wrong they still taste good, but I ordered a hurricane and it came out blue! Their drinks are a bit pricey compared to other restaurants of the same nature, but they actually put a fair amount of alcohol in them.  So overall this is my favorite place in the area right now!"
Tony H.,"Olympia, WA",0,9,,2.0,11/3/2016,"Tried to seat us in the patio area, which was not very inviting.  No one else was out there and it felt like a school cafeteria setting.  We decided to sit inside.  The atmosphere seemed kind of impersonal, like they really didn't care whether we were there or not.  The food was okay, but it didn't make us want to go back for more.  Next time we're in Puyallup, we'll probably choose another restaurant for lunch."
Meghan M.,"Buckley, WA",19,5,4,1.0,11/5/2015,"This was my first time at this restaurant and I don't think I will be returning. I had their queso siracha dip and their chicken, bacon, siracha Mac n cheese. I guess I had a theme going. The dip was ok but if you are a siracha enthusiast you will probably find this lacking. Then the Mac came. Penne pasta to give it that pretentious air, no siracha at all, some sort of yellow oily liquid that barely kept the dish from being completely dry and bland chicken, broccoli and bacon. So what does this intrepid siracha loving preggo do? Ask our very nice server for a bottle of siracha, dump my left over queso on my plate and finally get what I was looking for. Kinda. I'll go back but only if I get to supervise in the kitchen."
Justin Z.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,4,,4.0,10/27/2015,"I tried this place the other night and it was pretty good, I had the calamari app and it was cooked perfectly. I can't tell you how many time I have gotten calamari at a bar at it was rubber so that was a good start.  I then ordered the bison burger, it was a little pink so if you have a weak stomach you might want to stay away from this one. It was really good tho, I give this place a solid 4 stars."
Richard H.,"Graham, WA",325,1203,2707,1.0,12/24/2013,"Sorry, but wasn't impressed with this place last time I went here (December 18th), But will probably go back and give them another try.  with the Deep Dish Pizza- The works minus mushrroms and Olives plus Pineapple and  Red Onions, my wife went with the Bison Burger and since my Birthday was near, got the Pizookie which was REAL good. For drinks, I went with a Blonde first, then their Harvest Hefeweizen- both were real good.  The server was real nice and real good as well. This is our second time here, last time I remember getting a Calzone and I wasnt to impressed with it as I had better Calzones elsewhere. (I felt it should of had more toppings in it)"
Chelsea W.,"Puyallup, WA",0,16,,1.0,1/16/2016,"I'm so mad at this place! We sat and waited for over an hour, to find out we had been paged 20 minutes ago, but the pagers are broken!!!! And the service wasn't even much better! Horrible experience"
N L.,"Tacoma, WA",0,13,3,2.0,11/18/2016,"I've never had a problem with dining in the restaurant, but half my order was missing from curbside pick up. And they didn't even start my order until the scheduled pick up time."
Worldly F.,"Seattle, WA",2,22,5,2.0,4/16/2015,"Great service, bland food.  Despite the huge menu, BJ's proved to be lacking what it needed for a repeat visit. We shared the watermelon salad which was delicious! I wish I would have ordered 3 of those.  20 min wait for food. The bf ordered a the california burger, I did the maui porkchop. Mediocre at best. Lacking flavor in both dishes. The white chedder mashed potatoes were tasty but super dry.  They make their own soda, root beer and beer.  Our bill was about 50$for 2 ppl.  Our waitress was friendly and we never needed to ask for anything."
Dave H.,"Puyallup, WA",3,20,3,3.0,4/7/2016,"We've been to this location several times and we will probably be back but I hope they can improve on their product because there always has been 1 or 2 things not up to par on each visit. Today we had excellent service from the host and our server Leslie but the burgers bun was rock hard and there's no reason that should of been sent out by the kitchen. The other food was very good, my wife had spaghetti and meat balls which was excellent. They always make things right and hopefully things will improve. We will be back and update Yelp."
Jhoana R.,"San Diego, CA",31,48,99,3.0,4/5/2015,My husband and I love bjs we've been to the ones in San Diego and the ones in San Antonio and this location is exactly like the rest of them nice service clean bathrooms great food! I always get the mushroom pizza and my hubby loves their shrimp scampi
Leslie P.,"Puyallup, WA",35,78,20,3.0,12/20/2015,"Had our company Christmas party here last night Ordered the seared ahi salad, beware menu picture is NOT what they serve you. So you will have to ask for them to serve you a proper serving of Ahi as well as the dressing on the side as ordered, Also the baked ziti, servings vary some are half of the full picture again on the menu, and served varied portions to the same table. This is a kitchen training problem. Some Servers are indifferent. Pardon me that if you serve me a plate that is not what I ordered your answer should not be, I am not your waitress.  This only served to solidify you are not a server in a service industry and you have just alienated a customer by putting the burden of finding our waitress for a 20+ person party on the customer.  I did not hear 1 rave on any meal served.  BJs insert any excuse here________. The bread served with the baked ziti I am told was blah hard terrible, and yes my salad was finally fixed well into the meal. Have to say very disappointed, will not return. 3 stars is for its a large place with sports on TV's. But the other choices that surround around here are better. Olive Garden, Red Robin, and Famous Daves, numerous Great Thai food places, I think that if you are a big place like they are you should be properly staffed for your reservations, but who am I kidding I am not a restaurant manager. Well I did not choose this place but I went in open minded. But I think that you've succeeded in 10-15 people not returning and not providing good reviews of the service and food. Do the math, a large amount of money was spent on this party to be this disappointed. I wish we had read the reviews before coming because it is obvious everything I've noted here has been listed previously. Bad service, dirty silverware, not good food. Bam. Spend your money and time elsewhere."
Terry K.,"Puyallup, WA",0,6,,1.0,5/1/2016,"Three strikes you're out. All three visits were the same. Slow , inattentive service, horrible greasy fast food quality food that's seriously over priced, and their home brewed beer sucks! No need to ever return, shame on me for giving BJ'S this many chances ..."
Koji B.,"Seattle, WA",3,40,62,3.0,3/18/2015,The deep dish pizza that I had was the supreme. All the ingredients were fresh which was great  but the pizza lacked sauce it was very dry making it hard to eat. I asked the waitress to bring some marinara on the side because it was dry. She ended bringing a thimble full. Their IPA was good and the service was friendly.
Taylor T.,"Southwest Portland, Portland, OR",2,5,1,2.0,3/4/2016,"Just about as I expected along with the bartender that would not shut up. He kept talking and complaining about the bus boys. More annoying than unprofessional, but nevertheless annoying. Food was mediocre."
Heather L.,"Saint Robert, MO",8,4,6,4.0,3/29/2015,"Great service, great food, great beer options. Perfect American spot. Had light menu options."
Jessica M.,"Renton, WA",135,3,1,5.0,4/13/2016,"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here this evening. The waiter, Nicholas, was incredibly patient with my colleagues and I when we were deciding on what to eat. He checked in on us a few times during our meal to make sure everything was tasting great from start to finish. Thank you for your patience and kindness, Nicholas!"
Zelda Z.,"Olympia, WA",101,195,425,4.0,1/10/2014,"I love going to BJ's. I typically visit the Tacoma location, but I was anxious to see how the newest location measured up. The layout is very similar to Tacoma, although there are a few distinct differences in the décor. It seems like the Puyallup location is a little more dim than the Tacoma location, and I really like that about the restaurant. It creates a certain ambience. As with all BJ's location, there is a separate bar area with plenty of seating or plenty of tables and booths in the spacious dining room. If you want to watch the game on television, I recommend sitting at the bar for the best view. They even have free Wi-Fi. No matter when I go, there is always a good crowd at BJ's. They have a huge menu with pizza, appetizers, salads, burgers, steak, chicken, desserts, and not to mention all of their specialty beer/ale. The pricing is very reasonable, and they offer a discount for military service members. There is also a rewards program called Premier Rewards which will allow you to accumulate points that can be redeemed for food and beverages. They also recently launched a mobile app that can be downloaded and customers can place dine-in orders in advance of arriving at the restaurant, access a preferred waitlist and view wait times, and even pay the bill directly from the phone. I've always had good service at BJ's, and today was no exception. Great food, fun atmosphere, reasonable prices, good service, and a rewards program...what more could you ask for?"
Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",504,559,1042,4.0,5/20/2013,"I think I like the Tacoma BJ's better but this one's alright, only because it's closer to home. I didn't even go to BJ's ever in my life until this year actually. I am sad I didn't discover it sooner!  Now, what I really like about this place is their cocktail drinks! Yumm much? I had some kind of berry mojito awhile back, ordered a strawberry splash [I think it was called] recently with another side of Raspberry Lemon Drop. The Strawberry Splash was amazingly sweet, definitely was in the mood for a blended alcoholic beverage but the lemondrop was ehh... too hard on the taste. I also ordered a ""half"" order of boneless wings (Which is great because I don't want the whole 10 pcs by myself! Sitting at the bar is fun [just turned 21 this year]. By myself, not so much maybe but... I think the bar is an okay place for me to sit around when I feel like being alone rather than occupying a huge booth all to myself... catching peoples' attentions thinking, ""She's by herself..."" Definitely will be stopping by once in awhile after work for a drink or two. Oh I forgot, I was so caught up in my memories of sipping delicious cocktails, the service... was a 2-3 stars worth. The guy who eventually attended to me was super nice and friendly... but it took at least 10 minutes of me sitting there looking like an idiot until someone came to take my order!! Other than that, things were alright."
R M.,"Brea, CA",2,42,22,1.0,4/21/2015,"Poorly managed Resturant. Bar drink service was fast Understaffed One busser for entire main dining room. Food from kitchen very slow. Soup Luke warm, delivered slow Need runner for kitchen Noticed greeter/receptionist delivering desserts and filling waters People waiting to be seated and tables not bussed  How's that pizza? Asked by mgr? Observed manager having to comp two desserts Observed wait staff having to apologize twice to different tables. Get your act together BJ,s. Get the right management and train your staff. I will not be back to this location."
Keith K.,"Puyallup, WA",4,298,5,3.0,7/15/2016,"Just OK....The prices are on the high side for what you get. Be careful to not mention if you really like a menu item because they tend to remove those quickly for some reason. We learned this after having our third ""favorite"" item removed from the menu. The service is average--nothing really to complain or brag about. But they do have fresh-brewed ice tea. However, now that I complimented it they may remove it form their menu..."
