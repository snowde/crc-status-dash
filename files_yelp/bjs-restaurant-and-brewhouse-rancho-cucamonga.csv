Nishtha P.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,42,77,4.0,1/4/2018,"Vegetarian Options: BJ's is a great restaurant chain for vegetarians and people that are looking for some calorie friendly options while still being able to go out with their friends.  The pizzas are great of course, but my favorite item now is the barbacoa cauliflower tacos.  They are full of flavor AND conveniently on the ""skinny"" menu.  #winning more room for beer.   Drinks: BJ's has their own beers and they are pretty good for a major chain.  I like the blends the best (a snakebite for example is a dark beer and pear cider poured over eachother).   Service: We had a great waiter this last time we went. His name was Jerimiah and he was very warm towards our weird sense of humor.  Loved him!"
Diana C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",268,63,45,4.0,12/30/2017,"4 stars because the food was a bit different than usual. The brussel sprouts were a bit hard and the CA flatbread had long strips of bacon rather than the usual bacon bits.  Nothing terrible, just different.   I will give Esteven R 5 Stars though. He's been my server multiple times and always gets it right and has a great attitude whole doing it. Great personality, always ready to refresh water, drinks or any other necessities.  Never feels overbearing or like he's trying to hard just nice, consistent service. Thanks Esteven for always making our time at BJS a nice experience."
Jay M.,"Dallas, TX",1,12,,1.0,12/15/2017,"Rude and disrespectful to my table. Wanted to celebrate our Christmas dinner without issues  and they start to threat to take our table away. Cause they don't believe people can be late and can't find parking. Then they send a different host to tel us they going to ""have to "" take our table. They told us it was fine.  Side note: there's two empty tables Around us and they still want ours??  Killed or vibe 100% and now no one wants to order food or more drinks..."
Jenn N.,"Brentwood, CA",722,778,894,4.0,12/7/2017,"We had a large group and when we first arrived, we saw clusters of people standing around waiting. We were pretty sure we would have an hour long wait, or more. We put our name on the list and noticed an outdoor patio area that looked mostly empty. One of the members of our group checked to see if we could get service out there. They set us up, turned on the space heaters and we were seated! Our server was fantastic. He kept everyone's order correct and was happy to separate our bills. Our water glasses were always refilled promptly. For the number of people in our group and it being a busy evening, our food came out rather quickly. I was in kind of a weird mood, so I ordered the best beginnings appetizer platter. I had hoped that some people would help me tackle the thing but everyone was shy and I was stuck with 2,200 calories to myself. The buffalo tenders were moist and carried a medium kick. The avocado egg rolls were my favorite thing on the plate and who knew they would still be good the next morning? I ended up taking most of it back to my hotel room and was happy munching on it the next day, even though I didn't have a microwave. I also ordered the golden beet and arugula salad. I was kind of disappointed, because the beets were almost nowhere to be found. That was absolutely my only nitpick of the evening. We had a wonderful dinner and experience."
Maglyn l.,"Santa Rosa, CA",39,49,4,3.0,12/31/2017,Burger was okay. A little greasy.  Nice server.  Price was really good - Happy Hour prices (not during HH but HH prices when a football game is on)
Russell Z.,"Fullerton, CA",1157,362,319,4.0,8/3/2017,"BJ's is always an interesting experience. Despite being dimly lit on the inside, it's not an intimate experience, but rather a one-size-fits-all. You can find college couples here, college friends here, working professional adults, families, even infants and everything in between! I ordered a large pizza which happened to be 50% off the normal price and opted for something really cheesy and topped with mushrooms, and also got a house IPA, which was really good. The girlfriend opted for something along the lines of a flight, but BJ's calls them a ""taster"". Semantics, it's all the same, right? Check came out nicely, and BJ's has a rewards program that customers can sign into from a mobile app (most convenient). BJ's now offers delivery and pickup services too, so that's an option. Cheers."
Kathy J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",67,20,,1.0,1/1/2018,This is for their curbside service. Don't order curbside here! We got to the restaurant. They didn't have our order ready as promised. It took another 30 minutes to get our order. Then we paid for our order with a gift card and told them to put the balance on the credit cards. Instead they charged our credit card and didn't apply the gift card at all. So we had to go in the restaurant and fix that. It took us 1 whole hour to finally get our food and everything corrected. Waste of time!
Stephanie L.,"Fontana, CA",0,12,,4.0,1/2/2018,Had my birthday dinner here. We all had a good time. The food was great and our server was awesome. Wish I knew his name. The only bad thing was that we never got our dessert. I think our server went on break because we waited and waited and could tell one other server wanted us to leave lol. So we just left. We will be coming back for sure. :)
Diana T.,"Fontana, CA",187,19,20,1.0,7/13/2017,"I used to love this place! When I was the PTA President, I even had fund raisers here.  This past Monday was like a completely different restaurant! We were celebrating my kids dads birthday (who past away a few years ago). When we were seated, we waited 10 minutes before even being greeted, while the manager just stood right by our booth, on the stairs, basically watching the restaurant, clueless. It doesn't get much better from there. I had to practically shout at him to get his attention so we could finally place our drink order.   This place is so dirty and dusty. The chandelier over our table looked like it belonged in Disneylands hunted house. It had so much dust, it just needed the cobwebs.  The blinds were grimy and Dusty, and the window ledge was disgustingly filthy.  I can't believe we ate in such a dirty restaurant. This place is going downhill so fast, and it's a shame because it used to be one of my favorites."
Carlos F.,"Fontana, CA",8,40,,1.0,12/15/2017,Ordered a mini through postmates for delivery. It arive and only had about a slices worth of toppings and the rest of the pizza was big crust bubble. Usually don't have issues in the restaurant but if they aren't going to treat to go orders with the same care as in house guests then don't offer take out. Every other pizza spot in town is jusr as good and a fraction of the cost. Thanks but no thanks BJ's
Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",298,1007,958,4.0,6/29/2017,"I'm busier than hell today. Here's to another review in Haiku...

Minxie O.,"Upland, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/28/2017,"Scott was our server, he has a winning smile was modest, funny, friendly.  My fiance and I came out to have a special evening together and Scott gave us the best service we could've asked for. Just all about getting us what we needed. He basically dotted every 'i' and crosssed every 't'. He deserves this rave review. Thank you Scott."
Jorge L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,7,,5.0,11/20/2017,I have been to this BJ's location #433 several times and always have great service the management is definitely doing a great job with hiring and training.  On today's visit we had the best service ever!  Jeremiah W was our waiter and he gave my three boys a complimentary appetizer plate which my kids loved.  Then he was attentive and made our experience wonderful that my 9 year old son mentioned his service was great!  I love the food and great value and deals you have on a regular basis.  Thank you for doing a great job on making our lunch a memorable  one.  Please recognize Jeremiah W for his amazing service and we will see you soon. Thanks!
Elaney J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,15,4.0,6/27/2017,"I've been at this location multiple times and I have mostly loved everything! This review is specifically on my experience yesterday which was a lunch date with my girlfriend. We got the root beer glazed chicken wings for appetizers and they were sooo delicious! For entrees, we each got the California club sandwich. On mine, the bacon was so burnt that I had to spit it out, but overall the food was good! We were too full for a pizookie but usually we always get a pizookie each because they are our absolute favorites! The servers were sweet (I say servers because another server gave me a refill and I didn't see my server much) and the overall experience was a positive one. We used the buy one entree get one free coupon with the purchase of two drinks and our total was extremely reasonable. BJ's always has amazing deals and coupons available! Overall, I love BJs and I will always be back! This location seems to get a lot of negative reviews but I've never had a horrible experience with service or food at this location. The atmosphere is also nice and it's always clean."
Mario D.,"Houston, TX",0,13,6,5.0,12/21/2017,"Came here for my girlfriend's birthday lunch and had a fantastic time! Our server was Jeremiah, and he was extremely friendly and tentative to us. The drinks came out very fast, as did our appetizer and food. I would definitely come back here! GG, 10/10, would smash again"
Lena P.,"Ontario, CA",21,486,1384,2.0,2/4/2017,"I feel like their food went down in quality and taste. The food does not taste as fresh or flavorful as it used to be.  (4 stars) Brussels sprouts are pretty good. We liked the seasoning and sauce they marinate it in.  (1 star) Vegetable penne is something I can make at home. This dish was over cooked vegetables and all. (1 star) Mediterranean veggie tacos are awful, no flavor and the server wouldn't let us sub the meat for avocado (it was an extra charge), but the side grain salad was pretty good."
Nancy L.,"Pomona, CA",57,139,37,1.0,10/26/2017,"We live in upland, borderline ontario, and next time, I'll take the extra couple miles to drive to West Covina or Chino where I know my food will be done right. We came in for their bbq chicken salad and pazookie, their well known cookie with ice cream dish. I was pretty disappointed AGAIN!  I ordered their salted caramel pazookie and our pazookie came out like this: COLD burnt white chocolate macadamia cookie with ice cream.  I told my waiter that I dont think it was a salted caramel pazookie and it taste like burnt white chocolate macadamia cookie with ice cream and I was missing my little chocolate chips and caramel drizzle. He comes back with a new one and says that the other one was made an hour ago and they're out of caramel drizzle.  Wait, what? I thought the pazookies were made fresh and no wonder the cookie wasn't warm. I've had a pazookie before and they come out freshly baked and the whole point of a salted CARAMEL pazookie is the caramel drizzle as well... a well trained server would had said that in the beginning. and may I add... they weren't busy updating their menus this time and still served me poorly made food."
Brad E.,"Redlands, CA",52,16,3,5.0,11/4/2017,"Stopped in on our way to the Ontario Reign  hockey game for a quick bite and a couple of beers with 2 buddies. We sat in the bar area and were served quickly.  Food arrived timely and was delicious.  Our server Sarah was a delight. Great place, great food, outstanding beer."
Jenn B.,"Ontario, CA",8,44,51,5.0,12/7/2017,"Omg so first off we loved our server Lex (Alexander) my mother couldn't take her eyes off him to order her drink! He was on point had excellent selections and took awesome care of us.. we had the honey siracha Brussel sprouts( almost licked the plate), spinach artichoke stuffed mushrooms (of heaven) and my all time fave ahi poke off the chain!!! Baked Beignet and chocolate chip pazzooki !!! Ahhhh maziinggg !!!"
Kenneth M.,"Fontana, CA",41,4,4,5.0,11/15/2017,Highly recommendable great servers great food. Everything came out good. The flatbread nachos and avocado egg roll is the best appetizers. I ate the Barbacoa tacos which were delicious.
Jeneen Tanya P.,"San Bernardino, CA",42,50,1,5.0,11/29/2017,"I  went to BJs today to wait out the traffic with my sister . This Bjs bar service and food  in Rancho is   way better than the  one by my house in San Bernardino.  The bartenders Don and Colby are phenomenal. Excellent  customer service.They are very Attentive ,kind and funny. A great duo. The food here was hot and great. I had the pork chop and tomatoe salad my sister had ribs and mini pizza, it was sooo good. And they surprised my sister with a birthday dessert.  WOW.!!! I will definitely drive the distance out of my way  to come here instead of my local san bernardino Bjs . THANK YOU Don and Colby for an amazing memorable experience at the Rancho BJS. See you soon."
Sandra C.,"Victorville, CA",0,3,3,5.0,12/21/2017,Amazing first time for my birthday. Great food and drinks:) server named Jeremiah was really nice and helpful. GG
Stacey H.,"Hesperia, CA",120,5,,1.0,11/28/2017,The manager Eric would not honor what we were told by our waitress. He was not friendly at all and kinda rude. I would not recommend eating here and I will never go back. Very very poor customer service.
Sanaz T.,"Riverside, CA",10,48,7,1.0,10/12/2017,The worst service ever.  Our sever took 20 min to come to our table after she finally did she took 25 minutes to get us waters. Our appetizer came out before our drinks. Mind you we got no plates for 12 minutes so we sat there while the food got cold. By time she came back it was 20 minutes later then they switched servers. The new server didn't come back till after our main courSe came out. Then we couldn't get anyone to refill our waters. She brought us a closed pellegrino we had to way to send it back to open. When they finally brought waters they refilled our pellegrino cups and not the water cups with water. Worst service ever we left our food paid and walk out.  Don't go here  So nobody is going to message me ????? Wow.  You sent me a comment and I can't reply. Terrible
Gabby S.,"La Puente, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/16/2017,"First time here and definitely my last Hosts are rude and do not know anything about customer service. When asked for manager no one showed up to our table and later found out there were 3 managers there, until I insisted for one then I finally got to put in my complaint but seems like it did not even matter to them, when you have a party of 10 and want to have a good time go somewhere else!! The host will try and take your table after you have been seated!! Unhappy with the service!! Killed our happy vibe! As for our server Andy he was awesome!! Feel sorry for him that he has to work with the rude hosts!"
Food I.,"Riverside, CA",2,5,1,5.0,11/5/2017,The only reason I gave 5 stars was because of our server Jeremiah. He deserves 10stars! He was on top of everything and also had great conversation with him. We never had to ask for drink refills or napkins. Everything was paced perfectly and on a Friday night. If you're going to BJ's ask to sit with him for great service.
Hayley K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",53,126,163,4.0,3/11/2017,"I love BJs (that sounds bad :/), my staple meal is the BBQ chicken pizza and berry burst cider. So, so good!! My husband and I usually get the avocado egg rolls too. They are delicious and that dipping sauce rounds them out! I have tried other delicious items like: Calamari Ahi tuna salad Brussels sprouts Pot stickers And of course 3736 millions Pazookies!! I haven't found anything I don't like except for their great white pizza, we didn't really care for it. Service is usually pretty friendly, bathrooms are always dirty and the place is usually pretty packed!"
Brianna V.,"Fontana, CA",98,51,25,4.0,9/8/2017,"Our server Sabrina was so awesome! It was crazy busy when we went and she still went out of her way to take care of us, the second we told her within a conversation that we were planning on catching a movie at a certain time, she made sure our food was brought out quick and took care of our check right away and still checked up on us as we ate.  As for the food (just a deep dish pizza), it was good but you know just regular old Bj's flare."
Jeffrey M.,"West Covina, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Terrible customer service. The three hostess at the desk are telling groups of people different times. I have been waiting here for over an hour. I tried using  there so called  app to put my reservation down ahead of time and still ended up waiting 1 hr. Ugh.  This place is poorly ran. The managers aren't doing a good enough job to motivate and Time manage their staff. They need more support staff. Salads came out late, we had to rush to eat them prior to our meals arriving. Our server was very overwhelmed and it showed. If it wasn't for the gift card I had this place wouldn't have been my first choice. Food was ok. My steak was a tad cold. Veggies seemed rushed and undercooked. I didn't want to send food back because we had already waited along time to eat and didn't want to wait a min more. Do not come here!!!! Go to lazy dog next door the service is way better!"
Linda S.,"CA, CA",269,60,141,5.0,2/11/2017,The service today was excellent . Our server was Mia she was outstanding. The new menu options were great for my more healthy style. I love how welcoming they are here. And selections. We had salmon and quinoa and we had ahi poke the best.  My son enjoyed the great selection of beers.
R M.,"Pomona, CA",0,9,3,1.0,10/21/2017,"The Manager at this location was very rude. A customer slipped and felt. The floors are slippery. I complaint that a customer had an accident and NOT ERIC not the staff addressed the customer to make sure that she was ""okay."" I had to request for the a manager and when the manager came out Eric had the audacity to get loud and tell me that he was not talking to me. Eric and the rest of the employees should take an ethics training and  customer service training- to learn to handle accidents at there restaurant. I hope someone replies to my comments because I have the young girls name an contact info. This poor girl was embarrassed. The floors need to be cleaned!"
B M.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,36,13,5.0,12/26/2017,"Came here 12/26/17 to have lunch with my family. Wings are always good and also the Nashville Hot chicken sandwich was delicious. ALSO a big plus, we had Manny as our waiter.... he was the best waiter I've had in a while. So attentive and nice. Five stars"
Jacob V.,"Diamond Bar, CA",167,5,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"The customer service was bad just out right bad, they had good hearts and weren't bad people but I'd ask for sprite and get water, I'd ask for lemonade and get water it was weird and you can tell they'd forget, they brought me the wrong food, my appetizer came with my meal. Into the meal! My biggest issue was the noodles were hard and undercooked and it was cold!!!! Also had some other food in it which was disturbing. Overall I won't go back for the overpriced nastiness!!!"
Boss B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,15,4,1.0,11/20/2017,"Very disappointed with this BJ's location it has gone down in a spiral. Came In with my family to get some dinner and drinks. Services was very slow, took for ever to get our drinks. We order appetizers one of them was calamari, came cold with hardly no dip sauce. We order 2 pizzas both came stiff and dry. We could've gone to Pieology, gotten a fresher hot moist pizza for cheaper. Follow up for water or topping off drinks was non-existing. Place was well staff with employees but no leadership crews talking and gossiping with no customer urgency. Manager was not available for any my concerns, I got tired waiting for him to come out. I perhaps he was the one cooking in the kitchen? I'm sending out formal letter to Corp office, letting them know our experience. Not coming back to this location again."
Delaney H.,"Escondido, CA",9,2,,5.0,11/3/2017,"Had a wonderful experience here all because of our waiter Jeremiah. He was very personable, comfortable, and made you feel welcomed. He was very knowledgeable about the menu when I asked him questions and was able to help inform me about my order. He was also always prompt and quick in doing the simple things like refilling water that often gets over looked by many waiters and waitresses. I would love to have Jeremiah serve me any day because of his professionalism. First class server."
Belen N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",274,7,4,5.0,6/21/2017,"Purely leaving this review for our server Jonas.  My best friend and I came in and had to wait much longer than what the hostess quoted us. The girl who sat us was unfortunately somewhat rude as well and kinda just threw us in the back corner with a flat lined face.  BUT.. our server Jonas was attentive, funny, super nice, and all around just a great guy. He didn't seem fake at all or seem like his personality was put on. Definitely someone who we would come back for. He recommend the new flavors to try from and was just all around great. I thought that all the servers would be rude because it's free pizookie day and it's crazy packed here but Jonas treated us like he had no other tables!  Best experience I've had here and I've been coming here for yearssssss.. Will be back. Request to sit in his section."
Carlos E.,"Ontario, CA",110,1,,2.0,6/2/2017,"Party of 6 and all menus had a sticky substance that left our hands sticky and gross. When I told our waitress about this all she said was ""ok"". Then I watched her put them back on top of the stack.  Food was good service was average."
Omar C.,"Montclair, CA",0,10,6,4.0,11/14/2017,Pretty good place to come and sit down with family and friends. The food is great and on good timing. The customer service can improve but overall good. Drinks are good and not overpriced like some other places.
A B.,"Upland, CA",0,60,4,5.0,10/20/2017,I enjoy coming here with my family and friends. Sometimes I have great experiences and other time I just have okay experiences. This rating is based on my last visit. My husband and I had dinner with another couple on Tuesday night. Mayra was our waitress and she was amazing! She made sure we didn't have to ask for anything. She showed so much attention to detail. She checked on us regularly and she always had a smile. I wish all waitresses gave customer service like she did. 5 stars for Mayra!!!!
Miz C.,"Ontario, CA",8,6,19,5.0,9/30/2017,"Loved our server Brenda, thanks for the food recommendations and dessert was awesome!! Ribs were delicious and the brisket sandwich was perfect. Pizookie trio for dessert is a must"
