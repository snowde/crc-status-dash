Marnie S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,26,2,1.0,5/22/2017,"BJs has horrible managerial staff and they teach their staff the same work ethics. The ""runners"" or fellow waiters and waitresses aren't helpful and when you ask to speak w/ a manager, one will not show up. If you even ask for the corporate #, good luck, you'll have better luck w/ google."
Ifti K.,"San Dimas, CA",1,66,1,4.0,10/19/2016,"This is your slightly better than average chain restaurant which usually warrants 3 stars, but the added star was because of the servers. Though she was pregnant and tired, she  was smiling,  quick, and pleasant. Sorry I forgot her name. Her replacement,  Juan  was also courteous and quick.  Food was as expected, and came out hot ."
Derek W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",30,51,151,4.0,7/25/2015,MORE THAN ENOUGH BRIGHT SPOTS! I thought it was a little too dark. It was about 6pm and still sunny outside. I prefer a restaurant to be brighter and more open.  I had an Ultimate Long Island it was just ok. Not enough of that Iced Tea flavor that I like and it tasted more like lemonade. My daughters chicken strips were excellent. They didn't cut any corners on them for sure. My wife and son had no complaints about the burgers and my 3 year old devoured the spaghetti with marinara sauce. My fries were excellent as well. Our waitress was quick & polite. We were seated in about 5 minutes. Not the best place I've ever been but overall enough positives to warrant 3-4 stars.
Diane M.,"Portland, OR",3,7,,5.0,11/17/2016,"I just love the whole vibe Of this place.  Always good service, yummy food and a cold beer.  One of my regular go to places!"
Ashley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",780,148,386,4.0,3/25/2015,"I came here for a birthday lunch. The service here was decent. It was pretty busy so it was understandable that there would be waits for our waitress to come by. She was extremely nice though, which made up for the waits.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip appetizer. The cheese is melting just perfectly! Not too cheesy and not too watery like some the spinach artichoke dip from other restaurants.  Then we had the veggie delight deep dish. This was decent. Nice and fluffy, but nothing too special about this specific deep dish. We also had the garlic chicken pesto tavern-cut pizza. This was delicious! It was perfectly crispy with the right combination of pesto sauce and tomatoes and chicken and everything else.  For dessert we got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie with vanilla ice cream. Before our waitress even knew we were there to celebrate a birthday, she told us to pretend it was one of our birthdays so we could get two complimentary pizookies. Definitely a dessert that needs to be shared because of its overwhelming sweetness.  Lastly, we had the craft root beer. If you've never had it, you MUST! It's a bit sweeter than the usual root beer you buy in stores, which makes it so much better."
Britt A.,"Upland, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,"This place is a ran down dirty dump! The staff is OK for the most part except they have a lot of snarky kids that work there. We got seated Tonight and had to walk out they sat us at a table that was covered in food and just threw our sticky menus on top of the mess even after I pointed out that the table needed to be cleaned. Went to Lazy Dog next, thankfully there was a clean business next door to redirect to."
Margaret W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,16,,1.0,11/9/2016,"I think that one star is one to many.  We arrived at 350pm for a birthday dinner to beat the crowds and they said that they can't seat us (5 people) because there was only one server. They wanted us to wait until one party left. There was 3 people at front desk just standing there. How do they run their place before 4pm....only one server and 3 people at front desk hanging out. We left, because I rather drive to another place and enjoy good service then hear 3 people talk at a front desk, and believe that there was only one server on the floor!!! To make matters worse we called to complain and was left on hold for 7 minutes with no response!  WOW"
Sy M.,"Southern California, CA",35,74,659,5.0,4/25/2015,Love the Spinach and artichoke dip and the Avocado Egg Rolls! My husband loves the Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde and the deep dish BBQ Chicken Pizza! My mother in law loves the stuffed baked potatoes.  Pass on the Caesar Salad. Its not very good.   Service is always pretty good and the food comes out quick.  They also no longer have the Red Velvet Pizookie. I was pretty bummed out about that.
Sarah S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",31,5,38,5.0,6/1/2017,"Busy night, got seated quickly, our waitress was very attentive, never wondered when she was coming back, our food was delicious. We'll go every week"
Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3012,223,141,3.0,4/1/2015,"Love this restaurant!! Their food is always delicious when I go :) A little pricey but it's definitely worth it! The only reason they didn't get five stars is for their service. It's absolutely horrible!! The waiters take forever to get your order and there were a few times the hosts completely forgot my party!! Especially when they put you down in the system and give you a buzzer yet still manage to call multiple parties before you, yea... They might want to fix that issue.  Other than that their food and strawberry lemonade is the only reason I keep coming back!!"
Catalina R.,"Fontana, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/4/2016,"BJ's is always a good stopping point for some good beers and food, we were very pleased with the buffalo chicken pizza and the small plates, we also had a better time than usual thanks to our waiter Esteven, he was super attentive and so fun! He made our experience awesome and we will definitely be back hoping to sit in his section again! The pale ale and Oktoberfest beers were great too!"
Jenelyn H.,"San Diego, CA",270,472,489,4.0,3/23/2015,"My cousins husband had his 42nd birthday here & what i like about this place is how organized they run this store.  They set us up a reserved section in the back, & our food came out as fast as everyones, i usually dont expect that because most places like bringing out food at the same time, and i know this sounds dumb but as soon as we ordered, it came out to order.  Since its a chain, of course it's going to be pricey and busy during lunch & dinner.  My favorite items to order are, the avocado spring rolls, their shrimp lettuce wraps, & just about any of their pizzas."
Kelly S.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,27,1,1.0,5/25/2017,worst service ever!!!! never ever coming back here!!! i asked 3 different waiters for a dam straw for my drink and i took literally 20 minutes by then my drink was warm....now im sitting here and everyone in our party has their dinner except me....im pissed this service is horrible and waiter got smart with me earlier when i asked him for the 2nd time for a straw .....I asked the manager for some Tabasco when my food finally came and I was literally dam near done with my food and he still hasn't brought it
Becky S.,"Upland, CA",29,25,16,1.0,12/15/2015,"Tonight was an off night for these guys and its 100% the managers fault.  After being seated at 8:45pm tonight we waited 20 minutes before flagging down a server.  She sent the manager over who apologized and took our order.  We got our appetizer, but no drinks or utensils. We asked three different times for utensils before they came.  When the food came out it was the wrong order, we kept it anyway because we were already an hour in, tired, and hungry.  Still no water!  We finish and order dessert.  Still no water.  Dessert comes, still no water.  We ask for the bill and again for a glass of water.  When the server comes back with the our $74 bill he finally apologizes for the all the mishaps stating the server for this section fell and had to be sent home (how convenient the apology comes when the nil is dropped).  I totally get that accidents happen and I hope the server that fell is okay.  Our server was slammed and really was doing the best he could.  However, the manager should have been more proactive.  She could have slowed down the seating, thrown on an apron and served food, dropped drinks, and even communicated the issues and reason for the slow service, she could have done a lot of things to make this night better like supporting her team on the floor but she didn't.   We'll be back because we like BJ's, but that manager tonight...  needs to be retrained.  =//"
Norm N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,100,47,2.0,10/9/2016,"Ordered three Happy hour Pizza's. A mediterranean, vegetarian, and Chicken Philly pizza. All 3 were extremely doughy, salty, and under-cooked.The pizza's barley had any pizza toppings. Not going back."
Gloria U.,"Ontario, CA",6,47,22,3.0,8/22/2016,In general I LOVE BJs restaurant but at this location service is not the best. We've gone and received good service but also very bad service. Like so bad we had to talk to the manager (which I usually try to avoid). But again it's a large chain so you can't expect perfect every time.
Adrian I.,"Fontana, CA",6,2,,3.0,11/6/2015,"Came in at 1:45 pm for lunch to celebrate my daughter's excellent report card and parent-teacher conference. It was just 3 of us. Took 15 minutes to be seated, which is somewhat understandable considering it's Friday. But the host looked like he had just broken up with his boyfriend, and he never acknowledged us again. Another hostess ultimately seated us. Once seated, it took another 10 minutes for our waitress, Monica, to come by and get our drink orders. Thinking she might've been somewhat overwhelmed with tables, we put our appetizer and food orders in all at once. Bad idea. Drinks came out close to another 10 minutes later, then we didn't see her again for another 25 minutes. When she finally did come back around to check on us, it was to see if we wanted another round of drinks. We placed another order for one more round even though we were only halfway done with the first, and asked her about our food. She said she would check on it.  When the appetizer and entrees finally did come out, different servers brought it. I know this isn't unusual for a big restaurant like BJ's, but the place wasn't exactly packed yet.  The manager on hand, Elizabeth, came by our table at the end of our meal to ask if everything went well. We informed her that Monica could have been a little more attentive to our table, but other than that the food was good. She apologized and thanked us for our feedback. We had placed a pizookie dessert order prior to leaving, but 20 more minutes of waiting for it was enough and we decided to cancel it and leave. Elizabeth was very sweet and considerate enough to run it out to us as we were about to get into the car and leave, free of charge. If not for management personnel like Elizabeth, I don't think we'd come back. Lazy Dog is right down the street and service there is always exceptional. BJ's, on the other hand, tends to rely heavily on simply their brand name and leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to basic service, particularly at this location."
Aleah L.,"La Verne, CA",9,20,9,2.0,7/1/2016,"Usually I love this restaurant and all their food but this time i visited in Rancho Cucamonga was something wild.  I was walking to the bathroom and suddenly slipped and fell on my left hip, i got right back up and in the bathroom i was informed by my friend that there was water on the floor. I went back out and then asked if there was water on the floor to the group of waiters, one of them denied water ever being there and suggested maybe it was ""my high heels"" that made me fall. When right after i fell, my family saw them wipe up the water that had been there.. obviously it wasn't my heels.  The manager however was sweet about it and i appreciated that.  Next all of us got our food, the food was great until we noticed and found some unmentionable things in it.  1) a piece of hair on the pizza and 2) what looked like a bugs shell on my friends plate. I have pictures to prove it!  It was truly a hilarious experience that night with everything that happened.  At least we got a delicious pizookie, my meal free and a discount on the rest of our food but believe me i will be cautious of going to this location!"
Mark B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",48,6,3,1.0,11/20/2016,"I ordered the 14 oz ribeye for lunch (medium rare). I ended up waiting an additional 20 minutes after everyone else was served, and then got a steak that was terribly overlooked. I sent it back and the server didn't so much as make an apology. About 15 minutes later, the server brought me a steak that was SO undercooked, the raw meat could be seen even before cutting into it. I assume the cook was sending me a message. Again, not an apologetic word from the server, and no manager came out as is usually the custom. Since the family was all finished and ready to go, I gave up and we left. This is the third time I've had this same experience at BJ's. I cannot recommend BJ's to anyone, for any item on the menu."
Jacqueline G.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/21/2017,I am giving this place a one star because the wood floors there are oily and slippery. Ladies if you plan to go here for dinner beware on what shoes you wear. I slipped and fell a year ago and today my mother slip and fell there too. When my mother fell there were 3 B.J.'s workers around her they did not help me get her up or even simply asked if she was okay. The waiter was so nice and helpful and when I told him about the fall he got the manager. The manager just apologized and had us write a incident report. I will never go to B.J.'s again. This is ridiculous they have to do something about the floors and those lousy steps they have when you go get your table. Never going there again!
