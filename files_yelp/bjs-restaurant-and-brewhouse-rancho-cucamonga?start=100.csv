Lily L.,"Riverside, CA",189,165,65,1.0,8/19/2016,My sister found her broccoli was infested with bugs!!!!! We both ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta with broccoli for lunch and took the left overs home. When my sister went to eat them later she found all of the broccoli was infested with tiny critters! Now I know usually bugs in broccoli is normal but to not properly wash your produce is not acceptable when you are dealing with paying consumers!! Never again BJs!! I'm telling all of my friends and family to stay clear from you! You do not care about your customers!
Jordan J.,"Fontana, CA",0,14,11,1.0,10/8/2017,"jeremiah is a great server. However, i'm not too sure about the rest of my experience. Food took an hour then sent back because cold"
Ricky C.,"Fontana, CA",1,6,,1.0,3/14/2017,"I love this place but this time really sucked. The service was bad and the steak was even worse. The plate they brought me on accident looked better than what they gave me. I ordered the ribeye which was mostly fat with 1/4 of it being meat. They claim to use big poppa smokers seasoning, the chef must take it home cause there was zero seasoning on my steak. Good thing I had a loaded baked potato probably the best part of the dinner."
Jules C.,"Cypress, CA",312,5,,1.0,3/5/2017,"BE VERY CAUTIOUS HERE! I went here one time. I do not live in the area and I have never used my card near or around Rancho Cucamonga except for the one time I used it at this restaurant. Two weeks after dining here my bank canceled my debit card for fraud at a Walmart that is less than 4 miles from this restaurant. Coincidence? I think not.. I was charged over $250 at a Walmart less than 4 miles away from this restaurant after only using my card here. I called the store and the manager just didn't seem to care. Almost acting like I don't know what I am talking about. I told her that I have worked in a restaurant before and I have seen people get fired for fraud. She didn't apologize once, she didn't ask me for information on my visit.. I still had the receipt so I could have given her the employee name, number, table number, date, time of visit and she just didn't care to ask. Instead she says ""well did you get gas""?.. I came here for a school event in a school bus so no I did not get gas. Do not go here! Do not use your card here! Fraud is obviously happening in this restaurant and by this point who knows, management could be involved in this. What kind of manager doesn't want information on possible fraud in her restaurant?! All she says to me on the phone is well I don't know what you want me to do I can't really go around asking people, but we haven't had any problems with fraud in our restaurant. I said well obviously the team member isn't going to tell you ""oh hey, I took a persons card number today!"" I told her she is the manager and I would just take this as a warning that this might be happening to other people as well. I will be writing to corporate and trying to find out more information on this. We came in with an over 50 people party so I am also going to see if anyone else had fraud on their account and if so then this isn't just a ""coincidence"". Terrible, terrible, terrible management. I wish I could've given negative stars."
Ariana H.,"Placentia, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,This BJ's has really bad time management. I waited for 40 min. To be seated. When I went to asked the host how much longer she said she didn't had my name down. I waited an hour there for nothing. The only thing the host said is that she would seat me as soon as a table was open. I saw many people come in after us and got seated. As people kept being seated I went to ask the host one more time. The only thing she told me is she had no open tables. Very unhappy with their service.
Debbie E.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,33,22,4.0,2/24/2017,My husband ordered a ribeye and it was delicious! Great service. I've been to several BJ's but this one was better than the others I've been to.
Lena A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",4,33,32,4.0,5/7/2017,"After a car malfunction on our way back from Vegas we stopped to have lunch at this location. We got seated right away so that was a good thing. The waitress was a bit rude. She came over and said ""what would you like to drink?"" Didn't even say hi or anything. Food was delicious and so was my strawberry margarita."
Kathy N.,"Lewisville, TX",53,1,,3.0,3/17/2017,We are visiting in California.  We love the Bjs in lewisville Texas so we decided to try bjs In California. The waitress was nice but she didn't do anything.  I ordered water with lime and ice tea. She brought the tea and no water.  I had to ask for water. She brought the water and no lime.  I had to ask for lime.  I ordered the BBQ chicken salad without beans. Salad had beans when it was delivered.  We didn't have silverware. I had to get up and get  our silverware.  My salad was really good once I got it.  My husband ordered a hamburger.  His French fries were cold. Had to ask someone for ketchup.  It took 20 minutes to get our check.  They weren't busy.
Shelby L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,27,4,2.0,5/5/2017,"I really feel like this place has really gone downhill. Food quality is poor, service isn't great. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Not anymore"
Margie A.,"Norwalk, CA",1,3,,1.0,9/21/2017,This was a sad experience.... Went out for my birthday with my mom and stepdad thought BJ's would be a great idea. My mom is allergic to almost everything and asked the server Danielle R. about what was in the sandwich she was trying to order. First she said she didn't know and had to go figure it out and then when she told us what was on the sandwich my mom told her no garlic or any seasoning. When the food came out Danielle decided to that there was garlic aioli on it and asked if it was ok..... My mom said no garlic..... It wasn't even busy for that kind of mistake to happen. And she seemed annoyed when my mom was telling her this like she was put off. Danielle R. work on your listening skills and customer service......you could have put my mom in the hospital thanks....
Nita G.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/26/2017,We love coming here excellent service today we had Amanda and she was great. The Salmon tacos were great
Ashley K.,"Riverside, CA",67,10,5,2.0,7/19/2017,Today is free pazookie day so you would think this place would be prepared. Well here we go: we are seated at 6:45. We (my party of 2) we're not acknowledged my our server until 7:00. We order our pazookie at 7:30. At 8:10 our dessert was not ready! So we left because we had a movie to catch. The fact that it took over an hour to serve 2 people is unacceptable. There were even empty tables all around us! So we came here and over spent on some basic food just to get screwed out of the real purpose of our visit. Thanks for wasting my time and money.
Valarei O.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",5,20,,1.0,2/5/2017,Worst service ever! Food came out late and cold. The manager was a bitch when confronted with the issues. I will never eat here ever!!!! Slow service unfriendly workers. The place was empty and the service still sucked! Don't eat here!!!
Lanita P.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/27/2017,Busy night long wait but got seated sooner than expected. Friendly host and waiter. Great food even served an appetizer before seated.
Douglas S.,"Toronto, Canada",50,133,40,4.0,10/1/2016,"We needed a place to celebrate a small victory, and having eaten at BJ's several months before, decided to seek it out. I'm glad we did. Che made our meal delightful. The *only* reason it's not a five-star rating was that our appetizers came out with the entree, and that was  a bit of a surprise.  It was jam-packed busy, and we were so very surprised that he took the time to be congenial, conversant, and very helpful over a couple of questions and thoughts we'd had. He was the same with all the tables on the outside patio even though it was clear he had a lot to do. Thanks, Che, for making us feel welcome and keeping the mood just perfect for our needs. We'll be back in Ontario fairly frequently for work (we live out of state) and we'll be visiting your place again!"
E A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,8,,5.0,6/9/2017,"BJ's on 4th St. in Rancho Cucamonga has the best servers ever! On Memorial Day this year, we were meeting some friends for an early dinner here around 3:30 pm. As we waited to turn left into the parking lot, we got caught behind an elderly gentleman whose car had stalled right in the lane of traffic. We immediately saw 2 male servers from BJ's hurrying across the street to assist him. One of them was Jeremiah, and I shook his hand and thanked him once he was done. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to say the same to the other server or get his name. The food and beer at BJ's is good. But it's their people who make it great!"
Danny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,24,1,1.0,4/15/2017,Just tried to place a pick up order referencing the Yelp menu. They don't have what's on the Yelp menu. What is the point!!
Michael D.,"Ontario, CA",24,58,,4.0,1/10/2017,"If you've  never been to BJs  before just  remember  the four P's and you can't  go wrong: pint of beer, plate of calamari, pizza, and pazooki.    BJs offers a wide selection of in-house lagers and ales. If you have a favorite  name brand beer ask the server and they'll  suggest a comparable in-house beer or something similar. And if you are still having trouble deciding, order their 4 or 8 beer sampler. Like they say: variety is the spice of life.   For an appetizer, a plate of their calamari  is everything  you would want. The  calimari is bite size, warm, crunchy, and just filling enough to hold you over until the pizza arrives.   As a main dish, their pizzas are something to behold like a shiney trophy on a pedestal. The pizza I  had the other night was a medium size  chicago style  pizza. It was slathered  in tomato sauce and smothered with cheese. Then it was heavily topped with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and olives. It was absolutely  delicious.   And once you are done with your pizza, I hope you have enough room for the pazooki, which is a freshly baked cookie topped with icecream. The contrast between warm and cold, and crunchy and soft is masterful.   For more information check out their website and go and enjoy."
Jessi H.,"Alhambra, CA",0,1,,4.0,9/8/2017,"On Monday evening I came into bjs with a client, usually where I go for my business meetings, and received the best service I have ever had to date. My server's name was Olivia? She anticipated all of our needs and although was taking care of what looked like a full section she never once neglected us. The food was phenomenal like always, presentation seemed to be a little neater than I'm used to. Even though I wasn't too happy about where I was seated(the far corner of the restaurant in a little booth) the service and upbeat attitude we were presented with really made the overall experience worth coming back for."
Brad V.,"Dallas, TX",180,8,1,3.0,8/16/2016,"Good food and good beer.  TERRIBLE WIFI. Was told it's just because too many people are on it.  I peered around the place and saw maybe 60 patrons, almost none on their phones. The wifi infrastructure is bad...you can't even connect to it.   As a business traveler, having wifi while traveling is key to a good consumer experience.  Giving lame excuses isn't acceptable. Update: August 16, 2016...WIFI is awesome! 9Mbps! That's more than double most hotels!  Thank you!"
