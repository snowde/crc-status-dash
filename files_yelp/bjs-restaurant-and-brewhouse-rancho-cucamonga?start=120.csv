Mauricio M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,25,7,2.0,9/13/2016,My wife and I went to a Bj's Brewhouse in Laguna Hills because we had an event and wanted to celebrate. They cook the food A LOT better there. Then we decided to give the Bj's in Rancho Cucamonga and you can see the I don't care attitude on the food.
Tasha V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",264,285,152,3.0,1/6/2016,"I always enjoy my visit to BJs. Unfortunately this time I did not. I used the call ahead feature. The person on the phone told me the current wait time was 30-45 minutes and that I had to be there within 30 minutes, which we were. When we arrived and we explained we were on the call ahead list, she told me our wait was 25-30 minutes. I explained what was told to me and she looked confused. We waited. We ordered our food and our appetizer, my soup and main dish all came out at the same time while the rest of my party did not receive their food. I finally asked for a manager, who came and offered an apology and an excuse that my food was put in at a different time than that of my friends which is why my food came out first. After all that, the food still didn't come.  I do love BJs food, however the service was unacceptable this time. Dine or Dash? I will dine again... just at another location."
Marley R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",21,22,43,1.0,6/22/2016,"Always been a huge fan of BJ's, great food, great beer. This location, however, is an embarrassment. Management should be embarrassed to call this location a BJ's. Here's what happened: we order our food, and we wait. And wait, and wait. And while we wait, my aunt goes to the restroom. And trips, in front of the eyes of one of the managers who, does and says nothing. Not even an offer for assistance. We get our food, and our waiter disappears. So we ask for a manager. Guess who we get? Our oh-so-helpful witness, Elizabeth. She promises to make it right. So she gives us courtesy cards, and the business card of her manager Jennifer and scribbles her name below. Seems legit, we walk away a little bit put off but hey we got courtesy cards. Dope, right?  Fast forward to about a month from them, now. We try to use the cards Elizabeth gave us at our home location in Torrance only to discover--she never loaded them up!! So not only were we treated to bad service, we were conned into thinking she had made it right! Watch yourself here, management is completely inadequate and totally unfocused."
Gerald H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",6,26,13,3.0,6/30/2017,"The 3 star rating is spot on. I have been to this Bjs more than 5 times. Celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, everything. The food is usually good. I've had a few issues  with wrong items but nothing major. The lower star rating comes from the service. Just can't seem to get this right. Weve had bad service more than 3 times. Last time we had to ask for water refills more than 5 times. Like we'd ask, wait like 5 minutes, see the waiter doing anything but water, ask again, wait 5 minutes etc. Finally after 30 min of sharing waters, (some people's food was spicy), we asked a manager to get the water and a beer we had been waiting more than 30 mins for. He wasn't very helpful. He slinked away so sly, we were like where did he go were barely got started? He had another waiter bring the drinks but even then they forgot the soda refills, sorry not all were easy waters. Either way we were comped an entree so some restitution was made but it seemed impersonal and did little to make us want to come back. This place could use some better leadership top to bottom or maybe just some better employee training."
Tawny V.,"Burbank, CA",341,224,252,5.0,2/11/2017,"BJ's is always consistent and when a restaurant is like that, the wait is long then you know they are doing something good. In this case brews and pizza! the Mediterranean pizza was to die for and the BBQ chicken salad was plain.. something you can get anywhere else. I don't think I've ever been disappointed whenever I come to bjs. Although the service is usually excellent a runner had mistakenly gave our customized pizza to another party, they made up for it! thank for always showing me a good time. lol"
Melissa H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/9/2017,"The wait time of 50 minutes at 5:30 was ridiculous (though at the time we were the only ones waiting), after we were seated it took the server another 15 minutes to even greet us (even after getting up and asking someone for service), after 25 minutes at the table I finally had a glass of water at 35 minutes I had an appetizer that came out wrong and was mediocre at best, oh and had no silverware or napkins still.  My husband ordered a steak which was so fatty and tough he couldn't eat most of it and the green beans were almost raw.  The rest of the family's food was also mediocre at best, and after terrible service, barely okay food, and spending around $165 I won't be going back anytime soon."
antonio k.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,33,1,2.0,1/7/2017,"This used to be my spot to watch football. Unfortunately, the food quality declined to the point that I'm watching football elsewhere. The food is either cold or you get the wrong order. This has been consistently bad, not a single incident and for about a year now. Don't know what happened."
Ramiro M.,"Montclair, CA",0,3,,3.0,9/14/2017,friendly service it's clean food very delicious and brought on time had an hr lunch i was able to eat peacefully and not be late to work
Kitty H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",8,19,1,1.0,10/10/2016,Went to bj for a birthday dinner and my beef dip was soggy and cold. I order this many times but it was horrible this time. The waiter never took it off the bill and I didn't eat more than a third of it. Bad service.  Thank you Jennifer for acknowledging my complaint. Your food and service is alway very good. I  sure this was just a hiccup that night.
Maria B.,"Canoga Park, CA",31,3,,5.0,4/30/2017,"Had a great lunch! Our waiter Julian B. did a great job. Drinks and mozzarella stick were delivered promptly. So happy BJ's serves PEPSI! M grandson had spaghetti and meatballs. Delicious, except it was a little bit spicy for him. He still enjoyed it. My son had BJ's bacon cheese burger and  I built my special Tavern pizza. Again, delicious! Thin crust but not dry on the pizza. Of course my grandson had the triple chocolate pizzokie. WOW, amazing! We will definitely go back! Had a great time and great service by Julian B. Thank you BJ's!"
Daniel P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,6,18,4.0,4/24/2017,I wouldn't recommend big parties except if you have a reservation but if you're party is not that big I would recommend it this place it has wonderful service and the food is delicious
Anthony D.,"Anaheim, CA",30,583,317,4.0,1/12/2016,"BJ's is a great place for food and beer. They have a huge selection of food and beer. I can remember eating at the original BJ's in Long Beach. Today, this chain has grown by leaps and bounds. They care about quality, they care about the guest. It's a chain, but the food is always good."
Monique W.,"Ontario, CA",0,5,5,3.0,4/20/2017,"Upon entering, I noted that the establishment was clean and organized. Used my phone number to get my BJ rewards at the hostess station. Don't know why she ""sat"" 3 of us at a table when our party was only 2. The food was served promptly and hot. I can definitely recommend the clam chowder in the bread bowl! Yummy! Service was good. The reason I take 2 stars away is because there was a big problem with the restroom. In the discover, between 2 of the stalls, where the toilet paper hangs, is a hole so you can see the person using the restroom in the next stall and vice Vera. All bad! When we left, I let the hostess o ow of the problem in the bathroom and she seemed unconcerned and already aware of the situation. Fix the privacy concern, management!!!"
Christina C.,"Manorville, NY",27,73,3,4.0,1/3/2016,"Ambience: B+ Cleanliness: A Customer Service: A Food: B+ Overall Rating: A- Price  -Its about the same price as a chain restaurant such Applbee's, perhaps a tad bit more pricey. You certainly get bang for your buck here.   Atmosphere -It has a bit of a neighborhood grill feel to it with a slightly more upscale twist.  Customer Service  -Our waitress was friendly and attentive, couldn't ask for much more.  Food  -Pretty darn good! The entree was nothing to write home about but I certainly couldn't complain. The appetizers and desserts were on point through!! Overall  -Good price, good food, good customer service...I'll be coming here again next time I'm in Cali."
Tammy T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",54,109,10,3.0,12/27/2016,The wait here is always very long. The average wait time is about 30 minutes - an hour. The food here pretty much tastes the same as all the other B.J.'s - it isn't bad. It's always very hard to find a parking. I always have to park across the lot near the hotel. I don't come here often for this very reason.
Samantha C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,29,136,2.0,12/20/2016,"I came here for a birthday celebration at the end of October on a Sunday.  We had a table of 12.  I was running late so when I arrived, half the table had already ordered.  We had two waiters serving our party.  I didn't get their names.  Four more people after me came to the table.  No one once asked if I wanted to order anything.  It didn't bother me until they asked the four who came after me if they wanted to order.  I went to the bar and ordered a drink.  My friend said I should speak up and say something but I didn't want to embarrass anyone.  Finally one of the waiter asked if I wanted to order anything after everyone had gotten their food and were almost done eating.  I didn't want to be the last person eating at the table so I just left.  I usually come to BJ and service and the food has always been satisfying but I was not happy with this visit at all."
Ana C.,"Rialto, CA",176,7,,5.0,4/23/2017,Awesome place !!! Love it ! Good wings and drinks. Nice vibe. Awesome service. Love the style of the restaurant. Close to the freeway. Every time I come I always get above and beyond service from everyone I come into contact with. Definitely will be back
Michael H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",74,41,33,4.0,5/23/2016,"My faith has been restored.  The food  as always,  was good, service also was good (Andy was our server). Our food,  drinks, dessert and coffee all came out quickly and manager came by to check on us , also. Good overall experience."
Caryn F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,21,,5.0,4/8/2017,"This review is for our time at the bar tonight. Don was excellent! Very attentive, friendly, and efficient even though it was very busy! Drinks were delicious and times were good! Had to add to this review...Andy was great with a party of 8, full of 13 year old girls lol! Very patient and friendly! Made my nieces bday awesome!!"
Erica M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,27,,5.0,3/13/2017,Corie was our server and was awesome!  It was such a pleasant evening.  She made sure we well taken care of and it was nice to chat with her.  My friend and I were in having dinner last Thursday and we were seated behind a very large party with kiddos running around but Corie made up for that and made sure we were ok.  We will definitely come back for the service that Corie provided.
