Erick D.,"San Bernardino, CA",34,4,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Been here for an hour now. Had reservation! Just now getting our drinks and just took our order. Oh, and our party is separated into two groups. Over priced and horrible service."
Marko N.,"Palm Desert, CA",17,285,276,3.0,7/12/2016,"We typically like the food, it seems to be good and consistent, their best thing on the menu is probably the pizza. The beer selection is good, and is a nice pairing with the pizza. Service is usually on point, on our last visit the service was a little slow, it was busy so could tell our waitress was a little overworked, as she brought a wrong order of food to our table, but it was ok, felt bad for her but she pulled through it. The only thing is this place is always so extremely busy all the time, very difficult to get a table and the wait times can be long."
Christine N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",910,702,1676,5.0,8/6/2014,"We live life through experiences right? And if something makes us unhappy we want to avoid it as much as possible, right? Well, it has been quite some time since my last visit to a BJs and let me tell you a short story. I remember how I used to dread the end of each gathering... As paying took forever. Split checks, not enough cash, and paying extra for those who didn't even bother to calculate tax and tip. Well those days are certainly over if you go to BJs! They have certainly upped their game and revolutionalized  Their mobile pay app is amazing! For those of you that live through Apps, this is one you won't want to miss out on. Their promo right now is $5 off $20 purchase with use of the app.  Order in before. Food ready by the time you sit down. Then just leave because your bill is already paid for. How extravagant is that?!  Ah, their food is still delicious and large in portion as always. We ordered stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, stuffed baked potatoes, chicken Alfredo pasta, soup and salad, and design your own large pizza! And of course, can't forget pizookies and beer! On point! Each bite of the pizza was just bursting with flavor and just enough crisp. Pizookies still stand for the best here as it was first introduced to me 10 years ago. Thank you to our server for assisting with the app and telling us more about it. He even helped apply our order with their Rewards program and helped us save $5 with the promo on the app!  We will definitely be back!"
Dejah A.,"Rialto, CA",2,63,15,5.0,11/16/2016,"This is my go to place! They have never failed me, I've ordered everything from the fish tacos (my fav) to the ravioli to the pizza and my boyfriend orders steaks a burgers, it always satisfies. My boyfriend loves coming here for the variety of beers and they offer his favorite stouts, they even mix them to make new concoctions. I always order mixed drinks which actually could be a hit or miss. Sometimes they delicious other times I barley taste liquor or it's straight up nasty. We always order the monkey bread pazookie, it's warm and gooey with a bit of crunch with the cold vanilla ice cream, it's the best."
Donita B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",138,48,63,4.0,8/1/2016,Came here to celebrate parents' anniversary. Love love love the Greek chicken pita tacos. Waitress gave a great recommendation for beer to pair with my brother's spaghetti. Mixed up his order but did a very good job fixing it in a timely manner. Also must come for the pizookies!
Ivan T.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",200,23,16,5.0,1/27/2017,I went in Sunday night. The service was awesome. Had a pizookie which never disappoints. Unfortunately I forgot something. I spoke with multiple managers and a representative from Corporate and they reimbursed me and made the whole experience easy. All around I've never been treated so well for losing something before. Miss Thompson was so kind when I was able to stop by again.
Lesley S.,"San Antonio, TX",939,1200,1290,4.0,7/27/2014,"Came here as an impromptu date with the Hubsters. He had been coming to this location for years sans marrying the best thing that ever happened to him :)  Came in on a Friday night after a hellacious drive to LAX. All I needed was I wanted a beer... Like 8 of them. They happened to have a 8 beer flight that was not on the menu. ($10.95) my favorite by far was the Goliath Imperial Red (seasonal).  There was a lot of good options on the menu but after looking at other people's deep dish pizza I decided that's what I wanted. They had mini deep dish pizzas that were 6 inch and 4 slices. These were doughy (melt in your mouth kind). I ordered a BJ special. (House made meatballs, sausage, bell peppers, onion, mushrooms)  He ordered the Pepperoni Extreme with an add on of jalapeños. Both super good. Our waitress was on point with our food and beer. She could explain then to a T including the fact the hefeweizen had a banana taste not your typical citrus. We were totally ok with that. I'm drinking anything that is mainland style right now that I can. Good restaurant and busy. They deserve the good review."
Anaid C.,"Ontario, CA",174,94,37,1.0,4/17/2016,"So many things wrong with this place. I used to like it now I don't ever want to come back. 1st off, they took forever to seat us. People with bigger parties would come in and they would be seated within minutes and every time I asked, they would say we were next which was a lie. I called to check if they made reservations and they said no only for more than 10 which was a lie bc I later found out they did take reservations for less than 10. Then, a party of like 15 came in 30 mins after us and I asked them if they had a reservation and they said no. Sure enough, a few mins later they got called. I walked up in a fury and FINALLY got seated. That's already bad.  Next, the waitress was fine. Not much against her just took a while to bring the silverware but she was nice. The food wasn't worth an hr wait. Everything, including my friends salad, was salty. How do you mess up a salad? Lol also, the servers were just standing around talking by our booth and were being obnoxious and saying weird things which was a lil uncomfortable. I've been to other bjs and have had great service so this is disappointing.  Don't come here. Go to the yardhouse instead. The food and service is so much better!"
Holly Y.,"Anaheim, CA",0,31,3,5.0,7/23/2017,"Food and service was excellent!  We were seated immediately!  (Olive Garden had a 45 minute wait.) I ordered the watermelon and feta salad.  It was the most refreshing, tasty salad I have eaten in a long time.  it was topped with fresh, cold watermelon, marinated red onions and a generous portion of feta.  The dressing was delicious.  My husband had the mediterranean pizza, which went well with my salad.  After our meal we decided to order the churro and ice cream dessert.  It was more scrumptious than expected.  It came hot served with a very generous double scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It was wonderful!  The best thing of all was the service.  Che was very attentive and friendly.  I thanked him over and over again.  He came by often to check on us and was just exceptional.  Thank you for a wonderful, enjoyable meal!"
Bobby S.,"San Dimas, CA",4,7,,4.0,7/23/2017,"My wife and I have been here several times. The most recent visit was not a great experience. I'm not gonna go into detail and I'm not gonna review based on that experience alone - because, well, everybody has bad days and I believe it's how one reacts to these bad days that counts (sorry about the run on). The day after our dinner, BJs sent an online survey ... which I decided to take to inform them of our visit. I've never filled one of these out - probably because I don't believe anybody that matters would ever read them. I was very surprised to get a personal email back from the senior manager not only apologizing for my experience but discussing how he would use my review to better train/educate his current and any new team members. That email among some other things really made me appreciate the customer service at this place. We will definitely be back! Thank you Doug for taking the time to listen, I'm sure I speak for many of us yelpers when I say we appreciate it!"
Christine L.,"Upland, CA",1,30,18,1.0,4/4/2016,"We come here every year for my birthday because thus far, I loved eating here and getting a birthday pizookie...  That all changed after last night. I refuse to come back, even for the pizookie..  It started bad from the get go.. We put our name on the waiting list for a party of 4. Luckily, we were seated faster than the time quoted. We arrive at the booth and, the table and booth were dirty. So the hostess told us to wait, so she could get a rag to wipe it off with. She leaves and doesnt come back for 5 minutes. Meanwhile my boyfriend and I decided to sit, while my parents stayed standing. She comes back, wipes the booth, then the table and booth are really wet. My mom sat down and her pants ended up all wet because of it. She took her silverware out of her napkin so we could all use it to wipe down the wetness on the table top. Our server came along and she was great. Had no problems with her. Everything was also arriving in a timely manner, she was refilling our drinks anytime they started to get low. My boyfriend ordered the chicken alfredo, no broccoli. I ordered the sirloin (med rare), my dad got the deep dish pizza, and my mom also got the sirloin (med). Our food came out in a timely manner. First off, my boyfriend had broccoli in his chicken alfredo, which was no big deal, I picked it out for him. Then, I cut into my steak and it was raw. Literally, RAW. My mom cut into hers and instead of medium..it was med rare. So, steak lovers beware, they undercook their steaks, so be sure to order the temp above what you want. The waitress came over after the food runners brought us our food and I pointed out how rare my steak was. She took it back immediately to get it back on the grill and in the meantime, brought me out some fresh mashed potatoes. When she brought my steak back, I cut into it in a different spot in the middle, and it was still too raw to eat! I wouldn't even say it was rare..I can eat rare steaks.. This was completely raw. So she said she could get another steak on the grill for me and tell her manangers, so I said okay, that'd be great.. She also noticed the chicken alfredo had broccoli because I had put it on the first plate she took back, so she also asked if we had recieved broccoli in the alfredo or with the steak.. thinking maybe the food runners got the wrong plate. But, unfortunately..it came with the alfredo. The managers came over to the table, comped my steak and the alfredo. I asked them for it to go because everyone was already done eating..so happy birthday to me, I got to eat sides for my birthday dinner.. at least the broccoli cheddar soup was delicious. I also want to say that the steak I got to go was also still very raw, I had to cut it up, microwave it, and it cooked it to the right temp.. I saved half for the next morning and had it with some eggs. I was able to cook the steak to the temp I had originally wanted, MEDIUM RARE.. not raw. All of this, and not to mention, my sweet boyfriend hadn't eaten all day..but since my food wasn't coming out right, he sat there and waited and waited with me, while his food got cold. Time was up and he had to get a to-go box as well. This of course wasn't on the restaraunt, but if they had gotten it right at all, we both would have been able to enjoy a long awaited meal. He also wanted me to mention, dont get the chicken alfredo. It was basically noodles and chicken. There was an extremely small amount of alfredo sauce, if any. The noodles were some how burnt, or crisped. It's almost as if they add the noodles to the alfredo sauce in a pan and leave it there to sit. It was disgusting, but he was hungry and he still ate it when we got home.  Anyways, to top all of last night off, the rude hostess that sat us walked by our table twice with her phone out, texting! Also, after the managers came to our table, we saw them not even 5 minutes later at another table, then a different table after that! Obviously they need to figure something out if they're having that many problems. It had never been this bad the past 2 years we came here for my birthday. This was a complete 180° in the wrong direction. I also would like to point out that I had worked in a steakhouse for 4 years at one point. I was hostess, food runner and then moved up to server. The hostess and food runners at BJ's were unprofessional, uncourteous, and not how I would have ever treated any of the patrons in the restaraunt I worked at. The server we had on the other hand was excellent, she handled everything very well and we were very grateful for her service."
Ryan G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,11,2,5.0,1/29/2017,"We had a great experience the moment we walked to our table. As we arrived to our table it was being cleaned off by a fantastic young man named Vince. He was polite, courteous, and quite thorough, oh and I might say he was very handsome. From there on out we had an excellent experience at BJ's! Way to go BJ's!  Oh try the meat lovers pizza and the red beer!!! To die for!!!"
Leo C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",9,57,33,1.0,6/27/2015,"Worst BJs ever. Long wait to sit down, despite several empty tables. Snakebite didn't come layered. It came mixed.  My bbq bison burger didn't have bbq sauce. And it came with some terrible salad. I didn't even know we could switch it out for other sides. Server barely paid any attention. Even when we paid with two cards, the server didn't check the back of the receipt to see how it was going to be split, not asked us.  Never coming back. Can't believe we waited for this.  Waste of time. Waste of calories. Waste of money. 0 stars is more appropriate."
M K.,"Fullerton, CA",3,29,6,4.0,7/12/2017,"Asked to change channel to ball game 3 times before changed. Other than that, food was good (like always) and service was good (except tv situation)."
Angelique R.,"Fontana, CA",131,125,15,2.0,10/21/2016,"I've recently been to this location a lot and have to say each time it's a huge let down. I ordered my food to go, grilled cheese and some wings for my husband and good thing I check my bag because they didn't put my grilled cheese. Then when dining inside and ordering a baked pasta dish the center of my meal was ICE COLD. I mean shockingly cold! I called the manager Doug over and explained the issue and was never even given an ""I'm sorry,"" he just said he will take my word for it and then didn't even remove it from our bill. Soooo you give me frozen penne pasta and Expect me to pay for it? The waitresses and waiters are always very nice but very slow. In a 2 hour period my water was refilled maybe twice? Just disappointing."
J R.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,,2.0,4/11/2017,"Went to one if my faves but was seriously disappointed with the food and service. My daughter and I sat in the bar and ordered appetizers and a couple drinks.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls and the portobello mushroom appetizers and also ordered individual mozzarella tomato small bite salads for both of us. The egg rolls were chincy and cost a couple bucks more than I remember and the mushrooms were so greasy we couldn't eat them.  The salads were okay but lacked the normal flavor from the fresh basil.  Our server was in another world and appeared to be more into himself then he was our table.  I will give them one more try since they are one of my faves and I love the fact that they change out their menu often,  but if my next visit is as bad as my past visit, then it will be my last visit."
Vira P.,"San Francisco, CA",336,1141,1134,4.0,6/23/2015,"Standard BJ's Restaurant affair.  My family and I ordered the avocado egg rolls, roasted Brussels sprouts, two pizzas, salmon, and a pizookie.  They are all pretty good, just like at the other establishments.  But the one dish that stood out was the sprouts that were roasted with a mild Sriracha sauce.  It gave it a good kick and complemented the smoky flavor. Our waitress looked like she had a long night, but she was still friendly and attentive.  She also sent a mini pizookie for my sister to celebrate her graduation. The four stars is really for the service.  But you won't be disappointed with the food."
Sandy M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",90,103,834,2.0,9/22/2015,"Today was a business lunch visit.   Service. ... slow, inconsistent,  never received a water refill  Cleanliness. ... just ok Food. ... soup bowl or cup is the same size... I had the soup and pizza lunch $7.25. Food was average.  Pizza is too sweet and doughy I truly don't understand why they are always so busy,  it's not worth the wait.   Enter at your own risk"
Rachelle T.,"Simi Valley, CA",367,48,1,5.0,5/31/2016,"The wonderful host i talked about in my last review got moved up to server.  She did an amazing job.  My biggest pet peeve is asking for a water refill, She was on top of our drink the whole time!  She also made great food suggestions.  I got the Brussels sprouts appetizer. It was fanatic. It was sweet but a little spicy at the same time!  Thank you again, for another great experience."
Jacque O.,"Ontario, CA",85,10,,5.0,1/24/2017,The food was amazing! The staff was so kind and gave good customer service!i sat outside  was very nice! I would recommend this place
