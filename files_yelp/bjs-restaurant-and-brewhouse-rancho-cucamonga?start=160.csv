Bimal S.,"Corona, CA",1,5,1,2.0,4/23/2016,Horrible Horrible Service. Even the manager didn't have any good customer service. The server's are good but I the management team Needs to be replaced.
Chris c.,"Long Beach, CA",0,64,5,4.0,4/9/2017,Went for dinner tonight. Great food-great services-but terrible greeters at the counter. No eye contact-no smiles-they were more interested in their computer screen and talking to co workers than smiling and greeting customers. The young lady who sat us at a table was like a robot who memorized her speech. No eye contact but gave her stupid speech without looking at us to say have a great meal (or whatever she said). My suggestion to the  Rancho management is get rid of the front desk crew that was there tonight and replace them all with teenagers that want to work and know how to give customer service.
Ronald M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",53,36,76,5.0,9/13/2015,"Nothing much to complain about this place during this visit. Big improvement since last I came here.  During my last visit no one helped us for 15-20 however the manager fixed things by taking care of us and providing us with a free dessert or appetizer.  During this visit, I had ordered smaller meals. I ordered the crispy calamari, wedge cut fries, and sweet pig pizza. I've been going to BJs brewery for a while so it was pretty similar across every location I've been to.  I ordered a tickled pink drink and that was pretty good. I had a sweet tooth that night so if you want a girly fruity drink then that's your best bet.  Service was really good. Our waiter helped us and checked on us very frequently. Everything came out in a timely manner.  Don't have any big complaints. Only little one is that they took a while to clear some our plates when they were clearly finished."
Maint. O.,"Nashville, TN",0,20,,4.0,7/29/2016,"Great selection of beer and food. I ended up ordering the Blackened Rib Eye, and was surprised at how good it was. I also ordered the calamari as my appetizer, great stuff. I ate at the bar but watched the entire room and everyone was smiling and having a great time. The bar tender, Colton, was very quick, and made sure everyone a the bar was taken care of. Great customer service, management had a few issues to address, and they did great. I will definitely be eating here the next time I'm in Ontario for business."
Ambrose W.,"Riverside, CA",82,11,3,5.0,1/24/2017,Our server Dominique was great. The food is always so good here and so is the service. Chevys never disappoints.  I would recommend to all especially for Taco Tuesday and for birthdays!
Anthony B.,"Brea, CA",0,98,1,4.0,12/14/2016,"Good food, good service. I have never had a bad experience at BJ's Food is always good, never an issue or problem as it's pretty good. Mahi-mahi tacos were excellent"
Jess H.,"Dayton, OH",81,240,283,3.0,5/14/2015,"This is a nice restaurant and bar that is a level or so above Applebees... with better food and decent prices. I went with a large group and the majority of us enjoyed our dishes.  I personally ordered a BLT salad and tomato bisque in a bread bowl.  BEST bread bowl I've ever had... and the tomato bisque was good. Couldn't beat the price of it either at just under $6.  I thoroughly enjoyed the salad... the combination of the toppings were awesome. And my strawberry margarita was delicious. :) My friend ordered a $10 appetizer of calamari. While the portion size was fair, the dish was served at cold (at room temperature) and seemed to lack flavor and crisp.  The server was decent, but a bit disorganized. A few of the final bills were incorrect.  Now, I'll definitely revisit this place... but I wouldn't plan on ever getting a serious entree here... just a light lunch or a snack. But then again, this was my first impression, so we'll see upon the return visit!"
Mary L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,9,,4.0,9/3/2016,"Menu selection was extensive. Had the Ahi Poke as well as the fresh watermelon and feta salad for appetizers. Poke sauce tasted good, and both dishes combined had 490 calories!! Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl decent enough. Ambiance is great with a very lively atmosphere. WiFi could use a little boost. Overall I would try again."
Tina Y.,"Eastvale, CA",145,39,11,5.0,3/6/2016,"Had Jessica H as our waitress and she was awesome!!!!!! Had the raspberry beer per her recommendations and it was so good. Hubby had the new Ziti pasta and it was really. Food came out hot and promptly and didn't have to ask for refills once. Great service and food ;) One tip... maybe have your main hostess (long hair with glasses) not so damn miserable. Before we were seated I noticed people coming in and she didn't politely greet them or even look up for that matter. You are the first and last impression, it's ok to smile I promise."
Alexandria P.,"Chino, CA",81,54,13,2.0,11/25/2016,Well let's see for starters it took 15-20 min to get our drinks. Then it takes an additional 30-40 min for our food to come out. When we get it 3 meals were cold. Our waiter was really nice and I am thankful we had a nice waiter. The service is extremely slow and food comes out either luke warm or cold.. now on to the bathrooms. When you go to the bathroom the stalls do not lock. A lady almost walked in on me. The toilet paper was on the floor.. eww. There was trash on the floor as well. Now if you don't mind being in an environment like that then cool be my guest and spend 2+ hours for something that shouldn't take that long. I hope they either hire more staff or get things in order. I will not return to this location and will tell all my friends and family the same. Very disappointed in the service for the price I paid for it.
Juan G.,"Riverside, CA",3,5,2,5.0,1/17/2017,I got really good service! And you can't go wrong with getting a couple snakebites and pizza!! The pizza was really good! I recommend it!!!
Desiree D.,"West Covina, CA",0,14,,5.0,5/24/2017,The only reason for the 5 star review is Ali the new GM! She was very apologetic and rectified the horrible experience that we encountered. Hopefully other managers will follow her lead and make this rancho bjs a positive place again!
Yvette C.,"Ontario, CA",24,41,10,3.0,4/17/2016,"Service was okay, it took a long time to just get out drinks, maybe 10 minutes. They may have been understaffed. My son and I sat in the patio area. When the waitress brought our food we asked for the pazookie that way we didn't have to wait a long time... Still waited a long time. They actually came out at the same time our neighbors did and I had ordered mine about 15 minutes prior to them. Total dining time there was about 2 hours long. The food was just okay nothing special about the Hawaiian pizza and wings. Pazookie was delicious though! Next time we'll just stop by for dessert. Oh and my utensils were dirty kinda gross but I didn't have to use them."
Victor V.,"Pomona, CA",6,49,4,1.0,5/8/2017,"Hello I've reached out the general manager for the location in Ontario, CA 91764. I visited the establishment on Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at around 1:30 pm. Upon being seated I waited for over 15 minutes for my waitress to acknowledge my friend, my partner and I. When she did decide to help us, she was very rude and inattentive to our orders. My friend mentioned that she has a severe allergy to certain things and the waitress decided it was appropriate to let out a deep sigh and completely failed to acknowledge her request. When taking our order she didn't bother to look at us at all. It took 20 minutes after that to get 3 cups of water... and during those 20 mins she was extra attentive and friendly to the table next to us. When she brought out our waters she managed to slam them on the table spilling mine all over and just walked away. I reached out to the hostess and asked to be moved immediately. She made me feel worthless. I was made felt like it was a race or sexual orientation ordeal for her. When I expressed my concerns to the manager on duty, he did nothing. No apology and no compassion. I used to regularly frequent this restaurant, but at this moment, I do not see myself going back to any of your locations; especially after having a ""manager"" reach out to me on yelp asking me to email him, then completely ignoring me. I hope this message is taken seriously and that someone does something to make this right."
Carol E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,,5.0,1/11/2017,Have come here several times and have always had great service and the food is yummy. My favorite is the watermelon salad in the summer or the wedge anytime. The salted caramel pizookie is the BEST. BJs is also very supportive of our community. Really appreciate that. Great family restaurant. Call ahead and put your name in to decrease the wait time.
Brett H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/13/2017,I got food poisoning from their clam crowder bowl. I'll never go there again in my life .
Amanda A.,"Riverside, CA",24,64,70,3.0,6/5/2015,"If you've been to BJ's you know what to expect. I, myself am no longer thrilled with the chain. We visited this location on a Thursday evening and I think this will be my last. I should start by saying our server was great, and the staff is pretty good... Our chicken wings came late and cold, we sent them back and got a new batch, they were great. Our server did apologize. They no longer offer the thinner crust pizza, only deep dish and a tavern style. We tried the tavern, although I wouldn't say it was worth $15. I tried the feta watermelon salad, $4.95 and very small.  Overall, the experience was mediocre."
Karla W.,"San Clemente, CA",89,4,,1.0,9/20/2016,"Went there to get some dinner on a tuesday , first they said the wait was 5-10mins it was more than that , which was understandable since they had big parties waiting, so no biggie there...We finally got seated waitress no where to be seen 10-15mins go by and the hostes comes by to tell us that our waitress is a little busy but she could get us some drinks. My husband and i have had a long day and were starving so we asked if we can order an appetizer and our food as well she said it was fine , that she could take outlr order.  We ordered boneless wings buffalo sauce , we got bone-in original sauce, we asked them to remake it . I ordered a watermelon margarita it was waaay to sweet 2/5, i asked a waitress which to my surprise was our waitress if she can have them remake it but less sweet, she said i would have to choose a different one because it would come out pretty much the same . I know about margaritas since i work in a restaurant industry and i know that you can make anything less sweet if requested . I said okay its fine and just ordered a skinny margarita which was waay better . 5/5  As we are waiting for the new appetizer we got our food! Wait whatt?! At this point we just wanna eat and get out . The pasta that we orded was cold and you could tell that it was sitting for a while . The pizza we ordered was dropped off but we didnt have any plates to share , 5 mins go by until our waitress comes by to check on us and we asked her for plates, she brought them . We had one slice and couldnt wait to get out of there.  Asked for boxes , payed and left. Not even dessert which we never skip .  Service very very poor , manager came by and apologized but it just wasnt the same.  Our server seemed like she didnt even care about it"
Jaqui E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,12,2,1.0,2/26/2017,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. My child' got food poisoning. She ordered the chicken tenders with fries. First off, she found a fried shrimp in her food. Next, she stated that the chicken tenders were a little soggy in the middle. So she took off what is supposed to be the ""crispy"" skin and are the chicken. About 2 hours later, she had terrible cramps followed by diarrhea and vomiting. We will not be returning to BJ's again."
Roberta S.,"Fontana, CA",186,15,2,2.0,2/22/2017,We've been here a few times and the service is typically the same. It's not horrible but isn't great or even good. There's normally 2-3 people at the host desk laughing talking they all look irritated when you walk up asking for a table no matter the size of the party. If you do decide to do the seat yourself bar area the wait to get to order any food  is almost 30 mins. So we got seated at a small table. When the server came over to us she was short in her conversation. Came off almost annoyed that we only wanted to order drinks and appetizers and needed a few mins for our main courses. The appetizers were brought by a different person she never checked to see that we were satisfied. When she did come back we ordered our food and asked for another drink to which she seemed annoyed again. The food was served in a quick time. After eating our food and waiting 15mins we had to ask someone to find our server so we could order another drink and dessert. After that person took our order and brought it to us our original server came over to us to ask if we wanted the check or any dessert. She looked shocked when she seen that we had already had dessert. So overall the food is always great but the service is a 50/50 on decent to not so good!
