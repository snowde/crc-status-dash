Mike F.,"Fontana, CA",145,107,50,3.0,10/9/2016,We liked the food. It wasn't incredible but it was good. The $4 Bloody Mary's were great and the five of us got out for around $100 including five lunch plates and two drinks from the bar. What was missing? None of the servers smiled and some of them seemed downright depressed. One looked so unhappy somebody thought something horrible might have just happened to them. We tipped well because it appeared to be throughout the place. Service was also a little slow but I'd come back again.
Liz V.,"Upland, CA",98,28,21,5.0,5/30/2016,Came here for my bday dinner it was so good! Had the bacon burger and let me tell you it was the best our waiter was very friendly and helpful when it was time to choose some drinks for the night wish I would have got his name because he was attentive the whole time.
XO X.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",38,208,16,2.0,2/20/2017,"Came here yesturday (Sunday February 19th) for a work dinner. Majority of our group arrived at 6:30pm and we got seated right away which was nice. Once we got seated our waitress took our drink order and appetizer order right away which was also nice. The downfall was when we got our appetizers we ask for silverware for the whole table and the waitress said she would get it. 15 mins later no silverware so we asked again. By this time the food was almost gone and we just ate with our hands. The waitress was gone for SO LONG. We could see her walking past us helping others but didn't stop to ask if we were ready to order or if we needed new drinks. About 20 mins later we finally ordered (mind you we were beyond exhausted at this point) the salads came out and still no silverware, we asked again but no one brought any so my coworker ate her salad with her fingers and the other one didn't eat her salad until someone brought us silverware after asking 4 times. Once we ordered the food took SO long I believe we waited about 30-40 mins for our food. Everyone was extremely tired and ready to just leave. Overall we got there at 6:30 and left past 8:30pm mostly just waiting the whole time. The steaks were really good but the appetizers came out cold and flavorless. We use to come here a lot for work gatherings but we probley won't be back for awhile"
Claudia T.,"Redlands, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/3/2017,Great service and staff. Very attentive and welcoming. Never seen such a well rounded group of people that seemed to enjoy working there. Food is always excellent as always!
Richard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2166,1132,7048,4.0,2/5/2015,"BJ is a bit similar to yard house, they target similar customer.  I enjoy this over TGIF or Danny.  The price different isn't big, but BJ offer more choices and more important better food. Their lunch special here is pretty decent, some of people in the group wasn't too happy with the portion. I am more than satisfied with my order which is the chicken stripes with wedge fries.  Those were one of better tasty chicken stripes.  The fries could be better but again this is lunch around $7 is a good deal."
Ricardo G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",810,356,394,4.0,3/21/2014,"This place is awesome. They have great beer selections and great food! Their food pairings are also awesome!! If you never had a chance to attend a food pairing event, at B.J.'s, you are missing out!! The place is pretty large as well, and the atmosphere is pretty laid back. Dimmed lights through out the restaurant. Bathrooms are also very well kept."
Nathan D.,"Pomona, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/10/2016,If your trying to eat here I advise you to book hours in advance. This place takes so long to get you a table and thats just the beginning of it all. It was so packed too many people at this location no space. After an hour and a half of waiting for a table we waited another hour almost two for our food. Either book in advance or go somewhere else and definitely do not come starving because its just a really long wait
Reema S.,"Glendora, CA",3,7,,1.0,9/18/2016,Today we went to the BJ's at rancho. This is not our first time going to a BJs restaurant but first for this location. The food and service was so disappointing. We ordered the calamari for our appetizers and it was way way way over cooked. Over cooked to the point that it was like rubber! Our drinks took longer to arrive than our appetizer. My husband ordered an old fashion but they couldn't make it since they were out of bitters. Seriously? You are know for your bar and you are out of bitters?!! The food was ok since we got just burgers. The service was horrible. No one came to even check why our appetizer plate was still there? Not going back to this location ever. Sorry.
Jay N.,"Riverside, CA",9,67,77,1.0,8/29/2016,"Dined here on August 28th @ around 10:30 pm sat in the bar area. I've never been so upset with dining at a Bj's my entire life. The blonde server had the biggest stank attitude ever!!!! we ordered avocado rolls as an appetizer and our food came out with no drinks or utensils or plates?! The hostess noticed because we kept looking around for a server so she approached us and said did you guys need utensils? Then when we were ready to order she approached us like we were bothering her so much. I honestly did not even enjoy anything I ordered which was a Bj's favorite pizza, clam chowder and a avocado bacon burger with fries. I waved down another server to get boxes just take everything home to eat it. I should of just dined at a regular table instead of the bar. I probably won't be back at this Bj's location anymore. That was by far the worst service I've had ever."
Lisa W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,15,4,4.0,12/5/2016,"I haven't eaten at BJ's in years. I stopped by with my daughter on Thursday night and had a Good time. They had happy hour until the end of the NFL game. Great. The avocado spring rolls and parmesan chicken was Really good. Samia, our waitress, was phenomenal. Very patient and kind. I only gave 4 stars because I think some of the menu items are way over priced."
Ken W.,"Milford, NH",0,15,,3.0,12/27/2016,"I've been to this place several times and this is reflective of my last visit.  I usually sit in the bar area where it is first come, first served.  Server was friendly and attentive.  Ordered a beer (Lightswitch) which is a good light brew.  Then ordered a salad and the shrimp & asparagus pasta.  For whatever reason, the pasta came out, and then it was followed with the salad.  I usually prefer a better sequenced meal, so I told the server to forget about salad.  Not sure if they were put off by it some, but they said they will remove it from my tab and then brought it back out and said it was complementary.  No big deal, although it looked good I didn't touch it.   The pasta was only OK.  Flavor was so-so and it was on the warm side, vs. hot.  Texture was good.  I wouldn't order this again as they have a large menu to choose from.  In the past, I've had the burgers, tavern pizza, other pasta plates, etc. with decent results. Overall, this place is good.  Always busy for sure, but the food could be hit or miss."
Ricky D.,"Cambridge, MA",0,34,33,2.0,5/2/2015,"I never like eating at enormous, loud restaurants like this BJ's. It feels like a vast feeding ground; they put in in your little pen and feed you. The music is so loud you can't comfortably talk across the table, and that makes it difficult to have a nice relaxed meal. All that aside, the food at the BJ's was pretty good. When my mom and I came here we started off with drinks: she had a mojito and I had a margarita. They were served in great big glasses - the same type used for water - and I gotta say that I prefer my margaritas with a little salt along the rim. Even so, both drinks were pretty good. We had fried artichoke hearts for an appetizer, which were kind of what you'd expect and pretty tasty as fried food goes. We then split the chopped chicken salad. Apparently BJ's is set up for people to do this (good thing too, since all their entrees are enormous!), so the salad came out of the kitchen already put on two plates. The salad was also pretty good. Our waitress was also extremely nice. :) Overall, it was a reasonably priced meal with fairly good food. I just personally hate eating in restaurants like this. Nothing can make up for the fact that you can't carry on a conversation without shouting."
Jon B.,"Honolulu, HI",262,8,9,4.0,10/26/2015,"There isn't a BJ's in Honolulu. So I make it a point to visit one whenever I travel. BJ's deep dish pizza is a definite must try. I'm not a crusty-bready pizza type of guy, but there is something about BJ's deep dish! The flavor and the texture will keep you coming back!  I seriously crave their pizza!  You can order the pizza in various sizes from small to larger portions that are perfect to be shared among a group of friends.  Order the Best Beginnings appetizer sampler...its a good deal and a great start to your meal. The avocado rolls and spinach dip are also a definite must try. The atmosphere at BJ's is great for happy hour, a group outing and even a family dinner. Great service, awesome atmosphere and the some of the best deep dish that won't leave you disappointed."
Juan C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",9,19,4,5.0,10/28/2016,The wait was long as usual for a Friday night but worth the wait. Food was perfect. The only complaint I have is that I asked for a cup of coffee while we waited outside for an our and the said they couldn't serve until I had a table..
Marina B.,"Fontana, CA",34,77,67,5.0,8/7/2016,We had by far the best experience today. Normally our service isn't that amazing but our waiter Lex was on point with our service. Great attitude and food and service. Manager came over and checked on us as well. Good work !
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,3.0,2/8/2016,"Kinda disappointed to give them only 3 stars, but this is solely based on our experience at this particular location. Dinned here on Saturday night approx. 10 PM. We had a party of 20 that arrived after a Gymnastic Meet at the Convention Center near by. Was told the wait would be about 30-40 minute. They were able to seat us quicker than the estimated time which was great! We had only one server. Her name was Kayla. Drink orders took a little time, but we were okay with that since we were all socializing. Hoping our meal orders would go much better as it seemed the dinning area had cleared out and they weren't to busy at that point. We all ordered and our meals took over 30 minutes to arrive to the table. This should be blamed on the kitchen -not the server. Many of the meals were cold. I had the vegetable Penne Primavera: it wasn't even warm, could tell it sat and I was the last one served too! The green bell peppers in the pasta were undercooked  ( still very crunchy) and the pieces were so large it was not enjoyable. Many other unhappy patrons in our party. Brussels Sprouts were not cooked through: bitter and a fish and chips meal was over cooked with pieces of burned fish. Our server didn't get the staff help and support she needed for such a large party, but she did her best. NOTE: We were there for about two hours total. The music as the evening progressed seemed to get louder for the bar flies & we all had a hard time speaking to one another too!"
Joop V.,"Seattle, WA",220,815,503,3.0,2/1/2015,"A group of us stopped by BJ's to watch Super Bowl as it is one of the bars that is closest to the hotel we were staying while we were traveling for work. The bar is actually quite spacious and there were big TV screens that really allowed you to watch the game quite well. The food, however, was a meh. I ordered a Cherry-Chipotle glazed baked salmon partly because it was supposed to be a lighter dish on the menu. My salmon came on a bed of couscous, spinach and asparagus, but what threw me off what how sweet the glazed was and how drench the couscous was in that sauce. It was definitely way overly sweet. Another thing that threw me off was that I think the dish was supposed to come with a side salad, but I was never offered the choice to choose the salad or any salad at all. Granted, I wasn't that hungry so I didn't bother to ask my waitress for it, but it was definitely odd that my preference for the salad wasn't asked and not a single side salad was brought out. Overall, BJ's is just an ok place to hang out and eat something. Service was just ok-slightly below average...we didn't really get a lot of attention for the table (maybe our waitress was just busy with all the Super Bowl crowd in the house). Food was downright a let down. If I had a choice to pick a place around the areas again, I probably want to explore other places that may offer better food."
Niyati P.,"West Los Angeles, CA",433,54,165,3.0,3/25/2016,"Its a franchise, so its pretty consistent throughout.  Location: This location, in particular was pretty big with ample seating indoors, at the bar, and outdoors. Surprisingly, pretty busy for a midday 3pm meal.  Food: The food is alright (very heavy throughout), its the dessert that really makes it. The Avocado Egg rolls are great for any avocado fans but it is definitely very heavy and rich which may not sit well with many. The deep-dish pizza are also more dough than toppings + cheese. 3 hours later I'm still overly full from not that big of a portion. However, that shouldn't stop anyone from getting dessert. Their infamous pizookies are great but even a bit much to split, 3 people is probably optimal. They also do half and half flavors for those who can't compromise or want to try a new flavor.  Overall: As a franchise, it has may options especially for a big group but I still like to stick to my mom and pop/independent places. Midday/Happy Hour time is best time to go unless you want to be uncomfortable full throughout the night. Like most Italian places, too heavy for dinner.  Bonus: Make sure you use the Yelp $10 off deal! The servers at first were confused about it, but it worked!"
Kristina V.,"Upland, CA",47,5,1,1.0,11/20/2016,"One star because I have to give a star. This is the worst service I have ever experienced at BJs. We had no one take the order of two kids at our table, 3 meals were wrong. We haven't had a manager check on us at all. We had to ask for all drinks to be filled - even water."
Britney S.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,14,4,5.0,11/20/2016,Love BJ'S!! They have such a large menu and great choices!! I frequent this place and service is usually really good.  Food always comes out promptly as well.  The have a really good cocktail selection too.
