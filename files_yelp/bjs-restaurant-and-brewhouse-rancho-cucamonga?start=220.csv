Chanese H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",13,61,91,5.0,11/22/2014,"Came in here last night: which was a Friday night, with my best friend.  I called ahead and put our name down on a reservation list. Which was perfect because there was a busy seating area. We walked in and was seated immediately.  First of all i am not a fan of beer. However, I had to get a Hangar 24. Probably the only beer i will EVER drink. We were not super hungry so we both just orderd small plates and appetizers. She got the pizza dip which is good. And I got the fresh mozzarella and tomatoe salad. Yumm And then we shared the carnitas fries. Omg they were delicious. The fries are skinny and there is plenty of cheese, green sauce, carnitas and cilantro on top to cover all of the fries.  Then for dessert we ordered the peanut butter smores. It was delicious.  Overall I had a good dinning experience here last night"
Michaela L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,2,1.0,7/23/2016,I have never experienced worse service in my life.  Are you guys short staffed or what?  There's plenty of people who need a job and they can probably do it a whole lot better than what you have now.  I have been to this joke of a restaurant four times.  FOUR TIMES.  I waited an entire hour for a salad and it was delivered with scraps of lettuce by a rude waiter.  The manager of this pathetic excuse of a business hid in the back and left.  I'll give you a round of applause for being the biggest waste there is.  Congrats on being trash.
Jennifer G.,"La Puente, CA",184,3,,5.0,10/30/2016,"Today a friend and I went to have lunch here, the reason being was we had a project to do where we both had to be ""deaf"" for the meal. from the very beginning our waitress, Amber, was patient and trying to communicate with us. when we had to order our food she brought another waitress to help interpret the specific that we wanted for our meal. I really appreciated this because she was patient and tried to still do her best even though we couldn't verbally communicate with her. A++++ to her managers!"
Grace C.,"Fontana, CA",120,7,23,5.0,3/20/2016,"I planned a surprise baby shower for a coworker and made reservations for 24 people on Friday 3/18/2016.  The gal who booked my reservations was very polite and explained all the rules for a big party to me.  She mentioned that they can only do 4 separate checks and we would have a 2 hour time limit.   We arrived exactly at 11 am and the opening hostess was very nice.  They even gave us a separate table for the gifts.  Our server was Ronald E. and he was great. He had another gal helping him but I forgot her name.  I was also very pleased with her.  Ronald allowed us to have as many separate checks as we wanted.  That really helped decrease the headache of trying to figure costs at the end.   My son had the beer battered fish n chips and I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and we shared.  We thought both dishes were delicious. The serving size was perfect and we were both satisfied. I'm pretty sure the rest of the party enjoyed their meal as well.  I saw quite a few completely cleaned up plates.    The manager came up to one of my friends and noticed that we moved all our presents to a different table.  She thought that we were asked to do that and apologized.  Actually, a very nice waitress came up to me and asked if I would like the presents closer to us.  She said the lunch crowd is coming and was afraid that the presents was too far from us. She even helped us move all the presents.  Thank you!  After lunch, our celebrant even opened up all her presents.  We never felt rushed.  Overall, the shower was a great success.  Thanks again to Ronald and the manager and all the servers that helped make our shower a success.   I have to admit, I used to come to this location numerous times before but stopped coming after we tried to celebrate my daughters graduation.  We had a party of 12 and waited for over an hour and still didn't get seated.  We ended up leaving and eating elsewhere.   I'm glad I decided to give this place another try. I was not disappointed."
Chloe C.,"Fontana, CA",8,3,1,3.0,10/27/2016,"Great local joint. One of the only places doing by the slice. Great unique pizza options. Cool atmosphere. For the money, this place is hard to beat. Pretty Lively, not a good place for intimate conversation."
Troy C.,"Phelan, CA",1,38,,5.0,1/2/2017,"It's Monday, January 2 and we just left BJ's. It was very crowded (Rose Bowl night). Our wait was typical at about 30 minutes. The hostess who I believe was probably the manager was very professional and friendly. Our server was ""Daima"" I think. No name tags on the employees that I saw. Anyway, our service was great, despite the fact they were very busy. The food was fantastic. We had a great time. Thanks."
Laydee B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",20,37,19,3.0,3/14/2016,"The vibe at this location is consistently nice. The food, especially the pizza and the desserts, is good enough to spend time with friends and family. The only issue that's consistent at this location is the service. Usually it's the quoted time that's off about 15 minutes. Tonight, it was the host and server teams. Does it really take 4 people to work the host stand? While we waited for our table, the hostesses were conversing with each other way to much. More than once we saw customers not being promptly acknowledged. Even when we handed our buzzer we had to wait once we approached the stand. To be fair two were working: one was on the phone and one was fixing the menus. But the other two were talking to one another. Where's the team work? Our server was inattentive and presumptuous. One of us ordered soup. When this happens we are used to being asked if 1) if the soup will be the entree and 2) if the soup would be served on a sourdough loaf; neither happened. Further, when we asked for separate checks, the server incorrectly assumed that we wanted to take advantage of a free pizookie to celebrate ""PI day"" by saying, ""Only one free pizookie per table"". Typically, the response to this request is ""Sure"" or ""Not a problem"". In reality only one of us wanted one. Lastly, the server never asked if we enjoyed our meal nor observed that the soup was barely touched.  The PI day promotion may have put additional strain on the respective teams. However, it's these instances that separate the establishments from getting a 3 or a 4."
Ruben V.,"Riverside, CA",66,4,1,1.0,10/21/2016,The wait estimates are RIDONKULIS!!! Starting with the Manager who does not know how to give you a proper time estimate. How the HELL do you go from a 1 hour wait to an over 2 hour WAIT!!!!!!! And of course I am out of line to complain. Just tell me from the beginning its gonna be a 2 hour wait and I'll go elsewhere.
Diamond M.,"Rialto, CA",98,120,201,2.0,1/11/2016,"Dude. Came at 9pm on a sunday. took 30 mins for our drinks, 30 mins for food. Not packed. 3yr old and 6yr old. Brought ti meet their dad for a quick dinner. ..didnt happen"
Bank C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",89,5,1,1.0,5/4/2017,This place has the most horrible service i ever been too the waitress is rude and when ask to order food the waitress walks away never again will i eat here
Gravity X.,"Rialto, CA",2,47,19,5.0,1/26/2016,"AMAZING!!! The service was amazing , the food was amazing and the environment was amazing! I used the preferred wait list on the app and got right into my booth for a FAMILY OF 6! .... I had a waiter named ""Lex"" he was super nice, and knows how to host guest. Honestly, he's the best waiter I've ever had & he knew exactly how to keep us happy without being ""fake"". We got apps and food suck as chicken club, and kids meals and other grilled chicken and fish dinners. They were all amazing! I would recommend you to come to BJ's. Oh, we even got pazookies at the end... The chocolate chip one and Oreo ones are HEAVEN!!! Don't leave this restaurant without ordering one!!! Honestly, I recommend this place to everyone. Don't hesitate to pick this as a dinner spot. We were actually out for a birthday, they bring a candle with a pazookie! Amazing . Great. YUMMY!"
Kiesha D.,"Fontana, CA",10,9,5,5.0,10/29/2016,"I celebrated my birthday here on the 16th and had more people than expected. The servers and manager accomadated every extra guest I had with no issues at all! The food was amazing and my two waiteress Stacey and Amanda were CRAZY GOOD!!! Super friendly, VERY helpful, and worked SOOOO hard! I was completely impressed and grateful...they made my birthday totally amazing I will always remember what a great night that was! I'll definitely go back...and order the Quinoa & Salmon it was super yummy!!!"
Paul P.,"Fontana, CA",10,154,369,2.0,11/14/2015,Love this place but I think I got cheated on my rewards points. Had 271 points last week spend about $85 dollars this week end now my points are at 296 don't get it.
Elia M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/14/2017,Disgusting! I asked for a clean plate twice! Third time it came back clean.... from the top! Because when i I reached under it to lift up my plate there was a glob of old dried sauce underneath. The waitress tried harder to make me stop talking about it then address it! Calling corporate tomorrow reference receipt: 0414010000680
Blanca L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",4,13,,1.0,8/21/2016,I will be honest the only thing 5 star about this place was the customer service by Arthur. The food wasn't up to my standard at all. The kitchen messed up our order and took a long time to get my meal. I had to pack it to go. While everyone else finished. The ladies at the front were to busy gossiping and not attending to guest. Not very friendly. I really don't think we are coming back.
Ally S.,"Riverside, CA",2,26,8,2.0,11/17/2015,"Kudos to the kitchen, my pizza was awesome.  Lackluster bar, my beer wasn't cold.  The hostess did not greet or smile, simply asked the number of people in the party. When we asked to sit on the patio she sighed and walked around, had to ask the server if it was ok. There was already people on the patio. But I understand being a hostess on a Tuesday afternoon is rocket science.  The waiting staff, brought our food before any eating utensils or napkins. My friend literally ate half his salad with his hands.  The food running staff, brought us side plates, saw something on the plate, wiped it off with her hands and handed me the plate. No thank you, I'll enjoy my food on a clean plate. We also sent out utensils back for being dirty and stained with soap scum. Would I return, definitely but at a different Bj's."
Adam C.,"Pomona, CA",0,27,,3.0,9/20/2016,"Bjs restaurant on a Friday night is jam packed. However when given a wait-time over the phone, the hostess had said 15 min wait for reservations. When I arrived at the location and checked in, the hostess said the wait time had gone up to 30 mins which was displeasing to say the least having made the reservations. When finally seated,I ordered a Guinness beer which took 25 minutes to get and was flat..once I placed my order for their BBQ burger it arrived rather fast but the food was amazing, which is why i am giving them 3 stars."
Joe P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",123,1480,5934,3.0,3/23/2013,"I have been to the two Huntington Beach locations, Glendale and this location (Rancho Cucamonga).  All locations are consistently OK. I met some co-workers here and we started off with the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo:   Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls ($13.95).  For my entree I wasn't in the mood for pizza, so I ordered the Grilled Alaskan Salmon ($13.25).  I didn't take pics, but my co-workers ordered items like lettuce wraps (don't they have those at PF Changs too? :/), pork chops and BBQ ribs.  Isn't this primarily a pizza place?!?!?! :X The appetizers were pretty boring for the price.  They were similar to the frozen stuff you can buy at  the market:  2.5 Stars.  On the other hand, the fish was pretty good.  Although it was a small size portion for the price, the fish was moist and flavorful:  3 Stars. The ambiance is similar to Yardhouse.  There is a bar when you walk in, there are tables by the bar and there are tables away from the bar.  Pretty generic:  3 Stars.  Our waitress Kayla was super nice and efficient.  The orders were correct and the food came out quickly.  She handled our party of 7 with no issues:  4 Stars. BJ's used to be a cool place to grab a drink, a bite to eat and look at cute girls.  Unfortunatley, it has gone the way of Yardhouse and become boring.  In addition, I can't tell the difference between the menu at either.  Both menus are so busy it is impossible for either place to be good at one thing.  Although BJ's does have a pretty good pizza as far as CA and chains are concerned, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to BJ's."
Gil D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",107,18,6,2.0,5/27/2016,"I've always loved Bj's restaurant but lately their services has suck and there food has been whatever. It seems that when it gets busy the servers hide in the back and never check on you. I waited for a at least an hour before we were seated for a party of 5.  Within that hour, they were seating other people that had just showed up. So far my experience at this restaurant has been horrible regardless of the locations."
Alejandra R.,"Fontana, CA",31,46,48,5.0,10/26/2014,I love BJ's. You can order from a variety of deep dish pizzas to numerous handcrafted beers and desserts. The restaurant has a nice ambience and is kid friendly and also great for big parties or groups. You must order the chicken lettuce wraps. They are delicious and full of flavor. We also ordered the deep dish five meat gourmet pizza. Each slice was to die for and filled with toppings. We ended our meal with a classic chocolate chip pizookie.  My family and I received great service here. We will continue to come back.
