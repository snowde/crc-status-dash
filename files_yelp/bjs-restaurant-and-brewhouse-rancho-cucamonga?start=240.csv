Sally M.,"Astoria, OR",108,476,111,5.0,12/3/2014,"Five stars for their fantastic lunch specials! Plenty of options in the $6-$8 range and the portions are very generous...no skimpy lunch portions here! I had the bbq platter with a pulled pork slider, chicken breast, cole slaw, and fries and everything was tasty, especially the ale bbq sauce. I also tried the chicken quesadilla with black beans and it was the little touches that stood out: the yummy fresh salsa and Baja sauce, the two perfectly crisp tortilla in the beans. I love, love the many options they offer on the lunch menu. Any one topping on your pizza. House salad, Caesar salad, wedge salad, tomato mozzarella salad. Potato wedges or thin fries.  Besides good food, they had excellent service and a fun and lively atmosphere with comfy seats. I wish I worked around here so I could keep coming back and go through their entire lunch menu. A $5 off $25 coupon led to a total of $24 (pre-tip) for four people!"
Damian A.,"Fontana, CA",94,13,23,2.0,11/5/2015,"Came here for lunch. Sat ourselves in the bar area. Waited ten minutes, waitress came by to inform us there was a fire and she'd be right back to let us know what was still available to order. Fifteen minutes of waiting with no info later, we decided to leave, lunch break wasted and still hungry. My advice? Don't have a fire"
Robin V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/18/2016,"The food was quite good but the service was bad. Our waitress was really nice but everything else was terrible. I ordered a Pepsi and it looked and tasted like water. When the waitress wanted to refill my drink she said that they ran out of Pepsi. We also ordered a Mojito and some appetizers. The appetizers came before the mojito which was really strange. My girlfriend was still eating her appetizer and they already brought our entrees. Way too quick and we couldn't finish our meal probably because we ate everything too fast. In conclusion: good food, bad service."
G M.,"Riverside, CA",1,95,5,5.0,4/2/2017,"Amber's customer service was above and beyond. She was busy with a lot of other tables, yet managed to make sure our drinks were always full and deserved the tip we gave(; We will back for her  service!"
Pricilla G.,"El Centro, CA",0,3,,3.0,3/17/2017,"Only giving it 3 stars because the server made up for everything. We walked in and were greeted by 2 hostess who were too worried about a piece of paper that the manager had in her hand. Hostess said the wait would be 10-15, keep in mind it's not busy at all. When we were getting walked to get sat, there was literally like 30 open tables. Not sure how their seating is done but maybe a little explanation before being sat would have helped out the situation. Also, the hostess sat someone else who got there after us and then sat us. However on the plus side the food was good and server was great! Super friendly and always made sure we were taken care of."
Chris S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,11,3,2.0,5/15/2016,Waitresses seemed like their phones were more important than. The customers. Service was below average. Our waitress couldn't keep up with the basics of refilling our drinks. When you work in the service industry you should be friendly and hospitable which are two qualities she was lacking during our visit to your restaurant. Food was ok but nothing to brag about. Should have stayed home and just ordered pizza from pizza 101 in Fontana
Paul B.,"Claremont, CA",304,797,3999,4.0,6/26/2014,"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #142 - #365 Decided to take my Mom out to lunch and was thinking Chinese then I decided on BJ's since we hardly eat there. The restaurant caters mostly to business travelers because it's walking distance to the hotels and cater to families since it's right by Ontario Mills.  I love love the selection of craft beers but today I mainly taking my Mom out just for a get together. Our server was Joey and he was full of energy, our drinks came out in 5 minutes and was ready to order. I ordered Brewhouse Burger and that was juicy with tender meat and delicious cheese. My Mom ordered the chicken fingers with french fries and that was just ok....     Since I was treating her, I ordered her a long island ice tea and that hit her good! LOL  We weren't thinking about ordering dessert but our server insist we tell them it's our birthday even though it wasn't so we can get a free pzookie dessert. I thought that was hilarious and he mentioned about signing up for their rewards program where we can earn free food just by dining in.  Service was fantastic and food was superb!"
Adriana S.,"Chino, CA",112,41,12,2.0,7/17/2016,"I'm so torn with rating BJs. The Pizza will never disappoint, it will always be good. When you want a pizza, you can have confidence that you will have a great one if you go to BJs. But thats where it ends. i've had salads, several appetizers, and none of them are good - very mediocre. In my last visit, my husband and I sat outside where there was 1 server for a very large amount of tables. We felt forgotten several times, our main dish came out before our appetizers, and drinks were empty longer than they were full."
J G.,"Fontana, CA",21,26,9,2.0,7/1/2016,"Let me first by saying we a big fans of BJ'S restaurants and brewhouse, we had a bday there and our rehearsal dinner that being said I was so disappointed by my last visit. We went early around brunch time and was pretty empty.We decided to get the pizza which usually is good but something went really wrong. I ordered a create your own with just a few toppings so figured how could you ruin that. Boy was I wrong...it was like a 3 year old made our pizza. Let me rephrase that with a 3 year old could have made a better pizza. It was like they threw a splash of sauce and cheese onto bread and then baked. Then when I went to grab a slice realized they had cut it into square/circle/octagon pizza slices...Let me end this by saying our waiter was great and very friendly. We are not that picky when it comes to pizza but man they really ruined it."
Jackie D.,"Riverside, CA",0,22,2,5.0,12/29/2015,"As crowded as this place was on a Monday night during the holidays, the staff did a great job on customer service and time management. The bartender was very approachable and attentive, which we liked. Had a pizza and salad, but really just came for the pazookie! Which was delicious as usual! Thanks Rancho BJs for being awesome. Also, to the hosts who worked so patiently on my party head count change."
Michael B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,66,,5.0,2/26/2017,The service was excellent.   Did was exceptional.   We will be back!  Parm chicken and Santa Fe chicken salad was great.
Tracey L.,"Ontario, CA",6,2,,5.0,12/27/2015,"It's been a long time since I've been to this BJ's, and my best friend was in town and wanted to go tonight, so we decided to get some food and drinks. We were seated quickly (considering it is a Saturday night, and we knew it was going to be busy).  Our waitress, Jill, came and introduced herself to us. We immediately liked her! Super friendly and very down to earth. After a long day at work, her kindness was refreshing! Promptly took our drink order and brought our drinks. It was a very busy night, and I knew she had a lot of tables, but she handled it like a pro! She was so calm and never once rushed us and made sure we had everything we needed. She even took extra steps in making sure my burger was perfect to her standards before it left that kitchen! I told her that wasn't necessary and her response was, ""I want to make sure you get the best experience so you come back!"" That was such an awesome and kind thing to say! I worked as a manager in the food industry for many years, and I was extremely impressed. (I admit I am very picky when it comes to customer service).  Because of Jill's amazing customer service, I will be returning to this BJ's much more frequently. Thank you, Jill for making our visit so enjoyable!"
Jose B.,"Fontana, CA",79,72,18,5.0,5/30/2016,Place is damn good. Especially the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is the best. Drinks are strong as well. Enjoy
Nini R.,"Banning, CA",0,7,3,5.0,1/22/2016,"During a lunch rush, we were seated almost immediately.  The menu is a pretty eclectic mix of stuff, but that day, I settled on the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with Dinner plate. However, the Lunch Special and the Dinner plate of chicken were both priced at $9.95; I informed our waitress and she let me know that the price of the Dinner was somewhere around $15, but I showed her that the menu had the same price for both items. She quickly informed her manager about the menu misprint and honored the price listed in a quick and courteous manner, much appreciated! The place was clean and staff was attentive enough; didn't hover too much and was on point with refills. I've recommended this restaurant to many friends and I'll definitely be back myself."
Nadine T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2016,"Bj's has always been my favorite restaurant . I've always had my birthday dinners there every year, but personally from all my visits I was never satisfied with the service at all. This one waitress never even checked up on our table and was being extremely rude and ignoring my hand the whole time. The wait for our food was absolutely ridiculous and two tables around us have received their food before my table even though we arrived way earlier and they weren't just small platters they were large pizzas and big portions. I was absolutely frustrated and left her no tip."
Cindy S.,"Fontana, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/12/2016,"Horrible experience!!! Not only did they mess up my take out order but my food was  also cold!! I Called them to speak to a manager spoke to Doug, he left me on hold for over 10 minutes so I hung up, to call back and an incompetent manager by the name of Hazle answered, she was so rude!!! I told her how long it took for my take out order and she was like no , it didn't take that long basically calling me a liar!!!!  I then asked for corporates number since they seem not to care how my experience was !!   I was trying to express my concerns and she kept interrupting me and contradicting me ! I asked her if she was going to listen to what I had to say or just question me , she responded , are I going to want corporates number or what??? RUDE!!!! Don't bother coming here"
Clint W.,"Hesperia, CA",1,8,10,4.0,2/6/2016,As always BJ's produces. Excellent pizza and pazookies! If you're not familiar with BJ's go there and get the sweet pig pizza and a chocolate chip pazookie. This location had friendly service and was well maintained.
Leeanna C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3534,399,4787,3.0,4/19/2014,"I have had really good customer service here, and I have had really bad service too. Totally night and day in that aspect. There is no middle ground in that arena. The food is good. I always get what I am expecting from this chain as far as food quality is concerned. The expedience varies by waiter or waitress. When we get terrible servers, our food comes out super slow. However, when we get the friendly servers, we also get our food quicker. No consistency I guess. To avoid the whole service dilemma we face, my co-workers and I tend to order to go more often now."
Scott T.,"Corona, CA",133,155,31,5.0,7/28/2015,I always enjoy myself here. Their Porter is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who is a porter OR stout fan. The service is always quick and the employees are always very friendly and helpful (at least in the bar area). I'll will surely be back very soon!
Sami W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",225,3,1,1.0,1/13/2016,"I took my sister to bjs for her 23rd birthday and our experience was horrible. The hostess was flirting with the server right in front of us instead of seating us. And then it took us 20 minutes to get our drinks, 40 minutes to get out, and an hour and a half for our entrees. When the runner was delivering our salad she literally tossed it at us and slammed the plate super hard on the table. When my sister and I got our California club sandwhich it was good, but I bit into my sandwhich and had a piece of plastic in it. The service was horrible. My sisters birthday pazookie took forever."
