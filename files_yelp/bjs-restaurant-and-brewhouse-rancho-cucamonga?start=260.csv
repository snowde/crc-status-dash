Natalie R.,"Fontana, CA",75,15,5,5.0,7/24/2015,Colby was an excellent bartender. Super nice and on point. He totally caught on to a perv next to me and kindly saved the day for my friend and I so we could continue having a chill night with great food and drinks. Thanks again Colby.  Ps... the Mac and cheese was the best ever!
De Jay B.,"SYLMAR, CA",145,104,30,5.0,10/15/2015,Love the blackend and Atlantic salmon here. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Amber is an awesome waitress if you run into her .Willham really knows his beers. Believe me there a lot of them here. And he knows every aspect about every one of them. I always love coming to BJ's restaurants all over but this is one of the better ones Highly recommend!
Firas M.,"Fontana, CA",6,7,,1.0,4/26/2015,"I've loved this place for years now..I remember our first time going.  But today was probably one of the worst kinds of service I've ever received.  If you go, make sure your waiter isn't Zac, because you won't see him you'll have to ask the other waiters around to get some help.  The food was also bland..idk if every Sunday is line that but damn it was so bad k had to Yelp it"
Russell B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,33,8,4.0,7/17/2015,It was 10pm and all the pizza places were closed. So I called in pizza to go because they close at midnight. We got barbecue chiken and vegetarian. The pizza here is deep dish and awesome. If you have never had their pizza you are in for a treat. Fricken awesome!
Chris O.,"Montclair, CA",186,8,,5.0,7/11/2016,"David was our waiter and was busting his butt. The bar was very busy and you can tell they were understaffed yet David kept everything running smoothly. He was kind, pacient and very fun to interact with. He refeered me to the bison burger and it was off the chart. The appetizers were good and service was even better. If BJ'S has more servers like David I would come here more often"
Mike K.,"Murrieta, CA",86,96,19,3.0,9/1/2015,"What is there to really say? If you haven't been to BJ's you're not missing much. Pretty good Chicago pan-style pizzas that seem to have lost their pizzaz over the years. Their beer has gone from awful (10 years ago) to decent. It's just your average chain pizza and brewhouse. Even their Pizzookie doesn't excite me anymore. The service at this location has been hit or miss,  usually miss. Slow and unattentive. But not bad enough to complain about it.  A big plus going for them is the huge big screen and multitudes of TVs to watch what you want.  Nothing excites me about this place. There's better pizza nearby and better beer elsewhere."
Dave C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,31,,1.0,7/21/2016,"I've never been to this BJ's before but everyone I've been to previously was good.  This one, however, was not.  I ordered a BJ's special pizza, no onions.  The person with me ordered salmon.  The salmon came and a short while later, the pizza, with onions.  The waitress, to her credit, noticed the onions and took the pizza away, which I didn't think was a bad thing.  I was wrong.   It took close to 25 minutes to get a replacement pizza and, to make matters worse, the thing looked like it was thrown together in anger.  Meatballs on one side, pepperoni on another and green peppers on another side.  Pathetic. That's all well and good but under those conditions, the pizza should have been free or we should have been comp'ed something.  Were we?  Nope........ Won't be going back to that BJ's again."
Dominick M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",211,11,1,4.0,10/8/2015,They might not have the best service but the beer (black and tan) and pizza (buffalo chicken or sweet pig) never dissapoint!
Maryam S.,"San Diego, CA",333,49,72,4.0,8/30/2014,"Awesome food and awesome service! We arrived and were seated relatively quickly, I ordered the green mango chicken salad from the light menu and it was heavenly! It took maybe 20-25 minutes for our food to come out but when it did it was everyone's food all at once and it was heavenly! Ordered pizookie's and that was great too :)"
Joshua P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",46,48,21,4.0,8/5/2015,"Got a flight of the house brews and they were good. Foods alright, no real problems I'm just picky lol. Good for dates, the customer service is great as well. Expect a slight delay when they get busy which is understandable. Can't wait to return."
Barry K.,"Ontario, CA",2,56,,3.0,6/21/2016,"This is a friendly place with a brew pub atmosphere. They have a wide selection of beer- something for everyone. The food is above average and the menu is quite extensive- everything from burgers to pizza. There isn't anything I ""gotta have"" but I can always find something that suits my mood. It's a good place for a casual evening."
Sandra G.,"Montclair, CA",55,39,,2.0,10/21/2016,"We went on a Thursday night @7 pm to celebrate my bday. it was pretty busy for a weekday but nothing crazy busy for how long we waited. We put our name on the waiting list and were called within 15 minutes. It took awhile to get our drinks(20-30 mins) our waitress literally walked by our table 2xs with our drinks. Why I rate it 2! It took 1 hour 10 mins to get our food seated at 720!! We had our 3 kids with us who were at this point starving,boyfriend talked to manager who was very apologetic and somehow all of the sudden brought our food out in like 5 minutes. My sandwich was warm and then cold in some areas the dip had no flavor  it was obvious our order had been sitting there longer than it should have, should I have sent it back YES along with wings BUT when you're eating dinner @9pm on a school night with kids, another 1 hour of waiting was not an option...The wings my MIL ordered were SALTY, Food was average I was expecting more flavor but even our appetizer was lacking flavor seriously sonics wings taste better, the beef dip so not worth it! On the plus side their Tvs are big so we enjoyed the dodger game . Maybe if the food had been out in time it would've tasted better but definitely not worth the price that night,worst bday dinner ever! Yes, they tried making up for it by being super nice but when you go into a restaurant and pay what we payed you expect better service and tastier food."
Priscilla S.,"Montclair, CA",0,6,,3.0,3/13/2016,I'm giving this place a 3 because the food and drinks are yummy. However the service is bad. And I'm not sure if that's because we came on a busy  day. My boyfriend's food came like 20 minutes earlier than mine and our friends and I felt horrible because he waited for us to get ours and his food got pretty cold. I'm willing to give it a shot again but if I get the same experience I probably won't ever come again.
Erin M.,"Carrollton, TX",0,3,12,4.0,7/9/2016,"Salmon quinoa was super yummy. They're pretty short on the asparagus but still good. My niece and I split it and we're both so full. *Dont fall for the ""free pizookie"" when you download the app. It charged us. BUT they did apologize and gave us a coupon for a free pizookie next time. Happy tummy!"
Jack G.,"Ontario, CA",32,14,13,4.0,9/15/2015,Great food but way better beer on tap. Service was great and always on point for any refills or anything else. If you stop by I recommend the house Hef.
Shannon P.,"Fort Mohave, AZ",9,73,40,5.0,8/16/2015,The food was excellent. Had the Sriracha Brussell Sprouts for an appetizer. Never had anything so yummy in all my life. Had the southern fried chicken with pepper gravy and white cheddar mashed potatoes and corn succotash. The service was mediocre for a Saturday night and it was extremely loud with tv's going and music playing overhead. That was overkill. Had to ask for a refill on my iced tea and then it took forever for him to come back. But the food was so good I will def go back.
Melissa G.,"Ontario, CA",14,58,5,5.0,2/15/2016,The service here is always fast and friendly. The waitresses here aren't snobby and they go out of their way to make sure you have a fine dining experience.
Will B.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,28,27,3.0,6/28/2014,"Beer list is so so, would have gave 4 stars but the lack of knowledge by the wait staff and bartender was ridiculous. Asked a waiter for a Goose Island IPA, had no idea what it was, had to explain. Then she had to ask the bartender, who also had no clue, wasn't until they asked the manger, who actually knew. What bartender doesn't know Goose Island...  This place is OK, not the best. Their dishes are so so, their thin fries are decent, but Yardhouse has better quality. The Salted Caramel Pizookie, was probably the best thing I had here."
John T.,"Long Beach, CA",9,60,9,5.0,4/25/2016,We love coming here & getting drinks every couple of weeks. Ordered Bj favorite pizza with wings and peach beer margarita. Yum!!!
Monique S.,"Ontario, CA",6,4,,1.0,7/1/2016,"This was the most horrible experience. This was my very first visit and I was excited because everyone I know said it was awesome. It took over 35 minutes to be seated after we're told it would take only be 20 minutes. Then our server took forever to get our drinks to us. It took an additional 30 minutes to get our appetizer without extra plates given to us. It took an additional 40 minutes to final get fed up and ask for the manager. In total we were there for over 2 hrs for just sodas, water and a shared appetizer. I will NEVER go back. Horrible, horrible"
