Megan C.,"San Antonio, TX",151,200,378,4.0,5/27/2015,I ate here for the first time tonight and had the Ahi tuna salad and a pomegranate margarita. Both were great. The restaurant was busy but service was friendly and fast. The music wasn't too loud for my taste. I'd come back.
Taryn A.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,2,6,1.0,10/26/2015,"****if I could give 0 stars, I would!******  I am currently here for my birthday with a table of 22 guests.. Service was terribly slow, we came at 8pm and it is currently 11:53pm and I'm still waiting for a birthday Pasooki, which I had to personally ask for. Still nothing. Cannot believe how forgetful this staff was- I ordered a pizza and fries and got the fries almost an hour after my pizza arrived. Extremely horrible experience and not worth the money my guests and I paid. Terrible customer service. (Ontario, California. 4th street)"
Tim R.,"Prosper, TX",18,9,2,3.0,4/15/2015,"Great atmosphere but the dude at the host stand sucks. 15 minute wait for 1 person and 10-12 tables empty. The manager had to finally seat me after the host seated 3 families ahead of me that came in after me.  Food is good, patio is really cool. But they need to fire the ding dong at the host stand."
Cynthia K.,"Ontario, CA",0,14,7,5.0,5/14/2016,"My boyfriend and I went for a dinner date. We were seated very quickly,  which was great! I had the Great White pizza and I thought it was so yummy!! Very flavorful! I definitely want to go back for more! My bf had the chicken Alfredo and that was very delicious too! The waitress was very attentive and very friendly.  Great atmosphere!"
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,4.0,8/9/2012,"Have eaten here at least 20 times in the last 3 years. I'm not local, but work in the area 2-3 times per month. The restaurant is no different than any other BJ's. Good selection Quiet in the day, busy after 5 pm Clean Great atmosphere My review is mainly for the delivery. I stay at one of the hotels from time to time and usually get me food delivered to my room. Delivery service is great, speedy, food fresh, and delivery person has always been pleasant.  Delivery charge is minimal. Food ends up being a lot cheaper than room service. Will be ordering again soon"
Devin F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",19,78,25,1.0,3/29/2016,"Ahhhh BJ's.... a double disappointment.  First Visit: My Wife wasn't feeling well so I wanted to take her out. We had a gift card and were in the area. I had never been, but I thought, ""why not?"" we were seated relatively quickly since just the two of us fit at a small booth meant for two. We ordered appetizers and 2 plates. We both had drinks. An hour later, no food. My wife wasn't feeling well to begin with so I had clearly chosen wrong and now she was disappointing. NEVER having walked out of a place, I asked if she wanted to leave and she IMMEDIATELY said yes. ONLY AS A COURTESY I told the hostess that I was walking out after an hour of receiving NO attention (refills) and certainly NO food. The hostess asked if she could get a manager to talk to me and (my wife already sitting outside), I tried to be brief with the manager and told her I came only because I had a gift card and that after an hour I was leaving. She offered to comp the meal and I explained I wasn't asking for anything free I just wanted to not come back. She told me she'd comp the order and box it up (it had just walked through the door, appetizers WITH entrees). After the boxing, ANOTHER manager came out and explained that the first woman I talked to was just an ASSISTANT manager. She said that my appetizers DID take too long but the Entrees were on schedule based on the time the CHECK was put in. I told her I checked in on facebook after being seated and she was welcome to see my check in time. My presumption is that our server was too busy and forgot to put in our check so it APPEARED the time was less than our actual. The NEW manager offered to comp the appetizers and take HALF off the bill. I told her I never asked for the food free in the first place and I just wanted to leave. Now she was trying to convince me to pay for it. I told her it was fine, she could have my gift card and call it even since I have NO intention of returning. At this point she comped the check and gave me the food (I still had no interest in this).  I felt that in SOME way the manager tried to get me to return to give them another chance which, unfortunately, i was stupid enough to do.  Second visit, same 2 person party: Upon arrival, the Hostess had her elbow on the desk and her hand holding her head up. NEVER making eye contact, she asked how many, and for a name. I have NEVER met a more rude hostess. shortly after, we were taken to be seated at a similar two person booth in a different location. We had to stand around for a few minutes as a server was squatting talking options with some patrons effectively blocked our (and the hostesses) ability to let us sit. When the server moved, the hostess apologized from bringing us to a DIRTY TABLE. instead of finding a clean one, we were asked to sit and told someone would be by shortly to wipe it down (keep in mind there were several 2 person booths available). After PLACING the order for two lunch plates, we waited more than thirty five minutes (which I have to assume is normal here) for food to arrive. Also, shortly AFTER food arrived, someone walked around passing out silverware and napkins realizing that they were never replaced to us and MANY other tables that were cleaned and seated already. The server recommended something new on the menu and I ordered what turned out to be the adult version of a Hot Pocket. My wife ordered a pizza. The paper stuck to the bottom of HALF the pizza that my wife bit into was complementary. The service was terrible. The check came out to less than the amount of my gift card so whatever the difference was, went to the server. BJ's is awful. I would never recommend this place to anyone. For our lunch, we'd have saved time and money for BETTER food if I ordered the chicken back and my wife the pizza at Costco. What a joke."
Nicole D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",96,3,2,5.0,6/17/2016,David M. Is the greatest! He made our graduation night wonderful! Thank you for the wonderful service!!
Teresa G.,"Corona, CA",94,9,6,5.0,5/7/2016,"Came in tonight to celebrate a early Mother's Day dinner. We called ahead. Waited about 40 minutes. Our server, Jill came and introduced herself to us. She started us off with a strawberry margarita, a beer sampler, and 2 kids root beers. We also ordered a combo app. It was really good! My husband orders the Santa Fe Salad for his entree. I ordered the chicken Alfredo. And the kids shared a spaghetti. Everything came out great. Jill was amazing. Very Friendly and great service on top of that. Best server I have ever had! Great Job Jill! Hope to be served by you again!!"
Jennifer G.,"Lacey, WA",45,2,2,1.0,10/1/2015,"The food was awesome! But the service was so bad the manager bought our lunch. And we were the first guests in the building when they opened. Will not be coming back. When I talked to the manager all I got was ""I'll buy your lunch, you can just leave."" No apologies, nothing. Like they were just trying to get us out of there. Things that make you go hmmm?"
Danielle O.,"Rialto, CA",43,41,24,4.0,7/26/2015,"The New Orleans Jambalaya is really good I rarely ever finish it by myself. I enjoy the variety of non alcoholic drinks. Today I tried a ""mocktail"" orange drink. I can't remember the exact name but it was good! My husband kept stealing sips. I love their personal deep dish pizzas. One of my favorites here. The service is alway great when we come. The price for two is a little high. On average we spend about $45-55 if we get a dessert or appetizers."
Brandy E.,"Ontario, CA",35,70,28,2.0,3/7/2015,"Came to eat here last weekend in a Saturday night. We were a party of 9 and the wait was about an hour. The wait was no trouble, however the place was packed and all available space at the bar and waiting area including the benches outside were full.  Though it was very cold there were about 2 tables sitting out side. They had the fire pit going and heat lamps on. I asked the hostess if we may sit and have appetizers and cocktails out by the fire pit because we were standing outside in the cold anyway. I figured we may as well try to enjoy it. She told me no that we could not do that and we can have dinner outside but having drinks and appetizers only was not allowed. That was bummer #1  When we are seated we sat for about 7 minutes before we were greeted. When the server finally came she was short and rude. She asked if we wanted to order drinks without any suggests or general warmth. We ordered she checked ID and left. While she was standing there I inquired if they carried St. Germain; I assume she did not hear me because she did not reply. Also we ordered appetizers while she was there. 1 couple ordered wings to share, then another, when my fiancé and I ordered ours I asked for them to not have ranch drizzled on top. She asked if the buffalo was okay, I said yes. I also asked for them to be very well don't ""burn them"" as I ALWAYS say when I order wings anywhere. She then turned and looked at the other people who ordered wings already and asked if they wanted to change their order to be special. That started a banter of confusion and I'm sure if they wanted modification they would have requested them.  Our server then said she was going on break and that someone else would take over. Thankfully the new server was much more pleasant than the last.  When the wings came they where completely dry. No buffalo sauce even drizzled. And they were not even remotely well done. The skin was very pliable and squishy, not crispy as I had anticipated from a well don't wing. So that was a disappointment. Food runners dropped the food and he server was busy and I didn't want to wait for another batch. I also orders a house salad that came in a LITERAL pool of balsamic vinaigrette. I actually turned the bowl and strained it into my side plate because I was unbearable. Again it was busy and at this point I was not expecting for the new salad to be any better.  My fiancés burger was squished and the bacon on it wasn't fully cooked. In general the food was terrible. I have eaten ate BJ's many times and in different states and his was by far the worst experience I have ever had. Our first server was completely rude and ruined my mood. But the second was nice and she was the one who earned the 2 stars I gave. Otherwise there would be none.  I was a server for many years and I'm sorry the food/service was unacceptable. Even when guest don't speak up, you can interpret the mood of a table. And you are supposed to anticipate the guest needs. It felt more like we were overlooked. Perhaps it was because it was too busy, then the management needs to be on their toes pitching in. Particularly when someone orders food with modifications, you should always check to make sure they have been fulfilled as requested. Not leave a food runner to drop then food and dash."
J H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/26/2017,I ordered a take out one day and when I went to pick up my order I waited 30 minutes for my food as if I never called more so they didn't cook the meal until I got there with no apologies. Came home opened my food box the salad was all lettuce and no dressing!!!!! Called the manager and spoke with Jennifer she said she would mail me a gift card for my bad experience. Waited over 2 weeks and nothing came in the mail. Call once AGAIN had me on hold for 10 minutes to speak to Eric who has a VERY nasty attitude/tone over the phone and said he can't do nothing for me unless I have the original receipt I told him I have the bank statement showing and that I spoke with a manger he then argued with me and said nothing he can do and ends up hanging up on me. I will never go to this place again nor will I ever recommend this place. HORRIBLE customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Angus N.,"Rowland Heights, CA",401,20,695,2.0,12/24/2016,"My experiences with BJ has never been great all these times. Tonight at Christmas Eve we visited another BJ just because we received a $50 e-gift card. When it was time to check out, the server told us their system to verify gift cards is down, so they cannot verify the validity of it and therefore they're asking for another form of payment. I spoke to the manager on duty and his lame trained response was not helping either. I felt that if the manager on duty is aware of the issue, they should post a notice letting customers know at the entrance, or have server tell customers before ordering that the issue, so to avoid any embarrassing moments. Let's say what if all they brought is a gift card and no other form of payment? Are they going to contact the police? It's really not the customers' fault that they're not paying when they were not told of the issue. We just felt like this place is just a scam. The servers attitude was not very good either. I understand you have to work Christmas Eve and the restaurant was only half occupied at 8pm on Saturday evening. But don't take this on your customers because words do spread around and it will come back and bite you. Last advice, next time you visit BJ make sure they accept gift cards before going in."
Marcus G.,"Hesperia, CA",13,3,,5.0,5/19/2016,"Ask for the host Jess; she will take care of you.  Our waitress, ""Kevin"" was the bomb!"
Stephanie F.,"Upland, CA",10,7,,3.0,10/14/2016,Originally I intended to give this location one star due to the fact that we started off with an appetizer  which was Brussels sprouts. They came back really burnt. That was very unpleasant so we returned it and just orders a side salad with our burger. Unfortunately we waited an hour for our salad and then when the burger came out 20 minutes later it ended up being cold. Keep in mind that we where seated at 8:10 and a normal 45 minute dinner ended up turning into almost 2 hours. Which I personally think is a ridiculous amount of time. Overall I originally just wanted to give the girls at the front a heads up. But instead Evelyn took it upon herself to get the manager because she didn't want us leaving with that unpleasant feeling. Eric the manager came out and we explained the whole service food service to him and how we are regulars and we went ahead and assured us that the quality of food we received was not okay and gave us a $20 gift card and a coupon for a free dessert. Overall the service was not all that great but the fact that they took it upon themselves to make it better when we didn't ask for anything in return showed that they do value the input of their customers. We will return and try again since we we normally enjoy the food and service at BJ's in Rancho
James H.,"Claremont, CA",165,66,49,5.0,2/17/2016,"So Danielle was an awesome waitress! From start too finish she she was extremely attentive! She came too our table the minute we sat down, shes such a good waitress! She really deserves a raise or something cause really she is awesome! She was the best waitress i have ever had by far! Super nice to the whole group! Conversed with everyone at the table! This was my first time going to a BJ's, now it won't be my last cause of Danielle! Thank you so much Danielle for everything ;) i hope you read this! And i hope you enjoy the tip ;)"
Adam G.,"Claremont, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/4/2016,I love eating at BJ's. But I always eat @ BJ's in Brea. This is my second time that I try this restaurant in Ontario very disappointed. The first time that I came with some of my friends the calamari where burn and dry or should I said over cook. The next time I order a flat pizza came out cold.  Either they need to change managers or chef but somebody is not taking pride on what they are doing. Somebody should do their job and walk their store to make sure that their managers are walking the restaurant make sure their customer are being serve and the waiters are doing their job and train the employees that this is a franchise. Such a great restaurant but poor service. I hate doing this but if you want to enjoy a great food and great service go to BJ's in Brea. And you would understand what I'm talking about. Enjoy..
Sophia L.,"Chino, CA",223,259,124,5.0,2/12/2014,One of my favorite chain restaurants. Good quality food and a huge menu to choose from. This place is definitely a crowd please because there is something there for everyone. I personally love their deep dish/flat bread pizzas and their salads. The best part about this place is getting a pazookie to share with your friends or lover.  Get on their email list because they often have beer tasting and meal deals that come around every few months.
Maria C.,"Redlands, CA",1,12,,1.0,4/21/2016,"Went last night with my family and wait time was about 10min.Meal and appetizer was good . Husband order beer twice and he stated  second beer tasted different , so he did not finish it. Went home and within a hour he started feeling sick . Blotting ,cramps, vomiting, diarrhea. I'm sure it wasn't the food cuz we both ate the same entree and appetizer"
Bubbles R.,"Rialto, CA",1,11,,3.0,4/21/2016,"This place is OK. I used to come here more often with my mom, and it used to be good.  However, the last I came here was with my boyfriend. And the food wasn't as good as I remember it used to be. They probably have a new cook or something.  Although the food is not the greatest I Still look forward to having their avacodo rolls. They are my favorite!  When my boyfriend and I came we bothed tried their raviole pasta.  Mine was a Lil different than his. It had diffrent spices and things in it.   I didn't like it AT ALL!!!  His on the other hand was good!  After dinner I usually look forward to having thier dessert! My favorite is thier poozokies!!   As far as food I don't think I will be returning here anytime soon.  Maybe for an occasional poozokie or thier avacodo rolls but that's it!  The service here is OK.    It is kind of dissapointing that the food doesn't taste as good as it used to!"
