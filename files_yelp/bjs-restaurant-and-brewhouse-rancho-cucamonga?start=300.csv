BreathingBody B.,"Norco, CA",6,123,92,3.0,2/21/2016,"The food was just meh, luckily we used the bogo coupon otherwise I would have complained. Anyway we ordered the Ahi Poke, it was bland I think it was missing sauce. I got a mozzarella and tomato salad and it was ok, the cheese had no flavor. Then my entree was the fettuccini and chicken pasta it was very good, I'd probably return just to give them a second chance and I'll update my review for BJ's. The server was a little on the strange side when I gave my order she just stared at me blankly and looked as if she did not want to be there, messed up the bill and was apologetic."
Jacob H.,"Glendora, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/23/2016,If I could give 0 I would. I am here with a party of 5. We checked in at around 10:00 pm with a 30 minute wait. At 10:40 we checked in with the host and she told us we had already been seated. This was not the case so they told us they would seat us. 5 minutes later they call us. We are walked past a booth ment for 6 or 7 and sat at a table for 4 with a fifth chair added to the end. I asked for the booth but was told it was already taken. It's 11:27 and no one is sitting there. We just got our dinner... Still waiting on our appetizer. This place has horrible service. I will be asking to speak to the manager before I pay.
Raymond M.,"Chino, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/26/2016,"Ate here last week with my girlfriend, it was going just fine until our waitress clocked out so she switched with someone else. Whoever she switched with Must've just forgotten about us cause we didn't see our waitress for over an hour. We kept trying to wave and get her attention but she would seriously walk right past us. When we finally got her attention and asked for the check it took another 25 minutes to get the check. That's just outrageous. I could honestly understand if it was busy, but it wasn't busy at all. We won't be coming back."
Cilla P.,"Fontana, CA",150,186,192,4.0,4/29/2015,"too expensive for cheap food lol the only thing i enjoyed was my salad.. I ordered the chicken fettuccine.. and the chicken had fake grill marks on it, it looks like they use precooked, sliced chicken from sams club in the deli section LMAO seriously dont serve me this crap. I want fresh food not precooked I don't even serve precooked meat at home! I updated my review to 4 stars cause I went back on tried their Asian chicken salad and that is the best salad ive ever had! im hooked"
Amy T.,"Flagstaff, AZ",110,21,1,5.0,3/31/2016,"Colby was awesome! Great bartender, great service, very trustworthy on the menu. Had the blackened salmon and was like heaven in your mouth. Thank you Colby for making this lone traveler not feel so alone for dinner!"
Jesse G.,"Corona, CA",0,41,3,1.0,5/24/2016,SERVICE SUCKS! At least the lunch time rush. It's like they are caught off guard by the lunch crowd every day. I work with a large sales team and we all agree that service is horrible and we will not return and haven't for about a year now. Reason why I'm posting now is because someone brought up a lunch meeting at BJ'S rancho today.
Melissa M.,"Whittier, CA",72,8,2,1.0,4/3/2016,"Horrible horrible horrible there is nothing good about this restaurant, first impression was horrible the hostess was extremely rude told us the wait 30 minutes  the restaurant was completely empty and then when we asked again she said I told you 2 minutes. Rude. We sat outside, out waitress looked like she didn't want to be there. Food looked like mush. Orders were wrong. Horrible experience I will NEVER go back to this location. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
Jenny A.,"Covina, CA",13,17,2,2.0,3/4/2016,"Ordered large pizzokies for delivery to my work. The chocolate chip pizzokie was burned beyond recognition. It looked dark brown, we thought it was the triple chocolate cookie. It was so hard, and tasted like charcoal. Very disappointed!"
Chris C.,"Bloomington, CA",3,45,49,4.0,1/24/2016,"The only reason I wouldn't rate this 5 stars bc the girls they have taking names and answering the phones are not helpful. If you call ahead and put your name down they don't tell you how long the wait actually is. We arrived and they said it would be an additional 30 minutes. Not to mention the girl had attitude when i said i wanted to make ""reservations"". ""Oh we don't take reservations"" LOOK you know why I'm calling and whatever it is you call it down at the land of BJs put my name down on your little note pad or forehead for all I care. DONT BE RUDE. Enough about her (OLIVIA). Our waiter Austin was super nice and attentive. Food was awesome."
Nancy T.,"Santa Ana, CA",331,132,42,5.0,2/17/2015,"My friends and I stopped by over the weekend, we had such a great time. Even though it was Valentine's Day weekend, we managed to get seats at the bar quickly courtesy of Ryan. Ryan provided us with superior customer service and always on point with drinks. One of the best bartender I ever encounter. We will for sure return!!!"
Judi G.,"Pen Argyl, PA",0,19,,4.0,5/7/2016,"Good service. Loud but upbeat atmosphere. Delicious grilled ham and cheese. Chowder was Luke warm, tasted canned. Pizookies were very sweet. We shared a trio but one between us would have been enough. Clean. Usually packed which it was today but we found a parking space and we were seated right away. We were a party of two."
Beth A.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,18,48,5.0,3/23/2015,"We came to celebrate 2 birthdays, and have lunch before heading to an event a few minutes away.  We got the Patio area which was nice because it was shady and there was a small breeze that made the hot weather feel good.  Our server was Amanda Gomez and she was awesome! We could see that she had a good amount of tables but she was very attentive to us and the other tables around us.When she came to help us out we ordered our drinks which were all waters and we gave her a heads up that we were going to drink them like fishes because we were drinking the night before and were dehydrated we told her we went to an event not that far from the restaurant and she was super cool about it!! we ordered appetizers (chicken wings and calamari!) and food all at once and our appetizers came out first! The wings and calamari were nice and hot! When we asked for extra lemons she brought them out right away! Along with what her other tables had asked for as well! Good job multitasking Amanda!! When we got our food she came and asked if we were ok if there was anything she could get for us and of course we asked for a bunch of sauces lol which she was totally ok with! She brought everything out and we talked about a few things here n there which we thought was great!  P.S the tavern cut pizzas are a must try they are super good!! The food is so delicious! Oh and the jalapeño burger is BOMB!  Anyway so Amanda kept her word and took care of us we lost count on how many times she topped our waters off without us having to ask her which was great!!  And when we were almost done she offered dessert and we told her we were celebrating 2 birthdays and she asked whose birthdays they were we told her and she wished both the girls a happy Birthday and said she would be right back!!  She put it 2 birthday pizookies for us which was super cool!!  Thank you Amanda for your awesome service And for keeping us hydrated and even giving us to go waters!! oh and for letting us move when the sun moved and was hitting one of us in the face!! We will definitely be coming back to sit in your section!!"
Nina M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",32,72,152,5.0,3/2/2015,They have a wide variety of Entrees to choose from. They have a appetizer section called Small Bites. They are small portions so that you can order 2 or 3 different ones and not break the bank. They have the best Tortilla Soup and Ahi Tuna Salad here
Lawernce V.,"Sparks, NV",83,5,,4.0,11/3/2016,Great service good buffalo pizza..my husband loved their BBQ ribs. The staff was also great
Nick M.,"Los Alamitos, CA",31,23,1,1.0,2/13/2016,"For starters, I took my fiance out to dinner before the valentine's rush.  She ordered a pizza. They forgot to put tomato sauce!!! A lovely night after that turned into such a fiasco. After her pizza came out were nearly rushed of the patio by the wattress around 9pm. Okay, they could have moved us inside. We ordered a pazookie next, the dam thing was as stiff as a hockey puck. We told the waitress and she brushed us off until finally speaking to the manager. The manager wasn't the greatest and didn't let us speak. We will never come back to this site. I'm in retail and in management and I could say this place needs some help and new cooks !"
Angie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,21,7,5.0,11/22/2014,"BJ's is a great place for food and good company. After a long day my boyfriend and I love to come here for dinner. It gets pretty packed so be sure to call ahead to get added to the reservation/waiting list.  We commonly order the Avocado Egg Rolls, Deep Dish Pizzas, Burgers and Moroccan Salmon. Can't go wrong with these items. We're always satisfied with our dinner. As for the beers, I absolutely love them! I used to dislike beer but my boyfriend got me into their Berry Cidar & Oasis Amber (recommended choice for the ladies!) but I have come to love the Jeremiah Red! As for the service, its a hit or miss with them. But shout out to Colby behind the bar, he is on point! As customers we're always going to have trivial questions about things on the menu and I appreciate how patient & knowledgable Colby was in helping us tonight. Thanks Colby!"
Damien K.,"Ontario, CA",17,9,1,3.0,10/10/2016,Slow as molasses.... It's not even busy and 10 min for a beer and 20 min in they don't even ask me my food order yet. And I love this place!
Jade W.,"Las Vegas, NV",677,1185,1232,3.0,10/5/2014,"I've eaten at BJ's all over and while we have them in Vegas, for whatever reason my friend wanted a Pizookie badly and it actually sounded really good to me.  We had just a few appetizers to make ourselves a meal.  Chicken Lettuce wraps - it's a standard type dish that seems to be everywhere, but I like the way they season it here.  Calamari was just OK though. There was just something lacking in the flavor of the batter.  Pizookie Trio - you can pick 3 kinds and it's about half the size of a single large pizookie. I liked the salted caramel one quite a bit. The triple chocolate was too rich and sweet for me. Macadamia nut is a safe and good bet always.  Service was pretty good. She was very sweet and attentive to our drinks.  I don't know if it's posted anywhere, but there is happy hour at the bar area seating only which is some discounts on drinks, appetizers and half off mini pizzas. Worth doing if you're just trying to nosh on a few things like we were. It was a decent meal, but nothing that was too standout."
Donna F.,"Ontario, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2016,"If you have all the time in the world , BJ's it is. it's only  about an hour to take your order and another hour for your food to arrive. Food is ok but not worth the wait."
Christine L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",379,205,249,3.0,1/22/2015,"If you like thick dough pizza, then this is the spot. I think the pizza is only good here. Everything else is decent, but not worth the price."
