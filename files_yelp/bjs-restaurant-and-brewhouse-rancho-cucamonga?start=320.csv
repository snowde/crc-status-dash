Mohammed B.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,17,,4.0,4/22/2015,"I had dinner n wine with my friends on a Tuesday nt...we ordered a cabernet sauvignon bottle,it was great,tasty n flavor rich as usual...I ordered a medium done house top sirloin and it was good n tender..we wanted to sit outdoors but it was busy so we stayed indoors as there were a lot of vacant spots, liked the high stool chairs with the high tables and lights over them...the waitress was very   friends had avocado egg rolls and pizza,I didn't like the rolls as I am not an avocado fan.the bar was very nice with the big screens all over.this place is like a lot of american bars and restaurants,nothing unusual about it.Their menu had many options thu.I'd recommend this place to friends who plan to hang out in the ontario mills area."
G T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/22/2016,Third time's the charm. Not really. 40 minutes to receive our sandwiches which were not prepared correctly. Burger ordered medium came to us well done. Grilled cheese sandwich came to us and the cheese was cold. One plate fries cooked and hot the other not so. Similar experiences the last two times and we are crossing BJ's off the list. Too bad. The manager did come by and took care of the check. Too late for us though. Better experiences at the Lazy Dog for sure.
Tiffany L.,"Ontario, CA",0,3,2,4.0,6/7/2015,"Great food that comes in a HUGE portion! Although, customer service was running a bit slow but BJ's is always packed especially when I went with some family after a church event. It could always be better in the future, but overall love this place!!!"
Edlin M.,"Pomona, CA",84,17,6,1.0,10/29/2015,"For being a corporate restaurant with really high standards for their employees with the gold star standards the service we got from kara r. Tonight was far from acceptable.  I ordered the spaghetti half marinara and half spicy like I have been ordering for years. My friend ordered a salad to start and a flat bread. After the Flatbread comes out. Kara comes to tell me they no longer carry the spicy sauce but have a sauce with peer flakes. Ok I'll take it.  I assume at that point the kitchen will now start making my food. 15 min after ordering... Soon comes the wedge salad after the flatbread...later my pasta.  Awesome sequence of service isn't yoir strength..meanwhile my glass has been empty for far too long.  Did you quality check our table? Nope  The table next to us either. They've been there a while.  Order a pizza togo. You rang in 2. When we asked about it you stood wondering how that could have happened...not our yoir guest problem. Just fix it.  It took another 20 min, not exaggerating. To get a manager to fix it.  Lack of good service from start to finish.  It's thursday. I can't imagine the kind of service you give on a friday with a full station."
Joshua B.,"Ontario, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/17/2015,"Went to this location tonight, hands down the worst service I have ever encountered. The wait was two hours long (which I understand can happen during busy times) but they had told us the wait would only be 40 minutes and not once did the apologize. Once we got to the table, nothing was there (table settings, menus, nothing). Then our waiter didn't show up for ten minutes and we only saw him a couple times during the night. Also, we were eating outside and the area we ate at was infested with caterpillars and while nature can sometimes interfere, a restaurant allowing this to happen is unacceptable. And then when food was brought out, they forgot to bring settings so we had to wait on that, as well as plates. Much more happened but I think you get the point. Great food, but horrendous service at this location."
Tiana B.,"West Covina, CA",93,2,,5.0,4/13/2016,"Steven P was an amazing server. He was outstanding. The food was amazing and of course the pazooki was delicious but what really made the night was his fantastic customer service. He gave suggestions, had friendly conversations, and was on top of our table making sure everything was great. Definitely will be back:)"
Crystal E.,"San Bernardino, CA",153,6,,4.0,4/12/2016,"I love this place! I typically get the crusted chicken with the lemon sauce and mash potatoes. But the other day I got the,jambalaya and it was delicious! Great customer service! Nice vibe and amazing location!"
Angie E.,"Ontario, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/16/2015,"Excellent food everytime!!!! The ribs are amazing and the salad is always fresh and delicious. More importantly the Customer Service is second to none. The Manager Ryan A. is polite, professional and very attentive to the customers. It's rare that a manager takes the time to make sure customers are happy, but Ryan A. takes that extra time.  My company also hosted an event and had a BJ's Rancho Cucamonga cater and it was a HUGE SUCCESS. Ryan A. and Camrielle were our contacts and they insured everything went smoothly. Danielle delivered out order and every thing was hot, fresh and packaged beautifully. Even plates, utensils, serving utensils, napkins etc. EXCELLENT!!!!"
Robert L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",9,22,13,3.0,5/29/2015,Arrived at 4:45 pm on a Friday and got seated right away. Hostess sat us in a booth that didn't have a wait staff assigned to it so waited around 15 minutes as assorted waiter and waitress past walked by. Had to flag down a waiter and ask to order. Pizza was good and they made up for the beginning. Good place to go for dinner.
Mina F.,"Riverside, CA",0,31,1,5.0,1/30/2016,"BJ's is always a spur of the moment dinner night , but I always rant and rave about the mojitos and  My boyfriend loves their pizza. Tonight, our server was MiChael younger kid but he was very helpful. I ordered the southern fried chicken  It was something out of my zone to ordered but it sound tasty so I figured why not? Anywho as I'm placing the order I was sketchy about getting it because it was more food then I was hungry for it came with 2 chicken breasts but since It sound so tasty I couldn't resist  As I'm placing my order Michael  suggested if I want the lunch portion instead of the dinner portion  It's like he read my mind lol  Just for him suggesting something that I didn't even know you can do is so helpful versus  me taking home leftovers and not eating them! I ate all my food and it was so delicious  I love going to restaurants where they actually take the time and suggested other options you can consider."
Jorge C.,"Rialto, CA",0,1,20,5.0,4/7/2016,Best fried chicken. Very clean was able to get seated fairly quickly on a Friday night.
Meredith C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,10,3,5.0,3/15/2016,"First I would like to give a huge thank you to manager Hazel! My husband and I come here often because we love the food, atmosphere, prices, and ""most"" of the staff. However, we had our first unpleasant experience about three weeks ago when a server charged our card twice. One was for someone else's tab  (I'm assuming it was a harmless mistake, although our bank said it appeared to be fraud due to the fact that our card was Visa and they charged it under Mastercard. I don't know the reasoning behind the accusation.) Anyways, after dealing with several staff and managers for three weeks to get our $49 reimbursement, I was over it and called to get the number to corporate to see if I could resolve my issue. That is when I first spoke with Hazel who asked if she could help me. I feel bad now looking back because I was irritated by past conversations with the staff and I assumed I'd have a similar experience with her. I was very wrong! Hazel was unbelievably polite and understanding and offered to refund us immediately! I did not have to contact corporate. I gave her my information and the money was refunded to my account within 24 hours. She apologized for the inconvenience and appeared very sympathetic to my situation. I wish I could do more to give a sincere and very appreciative review to Hazel, unfortunately I don't know how to do so. I hope somehow this helps, because she deserves credit and acknowledgement for her outstanding customer service and follow through... thank you Hazel!! -Meredith & Brian Chambers"
Vanessa C.,"Orlando, FL",955,147,632,5.0,8/28/2015,"Convenient location, we just came here after our painting adventure to continue with our girls night out, interesting in this twin you can bring your own bottle to the restaurant and you pay a fee I believe it is $10 and you can enjoy your own. So we just finished the bottle we started at the painting activity and enjoyed some avocado rolls and the beignets with strawberries and ice cream and it was delicious. The perfect dessert to finish our evening. Our server was super friendly and on top of every detail. Which I appreciated, since it was pretty busy and still the service was great. Did like that they have the TV and they were showing variety of programs, not like the usual they are all on sports channels. Music was cool, and loud enough were you can enjoyed it but perfect to have a conversation and enjoy the time with family and friends which is the point of the gathering. Yes, I do recommend it."
Ty D.,"Fontana, CA",62,10,2,5.0,4/19/2016,"I love Bj's in general, but the first time I went to the Rancho location was very exceptional. My family and I had ordered food. I guess it had taken a long time to come, but we hadn't noticed. The waitress was apologetic and nice. When our food came out is was just fine, but apparently the head chef there wasn't happy about it. He immediately came out and said that the half chicken my mother had ordered wasn't supposed to come out because it was to small. So he told her that she could still have it, but that he was also preparing her another. Because of the wait and that, they comped our bill. We never complained once about anything. They took the initiative to make our experience amazing and I will never forget that and how well they treated us."
Ray R.,"Delaware, OH",91,221,9,3.0,12/9/2014,"Stopped in here to take the class to lunch. Atmosphere:  this is a clean restaurant with loads of seating.  You can sit inside or outside.  It's definitely not an intimate setting, so it's not a place to which I would take a date for a romantic dinner.  Due to the large size of the dining area and the high ceilings, it gets very loud.  There's absolutely nothing to break the noise. Staff:  the wait staff was very friendly and polite.  We had several questions about different menu items and the waiter was able to answer each question professionally.  Our orders were correct when they arrived and the waiter was very attentive. Food:  The food is good.  There are a tremendous number of items on the menu, so it makes selection a little tricky.  However, they have good lunch sized portions that were just the perfect size. Overall, this is a decent restaurant with good food.  As long as you don't mind the noise, it's a good place to go."
Hillary B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",5,45,,5.0,8/19/2016,"Thanks so much for helping the Red Cross by providing dinner at one of the shelters. Your staff person Maria was delightful, so kind. The food was soooo appreciated by everyone."
Angela R.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,19,1,1.0,8/29/2015,If I could give negative stars I would !  Came in for lunch and told it was 1/2 hour wait .  Waited 45 minutes!  The waitress was very nice but when I finally got the salad I ordered it came with a little surprise!! A thick curly black hair!!  Needless to say I lost my appetite .  No more BJS for me !
Andrew S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",71,280,21,2.0,9/23/2015,"Food is ok. Like a solid C if I were to give it a grade. Staff is friendly, but slooowww. I don't know, it just seems like I gain 10 pounds and lose a couple hours off my life expectancy when I go here for lunch. Stopped going, but out of town people like to go here for some reason. The other locations I've been to are decent, but this one is just meh"
Monica S.,"Fontana, CA",0,25,,1.0,8/12/2016,Second time getting the same waiter and she was just as rude as she was the first time. I don't know why she works here if she doesn't look happy. The first time I went she kept asking if she could remove our cheese and chili peppers and after I said we were still using them she sent two other employees to ask and at the end a rude employee just came and took it away. Second time going she just gave so much attitude! Took my order and just looked at me like if I was dumb.
Karla E.,"City of Industry, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/27/2016,"First lets start out by saying that we reserved our place (via online) for a party of 8. We showed up 10 min later because the app said wait time was 20 min. When we got here they told us another 15-20 min, ok we'll wait. 35 min later we were seated. That didn't bother me so much, I get it it was busy. The cocktail drinks were HORRIBLE!!!!! I ordered a vodka soda (Club soda) my waiter came back with a  Vodka tonic  (disgusting! Super sweet) when I asked what it was the waiter said they didn't have club soda. Okkkk.... (You could of asked me if I wanted something else) whatever he seemed fluster and it was busy and I understood how he was feeling so I didn't want to give him a hard time. My mother ordered a Cadillac margarita (disgusting!!!!!) super duper strong and sour. My husband is a teacher at a bartending school, his thoughts were that they weren't counting their pour. When I complained the drink came in a bigger glass with extra sour mixed (yuk!) my cousin ordered a corona, we waited 10 min (yes we had our timers on) for our waiter to come back and tell us they don't carry Corona ( you didn't know that already?) fine we settled for a Heineken. Instead of a regular Heineken we got Heineken Light. Like seriously?! We were so upset already by all that, that we decided not to order food, our kids were hungry so we ordered them food. My daughter got the fettuccini Alfredo (the bread was burnt!) we got the check, all our drinks were untouched. we didn't want to complaint right then and there because I was too upset. We were so disappointed and upset that we didn't care about paying we just wanted to get out of there! We've been here before since we're locals and today was the worst service and visit ever!"
