Idalia L.,"Fontana, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/5/2016,"Over rated. I when yesterday Pay $27 for a pizza. That was not hot, barely warm. I asked for my receipt and I was missing items on my receipt which would be nice but there was other people there that's were going to pay their bills and might have gotten stuck with my stuff.  Service with mediocre. Never going back. It is what it is."
Jack S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11,291,159,3.0,8/22/2014,"Not worth the wait to dine in, but the food is good to-go, even though the service is pretty lacking for both options.  I have conflicted feelings about this BJs, but I think that they fall short of what they  are trying to achieve. Forget about getting in here in a reasonable amount of time on a Friday or Saturday. These days, we only get take out because the wait is unrealistic for the quality of the food. Like a lot of places they don't take a reservation (unless you are a party of 10 or more) and typical wait times on a Friday or Saturday night get into an hour plus. I wish they would offer a certain amount of reservable spaces for those who plan in advance, or are trying to meet up with people and don't want to waste their whole night just sitting around waiting for a table.  The reason that they rank 3 stars with me is because of the food. We love the avocado egg rolls (sometimes all I do is get an order of them to go) and the ""deep dish"" pizza here is pretty good. I use quotes around ""deep dish"" because if you're never seen their pizzas, they are really pan pizza with a typical pizza crust. The beer is pretty good but this is a corporate large operation brewing, not artisanal small batch brewing like they might want you to think from the visible tanks (they don't actually brew at this location, which is why no growler fills are allowed).  The wait staff in general rates just ""meh"". It is the norm to have to ask for things like silverware, water refills, etc. We have dined in at least a dozen times before we switched to purely take out, and never had a server who gave anything above the minimum effort. It has also been my experience at the take out counter to walk up and be ignored by 3 people standing there until the ""designated"" take out person comes out to engage you. It seems like the servers mostly use the computers there to reconcile bills for their tables, and ignore you because it's not their station. Would it have been so hard to look at me and say, ""welcome, someone will be with you in a second""? This hasn't been an isolated incident, this is the norm. I think management needs to look at what is going on at this station. We continue to go for pizza and egg rolls to-go, but unless you are here during off hours, it's not a reasonable wait to be seated."
Katie C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/9/2016,"Tonight my boyfriend and I came in for dinner. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, which i've before, they were excellent. However tonight they came out cold. I let my waiter Gilbert know about this and he got his manager for me, I unfortunately did not catch her name. She came over and apologized which I appreciated but then she began to make light of the situation. She explained to me that her chefs let my food sit instead of bringing it right out to me, and said she would talk to her chefs. She offered to get me something else which I declined then she walked away. when I got my check she had given me $1.66 discount instead of taking the meal completely off.. She admitted to me that she knows her chefs were at fault for my unsatisfactory meal && gave me a $1.66 discount anyway. I am a chef myself so I know what should have been done to get me a hot meal, so I am stunned and insulted at the miniscule discount she had given me. In my opinion Bj's is a big restaurant and the chefs should know better, the fact that my meal was cold and I still had to pay for it, is ridiculous. The only reason why I gave two stars was because my server, Gilbert was awesome, So THANK YOU GILBERT!!"
Sarah S.,"Bishop, CA",17,4,1,1.0,9/13/2015,"Probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced at a restaurant....not from our server, but from the ""manager on duty"". She was completely inept to handle a situation with a gift card and offered no assistance to rectify the situation. They seated our large party and delivered our salads while the restaurant had no clean utensils. We will never return to this location. I called the West Covina BJ's and Brian the manager there was extremely helpful and totally took care of the situation that the manager at Rancho Cucamonga ""couldn't do anything about"". Don't waste your time on this location...there are plenty of other BJ's that will better serve you. If any management reads their Yelp, I urge you to take a close look at your staff and get rid of those that aren't capable of their job description."
Nelson G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,1,1,3.0,2/14/2016,"Food is decent, waitress rarely came by to check on drinks.  I'd be nice if they smiled."
Michael M.,"Fontana, CA",254,124,152,4.0,10/25/2012,"I don't go to BJ's often at all. Come to think of it, this is probably the second time I have ever been to any BJ's Restaurant..  A friend and I had decided to try a few of their Oktoberfest themed menu items. We both ordered the Oktoberfest pumpkin ale. It wasn't overly hoppy and did have a nice pumpkiny finish at the end. Two thumbs up. We ordered the bratwurst sliders served on pretzel bread as an appetizer. Unfortunately it took nearly 20 minutes before we received it. Without us even saying anything about it (we were actually watching Basketball and Baseball on the big screens) a manager had stopped by and sincerely apologized for the bratwurst sliders taking so long. He further proved his sincerity by giving us the sliders free of charge. Score!  The sliders were very, very tasty. The bratwurst had a nice bit of spice and snap to it. The dijon mustard sauce served as a side was also great. But what really did it for me was the pretzel bun. I like soft pretzel bun in lieu of traditional hot dog style buns.. The entire thing was delicous. I was brave enough to order the new Brewhouse Double Deluxe Burger. It's a carnivore's dream. Two half pound angus beef patties, strips of bacon, fried onion petals, and all the other fixin's typical of a classic burger. I was only able to eat the meat, however. That's over a pound of unadulterated meat! In the end I barely finished the meat but left nearly all of the bun and nearly all of my fries. The highlight of the night was when my burger came out. As I stared in confused awe at the sheer immensity of my double bacon burger, a woman dressed in business attire (had to be in her early 40's) came up to my table and asked what I had ordered. My reaction upon reception of said burger must have intrigued her enough to actually come up to me. I told her, ""The Double Brewhouse Deluxe Burger. It has over a pound of meat. And bacon, too!""  She responded with, ""Mmm.. I love lots of meat."" She then winked at me, gave me a sly smile, and turned around and walked back to her table where her girlfriends awaited her return, that entire group tittering like school girls amongst each other. Maybe she did that on a dare?"
Christel L.,"Murrieta, CA",572,641,1647,3.0,10/9/2014,"Not the best BJ's I've been to. The wait can be really long, as well as the service and food output. I think my biggest problem here has always been finding parking. Even when it's not filled to the brim with people waiting and I'm just headed to the bar, the available lots that compete with nearby businesses can't seem to accommodate the number of patrons visiting this area. The hotel that shares the lot area prohibits non-guest parking, so I've seen many cars just parking curbside on some of the entry/exit streets into the lots. Some of the food is good and pizookies are always great, but this place wouldn't be my first choice if I wanted to dine in the area."
Ana A.,"Fontana, CA",2,9,8,5.0,3/11/2015,Came here for my Fathers birthday the other day. The food was delicious we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. It was a great experience server was polite and continued to ask if we were ok.
Pj A.,"Santa Maria, CA",10,3,2,1.0,3/8/2015,Service sucked today !  We got our appetizer 20 minutes after we ordered it . We finally got it and 2min later we got our entree. Took forever to get our bill paid. Plus they try to make up for bad service by giving you an expired coupon.
Anthony F.,"Highland, CA",73,10,5,2.0,12/31/2015,Our most favorite thing to eat here is the CHILE VERDE FRIES and today in New Year's Eve we were told it was removed from the menu!!! What?!? WE LOVED IT!!!! Shame on you for removing our favorite dish! We won't be back....
Jessie D.,"Anaheim, CA",49,67,40,5.0,11/8/2015,"Great drinks and great food. If you are wanting to watch sports while you grab a bite to eat or a drink, there are plenty of tvs to choose from. I love everything I get from there including their special made sodas.Their pizza is to die for and their desserts are a must!"
Maira A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,9,1,5.0,2/2/2016,"Ask for David! Awesome service and ask him for the ""tom"" drink... You won't be disappointed!"
Melissa K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",348,211,1286,5.0,5/23/2014,"Great ambiance, locations is ideal since its right in between 10 freeway and 15 freeway. They have great happy hour deals and a ginormous collection of beer. The food is great, they are known for their pizzas but believe it or not their salads are to die for. Must haves: Avocado roll appetizer, buffalo chicken pizza, and any salad on the menu. Service is consistently great. Check this place out if you are in the neighborhood, absolutely recommend this restaurant, you will not be disappointing."
Darlene D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",54,43,6,3.0,11/23/2015,"It was just...meh. We waited about 20 minutes to get a seat, It was a Monday about 5ish and the restaurant was on the emptier side. I had the baked Ziti which was ok, kind of on the greasy side and my daughter had the spaghetti and meat ball which looked good. Our waitress was very kind, you could tell that she was busy since it seemed to mainly her taking care of all the tables. I wasn't upset or dissatisfied but I also wasn't impressed.  I may come back for happy hour in the bar next time. :)"
Naniki R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",16,69,172,1.0,8/2/2015,"I use to love going to BJ's, I've never been to this location and I don't plan on going back, the serve was HORRIBLE (with the exception of the hostess, manage and busboy) we were stuck in the Bermuda Triangle of tables, we get seated in a busy section with 3 waitresses, 10 minutes later I was asking a busboy to get us our waitress since we had been waiting already 10 minutes with no service in site, I'm guessing he told the manager because she came over and apologized to us and took our order, appetizers come out and finally the waitress comes over to ask what we are drinking and she brings plates and the pizza stand which she proceeds to leave on the table across from us since we were sitting at a small table. Our pizza shows up and I get up and grab the plates, cheese and whatnot as another hostess is about to sit a couple at the same table, she gives me a funny look and I tell her those are our, that the waitress had left them there, I think the waitress came back one time after and that was to hand us the check, I always tip, even with not so good services if I see they are trying but overwhelmed with tables, she didn't even try so for the first time I didn't leave one. Just paid the bill and couldn't get out faster."
Rhonda C.,"Riverside, CA",3,123,12,1.0,6/28/2016,"Let's start this by asking the question ""When do you expect your appetizers to be served""? Well unfortunately for Bjs half come first and then your entree followed by another appetizer.  This is my second time having this problem. Seems to me that the server is overloaded with tables and not putting the appetizers in first. Most servers are paying careful attention to their respective customers. Once appetizers are delivered to the table, then the entree orders are placed in their p.o.s  system. Overall I can understand a mistake here and there but our server even put the incorrect table number in for us. Helpers trying to assist with our food kept trying to give our entrees to the table behind us. Sadly my visit today was a complete disappointment. I won't be coming back to this location. We love the food but service is not to a acceptable standard here."
Alejandro R.,"Riverside, CA",21,77,5,3.0,10/20/2015,"This BJs spot gets 3 stars from me, simply because of the experience that i had. The waitress was really helpful and came and asked if we needed something every so often, not every 3 seconds or never. The food did take a little while, we got out main dish before our appetizers and waited a little for little dipping sauces. Our pizza had big chunks of tomatoes, which is what i asked the waiter if it had but she said it was the sauce, turns out our pizza was like 40% tomato chunks. The beer was good and my wife loved her strawberry mojito. We will definitely give this BJs another try some other day. The food was good just hopefully the waiter gets a little more knowledge on the menu."
Holly B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/18/2016,"Amazing place to visit BUT when you work 50+ hours a week and have two kids....they DELIVER!  I utilize their delivery service at least 2-3 times a month. I have also had lunch delivered to my office for my staff! Several of the deliveries were brought by a young lady I believe her name is Danielle. Very prompt, professional and the orders are always correct. Thank you for the great meals! :)"
Alyssa R.,"Diamond Bar, CA",123,10,5,1.0,1/8/2016,"This was probably the worst service I've ever had at a BJ's. We put in an order for an appetizer, 15 minutes later we started receiving our entrees, when I asked the server about appetizer, she asked if we even ordered one because she never put it in. Ordered the BJ's Classic pizza and there was no sauce, it was the dryest pizza I've ever had. The seared ahi salad was sub par at best."
gene F.,"Carson City, NV",23,4,,3.0,1/7/2016,I really like BJ'S. And this restaurant is good too. The French dip was good. Hard to find nowadays. Coffee was great!!
