Esther G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,1,,3.0,8/15/2016,Hubby and i decided to go out since the girls we're out and we had some grown up time. Well it was going well food and drinks until our waitress flaked on us. She got an attitude after she brought our check and never brought a box like we had asked and her pen sucked because my husband couldn't sign the bill. And im not sure if we'll go back.
L T.,"Baldwin Park, CA",2,35,2,5.0,6/22/2016,"First time at this location. Ordered the blackened salmon, jambalaya, and chocolate pizookie during lunch time. I was satisfied with how the food tasted along with the great customer service they provided. Ordered for take out and food was ready by the time I got there. Manager and staff were really quick and  friendly. They should go train the BJ's in West Covina."
Kelly M.,"Sacramento, CA",919,586,816,4.0,8/16/2012,"I'm not usually a huge fan of chain restaurants but BJ's always seems to fit the bill for a good lunch or dinner. BJ's has greatly expanded their menu to almost a small notebook of choices. I love that they have ""small bites"" now so you can explore a couple different options rather than being stuck getting one huge entree. I went to this location on a Sunday for a lunch with a friend. I arrived around noon and their was absolutely no wait (yay!).  Once my friend arrived, we went to the front desk and were immediately greeted. The front desk was very friendly. We ordered the calamari (a little too chewy for my taste) and the macaroni and cheese.  I'm a huge fan of their mac and cheese because it has baked bread crumbs on top.  I also loved the crushed gold fish crackers. I guess it takes me back to my childhood.  We also ordered salads - one caesar and one house salad with bleu cheese.  The house salad was very fresh and I ate every bite! The staff was so nice to let us sit there for a few hours catching up. They kept refilling my drinks even though we were not ordering any other items.  Overall, the food was solid and the service was stellar. This is a great location!"
Asia N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",125,13,2,5.0,11/22/2015,"Jillian M. was our server. We haven't even left the parking lot yet and I needed to review how great she was. She is a total sweetheart and took care of everything we needed. We each had specific requests and she didn't flinch or seem bothered. She handled everything so nicely and professionally. She is definitely an example waitress. My family and I had a not-so-great experience with another server there, but Jillian restored our faith in BJ's. Thank you for being awesome and making our experience so pleasant!"
karla z.,"Los Angeles, CA",213,9,,1.0,6/30/2016,"I must start by saying I loved BJs and have never had exceptional service but good service that I continue to come back. Coming from management background I must say management here needs much improvement.  I went In for lunch with my mom 2 toddlers and an infant hoping lunch would be a pleasant quick meal.  WOW Was I wrong!  I came in 10 mins before 3 ordered lunch right away and it took over 30 minutes for a personal pizza for my kids and a sandwich. The server seemed apologetic but never refilled our drinks and we had no setting and never brought condiments I asked for and when the food arrived my kids pizza was cold which is fine since they are kids but the sandwich was super cold hardly any meat and it didn't have all the ingredients the menu stated. Not only had I waited so long for this but it was terrible. The server even agreed when I asked her about the sandwich, if she knew it looked bad why serve it?!  She then said she was talking to her manager and the manager was coming to our table to apologize. The manager never showed up to the table 30 minutes later we still had no re-done sandwich I had to ask again what was going in and at that point just asked for the bill. I have 3 kids desperate we have been there over an hour with only a personalize pizza.  Then Someone that looked like the chef came out said sorry for how bad the food was. He agreed how bad the presentation of the meals were and said I know you're experience was bad let's just take it as that and I will take care of the meal. That was a nice gesture but I honestly would've preferred to spent the 15 dollars with great service and food  and not leave with kids that waited over an hour for a simple lunch. Management really needs to step it up. At least some sort of communication to explain why our meal took ages and was horribly made plus why when re-doing it takes even longer. My poor kids were desperate to leave. My mom and I had to go to mcdonald and I thought I would never say this but mcdonald customer service was much better.  Our overall experience was so poor and handles beyond poorly. In my past management experience I have easily changed a customers view by taking responsibility when a problem occurs and making sure the customer knows how important they are to our business we def didn't matter to them and it's sad a place like this can't even handle a small situation like this one much better."
Illy C.,"Eastvale, CA",77,38,48,2.0,12/17/2015,The steak my brother got here tasted like somebody dumped an entire can of salt on it. In one of our other dishes (jambalaya) at the bottom of the plate it had the plastic wrapper it comes in. So of course we call a waitress over she kind of makes a joke about it (not good) so we ask for the manager. The reason this place even gets any stars is because the manager handled it very well! She redid all of our orders and was very apologetic and tried to make right of the situation.
Apryl T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",956,184,109,3.0,9/13/2012,"Bj's has an awesome atmosphere inside especially when you come to watch games, there is tv's on the walls everywhere.  Bj's has quality food for a chain. I've tried several of their menu items and my favorites are the avocado rolls, parmesan crusted chicken, and their greek specialty pizza. Nothing stands out of course like their stellar pizookie! My personal favorite time and time again is the oreo pizookie. A hot oreo baked cookie, topped with icecream and oreo whipped cream. I literally could eat the entire dessert to myself although I share most of the time! :P  Lunch specials are worth checking out as well. Service: I am only giving 3 stars because service here is up and down. And last few times I come here its been on the down side. No refills, server is nowhere to be found, and last few times I order an appetizer here it never comes out. The server completely forgets to put in the order. My last server also charged me for pizza toppings that I did not order on my pizza."
Russ K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/11/2016,Not very busy but unbelievably slow. And this was a Monday night. Took forever to take order so we thought we should order dinner when we ordered appetizers. No surprise our meals were right on top of the appetizer.
Nola P.,"San Bernardino, CA",60,13,25,4.0,1/6/2016,Last Saturday was my first time here. It was packed waited 20mins to be seated which I didn't mind cause it was obviously full. I really like the cleanliness and how large the restaurant is. We (My friends & I) did have an issue with our orders twice (burnt fried appetizer & wrong size pazookie). However management took care of it right away. Impressed with their prompt customer service. Other than the issue of the orders takes away the 5th star. The adult drinks are goood and not light weight like applebees lol So drink wisely! :)
Tobe G.,"Riverside, CA",40,86,57,2.0,10/31/2015,Waited 25 minutes for a beverage.  Server dumped wings off a plate onto floor and not only left them there didn't replace them in the customers plate!  Calamari was a little overlooked and only had flavor with dipping sauce.  Decided not to order dinner because why prolong the madness when there's so many better places around right?  Two stars because beer was cold and fruit tea is very good...prob would know better with refills but hey we we're leaving for a reason right?
Ryan A.,"Chino, CA",11,25,3,5.0,10/1/2015,"Great lunch place- one of the few places that staffs for the rush and delivers quick service. Good food for a chain concept. Love the mobile app to order, pay, and tip without needing to wait for the waiter."
Victoria L.,"Upland, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/8/2016,"Ordered ToGo, the cashier showed me on the labels that my order was what I requested so I paid for my order & left. Anyways, I had everything I didn't request on my sandwich ALL in my sandwich.   At this point I was miles away at work. I call and the manager lets me know how he's sorry and how they will send me a meal replacement voucher via email...been 2 days still haven't received anything in my email. Not sure what's going on but I'll wait."
Dodd D.,"Greenville, SC",19,12,,4.0,12/19/2015,"Love this place. So accommodating and flavorful. Try the jambalaya, you won't regret it."
Nick H.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",47,33,,5.0,10/15/2015,"Everything they make is great. Wide variety of food. Great lunch specials. 6.99 for 1/2 sandwhich, side, and soup. Normally get Pesto Chicken, Mixed Veggies, and Chicken tortilla soup. This soup is amazing!  Veggies are mixed squash, greenbeans, asparagus, broccoli, carrots. Very good and big portion!"
Ritchie C.,"Monrovia, CA",7,14,9,1.0,6/29/2014,"Came here with the family for lunch. 4 of us total. Ordered hot wings apps. delicious! and a deep dish meat pizza..... There was a pretty good size crowd, not to big not to small. The servers i think were overstaffed, I think we had a least 5-6 different people come to our table, making it a little confusing.  Problem was, we were served appetizers. No silverware, no napkins, when all of a sudden no servers were around. like they all went on break at the same time. After a few minutes I was able to flag someone down to ask for some. ok. our pizza was here.  We started in on the pizza which seemed to have no sauce at all, and very dry. I was hungry so i continued to eat it. Plus no servers were around to say anything to.  All of us were disappointed in this pizza. when we told the server she replied with ""would you like me to bring some marinara sauce?"" we are done eating. I said  ""Ok, would you like me to make it to go.""  I understand, thats a good response in some situations. Like at the beginning, when we started.  As many staff members that were there, services wasn't very organized.  Upon leaving we told the manager about our experience. (I'm not looking for a free meal, and we already paid for our meal) this was his response. ""Oh, ok. thank you for telling me."" and turned around and started talking to staff. well, i won't go there again. thats just rude."
Paul V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,75,3,5.0,11/9/2015,"Stopped in on 5/24 in the evening hours with the family. We had a party of 5 and the wait was less than 15 minutes. Server was great, very attentive. Ordered one of their new thin crust pizzas which was delicious. The kids had pizza, club sandwich, and chicken tenders and all were good. Wife also loved the balsamic chicken. Wait for food was short which was surprising since they were extremely busy.  On a side note the heavy set female hostess that was working last night around 5 ( no name  tag) was heard being very rude and short with other customers, and not just one... Several. Management needs to check her before she causes negative business.  We will be back."
Sean P.,"Upland, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/31/2016,"We love eating out at BJ's, because this is one of the few restaurants where our little ones will actually eat most of their food. This review is for Saturday, To-Go order. We decided to skip the crowd this time and order Curbside. We put our order in for 6:30PM pick up and show up like 5 minutes early. An employee came out and we presented our   gift-card to him and this is when the issues started. We must have had 4 different people come up to my car window asking to see the giftcard. Also we must have heard the word ""fraud"" used (not directly at us but STILL) over a handful of times. The manager even threw in a snarky ""I bet you do hope these are real"" remark as well. So here I am, trying to pick up dinner for my family. Being passively-aggressively called a fraud and an idiot, just because I am using a giftcard? Un-fucking-real. After 45 minutes of this shit-show my wife went inside and they finally gave us our food. The sad part is, we still have a balance on the gift-card.  Will we receive the same treatment next time? I am sure we will."
Robert A.,"Pomona, CA",2,18,1,1.0,11/5/2015,"What service? Came here for lunch with a couple friends and left after being blatantly ignored. 10 minutes into sitting down we finally got menus, but that's where it ended. Server walked around handing out drinks, glanced over a few times and continued about her business. Got up and left 20 minutes later."
Lori S.,"Orange, CA",1,23,,5.0,12/7/2015,"We had a wonderful lunch with great service for our wish kid, her family and all of our volunteers. Manager was so easy to work with and our waitress was so sweet and sang a beautiful song for our wish kid."
Roy B.,"Anaheim, CA",763,793,6183,4.0,3/24/2012,"Went to BJ's a couple of weeks ago for a business lunch.  When we arrived at 11ish the restaurant was just jumping into lunch mode. By the time we left the place was packed. Warning get there early or else!  We were seated right away and the waitress was friendly and answered all of our questions. For starters we had some artichoke dip, it was pretty good 7 out of 10. For lunch I had the clam chowder and shrimp scampi and must say that I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of both. Nice size scampi portion, even took some home.  While I've had BJ's before, this was my best BJ for lunch."
