Kristen J.,"Fontana, CA",50,8,3,1.0,11/21/2015,"Placed a take out order. Ordered loaded salads minus carrots and tomatoes, one with their vinegar dressing which was all olive oil and no vinegar, and no toppings , just lettuce, and we ordered garlic knot with it and didn't get it. Actually both had no toppings. Watched the take out cashier and she was just answering the phone and the. Immediately hanging up on them. She hung up on me too so I ordered online. And then I did a follow up call because I didn't get an email confirmation and got hung up again before I could correct the order she read to me. They need more employees on weekends. These guys are overwhelmed if they don't have the time to read an order right. They were hustling but couldn't keep up with all the people there. Maybe not bad customer service but bad owners or management."
Vanessa A.,"Ontario, CA",8,3,,5.0,1/4/2016,"BJ's is a great place to eat,  I went to the one in Balboa CA on Saturday 1/2/16 with my family it was great service and every thing we ordered was great and the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs was very delicious and tasted very well, I would want to know the recipe"
Melissa K.,"Upland, CA",243,78,8,5.0,8/18/2015,"Great restaurant and the restaurant just has a great energy about it. Convenient location with great hours and wide variety of choices for appetizers, lunches, dinners and certainly one must try at least once, their pizookie!!"
Nick H.,"Anaheim, CA",1968,2395,6076,2.0,3/4/2012,"Overpriced and under in taste, just like every other BJs. What's different about this one? Their service. Very friendly but super slow. It took a whopping 35 minutes to get my Cobb Salad.  The salad was AOK. There's not a whole lot to choose from in the area, but I doubt I will be back."
Kim T.,"Orange County, CA",1156,1046,2847,3.0,3/24/2014,"Food wasn't as good as other BJ's that I have been to.  My Minestrone soup was little bits of vegetables, no beans or noodles.  I think I got the bottom of the pot.  Mac & cheese sucked.  Buffalo Wings were not crispy, soggy and luke-warm.  Service was good though."
Anica M.,"Riverside, CA",37,75,111,4.0,5/26/2015,"While I can live without the overpriced ""skinny"" drinks, I really like the beer variety because I don't normally opt for beer. Its cool that the happy hour menu lasts until 7pm, including holidays;)"
Celina V.,"Corona, CA",1077,69,52,5.0,6/30/2015,"What can I say about BJ's. Well that this is my favorite restaurant since they came to California, and #Rancho Cucamonga location is my very very favorite. I love most of their entries, but I do love their Clam Chowder Soup. I miss the BBQ Steak Sandwich and wish that they will bring it back. Customer services they need to change a little, as lately they are not the same as few years ago. #bj'srestaurant #ranchocucamonga #restaurant"
Rusty S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,156,36,1.0,4/18/2015,"If i could give zero star's I wouldl!  Worst management. Worst service! We will not be back! Went in an hour and a half before closing. Waited 10 minutes for a server to come by and take our drink orders. Water...2 beers..a coffee...and 1 mixed drink. Waited another 10 minutes before we finally received them. Waited another 30 minutes before getting up and searching for our server, who was no where in sight. Finally after another 10 minutes I asked to speak to the manager who brought the waitress over. He asked what he could do for us. I told him we've been waiting a while to order. His response is ""Well, she's here now"". Really?  The icing on the cake is that we had a child with us, whose food was delivered last. 5 minutes after everyone else revived theirs. Not ok. We will not be back.....worst management ever."
Dj R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,40,7,1.0,12/20/2015,"Went back to BJ'S after a good experience, after a bad experience, that we returned after a managers comp. and personal call. Well, things went back to bad to even worse. Extremely slow service while server was playing around with fellow employees, mustard bottle had a thick crust on top. Disgusting, couldn't use it. Terrible experience. Shortly after there was credit card fraud on our credit card. BJ'S was the last place we used it. We don't use it very often so it was easy to back track. I don't want to use the servers name, but I know who she is and I hope it doesn't happen to you. I will never go back to any BJ'S again. Have never had that happen before. TG we were protected on our card and they were investigating. I hope she was caught.  Time has elapsed since this happened because I thought I already posted it? Don't know what happend?"
Jessica A.,"Alhambra, CA",8,144,44,2.0,8/2/2014,I would give it a 4 but I had an accident several months ago and their human resource office is just horrible.   Your better off talking to the wall. Food is always usually good.  Staff us pretty friendly as well.
Turia S.,"Covina, CA",166,27,273,1.0,6/16/2015,"I ordered the salmon with quinoa, and boy was it very very salty! And I am sensitive to sodium. I don't recommend ordering the salmon it is made with too much salt. I had to drink alot of water all day"
Mel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,64,34,4.0,7/26/2015,Not the best BJs or family had been too but yummy food as always. Pizza order toppings were wrong and so was our burger. Our waitress was very sweet though and apologetic and comped our desserts.
Amry S.,"Ontario, CA",21,30,,1.0,4/9/2015,My friend ordered the chili potatoe and when she was pulling out the cheese a long hair came out. We were so grossed out that the other 2 co-workers stopped eating and informed the manager who asked us if we wanted to get food or take something back and we politely declined. We went to lunch before and the server took forever and the wait was long. I think we won't be back there for a while. They need to understand lunch time for some guest is limited.
Daddy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,44,29,4.0,7/24/2014,"Yall already know by now that this is my spot. Always a cool vibe, good food, & great service. Today, the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon w/Grilled Asparagus & Quinoa. #BonAppetite'"
Amy M.,"La Puente, CA",316,257,485,1.0,1/20/2014,"Came here today & the service was definitely disappointing & RUDE! Our waitress, CHANDRA B. seemed like she was trying to rush us the whole time. When we were HALFWAY into our meal; she brings us our check, we didn't even ask for it & asks us if we wanted boxes for our meals? Umm wtheck?! When did we even say we were done & wanted our check? How rude. Never have I been to a restaurant that brought me my check w/o me even asking for it.  If I could give it a 0 then I definitely would!!"
Anthony T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",21,13,,2.0,4/12/2015,"Don't go here If you are bringing a growler to fill up that you purchased from any other BJs. Food is good and it is little busy at times . As far as them not participating in the growler program is beyond an inconvenience, I bought my growler in West Covina BJs and thought it was perfect considering how close I live to this BJs....... Not the case!"
Tiny B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,27,16,3.0,12/27/2015,love their bbq pizza$21 with blonde beer$7 !!!  Can only enjoy if you can win the parking war here.
Fred D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/18/2016,"If you come to this BJ'S make sure to check your food. Ordered a pizza with no red sauce and toppings specifically stating they could use alfredo, olive oil, etc. They brought out a pizza with no sauce and all the toppings slid over to one side of the box off the pizza dough. 42 minutes later they bring the redone pizza (part of a  $225 order). I'm done."
Violet G.,"Orange, CA",10,332,12,2.0,7/6/2014,"I came here for lunch with friends last week, and I was not impressed.  The service was good, but the food was lackluster.  We had the Southewest spring rolls (good), and the ahi (mediocre) as appetizers.  I had the ahi salad as my entree; it was a decent salad overall, but the quality of the ahi was significantly worse than the ahi in the appetizer (which wasn't amazing).   We had a pizookie for dessert, which was good."
Aaron F.,"Baldwin Park, CA",197,1,,1.0,9/2/2015,"Had bad service at other restaurants, but this experience was by far the worse. Food was good but wasn't worth the rude service. To top off the night, our waitress decided to give us change in all 1$ bills.I understand that a $50 is overkill on a $20 food bill, but I needed to use the larger bill to give an appropriate tip. If you are around the Ontario Mills location and ""need"" to eat BJ's, maybe you should consider the take out option and spare yourself a headache."
