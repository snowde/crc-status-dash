Graciela P.,"Ontario, CA",1,57,185,4.0,8/9/2017,"When we got there the place looked pretty packed, yet only took them five minutes to seat us so it wasn't a long wait (but then again all the people waiting were from a big group so that helped). Our server was pretty great, she took her time explaining some questions we had from the menu and was back several times to check if we needed anything else or more drinks. The food was ok but for the prices they have I would expect it to be better. I really don't have a problem paying$16 & some change for a pizza but for it to be small and just ok, now that I do have an issue with. Overall for the food 3 stars but our server she gets the full 4, I would return though I'm just staying away from the deep dish pizzas."
Katie J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",62,27,,2.0,5/7/2017,"Ok so I want to start of by saying I love BJs! I have gone for multiple occasions; prom, birthdays, etc. me and my family decided to go and we waited for over an hour to be seated, which was reasonable considering it was a Saturday.  Once we were seated we sat for a long time before even being asked for drinks and it took over a half hour for our food. When the food arrived my dad had ordered fish and it was cold. My deep dish pizza was doughy inside, and my sisters grilled cheese had a BLACK circle where it had been burnt.  They apologized and offered a free pazookie to make up for it. I am a big pazookie fan, in fact I never go to BJs without ordering it because it is so good. When we got it it was not only cold, but hard. If you have ever had it before it is usually amazing and hot. I was very disappointed with our experience."
Ronny M.,"Santa Monica, CA",7,47,49,3.0,5/28/2017,"Here today for a graduation luncheon. Spread consists of your choice of 4 all you can eat pizzas, pasta, salad, & beverage. No alcohol .  Pizza is pretty good. We had pepperoni, and 3 other adequate tasting pies. Selection of pizza is sufficient, also offering vegetarian . Pasta is crap, salad is ok.  If your not familiar with BJs, the beer selection is limited. BJs offers a menu of beers from they're own brews, aka BJs hefenwizen, stout, etc. Buffet was fairly priced, $14.95 Service was mediocre, not enough attention for a group of 45, we got thirsty.. It's BJs, give me a break Forget about it"
Sabrina H.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/19/2017,"SCOTT was amazing!!! Best service I've had there before! He's great, very happy and cheerful and made my date night memorable!! THANK YOU SCOTT!!!!  you're the best!!"
Kevin L.,"Chino, CA",92,105,68,3.0,10/7/2017,Service was slow. They were busy tho.  Food was good and drinks were good as well.  Just slow service. Many of the servers were running around but more of chaos than really a system.  It was mid day on a Saturday and it was busy.
Kimberly P.,"Altadena, CA",25,47,96,1.0,9/4/2017,"This place is CRAP! We waited so long for our food and then when it finally arrived some of the food was cold. Not the best tasting food either, we all got sick afterwards. Terrible food and terrible wait time. We won't be coming back to this place or any other BJ's for that matter."
April P.,"Fontana, CA",211,4,2,4.0,10/7/2017,Went last night with a group of friends and usually when I go it's like an hour wait but it was only 30 minutes. My waiter name was Jeremiah and he was honestly the best waiter I've had at this establishment. He not only served our table of 6 but about 5 other tables and was not rude about it. He definitely was such a pleasure. He checked on us periodically and got us things we needed in a timely manner. Would definitely go back just to see him. Best customer service in awhile.
Emily L.,"Fontana, CA",136,86,144,5.0,3/29/2016,"4.5 rounded up  I called ahead to add my name to the wait list and my party of 3 was seated in less than 10 minutes after arriving.  We ordered a top sirloin with asparagus and a baked potato, the Parmesan chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes and subbed the broccoli for rice pilaf, and a kids deep dish pepperoni pizza with a strawberry lemonade. The food tasted really good, no complaints at all. The pizza was kinda small, but it's for kids. The lemonade was extremely sour though.  We ordered 2 kids pizookies (even though we only had one child). We got white chocolate macadamia nut and salted caramel. Sooooo good and extremely worth the price, $2.50 for each. The kids size is also the size they use for their mini trio but I think they put less ice cream on the kids. I believe the mini trio is $10.50, but if you have kids, it's more worth it if you get 3 kids pizookies than the trio.  Service could have been a little better. Our server was not too friendly until after we paid and the food took forever to come out, but the food definitely made up for it."
Dion T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",95,45,154,4.0,4/27/2017,"Beer prices are the best in town. Nice ambiance. Food prices are great. Good for familie, dates, even happy hour"
Samira C.,"Victorville, CA",123,46,31,4.0,9/24/2017,"This is one of the better BJ's I've been to, but that's probably because I was here for a Bridal Shower. The food was buffet style. They were very on top of our drinks and taking our dirty plates. I appreciate the free wifi, considering they have no service in the restaurant. The food was average. Beer was good. But it's so damn loud in there, it's hard to hold a convo with the person across from you."
Lakina J.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,10,2,5.0,10/12/2017,"Went with 2 of my friends here on A Monday evening. We always come to BJs. Especially this location. Yet this time was like any other. We had a waitress names Harley. She was beyond attentive and nice. Her customer service was an A+. For now on, when I come to this location, I will request to be seated in her section."
Sandy S.,"Redlands, CA",1,6,,1.0,12/17/2017,"So a group of ten of us got together for our Xmas dinner and at first it was just two of us when we got their mind you it's Friday night and traffic is horrible and we had our friends coming from different city's . We told the host up front the rest were on there way and she said fine . The host said it would be a 45 min wait for table which was fine since more were on there way . However we got seated about twenty min  later myself and friend our waiter Andy was awesome . But then the host kept on coming back and fourth asking when everyone is getting there because if they were not there in ten min they were going to take our other table . Seriously, from there it just downed our spirit . So my friend ask to speak to a manager twice and then finally one came we were just advising regarding our complaint and then another one steps in I couldn't even look at her she had so much glitter on her eyes she was blinding me . I would not come here again and would recommend another restaurant. These host definitely need more training or coaching !"
Trinidad G.,"San Pedro, CA",25,5,,2.0,8/3/2017,Placed my order 45 min ago and it was not ready and then didn't really accommodate me for it... never again
Maria B.,"Ontario, CA",53,4,,2.0,8/6/2017,My coworkers and I came here one night to enjoy a meal together. We waited about 40 minutes which was understandable considering there was a game that night. Our waitress Raquel gave us our table for 7.We ordered our drinks then our food. The food took a little long but the quality of my Chicken Alfredo was worth the wait. Would recommend this dish...  The reason I give a 2 star rating is because of the quality of the service. Our waitress had a very bad attitude towards us all night long. When a co-worker attempted to ask her a question regarding a dish she was rude and dismissed his questions with another question.  We also had a promo for buy one entree and two drinks get an entree free. As soon as we brought it out she looked upset about it.  When it came time to pay she brought the check to our table. It was only one bill. We kindly asked her if she could split the check because we wanted to pay individually. She got upset and blamed us for the incident. She told us that we should have told her before we ordered our food. She then told us she could only split it 3 ways. So we payed like that.  I would have written a good review had she not blamed us for the whole event. I believe she could have handled it differently and more professionally without blaming the customer.
Max C.,"Pasadena, CA",13,140,15,3.0,2/13/2017,"It's BJ's so you know what to expect. Fine dining it isn't. If you need a reliable bite and something to wash it down then you won't leave disappointed.  This location gets pretty packed in the evenings and even more so around holiday time. There can be quite a long wait at times. Go for the bar if possible. The food is what is, lol. Pizza, wings, burgers and the obligatory salad. Tons of draft options for beers. Pricing seems reasonable for me. Parking when it's gets really crowded can be a burden. That lot fills up super quick."
Gloria F.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/8/2017,"Have nothing but positive experiences at this place. Our last server was Mayra and she has got to be by far the best server we have had. From start to finish she was pleasant, got the grandkids fruit and a biscuit, at no cost, without us even asking. Kept the kids busy until food arrived If your ever at this location, request Mayra you will not be disappointed. We always order the pizza, as it is very tasty."
Rosalie H.,"Walnut, CA",63,118,172,3.0,8/27/2016,"Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. Good parking and great location (near movie theater and shopping) I usually really love BJ'S but am on the fence with whether I would return here. Service is fine but the food here is the worst I have ever had from a BJ'S. We ordered their chicken sandwich and blue cheese burger with  a side of clam chowder. Everything was Luke warm to cool, soup was especially salty, burger was tasteless and the chicken was dry. Given all of that I probably should have rated this a 2 but I am feeling generous today."
Michelle M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",81,84,77,4.0,3/8/2017,"Recently had dinner at BJ's.  It was good, however on this particular night, they seemed a little disorganized.  The service was slow, but our appetizers and dinner was still yummy.  We frequent this location a lot, so I know we'll be back again soon."
Ara P.,"Fontana, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/27/2017,Love the clam chowder...I don't visit them often but when I do it's for the soup...everything else is ok...clam chowder is good for those who haven't tried it...it's not too fishy...
Lawrence B.,"Riverside, CA",1,6,1,1.0,7/19/2017,"So disappointed . . I realize today was free piazookie day but are you not aware of the kind of crowed that's going to bring in? Took our server 20 mins to finally greet us, but our food did come out in a timely manner but once we ordered our free piazookie we waited 35 mins and left."
