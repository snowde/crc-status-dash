Ciinthiiaa G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",14,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,"Really bad service not so good food definitely wont be back!!! Didn't get napkins, no plates with our appetizers, no refills."
anthony p.,"Fontana, CA",53,22,,1.0,5/29/2015,"Sons graduation dinner. My wife made reservations a month prior called to confirm the day of. After he graduated we arrived at location and was told we had no reservations we had 30 people and some from out of town and state. Manager was rude and arrogant. They had the room to seat us in the patio, we asked they said no we have to wait 2 hours. Long story short service was horrible, manager was rude, ruined my son's grad night, stressed out my wife. Some of our party left. We won't be back. Suggest you don't go either. At least not if your celebrating a graduation."
L. D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,57,,1.0,6/9/2016,"We had a bad experience at this BJs on Tuesday evening.We waited over 10 mins while waiters & waitresses breezed by us,while the bartender watched at us.FINALLY a waitress asked if we wanted to order to pick up(we were waiting @ the to-go area).She said the to-go staff had left for the day but we could order @ the bar. She walked with us to the bar and told the bartender we wanted to order,he told her to take our order.When we spend the bag,salmon was missing from our order,the calamari was tough and inedible! I called the restaurant 5 minutes before they closed,no one answered the phone.I sent a message thru BJS website,no one has responded! I posted on FB,Now they say""send us a private message)which I just did but I want people to know of my poor experience here. I will not return and suggest no one does either!"
Greg S.,"Nashville, TN",8,325,2,4.0,5/26/2014,Having been here a dozen times this is a solid place for a beer and dinner. Burgers are a winner and the stout is good too.
Niall K.,"Yeovil, United Kingdom",1,21,8,4.0,10/29/2014,"Strange name for a restaurant, I was half expecting something else ;) Anyway, decent place. First time in BJs but it's got a good selection of food. We had to wait about 25 minutes which sucked but they cannot help being busy. We were eventually seated by Luz, and received our drinks promptly.  I ordered the mozzarella sticks and pepperoni extreme flatbread pizza whilst my other half tried the California pizza.  Both were pretty good, nothing special but it's certainly good value for money.  Nothing really to note, good food, good service."
Mia L.,"San Diego, CA",578,1138,1507,4.0,1/17/2012,"12.16.11: Me: Do u wanna try BJs?  Reply: what? u want to give me a BJ?  Me: wth, gross let's go eat there.. Reply: uhhhh.. Me: it's a restaurant. Lol Reply: lol BJs gets super crowded, the big TVs are awesome and finding seating at the bar has been quite smooth, so far I have been lucky. Seared Ahi Tuna:  small app to start, tasty and fresh, surprised it wasnt fishy, the slaw is quite refreshing.  Spinach Mushroom: Oh o hot and spinachy! Stuff mushroom, good size mushroom and tasty!  BJ Pizza: Its the works. Taste better than Pizza Hut, I always liked their pizza and great portions too.  Serivce has been great the first two times..Hopefuly it stays that way!"
Amber M.,"Sierra Madre, CA",174,520,203,1.0,11/7/2013,"We came here a few weeks ago with a party of eight and waited almost two hours for a table. We asked a few times for the status and they kept telling us ""10-15 minutes"", so finally we walked next door to Dave's BBQ and were seated in FIVE MINUTES!!!! We handed back the pager and told them we weren't going to wait anymore and they didn't care. I've been here before and the food and service isn't that great anyways. We didn't miss out and I don't think I'd waste more time for this place."
Joan T.,"Chino, CA",340,116,318,1.0,12/7/2013,"I've been here twice and it never fails to have THE WORST SERVICE EVERRRRRRRRRRR. Never go to this BJs.  The first time I ate here, the waitress took half an hour to get us water, another 20 to come By and take our order, and 40 to get us our food.  The second time, I only came for a pizookie. We sat down and not a single waiter came to out table after 20 minutes to take our order, let along ask if we have been waited on. We left shortly. Pizookie-less.  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!"
Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",231,590,1953,3.0,7/9/2012,"I like BJ's, but seem to get better service at other locations (Covina, San Bernardino. etc.). Maybe it was because this time I was sitting at a table full of chatty ladies, and the server was thinking oh no, these ladies are going to camp out here all night and talk, talk, talk!  Well, she was probably right, as some of these ladies are non-stop talkers . . . but she may have increased her sales and tips and interrupted the talk marathon if she pushed dessert, coffee, specials at the bar -- hint, hint, get out of here!  Anyway, I like the watermelon salad off the small plates menu, and I also tried the won tons, but those were not so good.  My favorite thing here is the P'zookie, but didn't have any this time, because like I said, talk, talk, talk!  Can't waste any more time eating!"
Angelina R.,"Fontana, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/2/2016,"So I was there last night and got the tomato mozzarella salad. The tomatoes weren't ripe at all, hard as apples. The rest of the food was good and our host was very sweet. Then my mom dropped her keys between the booth and the wall. Well they moved the booth a little and the keys were there along with dust, dirt, dirty napkins, old food, and even a credit card. Soooo they obviously don't do any deep cleaning or maintaining. Went to use the restroom, no toilet paper and the floor was filthy. Went back the next day to give it another shot. Got the tomato mozzarella salad again and it was worse than the night before. There were pieces of corn in it (I get it they make it all in the same kitchen) so I could look past that but again with the hard tomatoes. Green and hard, not ripe at all. The calamari was room temperature and had no flavor. It was also very soft and flimsy. There were positives I am never disappointed with the pizookie but then again it's hard to go wrong with a cookie. I can even say something about the way the management always seems careless but I'll stop here. The BJ's in San Bernardino is better."
Paulo B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,35,20,5.0,4/21/2016,"Yes, that's right. 5 stars! That's because this is a big chain restaurant, and it was far better than you would expect. We had a large group and they seated us quickly. The drinks were awesome and arrived quickly, and I can tell you the blackened salmon was totally delicious and cooked perfectly. Kids waiting on us were pleasant, helpful, and prompt. Perfect."
Clemente M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/16/2015,Horrible service.  Took almost 40 minutes to get our food.  They need to better prepare for the lunch hour rush - and our group of 4 primarily just ordered a soup and salad.  The waitress made it seems like it was our fault.  Very odd experience.
Sunila A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/29/2016,"BJ'S food is nice but not out of the world..it sure killed our appetite by the wait time for sure.. . After 20mts wait time, we were seated. Server took the order and left. After like 15mts got the appetizer. Then we waited for 1hr and 15mts for the main course . Even though we enquired about the delay , there was no response. Waited an hour for the soda refill. It seems big  families not welcome, only couples or singles at the bar...not sure who is uninformed - customers- have to pay for food ...or  management thinks they are doing a favor by serving food, the BJ's management does not take a penny less but expect paying customer to suck up all the bad things and response getting from the manager is all food will go in trash, as if an option is given, when we were going to leave.Horrible experience, no more......"
Jay L.,"San Diego, CA",92,220,19,2.0,11/2/2013,"Hannah was our server; the food was only okay. I had the medium rare Black and Bleu burger here.... ughhhh not a good choice... more like a greasy sponge with a meaty mat 2 soggy bacon strips and stanky cheese.... I think anything beefy at a BJs establishment is wrong... like Derek's meatloaf.... I'm feeling it right now, I want to put lesser stars for the food but the service was pretty decent.  Black and Bleu barfer...."
Jakkie Y.,"Chino Hills, CA",83,16,50,5.0,10/20/2013,I always have bad experience going here but after having Kristen d as my waitress. I'd higher her as a role model for bj's. Best customer service I had in years..
Blog S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,40,3,2.0,11/18/2013,"Some of the worst food ever. Yuck. I can't believe people settle for this.  Overpiced , preservative laden ""fluff"" This place is okay. I've experienced better. The service is so-so and too slow at times. Inside it looks like a the set of ""The Voice"" or something like that with this humongous sectional TV screen in the bar and a large lobby for waiting and staging.   The tables and chairs are arranged somewhat strange and in too much of a cramped manner in certain areas. The problem I have is with the food. Why are people ok with food that tastes like a chemical sewer? The preservatives and what not used in their food is far too distinctive and takes away from the enjoyment. When I go to a place like this, I don't expect the food to be nasty like that. One high note is their large selection of what they claim are home-brewed beers. Red Ale, Pale Ale, lagers..  If you're not a beer person you won't get it. But I don't drink the cheap beers. If I drink beer , it's like what they serve at this restaurant. This place is notoriously popular and crowded and there is always a wait-probably because it's right across from the Ontario Mills Mall.  Don't worry, you won't be waiting that long, (maybe 15 minutes or so) Noise level is quite loud, like some type of club or high school cafeteria, as it looks like a club inside.. Ambiance is hip and casual dressy with nice decor. Don't show up in your cut off jean shorts people. Have some class."
Gerry R.,"La Habra, CA",127,35,100,3.0,4/3/2014,"The place is well kept and clean. Waiter was polite, but did forget to put in our appetizers. Very good about replenishing drinks for the exception of water. The food was good and filling. Happy hour in effect after 10pm Sun-Thurs. And of course the pazookie makes everything better.."
Econ E.,"Rialto, CA",358,61,42,4.0,5/16/2015,"I've been here a few times and like the food and prices.  Tonight, Saturday night just after 9, we could barely find parking.   I was so pleased that even though it was packed, the guy said a 10 minute wait, which was only about 3.  Our server, Jessica,  was great, friendly, personable, on point, and got my husband's picky order right!  We had a great time!  I like the 80s music too.  My husband would have had a better time if his TV were playing football follies like mine was, instead of golf and hockey, but whatever. I highly recommend!"
Fermin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,30,12,1.0,9/24/2013,"This review is solely for 9-7-13 My two friends & I came here after our amazing show at the Hip Hop Festival Rock the Bells.   I refused to eat fast food so I suggested Bjs. After my experience in this joint, we should have went elsewhere.. First of all this place was either understaff on a Saturday night or they are really slow in the service..  We was really hungry & it took forever to get our Drinks, same with appetizers.. I also order the Jambalaya with pasta & I received it with Rice instead. We kept running out of our drinks & again took forever to get some service. (The restaurant wasn't even full at this time midnight) It's a shame, I go to the Culver city & Century city locations & get better service there. This place is horrible service, I regret coming here & I woudn't even go again if it was Free!"
O'Dran O.,"Ontario, CA",2,30,1,5.0,8/10/2015,"We always skipped this place whenever the family eats out because my kids thought the place is for grown ups. Until they aired the cutesy ""get your own"" commercial my daughter acceded to going. We like this restaurant because of its ambiance, pricepoint is reasonable and they have quite a selection of food. Now it's a place we always consider when we eat out."
