Jennie R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/9/2015,"My waitress is Cory. It took her awhile to come to our table. Sept 9 at 4:30 not busy, lots of workers. We waited for our ice teas and waited. Our salad arrived about 10 minutes still no drinks. I asked the food runner how long does it take to get an ice tea, he said ask your server (very rude) I watched him and he walked right by her. Meanwhile she just stood at the computer doing nothing. The pizza came and she finally brought our ice tea. I have had Corey before and she is so slow. She could careless about her job. My regret is not calling over a manager, but didn't want to make a seen. We also received mustard bottle and I have a picture. Disgusting! MANAGER PLEASE CALL ME! What is going on? If the mustard bottle us dirty what else us? VERY UNHAPPY because I love their pizza!"
Emily F.,"Hurst, TX",12,87,4,3.0,1/8/2014,"Okay, so there are going to be 2 parts to my review here.  The first part is in regards to the lousy, and I mean so lousy that we didn't leave the waiter a tip (only the 2nd time we've ever done that) service that my husband and I received when we took our family out for dinner to the RC location. First off, my husband had a few questions about the beers and our waiter told him that he wasn't even 21 yet and had never tasted any of the beers and didn't know anything about them or the prices, etc. Uhhh...okay....kinda pointless to hire a kid to sell and boost sales of beer that he can't even drink and know anything about! It's like asking a drunk to be a bartender, totally stupid.  My husband ordered a beer sampler, which the waiter mixed up (we figured it out ourselves) and took our order. The only redeeming thing that he did was change out our daughter's drink when she didn't like the first one and he did it promptly. He never delivered our food (someone else did) and it came in 2 waves: our children got their food first and then ours came almost 10 minutes later and when it arrived it was lukewarm and my burger didn't have any sauce or any lettuce/onion/tomato on it. The kid/waiter came by real quick and my hubs ordered a pint to go with his pizza, because, you know, we were at a PIZZA AND BREWERY joint.  The kid never came by again. No refills, no checking on us, no condiments as promised and no beer. What we did see the waiter doing was spending all of his time at one specific table. My husband was PISSED and I can say that he doesn't get pissed too easily; it takes some doing. We tried to flag the kid down and get his attention several times but he zoomed right past us until he finally arrived 30 minutes later and asked how everything was and my husband asked where his beer was. The kid straight up told us, ""Oh, I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it, I'll take it off the bill"" and my husband replied that it shouldn't have been on the bill in the first place because he never freaking got it. I told the kid to just give us the bill and when he did he just stood there and my husband basically told him to beat it while he looked it over.  After we got home I called and spoke to the manager on duty, Mike, and explained how dissatisfied and upset we were about spending $50 for such bad service and he was very nice and accommodating and told me that he was going to pass my info along to marketing and that they would be calling me and it would be taken care of. Well, guess what??? They never called! Big surprise there.  On to the second part of my review: I called and spoke to a different manager, Jennifer, and explained the situation to her. I was fully expecting to be passed along again like the first time but she offered to take care of the situation right then for me; she was courteous and personable and very, very nice. I told her that I would be VERY appreciative if she could somehow remedy the situation, given that the hubs and I don't go out that often and wasting $50 is a big deal to us as we aren't big spenders. She told me that she would be sending me $50 in gift cards and hoped that the incident didn't deter us from visiting the restaurant in the future. Guess what came in the mail today? That's right- $50 in gift cards.  My faith in the customer service field has been restored because of Jennifer.  Just another example that if you want to get something DONE you need to speak to a female, because, as we all know, chicks will get shit done. Yeah, I said that, too, whatcha gonna do about it? So, first review gets 1 star and the second review gets 5 stars. Add them up and average them out and you get the 3 stars. Will we go back? Of course. Do I hope Jennifer gets a raise? Definitely, because she deserves it."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,7/28/2013,"What a let down, I know chain restaurants are my least favorite place to eat at, but I am meeting up with family, a whole bunch of them and they are all not really gourmet eaters. Checking Yelp when leaving the mall and having about two seconds to plan where all of us could meet at, I remembered BJ's not being that bad for a chain. It was pretty empty which was a surprise for a 12.30 Saturday lunch, but I guess there are just so many options in the area and BJ's isn't exactly new or exciting. For starters, none of us drink so the brews are not all that enticing. The menu, a big notebook should have been the indicator that if you offer that much it can't all be good. We had the perfect beginnings, sliders and wontons to start. Meh. Nothing disgusting, nothing worth eating again. At the table we had the ribs (too soft, tasted fake and precooked) Deep dish and hand tossed pizzas (pale, too much crust, no sauce, dry, toppings cut so thin I could not taste anything on any of the 3 pizzas) I had the salmon, salty, tasted like out of a can, with couscous, which was little noodle balls, nothing grainy or healthy at all with veggies, really really bad. I wasn't paying but this wasn't even worth one dollar or calorie. We hung for awhile and I actually heard our waitress say to another one ""I'm just waiting on them to leave..."" BJ's you're right there with TJIF, Chili's and all that other straight garbage!"
Karla S.,"Montclair, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/14/2016,"Will not be coming back to this location. We were seated and waited 15 minutes for someone to notice us. When we were finally noticed we ordered our beverages and food, however 50 minutes after that our entrees were nowhere to be seen. We asked for a manager, Ron came to our table and greeted us by saying ""what's up"" (but did not introduce himself) we explained the situation, we'd been sitting there for almost an hour, we just wanted our food. He walked away and came back, at this point we just wanted to cancel our order and Ron said...""obviously this is on us [our appetizer], a little snack...""  We walked away feeling like us not receiving our food was not a big deal. I don't feel he handled the situation professionally, & sadly we will not be returning."
Frank D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,46,7,4.0,7/16/2015,"We usually go to BJ's for pizza but this last time, I tried a burger. Very tasty! Service is always good no matter who waits on us and the prices are good. Try BJ's for the pizza and burgers, stay for the games on the tv's. Always a good time!"
D R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,80,3,4.0,4/14/2015,"I am a fan!  I like BJ's food, beer, dessert, you name it.  Some of my top picks include the lemon crusted chicken, buffalo chicken pizza, Alfredo baked potato with chicken, avocado egg rolls, seared ahi tuna salad, and pizookies!  This review is for the ones in West Covina, Brea, and Rancho/Ontario, but I'm sure they're all pretty much the same."
Crystal G.,"Irvine, CA",85,25,8,2.0,8/31/2013,"Oh man I was going to write a very lengthy review of how sad, interesting, and a splash of comical my evening was here with my friends but I'm saving the hassle. Basically everything that can go wrong, went wrong with our orders for a party of 7. Our server literally cried after we showed frustration and the manager on duty was ignorant to our seating.  Come to find out it wasn't our servers fault for being so crappy tonight, it was the manager on duty, Mike, because he had this poor guy running around serving two large parties on a Friday night! When we asked to speak to Mike one more time to talk about our screwed up bill, Mike sends another manager on duty to do his dirty work.  Mike has no business in restaurant management because he obviously cannot ""manage"" the tables and has no integrity for throwing his server under the bus. On the flip side, my Tuscany chicken limone was fantastic!"
Chelsey W.,"Fontana, CA",3,76,4,5.0,4/8/2014,"BJ's is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant for special occasions. I love the food. I have my special items that I love getting. The grilled chicken pasta is TO DIE FOR. Can't find anything like this anywhere else. The pizza is AMAZING. The crust is soo good. The pizookie is great to share. There are different sizes and flavors to get their pizookies in.  Many restaurants don't do ""Call Ahead"" seating but BJs does. LOVE THIS about them. We work and get off work and rush out to dinner on our date nights and their call ahead list is very helpful for us.  The only bad thing I'd say about this place is it's pretty loud. If you want to go on a date and have a nice conversation, good luck with that because there are sports games going on around on every TV to catch your man's attention and lose track of what you're saying ;)"
Novy D.,"Puyallup, WA",688,523,1501,2.0,2/24/2012,"The break down: party of 10 dietary restrictions for several within the group spotty service no refills no check-up on our tables no apologies for food item hold-ups Our server kept ""checking in"" on our entrees so that left us all finishing off at different times; some with tabs paid, some finishing their pizookies, and other's still waiting on their entrees. Our table kept juggling between several waiters, which I believe led to the inconsistences in service. Nevermind that we made reservations and came in well before our time, but had we had a more experienced, and approachable server, would our time been that much more enjoyable."
Priscilla H.,"Hesperia, CA",0,2,3,1.0,8/18/2015,"Worst experience ever. I will never recommend this location. Took my dad here for his bday the food was cold he got and the fries were stail. The pasta tasted light jar pasta from walmart. Just horrible, the service was slow and there wasn't even alot of people. We have like 5 different services."
Richard E.,"Fontana, CA",37,29,7,3.0,8/25/2013,"I love Bjs Restaurant and Brewery.  Me and my fiance always come here to this location.  We usually enjoy their Signature drinks, Pizza and Chicken Thai Lettuce wraps.  They can do no wrong with the quality of food and drinks.  However, the experience we had last night left us Bittersweet.  First off, the hostess seemed really rude and not very friendly.  No welcome to Bjs, Hello or How are you doing Nothing.   More like what do you guys want type of attitude.  Not good for business at all.  The hostess looking very serious with a strait face said we can either wait for a table which can be a few minutes or we could find an open booth near the bar area and order from there.  My fiance and I decided to sit at the bar which was about 10 feet away from where the hostess was standing.  The table we sat at had beverages from the last party who probably just left.  I timed this. It was exactly 11:43p when we sat down.   We didn't get any recognition we even existed til about 11:57 (that was when the bus boy had just cleaned our table BTW).  He wasn't any better than the hostess.  Not a hello or nothing just came to our table looking annoyed when he was cleaning our table and left with the table still really wet.  At this point me and my fiance were debating on leaving.  Its amazing the outlook you may have of a place because of the representation by poor customer service.  The customer service was so bad I had to say something so I did to the Manager.  I let her know that the hostess seemed snooty and not very welcoming.   Look, I know were not eating at The Ritz Carlton or Morton's Steak house but still we are paying a decent amount of money.  What I think it is is that places like BJs and other places hire a lot of college kids who are stuck up and act like there better than the crummy job they have and feel a sense to bum out other people because they have to work a part time job when they have better things to do with their time.  If that's the case quit or get a job where you dont have to deal with the public.  I digress. On the Other hand the food was on point.  Just not sure if ill be coming back to this location. The 3 stars is only for the Food."
Maria T.,"Redlands, CA",10,55,14,4.0,3/29/2015,Love their food here! Our server Stephany was great! I recommend their buffalo chicken pizza. Their salted caramel and chocolate chip pizookies are really good! You will not be disappointed! The only bad thing is that their menus were really sticky and kind of hard to look around comfortably without getting your fingers sticky too.
Debbie A.,"Alta Loma, CA",3,15,3,4.0,11/11/2014,"I had a great experience. I had the lettuce wrap and the gluten free chocolate chip pazooki. It was awesome! Service was good, kept the glasses topped. I didn't give it a 5 star review, because let's be honest it's BJ's. Not really going to make you tremble with excitement at the first bite. Although that pazooki kind of did. Yum."
Richard M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",60,39,,2.0,3/26/2015,"It could be that I just got done eating at restaurants for the previous two days and had bad experiences, but we were officially over any crap that any restaurant was going to throw at us.  This may or may not be the reason why we didnt have a good experience at this location. To start with the positive and the reason why this review got 2 stars, was the food came out great and the prices were the same as any other location.  Also, we were quoted a 20min wait time, we didn't wait for any longer than 5 minutes.   Now for the negative.   We already complained about the hostess, but the hostess was about to get cussed out.  We were seated at a wet table.  Now yes, of course, the table was just cleaned.  We get it.  We asked for a towel so we could dry it off.  We didn't even ask her to dry it off for us.  She told us no and gave us an attitude.  She proceeded to put the menus down as we quickly picked them back up and had water dripping on us.  We asked again for a towel.  She told us it was wet because they just cleaned it.  NO KIDDING!  GO GET A TOWEL!!!!  She said she would go get one.  There was a third attempt in the middle somewhere but I was trying to tame my boiling temper and was too distracted.  Of course, she never came back with a towel.  Half way through the meal, the water was finally gone.  We were already annoyed.   To add to our frustration, service was SLOW!!!!  I have eaten at several different BJ's locations across Orange County, LA county, and Riverside county.  When I say slow, this was arguably the slowest location I have been to.  3 simple entrees.  A house salad, gourmet 5 meat pizza and wings with sauce on the side. Some how this took well over half an hour.   Yes it was busy but there were still empty tables.  This is no excuse.  Why is it in LA with higher population density, they can pump out food easily twice as fast as this location.   In addition, we were over it, we wanted to leave.  We had to wait an easy 20min to get our check.  We were getting ready to just walk out before the waitress brought the check. We werent happy.  The only reason why I tipped is because the waitress we had apologized for her coworkers actions.   Will not be back.  There are BJ's in any direction of this location."
Sam S.,"Taylorsville, UT",372,1260,2860,2.0,1/19/2014,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse was disappointing. Four of us ate here the other night and the food was not very good. Three of us ordered pasta and when the pasta arrived it had no sauce. We waited several minutes to flag down our server and waited even longer to finally get some sauce. The waiter explained that the cooks forget the sauce all the time, which made me wonder, what else do they forget? Won't be going back here..."
Lyssa D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/1/2016,"I have always been a huge BJ's fan but not after last night. My boyfriend had his birthday dinner there and had the mahi mahi shrimp bowl and got severe food poisoning. The service was not great either. We understood it was busy, but we much rather would have had food cooked all the way than rushed and him getting extremely sick. The waiter was not attentive to us and did not come to check on us and we ran out of our drinks multiple times. Really disappointed in the service."
Crystal C.,"Norco, CA",34,31,17,4.0,4/14/2015,Went here on Sunday brunch day and had a great time food was good and customer services was on point......
T T.,"Corona, CA",2,73,118,1.0,12/29/2015,"Where do I start... I tried calling do get information regarding their take out for large parties specifically the FULL PAN for 15-20 guests order of the Balsamic Glazed Chicken. I asked how many chickens came with the order and how it was packed for pickup. Funny how each worker had different answers. First I was told 8 chicken breasts then ranged up to 16 even after speaking to the manager. I couldn't figure how they said they serve it like they would plated at the restaurant with 2 chicken breasts.... Huh??? If that didn't make sense I asked how it was packaged for pick up and couldn't believe it was all in the same heated tray with mash potatoes, chicken, lettuce greens and fried onion strings.. I asked would they get wilted... And was told well I don't think so. So much for my ordering plans there. Sounds like no one who worked there had a clue what they were talking about let alone let me trust them with my party plans for catering.... Guess they should stick to dine in only!!!!!!!!!"
Grace C.,"Brea, CA",225,721,558,4.0,1/6/2012,"It's a BJs.  It's a chain.  Why review?  Well this was so nice inside and the service was great. I can't say enough about their home brewed sodas.  The root beer is  awesome and so is the black cherry.  I haven't tried the cream soda, but my bro had one and loved it. I don't mind their food, I'm just bummed they got rid of one of my favs - the bbq chicken sandwich.  Their menu is starting to get Cheesecake Factory size, so there is a lot to choose from, and a variety as well.  From Chili, to pizza, to pot roasts, to sandwiches and burgers.  There is plenty to choose from."
Paulette S.,"McGregor, TX",145,78,18,2.0,9/16/2013,"We will never comeback! Waited for ever to get the requested ranch and when it finally came my dinner was cold.....sent it back to get another, over cooked this te!"
