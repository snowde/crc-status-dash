Bob M.,"Colton, CA",14,31,52,5.0,3/29/2015,The service here is excellent. No matter what BJ's I have gone in I have found there food to always be so consistently good. We were promptly greeted and seated in a very reasonable amount of time. Their menu has so many great choices. We ordered one of their deep dish pizza's. Then we added a pizookies to our meal... To heaven and back.
Jay K.,"Coral Springs, FL",250,121,72,2.0,12/23/2013,"Before I start I need to say I love the beer here. I've always been a huge fan of the in-house brews.  On that note, if the beer were the only deciding factor they would get 5 stars. The service here is severely lacking. There is good beer all over. I can find good beer in my fridge.  We were seated a minute or 3 after they said we would be. Not a deal at all. What was a deal is that it took 20 minutes to see a server. We ordered beer and an app. We got the app before our beer. Then another 5 minutes for silverware. Yes, we got our appetizer before utensils. Or napkins. Or beer. Then the beer came. Then utensils. Then our water, that was on the same tray as our beers, only 4 minutes later. Like I said, service is lacking.  It got better from here. The food was good. I got a custom pizza with an off menu topping. I wanted green olives. The bar had them whole, but the kitchen isn't used to prepping anything during the dinner rush. It was done very well. I have nothing but praise for the pizza.  The GF had chicken pasta. She said it was fine. She didn't finish it. Rare.  Pazzookie was dry and meh. Ice cream tasted freezer burned.  Overall, our server was very young, and not too experienced, but he was very friendly. He knew the menu, and paid attention after he got the ball rolling.  It won't stop me from coming back, but be aware that your time is not valuable here."
Shannon S.,"Escondido, CA",503,605,187,1.0,4/3/2013,"I'm a big fan of BJ's. Sure they are a chain, but the quality and layout is consistent, and service is usually pretty great. I'm not sure what the deal is with the Rancho Cucamonga location, but they could use a refresher course in guest service. We decided to have dinner at the bar, and we both ordered a beer to start. Things were off to a typical start, until another guest came by, and picked up a napkin from the floor and set it in front of me as he proceeded to sit down next to me. I turned to the man, and a conversation ensued. Me: Gross. This isn't my napkin Him: Then why is it on the floor under your chair? Me: Probably from someone else who was dining here earlier, but the point is man, why would you pick up something from the FLOOR and put it in front of my plate? He didn't respond and the dirty napkin sat on the bar for a few minutes until a bartender took it away. While I continued my meal, I could overhear the bartenders saying they ""didn't know what the big deal was"" that the napkin was on the floor, and they continued to discuss it within earshot of me.  I want to be clear, that the other guests actions had nothing to do with BJ's, and was completely out of their control, but the way BJ's handled it was out of line. They could have apologized, or at an even basic level, they should have wiped down the bar because a dirty napkin from the floor, made its way onto my dining area. Heck, if they swept up the area after the other diners, there wouldn't have been the napkin on the floor to begin with.   Instead of handling things with style and grace, BJ's took the low road. To ad insult to injury, there was a party of six or so who was sitting in a large corner booth in the bar area. Several times, the group separated over to a second adjoining table where the guests were allowed to sit on top of the tables with their buttcracks sticking out.  It wasn't once, or twice, but over the course of an hour the ""crack situation"" seemed to dominate the two tables. Who allows this in a eating establishment!? Aside from the obvious unhygenic and unappetizing factor at play, is BJ's at all concerned about the guest becoming injured by falling off or breaking the table? Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. A word to the wise, if their dining area allows this kind of unsanitary practices, I can only imagine what goes on behind closed doors in the kitchen."
Samuel K.,"Garden Grove, CA",823,572,346,4.0,5/6/2013,"We stopped by for a quick lunch but this joint was packed at 1pm last Friday. We waited about 15 minutes. This is the nicest BJ's I've been to. The interior décor reminded me of Cheesecake Factory's and was huge. Our server was awesome. Came frequently to check on us.  I wanted a light lunch so I got their Enlightened Barbacoa tacos from their lunch menu. Only $5.99. I expected small portions and that's exactly what I got. 3 small tacos which were alright. It came with a side of black beans which I didn't care for. I tried a slice of their veggie pizza. It was so-so. The sesame chicken salad was unique but I thought the dressing was a tad too sweet. Overall, the food was 3 stars, the service 5 stars, the interior ambience and cleanliness 5 stars = 4 stars overall."
Erik T.,"Corona, CA",29,9,,3.0,7/3/2015,"The food is consistent. The service was lacking. After taking our order, our waiter was never again to been seen. Had to check with various other employees to check on our order, refill our drinks and finally went to the hostess to ask for our bill."
Stephanie G.,"Riverside, CA",1,18,7,2.0,7/2/2015,The food was great but the service made things uncomfortable. When we first sat down our waiter immediately asked us what we wanted to drink but after that he took way too long to take our order and even have our food brought out. The pizookie is my favorite thing here but I didn't get to enjoy it like usual because the cookie part was already cold when it got to us.
Kick-Ass R.,"Diamond Bar, CA",47,28,119,3.0,10/23/2011,"After having lunch/dinner at Famous Dave's, my friends and I moved on to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse located a few hundred feet from Famous Dave's, although two of us from the group couldn't make it because they had a small child to care for. I could only comment on the customer service in the bar area and my dessert. The customer service was good overall. We thought that our server was ok with our weird sense of humor until she never came back from her lunch break, left us with a different server and we were there for awhile. We don't hold grudges, so we didn't care.  There were four of us. I didn't have any drinks, one friend had one alcohol drink. For the other two friends, they had five beers between them. I think they enjoyed their drinks. I never had the red velvet pizookie before and I enjoyed it."
Craig Y.,"Torrance, CA",1159,1149,11927,3.0,6/30/2013,Came here for dinner before heading over to the improv in Ontario Mills. Like most BJ's wait time was 20-30 mins off dinner time crowd. I just got the bacon burger which was ok i really didn't care for the bun. Service was not great we had 4 different waitresses/waiters seems like each one of them were taking their breaks 1 by one they kept introducing us to a new person never had that happen before. I most likely won't be coming back here.
Monica N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/10/2015,"Been here multiple times, but will be our last. They never fail to mess up our order or give bad service (including the manager). We are usually pretty patient, but we've had enough. 1) we get our appetizers & no plates until our actual food arrives (about 15 mins), 2) my 3 yr old son spilled his apple juice & the waitress said she would bring another right out, took the manager to come bring it nearly 30 minutes later after my son was all done eating, 3) we asked for a side of Ranch dressing for my daughter's salad, I had to stop another waiter & ask for it (she finally brought the ranch when we complained 20 mins later), 4) when we tell the ""Manager"" he just laughed & said ""Sorry""!!!   Never going there again. I'd recommend going to Buca Di Beppo or Yard House."
Ji O.,"Upland, CA",1581,793,2894,3.0,4/25/2011,love their selection of beers  only happy hour menu thats decent are the mini pizzas  its only $5 but alcohols are not cheap for happy hour
Frances N.,"Philadelphia, PA",34,159,13,4.0,5/9/2013,"We were craving a pizookie and stopped in for dinner!  FOOD - 4 stars ===== Huge portions, great for sharing or individual meals--paired with nice beers. - AVOCADO EGG ROLLS were to die for. - GOURMET 5 MEAT & MEDITERRANEAN deep dish pizzas - FAMOUS PIZOOKIE (cookie pizza) for dessert w/ a glass of milk. Great ending! SERVICE - 4 stars ======== Waitress seemed pretty busy but occasionally stopped by to check on us and remained super friendly despite how overworked she probably was! ATMOSPHERE - 5 stars ============ Huge place, so don't need to make reservations.  TVs were playing some basketball game but tables were far enough away that you could still have quiet conversation. Come here for tasty food/beer/desserts, efficient service, and inappropriate jokes (""Eating out at BJ's!"") all night long."
Adriana C.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,3,4.0,6/15/2015,I love the lasagna!! It was so good and they had great service and I just loved the environment!
Sally S.,"La Verne, CA",14,12,5,5.0,3/28/2015,"It was my Birthday this past Thursday, my boyfriend and I came in for a birthday dinner. I had never been to this location and it was a very busy evening so we decided to take a booth in bar area. I must say as busy as it was our server Esteven was excellent. He constantly made sure our drinks were filled and he took all of our questions and requests with great pleasure.This is now my favorite location. We were very satisfied and very impressed with the outstanding service and will definitely be returning soon!"
Shannon M.,"Riverside, CA",142,138,108,5.0,11/15/2013,"Haven't been to BJ's in quite a while.  Offered to treat my son to lunch and BJ's was his choice and what a great choice it was!  I do not have a single complaint about our experience today.  We took advantage of the current 2 for $35 offer.  We had a side and caesar salad, the Parmesan Chicken and Half Rack of Ribs entrees and a chocolate chip Pizookie for dessert as well as an iced tea and a water.  Our bill was $40.77 before tip.   Our server was the spectacular Daniel - super friendly guy who was totally on top of every drink refill and other need we might have.  He was friendly, smiling, and very welcoming.  I have to say, all of the wait staff in our portion of the restaurant was smiling and friendly to everyone and that was really nice.  We will most definetely be going back to BJ's.  I am craving one of those yummy looking pizzas and another Pizookie!  Way to go, BJ's !!"
Alberto P.,"Riverside, CA",6,6,2,4.0,6/7/2015,Its good...great food.nice and clean..good. Prices.good for the family.celebration. priscyla graduation. Class 2015 at. bj. In rancho
Roger C.,"Alta Loma, CA",5,19,9,5.0,10/15/2014,"One of my favorite places to have dinner. I normally would have T-bone steak which has always been very good. Changed it up tonight and had pork chops which are new to the menu and were very good as well. Oh, forgot to mention the Frito and chile appetizer are the best. The parking is always tough but worth a little walk especially after dinner. I enjoy the food and atmosphere. See you next time"
Gypsii T.,"Fontana, CA",217,20,3,4.0,1/13/2016,"I absolutely love BJs. One of my fav restaurants for sure but the last two times were disappointing. Last time my friend got the chicken Alfredo and was bland and had no taste. I got the shrimp and asparagus penne and it wasn't good at all. Didn't even eat the pasta, just picked the shrimp out. I guess BJs is only good for their burgers and pizzas when it comes to food. Probably never getting another dinner entree."
Diana G.,"San Pedro, CA",53,67,1500,4.0,10/10/2013,"My first visit was a great one. Staff was really focused on customer service. Host grabbed some water for me since we had to wait and nothing was a problem. Multiple people serviced our table as well and I liked that they were responsive to my questions about ingredients due to food sensitivities. My burger was served in a lettuce bun which was awesome. Good food, solid service and a nice environment made this a good experience and I look forward to going back next time we are in town."
Micah G.,"Upland, CA",20,52,1,5.0,2/13/2015,"I love BJ's. I usually will get the ""Sweet Pig"" pizza if I order food. The pizza is very thick crust so you really have to like that style of pizza to enjoy it (almost like a casserole). Lots of beers on tap. TV's everywhere. You can't go wrong here!"
Keegan P.,"Pomona, CA",0,30,2,5.0,3/10/2014,"We called ahead since it was Saturday and the place down the street had an hour and a half wait. When we got there it was less tha ten and we got seated. All wait staff was great, best calamari I have had in YEARS. Asian salad sounded weird but was super yummy. Same with the pizza.   I will be back. Also their hefeweizen is exceptional."
