Frances S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,12,3,1.0,8/15/2014,"So disappointed. . Been coming to bj's for some time now.. BUT this visit was worth writing about. First took forever placing order for their 4 sampler beers, they were brought to us on filthy plactic mats. Yuck. Then our avocado rolls came soggy and poor tasting. Bummer when its our fav item. Yes.. there is more.. our wedge salad u ask.. came with a couple tomatoes,  a few bacon pieces. . Sad.. pizza was good.. thank goodness. . Ok now bring on dessert. . So thin only got a couple bites of cookie... lots of ice cream.. but barely any cookie.. so after thinking about our lunch date after a movie. .so so fav places.. but choose bj's. We all work hard for our money and to spend that much on a lunch and only receive a poor meal and not clean is sad. Took forever to pay our tab isn't right. Will b a very long time to pick them again when we choose to enjoy a sunday outting.."
Jess A.,"Nipomo, CA",1,5,,1.0,2/24/2016,"I usually love bjs! Good food normally friendly service but today 2/24/16 was the most disappointing service I've ever had. I took my grandma out to lunch and we picked the Rancho Cucamonga bjs, we were  seated quickly and the waitress came up after a couple minutes. She was friendly enough took our drink order then returned with the drinks and took our food order. This was at 11:29 (I checked the ticket time to see when she punched in our order) took about 20 minutes for our main course to come out. Waitress walked up right after asked how everything was and that was the last time we saw her until we got our check! At the beginning we had ordered a salad to go to take home for another family member who was working. After sitting there doing nothing for about 10 min because we had finished our food and drinks completely, the salad came out on a plate! Told the bus person it was to go and she went to fix it. At this point it's 12:15. At 12:20 when we still hadn't had our plates cleared or been offered refills nor had we been offered boxes or the check I flag down a different waitress to ask for a manager. She comes over her name is hazel and we complain about the absolute lack of service. She keeps trying to offer us drink refills which at this point we just want to leave then says she will get our boxes and check on our salad. She did not apologize at all at this point and while she did comp some of our meal she just seemed very disinterested in the issues we were having. So we get our boxes and our check and then finally after about 40 min we finally see the waitress again to collect our check and all she can say is 'sorry it's been busy' yet people who were sat about 5 min after us had already been able to leave 20 min prior. So we finally pay at 12:30 and still wait a couple more minutes for our salad. I have no idea why it took an extra 20 min to remake a salad as to go when it was their error in the first place. A very disappointing experience and it was even more embarrassing considering I was trying to treat my grandmother to a lunch out."
Harold P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,10,7,3.0,3/8/2014,It gets packed on a Friday night which is pretty  Normal I would Suggest Using the Call ahead feature Which worked fantastic for me and MY Wife On Our date night Our Server ***x Was even kind enough to reaCcomodate us to a bigger table When there is still a troll of people waiting (Use the Call ahead!) the food Was a little On the Pricey Side and could have Used a little more flavor
Elannie L.,"Upland, CA",43,23,67,3.0,1/18/2014,"This particular evening we had Jessica for our waitress. She seemed irritated by our party of eight. Drink orders were messed up, waters were forgotten, & a food order was never placed. Luckily the manager gave us free pazookie. Later we had Mark, he was a great waiter! Unfortunately, my boyfriend got food poisoning and was ill all night and day. He ate a Brew house special burger.The rest of us were fine with pizza and appetizers."
Melody G.,"Ontario, CA",336,41,31,5.0,11/4/2014,We always have great service when coming to this BJ's. It's a family favorite for us because we've NEVER been disappointed here. The food is great and service fantastic... But if you have a choice you should definitely ask for a booth instead of a table. The booths have much more room then the average and when sitting at a table you may not have as much space because of guests and servers continuously walking by. Regardless- it's an A+ restaurant!
Marlon T.,"Reno, NV",1083,2364,1516,2.0,1/4/2013,"I mean, it's just a BJ's. There's really nothing else to say if you've been to a BJ's before. It's the typical BJ's size with the typical BJ's food and beverages. I mean, it's yummy if it's your first time but not really during future visits. I would say that this is not a family restaurant but more of a place to go with friends to drink/eat when you have nowhere else to go. Furthermore, I feel that all BJ's are stingy with food--they don't even give you bread. I say go to the Lazy Dog Cafe next door, without a doubt."
Patti T.,"Ontario, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/29/2016,"I'm astounded every time I take my elderly mom to BJ's for dinner. The hosts and servers have been incredibly kind to make provisions for her increasing dementia and difficulty walking. It's one of only two restaurants where the service makes dinner not only possible, but enjoyable. David (a host) and Lex (a server) have gone above and beyond to accommodate our needs. Others have done the same on different visits. Kudos to management for selecting a superior staff and for the superb food we receive every time. That's why we go back almost every other week. The extensive menu offers plenty of options and everything we've had is top-notch!"
Samantha R.,"Wailuku, HI",2,136,35,4.0,11/9/2014,"I'll keep this pretty simple. Bjs is good for salad, pizza, and beers. They have a great selection of beers here. The service is always pretty good, but Friday and Saturday have long waits."
Sarah A.,"Rialto, CA",69,11,5,5.0,11/30/2014,"Love the bj's favorite!! Have been coming here once a month for last year or so and their pizza is always great and never lacking anything. Recently tried their blonde beer and it's in my opinion the best beer the offer. I didn't know but you can actually buy a 6 pack to take home! So I do the curbside service get my pizza, wings and beer to go! They are always so fast and very friendly have never had a negative experience."
Jim G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",14,89,41,2.0,8/24/2014,"The only reason I'm leaving 2 stars is because the food can be really good. However, the service is an absolute joke and what ever you do do NOT get Raquel for your server, slowest service I've had in along time."
Kristina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",164,62,1,5.0,10/31/2014,"I come to this location almost every Sunday during football season. I am always able to find parking (I don't mind a little walk). There is usually little to no wait if I want to be seated, but I usually go straight for a spot at the bar (thats where HH is). The waiters have always been friendly and attentive. Food comes out quickly. When I've had an issue with my food (my gf and I ordered the same salad, mine was about 1/2 her size), it was handled quickly and graciously. The crowd here is generally pretty mild for football, which is a nice change from Buffalo Wild Wings (that place turns up!)."
Juan S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,153,4,4.0,12/22/2014,It's not one of my favorite places but food is decent. I stay away from the thick crust pizza but order as you please.
Diana R.,"Fontana, CA",0,14,,4.0,4/9/2014,"Who doesnt love BJ's??? Deep dish pizzas, beer/cider, great appetizers, theres nothing not to love.  I always sit in the bar area so I have no comments on the dining room.  Foods that I suggest everyone try: Clam Chowder (in a bread bowl if you can). This has to be one of my favorite bowls of clam chowder.  I dunno what they put in it but it amazing!!! Buffalo Chicken Pizza - Add extra ranch!!! This is my favorite pizza but all of their pizzas are great.  Its all in the crust! Pazookie: This is total fat kid status but 1 per person is my suggestion.  I dont know how many times ive ordered one with a friend who says they dont want one.  Then it comes out and they devour it! Order your own!!  Berry Cider: I love their berry cider even though everyone else says its too sweet.  It's perfect for me.  The luxury of being a girl is i can order as many of these as I want and no one looks at me sideways.  Sorry guys."
Stacy F.,"Grand Island, NE",42,5,1,4.0,2/19/2015,"Had the awesome fried artichokes, cherry salmon with couscous, good food with great friends!"
Joshua L.,"Orange County, CA",361,977,93,3.0,1/17/2013,It's like all of my previous reviews of restaurants in Ontario.  Something about things just suck more than OC or LA.  I guess lack of competition...attitude?  Don't know. Our server was pretty rude and not too friendly. However my seared ahi salad was good.  The tuna was kind of overcooked but the overall dish tasted good.
Ralphie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1691,14,571,5.0,5/10/2014,"Our waitress Ashley was great . Had the calamari  and spinach artichoke for appetizers . Yummy .  We ordered a few drinks and the appetizers were at the table even though the place was packed it was a very short wait. We had a build your own pizza with pepperoni,meatballs and mushrooms . Wow it was so good all the ingredients tasted fresh . Ashley was there to check on us often . It was a great experience , only one little thing I did not like was . They serve Pepsi and I prefer chery coke . But that did not spoil anything . Overall experience was 5 stars all the way ... From the lady who greeted us , to the bartender that served us at the bar , to the lady that seated us . Everyone seemed to have great personalities . They made me feel like a king . Thank you to the entire staff. You will see me soon ...."
Cristine B.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,47,,4.0,1/27/2016,"Went here for beer and pizza. We got the spring rolls for an appetizer, very delicious but too small. Their Hefeweizen beer was amazing. We ate the spicy Hawaiian pizza it was delicious. The only issue, our waitress was slow and rude. Other then that BJs was worth it."
helene e.,"Covina, CA",63,16,,1.0,1/27/2016,Worst burger i ever had . Meat was rare and cottony pink. Yuck! I did enjoy the deep fried artichokes.
John W.,"Upland, CA",17,12,,4.0,1/6/2015,"Always a good time!  Service is excellent. The pizza and their Food is great.  The bar is busy most nights.  The beers, especially the IPAs don't taste the same as they used....but it could be me and my changing taste buds.  Would recommend this location."
Rachel K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/2/2016,BJ's Rancho Cucamonga was just an ok place to to enjoy with friends and family. The Covina location was always better.  Now I have to say that reason being is the customer service and management team lack direction  and training. Most corporate businesses take pride in these positions. Not sure what happened here. My first mistake was staying in the establishment after I was having a hard time just getting a gift card as I just arrived. Nikka was finally able to help with a card but was not very pleasant doing so. She never thanked me for the purchase.  We sat in the bar area and she happened to be our server.  I tried my best to over look her first impression. Had one and 1/2 drinks in the area. Paid our bill and started to walked to a reserved area of friends in a party of about thirty. Please don't slip and fall on the greasy wood floors because the manager was to busy doing who knows what to assist with a slip and fall form. At this time we leave  the party.  So now risk management try's to make things good with a phone call but they failed also. Do I need to say any more?
