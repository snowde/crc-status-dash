Brandie K.,"Lawndale, CA",0,1,,4.0,12/24/2015,"The food was okay, I really expected a tastier sampler platter. But all that didn't matter because the service from our waiter, Arthur was above and beyond expectation! Friendly guy, great service!"
Elizabeth P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",69,16,6,1.0,6/1/2014,"Does not respect the military!  Refused to serve my friend during military month because he wasn't in uniform, even with active ID.  Manager refused to come out & speak with us.  Called corporate, they refused to speak as well.  NEVER again for my friend , his friends, my family/friends!  This will be posted anywhere & everywhere we can .. If you don't respect the military, you don't respect America...& don't need anyone's business!!"
Rosanna P.,"Chino Hills, CA",182,25,22,3.0,9/27/2014,"Been here a couple times, they always a have a wide selection on the menu which will fit everybodys craving. 3 star rating due to the lack of service. Us and another table had not been greeted till 15 mins prior to sitting from the host informing us that our server was busy and she would get us waters. very nice host! after, we didnt get our order taken by our server for another 15 mins. He did not introduce himself or inform us after he was clocking out after taking our order. We asked if we could substitute a side for a soup and he went to ask and did not return for another 20 mins saying they couldnt. then, apparently we figured he clocked out when we saw him sitting with a table of his friends and another server informed us. worse service ever, rather go to the chino hills location"
Kasey D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/2/2016,Tonight we had a huge party of nearly 20 people and David M. handled it like a champ. Very entertaining and helpful. We got our food quickly and had a very fun environment! We loved David!
Eddie B.,"Wilsonville, NE",0,19,2,1.0,7/30/2015,"Waited OVER an hour for a table, group after group was called ahead of us. Kept being told ""oh we are waiting to clear the table"", was told initially a 20-30min wait for my party. Finally after an hour and a half I said fuck it and walked over to Famous Daves and was seated immediately. The host didn't even give a shit or try to get us to stay when we told them we were going to eat somewhere else. Absolutely shitty customer service, it's clear they don't care about keeping business, wasn't even busy, there was more than plenty of open booths and tables they could've seated us at. Host seemed for interested in bullshitting with the bartender than helping anyone who came in the door."
Caitlyn H.,"New York, NY",54,17,4,5.0,10/22/2012,Never a bad experience when I go to BJ's. Service is always good even though they are always busy. Waiters are fast and friendly. Great beer selection!  Things to try: Avocado Eggs Rolls Black and Bleu Burgers Pazookie
Rod W.,"Rialto, CA",38,16,,1.0,2/14/2015,"Went here yesterday afternoon (2:30 ish)  and ended up walking out . The place was not busy at all as we arrived during an apparent lull .( after lunch/ before happy hour).. We requested to sit on the patio but was never ever seated after waiting for approx. 15 mins in the lobby area with only one other couple ahead of us that was dining inside. Even witnessed a waiter/server accidentally drop a glass in the doorway to the patio and that broken glass stayed there for almost 5 mins , When we left that glass was still there with other servers having to step over it. Not sure why we couldn't be seated as there were only two tables on the patio being used . We were really looking forward to eating there but after waiting like that decided it was best that we go elsewhere."
Jay M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,10,,2.0,3/19/2015,"Pros:  Good environment. Very friendly servers.   Cons:  Their ""deep dish"" pizza is laughable.  The only thing deep dish was the dish it came in.  The pizza barely baked halfway to the dish.  There was more crust than ingredients/toppings.  Pathetic excuse for a deep dish.  Don't ever get it.  Little Caesars has better deep dish pizzas."
Ken S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,8,,2.0,6/22/2014,Called up after viewing a commercial about their pizzas. Ordered one with four (4) different toppings to go. Paid over $20.00 for a pizza that weighed less than the box it came in. Taste was average at best. If I go back the pizza won't be the reason.
Esther M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,33,,2.0,10/22/2014,"Now I know why they have 3.5 stars. Burger super dry and broke into three pieces and they make their mojitos with sierra mist! Manager apologized but didn't really offer to make evening better. So originally ordered hamburger, mojito, and a beer. Sent hamburger and mojito back. Paid for the beer and left.  We won't go back...too many similar   places that are a lot better."
Sean S.,"Victorville, CA",39,28,13,3.0,2/7/2014,The service was good an fast the people are nice the food was great it is a nice area I had a good time with my sisters I would come back her again
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2232,1937,4290,4.0,5/14/2010,"Came here for lunch with a few co-workers and it's a lot more spacious inside than I expected. The other BJ's I've been to in Escondido isn't as big as this one, but then again, I ate outside at the other one.  I like their lunch specials here and there's so much to choose from! It's like a better version of Cheesecake factory and Chili's put together. I had their ham and cheese grilled sandwich with the tomato basil soup. Delicious and plenty! I couldn't finish it and brought it back to the office for a late lunch later. Still delicious hours later. Great service, great place, not a fan of the slippery entrance or the annoying kids running around but parents do that to us."
Erik G.,"Monrovia, CA",31,21,,1.0,10/11/2015,"Only giving 1star because of previous visits here. Just had the worst experience ever at any BJs. Two of the people in our party got lukewarm pizzas, they somehow messed up my order in the kitchen and the order was not going to be ready until everyone else was done with their meals. After a while the dining room manager Camrielle came to talk to me, she wanted to ""make things right"" for me. So the resolution was to give the party 10% off, give me a $15 courtesy card, and comp us a couple of pizookies. We still had to pay the majority of the bill, which was about $100. You mean to tell me that BJs a major chain couldn't comp the meal to try and keep a customer? I find this hard to believe. Camrielle was very nice and I believe she did what she could but I believe that when you have a customer that is that upset you should be able to do more. I highly doubt I will ever be going to any BJs ever again after tonight."
Melissa N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",98,73,3,2.0,11/6/2015,I won't be coming back. The food is not very good. I gave it three tries and tried three different menu items and I was not satisfied each time. The service was okay. I just did not really like the food.
Sugey B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",285,67,43,4.0,12/5/2014,Great variety of food selection. I always order their blackened chicken pasta with broccoli. Always yummy!!
Lawrence R.,"Riverside, CA",11,52,28,2.0,8/10/2014,My experience at this establishment was horrible both the times I went. The costumer service is bad with the waitress we get always takes forever to attend to us. I ordered the Calamari witch was very gummy. I will not come here again.
Cathy D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",35,14,,2.0,6/2/2014,The 2 stars I give is not about the service. They were fast and friendly. I ordered a salad and eating almost 1/4 of it realized I had a bug of some sort in. I told the manager he apologized I told him I understand it happens. I received my bill and I had to remind them there was a bug in it. They were not even going to comp me the salad. Now if I had a complete problem with it and started yelling at him. He would of comp the whole meal. Managers here really need to step up there game if they want to keep customers like me.
Sally R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",16,59,1,3.0,1/8/2015,"This is a loud and vivacious restaurant with average food at a premium price.  If you want to watch the big game with your friends and enjoy a beer/food then its a great place to go. If you're looking for a quiet dinner with really good food, then you should go somewhere else.  We've been here a few times and my husband likes the beer, but the service is spotty especially when its really busy. The pizza is good, but there are many places that are better IMO.  They do have great lunch specials and you get more for your money at lunch."
Robert L.,"Wichita, KS",1,22,2,5.0,1/6/2016,"Every time I come here I have an issue.  Today was no different.  I can't stand it when people take my order correctly or fill my drink as often as needed with out me asking.  Don't like it when my table is put together properly and I hate it when my silverware looks clean and doesn't have some previous meal chives stuck to it.  How about when your waitress is nice, friendly, responsive and knowledgeable about her job and the products she serves.  Then the waitress that breaks her is just as competent.  The icing on the cake is when this general manager comes out to give me some genuine smile and hand shake and thanks me for the opportunity to assist with our search for good food. She left off warm experience."
Ana M.,"Pomona, CA",90,94,4,4.0,7/9/2014,"Doesn't everyone love BJ's?! Great food, moderate service (bar area), but the wait can be brutal! Do not come here if you turn ""hangry."""
