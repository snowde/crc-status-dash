Josue M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,15,3,1.0,10/17/2015,I was looking forward to eating at Bj's. We called ahead to see the what the wait was like because we were on a time crunch. The girl said 10-15 minutes and said we can put our name down so we did. We got there about 15 minutes later. When we checked in the at the front and we were told we were next in the list to be seated. We waited and waited and saw about 3 different couples sited before us. Honestly we were on a time crunch so I did not even bother to complain because I feel it would have been a waste of time. This is probably the 3rd time I got horrible customer service here so I don't think we will be coming back. They use to have good service. I'm not sure what happened.
T S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",26,66,11,2.0,6/26/2014,"I hate to give BJ's two stars because I love their food, however this location has the worst service.  One server took our drink order and got my drink completely wrong.  Then another server took our dinner order and they brought me the wrong entree.  The third server they assigned to our table wasn't apologetic at all.  Although I didn't ask for the manager, he stepped in and apologized which lead him comping our whole meal.  If I return, I will try sitting in a booth.  Those customer seemed to be happy & pleased."
Pratik P.,"CA, CA",21,2,1,4.0,10/2/2014,Great atmosphere. Awesome food and friendly staff. Outdoor seating was nice. Only gripe I had was crushed pepper took 10 min to get with my pizza. And also we ordered a bottle of wine took 20 min to arrive. Not sure if they were making the wine or what. Other than that loved it
Queenie M.,"Walnut, CA",14,89,120,4.0,12/19/2010,"We went here since we went to Victoria Gardens for some Black Friday shopping. I personally wasn't really hungry so I didn't really had anything in mind. We all ordered from the breakfast/brunch menu with the exception of the pizookie and appetizer.  For me, I had a side of potatoes and ham. But the waitress misunderstood me and gave me some potatoes and the tomato soup with a side of grilled cheese and ham. I told her and she apologized and quickly brought out my side of ham and let me keep the rest without being charged for it. So the service alone was 5 stars. But towards the end, I felt like she was purposely ignoring me among our group of 4. She refilled everyone's water but mine. That sort of bothered me, but not too much. In the end, we tried the red velvet pizookie which was one of the sweetest things I have ever ever ate. I preferred just eating the ice cream instead. Also, the cookie part I felt was way too thin. It should have been thicker. But still, 4 stars. Food was not bad and service was good."
Nadia A.,"Redwood Shores, CA",400,198,632,3.0,3/21/2012,"This place became my common dinner spot as in this area as there are not so many nice restaurants. I love the barmen Don, he always remembers my name and very helpful. The variety of beers is really great and the dinner menu has all types of options so you don't get bored. My favorites are: Chicken tortilla soup comes with fresh avocado and lime, which makes the flavor more interesting. Seared ahi tuna salad: be careful with wasabi souse on a side of plate, could be spicy! Overall I enjoy the place. Great combination of price, variety and service."
Daniel H.,"Riverside, CA",25,25,,4.0,7/18/2012,"Well I ordered something not on the menu, not recommended by the chef (passed to our server) I asked them to fry (not bake) their calzone... I also asked that the do the bacon cheeseburger version of pizza, in the calzone.  (I was told the variety of things, in the fryer would alter the flavor but then again I thought McDonald's French fries were bomb until the stopped fryin them with the chicken nuggets because of the tree hugging hippie liberals complained there were ingesting meat juice) But I digress...  Ladies and gentlemen, this was phenomenal. The plate itself was six stars.  The overall food (standard menu items) was sub-par to say the least (although if I shot sub-par on the course I'd be a happy man so interpret that as you'd like) Beer good Service good 4 stars with potential for 5 (need to work on the apps a bit guys)"
Cynthia J.,"Upland, CA",31,7,27,1.0,8/17/2014,"Saturday night 9ish surprisingly not too busy I placed my name on a wait list using my bjs app just in case there was a long wait. I arrive to the front desk and there were two receptionist talking, they don't acknowledge that I'm there. The two finish their conversation and then welcome us. I've been here many times and this one receptionist is not very welcoming. Anyway we wait at the top of the stairs per the rude receptionist and it takes forever for someone to come and take us to our table. (Many tables open btw) Our waitress Lilliana comes to take our drink order 10 minutes later she brings us our drinks. We ordered carnita fries as an appetizer (bad choice, don't order them) a mini pizza (dry!!!) and seared ahi salad. My bf loves the ahi salad and complained it wasn't the same. Our waitress disappears, waiting for a refill and our order. Our appetizer came with our meals. We asked again for a refill and extra dressing. Waiting.. and waiting.. nothing I finally ask another waitress to bring us our Waitress. she comes back telling us another table tried to leave without paying. At this point I was over it. I just wanted to leave. Idc about another table trying to get out of a bill. You have two regular paying customers that are getting the shitty service due to what? The wait, food, and service sucked!  I usually come Sunday evening so idk if it's because we came late is why the service was so poor but I'm very disappointed with this visit. Idk when I'll be returning."
Alex M.,"Ontario, CA",12,1,,1.0,12/15/2014,This place is usually awsome I always come here love there service and food but this day I came in was horrible my food was cold spoke to manager she made me feel like I was lying about my food being cold she made a comment saying the plate was hot so she didn't instant why the food would be cold for one I wouldn't lie about my food being cold makes no sense why I would want to wait on my food fir another 25 min my sisters food was also cold my friends steak was not cooked the way it was asked my daughters spaghetti sauce looked old not fresh I'm very disappointed I wanted to have an enjoyable dinner and was far from it this experience left me not wanting to go back to that establishment maybe it was just a bad day but manager definitely needs to be more understanding
J J.,"Riverside, CA",0,22,8,2.0,10/2/2015,Party of two for dinner at about 930 PM after hitting the Mills. Was offered open seating at the bar area. Sat at a table for nearly 20 minutes and received no service as several employees walked by. No one bothered to check on us or even made eye contact. I seen several employees standing around gossiping because I could hear them.  Just standing there talking still no service for myself and my friend. I had to grab the attention of a woman walking by and asked if they could clear a booth for us. Once we finally got a waitress I was ready to walk out but my rumbling tummy said otherwise. Three men sat at the exact table were we previously were unseen atand received attention right away. I felt discrimination due to the way we look. Staff was unfriendly and inconsistent with customer service. Food  was good I tried something different. Waited 10 minutes for a water refill. Unfortunately I didn't leave a tip. I would have liked to speak to the manager but who knows how long that would have taken! Simply will not return to this location.
Amber S.,"Atlanta, GA",25,35,1,5.0,5/17/2014,This place gets five stars for service. The food is consistent at all BJs locations. I had Parmesan crusted chicken. We had some issues with service and management made it a priority to speak with us and express concern with our server. She really seemed concerned and we left full and happy.
Matthew I.,"Fontana, CA",101,12,,2.0,8/25/2014,Food used to be really good but lately its garbarge. Service could be great but usually sucks. Food very inconsistent.
Henry J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",21,86,,3.0,11/5/2014,"Wow the avocado egg rolls are awesome, but the service is just OK.  After being at other local breweries, I'd have to say the beer is just a little above average."
Brenda I.,"San Francisco, CA",25,44,13,3.0,11/21/2012,It was a short wait and the service was great. Their deep dish pizza is so good but the chicken marsala I ordered was really mushy and looked nothing like the advertised photo. The sauce did not even have mushrooms in it.
Margarita R.,"Upland, CA",37,11,13,2.0,9/15/2015,I just had the worst experience at this restaurant . Service sucked. Worst part wasn't even full of people
Naomi R.,"Fontana, CA",26,11,46,3.0,6/14/2014,Birthday celebration! It took a while to seat us. We knew having a party of 27 would be a wait but 3 1/2hrs later... Oh well time to enjoy the birthday din din
Hannah B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",12,50,72,5.0,3/21/2014,"I usually never come here because once before my mother and I came to exchange gifts with some friends and the waiter was not all that and the food mediocre and never thought to come back , but since receiving a gift card we went today to try it again my mother and I ordered a ice tea & dr.pepper & for the main course the southern fried chicken & the blackened chicken pasta & a pazooki for dessert talk about amazing not only was the food delicious we had the sweetest waitress !!! We will be coming back soon !!!! ;)"
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,11/7/2013,"I am a glutton for punishment.  We had a business meeting at BJ's.  You are asking why BJ's again?  Well, it is very close to our place of business and usually has something for the overall attendees.  LAstly, we had some people who do drink their beer.  Myself, I never acquired the taste so I cannot provide feedback.  However as usual, i will provide feedback on the food.  I was once again floored on how something so simple can be so royally screwed up.  I ordered the BBQ Lunch platter.  The chicken was just taken from the fridge warmed and served.  It was extremely tough at all areas and had bone dry grisle around the entire piece of chicken.  Does ANYONE do any QC at this place?  Lastly, the pulled BBQ pork slider was a terrible pile of mush!  I believe your cooks cannot cook these foods to perfection due to the menu being to large.  You need to get rid of some of your dish's bring back some good ones and specialize in bringing spectacular food tot eh client at every seating.  Getting bad food, really pisses me off as well as others.  We as a culture have mad food into more than something we just consume.  This BJ's is in need of a serious undercover shopper."
Kristofor C.,"Hesperia, CA",8,7,1,3.0,8/2/2014,I used to love BJ's but today weren't as good as I have grown accustomed to. The pizza was dry and seemed like it was in the window for a long time. Also it to the servers 20 mins. to come and take our drink order. The food was good but not great.
Bee P.,"Largo, FL",76,39,,3.0,4/30/2013,"I'm never really impressed with the food or service at BJ's, but the Pizookie keeps me wanting more. For those who are clueless as to what a pizookie is: it's a pizza cookie: a gooey, hot, melty, giant cookie with a bunch of ice cream on top, served in the pan it was cooked in.. and it's AMAZING. I recently moved to the East Coast, and I miss that pizookie SO much. No restaurants here can make it correctly, if at all. (I figured out how to make my own, thankfully.)  EDIT: There is a BJs in Florida, Clearwater - and it's exactly the same.  A+ for consistency, BJs.  Back to the food and service though: It's pretty 'regular' food, pizzas, bar foods, beer... although they DO have a porkchop dish that is pretty good, imo. The service is 'regular' service as you might find at most chains, moderate to okay, but nothing spectacular. I'll keep visiting for the pizookie when I come back though, for sure."
Raleen M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",17,18,34,5.0,4/19/2014,One of my favorites!!! Avocado egg rolls are a must!!! Everything from the drinks to the food are great- they are known for their pizzas but I honestly love their small plates!! Wonderful for big parties or events!
