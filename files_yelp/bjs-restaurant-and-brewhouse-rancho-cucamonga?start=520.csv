Pop S.,"Beaumont, CA",1,42,17,1.0,11/7/2013,"Came here for my birthday and had such an awful time. People sitting by us were young as well (I would say mid 20's) The guy at the table kept passing gas in our direction and his table kept laughing. I told the waitress and she came back saying the manager is sorry she will give us pazookies... COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!! I asked the waitress to ask the manager to come to our table, when she arrived she was on the defense as if we were bothering her. She said she can not control what other people do... OK thanks lady never asked you too control anyone, however you have an unhappy guest. She then said she will remove my food from the bill since I didn't eat because I was so disgusted. Which was still unacceptable. Overall, this was a horrible experience and I wish I could rewind time and never have set foot in BJ's maybe then I could have enjoyed my birthday!"
Steve T.,"Orange County, CA",0,54,1,2.0,2/12/2014,"Food was great, service was horrible. We were seated on the patio , lots of ope tables- not busy. At first we thought our waitress forgot our salads, then we decided she must have not put our order in. Salads finally arrived, then a long wait for pizza. No apology, just I'll be right back with your....., Talk about ruining a dinner! We expect much better from BJ's. We'll be back, but won't ever sit in that server's section again."
Casey T.,"Las Vegas, NV",255,12,3,1.0,6/24/2014,"Very disappointed with service (Grecia) and the quality of food. Front desk staff was pleasant and hospitable. After being sat at table, things went down hill. Our server greet our table as we were seating down, ask about drinks, but we haven't even opened menus yet.  She came back, took drink and app order.  Came back and we ordered soup bread bowls and 2 medium deep dish pizzas. We finished our sodas & teas as apps hit the table, literally as we were just grabbing our apps, pizzas came out, then soup bread bowls came out right behind that.  No timing or courses. Eating the apps two of us grabbed a slice of pizza, it was warm. Luke warm at best.  The pan wasn't even hot. Was this sitting and dying in the window?  Drink refills? Forget about refills.  I flagged the server order and asked to have them reheated please.  She did that and brought them out.  Much better second time around.  Refills? Again reminding the server (Grecia) for refills.  She brings them back. My group of 6 still eating and commenting on service & food, mentioned desserts.  The server comes over and asked if we would like some.  We did and ordered the salted caramel pizzokie.  The dessert hits the table, our dinner & app dishes are now piled on table.  We asked server for to go box. She brings it back to us. Still doesn't pick up or pre-bus dishes, BUT, drops the check.  We pay, still left a good tip considering the precious events.  It's Karma, we are in the service industry as GM, servers & bartendar. I would definitely like to hear back from manager about this one. Will not be back to this location."
Van D.,"Upland, CA",729,1183,9365,2.0,10/15/2011,"for my little little cousin's birthday we decided to go to BJs, the wait for 10 people and four kids, 14 total was only 45 minutes. their waiting area had many chairs, so the wait wasnt too annoying or anything.  since we had 4 kids in our party, they received kiddie menus and 2 crayon packages.. .. dont they know kids want their own crayons -_- thus i had to ask for more.. which is fine, for now.. ..  we sat down and the waitress gets our drink order, but never offers us any water. some of the fams didnt even order a drink.. .. so that was a bit annoying already. anyways, she came back with our drinks and asked us if we want any appetizers. my cousin orders 2 of the best beginnings, so my aunties and uncles would have something to munch on while we wait.. .. after that our waitress comes back and gets our order.. ..  long amounts of time later, we were informed by another guy, that our waitress went on lunch and he is taking over. the poor boy is left to deal with us after that girl hella screwed up our order.. .. so basically she decided to NOT punch in our appetizers =/ and by the time this dude came around, food started to come out, so there was NO POINT. .. .. and then my cousin and aunties' custom vegetarian pizza came out with SAUSAGE.. .. and the girl who carried it out tried to convince me it wasnt.. .. and apparently the cheese only pizza for my little cousin, the birthday boy, was never punched in either.. .. ..  the manager comes and apologizes and said he'll comp SOMETHING as though that makes up for it.. .. during this time he ASSURED US the cheese pizza was in the oven blah blah blah and everything will be out soon.. .. funny cause our waiter came back right after him telling us they JUST REMADE IT -_-' by this time we were all sitting awkwardly waiting for everyone else's food cause it's rude to start first.. .. then we asked for some water, cause we were getting bored, thirsty, annoying, etc.. .. ..  a while later, everything came out.. .. this is when i try my chicken lettuce wrapps, it was horribly disgraceful =/ worst chicken lettuce wraps ever!! the one at elephant bar is cheaper and it taste better... .. cheese factory makes it better too.. i didnt feel like eating anymore.. bleh!!  so  they comped the pizza that was the vegetarian custom and gave us a huge pizzoki .. .. so thats why i put it at 2 stars and not just 1.. ... but seriously -_-' it was NOT WORTH all the trouble and frustration we felt that night.. ..  NEVER will i come back to this location.. .. i will drive to the farther one in west covina -_-' cause i never have problems with their service"
Ken B.,"The Colony, TX",26,14,2,1.0,9/28/2013,"The place was empty for lunch and hostess tells us it will be few minutes. 15 minutes later, still not seated wi our 2 kids! Left and walked to Famous Fave's where we were seated immediately! Management terrible!!!"
Wendy L.,"Riverside, CA",29,33,29,3.0,4/25/2014,"Service here is ""iffy"". The food is always good. I talked to management last week, didn't make a difference this week. I'll try another location."
Rene G.,"Ontario, CA",71,55,96,5.0,2/26/2014,"Ultimately the BEST pizza. Their normal mini pan pizza -- man, there's no words to describe the taste and crunch. The freshness and flavors from their brand is amazing.  I've never had a bad experience at this location for years. This is a place I'd say, LET'S GO AGAIN."
Kari G.,"San Mateo, CA",236,754,221,4.0,3/17/2014,"I love BJ's Restaurants. I always know what to order and get good food. This is a nice large location. It is right across the street from Ontario Mills mall. The Rancho Cucamonga address threw me, but I learned something new about the area! We came with a large group from our conference one day and a smaller group the next day. Both times we were seated immediately and our servers were great. We even found out that they delivered to our hotel! Couldn't ask for more from a big chain!"
Eddie I.,"Union City, CA",126,42,80,5.0,7/12/2014,Excellent Salmon with Avacado Egg Rolls - YUMMY
Rudy R.,"Pomona, CA",0,1,1,1.0,8/12/2015,"Bad bad experience. Apparently there was a ""problem in the kitchen"" but they kept seating people. Just about everything went wrong. 1. Took 35 minutes to get a table despite plenty of open seating. 2. Two waiters took our orders separate times because of the ""problem in the kitchen."" 3. Took 45 minutes to get our meals. 4. Had to ask several times for refills on our drinks. We did manage to get 1 refill. 5. Brought out everyone except 1 person's order. After asking several other waiters about it they ended up bringing it 20 minutes after everyone else was served (and it was in a to go bag). Poor guy just wanted to eat with the rest of us. 6. The manager refused to bring us any complimentary bread during our wait, saying that they don't have any. 7. They intermittently brought garden salads to some of us and they each had 2 pieces of bread on them. (I thought they didn't have any bread!) 8. The manager didn't offer any consolation besides not charging us a tip for our party of 9. (Great job management. Take out your problems on your own employees.) 9. Here's hoping we all don't get food poisoning."
Carol R.,"Upland, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/23/2015,Overall Service and Food Quality. Our server got our order incorrect. We told our server to not reorder our food but she insisted. She brought out the Pizza which we did not eat. We left all of the poor quality food. We also had issues getting drinks from our server. Overall it was very disappointing.
Arlene M.,"Garden Grove, CA",55,137,34,5.0,5/29/2012,"I'm giving them because they have the best service out there!  My pizza came out wrong, so the manager came up to me and asked if I'd like a salad while I waited a big for my correct order to come out.  Since I didn't want to ruin my appetite, I declined.  So, to compensate for that, they didn't charge me for my pizza.  That was just great customer service and I wanted to mention that. Food was great and the Poozokie was AWESOME!!!"
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, CA",340,547,167,4.0,4/14/2012,"went here last night for a late dinner. waited about 20 minutes to get seats. everything was good until we placed our orders (2 sourdough clam chowders) about 10 minutes after we ordered, a lady came up to us & told us they were all out. she didn't even apologize or anything just ""go ahead & pick another order"" UH OKAY, so our server comes back & he apologizes saying he's going to try to see what he can do for us. long story short, we got clam chowder BOWLS with side bread. our waiter was the nicest dude ever, his shift was over but he stuck around to make sure we got everything we needed. he even got the manager to take one of the bowls off of our receipt."
Jenni I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",246,277,40,5.0,5/22/2012,"The lunch special is amazing.  It's only about $6 for a meal that REALLY fills you up. I ended up getting a personal pizza with the oh so delicious watermelon salad (I don't remember the exact name, but it was basically watermelon with argula lettuce topped with vinegarette). I didn't think watermelon would taste good on salad but the combination is beautiful. The personal pizza made me extremely full, and of course, it was toooooo good. I just ended up getting pepperoni pizza (I wanted chicken, but it cost a bit extra and I'm a budget so... no). I'm not sure if I would recommend getting a drink unless it's happy hour. The drink I got ended up being more than my actual meal! (it was $7). But then again, we wanted to celebrate the end of the school year and so... why not? It's for celebrating purposes, right? ;) I would recommend the peachy keen to those who like sweet drinks. It is quite good. Our server was VERY helpful, nice, and attentive and we were very satisfied with our meals :) So this place deserves a 5/5 BTW, the front of the restaurant had a beautiful flower garden which is perfect for people who need a good backdrop to take pictures in front of~ you're welcome!"
Mel ?.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/12/2015,"This place used to be one of my favor places to eat but lately is getting really sloppy.  Tonight my wife and I went to grab something to eat., I ordered a BBQ bison burger and my surprise was to see the hamburger served on a dirty plate I not talking about one small residue of food the plate was filthy all over with dry food stuck on the plate. I showed the plate to the waitress and she was very surprised to see the plate how dirty it was. Also my wife ordered some chicken that it comes with black beans and rice, the chicken was not cook as the way we ordered it tasted like old chicken warmed in the microwave. Overall our food was really bad and this is not the first time that it happened.  I will tell my friends not to go to this restaurant because is getting really sloppy in the way they cook their food."
Kevin N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/11/2015,"I've never been so disappointed with my service at BJs. My waitress name was Carrie. She seemed polite at first, but worked in a very rude manor. She was disrespectful to everyone but her tables. Would smile as she walked up but frown when walking away. Maybe she thinks people don't pay attention when she's not at the table. My colleague recognized her (he says) as a manager at Eurika burger. You would think she would be great at her job if she expects the same out of her employees. The food was great. The service was not. BJs has always satisfied me. I'll keep coming back, but never will I sit with Carrie."
Colleen W.,"Long Beach, CA",16,292,,2.0,10/14/2013,We have been to plenty of BJ's restaurants.  Food is usually good and service inconsistent.  Either service is really good or really slow or they serve your entree before they serve your appetizer.  This has happened twice at another BJ's.   Anyway....back to this visit.  We were greeted and Happily seated at a table much sooner than we were told the wait would be.  So at our table we waited for a server.  We waited for our drinks.  We waited to order our food and receive our food this continued until it was time for the bill .....we waited.  Ugh!  The food was just barely at a warm temperature when it finally made it to the table.  Needless to say I will choose another Restaurant when in this area.
Jeff R.,"Murrieta, CA",15,23,13,4.0,5/20/2014,Love the German Style Kolsch Blonde. Great environment for any sporting event and always great service. Go check it out!
Mara D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,9,1,1.0,1/19/2015,Well BJ's...three strikes your out.  Last night  was the third time in a row where our visits were below par...but the 1st time I got a manager involved just to let him know what was wrong with the food...amd why I was sending it back. We ordered the bone in new york...and the shrimp scampi pasta.  The steak was unevenly cooked...lacked flavor...the baked potatoe and veggies were raw.  My husband being more patient than I (last night anyways) was ok with taking almost everything home for a nice treat for the dogs.  The scampi pasta was a big blob of like a pound of dry pasta with some shrimp thrown in.  The amount of pasta was ridiculous for 1 person...too bad it was dry and had no taste.  We can deal with food gone wrong...and it happens ..no big deal right?  When I wanted to let the manager know what was wrong with the pasta ...he didn't want to hear it...didn't want to know what was wrong with it...but basically what do you want instead.  Well to sum it up the last 3 times we have been there they have been very busy...the last 3 times the food was not up to par for the Bj's we know...and being brushed off by the manager as complainers...well that's why I'm writing this review.  The one star I had to give is for the happy hour pinot grigio was quite nice for a happy hour wine.  The server was fine...no complaints in that area...but Mr Manager..really?
DeAndra D.,"Los Angeles, CA",252,12,4,5.0,6/14/2014,Joey is an awesome server! And a great help. It was a hair in my food and he handled it quickly and the manager spoke with me about it! I do recommend dinning here with Joey
