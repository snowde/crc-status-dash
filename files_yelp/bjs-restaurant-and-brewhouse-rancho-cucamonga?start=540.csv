Quoc Bao T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",42,18,14,5.0,4/16/2014,Came here again yestersay and the food was perfect. The server was really awesome. Will definitely be back!
Adriana R.,"Manhattan, NY",372,132,18,4.0,11/25/2013,"Busy Friday night, and we were sat down in 10 minutes. We ordered wings with the sauce on the side so that gave us the option to have 2 sauces at once with crunchy wings! The steak with cheesy mashed potatos and veggies was a huge hit! Sad to say I was too full to have a Pizookie! Overall great service and great food!"
Hannah M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",102,24,3,1.0,5/1/2014,"I came here with a friend one day and we were seated in about 15 minutes. The hostess put us at a table that was in the middle of the restaurant almost all by itself. I asked to be seated somewhere else, preferably a booth. She rolled her eyes and looked extremely annoyed. I could not believe that she actually expressed these emotions to guests. She told us to wait back in the lobby, but we didn't even bother and went to Boston's instead."
Vivian H.,"Corona, CA",317,169,472,5.0,6/19/2012,"I luv BJ's! This location is always busy no matter what time of day or night. The food is always good and the customer service is great! Good lunch specials, great dinner options, happy hour, reverse happy hour, you can't go wrong with BJ's."
Brenda M.,"Mira Loma, CA",2,20,,5.0,4/26/2015,"Shannon, our server was very professional, friendly and courteous. We have never been treated like this at a BJ's restaurant..she was attentive to what we needed and instead of us requesting service; she was prompt in providing service without request. Thank you so much Shannon! You rock!"
Marvalisa V.,"Upland, CA",32,18,6,5.0,11/3/2013,Came here to watch the football games. Friendly staff! The Sunday brunch was delicious! I had the egg sandwich and my boyfriend had the breakfast pizza. The pizza was very very good! The drink specials are awesome and they let you sample drinks too. We will defiantly be back for some Sunday football and delicious food.
Anila A.,"Long Beach, CA",87,75,7,4.0,5/30/2012,"I went here with a few of my friends (birthday dinner) to try my first pizookie and it was delicious. The drinks were great too! But I just want to say the waiter James made it the best experience ever. No, this is not a troll review--I am being completely serious. My friends and I do not know him and we were never previous friends. He was a great waiter--not only was he prompt with our orders, he conversed with us, kept us entertained and was always available for help. Thank you James, you're one of a kind!"
J L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,44,2,5.0,9/3/2012,"Ran in for a quick lunch... & I was pleasantly surprised at how good the whole experience was.  Sat at the bar and ordered a pint of the brewhouse blonde.  Very good. I ordered the fish tacos (one grilled and one fried).  I was blown away at the high quality and great flavor of this dish.  Both fried and grilled have distinctly different flavors and both were wonderful. Had a pint of lightswitch lager for desert.  Perfect. Servers were attentive, friendly and quick with the condiments and drinks. They were keyed in on the whole bar and were handling a lot of people effortlessly.  They even got their side work done between customers (instead of texting or socializing like so many other palces). Food = 5 out of 5  I was thinking bar food, but this was so much better. Cleanliness = 5 out of 5 Clean everywhere.  Bathrooms were very clean. Service = 5 out of 5 Outstanding. Can't say enough. Environment = 5 out of 5  TVs in the bar were easy to see and had a nice variety of sports. Perfect lighting, and rich textures in decor.  A very comfortable place to have a meal. Great food can make up for alot of other problems, but there were no problems here. Very happy. Ill be back for sure."
Amy B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",191,43,9,2.0,10/6/2013,I've been to plenty of BJs and I love the food. The service is pretty good. However I've had some issues with larger parties I've tried to get in. For instance tonight I called to do the call ahead seating for 9 people but apparently you can only do call ahead seating for parties of up to 6. When I tried to make a reservation tonight at the Ontario location they told me they don't do same day reservations for my large party. The girl told me that my party would have to come and check in and wait for a table. She was also a tad snappy and rude. So my party of nine has to wait an hour but a party of six can call ahead? How does that make sense? Since I usually have large parties of more than 6 that means we will NEVER be eating at BJs. Screw that. Guess they don't like big parties that spend tons of money there. Silly & stupid.
Steve P.,"Fontana, CA",7,88,4,2.0,5/2/2013,"BJ's what are you thinking. So whenever I come here I get the Seared Ahi Salad.  I have probably had it 10-15 times.  So recently I get it, and the tuna was weird.  tasted bleh, and weird texture and looked funny.  I asked the waitress about it.  She was super nice, gave a quick explanation of how they changed tuna, blah blah blah.  Very shortly after manager came, gave the same explanation.  OK, fine the tuna isn't rotten, good to know.  But the fact is the tuna was changed and the new tuna sucks.  Here is my perspective, if a restaurant does not want to pay for quality ingredients, then don't put it on the menu.  Spend less time figuring out a story as to why a product sucks, and spend the time making the product not suck.  If you cant sell the product without it sucking, don't sell it.  Seems really simple to me. I do not blame the staff at the location, it was obvious to me that this a management decision, as they were all coached on how to respond.  They did respond very well, but I am not sold,  I know what raw tuna looks like, its not a rare delicacy that few have experienced.  When a company becomes blind and arrogant and will lie to me to reach their perceived goal of a bottom line, I am done with that company."
Monique R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,10,,5.0,10/25/2014,This place was a real delight..Great service our server was a very good people person. .I wish I could remember name...Perfect for family ..My kids loved the pizza ...We all left satisfied...I will definitely put this restraunt on the top of my list. ..
Bree H.,"Fullerton, CA",31,192,7,4.0,6/18/2011,"What did I like about this BJ's? + The decor, the tiles, the overall ambiance of the restaurant, each seems to have something that is their own little flair + Despite there being NO parking in the immediate lot surrounding BJs,  and a fair amount of people waiting, we were seated almost immediately. Thank goodness for those little booths for two! + If you go, ask to be seated in Christina B's section. She is fast, efficient, and you'll never have to look around wondering where she is to have your glass filled. She makes you feel important, she wants to know if everything's OK and turned out to your liking. She is on top of it. This is everything a server should be. + The ""small bites"" appetizer of Stuffed Mushroom has 8 and is enough for a group of 4! (2 each). Although I personally did not enjoy this as I do not care for mushrooms, my boyfriend devoured them and said they were great! + The ""small bites"" bruchetta IS enough for one person. I wanted to eat all four. It was appropriately priced and good quality + I like that the pizza is served on a plate. Not sure if every BJs is doing this now, but I just think it looked really nice. + BJ's favorite pizza : toppings were fresh and cooked well. YUM + Pizookie: The cookie seemed a little gooey than usual but I'm the type that prefers that. Delish. Overall solid place to eat. The only problem I have with BJs is that it can get expensive. Plan your budget appropriately. Otherwise, enjoy!"
Mo B.,"Chino, CA",17,15,10,1.0,7/25/2013,"This BJ's was ... not the best. I came here later in the night to meet some friends, and well.... the service here was not so great. Our server was having a really off day, she fail to check up on us, forgot some drinks (as we were a party of 8,) and she messed up on an order. I ordered something from their seafood menu, and well it wasn't very good. The veggies were still a little cold, and the fish tasted as if it had been pulled from the freezer. The only good thing was the desserts honestly."
Jason I.,"Norco, CA",8,127,3,2.0,6/17/2013,"I usually really like this place. The beers are always good and the food is about the same whichever one you go to. however as of late this location is starting to SUCK! It takes way to long to get drinks, the waiters/waitresses always seem to forget to bring you what you ask for(ranch, extra sauce,) don't even think about asking for parm cheese I was actually told by a waitress ""oh ok... it will be a while cause they are hard to find"" by the time she came back with the worlds smallest shaker I was already on the last bite of my already cold pizza. I was brought a side salad on one occasion even though I didn't order it. the person who brought it was like take it anyways... Sure I said. I was later charged for it! GEE Thanks! We visit this location quite a bit while at work so sometimes I have no choice but to eat here. I am now to the point where I don't leave a tip and I have actually left a note to one waiter about his service so he knows why he got no tip. On another occasion I ordered some avocado egg rolls the plate looked like it was left over egg rolls from other peoples plates. Even my coworkers said those things look pitifull, you payed how much?! haha When my calzone finally showed up, 10mins after the rest of the tables food had arrived, It was literally the size of a pizza pocket. The waitress even laughed when I asked if the rest of it was on its way... her response was, well I asked you if you wanted the calzone for 2?! The managers here need to crack the whip..."
Victoria V.,"Sandy, UT",149,99,110,5.0,12/28/2013,Bjs never ceases to satisfy me. The avocado egg rolls are the best. Stuffed mushrooms. Ahi tuna. California flat bread. Buffalo Chicken pizza. Tomato and mozzarella salad. These are just a few of my favorites. The staff is always very nice and attentive. I've had great run-ins with pretty much all of my servers. One in particular was named Anthony. He was probably the nicest server and made our dining experience so great recently. I've been to this Bjs several times and will continue to come back.
Danny S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",15,117,141,2.0,1/9/2012,"If you have customers waiting for a seat and you have over 10 tables cleaned and ready to go wouldn't let them know why you haven't seated them?  Also if people are waiting or for a table within 10 feet from you, talking about a breakup and giving advise to the bus boy isn't the most professional thing.  The Manager looked like he was up all night and needed a engery drink or something.  Thank god the waitress (Laurn) took care of us in the bar area."
Margaret C.,"Alta Loma, CA",26,48,24,3.0,6/22/2013,"This is a good place for casual lunch, watching games with friends, and even business lunches. Food is ususally good, but the last few times were bad experiences. The Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was overcooked and bland and the Ahi Tuna salad (which is one of my favorites), had bad quality tuna - it had a Freezer taste. As for the drinks, the beer was great. Pricing is OK, average price per plate runs from $16 to $22."
Jim W.,"Ontario, CA",0,47,,4.0,7/2/2015,"Had great lunch of Jambalya, service outstanding with  S. Etiene #239), but the host and hsotess was very unorganized.  We got there at 11:05 and a few people werre stitting, an few people waiting and they did take names, and the host and hostess spent have the time socializing, take one person to table, come back and talk for a while and repaet again.  Very very slow compared to normal times.  seemed a little unorganized."
Amber P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",43,15,,4.0,2/13/2015,"Came on a Thursday night and it was looking a bit packed, but my party of 3 was seated automatically which was great. We had Jessica C as our server and she was great. She had such a good atitude and even was cracking jokes with us."
Jeska G.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,2,1,5.0,6/28/2015,"If you guys come into BJ's, make sure you sit in Grecia's section! Not only is she attentive, but also on point, funny, precise, and awesome! Also, try the Hop Storm... It's phenomenal!"
