Perry K.,"Upland, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/27/2015,The salmon dish was good but the side dish (quinoa) was very salty. My wife and I had to drink a ton of water. I hope next time we go there it won't be as salty.
Steve P.,"Chapel Hill, NC",27,64,4,2.0,3/14/2012,"Recommended by co-workers for the food, but the ""meh"" description is accurate.  All around fair prices and portions.  I tried the mini-deep dish pizza which was not really deep dish but a good portion nonetheless.  Others at my table had the fish tacos and chicken parmigiana.  No complaints, but no raves either.  A nice rowdy bar crowd where you don't have to be too concerned about noise levels.   Beer selection is decent, I didn't try their BJ's brew, looking for other local beers and the selection was understandably limited."
Brandon Y.,"Denver, CO",263,125,8,3.0,3/6/2012,"So, it took me a while to stop giggling about the name of this place. Then I was able to giggle some more, and make silly jokes about it... And then more hilarity came from ordering Fish Tacos at BJs... I came here with a group of co-workers, and it was a decent place. The food was tasty, our server was very friendly and helpful, and it was a pretty good experience. The atmosphere was pretty good, but entirely too dark.  The fish tacos were tasty. The salsa with the chips is excellent, and some of my buddies had the jambalaya, and they said it was excellent. Nothing really bad to say about it, but nothing too great to say either. I would eat there again, but it's similar to other chain spots like Fox and Hound, etc"
Luis L.,"Fontana, CA",30,256,74,5.0,12/6/2013,"Went to lunch with coworkers and enjoyed every bite I took, except for the first one That burned my tongue a little (spinach dip). I had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon. It was great. I rarely eat spicy foods, but this one was just the right amount of spicy. Tastes great and washed it down with an Arnold Palmer. Service was great."
Allison M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",150,118,47,4.0,12/29/2013,Amazing pizza!! I love this place. One of my favorite restaurants. Pizza is amazing. A unique deep dish. Great selection of beers on tap and awesome happy hour prices. Highly recommend this place for pizza or anything else on their menu!
Alan V.,"Fontana, CA",56,128,11,3.0,12/27/2011,Food and beer is good but service can take a while if things get crowded as they do often.  Good for kids over 5 but the young ones can get impatient. The bar in the evening is better for an adults only outing.
Maria A.,"Duarte, CA",0,3,1,5.0,4/27/2015,First time here and I loved it. I went on my lunch break and the waiter was really helpful. The food was great definitely going back
Ayla K.,"Sheboygan, WI",56,15,1,5.0,12/16/2013,"Went for my 21st birthday. Their beer is great! I had a blonde and some mixed drinks. Their food was amazing too. They had a 2 for dinner that had a 2 appetizers, 2 meals and a dessert to share. I had chicken noodle soup, their rib eye steak (which was delicious!!!) and their famous Pizookie. It was so much food, I had to take some home. The service was great and the place was even packed."
Ray I.,"Long Beach, CA",2,6,,1.0,3/15/2014,"I placed an online order.  Received a confirmation of my order via text and email.  I went to pick up my order 30 minutes later.  When I arrived they had no record of my order.  I showed the cashier my text and my email confirmation, she didn't care.  The only suggestion was talking to the manager so they could put my order in again.  I didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes so I left.  I can't say if the food was good or bad since I didn't get any, but I can say their online ordering system is horrible."
Melanie W.,"Ontario, CA",13,28,,5.0,2/9/2014,Had an amazing lunch at bjs today. Service was great too. Our server shea was wonderful.
Kathy V.,"Riverside, CA",265,120,6,4.0,1/21/2011,"Rock climbing for hours...  Then shopping for one hour...  equals... VERY HUNGRY!  Bj's is across from the Ontario Mills Mall. Us and everyone from the mall decided to have dinner at Bjs.  After a 15minute wait (which is not too long but there was only 2 of us)... first thing I wanted was a beer.  I got the  Jeremiah Red & other half got the Amber something. =) Both delicious... but it was 9pm and I hadn't eaten since 8am.  So I was pretty tipsy after half of the beer.  Fun times.  We ordered the Bj's special pizza.  No olives. The pizza was soo good! I love the amount of butter/oil they put in their dough because it always comes out so good... I know people eat their crust! Because it is so good! Also, we got the chili giant potato! The potato was gigantic and there was lots of cheese and chili.  We devoured everything but half of the small pizza. I was too tipsy to eat more than one slice of pizza.  But it made for a delicious breakfast!  Bjs is good when you want a good beer and a good greasy pizza.  It isn't fine dining so don't come here if you are expecting that!"
Chad H.,"Ontario, CA",28,8,,3.0,5/24/2015,"Never really had great service here, and name was lost by the hostess several times. But the deep dish pizzas are fantastic, their homemade root beer is crazy good, and the GF bizookie is outstanding. We go for the food...NOT the service..."
Rudy O.,"La Verne, CA",0,17,,4.0,5/23/2015,"I recently moved to the area and was told this is my kinda place. Live music in the evening and sports showing on the many TV's inside. The food portions are large and almost everything we have ordered has been pretty good. The chilli was below par, a little greasy and way too much cheese. The servers are great, very friendly and they stay on top of everything. I am quickly becoming a regular here."
Kolin H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,20,17,3.0,12/30/2011,"Went here with the Mrs. Started with a Jeremiah Red, a red ale house brew-  always like their house offerings.  Ordered the Lettuce-wraps as an appetizer. We both enjoyed.  But here's what killed their review for me-  halfway through the wraps our main dish arrives. We were at a small 2 person booth with not a lot of room to spare. Felt immediately rushed. BAD!  NO FIVE STARS! I ordered a crispy jalapeño burger while the Mrs ordered chicken tortilla soup (w/o the tortillas). Burger had very little flavor. Was a bit let down by that.  Mrs enjoyed her soup.  So w/o the rush job I would have eeked out one more star but rushing me is not cool, BJs! All in all, the wait staff was friendly but with a lot of restaurants like this, the service was tag-teamed-  The waiter/waitress doesn't bring the food, it's another member of the staff.  In this case, the deliverer brought the food and did not care that there was no room for it or that we weren't even finished with our appetizer. Will certainly go back but the service timing was a bit of a pain."
Jay C.,"Ontario, CA",55,68,9,4.0,3/14/2011,"It is right next to Ontario Mills. I usually go there for dinner for casual occasions because it is a fun place to be with great food, pizza, and of course, beer! I LOVE their avocado spring rolls. For about $10, it's not cheap for just 3 full rolls cut into 6 half rolls. However, they stuff it with so many avocado I think it's pretty worth it. Pizzas are good. I think CPK has healthier versions of pizzas and BJ's more into strong flavors and a little greasier. One thing I don't get is the Pizookie dessert they keep pushing every time I visit them. It is vanilla ice cream on top of freshly baked giant size chocolate chip cookie. First, it's so hard to say it right without having the waiter say it first. Second, it's extremely sweet. It's like the whole thing's made out of sugar. Sorry, I just don't get this dessert. I think brownie a la mode would be a lot better than that sugary cookie."
David P.,"Claremont, CA",285,51,,3.0,1/4/2011,"BJ's has their own unique style of food and scenery, one that creates a mysterious yet welcoming place. It may have been because they were slightly busy, had some inexperienced (new) employees working, or a combination of both but the visit here was a bit uneventful despite the fact they seemed to have tried. However there are some mixtures of good and bad for this experience there First off is for our waitress, Vanessa, you did a good job but you did seem nervous do not feel so it does affect customers (I learned that the hard way at my own work place). But you were on top of things so I do give you props for that. Secondly, my family and I tried the Thai shrimp lettuce wrap and it was unmemorable. The flavor while decent did not spark a desire for me to appreciate it as an appetizer but rather more considering it as a bag of stale seasoned chips. Its still alright but not something you would like to try again. Now we come to the Pizza, I have to say it was pretty decent. the pizza was not as hot as I had hoped but it was still much more memorable than the lettuce wrap. Only problem I had was the toppings and that was not BJ's fault.* Finally the Pizookie. Sadly the cookie was not very hot either so it got really hard quickly making it a bit difficult to eat but despite that it was a success. I would recommend going to a BJ's with friends at least once in your life it really is a unique experience and a fun one. *If you want to share a pizza with others make sure the toppings compliment one another. Just because you have at least two favorite toppings does not mean they all go well together."
Susana V.,"Fontana, CA",1,7,,4.0,5/13/2014,"My family and I love going to BJ's. The avocado egg rolls are delicious, so are their pizzas.  We always end off sharing a pazookie.  yum yum yum!"
Tony R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",31,107,2,4.0,4/15/2011,"Consistently good food and a surprisingly good proprietary beer! I have been here many times in the past and I was a little alarmed when they switched to a a house brand for their main tap beer selection. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the blond and the lite beer offering. Good job BJ's! I do have to say, this location gets packed pretty much any day. Went on a Wednesday early evening and the bar was slammed and the restaurant filled within an hour."
Curt L.,"Elmhurst, IL",333,418,74,4.0,8/16/2011,BJ's is very convenient to where I stay when in Ontario CA area.  A 1 minute walk.  What more can you ask for than a large but intimate place with an extensive menu and a rockin beer selection.  This is a brewhouse....but I went with the Negro Modelo on tap.  I have a tendency not to trust brewhouse offerings.  Either they are skunky (that speaks more to the tap cleaning protocols) or have lost their effervescence.  Maybe I should re-look at this.....as brewhouses have become alot more sophisticated.  Foodwise...the menu offers whatever you like.  I had the shrimp tacos.  My only complaint here was that the shrimp was not hot (not cold but cool).  Timing issues back of house I presume.  Nice telly's also....if you wanna watch a game. NFL preseason was on as was soccer and a baseball game.  A very nice place. A little bit for everybody
Kim G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",175,853,122,5.0,2/17/2013,"5 stars for the service at the bar... The place wasnt packed for a thursday evening, but the staff was very friendly.  Food, was very good as all my BJ experiences have been."
