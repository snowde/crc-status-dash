sam P.,"Perris, CA",8,54,,4.0,5/29/2011,"Foods Consistently good, and the blonde beers are smooth. The pazookies are great! nice warm big cookie with a great vanilla scoop of ice cream on top! Gets pretty packed on some days, so get ur reservations in."
Jenny W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",89,40,23,2.0,7/6/2013,Pretty good/ok food (I would give the food 3 stars).  TOO COLD to be comfortable while eating.  I know the staff is running around but the people paying to eat there are freezing.  Makes me not want to eat there.  I'd go back if it wasn't 60 degrees inside every time.
Nia B.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,20,,3.0,12/16/2014,"Average experience, today when the appetizer was brought out, the server dropped some of my spring rolls on the table and did not even apologize. Then when I informed the manager, Shawn Mohler, he seemed nonchalant about it. I love the food but the service was just slow. Our appetizer arrived at the same time as our meal. Food great, poor service."
Breanna W.,"Rialto, CA",25,8,,1.0,1/11/2014,"Everyone always complains about the service here but I wouldn't be able to comment about it because the incompetent hostesses were never able to seat us. We were told it was going to be a 20-25 minute wait, then it was ""something happened"" and that we would be next. After another 7 parties were called we went to check on what their version of next is. We were told that our table was being cleaned and to wait at the top of the stairs. After 4 more parties and 5 more minutes went by, we left. The worst part was the manager was standing at the check in stand the whole time!"
Denise A.,"Fullerton, CA",271,46,27,3.0,11/16/2012,"One thing that really irks me when I eat out at restaurants is when it takes a ridiculous amount of time to come to my table to take my order, bring my order, bring my drinks, etc. That being said, I completely understand this place can get busy but there no reason anyone should have to wait for 30 minutes before their order gets taken. The food gets 3 stars, but the customer service here needs to step it up big time. Wont be coming here again, avoid this place if you're on a timed schedule."
Gray S.,"San Leandro, CA",0,6,,2.0,4/19/2015,"Good food, poor wait service.  It took 1 3/4 hours to finish dinner on a Sunday evening.  We had to ask for refills on iced tea drinks, and our water was never refilled.  After he left the check, it took 15-20 minutes for him to pick it up.  The waiter (T Andres) needs better training in customer service."
Nikki M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",46,48,55,4.0,9/6/2013,"I love BJ's food, pizza is great! Usually go for lunch, get a baked potato and soup or salad, so good. They defiantly need a better happy hour.  So great food but not good place for happy hour, just expect to always pay full price for drinks here."
Mhelina D.,"Colton, CA",10,104,20,5.0,10/23/2013,"It was packed but sat us fast, fast friendly service. Good lunch prices and the Barbacoa tacos with black beans were yummy and low in calories. Great server too!"
Marvin B.,"Upland, CA",192,89,17,4.0,11/22/2014,"busy location...actually busy restaurant @ most locations visited! menu is plentiful for selections, the choice of alcohol is quite diverse as well! used to visit the La Jolla location @ the 80's, then lived next to the Burbank location @ the 90's. as per previous visits @ those as well as Loma Linda location, food quality is great, hot food served @ comfortable temp. entreés also served nice & hot. nothing like the thick crust Chicago pizza!"
Asma R.,"Upland, CA",36,36,4,4.0,5/3/2013,"PIZZOKI....! Need I say more? LOL okay, so I didn't like their pizza much but maybe other stuff is better...It was my first time but the triple chocolate pizzoki was amazing!"
Jim F.,"Riverside, CA",22,83,25,3.0,1/30/2011,"Insanely busy on weekends.  Expect to wait at least 45 minutes for a table.  Here's a tip -- put your name on the list, lurk in the bar area and grab a table immediately after someone leaves.  The servers are usually quick in sending over a busboy to clean the table. The menu offers a large variety of options.  I've only been disappointed by a couple of their sandwiches.  I highly recommend the Mediterranean pizza - my only motivation for braving the crowds. I've tried most of their microbrews and I'm not impressed.  The remaining beer choices are meager.  BJ's atmosphere is chaotic so I'm ready to leave immediately after finishing my meal. If there's something specific you're craving, BJ's is usually consistent in preparation and service.  It's not the place to go if you're starving so be ready to wait."
Pretty S.,"Detroit, MI",3,55,104,4.0,7/17/2013,Went here last week with some friends and they food was great.  I got chicken lettuce wraps and my friends got burgers and pizza and they loved it.  Great place to try out.
John C.,"Ontario, CA",0,29,,5.0,3/21/2014,"I like the brews. My fav, the Tatonka stout. Not bad prices for micro brews on happy hour. I'll update when I eat something there. But for now, it's all good."
Vanessa F.,"Upland, CA",152,40,27,4.0,1/12/2013,"I always enjoy my time at any BJ's but the service at this location was fantastic ! Our server was Jill who was a complete sweetheart and very attentive. She has a very mellow personality but great people skills. We had ordered the calamari but a few minutes later, the manager (?) came to tell us that they were out and to order another appetizer on the house. Very cool. We ate the buffalo chicken pizza, Thai shrimp lettuce wraps and potato skins (instead of the calamari) - everything tasted delicious but the potato skins could have been less fried and with more toppings. After eating, the restaurant wasn't as busy but they were still open and we never felt any rush to leave. Overall, a great evening !"
Sanchez E.,"Upland, CA",0,6,,4.0,12/6/2013,"If you're a dude, feel free to walk into this restaurant wearing a completely unbuttoned dress shirt with nothing underneath. They don't seem to mind here. To avoid waiting to be seated, make your way over to the bar area and mark your territory by creepily hovering over people enjoying their meals. They will in turn leave. If I am there and see you also doing this, I will give you a slight knod. Like in Fight Club. Try the Pizookie."
Zach R.,"Gardena, CA",15,77,60,3.0,6/21/2011,Stopped by with a group of friends after doing some shopping at the Mills.  WOW!!!!!  I used to love BJs but why did  they have to put the calorie count on their menu!!!!  If you can get out of their under 1000 calories then you ordered from their 5 or so light and healthy options otherwise be prepared to hit the gym after a meal here.   Surprisingly the tilapia and the glazed pork chop dinners on the light menu at 575 calories each were better than I expected.  I love their chili and it was good again but the temperature was warm at best which needed to be corrected.  Good ole pazookies at 1000 calories a pop; not for me but the group ordered a couple and they were aiite but not worth the guilt after hahahaha!
Helen C.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,3,1,4.0,2/15/2013,"Ive always liked the food here. I ate peppered salmon and veggies for lunch today and it was really good! Their iced tea was good as well. Their service however is pretty slow and I always had to get the server's attention to be helped. Overall, it was a good experience."
Anne P.,"Pomona, CA",0,39,,1.0,1/7/2013,"I had to ask for utensils twice.  I had to ask three times for water, two times for ketchup.  We asked several times for our appetizer which still had not come by the time we were done with our entrees.  We were told by one waitress they had thrown away our ticket and added ""So, by the way, what was it that you ordered?""  Another waiter said they ""lost"" the ticket.  Finally, the appetizer arrives - meatballs with garlic toast.  They forgot the garlic toast.   The tomato soup was swimming in oil.  Why??? The manager comped the appetizer.  Pfft...not much of a compensation for a dinner we had to struggle with!  He said this is the busiest BJ's in the nation.  THAT'S NO EXCUSE!  Also, this manager made it clear from his demeaner that he was only going to speak to and pay attention to my husband - which clearly shows a lack of respect for women. Here, I'll make ya a little less busy and eat elsewhere."
Kristie G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",119,50,7,5.0,9/2/2013,"My very favorite place in Rancho! Service is fantastic, food is great, selection wonderful."
Anthony V.,"Ontario, CA",188,149,102,4.0,8/26/2013,All their beers are awesome and good well I'm beyond speechless about their food I always come here and get the avocado egg rolls they are so delic and the pizza is also very good. Bjs never has never disappointed me! Love the environment
