Justine M.,"Colton, CA",0,8,11,5.0,9/9/2017,"Always a wonderful place to eat at. We have come here for birthdays, holidays, and even a goodbye party. We have never had bad service or bad food. And the drinks are absolutely amazing"
Tara T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",8,37,6,5.0,2/27/2017,"Great service from Don the bartender always!!!!!!!!! He's dope always keeping me informed of new deals, meals and drinks to try!

Jim R.,"Youngwood, PA",3,57,18,4.0,3/27/2017,"We were given a 30 minute wait time for a table for 4 but it seems like BJ's always have huge wait times.   Fortunately, there were plenty of open seats in the bar area.  Service was outstanding and our glasses never got empty. My wife was disappointed with her wedge salad and tomato bisque but my daughter loved her BBQ chicken salad.  And of course the Pizookies are scrumptious!  Overall, the food was average but we received uncommonly good service in the bar area."
Kimquyen L.,"Orange, CA",5000,838,1490,3.0,12/19/2015,"Ahi Tuna Salad: 4 stars Very light dressing too light for the ahi tuna that I had to ask for a side of salad dressing. But the salad was very tasty & crunchy.  Salmon & quinoa (lunch menu): 2 stars Way too small of portions for this dish, not for filling at all. Very slow service: C Took us 30 minutes to be seated even with RSVPs."
Amanda W.,"Ontario, CA",20,67,11,5.0,8/29/2017,"Everything we tried was delicious! From the appetizer to the drinks all A+. We started with drinks I got their in house cider and it tasted like cherry 7up it was so good! Lol. I honestly don't remember what my husband got to drink but he really enjoyed them as well. We then got our appetizer and we ordered the spicy garlic and to our surprise they were better then bww wings , as well as much better quality of wing. We then got our main dish a pizza of course and ordered the bjs favorite and it was the best pizza I EVER had. And I am a pizza enthusiast. we were lucky enough to arrive during the night of the fight so they were having a special on their pizookie and of course we had to get one. We got the salted caramel one, absolutely delicious! I been here a few times many years ago and just thought of it as mediocre, but after last night I find myself still craving the delicious pizza"
Ammar E.,"Sacramento, CA",2,11,3,5.0,8/26/2017,"We love this place, today our server Kelle was so nice, helpful and well trained my family and I enjoyed our night."
Felicia K.,"Erick, OK",254,69,96,5.0,1/19/2017,"I almost always have good experiences with Bj's. They always have good service & the food is always great. Our waitress at this one got the umbrellas put up for us even after we moved seats from the sun. She still tried to make our experience good, which is always nice."
Jedi M.,"Riverside, CA",0,15,,5.0,7/26/2017,Grabbed some lunch with a friend and our lil babes! Our server Amanda G was great. The iPads they use is a little impersonal though.
Joana G.,"Riverside, CA",54,5,,1.0,6/23/2017,"My boyfriend and I were at Ontario mills and wanted to watch the USA vs Mexico soccer game.We decided to go to BJ's since we knew they had the game there.We got there and waited about 15 min,I then realized that people that got there after us were being seated and we were still waiting.The game had already started and we were watching while waiting to be seated.When they finally decide to seat us we ask for a table near a tv to watch the game since the bar was all packed.There was about 10 empty tables near a TV but the server told us that for ""RESTAURANT POLICY"" she could not sit us there.We then saw an empty table that was still dirty and not cleaned yet and asked if we could be seated there.The server said ""yes just give us a couple minutes to clean it"" We were like ""cool we will wait"".The server told us we had to wait on the other section were people usually wait to be seated.We watched as they cleaned the table and we thought ""ok they are now going to seat us"".We had arived at BJ's right when the game had started and it was now half time!!!!!Keep in mind that every half is 45 minutes!!!!!!45 minutes and we were still standing waiting to be seated!The table was now clean and we were trying to have patience and be understanding but common it was ridiculous!!!!We decide to approach the server and ask why we are not being seated yet since the table is clean now,she says shes ""sorry but we cant sit you there it has to do with our RESTAURANT POLICY!!!!!"" We were furious and my boyfriend says he wants to speak to the manager.Well it was obvious the manager did not GIVE A FUCK cause he never came to us!We FINALLY get seated but my boyfriend stills says he still wants to speak to him.And guess what?????HE NEVER COMES!What kind of customer service is this?????! Our waitress was the worst also!It came to a point were we didnt even know who our waitress was!We didnt even know who to ask for the check to!Different waitresses kept on bringing us our food and drinks!  BJ's has the worst customer service EVER!I will NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!"
Michael C.,"Kansas City, KS",0,12,8,4.0,7/16/2017,Meal specials are great with exceptional service. Ate at the bar and staff was helpful and friendly. But the food is just the best! I had BBQ ribs twice bothe time great. The sides are some of the best side dishes anywhere you just can't pick a bad side dish. If you like clam chowder it is a must try. Just excellent service and food...
Kristen W.,"Ontario, CA",118,14,4,1.0,6/29/2017,Horrible service and pizookie took forever to come out. Server Jillian argued with me over check.
Brianne P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",215,11,2,1.0,12/22/2016,"We ordered our sweet pig pizza without hair... I guess the server forgot to write that down.  Oh, and the wedge salad dressing tastes like mayo.  Gross! Thanks for ruining my appetite."
Joe A.,"Glendora, CA",48,3,,1.0,6/11/2017,The most disgisting food ever made. The pizza was cold. The salad was hot. They charged us for things we didnt order and the serveice was terrible
Kim A.,"Fontana, CA",0,12,3,1.0,6/13/2017,"I would like to start by saying I have enjoyed BJs for several years and this location has been excellent up until the last two visits Today was the most awful and extremely disappointing.   It was my 57th birthday and I have always enjoy their ribeye so I picked bjs for dinner.   There were 6 of us.   The appetizer came out wrong and our waiter,Thomas did not care.  Then came our meal.   One was completely cold which they took back and zapped, drying out the chicken enough to choke on.  My ribeye was well done when med was asked for, vegetables were cold, my sons burger and fries were cold, and my granddaughter didn't get her fries. What is happening at bjs?   Thomas was uncaring that we paid over $100 for our meal and it was bad.  No manager came to our table.  Once home I decided to write this review hoping the manager does something to stop this from continuing.  I would hate for bjs to become another Fridays."
Rochelle W.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,69,37,4.0,1/6/2017,"This was much better. We had coupon buy one get one free meal but ended up sharing one meal which was filling and tasty, loved parmesan chicken and deep dish ziti."
eric w.,"Covina, CA",64,67,61,1.0,6/1/2017,This place sucks.  The managers are all young kids. They don't know how to resolve any issues.   They treat the employees horrible. Really went downhill the last few months.  They are walking over quarters trying to save pennies. Used to be my favorite spot but never again
Frankie M.,"Newport Beach, CA",68,36,168,5.0,3/12/2017,"Not sure why only 3 star rating on this place. We were on a time limit as we had an 8:00 movie (Kong). We originally went to Lazy Dog but 45 min to an hour. I called BJ's and the girl was nice enough to check the bar area and said there was a spot for poor people. So we rushed on over there and sure enough we're able to get seated right away.our server, Samia was on point. He pleasant, accommodating, and tentative. I had the veggie burger with fried jalapeños. This was the bomb. We had a great time and we were out in an hour. Just in time for our movie. Thank you Samia and BJ's"
Jaime W.,"La Verne, CA",7,15,,5.0,9/13/2017,great choices of beer and great food. The service was very solid and fast. there was a little of a wait but is expected for any restaurant
Lindsay D.,"Azusa, CA",85,211,377,5.0,3/5/2017,Love the Poozokie best part about this place.  Lunch specials during the week are great.  Good food good drinks good service.
