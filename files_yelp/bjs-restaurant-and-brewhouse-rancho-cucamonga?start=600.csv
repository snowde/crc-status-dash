Heather P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",103,144,78,2.0,6/7/2013,Usually love BJ'S but today sucked!  We all had salads that looked like they used yesterday's lettuce. My boyfriend had a sandwich with fries and the fries were cold and lettuce and tomato on it was old and gross so he basically ate the turkey off of it. My pizza wasn't the same as it used to b. always get the spinach and artichoke pizza and it looked like it was just piled together and thrown in the oven. The artichokes were so big I had to cut them up. Only had a few chopped up tomatoes and sadly disappointed.  What's goin on here?  Looked forward to coming and now dunno if ill go back for awhile.
Ashley B.,"Palmdale, CA",1,6,1,1.0,10/17/2014,"Went here for happy hour, as per the menu call drinks were $4 so I ordered 2 ketel ones and soda since the definition of a call drink is to CALL the liquor you want... Turns out only certain liquors were on their call list which are not specified on the menu and I ended up having to pay $8.50 per drink!!! Why would I have paid that much when I could have gotten a cocktail off the happy hour for $5.... Ridiculous that this ""policy"" is not mentioned NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!"
Mark H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",35,7,4,1.0,11/15/2015,Went in with my family on 11-14-2105 at 6pm and was told we would have a 20 minute wait which was fine I could see the were busy. After about a hour our buzzer goes off and we are seated by the nice hostess and was told a waiter would be right with us. 15 minutes later the gal come by and takes our drink order which was a coke and cup of coffee. Another 15 minutes goes by and had to ask for our drinks. She apologizes and say she would be right back with them and to take our order. Now we are into this a hour and a half. Gave her our order which was a cheese burger and a salad for my wife. Oh and never was my coffee refilled once during this whole time. 45 minutes later our food comes am my burger and fries were cold and now I am frustrated. I take a bite of my burger and not only was it cold but it was very rare when it was to be cooked well done. I flagged my waitress downs and showed her and she say on wow that's no where near well done and said she would make me a new one and at that point I said no thank you remove it and bring me my bill. She again apologized and stated they were very short handed which I can appreciate but my lord the manager should have been out the doing damage control if that was the case because many of the other patrons were dealing with the same thing. We have ate here many times and this has been the worst unorganized time I have ever had. Sorry for the long rant but had to share my experience and not sure if I will ever return. Good luck!
Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1070,875,388,4.0,1/20/2009,"I needed a burger. Bad. RL said that they had pretty good burgers. I was down since I needed something with a bit more meaty substance than In-N-Out.  Ordered the Classic for $8, which came with a regular bun, thousand island dressing, I added cheese. It was messy enough to make it a good burger, but not so messy that you couldn't handle it. I only ate about 3/4 of it and had the crispy thin fries, which I devoured. RL got the seasoned wedge-cut, which were surprisingly good since I normally don't like steak fries.  He had the California burger, which, true to its name, was on sourdough bread and had avocado.  But what is really good is the $3 draft root beer. They make it and when they serve it to you, they don't dilute it with ice. Free refills, too! Service was good, although initially, it took a while for someone to come and take our order. And with the place not even half full, they could've seated us elsewhere, rather than right next to the 15-person LOUD birthday party."
Amber H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,7,3,2.0,1/29/2014,"I am very sad :(  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad Online through the take out  order.  I was very excited. We went to go pick up. Upon arriving It took a few minutes to receive service despite other employees watching us waiting, but the host was apologetic when he arrived. He quickly processed the order. We drove the 20 minutes home and I became very disappointed. I had requested dressing on the side and it wasn't even included :(  the salad seemed sub par.. There were chewy bits of chicken connected with fat and the onion rings seemed like they were bits left over and not whole ones in the salad usually. I feel that the host should have checked the order. I would have taken it back had I not driven 20 mins to pick it up. It seems that bjs does not take much pride in to go orders  because this was largely disappointing."
Nathan A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,32,1,2.0,6/12/2012,"I love BJ's, I mean they have everything! The Avocado egg rolls are the best!! This location is really choppy with service, I was there on Saturday and ordered the beef dip, it was cold.... I hate sending food back, but I did... They brought it back out with the same plate and meat. It just looked horrible, i asked to speak with the manager he was just too busy arranging the menus when I wanted to speak with him.... Come on guys, step it up! Low rating for service!"
Joana F.,"Fontana, CA",335,176,315,4.0,1/17/2013,"BJ's never disappoints! Great food & drinks!! I find that the wait time here is much longer than the one in San Bernardino, but this area is usually heavy populated so it's understandable."
Michelle H.,"Los Angeles, CA",766,219,325,4.0,11/8/2012,"Only went for beers are this location. Can't say Im a BJ's fan, cause I found PUBIC HAIR in my food at the GLENDALE location. So I'm just sticking with beers for now."
Vee B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",10,7,61,4.0,6/15/2011,It's a good  place to hang out with friends esp.after long day of work. I love the mini pizzas.
MeChan W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11,90,41,3.0,4/14/2011,"Great food, parking is a headache and the waiting for over an hour in front of the door shoulder to shoulder with strangers like a off beat night club sucks, and if you go in a large group it takes forever to get your food, but the pazzooki is a must, all-in-all i will visit BJs again and again.  Note: like in other comments do put your name on the wait list."
Penny L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,18,,5.0,12/26/2014,Had dinner here with a large group the other night... Our waitress Jillian did an excellent job of keeping up with us. The food was great. This is a great spot for big groups because you have so many food options. My husband hasn't shut up about how great his pizza was since then... We obviously will be back.
Kyle Z.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,74,4,2.0,9/7/2014,"This negative review is not necessarily for all BJ's restuarants, but this specific location. I have been to lots of BJ's restuarants and the service and food is usually excellent! I went to this location one time and will not return. I ordered a burger with steak fries. When I took a bite out of my burger and looked down at my plate there was a big, black hair on my fries. I was utterly appauled and was ready to vomit. I then told the manager and he offered a free desert. If I find a hair in my food, my whole meal should be comped! I am glad to say the pazooki was delicious and hair-free, but before we ordered the free desert I hesitated and thought to myself ""Great, now I get a hairy chocolate-chip cookie with hairy ice cream!"". The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because he was very apoligetic and offered us a free desert which he should, but was very nice of him and he displayed excellent customer service skills."
Grace R.,"Rosemead, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/29/2014,"Of course the food is fine, but this restaurant has the WORST and SLOWEST service. It doesn't matter if the dining room is practically empty, you still won't get waited on until you've been waiting forever and them they forget about you!"
Chasin T.,"Crestline, CA",8,162,11,4.0,12/31/2012,I actually did not like this place when it first opened but since they added their little bites menu I have totally changed my mind. The happy hour menu is cheap and good. The rootbeer is craft brewed and delicious. I still do not like the pizza but the rest of the happy hour things I have tried have been really quite good.
Jennifer G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",21,13,,4.0,4/3/2013,"I've never really been a huge fan of BJ's. There hasn't been any dish that has brought be back (other than the Pizookie) so I've only been a few times. However, my sis wanted to have her bday lunch there so we stopped in. While I have no spectacular reviews for the food, still kinda blah, our waiter was awesome! Joey took really good care of us and was super attentive. If anything, I'd definitely go back for drinks with friends."
Janice S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,39,7,1.0,11/9/2010,"I usually love BJs Restaurants, but this one, hmm not so much. I came here on a date just for a pizookie. We were told that the wait was about 20 minutes and we decided to wait it out. Our buzzer-pager-thing lit up after about 10 minutes. I noticed that the group of 4 who arrived before us were also paged at about the same time. Because they got to the counter before us, they were seated first while my date and I were left to wait at the top of the stairs. We waited there for an additional 5-7 minutes until we went back to the counter and asked the lady behind it if anyone was gonna seat us. She told us that someone would be with us in a moment.  So we waited about another 2 minutes until a hostess took her sweet ass time climbing up 4 steps and chatted a bit with her girlfriend behind the counter - the same girl who told us to wait there. Without looking at us and by simply signaling us with the menus in her hand, the hostess who heffered her way up the 4 steps told us to follow her to a booth. It took awhile to get a waitress to come take our order. Geez, we just wanted a pizookie. I understand that it was dinner time, but I didn't expect to be waiting so long throughout each step in the dining process.  We took our time once we got dessert. At the end of dinner, we paid in cash, tipped really well despite the b.s., and left because we didn't want to deal with any more staff members. We probably could have dined and dashed because that's how much we lacked consistent interaction with staff there that night.  Hope the place cleans up its act."
Kelly E.,"Anaheim, CA",146,23,27,3.0,6/18/2012,"I'm giving them 3 stars because this is probably my least favorite out of all the BJ's locations I have been to.  Everything was just ok- nothing was great, superb, or even awesome. This location is pretty dead which leads to a lot of employees just chit chatting, kind of an awkward thing when you are trying to flag them down for refills or desert. Will I come here again...probably, would I like to come here again...not really."
Brenda T.,"Ontario, CA",13,132,11,3.0,1/18/2011,BJ's is okay. I don't go often but I've not been disappointed when I have gone. The personal pizzas are tasty and the BBQ chicken salad is wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this one is okay.  I especially like the beer sampler. Good price and you get a sample of 7 of BJ's brews. Very nice.
Cynthia R.,"Upland, CA",49,21,,5.0,11/29/2010,"Bj's is one of my favorites simply because its consistent.  their food is always good, everything from their pizza, to pasta, sandwiches, baked potatoes, and salads its one of those restaurants that the only thing that will rub you wrong about this place is the ridiculous wait on the weekends.  the wait is always long but they have a service were you can call ahead and put your name on the list.  other than that 5stars on the food and drinks and priced nicely."
Karen P.,"Claremont, CA",295,148,182,4.0,4/6/2008,"I love BJ's!  ;) Ok, I'm childish enough to not get past the name often without giggling, lol, but I DO! I love the place. I love the pizza, I love the neat drinks, I love the ambiance (WAY better than the sleazy one in Covina - not the people, but the style of the place is kinda UGH), I adore the Wedge Salad and the Blue -Eyed Blonde.  The servers have always been fun and yet able to retain a professional attitude (and with my dad, who is a self-proclaimed D.O.M. i.e.; Dirty Old Man, that's damned hard at times!!). Lots of options, the quality is wonderful, the service on time and not intrusive - another quality that I adore and respect. I can't wait for a time to go again!  Oh! And they are WONDERFUL with kids. I've been lucky at both the Covina and Rancho locations. Take the kids, have a good time, enjoy yourself. It's easy at BJ's."
