Joe Q.,"San Diego, CA",80,364,161,4.0,7/21/2010,"I went here last month for the late happy hour.  It's quite a good deal. The atmosphere is great for a sports bar.  It has a large HD TV at the bar, multiple HD TVs all around and separate dining area if you feel like having a proper sit-down dinner.   I went to the bar area and took advantage of the happy hour.  It includes deep discounts on appetizers and mini pizzas in addition to drinks.  They brew their own root beer which was my favorite soda as a kid.  I'm now against high sugar content in addition to carbonation, so I keep it in moderation.  They had  a drink of one of my favorite liquors, Captain Morgan and root beer.  I had to try it.  To my surprise, it was not a good combination and I'll stick to Captain and Coke. However, the pizzas and appetizers were delicious and worth the value.  Now only if there was a good late night game going on, it would have been perfect.  I think I had a few too many drinks that night and Rachel had to drive afterwards.  I also forgot our doggie bag! I want to return during football season to see how the place is."
Barbette M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,10,1,5.0,11/14/2014,"Thursday date night, parking lot was packed but we got a seat right away without waiting. We shared the Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps and YUM YUM. 3 large spicy shrimp per each wrap, impressed! Who knew the avocado on the Chicken Club Flatbread pizza would be the star! OMG another YUM YUM!  We saved room for the Mini chocolate chip Pizookie.  Our waitress was fabulously attentive and Manager Karen took time to say hello!"
Ken E.,"Corona, CA",29,118,18,1.0,9/14/2012,"I've eaten here a few times in recent weeks and each time I do, I regret it.  The deep dish pizza might as well be a mop of oil.  It's absolute crap pizza.  I judge a place on how I feel an hour after I eat.  This place doesn't even deserve a star."
Joshua M.,"Fontana, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/5/2014,"Pizza, beer and pazookies.... What more can you ask for?! Came in last Saturday and service was very prompt. Our server was very knowledgable and gave great suggestions the whole way through from drinks to dessert. Wish I could remember his name to request when I come back!"
Yatin P.,"Gurnee, IL",25,125,28,2.0,4/4/2012,"First, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of BJ's Restaurant's. The food is quite good and how can you not love Pizookie? Bring a group of friends with you and you'll surely have a good time here.  That being said, i have been to this particular restaurant at few times now for happy hour over the last year and many more times for regular lunch/dinner and found that the food served at the bar late night is just off. I've come here for lunch and dinner with friends and sat in the regular dining area and had no issues with the food quality at all. The servers were great, food was excellent and everyone had a good time.  Jump forward to last week when me and my buddies came for happy hour (after 10pm) for a 3rd time this year and got to talking. We realized that during happy hour, the food is terrible, and the only good service is that of the host who seats you. The Avocado Eggrolls SUCK during happy hour. Usually they taste great, for some reason the 3 times we ordered them during happy hour - they were terrible every time. They were so poorly prepared and cooked once that one of my buddies complained and got the charge for it removed by the manager. The burgers are the same deal, not cooked right during happy hour it seems and they always seem to forget things inside the burger - be it grilled onions, sauce, etc. We have to keep asking for them, which brings me to my next gripe - the service. The service is fine when you order, but when a problem comes up they are quick to reflect it in their personality. Snappy remarks and quick answers is what usually happens. That kind of attitude will get you nowhere - and for that reason my friends have refused to leave any sort of tip 2 of the last 3 times we came for happy hour. Suddenly they stop coming around to fill drinks every so often and just let you sit the rest of the night so they don't have to deal with you. Sucks, because I love coming to BJ's with friends....but now I probably can't even bring up the idea of going to BJ's for happy hour unless we are all piling in my car and driving to the Chino or Moreno Valley locations.  I'm just not sure about this particular location at all. I can go to any other BJ's (as i have) and get the same great food and service i'd expect from this place. But come to this Ontario location during happy hour and they seem to not care anymore. It's not like we come rolling in right before closing either, we get in about a half hour or so after happy hour starts."
Mike B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,,5.0,8/20/2013,Stopped there on our way home to Arizona. Had a great time. The seasonal beer was nit wit. We always like to try the seasonal brews wherever we go. Was one of the best  wit beers I have had. Happy hour - tried the sliders which hit the spot. My friend is vegan so she ordered the flat bread  and said it was one of the best she ever had. Will go to bj's in Scottsdale to see if they measure up to this one in Cali
luv p.,"Upland, CA",4,87,22,5.0,5/23/2013,Great atmosphere great food and good prices ..service is great .. Call ahead so u don't have to wait for a table
Rachel Q.,"San Diego, CA",279,584,46,4.0,7/21/2010,"The fiance decided to stop being a ""yelp-fader"" and put in some reviews.. and in looking at his reviews I found that there are some places that we have gone to that I haven't reviewed yet.. Like this place.. How can I say I love BJ's without sounding perverted?  I can't.. so I guess I just gotta deal.. I do love me this place.. I can't go here and NOT get a pizookie...  Joe and I decided to hit this place for the late happy hour as a little date.. it was great.. we sat in bar area.. ate LOTS of appetizers.. and I watched Joe get beyond buzzed off of the drinks he ordered PLUS whatever I didn't finish.. This is a great place to hit up when you want to abandon your diet.. and finish it off with a pizookie to make you feel like hitting the gym the next day.. Needless to say... I know this won't be the first time Joe and I will be coming here..  :::insert shameless BJ joke here:::"
Rolena I.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",46,666,14,4.0,6/8/2008,"I've been 4 times total.  I LOVE their pizza!!!  Their food's pretty good.  (I'd go here rather than the Yard House).  The decor is nice.  It's a rather lively place.  The menu is pretty large, which is a plus for me. I'd go again."
Jorie D.,"Riverside, CA",274,14,2,1.0,5/1/2014,"If I could give zero stars I would. HANDS DOWN the worst service I've ever gotten. Elaine is the worst server. Besides her rude attitude she just doesn't talk. It was my friends birthday and she ruined her night. She took forever on our drinks and food. Everytime she came to our table she didn't say a word. We asked for sauce and it took her ten minutes to bring it out. I told her it was my friends birthday and instead of bringing it out secretly she went up to my friend and was like oh so you want a birthday pizokie? Like are you kidding you dumb person. Then she gets her pizokie it was cold. Is this real life? I told the manager and he joked it off saying it was the servers ""personality"". Then continued to joke instead of apologizing and trying to help. What a joke this place turned into, safe to say I won't be back. I'll spend my money else where on people that have some customer service."
Jeff C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",25,37,6,4.0,1/10/2013,"Good food, good service. The nachos are large and good. Great happy hour menu and prices"
Ryan L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,16,,2.0,3/16/2013,"Food was great! The service sadly was not. Once we were seated on the patio we waited 20 minutes just to be greeted by our server.. With our order in it took us another 20 mins just to get waters brought out to us. Once we finally got the food it was great as usual. Although I do regret ordering a pazookie afterwards because sadly, that took long as well. Food on par but service and time sadly, was not which makes or breaks a place based on a service industry."
Wont T.,"Chino, CA",0,9,4,2.0,10/15/2013,"I used to go to BJ's all the time.  they've changed ownership and in my opinion it's all gone downhill.  My 2 main beefs are the service & the portion sizes.  You used to get quite a bang for your buck their, but now not so much.  The beer quality is still ok.  But the service is slow.  If you want halfway decent service you need to sit in the bar area where the cocktrail waitresses are always walking by, or you can flag the bartender.  If you sit in the main restaurant, I hope you have good company because you're going to be their for a while."
Will V.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,2,4.0,3/5/2013,"I went for my 21st bday and got the Irish Rootbeer with their own rootbeer and Baileys and Guiness. It was DELICIOUS!! Super Creamy! I got a create your own pizza with bell peppers, jalapenos, and basil. But they never put the basil on the pizza. But it was still delicious!"
Jenna S.,"Ontario, CA",20,33,,4.0,6/3/2014,This is my first visit to this BJ's and I really loved the food. I had one of the lunch specials ~ soup and salad and my bf had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken sandwich. Everything was yummy but the chili was amazing as was the Caesar salad! We also tried the Southern Fried Chicken that we saw served to another table. Our waitress Tara D. was so helpful and happy to get an order to go so we could have it too! The beer taster was also cool. We will definitely be back!
Regina F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,18,,5.0,9/19/2014,"We LOVE this place!! Incredible food, atmosphere and staff!! We always have the best time and are never disappointed!! Fast seating, excellent prices and succulent food!!"
Anita L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",120,73,30,4.0,7/1/2012,Get the clam chowder and it was delicious!  Lots of clam.
Letty A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,47,5,1.0,7/26/2012,"let's see how ""short and sweet"" i can make this. ""a few minutes"" wait was at least 30 minutes (for a party of 4) drinks and appetizer ordered - no place settings in sight (until after the app platter arrived) (not our waitress) guy/'manager""? finally delivers beer, because he noticed that it ""was just sitting there"" food ordered: medium rare burger (delivered well done) fish n chips (h is happy w that) pizza of some sort (super puffy crust, small size, scant toppings; kiddo compares it to frozen pizza) shrimp scampi (smelled like ramen; in my mouth it felt like overly salted bread crumbs were sprinkled on top of the dish at the very last minute; too much angel hair, not nearly enough ""scampi"" no garlic in sight, just undercooked bread crumb taste. and staff could care less (most of the hustle was done by a gal who was not our waitress) ....... yup, not going back.  ever."
Jennifer M.,"Boise, ID",139,30,2,3.0,4/13/2012,"I always forget that this place is super noisy until I open the door. The host/hostess will take down the number of people in your party and instruct you to ""wait at the top of the stairs."" Within a few minutes, another host/hostess will come over to you and ask you to follow them, instructing you to ""watch your step."" I'm certain this is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
Joey R.,"Los Angeles, CA",388,220,71,4.0,2/10/2010,"If you wear a tie to work and this job happens to be in the Inland Empire you are guaranteed to go here for lunch. I don't fit in either of these categories but clients of mine do and this is where we do lunch. At times it really makes no sense because finding a parking spot is impossible here at lunch but the place isn't full?  A small oversight that you should make enough parking spots to fill your place but I'll get over it. The food is good, the servers are attentive, and the price point won't kill you. This is a much better alternative to the YardHouse in Rancho.  The pizza has large crust and great fresh toppings for the food department. A medium could easily feed 3-5 people depending how hungry you are. Cheeseburgers are quality and the pastas I have sampled have a great taste as well. The atmosphere here is great and relaxing and while some people will rate this place lower due to it's chain affiliation but this is where it's at in Rancho Cucamonga."
