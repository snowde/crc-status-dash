Charlene F.,"Camarillo, CA",86,103,37,1.0,12/7/2011,"if I could give less then 1 star I would!  Ok where do I even begin, such a bad experience!  I took advantage of the call ahead seating and informed them over the phone that we had a baby and would need a high chair. They gave us a wait time of 20-30 min. When we arrived and checked in about 15 min later, I reminded them party of 5 including a baby and we would breed a high chair and once again I was quoted 20-30 min.  We were finally taken to a booth that was high and I advised the guy that was seating us that we needed a high chair. he advised us that this would work with a high chair... umm the babies head wouldn't be able to even reach the table. He walked away. We advised our waiter that we couldn't sit here, we needed a high chair and he agreed that there was no way to sit a high chair at this table. Finally after they got organized they moved us to a table where we were able to use a high chair. Ok, we are starving after all of that and eager to order.  Took a while for a waiter, ordered drinks, ordered food. My sister ordered a calzone and asked if they used a lot of cheese in them or if she should order extra cheese. The waiter assured her there was plenty of cheese in the calzone. We all ordered and it took FOREVER to receive the food. We get the food, which was not up to standards. I have dined at BJ's in Oxnard and Thousand Oaks more times then I can count so I am well aware of what to expect.  My Dad's Jambalaya was just slightly warm, the potatoes served with my chicken were cold, the calzone was cheese less. She opened it up and I couldn't find any cheese. It didn't have to be filled with cheese but it needed to include cheese. Well, the waiter took forever to come check on us, and finally when he did i asked if he could have them add some cheese and just run the calzone through the oven again, he wasn't sure they could do that. He took the calzone and was gone for far to long. I finished half my dinner and was satisfied enough, i gave my sister  my plate and she finished it by the time he returned with the calzone. We didn't touch it and they of course still charged us for it.  We ordered one pizookie for the table. 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 red velvet. We got a pizookie that was 1/2 red velvet and 1/2 white chic macadamia. Come on dude!   Also, anytime our glasses were empty we had to flag someone down for refills. The waiter did not once offer refills.  It was a very disappointing experience. Next time were in Rancho Cucamonga we will be dinning somewhere else. I recommend anyone reading this to do the same."
Depeche G.,"Ontario, CA",3,25,,5.0,6/5/2012,"Omg the best meal I've had in a while! I had the Parmesan crusted chicken, mash potatoes, and broccoli....delicious! We shared a pazookie trio....yummy. Highly recommend this place"
OIivia H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",347,318,11,4.0,1/11/2010,"BJ's is my fave place to grab potato skins and pizza, but I'm ashamed to say that! With all of the great, unique, ""cool"" places to go, why does the clichéd cookie cutter BJ's always draw me back? Even on my BIRTHDAY!? I remember BJ's before it became a huge chain with a thick menu. So maybe it's the comfort of that thick pizza followed by the deliciousness of a warm pizookie, but everytime I am asked to pick a restaurant I find myself squealing BJs, with a smile! Why then 4 stars? I admit, it is overpriced for what it is. 8 bucks for a bloody mary was just annoying. Still, I'll be back, and they better have a cold Nutty Brewnette waiting!"
Junior H.,"Fontana, CA",0,26,13,4.0,5/22/2014,Went in for lunch. clam chowder is pretty good as well. Got the mini deep dish pizza and was good as well. Our waiter did take a while to get to us though.
Sharee A.,"Fontana, CA",130,197,74,4.0,1/24/2012,"Fast service, great location, FOOD amazing like always."
Carlyn B.,"Ridgecrest, CA",24,16,1,5.0,7/5/2012,"I love this place! As soon as your waitress comes to  your table order the Avocado Rolls, they do run out. The other yummy things besides the beer (come on  its a Brewhouse) is the Pizookie with ice cream. Great Pizza too!"
johanna d.,"Ontario, CA",6,2,,4.0,7/3/2010,"This is our favorite restaurant by far!!! It's a tradition to go to Bj's for any body's b-day (their deserts are the best). Their food is fantastic and the service is great! When my fiance and I get to go out on our date nights for some reason we always end up here. The bar area is a bit small but still fun enough. If you like spicy food, you have to try their  buffalo pizza... DELICIOUS!!"
William S.,"Yucaipa, CA",27,197,6,5.0,7/28/2011,"The pizza is odd with the default Roma tomato topping subbing for sauce the rest of the menu is incredible. The small bite appetizers are all great. The Caesar salad dressing is a perfect blend of tanginess and creaminess. For people on a diet, the chicken a la fresco is incredible. The 7 beer taster is good for a buzz and the service is always good. This place is definitely a favorite."
Mando M.,"Mira Loma, CA",20,29,3,4.0,4/30/2012,"Sat myself at the bar dining area. Ordered lunch portion blackened salmon with rice and veggies.. Salmon was succulent moist and flaky, veggies were perfectly steamed, soft bust still resilient and not mushy. I am very pleased. My server was Michael B. who was very attentive. Thanks for the great experience!"
Caitlin Y.,"Long Beach, CA",63,90,165,2.0,11/23/2011,"Honestly, I really like the food at BJ's. But the overall experiences I've had at this one have been completely disastrous. My most recent visit was on Nov 14 for my sister's birthday. She really wanted a pizookie. We got stuck with a new waiter and he failed at customer service. We kept having to ask other people for things. He gave my sis her root beer float, but didn't give her a straw or a spoon. He questioned her as to why she had ordered extra dressing for her cesar salad(of which of course, he wasn't the one who brought the her extra dressing). He stood right by my empty glass of strawberry lemonade and then walked away without asking if I wanted another. My friend who came with us has told him before we ordered that it was my sister's birthday, all he had to say was ""uh... okay..."". So of course while we were eating our dinner, he comes by and asks us weirdly if we saved room for dessert. My sister replied ""of course"" thinking that he was talking about her birthday one and he asked what flavor. Then when we aren't even halfway through our dinner, a regular size pizookie comes out. We are all confused and when we flagged him down to ask why we got the regular one, he gave us attitude and told us that that was the one we asked for. So then of course once we start to eat it, a birthday size one came out... but at that point my sister didn't want it. When we got the check, he had of course charged us for the regular size. Our waiter left right after giving us the check. Apparently he was having a hard night since he just got promoted. He even had one table walk out on him without paying because they were so upset with his service. The manager kept having the talk and check in with him. Luckily he was replaced with a pleasant waiter named Patrick who took care of our check, took off the pizookie because of the misunderstanding and even gave us to-go cups for our drinks. I ultimately wish he was our waiter the whole night because those 10minutes that he took over were FAR better than our original waiter. Experiences like this just make me not want to ever go back."
Rachel P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",31,6,2,5.0,8/6/2011,"I've never been disappointed by BJ's.  The food is always great and the portions are good.  The drinks are good too.  I recommend trying their beers.  I tried something new there tonight that has become my favorite drink. I love root beer soda and they have a drink called BJ's Irish Root Beer.... sooooo good! It has a couple different alcohols in it, but drinking it, you'd never tell..  Also, if you get dessert, I recommend the trio sample pizookies.. its called something like that. It's plenty and you get to try 3 different kind."
Troy A.,"Corona, CA",2,41,15,2.0,7/21/2013,"Just average today, won't be back for awhile"
Maribel M.,"Fontana, CA",32,141,4,3.0,5/10/2011,"The food is pretty good and we love the fact that they are open late. Obviously, you come to this place for the pizza, but I also like their crispy fish tacos."
jason r.,"Walnut, CA",11,55,,5.0,8/20/2011,"this place is the best for great service and great pizza in a bar setting.  i love how thick the pizza is it is definitely a deep dish.  i really like to think of myself as a beer conisure and the beer that they make here is amazing, i often will come back and order the beer platter to try them all at the same time to compare and its like 8 bucks not bad.  the food is really great and i can not complain, after a long day of snowboarding i came here with friends and ordered a pizza they didn't have and they made it for us. basically i ordered a pizza with every kind of meat they had on it and they obliged.  it was delicious and we gladly left a nice tip and ordered a few pitchers of Jeremiah red which all of my friends and i decided was the best beer from the selections they had in the platter.  this is a good location to go to as long as you can get in when it is not busy. a place this good stays busy and can be a bit noisy, but it is really cool because it has many TVs all high def playing alot of different games and other things to watch.  it is also a good place to take a date and have a few drinks and order some really good desserts.  stop by and pay homage to BJs"
Shelly F.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,,4.0,10/10/2012,Went here for dinner the other day. The pizza (deep dish) was excellent. Not the best I've had but very tasty. Appetizers ( fried rolls) were very good.  Beer selection was outstanding. Great atmosphere. Lots of games were showing. A great time in a fun place.
Bob C.,"CA, CA",132,755,415,3.0,4/24/2009,"It's really been forever and a day since I've visited BJ's.   As with most, ok...all places that I visit for the first time or revisiting after an extended break, I go overboard and order more than I should, or is healthy to do. We start the meal off with the ANGUS BEEF SLIDERS (the meat was slightly overcooked and the bun was WAAYYY too greasy, but it was not too shabby overall) and the SANTA FE SPRING ROLLS (tasty, but these puppies were much too small, the skin overpowered the flavor of the chicken and beans). For the main entree, I've always gotten something with their blackened chicken, usually it was the cajun pasta.  This go around, it was the blackened chicken sandwich.  The blackened chicken was still tasty and the sandwich wasn't bad, especially with the dipping sauce.   The one thing that is always a winner is the pizookie (freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish).  Oh, and they also draft their own root beer."
Rachelle I.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,1,1.0,8/11/2009,"SUPER BAD SERVICE.  I went during happy hour, 3 to 7, and the restaurant itself was sparse. The bar was semi-full, but I knew it would fill up fast. Even tho the place was empty, the waitress was hardly attentive. If you want Happy Hour deals, you have to sit in the bar. Without knowing this, we asked about the specials, and she said, ""Oh, you have to sit in the bar for that."" RUDE! I ordered a taster of a beer, which she brought begrudgingly, then when she returned, didn't ask if I even liked it, nor what I'd like to order to drink. She sucked big time.  Later on, when our food came, we asked not only her, but two other servers for Ranch dressing, and it took 40 minutes to get it. Oh, and when she didn't come back for our drink refills, we had to go to the bar ourselves to order another round. Then, when we got back to the table, the asst. manager or whatever that fat, white devil lady was, demanded to see all our IDs, even tho only three of us had drinks. She asked for my ID and I told her I wasn't drinking. Then she said, Okay, but don't drink any of their beers. DUH, MUTHAFUCKA! To my friend, she said, ""If that's your beer, why is that Coke sitting in front of you?"" Uh, maybe because she was also drinking a Coke? Stupid ass bitch. She was so fucking rude.  DO NOT GO HERE. BJs was NOT FUN. They discriminate if you look young (I'm 30), ethnic (we were all asian and brown), and assume you don't tip (I tip big--I used to be a server). The servers were rude, the manager is a dipshit, and the food is bleh. FUCK CHAINS!"
Jose L.,"Fontana, CA",131,258,114,4.0,2/13/2009,"""How many people actually order anchovies for toppings?""  My cousin asked. ""Well, you're actually the second group to order it tonight, but we haven't had anyone order it for about a couple months."" ""So you mean we're getting two-month old anchovies?"" ""It's stored at room temperature,"" our server (1 of 3 for the night) replies. ""Oh well.  They're always preserved in salt and oil anyway,""  I tell myself, ""Plus, they bake it so it should be okay to eat."" Anchovies, artichokes, and Italian sausages were the toppings on our large deep dish pizza.  It's nothing like real deep dish pizza from Chicago, but its buttery crust more than makes up for it and I'm definitely a fan of BJ's.  No pun intended.  Like bacon, butter makes everything better.  It kinda reminds me of that Simpson's episode where Homer's watching a commercial where they go: ""We take 18 ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich, creamery butter, then we top it off with bacon, ham, and a fried egg.  We call it 'The Good Morning Burger'.""  Homer then drools.  Mmmm...  that has bacon too.  Double the pleasure!  I was about to order a mini pizza with bacon, artichokes and basil after finishing our large.  Unfortunately, those pizzas filled me up along with their beer so I didn't get around to ordering it.  Speaking of miniature pizzas, here's their happy hour special: $1 off drafts and cocktails $2 off appetizers Half off their mini pizzas It runs from 3pm - 7pm Monday through Friday and 10pm - Closing Monday through Thursday Got that?  Their 2009 Grand Cru beer is a Belgian style beer that has powerful fruit tastes like banana and...um..fruit.. but I enjoyed it.  I think it had a higher alcohol content than the majority of BJ's beers.  Jeremiah Red is a bit bitter, but delicious and robust.  Their Nutty Brewnette is my favorite beer and has a dark, nutty, almost chocolate-y flavor.   Despite being a chain, it's one of the better places to meet up with friends and co-workers for happy hour as it has a great, relaxing vibe and with several widescreen TVs, you should always have something to talk about if the alcohol isn't doing the trick. All I have to say about their Pizookie is that other than the namesake of this establishment, the word makes me snicker to myself.  It's just a large, hot, soft, chewy, and freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with two scoops of ice cream towering atop it.  That's a load of rich, creamery butter.  Just kidding.  All snickering aside, it's as wholesome and as simple as hopscotch.  Mmmmm....  scotch......  I love scotch.  *droool*"
Mike G.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,24,7,4.0,6/2/2012,"I really enjoy the pizza, beer and the piazzokie is the bomb. Try the oatmeal pizzokie oh so good. The service is good but not all the time since they are always busy, but the food is always great."
Patrick C.,"Arcadia, CA",69,320,198,3.0,2/14/2009,"I'll start with the PROS:  The atmosphere here is really open and has really nice décor compared to other BJ's.  Very clean and very new feeling... like a booozhy BJ's.  Food and service is typical BJ's.      CONS:  The disadvantage of having high open ceilings is their brand new flat screen LCD televisions seem very small and far from view.  Because there's hardly any walls, the positioning is just not the most efficient.  I guess there's the tradeoff.  JUDGMENT DAY:  Even though we had a blast watching the Lakers beat the Celtics (GO LAKERS!), I wouldn't recommend this BJ's as the greatest place to watch sports."
