Greg S.,"Ithaca, NY",1,133,,4.0,5/30/2012,"Went to this BJ's a couple of times while in the area.  It was within walking distance of our hotel, so it made for a great nightcap spot.  We never ate here, although tried to do so at 12:30 AM the evening that we arrived, but found that they closed at midnight.  I liked the bar.  It had TV's to watch sports, and had a very good, attentive group of bartenders.  Would return here for beer (I really liked the Lightswitch Lager) or even to try the food."
Adam M.,"Fontana, CA",64,19,,4.0,6/15/2011,Who doesn't love B.J.'s? Buffalo Chicken Pizza... Mmmhhmm.
Guillermo R.,Inland Empire,22,38,27,5.0,10/4/2011,Great food! Try their beer! Place to be for weekends.
Shane R.,"Running Springs, CA",15,38,2,3.0,11/15/2011,"Well my wife had thrown a graduation party, for me graduating at ICDC college. So we 17 people for in our party, well there was another party that came after us and was seated first, was served first. Our food came an hour later and it was cold. The food was ok, the drinks were good and the server well i take it he was new...I might give it another chance.  The atmosphere was fun, i wouldnt mind going back with some friends.."
Amber M.,"Ontario, CA",2,12,6,5.0,8/14/2011,"Got food to go, because I work at a restaurant and didn't feel like sitting in one on my day off. Anyway I've recently given up gluten and got an add in the mail about all of bjs gluten free options.  When I saw that they now have a gluten free pizookie I wanted to cry I was so excited.  Their gluten free pizza is waaay better than cpks.  SO flavorful and crispy. The pizookie was also amazing and you couldnt tell the difference between it and a regular one.  i no longer feel deprived! Togo food was ready fast and the people helping were nice. bjs is pretty much always delish."
Arnel G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",152,52,7,4.0,6/26/2009,This place is good and I always go here when I want a sandwich but I love There pizza it's good but bad for my diet
Marie B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,23,3,1.0,12/31/2013,"This location has gone downhill. The food is always good, however customer service has been horrible. Really the staff just lacks common sense. We waited 20 minutes to get our silverware while our food was sitting I front of us. Four employees walked by our table and all ignored us trying to get their attention. Then when we finally get our silverware the knives were filthy. Needless to say we had to then wait again to get someone's attention to bring us new silverware and take our food back because everything was cold due to it sitting In front of us for 30 min. After reading the more recent other reviews, all reviews say about the same thing. Poor customer service. What a shame!"
Mike L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",83,1291,17,4.0,6/3/2009,Went back last week and got a chicken sandwich and it was pretty good. it was the california something chicken.  I want to like this place but i need to try something else. There is so many things on the menu that sound good
Kristopher C.,"San Diego, CA",481,411,63,4.0,4/10/2011,"tons of food and  drinks with an abundance of seating, but looking for parking can become  a discomfort. theres different dining room sections with an area set aside for private parties. tons of bar seating and 4tops with an ample amount of flatscreens to keep up with whatever games happen to be a la mode.  the hostess was polite and had my gf and i ushered to a table rather quickly for how busy they seemed to be. we came for one thing: pizza. bomb deep dish with meatza only.  cheesesticks were good too but the amount of marinara was a little depressing. 8 lengthy, stick-like globs of gooey, bread encrusted mozzarella (with that salty tang you get when you eat good fresh mozzarella di buffalo) comes out w like, 2 oz of sauce. the idea of paying for extra sauce packets came to the forefront of my thoughts. more sauce please. cesar salad was tasty. crisp romaine, crunchy croutons, the sharpness of the parmesan. definitely tasted fresh as opposed to premixed and left sitting, forever alone.. like me, as i write this review.  as long as pizzas one of the best foods in the world, ill definitely be going back for da pies"
Sam K.,"Apple Valley, CA",4,76,17,5.0,9/12/2013,"Went there on a wednesday night and the food and service was excellent.  Our server's name was Joshua W. and he was very energetic and made our family feel very welcome.  He definitely went above and beyond.  I just love it when I start ordering from the menu and the waiter or waitress says why dont you take advantage of our special which includes everything you were going to order and then some.  I know some persons just let you order and dont really care what deal youre getting or not getting.  The special that they had gave you two salads, a large pizza and a warm cookie with ice cream.  We got the dinner deal and an order of wings were a hit with our kids.  An excellent deal for a family.  I was very happy with the service and the food.  I would definitely recommend this location.  Two thumbs up!"
Pedro F.,"Ontario, CA",40,297,176,1.0,3/24/2011,"I have visited may locations, from Montebello to West Covia to Brea and Chino Hills, CA. This place just plain sucks, the service was horrible, order was incorrect and the waitress was just plain week sauce. I am not a picky person, but wow. The beer does get 5 stars though."
Henry M.,"Somerville, MA",194,56,6,4.0,4/30/2009,"Your typical moderately upscale brewhouse/restaurant. Good atmosphere, nice open space with plenty of room to move around, although I was there off-peak hours-I imagine the bar area to get crowded during the dinner rush onwards. The staff is efficient and friendly, and I was pretty impressed with the cool bartenders! The food itself is pretty tasty, they've got a huge selection to pick from (think Cheesecake Factory) and the wedge salads are tasty, if you can justify paying five bucks for a wedge of lettuce... The beers were pretty tasty, again typical of a brewhouse, but I found the cocktails to be pricey...$6.95 for a shot of Jack Daniels? Come on.  All in all, it's a pretty decent place to chill, grab some food and get tanked. That is, if you're in the vicinity, which I was. Don't expect to make any love connections, unless you're really into the middle-aged married road warrior type. His name is Bob. He sells valves. Nice guy."
Joe B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",180,67,23,4.0,10/4/2011,"I like BJ's. They have good food for being a huge chain restaurant and they also have decent beers, Jeremiah Red being my favorite. If you are looking for a unique experience from a little mom and pop diner, this is not the place to go. The pizza is decent and the Pizooki's are incredible!!!!!!!"
Christopher C.,"Arcadia, CA",1497,271,57,4.0,5/3/2008,"Decided to grab a beer and a quick snack with my homie before catching Iron Man, and BJ's was conveniently across the street from the theatre. Every BJ's Restaurant is pretty much the same, so I tend to base my reviews on how friendly the employees are and the quality of service. From the moment we walked in, the hostess up front was very friendly and had a great smile. We sat by the bar and ordered a round of Jeremiah Reds (dude, i love this beer!) and some chicken wings. Our waitress was cool too and our food and drinks came in a timely manner. Good thing too cuz we still had a movie to catch, and we finished up the wings and downed our beers with a couple of minutes to spare before the movie started. Our quick stop here at BJ's hit the spot... and IRON MAN ROCKED!!! =)"
Karla O.,"San Dimas, CA",206,104,11,4.0,12/22/2008,"The food is great, I LOVE the buffalo chicken pizza at BJ's, its always muy delicioso, no matter which location I visit! Service- not so great...=/ they are not quickest, but this particular location gets pretty busy like the one in west covina. Plus, i went on a Sunday night right before the christmas holiday so many people most likely are on vacation from work! Anyway, our waiter was friendly and apologized for the delay. Blonde is my favorite beer over here since I'm not fond of any others and I dont have a liking for dark beers... Great food, good location, good vibe. I would go visit again when I'm in the area."
Amy J.,"Long Beach, CA",12,3,,5.0,10/1/2011,Sarah M is an excellent server! Very professional and knowledgable of their gluten free menu. As well as the cross contamination prevention process in the kitchen. This is rare to find a knowledgeable server who cares enough to educated themselves. She made me feel very comfortable to eat there without the fear of getting sick from gluten. I highly recommend her and will return. The food was awesome also!
Alex R.,"Upland, CA",40,3,,1.0,7/12/2010,I like the pizza a whole lot but their severs have been rude lately the last couple of times I've visited. I usually don't complain about restaurants but it really made me not want to go back there after this recent visit. The server was impatient once I asked for water after two drinks and closed out my check before I was even done. Needless to say stayed until my date was over when we were ready to leave. If you're going to visit this location...I say next time go carryout.
DarthReviewer D.,"Olympia, WA",0,39,,4.0,9/4/2013,"Only decent pizza in town, so far. The other food is pretty good too, and their inhouse beer isn't bad. Often tho, it's so very very busy that the service and atmosphere suffers, so I usually just order take out. I don't think they have delivery, but I would be very happy if they did."
Marc P.,"Oakland, CA",50,127,21,3.0,11/30/2008,"Neither here nor there.   Typical BJ's suburban design; similar to the BJ's in Lakewood. TVs all over the place to keep an eye on sporting events while you're lunching with a friend.  ;) Beautiful mahogany furniture. They even have pagers to let you know when a table is ready!  [What in the world do you say about chain restaurants?] Showed up on the Friday-after-Thanksgiving at around 1:30, and there was no wait whatsoever.  Sign of the Depression? Perhaps.   Ample parking. It's suburbia. Worse yet: it's the Mills.  Eh."
Nancy Q.,"Fullerton, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/30/2011,"The service here was the WORST I've ever had in my life!! The coffee was cold, we asked for another cup and the server was visibly irritated. We finally got another cup and never saw our server again. An hour later, a completely different server came and literally threw the check on the table saying nothing. Never coming back here again."
