Steve D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,140,,2.0,6/14/2008,"What Brewhouse?? I'm taking away a star for actually thinking I'd fall for such bulsh*t ! BJ's has been dumbed down to just another burger/pizza chain.  Still good food, good beer brewed elsewhere, friendly staff but really the service level comes and goes (but has never been great).  These places used to be unique but now just kind of blend into the rest,,,"
Alex S.,"Corona, CA",196,77,6,3.0,10/3/2010,Came here for a pizooke dessert. Waited about 30 min to be seated. Try to avoid this place during peak hours or be prepared to wait. Otherwise just another BJ's.
Stephen E.,"Ontario, CA",1,29,,5.0,6/30/2011,"I have celiac disease, so I cannot have any gluten whatsoever. Their gluten free pizza is beyond excellent! My husband couldn't even tell the difference, and he is a pizza aficionado. It was soo good. Then we found that the offered a new menu item a gluten free pizzookie! OMG! The best gluten free dessert I have ever had! It was warm, gooey yet crispy and topped with ice cream! I seriously thought good dessert from a restaurant was impossible after my diagnosis, however bj's made it possible!"
Jason J.,"Upland, CA",37,473,96,3.0,9/16/2008,"This is one the newer restaurants that opened on the second wave restaurant row of the Ontario Mills. Personally, I like BJs.  It's not my favourite restaurant, but it's good, and they're open pretty late.  I think they're a good group of friends restaurant as they offer a wide variety of items on the menu, and it tends to lend itself easily to a variety of tastes. The price-quality-quantity ratio is decent.  In some ways, I used to feel they were expensive, but their prices have seemed to hold steady over the past couple of years as their competitors have grown more expensive. Generally speaking, the service is good.  I've had one or two questionable instances, but generally, good table service. I would recommend coming if you're getting sick of the other chains and want to try something new, or if you'd like a good restaurant that is open pretty late."
Kathy B.,"Ontario, CA",0,24,12,4.0,8/16/2013,Nice selection on menu and decent prices.  Great service.  Had the Santa Fe salad which was very good.  Husband had the fish and chips which were excellent!
Brian H.,"Bloomington, CA",0,14,,3.0,8/8/2013,"The food is always good, but the service is hit and miss.  I never know if I will get a decent waiter or not.  I've received better more consist ant service at the San Bernardino location."
Brandon A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",62,69,2,2.0,9/18/2012,"Average at it's finest.  Despite the large menu, I have yet to find anything here I really like other than the pizza which is really good.  I hadn't been to BJ's for a while and had a craving for one of their pizzas, so the fam and I headed down there for some lunch and sat in the cocktail area.  The drinks were poured well, and the pizza was great.  My wife got some flat bread club thing...and when it came all there was was a piece of flat bread, with a little ranch drizzled on it and a little bit of bacon and avocado.  It was absolutely bland and boring.  It was so bad that after a couple bites we sent it back to the kitchen.  The wife was so disappointed she wouldn't even let them replace it with something else.  Our server, who was very nice, was also very SLOW.  Refills on our beverages took forever, and simple things we asked for like a side of ranch took way longer than it should have for a restaurant that wasn't very busy at the time.  If I could have got a little better service, this place would have warranted a 3 star rating for me."
Steve P.,"New York, NY",3,71,2,2.0,5/16/2012,"I went to dinner at BJ's in March with a colleague.  Normally, a dinner I ate two months ago wouldn't stick out in my mind, but this one does and deserves a review.  Okay, so we arrive without a reservation and are told it is a 15-20 minute wait.  We go to the bar, order a drink and just as we lift our glasses the vibrator goes off.  It was about five minutes and of course, you have to settle up before you can leave the bar.  I hate that.  Know your tables folks! So...we are seated and spend some time on the very large menu. Beware any restaurant that has every kind of cuisine....they are guaranteed to not excel at anything.   At any rate, our waiter comes over and asks if we want a drink order, obviously not noticing the full beverages on the table.  We were hungry so we ordered right away.  We wanted to start with some dumplings (potstickers) then I ordered the pork chops, my friend got chicken and he got soup and I got a house salad.   After about a five minute wait, his soup arrived and my salad arrived.  No sign of the dumplings.  Okay, that's cool....we ate and we were mid-swallow when what shows up?  Dumplings?  Nah, our entrees.  So it was slide over the salad plate to make room for the entree.  So, we are now eating our soup or salad and simultaneously eating our entrees when the waiter arrives to check on us.  He sees our table, heaped with copious servings and his reaction?  ""Wow, that came out fast.""  No apology, no offer to take it back, no reaction at all.  Then came the coup de grace.  ""Let me check on those potstickers.""   Needless to say, he showed up with the dumplings about five minutes later and we ended up eating the mess all at the same time.  I really have no recollection about the food.  It was typical chain fare (Applebee's, TGIF etc) so it wasn't bad, it just wasn't memorable.   Our nuclear physicist of a waiter never even attempted to make amends for the lousy service (he could've comped us the potstickers or offered dessert).  Not being the ornery types, we just let it pass.   Probably shouldn't have since our waiter is probably still inflicting his lousy brand of service on other unsuspecting customers. I did reduce the tip slightly from my standard 20%.   The decor is typical sports bar.  The atmosphere is loud.  The place was packed and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Americans are increasingly willing to accept mediocrity.  Oh well, we REALLY should have made a stink."
Gerald S.,"Chino Hills, CA",90,617,80,4.0,2/18/2008,"Only came here because we had a gift card to use.  There's always some sort of curiosity every time a restaurant makes their own beer.  I've had their beers before and I've always found their beers to be on the dark side and a little too stout for my taste. As for the food, it's slightly above average.  I ordered their full rack of ribs and although that may have been a mistake on my part (for ordering them from a place that specializes in burgers in my opinion), it's not bad.  It's not great either though.  I've had better ribs from quite a few other places.  Patty ordered the honey chicken crisp salad and it's quite good. The service was very good and that's what really made the experience great.  Although the salad was missing corn, they went totally out of their way to bring us corn, not to mention another salad.  Because P was almost done w/ the salad when they did this, the manager said that he would just pack the salad for us to take home. Just be sure to get there before 7pm or you'll have to wait a looooong time for seating for the weekdays."
Ana V.,"Ontario, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2013,Very bad service. The food quality has decline.The stablishment is poorly managed and it does not compare to the BJ'S service I am use to. Corporate should keep an eye on this location it's dragging its name through the mud.
Cindy R.,"Chicago, IL",37,235,,4.0,4/8/2008,"I thought the bruschetta and the roasted chicken were very good. Those in the party who had their beers highly recommended them. this place is BUSY at night and even at lunch! Good place to watch a game or hang out with friends, it was a go-to location during my business trip to the lovely inland empire."
K C.,"Glendora, CA",4,23,,2.0,8/27/2010,"I was inspired to write this only because I had far better experiences at this chain elsewhere. BJ's as a restaurant is definitely one of my favorites, but this location lacks the service that I loved so much  at other locations.  One had experience was ordering the hummus dip plate; it came by itself. Nothing to dip in it! When we notified our server, it wasn't until we needed to leave (I get a 1 hour lunch break) that the flat bread came...if you can call it that. What we got were 4 small slices of 1/4 a corn tortilla. The taste was pure charcoal. I do not recommend this plate, even for the easy $3 it cost me.  The stuffed mushrooms are exceptional, especially for the price. Their $2-$4 appetizer options are the best idea I've yet encountered in one of these ""bar & grill""-style places. The kettle chips are also to die for. The serving is huge--one of the long white plates piled high--and it comes with ranch and a ""buffalo-meets-ranch"" sauce (my fave). They are covered in parmesan sprinkles. Brushetta is also great, though next time I may have them hold the vinegrette (these bad boys are very flavorful!). You get 4 bread wedges piled with bruschetta and a pesto dipping sauce. I recommend a snake bite as it's only $3 at lunch (cider+guiness) or the Jeremiah Red if you like that flavor. The Beer Sampler is the coolest thing yet, esp if you're into the flavors of different brews. Low buget? Get the soup & salad/sandwich options. They're endless and very good, wide selection.  Baked potatoes are a great healthy alternative as all toppings are on the side. Chili bowl is a HIGH recommendation for anyone! Bar is great, hopefully you get a good bartender, but stay away from the cheap wines, you WILL get what you pay for :p"
marcus c.,"Ontario, CA",1,28,1,1.0,6/21/2009,"I HATE THIS BJ's! I was given the worst service on the face of this planet on numerous occasions. I know what your wondering, what is the worst service on the face of this planet really like? Well lets just say that a red fruity drink was spilled on my white T-shirt and the waiter simply replied, ""O! now you have a tie dye shirt."""
Benjamin N.,"Lakewood, CA",31,34,59,4.0,7/4/2009,"I love eating bj's! Came on a Friday night and they said there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. WHAT? Don't people eat out in the IE? Cool for us because I'm used to the hour wait at Cerritos. The avocado egg rolls are so good. I got to watch the Dodgers play and beat the Padres. It's a really nice atmosphere. I recommend coming here, watch a game and eat good food."
Ron H.,"Palm Desert, CA",124,66,11,4.0,11/18/2011,"I love BJs. great salads, great beer and lots of fun!"
Brian D.,"Naples, FL",48,34,,2.0,8/19/2012,Not sure what happened on the night we were there but the food was awful.Our server was very nice and friendly.Not sure if we will return.
Sharon C.,"Whittier, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/22/2013,"Your corporate office needs to be aware of very poor customer service at the BJ's Restaurant on 11520 4th Street,  Rancho Cucamonga, CA. On May 21, 2013, my family of 14 people went to this restaurant to celebrate my niece's graduation. We arrived at the opening time of 11am and the hostess told us that it would be a 15-20 wait. After 30 minutes, I asked her how much longer and she said that the table was getting set up for us right now. Ten minutes went by and I approached her again and this time she said that they have called in other servers to come in and that it should be another 5 minutes. We waited another 10 minutes ( now have waited a total of 50 minutes ) and I approached her again and this time she told us that part of the table saved for us was given to another group and if we didn't mind splitting our party in 2 sections!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME !!! To make things worse, I spoke to Steve, who was in charge, and told him we were very unhappy. I mentioned that my niece picked this restaurant for her graduation celebration and he says to me "" so did everyone else"". OUCH !! In addition, he had one other solution and that was to put us outside. Unfortunately, it was close to 80 degrees and we had 3 elderly relatives in their 80's that would not  have been able tolerate the heat. Anyway, who wants to be uncomfortable in the heat while they eat at your restaurant!! Your people need training in customer service as well as running a restaurant more efficiently. You have now lost 14 customers !!!!"
Joseph Anthony K. G.,"Long Beach, CA",3,3,,4.0,8/13/2010,"Love it!! Such good food, and not too far from the mall at all! I love their pizzas & seriously everything on the menu."
Ellen K.,"Etiwanda, CA",1,20,,1.0,2/1/2013,"This place is horrible!!! Went there twice. The first time we waited 45 minutes for our meal and they brought the wrong entrees and forgot about our appetizers. We were so hungry by then we just ate what they brought out and told the waitress to forget about the appetizers. Fifteen minutes later she comes back and says she found our appetizers! They were ice cold and soggy. Yum!!! Told her we did not want them, especially now, and they still tried to charge us for them! I would never have gone there again, but we were going out for an event for my daughter and it was her choice. Soooooo....we waited 45 minutes for a table, placed our order, and an HOUR AND A HALF later we still weren't served! Unbelievable that this place stays in business. What I did taste of their food was an over-processed, salty mess. Horrible horrible place. And can someone explain to me why their floors are so slippery??? I guess if they can't kill us with the food they can finish us off with a good fall."
Kenny C.,"Oakland, CA",28,223,45,5.0,6/29/2009,"Went here for lunch last week and had a great experience. The food was great and the service was even better. Our waitress was Kelsey and she was extremely helpful and nice. The food came out quick and she always checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. I swore off BJ's after I had a horrible experience at one of the restaurants in the Bay Area, but after this experience I will definitely be eating BJ's on a regular basis."
