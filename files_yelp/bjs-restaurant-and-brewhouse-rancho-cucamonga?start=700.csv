Joshua W.,"Henderson, NV",224,387,524,4.0,5/30/2009,BJ's has some of the best pizza you'll ever find an some great beer choices to go right along with it! The inside of this restaurant is always clean and they have a separate bar area to allow you to enjoy your meal without yelling that sits a bit higher than the rest of the booths. Plenty of flat screens adorn the walls throughout the restaurant (including the bar area) to catch the latest game!
Jayson S.,"Salinas, CA",128,1,,5.0,1/18/2012,I had the create your own pizza unlimited topping and put all the meat on they had on the menu. Best pizza iv ever had. Not too pricey. Super long island got me good. Would definitely eat here again and recommend everyone to try the pizza.
Isabel S.,"Fontana, CA",482,57,22,5.0,3/22/2009,"OMG ORDER THE MEDITERRANEAN !!! It was amazing. We ditched the pepperccinis and added the artichoke hearts... cheese and rice, this thing was super bomb!"
Deborah O.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,9,3,5.0,10/17/2011,"First off let me explain my five stars.  Chances are if you're at Bjs you're not coming for a fine dining experience, you're coming for some tasty American food; and that's exactly what you'll get here.  Bjs is all that and more with an array of options on their menu and very reasonable prices!  I know Bjs is known for their pizza but you absolutely must try their turkey sandwhich with wedge cut fries, especially at lunch time when it's only $6!  I'd reccomend this place to anyone!!!"
karla s.,"Ontario, CA",12,10,,3.0,7/1/2008,"I went to Bjs for lunch today and the food and our drinks were quite tasty! All of my margaritas were a bit stronger than normal but not too strong were they made me cringe, so that was nice  The service was not all that  great though. The waitress was sooooo slow. I'm usually very understanding  if its busy and the waiters are too busy to check on us, but it was late lunch and there was literally about 15 people eating in the whole restaurant and about 10 waitresses. ugh."
pauswon X.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,33,33,5.0,4/16/2009,"I been here alot. I have had like 3 birthday parties with 20-30 people each one, very pleased with staff. Pricing is great, and if you sit at the bar make sure you say what up to Kobe or Don, or Candice.. Really nice bartenders and servers.. Food is great I have had there pizza with tomato chopped pieces, BBQ chick sandwich, Fet. Pasta, Artichoke dip, salads, none have which have been disappointing by. Oh yes and i recommend there beer, (when its in session ""Nitwit"")"
jack w.,"Norco, CA",1,3,2,1.0,11/2/2011,the worst place to eat  the first time I went I liked the food but the second  I found pubic hair on my pizza disgusting. and I made the mistake of going a third time with friends from outside the country they asked for a beer and the waitress asked for their IDs  when they show the ID they immediately refused the service arguing that they could only accept California IDs they treated as like criminals and never as tourists willing to spend money
Ethan L.,"Irvine, CA",39,13,1,1.0,4/18/2010,"Seriously. I love their veggie pizza. It's soooo delicious. It's what I get the most often at BJ's. However, I experienced a problem last night when my friend and I visited this particular BJ's, and I think it's important that people know about it. We ordered a medium veggie pizza to split. I was a bit grossed out when I found a piece of pepperoni in my pizza. Ok, I told myself it's not that big of a deal. I just picked it out and decided not to say anything to our waitress as they were really busy. A few minutes later, my friend thought there's something strange in his pizza. He spit it out and it's A PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS (It's white, so it's probably from their plate or bowl). We immediately notified our waitress, and she got her manager to come over. He was very apologetic and offered to make us another pizza. In the mean time, he offered to give us any salads or soups that we would want. We didn't want anything though. My friend thought at first he was okay, but he then realized he was bleeding inside his mouth. The manager came by again and brought us our pizza (they remade it, but made it a small instead of medium, which was what we ordered). He did acknowledge that the kitchen made a mistake, and he thought he would bring the small pizza out anyway in case we were hungry, and they would make us a medium one. We told him that my friend was bleeding and he quickly took down my friend's contact info. He said he wanted to follow up with him in a few days to make sure he's okay. We asked him to just pack up the pizza since my friend obviously couldn't eat anything now. He then offered to give both of us desserts. When he brought us our food all packed to go, he gave my friend a $25 gift card. Like I said, I think their food is great. I just want everyone to know to be careful at this location. I guess when the kitchen gets really busy, something like this can happen. However, it's completely NOT acceptable. It completely ruined our appetite. Imagine what could have happened if my friend swallowed that piece of glass!!! I've been to several BJ's restaurants and this is the only place where I experienced any problems. I will probably go back, but I will look for broken glass in my food."
John W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,8,,4.0,3/19/2011,"Love their self-brewed beers, especially the Jerimiah Red."
Kendle C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,19,,3.0,11/19/2010,"This place was pretty good, but I have to say that their cookies and cream pazookie is what is going to get me to go back. It was beyond good! Our server was super cool, but there was a mishap with  the appetizers and they ended up coming out super late along with our entrees and they were cold on top of that. Someone who was not our server gave us a lame excuse about it being the kitchen's fault, which I wasn't impressed with, but in the end the manager came over to talk to us and she comped both dishes which was very nice of her. Didn't get to try any of their beer selection or their fresh brewed root beer, so I will have to check that out next time. My biggest complaint is how freakin dark it is in there! I can kind of see what they're going for, but it's pretty bad when at every table you can see people pulling out their iPhones just to shine some light onto their menus. Next time, I'll go back in the day time."
Justin Y.,"Glendale, AZ",1,6,,3.0,8/18/2010,"Good food, Like usual service stinks. Make sure you have time to wait when you come. Typical chain with a lot of selection. Close to the hotel so it works for us."
Mary P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,35,,3.0,9/4/2009,Nothing special.  Good for a bar scene or for watching sports.  Good for group gatherings.  But not so good for just food.
Aly L.,"Chandler, AZ",510,749,8,4.0,1/30/2007,"a brand new bj's right smackdab in the middle of rancho cucamonga across the street from the ontario mills mall. like every other bj's ive ever been to (which is a lot because i love pazookie. no, not that. get your mind out of the gutter), i liked it and considered it a good, stable place to have a meal while im out here on this client. fortunately, not too many people know that this one exists (heck, it wasn't even on yelp yet) so the lines aren't long at all and you can seated for lunch and dinner right when you walk in. i guess they are still working out the service kinks because the waiter made a couple of mistakes but he apologized profusely and was extremely attentive. all is forgiven, my friend. check out the giant baked potatoes. you will love me and also learn how to spell potato. :)"
sergio d.,"Riverside, CA",3,10,,5.0,10/17/2009,the beer sampler will give you a good buzz also the food is good stuff.
S. C.,"San Gabriel, CA",31,80,2,2.0,6/30/2010,"dinner on a tuesday. no wait. our server took our drinks order, but couldn't remember it, even though there were only 2 drinks we ordered (one being water). got the ahi poke, hawaiian shrimp skewers, shrimp pasta, and flat bread chicken pesto pizza appetizer. there were no utensils at our table, and after all the food came, still no utensils. by then they sent our server home and replaced her with another girl. i asked the new girl to get me utensils. she disappeared for a good 10min (meanwhile, we just grabbed a set from another table), and when she came back to check on us, she didn't even remember that she was supposed to get utensils. my husband's drink was empty, and she didn't ask us if we wanted a refill (even though we left it at the edge of the table as a hint). asked for boxes because as usual, we had too much food, while also ordering the pizookie trio (3 small pizookies, you get to pick what flavors you want) and asking for the check, since we knew this one was slow. ugh. still took long. i only left 10% tip, when i usually leave 15-20, and i left a little note inside saying the service was terrible. i suppose i was lying, it wasn't terrible per se, it just wasn't there."
Steve K.,"Upland, CA",276,260,131,5.0,8/14/2010,"After telling our great server Roland(?) that it was my first time here, he asked whether I would be coming back, to which I replied ""hell yeah."" Despite the feeling of disappointment of this being only my first visit to a BJ's, I left feeling very much satisfied. We started off with the $3-4 individual appetizers with could've passed as $5-$6 appetizers. The gourmet mac and cheese was out of this world. Although I was hankering for and expecting a more soul food-type of mac and cheese, this gourmet alternative surely sufficed. Being a brewery, the beer and root beer are made there on site. Not being the biggest fan of root beer, I was reluctant to try it, but its fresh and unique taste has changed my mind. Now, for the pizza(which would be foolish not to order coming to BJ's). Yet another unique treat served in a deep dish, we ordered a medium half-buffalo, half-bacon cheeseburger pizza. A medium among 3 people proved to be sufficient(1-2 slices each, with leftovers), in addition to the appetizers, and the little room saved for dessert. All of this talk is stimulating my cravings, excuse me as I go heat up the leftovers. Back. Lastly, make sure you top everything off with the unrivaled Pizookie; a freshly baked cookie with a crispy exterior and a soft core, topped with 2 ice cream scoops with your choice of flavor(same with the cookie). Truly a delectable and simple work of art. With a nice, dim-lit, sports bar-type, but family oriented atmosphere, great and delicious entrees, the best service, and fresh brew, I'm inclined to say that this place is amazing."
