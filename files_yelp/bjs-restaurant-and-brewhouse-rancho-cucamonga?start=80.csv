Samantha W.,"Cedar City, UT",120,81,37,4.0,7/29/2017,"I have been to this location many times and have never been disappointed. Just went again yesterday with the whole family and even though there were 13 of us, we were still well taken care of. I got their Tennessee hot chicken sandwich and it was perfect. We had a hard time getting refills on our drinks, but that won't stop me from coming back in the near future."
Sam A.,"Corona, CA",1,14,15,5.0,6/26/2017,"Took the family to bjs tonight, great service and very attentive from the moment we sat down! We all ordered dinner, my mom ordered a steak and she ordered it medium well (she's old school), the plates come out and her meat was rare basically we notified our server and she took it back with no questions and said will have a fresh plate come right out. The manager (I believe his name is Ron) came out without us even asking for him and apologized for the meat being under done, it did take a little longer to came out so he came out again and comped her plate off the bill! Great customer service and we all enjoyed all of our meals very much."
Randall S.,"Ontario, CA",1,27,3,3.0,7/7/2017,"Went on a Friday night so it was packed.  Wait to sit a party of 2 was 10 minutes, but after we were seated, service was extremely slow.  I had the BBQ chicken pizza and why wife had the Asparagus and Shrimp pasta.  Both dishes were just ok.  Overall, nothing special about this place.  Just average."
Michael T.,"Riverside, CA",155,99,442,4.0,6/18/2017,"I decided to take the kiddo out to dinner at a sit down restaurant just because. I gave her a couple choices and she ended up choosing BJs. We got there before 5 pm and I was hoping to beat the dinner rush. We walked in and there were four parties ahead of us. I saw there were a number of empty tables (and there were many more when we got our seats) so my initial impression wasn't exactly positive. However, once we sat down everything got so much better. Our server was very busy but very attentive. Our food came out pretty fast and was very good. I ordered the Black and Bleu House burger ($9.50) and it was tasty. Nicely cooked even though the garlic butter covered bun got a bit messy. I got a four taster set of some of their core beers and all four were refreshing on that especially hot day. The kiddo ordered macaroni and cheese and I tried to talk her out of it because they give you KRAFT but she didn't mind at all. Her meal got topped off with a mini pizookie so she was in desert heaven. After my initial impression, BJs rebounded in a big way. I look forward to a return visit."
Symone C.,"Perris, CA",1,5,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Okay, we sit down and we know exactly what we're going to order. Our waitress comes and she is so rude. I've never had a bad experience at this BJ's before, but this lady had it out for us tonight. On top of that, our mozzarella sticks came out cold and hard. We sent them back and the guy that brought us the ""new"" ones said it was a whole new plate. They were the exact same ones just microwaved, we could tell because there was a half eaten one still on the plate. When we told our waitress she told us the original ones were in the back and she rolls her eyes and walks away from us. If I could put 0 stars I would for this experience."
Satnam S.,"Ontario, CA",9,17,39,5.0,2/11/2017,Well I got kicked out the amc oh well came over to bj cuz I wane eat we been comeing over last two year Matt took care of us thx bro good Service and happy to be here
Sue G.,"Fontana, CA",0,27,3,5.0,10/30/2017,We went to our local BJ's in Cucamonga and have always had good service but today our server Scott exceeded our expectations. He had a great attitude and we didn't have tell him to refill our drinks. We asked for changes on our pizza and it was done to iur liking. He also would come by and give us an update on our order. I give alot of credit to servers that make memorable connections with their guests.  It makes me want to come back again and again.  I will tell you that I will call up next time and ask for Scott. Thank you for such a great service
Tony T.,"Fontana, CA",36,2,,1.0,5/4/2017,Thanks for helping celebrate my wife new job. It was amazing that i only had to go up and tell you twice about sending over pizzokie so we can celebrate. We paid our bill and  even waiting like 10 minutes to see if my waitress would bring it. (Btw my wife didnt know what i was doing) I usually leave a tip this time i just got my change and left. As we we're leaving i told my wife i had to go back inside i have use the restroom.  And still after the 3rd time the same person i had spoken too about it didn't looked at me like if we never met. AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR RUINING MY WIFE CELEBRATION.  p.s. i was not looking for a free hand out all i wanted was to celebrate my wife new job. After 2 years of not finding a good job she finally got a great job and it got ruin by your staff.
Julia F.,"Rialto, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/20/2017,I used to love this restaurant but within the past year it's really gone downhill...the servers are decent but the few times I've spoken to management they aren't very nice and/or caring of the guests or employees..the food isn't near as good as it used to be but it's ok and they ask you to fill out a survey EVERY time you visit which doesn't make any sense at all...I still like BJs but not this particular one
Esper G.,"Indio, CA",0,94,,5.0,5/21/2017,"Been going here for 9 years off and on every other month.   Employees change every year which is OK.  Sometimes the service is good sometimes bad. However, employees tonight were on top of it.  Food (chicken lettuce wraps and pizza were good as usual)  and draft beer is always great but tonight the service was perfect.  Brianna was great as was all of the staff.    Went to the Valencia/Magic Mountain location last month.  This place was 100% better."
Steven P.,"San Jacinto, CA",1,12,1,5.0,8/5/2017,"good job bartenders. simple. to the point. edward, always solid job in take out. this man needs be promoted based on ability to read guests. very professional, this coming from another team member."
Paul S.,"Tustin, CA",1373,444,3606,4.0,7/11/2015,"5 stars for Trevor the bartender who took care of me. I was pleased with being treated fairly and efficiently during a busy Saturday afternoon rush.  The score is pulled down to 4 stars on account of the overly salty Flatbread I ordered. However, chain restaurants are not known for being judicious in the sodium department. All-in-all, I enjoyed the blonde beer and how light the peperoni Flatbread sat in my stomach."
Patrick A.,"Covina, CA",6,153,2,5.0,7/10/2017,"Came here today for wife's birthday. What an amazing visit. Only a 20 minute wait time. Food was fast, fresh, and delicious. Server was engaging and friendly. Pizza was 50% off today and I got the chance to try the churro pazookie. Wow that thing was awesome! overall great visit!"
Jose M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,30,,1.0,4/2/2017,"I ordered the BJ's favorite and I felt like it was missing something. I was right - they forgot the mushrooms. I didn't feel like complaining because I was starving so I just 'sucked' it up. Oh well.  Also, it was MLB Opening Day and not one TV had baseball. So much for it being a ""sports"" bar.  I asked our server to switch it over to the game. She happily said yes but an hour later, still nothing. What a wasted Sunday. From now on, we're sticking to Rock and Brews. Food is just as good, lower prices, and the service is top notch!"
Juanita R.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/26/2017,Our waiter Esteven was so friendly and just hands down best customer service. It's refreshing when someone love theirs job and shows it. He was on it and always with a smile. Just make sure to catch him on a good day #teamesteban
Deja P.,"Fontana, CA",191,7,3,1.0,3/31/2017,"Im beyond livid right now. I ordered a Pazooki and I wanted a chocolate cookie with CHOCOLATE ice cream. How do you mess that up? This isn't the first time I've had an unsatisfactory meal. On top of that when I called the girl didn't eve seem to care that much. I'm so upset because this ruined my whole lunch, and I dint have time to go back and have it switched before I had to clock back in for work. I don't think ill be going back any time soon."
A. D.,"Claremont, CA",11,5,3,4.0,7/22/2017,Came here for my daughter's 21 st B Day and there was an issue with my reservation but Eric the manager made things right after that it was great customer service and good food . Will definitely come back again :-)
H K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",8,24,2,2.0,8/9/2017,"Normally I like this restaurant ok but the waitress this time was just not paying attention.  She brought me a completely different burger than what I ordered; it was a totally different kind of meat.  I have no idea how she got that out of what I ordered.  I even pointed to what I wanted while ordering. Definitely not paying attention. It's like I was speaking and it was just going in one ear and out the other.   It pretty much ruined the dinner.   Just be careful when you order, I guess they don't know their own menu."
Shauna T.,"Beaumont, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Called ahead to place order. Took 15 min's (not busy) to be seated and that was when order was placed with kitchen. When we  asked ""at what point the order is placed when we call in advance, told when we are seated"". Asked to speak with manager and when she addressed us, Manager blamed us for not telling them we were on our lunch hour. Mmmm... 1130 on a Friday. Aren't most people on their lunch hour? Served salads with no silverware on table. Found toothpick in salad and when someone else in the party told the manager, she simply handed me an incident form to fill out. Didn't ask if I bit into it. Didn't ask if I was ok. Shoved a form in my face and handed me a pen. Lazy staff including manager who have poor customer service."
Misty M.,"Victorville, CA",12,16,17,5.0,5/27/2017,Great Pizza. Love the sizes and I can choose different sides on a half/half to meet the needs of my entire family.
