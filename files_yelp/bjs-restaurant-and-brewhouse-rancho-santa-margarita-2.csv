Niki P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",116,5,,5.0,11/26/2017,"My boyfriend and I went in late on a Wednesday night and sat in cocktail. Zach Z. was our server and right off the bat was welcoming and personable. My boyfriend and I were indecisive and took quite a while to decide, but he never got impatient and was friendly and even helped us come to a decision, which turned out to be great. He had a really great grasp on the menu and drink so he was able to answer all of our questions thoroughly. Our water glasses never went empty and he made sure we were taken care of the whole night and had everything we needed.  The food was great, but his awesome service and friendly demeanor made the experience so much better! I highly recommend this restaurant and be sure to ask for Zach as a server!"
Janelle J.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",922,393,925,4.0,11/15/2017,"Came in on  a Tuesday for lunch with a friend right at 11am opening. We specifically planned to come to BJ's on a Tuesday because they have the special 1/2 price wine and champagne (we got mini champagne bottles for $4.30 ish) and $3 pazookis. When we walked in, I expected to smell cleaning products because they had just opened, but to my surprise we smelled yummy food! I was instantly appetized.  We both ordered one of their lunch specials, a mini pizza 1 topping & salad for $10.95 and an order of buffalo wings ($11.95 ish)  We were pleased that it came with a salad and were excited to dig in! The wedge salad was great, and I ordered the garden salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. The balsamic was amazing, next time I will get a large salad because of the amazing dressing, The pizza was a bit doughy for my liking, I was more into the salad and champagne. Also, the pizza came with chopped up tomatoes on top of my pepperoni, I was a little confused because I did not order chunks of tomatoes, but thats okay because they were good anyway. Be weary of this if you are not a tomato eater. Ohhhh our boneless hot wings appetizer.... Not as good as other places, and they were expensive! Stick to the avocado egg rolls for appetizer instead. Loved how the champagne was served in mini bottles! It pours about 2 glasses and is not flat because it was in an unopened bottle. I asked for a side of orange juice to make mine a mimosa and they waitress brought it right away at no extra charge. My pazooki recommendation  is their classic, chocolate chunk. I order mine well done because I don't like the oozing batter. I suggest ordering your pazooki about 10 minutes before you want it at your table because they have to cook for a bit. Our server was great, I'm sad I didn't get her name to mention it in this review because she was so nice. We were sat in the bar for lunch and enjoyed looking at their fancy colorful alcohol display."
Roger C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,65,,2.0,10/28/2017,Spotty service. Servers are not very attentive and most of the time my order is never placed properly.  Still doesn't hold a candle to the Laguna Hills location.
Marissa L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",254,503,1089,3.0,9/25/2017,"I came here for a late night dinner/snack. We sat at a booth in the bar area. I ordered a strawberry lemonade to drink. It was more on the sour side than sweet. To eat I just ordered some mozzarella sticks. When we got our plates and silverware our plates were still wet and a little dirty. I had to wipe down my plate.  We got our appetizers after a little bit of a wait. My mozzarella sticks weren't that bad. They were nice and stringy. They could of been a little more crispy though. My Dad got chicken wings with buffalo and ranch sauce on the side. They were alright, a little on the greasy side. My Mom got their chicken potstickers. The filling was kinda dry, but the soy sauce helped. I liked the wonton wrapper part though. It was crisp on one side and soft on the other. It was an ok late night snack."
Ashley C.,"Laguna Beach, CA",486,67,90,4.0,10/24/2017,"I have been coming to BJs since I could remember. Back in the day I would come here for their thick deep dish pizza and the chocolate chip pazooki. Now that I am gluten free, I have gotten a little more adventurous with their menu. The stuffed baked potato and salmon are a great option when I'm not craving pizza. Onto their pizza for those of us who are gluten free...  Pros:  -Gluten Free Pizza Dough  Cons:  -Not our standard delicious deep dish pizza  -Personal size options only  -Very thin crust  As for the deep dish pizza my boyfriend ordered, he was very disappointed that it wasn't a true Chicago style deep dish where toppings are layered ok thick with a ton of cheese, the pizza was just mostly bread with a small amount of cheese and they were very stingy on the toppings.  Overall, the service here is always top notch and they have options for everyone."
Kate M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,10,1,1.0,1/10/2018,"I needed a hacksaw to get through the steak I had tonight. The service was good, but the food was, well, that whole hacksaw thing.."
Jane R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",42,109,257,2.0,2/11/2017,"I go to this branch quite often for beer & wings.  Always sit in the bar as there's always a wait for tables, sometimes we actually leave and drive to another branch as there are no tables, even in the bar.  Friday night was ridiculous, If you don't have children and want to go on a Friday night, go later to avoid the early evening family/school crowd. Twice I went to the bathroom to find a group of children hanging around gossiping and hogging the mirrors/sinks. No one ever seems to check the bath rooms as they are always out of paper and soap.  We found a free table (uncleared) and sat down, had to wait forever someone to notice us who then half cleared the table and disappeared. Had to signal someone to then clear the rest of the table. Then had to call someone else again for menus! I know it's busy, but keep an eye on your tables. Shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for a drink!  Some of the servers are very good, very attentive etc but this guy was terrible. Bad attitude and kept disappearing!  The wings (which I normally enjoy) came with hardly any buffalo sauce and ranch thrown all over them, totally drowning them (I want the choice to add ranch to my wings OR not).  Decided to go for the 'wild' salmon which is $20 which isn't cheap for this kind of restaurant. It was so basic, the vegetables are like what you get on the side of an airplane meal- bland, no seasoning. The fish was over cooked and there was about ONE tablespoon of sauce. It was just so dry (took it home and gave it to the dog)  The other main, fish tacos had Too much sauce! Sort it out chef!  Nearly walked out at the end without paying after having to wait another 15 minutes for the bill (the place had emptied out by then). My advice is to go on a week night and sit at the bar where you can't be ignored!"
Jess O.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,19,6,1.0,12/15/2017,"Never order delivery off their app or online & when manger says he will call you back they don't ever call back & no one seems to communicate with each other at all making things worse. Before I tell you about the delivery of only 3 items out of 12 then the disaster & complete disregard to me as customer that already paid I do have to say I never thought I would ever complain about BJ's. My kids love BJ's & we've normally go BJ's by Laguna Hills mall, which is amazing except for 1 time when they mixed up 1 kids w/fries instead of veggies. No big deal mistakes happen & we had a graduation dinner for my brother with most of family so for the sever to mess up 1 kids side with 27 people to get orders from & 5 being young kids was no big deal. We for the bill & realized they didn't  charge us for 1 kids meal because of that little mistake which no one even cared or complained about we just asked if they could bring out the veggies. So the 1 on El Toro is amazing unfortunately I won't be going to another BJ's after last night. I decided to order BJ's for delivery from this one in RSM on BJ's website. I've been to this one on a Thursday night with my kids & they weren't ever too busy. Plus I thought it's delivery how much can they really mess things up. Well I was wrong. They not only forgot to bring 9 of the 12 orders they also lied saying they would refund my card bring the missing food & have a manager call me back. I told guy I don't mind paying for I don't need anything back but I need the rest of my order so I can feed my kids. He said ok should be there in 45mins & manger would call me within an hour 1.5HRS at most. Not only did the not bring my entire food that was ordered at 4:45pm they also took almost 3HRS getting the rest of the order to me. No manger ever called. I've called at 8pm last night & told the forget it I went & got my kids food at the restaurant across from my house they were already done eating & about to go to bed. I said don't waist anyone's time but I would like to speak with a manger that was supposed to call me no later than. 7:30pm & I to be refunded for ONLY the items I didn't get since the delivery driver even said he only delivered 3 items. The 3 items he was given for my address. So I call & am understanding about them being busy& a manager not being able to speak to me but I was assured my $ would be refunded for the items I didn't receive. Well I was wrong not only was I not given a refund no one ever called me back like promised. I called today they said they would look into it & have the night manager call me today ASAP. No call ever came so I called again around 6:45pm. That manager said he had no clue what I was talking about & would look into it & me right back. Now that's it's almost an hour later I called back. They put Joy on the phone. The only manager that gave her name. She didn't have a clue either. They're blaming door dash but I know lots of people who order from door dash & have an issue. I've never had an issue with door dash. Door dash was more helpful than BJ's ever was because they kept calling trying to figure a way to fix the issue. The problem was I ordered from BJ's website so I had to deal with BJ's. After 2 days of a run around from BJ's employees & managers it made to where I'll never go to any BJ's again. FYI never order off the BJ's website or app it's a waist of time & $!! If I ever hear from a manager I'll update but I highly doubt I will."
Yurie H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",49,188,218,4.0,6/28/2017,"I don't know why the ratings are bad here, but food is delicious and service is awesome! It's pretty decent price for dinner and beer selection is huge~ Definately a go to place for beer lovers! I was surprised to see it crowded for a Tuesday night, but my dad and I were seated pretty quickly. We started off with the BJ's porter, it was malty, chocolaty and full of body. My dad got the pork with pilaf and I got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza (mini size). Food came out pretty quickly despite the business. My pizza was warm and dough was super fluffy. I'm not a huge chicken breast fan, but the chicken was pretty juicy, not dry at all. Loved how the pizza wasn't drenched in sauce, the mini was the perfect amount for me. I tried a piece of my dad's pork and it was juicy and flavorful, the pork is pretty thicc, so it looked quite filling. We ordered the triple chocolate pizookie for dessert since it was $3 off pizookie (Tuesday special). The cookie was piping hot and super chocolaty, ice cream was super rich, definately a guilty sweet treat. The total was around $60, which is not bad at all for 3 beers, two entrees, an a dessert. Highly recommend here for an affordable lunch, dinner, or if you want to grab a beer with friends."
Matt K.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",1,29,14,2.0,10/12/2017,"BJ'S Did it again, they changed their menu and it seems they never change it for the better. Try keeping your menu for a while. The service was a little better this time, even though they got my order wrong. After my last review the manager reached out to me but I don't write these reviews to talk with management, I write them to inform others."
Teri H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",177,14,40,2.0,11/11/2017,"The service wasn't as good as it use to be, and the food was okay. They forgot my 6 year old son's food and when it had finally arrived, he only wanted his dessert, because everyone else had received theirs. Our server comped his dessert, but in the end, it took a long time for us to even get our bill."
Jessica M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",885,114,372,3.0,12/8/2016,3.5 stars. Came in for a late dinner. They have a great tropical iced tea so I suggest that. Started with a wedge salad which had heaps of dressing (maybe too much) but could have used a bit more bacon and onion. Had the bacon cheeseburger with thin cut fries. Burger would have been better if they could cook it medium but other than that it was fine. Fries were hot and crispy when they arrived. They have good ranch dressing! Service was a bit slow filling up our drinks.
Cura H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",2,41,56,5.0,6/18/2017,"Went here last week for dinner Tara was our server, she was very polite and attentive  Food was perfect and delicious  They have some great happy hour deals"
Richard N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",25,5,4,5.0,8/12/2017,We came here on short notice after golfing at Tijeras creek and Alexandrea is amazing.  We have been at the bar for 5 hours and she has been nothing but accommodating to us.  You are amazing Alex!!
Stacy S.,"Orange County, CA",280,455,2485,3.0,3/19/2016,"I'm not sure what changed, but the service at this BJ's has definitely improved for the better!  I've always been a big fan of BJ's, and used to frequent the Laguna Hills location a lot, until this location opened in RSM.  Since it was closer to my home, we started coming here more often, but unfortunately the service (and the food portions) in the past did not even come close to the one in LH.   We actually stopped coming here for about a year, until tonight when I was craving deep dish pizza.  I looked them up on Yelp and noticed that their most recent reviews were more positive than ones from the past.  People had mentioned that they got a new manager and were turning things around.  That gave me hope, so we returned again tonight. The service tonight was fast, friendly and efficient.  We noticed that they had some new menu items, and we were excited to try them.  The food was as good as we remembered, however the value (price of the food versus what you get), still needs improvement.   I still want to acknowledge and give kudos to the management for turning things around, and I hope to be able to give this a 4 or 5 star review in the near future!"
John T.,"San Francisco, CA",4,50,,5.0,7/12/2017,"Definitely my new go-to place. Being a new resident to the area (but having visited for the past 10 years), it has been surprisingly difficult finding a good restaurant, with good service and dependable, affordable food.  Not where I would celebrate my engagement, but otherwise a great weeknight place or casual place on the weekends. The food is moderately priced and you always know what to expect.  Their salads are good and their pizzas, of course, are my favorite.  Chicken pot stickers are a must-try, and the Brussels sprouts are also good.   We almost always sit at the bar, where the service is great.  The two regular woman bartenders are THE BEST (they're the only ones we know) and the managers are very attentive as well.  Al and a women whose name I do not know. There is also a nice outside seating area that seems to be pet friendly. If you haven't already, check it out!"
Lou J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,11,2,4.0,5/12/2017,"Eat Here. Come on people! if you go to any chain restaurant looking for a culinary experience, you are the problem. In saying that, The Fam and I enjoy a night out to eat at the RSM BJ's location about twice a month.  The service is usually whats expected from a crowded chain and the fact that BJ's usually hires kids as servers. Great variety of menu choices and food is usually good. Although I'd advice against the Avocado egg rolls, who in the hell thinks steaming hot avocado tastes good? The Ribs are my favorite and are better than some rib joints. The Santa Fe salad with Shrimp is of good portion and tastes good. And of course the Pizza is what it is, Good! Oh and the Cucumber & Jalapeño Margarita is Bomb.  I do have one observation that will seem like a complaint. I always order a Jameson neat and usually go for a second. Why is it that first one is light in the glass and the 2nd is a good pour and what it should have been with the 1st drink. Everytime BJ bartender, WHY!?"
Anon A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,1,3.0,10/5/2017,"I enjoy BJ's but I've had issues with this location since it opened. Most recently, I ordered lunch as carry-out and I was disappointed with the amount of chicken in their California Chicken Club sandwich (photo attached). Overall, I'm just not impressed with this location and would recommend making the drive to the Laguna Hills location instead."
Lisa O.,"San Diego, CA",69,6,2,4.0,9/17/2017,"I was close to deciding to not eat here because of some slow service today.   Fortunately our  server Alani was so welcoming, professional, and amazing that I was immediately feeling like I'd come back just to sit at her table.  Great server and on top of everything!"
Sal K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,44,,3.0,6/11/2017,"Living near RSM, your late night food choices are limited.   We got there around 11 with the wife on Thursday.  The service was okay, no real complaints there  The food was also just okay.  The soup was luke warm.   We also got a ahi salad and ribs.  Both were just okay.  It's hard to give this place anything above 3 stars based on what we got.   Next time I'll try the pizza, maybe that will bump things up a bit."
Jim B.,"Dana Point, CA",27,34,8,1.0,2/26/2017,Server Alani was horrible!!!! When we tried to complain the employees all acted like they didn't know her name.  Then the manager came by and fixed nothing. Acted like her service was acceptable.
Joy D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",8,80,29,5.0,4/14/2017,Fantastic Curbside service! Offered something to drink while I waited for my order. Ordered a Lemonade...on the house!!Love BJs-- always friendly and great food!
Katie S.,"Westminster, CA",20,8,1,1.0,9/20/2017,Just disappointed....for how pricey the food and drinks are our services was not great. The beginning started out fine but then our server just left....didn't tell us...and had no one else come check on us. After a while of me looking around and looking at other servers I finally had to get up and go find someone just so I could pay my bill and leave. Not happy about spending as much money as I did to have such slow bad service....Probably won't be back to this location
Jeanne L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",23,48,14,4.0,8/28/2017,I love that it is possible to have a table conversation without strain to hear or shouting.  The food is good for the price.  Jeremiah Red is a great beer choice. We don't go out often but this is a nice place to meet up with a couple friends and enjoy the evening. I did call for reservations early in the week for 6:45 Friday and we only had to wait about 5 minutes for the text that the table was ready.
Mary D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",7,8,,1.0,8/19/2017,"We have eaten here several times. Today's experience started with menus that were filthy and smelled. When you watched the front desk, you could understand why. A lot of gossip between 3 employees and no work being done. After asking server twice, we got wet naps to clean our hands. There was no way I could eat without wet naps and I told our server why. She apologized and said she would tell manager. We'll never know since no one stopped by. My husband's order was brought out 3 times before they brought the correct order. The food was good but the atmosphere and sanitation was definitely lacking."
Mary B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",10,91,28,1.0,7/23/2017,"I stopped coming here because they would always bring my food out all at once, salad, appetizer and pizza we wait for a half hour then bam it's all there getting cold while you are trying to eat. I tell them everytime I want my stuff out one at a time and they just don't care. Also they started charging for garlic knots.  bye bye"
Ravi J.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",30,163,20,3.0,1/4/2017,"We like going to BJ's, my wife loves Pizzokie there and even thou with low rating on Yelp for this particular location we still went as it's the closest one. After going there couple of times, I now feel why would this place has low ratings. Service is slow and food is below average, not sure why it's not of a same standard as other locations that we previously visited, even thou BJ's is a big chain. Looking at the mixed reviews in terms of service may give this location a couple more chance before finally scrapping it off the list and try a farther one."
Michael D.,"Irvine, CA",17,12,2,4.0,5/15/2016,"Possibly the best place in RSM for guys like me.  I'm single, like to sit at the bar and watch sports, possibly work on my computer, and sometimes strike up some conversation.  This is the best place in RSM for that.  Bartenders are super cool.  Fun place to hang when in RSM. However, RSM is no place for singles.  It's for families in Coto, Dove Canyon, or any one of the multitude of boring neighborhoods for families.  BJ's is also friendly for them.  The place has plenty of room and is family friendly."
Agneta K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",54,5,1,1.0,3/18/2017,Ordered sliders got the sliders but non of the sides... even though it was read back to me  So frustrating! Not the first time either
Comedy P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,192,314,4.0,6/29/2016,"Fist I'd like to thank Manager Hector (before I forget his name) for his extended customer service!  I came in on a Tuesday around 12:40pm. Busy lunch hour and the last day of the ""Free Pizookies"". I went to place an ""order to go"".  I ordered the lunch size Lemon Thyme Chicken and the Roasted Chicken & Spinach. And I got my first Pizookie (Chocolate Chunk).  My wait was around 30 mins (It was busy) and I was offered something to drink while I wait. I declined....... But it was 93 degrees outside, I should have said ""Yes"". LOL   My order was ready...... And my ice cream was placed in the bag with the hot food. Most places place it in a small separate bag. I took it out and carried it in my hand.  The food was delicious. I'm not sure if my Pizookie was supposed to be cooked on the outside and like cookie dough inside; even on the edges..... I placed it in my toaster oven to cook it a bit more. That was a better consistency.  So, great food, awesome customer service.  And I'll have to come during Happy Hour. They have it twice a day!"
Kylie C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",38,5,,1.0,1/20/2017,"Absolutely disgusting. Just ordered the tavern cut pizza and it taste like it wasn't even cooked. Not crispy at all, more like a super soft tortilla. Couldn't even eat it!  Been here several times before and 2 out of 3 experiences were horrible. 1 time there was hair in my food. Another time my boyfriend and I came in we only had 1 fork at the table and no one stopped to check on us. We literally had to take turns eating. Everytime we tried to get someone attention they would either keep walking or say they would bring us a fork and never come back"
Erin V.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/31/2017,"I placed an order using the BJ's app which I was very excited about. It was easy to use and I received an email indicating that my food would be ready at the RSM restaurant at 6:45pm. I arrived with my 2 young sons at 6:45pm to pick up our food and the girl at the takeout counter indicated that they never received my order. I showed her my emailed receipt and she said they never received that order and told me she'd have to place my order again. I also mentioned to her that on the back counter, there were drinks that looked like what I had ordered, but she said they were someone elses. My sons and I waited over half an hour for the new order and when they called me up, I asked the server if the food she was packaging up was fresh and had not been sitting in the warmers since 6:45pm (my original pick up time). She said yes, that she had just gotten them from the kitchen. I agreed to take the food based on the premise that it was fresh. I left at about 7:30pm. I got home about 2 minutes later with my sons and as I was unpackaging the food, I discovered that the food was time stamped 6:26pm which would have been the time that it was prepared for my original pick up time at 6:45pm. The food was cold, my boys wouldn't eat it, and I believe the drinks they handed to me were the ones that had been sitting on that back counter and therefore watered down. I called the restaurant to express my complaint about the service and they indicated that a manager would call me back since they were slammed. I appreciated that, however, its been 2 days with no call back. I haven't been able to get a hold of the Manager. What upsets me the most about this is the fact that the server lied to me and I caught her with the time stamp. This is unacceptable service. So... according to the RSM restaurant, the app doesn't work because they never received my order... or did they?"
Kyle W.,"Lake Forest, CA",25,21,5,2.0,10/2/2016,"BJs is great. This one is not. The drive down to the the one off of El Toro will be well worth it. On multiple occasions I have experienced poor service at this location. These have occurred when I was with a large group. If you have more than 4 people, go elsewhere. The beer is great. The pizza is delicious, the appetizers are tasty. The service is where this location falls short.  Hopefully they can make some changes. I really enjoy BJs food."
Vanessa B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",73,18,5,5.0,12/16/2016,"Absolutely wonderful service. Brisa & Samir were wonderful.  Came for a Holiday christmas party with a party of 24, 12 being kids. The managers, Al & Kenny, did a wonderful job accomadating to our needs."
Ellen D.,"Coto De Caza, CA",15,3,,5.0,7/29/2017,"I received a birthday buy one get one and decided to try it!  Has never been a go to place, but must say that has all changed!  Wow, what a pleasant surprise.  The pork chop with asparagus was better than amazing.  The service was very good and the atmosphere very pleasant. I'm still trying to figure out how on earth they prepared the meat.  Do yourself a big favor and try it, we will be heading back soon! Thanks for the gift and a wonderful meal."
Chris L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",7,10,1,5.0,6/14/2017,"Had the privilege of being waited on by Bryce. Young guy from Michigan. This young man was very polite, respectable, and detailed. He made sure all our needs and wants were met and he exceeded them. It's rare to find people like him. We will be requesting him everytime we go! It is only because of him, I give a 5  . BJ's this young man will be your future don't lose him."
Sandy P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,28,,5.0,1/13/2017,"Dinner last night was excellent as always. Nicole our server was fabulous. Looking back I note that Nicole was our server at lunch neatly a year ago, and my review was that Nicole was also fabulous. Continuity of superb service! Always a nice experience, one that we will continue!"
Dorris T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,107,388,5.0,5/23/2016,"We just had a wonderful meal tonight with a wonderful server, Michael S. He was the best server we have ever had here. Our food was just delish and the candied salmon is just the best thing on the menu. They did run out of couscous and substituted rice instead and I missed the couscous. But the rice was ok. And because of the substitution they gave us a pizookie on the house. That is the way a restaurant should be. They took care of us.  Michael was an excellent waiter. Very attentive and super nice.  We came back and had a wonderful dinner. I again ordered my favorite meal the chipotle cherry salmon. BEST THING EVER. Our server Morgan was amazing and so efficient. We had the best service.  She was perfect. I don't get the 2 1/2 stars for this restaurant. Every time we come here our food is fantastic and we always have great food."
Cameron N.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",298,7,,5.0,7/24/2017,"Food was very tasty. I had the jalapeño burger and it was delicious! The servers were very friendly, so would rate this as a great overall experience!"
Melissa N.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,13,1,4.0,5/17/2017,Great food! Service wasn't too bad. I love their selection of food. One of my favorite places to eat. Unfortunately I found a hair in my burger. Which was no big deal. I just let my serve know and they got me a new plate right away. The service wasn't too bad but my server did have a big table of kids and was getting used to the new system. So understandable. I recommend going here! I love to get their soup in bread bowls. About $8! Not bad! The hickory brisket and bacon burger is amazing as well!
