Tomisha S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",2,9,1,5.0,4/25/2015,Just want to say a big thank you to George! Your always so attentive whilst serving my girlfriend and I. The service is great and I'm always comfortable ordering weird food and asking questions when he is my server !
Rachel B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,1,5.0,1/3/2015,"We popped in to catch the second half of the Steelers-Ravens game at BJ's RSM and lucked out with a center table in the bar right in front of the big screen. The beer choices are the bomb at BJ's and we always seem to arrive before the Happy Hour is over so we go with the small plates. Tonight we ordered individual veggie pizzas and some avocado rolls. Both were very tasty and you can't beat the price. ($6.00 each) We also had a super fresh kale salad with lots of healthy add-ins like baby Brussels sprouts, fresh cranberries, a small amount of goat cheese, all tossed with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Ask for salt and fresh pepper grinder on the side. Salad is always a good way to damper any guilty feelings about devouring delicious appetizers.  We go to BJ's for relaxed fun, and to indulge in the kinds of foods we would not normally make at home.  Our server was on top of things although it was really busy in the bar. The manager Al came by our table to make sure everything was to our liking. He was very much a 'people person' who appears to enjoy his work and catering to the clientele. By the looks of some of the reviews on this page, perhaps some failed to voice their concerns about their food and were eager to get online and blog negative comments. I have never had a manager at any of the BJ's not listen to my comments. When there is a problem with the food, they have always been more than willing to make it right, or bring me something else. I have been eating at all the BJ's forever and would never walk out dissatisfied because their management would not have it. So, I suggest that the previous reviewers try it out again, talk to management if you have any concerns about the food or service. Be nice and they will be nice in return. This is a great neighborhood location that strives to serve their customers, and they work hard to create a local vibe and of friendliness.   We'll be back because we like the food, service, atmosphere, management, and proximity.  There is no better place to watch sports in all of RSM. Cheers! Rachel"
Brandon C.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",1,34,1,2.0,9/24/2015,"It has been awhile since I had mediocre service so I decided to try this BJs again which is right down the street from my house. Extremely slow service for a Thursday night and it took forever to get drinks or drink refills. The food was the usual BJs faire and the pizookie is what increased the stars to 2. They really need to add more staff or revisit their business model. Our food runner was great, but the server was slow getting to us and following up. A simple refill for an iced tea took 15 minutes...I was curios so I did time it. Oh well, I got what I expected and also deserved for coming back.  Too bad, it is real convenient and the food is good... but went to this BJs for a school fundraiser for the local elementary. That may be the only reason I come to this location in the future. As a side note, I do not think its thw servers fault, more towards management properly staffing and the serving model."
Theresa B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,15,,1.0,11/16/2016,Substandard food. Restaurant smelled like a sour bar that hadn't been cleaned. Hard to get service. Had to stop the server in her tracks for a drink. The runner dropped the salads on the table as he was still walking. Wedge salad had a huge core on the end of the lettuce that you couldn't even cut through or eat. Pepper shaker was sticky and so was the table. Asked for a pepper mill which of course they did not have.  Not much interaction with the server except he did ask if I would like to keep my fork and knife that was sitting in the dressing on my salad plate after I finished it. I asked for clean silverware. I got the silverware plopped in the middle of my entree when it arrived. They didn't even wipe the juice from the steak on the plate when it was served. We came here after a long time as the last experience was far from good. I do want to like this place. I do not fault any of the staff as I believe they don't know any better because they were not properly trained. The snickerdoodle pizookie was quite good.
Gina F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",171,29,101,4.0,11/28/2013,"Our family loves this place. Our  kids gets so excited when we say "" going to BJ's"".. Food is great but they raise the price lately. I am not so thrilled about their customer service because they are always busy. Anyways, we'll keep coming cuz we love the food and pizza."
J D.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,31,,1.0,3/21/2015,"Service not the best AGAIN! You would think with a new waitress and a training server helping we wouldn't wait 20 min. For our check. Never asked if we wanted another beer, oh yea no glass with our first one either."
Dana S.,"Irvine, CA",2,2,,2.0,7/30/2015,"The overall atmosphere was okay but the service was really really slow. Even if we ordered food and beer at the moment we sat down at the table, pizza came out at the last minute when we were already too full to eat it. Also the waitress forgot to put in our beer order. :-/"
Suzy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",72,10,5,4.0,11/21/2014,Love BJs!!!  Great place to fly solo or meet for lunch. .. or my favorite....Happy hour!! Great service!  Great beer!
Joel C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",22,10,3,3.0,7/14/2015,"Living in RSM, I'm a veteran of many trips to BJ's.  The key is the maintain your expectations of typically slow and possibly poor service but eventually great tasting food.  That's the bottom line here - good food, generally poor service.  If there were half star ratings, this would be a 2.5 rating, but since there aren't, I gave it three stars 'cuz those pizookies are so damn tasty :)"
Camila M.,"Northport, NY",42,227,44,5.0,2/4/2015,"I am a food-snob foodie, Michelin Star fanatic, who has eaten in some of the world's best restaurants and of course loved it.  I never settle for ordinary food and have to say have found the LA area food scene quite disappointing.  Then I had the pleasure of stumbling upon this gem of a chain.  I cannot believe it is a chain with such an amazing gastronomical masterpiece of a menu.  The watermelon salad and tuna tartar dishes I had there were some of the best I ever had.  The service was super friendly, and the drinks were phenomenal.  The place was packed with locals, who are all gorgeous by the way.  I left this restaurant already missing it and wishing one would open near me on Long Island.  How can there not be one near me?  It's better than Cheesecake Factory.  Better than Grand Luxe Cafe. Better than ANY chain you will EVER eat at, I promise you.  Once you eat there it is hard not to return soon after.  Oh, and did I mention Pizookie?  Yeah, that's their pie cookie, a signature that you must try.  Though that in particular I didn't think was that great."
Kevin M.,"Coto De Caza, CA",13,108,44,4.0,3/28/2016,"I like this BJ's. It is the closest one to me. Food is always good, staff is pretty good. Easy location for me. It is always clean and the mood is always great. The one issue and it seems to be the issue with all the BJ's is the wait."
Ashley Ta'Nique ..,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,36,10,1.0,1/15/2015,I just left here from picking up a take-out order. I have NEVER in my life dealt with someone with such a nasty attitude...guess you missed out on a tip! I'm a loyal BJ's customer but she totally ruined my experience. I will not waste another cent at this location!
Paul S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",2,6,4,2.0,11/8/2013,"Seriously,  where does BJs find their kitchen and waitstaff, Craigslist?  Something is very wrong with the management when the place is 1/2 empty at 6:30pm and we had to wait 15 mins for a table? Servers come and go without order, bringing a pitcher of beer after a long wait, but no glasses?? The food wait is totally unpredictable.  Sometimes, when you sit at the bar, food comes right away, I have also had the server explain to our table that the kitchen was ""slammed"" which translated to 30-40 mins wait for food (and that was with the place only half full).  The beers and drinks are fine, and good service IF you sit in the bar area. The bar area TVs are good too. So go there for sports. If you are looking for a nice timely dinner, there is Wood Ranch just around the corner."
Gregg S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,18,,5.0,12/16/2014,"I come into this BJs at least twice a week, it's close to my house and a great spot to meet up friends of mine. The food is always good, the drinks are great, and I love the staff they have at this location. We always get treated with the upmost respect, and have a great time, everytime. The manager Kevin always stops by and says hello, and the cocktail waitresses Alexa, Linda, and Maya are usually serving up in the bar doing a great job, and it's been fun getting to know them over the last few years. For all the people reviewing BJs complaining about drinks taking too long to arrive- it's a busy bar, if you don't want to wait a minute or two do us all a favor and stay home. There's nothing worse than someone who constantly complains. BJs in RSM is an awesome place to relax, watch the game, and unwind. 5 stars all the way!"
julz d.,"Lake Forest, CA",63,26,3,5.0,5/12/2015,"Booked my rehearsal dinner here for 26 people, and service was great! Kevin, the manager, introduced himself to us when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. Service was great! Food was good as always. Not to mention the affordable price for their pizza, pasta, and salad buffet! Thanks again for everything!"
Anand S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4,110,16,2.0,2/22/2015,"World of difference when it comes to service at this location and the one at Laguna hills. Waiter took his own time to come get our order, the appetizer came with the main course, kids menu order came last after a couple of reminders and one of the main entree came in completely wrong. There really is no reason to go back to this location."
Vanessa C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",230,52,100,2.0,9/18/2013,"This review is mostly for the food. I went here with a group of friends on a weekday for dinner. Like other BJ's restaurants, the restaurant is casual and very loud. It seems like a lot of people come here after work for beer or happy hour.  The menu is huge. There are appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pastas, and entrees. Whenever I see this vast of selections on the menu, I get a little nervous. It seems like it would be harder for restaurants to perfect each dish if they offer so many choices. However, it is a chain, so I'm sure everything is shipped, frozen, and prepared according to the specifications set by the restaurant corporation Since it was a bit overwhelming to flip through the entire menu, I stuck to the Enlightened Entrees. Each dish in this section is under 575 calories. I chose the Moroccan Spiced Salmon. The menu described it as oven roasted salmon with served over roasted vegetable couscous and drizzled with roasted red pepper sauce. When I received my entree, I was surprised. I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary, but my dish didn't even look very appetizing.The plate was huge so everything looked tiny on the plate. (Refer to picture below-- look at all the white space on the plate!)  Also the roasted red pepper sauce should really be called ""thin, runny, watery mess."" My entire dish was drenched in this sauce and it made my cous cous and vegetables very, very sweet and soggy. I wish there were more of the almonds to provide a crunchy texture, but sadly I didn't taste it. The salmon was alright, nothing special. For $13, I'm not sure this dish was worth it.  We also shared the trio of Pizookies. Bj's is famous for their cookie and ice cream creation, and I remember really loving this dessert in the past. The pizookies we got were SO sweet. I am a crazy sweet tooth, but this was way too sugary even for me.  Service was pretty good. Our server was attentive, and she brought our food and drinks out quickly.  The sad part is that BJ's will continually receive a lot of customers in RSM because it's located in an area that lacks great casual restaurants--especially large, popular restaurants known for their lunch specials, happy hour and beer. It's in a convenient location, it's good for groups, and it's open late. A suburban winner right there!"
Ali N.,"Irvine, CA",112,180,138,1.0,8/28/2013,This has got to be the worst BJ's i have ever been to! i have tried to give this place numerous of chances! but every time i have gone they have messed up!! lat time i was here the waitress was horrible we asked for side plates for the appetizers and she never brought it! we did not even have utensils when she brought out our food!  another time we ordered food everything came out either wrong or very cold and we had to return every single item! i normally don't complain at restaurants but this place is ridiculous! will never be going back here again!!
Gabriella M.,"San Francisco, CA",217,1,,4.0,6/14/2015,Thank you! The staff at BJ's is not only very well trained but are very hospitable. Their were three employees that I must say stand out. Whitney (host) was so thoughtful to my request to be sat in a specific location so I could watch the game on tv. Even offered a booth! Thank you. Mikey the bartender is very friendly. Danielle the server not only offered me appetizer and dessert....she also shared a nice smile with the meal that was terrific.These types of individual I hope are recognized and thanked for there above and beyond service.........Daniel Beck
Jeff K.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",29,17,1,5.0,3/13/2015,"We go here every week, later at night, and we always have a blast. Great pizza and beer, and the staff is awesome. We have had awesome experiences with Alex Fiore as our waitress up in the cocktail area. She's the best! Our group always looks forward to having her as our waitress. She's friendly and courteous and had us laughing and having a good time. And George is always great too! He is on top of all of our needs. Liz behind the bar is fantastic. She always has a smile and is really kind. Every week Alex, Liz, and George make our visit here really fun. More people like them please!!!!!! See you all next week!"
