Michael M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,20,,1.0,2/6/2017,Been sitting here 10 mins on a Monday evening and not a single person has said a word to us since our hostess seated us.
Rob V.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,41,7,1.0,1/4/2015,"This BJ's doesn't make it, definitely not wort it. Seriously the pizza I had tonight wasn't even Pizza Hut quality. When I got it home my wife thought I had eaten all of the toppings on my way home - nope thats the way it came.  Called to ask what happened and Mackenzie told me about how they put so many toppings on the pizza that they don't even use sauce. This thing was dry and spares as the Mojave desert. She put me on hold and I talked to the manager Al who gave me the same story and then told me I should have requested more sauce and toppings. I expected more from a $22. Pizza."
Hoa T.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,9,2,5.0,2/14/2016,"We come here a lot. The menu is extensive. Everything tastes good. I see a lot of complaints from other reviews of the service. We haven't had a bad experience unless we sit out on the patio, I think they forget u out there.  If u tip well, the wait staff will remember you and give you good service."
Nicole H.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2016,"WORST SERVICE EVER!! My family and I ate lunch here today and the service was horrible. The restaurant was empty and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. When we were seated we had a female server greet us and take our drink order. She returned quickly with our drinks but then we never saw her again. A male server came over to take our order and seemed irritated from the moment he came to our table. Everyone's drink was empty he never refilled any water or ice teas. Most of our food came out 40 minutes later and came out incorrectly. 15 minutes after that 3 of the family members finally got their food! He never came to check on us or even bother to see if everyone had their food.  We requested to speak to a manager, when she came over she did not even apologize for their poor service and food. She said it was busy for them and that is what happens. What??? When is it ok to have poor service and food and make your customers pay for it? I understand if the kitchen gets backed up but our server could have refilled our drinks and informed us that they were behind in the kitchen. Mind you the restaurant never even got half way full. We will never being go back to this establishment."
Mark L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,6,1,5.0,10/11/2016,"I've been coming to this BJ's since it's opening years ago, service has always been great but I can honestly say the best service has been from Amber the bartender... I've been coming often lately and have enjoyed the wide variety of beers on draft as well as the fantastic service I am given every time I visit with Amber. Food... variety of beer and best of all service is always top notch..always look forward to coming here"
Taylor D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/1/2015,"I hate hate hate giving a bad review but this is hopefully one to help them make corrections not to destroy the business.  As far as the building is concerned it is a wonderful piece of property, they spent a ton of money making this place look great.  Job well done! But the service is horrible. I have tried this place three times, each time my food came out cold.  (Nothing worse than cold French fries). The service was extremely slow. And peach time the order came out wrong.  The times I have been in the place was not busy enough to justify the poor service. One time there were only three other tables seated and what seemed to be excessive staff to client ratio.   I would hate to see a business close in our town those are needed jobs, and we need a great place to come and eat.  But management is not properly working this location.  The manager never seems to be present, and the staff is failing due to this.  Please pull it together I have eaten here several times with months in between visits to give it one more chance."
Kayla L.,"Orange County, CA",125,254,51,4.0,3/18/2015,"I usually come here for HH and appetizers. I am waiting for my ""real"" I.D. to come in the  mail so I had to skip on the pint of Guinness or the Berry Beer (which I have heard is great!).  I came in with a party of three and we all had our food brought out in a timely manner.  I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with a mixed green salad. My...it's very rare for me to have some food hit the spot just right. The salad was something I needed in my diet because I have a hard time incorporating veggies and healthy options into my foods. I am trying though ;) Brother got the class burger with ketchup and wedge cut fries. He enjoyed it a lot which means I have a DD if he'll come here for the burger -evil laugh- They didn't have American cheese, so he opted for cheddar.  Other person in our party got a glass of Guinness to start (because the day before St. Paddy's day, you can't go wrong with this choice) and some food....hmm......what did he get? I can't remember. I think he also tried to order one of the BJ's stouts but the waiter never brought it to him and didn't ring it through on the computer so he skipped on it because we were done with our food. There was only one mistake on our bill at the end of the meal. A pizza that was on a HH was brought up as $10 instead of the $6. It was promptly fixed without a hassle and our waitress apologized. We had to give the bill to someone else to fix because she wasn't around and we couldn't find her.  All in all, I keep coming back here because of HH and the location. The next closest BJ's is probably off El Toro and the 5. Meh, no thanks."
Jonathan D.,"Irvine, CA",715,300,2014,5.0,2/22/2016,"Always enjoy coming to this BJ's... I run into all my friends from elementary, Jr. high and high school. The whole city of RSM is here.  On my last visit I got the stake out of curiosity, but their pizza is always the best bet... So stick with that BBQ chicken or great white.  There's alway parking, but just be careful of you have drinks in your system since the police station is in view. I hear it's the spot for catching DUI in RSM.  5 estreyas from me."
Kellie L.,"Orange County, CA",211,41,6,3.0,5/19/2016,"Food is good, but the service here is terrible. No matter what time or day I go or server I have, 95% of the time it's just terrible service. Everyone is slow and a majority of the servers aren't even friendly. Food is also pretty pricey for what you get. Portions are always inconsistent when you go."
Corrine B.,"Irvine, CA",102,20,7,3.0,11/8/2016,We had a business lunch here and it was pretty good. Its american food with alot of cold beer. Maybe im being too hard but I felt overall it could have been better. We had the pizza and it was ok nothing spectacular. I probably wouldnt try it again but who knows maybe i will give it another shot.
Sylvie S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/24/2017,"Rude rude rude!! They could care less about you, your time or your meal! Our bartender had a major attitude from the start. When we complained to the manager, she said, well your obviously already mad, so there is nothing I can do about your problem. Well, I guess it's her problem now."
Mike P.,"Irvine, CA",4,91,385,5.0,2/14/2016,"Good food quality and flavor across the board. Large enough menu to accommodate diverse tastes and provide sufficient variety for routine visits. Good guest beers on draft. I didn't like their house brews, but they released a better DIPA recently. The service can be very bad across the chain, but I've been lucky at this location."
Suzanne C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",115,15,54,1.0,9/6/2016,"Told hostess it wasn't daughters birthday when we walked in. She acknowledged it. Nothing special was done or even asked by them. Asked for napkins after our food, only to be given a stack of paper bar napkins. Mind you, we ordered wings, pizza and had two kids with us. Horrible service"
Steve S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",1,19,13,3.0,9/3/2016,"I just want to say that the receptionist last night around 730, the blond girl, was not friendly at all. I made a reservation and when we arrived she told us to wait for ten minutes. Then we had to ask her if our table was ready. The food and the servers were allgreat. Then we left and then the receptionist didnt even say goodbye. Everything was great but the blond, receptionist girl."
Ramon D.,"Irvine, CA",58,60,35,2.0,10/24/2015,"This is a 2.5 Star rating.  Our family has eaten here at least 4-5 times. Beer is good and cold. Their lower calorie menu items are good. The pizookie is something our family always makes up for in calories. But that is about it. The rest of the menu is average fare.  The last time we dined here, my brother-in-law ordered a burger medium-well done. When he bit into it, the whole center of the meat was raw. The manager and servers were nice and apologetic. Tells me something is amiss in the kitchen.  Service has been hit and miss. Sometimes they seem to lack servers to accommodate all their customers. Sometimes they miss an order. Other times it's efficient.  I hope they can fix their issues."
Julie E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",169,62,21,4.0,11/25/2015,"Service here has significantly improved! I love their soups in the sourdough bowls and their chili is delicious. There is a low calorie lemon chicken dish that is amazing!  If you came here awhile back and haven't returned, give this location another try!"
Minh T.,"Irvine, CA",262,233,99,1.0,9/30/2014,"Food and service are terrible here.  My bf and I came on a Saturday evening at 9pm. They initially couldn't seat us since the servers were at full capacity. That's fine, I appreciate that they don't overextend their servers.  Well when we were finally sat down 10 minutes later, the server took forever to get to us and take an order for drinks, probably close to 20  minutes. Then the drinks took a long time to arrive, like another 20 for one water and one pepsi. She then took our food order.  My bf and I split the 9"" buffalo chicken pizza and a bacon and blue burger. The bacon and blue burger came split in half since that's what I asked for. However, the burger was so poorly assembled that all the bacon was on one half of the burger and not the other. I had to go in and redistribute the bacon. Also, it's suppose to have blue cheese, but there was no blue cheese at all. They put in too little blue cheese to call it that.  The buffalo chicken pizza is weird tasting. The crust has a taste of artificial butter. My boyfriend even said ""it tastes like movie theater popcorn butter."" That's disgusting! The cheese they use on the pizza is low quality as well, it hardens in a matter of seconds and they don't use enough on the pizza. The crust wasn't crispy either, which is what I expect from a deep dish pie made with a proper cornmeal crust. Just awful, all of it.  I hated everything about this place. I wish I could post a warning sign outside this place to tell everyone to beware."
Amy F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",84,4,1,3.0,4/19/2016,"Table 501 server Brian S. 4/19. Brian S. was very attentive. Great waiter. Restaurant not busy, no wait at the door, many empty tables. Unfortunately, the view from our table and the behavior of the waitress at the neighboring table were less than stellar. The station nearest our booth was piled with dirty dishes, which with the except of half hearted load being removed, remained there throughout our meal. We also observed the neighboring table have a drink spill while their waitress was present. She made zero effort to personally help but rather went to a nearby hostess and told her to help. (She did rush over) In the meantime the waitress walked over the wait station chatting with another staff member and watched the hostess help. We come here regularly, disappointed to find so little care for its appearance and this kind of behavior."
Emily H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",41,18,7,2.0,9/9/2015,"I keep saying I'm not gonna come here again but it's the only thing open late night around here besides fast food, & I work late.  Our server was perfectly fine last night so this does not reflect him.  Our food on the other hand was ALL BURNT. Everything from the Brussel Sprouts to the pizookies. It was like the cooks forgot they were in there and instead of coming and saying ""I'm so sorry but your order was burnt so we are making you a fresh batch"" they just served it anyways. Hubby didn't have a problem with his burnt pizookie but I sent the Brussels back and the second batch was burned also. Wasn't gonna bother for another send back.  I'm pretty done with this location. At least THIS time we got greeted and served properly but the food isn't worth it anymore."
Nick K.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",259,1,,1.0,9/25/2016,"This restaurant is a complete joke with takeout service. Every time we have ordered they have managed to screw up our order, not have our order, or overcharge us. I highly recommend avoiding it if you were doing takeout and if you were going to the restaurant be prepared to wait for a long time. We have expressed our frustration with multiple managers. NONE of them comping anything or giving us any kind of customer service besides one.  Female mid 40s with brown hair. She was the Only manager that deserves to be a manger because she knows how to give great customer service and accommodate customers when her employees make mistakes. DO NOT recommend. Very disappointed."
