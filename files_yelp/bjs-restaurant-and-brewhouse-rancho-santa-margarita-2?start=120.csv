Tim P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Never again. Ok, I have given this place 5-6 chances and I am done. This last trip was New Years day and there were four of us. Their first mistake was two of us were served our food and the other two had to wait another five minutes for their food to arrive. Then, the au jus for the French dip had to be sent back three times. The first time because it was cold and have a thick layer of grease on top, the second because it again had a thick layer of grease on the top. This is pure laziness on part of the kitchen. My california scramble had cold potatoes and there was no offering of butter or jam for the lukewarm toast. Then the cheese was not melted on the scramble breakfast. I'm guessing the manager of this place is either too clueless to correct their issues or too much of a whimp to do anything about the issues. This place better wake up or their pretty building is going to be a ghost town."
G G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",24,24,,2.0,5/22/2016,"Not good at all! I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, the chicken was gross and the broccoli was not cooked all the way. I would not recommend eating here unless you are just coming for desert. We tried the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie and thought it was really good."
Micki H.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",6,31,,2.0,2/12/2017,"We eat at BJ's every once in awhile.  Not too often because of the TERRIBLE, SLOW, CRAPY SERVICE!!!   The food is good.  but getting a little sick & tired of the TERRIBLE, SLOW, CRAPY SERVICE!!!.  The servers act as though the have NEVER had one stinking minute of training!!. 10 minutes to get a dirty table in the bar cleared as we stood there waiting.  Another 10 minues before some wanna be server came and made a brief appearence .  We hurried up and ordered because we know very well the kitchen is SO SLOW IT CANT GET OUT OF ITS OWN WAY!!!!.    had to ask a busboy 2 times for ketsup!!!... server MIA!!!  a second glass of wine, because we have had to sit so long,  another 15minutes.  according to the SLOW server, the bar is backed up... EXCUSE ME!!  We are sitting 4 feet from the bar.  there are only TWO BARTENDERS!!!! WTF!!!!  COME ON BJ'S!!! GET IT TOGETHER!!!   You have been in Rancho long enough to figure it out!!!  Will ONLY  eat here WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!!!  Del Taco is a better option!!!"
Rene S.,"Placentia, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/7/2017,"I recently ate here again. I find the service great, very personal and the timing excellent. They really aim to please. The management are always accessible, including the GM, for questions or conversation. And of course the food was excellent. We will continue to frequent this location with friends and family."
Nancy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,,1.0,1/17/2017,"Terrible food, loud environment  and we got charged full price for happy hour appetizers. They said after we got the bill you have to sit at the bar to get the happy hour prices. Food tastes like greasy fast food. NOT impressed at all, will not go back. Thumbs down."
Alex B.,"San Diego, CA",53,28,3,1.0,8/23/2015,"The only redeeming quality of this location is the wait staff who have been helpful and friendly. That being said the food is the issue here, I actually like  BJ's  in general its just this one location that is like a puss seeping boil on the chain. I'v eaten here multiple times and have yet to enjoy a single meal. I had the saddest burger of my life here, just an over cooked hockey puck I asked for extra onions and opened the burger to find two slivers and a slice of the worlds smallest tomato.  I couldn't even eat the damned thing for fear of chipping a tooth I just took it home to take pictures because it was so sad and hit the McDonalds drive through on the way home (I actually posted a picture of this worlds most depressing burger but it seems to of magically disappeared),  Another visit I ordered the Moroccan salmon and was given a pile of over salted spice I had to scrape off with a knife to find my poor salmon underneath that was so salted It was almost jerky (i'v worked in restaurants before and seen this over salted problem usually comes from lazy cooks that smoke to much cannabis and think everything should taste like hot Cheetos)  Also the fries are consistently a pile of depressing soggy starch left under a heat lamp, because you know its just so difficult to dump pre-cut fries into boiling oil for two and a half minutes to serve to paying customers. If you really want BJ's it's worth the gas to just drive to the one off El Toro, the cooks there seem to actually give a shit about their job."
Allan A.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",17,12,40,1.0,8/23/2015,"We decided to visit BJ's for Sunday Brunch. We walked in shortly after opening and were the first customers in the restaurant. Our waiter greeted us and asked for our drink choices. We asked for coffee and were told that they were out of coffee. Really? A place that serves breakfast and doesn't have coffee. Well we ordered water and after a few minutes we were served our water (w/ lemon wedge) and placed our order. 40 minutes later, that's right 40 MINUTES later we were served a portion of our breakfast. The potatoes came later because they were not done.  As we were eating our breakfast, we noticed coffee cups going out to other guests. When the waiter brings our bill I ask if they now had coffee. His reply, ""yes my manger went to the Laguna store and picked some up"".  Really? And he never thought of asking us if we would like some?  Overall the service and timeliness of the meal was terrible.  We have dined here many times, but I will never go back for brunch."
David G.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",18,1,,3.0,9/5/2016,Service was alright and food was good but they did not honor there coupon. I brought in a coupon for a free pizookie with purchase of one entree that was good until 9/30/16 and they did not honor it. We bought two entrees and today is 9/5/16.
Nikki S.,"Irvine, CA",738,31,400,1.0,5/1/2015,"We have been waiting here in our booth for over 15 minutes, and the waitress has yet to come over to greet us, provide us with ice waters, or let alone take our order. This seems to be a reoccurring scene at this location. I'm only comfortable with giving 1-star because the hostess was very pleasant and helpful -- she cleaned up a messy table for us in order to get us seated right away near the bar area."
Marco M.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/19/2017,"Just came back after having dinner at BJ's in Rancho Santa Margarita.  This is the first time I have been to this location, after having been a BJ's customer at other locations, but mostly in Laguna Hills.  The waitress was fantastic, and it is out of respect to her that I did not raise hell.  After ordering our dinner including my wife's who is gluten intolerant (we stressed this to the waitress at least five times and who assured us that she will convey the allergy to the cook and manager), they brought in the gluten-free hamburger contaminated with french fries which have wheat and are not gluten-free.  They apologized and assured us that they will make a new one.  Regardless of what they did, my wife had a reaction after we got home, which only means that her meal was contaminated with gluten.  My daughter's chicken salad had to be ordered twice but our biggest disappointment was the dip-dish pizza.  It was extremely dry, analogous to eating dry bread with very dry chicken, dry mushrooms and dry black olives (our toppings).  Hardly any cheese and skimpy tomato sauce.  The worst dip-dish pizza I have ever had.  It was definitely one of the worst dinners we have ever had.  On our way out of the restaurant, a gentleman asked us if everything was alright.  It was the Manager.  Nicely, I told him that the pizza is not what we expected from BJ's.  He acknowledged my comments and asked if he can do something to make it right.    I am not the type who complains  with the intent of getting a free meal.  I thanked him by saying no!  The reason I am giving the 1 Star is for the waitress who was definitely great.  The cooks get a ZERO!!!"
K H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",29,5,1,3.0,8/5/2014,"So disappointing. I gave up on sitting in the general restaurant because the service would get 1 star.  So I now choose the bar, at the bar preferably. The general bar service is basically the same as restaurant seating, so why bother.  Tonight I decided I really wanted a Cobb salad but had to get home, so ordered to go. I asked for extra tomatoes, and got no tomatoes. Sticker on the box is correct so is that like a middle finger from the kitchen? Sorry, I like me some tomatoes, it's your job... I apologize. Hah.. Hope they go back to happy hour during NCAA football games this season, otherwise there's not much reason for me to go back."
Leslie S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Came for daughters b-day with large party.  Salad had to be sent back due to all dressing and no lettuce.  One meal never came, manager apologized but never followed up.  Burger finally came after everyone was done and somehow was cold.  Waitress was embarrassed.  I spoke with the manager to personally tell her how poor her kitchen was run.  She and the other manager just stood around the front and never made their rounds.  Pathetic kitchen and management.  Will not be returning.  Following in the steps of the old TGIF!"
Viv B.,"Irvine, CA",0,18,14,4.0,7/12/2016,"Good place to go when it's late. Very extensive menu, something for everyone if you go with a group. This location has really good servers in the bar area. Great deep dish pizza when u want to indulge. Lots of healthier choices in the enlightened menu for when u want to be good.  Love the roasted chicken and spinach. I like the dry rub they put on the chicken. Really flavorful.  Plus, they have diet Dr. Pepper."
James S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",147,4,,2.0,8/4/2016,"Don't get me wrong, the food was great. I have no complaints about that. However, I did not like my server due to his unprofessional mannerisms and his slowness. Slow service is the name of the game at this BJs so make sure you've got plenty of time!"
Sandra K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",18,21,10,1.0,12/3/2016,"Horrible food. Food took one hour long and it was a disaster when we got it. Done with them for a while again. Get it together BJs, hire a better cooking staff. I would rate them a zero star if I could."
Dr W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,4,1.0,12/30/2015,"Yesterday, we visited my wife's mother and took her out for lunch. It was not good. There was no one at the hostess station when we came in, but a few minutes later we did get seated. We made some selections on the menu, and I ordered a Corona beer (they didn't have it..), so I settled for a Miller Lite ($4).  What California restaurant does *not* serve Corona, a very popular Mexican beer? The water brought to the table had some strange small particles floating in the water. The silverware placed on the table was dirty, and spotted, even wrapped in a black cloth napkin. They need to fix the dish washer machine or do quality control better. The food came. I had a soup (chili) and salad (Caesar). They did not bring any bread or crackers, so I asked for some. Waitress brought two little bags of oyster crackers. The chili tasted like canned chili, the salad was ok. My wife's mother's soup was cold, not hot, and had to be sent back to the kitchen to be re-warmed. We only saw the waitress rarely, never asked how things were. My wife's pasta dish (chicken alfredo) had a hair on the bowl side, so we asked them to re-do it. It came after a bit. On the check, they overcharged us for the lunch pasta dish my wife had, and we didn't notice until we left. It's supposed to be $9.50 and they charged us $15.50. Terrible experience, it was between lunch and dinner, but just never will go here again. The other BJ I've been to is near Westfield Mall in San Diego area, and it's ok, but they are overpriced."
Patti B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/29/2016,I LOVE BJs any of them! Such a huge selection of DELISH food! So Happy to have one in RSM that has also offered great service! Their LUNCH SPECIALS are the best because you can have a great meal at an AFFORDABLE price!!
Rick P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,13,5,5.0,6/30/2016,"Excellent service, fair price for food and drinks. Love the menu choices! The staff is always extremely helpful and you never have to wonder where your server is-they continually check on you. Highly recommended."
Tracy S.,"Sparks, NV",0,11,1,1.0,10/22/2016,Had the mahi mahi tacos today. The tacos were fine but the chips were literally DRIPPING IN GREASE  it was rather disgusting. Service was slow and waiter rarely checked in even though it was mid-afterwards and they weren't busy
Brittany C.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/22/2016,I have been coming here for a while with my husband but after today I had to write a review! The food is always good but it was the fist time we Patrick for our server and he was AMAZING and so attentive. He is by far the best server we have had there. Thank you Patrick!
