Christina P.,"Orange County, CA",151,280,46,3.0,4/11/2014,"I am a fan of this place.   Sure, I know it's a chain, and the service sucks sometimes because it's busy. But the last 3 times I have gone here, it has only gotten better.  I visited this location right after they opened, and was not impressed. Service sucked, took too long, sat with empty glasses etc.. And food was as expected.  Their Enlightened menu is delicious.  Perfect portion and caloric amount for me. I begin to get a little overwhelmed when I see that some of their menu items contain twice as much (or more!) as my calorie intake for the whole day!  I've had a few items off that menu and don't feel like I am being deprived. The fish always tastes fresh and everything is tasty. Servers are nice and much better than opening. Drinks are good, love their beers and cocktails.  Totally a decent place to go to in this town."
Mike H.,"Orange County, CA",0,17,,1.0,2/23/2015,"The servers here are always ""in the weeds"" and the food has always taken way too long to get from the time I have placed my order.  This appears to be a management issue.  It seems as in a way to save money the managers run this place with a bare bones crew in the front and back of the house to save a buck.   I tried to like this place since the service and food are good in Laguna Hills, but this place doesn't even come close to making the cut.  Especially when there is a Selmas just down the street."
Mike M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,12,,1.0,5/29/2016,"After numerous bad experiences with food quality and service we thought we would try this BJ's again.  Have delays had great food and service in Laguna Hills, not sure why this one is so bad.   First, the place looks great, nice bar, decorations, but it all ends there. When it comes to food and service they can't get anything right.  To start off I get my silverware which has dried lettuce on it, I ask for a second set and it was dirty as well. I order a simple scrambled eggs and well done bacon.  I ask for no potatoes or toast with my meal as I cannot eat them.   I order an ice tea and they bring me water.  The eggs taste like they were cooked in a dirty, rancid pan or something gone really bad, the bacon was raw, and there was a big pile of potatoes on the plate. Seriously, how can you screw up scrambled eggs and bacon. Unless you want a drink at the bar, stay away, stay very far away. After this horrible experience, we ask for our check so we can get out, it has now been 13 minutes and counting and nobody has come by our table.  We can't even pay and get out."
Skip P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,12,,5.0,8/21/2016,"Wow what an experience! My server Brett was attentive, friendly, and anticipated our needs. Never have I had such great service since William worked there. He suggested some drinks and appetizers based on our tastes and we never had an empty drink. The manager, Kevin, was so friendly as well. I tell ya, that guy knows his stuff, ok? What a great visit!"
Richard H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,28,,5.0,12/16/2016,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have a better rating here on Yelp. I come here all the time and although occasionally I will get substandard service, the majority of the time it is great. The food is always delicious. The beer selection is decent. I'd prefer they had more local guest beers, but that's just nitpicking. Overall I'm very satisfied with this place."
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,4.0,1/16/2012,"When someone mentions BJ's, and I'm talking about the restaurant, only three things come to mind: Beer, Pizza and Pizookies. That's the only things I'll order as I've not heard many good things about the rest of the food they serve. Having said that - I ended up here with Bill, Norma, Miranda and another friend for dinner this past weekend. NFL playoffs on all the screens in the house and the place is packed. I'm not expecting much as far as customer service goes however our server proved me wrong.  I forget his name but he was on the ball. Friendly, efficient and even caught a mistake made by the kitchen. No worries though as he adjusted the bill even before presenting it.  I had pizza and beer - which didn't disappoint. Beer was cold and pizza was hot - toppings galore and not burnt.  Typical BJ's experience. For me that is. It seems."
Marie M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/7/2016,"Let me start by saying our server was a nice guy. However, the service wasn't very good at all. We had to ask for refills during our entire meal. He often would walk past our table without acknowledging us. And no, it wasn't busy. Ordered the rib eye. It was ok. The asparagus was way too peppery and had more flavor than the steak. Save the money and stick with a pizza. I get better service at the McDonalds across the street. Still waiting for our bill ... ok just went down to 1 star ..."
Silvia I.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/6/2016,Excellent food and service!! I come here a lot snd the servers sre great! They never disappoint me!
Kristin W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",35,5,,1.0,11/11/2016,Horrible food and service .. we had to send food back and also hamburgers came out without the French fries and you would think the manager would at least offer to give something on the house since 4 meals were not good ! I will never go there again
Courtney C.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",486,451,300,3.0,2/3/2014,"I mean, it's good. Pretty good even. But it's a chain so I'm just never going to be a huge fan.  This BJ's gets surprisingly really crowded, probably because Rancho Santa Margarita is not swimming with an excess of lots of restaurants. I say that with love - I went to junior high and high school in the area so I know. I would've loved this place in high school - would've been a spot I sat at with all my friends and didn't order much on weekend nights after football games.  The food - if you've been to a BJ's before, you'll know. Giant, pretty delicious deep dish pizzas. Pretty solid in terms of what you can get in California deep dish pizza wise (though Chicago-ans would scoff). I try to stay away from those most days unless I'm splurging. What I've been getting recently when I go (because it's one of not too many options for a sit-down dinner in RSM) is the Ahi salad. It's on the Light & Lean or Weight Management or something like that menu but is actually pretty delicious. Solid Ahi and lots of avocado - two of my favorite things. I usually top that off with a seasonal beer and call it a meal :)  Pizzookies are delicious for dessert. Again, don't go near them most days due to trying to eat healthy. But hey, for a splurge, BJ's could be your place."
Robert D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",11,10,8,5.0,5/3/2016,"The buffalo chicken sandwich is delicious. I'm not sure if it's new, but I haven't seen it before. The Hefeweizen draft is always a must as well!"
Melissa K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/23/2016,"Horrible service!!!!! I don't know how they are still open. Multiple times we have had bad service while eating in so we stayed away. Recently our school hosted a fundraiser here so we decided to give it another try. We ordered curbside and when we got home, our whole order was messed up--some of it missing entirely. I called and they sent me a $25 courtesy card. We went back today to use it and they messed up even worse then the previous time. Luckily I didn't get all the way home before we realized it but by the time we got back there and home again our food was cold and our appetites were gone. They credited our meal but after all of the back and forth and frustration, it doesn't really even matter. The food was awful by then and we won't ever go back. Such a bummer."
Dottie S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,4,,2.0,5/20/2016,"I enjoy the food, but the service is slow.  Shame on you for not seating your guests in order of arrival. We were a party of two and they took larger parties ahead of us for the larger tables. They tried to claim it was guests who called ahead, but one of the parties was our friends (who arrived after us and were seated before us) and when I asked them, the did NOT call ahead.  When I asked the manager about their policy, he quickly rushed me out of the busy reception area and immediately found us a table.  Very unhappy customer."
Katee L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,21,1.0,9/16/2016,"one star for the beer and pizookie, slow service and bad, too! asked for plates and gave me a bunch of water-soaked plates. did not give us utensils as well, had to ask for some. they probably expected us to eat pizookie using our fingers. their service is just horrible!!!!"
Mark N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",7,86,110,3.0,1/31/2015,"I had the bison burger and an appropriately-named Tatanka stout.  I realize this is a nationwide chain that prides itself on the consistency of its offerings, but truth be told, I would stick to the beverages here.  The bison burger was heavily laden with dressings, presumably to disguise the unfamiliar taste of bison and that is common practice elsewhere.  The associated salad was anything but fresh.  The store manager was very courteous and took a genuine interest in the diners.  The atmosphere was also good--clean and contemporary.  Please improve the menu."
Risya L.,"Elk Grove, CA",286,570,753,2.0,10/19/2013,"This place really needs to pay attention to it's reviews. Their service here really really bombs!  The food is just okay, I had the potstickers and they just taste like the ones I get at Costco, that I can fry and make at home.   Though I am a big fan of their Feta and Watermelon salad, so delicious, and I get that it's a small bites item, but the fact that I only got 2 fork bites out of it seems a little ridiculious.  This portion seemed a LOT smaller then the first time I tried it.   My friend had the Lettuce chicken wraps, you get a small soup cup of mixed over sauced/salty grossness.  Service is always terribly slow...even when theres only like 5 tables in the whole place. Someone really needs to focus on Customer Service, then work on food.  I know kind of backwards but so true. This place would be a great place to go to after a long days work, especially since we don't get off until 11 sometimes.  But we just don't because we know it will take forever to be helped."
William H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/17/2016,Great service from amber but fish and chips just ok beer great I will be back  lots of tvs  motorcycle parking available my friend likes the lettuce wraps and rib app  enjoy go kings go
Jimbo T.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",5,162,3,2.0,12/7/2015,Weak service.  They are so inconsistent here.  They had been improving for quite sometime but things have slipped again.  Poor service checking back with us.  Made a mistake on my son's pizza and put on their signature tomatoes.  They took it back and brought the same pizza out with the tomatoes picked off.  You could see where the tomatoes had been in the melted cheese!  Glad he didn't notice.  Placed our desert order wrong and then still charged us to basically fix the mistake.  I love the chain but this location is very poor.
Rich S.,"Lake Forest, CA",71,13,,4.0,2/8/2016,"It's been a couple of weeks, but I wanted to comment on the leadership of manager Kevin Ives.  We ordered some food through Door Dash, and out special instructions were explicit, but the food was delivered wrong. We ate it anyways, but decided to call just to lodge the complaint. Kevin send us gift certificates for our next visit. He handled the errors properly, and while that should be the proper way of managing a restaurant - it doesn't always happen.  We will return."
Clea L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,4,,4.0,3/16/2016,"The manager here is awesome-he is always checking on customers and answering questions. And one time when our service was slow, he gave us a coupon for our next visit. That's good customer service!"
