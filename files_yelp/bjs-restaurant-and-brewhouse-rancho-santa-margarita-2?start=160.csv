Tessa T.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2015,"Horrible! We came for brunch and it was a huge disappointment. I shouldn't be surprised though, it always is. We were overcharged, one of the ""scrambled eggs"" came out green, and over all it was just disgusting. Never again!"
Ariel D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",19,6,,5.0,10/15/2015,"Ever since this BJ's opened near my house I was so excited that I no longer had to drive to Laguna hills to eat there. It amazes me how over the countless times I've been here even on busy Friday and Saturday nights I have never had to wait and am always seated immediately. Not like they aren't busy as there are always people filling the restaurant and bar area, they find a seat for you and your party in minutes. Food and service is fast but delicious. Whether you go in for some avocado egg rolls or a steak everything BJ's has to offer is great quality and delish. Don't forget to try there cookies and cream pizookie:) Highly recommend giving this place a try."
Michael J.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",16,22,37,2.0,9/28/2014,Service slow again. friend ordered salman salad with ranch. Order came no salmon some rasberry dressing. My  wife ordered salad and soup for dinner and it came came out 5 minutes later and was supposed to be delayed. Salad was dresseed and wife wanted it in the side. Good news chicken wings were good. Waiter had to apolgize 4 times. Kitchen needs some attention to detail. Seems like this happens often.
Monica O.,"Orange, CA",0,9,1,5.0,3/29/2017,"honestly, this is one of the best BJs around! it reminds me most of the first restaurant i grew up going to (in Corona) so it's a bit nostalgic. only ever had one wishy-washy server during lunchtime. every other server has gone above and beyond! whenever we have any issues with the food or service, it is acknowledged and addressed properly. last night, we had Tara as a server after dinner rush. her entire demeanor is so energetic and beautiful! the entire staff here is so helpful and friendly. and you can't be mad at a restaurant that always offers promotions and coupons. keep it up, RSM!"
Kelli S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,3,1,4.0,2/28/2016,"I enjoy BJ's I go to many of their locations across the country. I recently relocated and there is a BJ's across from my place, they get terrible reviews at this location for service but I must strongly disagree... The staff at this BJ's location were on top of things and very friendly. Excellent!"
Allen H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",173,35,318,5.0,12/31/2014,The food was great service was good Giovanny I had to get his name kept stopping by and making sure our party has everything we needed
Karen J.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",43,3,1,1.0,11/6/2015,"If I could give no stars I would. We used to frequent BJ'S but the service has been so horrible between orders being messed up, waiting over an hour to get food, no refills on drinks... we rarely come and each time going it will get better and it does not improve. My daughter's got spaghetti for their entrée asked if they could get a piece of bread server said they don't have any and the garlic knots are $1 each. Wow. Not accommodating at all. After getting 3 pizzas that came out with incorrect toppings last time, and making 2 kids wait over an hour for food the time before that, I doubt we will be back. So sad."
Tyler B.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,11,1,2.0,11/16/2014,"Meh-friendly service so I can't say anything negative about that.. However, from the past few times that I've been here, the kitchen can get pretty overwhelmed when it's even mildly busy, and this is most evident in the quality of food and waiting time from ordering to receiving food. I ordered the bison burger, which the patty came extremely charred.. And my girlfriend ordered the chicken pita tacos-posted is the obliterated pita. Not stoked on coming here ever again"
Robert S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/8/2015,"Very disappointed with the decline of this restaurant. Once a very nice place to dine. The last time we went there we ordered the famed calamari.  They cut back the portion and claimed it was just a smaller plate. I know the difference.  Then I ordered a hamburger and it was well done and I ordered it medium rare and the bun was like a brick and my wife ordered pot stickers and they were ice cold inside.  Now the nice manager apologized and said we don't owe anything, but that's not the point, the meal was ruined and we were still starving."
Michael B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",18,49,40,5.0,11/26/2014,The BJ's Favorite pizza and Atlantic salmon (get it blackened) are consistently exceptional. I'm partial to the Belgian Gulden Draak...strong brown ale. Service was very attentive.
federico n.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",18,5,15,1.0,10/18/2015,After 1-1/2hr of waiting checked up on wait list. Was told they texted cell phone but did not rcvd anything. So they gave our seats. No mgmt f/u. Honestly pizza is overrated anyway. Never more
B A.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",393,38,26,5.0,9/13/2015,"BJ's has stepped up their game! This is a great spot for happy hour drinks/appetizers, a family dinner, or even a date night out to watch the big game.  They've updated their menu to look more like the Cheesecake Factory's book, and they extend their happy hour to include football games.  The staff is ridiculously nice, and you're sure to have a great time!"
Alex B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",5,12,7,5.0,9/11/2015,"We have been BJ's fans for a long time. We used to drive from Rancho Santa Margarita to Laguna Hills, and it was worth the drive.  The RSM location has finally settled in,  and we are really enjoying the experience! The food and service are great. Kevin (mgr) is pulling together an excellent team!"
Elaine T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",6,8,,5.0,3/7/2015,Compliments to Al the General Manager for his excellent customer service and to our server Maya who made our meal a great experience. Her attitude and concern for our needs was outstanding.  Roger and Elaine
Jennifer M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,33,,3.0,5/25/2015,"The review really depends on the day/time you go. If they are busy, don't even go in, the service will be very slow and you're going to be disappointed. One time they took an hour to get my daughter her gluten free pizza, I guess they kept giving it to other people.  We've come a few times when it's been busy, it's always been slow and frustrating.  When it isn't busy, service has been great! Food is good, pretty quick also. Maybe they just need better management when it comes to the busy times.  Our favorite foods are the wings, love the really spicy ones, and they are REALLY spicy!! Gluten free pizza and pizookie is absolutely amazing!!  This is a great place for lunch or an early dinner."
Cleo J.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/14/2015,"Went to BJ's over the weekend and had a good time there. The margaritas were great and the food tasted really delicious as well.  Something happened with our seating and server, so things took a really long time to get going. The next server put in was very helpful and wanted to ensure that the rest of the night went smoothly. I really liked how the manager was attentive and made sure everything was okay throughout the rest of the night. Wish I knew about this location sooner!"
Pups J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,16,,5.0,9/21/2015,"Came here for Happy Hour and Monday Night Football. Service was great- quick and efficient service by George.  George was very patient explaining the new menu  ( new to us!) and making sure he had our order correct. He checked back with us many times to ensure we were happy.  I ordered the slider's on the Happy Hour menu.  Very tasty!  The food was served hot and fast.  My husband ordered the Root Beer glazed chicken wings and the Lemon pepper sesame chicken wings-he loved them.  The bar area is full with plenty of wait staff and dishes were removed promptly when finished.  All in all, a great experience."
Joan W.,"Silverado, CA",1,23,,2.0,1/6/2016,Just terrible service! This is the 3rd time at this BJ's and it's been hit or miss each time. Twice a bad experience with terrible service. Laguna Hills is much better and worth the drive which we'll do from now on.
Lindsay P.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",4,31,12,1.0,6/19/2014,"Had quite possibly the worst experience lately. BJ's just can't pull it together. Minus the awesome bartenders and BJ's premier rewards, there aren't a whole lot of redeeming qualities. Food always takes a long time to come out and in most cases something is wrong. The food is also never consistent! We ordered a pizookie and timed it - it took 45 minutes before I finally asked about it. The bartender told me they gave the pizookie to the wrong table. Weird because we were at the bar. They brought us out a new one 5 minutes later and that one WAS completely raw. So frustrating. Management and the kitchen need to figure it out! Absolutely disappointing."
Jeffrey L.,"Anaheim, CA",11,18,,1.0,11/18/2015,"I wish I could rate ZERO stars! I woke up this morning, after having had BJ's last night, with terrible food poisoning. Vomiting and diarrhea for the past 3 hours. I feel so horrible. NEVER go to this BJ's EVER!"
