Andy J.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",30,2,3,1.0,5/11/2014,This location is the worst BJ's go to the one in laguna much better.  - strange creepy girl that greets you. Waitress was nice all the food was wrong third time I have been there and the same thing. The manager lady said I need to ask for tomato sauce on my pizza. I thought all pizzas have sauce there was none. pizza was more like cheese bread. When I asked for some sauce on the side it came cold...wth The only thing good here was the beer. But if you are desperately hungry you can for sure get your meal comped because they will mess it up and if you want tomato sauce on your pizza like normal pizza places  the manager lady with the raspy voice said to ring a bell three times. She even told me go to the other Bj's in laguna hills they have better service. Don't go here!
Margarita C.,"Laguna Beach, CA",2,11,3,1.0,12/9/2015,"Hate to give this place a bad review., but had to because of all these horrible menu changes! Can't believe they changed up the happy hour! This was our go to for football, basketball games and just late night cravings! Not only was I sad to see their happy hour prices go up, but they went up on multiple items on their menu!!!"
Jamie W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",680,959,356,2.0,6/12/2012,"At first, I was this locations biggest cheerleader. I thought a lot of the negative reviews were over exaggerated by people who don't really Yelp and just wanted to bitch. I had a good dine-in experience the first time and have gotten take out on quite a few occasions since. No major problems. Lately though... BJ's needs to get their act together.  On several occasions I've brought home food only to find that things aren't made properly or there are key components missing. I mean, who wants a Cobb salad that's missing the turkey, bacon and croutons? I think that's just called a garden salad, no? Another time, there was barely any salad in my tray. For $11. No joke. it was the size of a side salad with a few sparse ingredients sprinkled on.  Last week was the final straw. We ordered two salads to share for dinner and come home to find our Italian chop salad to be missing ALL of the meat and cheese and Cobb salad to be missing a couple of other things. Furious, but holding it together, I call and let them know. The MANAGER states that ""it's not even on the menu anymore"" and that the ingredients aren't all available. I told her she shouldn't have sold it then.  They refunded my money but the manager was not at all professional, made excuses and was condescending. Because I love the BJ's brand and wonder what the hell is going on with this location, I'm going to contact their head office and let them know that there are some major problems going on here.  I'll let y'all know what I find out."
Sara M.,"Tustin, CA",4,26,3,2.0,4/22/2014,"Much as the other reviewers have written... service is really lacking.  Our server (who I will not name - it could be any of you servers...) never came by to see if the food was acceptable or to refill our waters.  Slow night but felt ignored.   We ordered extra cheese on the pizza and were charged for extra cheese but it most certainly was not added.  The pizza was extremely salty and very disappointing.  Pizza Hut pizza is more palatable than BJs pizza is.  In all fairness on rating the food, the Tomato Bisque soup was outstanding and HOT!   We thought about talking to the manager, but didn't want the waitress to get in trouble.  Hopefully the manager will pay attention to the multiple complaints about the poor customer service and demand better of his staff.  This restaurant may be close to home, but we'd rather drive a bit to get better service elsewhere.   On a side note - lots of yelling kids.  Parents, just because you had them, doesn't mean everyone else wants to listen to them screaming.  Control your children or take them to McDonalds.  Everyone should be respectful to the people around them, not just worry about your own table and experience."
Kathryn F.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,3,,5.0,11/5/2015,Love the food and the fact they are open late!   Went to see the new James Bond movie and pizza ... a great combination ... Thanks. ..
Trish L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",107,295,18,4.0,9/25/2015,"BJ's is pretty good. Love the $20 deal with 2 salads, pizza, and a pizookie. They have a very good selection of beers an ciders that are not too expensive. Service here is fine."
Em H.,"Garden Grove, CA",16,91,153,2.0,9/23/2014,"Came here on Saturday at 11 p.m. because most restaurants closed early at the mission. I knew the food wasn't great here so I ordered calamari, desert, and drinks. My bf ordered pizza and it was soggy. When he picked up slices there were grease on the plate. The person who dropped of food plopped on the table. Rude! Waitress was really not attentive.   Tried their peanut butter marshmallow desert...it was average. Too sweet. I wouldn't coming back for the food...probably just for drinks."
Ginny T.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",10,10,,2.0,6/2/2016,"I love BJ'S food....Always consistently good, but the service here was awful. I came in for a late lunch/early dinner with my 2 sisters.  We were seated immediately, and offered a table, but asked for a booth.  The hostess sighed, but moved us to a booth (let me note it was a little after 4 so the restaurant had 2 other tabletops and that was it, except for 4-5 ppl at the bar.). So we waited for someone to greet us and take a drink/food order.  We waited over 10 minutes, while watching various employees wander back & forth with no apparent purpose.  My sister then had to ask the hostess to find a server for us.  Another sigh & no apology for the extended wait, no urgency on her part to fulfill our (routine) request.  After another 5 minutes, a male server, who obviously didn't want to be there,  took our drink order... 2 sodas & a pina colada.  The colada sat for so long before being delivered, it was watery.  We then ordered the food & it finally came, after about another 15 minutes (2 burgers & small pizza) by a different person.  Our original server came by to see if all was ""ok"" after another 15 minutes, and that was the last we saw of him.  I don't know if there was a shift change, but a different server took care if us, with no explanation.  It took forever for someone to stop by so we could order dessert and to finally get it.  We then had to ask for the bill. I know people don't always have their dream job, and that makes it hard to do a consistently good job,  but that many disengaged people on one shift made us feel unwelcome and that we were a nuisance!   All in all, I don't know if I would go back to this location..."
Michelle R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",16,17,8,5.0,8/30/2015,"Came here last night to meet up a girlfriend for a late night drink. We had the best server, Brendan, super nice, quick, and not to mention funny. My friend already ordered a drink before I arrived so as I was looking what to order from the mojito selections, Brendan, recommended the watermelon mojito. GREAT choice! Not overly sweet, not too light or strong, and super refreshing with bits of watermelon meat in the drink! Then we decided to order a small pizza with pineapple, cheese, and tomatoes. Came out very quickly (wasn't too busy). Good pizza, not great. We then ordered a second round of drinks, she ordered a Stella and I asked Brendan about any fruity beers they had and he made another recommendation of a berry beer, and again...another great choice! I wish I could remember the name! We then checked out and were happy gals. He gave us an exceptional experience. Thanks Brendan!"
Brendan M.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",234,5,,3.0,1/1/2016,"The food as a whole is pretty good, with a few dishes being rather exceptional (avocado egg rolls are a must every time), but the prices are a bit out of whack, even for Orange County. The service here is really hit or miss, and from my experience, the waiters and waitresses are all extremely nice and professional, but there are times when they just can't keep up, whether they are understaffed or there is a kitchen issue I don't know. Could be a risk going here if you're on a semi-tight schedule."
Jonathan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/12/2015,We had a really awesome experience and it was all because of our server Alex Fiore. We were sitting in the cocktail area and her service was the best I've had at this restaurant. You need more people like Alex!!!!
Jay A.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,8,,1.0,4/2/2016,"Came in at 11:45 pm they told me I had plenty of time, I ordered the rib eye medium and the monkey bread, the steak took twenty minutes and it came out raw.  Bartender said they could re cook it better.  Had to wait and ask for refills while I waited for the redo.  Steak finally came out medium well/well done.  I just ate it and hoped the monkey bread would make me feel better then the sub par service even tho I was the only customer there besides two off duty employees.  The monkey bread came out burnt, I was told it was my fault cause of the steak not being cooked right.  They asked me if I still wanted another one?  I said yes please and tried to get another drink while I waited.  Unfortunately the bar was now closed even though no one announced last call.  I asked why she would not say anything and the bartender responded with we don't close at two am so there's technically no last call.  Bravo.  Total bill was $69, pretty expensive for the quality of service and lack of interest in my experience.  Definitely not a BJS I'd recommend at all."
Erik F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",815,66,329,5.0,3/2/2014,"Came for lunch after first trying to have Thai, but finding the place closed. We often go to this BJ's and overall have great experiences - food, service, price. We use a rewards card, have a coupon and gift card so our back up choice wasn't too difficult. The kids got the kids pizza - one cheese and one pepperoni. Both are just like the adult version - fresh, hot and so tasty. I bribed my daughter into sharing some with me by offering to get a Pizookie for dessert.  Meal is $5.95 and includes drink. Good deal in my book.  My wife and I shared new Enlightened items - Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad. They both sounded great. The tacos did not disappoint, but the salad did somewhat. The tacos tasted good with the grilled chicken, cucumber, tomato, red onion, cilantro and a mild feta and Greek yoghurt sauce, not tzaziki, but more creamy and plain. The side was some type of grain salad, maybe tabouleh - very good and bit spicy. The salad was okay. It has romaine, blueberries, grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, pecans, pepitas, red onion and strawberry vinaigrette. The ingredient sound great, but didn't have as much wow factor as I was hoping for. Could use more of the non-salad ingrediants especially cheese and nuts. Also, I was disappointed that the brussel sprouts were not warm. I expected them warm since they are roasted. Besides that they were not cooked or seasoned enough. I know it's supposed to be light, but these should be sautéed in some OO which is a healthy fat. I really like the burnt Brussels at Cucina Enoteca. They would go great here. You can add chicken, shrimp or blackened salmon. Any of those probably would have brought the salad up a star. Emily was a great server and she was taking care of lots of tables. Then comes the pizookie - as always, super good and gone in 60 seconds. Regular chocolate chip soft, gooey and with vanilla ice cream.  So nice to have BJs 10 minute walk away."
Jeff B.,"Tustin, CA",0,28,3,5.0,11/8/2015,"Love BJ's.  Fun atmosphere, attentive staff, and a wide variety of choices on the menu.  True gem in RSM.  We go here frequently."
Jessica W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/26/2015,"My friends and I come to this spot frequently, and Alexa always takes cares of us! Her lemon drops literally taste like heaven in my mouth. She's rad as shit."
Kayla Q.,"Irvine, CA",99,266,203,3.0,7/7/2014,"3.5 stars. Such an improvement from the Fridays that used to be here! Fun bar to sit in to watch a game or happy hour. I love the Asian chicken salad, and obvi the pizza here is super bomb!"
Manda P.,"Dana Point, CA",1,6,,4.0,5/31/2014,"Okay, so I'm starting to wonder if maybe they got new management.  My boyfriend and I returned to this bjs about a week ago, because it was the only thing that was still open with a variety.  The service was good, the food was good, I have nothing to complain about.  I love soup, and I always loved getting the chicken tortilla from bjs. In laguna hills, the bring out a bowl with avocado, tortilla strips and all the other goodies and pour your soup over it at the table in front of you. They didn't do this at the rsm location about 6 months ago, but they did the other night which impressed me.  New management?"
Jennifer B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/20/2015,"The service here is terrible. I ordered food to go three times and each time they have gotten my order wrong. Tonight, they messed up my pizza order and I caught it before I left so I waited another 10 minutes for them to make a new pizza. The manager comp'd the meal for us which I thought was nice. I asked her if everything with the rest of the order is correct and she said yes. I drove home only to unpack our order and realize they gave me the wrong sandwich even though it had a computer generated sticker on the top with what the sandwich should be. So frustrating that they lack attention to detail to double check the things they are sending out to customers. I've had similar experiences with the dining in the restaurant as well. If you are craving BJ's, go to the one in Laguna and stay far away from this one."
Anthony A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",779,1013,99,2.0,12/6/2011,"I was ecstatic when I learned the decrepit, white trash haven known as T.G.I.Friday's was being razed to make room for a brand-spankin' new BJ's. Then I found out they're both owned by the same company. Meh, whatever. As long as they don't rehire the same barrel-scraped rejects from the old guard I'll be satisfied. So far, so good.  I avoided this spot for a few weeks until the locals could get the excitement of a new restaurant out of their system. One of my friends was in town, so we decided to hit up the bar for lunch. Seating was no problem in the bar area; there was a short wait for tables, though. This location is slightly smaller than the Lake Forest one, but they've somehow managed to squeeze in more TVs - perfect for a sports-hater like myself. We got a pitcher of Hefeweizen and annoyed our waiter by spending more time drinking/talking than looking at the menu. Once we finally did, I noticed it's essentially the same as most of their locations, so I got my usual favorite: balsamic glazed chicken.  In the interim, we sucked down the pitcher and I got a Bloody Mary. The waiter asked if I was sure, warning me it was spicy. It was not. When I told him that, he said ""some lady told him it was too hot"". Figures. Haha. It was pretty damn good, though. I thought the garnishment of a green bean, pepper and olive was a nice touch. I might have to make this my Sunday morning spot. Here's a big problem I've got with this location: the food sucks. I've eaten this dish a dozen times at other BJs and it was always delicious, but not this time. To quote the Simpsons, my chicken ""tasted like burning"", but not in a hot way; it was a ""we burned the shit out of this chicken and don't care"" way. The mashed potatoes were dry enough that I could've mistaken them for white sand. I didn't even bother with the onion rings, which looked limp and sad. I still ate it all because I was hungry, it was edible and I didn't feel like dicking around with the massive menu again. I'm more than likely going to be back here, so I'll be able to give something else a shot, but so far the only thing that did me right was the alcohol."
Dani L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",17,15,6,3.0,7/21/2015,"We love this place because it's casual and has a wide variety of food. However, this location seems to be super slow. The last three times we have been here either our food, drinks, or waitress have taken (what seems like) forever.  It's a bit frustrating."
