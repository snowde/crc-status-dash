Allison B.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",1,74,2,5.0,4/18/2015,"We used to go to BJ's regularly but after several disastrous experiences (and we are not high maintenance), we started going elsewhere. Friends suggested we go with the kids for dinner on Friday 10th April. Let's just say my expectations were not high. Well I was very pleasantly surprised!! Our server was Briesa, she was intelligent, flawless, very personable, just an all around a great server.  The food was also very good, tasty and arrived in a reasonable timeframe, and all at the same time. It seems there may have been a shake-up at this location. Anyway we were very happy and left quite satisfied. My family will give BJ's another chance and hopefully they will become out 'go-to' place again."
Eric J.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",222,18,7,1.0,1/18/2015,"The worst customer service I have ever received from a chain restaurant. Not only was the waitress uninterested in our order and rude, but the manager seemed to be completely aloof of the issues plaguing his establishment. Must have been too busy smoking in front of the restaurant to be bothered with trivial issues like customer service. Avoid!"
Chloe H.,"Tustin, CA",26,48,12,5.0,8/19/2015,"A friend and I headed here on a Thursday night after work to do some much needed catching up over happy hour, the bar area is open seating and was packed (we go the last table). We were greeted right away by a super awesome server and ordered a bunch of things off the happy hour menu, everything was delicious! Definitely try the deep fried artichoke hearts (these are regular menu) and the avocado egg rolls! We also got the pizza, spinach and artichoke dip and sliders, everything came out fast and you could say we cleared our plates ;). I loved the watermelon Mojito and my friend got the strawberry mojto, both super tasty! Our sever came by right before happy hour was over and asked if we wanted another drink before happy hour ended! I thought that was super nice as she could of not cared about it! This will be a regular after dinner happy hour spot for sure."
Em B.,"San Clemente, CA",15,6,13,5.0,10/17/2013,"This is where the old Friday's used to be.  I've been to plenty BJ's but find this one to be the best...  No, seriously.  Every new server I get becomes my new favorite person in the world.  Think they'd notice if I moved myself into the restroom and made it my new home?"
Lynzee M.,"Irvine, CA",139,66,46,4.0,3/22/2015,We had great service on this trip.  We sat ourselves in the bar which is the best for fast service if your in a small group.  I had received a rewards appetizer and decided to use it.  We got a salad and an appetizer and split it.  I like that they don't charge a split fee because we are small girls and can't eat a lot.  We got the chicken wings which are always good and the fit mango salad.  My personal favorite.  Dressing in the side and split and they got our order correct
Eric M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",32,3,,4.0,4/28/2013,"All these 1-2 star reviews are confusing. The pizza is always fantastic. The appetizers are good. The beer selection is good and reasonably priced. Staff is always friendly. They have a great happy hour, which is almost always packed. I've tried a few regular menu items (some burger, some ribs), and both delivered exactly what one would expect in the $10-20 range. Not the best food ever, but still tasty.  Sure, an order may come out wrong or too slow every now and then. Then again, it is just a BJ's. The staff look like local highschool/college folk. If you absolutely demand some absurd level of service you should be willing and able to pay a couple hundred a plate. Anterooms with cigars and rad liquors served by dapper butler dudes whilst you wait for your table, check (no walk ins). Personal attendants for each party, you got it. Career servers who will do anything for your satisfaction, yup.  But we're talkin about a BJ's. Take it for what it is...a pizza/beer joint that got dressed up all nice. In this respect, mission accomplished."
Marta H.,"Irvine, CA",4,11,5,4.0,4/24/2015,"We appreciate how consistent BJ's is with prompt service and good food. There is a lot of variety on the menu, gluten-free options for those who need it. When a group is going out we like it as there is something to please every person's taste. They accommodate kids well."
Marianne W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",7,22,,2.0,6/1/2015,"I come here often but I have to say it is not my favorite place.  The food is not bad but 90% of the time the service is just terrible.  Everything seems to take forever and I think the waiters/waitress disappear into a portal to intentionally keep you guessing where they are at.  I have complained to the manager and have seen countless others do the same so I am at a loss why it does not get resolved.  And no, I don't want a free pizookie because it took and hour to get my salad.  Ugh."
Jessika B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,23,5,5.0,7/20/2015,I am a server and I'm super critical when it comes to service. I am blown away by the amazing serve we got tonight here. I have a 1 yr old who is so picky about eating and our server just keeps bringing him things to try and she is just so wonderful. People usually hate when kids sit in their section so I was blown away by this treatment. You rock Tara!!!!
Samantha M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",334,5,1,5.0,1/30/2014,Came here for some late night happy hour. Got the sliders and flatbread then our server Ricky twisted our arms into getting a pizookie. Never disappoints. Our drinks were never empty...our server anticipated our needs and kept us happy and even had a sense of humor at the end of the night when he was probably ready to get off of work and close the place down.   Be back soon!
Craig P.,"Lake Forest, CA",12,10,,4.0,2/14/2014,"We frequent this BJ's a bit more than the Laguna Hills one (which is a bit closer) for a couple of reasons: 1. It is actually faster to get to, and in and out, and home than the LH restaurant. They do pretty good at getting the orders correct (we use 99% take out), only once having them really back up and keep take out people waiting (which, at 30 minutes late was worth noting, but once out of 20+ times ordering isn't a trend) 2. We just have received better food there. I don't order pizza there any longer (coming from Chicago, there are much better ""Chicago style"" places in Orange County), so we usually have pasta, salads, and appetizers. Generally speaking, the food is usually cooked well. I do agree with others that it can get really crowded, and can be a bit expensive, but overall I would give them a higher than average rating, but not an exceptional one."
Matt W.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",3,8,,5.0,11/13/2014,"I came in Tuesday morning and had the best service ever.  Our server Brian was helpful, fast and made the overall experience great! First time my dinning experience has been great at BJ's."
Tom B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",11,4,,2.0,7/17/2015,No more corn fritters. No more me coming to BJ. It was the only reason I put up with the slow service and poor house beers.
Michael H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,11,,3.0,7/16/2015,Its a decent spot to grab lunch or dinner and is fairly priced! I would say the food is a 7/10. Its tasty but not amazing!
Lori M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",6,16,9,1.0,7/30/2013,"WORST SERVICE EVER! I can't imagine what is wrong with our waiter. Our food was taking a long time so I asked if he could check on it. He made a face like ""whatever"" and continued to ignore us. Another server brought our food. I has shrimp tacos and the tortillas were over cooked and tough. No one has offered to refill drinks or even stopped by. I guess we'll have to flag someone down for a bill. This restaurant has so much potential. Great location and not much competition. I guess that allows them to be consistently sub-par!"
Mark B.,"El Toro, CA",0,22,15,5.0,8/5/2015,What's not to love!!! Their brew is fantastic. I come for the pizza but their BISON BURGER is excellent. Can't leave without eating a pizookie!!  I ALWAYS bring my out of town guests here for dinner/lunch.
Jayson O.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",148,178,157,3.0,7/9/2013,"I've been here a few times now since it's initial opening and can say it's been a slow, but at least persistent in terms of improving but still has a way to go. It's hard to put a finger on exactly what the issue is, but if I had to garner a wager, it would be my belief that this locations mentality is ""turnkey, turnkey, turnkey"", because this place is pretty darn busy most of the time (probably because one thing RSM lacks in is quality, family restaurants).  However, this translates into a rushed kitchen, and a rushed kitchen tends crank out food, assembly line style, and thus quality control suffers. This was evident the other evening when our large pizza came out to our table, luke warm, and not cooked in the middle (i.e. raw dough).  Easy fix,...waiter was very friendly and apologetic, no questions asked to get us another one...but it even took longer to get than the first one.  On the plus side, this one was done and tasted great, but the re-fire of 30 minutes made for an uneven experience as the other guests at our table had finished their meal by the time the second pizza came out. For once, I tried something off the 'light-menu'.  I had the BBQ Bison Burger (550 cal, $9.95) and was very pleased.  It was actually very tasty, and I give a thumbs up to the calorie conscience slaw. Appetizers to our table included the potato skins, which were in fact both crispy and not very greasy (something you normally don't expect with this dish), so thumbs up here as well. Service was above average.  We scored a fine young man who checked on us constantly. So the drawbacks?  Feels somewhat chaotic and loud in there at times, and you can't help but feel like they are in-fact rushing you at times to get you back out the door.  Over the course of the handful of times I've been there, there has also been at least something wrong with one or more dishes....either cold, sometimes missing items, substitution requests ignored, etc...Like I said, the kitchen expediter isn't paying attention and just pushing stuff out.  Slow down, read the tickets, double check, and things should improve."
Rani D.,"FOOTHILL RANCH, CA",19,48,2,1.0,3/31/2013,"Went on Easter And was pretty empty, but seemed too much for the servers with 2 tables. Beverages and appetizers came out, but pizza now has changed and so ask questions... Beware: both staff and management said BJS is changing. Less sauce on pizza, minced veggies (disappointing), ranch dressing is now from a bottle and no more ""thank you"" mints at the door.  RSM's store is aesthetically eye pleasing, but service, food quality, and hit or miss service makes me wish Selma's was open on Easter.   Corporates are making a great place below average and poor quality wise at the expense for a profit."
Laura L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,101,13,1.0,5/6/2013,"No.  Seriously, just no.  I had to come for a certain non-profit meeting I am involved in.  I had to order my iced tea 3 times.  And refills?  Fuhgeddaboudit.  We finally suggested carafes- and they came out a bit later- like 20 mins later!  A co-volunteer had to remind the staff serving us several times about his meal.  That took forever.  Seriously, we all ordered at the same time.  We have no idea what took so long to get his flat bread.  FLATBREAD!   Mine came out without the cheese- which is fine.  I didn't need it.  The flatbread was fine without it.  But it was missing a key ingredient.  How does that happen? Oh yeah.  It's The World's Worst BJ's ever.  That's how."
Shelby P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,9,3,1.0,9/8/2016,"I've tried coming here on many different occasions and every single time the service is absolutely terrible. I had a server that wouldn't bring me silverware even after I asked three times. Our drinks were never refilled. He never checked on us. Maybe he was new. I tried this place again with some of my family. It took 15 minutes before we were greeted by our server. Again no refills on drinks from her either and she made us feel super uncomfortable when she was serving the table next to us. She was super friendly with them and asked if they needed boxes, suggested a dessert, and then asked if she could bring the bill. When we were about done eating she said nothing and just dropped off the check. I'm not sure why this happened. We were a super easy table, super calm, and relaxed . I'm also a server so I'm very lenient when it comes to service . For whatever the reason though, this place is always horrible . Always ."
