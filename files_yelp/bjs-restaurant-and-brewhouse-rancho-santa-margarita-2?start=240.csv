Kim M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",258,250,10,2.0,11/6/2014,"Same old same old BJ's.  Service stinks, food is blah......just a nice place to have a drink & catch a little Sunday football after a baseball game that has no crowd & no wait because the food is just ok........"
Alice S.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,34,10,5.0,2/13/2015,"We love BJ's but recently had a problem w/ on line ordering, called the restaurant and talked to Al, he was amazing. Was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.   I appreciate a business who knows how to take care of their customers."
Z W.,"San Marcos, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/6/2015,"Well I should have checked yelp first and saved myself a horrible experience. As others have stated the service and management are really a joke. We came for the ribs and of course they where out!!!! We should have left but ordered something else. We waited 30 minutes for our food to come out. Then when it did come out my husbands steak was burnt and he asked for it medium. So back it went and another 25 minutes went by. No apologies, no manager stopping by, nothing.  So my son and I had completely finished our food before my husbands even hit the table!!!!! I'm sorry but the turn over of tables is relatively fast at a restaurant like this. If I a saw a couple with a 1 yr old at a table for over an hour and one person had no food while the others had eaten and they r trying to keep there child entertained as a manager I might check that everything is ok.  Nope!!! Nada!!!! That is too much to ask for. I can forgive sub par food but I honestly cannot handle terrible management. Needless to say we will not be returning to this bjs again!!!!!!"
Rebecca Mina A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",131,20,,2.0,9/7/2015,this location is REALLY unfortunate. the wait staff/management doesn't really seem to care and every time I've been here my food has come out before my drinks which is super annoying. maybe it's time for some costumer service training and definitely an extra set of hands behind the bar
Heather C.,"Orange County, CA",0,22,2,1.0,4/21/2013,"HORRIBLE CURBSIDE SERVICE EXPERIENCE. I usually have a good experience with BJ's in Orange County but the location in RSM was very disappointing to say the least. I placed a curbside order on 4/21/13. The young ladies that helped me were nice but just before leaving I noticed that my order was not correct. I had to call them back on the curbside number and point out that  that the baked potato I had order wasn't in the bag. I was then told that someone forgot to put the order in for the baked potato and that they were sorry about the error and they would fix it right away. So I decided to eat the sandwich I ordered while I was waiting and then noticed that it was missing the avocado and bacon. So this time I went into to tell them about the additional error. The young lady was sorry and said she would bring me the missing sandwich items right away. So I went back out to my vehicle to wait for the missing items.  After about 25mins of no signs of the missing baked potato or sandwich items I went inside again. The young lady apologized and went into the kitchen to check on the potato and get me the avocado. She returned after a few minutes with the most pitiful presentation of avocado I have ever seen. The last thing you want to see as a customer that has just spent an extra 30mins waiting for food that isn't correct on a supposed fast curbside pickup. Another worker walked the avocado into the back to ask for it be fixed and check on the hold up on the potato. After about 3 minutes she returned to tell me that a manager was coming to talk to me.  The manager finally arrived to inform me that they were now out of baked potatoes and that he was sorry. He offered to sub the potato for something else. At this point I was pretty much over the possibility of waiting for them to get me something else, especially with it taking over 15mins just to get a decent side of avocado. Which when was brought again was still lame but I was over the whole incident at this point. The manager ended up removing all my charges for the potato I never got and the sandwich, but honestly he should have offered something additional for the 40min wait time after I arrived at the curbside deliver area. BJ's you need to step up the level of customer service. Make sure your chefs are making an awesome presentation on everything especially for the orders that got botched by the staff. There are a ton of other restaurant choices in RSM and going forward this BJ's location probably won't even be a consideration of a place to eat."
Kevin J.,"Long Beach, CA",4,45,19,4.0,4/7/2013,"We have been here at least 10 times since they have opened and have yet to be disappointed (we only order pizza, apps, and salad). Reading so many horror stories is shocking due to my experiences here and the fact the place is ALWAYS packed. Last night was just like the previous trips here; great food, prompt and friendly service, cold beer, and an awesome server Salina! She was very courteous, friendly, and even got in the spirit of cracking jokes with our group! This place may have got off to a rocky start, but they seem to be coming around. Then again, this is RSM where the client is extremely tough to please...."
Jeff S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",210,649,344,4.0,12/18/2013,"I like this locations a lot more than others.   Bjs are good since they are all the same however this one just has a vibe that's a little more mellow than others.   Good pizzas and lots of options.  I always customize the pizzas.    You can sub different toppings.   If you don't want the mushrooms, change it up to garlic or basil.   That's what I do.  Beers on tap are good and not bad for the price."
Paula M.,"Lake Arrowhead, CA",68,33,,1.0,2/18/2016,"Used to do our girls night here weekly, 8 girls, food drinks etc. but it's just not run efficiently. The manager/owner (not sure which) is loud and rude and disciplines staff in front of customers, it's so embarrassing. He also comes across as very arrogant. Such a bummer as I love the Bj's at Laguna mall but it's a bit of a drive. We switched girls night to Hannas. They appreciate their customers and the management and staff are so respectful. Get your act together BJ's and start appreciating your staff and local customers. I have talked to many friends in the area who just stopped going to your place because of things mentioned above. It's kinda sad :("
Steve Q.,"Irvine, CA",125,10,,5.0,5/13/2015,My wife and I enjoy going to this resteraunt and have found the staff from the busboys to the Management very helpful and friendly. Can't say enough good things about them other than we truly have a Great time every time we go there.
Christine H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,2,,1.0,7/29/2014,Service is always terrible!  Hostess forgot to add name but gave us a buzzer.  Waitress took forever to get to table and food took forever! This is not the first time but it never fails this restaurant sucks!
Caroline D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/14/2016,"Came here to get a pizookie on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and our waiter was the rudest kid ever and it was very obvious he was just looking for a tip. Which I understand but that's not something you're gonna get when you treat your customers like shit. At the end of our stay after we dealt with his shortness and waited SO Long for our check (waters too) he even had the nerve to sarcastically shout goodbye to us as if he had deserved a tip!? Went and complained to management and their manager wasn't even quick to apologize and it was almost as if he even tried to defend the way his waiter ""Sean"" justifying his behavior because we ""only got dessert."" WHAT A JOKE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT!!"
Michael V.,"Mission Viejo, CA",67,50,2,2.0,3/20/2013,"I went here the other night to meet up with a friend.  I never looked at the reviews for BJ's until I checked in when I arrived.  At first I was thinking ""Damn it!""  I saw the reviews and thought the last place I wanted to be was a restaurant with poor service. I spun through the front door - that revolving door thing was pretty cool - and caught a glimpse of the inside.  It looked great, but then the experience pretty much feel apart. The beer I ordered was room temperature at best, when the food runner brought out food  - which took forever - he wanted to drop and go.  Never asked if we needed anything else.  There was no ""check back"" to see if we needed anything.  No refills on the water, and when I ordered a beer it took 10 minutes.   The place wasn't even close to being busy.  I'm not sure why such a delay and lack of service.   My food was pretty good, but my friend's chicken was extremely dry.   Will I repeat?   No way.  The only way I will go back is when the reviews get better.   Wish I would have looked first!"
Jay W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,36,3,1.0,1/8/2016,"Service is usually horrible and disorganized. There is one waitress who particularly hates her life, though I don't expect her to last. Turnover seems very high. Food always comes out lukewarm, meaning the chef's timing is bad and the servers don't move it out quickly enough. For group dining, expect errors in the orders."
Shaundra s.,"Fountain Valley, CA",131,8,5,1.0,9/20/2013,"Worst possible service.  The waitress was unfriendly and unsmiling and did her best to  make herself unavailable.  Cold food and unconcerned manager. Won't be back.  We sat ourselves in the bar area in hopes of fast service since we were on our lunch hour.  After 10 min the waitress brought us menus and asked for our drink orders. We placed our orders for food then too since w had already   long. I ordered all you can eat soup and salad.  We asked specifically that she bring the food as it was ready rather than waiting to bring it all at once.  20 minutes later there was still no food on the table.  I looked for any server to flag down, but there were none in sight.  Finally I spotted the manager who clearly had noticed us looking around for someone.  To his credit, he came over to see what we needed.   He was not rude but certainly unapologetic.  Just then my salad came out. Followed by my friends meals.  The cold food makes me suspect it was ready long ago and the waitress had decided to bring it just because the manager was standing at our table.   We still didn't have utensils... the customers at the table next to us pilfered utensils for themselves off an empty table and got us some too.   Finally my soup came 45 min into the meal. No one offered or brought more soup.or salad so ""all you can eat"" means 1 bowl and 1 plate.  We had to ask for the check. No apologies. No thank you for coming.  Just the bill.  Its the first time I've ever left no tip.  I will not be back.  Plenty of good food and service elsewhere."
Paul R.,"Orange, CA",29,43,1,2.0,3/16/2013,This place has really fallen apart recently. The service and quality of food are really lacking.  Food quality-- the entrees taste like they were prepared hours ago on some occasions. Lots of the food also comes out cold. Service-- is it too much to ask that all people dining together can receive their entrees within a few minutes of each other? BJs seems to have a very broken system where random servers deliver food. But only when they feel like it. Where is the waiter? Who knows.
K R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",5,5,1,5.0,1/20/2015,"The more often I go back to BJs, it seems like the experience improves... the server, Nico, was great at making food/drink suggestions.  Maybe you should return & give BJs another chance & enjoy a Jeremiah Red,  Hef, or a Porter!"
Valerie C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,6,,2.0,3/27/2013,"It's been a while since I've visited this place because my last experience was terrible! Our food (me, my son, and his friend) took forever to arrive while the rest of our large party chowed down in front of us. By the time our food did arrive everything was cold! My sliders were dry and the bread was hard.... I only ate one and by then my appetite had disappeared.... So my son's friend ate the rest of my food. We left shortly after and that night, the poor boy got food poisoning! So we haven't even considered returning. The service there is super slow and the menu isn't the best. The food isn't presented when its warm. They really need to get it together. Dissatisfied"
Dana W.,"San Clemente, CA",11,33,1,1.0,6/25/2014,"Sucked!! Took an hour to get food, then it was all cold and tasted bad . My daughters pizza wasn't served until after the rest of us were already done eating. Had to ask multiple times for silverware and water refills.. The last several times we've gone it's been a bad experience and a waste of money."
Melissa S.,"San Clemente, CA",44,105,20,2.0,9/14/2012,"Before there was BJ's, there was a failed!TGIF in this same location. While I wouldn't call myself superstitious, I do think that they should maybe burn some sage or something...perhaps there's some lingering negative energy in here.  Or, perhaps this BJ just sucks. Last Friday myself and three friends popped into the bar for a quick drink. I ordered a Meyer's rum with cherry cola, which was served to me in a small glass filled nigh to the brim with ice. Sadly, my drink was also lacking the cherry grenadine that would have helped mask the rum's strong flavor. I was a little surprised that the bartender got it wrong, as he made a bit of a show of pouring the rum into the (did I mention it was tiny?) glass. Also, we were the only ones seated at the bar. So, I asked him if he had any cherries, hoping he might remember what I actually ordered. He replied that yes, they had them, and stared at me like a deer in headlights. I then had to ask if I could get some, and he brought them back. No offer to add grenadine, but left too fast for me to ask. A young lady who was also bartending saw me trying to squeeze the juice out of my cherries into my glass, and she kindly asked if I might like some grenadine! That girl was a gem and the only good thing about the experience. Without asking if we wanted anything else (and all four of us were almost finished with our drinks) he brought us our checks and shortly thereafter, was relieved by another bartender...I know he wanted a tip for his ""services"", but I felt that it was very rude to try to force us to pay when we weren't finished, especially without asking if there was anything else he could get us since it was still a good couple of minutes before he left. I work in a restaurant and bartend some nights; I'm not asking for anything that I wouldn't ordinarily do myself in their shoes. In a way, it was probably for the best that I didn't get a second beverage -- the new bartender was obnoxious, loudly talking over the patrons in the bar-area so he could shout at his work-friends. My group was annoyed by him so we left.  I really wish I had gotten a beer instead of an awful mixed drink that I payed about $8 bucks for and didn't even get me buzzed. But what I really wish, was that we just didn't bother with this BJ's in the first place!"
Rene S.,"Placentia, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/23/2016,"I love going here with friends and family. I've been there many times. All the servers I've had were great, friendly yet professional. They were patient with the undeciders and attuned to our needs throughout the meal. I noticed the managers were present on the floor if needed, even the General Manager. I will for sure keep dining there. Oh yea, did I mention the food was excellent!"
