Josh B.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",22,14,2,4.0,9/27/2013,"I've always loved BJ's. Get the HopStorm IPA if you like IPAs. It's really flipping delicious! I've ordered their pizza, calzones, burgers and I've also chosen from the low calorie menu, which actually has some pretty good stuff. Everything is good, but I will highly recommend you stick to the pizza! (Quit your diet, even temporarily, if necessary).  I'm reserving one star because I ordered a calzone on my last visit and the cheese wasn't melted. It was really busy so I can understand, the cooks were probably rushed. Hey, it  gave me the chance to order another amazing beer... although it would have been nice if it were comped! -_- Our waitress was great. She was on point with the refills and seemed to always be checking on us; but only when we actually needed something (this is rare skill in this industry!). She was also totally cool with us switching to a bigger table when some other folks left. Not sure why people are saying the RSM BJ's is worse than others, I've been to the one on El Toro and it seems exactly the same!"
Shane R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",179,12,1,5.0,9/9/2014,The pizza is always amazing when they first opened the restaurant the staff was alright and the food wasnt that great I just went back tonight and they did a great job food was great and awesome customer service was perfect. My friend ordered a sangria which was made with white wine and vodka and we asked out awesome waiter (terra) who was more than accommodating and always has a smile on her face for something more traditional and richer and the bartender (Natalie) came to the table and said she could make a traditional sangria which isn't on the menu and it was so awesome I'm totally satisfied with this visit and I will definitely come back now that I've seen the new staff members
Tammy B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",6,27,3,2.0,6/23/2014,"Here I am again at BJs restaurant. And again the service SUCKS! The food is always so good, but I swear every single time I'm here it's the same ol thing. It takes forever to be greeted by your server, then another 10 minutes for drinks, then another 10 minutes to order the food. Now waiting waiting waiting for the soup and salad and flat bread pizza that we ordered to arrive at our table. Seriously we ordered 25 mins ago still nothing. It's a Monday night not even a full house. I hate that the service is so bad here because I love the food and the beer but I don't think I can deal with this every time we come. Bummer"
Lena K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,31,7,2.0,11/17/2014,"The food is good but the service sucks big time.  Every time we go there, we get seated quickly but then have wait 30 plus minutes for a buser to serve us water.  Also, we always seem to catch them at a shift change and somehow they always screw up our tab.  Unfortunately, we live in an area that doesn't have many late night options so we end up there by default."
Edgar L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/13/2015,I came in 30 minutes before closing and the service was horrible. No one greats you or even bothers to say ask if you been helped. I had to go up to server  and get attention so I could order my food.
John A.,"Meridian, ID",19,27,53,1.0,5/21/2014,"Service SUCKS! It is too bad since they have so many community fundraiser here (i.e. AYSO, Tijeras Creek Elememtary, etc).  Suffice it to say will not becoming back to this location."
Sezer O.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/5/2015,I had a good time at my local bj's. The hostess was friendly and seated us quickly even though it was busy. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip and a couple of burgers which were really good. The food took a little while to arrive however but it was friday night.
Scmom C.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/3/2015,"I am giving our visit  5 stars because of the service and the food..I want to commend the manager, Joy McKenzie Kadie, who was on duty the night that our team came to have dinner. Our group came in not knowing if we can be accommodated since it was a big group. The front desk person said the wait it will be around an hour. Then came Joy, she made it happen for the team. She was able to find a space for us and on top of that, service was fast!!  She is perfect for the position, very much service oriented and good people skills. It was truly a great experience! Thank you Joy and to the rest of your team....."
Sandy J.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",133,53,12,5.0,1/1/2015,Always consistently good. My bf and i like coming to watch the games here too. Love their house light lager beer.
Nick B.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,17,1,5.0,1/30/2016,Got the best service tonight from William P. Food was fantastic and came out really quick. This BJ's is alway great and I drive out of my way to come here.
Brian S.,"Irvine, CA",17,86,,1.0,10/7/2014,Rancho Santa Margarita is the location. I tried this location again. Horrible. The time we went was not busty. It took more time than other restaurants on a Friday night. The manager was not of any help and appeared defensive. I believe this happens more than most find out.
Rod B.,"San Clemente, CA",0,6,7,2.0,8/10/2014,"Went for the first time to a BJs.  Our party of 8 had about a 10 minute wait, not to bad.  Drinks and water took a little long but were correct. I only had water.  Had the avocado rolls that I split with friend. Asked for a second cup of dipping sauce, took 15 minutes to get it, AND 4 times I asked 3 different servers for sauce, now rolls were cold. Sauce arrived when the meal came.  Not happy.  Food was OK but not great.  Would return for the food IF I ever decide to go back. Had the thin crust pizza, ok but could have used  more time in the oven. Warm, not too crispy.  NOT ONE time did a server come back to ask if we wanted our drinks refilled or needed anything else.  I had to make 1 glass of water last an hour.    REALLY !!!  WATER no refill ?? Servers never cleared any of our dishes off the table as people were done, NONE. I would not go back to a BJs  again if I have that choice.  To bad, poor service looses another customer."
Scott H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",26,10,1,4.0,7/12/2013,"So this has become my neighborhood watering hole. Admittedly, I sit at the bar or in the bar area 99% of the time. The bar is serviced well and they take care of their customers promptly. The meu is ok, not perfect by any means, but I am satisfied with it. As a single person, I am less picky by myself when not entertaning guests. Their best item on the menu in my opinion, Parmesean Crusted Chicken is great. The burgers are very good, but the Bison burger is best and you can order just like the other burgers. Like I said, not a great menu for a serious night out, but good enough for me. Now for the best part, the beer. They have a great selection and as a beer lover, I am always in a good mood here. You should be able to find what you want here or very close to it. The atmosphere here is very good, I enjoy Friday/saturday evening here at the bar for a couple beers and maybe dinner or an apetizer. I see a lot of critical reviews on this place, not sure what the issue is.  Only problem I have really had is this: when actually seated at a table, service can be slower than it should be, most of all drink refills. not happy with that, but most of the time I'm at the bar anyway. Generally, I like this place and go here frequently."
Megan B.,"Irvine, CA",77,8,,1.0,3/24/2014,My family and I visited on a Monday night and had the worst service. Our waitress was very intense and unfriendly. She never smiled or offered any friendly conversation. Worst part is that my dad ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was very cold when he got it. He has never sent anything back in his life but felt he needed to this time. The waitress apologized and said the manager would come over (which he/she never did) and when the second sandwich came it was still very cold. At the end of dinner we wanted a pizzokie but the waitress dropped off our check without saying anything and cleared our plates while awkwardly not saying a word. My family and I are not very picky people but this was a very disappointing experience. And she still charged us for the cold sandwich.
Rachel K.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",10,46,,3.0,5/10/2013,"We have eaten here as a family at least 10 times.  The first 3 times, there were issues. Hubby ordered pasta dish with chicken, they forgot to put chicken on it.  I ordered stuffed mushrooms on a weeknight, they were out of mushrooms.  Kids and I ordered the 3 pizookies and we said we did NOT want the chocolate pizookies, and we got 3 chocolate pizookies.  Then the server asked if we were SURE we didn't want the chocolate ones.  Then it took another 30 minutes for the replacements to come.  At least that time they gave us the pizookies for free.   I have met friends there and it is often too loud to hear other's conversations.  The patio looks like it was forgotten about and then added on, I think they could have made a much nicer patio area like the one in Laguna Hills.   We stopped going there for about 6 months.  We have since returned and the service seems to have improved."
Ed E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",14,20,,1.0,6/19/2014,Worst food ever. This BJS is the worst! Don't come here. Unless you love being disappointed.
Paige T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/28/2015,Mychael gave great service! We had the cherry chipotle salmon and the bison burger and both were amazing! We will definitely come back.
Jim R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,6,1,1.0,11/25/2015,"It has been really nice being able to walk to happy hour at BJ's. Now they have changed their Happy Hour to Greedy Time. Only one out of many specials are gone, even the employees wish they change it back to the best Happpy hour. Until they do we will go elsewhere and we don't recommend BJ's for Happy Hour. In writing this I saved at least 15 dollars. Boo J's"
Danielle K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,39,1,1.0,2/24/2012,"DO NOT EAT HERE. Our waiter was very nice and attentive at first but that all changed.  My friends and I ordered a pizza to share and there was a long blonde hair in it...(all of us were brunettes).  We told the waiter and he brought the manager over.  The manager was very sorry and discounted it from our tab which was nice of him.  We wanted to let him know that we were very happy with our waiter, and when our bill came, we gave him a very large tip even though our food was discounted. When leaving, we over heard this waiter telling other staff members what b*tch*s he just had to serve, and how we made up that a hair was in our food.  Thanks a lot buddy, we just left you a huge tip and stuck up for you! Also when we were leaving, the restaurant served a pizooki to a table who ordered a gluten free one for a child with allergies.  Well, the waiter served the wrong one and the child was rushed to the hospital. I will never go here again."
Erin V.,"San Clemente, CA",10,35,2,1.0,8/2/2014,"Sigh. I wish I could offer a higher valuation but the service is just bleh. I was with a party of 8 and the server got my order completely and totally wrong and I sat while everyone else had dinner. My plate came out after everyone was done.  Definetely won't be back. Upside- I sat next to my one and only beautiful mom, and she's awesome."
