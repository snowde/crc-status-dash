Johnny V.,"Irvine, CA",7,6,,5.0,10/27/2014,"Great service, great food. Server was very nice, the food was delicious as always. Got a free pizookie so that was cool too"
Allie R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,6,1,4.0,12/9/2014,"As a former employee at this location, I can definitely recognize the positive changes they are trying to make. I'll always love BJs!!! But would like to see better quality flatbreads. Mine had maybe 4 chunks of avocado. Disappointing."
Gary H.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",4,16,,1.0,10/19/2014,"Come Here For The Uncooked Chicken! I came here with my family for a nice saturday afternoon lunch. The kids had soccer games and we didnt feel like cooking. My Daughter, who is 10 years old, decided to go with the Fried Chicken Tenders. After waiting about 30 minutes to get the food, she decided to tear into her chicken. What we found was uncooked chicken. Now, Im not talking about undercooked, slightly pink, or the juices were slightly pink. I am talking about RAW chicken. The type of chicken you would see at your local supermarkets chicken aisle.  After bringing this up to the manager, he said that he would take it back and cook it some more. REALLY?!?!? At least offer to replace it with a new one. Nope, he would just cook that one through. We told him not to bother. He brought out a new one anyways. After explaining to him that her appetite for their chicken had gone, she stuck to french fries, as you couldnt really screw it up.  The only benefit to the meal was that (after my wife lost her cool), they did comp the meal and they did bring her a pazookie. My wife ordered the salad, she said it was pretty good. My son ordered a burger, it had no flavor at all. Not bad, but not good. I had the pork chops. They screwed up my order and the chops were tiny. Not bad, but not something to get if you are hungry.  If you are in the area, and you are just going for the food, save yourself the time and headache and go to mcdonalds across the parking lot. At least you know what you are getting there. Service wasnt great. I did get constantly topped up with my iced tea, but it took the server over 10 minutes after the food was delivered (after my wife had already complained to the manager) to ask how everything was."
Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1251,506,242,1.0,1/8/2012,"I thought we shared this review....... but I guess not. The visit was about a month after their opening. My wife and I, and our family, can forgive ""first week confusion, jitters and mayhem"" from a new franchise location........ but I can't forgive the marketing ignorance of a manager, who after being told that everyone's food came to the table cold, my wife's order for vegetarian came with pork, and her re-order of a half baked potato and soup took another 30 plus minutes....... could only see his way to give our table a paultry ""half off just one entree!?""  Sorry BJ's....... we frequent the Irvine location and Laguna Woods, Huntington Beach and other locations, and have never had such bad food or service from the kitchen. The server guy was nice, but was ""sucker-punched"" by his kitchen staff and manager. I asked my wife..... ""If the manager had refunded the meal in full, would you return?"" Her answer......? No. It's that simple, and if you knew my wife, you'd know she wasn't going to change her mind. I'm still trying to figure out from which industry this restaurant manager came from....... I'm guessing ""Industrial Fasteners and Hardware?"""
Heather F.,"Anaheim, CA",12,23,1,4.0,8/11/2014,"Visited this past weekend and excited to report that the service has improved greatly!  Past couple of times had been quite slow and almost didn't return. Thank you to our great server, Alexa, for a much improved dining experience!  Loved the bison burger!"
S. A.,"Orange County, CA",5,32,1,1.0,2/3/2014,"Really a poorly run restaurant. I've been here maybe half a dozen times and I've never left impressed. For some reason, the food just does not come out hot or well prepared here. Pizza comes out with minimal cheese and the toppings are concentrated on the very center of the pizza whereas the 90% of the rest of the pizza has nothing on it. The soup is cold and oftentimes the silverware you get is dirty with all sorts of extra ""protein"" left on them.  Most of the servers here aren't very good either. On at least two of the occasions, our food came out incorrect. While our servers were contrite most of the time, how hard is it to not put onions on something? The last time food came out wrong, a manager came out and literally said ""What do you want?"" No apologies, no smile, nothing. That left a particularly bad taste in my mouth.  My friend also had to ask several times for a refill before it actually happened.  I can understand a place not getting it right maybe 1 or 2 times. But to consistently be poor...that's amazing.  I have frequented a few other BJs in Orange County (Brea, Laguna Hills, Laguna Beach) and those places are wonderful. Just pass on this location."
Dingo F.,"Orange, CA",121,10,3,3.0,8/9/2014,"Decent place, sometimes the service is slow. Good bloody Mary's,  and mimosa.  Foods always good."
Teresa D.,"Irvine, CA",3,30,10,1.0,5/4/2014,"I would not recommend this location unless you have hours on end to wait to be served. Our last couple of experiences at this BJ's have been extremely disappointing to say the least. The last time we went there, we ended up walking out after sitting at a booth for ten minutes and receiving no service. In the past, they've messed up on food orders but because there are not a lot of choices in this area, we went back but not anymore. The Laguna Hills BJ's is a drive but at least they're on top of their game!"
Melisa C.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",33,13,3,5.0,6/16/2015,"Went here for my first time and was great! Not too crowded and food was AMAZING! I went with my coworkers and our families so we had a pretty big party with little kids so the wait time for our food was a little longer than expected but our server MIKE was soooooo great! We didn't mind the wait at all but he apologized and even had the manager I believe come over and offer us all free pazookies on them which were amazing by the way for our wait! Our server always walked by making sure everything was okay and even let my fiancé try a few sample beers that's he's never tried before which was really helpful. It's not the best when you order something to drink and don't even like it and just leave the drink untouched. Overall great service, Great customer service. MIKE thank you as well as management. Even after we left they gave us free pazookies coupons to all of us for our next visit. Let's just say we will be coming back very soon."
Kurt G.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/12/2014,"I'm not a fan of bjs in general, but I thought I'd give em a chance. What a mistake and waste of money. I ordered a half great white half sweet pig. I picked up the pizza, it was cold and the great white was lacking ""white"". I've had it years ago and have had better ones, this was poor. Barely any sauce or cheese, mainly bread on some great white pieces. For $25 it's ridiculous. I'd rather pay $10 at papa johns or some smaller joint."
Ham S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/21/2014,"We live very close to this BJ's and have made the mistake of coming back several time even though we had bad experience each time. Service is very slow! When the food finally comes out, it's either raw or not as ordered.  We have been to several other locations and were a big fan of BJ's but this Rsm location is a true mess!"
David L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",29,4,,1.0,8/30/2014,"The service here is hit or miss. The hostess or hostesses that greet you at the door are dismissive and of no use when it comes to tabling. Getting the food you want depends on what you order. If you haven't been to BJ's the pizzas and pastas are usually what people order the most of. Other popular items that are readily available are the appetizers and pizookies. I ordered the Ribeye steak with seasonal vegetables and tomato bisque soup. The rib eye steak was cooked the way I liked it - medium rare - but I doubt anyone orders the steak when they go to BJ's which is why it led me to believe that the lack of flavor coming from the steak was because it sat in the refrigerator too long and the cut was poorly selected. I never got my tomato bisque soup, probably because no one orders tomato bisque soup at BJ's. The service is okay. Again the hostess/hostesses at the front are useless (this is what happens when you hire teenagers to do a job that requires quality customer service).  Our waitress did an excellent job taking our order, she couldn't pour the beer I had ordered, and when she notified me that my soup isn't coming out, she did her best to accommodate me. Even when they brought out our food, my sister had asked for red pepper flakes. They never brought it to her. Because of my tomato soup fiasco, the manager even came out to assist in making my experience better: offering to change the channels on the TV, offering a different side in exchange for the soup, etc. He seemed to be very engaged in satisfying his patrons. All in all, the execution from this BJ's is poor. You need to constantly asked to be helped and even if it's a result of being understaffed, the staff there still can't do their job. The lack of service and quality of food is what earns this BJ's one star."
Michelle F.,"Irvine, CA",439,112,33,3.0,1/1/2012,"I came here with low expectations since my prior experiences at BJ's have been notoriously greasy.  However, I heard this was a new location, and I needed to find a place where I thought I'd have enough room to roll my sleeping baby in her stroller while I watched the Niners game.  Hence, my primary reason to come here was to catch a game, not for the food!   Since it was 11am, it was quite empty and I got seated at a booth at the end to accommodate the stroller, and right up close to the tv as well.   I ordered a Mojito, a caesar salad and a vegetarian mini pizza.  The mojito came out first and to my surprise, was perfect, well-balanced, neither too sweet or watered.  Was pleasantly surprised again when the caesar salad was incredibly crisp and tasty, again, not salty or overdressed as I would expect in these type of chain restaurants.   The only ""meh"" was the pizza.  I am usually not a fan of deep-dish anyway.  Since I was enjoying my salad before I dug into the pizza, it was cold by the time I got to it, honestly not sure if it came out hot since it wasn't on the iron cast pan that the big pizza's are served on.  My personally feeling is that if it's good pizza, it's good whether hot or cold...this was like eating a mouthful of grease.  The whole wheat crust was really not good and if there's a next time, I would just go for the regular crust.   I should have just went for the Pizookie, those never seem to fail.   The service was excellent, as I had the waitress check on me several times, and even introduced her replacement while she went on break.  I would give five stars for service.   Definitely a great place to come watch a Sunday game, especially with baby in tow!"
Samantha W.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,3,,2.0,10/4/2014,"Take out service at BJs was horrible tonight. It took twice as much time as they quoted, then half our order was missing. Once we got food out for kids it was cold. All in all not a fun experience when we were trying to have a quick dinner!"
shawn g.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",18,25,1,3.0,8/24/2014,"Tried them again, and finally had excellent service and the food was very good."
Miles G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,19,,1.0,2/10/2014,"Abysmal. Staff has not got a clue. Apparently they do not have any training programs in place at BJ's. Went on a Friday night and it was packed. Took us over an hour to be seated when we were quoted 30-40 minute wait.  Waiter forgot to order our apps! He brought out our entrees. When we pointed out his mistake he said he could still bring them to us. Um, hello, they are APPETIZERS! He did not even apologize to us.! Long story short I will not be returning to this joint."
Nathan T.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",14,73,15,1.0,5/12/2014,This place is horrible good luck if your food isn't raw coming out.  Been giving this place chances for two years but I'm done.  Never going back.
Marcel C.,"San Clemente, CA",100,19,7,1.0,9/28/2015,"Last night I took my girlfriend here, we ordered a couple drinks and I'm a bartender myself so I know what they should taste like and how they should be made. She got a lemon drop which was made wrong, there was no sugar rim and it tasted like lemonade, there was no alcohol taste at all and only half the glass was poured so I literally think she only added tripplesec and forgot the standard 1.5 vodka pour. My beer was two inches of head so immediately we started the night trying to fix the bartenders errors. My girlfriend politely walked up to the bar and asked if there was something the bar tender could do to make her drink right because she and I tasted no alcohol and there was no sugar rim and it was half full. The bar tender, Alexis just said ok what do you want me to do about it and looked at my gf with a blank resting bitchface. My gf then asked her if she could just try making it the right way and then Alexis rudely walked away and made another, with no sugar rim but at least I could tell there was probably 1.5 ounces of vodka.. the rest of the experience was awkward with the bartender staring at us and talking to her coworkers, if we're going out and paying for drinks and service, coming from the service industry ourselves we just expect things to be made right, we were polite and tipped well still but the experience was ruined."
Kylie H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",14,58,16,2.0,4/12/2014,Came here at 9pm. Its currently 9:45 and we haven't gotten our food yet. Its not even busy! We also didnt get our orders taken for the first 30 mins and we only have a party of 4....
Cameron E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",43,11,1,4.0,9/19/2014,"The scallops were great. The service was great. The beer was great. No more to-go growlers, or I would have given 5 stars. Mychael was the server and he was on top of our drinks and our food orders. Great night at BJ's!"
