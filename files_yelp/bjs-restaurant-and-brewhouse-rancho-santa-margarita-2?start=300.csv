Neida P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,26,8,5.0,11/2/2014,"I've been to this location several times and the service has always been okay, but tonight that changed. My server, Aaron, was awesome! So attentive, nice and overall great.. I absolutely loved his customer service."
Jake D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",151,42,7,2.0,9/14/2014,"Feels really understaffed. The waiters are given 10 tables or more and they just don't have the time to give everyone the attention they deserve. We complain to management a lot but they don't seem to care. The wife and I are pleasantly surprised when we get a waiter that can actually breathe and afford to give us a personalized treatment, but in all the years we've come, it's only been about twice. No joke. The food is great though. I've never been disappointed. The chocolate chip pazookie is awesome and I have to highly recommend the balsamic chicken."
Lisa F.,"Yorba Linda, CA",9,23,,1.0,3/22/2014,"Zero stars. The service here blows! Just waited 50 minutes for food. Over 15 minutes just for a beer. No sign of the snotty waitress the entire time. No soup before the meal as requested. Manager was requested & we requested our food to go. He took care of the food, charged us for the beer & still no soup. Waitress never even apologized or acknowledge how crappy the restaurant & her service was. Restaurant was also only 1/4th full...not busy at all."
Sean C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",45,63,4,1.0,11/1/2011,Got my wife all excited about having a BJ's near by.  She loves the spicy marinara pasta.   I thought I had a simple order to go 1 kids pizza 1 Spicy marinara  1 pizzoki Kid told me it was going to be 15 min. Well it took 45.  Food was cold and didn't get the correct order.   Bottom line Let this play mature!  Hopefully they get things right and I re review.
Greg N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",25,9,,2.0,12/19/2011,"I've come to expect a lot from BJ's Restaurant and Brewerys as I've been to many different locations (Huntington Beach, Westminster, Irvine, Cerritos, etc)  and have had a good experience each time.  However,  I cannot say the same about my experience at this RSM location. Yes,  I understand this particular location is new and as a result is pretty busy.  I went here with my girlfriend and her family on a Wednesday night to celebrate her birthday.  It was packed.  We were a party of 8 and got a 20 minute wait estimate so we thought no problem right?  Well we were stuck waiting outside for close to an hour and 15 minutes.  They finally had a table ready for us.  While we were walking to it, I couldn't help but notice multiple booths that could seat 5+ that were given to parties of 2 while tables that could seat 2 were left empty.  What gives?   The service just wasn't what I would expect and was sub-par at best.  The food didn't really taste as good as I've had at other BJs restaurants.  On top of it,  I've never seen so many 65+ year olds in a restaurant or bar ever.  Was it bingo night down the street or what?  Maybe there is an RSM Leisure World I don't know about? Just kidding....sort of... In my opinion,  I would stick to one of the other locations until the hype with this new location dies down.  I can't justify going there again with the service we had that night."
Ana B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",46,11,4,4.0,6/15/2014,"I was hesitant to come over to BJs because of all the bad reviews. I decided to to give it a chance anyway and got good service and good food. Food was a lot slower than it should , main reason of my four star rating. I would of overlooked it, if it was super busy , but this was not the case this night . CHEERS"
Robert S.,"Irvine, CA",10,27,,1.0,1/10/2014,This is simply the worst restaurant in RSM. I've tried this place 4 times and it doesn't get any better. The food is typical franchise junk food like TGI Fridays or Applebee's but that's ok if you expect it. The reason I'm giving this place 1 star is mainly based on their service or lack of. I tried their curbside service this time. They told me 10 - 15 minutes so I arrived exactly 15 minutes after I placed my order. I waited another 15 minutes and drove home only to find cold food and a missing order. People of RSM there are better choices. Let's get this pathetic restaurant out of here!
L L.,"Secaucus, NJ",2,36,6,1.0,11/15/2013,"My boyfriend and I have been here maybe four times since we moved to RSM. Our last two visits were in the last month. We used to go to BJ's often before we moved, but every time we've come to this location, we've had a bad experience -- a couple of the more common issues are service is slow and we always had to ask for eating utensils because some tables had them and some didn't (they'd even serve the appetizers without realizing we didn't have utensils). Even when it was relatively dead, our servers were nowhere to be seen. It'd make sense if they were really busy and hadn't come by yet, but when it's not busy, it just seems like they're really inattentive or messing around out of sight or something. Oh, we've gotten their mushrooms appetizer a couple times and it seems like they're using button mushrooms or something. They're always so tiny and the fact that they use a huge plate for it only emphasizes how small they are and how few you get. Not worth the cost, in my opinion. I finally decided to say something to the manager on our previous visit (we went once more last night, but I'll get to that shortly). We went on a Friday night and they were really busy, as expected. I ordered a ribeye and BF got the chicken fried steak. His steak was really dry and mine was way undercooked (I got it medium rare and this was nearly raw), which was a big portion of it considering about half of it was fat. I don't mind eating a little fat with my steak, but I wasn't going to eat pure fat. I cut most of it away and also the raw part and ended up with a piece that was half the size of my palm, only a quarter of the steak's original size. I don't know how the cook could've picked that up raw and thought it was a good piece to cook and serve. We barely saw our server because it was so busy and when he showed up, he took my plate away. Not having much to eat, I spent my meal talking to BF while waiting to spot our server and I didn't notice when he was clearing the table. There goes all the evidence of my ""steak."" I asked to speak to a manager and he tried to tell me that ribeye was a fatty cut and I said it wasn't like I was expecting NO fat, but most of it was fat and inedible (at least for me; I don't mind a bit of fat in a bite, but like I said, I won't eat just fat. That's kinda gross). I also mentioned that BF's steak was super dry. He offered to take off half the cost of the meal, but much to my dismay, BF interjected and said it wasn't necessary. I think my steak was like $20 and I was really peeved that we paid that much for a steak that was mostly thrown away and uncooked. The manager stopped us on our way out and handed me a $15 gift card, which was nice of him, but we weren't sure if we were going to come back. Yesterday, we stopped by again to use the gift card. Originally, I said we could use it for beer because my boyfriend enjoys BJ's beers, but we decided to give their food another shot. It was far less busy than our previous visit, though it felt like whoever showed up thought it was kids' night; there was no shortage of children running around, crying, and playing in the revolving doors (the hostesses just looked on and busied themselves with something at their station). I don't mind kids, but I do mind parents who let their kids run rampant.  My boyfriend ordered the ribeye and I thought I'd stick with something ""safe"" so I ordered the BJ's bacon burger with a lettuce wrap (avoiding bread right now). His ribeye came out with the amount of fat I'd expect and was cooked perfectly (he likes his rare. but he wouldn't even touch my steak last time). My burger was a really thin patty, something like a White Castle burger. BF took a look at it and said we could've gotten something better at Carl's Jr. and for cheaper. The round, puffy shape of the lettuce wrap really hid how small the patty was. Knowing I was disappointed (again) and that I was envying his perfect ribeye, he gave me a few pieces of it (he's so sweet). We've sworn off BJ's for now. Every time we've gone, it seemed like they were understaffed (and we've been going over a span of months, so I'm surprised they still haven't figured out how many people they need for a particular night...and are they seriously not reading these reviews?). We might visit the bar, but I don't want to waste any more money on their food."
John M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,34,,1.0,1/22/2012,"I visit the Huntington Beach location often since it's near my office so I was glad BJ's opened a location near my home.  I've been to this RSM location twice now, but this past Friday's visit will be my last. The waiter was totally confused and had to recheck our order twice.  The food for the four of us came out at four different times, but the worst part was the chicken was RAW.  My friend ordered half a chicken sandwich and soup, thank God it was half a sandwich or he would not have seen it until he had taken a bite.  The manager came out and apologized, yet it still took another 20 minutes for them to bring a new sandwich, at which time everyone else at the table had already finished their meals. I ordered a turkey burger with a cup of soup to start.  The soup arrived after the turkey burger, and the burger was dry as a desert.  The manager did comp the raw chicken sandwich, but it was to little to late. There are way to many other other options out there competing for my dining dollar to have to put up with this nonsense."
Stacy B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,6,,2.0,4/1/2014,"I've been here many times since they opened and it's definitely a hit or miss experience. Usually I come in later (after my late night classes end) and sometimes in the bar my husband and I have not been greeted for minutes (while the servers are talking to each other) which I hate on slow nights. Other times we have gotten good and even exceptional service. Most recently, we came in a few weeks ago, after 10pm on a week night, and after waiting at a bar hightop for what felt like forever we decided to leave.  Overall, the food is good, but the spotty service puts it at 2 stars for me. I'd rather go to Tapas late night where the food is not as consistent but the service is."
Nick I.,"Irvine, CA",72,8,1,1.0,10/13/2013,Do you ever work on service? This is the 3rd and final time we will come here. I've never in my life waited as long as I have for apps. No it's not busy right now and salads come out with entrees and apps do as well...we waited for 20 minutes for CHIPS AND SALSA! Put your hand in the bag grab some chips and pour some salsa in a bowl and serve!
Jason S.,"Downey, CA",51,13,,2.0,12/30/2011,Went there with a friend to take advantage of their appetizers during happy hour. I think it was something like half off the mini-pizzas. Being a huge fan of their pizzas I was really excited about the food. It probably took about 20-30 minutes to get the food which seemed a little bit longer than I would've normally thought given that the restaurant was maybe 1/4 full. The pizza itself had good flavor but it wasn't what I would call hot and the texture just seemed off for some reason. We also ordered another appetizer which came out quickly and tasted excellent. The service was decent; our waitress made sure she frequently checked on us throughout the night and kept our drinks full. The reason I give it 2 stars is that the food itself didn't impress me like it had at other BJ's in Orange County.
Jim B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,205,5,5.0,1/17/2015,"This place is great to get a flight of their in-house beers and relax on the patio.  Today it was just beautiful outside.  So, we headed over there for a few beers.   I tend to agree with people that the food is relatively lackluster and the service is a tad on the slow side.  Since I just come here for the beer and to chill-out on the patio, I really don't care about the food or service.  The people working there have always been nice.  So, who cares?  Quite frankly, I haven't been to brew pub that has decent food or prompt service.  And, I go to a lot of these places.   Some of the negative reviews for this place just make me cringe.   I mean, get a life!"
Scarlett D.,"Glendora, CA",6,43,23,4.0,4/27/2014,"The manager, Will demonstrated that he really cares about customer satisfaction. Many choices on the menu, big screen TVs playing sports around the restaurant, and clean bathrooms."
Jennifer L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",509,501,67,3.0,1/27/2012,"I frequent different BJ's locations fairly often, and I came to this one for the first time last night. This is a good addition to the RSM area since the only other one in South county is in Laguna Hills. We sat in the bar area and were served right away. Food and service were both on target with other BJ's locations. We started with a pitcher of Jeremiah red, and I ordered chicken tortilla soup (which was AMAZING by the way) and the boy ordered a huge bacon cheeseburger. Total bill for us was 35.00.....it seemed a little steep and we both commented to each other that we thought that BJ's has raised their prices recently.  I also have a love/hate relationship with the menu since it has calories listed for everything. It's like you want to know how many calories your meal has, but deep down inside you really don't want to know! I'm surprised that some of their pizzas have less calories than their salads. I enjoy BJ's because they realty do have a huge menu with something for everyone, and the food is consistently good. I will watch the prices on the menu though because they have jumped up!!"
Al G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/16/2015,Super friendly team and food was excellent..not sure what more you could want..somethings changed here..
Michelle B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,46,,1.0,9/10/2015,"Horrible service, no selection of domestic beer, just their gross beer.  Food is awful.  I dont know how people can eat here - YUCKY!!"
Chuck H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,35,4,2.0,6/7/2014,"Service isn't good. We order a pizza, flatbread, salad. We got our pizza, 20 mins later got our salad and 20 mins later got our flat bread pizza. Never got asked if we wanted refills. Never gave us utensils until we asked for them. The place wasn't even bz and we got lousy service. I probably will not go back. I decided to give them another chance.  Why did I bother they are sure very consistent in providing bad service."
Laurie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3,11,2,4.0,3/17/2012,"I LOVE BJs...that said, I have a little bone to pick...I've been to this location twice & both times the service was pretty slow!!!  Our server was really sweet, but other people brought out our food.  Our sides (ranch & honey mustard) didn't come out with our food & it took about 10-15 min. before they arrived.  My niece's burger was WAY undercooked!!!  She just said ""I don't really like it""...(please keep in mind that she's 10)!!!  I took a bite, at the end of our meal.  It was pretty raw!!!  No wonder she didn't like it!!! On the positive side, she ordered ""steak fries""...thinking that they were the smaller crispy fries.  They replaced them for the crispy fries & told us to enjoy the ""wrong"" ones.  BTW...I made sure to re-assure our server that she got the order the way it was ordered!!!  It was just a 10 year old misunderstanding her choice!!! Overall, it was a pretty good experience...just slow service!!!"
Bob A.,"Riverside, CA",4,9,,1.0,11/26/2013,Fire the cook.  Dry sliders with a nickle size piece of cheese... but what was I thinking I would get based on the reviews!
