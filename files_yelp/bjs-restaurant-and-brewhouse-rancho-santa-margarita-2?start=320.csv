Tim M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",11,2,2,3.0,7/12/2014,Friendly service.  With a party of 2 took 45 mins to get food. Waiters avoided our table.  Its not even crowded
Carmen M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,11,2,4.0,7/7/2014,Food is sooo good here! I did take out so it took a bit longer to get it but the people we're so nice right?!!  All smiles :)
Alex S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/14/2015,This place sucked. The server spilled a whole glass of water on me. Then I never got a soda that I ordered. My steak was Well done when I asked for medium rare. DONT COME HERE. The names funny though.
Mike C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",27,125,32,3.0,3/14/2014,This is a typical chain - average at best.  The menu is extensive and the beer list is nice too.  But the food varies in quality from ok to very good  - it just depends on what night you go and who is cooking.  It's often busy which is a good sign.  Nobody wants to eat somewhere where the food has been sitting around.  The pizookies are definitely the highlight!  Warm cookie with melting ice cream - YUM!
Yolanda C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,34,12,1.0,1/18/2014,Waited 40 minutes to get a table and then another 45 minutes for my food. I asked for Parmesan cheese for my pizza and it took 15 minutes to get it because they could not find it !!!!!!!!!!
Monita T.,"Tustin, CA",1,12,1,1.0,1/20/2015,"All right, we have decided to give this BJ's another try.  I just can't believe such luck.  The place was not busy and still the service was very slow.  The kids ordered the usual Mac & Cheese with fries, the adults had avocado roll, salad, country fried chicken entree and a pizza.  It took 50 minutes for the food to come!  The worst part is that most of the food was not hot.  The Mac & cheese were dried out (crusty and chewy on top) with luke warm fries.  The chicken got so dried that the gravy/sauce crusted on the breading and the Parmesan mash potato became crumbly, and the avocado roll wasn't hot either.  Only the pizza was hot.  So my guess is that all the order was mostly filled but the pizza was forgotten and by the time it was done, all the other foods were deteriorating in quality before serving.  When asked about the reason for the slow service, the new waiter explained that there has been a new general manager and things are getting better.  If this is how service is being managed, it's far from improvement.  I don't think we'll be going there anymore"
Cathy N.,"El Toro, CA",41,18,15,3.0,11/29/2011,"My bf and I were headed to this new location for a baby shower.  So, we only came for dessert.  This restaurant replaced TGIF's, which btw was small and dimly lit and service was slow.  But walking into the restaurant, I was half expecting it to be like the Laguna Hills or Tustin location where there's some kind of small spaces and corners, but this was open and huge! Perfect place to sit back and watch any sports games. Onto the service, our server was attentive and got all of our orders and drinks.  The only problem was since we had a large party, they messed up on some of the orders of my friends.  Like no sauce on one mini pizza and accidentally adding an ingredient that was requested to be taken off of another mini pizza. Also, one of the servers, when our food came out, said one of the entree names and it took a bit because the person who ordered it was mid conversation, but we showed him where to put it, and he slammed the order down... (that's kinda rude) As usual, everyone ordered the pizookies, my bf and I shared the trio, we picked two of them to be chocolate chunk chip and the third to be white chocolate macadamia nut. It's always a hit. The only problem again was my friend found a piece of hair in her ice cream and another friend asked for the ice cream on the side and it wasn't. So honestly, I think it's prob cuz of the new restaurant and new servers, but I hope they fix it in the future."
John S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",15,54,42,4.0,11/7/2013,"5 stars on the food and ambiance. I wish I could say the same for the service. If you do find someone, they are no doubt not the server in your particular area"
Aj M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",18,10,,1.0,12/22/2013,horrible service we to wait about 10 minutes to get someone to take our drink order had to ask a waiter to take my order and it wasn't even our waiter. I order chicken tortilla soup and stated clearly about 4 to 5 times no avocado and still avocado. I asked for a different menu bc mine had stuff all over it and the ladies I asked had a total attitude with me. the food was good but need to get better service
B K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",53,132,40,4.0,10/31/2011,"Food was really good, but service was lacking. This was during the lull between lunch and dinner on Sunday afternoon, so it was not too busy. There were a ton of wait staff milling around the place and we had not just one servers coming to our table, but two. Not sure which one was the actual server, but most likely the one that brought us the check...finally.  We initially ordered something to drink and finally some food which included an appetizer and a meal after the server decided to return after an extended absence. Then during the long wait for the food, I asked from some bread in the meantime. The bread was brought out and I had to ask for silverware since none was present at our table. Our food then arrived which we enjoyed, but they never came to refill our drinks our even ask if I wanted another beer. After eating one of the servers came over to tell us all about the desert, but we mentioned we only wanted the check because we had to leave. She had to track down the server to get him to give us the check. When he came back, he looked through his checks for various tables, but didn't have ours and had to leave again. He finally came back and we promptly paid and left.  It's a new place and the staff is new so I give them the benefit of the doubt. Plus the food was good so I'm excited to try it again. I really enjoyed the design and decoration of this new BJ's. A definite improvement over the Friday's that was located here previously."
Jordie S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/18/2013,"This has been the go-to spot for me and my friends for at least a year now, if not more. Probably more. Concerning the food: I thoroughly enjoy everything I've tried. The burgers are amazing, and the pizza is killer. Especially since Mini pizzas are 50% during Happy Hour. Yes, that means you can get a $5 Mini pizza. Freakin' great. PIzookies. Enough said. The servers here are great. They great us as if we're family or something. Kirsten, Selena, and Danny have all made us feel so welcomed and loved. Honestly, we end up just talking to them about the most random things. I don't know what's up with all the negative reviews. I've been going here a couple times a week for a really long time, and I've always left happy."
Steve M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",3,60,20,1.0,4/6/2013,"Stung AGAIN, I can only say brutal. It was getting late so.......... Reluctantly we returned to the infamous BJ's. The ONLY silver lining is .................................... .hhmmmm............... thinking...............................hmmm.................................... Uh we did not get sick from the food I guess? There is no silver lining, this place is if not anything else is very consistent, consistently slow! They must make so much money they have no problem comping the food. Our food was late & they tried to rectify by bringing something different (Pizza instead of fettucine Alfredo) then the fettucine Alfredo arrive about one minute before the pizza so our guest had two meals (free). I really wish we had some better dining choices in RSM @ 8pm when everyone is hungry NOW...  oh well ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I have even emailed corporate.... no response, I think we are done with this place."
Kevin I.,"Salt Lake City, UT",125,76,29,5.0,4/7/2013,"Not sure what is going on with all these bad reviews.  We discovered this BJs last January and have been back several times at different times of the day and night since then.  How can you go wrong with a place that serves COLD craft beers and Americas favorite, PIZZA?  Not to mention their pizookies.  I give this place 5 stars because our service has been nothing less than gracious and the servers really work hard to please everyone. Not to mention the food is consistently delicious.  Our last server, Katrina, was so caring.  She made certain we had everything we needed and with a three year old, that is some times difficult.  The atmosphere is perfect for me and my family.  My daughter loves the pizookies and I get to enjoy a cold one while watching most any sport. In a family atmosphere. Our last visit was on a Sunday brunch, while there are not a lot of choices on the brunch menu, the one item i honed in on is French Toast.  It was well prepared, hot and the syrup came hot as well.  Yummy.   RSM is short on good restaurants.  I have seen other restaurants get raving reviews on here that I thought were just average.  So, perhaps it is just preference.  Either way, give this place a try and let me know if you liked it or not."
Chad M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/17/2014,I love bjs to death. It is literally some of the best food in Orange County. But I will never go back to the bjs in rsm because it sucks. The restraunt was totally dead but somehow I waiting 20 minutes to get seated and while I was seated for 30 minutes without a waiter or waitress to ask me if I want a water or something to drink. I got up and walked out. Good job losing service. I would rate 0 if I could.
Nicholas M.,"Orange, CA",22,3,,2.0,11/17/2013,"Food is good but the staff is horrible!!!! Not properly trained staff , falls on management"
Taylor S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",14,23,3,5.0,1/1/2014,"My family and I dine at BJ's at least once a week. It is really nice because we can all get whatever we want (because the menu is so diverse) I've never had a problem with my food, but if I did I know they would handle it really well because the waiters are really helpful and nice. Everything on the menu is good. EVERYTHING. I've had almost everything at this point and you can't go wrong."
Ben B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,10,1,5.0,11/29/2013,This place should have 1000000 stars. Pizza and pizzokie is and will always be life. I come here basically 7 times a week and I never ever ever ever get tired of the same shit over and over again. Seriously though eat here.
Gigi S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",113,28,26,1.0,3/3/2013,"Well, we live close to this location. The restaurant's decor is beautiful! It is too bad that the service isn't so beautiful.  I usually don't write negative reviews, but this experience here has happened more than once.  I have been here 4 times in the last two months. Fifty percent of the time everything was fine, the other two times it was COMPLETELY crazy how many things went wrong. Somehow the kitchen timing is off.  The food arrives at all different times. I think the real problem is the manager is never in view. All other places the manager is checking the floor to make the customers are happy. This doesn't happen here.  We left last night very disappointed and had dessert at another local establishment.  (We were afraid that they would mess up our dessert order, too.) We started up a conversation with the staff and patrons and everyone agreed that this location as major problems with service. We will think twice before ever returning."
Jeffrey T.,"Simsbury, CT",69,69,81,4.0,7/31/2013,"Stopped by a few evenings for the late night happy hour which begins at 10pm in the large bar area. Great service, good eats, and terrific special prices. Haven't had anything to eat here except for the specialty pizza, spinach dip and chicken potstickers and those items were really tasty. The tap beer was ice cold and awesome.  I'll return for the late night special for sure."
Ames E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/15/2013,"My family went to BJs for dinner, and I had them get me a Buffalo Chicken Pizza for take out. When they get home I soon realize that it is a Barbeque Chicken Pizza. My grandma called the store, and was put on hold for 10 minutes. When she finally got through to the manager and explained the situation, he said they had ""changed their menu"" to make it less spicy for people, and that is why there was barbeque sauce on the buffalo pizza.  My grandma told him no where on the menu does it say it has bbq sauce on it, and he played dumb. It was obviously a bullshit lie to try and cover their asses, but the pizza I got had none of the proper ingredients on it. It was a fricken bbq pizza. They comped the meal, but the fact that the manager didn't even own up to the mistake, and tried to pass it off as a ""change in the menu"" really pissed me off. We will probably avoid this restaurant now."
