Ryan R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,19,18,1.0,2/12/2012,ordered through online ordering.  The food was ready at the time they said. the order was correct.  Brought the food home and it was cold and terrible i know its hard to get fried food takeout and have it stay crispy but i lived 5 min away so the fried calamari wasn't in transit too long so it sucked from the get go. rubbery as hell.  pasta had no flavor and the stuffed mushrooms were the size of quarters.  i got my money back and will never go get take out there again.  I'll try the dine in maybe
Brett L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,7,,3.0,5/21/2015,"Let me start by saying when we go into this BJs the food is good. The service is okay, sometimes not good at all and sometimes just fine. Last night my husband and I got take out from this location. We each got an entree salad and they were not good, no where near the quality you get when you're in the restaurant. My husband got the bbq chopped salad (or so we thought) and not all the toppings were given to us. Would recommend going into the restaurant, not getting take out."
Carrie C.,"San Clemente, CA",6,44,22,3.0,12/6/2013,"Great bar service tonight with Stu (not sure of spelling)!  Was here a few weeks ago with my fiancé and had a very negative experience with Ricky but tonight redeemed it.  I'm glad we gave it a second try.   Drink and food specials were offered right away,  service was fast and friendly and the food came out quickly and hot & tasty!  Look for Stu!!"
Chaz C.,"Long Beach, CA",377,24,7,1.0,12/2/2012,"If I could rate this particular BJs location 0 stars, I would. Seriously, avoid this location like the plague. The only thing that was good out of our dinner party's meal was my beer. While the absolutely horrid food wasn't the servers fault, they hid their heads in the sand like ostriches. Since this was our first time (and last time) eating at this BJs, I can only speculate that this is their way of dealing with customers who can't stomach food that has been frozen for months on end attempting to be passed off as editable. Let me offer this: The Laguna Hills location isn't that far, it's worth the drive."
Dan F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",47,2,,1.0,5/11/2015,"I have been to this restaurant three times with my family and the 3rd time was ""strike three"". The service and the food are sub-par. Each time, it was a long wait to get our food, they forgot or got orders wrong, and we were served inferior food. We were served a split burger patty and raw meat burgers. The service was slow even when there were few patrons in the restaurant."
Jaclyn F.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",271,18,,5.0,5/30/2013,The rsm crowd must be hard to please. All I can say for people reading these reviews is you have to try it for yourself! The service here is excellent. I've been here many times before and have never seen such better customer service. Maybe try going in the bar area where the servers are experienced and professional. The happy hour is great and the food is fantastic. People need to stop being so uptight about every little detail and just relax!
Wilvert S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",2,3,,1.0,2/5/2014,"I went to this BJ's with my boyfriend and we were seated within reasonable time. The restaurant was not too busy with people and our waiter attended us within time as well. Everything was fine until we placed our order and that's when all went downhill because our food took way too long to get to our table. After about 40 minutes of waiting only one plate came first and when the second plate arrived 10 minutes later it was incorrect. I have manners and would never eat before the other persons food was ready. So we told them they got the order wrong and if we could change it for the right item. Well, by the time they got it right my food was not very hot anymore and I was ready to take it to go. Overall the host was alright with his service, not very welcoming. The waiter was one of two things, either not good for writing down the wrong entree or good for his service of always checking up on us and the kitchen made the wrong order. My conclusion is that I will not be returning to this location ever again after this endeavor."
Melody H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",11,96,216,3.0,11/30/2013,"I've only been to this location twice because my boyfriend lives in RSM. The first time our server was so sweet, but she forgot to put our order in. But they decided to give us everything for free because it took so long. Which was nice! Free food drinks and dessert! A problem was that our server mixed up the desserts, she made my pizzookie a regular when it was suppose to be a mini and gave my boyfriend the mini which was suppose to be a regular. My bf didn't like peanut butter which is why he didn't want mine.. To top it off I found 2 hairs in my pizookie. No big deal because everything was free. We gave the server a $20 tip just cuz everything was free, also cuz she was new and sweet. I went here again today and our side of fries took forever that they gave it to us for no charge. The only thing is that the service was pretty slow and took forever with refills but she was okay. Overall id say this location is okay, just the servers can be a little forgetful or slow at times"
Brooklynn M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",124,4,,1.0,2/3/2015,"I really enjoy BJs and think they have a great menu, however this location is terrible. It is the closest location to my house and we have ordered here 3 times to go and I have been there once for lunch. We ordered the fish and chips which tasted okay but was really dark and too close to being burnt. They forgot the tartar sauce and vinegar... which is just not cool. My dad had to drive back and get those and they just apologized, that is it! We also ordered the tomato soup which my mother said was really good but really how can you mess that up. I have had the avocado spring rolls which taste great but were packaged poorly and the lid to the sauce was left open and splashed everywhere. The avocado was all brown which does not affect the taste but is very unpleasant to look at. The onion strings were 3.49 and you could see the bottom of the container they were in. Maybe 1 1/2 handfuls at best...ridiculous. The pizza looks okay and tastes good but is cold. When we actually went in about 2 weeks ago it was about 2:00pm and the bar had about 5 people and the tables were empty. Nobody came to seat us and I actually had to shout out after 10 minutes of us standing there feeling very awkward. A server looked at me and just ignored, then a second later a gal came over and seated us. The waitress was grody and kind of trashy looking. She did not care at all and was just very basic. Basically the only good reason to come here is to go to the bar because you cannot really mess that up."
Stacey E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",32,82,59,1.0,11/22/2012,"I really wish the staff could get it together. The service is terrible, and the tables never seem to be set.  the last 3 times we dined there we had to ask our waitress at least 3 times to PLEASE bring us silverware. The last time we we there our food was completely cold by the time the waitress brought our forks.  Then we had to hound her for a napkin several times.  I realized it's just a pizza joint, so I don't expect much, but seriously guys; the least you could do is make sure the tables are set.  I would like to mention the last 3 times this happened, the place was super slow and the staff seemed to have plenty of time to congregate.  I love their Tomato Basil soup, but it's just not worth the hassle"
Justin C.,"Livermore, CA",1,37,1,2.0,12/23/2013,"Happy hour was a massive rip off. Yeah, they cut the price in half, but they also cut the size in half. And the HH deal on beer only covered their home brew which is only so-so. Overall disappointed. Won't go back again."
John E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",61,12,3,1.0,11/14/2013,"So 11 days and no response from this, an email and a facebook post to their page. Completely unacceptable."
Diana W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/20/2013,"Worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. We called ahead to make a reservation and still had to wait half an hour so why bother calling ahead. The food was also disappointing; tasteless and overpriced. Not to mention it was cold. The condiments we asked for was given to us after we finished our food, and it took fifteen minutes to get water. The service was extremely slow.  The waitress was nice enough but it's clear that the place is just so poorly managed.  We have been there before and did not have a good experience so we gave it another chance; and instead of getting better, it gets worst...which I didn't think was possible. Never again! We were so disappointed not to mention we were still hungry so we went to McDonalds afterwards and got better service and food."
Geoff S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",21,96,10,4.0,10/16/2013,I was glad when they opened this BJs. I don't go to this location very often but when I do it's always good. It's not perfect but I've never had a bad dinner or lunch here. I like the atmosphere with the TVs showing sports too. I always get the pepperoni pizza and the quality is pretty consistent.
Gaylelynn G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",51,12,,1.0,2/10/2013,"Sat in the bar thinking it would be quicker. Not a good idea. Firstly, I was served dirty dishes , ketchup never arrived for the fires, my friends 'bacon' burger didn't come with bacon, napkins forks and knives came late! Unprofessional and aweful service. The best thing was that the laker game was on, but then, I could have seen that at home....!!!"
Alexis D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/1/2015,"I come here once a week and tonight was the worst experience. I work at a restaurant, so I understand mistakes. We got a new waiter who was being trained by what I assume was a experienced one (you could tell he was frustrated) First off he made us feel awkward (he would linger and stare for too long), but besides that we never got half our food! We ordered wings right as we sat down, never got them. Two bowls of soup. Never got them. Water never got refilled. The best part is we never saw them again after they took our order to ask them where the soup and wings were. The icing on the cake was my ribs were terrible, so in place I got the wings I had ordered forty minutes prior. The new server made a super awkward and lame apology that they 'went missing' and then just stared. They so kindly took off the soups we never got, the terrible ribs and the wings we got. Also kept talking about the manager who never showed up to talk to us."
Joy F.,"Lake Arrowhead, CA",174,17,15,1.0,5/4/2013,Why do we keep coming to this place? Honestly if it weren't for the stuffed mushrooms and pizookies I probably wouldnt bother. Every time we come here we get our order given to us wrong. Every. Single. Time. Without. Fail. We don't even order anything out of the ordinary or ask for things to be made differently than what is on the menu. There was one time a pizza took over an hour to come out of the kitchen. My sister was so hungry she was in tears. At least we get a lot of free meals because the service is bad though? /shrug
D. L.,"Atlanta, GA",100,121,11,2.0,12/9/2012,Service was OK but our food arrived cold and it took FOREVER TO COME! Seriously?! Send that food out as soon as its ready duh!
Jeff J.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,28,,1.0,2/3/2013,"Im incredibly appalled by the experience my girlfriend and i had. She has a serious shellfish allergy which we are always very up front about and ask for a allergy menu. After ordering and getting half way through our meal we were advised that shrimp might have been fried with her entree. We left immediately to go to the hospital and sure enough about half way to there, she had an allergic reaction. We called corporate and they offered no help other than an apology. Such a big chain shouldn't have issues with cross contamination. Steer clear"
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,156,32,5.0,3/25/2013,"I loved my dining experience here! I was a little skeptical at first, but I was wrong! I drove up to the newer building and was in shock. TGI Fridays turned into a beautiful stone building. I walked up to the revolving door and saw that there was hardly anyone there, which is a nice surprise compared to the other BJ's I have been to, which are always way too crowded for my liking. I've learned to treat the customer like they are always right, especially when it comes to their name. I wish the person putting in our name had less of an attitude and am glad that was not a foreshadow of the rest of the meal. We ordered our food and when I had a question about something my waitress tried to help and then stopped another waiter to ask. The waiter, who was not our waiter, than went back to try and find the answer and came back to tell us-That is great service.  We got refills without having to ask for them, got our food quickly, which was delicious, and had great overall service. It was fairly quiet, especially for BJ's.  I enjoyed eating here and will probably go out of my way to eat at this location, rather than another location."
