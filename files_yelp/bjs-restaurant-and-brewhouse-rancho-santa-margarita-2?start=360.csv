Claire B.,"Winter Park, FL",33,105,82,2.0,10/7/2012,service was very slow.  The order wasn't correct and my salad was lacking the chicken that was supposed to be in there.  Disappointing.
Mark R.,"Golden, CO",0,47,,2.0,3/10/2015,I used to really love BJ's but I have to say it has seriously declined. Food quality is way down.
Lauren M.,"Orange County, CA",7,59,39,3.0,7/8/2013,"Go for the pizza and beer...and the fact that they are one of the only places open late in RSM. But leave the rest of the menu alone. Our pizza was great as usual but the Chicken Marsala was close to awful. I order the dish frequently, some are good and some are great but this was not even recognizable as Marsala. The sauce was a dark thick goop and even after asking for extra mushrooms all I got was a few slivers. The chicken was tender and after fishing it out...I was done! The jalapeño burger was ok...nothing special though. 4 stars for pizza/ 2 for everything else."
Bonnie C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,29,1,1.0,12/2/2012,"Normally I like BJs, but this isn't the usual efficiently run restaurant. Just got home from our 2.5 hour debacle and the service and food absolutely sucked, it was horrible. Children's spaghetti had meatballs that could NOT be cut with a knife, no exaggeration. Fish & chips were cold, greasy and soggy, fries cold. Came with no tarter sauce and asked for it (3) times to no avail. We just wanted our check and leave but that wasnt happening either, server now was avoiding us like the plague after complaining and it took another 30 minutes to get our check. We paid and looked at the bill and realized we were charged for 3 sides that should have been included with our meals. Sunday night manager was informed but he couldn't be bothered either. This location is really bad compared to other locations, so save your money and avoid it"
Chad M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/25/2014,"My wife and I went there on lunch and she ordered their lunch special, a half sandwich of their chicken club.  She didn't even eat all of the half sandwich and is now really sick with Salmonella poisoning symptoms.  She's having really bad headaches to where she's in tears and throwing up a lot.  I've talked to other friends that have gone here and they have have also stomach cramps and also got sick from their meat being raw in the middle.  We will never go here again."
Kerry F.,"Las Vegas, NV",165,39,,4.0,8/16/2013,So delicious. I love their extensive menu! My favorite thing is the honey crispy chicken salad. Holy moly. Best salad ever.
DeAnn M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",300,40,11,1.0,2/5/2013,"It's all smiles when you walk in and everyone standing around.. get seated in a tiny 2-top table when the whole place is empty.. Service very slow, wait staff brings wrong food to table, had to clarify my order then ask for the correct dressing for my salad,  then brings to go boxes when we had nothing on the table. No refill on drinks, once the male server see's the credit card to pay he walks the other way totally avoiding the fact that maybe people are on their lunch hour.  15 minutes later,  ended up paying in cash to avoid wait times.. Food average.. and it seemed like we had stepped into the twilight zone.  Would NOT recommend this location. Management was a joke and so was the waiter that served our table. Clowns for wait staff.   Will Never return to this location."
Bill C.,"La Quinta, CA",1,22,,2.0,12/11/2011,"After being open for over a month the service still needs allot of work slow waiting for someone to take charge  To long a wait because u are busy,waiters really slow and don't get an order correct it's ask and ask for every thing"
Page N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",53,54,1,5.0,9/9/2012,"The $20 soup or salad, medium pizza and pazuki- fantastic deal :) Great food. Has some of the best tortilla soup and clam chowder I have eaten in California. First time eating their pizza today, and thought it was great. Service was fantastic. Highly recommend this restaurant."
Marissa K.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",100,5,,1.0,11/11/2014,"We have been coming to this location for years, and have always enjoyed it. But recently the service and food have been poor. We came for lunch today and half of the restaurant was empty, yet it took them 15 minutes for us - a party of 3 - to be seated. We had waited an hour and 15 minutes for our pizzas to arrive to our table. Have definitely seen better days here. Hope they can get better."
Suzanne S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,100,,1.0,1/16/2013,"Seriously?  I have heard horrible things since this place opened, and was definitely not intending to ever go here, but family was in town over the holiday's, and they thought this place would be easy and central for everyone.  There were five of us (no kids), and were quoted a 25-35 minute wait.  1 hour and 10 minutes later, we were seated.  It was ridiculous!  The service wasn't rude or disrespectful, but it definitely wasn't great.  Why pay these outrageous prices for mediocrity?"
Wyndi M.,"Frisco, TX",12,79,19,2.0,11/8/2012,"Friday night, came in around 8:30p. Place was packed but found a table open at the bar. Everything about this place is SLOW! Only thing that came fast was the hubby's beer. Unfortunately for me the server forgot to put the order in for mixed drink.  We found this out after waiting a good 20 min. Food was slow...takin our check was even slower!  Let us pay and get out of here already!  Food is standard BJs."
Courtney A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4,28,84,5.0,7/2/2012,"Yikes!  This place has so many foul reviews! I've had nothing but great experiences here. I work across the street so my coworkers and I frequent this place often. Now I will say...we only sit in the bar...I've sat in the regular seating maybe twice so maybe it is different...but the bartenders, cocktail waiters and waitresses are fast...very cool...and we always have a great time! Coming from a business that deals with customer service....you will never please everyone....definitely think you should give this place a chance!"
Marcelo R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",8,40,15,2.0,12/13/2012,"Food is ok, service sucks and is   s l o w. if you want to get dinner better get a table around lunch time."
Ryan M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",49,11,,1.0,4/19/2012,"Well, if you want a great restaurant with fast hot food, I suggest walking across the street to McDonald's, cause you sure as hell won't get any of that at the B.J.s in RSM. I've been there twice now... Both times I've had the same experience.. Hostess are extremely friendl however servers take a few minutes to take our drink order, and another few minutes to bring it, another 5-10minutes to ask if we are ready to order and if you are and do order takes easily 30minutes to receive it. First experience: M girlfriend and I order 1(one) diet coke 1(one) water and 1(one small pizza) around 12:30pm( my girlfriend was on a lunch break and she gets an hour) At 12:45 my girlfriend gets her diet coke and before I can ask for my water the waitress turns around and walks away. Around 13:00(1pm) no water no pizza no server to be found. I got up and found a hostess and asked were my server was and the hostess said and I shit you not "" I don't know I'm not a server."" Around 13:15(1:15pm) I got up and found a manager and said ""we needed to go and I left $3 dollars on the table for our server if you can find her"" His responses "" What about the Pizza?"" My response"" what pizza?"" He goes"" I saw you eat a pizza"" Now, if I did, I wouldn't have a problem paying for it, but since I never got it I shouldn't have to wait 45minutes to NOT get it than pay for it. I laughed at his comment and tried to leave with my girlfriend, and which point the manager said "" if I leave without paying he will call the cops"" I looked and him and said"" go for it"" Needless to say he does call the cops and I get pulled over on my way to drop my girlfriend off at work. I explain to the police officer that we never received our pizza and we had to go.  Long story short, after reviewing the videos the cops determined that the server took the pizza to the wrong table and that the manager thought I was that table( I have a Mohawk with full sleeves of tattoos, pretty sure I'm noticeable) After that experience, my girlfriend convinced me to try it again so I do with similar problems. Slow to take our order, slow to bring it out. Wrong bill total. Double charged for beer, again server claiming I consumed it. Than pizza was colder than my beer. Order wings and pizza and got the pizza first and Wings at the same time the waitress took out empty pizza bin. Seriously after reading the reviews on yelp, I'm amazed that they are still open.  If only had one restaurant server worst than this, and that was at DICKs last resort, And even than dicks gets my order correct."
Summer Y.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,2,,1.0,1/18/2014,"So many times I have wanted to leave some negative reviews for places that really got under my skin. But I didn't want to waste my time bi***ing about an irrelevant place.  Disclaimer: I love BJs. A lot. My boyfriend and I go here at least 2-3 times a week.  Now on to the bad~ This location is absolutely horrendous. I dread going here but sometimes we don't always feel like going to the Laguna hills location but we go to get the beer and yummy food although service is horrible. Each and every time the host/hostesses fall short of their small duties; No greeting when you walk in ""hi welcome to bjs"" nothing but a blank stare ""how many, okay 2, step to the side"" literally. Also walk past them texting in there little booth as you walk out and nothing! Thanks for coming! Have a good day. Nope. Besides all this service is beyond slow even when not even half way full! But really is this location ever full? There's always a front parking spot and never a wait time, that says something. Also don't expect utensils, refills or friendly fast service.  MOST IMPORTANT REASON IM WRITING THIS REVIEW: my bf and I ate here Thursday night around 8pm and then at 4am Friday I woke up to violent food poisoning! Threw up at least 5-6times every hour from 4am-1pm let me not forget to mention things coming out both ends! Until around 1pm my boyfriend decided I needed to go to the hospital where I laid in a hospital bed for 7hrs hooked up to an iv! That was seriously probably the most sick I'd ever been in my life. Now Saturday night after being in bed all day and eating nothing but 3 jello cups and like 4 crackers. My boyfriend has now come down with it as well. I hoped it was just my entree that made me sick so that it wouldn't be the appetizer and make him sick as well but we both see how that went. HILIGHT: Pros! Front row parking, zero wait time CONS: a trip to the hospital, slow service, inexperienced staff."
Larry B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",7,3,,1.0,6/30/2014,"Our server shed light on why we had to wait over an hour to get our order (4 people). As it was, our order was brought out in two stages. Of course, this meant we either had to let first-up orders get cold or watch the others eat so they could return the favor in 15 minutes. ""Our kitchen has always been way too small to serve our customers in a timely manner. I think they already know this but have done nothing about it and we (the servers) wish we knew why and could speed it up (kitchen remodel)."" This hit is not intended for the servers as they weren't to blame although it would have been better if manager would have shown his or her face so we could pass along these comments in person."
Holly L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",76,49,12,1.0,7/30/2014,I have tried this place many many times in the hopes they could get it together. For a chain restaurant they should know how to run food.  The servers at this location are terrible.  I pushed to keep going here but every time I am so upset when I leave I just can't do it.   No matter how you order your food will overlap.  They do not know how to space out the tickets. If I order an app and it takes 15-20 maybe you shouldn't let the salads come out first especially if they were ordered 10 minutes later!!!! Keep the drinks full.  If you want me to think you are busy don't stand and talk to coworkers right in front if me.  Just know that the further you are from the kitchen the longer and more messed up your food delivery time will be. No one wants to run food that far and it is obvious.  I can't even blame one person because the last 5 were terrible in their own way.   One girl told me my salad was wrong because the salad cook was mad at her.  Gee I really want to eat this food now!  I will not be coming back.  Better off at Selma's.
Edmund G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,35,6,1.0,6/1/2013,"I used to like BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse where ever we went and I was so happy that TGIF's left, but we have gone here multiple times and nothing went right.  The service was slow, the food was cold, the prices are high for what you get, and on and on and on.  I would highly recommend against going here."
Ted L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,1,5.0,12/18/2014,Good food and great service. Happy hour specials are wirth the trip from anywhere. Here with family and friends.
