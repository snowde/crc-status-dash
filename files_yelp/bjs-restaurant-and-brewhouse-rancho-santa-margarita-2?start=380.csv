terry m.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,19,2,1.0,1/5/2013,Servers were ok but the food has really gone down in quality.  They brought out our food a different times and luke warm at best.  Sodas over filled with ice and empty fast. Will not return.
Leila D.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/10/2014,"BJ's is consistently providing amazing service and food. I have an extreme gluten and nut allergy, and BJ's has not disappointed me. The manager comes out to talk to me each time, and WATCHES the chef cook my meal. Staff is respectful and knowledgeable."
M W.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,12,,2.0,11/14/2013,"Normally, I would send this kind of response to corporate. From reading the reviews, it seems that their corporate office doesn't respond to emails. I only wished I'd read these reviews before adventuring here again and not while I was sitting in the restaurant wondering if it was only me that thought this place provide horrible service. Tonight was the first time I had been to this restaurant in 7 or 8mos. I just left what will be my very last visit to this establishment. What make me rate this place low is the service. We use to come to this restaurant frequently but after a while we went to this place less and less. The reason is simply that it takes an awful long time to have food brought to the table. This place has been opened for around 2yrs at least. This has been plenty of time to figure out how to bring customer orders faster. It comes off as if it's a constant  issue regarding employee scheduling. It should be easily known the busiest hours and there should be enough staff. Otherwise, the managers on duty need to be in the kitchen running orders or cooking. I arrived this evening, placed an appetizer order, and food order. The server asked to start with drinks but fearing we wouldn't see her for another extended amount of time, I ordered everything and clearly stated our mozarella sticks would be an appetizer. After waiting well beyond the time for mozarella sticks, I told the nearest person who came our way, busboy, to cancel our appetizer since the food should be coming out soon. Or so I thought! Shortly after, a staff member came over with a salad that was apart of my child's meal. I told her that I wanted our appetizer cancelled since we are now receiving part of a meal that was intended not to be an appetizer. The server comes over and attempt to state that the kitchen is backed up and it's within the amount of time since our meals were not on the table. Seriously!?! One adult and one child, an appetizer, and two meals! The child's salad had come out. What are the odds the kid will eat cheese sticks and the rest of the meal at this point!?! What do we still need an appetizer for when the food is starting to come out, and it's only two people eating tonight. After I refused the appetizer, our server did not return to our table until after we were done eating our meal. sThere was no return visit ater the food had been brought to the table to see if we needed anything or to inquire about the food's taste. When the plates are practically emptied is not a time to ask is everything alright.  I would just like the restauarant and server to know, your service is crappy. I normally leave a 20-25% tip, because years ago I worked as a server part-time. I couldn't bring myself to do it after our server never came to check on us after the meal arrived to the table. I left the crappy 15% tip which was only $2.25 to reflect the crappy service received and due to the restaurant constantly being slow and seeming to have a ""it's alright to not provide service"" attitude. You will not have to worry about me refusing another appetizer, because we will not be back. I know I used a kid's free meal coupon, but I was prepared to leave a tip on the amount before the coupon which would had been $4 or $5 on our $20 meal prior to the coupon difference. Had we received our appetizer before the meal started to arrive, I would had probably left a $5 or $6 tip.  Even after I asked for the general manager's card from the hostess as we were leaving, there was no acknowledgement from the hostess booth about a manager-on-duty being available to respond to my concerns. The food taste was fine, but there is no way I will be at this place again.  It's almost as if they hired the people who use to work at the El Torito's, and thank goodness that place closed."
Mon S.,"Simi Valley, CA",27,216,61,3.0,4/19/2014,"Visited on a Saturday for lunch, there were 5 in our party and the restaurant wasn't at all crowded. We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken right away. Everyone got their drinks almost immediately, mine took a little longer, I got a tickled pink , it was tasty but weak. We ordered and it didn't take too long for us to get our food, but there was one thing wrong, one person in our party was served a burnt pizza they set it down in front of him apologized for burning the first one and told him if he wanted he could eat it and they were making him another one. They seemed very befuddled that the oven overcooked the food but they more than made up for it in service apologizing profusely and giving him a free pizza to go. My quesadilla was decent, what you would expect from BJs. The pizookies are good too as is the berry beer. I would definitely come back here if I was in the area again for the drinks, atmosphere, and service."
Jenna M.,"Silverado, CA",78,20,7,3.0,11/9/2013,Not super impressed with this location. Been to a lot of BJs and I always order the crusted Parmesan chicken because it's nothing short of amazing and delicious usually. I offered it tonight along with artichoke dip as an appetizer. The artichoke dip came our cold and watery. It still tasted good though so we are it. My entree was sadly lacking all the flavor I have grown to love. It was very bland. Looks like I'll have to try something new next time. Oh well. The service was really good though. Ou waiter was very attentive and nice. He talked pretty fast and was sometimes hard to understand but was very good. Definitely have mixed feelings about this location.
Matt D.,"San Clemente, CA",26,11,1,2.0,5/31/2012,"A marginal upgrade over the TGI Fridays that used to be here... the food ranges from mediocre to decent, but the service at this location is terrible. One server tried to give us our bill 5 minutes after we got our entrees. There are better places to eat in RSM, and better BJs in Orange County."
Juli Y.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",60,22,,1.0,9/5/2014,"This BJ's is consistent only in their poor service. We try this location about every 6 months and nothing ever improves. You wait for your food regardless of if you are in a small group (2 - 4 people) or a larger group (8+). I am constantly amazed that this location stays in business. When we want BJs food, we go to Laguna Beach. It's like a completely different restaurant!"
Vu D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",6,2,,1.0,12/26/2011,"Horrible service. Seated for 15 mins without being helped. Took 45 mins for chips and salsa. When our pizza finally came out before our two kids meals, it was cold! Told the manager and walked out. Waitress was the worst I've encountered for a very long time! Went to McDonalds instead."
Becca S.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",101,8,,2.0,6/7/2013,"Ok so I really hate writing reviews here. I work for a business that gets needlessly slammed by customers who only had a bad experience because of their own impossible to please attitudes. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt before I do this.  I love BJ's. The food is always great, so I was naturally really happy when the new arrival came to RSM. Problem is, The food is always yummy, but every time I go there is ALWAYS a problem with the staff and service. Whether it is that the food comes out wrong, or the service is really really slow, or the server is not very helpful or nice.  I just went there for lunch today and we had to wait 30 min just to order food, our server was given way Way too many tables so she didn't come to check on us and once we put our food in it took 50 min just to get to the table.  If this kind of thing happened only once in a while I don't really mind. Everyone makes mistakes or gets really busy and we all know that stuff happens. However when it happens 75% of the time, I feel like someone needs to say something so it doesn't keep happening.  I was hoping it would only be like that at first when all the kitchen staff and servers were learning but that looks like its not the case.  I am sorry to say that I probably won't be going to this  BJ's again anytime soon."
Tricia W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",71,34,10,1.0,12/11/2011,I'm strictly giving the BAR a 1 star---Is this a joke?? The bartender not only made racist jokes but then----forgot to put our order in...AND (THE WORST)-- had ZERO education on the beer he was pouring!! I am a bartender and find it ridiculous that u haven't been educated---nor took the time to educate your self on what you are pouring back there--- a disgrace to REAL bartenders and beer lovers!!! Is there a bar manager???? FAIL!
Ryan L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,9,,2.0,8/16/2012,The food amazing and the price is amazing but the service is horrible. Every time I come her I have to wait 10 minutes before someone comes and takes my order. After I order it takes the servers about another 10 minutes to bring out the drinks. Its impossible to get a refill because the waiters never come around. Overall its not worth coming to because of the awful service.
Kris D.,"Lake Forest, CA",12,6,,2.0,2/28/2013,"Wow! Slower than slow service on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. Not even close to a full restaurant. We sat at our table for a good 10 minutes before I asked a random server if we had a server for our table. After 3 different servers we finally got drinks and our order taken. Food took forever!! There were only 4 of us, 2 being kids, and our lunch took at least 35 to 40 minutes. I never saw a manager. No one really seemed to care. I think I'll stick to the BJ's in laguna hills."
Sara G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,40,5,1.0,2/24/2014,"I have tried time and time again to give this BJs a chance, but it is just plain bad; everyone from the hosts to the servers are rude and S-L-O-W. We went there for dinner with the family and my two kids were in tears, actual tears, because the food took SO long...OVER AN HOUR after we ordered and the restaurant was not packed by any means. All of the tables around us were annoyed, many talked to the manager but nothing was done. All my kids want from BJs is the Pizookie. The waitress walked over to hand us our bill...she knew we had HAD IT. My son looked at me and asked if he could get dessert and the waitress said, "" Maybe another night, it will take too long."" I don't understand why this restaurant is not paying attention to all of their reviews."
John D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/27/2014,"Went there Saturday night and it took forever to get our food.  They brought my daughters food out before ours and that's fine but we didn't get our food literally until about 25 minutes after she got hers. She was done by he time we got ours.  When we finally got it, it was wrong. I ordered the fish taco's fried, they came out grilled.  I would have ate them but when I looked inside to check and make sure I noticed that there was 2 tiny little pieces of fish and the rest was all garnish.. what a joke.  Our server was good and apologetic but I was surprised no manager ever came over to apologize.  Just a terrible experience.. I will not be coming back here again.. I will make the drive to the Laguna Hills location..  It's much better !"
Mr. C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4,52,,3.0,6/15/2015,"The visit tonight was the first in over 3 years.  When this location opened, it was a cluster f*ck.  The waits to sit were forever and take-out orders even longer.  The service was bad and the food was mediocre at best and did not reflect the food that came out of other BJ's restaurants.  For that reason and the fact that we had a $25 gift card, we visited tonight.  Although they have improved since first opening, the service fell a bit short tonight as well as the food.  the kids pizza was good and so were the brussel sprouts.  I guess stick to pizza only at a pizza joint, right?   I ordered the Bison burger and it was not that good.  Asked for no sauce and came with sauce.  The flavor was ok, but all in all not that great.  My wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it was ""ok"", but again, not that great.  The brussel sprouts were pretty good though and probably the only thing that we had that was really good.  My water glass sat empty for nearly 10 minutes, not sure where the waiter was.  All in all the food and service weren't that impressive at all, not compared to the other great independently owned restaurants that are around."
Scott S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",7,1,1,2.0,10/27/2011,"The last few visits it has been mostly high school kids serving, slow service, over/under cooked food and long wait times. I still go to this location just because it's closer than Laguna hills, but I much prefer Selma's, La Fiesta Mexican Grill or ihop over BJ's if I have to choose."
Wendy P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",45,9,,1.0,10/25/2011,"What a joke! My husband and I ordered dinner at 6:35 on line and were supposed to pick it up at 7:15. Seemed like a reasonable amount of time to get or order done on a Sunday night.  Well I guess not. My husband got there at 7:15, was asked to pay before he got his food and waited for an hour total all the while with the hostesses telling him it would only be a few more minutes.  After an hour he finally demanded to speak with a manager. The manager refunded his money but couldn't figure out how to refund the tip so we got a $10 gift card. My husband walked out after wasting over an hour waiting with no food in hand and a couple of gift cards to a place he now despises. Do not order food to go from here if you can help it. I think monkeys could do a better job."
Jun H.,"East Irvine, Irvine, CA",221,477,581,2.0,3/8/2012,"I decided to give this BJ's a second chance and had lunch here recently. Again, our food took an unreasonably long time to get to our table and a lot of employees seemed to be milling around or undergoing training. No apologies for the wait and they even forgot to bring out my side salad. Oops! I do not get this location."
R.F. D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",24,13,,3.0,3/7/2013,"If you've been to BJ's before, don't expect anything less or anything extra. It is what it is. I had the ahi salad and it was pretty great. This BJ's is a safe bet if you're looking for something to eat and you don't want to risk visiting a kitchen nightmare. At the same time it isn't anything you're going to rave about either."
Michele R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,9,6,4.0,10/17/2012,"Truly haven't had a bad meal here!  Great selection of food, beer, etc.  My husband and I had lunch there last week and it was busy.  We ordered a 'small bite' artichoke appetizer and the rest of our lunch.  Got to chatting and realized that after my soup came that we didn't get the appetizer. Chatted with the waiter and he completely forgot to include it.  We said no worries -- they brought it and we ate it up!  Then the Manager came over and completely apologized for the goof, etc.  When the bill arrived, they had removed the appetizer.  We weren't expecting that!  I am all about a great meal but equally is the customer service and BJs delivered!  Sorry some of the other folks that have written reviews didn't have the same experience we had."
