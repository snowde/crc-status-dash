Clive A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Their take out the worst. Frequently gets order wrong and much longer than it should.  If you order take out, give them a time that is 20 minutes before you need it. They typically run that late. And they really don't seem to care.  But the food is decent. Service is blah, food is good"
Renee A.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",2,3,,1.0,6/18/2017,This is definately a very sub par BJs. We had 6 for lunch and every single person had a problem with their order!! Salad was wet and wilted dripping with dressing. Wrong pizza delivered. No butter served with toast by the time it arrived toast was cold. Pizza was not hot!  Out of caramel for the caramel pzookie!! Absolutely terrible! Wouldnt recommend and will never be back!
Becca A.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,2,1,4.0,10/17/2017,"I have always loved BJs because their food always seems to be so good! I'm vegetarian and they have lots of great choices that don't have meat in the meal. I personally recommend their Italiano Vegetable Penne with the tomato mozzarella salad on the side - both are so delicious and great together. I went to this located for the first time last Friday on a double date with my boyfriend and our friends and had a great experience. The waiter/server constantly checked on us and our order came out just as ordered and fast. I'm so sad I forgot the guys name because he was great! I accidentally spilled a glass of water on the table and he was quick to help clean it and get new napkins for us. (Sorry about the spill!!) Great customer service. The only reason for the missing star is that the women's restroom was quiet dirty that night and only one stall seemed ""okay"" to use. However my friend and I told one of the girls at the counter about the restrooms and she said they would get someone to clean it."
Alex D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/10/2016,Bad experience Serice no good. Too slow unfriendly Food not impressive. Looks nice in picture. Taste not so much Ambiance too noisy
Alley R.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",5,75,60,5.0,4/29/2016,"Emily D you are the absolute best.  The two (cough-cough) young ladies loves your efficient service, your bubbly attitude, attention to detail, high spirited personality really energizes the atmosphere.   I'd say your one reason why BJ's is winning!  Food was great, company was excellent, what more can you ask for on a Friday night?"
Terrence Y.,"Laguna Beach, CA",241,142,1836,4.0,1/24/2016,"Yelp 100 Challenge 16/100 This is the closest BJ's I've ever lived near so it's really convenient to grab a beer and watch a game. I've seen more tv screens at some of the other BJ's, but there are enough to see any game fairly well.  I've always liked their micro brewed beers, but I wish they carried other craft beers from the awesome selection we have in So Cal. They have a large menu, but I usually stick with their pizzas said since there's is different from most of the pizza places in So Cal. While it's not real Chicago style pizza, it does have a great taste. I like the BJ's Favorite, which is basically a combo supreme. They're also great during lunch because you can get their main menu items at a lunch price. The lunch dishes also come out relatively quickly as they cater to busy worker lunch hours."
Mark M.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,30,7,2.0,5/3/2017,"Service is always great, but their steaks and burgers are disastrous. Medium is always well done here."
Janet J.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,10,17,4.0,10/7/2016,"If it's Tuesday it's time for prime rib.  Oh so good at BJ's.  Sorry taco Tuesdays.  The waitress Tara makes it special, she is friendly as well as efficient. See you next Tuesday."
Jade M.,"Lake Forest, CA",54,54,44,4.0,5/30/2017,"Was pretty good! I haven't been to a bj's for years, but the food was good and the service was very friendly and welcoming. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and it's nice that they are open later than a lot of other places around. Will definitely be back again!"
Janet J.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,25,3,1.0,3/14/2017,When two people order meals they should be served at the same time and not 8 minutes apart. I found that extremely rude and this has happen more then once at the RSM location.
Chris G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",10,2,,5.0,6/18/2017,BJs is always amazing love the pizzas and pastas well everything is great here I've yet to have a negative experience at a BJs. And Pazookie!!!!
Toni M.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",9,14,33,5.0,5/3/2016,"Best prime rib ever! Will be back on Tuesdays for more! Well, I'm back again! The whole meal is Delicious!"
Ron D.,"Trabuco, CA",1,35,3,5.0,5/21/2017,"I don't go to BJs very often, but went last night (Sat May 20) around 5:15 PM and it was awesome. Service was fast and very friendly. It was a hot evening so started with a single shot of tequila. Ordered the avocado egg rolls and they were great. Had an Ahi salad along with a sculpin grapefruit IPA. It really hit the spot! Awesome dinner and excellent experience."
Zack B.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",3,27,,3.0,3/30/2017,"Food is typical decent BJs. However don't come here if you want to watch a local game. They've got probably a dozen tvs throughout the restaurant, 4 in the bar. 1 was on Ducks (fine), one on Lakers post game, one on Mississippi vs Mississippi St baseball, and one on a HS basketball 3 pt competition. Meanwhile the Angels Dodgers game was on and no one could figure out how to put it on a tv."
Peiyu H.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",0,13,20,3.0,5/7/2017,"I love the food here, but the service is very slow, take forever for the food to come out, and I always fell unattended. Now I just call in and order to go, which is pretty timely."
Danae L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,6,2,1.0,4/14/2017,"Every few months i like to order a Pizookie online and pick it up curbside. I was going to order the white chicokate macadamia pizookie only to find out they don't have it at the location anymore. which is fine so i decided to order a beignet. i places the order for 2:00 and arrived at 2:02. i called the number and the gentleman said my order would be out shortly. next thing i know it's 2:45 and I AM STILL WAITING. so i call again, and within 2 minutes my order comes out. i get home thinking i'll have a nice hot beignet that the ice cream will melt over but no, it was room temperature and it wasn't soft and fluffy. i'm so disappointed. if you're going to make me wait 45 minutes at least make sure it's hot and fresh."
Mary W.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/17/2017,"This is a good local favorite whether dining in or taking it to go. Food is constantly delicious. Had the vegitarian pasta and garlic knotts,last night. Portions are always plentiful so had leftovers this morn for breakfast."
Priscilla H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/21/2017,great time at bj's tonight! the hostess i think sophia was very sweet and helpful. loved the extreme pepperoni:)
Alexander C.,"Carson, CA",94,16,10,1.0,6/14/2016,"First time at this location, 4 problems: 1) Placed a curbside pickup order - I had the app up and showed this bill was paid, was in the right car, had my ID, and she still made me pull up my work email to prove who I was (I get 300 emails a day, so that was a 15min process). 2) They got the wrong side dish (slaw instead of fries). 3) The bison burger was extra well done, instead of medium. 4) The bottom half of the bread was stale to the point that I removed it and folded the entire sandwich against itself to eat it. Pizookie was good though."
Brad O.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",223,205,120,3.0,7/22/2016,"This BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a pretty good stop for a nice weekday lunch. We had the California Chicken Club and the Derby-Style Chicken Cobb with a couple pints of brew. Food and atmosphere were delicious and comfortable; everything was great except for the service. The hostess staff seemed green and our waiter was pretty mediocre. Saw him twice at the table. To make things worse he pouted during his second visit about being ""stuck"" with us outside on the patio... No matter though, we still tipped well. Pros: Piranha Pale Ale Cons: Dogs through the revolving door...   I don't know why BJ's has a revolving door other than for aesthetics, but we nearly saw a Peekapoo with a fake service animal vest get decapitated while the owner spun through. A-OK."
