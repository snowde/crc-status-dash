Amanda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/13/2013,"I was so excited for a large family-friendly restaurant to open in town, and we've enjoyed BJ's at other locations in the past, so it sounded perfect to us.  Sadly, we've been very disappointed every single time we've tried this RSM location. The restaurant is nice-looking, but the food is just terrible! I'm not sure how the food can vary so much from location to location, but my husband and I have decided that we will never return to this location because it's just been so terrible every time. What a bummer, since we live nearby and enjoy eating out!  Last time we were there, I ordered a pizza, thinking they couldn't go too wrong with their signature dish, but it was disgusting -- I couldn't eat more than a few bites, and went home still hungry. It was soggy, bland, and just a mess. For a while, we thought we might at least still go there occasionally just for a pizookie, but then we noticed that Selma's has a pizookie-type dessert on their menu (called the mothership). So nope, we're done with BJ's!"
Guy S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",9,36,1,4.0,7/9/2013,"Second chance today didn't start well.  4:00, they weren't busy, maybe 10 customers, yet we stood at the hostess station for over five minutes while the bartender looked over our way several times and didn't do a thing to welcome us.  Finally greeted and seated by Emily, who ended up being our server too.  She gave excellent and cheerful service!  YAY, the rack of ribs were delicious/fall off the bone and the sides were good too [get the green beans!]. Tuesday is the day to go for 1/2 price on all wines.  BJ's proved worthy of another visit."
Jeremy B.,"Olympia, WA",2,14,,1.0,10/19/2011,"Do yourself a favor right now, and go to the one down on El Toro / 5 Fwy instead. They literally screwed up every single part of our order here. Wrong dishes, missing orders, 30 minutes for an appetizer soup without telling us how long it would take, cold food, it just goes on and on. I wouldn't have left this review if not for the fact they didn't comp our food. I am never coming back to this location again. I honestly have never seen service like this from a restaurant, ever. It was just amazing how thoroughly everything went wrong. The ONLY good thing about the evening was that our waiter, Sean, really tried his best despite being derided by 2 separate waiters within earshot of us (which was confusing, unprofessional, and completely uncalled for!) Completely horrifying experience."
Jeff N.,"Coto De Caza, CA",63,4,,1.0,10/24/2011,"We ate here Sunday PM arrived at 11:15 left around 1:15. If you have young kids that can't wait for their food leave them at home. The training mgr with a star on his collar threw my kids a bag of oyster crackers and said the General Manager would be over to talk to us. Every table around us ordered after we did, but were served before us. Uhm you would think the GM would throw us some love beside a ""sorry"" and some crackers since the sign/plaque with his name on it out front says share holder... lol maybe that's why.  By the way why would you have to wait so long for soup and salad? New restaurant or not!  lame choices in handling the situation."
Joy J.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,69,5,3.0,3/26/2014,"Slow, slow, and slow!  I've eaten inside and also taken to-go and can't seem to win either way.  The service is so-so at best and they are dumb slow (as in clueless and unorganized) - it's not intentionally slow as in fine dining - it's just poorly run/managed with inadequate servers.  Surprisingly, the to-go desk is even worse than sit-down.  Call ahead and they don't have drinks ready, item not packed - they have to run into the kitchen because they forgot something, person at counter gets stuck on register screen.. you name it!  The food is actually good so it's a shame the restaurant is so poorly managed because the Laguna Niguel location is great.  Hello corporate BJ's - get new management for RSM (and tell them to clean house and rid some of the lame servers/staff)!!!"
David B.,"San Diego, CA",29,137,26,5.0,1/30/2012,"Was here for a 40th birthday party and we had a group of about 40 people.  Service was excellent, food was good and plentiful.  Really took good care of the group and I didn't see any unhappy party-goers.  All in all a great experience."
Nicknamed B.,"Riverside, CA",0,101,19,4.0,7/12/2012,"So, BJs replaced a TGI Fridays and boy we were STOKED. My husband and I have been here a few times since they opened and it was good each time.  We went for lunch each time and they were hoppin' busy. But our service was still good. The only thing, is that I was pregnant at the time so I wanted a Root Beer(no caffeine) and the waiter talked me into their signature Root Beer they make. It really wasn't that good - but that's my personal taste. Everything else was great."
Brandon L.,"Atascadero, CA",443,261,28,4.0,11/6/2011,"I always enjoy going to BJ's.  Our server last week was Bri, she was great."
Jamie G.,"Irvine, CA",46,109,61,5.0,8/30/2012,Love this place! Amazing food and beer. The hef and blonde are my favorites. The 2 people $20 deal is awesome. Got it with my hubby for date night and even had left overs for lunch today. 2 salads I had the feta watermellon hubby had the Cesar then buffalo chicken pizza (with blue cheese yummm) and we got out pazooki togo(1/2 Choc chip 1/2 peanut butter) our total bill with tip was under $40 and we each had a beer ;) I highly recommend this place and we will for sure be back!
Peter L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",41,82,59,1.0,11/5/2011,Staff not trained food servers cold and it took 55 mins.  We were given bread and told its almost coming and wait an additional 15 mins.  Was here last week for lunch and had to wait for servers to show up for work before sitting and we got there at 11:10am and the open at 11:00 am.  Really lack training in staff and kitchen.
Wendy B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",164,12,107,2.0,5/8/2012,"This was the second time I have tried this BJ's location and did not leave as happy as I should have after going out to eat.  My food was cold as well as my sons.  Although they brought us a new one, the food was less than......well microwaved food. Service was very, very slow. To spent a $100 on a meal for my family, should not leave wishing we had stayed home."
Shanel D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/31/2015,"Went to this location this afternoon (a Saturday) with my 2 children, and the place was pretty empty. Yet, when we walked in, 2 other groups were waiting to be seated and the hostess was nowhere to be found. I saw several servers walk by, but no one offered us so much as a ""someone will be with you shortly."" When she finally did arrive, she seemed flustered. We waited to be seated (in an empty restaurant), but my son had chosen to go there so I tried to make the best of it. When we were taken to our seat they tried giving us a small table in the middle, but when dining alone with my kids, I find booths to be easier & more comfortable so I asked for one. She let me take one (they were all empty in that section), but seemed reluctant to do it. Took about 10 min to get a drink order in (2 kid milks & I water). Food order was taken in a timely manner, and the server was friendly enough. However, the food took FOREVER to arrive (1 med pizza with just pepperoni and one kid's corndog meal). There was only one other group seated in my section so I have no idea what on earth took so long! The servers changed shifts during our meal & once again our replacement was friendly enough. But when it was time to pay the bill, my card and the bill folder sat at the end of our table for way too long before she took it to ring it up. She also didn't offer us a bag for our leftovers, even though we had two bulky styrofoam boxes and she saw I was alone with 2 kids in tow, (my daughter is 3, so she def takes up one hand because she holds it when we're walking in the parking lot), and it's kind of difficult balancing two styrofoam boxes in one hand. Thankfully a lovely lady at the curbside pick up station offered me a bag, unprompted, when I asked if I could leave my boxes on her counter while I took my kiddos to the restroom on the way out. She earned an extra star. I wish I would've read these reviews prior to coming here. When it first opened, it was much better, but the service has gone down tremendously. It's a real shame, too, because my son likes BJ's & we live super close by. However, I can't see us returning here again. Management really needs to get this place in order."
Cay S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,13,,5.0,2/26/2012,"I love this place. I frequent here at least a couple times a week. Drinks good, service good, Food good, pizookie is fantastic."
Alec Z.,"Orange County, CA",0,19,13,3.0,11/29/2011,"Give these guys a little break - they just opened their doors. This is by far the best buzzing place in a sleeeeeeepy RSM area. Quality of food (seared ahi salad, clam chowder in a bread bowl) + Italian wine were great. Plus, I think they have the longest menu I've seen so far and that might be the reason why it takes a while to get your food. The first rule of a good restaurant is a short menu. I did not have any issue with the timing though and the place was packed. Try having fun instead of counting the minutes. Try their beer , order some munchies while you wait and just chat to your companion. That's a good recipe for a good time. Being obsessed with time keeping never works. RSM should be happy to have a place like this. Locals will understand."
Dave B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",14,47,,2.0,2/18/2012,"Horrible service. Waiters are horrible, and just the overall management between the wait staff, bar tender, and cooks is non existent. Food and drinks never come to the table together as ordered. Most times the food is not made as advertised.  Common excuse its a brand new menu item.  Without the beer selection this would be a one star rating."
Helen M.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",1,22,2,2.0,5/8/2014,"I like BJ's but would not recommend the RSM location.  Always too cold and we have had repeated problems with service and food orders.  A take out order was incomplete and I had to drive back and pick up the rest of the order.  Last month, April 4th, we went there to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday.  Service was non-existent, food came late, half cold when it arrived, by the time ketchup came back for the burger, the others were half done eating.  Even after we told them it was a birthday celebration, nothing.  The waiter seemed surprised as I mentioned the miss as I handed back the bill he charged me for the table that just left.  The manager said he was sorry and would follow up but did not.  Choose something else to eat in RSM."
Darlene J.,"Gig Harbor, WA",48,309,25,1.0,11/30/2013,"Decided to stop here after doing some shopping for a quick lunch. My husband ordered a beer & I asked for a glass of the house wine. I was informed they had no house wine but their ""cheap"" wine was a Greg Norman! Yes the waitress (who was helping the new server) said CHEAP. After about 10 minutes our waiter (who was training) came back over & asked what we ordered cause he forgot! Another server was in ear shot & came over to assist. When I said I had ordered a Cab he said ""our house wine is"".........and it wasn't Greg Normans! OK, he explains to us that this is our waiter's first day & yadayadayada. You got a house wine or you don't it's one or the other! Anyway, after a long wait for simple food we receive our lunch. Well, I'll stick to the appetizers because my salad & flat bread lunch was horrible. Lettuce is cheap & I had the smallest salad I have ever seen & that flatbread (margarita) was tasteless. Needless to say we NEVER saw the waiter after the food came, not even to ask how our meals were! Never came back to ask if we'd like another drink nothing. Finally after being done with our meals for awhile he returned with the check! BTW we came after the lunch crowd so the place was not busy, no excuse why the waiter could not be more attentive!"
Chris T.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/4/2014,"Went last Friday night with another couple.  Asked for separate checks.  Server or cooks forgot one of our meals (pizza).  Brought the other 3 out.  Shrimp pasta (2 orders) was evidently placed under the warmer lights because the top of the pasta was crunchy and the bottom was gluey.  Sent both back.  Didn't want to order anything else.  When the checks came, they put our drinks on the other couples bill.  Took a few times for them to get it right.  Not sure what has happened to this location, used to be an okay place to go.  Will not be returning."
Emilie S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,2,2.0,4/23/2013,Great atmosphere with horrible service. There is so much opportunity for a thriving restaurant here but they need better servers. The only reason I come back is because their pazookis are bomb.
Kathy K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,8,,4.0,10/21/2011,"We ordered food to go this evening (didn't want to fight the crowds) and even though we customized both of our items, they got  them both right.  Part of why I wanted to rate them (besides being totally satisfied) is that I think it's not fair for people to come on and rate a restaurant negatively when they have been open for 5 days.  So I'm hoping my rating may help offset some of the negativity. I wonder how good these people with negative reviews were at their jobs on their second day at work."
