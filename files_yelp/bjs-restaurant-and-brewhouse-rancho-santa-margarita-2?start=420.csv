Sweetcherry D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,24,,3.0,1/28/2013,"I do love eating here however the staff always got my order wrong. I ordered a jalepeno burger with no onions and this they manage to leave onions on my burger after I said no onions! This has happened twice already. The selection of beer and buzzing night makes my anger dissapear when they let you jibber jabber like a drunken buffon. I forgive you bjs, but please no onions!"
John B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,27,10,2.0,1/10/2012,"This place is fairly new and for the most part it's pretty nice inside, although I've order food there several times now. 5 to be exact. 4 out of the 5 times I've ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup, All fourt times the soup came out cold. We also ordered the tomato and cheess salad. In the picture on the menue it looks like a huge meal. When it came out it wasnt enough to feed a rabbit. We kindly complained and the Manager took it off the menu. After she did our waitress gave us a an attitude and from then on totally rushed us. She asked if we wanted desert 5 minutes after our main course came out and when we said ""no thanks"" she came back and dropped the check when we werent even finished eating. It was real rude and really obvoius what she was doing."
Annie C.,"Honolulu, HI",3,11,1,2.0,8/11/2013,"I have debated whether or not to speak wth the manager at BJ""S but decided to post this review in hoping that management reads these comments.  We ate at BJ's on a Friday night and probably will never eat there again. I don't know if it was a full moon that night but the whole dining experience was off.  Our waitress greeted us as we were seated and took our cocktail order.  I had ordered a glass of wine and and my dining companion ordered the beer sampler(four samples).  We waited for 20 minutes before flagging down our waitress.  Her excuse was they were washing the glasses and needed to quick freeze to chill the glasses. Huh? The restaurant was not that busy and to run out of bar glasses? That's a first and definitely a poor excuse!  Our appetizers arrived first so we were sitting eating our appetizers but still no drinks. Finally, half way through eating our appetizers they finally brought our drinks.  They only brought three of the sample beers and said that they were waiting for one more glass.  One of my biggest pet peeve is when the waitstaff takes away dishes not asking if we are done yet.  They removed my companion's appetizer plate when he wasn't even done eating!  Another waitstaff removed our appetizers and there were still appetizers on the plate!!  So annoying!  My entree(seared ahi salad) was okay but my companion's hamburger was overdone and dry!  Management...please take note!   You will lose a lot of diners if you do not address these issues!  We have frequently dined at the BJ's in Laguna Hills and was very satisfied with the service and food."
Tre E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,2,3.0,9/22/2012,"Went there for my birthday, screwed up everyone order but mine, 30 person party, no discount for the mess up, other than that amazing food."
Tony S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/21/2012,"I think the service would be better if I was ordering delivery from the moon. Serious service issues,  the kitchen can't time even two meals.  The waiters (the 3 I've had) should consider other careers. Its more of a place to collect material for a stand up routine than a place to eat. We got our food and then waited 5 minutes for silverware.  10 minutes after the silverware I got my Nutty Brunette.    We waited for 34 minutes for our check.   We started to build a tepee on the pizza holder to attract the attention of anyone.  We had three beer glasses, three plates and napkins stacked about 15 inches high and the waiter still walked by us 4 times. Comical but sad.  When I run low on material a quick visit to BJ's fills up my book. Here's a suggestion.  Sit outside and order delivery service from Tutto Fresco. I seriously doubt anyone from the BJs staff will even notice."
Taylor Q.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/10/2014,"I do not recommend coming here for any type of ""sit down causal"" dining experience. the service is TERRIBLE and SO slow. I had gone here for a birthday dinner and we were sitting at our table for 2 1/2 hours to get 6 plates. it should not take this long for simple pasta dishes. we started to get BORED while waiting for our food. mind you that we came in there at 8pm on a Friday night- still late enough to beat the crowd. for the prices and the horrible experience you get at BJS it's not worth it. don't come here unless you want bad service and marginal food."
Meg Y.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,1,2.0,6/18/2014,"Coming in for Fathers Day our hope was for a tasty hot brunch served in a timely manner, but this is not what occurred.This was our first time for the brunch (we have had many tasty dinners at this BJs) and I cannot recommend it based on our experience. Selection was very limited and food was lukewarm. Orange juice in mimosa was sour. We asked for two fruit plates (side dish size) for our party of seven and when they arrived each plate had less than 1/4 cup of fruit on it and the fruit tasted of onions. We informed the waitress who was very apologetic but it still showed up on my bill :-("
Tricia S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",14,12,4,4.0,3/6/2012,"Lunch was a good deal. Unfortunately, my pizookie sat in the window too long and it was cold when we got it. They offered to bring us a new one and took it off our bill. We got three apologies. I feel mistakes happen but saying sorry makes up for it."
Pekpek P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,,2.0,4/8/2014,"Be careful of using the drive up service. If there is more then one vehicle waiting, it will take forever to get you food... There seems to be only one person that handles this service, and they have to do everything from packing up the food to handling the transaction. FYI, just go inside and pick it up yourself. The food is decent and the beer is decent as well. Typical chain restaurant."
Carl M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4,12,,4.0,10/24/2011,"i know one person complained about being greated by 5 different people but is this really a problem?  I dont think it is.  we were seated with in minutes and had one server come by to tell us who our server was but asked for our drink order, followed immediately by our waitress food came quickly and was hot and tasty.  my only real complaint is that i never recieved the side salad i ordered but did not realize it till this morning.  dont know if i was charged for it either cause it completly slipped my mind i ordered it.  oh well no harm no foul just remember to check the receipt"
S I.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",37,42,,3.0,3/29/2012,"I've eaten here a couple times now, once for dinner and once for lunch.  Service was good from our waiter.  Getting food was a little slow at dinner.  Other than that ok pizza.  If I had the choice, and I do, Selma's is much better than BJ's and would be my first choice, but BJ's does have pazooki's and a good selection of beers, although with Selma's new Tap room, I probably won't be coming here much."
Lindsay H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",37,92,1,3.0,6/4/2013,"Giving three stars...waiter we first got was terrible. Had an ego the size of an elephant after we called him out on the terrible service we got (20 min to get a menu? Another 10 min for a drink?) then he had the balls to give up our table after we chewed him out and asked for the manager and then we ask for drink refills and he said your not my table! And when were you gonna tell us this? So bitched like crazy to the manager and he sent the BEST waiter over! Its was like night and day! I believe his name was Daniel. He was on it, best service ever. Manager apologized and we got the drift the previous waiter has had so attitude problems before. Dude needs a new profession! Daniel was the man though and I will probably request to sit in his area next time cause he was so attentive and the manager was sincerely apologetic was he was notified and comped us which was unexpected but very nice. Hope this place and weed out the bad servers and get it to the high standards as the other locations. Food was delicious!"
Vic Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,16,,1.0,3/24/2012,Horrible on every level....learn how to properly train your staff and then work on serving eatable food
Isabelle L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,,2.0,5/6/2014,"First the good: I went there once and I loved the atmosphere. They have obviously spent a lot of money on the decor. The staff was friendly... maybe a little too much. The waitress would stop at our table every opportunity she got to talk with us (or should I say to my husband mostly... awkward!!). This is were it starts going down.  The food finally arrived (late): the appetizer was good, the main course was lukewarm, pretty much tasteless and expensive (Moroccan salmon), the desert was delicious. The waitress kept on stopping at our table while we were trying to eat to strike a conversation. Obviously slow day for her. But we were not coming to this restaurant to socialize with the waitress but to have a nice lunch with each other. So needless to say that my husband being the polite gentleman that he is got to eat his meal pretty cold.  But here is what really bothered me... as we were eating our desert, the waitress came by again to tell us how some customers have been ""stiffing her"" with the tip.  I thought that it was completely inappropriate. She proceeded in giving us examples. Frankly I just wanted to go home at this point without leaving her a tip but we finally opted to give her an ok tip since she had been polite (but not the 20% that I usually give).  I may give this place another chance to redeem itself but so far I am not a big fan!"
Julie L.,"Miami, FL",3,13,3,5.0,8/19/2013,Had the mango chicken salad and it was great!  Just the right amount of spicy bite with the sweetness.  Service great. Ask for Jay
Gabi O.,"Riverside, CA",3,9,,3.0,2/29/2012,"My work gets a lot of missed orders, items we didn't ask for, n pasta with no sauce. Plz improve ur services bjs"
Joe S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,4.0,5/13/2012,"I tried the Chicago style here for the first time and I was pretty good.Service is just ok. Generally the restaurant is always  crowded, but servers make sure they take care of you. Prices are reasonable. Parking is easy.  Nice place to grab dinner and a pizookie"
M A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/6/2014,"Wow, wow wow!   This was the absolute worst service we have ever received.  Went there on a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was not full or busy at all.  I have eaten here four times in the past and every time I come here the service gets worse every time.  We seated ourselves in the bar thinking the service might be better than in the past....not the case at all!  It took us 15 minutes to get our water and soda.  We were served an appetizer about 30 minutes after ordering.  We never received silverware and couldn't find any waitresses to flag down until the boys decided to eat it with their hands and without napkins.  When our food came out another 35 minutes later with no apologies whatsoever.  Three different servers had come to bring our food and every single server left our table without ever picking up the dirty dishes from the appetizer and old drinks.  Isn't that common sense???  The table was overflowing with dirty dishes while we were eating our meal.  We were trying to look for someone who remotely looked like they were management or even looked like they knew what they were doing...no one to be found.  Needless to say, even though I do enjoy BJ's food, we will never go back to this location.  Our first warning was listening to the booth behind us complaining to the waitress about the service and everything that we complained about.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, fool me four times and you've lost my business forever.  The service was so obnoxiously incompetent that it's no wonder why this location has been losing customers permanently."
izumi n.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,152,2,3.0,6/16/2013,only place open late in RSM.  we love the Bruschetta &  baked beignet
Gary S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",25,15,,1.0,9/3/2013,"We live in RSM, and since this BJ's opened we have experienced bad service, cold food and bad quality. Two weeks ago we gave it a third try. Ee even chose an off time when they wouldn't be busy.  The service was still bad, the food was still cold, and the excuse was that all of the staff was at the company picnic. We have eaten at multiple locations over the years and never experienced this. Corporate needs to look at management and staff now before they are forced to close in the near future."
