Cindy K.,"Irvine, CA",2,4,,1.0,6/9/2013,Service is terrible. Took us 45 minutes to get our pizza and the waitstaff never checked on us. The manager came by to apologize and said they messed up our order. He offered a free appetizer salad and said he'd take care of our bill (which was a nice gesture). But this is the fifth time I've been here since it opened and I thought maybe they're still working out the rough spots of a new restaurant but that excuse can't hold anymore. Every time the service was just horrible. I'm not coming back.
Sarah D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,19,,2.0,1/23/2012,"Came here with some friends to celebrate our birthdays. We were seated right away and were asked for our drink order. Our server was very nice and we got our drinks promptly but had to wait a while for our meal orders to be taken. While we waited for our food it was a bit difficult to talk because the music kept cutting in and out. It would be very quiet then blasting! I had the Grilled Chicken Pasta which was alright. There wasn't too much sauce on the pasta and the broccoli was a bit undercooked. Also, the chicken was tough and not as hot as I would have preferred. Something redeeming though was the Pizookies my friend and I got for our birthday. Those were very warm and fresh out of the oven.  However, if I wanted to go to BJ's, I'd definitely go to the one in Laguna Hills. It's a bit farther but the food and atmosphere is better."
Miss J.,"Laguna Beach, CA",167,124,48,4.0,1/16/2013,"OK, first and foremost- I have to say, the management at this place is really top notch! We didn't have the best experience but when we addressed our concerns with the manager, he took care of us completely and really listened to what went wrong.  We came in before a movie at Cinepolis with about an hour and 15 minutes before our movie began.  We had a little trouble getting our waiter over to our table to order, and when we did, they forgot our drinks.  Our soups and salads were yummy! I had a caesar and he had a broccoli cheddar soup.  When they picked up our appetizer plates we asked again for drinks, and they forgot again.  But they brought us our food and while my boyfriend wasn't too keen on his jalapeno burger (he just wanted more jalapenos), I LOVED my NY steak.  Honestly, one of the best steaks I've had in a while, good quality meat, perfectly seasoned, better than most steak houses.  The green beans were really bland, they didn't have butter or salt and pepper or anything- they were literally just steamed green beans- but that's fine with me.  I squeezed some lemon on them and was happy as a clam.  However, our server didn't return for about a half an hour, and when she did we asked again for some water and a coffee.  Twenty more minutes went by and she didn't return.  We had to leave so I went and grabbed a manager.  He apologized all over himself, got us a few waters to drink and took care of our meal.  Aside from the waitstaff being too busy and inattentive, I have to give my props to this restaurant.  They're trying, and their food is good. And their management actually cares about you.  Pretty cool if you ask me, and I'll come back and give em another shot next time I'm in the area."
S. A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/26/2013,"We know that the service is slow -- but at times it can be ""really, really"" slow and bad as well.  We went for dinner on a Sunday night, 4 adults and 3 children.  It didn't matter that we were ready to order, because it took the server some time to get to us.  After finally placing our order, we waited and waited and waited -- finally three plates were  brought to the table - a pizza, and two sandwiches -- shortly after, one of the kid's plates comes ( mini burgers).  At this point it's been close to forty minutes, and NOW the waitress tells us that they are out of ribs and no one had told her.  I guess it took her 40 minutes to find out they were out of ribs -- you'd think she would have known once she placed the order.  We had to place another kid's order.  At this point the other kid's meal comes to the table - spaghetti (which comes with garlic bread) but no garlic bread.  At this point, the person that order the club sandwich notices that the avocado is missing.  We called the server over and asked for the garlic bread and the avocado -- her reply, ""I'll get that for you.""  Took her a long time to get them.   What was interesting, was that no one came to apologize for the food taking soooooo long or for it not being right.  I take that back, the server apologized when she said they  were out of ribs.   You would think we were in an episode of one of those shows on the food network s about bad restaurants.  On of the people in our party tried, unsuccessfully, to get the attention of the ""manager"".  The ""manager"" was at the desk by the front door when we left and we stopped to tell him what had happened.  His reply was simply, ""Sorry about that."" Then he handed us the card with the telephone number for the regional office."
Justin W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,10,11,2.0,12/6/2013,"BJ's is not what it used to be... Quality has gone down hill!!! WTF?!?  Good luck finding cheese on your pizza! They also now freeze your pizza.. Yes, food is frozen then warmed up and served to you..  Forget this place, unless u want frozen pizza and good beer.. And good atmosphere.. Thats it!   BJ's needs to bring quality back to there pizza... What happened!!!!??"
Danielle B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",17,5,1,1.0,7/11/2012,Too bad I had to give a star. Terribly terribly slow. Unbelievable. And the manager is just walking around with a broom. Ugh. Just get me out of here
Bobby L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",4,20,,2.0,5/5/2013,"Wish I read the reviews before coming here. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the food here is still good. The service... TERRIBLE! We waited at the bar 5 mins before menus were even brought out. I ordered some appetizers, a beer, and 2 pizookies. The appetizers came out pretty quickly... But no beer? Bj's is a brewery... All you do is get a glass n go to the tap. After about 15 mins my beer came out and we were told our pizookies will come out shortly. After about 10 more minutes I went to ask for the manager however the hostess said she would take care of it. Fine, just get my pizookies out. The waitress then asked me 'what's the problem?' Keep in mind this is the first time she has checked up on us. I told her and her reasoning was 'well other tables have waited over 20 minutes as well'. Don't see how that's helping the cause because now I know I'm probably not the only one upset with the service here. Finally they came out and we asked for the check in anticipation of it taking a long time. Ends up the manager comp'd our pizookies because it took over 30 minutes for them to come out. I would assume the manager would at least stop by to explain/apologize for what happened, especially considering I asked for him/her earlier. Overall I would NOT go back unless I was extremely desperate for food and no where else in the area was open. I have had excellent experiences at other bj's but this one is clearly not the one to go to."
Cecilia W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,15,1,1.0,9/17/2014,"Where do I start? We went last Friday and it was crowded and under staffed. No outdoor service available. We finally got seated and our waitress was nice, but we could barely hear her, she talked so softly, but her responses were so robotic. We placed our order and almost all of them were wrong. To start with mine, my Caesar salad was dry and had 1 crouton and no Parmesan cheese, and the plate was dirty. Did I mention our utensils were dirty too? I kindly asked to get a clean plate, and perhaps a little more dressing. They brought it back and the second plate was also dirty. The third time they finally got it right.  My stuffed potato was dry, no sour cream or green onions, just smothered in cheese and soggy bacon. My friend ordered ribs with no sauce, she seriously told the waitress 5 times, no sauce. They brought the ribs back with sauce, ugh. My son didn't get his fries with his dinner and the macaroni and cheese was so dry he only took 2 bites (which is unheard of). I asked for the manager and instead of being proactive about what to do we had to suggest to him what he should do. It was so awkward. I will never eat there again."
Bill R.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/14/2012,"This is the worst BJs yet. I have tried it twice.  The service is marginal and the food mediocre. I know we have limited options in this area of RSM, but don't waste your money here."
Dane M.,"Lake Forest, CA",26,19,3,2.0,1/23/2012,"I love their pizza, so I'm not certain if my own negative review will stop me from eating there, (its the only decent food in ALL of RSM, lol) but this place has to get their stuff together. So far since opening, I have walked out twice with my guests, as both times we were seated by the hostess, and then sat for 15 minutes with no waiter coming by, (yes TWICE) with 30 waiters standing around? They have excellent pizza, but they're service (aside from the takeout workers) is attrocious. I have ordered the same pizza, (one they advertise quite regularly) probablly 30 times, and I have had it actually made correctly about 10/30. Not sure for a new restaraunt why they are not on top of their game? I even had an order come out to $9.25, at first I gave the girl $10.00, but then found a quarter. I told her, ""nice I have a quarter!"" she proceeded to tell me she could'nt give my dollar back and take the quarter because, ""she already keyed it in the register and didnt want her drawer uneven"" WOW! REALLY?"
P G.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/16/2012,"Big fan of BJ's in general but was not impressed at this location.  Service was ok, nowhere near as bad as some of the other reviews but the food was not nearly as good as other locations.  Was worried that it was a chain-wide change to their pizza recipe but it looks like its just this location."
Carmen M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",1,34,,2.0,9/15/2014,"Came here to celebrate my son's birthday.  Although we had a great time because we were all together, the food and service were very disappointing.  Our server was very nice and friendly and started off okay.  We got our drinks quick along with the calamari which was really good.  But then about 15 minutes or 20 minutes went by and nothing - no food and no service.  Finally, our entres started arriving.  Both my son's burger and my burger (the Classic) came with no sauce and his fries were cold and the hamburger buns on his burger were hard.  We did get the fries replaced.  My daughter ordered the sliders but when she got them they forgot the cheese. At least the server was quick about replacing her order.  Then the deep dish pizza came which was cold.  So disappointing.  At that point our server was no where to be found. My husband barely ate any of it.  As we were almost finished with our meal our server finally showed up and took our orders for dessert.  Once the desserts arrived, another server placed the 3 desserts on our table.  The problem was the table was so crowded with our appetizer dishes that were never removed in addition to our dinner dishes.  There was very little room.  This other server didn't even make an attempt to remove any dishes, instead she set the desserts down whereever she found a spot on the table and didn't ettempt to remove any of the other dishes even though it was obvious we were done.  She started walking away and I had to ask her to remove some of the dishes.  There were no bus boys in sight or our server coming to remove any dishes.   The family that was sitting at the table next to us had left an hour ago while we were sitting next there and their table was never cleared.  It was a bit gross.  Don't think we'll be back.  Too bad because it's very nice inside."
J A.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,5,,3.0,1/6/2012,"I LOVE BJ's pizzeria.  I have been excited to see this one built in my neighborhood.  I could not wait for it to open.  BUT I have been there three times and have had bad experiences each time. FIRST TIME Waiter wasn't sure of the menu, pizza and food was delivered fine, although it took a long time. SECOND TIME Waiter seemed new.  Appetizer was brought out about 5 minutes after the pizza, with no apology, no explanation, just ""oh, they get busy and get confused"".  This was a Friday night and I know they are new, but they need to get their act together. THIRD TIME This was the worst.  I asked what kind of non BJs beers they had, the waitress had no idea.  When she returned, she said the bartender was busy so couldn't tell her right now.  Finally I went to the bar and asked myself (I wanted to see what the Lost Abbey beer was, which the bartended said was an IPA, but Lost Abbey doesn't even make IPAs).  I ordered a BJs beer instead (Grand Cru, which BTW, is very good).  It took over a half hour to get my beer.  We ordered pizza (medium BJs fave, mini cheeseburger pizza and a kids cheese only) and two salads (side salad w/dressing on the side and a dinner salad with chicken).  It took almost an hour and a half to get our food.  The two salads came out (the one that was supposed to have the dressing on the side was smothered with it, the chicken one had no dressing at all).  We told the waitress but she made no attempt to fix the problem.  Finally the medium pizza came out (seriously, after an hour and a half) room temperature.  The waitress said the other two pizzas had been under the warmer and needed reamade (at least another 30 minutes) but we asked for those to just be reheated (we have small kids who were DONE in the restaurant).  The medium pizza was room temp, the cheeseburger pizza didn't have the pickles on it and the kids pizza had NO SAUCE.  We were extremely disappointed. I think they are still training their staff right now, as well as their kitchen, but they are completley overwhelmed.  I haven't talked to ANYONE who has gotten their correct orders, and the management isn't trying to help out at all.  We won't go back for a while, hopefully not until they have the kinks worked out!"
Erica G.,"Dana Point, CA",36,64,31,4.0,11/4/2011,"I went here today around 1:30 on a Friday and the place was busy! We were seated right away and had a wonderful, hilarious, very friendly waiter named, Michael. He joked around with us which we enjoyed his humor. We ordered our food and we asked to swap out the tomato bisque for chicken tortilla which wasn't a problem. However, we got the chicken tortilla soup first and then the tomato bisque came out with the other food.. So there was extra food that we didn't order... That's okay though. Many times during our meal other waiters came up to us and tried to deliver other food that wasn't ours. Apparently the staff doesn't know the table numbers yet.. That's fine too. No big deal. There were a few tables around us that waited a long time for their food, but not us. We had great service and left Michael a nice tip for being so kind and attentive to my Mom and I. I will return back to BJS because of the good food and nice waiter, Michael."
Steve L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/13/2013,Service has become awful. You can get better service for a lot less money somewhere else.
Jennifer B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",57,30,1,1.0,11/4/2011,"Went there opening week on Saturday. Only good experience I had was that you could call in for reserved seating but still had a little wait. The rest of the night went down hill from there. There wee four of us plus a one year old that we didn't order for. We ordered appetizers and a main dish which was pizza we waited like an hour before our appetizers came out then an additional hour for our pizza to come out. I usually love bjs, but this definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth. Service was horrible we waited sooooooo long for our food and when it came out was cold and completely wrong. We ordered the great white and it had no Alfredo sauce on it and another pizza we ordered with no tomatoes but they were all over it. We complained and they didn't do much except say sorry so we had to ask for them to comp our dessert. Dont know if I will go back. Didn't seem like they were ready to open."
Josh M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/25/2013,"""I love coming to BJ's. I come here often with my friends. Service is great and the food is great. I would recommend this place to anybody."""
Kathy J.,"Newport Beach, CA",45,60,,3.0,4/15/2012,"I was shocked when I went to Yelp today to get address of this Bjs to see the low star score but was quick to find out why.  We were greeted nicely and sat quickly-party of 20 at 11:30 am  The menus were dirty-not just mine but several-not just one page but several even crumbs included.   We had two servers who were very friendly but inexperience in large party service.  Clearing plates, slow food, missing meals etc.  I always wonder why they take the food in order but have no clue where it goes when it comes out.   Food was cold-this Bjs needs some help!!!  No manager present-restrooms clean!!!  Everything was just ok-but just ok does not put them up where they belong."
Mark S.,"Irvine, CA",149,12,1,2.0,10/19/2011,"We came to BJs with high expectations from previously good experiences.  Unfortunately this new store did not live up to previous standards.  We got there before the dinner rush and wanted to sit at the bar for happy hour.  Unfortunately they would not let us sit there with a stroller...  (usually this is much easier for us to navigate with the baby).  We were told no babies allowed... somehow I doubt this is a company policy.  Not a big deal.  So we sat at a table.  Once we were there everything was fine.  Until we got our cold pizza!  Despite having what appeared to be double staffed they were unable to deliver us hot pizza.  We then talked to the manager who said he would take care of it and sent us another pizza.  This one came out luke warm, not great but hey better than cold right.  Our waitress came back and said they would take care of the pizza for us.  Turns out they meant the second pizza they delivered... why on earth would someone order a second pizza expecting to pay for it when they had to send the first one back.  Overall we had poor service and a poor management experience.  Maybe they are just getting there feet wet but definitely not a place I would recommend."
Michele B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/22/2014,"Never been to this Bj's before. I have a friend that moved to Trabuco Canyon. She suggested we meet at Bjs to catch up. It's a beautiful location. Looks fairly new.  We were greeted right away by the hostess. She asked if we were members of their loyalty program. I am not but my girlfriend to my surprise said ""yes I am"". The hostess pointed to a keypad that was sitting on the desk and asked my friend to input her phone number. She did then the hostess looked up from her screen and welcomed my friend by name. I thought that was pretty cool. She sat us quickly at a nice booth for two. Our server greeted us about a minute later. I believe his name was George. He was very friendly and seemed to know his stuff. I asked about Bjs beer (I had never had a Bjs beer before). He went on about an IBU scale, light vs. Dark and hefeweizen being un filtered. It was a little over my head but definitely helped me decide what kind of beer would be right for me. I ordered a top sirloin MR. It was cooked perfectly. The cheddar mash potatoes we to die for. My friend ordered Parmesan Chicken. She let me try it. The lemon butter sauce was so good I could probably put it on anything and everything I ever eat. George was attentive and friendly throughout the experience. I noticed a young women dressed differently walking around consistently being approached by the employees. I assumed she was the manager. She seemed on top of it. I know restaurant Management can be a trying job because my Mom was one for many years. I commented to my friend that it seems managing a restaurant has not gotten any easier through the years. She told me she had spoken to that particular manager before. She said the managers at this location have recently been changed and she felt it was for the better. Upon receiving our bill George asked us if we would like to redeem any of our points tonight. I was not sure what he meant but my friend sure did. She said "" yes please"". Can I please get $25 off. He said sure. Walked away, went to the manager lady said something she walked to computer did something handed George our bill. Low and behold $25 had been taken off. I was impressed with the restaurant and my friend. Totally cool. I guarantee I will be back. Great place with great value. Thanks Bj's in RSM!!!"
