Gladbag T.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",49,9,1,2.0,2/3/2012,"Greetings were nice. Too long of a wait for a table, but that's expected, it was a Friday night. Drinks too long to get to our table. Food was not warm by the time it got to our table. Expectations were high for us, since we have been to the Laguna Hills location where service and food were great. Spending $100 for a family of 5 was not worth the wait and hype. Will not come to this location again unless some things change."
Joseph T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/8/2012,Ive given this place 4 try's everytime i go they mess up on my  food. The poor bartenders and servers are always embarrased and more than happy to get a manager and yes they do end up comping the mistakes but im not there for a free meal. I have no problem paying for my food. I'm giving up on this BJ's I will be going to selmas
Paul M.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,14,,1.0,2/17/2014,"Oh how our family was excited that BJs was coming to RSM a few years ago. The food is always wonderful and we were thrilled to have them in the neighborhood. However, now I won't be back. After giving them yet ""another chance,"" I've given up. The service is consistently slow and disorganized. It looks like they fill the place with high school interns and the adults have left the building. Everyone seems to be running around not knowing exactly what they have to do. I have tried take out several times and they ALWAYS get my order wrong (that is when they actually have people at the take out desk). When I commented to the ""trainee"" tonight that I wouldn't be back, two women standing with me echoed the same. Who is the manager of this place? He or she needs to be fired and the corporates need to come back and teach the staff what actual service means. I love your food BJs, but I am taking my business down the street to Wood Ranch where their take out is organized and rarely fails. Why can't you get the service straight BJs?"
Paula P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,69,,1.0,11/18/2012,"Ugh. We live in RSM and were truly excited when TGI Friday's closed and BJ's was going to open in it's place. We've been there a couple of times and last Friday night is going to be the last time I'm sorry to say. We got there shortly after 8:00pm and the place was packed. After a short wait we were seated. The waitress announced that this was her first night ""working without help"" and to ""be nice."" We ordered drinks and an appetizer. When we were first seated, I noticed a large corner booth across from us was vacant and the table was FILLED with dirty dishes, dirty glasses, leftover food, etc. We waited for our drinks ... and waited and waited. It took an inordinate amount of time for them to arrive. My son mentioned that he only saw one bartender behind the bar. Our appetizer actually came out before we got our drinks. They finally came ... one margarita, a taster of four mini beers and a rootbeer. The margarita was awful ... way too sweet and not at all like it had been the last time we'd been there. The taster of beers didn't seem to be the flavors my husband had ordered. They were supposed to be four different kinds yet two of them were identical. Dinner continued the downward trend ... my son's hamburger was devoid of any flavor and he was so grossed out by it that he couldn't stomach finishing it. My husband and I thought our tacos were just okay. I never once saw a manager walking around and they seemed to have really scaled back on the amount of staff on hand because it sure wasn't like it had been when the place first opened. The table with the dirty dishes stood there the ENTIRE time -- from the time we were seated to the time we left. Occasionally a waiter would go over there and pick up one glass or stand there and stare at the table and walk away. Apparently they have no staff who has the responsibility of clearing off and cleaning dirty tables. Toward the end as we were getting ready to leave, I noticed a lot of tables just sitting there with dirty dishes piled up. It was disgusting. I guess the wait staff was supposed to clean tables as they had time and apparently no one had time or was paying attention. Had I seen a manager, I definitely would of complained as that is just plain unacceptable! Bottom line is that we will never go there again -- it is really unfortunate that the place has gone downhill so badly in such a short amount of time. If there is a manager somewhere, they should be fired."
Grace C.,"Coppell, TX",0,259,16,2.0,1/25/2013,came here for weekday lunch. service was sooooo slow. who wants that kind of service when you are there during lunch hour? the waitress never was around after we got our food. she never refilled my lemonade and took FOREVER to get our check. VERY VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. won't go here again for lunch hour.
Kate B.,"TRABUCO CYN, CA",0,11,,4.0,2/12/2012,"We ate here in a busy Friday night with our two boys. One of our kids is well behaved and one is a little monster. Our server was very helpful. She could tell it was best for us to get our order in quickly. She took our drink order and the kid's meal orders while we looked at the menu. Our food came quickly. My skinny 5 year old who eats nothing, will turn down cake and ice cream, ate his entire meal of garlic bread and mini corn dogs. The 2 year old terror loved his pizza. I had a drink that was good but knocked me on my butt from being strong ( I rarely drink). I had jumbalaya- pretty good- and huge portion, could have split. My hubby had ribeye. He said his steak was meh, but he loved his horseradish mashed potatoes.  The two year old them began to loose it and the staff helped us get our bill, to go boxes and get out of there.  My favorite restaurant is mastro's, so I am used to good service....I saw very good service l around us. Obviously, the steaks are not comparable, but for the price and ability to bring the kids, this a place was great. Good, fast, friendly service with pretty good food. I don't know why the reviews are so bad...."
Robert K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",9,6,,1.0,11/30/2013,Horrible service and the food sucks but the manager was nice on comping my meal. So I took my family of four there today for lunch it wasn't that busy but yet it still took over ten minutes to receive our drinks. We both order the house salad with ranch and it tasted like fish  I could see the chunks of sardines in the ranch. GROSS! We both ordered the bacon burger one with cheese and one without bacon extra crispy and well done. Well the got that all wrong the patties were way under cooked and they both came with cheese and the bacon was limp and greasy. The bottom bun was filled with grease and the top hard as a rock the order of fry's tasted like fish. When we talked to the manager it was explained to us that everything is cooked in the same oil. So we sent our food back and went to Taco Bell up the the street. I highly recommend to avoid this establishment and go to the one in Irvine that one is way better!
bimali b.,"Laguna Hills, CA",5,99,1,3.0,2/25/2013,"I usually love BJ's and I go to the location in Laguna Hills quite a bit, but this location was not so good. I just went there for the first time last weekend and service was horrible. The waiter, whose name I wont mention because I feel bad, was terrible. We sat at the table for awhile before we got silverwear and some of our food was already delivered (I started eating with my fingers.) The waiter seemed a bit out of it. I asked for a water which was never brought until I asked another waiter for it. They messed up my Mac and Cheese, but replaced it. The manager came over and apologized for this and they comped it, which I appreciated. And the waiter brought us the bill without asking if we wanted dessert and when I said ""can we please order dessert?"" his response was, ""oh, I didnt know you all wanted any?"" Well, then ask? He just seemed out of it and didnt pay much attention to what he was doing. The food was good, but service sucked."
Sporty G.,"Coto De Caza, CA",1,6,,1.0,12/16/2011,"very disappointed at this new BJs. the 2x i went, i sat at the bar with my friend for happy hour. first, there are not side menus telling you what the happy hour specials are. then when you can get a bartender's attention and ask them what the specials are, they act like its a huge deal for them to tell you. then they tell you extremely fast and leave. i gave them slack the 1st time since it just opened.  well, i went there the other day, hoping for better results. we sat at the bar for about 8 mins without a bartender saying anything to us, when they were right in front of us the hole time, acting as if they were so busy making drinks. it wasnt even that busy. finally, we asked a female bartender for some menu, while she was making drinks, and it seemed like it was a chore for her to do so. then a guy came around and told us his name and the other girl's name as well and said we will be happy to help you guys out; only they werent. when we asked what the happy hr specials were, again, they went over it extremely fast, like they are sick and tired of telling people what it is...then make a dang sign for everyone so we know what it is or out it on your dang menu!!!! when we ordered our drinks, the guy bartender asked for our IDs. not only did he take forever to look at them, as if we werent 21-we r well over 21-he made fun of my friend's DL picture. finally, he gave us our DL back. we dont know if he was trying to be funny or was just a jerk...later we figured out he was just a jerk... when we wanted a another drink, again, it was hard for us to even get the attention of either bartender. we didnt even bother with the female one b/c she just seemed like she hated her job, good god, would she die if she smiled?!?!?! finally, we got the attention of the guy bartender to get another drink. now im no expert in bartending, but i do know that if you see the customers  drink running low, you ask them for another before they ask you...well not here..these 2 bartenders seemed like they were not liking their job. all in all, i will not go back and sit at the bar. i will find another place for happy hour...the BEST happy hour is YARD HOUSE!!!! wish they had 1 in RSM. good news is, though, when we were getting ready to leave, a 3rd bartender came (a bald guy), and he was smiling, happy, and interacting very well with the customers at the bar...the other 2, well, they need to get out of there if they want returning customers!"
Karen H.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2011,"We should have read the reviews before going, but thought we would try out a new restaurant with the kids.  It was a Monday and fairly crowded.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table.  The manager came over to us a couple of times and apologized for the wait and promised a free appetizer when we were sat.  It turns out he was talking to the wrong party and there was no free appetizer for us.  The service was horrible.  Coming from someone who worked in restaurants for years and is very forgiving, this is probably an understatement.  Several people have mentioned the large number of staff and we noticed the same thing.  There are plenty of people working at BJ's.  Sadly, they are very poorly trained.  Our service was slow, drinks were not refilled, plates were not cleared and our food came out 1-2 orders at a time over about 10 minutes.  Finally, my husband and I canceled our soup orders which had still not arrived.  All the while, the manager was running around looking confused and flustered.  The food was OK, but the service killed any positive aspect of our experience.  We were looking forward to a new restaurant in our area, but we will NOT be returning to BJ's anytime soon."
C D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,14,,4.0,10/29/2012,"Been there a few times. First when it had just opened and a few weeks ago. Good food, it's pricey but it's an upscale place, what do you expect? Most of the negatives just seem like people that would give 2 stars to their own mother. Really people, I know it's south OC but get over yourself. The kitchen is slow, but it's a big place and is often busy. Plus, I'm glad my food is taking awhile, usually means it's not just being heated up, but actually cooked. Service is most of the time good. Had 1 bad server, but we talked with the manager that night, and he was real cool. Other than that, the servers are good. Always telling you ""my pleasure"" which tells me management does their job and keeps them trained. The place is good, if you don't like the price, probably shouldn't eat out as it is, but most of the complaints really seem like people wanting to be pampered. We like it, and go every so often."
OC C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",27,19,1,1.0,2/19/2012,"While the food at Bj's is consistently good from location to location, regretfully, the service is not.  I had already lowered my standards for bad service due to experiences at other BJ's locations but the RSM restaurant sets a new low.  To say their service is slow and the wait staff is apathetic  would be a compliment.  I took my family of four there on a Sunday night.  After a 30 minute wait to be seated, it was another 5-10 before our presence was even acknowledged.   I let that slide and after ordering, things seemed to get better.  An expeditor brought out the food but after that, our family might as well have been on deserted island.  Don't go there thirsty because once you finish your first round of water, you'd be better off taking your empty glass to the bathroom to refill it.  After waiting another 20 minutes, I finally was able to flag down our server, who looked utterly surprised that I would interrupt him.  I think he forgot he was our waiter.  So I asked him to bring my son a kid's size Pizookie, which was the reason the kids picked BJ's int he first place.  15 minutes passed by and....nothing.  How long does it take to scoop ice cream and put it on a cookie?  Finally I figured we'd have to invest another 20 minutes to get the check if we waited around. So much to the dismay of my son, I flagged down the waiter again (same shocked look as before on his face) and asked for the bill.  I'm ashamed to admit that after waiting for a total of 40 minutes to even be acknowledged, i considered walking out on the bill.  Had my kids not been with me, i probably would have.  I ended up explaining the situation to the manager and he comped my kid's meals.  But the Pizookie never came out.  My son was devastated.  NEVER AGAIN.  STAY AWAY from this location!"
Ashley M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,14,,3.0,1/13/2012,"I have been to this new location twice. The first time I had pretty good service. However the second time I went, not so much. We got seated and it took a while for the server to come over. Being a server as well I understand things but I left thinking what the hell?! She asked for our drink order. Water with lemon please. I saw her write it down. Side salads came out...um where is my water?? I'm practically done with my salad and FINALLY the water comes WITHOUT LEMON THAT I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR. When my boyfriend ordered his pizza he asked for a side of ranch thinking that it would save her an extra trip. Of course it never came. Back to the lemons, we asked for some and asked again, and asked again. Really?!! Finally I thought it was rude that in the middle of eating my pizza she asks if I want dessert. If you really are a server you wait until your customer is done otherwise you come off as rude and trying to get rid of them. Completely unprofessional."
J I.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/4/2012,"I love BJ's! But this location, well definitely will NOT BEING GOING BACK. Normally my family goes to the one in Laguna. The food is always very good and I normally have no complaints but this one is ridiculous! We went on a Wednesday night when it wouldn't be that busy for my husbands birthday. We had a party of 4 and my 7 month old daughter, so we needed a high chair. When I informed the hostess of that, she seemed to treat me as if that was VERY INCONVENIENT. She kept asking if I could maybe put my INFANT IN A BOOSTER SEAT?! Is that a freaking joke?! Then she informed me that there were only certain table that were compatible with high chairs and wanted to know if we were willing to sit outside... with my 7 month old baby at 7pm. How about no. After being seated we give our drink orders and wait for about a good 15 mins to get them And just like many others have said it wasn't our server who brought them by. Finally we figured out that we needed to order and fast, so again we received our entrees from someone else but we also received the entrees and appetizers OUT OF ORDER! I can't believe the HORRIBLE SERVICE. I THINK THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THEIR HIRING PROCESS."
