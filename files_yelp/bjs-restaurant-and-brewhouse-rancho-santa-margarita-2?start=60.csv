Jeff B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",655,260,989,4.0,9/24/2015,"The California Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken Pita Tacos....""WOW""!!!!! With this update & and a few new visits....I see they may have picked up their game a little now.  ""The POWER OF THE YELP GODS""...seems to have finally got them to realize a few things!"
Ana C.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2017,"Just Terrible, run away from this place! I was there last Sunday 07/16/2017, at 7:00 PM ... As I was attending the Smith concert at the park, I thought I could just go there and grab something delicious to take out... I order fish tacos. however, it occurred to me that I would much prefer if it was wrapped in flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.Simple request... The ""gentleman"" at the register replied "" NO"" it can't be done, Every customer gets the same"" Short and rude!( this was witnessed by a friendly and professional female attendant) I was shocked! Even more, because the rude man turns out to be Kenny Fahrer, the manager!!!!  I use to like the Bj's in Anaheim Hils, however, this one in Rancho Santa Margarita left a disastrous impression on me.Certainly not a place I recommend to anyone, certainly not a place I would be back to. My take out fish tacos were dark, (clearly made with old oil) more burned dough than fish, they didn't have the finesse to put napkins or silverware in the take out bag...Needless to say, it went all straight to the trash can at the park.  I wonder how this place remains in business bringing down BJ's name and the good work from other franchises."
Andrew G.,"Sparks, NV",183,93,938,2.0,9/23/2015,Well I have to follow in the same line as my fellow yelpers. Not the best experience at a BJs. They usually rank pretty high but this location is not up to par. Let's start with the positive experience. My 5 year old nephew accidentally spilled his water all over the table and a busser who was cleaning up a table close by came right over and helped clean it up. Nothing out of the ordinary with this gesture but extremely friendly. After he finished drying off our table he came over to my nephew and said all dry! Gave him a high five and said nothing to worry about buddy! This made my nephew night and he was taken from upset to happy. Really nice touch by the busser and the best service provided. The food took a long time to get after we ordered. Wasn't overly busy so not sure why it took so long. We ordered avocado rolls for an appetizer and had it half way eaten before our drinks arrived. My brother n law wished he had a straw to make the empty cup noise because we were left empty majority of the dinner. Our waiter was friendly and nice. He did his best to be attentive to our table but the overall experience really was 1.5 stars. I did give them a half of star for the awesome busser. Like my fellow yelpers have mentioned it's really a disappointment to have such a brand named restaurant that doesn't upkeep the name. It's in a nice area where service is key.    You have be warned! Enter at your own risk.
Wally P.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",155,137,948,1.0,9/3/2014,"Wow! This was the worst service ever. Even our waiter and the manager were embarrassed and apologetic at how pathetic they were today. Though they gave us a discount, I am still compelled to give an honest description of their failures today. 1) my family party of 5 arrived at 1 pm today and the house was only 1/4 full. Despite the many empty tables, we waited 15 minutes for a table. Two other parties of 3 were seated before us. How mad would you be? 2) once seated we waited another 10 minutes to see our waiter and place an order. He was clearly overwhelmed and apologetic for the delay. We were cooperative and sympathetic. 3) waited another 20 minutes before one salad was served. We asked where our drinks and the rest of order was. She said she'd check. 4) another 10 minutes and nothing. We flag our waiter who is appalled we have no drinks or other food yet. 5) another 10 minutes and the rest of our food arrives. But still no drinks. Again we inquire about the drinks. They finally arrive AFTER we finish our meal. I ask for a pizza server and some silverware but it never comes.  6) the waiter flags manager at his own suggestion. He explains how overwhelmed he is, and though we are annoyed, we understand. 7) manager comps us drinks and pizzookie, and explains why our table was not supposed to be assigned to him, yada, yada. Yeah it all makes sense, but honestly all I wanted was an efficient meal with my family. That should not be hard to fulfill on a particularly slow day. 8) it's now 2:30 and hour and a half after we checked in. We had a pizza, salad, and pizzookie. The discounted bill was the least they could do.  But then I noticed a ""fruit plate"" charged to my bill that I did not order. I decided not to dispute it since it was already discounted, and I don't need anymore attitude from the manager.  But honestly, they need to get their act together. 9) I feel we were patient with their poor performance and apology, but I won't be coming back any time soon.  10) hopefully corporate will notice that this location needs a management overhaul."
Debbie N.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/28/2017,Had the Parmesan crusted chicken. So good. Nice clean and friendly place. And there is no corkage fee on your first bottle of wine.
Kay H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",20,6,1,5.0,3/12/2017,Went to  a graduation celebration there and could not have had better service or food. So attentive to such a large group.  Just fantastic.
Irm C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/21/2017,Absolutely unacceptable.  . I requested a delivery service an hr an a half ago. The restaurant disregarded my request and asked me to call an outside delivery service... yes foolish me I call them & they asked me to call Bjs... REALLY????
Annie M.,"Irvine, CA",37,6,1,2.0,1/28/2017,"Honestly not worth the money, I went for a full fledged meal, ordered appetizers and drinks and entrees, the works.  I left feeling stuffed, but not satisfied.  If I'm going to spend 70 bucks on a meal I kind of expect it to  feel like I spent money on something amazing but the food felt like anyone could have made at home, actually pretty sure I could have produced something in my own kitchen that was better.  I've had this experience a  couple times before here, but I didn't decide to write a review until now because it's just been one too many times full with disappointment.  At least the servers are kind."
Tammy F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,18,3,1.0,2/15/2017,The person who answers the phone and takes orders needs to not act like she is  at a cheerleading competition by screaming in the phone.  I had to repeat my order three times and then when she repeated it back to me she still had it wrong. She cuts you off midsentence why you're trying to reiterate the order to her. Customer service was not key during this conversation. Can't wait to see how wrong this order is when we pick it up. BJs unfortunately in the last few years has gone completely downhill. This is probably why I haven't ordered from here in at least 6 to 8 months. Update! Yes it was WRONG! SMH!!
Jennifer A.,"Lexington, KY",17,6,23,4.0,1/13/2017,Came here last night with my daughters for dessert only. We hade Pizookies! They were heavenly. The S'mores pizookie was so good! My favorite was the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut pizookie. The atmosphere was relaxing. A lot of interesting decorations throughout
Kimberly W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",180,53,22,1.0,1/10/2017,"Okay, this is the second time in the last two months that we have come here and the service and food quality wasn't up to par. Everything was rushed. From our conversation with our service to our food being brought out to us. I felt like we were in competition of our seats.  We order the sample platter first and told the service we're on a date night, excited to go on vacation this weekend. She didn't seems really interest in us, but to tell us she just got back from her vacation and that she finished school and graduation. She continue to tell us she usually works at the bar, but likes to waitress sometimes as well. She didn't write down out order, which I thought was impressive, but then came back because she forgot twice what we order. Humm write it down then. She just was all over the place. Once we ordered the sample platter it would of been a little nice to know that it was enough for four people instead of two. Waste of food and I should of taken a picture of it- but I forgot. We wouldn't have gotten it. The only thing cooked on the platter was the avocado eggrolls and mozzarella sticks. The Spanish dip was awful and the buffalo wings weren't even dipped all the way. Then we order a mini pizza/salad to share and wine/beer and she forgot my wine the second time around. The mini pizza wasn't cooked and the cheese wasn't melted at all.  The bottom wasn't crispy like the deep dish we usually get.  Also it didn't come in the deep dish pan like as we order. Maybe this has changed now they served on a plate. IDK She did say sorry and did send it back. The second pizza came out and it was just as bad. It looked like they just reheated it. The reason why you only see two slices in the picture is because we're splitting it and as you can see it's gross. I couldn't eat it. The manager did come by and take the mini pizza off our bill but it's not worth us going back again for any reason. This isn't the first time this has happened, but it's my first time noting it here. I have no idea what's going on with this place, it used to be pretty good.  I rather spend a little extra and get better service and food quality."
Michele K.,"Irvine, CA",534,307,475,2.0,10/25/2016,"Tried to be adventurous today and somewhat ""health"" conscious and got the lemon thyme chicken off of their enlightened menu. Huge Huge Huge mistake. The only person I really have to blame is myself though. I think one would expect an ""enlightened"" menu to be somewhat healthy... but then again... you shouldn't have high expectations at a place like BJs. Yes, yes, the lemon thyme chicken is only 510 calories... but then when you look at the rest of the nutritional facts... It's 1990mg of sodium... which is 83% of the daily recommended intake... 100mg of cholesterol... 33% of the daily recommended intake....18g of fat... 100% of the daily recommended intake. For the amount of calories taken in... that's a lot of sodium. It's not just about the calories, yall. The other nutritional facts are important too! I'm not sure what this dish is supposed to be like, but there was a lot of lemon thyme sauce. It was almost like a stew, everything was drenched in it. The brown rice was really mushy and almost had no texture to it (which is surprising since brown rice has more texture than white rice). Everything else kind of got lost in the swamp of lemon thyme sauce.. which I think was the sodium culprit. The sauce was so salty and I was tilting my plate to one side in attempts to keep the rest of the food dry. Next time I return to BJs for a work lunch, I'll be sticking with the safe options.. like a caesar salad... or something..."
Candace L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2883,1503,3011,3.0,5/4/2015,"Dipped into this BJ's with my boyfriend, his Mom and brother for little lunch over the weekend. Service was great! Food was on par with other BJ's location we've been to. Since I'm a creature of habit and stick firmly to ""if it ain't broke"" I of course ordered their pizza. This time just a mini which was plenty. I'm pretty sure the mini is the same as the kids size. Cheese and Tomato, hit it with some chili flakes and dipped it into our leftover lemon garlic aioli from the fried artichoke app AND made it a lunch special with a small starter tomato and mozzarella salad which was surprisingly tasty for BJ's - reminded me of the ease of this dish and wondered why I'm not making it at home. My boyfriends salmon plate was a little overcooked, but who orders salmon from BJ's??? He's silly and on a little health kick.  A pazookie is a must right!?!! Stick to the original, chocolate chip - it's the sort of treat you wish fed as endlessly as their BBQ chicken salad does. Parking out front in their private lot."
Louisa L.,"Lake Forest, CA",13,5,,2.0,7/29/2017,"We have been BJ's fans for years but in the past year we have used door dash to have our orders delivered to our home. My husband and I are both disabled and it is a huge noon to have a delivery option. Except the last several times we ordered the delivery has been late, the food cold, and the order incomplete. Neither BJ's or Door Dash will take responsibility and neither will either fix the order. We are done with Door Dash and BJ's."
Justin K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,24,9,2.0,4/29/2016,"There is a reason why I prefer going to the Laguna Hills BJ's over this one... I've given this place a few chances already but it is always subpar compared to the other location. Pros: Seating was quick. Pizza was good. Cons: The side salad was small. half the size of the one at the Laguna Hills location. Not only was it small, it didn't taste fresh. It was ice cold.. like it came out of the freezer. It did not have the fresh crunch that you would expect from some fresh greens. Disappointing. The ribs looked nice but was tougher in texture. I expect that if I am going to pay over $20 for ribs, it should be nice and tender, peeling off the bone texture. Unfortunately, this one was not. If I want to go to BJ's, it will definitely be at the other location from here on out. This location is convenient because it is closer, but trust me, it is worth the drive to go to the other one!"
Kelly H.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",19,1,,1.0,10/20/2017,"We came on a Saturday morning for brunch. Our waitress was Alani. We were pleased with her service..... until it came to closing out our check. Apparently she rang up another table on our card in addition to charging us for our tab. Instead of voiding the transaction she told us we would get a refund in 2-3 days. On Wednesday the money still hadn't appeared in our account. My husband called the restaurant that evening and was told there was no manager on duty with the ability to check transactions and they took his contact info. On Thursday a male manager, I'm sorry I don't know his name, called my husband.  He explained the situation and the manager told him that he was off at 5 and since it was already 4:30 he would look into it the following day. Are you kidding? What kind of customer service training are you offering your employees? Apparently very little. We did finally get the money back but the extent we had to go to was ridiculous and we will never return."
Charles F.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,14,,5.0,2/2/2017,"Had a mishap with my phone falling inside an odd spot in restaurant. Because of the fall it had taken it was unfortunately shattered. I reached out to them to inform them of this incident. They went above and beyond to make sure my phone got taken care of, also covered the costs to do so. Could not be more pleased with their customer service. Al the general manager was very kind about the whole situation and in making it right. Defiantly coming back here :)."
Nathan W.,"Lake Forest, CA",46,13,6,1.0,9/1/2016,"If I could give a rating lower than 1 star I would. Service and leadership is just horrible here. Our group ordered, everyone received their food. I was skipped. They left, not asking if everyone was good. Staff likes to hang out at their cubbies and the bar more than wait on guests. When they finally did come back around I asked where my personal size pizza was. My friend also had a overly undercooked guacamole burger. They took his burger back. They were absent for another 5 mins. I asked a second time about my pizza. There was no apology or indication that this was already on their radar. In fact they ask, oh you're waiting on your pizza? They came back and brought my friends burger back. It was literally thrown back on the plate and there was no longer any guacamole. I asked again about my pizza and asked if I could get a side of skinny fries (since I was really hungry at this point). They came back 5 mins later with the skinny fries. Still no pizza. By now our entire table is done eating. I asked them for the manager at this point. 10 mins later everyone has been done eating for a while now I ask for my pizza one last time. They came back in 2 mins now with the pizza. We were all done eating still waiting for the manager. Manager happened to walk by just to ask how things were going to all the tables and this was the first her heard that we requested him.  I told him about our experience. He told me they made my pizza wrong and so thats why it took so long. He was explaining it to me rather than understanding it. They did take the pizza off the bill after all this.  I like BJ's but not this one. The 1.5 star rating should of already been an indicator but let me just confirm the status for you, this location's service is last to none."
Tom R.,"Robinson Ranch, CA",3,64,,1.0,7/9/2017,"Sorry but you guys were totally off your game today.  We came in with the special offer:  Buy One Entree , Get One Free with the Purchase of two drinks.  Not that it should make a difference with the service, even though one of the entrees was free, the trip to BJs was simply not worth the trip.  To start with, the wait for service was unacceptable -- eventually we had to ask for service.  When we did make our order, we both added salads.  Our server came by and asked if our food was tasty and we informed her that the salads never came.  She was nice but was clueless when it came to our order.  We cancelled the salads.  The thought of the entrees going back under a warming light was not desired.  I ordered fish and chips.  The chips were truly from the bottom of the barrel as they were obviously the leftovers.  But the worst was that the fish was greasy.  I sent the meal back to the kitchen.  They did re-do the meal but by then I had lost my appetite for fish and chips.  I thanked our server but did not eat the dinner. To be fair, we have dined in BJs on many occasions and the food has always (until today) been tasty.  You guys had a bad day with us today.  BTW, the meal that my lady ordered was fine with no problems but since we were on a date, I have to award BJs only one star today.  For us, todays experience was a total waste of time and money."
Kelly R.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",35,16,14,5.0,11/13/2016,"We have been coming to this BJs since it opened. The chain is one of my families favorites. Our server tonight, Morgan, was absolutely phenomenal-probably the best service we have ever had here. She always had a smile on her face and was welcoming and went the extra mile to ensure our meal was perfect.  We normally love coming here and it remains a top food choice for all of our family members-but Morgan went over and above all expectations."
