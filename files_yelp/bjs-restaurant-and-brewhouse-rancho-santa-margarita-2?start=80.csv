Rachelle C.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,20,28,5.0,12/9/2016,Happy Hour the best! Put away your phones and check in on Yelp when you're done... You'll be a lot HAPPIER then! Stephen is an awesome server in the bar area. Order the Avocado Rolls. Tell them golden brown crispy.... They have some other Vegetarian things on the menu too.
John R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",102,43,118,4.0,6/30/2016,Excellent food! The service can sometimes be slow even if it's not busy. My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken pizza. Lots of televisions and nice bar area. Good place to watch the game or hang out with friends.
Jess D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",275,4,,5.0,1/10/2017,I've been to this location plenty of times and the only reason I come back is for one server named Brendan and the food. I have had a couple other servers and they just arnt that great. Super slow or seem to careless about their job. If you come to this location ask to be sat in Brendan's section and you won't be sorry.
Angie M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",160,1230,4820,3.0,2/17/2014,"Let me start by saying my review would have been a 1, had it not been for the manager, Art. I met my parents here for dinner Saturday night... called ahead and had our name added to the wait list for 6pm.  We arrived at 6, there were maybe a dozen or less people waiting in the front area.  We were the last to be seated, which... really, in my opinion... we were seated at 6:05 it wasnt really a big deal. I really wish I knew the name of our waitress.  She was slower than molasses running uphill on a cold January morning.   She asked for our drink order... my Dad asked what non BJs beers they had on tap. She wasnt sure, so she said she would find out.  About 10 minutes later she came back with a list.  About 20 minutes after that, he got his beer. Like I said, we sat down at 6:05.  My Dad ordered a Roast Beef Dip, my Mom ordered a Top Sirloin Steak, Medium (pink) with a wedge salad and a baked potato, and I ordered the Top Sirloin Steak Medium Well with a wedge salad with ranch, and rice pilaf. Around 7:00pm, my Dad asked another waitress to please ask the manager to come to our table.  We still did not have our food.  The food arrived just as the manager got to our table, and he told us to let him know how the steaks were.  He said it was a second round, the first round he told the waitress was not acceptable to take out to our table.  I let him know we both ordered the same steak, yet there were two different steaks on our table.  He said he would go ahead and just take both steaks off our bill, and he would include a free dessert for us.  It turns out I had the Top Sirloin and my Mom had the Rib-Eye which tends to have a bit more fat on it, so she was bummed about that.  My moms steak on top being wrong had the wrong side. I also don't understand why if the first round of steaks weren't acceptable to be sent out, how come no one told us?  Not a word.  Our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert, and we informed her the manager said he was going to take care of it.  She was confused by this, so we told her to just go talk to him.  Dessert took another half hour for a simple pazookie.  In the end, we sat at our table from 6:05pm to 8:05pm for a simple dinner.  It was so long, and so slow... it was almost painful. When anything was brought out to our table, it was brought out by someone who was not our server.  The restaurant was pretty full, but definitely had empty tables, and in my opinion had no reason to have us there TWO hours for dinner. What bothers me on top of everything else, is our waitress didnt once apologize.  She was not friendly, she was so incredibly slow and was just clueless in general.  Honestly it was the worst service I think I have ever experienced.  Anywhere.  Ever. I will give my review three stars, because in my opinion the manager, Art, handled everything top notch.  He came to our table and offered to take our food off the bill, and free dessert before we even had a chance to complain.  He was great.  The waitress, was horrific, which is why I just decided to settle in the middle at 3 stars. 5 stars for Art. 0 stars for our waitress."
Sierra R.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",2,8,2,4.0,7/10/2017,"Let me just get straight to the point. I come here a lot with my family. Whenever we have a special occasion we love coming to BJ's to celebrate, but recently my experience has been subpar. I got a small personal cheese pizza. It was soggy and goopy and just overall unappetizing. Our server was very apologetic though, and got me a new one. I have to say that it was very fast service and the new one was delicious. The other part of my meal was a churro pizookie. The pizookie itself was fine, but the thing that got to me was that it only had one scoop of icecream while in the picture on the table there was two. We told our server about this issue also and he promptly got us another scoop. The thing that bumps this review up from a three to a four is the impeccable attitude of the server and manager. I ended up talking to the manager later and she took the pizza off the bill. Overall I still hope to come here for years to come."
Yassi M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,20,8,2.0,5/20/2016,"The service at this BJs is very poor. Our server brought our appetizer and salad but we had to call her to bring sliver wear and plates! The deep dish pizza was just awful as well! It had very little toppings, sauce or cheese and it was like eating dough. They have no ideas how make a pizza! We should have sent it back but my son's were very hungry and didn't want to wait to get something else. Save your money and go some where else!"
Genre X.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,16,4,2.0,5/6/2017,Extremely slow service. Curbside order was supposed to be ready by 7:45. Got it at 8:15. Waited 30 extra minutes in car for a pizza??? Unacceptable. Food is mostly hit or miss.
Jerilyn G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,2,4.0,12/6/2016,"We just moved to the neighborhood.  We used to live in Irvine and frequented that busy BJ's, but it's too far away for a quick midweek dinner.   After looking at the Yelp reviews for the RSM location, I was apprehensive about it.  However, my husband and I wanted to get the ""Party for 2 for $25"", so we stopped in last night.  Since most bad reviews for this location were about service, I figured our food would be fine, and it was good. We were very lucky to have Bryce as our server.  He was fabulous!  He kept bringing drink refills, kept us informed on when our food would be out, etc.  He was also kind, friendly and provided excellent service.  I'm very glad we decided to give this location a try!"
Vivian V.,"Buena Park, CA",21,67,31,5.0,4/18/2016,"Nice location, very close to our home. We come here at least once a week. Sometimes for a date, sometimes for a late night drink, sometimes with friends, sometimes with family. As of recently, there's always a manager walking around or in sight if you need anything. Staff is friendly and seems well trained (I don't believe any of our servers have deserved anything less than 20%) compared to other locations.  I just tried their new magnolia peach beer- sweet, but not too sweet. I love their seared ahi salad for lunch and hubby and I tend to always get a large deep dish pizza to go! We've also recently enjoyed their boneless wings, although I think they could be coated in sauce better. Tomato mozzarella salad is always phenomenal and I love their stuffed spinach mushrooms. Hubby's favorite meal is their Parmesan crusted chicken- I love it as well, can't seem to figure out how to replicate it so we don't mind coming here for our fix. I've always been a big fan of BJs, this location rarely disappoints. My only tip would be to take reward #s immediately at the host stand.. I always forget but I'm pretty sure we missed out of a couple hundred points because we forgot to tell them our number or we weren't asked for it."
Valerie S.,"Irvine, CA",0,26,,1.0,11/27/2016,"Rude server & manager, terrible food! We typically like BJs, but something about this location's food really sucks. We had a terrible experience at our last visit too, decided to give it another chance today, big mistake. When I complained about the taste of my crappy pasta, the server said, ""hmm, Ive never heard that one before."" (how rude!) Then a manager came over and basically said oh well, too bad, no empathy at all. When the server took my full plate away, he made a passive aggressive remark to me. He is lucky I did not pick up on the comment until I left. My husband's pizza was bare (no cheese or sauce) on half of the slices for the second time at this location. We'll go to Selma's next time we want a deep dish sit down restaurant. BOO to EL Paseo BJs!"
Michael T.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",348,216,562,3.0,2/23/2014,"One word that perfectly describes this BJs restaurant is inconsistent. The experience is really hit and miss. Sometimes everything from the food to the service is great, but more often than not, service and sometimes the food misses the mark.  For example, the past two times, everything was good, but the two times before that, it was awful.  If you feel like rolling the dice, go for it."
Mike F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",58,52,56,4.0,5/27/2016,"We came on the busiest night and they still rocked the house.  We were seated immediately and had pre-ordered on their preffered customer app.  Mrs. Karen and me split fried pot stickers, the barb b q'd chicken salad which was wonderful and finished with the tavern cut Margarita.  Our waitress Tara, was very cordial and helpful when the preffered customer online app did not work.  We got to meet the manager who fixed the problem but would not rub my back for me.  Tell them Margarita Mike sent you."
Cyrano R.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/4/2016,"Went to BJ's yesterday with a couple of girlfriends, sat in the bar - waited 6 minutes to be seated, no hostess to be found.  Waited another 8 minutes before we were even acknowledged at our table in the bar.  Our waiter, Brendan, came hopping over and asked what we would like to drink, we ordered our drinks, only to wait another 10 minutes for him to bring them over.  The drinks were sitting on the bar for a few minutes before he picked them up.  He kept mentioning that he was the only one working in the bar and that he was slammed with tables.   Actually there were only 5 tables that he needed to be concerned with.  We overheard him stating that he usually works behind the bar and just picked up this shift and was still trying to get ""his act together.""  By 2:00 you would have thought that he would have it together !!! We ordered shareable appetizers, they were ok, nothing to write home about but we had waited so long for our food, anything would have tasted good.   Several of the customers at the tables were trying to get Brendon's attention but he was too busy socializing with either someone at the bar or the hostess.  As one customer got up from his table to pay his check, he had to find a waiter to take it because Brendon was nowhere to be found.  When Brendon picked up the check, he noticed the tip and made a cursing comment which was heard by several customers. Dude, what did you expect when your customer service skills were lacking today !   I am hoping that management has a conversation with Brendon as his service was below standard and unacceptable and if we return to BJ's and he is either behind the bar or waiting on tables in the bar, we will walk out."
Shahin N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,10,26,3.0,3/15/2015,"We are very close to this Bj and once a while  our kids like to go and eat. The plane is clean and beautifully designed with lots of big screen to watch different games.  I would give them 5 star for their place, but their food not so good.  My daughter Odered fruit as side for her dish, couple grapes was spoiled and a pice of hair in the dish, changed her mind to touch it.  We like BJ and I hope some day management pay attention to details."
Al F. A.,"Long Beach, CA",1,5,,5.0,11/10/2016,"Came in for lunch and had outstanding food and excellent service from a great, customer service oriented bartender named Jay and Al, the manager. Jay and Al are all about pleasing their customers and were constantly checking on me. Jay has a great personality, was very attentive to my needs and I will definitely be back for another great lunch and afternoon."
Steven W.,"Carlstadt, NJ",0,15,5,5.0,2/4/2017,Had a excellent experience today at BJ's... not only was my order made promptly but I was greeted by a great representative named Tommy who helped me with my Togo order.
Chipper S.,"Venice, CA",7,86,52,4.0,3/5/2016,Yes...I am a fan.  Love the pizza and love ending the meal with the Pizookie Trio!
Daniel P.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,38,1,1.0,10/31/2016,"I have a love-hate relationship with BJ's: The food is always delicious but the service can range from anywhere between good and completely unacceptable. Tonight was one of those unacceptable times. Essentially, they can't handle doing Curbside take-out. Two employees came out at separate times to ask for my name to grab my order, then left me waiting way too long before I went inside to try to pick up my food. At one point, they claimed that even though they both came out to check on me, it got busy. Apparently BJ's training teaches them that when it gets busy, you ignore your curbside customers that have been there longer than the folks who walk in to get their food. It took over 20 minutes to actually pay for and receive my order that was already fully prepared when I first arrived. My recommendation to both BJ's and other potential customers: Just say no to Curbside take-out. -------------- Update 11/11/2016: I originally wrote the above and gave it a 2 star review. At the same time I wrote the review, I also sent in my comments to BJ's corporate. I didn't receive a true apology at the restaurant and it's now been over 8 business days and I haven't received a true apology from their corporate office either. All I was hoping for was a genuine ""we're sorry, we messed up and we'll try to do better next time"" but it seems that's asking too much. If they don't care enough about me to even acknowledge my experience, then I don't feel they deserve any of my respect either. I am docking this down to a 1-star review for continued poor customer service."
Brad S.,"Murrieta, CA",408,2,,1.0,8/6/2017,"Worst service ever! Don't eat here! Especially at the bar. You'll never get service! I literally believe if I sat there all day, no one would wait on me! And it wasn't even busy. I sat there for 10 min while the staff walked past me, including the manager. I had to ask someone to please take my order. I had to ask someone twice to get me water. Then, waited 10 min for someone to close me out. Ridiculous! Some chic named Emily waited on me. She spent more time talking to her friend, than waiting on the patrons. She was in the corner of the bar, talking to the manager and another staff member, while I was out of water. Rude and horrible at your job! Couldn't give two craps less about serving me. And the manager was there the whole doing nothing. Worthless! I'll never eat at this BJ's again! I recommend people who read this go to Hannah's, Canyon Grill or other restaurants in the area. This place sucks! I hope someone at the BJ's Corp office reads this and fires Emily and gets the manager more training. Explains why this place has 2 1/2 stars. Any place under 3 1/2 stars needs revamping."
Abby S.,"Omaha, NE",4,18,5,4.0,3/27/2016,"A good happy medium between casual and formal dining. Beautiful environment, including sports tvs. This makes it an appropriate location for all activities. Service was professional, drinks and food were delicious. The only negative here is the price. Appetizers start at $10 and drinks alike in relativity. All in all it is a great place to go when know one can decide what they want and its pay day. Will be back!"
