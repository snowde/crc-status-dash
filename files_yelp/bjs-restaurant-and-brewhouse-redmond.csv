Lizzy P.,"Redmond, WA",0,17,1,4.0,1/9/2018,"Awesome service and food! This place is amazing and the cocktails are well presented, the service was good and the food was tasty, will go there again."
Mitch C.,"Kirkland, WA",0,4,,1.0,12/15/2017,"I had a terrible experience, and would suggest you save your money if you are looking for a place to eat. Our first waiter began our interaction cussing saying, ""first they order their food then they tell you how to f**king cook it"". You heard that right folks. After taking our drink orders he began to get frustrated and the computer program, cussing at it in front of us. Our waiter stated that he would be back with the drinks and would also seek help with the handheld device he was using to take our order. He shortly returned, without our drinks, stating that he would not be our waiter after all. ""(Insert name) will be your waitress, which is actually good for you guys because she is actually pretty f**king hot"".  Our waitress showed up and was much more professional than the previous one. She came shortly after with our drinks, and took our food orders. One or the two orders of our fries showed up almost immediately, which was odd considering we ordered them to be with our food. We waited for our food for quite awhile, our waitress notified us that our wings order was messed up by the kitchen. When the food finally showed, half of the wings were not even warm. The flavor was sub par and honestly you could get better quality chicken from a Wendy's 5 piece chicken nuggets! Meanwhile our other order of fries still had not shown up. At this point I asked for a manager to tell them about the food. Our waitress spoke to him and he appeared with our second order of fries....after we had already finished our wings. The manager was quite rude with hearing our concerns, seeming to want to leave before the conversation even started, and looking past us while speaking.  At the end of the night some of our food was comped but I can surely say I will never be back and will not ever recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Wendy W.,"Woodinville, WA",237,243,230,4.0,12/11/2017,"Easy parking Open late Huge selection They swipe your card and take payment at your table with an iPad.  So everything creates a streamline process to be seated quickly, served food quickly, so you can focus on quality time with friends family or get back to work.  I signed up for BJ restaurant emails and got free food bonuses added to my account. Each time we come we order something different. I like the pizza, chips, ribs, and steak.  We will be back Wendy"
Muzammil M.,"Herndon, VA",0,5,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Food is generally ok, but service .. Oh my god the service is so so terrible .. Last time we waited for like 45 minutes before food came in .. Looking at our expressions, they tossed in 2 pizookie ..  This time, it wasn't even crowded but our order was late as usual but the worst part was that I was casually told after 35 minutes that they are out of all broccoli cheddar soup and it would take another half hour to get it .. My wife's pasta was undercooked which we had to send back and get a fresh one.. New Year Eve perfectly ruined .. Definitely the last time we are here .."
Pete H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",37,251,287,4.0,10/25/2017,Business lunch with some clients here today discussing future opportunities.  Went very smooth in this environment.  No alcohol involved but only coffee and water.  :) We ordered brussel sprouts which were very good.  A solid 5-stars. The beef sliders were 2.5 stars.  Barely edible.  Rice pilaf replacement for fries  were soggy.  Couldn't eat much of either the slider or the rice. The parmesan stuffed mushrooms were edible.  A solid 2.5 stars. Service was very good.
Edward S.,"Seattle, WA",53,402,540,4.0,10/25/2017,"This location does not seem to have good reviews, but I have been here a couple of times for happy hour and had a good meal.  It has always been busy when I have gone for happy hour--so others must like this as well. The BJ's happy hour has some good drink and food specials.  I started with glass of red wine--which was a good deal. . The also have a great selection of beers (I like the harvest hefeweizen the most). I ordered the BJ's Classic Combo mini deep dish pizza (which is half price for happy hour).  Their deep dish pizzas are really good--and something not easy to find in Seattle.  It has a nice hard crust and is filled with good meat and vegies.  I think I like the sausage the most, but the mushrooms are good also.  It could use a little more cheese, but tasty. Since it was Tuesday, I finally decided to try the Pizookie since it was just $3.  This is a cookie covered in ice cream--but has the ""piz"" in front I think because it comes in a little pizza pan.  I had the white chocolate macadamia nut one with vanilla ice cream.  It was good, with great mix of nuts and chocolate (with strong brown sugar flavor)--then the ice cream went along with it really well.  I can see why these are popular. At least for happy hour, I think BJ's is great place to eat where you can get good value."
K H.,"Rock Island, IL",0,40,3,1.0,12/31/2017,This is the third time we have eaten here and it hasn't been bad. Today though our appetizers was over cooked and then with our meals our fries was cold. Place was not busy as it was on a Sunday afternoon. Told server that stuff was over cooked and cold and didn't take anything off bill! Plus we didn't get drink refills. This place is a joke and where is the manager to take up issues like this?!?!
Susan W.,"WA, WA",125,620,1484,5.0,4/12/2017,Went here last night for dinner with my family. There were 8 of us & we were able to call at 4pm & make a reservation for 5:30.  Seated and offered beverages quickly. Tegan our server was awesome. Top notch service.  Everyone loved their food choices.  Mom had a huge delicious Cobb salad.  Dad their excellent fish & chips.  Hubby & brother both got huge burgers. Hubbys could have been a little hotter but getting 8 people dinner at the exact same time can't be easy. Sister & her husband both had tacos. Sis the shrimp & bro-in-law Mediterranean chicken. But I definitely got the best dinner. The double cut pork chop with mashed potatoes & Brussel sprouts. I had fully half of my dinner leftover to go.   James assisted Tegan in serving our group. Great team. Will go back again if in the area.
Michael S.,"Bellevue, WA",23,33,21,4.0,11/7/2017,"I like this BJ's just fine. We went on a Monday when their deep dish and tavern cut pizzas are 1/2 off. That means you can get a pretty tasty pizza for ~$8! I'm also a fan of the beer here - it is surprisingly good! Usually when you get a restaurant chain that brews their own, it isn't anything to write about, but I'm a big fan of the ""nutty brewnette"" brown ale. There is a big tv behind the bar and a decently sized one in just about every corner, so you should be able to see some sporting event from wherever you sit. The food can come a bit slow, even when the restaurant doesn't look busy at all. The servers, however, are attentive and are quick to refill water and bring drinks. I don't go to a BJs often, but if I'm travelling and want something reliable and consistent, it is a great place to go. If I'm in a group, I know that everyone will find something they like here."
Nath H.,"Kirkland, WA",0,6,,2.0,1/5/2018,This is the 2nd time we came here. First time was way better. We were made to wait for forever for food and burnt food. It's good they didn't charge for the wings which was delayed by 45 mins. But they still charged for the burned sausages they served. I would think twice before coming here again.
Gina M.,"Kihei, HI",0,4,,1.0,12/9/2017,"The only reason I am giving this place any stars at all is because of the people. Waiters are nice, but service is horrible. Multiple times I have sat at my table waiting just for the check to come for over an hour. Food is average and pizookies are served cold and rock hard half of the time. If you are starving and will die if you don't have food, then this place will do the job. If you're looking for great food and great service, then this is not the place for you. I come in here angry because I'm hungry, and I leave angry because I spent money on overpriced average food. Do not recommend this place."
Judy L.,"Seattle, WA",272,133,122,1.0,4/19/2017,"Ordered avocado rolls, 2 salads and a mini pizza. 45+ min later our food is nowhere to be found. Kitchen supervisor came to tell us that they ran out of avocado egg rolls and that the kitchen is working on our food.  I should have steered clear when I saw the bad reviews, but I thought, ""Can't be that bad"". WRONG. I'm so disappointed at the kitchen staff. Our server was sweet and the supervisor was understanding so their downfall is the kitchen."
Sara F.,"Kirkland, WA",74,84,59,3.0,6/14/2017,"I've been here quite a few times. Service is inconsistent but my last visit's experience made up for the others. They have great daily specials on drinks... 1/2 wines, $5 calls, etc.  The food is pretty good, like the avocado spring rolls and the Pazooki might be one of the best dessert experiences of my life!"
Cindy R.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,1,5.0,12/10/2017,We had a large party ( 20 ) to celebrate a graduation. We messed up our reservations but Frankie and his team were able to accommodate us. They managed a table for us in reasonable time. Got us appetizers right away for those in the group who were starving.  We had two servers who were on top of it. Everyone got their food promptly and it was all correct.  A big job for a big party. We all had deserts and left full and happy. I recommend Frankie and his team to everyone. Thank you BJ's for a great meal for our wonderful celebration.
Nemi V.,"Bellevue, WA",7,13,2,1.0,10/8/2017,"The food was so obviously pre-frozen and either microwaved or speed-grilled. The potato skins in particular were appalling. The steak, which we ordered medium, was medium-rare on the inside, and burned on the outside. I took a picture just so I could upload it to a review, it was so bad. A definite no from me in the future"
Swaroop S.,"Redmond, WA",0,2,1,1.0,12/31/2017,"The manager, ""Dave"" is very rude.  Food is average.  Service quality was spotty.  Our waitress was helpful."
Hyam F.,"Seattle, WA",122,109,80,2.0,9/11/2017,"This used to be a good place. Sadly all of their food is awful. Their salads aren't even salads and that sucks for someone who loves their greens. Everything else is heavy on oil and grease and large portions of fat and fillers. The only thing to go here for, for me and everyone I know are their pazookies but even those I know many people who go once and make their own at home (lol)!  Umm there have been good servers and bad servers. It's just not a place you invest your time and money in. You really want to pay a company for this kind of food? Yikes."
S C.,"Bellevue, WA",9,410,,1.0,8/13/2017,"5 stars for the beer - they really have good brews, as at all their locations. 0 stars for really inconsistent food and service.  Have had much better experience at their other locations in Bay Area or even south by Airport.   After a couple years they should have figured it out by now."
Mia C.,"Bellevue, WA",293,130,1772,4.0,7/22/2016,"My three friends and I came here after wakesurfing in Lake Sammamish, pretty much starving.  We ordered a half pepperoni and half chicken pizza, buffalo boneless chicken appetizer with bleu cheese and ranch, two orders of steak with shrimp (one parmesan, one creole), and a chocolate chunk pizookie and cookies and cream pizookie. We also ordered a few pale ales, strawberry lemonade, and a strawberry mojito. For the mojito, I asked for half syrup, or else it would have been too sweet. The food was all really good. Then again, we were really hungry! Our server was Tri, who was very attentive and checked on us a lot.  The total bill was around $180 before tax and tip."
Terry J.,"Woodinville, WA",0,21,,5.0,10/25/2017,I have just discovered the great happy hour here :-) it goes until 7 which is longer than most in Redmond that end at 6. They have a good blonde on tap that is delicious that my last favorite bar stopped caring after the summer. The happy hour food is delicious. I had the $6 Burger with french fries. The french fries were crisp on the outside and wonderful and the burger was Pink on the inside and delicious. This is my new favorite place for an after-work beer! Not to mention one of my favorite bartenders Dylan works here. He used to work at Canyon when before it became Sam's. He knows how to keep my glass full LOL much appreciated!  This bar also carries the WSU Pac-12 station so I can watch my cougar games here. And parking is easy breezy which is very very important to me at the end of the day.
Dan N.,"Kirkland, WA",6,41,2,3.0,10/12/2017,"I liked the food here, but service was very slow and not attentive. There wasn't even many people in the restaurant. I had to put my empty glass of water by the outer end of the table to see if I could get some water, waiter went by a few times and didnt seem to notice. Even after we asked for the check my glass of water was empty, had to leave thirsty after having prime dip and fries."
Amiram H.,"Redmond, WA",46,26,1,4.0,7/8/2017,"Quality has a lot to do with consistency.  The ability to turn the exact same product every single time is considered high quality.  The ability to do just that usually implies selecting good ingredients, applying a good process, and verifying that the results are consistent with the requirements. It's good for flights, car manufacturing, and restaurants. BJ's of Redmond is a great sports bar, restaurant, grill, and more.  The place has a very wide variety of foods on the menu, drinks, and desserts.  We have been going to BJ's for years, and we have no intention of stopping.  Quite the contrary, we recommend BJ's and we take guests there when they come to visit us in Redmond. Today we went for lunch.  Looking at me you might think that a triple deck burger with all the trimmings and a bucket of fries followed by a gallon of vanilla milkshake will do the trick.  Not even close.  At BJ's I usually order one thing, and one thing only: a Santa Fe salad.  It's salad precisely the way I like it. If you are interested in the ingredients, you can take a look at BJ's website.  Here are the ingredients: Romaine, blackened chicken breast, red onions, fire-roasted red bell peppers, jack and cheddar cheese, avocado, corn, diced tomatoes and crisp corn tortilla strips tossed with Santa Fe dressing. Usually, this is a very good salad, today it was different.  First look identified a missing ingredient, the chicken never made it to the salad.  A couple of bites revealed a sad fact: a second ingredient was missing as well: avocado.  Just to add insult to injury, a Diet Pepsi I ordered came flat, with a built in bucket of ice... My wife and I don't usually complain, but we did make an exception this time.  We called the waitress (feel free to use ""server"" if you wish), and expressed our ""concerns"".  To make a long story short: new guy on the salad line, grand apology by the GM (hard to tell what it stands for, although, General Manager is a possibility), salads dropped from the check, a new Diet Pepsi, and we were happy again. So here is the deal: BJ's is a great restaurant.  They are usually consistent, and consistently good.  The environment is great, and the food tasty.  The service people are courteous and kind.  In short, they had a problem, they identified it, rectified it on the spot, apologized for the failure, and paid the price. I suggest that even though our experience today was less than perfect, we recommend BJ's as a great place for lunch and dinner. And a lesson learned here: I usually avoid writing reviews on restaurants I frequent.  I write about occasional or one time visits, and I write on exceptionally good or amazingly bad experiences.  When it came to BJ's, I wanted to make sure everyone knows: mistakes do happen.  But if handled correctly, they should never affect the rating of a restaurant."
Jason A.,"Revere, MA",0,5,,4.0,10/24/2017,Service is really good here. Other than that the food is mediocre. I ordered a burger and some fires. It was messy and nothing stuck together. Our waiter was really nice and did an amazing job. However the food like I said before was mediocre. Still recommend the place but the food is a hit or miss.
S M.,"Seattle, WA",0,260,,3.0,10/4/2017,All BJ's are pretty much the same (restaurants that is) though this one seemed to have a smaller beer selection and the service was so-so... but! the food was good. I would return.
Chris H.,"Redmond, WA",0,13,,4.0,10/8/2017,"I love this restaurant.  I always go here for the Rib Eye steaks.  Never over priced and always cooked to perfection!  Large menu selection, friendly environment, and a great beer selection."
Jennifer J.,"Bothell, WA",31,18,7,3.0,9/23/2017,"The food was fine, but the wait was not acceptable.  The time it took to place our order and receive food was too long.  The sever was nice but they obviously need more staff."
Katie L.,"Bothell, WA",348,6,,5.0,9/29/2017,"Stopped in at this restaurant before seeing a movie at the Redmond town center and it was great! Got an appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) and a few drinks. Service was great, Jessica was our server and she was on top of it.. many beers on tap and a great selection of food on the menu! I highly recommend eating here."
Banana M.,"Seattle, WA",3,118,81,1.0,1/10/2017,"If I can give this place a zero, I would. We only came here because of a puzzle event that gets held here.  The food here is terrible. We have gotten frozen wilted salad, fermented sour soba noodles, overcooked and chard bison burger... the list goes on. On top of all that, it took an hour for our food to arrive on a day the restaurant wasn't even full. I suggest going somewhere else if you want edible food.  Next time there is a puzzle event here, I will make sure I eat somewhere else first. Definitely would not recommend coming here."
Zarinna C.,"Everett, WA",3,26,1,1.0,12/27/2016,"The service, our waiter, was fine. He prompt on taking and delivering our drink orders. He was also really polite and we only had to make request for items once and he was able to deliver without us having to request for it again.  The one star is really for the kitchen. We spent two hours at the restaurant and it was not by choice.  Our appetizer took 30 minutes to come out and it was only calamari. Our meals which were really simple and nothing fancy took 45 minutes to come from the time we ordered it. The food was warm and not hot. Our fish tacos were burnt. We made the mistake of ordering desert. That took another 30 minutes. Our poor waiter had to follow up on it. Once we received it the plate that was suppose to be hot was only luke warm and the cookie at the bottom of the plate was not fully cooked. It felt like we were eating  cookie dough."
Capt k.,"Kirkland, WA",45,176,783,1.0,7/17/2016,Four words.  Go to Red Robin!!!!!!! you will get better food and better service there.  Bj's burger is smaller than the bun and is very dried.  the food is pitifully small.
Sheryl T.,"Bellevue, WA",6,12,19,4.0,4/25/2017,"Had dinner with a friend here. Waited a few minutes for a table for two. The easier was very friendly and well spoken. He gave us time to check out the menu but also checked in to see if we had any questions. I had the deep dish ziti and split the fried artichokes. Loved the ziti, artichokes were okay, different. We had the cookie dish for dessert. I had the Oreo which was very good. Definitely would like to return."
Vinodh Kumar C.,"Irving, TX",183,115,359,4.0,6/24/2016,It was a Friday night and am here at the BJ's. The servers are very quick to give the menu and bring the drinks onto the table. Food order was a little delayed which I think is expected considering the Friday night crowd. They gave me a VIP coupon which had a 20% off on food till a valid date . Nice place to hangout for a good conversation with someone !!!
Angelina R.,"Redmond, WA",1,25,22,5.0,9/9/2017,"Jonah (according to the check) was very nice and attentive. Food was good, as always. I don't know why this place has 2.5 stars.... I think they should have at least 4. Will definitely come back."
Natalie B.,"Marysville, WA",26,4,3,2.0,6/28/2017,"Servers standing around talking, bartender watching tv, ran out of their signature root beer. Not coming back."
Mike L.,"Redmond, WA",148,3,1,1.0,4/23/2016,"Server was good this time which is rare. That said this time I ordered blackened chicken salad.  Salad came out with no chicken.  Server took it back.  Returned with what looked like boiled chicken with some grill marks.  Not blackened.  Server apologized and offered to take it all off the check. All was good until the manager who clearly should not be, told her to come over and educate us on ordering.  He said that ""blackened chicken"" means that it was just regular chicken that when put in the salad dressing ""turned black somehow"" and that they don't actually ""do"" blackened chicken unless its requested specifically when the salad is ordered. The server was dumbfounded as to why this was the case but under instruction from this idiot was forced to tell us this.   Let me educate you General Manager about your choice of manager... Hes not really a manager just cause you happened to make him one. Just like magical chicken doesn't turn itself black by itself. We verified as we were leaving.  Menu says salad comes with ""blackened chicken""...  But now that the manager educated us,  next time ill order correctly and say that I want ""blackened chicken"" on my blackened chicken salad rather than ""blackened chicken"".  Thanks BJs I've become that much smarter because of you. I will come in one more time.  Use my $50 in rewards points I've accrued from my former loyalty to buy one more blackened chicken salad and beer and then go somewhere better from here on out.  For the rest of you in the area...Lots of better choices around here than this place until they get their act together."
Leela S.,"Seattle, WA",47,857,126,3.0,8/10/2016,"I've come to BJ's for happy hour after work a couple of times now. Pro tip: happy hour is valid only in the bar area! We once lost 20 minutes of HH due to this because it took us a while to get seated and subsequently noticed in the restaurant area, but now I know better! The tap list at BJ's is really not too shabby. They brew several beers, covering a variety of styles. In addition to their own brews, they also pour beer from other local breweries. I've enjoyed BJ's own beers, especially the seasonal options: the chocolate stout and peach saison have been the standouts for me. However, they also always pour the scotch ale from Bellevue Brewing Company, which is one of my favorite Seattle-area beers, and I thus pretty much always end up ordering that as my second beer. You also get $1 off each beer during happy hour, which is decent but nothing to write home about. I've personally never tried any of the food here, but I've heard underwhelming reviews of it from my friends who have. However, if you're simply looking for a few beers in this part of Redmond, BJ's will probably satisfy your needs."
Terry D.,"Lynnwood, WA",71,237,310,4.0,1/15/2017,"This is a good restaurant that has a broad menu selection, good service and good location. Nothing 5* about it but they do everything well. Great place for business lunches because of the menu variety."
Cheryl P.,"Redmond, WA",138,2,,1.0,4/15/2017,"Terrible experience yesterday. Ordered my beer and it took 15+ minutes to get it (and two checks with the waiter). Ordered a dessert (to break a 9 hour fast) but after 25 minutes had to call the waiter and cancel the order, because there was no ETA and we had to perform in a show; we were out of time.  An hour at BJ's and they could only manage a beer, and that only halfway through. No real recognition of the bad service, barely an apology, just a ""I'll have to go to the manager to get the dessert removed."" Yes, the dessert never served, it's literally the least the place could do. Skip if you're in a rush or going at major mealtimes; there are better, more attentive options in Redmond."
Sergey S.,"Redmond, WA",6,12,4,1.0,10/23/2016,"We ordered calamari rings, which were wet and fried and avocado egg rolls which were just disgusting, nothing to compare to CheeseCake factory version. Avocado was brown and overcooked, the rolls itself were wet and falling apart in hands. For the main course we ordered rib eye steak which was hot when arrived, and that sums up everything good I can tell about it. The meat itself was chewy and lacked any taste."
Krystal V.,"Seattle, WA",0,19,1,3.0,11/21/2016,"BEST FRENCH FRIES IN REDMOND. hands down. Plus they serve Pepsi, so that's always a winner in my book.  I've only ever had their buffalo wings (which were a bit cold both times I had them) and a bacon burger, which was fine. Sometimes the service is a bit slow.  On the bright side, they let me sit at a booth in the bar section and grade. Servers were attentive, but not obtrusive. I appreciated that."
