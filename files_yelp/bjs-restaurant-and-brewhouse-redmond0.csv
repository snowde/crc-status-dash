Amani R.,"Redmond, WA",80,32,12,1.0,9/13/2015,"Would never come back. Rude service. Complained to manager- he didn't care. We ordered an appetizer, that said no bacon on the ingredients. They added bacon as a topper when there was no bacon mentioned within the ingredients. Would rather dine at the place next door then go to BJs even if their food sucked. This is how bad this place is."
Jay C.,"Woodinville, WA",0,5,,2.0,5/26/2016,"The only reason to come here is the beer and the pizookies. The menu is extensive, but seems like the place is mismanaged from the wait staff, seating process, and kitchen. There is always a wait, even with lots of open tables. Staffing model needs help. The actual wait staff is good, but suffer from a slow kitchen. Food very inconsistent. Sometimes good and other times not at all. Will not be back. Too many other good choices in Redmond."
Cheryl K.,"Bellevue, WA",0,10,,1.0,5/25/2016,"The restaurant serves basically pub grub. We made the mistake of thinking it would be a fun and reasonably quick place to eat.  Two hours later, we were finally leaving the restaurant, wondering why our salads and sandwiches took half the night to prepare. One of the kids had fallen asleep by the time our food arrived. The waiter kept blaming it on ""the slow kitchen."" But then, he only brought our to-go box after three requests."
Andy L.,"Sammamish, WA",0,1,,3.0,7/19/2016,"Wait was long, and server messed up drink twice.  But they were kind enough to give us free dessert as an apology."
LA G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,29,,1.0,6/7/2015,"How many chances do I give this place??? Yet another ""meal"" with slow service, poor quality food and dirty plates, silverware. Tried getting the waiters attention (over and over): nice guy but not sure any servers get help they need fm kitchen or restaurant management. Come to think of it, have never even seen a manager at the Redmond location. Done with this place."
Sara D.,"Bellevue, WA",0,8,2,4.0,12/5/2015,"We came in the middle of the afternoon so I can't testify to their service during busy hours, but our server was very polite and attentive. The selection was great and my husband and I both loved our meals (roasted salmon quinoa bowl and chicken pita tacos). We had our kids with us and they both loved their meals and stayed entertained. Also loved the 'beer cocktails' (can't remember what they called them). I tried their version of a black & tan, guiness and cider. Tasty!"
Craig C.,"Seattle, WA",4,2,,1.0,2/17/2014,"I've been to this restaurant 4 times now, and the experience has been consistently poor.  This is disappointing because I have been to other BJ's with good results. The service in the Redmond location is just plain awful.  Wrong orders, cold food, slow responsiveness, and general lack of concern for the customers.  I will not go back and would not recommend to anyone. There are MUCH better choices in Redmond, and that is saying something!!"
Win W.,"Issaquah, WA",0,53,13,2.0,11/7/2016,"After using their carry out service about a dozen times, we've NEVER had a to-go order go as planned, fulfilled correctly, or be ready on time, so we've just given up on that option all together.  We like some of their dishes (OMG, their pizza!) so we still dine in a couple of times a month and don't usually have any problems, until recently.  We sat at our table without any service for about 15 minutes, then finally ordered.  Both large parties next to us (6 and 8+ diners) ordered, received their food, finished and paid before we even received our orders.  Manager didn't seem concerned when we mentioned it.  Our bill was rung up incorrectly so a different manager was fetched to attend to it, which took 20 more minutes.  The kicker in this whole experience was that they were not even busy.  It was a completely slow afternoon with plenty of staff that just stood around talking.  It was just too bad of an experience with no apology and care from the management.  We're done with the place."
Wes S.,"Bothell, WA",1,3,1,1.0,2/21/2014,"3rd time and I'm done. Orders are either wrong, cold or a combination of both and staff are underwhelming.  I wish Desert Fire never closed this location, they were much better."
Randy K.,"Oakwood, OK",184,205,346,3.0,6/22/2015,"Love the atmosphere at the Redmond location. Have to say they need to work on their staff just a little. One of the people in our party asked what the house Chardonnay was and he responded a, ""Riesling"". It was funny, he did figure out what he said and corrected it to St Michael. The food was okay. We had some flat breads which tasted pretty good though they were a little soggy in the middle. The Calamari was cooked well but it just lacked seasoning. You shouldn't need a dip to make something have flavor. Service was a bit slow as well. I'd still eat here if the occasion called for it."
Shoham D.,"Redmond, WA",42,80,,4.0,11/5/2014,"Been here a couple of times.....like this place for the very convenient location in the heart of Redmond (also very close to home), great drinks, and pretty good food. We are not big fans of beer so generally have their cocktails which are really mixed nicely. Appetizers are good - try the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Rolls and Crispy Calamari. Haven;t tried the pastas here, fish and chips though was pretty decent. Overall a convenient place to hangout in downtown Redmond whenever you are in the mood for a couple of drinks! :)"
Jim T.,"Issaquah, WA",26,124,,2.0,5/2/2014,"Very disappointed. First time at the Redmond location. Received an awards coupon for a free entree so decided to come in, but failed to notice it was only for the Tukwila location. Oh well, my bad. Tried several brews hoping for a change from past experience. Well, not expecting any, but hoping. Nope. Beers still lack character and all taste too similar even across different styles, which seems weird. Decided to try the ribs, and couldn't even eat much as they were so overcooked and dry. The sauce was unremarkable too. Other plate was, I believe, an ahi taco small bites dish. This one seemed to be all tuna without much garnish. Maybe some pico would have helped? A fruit salsa? Even more lettuce! Anyway, it was basically tuna on a  cracker. I've really tried to like BJ's, but despite a great menu and beer selection the delivery just doesn't make it worth a visit."
Sam I.,"Seattle, WA",0,21,,1.0,8/13/2015,"Not surprised to see so many low reviews of this place after my experience tonight.  My friends and I have been coming here once a week for a couple weeks now after work to grab dinner- food is decently priced and the location is near where we all live/need to commute to. We have been very pleased with our experiences until tonight.  Our waiter Roy was a mess. Rude, very unsure of what he was doing, made it seem like everything we asked was making him go way out of his way and he rushed us out like there was a line of people at the door (there was not). The past couple weeks we have had great service from various waiters/waitresses but Roy made our dinner horrible.  He forgot to give me back my out of state license after getting it checked when I ordered beer- thankfully we went to the mall after and I noticed and we went back. When we were there getting my ID back I thought I'd talk to the manager about how horrible our experience was so she would know we frequent there and have enjoyed it until Roy came into our lives.  She totally blew the comment off and said she would coach better... After looking on yelp and seeing all the negative reviews I can see that obviously this coaching is not going well.  My friends and I will be looking for a new place to get decent food and drinks after work with service that doesn't suck and a manager that does more for their loyal customers!"
Michael A.,"Bellevue, WA",290,9,8,1.0,3/11/2015,"I waited 25 minutes for my beer, we had to send my wife's pizza back because it was prepared wrong. Her mojito was flat and tasteless, I boxed my scampi to bring it home and add flavor to it and the server didn't know what kind of beer or steak sauce they carried. I'm in the business and this was just plain disappointing. I will never go back..."
Ashley M.,"Redmond, WA",45,234,33,3.0,10/29/2014,"We came here on a Monday night and there was no one waiting for a table - an experience I've never had at any BJ's I've been to, which was great. The host was so nice and even felt bad that we had to wait at all. Our server was nice, but never came back to check on us. He also didn't help me make a change to an order. The food runner quickly put the dishes in front of us and walked away, not looking at us, or checking if we needed anything else, which we did. And as with every BJ's, the food took forever to come out. I do like that they offer a wide variety of food, and it's always good. The food and dessert were good, the service so-so, and the wait time was great. Parking was bad."
Michele J.,"Redmond, WA",0,8,,1.0,8/31/2015,"I wanted to like this place, so much so that I went back 3-4 times even though my experiences there were all horrible. Well, I'm done. Not going back and I warn any friends who mention it to stay away. Here are the problems I encountered EVERY time: Out of the drink I wanted (I like sweet alcoholic drinks, like peach margaritas or sangria), the service is terrible (ridiculously slow), the food is blah, and they are always out of crayons for the kids menus. What's the point of a kids menu if they can't draw or color? The waitstaff is frequently rude and drop off the face of the earth when the food is delivered (they probably know complaints are coming). The food is often overlooked and just not that great. My daughter ordered a cheese pizza and it smelled like vomit. It seriously smelled like puke!  Do yourself a favor, go to Frankie's or Tipsy Cow or basically anywhere else for food."
Amber h.,"Woodinville, WA",13,15,1,5.0,11/9/2015,"My family and I come here quite often and we absolutely love their food.  Service wasn't the best but we still love the food. The last few times we have gone we have loved the service.  Tonight was the second time we have gone to their beer dinner event which is absolutely amazing and totally worth it. You try food items you may have never order but man they are good!! Out server tonight, Jonathan was great! He was very friendly and dealt with some of our higher maintenance guests extremely well ;). He was our favorite server that we have had! The guy they have Peter, talking about the beers was great just like the last time! And he remembered us!  The food here has never let us down! We highly recommend the honey siracha Brussel sprouts ( my bf and I had never had Brussel sprouts and these were amazing) and avocado egg rolls are to die for. My favorite entre is their cherry chipotle salmon and as of tonight their root beer glazed ribs were.. OMG soooo good!!!  After our beer tasting tonight, with such amazing service, I felt I needed to write a review. Thanks Johnathan for the great service! And the chef(I forgot his name but he was an amazing chef!) for dealing with our high maintenance requests, and the whole staff for being so great!!"
Joe Bob C.,"Bellevue, WA",2,12,6,1.0,2/26/2014,"First and foremost, they do have a credible selection of beers; they had a good selection of IPAs, and the wife appreciated the Hefeweisen. However, I am confused about the beer awards the place claims; I tried the IPA, and there is no way that it holds a candle to local brews. Perhaps that is not a fair comparison However, after our 3rd visit to the restaurant tonight, I'd have to say we will not come back. We both ordered wedge salads, which came in a reasonable amount of time,and were more than passable.  We also ordered the pepperoni flat bread and boneless chicken wings.The wings were 6 sad little pieces of chicken which appeared to be McNugget castoffs. Now, in fairness, it was the happy hour wings, but it still was very little to munch on.  The pepperoni flat bread was reminiscent of a Totino's pizza from the 80's, without the pleasing chemical aftertaste. In all seriousness, the sauce was acidic and sweet at the same time, which I thought impossible.  The upside was the wait staff, who were very attentive, and our orders came in a timely manner.  The one star on this is purely on the food; if you are looking for some good selection of brand beers, have a go, but honestly, you would fare as well foodwise in a dive bar."
Venecia R.,"Bellingham, WA",13,23,20,1.0,3/21/2015,"Love the BJ's chain of restaurants and have been a big fan of coming to this newly opened location near us. However, the service has slowly made us not come back. I understand that we have to wait on a busy Saturday, and expect delays, but our drinks took 40 minutes to arrive. They were warm, with little ice. I had to tell the server what my drink was twice, and she didn't know what beers were on draft. Very upset about the lack of knowledge their servers have and slow service!"
Tylor G.,"Redmond, WA",0,25,16,2.0,5/28/2014,"I wish they didn't serve the Pizookie in a aluminum dish. Don't they know it's bad? Oh yeah I forgot, health is not very important in Merica. Let's put some GMO ingredients in Pizookie too now.  Rest is alright and just like any other random place."
