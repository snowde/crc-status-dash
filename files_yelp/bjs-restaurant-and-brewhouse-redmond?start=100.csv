Heather A.,"Cincinnati, OH",1289,288,1184,5.0,2/18/2014,"I treated a co-worker to lunch here, since he had never been before. I explained to him that it was one of those places that has just about everything you could think of on their menu, so no matter what your mood, it will satisfy a craving... especially if your mood is ""cookie (pizookie) monster."" He ordered the BBQ lunch platter from the ""I don't care about calories"" section of the menu. I ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop from the ""Under 575 Calories"" page. After about 5 minutes, the restaurant manager (I assume) came out and apologized that the first attempt at cooking my meal was unsuccessful. Apparently, they burned the pig right out of the pork.   I can't tell you how much I appreciate that the error in cooking my food was caught by someone else, before it was even served to me! AND that they'd go out of their way to tell me about it and apologize! Even my co-worker said, ""Wow. I've never seen THAT happen before."" I have, but only on Hell's Kitchen... and I was impresssed. Obviously, BJ's has great management. She even explained that it would take about 4 extra minutes to fire up a new pork chop (setting expectations - very nice!). She offered me my choice of soup while my co-worker was being served his meal. Another nice touch! Malibu Cafe (see my review) should probably be taking notes from BJ's on how to ensure customer satisfaction, but I digress... I opted for a bowl of their chicken tortilla soup. It was full of fresh chiles, avocado, chicken and a delicious broth, which could have been a little warmer, but it still mostly melted the cheese. My co-worker's platter consisted of BBQ Chicken, a BBQ pulled pork slider, and shoe-string fries. All were delicious. My pork chop came out in the time promised, and was BBQ'd to perfection; juicy, tender, flavorful, and lean. It was accompanied by red potatoes and green beans, which were also perfectly seasoned. I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service provided by the wait staff and the follow-up by the manager. Kudos to this BJ's for getting it right, even when something goes wrong. I'll definitely be back."
Teressa L.,"Newcastle, WA",87,543,467,4.0,3/4/2016,"This place has gluten free offerings that are good.  My gosh, the cookie dessert is amazing, my whole family tries to steal it from me.  Lots of drinks to choose.  My kids like the root beer and creme sodas.   They have their own beer choices and drinks.  It gets busy/loud at happy hour.  We have enjoyed the food every time we come here.  It's a chain and has some generic menu offerings, but it's the gluten free cookie dessert that brings me back.  Our service has always been acceptable."
Forrest H.,"Renton, WA",80,44,15,1.0,2/7/2016,"Ordered a steak,  medim well. It came medium and had it sent back. Upon return (15 minutes later, my friend was done with his meal) my steak came back, lukewarm and still medium. Not having the time to send it back again, I just ate it.  This same thing happened last time but the manager came by and fixed the problem, not this time.  My servers name was Edwin, not once did he ask about my steak or give me an eta when it would be back."
Rebecca B.,"Bothell, WA",0,4,,4.0,7/5/2017,Had a chance to go to BJs for happy hour and I was pleasantly surprised. I got one of the deep dish mini pizzas and it was great! On top of the food the service was quick!
Ginger B.,"Seattle, WA",24,50,96,1.0,3/21/2015,"Tried take out today. Did the curbside option. Sadly, killed the thought of some BJ's.  The host was nice but the food discovered when I got it to my friends house was sad. Dry and utensil less. Whomp whomp."
Renu G.,"Portland, OR",0,37,54,2.0,3/2/2017,"Tried it last night. They have decent appetizer and entree choices but service was poor. Peruvian quinoa was good although veggie topping was bland. I would give another star for their warm cookie dessert which is served with vanilla ice cream, which is very inviting."
Noemi M.,"Bellevue, WA",109,4,,5.0,10/27/2016,Went in on Sunday to watch football and the atmosphere was relaxing and top it off our server was amazing. Very energetic and super friendly. Appetizers and drinks were tasty! Thanks BJs!
Frank S.,"Redmond, WA",2,40,11,3.0,1/8/2016,"Ive attended BJ's many times, and each time I'd say it's a regular burger and pizza house. My like for the beers they provide brings me back the food is an after thought. I'd like to see the menu evolve as Red Robin's menu... I compare BJ to red Robin because it is... just in the same category. Generally i'd say eat but don't expect great food."
Ed W.,"Gainesville, FL",221,815,1256,3.0,4/11/2016,"Good place for lunch. The service was really slow, but it was good food. Our server was spot on, and kept our glasses filled. Sit outside if the weather is cooperative."
L. B.,"Issaquah, WA",1,26,,1.0,7/9/2016,"Went today and had a horrible experience.  The food was cold poor service and I still had to pay for the bad experience. No thanks, I wont be back"
Sara M.,"Redmond, WA",90,67,2,3.0,9/27/2016,"BJ's is nice, but I don't know that it's my first choice of places to go. The menu is huge and the service is good. But the food is kind of fun of the mill."
Karyn S.,"Bellingham, WA",73,135,519,2.0,5/7/2015,"I've been to BJ's in the Redmond Town Center a few times now and each time has always been okay. The food and service isn't great, but it isn't bad, either. Today I went to lunch with my work colleagues and it wasn't the best experience. I ordered the Thai Chicken Mango Salad. It tasted fine, but here were no mango's and little chicken. The server, Paul H., wasn't the best server. He said he was new to the restaurant, but felt he seemed irrigated and rude. He took a long time to bring us our check, and once we got our check, it was wrong. Each time I've come to BJ's, my experience is, the food is fine (they have a huge menu, so there is lots of variety to choose from), the price is okay, but the service could be better. I'll still go there and try them again, but BJ's isn't my top choice."
Kelly B.,"Soquel, CA",57,1,,1.0,7/16/2016,Had the worst service ever. We have been to many BJ's restaurants.  We ordered our food and it took 45 minutes to get it. The three tables next to us all order after and got their food before. One even paid and left before our food came.  On top of that one of the orders was wrong. He said within 5 minutes it would be fixed. 20 minutes later he came back with a replacement and it was still wrong.  By this time the rest of us were done. My daughter took one bite and that was it.  We order a small pizza.  They said upgraded to medium due to us waiting. Only issue is it clearly had been done for a very long time before we got it. I requested the manager twice and he or she never came. Can't believe how poor their service was.
Mitu R.,"Bellevue, WA",55,14,,1.0,12/10/2016,Never hated a place much more than this location. Extremely poor customer service. I made a reservation online before i stepped in.. they couldn't find the reservation and wouldn't oblige although i provided with all the info they needed and were making racial discriminations. The folks working here need to learn to respect the customers. Disappointed!! Never going back!
Robert G.,"Bothell, WA",95,16,1,1.0,8/5/2016,"Terrible food, terrible service. One and done. Good location, that's the only reason they stay in business."
Aaron S.,"Seattle, WA",1,11,,1.0,11/19/2016,"Can I leave ZERO stars? Oh, I can't? Well one star it is, generously so. Scene: booth next to bussing station, light so dark that reading the menu seems impossible, a bare table with girlfriend and her best friend who has brought her 2 year old.  After sitting for 20 minutes we finally got to order appetizers and the rest of our food. As we begin to realize that we have been sitting in our booth for 45min with no food the ""manager"" (I'm assuming) comes over to tell us how much he appreciates our patience and that the food is running 2-3min behind schedule.... 2-3 minutes? Are you high!? 10 more minutes go by and we start to notice management attempting to ignore our frustrated faces.  At minute 55 our appetizers come out (flatbread nachos, honey sriracha brussel sprouts, and lettuce wraps) and we all sit just noticing that we haven't even been given silverware or plates... we muscle through the appetizers (because we are starving at this point) after asking for silverware and plates from 2 different people that weren't our waitress because she's virtually non-existent. After 20 more minutes our entrees come out (BBQ chicken salad, and New Orleans Jumbalaya with a kids spaghetti) and we are even less impressed than the first round.  Much like the first course, our food is cold and the salad was swimming in whatever dressing they use. Also hey guys, if you're going to advertise it as BBQ chicken make sure there's at least one piece of chicken in the salad. There wasn't. Our final request from our waitress who magically showed up was, ""Can we please get a smaller fork, or a plastic fork for the 2 year old so she doesn't stab herself?"" She replied with something along the lines of, ""Yeah of course I'll get it right for you."" The child finishes her spaghetti as we watch our waitress maneuver around us in circles talking to other tables. Seriously girl, the bussing station is right be hind us.... Thankfully the fastest service of the night was telling our waitress we would really just like the check and be done. In seconds I was presented with a 74 dollar bill and a put a hundred dollars down. When our waitress came back with ""change"" she said, ""this was the best I could do for change, but it gives you a little extra back."" She gave me $30 back.  1. Don't steal from the business to make change you think I'll appreciate receiving.  2. Comp my meal... it was terrible terrible awful service.  3. Be apologetic for how terrible the service was, convince me you are even pretending to care.  4. If you're a manager don't be a cowardly little boy and try to avoid me because you and every one of your workers knows that the way our party has been treated tonight is abysmal and I INTEND to tell you all about it.  5. You had allllll the chances to try and make this right and you chose not to. It was a conscious decision to not give a flying... fart.  For all of those terrible things, I leave no tip, everyone in this room is now dumber for having gone to this restaurant, I award you no points,  and may that man upstairs have mercy on your soul. It. Was. Awful. Like bad bad bad bad bad. The worst. Just awful."
Lynn K.,"Duvall, WA",0,2,,1.0,3/27/2017,"Came in on a Sunday, fairly busy.  Not our first rodeo to BJ's.  While usually service is on the slower side and the food can be iffy, we found we loved their tortilla soup.  Took 15 minutes to get a drink order.  Wrong one came out.  Waitress looked completely puzzled when we ordered.  Took 30 minutes to make new drink.  Waited 45 more minutes for soup and salad.  Soup was cold and needed to be sent back.  Pizzooki was the only thing that was made in a timely manner.  Check came and was incorrect. Saw two other tables walk out after not getting service. Reading all these reviews I would wonder why the management wouldn't be more on top of this.  Will probably not be returning.  Too bad, could be a great restaurant."
Mhmt D.,"Redmond, WA",0,10,,1.0,1/28/2017,"Waiter was nice and did her best. Food was very slow. When arrived, kids pasta was swimming in marinara sauce. Both burger patties had many hard/dry parts. It is unlikely I will go there again, red robin is a block away."
J P.,"Snoqualmie, WA",0,11,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Probably the worst pizza I have ever had, very oily and no flavor.  Looks and tastes exactly like Pizza Hut (actually pizza hut might be a bit better). This is not deep dish pizza under any circumstances, the pan they brought the pizza out in wasn't even full, pizza only came up about half way (wish I took a picture).  Then once we want to pay and get out the waiter decides to walk around with my Credit Card in his hand and disappear for 10 minutes. Then comes back and goes to another customer while he still has my credit card in his hand - serves them - then goes to charge my card - where did this guy disappear too with my credit card?"
Katie G.,"Redmond, WA",157,4,1,2.0,7/25/2016,Don't go here if you're already hungry. The reoccurring wait time is usually 45-60 minutes. This wait also when it's not busy at all. The servers are nice and the food is good. Just know not to go if your on a schedule
