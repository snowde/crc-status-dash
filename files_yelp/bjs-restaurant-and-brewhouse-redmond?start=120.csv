Sheetal H.,"Seattle, WA",4,6,1,5.0,12/12/2016,Great food and amazing service. I have been here multiple times and always pleased with their service
Suzy P.,"Bonney Lake, WA",119,6,,2.0,7/15/2016,"This is the second time I've been to this location, food was soooo slow the first time I did not want to come back. But I tried again, lunch, not super busy.. Waiter was very nice, but of course the food was so slow! About 45 minutes.., and my salad seemed like it had been sitting a long time, wilting lettuce and the whole salad was warm !! Yuk."
Ryan M.,"Kirkland, WA",15,11,6,1.0,4/15/2016,"RUN, RUN, RUN!!!! So we get their at 7:20 and have a group so we don't expect to be seated right away, they tell us 20-30 minutes. So we get seated at 8:05 based on our receipt. We have kids, so the bring kids menus, but are out of Crayons, so the kids can't do the games, the waiter says, ""we have been out for 2 weeks not sure whats going on"". So we order drinks and start looking at the menu. (You are saying that is not too bad, right?), Now, the waiter comes to take our order and we want him to make sure he is aware we want checks split 2 ways, he responds with an OK, no worries we will do it at the end. (Remember this) While ordering food he is touching one of the babies hair and trying to be funny, and it really wasn't. Don't touch kids unless you know them or have permission from the parents. Then when bringing the food out salads came for some and not other, then some kids got there food while others had to wait. Now I had ordered a pizza and watch the waiter carry it out, drop it on the FLOOR, pick it up and say ""Well it landed on the bottom so you can still eat this"", and put it in front of me on table. SERIOUSLY. Then comes back and asks if I want another drink, but doesn't ask anyone else. The others had to ask the waiter, can I have a refill as well. Also didn't have enough silverware or plates, he took our order but couldn't remember what it was I guess. Also, he put the HOT plates in front of babies and leaves them there, just unbelievable. Its 9 PM now and we order a dessert and he comes back and says I took $10 off for the food I dropped, Mind you its a $13 pizza. So he comes to the table with one check, so I ask again if you can please split the checks, and please put the dessert on my bill. He comes back and says here is two bill and looks like I didn't put on your bill so the other person will pay for it. So did not listen to us, didn't seem to think our table was important and then billed us incorrectly. We got out of there at 9:20, not enjoying the food, the experience at all. DON'T EAT HERE, I have sent an email to headquarters as well, probably won't get a response."
Stacey W.,"Woodinville, WA",39,13,,4.0,12/12/2015,"We have considered trying this place a few times but the bad Yelp reviews turned us away. But this morning we decided to give it a try. My husband was impressed with the tv's everywhere and the selection at the bar.  The service was slow (the place was practically empty) and the waitress, although she was nice and friendly, had too many excuses for things. There seems to be a lack of strong leadership for the front of the house. We noticed staff in no hurry, walking around with nothing to do, and we also overheard our waitress complaining about another employee to one of the other waitresses.  The food was great! Our group ordered pizza, burger and breakfast. Everyone loved the food, everything was fantastic. We will definitely try this place again because the food was so good."
Paul S.,"Kirkland, WA",15,57,22,2.0,7/19/2015,"A far cry from BJ's in Southern California. The restaurants in California are better run, have better food and better service. This place, along with the location in Southcenter, suffer from poor service and mediocre quality. On this particular visit, we observed the restaurant was relatively quiet (Sunday at 4:30PM), yet told it would be a 10 min wait. After 5-6 minutes and observing other guests more frustrated with me, I called the Claim Jumper next door and asked them how long the wait is: they said 3-4 minutes. We left and enjoyed great service at Claim Jumper. Decent food, too.  Bottom line: if you've ever enjoyed BJ's in SoCal, don't expect the same here--you won't get it."
Eric G.,"Sammamish, WA",105,5,,5.0,8/20/2016,"BJ's is dope. Got the shrimp salad thing and dank mozzarella sticks. The best part of the visit was being in the middle of three pokestops. I set up lures on three stops and ate. You could say it was a very grand meal. Thanks you BJs, it was lit. :)"
Petrus W.,"Sioux Falls, SD",4,18,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Horrible service! They took 50 minutes from the time the first person got their food until the last person at the table was served, totally unacceptable! And I was the last to be served, and my steak was cooked to the same consistency of shoe leather (ordered medium!). Just a bad restaurant with no management with any leadership experience."
Stan A.,"Redmond, WA",52,8,1,2.0,10/4/2015,"Lousy service for the third time. The food was great but the claimed 1 server on a Saturday did not cut it after I counted 15 different employees circling the restaurant.  Bottom line: food good, service sucks. P.S. the waiter age 30ish did not know what a la mode was........"
Geri M.,"Renton, WA",20,27,1,2.0,5/30/2016,Poor service. It took over 30 minutes to get a simple burger. They added tomatoes to my husband's Caesar salad. Just bad.
Brigid C.,"Norcross, GA",0,12,,3.0,2/3/2017,"i have never gotten uncooked pasta at a restaurant before until i ate here a couple days ago. some of the chicken was undercooked as well?? our waiter also gave us flat root beer. my boyfriend got chicken parmesan and he says it was not their usual chicken parmesan. apparently this chain is actually pretty good, but unfortunately this particular location's kitchen is lackluster... oh well!"
Susan D.,"Redmond, WA",0,18,,2.0,10/21/2016,"I want to give BJ's  four stars but I cannot. Our dinners were very good, our server, Joanna, was excellent. The reason I'm only getting two stars is that I have a wheat allergy and opted for a gluten-free option. When I was halfway through my meal, I discovered that there was a penne pasta noodle in my tomato sauce. Fortunately, I discovered it before I took a bite.This is unacceptable.I told our waitress and I am hoping that she notified the kitchen staff.For someone with Celiacs disease, this could have been a disaster!"
Anna S.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,13,,1.0,3/26/2016,"Be prepared to wait...for a very very very long time. When we inquired, the hostess said it will take 15-20 minutes. We did not get called in till after 45 minutes. Once seated, it took another 30 minutes to get our food. Even getting a box and paying your bill, seems like an eternity. Management and staff seemed incompetent and not trained to handle business. Food was okay, ambiance was excellent. Unfortunately, we will not be coming back for the serious lack of service in this establishment. Please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
Virginia S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,19,14,2.0,4/5/2016,"I've been here two times now. I was excited to try a new restaurant close by. The food has been okay but the service is so bad! The first time we had to wait 15 mins before someone took our order and when the waiter finally came out he reeked of cigarettes. He was really swamped with people so I thought I wouldn't judge the situation. Then we came back in tonight and I was at first really impressed with how on it our waiter was BUT then he disappeared! My boyfriend got a second beer and I kept waiting for the chance to order one but I never got it! By the time our waiter got back to us, my bfs beer was half done and I'm a slow drinker so that really sucked. It's like after he delivered the food he was done waiting on us. The funny thing is- the place wasn't even busy!"
Cory B.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,10/10/2016,I went there on a Friday night and the food was good and all. But there was one problem with my experience and it was after this day. One of their employees took down my credit card information and spent $600 the next morning buying tickets on Ticketmaster. So they need to do a better job of hiring because they have pretty poor customer service. The service in the restarauant was better but this is still unacceptable.
Pritesh P.,"Redmond, WA",13,3,,1.0,2/25/2016,"Management is poor, half the restaurant is empty on a Thu eve, and still there are 50 people waiting to be seated. Just don't get it."
P G.,"Redmond, WA",0,5,,1.0,4/4/2015,"This place is truly a hit or miss restaurant. I've been here several times and sometimes it's a hit and other times a miss. The service depends on the manager on duty it seems. But the wait staff seem undertrained and I noticed some of the staff seemed to have an attitude about being there.  -I kept thinking it would get better, after all the place was sort of new. Sometimes we had a great time and got good service and sometimes the service was just awful with bad attitude on the side.    -The last visit was the finally straw: We got seated right away but had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders. This was puzzling because they were not busy as I saw the wait staff walking around laughing and talking with each other.  -After waiting quite a while for someone to take our food order-we flagged down a waitress and was told this table was ""unassigned""- but she'd come back in a minute to take our order. After long wait, she came back. Our food came out warm but tasty-however, she forgot some of it. -All the food took about an hour to get to our table and we never got refills or checked on afterwards. We asked for to go boxes but  had to get up and look for someone to take our money. Bottom Line: We were there about 2 1/2 hours, had 1 soft drink each, and didn't eat our food there..most of the time was spent trying to get service.  When this place first opened I was happy to have it so close to home and work- but it has turned out to be a big disappointment. Now we just go to Claim Jumper and always get good service and nice hot meals."
Eric F.,"King, WA",256,12,10,1.0,3/6/2016,"The food here is absolutely horrible.  Bland, cold, crap! Nothing good.  Flat bread is a joke.  Queso dip, or that is what they called it, was straight out of a can.  Avoid this place at all costs!"
Elmer C.,"Sammamish, WA",1,15,3,1.0,4/29/2016,"Never Ever Come Here on Friday (or ever) unless you want to test your powers of invisibility.  Waited 40mins to get seated.  Then waiter never came over after we sat down.  Had to flag manager down after 20 mins.  Its one thing to wait for a table or food (another 20 minutes)..But not to even be greeted--UNACCEPTABLE.  (By the way, they ran out of the dessert we ordered and decided to just substitute something else.  At least they decided not to charge us for it). Update: I'm such an idiot.  Decided to try this place again against my better judgement.  Good to know I still have my powers of invisibility after all this time.  Would rather eat a TV dinner than deal with such bad service.  Is there a NO star option on Yelp?"
Atsha N.,"Mukilteo, WA",36,37,60,4.0,7/8/2015,"We went here just for beer and dessert. They have quiet selection of beers which is good for those who enjoy it (my hubby and my brother in law). The cool thing is when my husband confused on what to order, they give him ideas and allow him to try couple of them. Me and the kids prefer to try they famous dessert; pizookie ( big skillet cookies with ice cream on the top). We ordered two kind of cookies: chocolate chip and cookies and cream. Both are really good. We had a great experience there. The service r also good and the ambience are nice. Maybe will try the food next time :)"
Fareed H.,"Lake Stevens, WA",120,239,292,2.0,5/27/2015,"I hate to give this place such low ratings because i want to like it. I went once and I'll never return. My friends and I came late one night and this place was pretty empty so I expected service to be fast. Not in the slightest, however our server was friendly enough so that and the modern stylings of the restaurant are why they are getting 2 stars and not a single one. I ordered a burger and it was mediocre to say the least but I finished it. I really wish I hadn't cause I ended up getting pretty sick that night. I probably won't ever return unless I see some serious changes."
