Vy M.,"Redmond, WA",198,91,144,1.0,10/12/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday dinner about a week ago. This was my first time here but my boyfriend has always loved Bj's so he was very excited to come back. As with any other restaurant, Bj's was packed on a Saturday night so our wait time was about 25 minutes, which wasn't bad at all. We were seated and our waitress brought out menus and greeted us. After about 15 minutes, she came back to take our drink orders and appetizer order. Long story short, we ordered the fried avocado rolls and waited for almost an hour, before the manager came over and told us that they had ran out of them.  Then, we got our meals and mine was terrible. I ordered the sirloin steak and I've never had a steak as dry and flavorless as this one. I had to dump a ton of A-1 sauce on it to make it somewhat edible. Applebee's had better steak than this, and we didn't have to pay as much either. I would not recommend this place on weekend nights because you'll get terrible service and terrible food."
Patience M.,"University Place, WA",45,1,,1.0,6/23/2017,"Worst restaurant experience ever!!! We made a reservation over two months before the actual dinner. The day of the reception dinner which was supposed to be a celebration of a wedding awaiting to happen, we got there on time. They took 20minutes to sit us. Then took another 20 minutes to get our drinks order .... then another 20+ minutes getting our drinks which half of them were actually plain water. We then ordered food .... in the meantime... the manager approached us at 6.20pm and let us know that there was another reservation at 7.45pm and we needed to be done by that time.... so 7.40pm rolls around and half the meals have been delivered, half the party are missing their meals including appetizers that were actually supposed to be served before the entree. At 8pm, a meal was still missing. Don't make a reservation here. Save your time because we spent over 2hrs trying to sort things out"
Alyssa V.,"Austin, TX",8,42,3,5.0,4/11/2014,"This place reached up into the stars and pulled down a five-star review. Unf. We started with the avocado spring rolls and they were absolutely amazing. The flavors all came through very very well, and the sauce was drinkably delicious. Jeremy decided to try parmasean chicken for the first time, and I got the crispy jalapeno burger with a veggie patty. The veggie patty was made in house, +1 star! It was amazing! Jeremy very rarely legitemately enjoys things. He is always neutral. He really enjoyed his parmasean chicken, he couldn't stop talking about it for two days. I am happy when he is happy! +1 star. My jalapeno burger was out of this world. Absolutely the best jalapeno burger i've ever had, and i've had a lot. It was so spicy I had to take breaks and wipe my nose. THAT is a good burger. Even past the spice, you could still taste how well the flavors of all the ingredients worked together. +1 star. Our server was very very peppy and kind. He came for the order and stayed for the conversation, he was a sweetie pie. +1 star. Last star, and most important: the bun on my burger. It was fresh, hot and squishy. It had that fresh-out-of-the-oven taste that you can't fake. Two thumbs up, guys. I left a very happy lady."
Whitney G.,"Bellevue, WA",159,48,5,2.0,5/1/2015,"Had the worst service ever.  Our waitress had no personality, which I usually wouldn't have noticed except that she laughed when my boyfriend stuttered while ordering.  Not only that, but his steak was trimmed so poorly that it was impossible to cut and eat. We're not ones to complain, so we just let it go, but I can't stop thinking about that giggle while my boyfriend was trying to order. I honestly never want to go back. I'll have my pizookie style cookie at 5 Spot on Queen Anne. Don't bother going here."
Brett W.,"Sammamish, WA",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2016,"I used to love the BJ burger. The meat was so flavorful and the bun, superior. No more, my whole table got burnt burgers that looked and tasted like something from a school cafeteria. Oh, and they are not cheap. Did I mention the long wait?  What are people eating here that keeps this place busy?  I won't be back."
Shawn W.,"Palo Alto, CA",29,19,,1.0,11/23/2014,Service is really slow. Staff seem lost walking around. I have given this place 3 chances and every time it had taken my family 3 hours to eat and leave. Terrible slow.  I would not recommend this place.
Sarah A.,"Kirkland, WA",2,7,4,1.0,12/18/2015,"This place used to be one of my favorite spots, but when I went last night I found a hair in my salad. It was really disgusting! When I told my server about the hair he seemed annoyed with me and simply took my plate away. I didn't even get an apology, and was promptly made to pay for my awful salad. It was very upsetting.  Would not recommend this place!!!"
Jacy O.,"Kenmore, WA",57,45,2,3.0,4/20/2016,"Service and beer were great! However, my order came out wrong and that's always disappointing. Otherwise, the food was okay. Probably won't go back as it is pricey for average food."
Chuy G.,"Oxnard, CA",51,78,8,2.0,9/11/2016,"My wife feels I'm being too generous to give 2 stars.  We have been to several BJs in Southern California and always felt is was worthy of a return engagement.  The Redmond store I earned a Dukedom (long story but in a nutshell super convenient for the situation I'm currently in) was different.  I just had one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant.  The food took FOREVER to arrive, the beer never came, refills had to to sit for a long period of time, the avocado egg roll was nasty looking and soggy.  The server refilled my iced tea with no ice and said something about ice which made me believe some ice was forthcoming but like the service it wasn't.  I can't overstate how bad our service was.  I did enjoy my beer, crispy asparagus, and potstickers when they finally arrived.  The bummer is that I typically like going here for sports and beer and appetizers and my wife has said never again unless it's just for a ""jonesing"" for pizzookie.  The Duke."
Lee S.,"Seattle, WA",0,41,,3.0,5/2/2016,"The beer was great. I would highly recommend ordering a ""taster"" of several of their beers to try some out. Their menu makes everything look so delicious but...nope. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? The French fries I ate off of my friend's plate were good; probably should've ordered that and beer and called it good. I had a deep dish pizza with a salad. Luckily the lettuce wedge wasn't as tragic looking as the one in the pic a few reviews below mine. It was actually pretty tasty. (Here again, should've stopped there probably.) The pizza tasted just like a cheap microwave pizza that you picked up at the convenience store frozen food aisle, rubbery cheese and all. The kind you know you're gonna regret eating later. There are varying levels of pizza delicious-ness but most restaurants manage to make it taste at least...ok. This was bad. The server and runner were good but the food came out very slowly. We were there for a couple of hours. I will probably come back for beer but won't have my hopes up for anything but appetizers or a salad. My friend liked her burger..."
Delores T.,"Bremerton, WA",19,39,10,1.0,12/16/2015,"GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!! I will NOT be back, the food was a major disappointment. The best thing I ate was the chips and salsa. The food was flavorless and not presented well, my lettuce for my lettuce wraps was wilted and were not cups, the Mac and cheese was dry. My daughter barely touched her meal (ended up being compted) and the only reason I ate half of mine was because I knew how much I was paying for it. On the plus side the server was very kind, she saved the experience from being completely awful."
Jeremy H.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",3,17,,3.0,4/29/2016,Not bad. The grilled ham and cheese was a bit too rich to be edible. The service was a bit slow. I would go again but would order differently.
Sara M.,"Seattle, WA",29,304,54,5.0,2/18/2015,Enjoyed dinner in the restaurant last night (not in the bar) and had a really great meal. The services was terrific and we'll be back for sure!
Paul L.,"Redmond, WA",194,414,380,5.0,10/25/2013,"No Joke  Ambiance: 5  Food: 3  Value: 4  Drinks: 5  Washingtonians love their beer. To survive in the pool, as a chain restaurant, you've gotta be one mean shark; and BJ's simply blow'em away.     Among the competition, RAM (adequate), Gordon Beirsch (terrible), Rock Bottom (good), and Elysian (excellent, but expensive), I've gotta say, I really like BJ's. Their food, is probably the weakest part (adequate, with a good lettuce wrap and really good fries), but everything else is pretty great. The have a huge TV wall capable of dividing up to show all the games in HD or being one big screen to show the hawks game. Plus its always happy hour during games.     That wouldn't mean much if their beers were meek, which I'm happy to say, the beers are very tasty. From the IPA to the Hef, I like their line up. (Their Oktoberfest is especially tasty). I love my sports bars and I like BJ's"
Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586,3.0,8/13/2013,"They started out strong, but I'm not really loving this location.  The menu is too long. This results in every kind of screwup you can imagine. Last night, it led to my husband getting deep-dish pizza instead of regular... a $5.25 mistake on a 14"" pie. For more bread?? Really? It wasn't even that great. He didn't notice that there were TWO whole pages of pizza. Excessive... and the waiter should have clarified and/or should have actually looked at the page my husband was pointing to. The gluten-free pizza is OK, but I am too cheap to pay $1 per topping for a small 9"" pie. That's OK for meats, but there's no way you can convince me you were going to put an entire bell pepper on a pizza that size. The kids mac and cheese is Kraft and I can make it better than that with my eyes closed. It was dry and clumpy and not even hot. The 5-year old ate it, but said Annie's is much better. The veggies -- broccoli and carrots -- were limp and raw and horrible, even to grownups. The potato-skins appetizer should be good but it's deep-fried to within a half-inch of all the way through -- there's no tender potato guts left -- and at $9.25, it's a grease bomb. Service was slowish and was not much to complain about until he super-graciously started apologizing for forgetting our drink refills... and then he was grumpy about the pizza mistake.  It cost $20 more than Red Robin around the corner, and honestly, can't even come close on the service. With giant screens flashing sports and Faux News all around the room, the ambiance is not better. The tables are nicer, I'll give them that. But not $20 nicer. Oh yeah, and they're out of kid menus so they've got crappy 3-hole punched paper photo copies... she made a big deal out of apologizing about this but it didn't set a good tone. Kids don't care as long as they can color on something, really, so why the big fuss? The hostess station always has three to five people buzzing around... you know what? Teach some of those people how to wash dishes (my knife was filthy) or to cook, and reduce the wait times on food coming out of the kitchen. That would improve the experience a great deal. I wanted BJ's to kick Claim Jumper's butt but it is just a whimper better. Cheesecake Factory is MUCH better than this place and somehow does manage to execute on its giant menu.  This place needs to get 10-15% cheaper and then I will give it another star even with the same level of food and service. For now, it's a strong 2.5 stars and that's not enough to move me to spend $70 on a school-night dinner for 3. Sorry."
Renee N.,"Bellevue, WA",131,22,82,5.0,2/22/2016,Great place to come in for happy hour!  Love the selection of food in their menu. Great staff and atmosphere. Can't wait till the warmer weather so I can enjoy their outdoor seating.
Scott B.,"Renton, WA",124,9,,4.0,4/12/2016,"Food and service very good.  Host no so much.  Had to flag down a hostess who was very busy ignoring the front of the house.  When we finally got her attention she was indignant, sat us and we never saw her again.  The server didn't know we had been seated.  We finally  got his attention and he was very efficient, cheerful and even brought another server to help.  Gave our kids some appetizers.  Food was fresh and delicious.  Had we not had to deal with the snooty millennial hostess this would have been a pleasant lunch for the family."
Mary K.,"Seattle, WA",0,18,,2.0,9/2/2016,Terrible service and subpar food.  It was so dark in the restaurant that we could barely read the menu.
Thao N.,"Seattle, WA",1683,441,245,2.0,10/21/2013,"I once knew people that have worked for BJ's, I know a break does not exist in the restaurant industry, but BJ's have their people work like slaves so their only source of food is to take fries right off customer dishes & munch on it as they are walking it out to bring it out to their customer's table. Ever since I found that out, I've never ever order a dish that something could be taken off it without me noticing, that's just sad & unsanitary.  A bunch of coworkers decided this was going to be the spot for lunch & I went with it because the food here is actually somewhat good. I don't think it's worth the price, but whatever it's food. I came when it was pretty newly open so I think it was just a rough start with service. One of my coworker ordered Chicken Alfredo, there was no chicken on it. I asked if the tacos off the lunch menu were going to fill me up because otherwise, I would have gotten another plate & the server told me it's big. It came out & I was quite disappointed at how tiny the tortilla was, I think Taco Bell's soft taco are even bigger.  One good thing I will say is that I will die for BJ's pizookie dessert. It's a warm, soft giant cookie that you can choose up to 2 flavors in a pan & is top with vanilla ice cream. If it's your birthday, you happen to be lucky & could get a complimentary small pizookie!"
Arturo V.,"Redmond, WA",141,23,21,5.0,5/2/2013,"My wife and I just came back from our first visit to BJ's . . . this was a mock service with a pre-defined menu.  We brought our five-year-old son, and we were promptly seated after checking-in for our reservation.  Obviously the place is brand-new, but it's obvious the decor is upscale, yet it remains quite comfortable and pleasant.  (Reminds me of the Yardhouse).   We ordered a chocolate milk for our son, and the thing was actually pretty large, and the chocolate was mixed-in by hand.  Looked delicious!  My wife and I ordered a porter and a stout (we prefer the darkest beers available) and both were excellent.  BJ's brews their own ales, and everything is distributed from their brewery in Reno.  There are nearly two dozen guest taps, and the handles told the story . . . beyond their own great brews, I saw:  Rogue Dead Guy, Iron Horse Irish Death, Guiness, and a host of other brews comprising a very impressive lineup for any beer connoisseur.  The bar is laid-out well, and the 100"" plasma with backlit liquor walls flanking it makes a great focal point for the informal area. Our appetizer was the Ahi Poke.  The Ahi was well-prepared, and the sauce was tangy, as expected.  Presentation was excellent.  Our entrees were a calzone and the Chicken Ala Fresco.  Both dishes were lighter than expected, and were packed with flavor.  The calzone crust was flaky and the marinara was tangy.  The chicken dish was fresh with a grilled chicken breast on a bed of rice pilaf . . . accompanied by zucchini, tomatoes and mushrooms.  Our son had the mini corndogs with smiley fries, and it was all very tasty! We for sure plan to return after the grand opening to try out more from the menu, but so far our impression is great!  Our server, Josiah, was very attentive and friendly.  Everyone should definitely head out to try BJ's!"
