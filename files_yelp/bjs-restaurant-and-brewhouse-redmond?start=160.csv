Sarah M.,"Issaquah, WA",260,1036,,3.0,7/23/2013,"We came here for dessert and went to the bar because for some reason, this place was really crowded on a Monday night at 8 pm. It wasn't happy hour, it wasn't a weekend, I still can't figure out why it was so crowded...but it was filled with Microsofties so that might have something to do with it.  Anyway, no problems with the service but nothing memorable. The server didn't scoff to our faces when we said that we were only ordering 2 desserts and splitting one...she probably did behind our backs but at least that was appreciated. One thing that I noticed about this place was that the menu was HUGE - very comparable to the menu at the Cheesecake Factory.  Anyway, we had the pizookies (sp?) which are warmed chocolate chip cookies in a mini pan with ice cream on top. These were really good. I'd come here just for these...and I'd come back to try the beer...but the food looks just OK.  I'm giving this place 3 stars though because everything felt sticky. I HATE sticky seats. We asked them to clean the seats off...and they were still sticky."
Brittni V.,"Woodinville, WA",69,22,,1.0,1/16/2016,TERRIBLE!!  The hosts seemed to hate their jobs. The server was very timid and did not know much about the menu. We ordered guacamole and it's was brown...Pure brown. Ordered a new batch and it was still brown. Ordered our food and everything came out wrong and my brother's salad took and extra 15 minutes to come out. The corrections for our food took about 30 minutes. Overall it was terrible!  We will never go back to this place.
Schantel T.,"Redmond, WA",0,15,,1.0,6/5/2016,Food is okay. Service is TERRIBLE. Just sat for 15 mins without even seeing the server and it was empty inside and we had to wait 5 mins to even be seated when there was no one inside. Worst customer service in Redmond and Bellevue. They need to fix it. It's been like this since they opened years ago.
Andrea P.,"San Leandro, CA",131,33,,2.0,4/16/2015,"Always been a fan of bj's, but for some reason the food I got was just unbearable! I've always known bj's to be very yummy in their burger/deep dish pizza/ sandwich category along with their brews, and after the meal I had there I now know I should have just stuck to what I know! Big disappointment!  I was craving a baked potato chicken and veggies. I ordered their thyme lime chicken something came with rice and Brussels sprouts (which I loooove) so I ended up substituting just the rice for the potato! When My food came the potato just looked SAD! It was suppose to have butter sourcream and chives....ummm the potato came alone and the side dish was full of butter with the smallest dollop of SC! Can you say clogged arteries? Lol ugh. And where was the chives? As I was putting together my potato I took a bite and all I could taste was FREEZER BURNT! Do you freeze your potatoes??! Gross! I literally doused it in salt and pepper and i still couldn't get the taste out with every bite I took! ITS REALLY HARD TO MESS UP A BAKED POTATO! Bj's you won that award!  The Brussels sprouts were ehhh, I can make better. And the only good thing about my meal was the chicken! That actually had good seasoning, juicy, and flavorful. (2stars for that) Other than that I'll give you guys another shot at the food that I know is yummy, (deep dish, burgers etc. ) and if that still fails....sorry but you lost me there!"
Amy N.,"Redmond, WA",154,17,,1.0,8/31/2015,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Literally everything in this restaurant is awful! The only saving grace is the fact that it's brand new and the bathrooms are cool. Not what should be the highlight of your dining experience. I dunno desert fire was pretty awful so maybe it's just a curse of the building/location. I would never ever go to this restaurant again. So host was pushing the bar area (which kids can sit in) which was either her job or she was too lazy to seat the dining room. Honestly probably the later. There was only 1 server and probably 8-9 tables in the cocktail area. She was a mediocre server and was getting her butt kicked with no help. Took 20 mins to just get going, menus, drinks, food order... Then starts the real waiting, and I now have a lot of time to make observations... Guy and a girl flirting in the dining room, several people going out to smoke, I counted at least 3 managers, saw 4 cooks come in and I can tell it's clearly shift exchange, but jeez no one is actually working in this restaurant. 30 mins and our food finally comes out. It's acceptable but nothing to write home about. Until my nephew goes to eat his burger and it's burnt. Server tries to tell us it's just charbroiled, I've cooked burgers for a restaurant before... It was burnt, pretty bad and inedible. Replacement takes 25 mins to come out!!!! Now with all of the staff around doing nothing, bad server getting her butt kicked, lazy host, managers doing nothing I'm about to lose it, there was no reason for us to be there for as long as we were.... But my nephew wants a pizookie and those take a long time to cook. 15-20 mins they tell us... Took 45 mins. We are now being served by another server who took over that girls section. He's apologizing, but he just got here it wasn't his fault and he can tell I'm upset so he sends the manager over. Who apologized, but it wasn't genuine, took a couple items off the bill and walked away. We were in this restaurant for over 2 hours on a slow holiday weekend, with a zillion staff in the building and I have never had this bad of service in my life. I will never ever come back to this location and likely will avoid all BJs in the future. I've always had an underwhelming time... Constantly out of food items, poor service, signature beers... The beers are brewed right there!!! And you're out if at least 4 every time I've tried to order one. Do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant or allow 3 hours for a poor quality dining experience."
Steven J.,"Sammamish, WA",0,43,3,4.0,4/14/2015,***Update*** Operational problems seem to have been addressed.  Both food & Drink are good quality.  Very good venue for sports viewing.
Jaclyn W.,"Athol, ID",0,16,7,1.0,7/29/2016,"Came for dinner to have a kale roasted Brussels sprout salad. First time they brought the salad out the brussel sprouts were raw and served in huge, hard chunks. Second time the brussel sprouts were barely cooked through just scalded on the outside and still extremely hard, zero dressing or goat cheese. I've had this salad before but am shocked at their lack of quality control. Hire a new chef and expediter - consistency is the only reason people go to chain restaurants and this BJ's lacks it entirely."
Karen L.,"Seattle, WA",296,904,341,3.0,3/16/2014,"BJ's isn't quite as good as I remembered. There's a BJ's near my university and we used to love going there, but I suppose the main reason I love this place is their pizookies. Came here with my BF and a friend, and we shared the appetizer platter, ahi poke, and a full rack of ribs. The food was good for the most part, although it wasn't amazing or anything. We also had the pizookie trio for dessert, and we chose the salted caramel, chocolate chunk, and oreo pizookies. My favorite was the chocolate chunk--nothing beats a warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. For old memories sake, we may return (for the pizookies)."
Peter B.,"Sammamish, WA",0,13,,4.0,9/28/2016,"Good food with polite, pleasant, professional wait staff.  Love the variety to their menu.  Order your deep dish pizza with extra sauce!"
Lehua P.,"Kent, WA",2,21,58,1.0,8/2/2016,"It was a Sunday afternoon and we knew it was going to busy.  The wait time was about 10-20 minutes for four of us, including a one year old.  The front desk staff was very polite and advised of this as they took our information.  It was about 20 minutes before we were called, perfect because we were starving.  We got to our booth and asked for a high chair, no problem said the young man.  However high chair never came.  After about five minutes I decided to stop a staff member and ask for one.  Finally got that high chair situated, now about 15 minutes in and still no server.  The decision to leave weighed in but we were all starving and had a one year old to feed.  Finally waived someone down again and got a nice young lady who was very apologetic and took our order.  Things went a little smoothly after that and she was very cheerful and knowledgeable with her menu.  We did have to ask for utensils and napkins from another server though.  We have been the BJ's in southcenter several times and never had such an experience so, I am not sure if it was just a bad day for that restaurant or they are just horrible at customer service?:-(  But, we will never go back to that one."
Ron N.,"Kirkland, WA",0,7,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Don't go unless you like cold pizza and chicken alfredo with the pasta burnt and stiff (they tried twice on that dish).  When we asked our waiter to have their manager, Kelli (sp) to come over after the 2nd try on the chicken alfredo, she was not professional at all and lacked common business courtesies. Why did the Claim Jumper close as we went there only to find that they had closed and opted to go next door the above---BJ = BAD JOB !!"
Shane M.,"Lynnwood, WA",20,297,39,3.0,11/17/2014,"There is a lot going on here.  It's a corporate sports bar.  Lots of beers.  Lots of TVs.  Big menu. Crowded.  The servers all seem to have graduated from the Red Robin School of Servers.  They are fine - but a little heavy on the upsell.  I hate the upsell.  They probably do, too.  It's corporate dining - so you get what you would expect.  Avocado rolls are good.  Burgers are fine.  Dinner salads?  You might starve to death and they aren't cheap.  If you are in the mood for a beer and a burger with your buddies - you could do worse than this place."
Karen Y.,"Seattle, WA",6,46,1,1.0,8/5/2014,"The 3 times I have been here have been  - bad, terrible and poor and here are the reasons why. If you have to wait over an hour for food in a lunch hour only for them to get it wrong that is terrible. If you have to wait 45 mins for your first drinks at 6pm after a hard days work that is bad and poor is when you start helping the manager and the waiter out of the ""we only served 3 people food on your table and the rest have to wait for 30+ minutes"" situation. The waiting staff vary from helpful to useless and the management are unhelpful and generally lost as for the kitchen staff I have no idea but the food when you get it and if you get is average to okay. I assume BJ's lives off the uninformed and the office crowd because otherwise it would go bust!"
Ryan L.,"Bothell, WA",163,1,,1.0,7/7/2014,"I don't do this very often because I often have good dining experiences but this one deserves to be shared... Walked in and was greeted promptly, this was a plus I was expecting. Another party walked in behind us and we were shoveled to the side and told to wait to be say while the host addressed them. Once they were put on hold, she asked for a name for the party (why it matters I don't know) but I have it to her anyways. Then we were corralled around to the other side of the host desk as if this is where the line starts to be sat at a table because where we were standing ( on the dining room side of the desk) wasn't an appropriate place...  When we went to be sat she put us at a small table, half booth half chair. I didn't like it so I asked to have a full booth, and even gave her an option (out of my consideration) to give us a properly sized booth for 2. And she gave me a dirty look and say me at one right next to another party. I admit I was ""that guy"" to ask for the next booth down to get more privacy and she made a scene about it and clarified that she had to tell a server that we were sat where we were. Duhhh it's called hospitality! Once we sat down it took 10 minutes to get a round of waters and another 2 to be greeted by our server who we had overheard making a fuss about the host seating people out of their sections.. Welcome to the hospitality industry.... Needless to say we walked out before the server ever came back to get a beverage order, and that was a total time of 20 minutes at the table!  Get it together bj's...."
Fahim M.,"Redmond, WA",0,6,1,1.0,7/18/2016,Waited over an hour for just a pazookie....the guests i came with are still waiting for the food over 1.5rs after ordering.
Silvia C.,"Seattle, WA",46,20,4,4.0,2/26/2016,"Note: I'm sad to read some of the other reviews bringing this place down so much. BJs has great food and great beers. It's a very averagely yummy sit-down nicer dinner place. Their brunch on weekends is amazing. The prices are a little steeper than I'd like, but make sense for the quality of food. BJs is great for having some drinks and spacing out some food while watching football with friends. But, get there early for Seahawks games -- it fills up and most people stay for the duration!! The bar is very attractive and the TV set up there is awesome. I've never had a problem with service here. Great ambiance, good service, good food, okay prices."
Amanda W.,"Federal Way, WA",0,4,1,1.0,10/17/2015,"If you are looking for takeout or curbside, go ANYWHERE else. We have given them a few chances. Every time the order is wrong, and speaking to management just makes it worse, they blame the mistake on you, even when you provide an itemized receipt of your order. They will offer to remake it, as long as you pay for it again and they are very rude and dismissive. Don't waste your time, or money here!"
Sarah S.,"Clarence Center, NY",58,414,385,4.0,8/10/2013,"A good review for BJ's?  Seriously, yes!   I hadn't come here since this place opened a few months ago because every time I saw it on Yelp, people were unhappy.  On a whim of being super hungry at 2:30pm in the afternoon, my husband and I came and ate and were very satisfied!  We got seated right away, got drinks right away and the waitress was lovely and gave me plenty of time to look over the menu.  My husband had two of their beers, he REALLY liked those.  The one he liked the most was the ""nutty Brunette"" or something to that effect. I started with a $2.95 mini caprese salad... it was delicious!  I then had the french dip sandwich, again... delicious.  It has real roast beef on it and not Steak-ums type beef, which I appreciate.  I had the large, steak fries with the sandwich, those were okay.  But over all very happy with sandwich and caprese salad.  My husband had a calzone, which he thought was sorta small but still yummy.  He was impressed with the massive beer selection.  I'm currently pregnant, so I was unable to enjoy any of their impressive booze list of drinks.  My pink lemonade was good and refilled often though.  I wish I had room for dessert, that cookie with the ice cream looked sooooo good!  Next time!   I had no problems with service, our waitress was present and came to check on us often.  But we did eat at an off-peak time, 2:30pm is neither prime time for lunch or dinner.  If I was looking for something to complain about, about all I have is that the restaurant is huge but the women's restroom only has 4 stalls... so expect to wait, even at off peak times.  But c'mon!  That was the worst thing that happened for me, I had to wait 2 minutes to pee.  Will return, liked this place!"
Paul M.,"Auburn, WA",38,7,2,1.0,9/16/2015,"Been here a couple time had great service after tonight not sure if I will be coming back ordered the BJ's favorite pizza came out as bread and toppings little to no sauce and very little cheese half of which was not melted. Called the waitress over to send it back, after attempting to pull the ""bread"" out and toppings going every where, with three slices out of the pan she looks at me dumb founded and asks if I would like them to just throw some more cheese on top and send it back through the oven for a second cooking or just make a new one. I sarcastically said sure let me just reassemble the pizza and toppings really quick she looked at me like it was guidance from god. After having to explain to her that no I would not like that she finally figured out that she should trash this pizza and have another one made. Drinks came out slow and so did the first and second pizza. Unreal. Oh and ad to it now that I finally got my pizza. She has the audacity to cop an attitude with me and my wife saying snappily "" is there anything else I can get for you"" then placed the plates on the table rather hard and left. More to follow I'm sure. Yup sure was right! They resumed the pan our original pizza was in so now I have a nice crust on my crust of brunt shit. Wife is talking with management so we shall see what happens next. So Kelsey is the waitress just so you all know and that's manager is Steven. So the rest of the time we were there we keep getting mean mugged by Kelsey the manager seemed to careless about jack squat or otherwise but did manage to wave his magic wand an make the bill disappear. Unreal! Definitely not coming back here. But wait there is more! The desert they comped us came out burn!! Are you serious right now!!"
Nina T.,"Kirkland, WA",84,290,416,1.0,6/18/2014,"I've been here a few times. Food is average to mediocre. On a weekend evening, the place was packed and service ended up taking a ridiculously long time. We had been there well over an hour before our food arrived. We had ordered appetizers in the hopes of having something to eat sooner, but everything came out at the same time. Then 1-2 days later, all three of us ended up pretty sick with gastrointestinal symptoms. Maybe it's just coincidence, but this was the only place we all ate at together, and we're certainly not going back."
