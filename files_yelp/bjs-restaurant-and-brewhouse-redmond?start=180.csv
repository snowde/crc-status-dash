Christina H.,"Everett, WA",6,13,6,4.0,2/13/2015,"Definately great service! Went here for an early valentines day date and our waiter was very easy to talk to and doesn't keeps us waiting at all! I used to go to the southcenter location when I once lived near that area but this place was definitely a better service! Usually for these kind of restaurants, I'd usually wait about 30 minutes after I order but not here! Food wise was decent but the pizookie made up my meal. I was also given a coupon for a free pizookie so of course I will be returning to eat here again with or without the coupon!"
Jennifer D.,"Redmond, WA",230,5,,1.0,11/29/2015,"I've been here a few times, and unfortunately each time was the same with extremely slow and unprofessional service. Each server I had during all of my visits were not educated on what it meant to be gluten-free which I would think is a huge thing to know if you're going to work in the food and beverage industry. I had to explain that corn tortillas are gluten free and that hard cider was also gluten-free. My husband and I came for happy hour once and never got water (we got our appetizer before our drinks which took 20+ minutes to even get noticed). I hate to be negative, but I won't be coming back here. It's a huge bummer because the food wasn't terrible, but the service is a deal breaker."
Maryam R.,"Bellevue, WA",86,237,61,2.0,10/27/2015,"I ordered to go, mac and cheese was gross. Whatever my friends ordered, also said theirs was gross. Overly priced, not so great food. Probably will never come back here.."
Dean Y.,"Redmond, WA",0,154,1,3.0,9/16/2014,"We've been to this BJ's several times (always lunch) and found the food to be tasty and reasonably priced. The beers are what you'd expect from a chain - decent, but nothing stands out. Today we experienced the slooow service other reviewers have complained about. My other gripe is their so-called wedge salad. Where other restaurants may cut a head of lettuce into a wedge, BJ's seems to think that placing two iceberg lettuce leaves upside down on a plate qualifies. Really?!?"
Annabel L.,"Redmond, WA",0,5,,2.0,6/24/2016,The food was very disappointing and not worth the long wait AT ALL. We left hungry and annoyed :/
Patrice M.,"Redmond, WA",0,6,1,1.0,8/6/2014,"Eating there for the first time tonight. The burger is terrible, dry and tasteless, the French fries average. Didn't even order a dessert. First and last time there. EDIT: my colleagues dragged me into this place again today, which gave me the opportunity to confirm my first impression. This time the meat was soo cooked that a 1mm ""charcoal"" layer had formed on the bottom. Being French, I have some expectations when it comes to cooking and this place is below anything. Better off with The Cheesecake Factory or Red Robin."
Justin L.,"Bellevue, WA",0,51,1,2.0,3/9/2016,Food was just ok.. nothing very great and the beer was not cold. the only reason for the 2 stars is that we had a good waiter.
Alex B.,"Kirkland, WA",1,9,,1.0,6/24/2016,"I've had better quality food from my own microwave at home. I ordered some boneless wings and a gluten free pizza. The boneless wings were soggy and Luke warm. I'm not kidding you, they tasted and felt exactly like frozen food from a grocery that had been microwaved. The pizza was gross. It tasted like a frozen pizza that had been thrown under a broiler for a few moments. The cheese didn't taste like or feel like real cheese, and the sauce was gross and chemically tasting. It was all super generic tasting. I've had better food at Denny's! Everyones meal looked mediocre and just BLAH. The server was very nice and prompt, no complains there. The food was just awful though. I didn't even eat much of it and they took it off my bill. Will not ever return to BJs b"
C. S.,"Poulsbo, WA",1,67,2,1.0,11/7/2015,"We have not been to a BJs in about 10 years.  My son wanted to go for lunch, so I gave it a try.  Beer was good.  Hoppy something or other.  Service was passable. It all went downhill from there.   First, my sons pizza was so salty, he felt sick afterwards.  He can eat a lot for an 8 year old and he didn't want to eat half of a kids pizza. My burger was just meat and grease and lacked any sort of balance.  Over salted.  I skipped dinner because I didn't feel right. I now know why we don't go to BJs...the food is terrible and incredibly unhealthy.  PLEASE...don't take your kids there."
Taylor W.,"Redmond, WA",34,62,4,3.0,1/7/2015,"I have eaten at BJ's Brewhouse several times when I lived in LA and I was so excited to eat at the South Center Mall location when that opened years ago. South Centers location was awesome btw. Anyway, I got really excited to hear that a location was being added to the Eastside where I live. I've gone to the Redmond BJ's location at least 5 times. 3 of those 5 where with large parties of 8+ people. I can say that the food is still great but the service is very hit and miss, especially when you have a larger party. It totally depends on the server you have honestly. One of the times I was there with a large party, my friend waited for his drink order for 30 minutes (after everyone else got their drinks), he reminded the serve twice, and when he received his drink, it was the wrong drink. And on top of it they messed up his food order. He just had bad luck I guess, because everyone else's orders were correct though it did take a while to get our food. Regardless of that one instance, my experience with BJ's has been ok overall. I love the food enough to keep going back and I love that they offer Gluten Free options."
Andrew A.,"Monroe, WA",1,17,7,1.0,5/24/2014,"My wife and I have gone here three times, and every time has been a disaster. Their main problem, customer service.  1st time. The hostess was do rude to us. Took an hour to get food. The tables seated after us got food before us.  2nd time. The hostess at the front was so rude, same girl in the first visit.  3rd time. Server was slow and messed up our order twice! Gave us the bill with no comps! Got a manger to finally comp one meal and dessert.  We have given up on BJ's. The food and drinks aren't bad. But I can get the same thing at claim jumper or red robin, with 10x better service."
Holly B.,"Puyallup, WA",108,6,,1.0,4/7/2016,"I'm not exactly sure how I should start the review because there were so many things wrong with our experience here. Now I know that a party of 18 with no reservation is a bit much and for that we know its hard and we understood waiting for our table and waiting for our food. That being said we had two servers and the one server, who seemed to be in training was doing a great job wanted to take our entire order drinks and all and me being a server for 8+ years thought that was a smart efficient way of doing it. The other seasoned serve did not and it cost us at least 15 minutes. The seasoned server who I wish I had gotten her name was very snotty and rude and interrupted everyone during their order choices. She also made a comment about writing her own tip on our receipts. It was in poor taste and she was very rude about it. One of the gentleman who attended lunch with us did not get his food until after our entire party left. They took the meal off the check which is nice but the server never acknowledged him without his food and then told us we had everything when we clearly didn't. It was just a terrible experience and its rather sad because I will not be back."
Annie Y.,"Kirkland, WA",138,155,871,3.0,10/18/2013,Service is decent and the food is okay too. It's one of the very few late night options in Redmond besides Matador. I do like their small sized appetizers. Pizza is good too if you're in the mood for deep dish. Average but consistent.
Sue G.,"Issaquah, WA",20,6,,1.0,5/19/2016,There was no light for us yo read the menu. Asked to be moved and was moved closer to the door. Still not enough light to read the menu. The print is so small even with a magnifier it was hard to read. Too noisy. Will not return. Friendly server. Menu was so dirty I was afraid to touch it.
Ash V.,"Bellevue, WA",0,3,,4.0,7/30/2016,"A cool place be it with your friends or with family. Staff is very nice and always give a warm welcome. Avocado egg roll , pizooki trio are my favorite. Also try the happy hour on the outside on a warm day."
Selina H.,"Corvallis, OR",0,4,,2.0,6/3/2016,"Most mediocre $90 for three (with tax and tip) that I've dropped in a long time, and poor service to boot. Yes, we ordered 4 beers, but it also took nearly an hour to get a $16 pizza that served one. Beer is ok, you can find better."
Yekta A.,"Bellevue, WA",120,617,5,5.0,4/14/2014,"I've always been a fan of BJ's Restaurant but now that they offer gluten free pizza I'm even more of a fan.  Order the gluten free pizza and don't get cheese on it and its dairy free & gluten free...wooot woot! The one thing, don't order the bruschetta because it's basically 4 small bread squares with small (tiny) drops of 2 diced tomatoes and tons of cheese, so it's not great or authentic! Boooo!!!!!"
DAVID L.,"Seattle, WA",77,364,5,3.0,8/27/2013,"Occasion:  Dinner Wait wasn't to bad.  This area definitely needed another chain restaurant, but there's nothing special about this place other than everything is brand new.  Menu was your typical hard core American food (ie. burgers, pizza, etc.)  Our server was relatively new (to working), so she forgot a few things (eg.  I asked for water with no ice, so naturally she brings water with ice.  I asked for check, she acknowledges, then she comes back 10 min later and asks if we want dessert?  Then asks if we want our check.)   My wife and I will come back, we just don't know when."
Donovan T.,"Kirkland, WA",8,34,2,5.0,8/28/2014,"My friends and I have been here numerous times since they've opened and everyone agrees, we love BJ's. The food is very well done for the most part. Pizza's are outstanding, and the 'en-lightened' entrees are very impressive. Particularly the Cherry Chipotle salmon (YUM!) I've tried the enlightened chicken and the other salmon dish and all were very good. The crusted chicken is also quite delicious, but a bit buttery. One of this most impressive items is their bone-in NY Steak, which was one of the best steak's I've eaten out (including the usual big chains, Ruths, Daniels, etc.) and for $23 with 2 sides, it's an unbeatable deal! The beer selection and cool atmosphere round out a great dining experience. Love the HUGE TV that they can put 4 shows on at once. Great place, will keep coming back. Miss Skip the bartender, but Josiah and everyone else are great too! A word to the wise, this place gets BUSY. I'm usually able to find seating in the bar (not sure what Girl D's pissy issue is with bars, but theirs is open and friendly) If you want to sit right down in a quiet, empty restaurant, the Claim Jumper next door is for you. That place is always dead. Even when there's a line at BJ's. Which, in my opinion, speaks for itself."
Teresa S.,"Renton, WA",47,2,,4.0,1/22/2016,"Had a wonderful time, great service and the good was good too!  Our server Joshua was awesome!  And everyone working had smiles and were very helpful."
