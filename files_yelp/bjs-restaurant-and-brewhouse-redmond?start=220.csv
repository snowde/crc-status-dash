Wild C.,"Tacoma, WA",0,14,,3.0,2/23/2014,"Took over an hour to get our pizza, apparently they accidentally skipped our order. Waitress was mediocre (and I'm being nice) and they forgot sauce for the avocado eggrolls and never noticed. So why 3 stars? Because the manager had the intestinal fortitude to admit the mistake and apologize before we asked where the pizza was. Further, he came back before we left to apologize again and let us know the pizza had been dropped from our bill. Long story short, less than stellar performance that was saved by a good manager. BJs better hold on to him!"
Brenda S.,"Issaquah, WA",3,17,,1.0,7/19/2015,"Terrible service, first mistake was trying it a second time. Both times the service was bad. The second time we finally had to walk out. It was 2 in the afternoon, we couldn't even get our table cleaned or get a glass of water.  The staff did seem to be having a good time."
Greta S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",44,26,40,5.0,2/14/2015,"Last visit on my birthday was a horrendous train wreck!!! Omg but I love the deep dish pizza so much I still came back. Here today for Valentine's day and Robert S. was frickin amazing! Totally in tune with our needs, consistently following up with us despite being SLAMMED! Thanks for changing my impression of the place Robert! Hope they keep you around and take care of you here! If not, hit me up and I'll hire you for my district! Yeah fellow Californian, yeah! Not bad for your first day on the floor eh??? See you next time!"
Shannon C.,"Leavenworth, WA",11,4,,1.0,12/16/2013,"I really wish I'd read the other reviews before even stepping foot into the restaurant as my coworker and I would have gone somewhere else if we had read the other reviews first. We arrived around noon on a Monday for a ""quick"" work lunch - just two of us.  At first, everything seemed fine.  Our waiter started off promptly asking us if we were ready to order or if we needed more time.  We had been chatting and hadn't looked at the menu but mentioned we knew we wanted the spinach and artichoke dip to start.  The dip quickly arrived, delivered by someone other than our waiter.  At this time we had also made our entree decisions and were ready to order but no sign of our waiter for several minutes.  Finally he returned.  I ordered my burger no pickles.   We then waited for close to 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  When it finally did, everything was cold and there were pickles on my burger.  I really don't like sending food back unless there's a major issue - I've seen/heard too many stories about doing so.  Instead I picked the pickles off of my burger and we both kept an eye out for our server in the hopes of requesting some hot fries to go with the cold burgers we were already eating.  Several minutes later we were finally able to flag him down.  He got really concerned and seemed confused when we requested hot fries having not touched those on our plates but said he would take care of it. Another 10 minutes or so passed while we finished eating but still no sign of the hot fries.  Our server stopped by the table again, was surprised to see we hadn't gotten the said fries and told us he would go get those for us right away.  We waited a bit longer.  We really wanted some tasty, hot fries!  Sadly, they still didn't show up and neither had our waiter or anyone else with a check.   We stood by the table for a few minutes in the hopes that someone would see we were ready to go.  It would have been amazingly easy to dine and dash since no one seemed to care and man was I tempted to do so for the first time in my life!  Finally our flustered waiter realized we were ready to leave and was kind enough to split the bill 50/50 for us.  That was the highlight of our lunch experience.   There were only two of us.  It wasn't a large group or a complicated order.  For lunch time on a Monday we should have been able to get in and out in less than an hour but by the time we walked disappointed back to the car, more than an hour and a half had passed since we had parked. Since the bad reviews seem to go on for months for this location I can only assume BJ's management doesn't care that they are falling extremely short of so many people's expectations.  There are so many other great places to eat in Redmond don't bother wasting your time or money on this one!  Shoot, check out a mediocre restaurant in the area and you will STILL leave happier than eating at Redmond BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse."
Stan C.,"Sammamish, WA",0,36,29,3.0,10/11/2015,Typical bar food with a large pizza selection. Lots of beer on tap. Big screen TVs all over the place.
Allie S.,"Bellevue, WA",388,447,36,4.0,11/23/2013,"I guess I lucked out, because our server, Jeff, was really awesome. Hooray. My boyfriend and I eat a fairly low carb diet, which often means a cubic buttload of alterations when we go out to eat. He'd never been to a BJ's before, so we stopped in here for lunch. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip (with veggies instead of tortilla chips) and a fried jalapeno burger (sub buffalo patty, jalapenos pickled, not fried) and a side salad instead of fries. Yes, we kind of bastardized the default menu. But Jeff made it happen and everything came out in a timely (and delicious) manner. As we're rarely out in Redmond Town Center, there's no guarantee we'll be back soon, but BJ's was a pretty solid late-lunch option and they had no qualms about customizing the food to ensure we got what we wanted.  Overall, it's a four star experience... based on today's service, it'd be five if they weren't so expensive!"
John B.,"Kirkland, WA",2,5,,4.0,5/7/2015,It is absurd that they don't allow video streaming at their establishments. I didn't get this socially awkward by actually having conversation with the people that invited me out to dinner. Is it too much to ask for me to be able to watch laughing sheep videos at YOUR restaurant utilizing YOUR internet service?!?!  Right Eric?!?!?
Jim F.,"Redmond, WA",13,21,,2.0,10/11/2016,"Ordered top sirloin, asparagus baked potato and house salad. Drinks and salads came out in a reasonable time but the meal took a long time to get to our table. The wife and I were very hungry and were ready to dive in but my asparagus was dried out and very limp looking like it sat under a heat lamp for an hour or more. My wife's steak wasn't cooked right and she couldn't cut it. The manager ? ordered us new steaks and asparagus for me but we had already waited a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen so we ate our potatoes and I ate my steak but we had waited so long it was a disappointing meal. When we got our new steaks my wife's was worse than the first as this one was all gristle and difficult to cut to get a decent piece of steak. My steak was ok and the second order of asparagus was good but we won't be back as the food takes way to long to come out of the kitchen. The food is mediocre so don't waste your time and money BJ's."
Jake R.,"Kirkland, WA",493,171,102,3.0,11/4/2013,"It is what it is, a big chain restaurant and it's A-OK. Came here on a Friday night with a couple friends and had a good time. We sat in the bar and we were approached quickly by our waiter. He was a nice guy and definitely helped make the experience a positive one.  My friends had already had some oysters at Matt's across the parking lot, so they weren't as hungry as I was so we just ordered some appetizers. My buddy's girlfriend has recently found out she has a gluten allergy so she wasn't impressed with the menu but I thought they had a great selection, my only gripe was them not having jalapeno poppers, which I love but I'll get into that later. Anyways, my buddy and I ordered some chicken wings with ""Hot and Spicy Buffalo"" and ""Maui Sweet Teriyaki Glaze"" the Maui was the best and my recommendation if you get wings. We also had some spinach stuffed mushrooms that were ok and some chicken wontons that were ""Thai style"" and decent. I also had the house pumpkin beer and it was actually pretty good. I should note that since my buddy's girlfriend was eating gluten free we inquired about gluten free options and the server got a gluten free menu, which was pretty nice. The only problem with the gluten free options is that they are regular items on the menu that they just omit the gluten part of the recipe. We found out the ""hard way"" why this could be a problem. When the soup that was ordered came ou it had the croutons in it that were certainly not ""gluten free"" but they were easy enough to pick out. One last thing, and this is worth noting because it's so rare these days to actually get good customer service. As I mentioned above, I was a little bummed they didn't have my favorite app, jalapeno poppers, but they did have deep fried jalapeno slices on one of their burgers so I decided to get creative. I asked the server if I could just order a side of the breaded and fried jalapeno slices, since they didn't have jalapeno poppers. The server happily said that was ok and even suggested that I get it with the same dipping sauce they serve with the Crispy Fried Artichokes, which I thought was a great idea and did. The jalapeno slices were nice and hot and went well with the dipping sauce, you might try it if you are so inclined and you're welcome in advance. All in all it was a decent night out, ok food and drinks, but the customer service was really what shined here. I forget the servers name, I'm horrible about remembering names but he did have one of those old time mustaches that are curled up, so you can't miss him. Hopefully he's your server because he actually knows what customer service is all about!"
Rishika M.,"Redmond, WA",0,4,,1.0,3/16/2016,A typical Large size Pizza restaurant and brew house. Nothing special. Unnecessary salted food. Poor in service!!!
Sven G.,"Everett, WA",2,7,1,1.0,2/6/2015,Service totally blows. Food amazing. Drinks great. but the waiters were so bad. No refills. Bill late. And had to ask other waiters for assisted.
Girl D.,"Snohomish, WA",11,111,4,2.0,8/19/2014,"I've eaten at other BJ's Restaurants, such as the ones in the Southcenter and Tacoma Malls.  And I've usually had good experiences, and felt I'd go back. The Redmond joint could use some work. Let's start with the one thing you Never.  Ever.  EVER.  do to the Single Girl Diner:  seat her in the bar, without even asking her, just because she's an unaccompanied female.  ""Is this the bar?"" I asked frostily, as the hostess directed me straight to a table in the nearly-empty bar without even gauging my preferences first.  ""Yes, this is our cocktail area,"" she said.  ""I would prefer not to sit in the bar.""  And you should have asked me if I'd be all right sitting in the bar, but you didn't.  FAIL. In the regular dining room, I joined a few other couples, who'd presumably either not been directed to the bar at all, or had opted not to sit in the bar.  So I have to wonder why the hostess would think the bar a suitable default, when none of these other parties wanted it.  Seriously, I think sometimes restaurant employees believe, latently or not, that when you're an unaccompanied woman, and you walk into their restaurant, they have to find a place to hide you.  Heaven forbid our restaurant is seen as a place where women come to dine alone!  Gosh, that would be horrible! I ordered a house salad with blue cheese dressing, and an appetizer.  Appetizer was fine; no complaints.  House salad was tiny (they must have sent me a small; it was about half the size of the one I had the last time I dined at BJ's in Southcenter around the holidays).  The salad was also drowned under a minimum half-cup of dressing.  The species of the various leaf types struggled to be recognized under this white mudslide.  A pity, because they seemed fresh and appealing, once I pulled them free and let them drip-dry for a bit.  I guess I need to order the dressing on the side, if I ever go back."
Bret D.,"Kirkland, WA",1,10,2,2.0,9/17/2013,"A few things to note: 1. The hostess looked toward a quarter full dining area and asked how many would be in our party. I replied with 2, and she proceeded to tell us if we sat at the bar, there wouldn't be a wait. Not sure why a mostly empty dining room requires a wait, but I'm pretty sure monday at 1pm must be a hectic time for such an empty restaurant. 2. Our self proclaimed ""Beer Expert"" was of great help when he proceeded to tell my girlfriend that every beer she was thinking of ordering was a bad choice. I would really like to personally thank him for finally telling her what she should order since her opinion doesn't matter when it comes to what she is going to drink.  3. Found a hair in a sandwich we ordered. Enough said... I don't eat my own hair, and I only eat others when I'm real desperate. 4. One waiter in the bar, and several employees standing around talking. This is likely why our service was so poor, I just wish the manager would have been trained to notice things like this. I have had food from two of the Bay area locations and been happily surprised both times. I think I'll be waiting for my next trip to try a BJ's again."
Preston K.,"Bellevue, WA",30,10,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Service and beer wasn't too bad. However, the food was absolutely disgusting! I got the mini deep dish bj special and my wife got the chicken club sandwich and both were terrible. They would be better off serving frozen pizza from the grocery store. The sandwich had wilted lettuce and soggy bread. The only thing I'd suggest getting from this place is your tab. Stay far away!!"
MaryMargaret K.,"Redmond, WA",131,9,12,1.0,9/30/2015,"I have always loved BJ's Brewhouse. The cheddar broccoli soup is great, the chicken tenders, the kids meals, and that hand crafted rootbeer....  BUT, the BJ's in Redmond is awful. My first experience, the wait staff was very unorganized. Food was cold, orders took way too long, drinks were not refilled, etc. I thought maybe it was just opening week. So we tried again.  This time, my kids food never showed up, my order was incorrect with cheese all over my pasta (I have a dairy allergy that was noted). There was no sort of compromise or anything that we got.  The next time, I thought, the third time is a charm. A group of 6 of us went on a Tuesday 5pm. It was not very busy, we sat right away, but no server ever came. We waited 10 more minutes, watched others around us be seated and served water. Waiters waked by, but no one ever stopped. We finally got up and walked out. I mentioned something to the manager, who gave us a $50 credit. It was until I went to use that credit, that I will never return.  Yesterday my nanny and I went to use the credit, and I was served my favorite rootbeer in a mug that was cracked, chipped and more importantly cut my lip. I asked for the manager, and he didn't seem to care that I got cut. He asked if I was ok, asked if I wanted to call anyone, and gave me another one. We received awful service, as my daughters pizza was burned, they charged us for items without notifying us of the charge, and after all that, paid full price for everything.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND BJ's in REDMOND."
Chris G.,"Kirkland, WA",0,12,,1.0,2/2/2015,"There seating system is awful. They have a pleasant hostess,  buzzer and empty seats but still couldn't get seated. Girl manager (shift??) wasn't doing well handling whatever stress there was. Went next door to Claim Jumper."
Pone C.,"Redmond, WA",144,51,,3.0,9/23/2014,"Decent place, menu is too big. Lunch menu is great. Service is terrible. Again, terrible.  Would give this one star for their service but Kristi Will, the manager there, is awesome.  She rights every wrong. She's a five star."
Danielle D.,"Auburn, WA",13,65,9,4.0,1/5/2015,"On New Years Eve, this location was thankfully quiet and calm. We had a very attentive waiter. A rare find on usually busy nights. My husband ordered the corn fritters and cheddar broccoli soup to start. Im not typically a fan of either, but did give both of them a try and they were good. I particularly liked the sauce for the fritters. It was a great sauce with a kick. Unfortunately my husband was gobbling it up so I was only able to get a small taste. The one thing that stood out the most to me is that I had requested shrimp to be added to my chicken alfredo, and they were generous. Very generous. I appreciate that more than anything. Usually you ask for any type of seafood and get the bare minimum they have to give you, while charging you an arm and a leg. My husband got the shrimp scampi, and I noticed they were also generous with the shrimp on his. As stated above, I appreciate generous portions of proteins. I will return to this location, as they seem to do things right."
Aaron H.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",90,25,,2.0,10/13/2013,"I attend the RTC exotic car show most weekends which takes place in the parking lot next to BJ's.  After being curious about the restaurant and meaning to visit it for some time, we went there last night for dinner. Because it was a Saturday night at prime dinner time, there was a bit of a wait.  The hostess told us 30-40 minutes, I think it was closer to 40.  As we waited, I noticed a few things. First, some significant portion of the people who shy'd away from the wait made their way to Claim Jumper.  I think that means that people see the restaurants as being somewhat comparable to one another.  After eating at BJs, I tend to agree but more on that later. Second, the entrance has three doors.  A rotating door that is flanked by two normal doors.  Kids tended to play in the rotating door and adults tended to come through the side doors.  Both were mildly annoying.  We had a three year old who accidentally ventured near the rotating door and almost got crushed as some kids were running in circles in it.  The doors on the side tended to slam shut when someone would come in or out.  With two doors doing this and tons of people coming in and out you constantly heard a slamming door.   Third, the bar and dining area have a really cool atmosphere.  Dimly lit, cool lighting behind the bar, lots of TVs playing different sports.  It all felt clean, modern, and somewhat cool. Once we got seated, we spent some time perusing the menu.  They had a nice selection of appetizers and entrees.  And an impressive selection of beers.  We selected a seasonal pumpkin ale and a few things off the appetizer and entrée list. The food arrived relatively quickly.  All off it was mediocre at best.   Fish tacos - The corn tortilla was tough, almost as if it was stale.  The fish inside had an overwhelming charred 'grill' flavor but was void of the type of seasoning one would expect on a Mexican inspired fish taco.  There were a couple of sauces on the side, both of which were relatively bland and uninspired.  We love fish tacos and we order them often.  These were some of the worst we've had. Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps - The lettuce was butter lettuce which works really well for wraps.  Each taco only had three shrimp but the shrimp were relatively well seasoned and not overcooked as many restaurants tend to do.  There was a salsa in each lettuce wrap that was OK in flavor but was really watery such that when you took a bite a pool of somewhat flavorless liquid poured out onto the plate.  These were OK but I probably wouldn't order them again. Pizza - Nothing too fancy, just a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  It was pretty good.  Given that roughly 1/3 of their menu was pizzas, it feels like this is something they endeavor to be good at.   In summary, given the atmosphere, beer selection, and televisions I think this would be a good place to go watch a football game with some buddies during which we'd have some drinks and eat an appetizer or two.   I don't think we'll ever go back to just eat dinner as the food just isn't good enough.   Hopefully they improve.  The food in the Texas BJs is much better."
Kelly S.,"Redmond, WA",20,8,,1.0,12/9/2014,"this place is a total f'ing disaster. Service is abysmal. with a capital A. Food it mediocre at best and the beer is warm. its not often that you have to leave your table and go up to the bar to get a drink. Even then, still slow. This is one place I will never come back to,"
