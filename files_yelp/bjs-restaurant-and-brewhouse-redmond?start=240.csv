Steven R.,"Woodinville, WA",2,13,1,5.0,2/14/2015,"I really don't think I was in the same restaurant as other reviewers.  Stopped in for lunch to give it a try despite the bad reviews on Yelp.  Our server Kelly was awesome.  Food was awesome,  drinks were awesome.  My sister had the pulled pork sandwich which was the best tasting pulled pork Ive possibly had outside of the South.  I had the BbQ Chopped salad and it was very fresh and tasty.  My husband had the Black and Blue burger and also thought it was great.  We will definitely be back.   Prices are pretty standard for the venue and area."
Sam C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",39,13,,2.0,8/31/2013,"We have been here over 20 times. Bar service is fantastic. Table seating is horrible. Twice now we have been seated only to wait 15-20 minutes to be greeted or order beverages. Once we even had to approach the hostess stand to see if we had a server. To be fair, the hostesses seem to double and triple seat the servers. The servers are hauling ass to get everything done. But no one is helping anyone. Some servers are strolling about while customers wait to get a drink refill.  Food is mediocre at best, certainly not worth waiting 45 min to order and 20 min to get salt and pepper for. Sad cause we are not going back. Waste of all those premiere member points. This boils down to bad management. Where are managers checking to see that customers aren't upset and waiting to be greeted.  Hey BJ's, walk up the street to Frankie 's Pizza for a lesson in customer service."
Amanda S.,"Seattle, WA",418,192,255,4.0,2/3/2014,"Ate here on a Friday night and the place was really busy. The parking lot is large but gets full quickly somehow! There were 3 cars just circling forever to find a spot.  The wait was not that long and the staff was very cheerful and helpful. Once we sat down we ordered some drinks and our meal. The menu at BJ's is very large. There is a huge variety of stuff but mostly American. My date ordered a salad and I ordered the Mahi Mahi on a bed of fried rice. Our food came out quite fast and the fish was really delicious. I would say the salad was just ok.  The only hiccup we had was that our bartender must not have put any alcohol in our drinks because there was no hint of alcohol at all. After we paid, we explained this to our host. She apologized and insisted on reimbursing us our drinks. Now that is service!"
Shannon H.,"Utah County, UT",16,98,163,2.0,11/29/2013,"Excellent service from Cassandra, thank goodness because that made up for the boring food. Get the corn fritters (spinach dip and mushrooms are bland and taste the same) if you want an appetizer (make sure to get ample aioli in each bite). Pork chops are dry (and only 4 slices of apple, should have at least 6), house sodas are flat and not worth the price/calories, thin or steak-cut (really a jojo like you can get from a grocery deli) fries aren't tasty, burger falls apart and served on toasted bread that gets soggy fast, and the flatbread is floppy with uneven toppings. Second time to a BJ's (first was in Tukwila, Seattle) and last."
Javi S.,"Federal Way, WA",0,9,3,1.0,8/12/2013,"Unfortunately, most of the reviews here are spot on.  And having been to BJ's in Redmond more than once since it opened (not of my own choosing) I have had similar experiences as those noted in other reviews.   My biggest problem with BJ's is their inconsistency.  There are long wait times to get seated, to get drink orders, to get refills and to get your food.  Food never comes out all at the same time.  The food can be hit or miss.  You can order a burger one day and it is great but then come back and order the same thing the next day and it is inedible due to being charred.  Some of the pizzas are good while others are dry and have hardly any toppings.  Some of the servers there are nice, friendly and polite but the other ones are rude and careless. Best experiences there - the pizzookie dessert and the root beer are both pretty good.  Pizza isn't bad either. Worst experience there - someone in my party was served a burnt burger, sent it back, came back out burned AGAIN. We were all done eating by then and so the person never got anything to eat and went home hungry.  Worst part, the server never apologized and didn't seem to care that this person was leaving their restaurant hungry.   BJ's management, get your business right."
Vyjayanthi R.,"Bellevue, WA",147,152,26,3.0,2/16/2014,"This place is a difficult one to rate.  The appetizers were great, very different from stuff I've had in the past. We went with the avocado egg rolls and spinach stuffed mushrooms, both of which are excellent! However, the main course left me wishing that I had made a meal out of the appetizers. The veggie pizza was very mediocre, which is surprising considering that pizza is their specialty item - it tasted very much like a pizza you may get at a large chain like pizza hut/domino's.  However, I'll give this place points for being open till 1AM and for the friendly, efficient waitress. Good place for a late night dinner with a large group of friends."
Nick T.,"Sammamish, WA",0,12,,1.0,1/25/2014,"Avoid, avoid, avoid.  Horrible waiters and service, mediocre food at best.  After two bad experiences, thought I would put pen to paper to warn others.  1.  First went there about a month after it opened up for lunch with a colleague.   Waiter was super slow to take our order and bring our drinks.  Then our food never came.  Seriously. After about 45 minutes we walked out.  We asked the waiter numerous times to check up on our order (turkey clubs) and told him we only have 60 minutes to dine and that we need to get back to work.  Every time he promised us to check and reassured us our food was coming.  Unbelievably bad service.  Chalked it up to staff working out the kinks, but made it a point to avoid until.... 2. a friend convinced me to catch the second half of a Seahawks game there in December.  Atmosphere was great, lots of Seahawks fans and TVs, and I was hopeful. Long story short, waiter got our order completely wrong - food was delayed, some meals were brought, others were not and others were brought after half of our group had finished eating. None of the staff, including our waiter seemed interested in their jobs and serving their patrons.  They were all focused on talking to each other and the game.  ugh So save your money and time.  Do not dine here.  Plenty of other good restaurants in the area.  As a side note, I will be surprised if this place is still in business 12 months from now."
Michelle G.,"West Linn, OR",81,51,146,2.0,12/2/2013,"Well it's big and if you like big chain restaurants this is your place. The menu was HUGE... Reminds me of Chef Ramsey. Find something and be the best at it, don't have 55 items to choose from them your just a production line.  The food came quick, it was decent so I have no real complaints  The service was awful. Slow, inadequate and non concerned. Here is a tip: if you seat 5 People bring 5 place settings.  This would be a good place to meet for happy hour but we won't return."
John M.,"Grover, MO",0,16,,4.0,5/2/2016,"While on a business trip, checked out the place.  Took a while to get a table on a Sunday night, not sure why.  But once seated service was good.  Food was also very good, and beer selection was great.  Probably going back!"
Anne M.,"Redmond, WA",23,232,75,4.0,11/26/2013,"I am updating this review with a 4 star from a 2 star, as since our first experience, my husband and I have been back to BJ's and have had a really nice experience there. We were seated almost immediately, and our server was with us straight away, and really knew the menu this time around. The appetizer we ordered was served very promptly, and our entrees were served together, and the portions were huge. The ambience also seemed a lot nicer this time around, I guess now that all the initial opening hustle and bustle has died down. I'm really glad we gave this place another go, it was a great experience, and we look forward to returning."
Paul V.,"Woodinville, WA",26,19,,1.0,7/25/2013,"Mistakenly the boys and I decided to go here without checking Yelp first, my mistake.  Waited 20 minutes to get a seat and then 45 minutes to get our food.  They brought out only 2 of our dinners and my other son had to wait about 12 minutes for his food.  Son 1 ordered the Mac and Cheese, and yes he prefers Kraft mac and cheese anyways so was okay with it, but literally looked like they had plopped it out of a square container and didn't even bother to mix it up at all, looked absolutely horrible.  He said it was alright.   I had the pulled pork sandwich, that they didn't make according to their listing of stuff they put on it.  Didn't matter in the long run it was bad.   And finally while I was putting ketchup on my plate another waiter came by and asked if I was finished with that Ketchup?  Apparently they have only one ketchup bottle in the place.   Even my kids were unimpressed to the point of not wanting dessert which is unheard of from them.  Disappointing."
Alison P.,"Everett, WA",17,52,7,2.0,2/7/2014,"Took close to 1 hour to get our lunch for a party of 7 people.  5 out of 7 people ordered small pizzas so not a difficult order and one of the pizzas at our table came out almost 10 minutes after everyone else had their food.  All the tables around us, that were seated after us received there food before we did. Two people ordered the same desserts and they were brought out separately within 1 minute of each other. Why? That's kind of how the whole lunch went. . The staff was nice but the service was too slow Will probably never go back,  ok well maybe if I'm desperate,  maybe. ....."
Tiger W.,"Three Cocks, United Kingdom",36,239,2,1.0,7/28/2013,"It's really unfortunate, because I love the BJ's franchise out of state. Here, it failed on so many levels.  They had happy hour in the bar area between 10-12 tonight. The poor server was swamped with 15 tables when we came in. Understaffed much? I don't blame her for being a bit confused, considering how overloaded she was.  The wings we got for $4, only had 5 pieces. That's shameful, since Applebee's gives like 10-12 pieces for $5-6 during their happy hour, and their wings are much better. These wings were just... uninspired, and bland, and the bf and I were rather disappointed by them.  The spinach and artichoke dip was quite good, but the portion was again lacking. Happy hour doesn't mean you go skimpy on everything, it just means you lower the prices on appetizers and whatnot, so that your patrons drink more!  All in all, it was $40 I'll never get back. The beer was ok, but definitely not worth it, and the kitchen shouldn't have taken 45 minutes to get our food out to us. I think we'll be heading elsewhere in the future, since there's many better places we can drink, like JJ Mulhoney's.  Very disappointed."
Jason A.,"Seattle, WA",28,127,1,1.0,5/17/2013,"Yes, one star.  I literally pondered whether I could move it to two stars for the past three minutes, and I can't do it. Look, I came here with low expectations.  This is a chain restaurant in the quasi-fancy Redmond Town Center.  So yeah, I'm expecting pre-formed frozen burger patties and such.  They still managed to set the bar even lower. I went with a group of 6 during what was apparently their first or second week.  The wait was terrible and their repeated and revised estimates were not even close on the wait time.  Ok fine, they're busy, no problem. When seated, we didn't see anyone for over 10 minutes.  Strange, but whatever. Our server was a little strange and just kept parroting lines that I guess he was forced to memorize.  ""Can I get you some nachos to start the evening?""  ""Well, I really need some water right now""  ""Ok, so is that a 'no' on nachos?  Because you might want to start your evening with nachos!"" One in our party ordered a german beer on the menu.  The server was literally mystified.  Even after handing over the menu and pointing to the exact beer, the server just stared blankly.  10 minutes later, he came back and asked what beer it was.  Then another server came by and asked.  I don't even know what to say. The food, when it did arrive, was predictably terrible.  Yes, I realize that if I were a starving child in Africa, I'm sure it would be fine.  But I also wouldn't be using the internet to write reviews.  The point is, it was terrible. Despite this 3-hour ordeal, there was never once an apology, just the bill casually dropped at the edge of the table.  I've been to restaurants that have opening challenges and they either give you something for next time (gift card or whatever) or, the smarter route, just comp most or all of your meal.  Even a free dessert or something goes a long way to soothe people's resentment. Unredeemably terrible.  I never thought Red Robin would outclass a place in both food and service, but I think we have a winner."
Ty R.,"Kihei, HI",125,23,,2.0,5/15/2013,"Wow, bad. Granted, it's new...but man oh man it's not good. I've had great experiences at BJ's both in California and even at the Southcenter location. When this one opened up I was pretty stoked!  So, we went on Sunday as I was really craving pizza. I had 2 of their beers.  I had the blonde and Amber. The blonde was really good and the Amber was mediocre at best.  Unfortunately our server screwed up and it took 3 tries to bring me the amber. Our server was obviously new, but he was super nice and attentive.  Really great guy. I ordered the spicy meatball & jalapeno pizza (I'm normally a pepperoni and jalapeno guy).  It was not good.  I had two pieces in the restaurant. I took the rest home because I REALLY hate wasting food.  I'm glad my wife talked me out of ordering the bigger size of pizza.  My wife had chicken and pasta.  It was ok.  Really nothing we couldn't have made at home in about 10 minutes.  It was really unfortunate as I was looking forward to this.  We paid our $60 (jeezus) check and left.   We went across the street to Spazzo for their all day happy hour and had a great pizza over there.  We spent half the money and got the same amount of food. Sorry BJ's.  I hope you get better, but I won't be back."
Corey P.,"Lynnwood, WA",26,4,,1.0,6/2/2013,"Me, my wife and our 2-year old daughter ate here for the first time ever.  The waiter spilled a drink on my wife and daughter.  They didn't have the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, which is what my wife wanted.  When the food arrived we had to ask for the fries that were supposed to come with her sandwich and her sandwich's bread was so dry she only ate half, my BBQ bison burger was cooked but warm like it had been sitting out or under a heat lamp and my daughter's corn dogs were burnt and we had to peel most of the the breading off so she basically had hot dogs.  We were there with another couple and their two kids.  Their meals was fine but we asked to split the bill and it took the server 10-15 minutes to get that figured out.  We paid cash to leave as quickly as we could.   The whole experience at this place was bad.  Don't eat here."
Kirsten E.,"Issaquah, WA",21,16,,2.0,7/14/2013,"We visited BJs on two different occasions.  The first was during their grand opening week.  The second was after they had been open for a little longer.  I guess we are not only gluttons for food, but for punishment, as well. Lobby/hostess stand:  Too many staff members hovering.  Call-ahead seating could be a bonus, but if you aren't there at a busy time, there isn't anyone else in the lobby, and empty tables are plentiful, their check-in process is overkill and completely unnecessary.  Quit asking us irrelevant questions and just seat us, already! Food:  Love the extensive menu!  Lots of tasty options for everyone.  The shrimp tacos were yummy. Fried artichokes were interesting with a delicious dipping sauce.  The watermelon and feta salad was good.  The mozzarella and tomato salad had great flavor.  Their food is the ONLY reason I didn't score this a ONE STAR. Service:  Here's where we have a problem.  On both of our visits, the number of staff members easily outnumbered the customers by double.  Lots of staff wandering around, appearing busy (APPEARING).  One would think, with as many apron-wearin' folks around, the service would be better.  We informed our server that we were in a bit of a hurry, as we had a movie to catch.  Not only did he ignore our request for prompt service, but he insulted us by saying we were going to a really dumb movie that he thought looked really bad.  TWICE he brought this up.  Refills for drinks (water and soda) were nearly nonexistent.  Food came out very slowly.  Waiting for our bill took far too long, even when we requested it.  Nobody seemed to be in any kind of efficient speed mode at all.  Just a lot of standing around, chatting amongst themselves, and not focusing on the customers.   Suggestions:  I think this place would benefit from some intense customer-centric training and firing 50% of the staff, as they are probably not needed anyway.  Ease up on pushing expensive specialty drinks.  This only makes you look like you are trying to compensate for having bad food, which you don't.  The food is great!"
Lizzie C.,"Seattle, WA",5,35,2,4.0,7/25/2013,"The BJ's management must be reading all these terrible reviews, because when I went there for dinner last night with my husband and two friends, it was--gasp!--a good experience. First, the promptness issue: not a problem last night. Drinks and apps came after 10 minutes, entrees after another 10, the check after only a few minutes' wait. Water glasses got refilled often. Our food wasn't steaming hot, but was at least warm. Several staff members stopped by to ask how everything was, and all were pleasantly friendly. Second, the food: better than some competitors (Cheesecake Factory, Red Robin, etc.). My husband and I shared 6 appetizers/small plates (shut up, we were hungry): avocado egg rolls, chips and salsa, Thai chicken won tons, watermelon feta salad, bruschetta, spinach stuffed mushrooms. All were a hit. Our friends each got the pulled pork sandwich and something involving steak. The only complaint was for the steak, which was pronounced mostly gristle. Third, the drinks: generous and varied. My husband and I shared a beer sampler, and each beer was a 5-oz pour--the most I've seen for a sampler anywhere. And at $13 for 8 pours, the value was good. Everything else--atmosphere, decor, seating, etc.--is sleek and classy, but not stuffy.  We plan to go back to try more of the vast menu, and also to see if our next experience stacks up. In short, if you like the Cheesecake Factory but want a restaurant with a name that lends itself to sexual jokes, you might be a fan of BJ's."
Joanne D.,"Bellevue, WA",5,58,4,3.0,5/11/2015,"2 stars for service and 4 stars for food.  Review for visit on Sunday 5/10/15 at 10 pm . -Had the ahi tuna salad and was pleasantly satisfied. Tuna was cooked perfectly and the dressing on it was great.  -Mediterranean tacos were delicious also but wasn't expecting the grain side to be cold. -The pesto chicken sandwich was my favorite. Had a bit of kick to it and was not greasy like a typical grilled sandwich. -ended with the pazookie trio. Had the Oreo, classic and double chocolate chunk. All delicious but obviously screams diabetes.  -service friendly but not anything special...happy hour menu not very extensive. Would rather go to the matador for happy hour."
J B.,"The Colony, TX",4,58,2,5.0,3/8/2016,"Being the king of this place on Yelp I thought it was about time to give it a proper review... I see a lot of bad reviews and I wanted to do my due diligence on rating this restaurant since I've been to several different BJ's in Texas and Washington. My first impression wasn't the best and I've had a couple of hiccups along the way but management most of the time has handled the order situations properly. As with any restaurant you will have hits and misses in management, wait staff, and in the kitchen. Right now I'd like to give patrons a few tips... Use the app.. I save a lot of time knowing what I want to eat before I pull up to the restaurant that way I can give my order taker my entire order when they first. I can typically get in and out within an hour unless it's prime time dinner rush.  In the 10 months I've frequented this location I've seen some pretty god waiters . The first one that made me want leave a review is Nicholas for his attentiveness and attention to detail on our order  . There have been a few other men and women that have done a really exceptional job I just don't remember all the names. Sometimes when the wait is long for getting a table they hand out pizza which is pretty good. The rating I see for this place on Yelp is very underrated for a Washington restaurant, and the service I've received. Update: Edward or Edwin ... Gotta confirm his name he is an awesome waiter too"
