Ruben H.,"Bellevue, WA",208,301,49,1.0,5/26/2013,"This location in Redmond truly sucks.  They are very proficient at doing everything wrong on every order......so if you're looking for that kind of consistency feel free to order at will.  I called back and talked the manager who may have been 10 yrs old and he said I didn't need to remind him of the Yelp reviews.  Their Deep dish is a chubby version of Little Caesars thing crust pizza.....horrible.  Tukwila location is much better, however the best Deep Dish in the Seattle area is still Kylies."
Rittwika R.,"Chicago, IL",32,11,1,5.0,1/10/2015,"Although lines are a bit heavy while entering ,once you get seated the fun begins. They have some of tastiest margaritas I have ever had . Moving on to food and we ordered quite a bit of it, I found difficult to choose a favorite as everything we had ordered was quite delicious: The broccoli cheddar soup bread bowl, fried calamari, the flatbread pizza, spinach stuffed mushrooms and the fried beignet for dessert. Definitely going back there to try their jalapeño burger people are raving about."
Julie N.,"Seattle, WA",151,96,123,2.0,2/10/2015,Saltiest clam chowder soup I've ever had. Thought maybe it was just my luck but my friend got the chicken tortilla soup and she said hers was also really salty. Fast service but I'd rather wait a little longer if it meant better food!
Sharon L.,"Seattle, WA",15,30,,4.0,2/10/2014,"The food here basically reminds me of an Applebee's. It's alright if you're watching a football game, but I would never come here just to eat. However, I would come for those damn pizookies. They are amazing. A slightly undercooked cookie that is gooey and melty and hot with ice cream. Amazing."
Cindy M.,"Bellevue, WA",8,32,8,2.0,5/20/2015,"We waited forever on a Wednesday night even though we called ahead. Our server forgot three things, and the Kale Salad left a lot to be desired. Definitely add chicken or something to that because it's really plain and unfilling and its like $12. A couple of people with us had burgers they liked. I should say, I've had much better experiences here, but they were in the later evening."
Brandy C.,"Kirkland, WA",6,41,6,2.0,10/5/2014,"I met a friend for lunch here recently, and really expected more. The hostess greeted us promptly, but as we were walked back to our table, she started barking at two other staff members for talking in what she referred to as the front of the house. I found her tone with them far ruder than their conversing. Not such a great first impression. Next, it took a while to get a drink ordered. It was around 11:50 am, before the lunch rush. When the waiter did come by, his apron was DISGUSTINGLY dirty. Seemed odd since he just mentioned his day was just starting. Really gross to think of the germs and bacteria covering his clothing, from what looked like days of wearing between washing.  I ordered the lemon chicken. The chicken was amazing! But, the Brussel sprouts with it were really really really dry. Also, the patio seating 2 top tables left no foot room under the table since the base of the table takes up the majority of the floor space. It felt awkward. Not sure I'll be back."
Kathie s.,"Bellevue, WA",28,314,227,3.0,12/3/2013,"Excited to try a new brewhouse on the eastside, I went to have a beer an appetizer.  The menu was huge with lots of selections of both beer and food.   I thought the atmosphere, beer and food was ok, but not exactly what I was looking for.   I recently went back a second time, and again it was fine, service was good, but not exactly what I was looking for in a brewhouse.  I think that I much prefer a smaller, less chainlike brewhouse."
Sequoya L.,"Kirkland, WA",89,46,4,3.0,1/8/2015,"Seating is tight - could use a little more room in the booths. Outdoor seating is good. Staff is good but some may not have as much experience as others. Food is alright, lunch menu is good as is the Pazooki. Sign up for their dining card (free) and you can get money off, free Pazooki, etc. Good for crowds and kids, a little noisy."
Christopher R.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,,5.0,1/21/2015,"This was my first 5 star experience in a long time! Met a friend for lunch on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Enjoyed a very good pale ale, ordered the jalapeno burger at the recommendation of the bartender and the food and service were outstanding. Bartender was attentive, chatty and fun. food was great and the value was spot-on. I'm heading back with a larger group of friends on Friday."
Jay P.,"Bellevue, WA",47,25,,1.0,5/12/2013,"Overpriced, mediocre pre-frozen food. Incredibly loud. If you're lugging around a large family, this is a pretty typical family restaurant with bland food and nobody batting an eyelash if your kid chucks his burger on the floor. If you're single or childless, you have no excuse going to a restaurant this bad with Matt's Oyster Lounge right across the street. EDIT: We went back a couple of months later, thinking maybe the restaurant was just experiencing growing pains when we first visited (it had only been open a month), and because a friend of mine RAVES about another one of their locations. I'll spare you a long essay, long story short: loud; awful waitstaff; long waits; inedible food (I left my pizza after a few bites); and they got our bill wrong by $20.  Is it possible to give lower than one star?"
Kat T.,"Woodinville, WA",249,45,23,1.0,5/17/2013,"Holy hell was this place a mess. If I didn't call ahead for a seat and waited the hour for a table, I probably would have made a scene. There wasn't one thing, save putting water on the table, that was right. First, you gotta cut the damn scripts. No...I don't want the card. No...I don't want whatever appetizer you are pushing. Staff should spend more time familiarizing themselves with the bar menu so they aren't totally stumped.  Speaking of the beer, this was the first wrong - the beer came out after the appetizer...and it was wrong. There was a lame excuse made that the beer system wasn't working...then the staff didn't know how to pour beer after I casually glanced at all the other tables that had their drinks. They brought the wrong beers entirely and the had clearly had been sitting around a long time. After about 2 bites of our appetizer, the mains came out. There was no room at the table so we had to scrape and stack our own plates (rookie move) to fit everything. No check backs either so the requested extra butter/sour cream was brought after my potato was cold.  So I guess your standard loud, churn & burn chain restaurant has come to town. There are enough people accustomed to the cattle lot style of dining so the likes of me will surely not be missed."
Jermey E.,"Bothell, WA",63,47,8,3.0,6/19/2013,Well well well... So Monday I set an event for 25 people with the restaurant. I get a call from my boss that there were no reservations in my name for last night when all the guests arrived. I shouldn't be surprised after my previous experiences... So I decided to contact the store manager. They said they didn't have it on the books and who ever took care of my reservation requests didn't write it down. Which is even more frustrating. But! And this is a +2 start big but.  The store manager was kind enough to still rope off an area last minute and take care of my peeps. I also got feedback from my team that the service was spot on and they handled everyone amazingly. For that! I thank you BJ's team. You're redeeming yourselves and did the right thing and owned the situation. Thank you so much for taking care of the group and I hope the next dinner I do will go issue free.  Like I said before. The food and drinks are great but the service has a lot of learning to do. Especially for such a busy area. Keep striving for excellence and your restaurant will do amazingly!
Caitlin S.,"Redmond, WA",67,11,1,2.0,8/12/2013,"Unfortunately, after a few experiences at this BJ's this has to be a ""Meh, I've experienced better"" kind of review. In order to dine here, you must be patient because you will wait, and wait, and wait and wait. You will wait for a table (their call ahead seating list policy is extremely murky. It seems to change depending on who is working the hostess stand), you will wait for your server at every ordering stage and you will wait for your food.  All of the above would be worth it if the food was amazing, but in truth the food is only so-so.  Bummer."
Susan R.,"Seattle, WA",40,6,,1.0,10/9/2014,"Went for brunch on Sunday. Yeah, it's not a typical brunch/breakfast place but we were looking to avoid a crowd. Unfortunately now we know why there was no crowd at all. We had a party of 6, including 2 toddlers that needed high chairs. We were seated at a booth (?) after we had requested 2 high chairs. We had to ask for them to place us where there was a table where 2 high chairs could actually be used.  Then there was confusion over how many children's menus we needed. Um... 2?  We ordered coffee and the waiter informed us it would be about 10 minutes because they just had 2 other tables order coffee and there wasn't enough. Really? Brunch on Sunday and you don't have carafes of coffee waiting?  I ordered a scramble and then was asked how I wanted my eggs. I had to repeat  my order and explain the eggs come... scrambled in the scamble? The waiter didn't appear to know the menu. When food came, 3 adults were served first. 2 of them had cold potatoes on the side. Then came the kid's food and the 4th adult about 5 minutes later. One adult sent back the potatoes and the other just decided not to eat theirs. Now, I know some people will say this is a bizarre complaint, but clearly the mac and cheese the kids ordered was from a box. Now, I don't expect gruyere and hand rolled pasta for a 3 year old, but is it really that hard to make a cheese sauce and some boxed pasta? So that was disappointing. I tried the mac and cheese and it really wasn't good, it's salt and orange coloring, what can you expect? My actual scramble was good. That was about the best part of the meal. We never got water or coffee refills the entire time we were there. Really? Again with the coffee you charge $2.25 for? We asked for 2 checks, one for each family (each sitting on one side of the table) and the checks came incorrectly, we had to ask them to fix it. Definitely not attending any meals before 6 pm at this establishment ever again."
Nydia W.,"Bellevue, WA",4,43,7,2.0,7/6/2015,"I have visited this place twice within a couple of months and I won't hurry back here.  It's not horrible but at the prices I would expect better. On my two visits the service was very underwhelming.  On my latest visit we had to ask for utensils after our salads were served.  Our ""loaded"" baked potatoes were plain.  We had to ask for water when the glasses were empty.  We were not asked if we wanted another beverage when those glasses were empty.  The check was brought at the end of the meal and we had to ask if it was okay if we ordered dessert.   The waiter was nice but younger and there didn't seem to be enough waitstaff on duty.  The restaurant wasn't full - I shudder to think what the service would have been like with a full room.   The menu is large - what's up with having a 20 page menu?  Most of it is beers and such, but it is annoying when you just want to order food.   There is outdoor seating which was full when we visited.  Lots of TVs tuned to sports all around the room. I would go again, but not my first, second, or third choice."
Julia R.,"Maple Valley, WA",10,24,,2.0,6/4/2013,"I like the BJs in Tukwila so I suggested we try this location as its new. Never have i been more disappointed and in a chain restaurant no less! When we arrived around dinner hour it was packed and we waited about 20 minutes. No problem. Then we were called to be seated, about halfway in the dining room the hostess looks around and seems confused. She told us to wait there and left. We stood awkwardly in the middle of the room with our 12 month old infant for a few minutes. Luckily we were seated and not sent back to the front. As we sat I noticed a staff member staring at us while we were chatting. I wanted to ask him what was up but I figured he might be our waiter. Sure enough when we stopped talking he gave us our menus. He asked for our drink order and suggested we order appetizers as the kitchen was backed up. The avocado egg rolls are delicious! Best thing we ate.  Anyway, throughout the night our waiter told us how he was so busy he hadn't had a drink of water his whole shift. He seemed extremely overwhelmed and we felt bad for him. He also mentioned that the kitchen was a ""sh*t show"" literally his words. Very unprofessional but we let it go. Although we did have our small child there but I guess he forgot. Ha. Our salads were good but everything else was utterly disgusting The minestrone soup was more like a chili, thick and way too salty. It also tasted like there was meat in it. The veggie burger my husband ordered was bland and gross, it literally had no sauce and yet the bun was soaked through . The fries were so soggy. You know how you put old fries in the microwave? Tasted just like that. They obviously don't take pride in their food there and I can honestly say I prefer Red Robin! Don't waste your money I beg of you!"
Bill B.,"Sammamish, WA",0,9,3,4.0,2/27/2016,I've been trying BJ's again and it's gotten pretty consistent. I love the ribs and the service has been good. Good to see them getting it together.
Amy Z.,"Redmond, WA",2,19,6,4.0,3/7/2015,"Needed a quick bite so we drove by. I ordered Hawaiian mahi mahi and husband California chicken sandwich, both were really good. The trainee made me a mohito that's quite tasty too. Don't know why the rating is so low? We didn't try their needs though.."
Catherine S.,"Kirkland, WA",1,5,,1.0,6/27/2014,"I really want to like this place. Love the sports bar/good atmosphere, love their berry cider. But I cant. I have tried three times, and the third time, shame on me for thinking that I could just get a burger, the way I wanted it, to go. The first and second time we ate in the bar. OK food, very good cider. Slooooowwwww service. Both times. And in some cases neglectful and a bit rude.  The third time I ordered curbside. I called in my order for curbside pickup at 6:30 to be picked up at 7:30. Plenty of time, right? I got there at 7:30 - my order wasn't ready until 7:50. I paid my money, plus a small tip for the girl who brought my food to me and took my money. I didn't bother to look at what they had put in the bag -I just wanted to go home and eat. I should have looked. I got a burger with NOTHING on it - I had ordered a buffalo burger with lettuce, pickles, sauce on the side and paid EXTRA for bacon and cheese. I got none of it. All I got was a dry, overcooked burger and a bun. That was a really expensive burger and a bun. To top it all off, I ordered a pizookie, and what I got was half a burnt pizookie. All of the dough had slid to one side of the pan, and it was raw in the middle and burnt on the edges. Fail. All I wanted was a burger, fries, salad and dessert. At least they got the fries and salad right.  I reached out to them via email and no response. Don't go there. If you do, don't leave without thoroughly checking your order."
Song K.,"Redmond, WA",49,319,140,4.0,1/20/2014,"My friend and I decided to go to BJ's for the NFC championship game which was awesome. The people around us were all very friendly and fun. The waiter had a handlebar mustache and was amazingly attentive and friendly! I was thinking the service would slow down because of the amount of people there but, it was well staffed and the waiter was quick and always came around to check on us. The waiter was very knowledgeable on drinks and prices so it helped a lot on saving time and knowing what we wanted based on that information. We had a steak for an appetizer and ordered some fried chicken as our dinner. The chicken was surprisingly soft and delicious and the steak was flavorful and juicy (medium rare of course). Overall, it was a great experience! lots of parking, large space, friendly people and staff, lots of TV's to choose from, things to eat and drink! Overall it was awesome for that day. I am giving it a realistic 4 starts even though that day was a 5 star day because I have been to BJ's 2 times before and the service at the bar and food at that time was a bit meh. Perhaps if I go another time and it stays awesome, I can upgrade it to 5 since consistency is key."
