Reid M.,"Kirkland, WA",38,4,,2.0,4/23/2015,"Good drinks. But the rest was lacking. Appetizers: Mac and Cheese was practically cheeseless, but edible despite that. The Pepperoni Pizza Dip tasted like a Hot Pocket minus the crust. Personal pizza my fiance ordered was alright. My lasagna was another Hot Pocket, this time with little pieces of sausage added. Nearly inedible. Server was friendly enough, but managed to badmouth other restaurants while in conversation with us, and had next to zero product knowledge. I won't be back, unless it's to grab a quick drink."
Tamisra J.,"Bothell, WA",1,44,3,1.0,5/28/2013,"First of all, I quite like BJ's as a chain and have been to a few of their locations earlier. But this experience was beyond belief - it was SO bad !!!!!!  To start with, there were so any small annoyances. The seating area was so cold that we had to put on our jackets. The Kids menu had ran out - so we got a crummy photocopy. I love the Italian soda there - but also had run out.....it was only seven o'clock !!  And the service....OMG.....our starters actually came around 45 mins later.....along with the main course.....actually the main course beat it to the race. The taste was good for the appetizers but really bland for the burgers. Astonishingly, no one ever came to apologize ! Simply unthinkable. The lady who was serving us was very disengaged and clearly a novice. Being a loyal customer, I will try other locations.....but stay from this one till they are over the teething  period or someone else takes charge...."
Leah D.,"Renton, WA",30,3,,1.0,6/27/2016,"I attended a birthday party for a girlfriend this evening, let me start by saying that I have never had an issue at the Southcenter location, that wasn't the case with the Redmond location. We had reservations for a party of 14 set for 715 pm on a Monday night. The dining area was pretty quiet this evening and we had 2 waiters start by taking our drink order after we were seated. The drinks came out immediately, then the waiters took our appetizer orders. The appetizers came out within about 10 minutes but they were mainly chips and salsa or spinach artichoke dip. After the appetizers came out our 2 waiters disappeared, forever. After flagging down 2 separate staff members and asking for utensils for a kids meal and waiting for refills on water (30 minutes)  I had finally had enough and flagged down a manager to let her know what was up. The manager got involved and apologized for the delay. Apparently a party of 30 walked in (without reservations) and got the red carpet treatment. We bussed our own table, gathered our own pitchers of water, went to the bar to get napkins all while waiting for someone to take our food order. We also let the manager know how displeased with the service we had up until this point. They finally took our order and our food finally started coming out of the kitchen at 845 pm. At this point it is 9 pm and we still don't have our entire food order. This has got to be the worst service that I have ever experienced. I saw the manager running around and putting out fires with other customers as well. Whomever is running this place needs some refresher training on time management and customer service."
Tonya E.,"Duvall, WA",0,1,,1.0,7/17/2014,"I want to like BJ's, I really do. But a meal with kids that is over 2 hours of poor service,   inexplicable delays, and food left under heater while rest of meal is refired, has finally done it for me.  Back to the cacophony of Red Robin."
Claire H.,"Seattle, WA",1,22,6,4.0,5/16/2013,"Had an absolutely lovely experience at BJ's this afternoon and, seeing how it's a pretty new installation in the RTC complex, it seemed worth heading on over here to balance out some of the more scathing Yelp reviews. I will PROUDLY and UNABASHEDLY admit that my coworkers and I came here solely for the fact that we could spend our entire lunch making cheap and innuendo-laden jokes about BJ's, but we actually ended up having a lovely time.  Shocking!  Food was quick to come out, plentiful, and just about the quality I would expect- not anything to write home about, I suppose, but satisfying and definitely a tier above something like Red Robin. The restaurant is new and understandably spotless, and WAY more aesthetically pleasing than Desert Fire could ever hope to be- love the tall ceilings, and the whole place has a pretty surprisingly nice ambiance considering.  Our waiter was an absolute sweetheart, and I'm kicking myself for not taking down the guy's name- helpful, talkative, and completely attentive to our needs. ...What can I say, everyone enjoys BJ's."
Minerva G.,"Redmond, WA",0,13,,3.0,3/10/2015,I've ordered to go a few times.  The estimated time was way longer than expected.  Okay food.  Needs better customer service
Far H.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/1/2015,"Awful experience at this location the server Kelsey is rude  and the manager Peter is rude. They mess up your order and then don't even empathize with you at all whatsoever, they don't care and they take a long time for your food to come out and then when it does there is an issue with your food, so then you are waiting another 30 minutes for them to remake it. I would never return to this location again I will drive the extra 30 to 40 miles to go to south center mall rather than go here. If there was a way to give them a zero star I would"
Alexa B.,"Redmond, WA",10,9,,2.0,5/21/2013,"Tried BJ's in Redmond for the first time on 5/18.  What can I say, it's a chain restaurant that also serves beer that may or may not be made onsite.   Yes, they're still working out the kinks.  Yes, it is true that the water took forever to arrive and that our waitress in the bar knew very little about the beers on the menu.  Yes, the steak one of our party ordered was over done and was sent back. And yes, it actually took me awhile to even remember what we had to eat because it's bar food.   But like I said before, its a chain restaurant that may or may not serve beer made on site.  This describes the RAM, Rock Bottom, etc (granted I love the RAM so maybe a bad comparison).**   I will give props to our server who was able to make my meal work even though I had to pick it apart while ordering (I just had dental surgery so there is only so much I could eat).  The long and short of it, I'll go to the bar with a group any time but I wouldn't exactly wait 1+ hour for a table either.  If I had small hungry children/spouse with me I also wouldn't want to wait for a table.  However, if my choice was eating here or going to Claim Jumper (next door) I'd rather eat at BJs because Claim Jumper is the 7th circle of hell for me.  Anyways, it's new and much better than Desert Fire (I think that's what it was called?) so give it a shot.  Just level set your expectations, its a chain restaurant not a gastro pub. **Come to think of it maybe we could just get a RAM instead?"
Matt E.,"Auburn, WA",10,121,45,1.0,10/17/2014,"Mediocre lunch specials - not much flavor & long wait. The worst thing is that the bill never turns out right; everytime, I need to have the server correct it, and then end up waiting more. Very close to not coming back, even though it is right next to the office."
Brian C.,"Kirkland, WA",30,39,,3.0,1/21/2015,"I wish I could give 3.5 stars. I can't say I'm a big fan of the overall atmosphere, but I can't deny the food was good and the prices were VERY reasonable. Wait staff was nice and accommodating of our 3-year-old being out-of-control. If you're on the fence I'd say go, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
Zack H.,"Redmond, WA",40,50,24,3.0,10/5/2013,"This is an Awesome Place for young Adults to get together, have fun, enjoy a delicious burger and drink a lot of Beer! Yes, this place is only about ""Eat A Burger & Drink Beer"". The mood, lighting, interior design, food taste, seating areas are outstanding! One bad thing (and it seems it is frequently happening) is the disconnect between the servers: In general their SERVICE is BAD. We ordered 1 burger with skinny fries  (super delicious) and 1 grilled chkn sandwich with avocado and Chipotle sauce on the side with caezer salad instead of fries. We also tried 3 beer Free samples, then ended up ordering a glass Oasis beer. Another server came in with bacon sandwich and the correct salad. We told our main waitress that we received the wrong sandwich. She apologised politely and then she asked the kitchen to bring us the correct order. My wife then received a 2nd salad plate ""lol"" we told the waitress then we did not order another salad plate. She then realized that we already received the salad plate, but she said you guys can keep it for free if you want while waiting for the chkn sandwich. It was ok but this got us a bit more confused. What's happening in their kitchen?  Then our order came but the server forgot the chipotle sauce on the side. LoL. This was hell of an experience with their service. Our order was pretty small, there shouldn't be so many mistakes! Anyway, we still enjoyed our time and I have a feeling we were just lucky on that night to not experience a worse service than what we had. Probably, we will visit next time with friends but ""only"" to drink beer and eat a burger."
Bill G.,"Kirkland, WA",68,34,15,3.0,8/7/2014,"I love BJ's normally but we had just stopped for a light dinner of sliders and some calamari.  The sliders were good but no condiments and the calamari was cold and soggy. I was really disappointed. Our server was nice enough but never ask how our food was, maybe he already knew. I will go back but stay with the things I know they do well, the Mediterranean pizza and the avocado eggrolls."
Ryan E.,"Kenmore, WA",0,18,1,4.0,12/13/2015,"Our family went here for the first time last week. Service as great. It took a little longer to bring my wife's entree, so they gave us a free desert. Waitress was very good. Food was great. We will be back!!"
Mark D.,"Decatur, GA",86,350,43,4.0,10/31/2014,"This place was really better than I expected it to be. We don't have these where I live (Atlanta), so I was expecting something like a Chilis or similar. I was way off! I have to give props for their in house sodas. Loved the orange cream. And the food is a cut above your typical brewhouse. Good beer and good service too although it was super busy on a Sat. night. I'll soon be in Seattle/Bellevue for an extended stay and I will likely be going back to BJ's."
Jenna G.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,6,,1.0,6/27/2014,My office tried to order lunch using their online ordering system which was fine until after you place your order and find out that they do not accept payment online or over the phone which completely destroys the whole convenience of ordering online. The customer service is seriously lacking.
Tasam A.,"Seattle, WA",41,11,,3.0,7/28/2014,The Avocado egg rolls are very good to start with. The place is clean and their service is awesome.
Peyton F.,"Lewisberry, PA",0,8,3,5.0,7/27/2015,First time here. Had the avocado rolls and the Mahi Mahi with shrimp dinner on their light menu. It was absolutely amazing!  I highly recommend this dish. Not sure why this place doesn't have higher rating. Service was awesome as well
Cyn C.,"Honolulu, HI",6,65,5,1.0,5/26/2014,"This place has really bad service.  We had a party of 5 people.  My friend ordered the Parmesan chicken with vegetables.  Her chicken came with mashed potatoes and they forgot the veggies.  When we asked the guy that delivered the plate, he stared at us like a deer in headlights... basically that wasn't his job.  Then another waiter came to ask what the issue was.  When we told them, they said they are working on it.  My friend had one more bite of chicken left and the mashed potatoes were all gone before they finally brought out the veggies.  They didn't even apologize or notice that there was a problem.   When we tried to pay the bill, that also took forever. The only memorable thing was the triple chocolate Pizookie."
Matt W.,"Issaquah, WA",0,18,,4.0,10/25/2014,"Not sure what's up with all the poor reviews here... I had a great experience. Me and a couple buddies decided to get a couple of beers and some lunch on a rainy Saturday. Their beer selection is second to none, I got the sampler so I could try 4 different kinds before settling on the IPA, yum. My jalapeno burger was much larger than I expected and was very tasty. Our server in the bar area was attentive and friendly. I'll definitely be back for happy hour which is M-F from 3-7, can't beat that."
Melissa P.,"Redmond, WA",54,22,1,2.0,1/3/2016,"Yesterday I had the absolute by far worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. My In-law, my husband, my son and myself went to Bj's Brewhouse in Redmond yesterday around 315pm. The waitress brought our drinks and we didnt see or hear from her again till at least 25 mins later when our food came. Then not even 10 mins after our food came she comes to our table with the bill! We all still have mouths full of food we barely started eating. She doesn't even refill our drinks she is not concerned with us at all. Not even 5 mins later she comes back to see if we paid it yet. This waitress again didn't check any of our drinks or ask if we needed anything. The waitress came back like 2 minutes later again. The waitress was obviously rushing us. She explained ""they were kicking her out"" and 'she didn't want to transfer us"" but we just started eating. Finally she transferred us to some guy this guy waited forever to bring the bill then when he did he just dropped it on the table and walked off. He said nothing to us!!!! When he picked it up he said nothing. My husband went up to the station to ask him for a to go box right after he picked up the card cause we hadn't had a chance to say anything to him. When he brought it back with the to go box he CHUNCKED them onto the table without even looking at us it made a loud noise from hitting the forks and he didn't even stop before i could look up he was gone! I cant stress how rude and hard he threw the stuff down! Then my mother in law attempted to speak to ""a manager"" the manager didn't listen to anything she said. When she showed her the receipt the manager said oh BJ was your waiter..... The waiters name was not bj it started with an E. I do not think the woman my mother in law talked to was actually a manager the woman asked for no detail and did not introduce herself didn't give out her name. This issue needs to be addressed. To add more to it I had forgotten my phone there. While waiting to get my phone that same waiter ran right into me and said nothing didn't even look back. Its wasn't just a little bump either I lost my balance. This is RIDICULOUS!  Yesterday BJs did not just loose one customer they lost 2."
