Nancy A.,"Bellevue, WA",64,23,,4.0,7/23/2013,"Went there for dinner with 11 friends to celebrate a birthday.  We had a reservation for 5 so got in ahead of the main dinner rush.  Service was great and friendly. LOVED their allergen info!  I checked their website before going for gluten free options. They have a grid with the top 6 allergens and if it is in their dishes.  I had the gluten free pizza and it was great!  Everyone's food looked really good, portions were substantial and they all commented on how good it was.  The rest of the group ordered this HUGE cookie with ice cream dessert, while I had the gluten free choc chip cookie dessert.  It was wonderful!  I gave bites to some of the others skeptical that gluten free could be good.  They admitted they wouldn't know it was if I hadn't told them.   I will be back - there are more gluten free options to try!"
Cory C.,"Issaquah, WA",4,49,3,1.0,5/10/2014,"Extremely disappointed. Came here about 8 months ago. Showed up around 5pm on a Friday and requested a table for 3. The place was dead and we had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table (1st red flag). The hostess then sat us right next to another couple, which their table was a foot away. Sorry, but when every other table is open, don't sit me right on top of someone. The food was mediocre, but the service was very slow/poor. Will not return."
Rob K.,"Redmond, WA",0,37,,3.0,6/30/2013,"Like: You can call ahead to get your name on the wait list. Decor. Friendly waitress Crispy fries Gluten free pizza crust is awesome. BBQ sauce (two kinds) ""hand crafted"" soda Dislike: Vegi burger (probably from Costco) Burger bun = stale Dinner salad (iceberg with 2 slices of cucumber and 2 slices of tomato) Price of soda ($3 each) Price of gluten free pizza ($1 per topping adds up) We'll eat there again."
Daniel C.,"Woodinville, WA",1,96,4,3.0,10/20/2014,The decoy is nice and the presentation on the food is good The only problem I have is that the kitchen is really slow so you are not able to get in and out in 30 minutes (which is sometimes the only time I have) however if you have an hour to kill it'll work Prices are a little high for beer by like a dollar or two but the selection is nice
Carolyn P.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",11,22,11,2.0,9/19/2014,"Menu is too big. Everything is just okay, but not special. Service and atmosphere is better than the food."
Lorraine S.,"Redmond, WA",0,23,1,3.0,12/6/2015,"This place is more expensive than it should be. Came here over the summer, got some entré with fries and the fries were cold when they brought them. I would not necessarily mind if the price wasn't so high. Other than that though, the restaurant looks nice especially the interior."
Brooke P.,"Arlington, WA",48,23,,1.0,12/26/2014,"Worst place ever! This is now the third time we have been there and every time we get crappy service. We sit in the bar and every time it takes 15 minutes to great us and take our drink order. Our waiter that we just had, Geno, checked on us maybe once. We saw 4 other people. Thank god for Michelle the waitress there or else we would STILL be waiting to get our tab. The manager also walked over to help us and was very unprofessional! She has on a pink undershirt and her boobs hanging out. Her phone tucked into her bra! Disgusting! We gave them 3 chances, and to us, 3 Strick's and YOURE OUT!"
Greg G.,"Bellevue, WA",7,36,1,2.0,10/22/2014,"I love the beer at BJs, but the Southcenter location is much better. We've had issues with seating even when tables are open because of staffing, and we wanted to treat it as a brewery, but growlers are expensive and they only fill glass ones. Food is good,but we'll drive extra for the Southcenter location."
Michelle B.,"Redmond, WA",2,5,,3.0,11/20/2014,"Have been here several times and I give it 3 stars for the pizza, and a handful of other things, including: shoestring fries, sodas on-tap, the beer, pizookies, and maybe the pulled pork sandwich. I would not order anything other than pizza, or you might regret it. The salads are not fresh in fact they look dead, and anything else is over priced and bland or weird tasting. Burger was also bland and came with a wilted piece of lettuce. Sorry :[ Wait staff is okay, not the best but also not the worst."
Rachel G.,"Seattle, WA",1,28,1,4.0,6/26/2013,"We went here for a late father's day family dinner. Our waitress was brand new, and was training with another waitress. Even though this isn't the kind of restaurant I would normally go to, we all had a wonderful time. The entire place was packed from the moment we got there, but both of the waitresses were extremely attentive and gave excellent service. Our beers were delicious and the food was pretty tasty.  My mom ordered a turkey burger which came to the table a little burnt, so she let the waitresses know, just to alert the kitchen of the quality so they could control more of what goes out. The waitresses both offered her a new burger, which she declined, as she had already eaten most of it and still found it tasted fine. Not long after, the manager came out and apologized for the burnt food and again offered her a brand new meal. We were actually pretty shocked at the level of service, because it was excellent and polite and exactly how a good restaurant should handle an issue. I believe he ended up comping the burger for her, but I'm not positive. The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5/5 is because they let the burnt food reach the table. Otherwise, they were great.  Again, not really my type of restaurant but I'd be happy to go here again. Even the hostesses were lovely and polite and accommodating."
Cathy B.,"Redmond, WA",0,13,,2.0,4/10/2016,"Done.  Won't come back until they get their act together.  We just got home from our local BJ's and it was painful, pricey and not a good experience.  Going to the place at 3:30 on a Sunday, one would expect fast service but no, it took almost 45 minutes to get out meal and then it was just okay to marginal at best.  The reason?  Well, it seems the staff wanted to visit with one another instead of serving their customers.  We sat in the bar and the staff coming in and out of the kitchen and lining up at the bar to get orders did nothing but talk with one another and had a great time visiting.  The bartender served us our drinks and then turned her attention to her fellow waitstaff to visit.  10 minutes click by and we finally got her attention to place our order.  She took it and then went back to visiting with not only the servers but with the manager.  Wait, wait, wait and we saw other people who came in after us getting their orders.  Finally, we got our food.  My husband got the ribs that were 5 minutes from being mush and the brussel sprouts were burnt and old.  Finally, another bartender came by to check on us, after a nice visit with the staff, and we pointed out the sprouts - he quickly said he would get a new order.  Tick tock, tick tock the clock kept marching on until he came back and told us the kitchen was making a new batch.  Really?  Just then we could hear cheering and clapping coming from the kitchen.  Apparently they were more interested in something going on behind the scenes then cooking.  Bottom line?  Never got the sprouts but were offered a free dessert.  No thanks, we did not have another 1/2 hour or hour to wait while the staff visited with one another and did who knows what.  Seriously BJ's, I can understand if this was prime time on a Saturday night but one an afternoon on a Sunday?  If any manager or stock holder reads this, get to the Redmond location and school your staff on proper service and cooking of your products.  Until then, we are done.  Our money is better spent elsewhere."
Domenic T.,"Bellevue, WA",109,3,,3.0,8/29/2014,I have some friends that work here and they said to come in and look. The place itself has a good layout and lots of big flatscreens throughout the restaraunt.  Good for catching a game or having a few beers. The service was subpar and a bit pushy unfortunately. The bar itself was full and we just wanted a couple cold ones. The cocktail waitress seemed to be upset that we were only doing drinks... oh well! Catch a game and a pitcher here or something.
Anna E.,"Seattle, WA",1,35,9,4.0,10/14/2014,"This is the first time since we have been coming to BJ's in Redmond, that we left with a great feeling.  The service is HEADS AND SHOULDERS above any of the other times I have been there (quite a few). Honestly, we were considering not coming back again as prior service has been overall very poor, slow, and inattentive.  Tonight was nothing like that, and I commend you for hopefully making changes/improvements....it clearly showed!  The food was good, timely and nicely portioned.  I do think entrees at $15 should come with a small dinner salad, just saying.  Overall though, I will come back again, based on our server tonight!"
Alexandria C.,"Kirkland, WA",0,6,,1.0,2/17/2014,"Giving a one star because you have to give at least one star. I would NOT recommend coming here. Once seated, it took our server a while to acknowledge us. He looked busy, so I understand. We finally got to order, but then he got our orders wrong. The restaurant was not even close to busy and by the time we got our correct food, it had been 45 minutes. Then we tried to flag him down to get our check, but had no luck. I had to go upfront to a host and ask them to find my server. He made up multiple excuses for disappearing for so long, but in the end, it was just a waste of time. Not going back. I'll just go next door to Claim Jumper or to the Cheesecake Factory for the same prices and better service."
Joe P.,"Sammamish, WA",0,35,4,5.0,6/12/2014,"We have eaten here 5-6 times and always found the food and service to be top notch. We like to go early before it gets too busy, like 5:30. They have good beer, too."
Ed L.,"Sammamish, WA",1,5,,4.0,8/25/2015,Great happy hour. Nice Thai chicken salad. Great wings
Jessica H.,"Kirkland, WA",5,37,78,5.0,8/20/2014,"We have been I think 4 times in the past 3 weeks and have had GREAT service, food and drinks every time.  We sit at the bar with either Josiah or Brianna and have a great time.  So far we have had...Gourmet Mac n' Cheese (Awesome), Wings (Yummy), Bacon Cheese Burger with Fries (heck yeah) and the Buffalo Burger (juicy, Awesomeness)...for drinks they can shake a mean tequila shot but you must try the Berry Burst Cider...it is the best drink we have ever had...we even got growlers to go so we could have it at home...Highly recommend everything...we're going again this Saturday to try more new and yummy things!"
Caroline C.,"Redmond, WA",1,21,2,2.0,12/7/2013,"4 of us ordered 4 different burgers and all of us had the same complaint: charred. Since it was our first time visiting BJ's we weren't sure if this was their ""style,"" like how Starbucks drip coffee tastes.  But it wasn't a good burger, and this should be their sweet spot.  The burger was dry and left a bad taste in your mouth. Buns were decent, fries were good.  Side salad looked like it had been in the fridge for 2 days too many. 2 of the orders came out wrong, and were eventually fixed (if you could flag down one of the 1,000 people working there...none seemed to have a dedicated area they were working in, just kinda wandering around).  Food came, and then place settings a few minutes later. Beers were expensive, the menu was a phone book, which leads me to believe they aren't able to focus and deliver on anything of quality. A resounding MEH for BJ's."
MELISSA R.,"Woodinville, WA",2,21,,1.0,8/10/2013,"Worst experience I have had in awhile and I am NOT picky.  I have no idea why this place is still running a 20 minute wait but they are and we did.  No biggie.  It's new, it's popular, I get it.  I had heard the food and service were bad but wanted to judge for myself. The menu has a million items.  That would be good if the food was good but I'll get to that part later.  First of all we never got any water up front.  Then, the drinks for our party of four were brought out by three different people.  First my daughter's apple juice.  Waited a minute or two.  Then my diet Coke and my husband's beer.  Waited a minute or two.  Then my other daughter's root beer.  Weird. Same thing happened with the food.  All the food came except my one daughter's buttered noodles and then a few minutes later those came out.  Really?  For buttered noodles? Then the food was just bad and over priced.  Daughter #1 had mac and cheese.  It was obviously Kraft.  No biggie as I have seen other restaurants do that.   BUT it was lumpy, dry looking and according to my 9 year old, ""tasteless"".  She didn't even eat half of it and trust me, that kid can put it away. Then my $10 salad was TINY.  Also it was coated in dressing and the lettuce was soggy and limp.  I think maybe they make a huge batch or something earlier in the day and then by the time they take a serving out it is all soggy. Daughter #2's buttered noodles were ""chewy"" according to her.  Again, small portion of noodles, no biggie, and two slices of garlic bread the size of crackers. My husband's Caesar salad looked like a standard chain restaurant Caesar.  He said his noodles in his pasta dish were over cooked though.   Our server was eager and friendly.  I was expecting Cheesecake Factory quality food based on the surroundings and the newness of the restaurant.  I was shocked at how sad and bad it was.  Seems like there are probably a lot of management issues that probably need to be worked out.  I can't imagine a chain could grow that big and be that successful if they are putting out bad service and food like that at ever location. On a personal note, FOX News was on the biggest screen TV in the middle of the restaurant.  Certainly wouldn't have been my choice.  For a restaurant that is supposed to appeal to the masses I would pick a channel that is a little less divisive."
Isabella B.,"Redmond, WA",0,24,,2.0,2/23/2016,"I only gave 2 stars because the food is good but otherwise service is alwaaays slow and not always friendly. Maybe 2/5 of the time they've been nice, but still slow and barely check on the table. And they've messed up the orders a few times, like thin cut vs wedge fries, ordered bbq wings but got hot wings and when they brought the right one there were like 4 fewer wings. Once I flat out never got my side and when I asked she said they were out and making some more and she'd bring it, it never came so I just let it go. Most restaurants at least will offer some sort of substitution. I only go when it's really late because it's one of the few in Redmond open after 10, but I definitely try not to. And the food takes a really long time to come out, most places no more than 15 minutes for a table of 4, but here we've waited 30 or longer for 2 people. Our shortest time spent was one hour but its usually toward 2 hours because even the check takes forever. And needless to say it's overpriced."
