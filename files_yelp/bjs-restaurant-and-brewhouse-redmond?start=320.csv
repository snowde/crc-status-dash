Melelina I.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,89,86,1.0,4/5/2014,the worst BJ's i've ever been to. service is slow even when they're not too busy. they brought us calamari and one of the sauce cups was empty. so we asked 2 different waitresses for the sauce and neither of them brought the sauce. we asked another waiter for the sauce and by the time he brought the sauce the calamari was already cold. how hard is it to bring the sauce? and the first 2 waitresses said they were gonna bring it but never did. do they just say that then forget about us?
Buffy H.,"Redmond, WA",6,4,,1.0,9/17/2013,Condescending hostesses and rude bartenders only to be followed by mediocre food. Not worth the time or money.
jason R.,"Redmond, WA",0,25,,1.0,5/11/2013,"The restaurant is visually appealing and spacious. When my wife and I arrived with our 2 year old son, we were told a 15 minute wait. Promptly at 15 minutes we were taken to a table that would not accommodate a high chair. Back to the host counter where we were promptly reseated and provided a high chair (first high chair brought was not clean, so a second one was brought).  Having lived in Chicago, my wife ordered a Chicago Pizza and I ordered the buffalo wings. The pizza was brought out in a reasonable amount of time but not accompanied by the wings - this is OK, because we had a starving baby and we asked for the pizza to be brought out as soon as it was ready. We also asked our waitress if she could bring us a roll so my son could snack on something to which she replied - no problem. My wife and son finished their pizza and shortly after a gentleman came to the table and asked if we had ordered wings to which I replied yes. He said OK and then walked away. A few minutes later, a second gentlemen, who appeared to be management, informed me there was an issue with the wings to which I replied ""I understand, you are busy"". He replied, ""it's unacceptable"" and apologized - which was very nice. He then said he would reflect this in our check.  A couple of minutes later, our waitress comes over to explain the wings were taken to the wrong table (ever notice when food is taken to the wrong table, no one ever rejects it?? :) ) I told her that the babies timer was about to go off (been at the restaurant nearly an hour) so please take the wings off. She said that was what she was going to suggest and promptly handed me my bill with the wings removed - I thought this was a little odd - like they assumed (or hoped) I would ask for the wings to be removed and had the check (full bill mind you) prepared and ready to go. I've not worked in the restaurant industry so I don't know what proper protocol is in a situation like this. In my opinion - I felt I should have been provided some options to ""make it right"" instead of removing the wings and then out the door with me - removing the wings is bare minimum in my opinion.  We never received the roll we asked for and no one every mentioned it (we were not charged for it so it is what it is). For those considering to visit this restaurant, I'd suggest holding off for at least a  few months until they get the bugs worked out. My wife said the Chicago pizza, while good, was not authentic so don't go their solely for that if you know what a true Chicago style pizza is."
Melodi W.,"Duvall, WA",0,13,,3.0,7/2/2014,"We eat here a lot, not because the food is great but because it is open late. We used to love the food but then they changed the menu and got rid of our favorite items.  The waitstaff is always very friendly and we seldom have issues with them. The kitchen staff however is very inconsistent. One week a dish is good and the next week it's really bad. Fortunately the waitstaff is good about making sure that the item is removed and that you have something you are happy with. I am holding out hope that they will bring back our favorites(or at least the buffalo chicken fried won tons!)"
Leland A.,"Kirkland, WA",0,16,,1.0,4/18/2015,"Awful experience, could not pay me to go back.  Sat at the bar, no problem with the drinks although the service was a bit slow.   Ordered the breakfast sandwich and a California club, breakfast sandwich was soggy and the club was distinguishingly greese and I am sure the grill had not been cleaned in days. Brought it to the attention of the manager who did not seem too concerned or bother to apologize, just offered to take the food off our bill."
Karen K.,"Issaquah, WA",11,25,1,1.0,5/7/2013,"Okay I understand that they just opened but if you are doing the lunch crowd food needs to be ordered and out to the table in 10 to 15 minutes not 35 minutes to have the waiter give us excuses as to why it is still not there.  First the computer is down then some staff person got sick.  Never mind you have double staff running around and tons of people working.  If one missing staffer puts you that far behind then you need to rethink your staffing.  Finally my food arrived but not my wife's who ordered food that took much less cooking then mine.  I instructed them to box our food and bring our bill that we needed to get back to work NOW.  The waiter takes my plate.  We wait another 5 minutes finally another serever comes by and we tell her we need to leave but no food no bill yet.  She brings our bill, no comp, no visit from management but we got a full bill!  Still no food we wait another 3 minutes now bring 8 minutes that my food is getting cold in the box and still no sign of wife's food.  We leave without paying or food and are not two steps away from the tble and the bus person is clearing our table.  Not until I threw a fit in the lobby did a manager finally show up offering comps which we refused because no on seems to get THAT WE NEEDED TO GET BACK TO WORK.  No idea how the food is we did not even see part of it and what I did see was way over priced.  Will not be going back anytime soon. BTW this place opened 5/6/2013 so any reviews before this are either liars or they went to the soft opening and I suggest you take those with a grain of salt as they would have been given the best service and chances are they are bias."
Raks P.,"Redmond, WA",0,24,,1.0,10/28/2013,Very poor service. Orders are coming after hours. What else to say. Better stay away from a busy evening.
Tony C.,"Seattle, WA",0,13,,1.0,5/7/2013,"Having to work from Redmond Town Center and needing a new place for lunch, I decided to give BJ's a try. Never heard of them, but I'm always willing to give a new place a try. And really, how hard is it to mess up a bacon cheeseburger.  Boy was I wrong. Holy smokes, this is a seriously bad burger. Like, I couldn't finish it bad. For starters, I asked for medium well, and the patty had way too much pink in the middle - medium rare at best (and that's being generous). The burger was dry like a desert with hardly any sauce or ketchup or anything on it. And it was topped off with just one tepid, wilted leaf of lettuce. I'm a burger slut and a very forgiving one at that - but forget about future visits. If I'm going to drop 10+ bucks on a burger, I'll walk the 300 feet across the parking lot to Red Robin, where they know how put one together."
Laurie V.,"Seattle, WA",33,24,5,1.0,6/10/2013,Great place if you prefer bland food or sickeningly sweet sauces. For me it was reminiscent of an upscale Denny's with much higher prices. Nothing special to me jumps out about the food. Other than thinking I could make this at home. Personally when I go out I like to have flavors I wouldn't make at home.
Paul N.,"Bothell, WA",81,239,3,2.0,5/10/2013,"Very disappointing. My wife's family lives in Southern California and we try to make it to BJs whenever we go to visit. So we were excited to hear they were opening up in Redmond. It was PACKED, impossible to hear the mousy little waitress over the crowd noise and the bass of whatever music they were playing. We finally got our order in and then sat and waited....and waited.....and waited. 40 minutes later our pizza came out. The pizza was merely OK.....nothing I couldn't have gotten for a fraction of the cost at MOD Pizza (Sorry...that sounds like I am not a fan of MOD....quite the contrary). For the money BJs charges for a pizza, you would expect something that blows your taste buds out of your mouth and then they slap you around from sheer awesomeness. About the only thing we didn't have to wait for was our check. And holy crap what a bill it was! 60 bucks for 2 adults and a kid! Unacceptable for sub par pizza. I think I will wait to try BJs again when I am visiting the in laws on Southern California."
Hillary F.,"Redmond, WA",0,2,1,1.0,4/5/2014,"Went into the bar it was fairly empty, sat in a booth. Waited 10 minutes after asking twice to have it clear ed of dishes, and someine else's bill. We Ordered ice teas no Lemon. Ice tea was good. Ordered calamri it was disgusting. Husband ordered buffalo wings. It was like taking store bought wings and throwing them in the oven ... Not good. I ordered the fish and chips. Only ate one piece. Breading was crispy, burnt and dried out the cod. They didn't have starter sauce instead I got something else that was pink. Gross. Husband got a jalapeno burger. No jalapeno s except in the cheese.  Burger was average. Best part of lunch was the ice tea. Go to claim jumper next door."
Whitney W.,"San Francisco, CA",28,38,,1.0,5/12/2013,This place was truly awful. Went for Mother's Day - we called ahead and were told it would be a n hour wait - arrived and had to wait an additional hour. Our appetizers took an hour to come out and when our main meals finally came everything was cold and bland. The manager came up to apologize but neglected to comp any of the meal. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will certainly not be back.
Heidi L.,"Bellevue, WA",57,29,12,1.0,3/2/2014,"Didn't get a chance to try anything here. We walked in, and was greeted by a girl that was ok... I asked to be seated at the bar and as I was halfway through my sentence she talks over me to explain that they are clearing a table now. Not thinking it weird i watch them clear a table in the bar. Only to be given to a couple who walked right. I ask the snot nosed brat why we didn't get the table and she says. OH! You wanted a seat at the bar?! Oh that's open seating! She asks if we want to sit there. I pause biting my tongue and say. No we are done here. So you all know... If ya want to sit with adults just walk in and don't bother with the snot nosed brat."
JT M.,"Kirkland, WA",0,43,,2.0,9/29/2013,"Summary:  OK service, truck stop quality food, confusing menu, very overpriced This places figures that bad service will not matter because it will be like 30 years before everyone in Redmond has tried the place and no one comes back. For $40 here is what we got 1) Manager saying happy hour was actually available late on a Saturday because the Stanford game was on.  Wait person said happy hour was not available.  We got to wait 20 minutes until their ""computer was reprogrammed to allow happy hour prices"" 2) Menu with so many choices it is impossible to decide (limited healthy choices) 3) Jalapeno burger (with substituted salad) - nothing special here - you get 2 little chunks of Jalapeno 4) Chicken sandwich  5) Beers (only ok part of meal)  I still don't get how places like this make it..."
Ka M.,"Jackson, MS",4,130,2,1.0,6/8/2013,"Went to the BJ's in Redmond, WA today with my family for the first time ever. Possibly worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. We waited over an hour and ten minutes to be seated (after being told 45 minutes) and then were treated poorly by the hostesses. We were sat in a booth that was not clean and still had the last customer's check there. We ordered food....3 of our entrees came (well partially as my brother's sandwich arrived without fries), the fourth one did not. My mother had to ask the waitress three times for her soup and salad. When she finally received her soup (a solid 20 minutes after the rest of us received our entrees), she was not given a spoon. Then she asked for one. 10 minutes later still no spoon. My father even attempted to get up and locate a spoon. When the waitress finally returned to our table (after knowingly leaving hot soup on a table without a spoon, she continued to take orders etc...), she snidely informed us that no spoons were available as they were ALL in the dishwasher....riiiiight. Honestly I would never return to this place again. The food was okay, but the service was so poor. I don't enjoy being treated like dirt when I go out to eat.  Yes we said something to the manager... (he was very nice but very young and in over his head)."
Erika J.,"Fairfax, VA",152,2,,1.0,7/24/2013,"In short: After 45 minutes of waiting, our food came out COLD. Strongly advise not going here. If you'd like more horrendous details, continue reading the story. I was in Redmond for a training, and a group of five of us went over to BJ's for lunch. We got there around 12:15, thinking we would be done in 45 minutes. We gave our orders, and before we knew it it was 12:45 and our food had still not come out. We notified our waiter that we needed our food to be put in to-go boxes and the checks brought out immediately. He was apologetic, and sent the manager over to us, who also apologized; she gave excuses about a large party, and explained to us that the chicken tacos were all that were left to cook, and that she would take off the appetizer from the bill - except we didn't order an appetizer. When the check came we thought we'd see something come off, but the manager didn't take anything off - sneaky much? I then notified the waiter that the manager did not take anything off our bill. 10 minutes later, our food came out and our check went down by $20. We thought that was acceptable considering how long we had to wait, and the fact that we would now have to eat during our training. We got to our training 5 minutes late. When we got back to our office, we opened the food and there were no utensils for the salads we ordered, salads which had no dressing on them. No napkins. And the food was COLD; my flat bread was SOGGY. Why was the food cold and soggy if it took 45 MINUTES to get to us?? Likely because it was just SITTING there until someone got around to cooking chicken for the tacos - something you wouldn't think would take that long. I wouldn't have written this review based on my experience in the first paragraph, but cold food is COMPLETELY unacceptable in ANY situation, and it disgusts me that they just kept our food out for a long period of time. $20 off will never make up for the fact that our food was cold and unsatisfying. I wish there was a rating of less than 1 star for BJ's. Our training team of 30 people was considering going to BJs for a large group dinner, but we STRONGLY dismissed the suggestion. And I would also advise anyone going there for a 1hr lunch against it as well. And any group of more than 1 against it because who knows when they'll finish the whole order, and how long your food will just be sitting on a counter, getting cold and soggy."
Joedinho M.,"Redmond, WA",0,30,,1.0,7/7/2014,"Food made my dad and I sick. Would not come here again based on that alone.  Additionally, ... Food tasted like frozen food prepared in a microwave.  Server was MIA after we put our order in. Didn't get silverware, never got our drinks refilled.  Their signature Pizookie is terrible."
Justin D.,"Duvall, WA",0,7,,1.0,6/23/2013,"Lunch took 50 minutes to arrive for our party of 4.  One of us had to wait an additional 10 minutes to be served.  Then we found a fingernail in our food.  Manager offered a $25 gift card as an apology, but we still had to pay for lunch."
Craig J.,"Issaquah, WA",21,140,,2.0,6/15/2013,"A few weeks ago, I left a four star review.  We knew the place was new and having teething problems and I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Returned today and nothing has improved.  Maybe become worse. Lots of receptionists standing up front that acted unsure of why they were even there. Server was polite but after ordering, it took over a HALF HOUR before our mediocre food arrived. If you enjoy mediocre chain restaurant fare, love waiting forever for your meals to arrive and you like constantly being ""upsold"" on drinks, appetizers and desserts, this is a place you will probably enjoy. We tried twice and probably will not return. EDIT: The BJ management should visit the new RAM restaurant in the Issaquah Highlands. RAM got it right and they are what BJ's should aspire to becoming."
