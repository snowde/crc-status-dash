Jamie M.,"Sammamish, WA",111,36,4,1.0,10/20/2013,"We eat out in Redmond several times a week. We have been to BJs about 15 times. EVERYTIME the service is horrible. I thought it was their growing pains, but it has not gotten any better....ive got more bad experience stories than I can be bothered to wrote on my phone....."
Angela W.,"Bellevue, WA",114,61,,4.0,5/31/2013,"I had never heard of this place but my friend and I decided to try it for lunch.  I got a booth in the bar and kind of looked the joint over.  It was nice, clean, big, pretty, and BUSY!  So that was a good sign... The front desk was polite, helpful and friendly.  I seated myself in the bar and was waited on Immediately.  He explained the beer selection, the menu and all the specials, like Happy Hour, Drinks, Special Cocktails and that all Day on Tuesdays was half off wine.  He recommended a few beers and I chose a nice one.   We had an appetizer which came quickly, was hot and was very delicious.  The meals are big, and so far very tasty!  I asked for my meal to be a bit specialized, no mayo, my friend asked for dressing on the side.. NO problem.  They were happy to accommodate.  The prices are decent, the menu big, the portions big and since it was my first time ever hearing of this restaurant and eating there... I give it 4 stars because everything about that one lunch was perfect.    I see a lot of people are giving it a bad review but my experience really was quite nice.  I will go again.  I want to sit in the bar, mingle, meet some people maybe try a small event here and see how it shows it.  I would recommend you try it at least once and see how your experience is."
Marie S.,"Bellevue, WA",15,54,39,4.0,5/7/2013,"I don't know what Tracy (reviewer) had but the portions were quite hefty.  Food is pretty good for brew pub food, staff is friendly.  Gave it a 4 because they need to work out staffing confusion due to the newness.    Otherwise happy to have another venue for lunch in Redmond Town center!"
Ashley C.,"Redmond, WA",15,60,35,2.0,7/24/2013,"Although I love the avocado rolls and the great white pizza, the service is terrible at this location. It is surprising because its pretty new. when we came in our waitress was less than patient as she took our order. My brother ordered a drink and she brought out all the waters and never came back with his drink. No one came by to refill our waters. if I'm ever craving bjs again I'm just gonna call in my order and pick it up."
K B.,"Redmond, WA",0,15,2,2.0,5/20/2015,"BJ's in Redmond is very disappointing and it never ceases to surprise me that gets so much business. The food is below average at best and the wait staff is among the worst I have ever encountered. We have gone here are couple of times to watch sporting events, and even when the place is half empty you almost need to refuse to order anything to get the waiters to put the game on the screen you are watching. The first time we went, one of the wait staff tried to ""be one of the guys"" and teasingly called one of my buddies ""buttercup"", he still hasn't lived that nickname down to this day. While that was funny for us, one doesn't really expect to go out to dinner and be made fun of by the waiter. Functionally the television screens also are not in a good location to see the game and when I used to watch games here I'd always come home with a sore neck, it really isn't a good place to watch a sports game. Also, It is frequently over-crowded and you need to wait for tables. Also, this is only place I have ever had fish and chips in the north-west that tasted burnt, that dish was inedible. Silver Lining for Bj's and the reason for 2 stars instead of 1: The avocado spring rolls are pretty good, the Pizookie is interesting, and their house beers are decent."
Heather B.,"Redmond, WA",0,7,2,1.0,1/13/2015,"I went here for dinner with my mom and the service was extremely slow, it was even a week day and not very busy. We both ordered the same thing, spaghetti. Neither of us have ever had 'bad' spaghetti, but we found it here. We won't be going back because the service and food were less than satisfactory."
Cindy S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,25,,5.0,5/4/2013,"11th visit still as good.  But you must be a fan of Chicago style deep dish PIZZA!!!  The  Beer & TV are better that all others nearby.  For Sounders and Sea-hawks they will do  Happy Hour during the games.  Happy Hour is better than most,   I do the mini pizza  Hum-mm! HINT! You must try their original world famous  deep dish pizza served in the original and famous BLACK DEEP  DISH PAN, even if you order a  personal mini  size.  Now days, you need to ask for the pan.  It just taste better."
Heather H.,"Sammamish, WA",1,2,,1.0,7/25/2014,"I used to work here. The management is the worst that I have ever experienced. I understand that it is the Resteraunt business, but that doesn't mean that your employees should be treated like barn animals and with such angry tones all of the time. Your customers notice this by the way, the better you treat your staff the better they treat their work place. People literally would quit on the spot leaving other employees having to figure out what the heck to do that day without the managers help really. When I've come in as a customer recently my SALAD took forty minutes to arrive? Let's be real, it's some leaves and dressing. I knew it was my last day working there when the kitchen manager just decided not to show up for work one Tuesday. Don't go here unless you want food that sits on the belt for an hour before it's served and then over priced. By the way, those pazookies you love? Ya the staff has to reach into the ice cream bucket with their whole arm (hairy arms and all) to retrieve that one perfect scoop. Their hands may be washed but are their whole arms? Food for though from someone behind the scenes."
Andy R.,"Carnation, WA",0,30,2,2.0,4/7/2014,"I am only giving 2 stars because our server Erich was incredibly awesome!  However, I would take off all 5 stars before I was even sat down. We came in late on Sunday night as a party of 6. There was no one waiting and there were plenty of open tables visible. The hostess told me that there was a table open but it needed to be cleaned. ""no problem"" I told her, however waiting 25 minutes for someone to accomplish that task is absurd.  The hostess was obviously flustered and could tell that we were not happy but appeared that she was not supposed to leave her post. In that 25 minutes I never saw anyone come and check in with her, where is the management? I work in  the industry and am baffled as to why it would take that amount of time to bus a table?????  The food was fine. The service I have had here before has been so-so but tonight was fantastic!  I will be back but not too excited about it."
Jason G.,"Kirkland, WA",0,1,,1.0,5/8/2015,"Went here with my dad and we each ordered beer and the California burger, and both of us ordered well done burgers.  The burgers come cut in half.  I ate about 2/3 of the first half, leaving the remainder as it was very pink.  The second half of the burger was nearly inedible, and was pink the whole way through.  The fact that I specified ""well-done"" and was given a nearly completely pink burger is beyond me.  The waiter never commented about the fact that I had eaten less than half of the burger and had obviously pink meat.  The service here is subpar at best, and the cooks obviously cannot cook to order."
Tracey W.,"Bothell, WA",0,71,21,2.0,5/6/2014,"I wanted to like this place. It's just not that great. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. We had shrimp tacos and wings. They tasted fine and everything, just not much better than a Red Robin. The service wasn't that great. Our server wasn't really attentive. The drinks were expensive for what they were. It's too bad because the location is pretty good."
Jarmarcus P.,"Bothell, WA",0,3,,1.0,1/11/2014,"I have to say the service there was extremely poor . They were not busy at all and it took until we got our food for one of my friends to get their water. We asked for it multiple times. As for our refills on our drinks they were empty but they never asked if we were in need of a refill. We had to repeatedly ask before we received a refill. We looked around for our waiter to refill our drinks, but the waiters stood in a circle and just talked amongst themselves. And there was probably only 4 groups of people in the whole restaurant including us. Good food bad service"
Sharron F.,"Redmond, WA",0,22,,2.0,1/7/2016,"My husband specifically ordered his food without sauce- and asked for it on the side. No big deal- he does that all the time because of the sugar content of sauce. The food arrived WITH the sauce but my dinner arrived at the same time. We waited for TWENTY minutes for his meal to be fixed which came long after I was done. We fully expected the bill to have some sort of adjustment since sitting watching someone else eat and then having them watching you eat is not what you expect at a restaurant.  But then the bill came and no attempt at ALL was made to adjust for the error of the server or preparer. In fact, the server couldn't have thrown that bill on the table fast enough. It was sort of shocking- we still tipped him, but it was probably his fault. The management should have a CLEAR policy on how to handle screwed up orders. We certainly had no control over it.  We just won't go back for a while but really? Be nicer to your customers when you have an order done improperly."
Bo C.,"Snohomish, WA",172,78,13,4.0,3/4/2014,Well it looks like from the other reviews that you either have a really good experience or a really bad one. Fortunately for me my visit was one of the good ones. Their BBQ chicken pizza is really good and they have a really good selection of beers (that are tasty I might add). The cocktails are over priced though (see 4 star rating) for a relatively average drink you are paying something similar to that of a top shelf drink or maybe a sporting event. The staff was very friendly so over all it was a good trip.
Stephen L.,"Redmond, WA",2,10,,5.0,8/11/2013,"I did not read the reviews until just now ... ( why the low rating after all? ) We came on Sat around 2pm ... Hugh restaurant with big TVs ... We ordered the $19.95 ribs and chicken for 2 meal, and kids got kids meal.  Surprising all the food are good.  Big portion for ribs/chicken ( and we thought the price $19.95 is for each person with the portion but no ... $19.95 for 2 persons ).  Server came often to check with us ... Really a good experience and we definitely will come back ..."
Kimmie E.,"Woodinville, WA",0,3,,3.0,10/17/2014,"No comp for a wrong order with food allergies.  We came in on a busy Friday night and were excited for the food we had eaten in prior visits. We decided to give this place a chance to redeem themselves did poor service in the past. I ordered the gluten free pizza with no cheese as I'm lactose intolerant and even requested extra sauce to make up for the lack of cheese and dry crust. The server seemed to understand my food allergy. I also requested the pizza to be slightly under cooked as in previous experience, they pretty much burned the crust.  Not only did my pizza come with cheese but when they finally did bring me my pizza 15 minutes later, no extra sauce and neither the server or the food runner offered to comp my meal or offer a free round of drinks. Not cool.  We enjoy the food but service and general common courtesy  is unacceptable. I hope the general manager or corporate is reading this and recognizes we will spread the word of bad service."
Eneri S.,"Woodinville, WA",4,285,,5.0,1/24/2014,"I've been here about half a dozen times and the service has been excellent every time. I always order the Santa Fe rolls for appetizers. Excellent flavor. I've tried their pizzas, corn fritters, mac and cheese, potato skins and pizookie. All served fresh and warm."
Rick J.,"Sammamish, WA",0,2,,2.0,6/27/2013,"Pretty, but is just another chain restaurant.  Decent prices but, you get what you pay for.  Nothing special."
Pavel Z.,"Redmond, WA",0,6,3,5.0,3/29/2015,"Great place to go with kids, you would be surprised how many of them around at lunch time on weekends"
Kitty B.,"Duvall, WA",0,3,,1.0,11/3/2013,"Do not recommend! Ambiance- 4 star Food-1 star Service-1 star Where can one start to list all the issues and highly do not recommend this restaurant.  First of all appetizers did not arrived until 40 mins of placing order and after checking with the manager we found out that it was placed with the main order.  Another 10 mins the food arrived, no chicken on the chicken salads; the Cajun salad the shrimp was slimmy and very salty did not dare to eat more than 2 bites in fear of getting food poisoning.  After checking in with the manager, he mentioned that he was getting additional chicken for the salads...they never arrived.  What makes it even more comical, the table behind me was also having issues and also was speaking to the manager.  I wish I had looked up the review scores before checking out this restaurant.  I will be very surprised if they last much longer with review scores like this.  What was good one might ask?  The ambience...."
