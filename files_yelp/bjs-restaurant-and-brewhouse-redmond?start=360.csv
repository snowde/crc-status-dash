Andrea L.,"Seattle, WA",10,19,,2.0,1/14/2014,"I've been to this location for a couple of occasions and unfortunately - the service lacked for both. The first was the worst - we came for Mother's Day after they had first opened.  The long waits were hard, especially having young toddlers, we couldn't keep them still.  The food was out maybe 45 minutes to an hour after we ordered.  They remembered all the entrees...except my Mom's.  We were on a limited time schedule to keep the kids in line with their bedtimes and not wanting to wait another 45 minutes, my mom declined to have them bring make a new order.  Instead they offered to box it up for her to take home, which we agreed.  The wait for the food to come in a box was just as long and they were kind enough to give my mom a $15 gift card for her next visit.  When the bill came, my mom's entree was still on the check -  we were appalled.  I understand coming from the hospitality industry that the gift card is meant as a compensation, but I don't think they should have charged her at all.  She declined to have them bring it out after they forgot her entree, then they kept pressing to bring it to her in a to-go box so they could still charge for the entree.   I will say the food is average to good, depending on what you get.  The menus are so large it's overwhelming and the beers are decent.   When my fiancee and another friend rode our bikes along the Burke-Gilman we decided to try the restaurant again.  The same service was provided - or lack thereof.  You wouldn't see your server for 10-15 minutes and almost had to flag down anyone you could find.  I won't be coming back here until they get a grip on good service and timeliness.  If you ask me, their kitchen has issues executing their restaurant within a timely manner.  They couldn't even open the nicely designed outdoor patio because it would have made their restaurant far too large for the kitchen to handle (which is what the server told us when we wanted to sit outside)."
Shaman S.,"Sammamish, WA",0,3,,1.0,7/30/2013,"This place needs a complete management overhaul, starting from the top. Disorganized, long waits (even when the restaurant is empty) and atrocious service. I always had good experience in Dallas with BJs, however this location is by far the worst. We bring our customers here and sadly it is embarrassing. There are better restaurants within walking distance of this location.  Horrible experience for the last 5 times we have been here...seems to get worse every time. Front desk and some waiters seem disoriented. If you ignored the wait times for food and service, you definitely cannot ignore COLD french fries and mixed up orders."
Randy T.,"Redmond, WA",0,21,,1.0,7/26/2013,Terrible. The food is worse than Red Robin and the beer tastes like someone poured a Budweiser into a microbrew. The service was slow; 10 minutes+ to get a beer at lunchtime!    Would not recommend going or going back. This is just another crappy restaurant who tries to do everything(i.e. server every type of customer) while  jumping on the microbrew trend.
Bj M.,"Snoqualmie, WA",40,47,15,1.0,7/17/2014,"So dark inside you can hardly see the people you're sitting with. Ordered a ""bj's brew house burger"" and mahi mahi tacos. The burger was so far from being cooked a good vet could have brought it back to life! Was even pink on the out side...not just a lil pink in the middle. Sent it back n got another one that was then mashed so thin and so well done it was like a sloppy joe, falling a part. The bun was good. The flavor was good but overall disappointing since id eaten my tacos by the time his 2nd burger came out. Tacos were ok. Could have used more actual fish, at least more fish than coleslaw would be good. Couldn't find the fish under all the lettuce in a large, mostly unused, tortilla. And the cups with sauce n salsa in them were too tiny to actually dip the chips in. Over all...WON'T BE BACK. Bummer. Really just wanted a good lunch out somewhere new. They did comp the burger but weren't super apologetic."
Lora L.,"Edmonds, WA",15,77,38,4.0,6/16/2013,I was hesitant to try this place because of the low reviews but decided to give it a shot. Even though the wait was long once we got seated everything else went smoothly. The menu is huge so there's a lot of things to choose from. The Mahi mahi fish tacos were very tasty along with the avocado wrap and even though i didn't try it the Thai lettuce wraps looked good as well. Everyone enjoyed their food at our table so I will definitely be back!
Mike R.,"Redmond, WA",7,87,20,1.0,7/4/2014,"We just ate here recently, and I must say, I was very disappointed in the service. The hostess was not very friendly and our server was probably the worst I have had in any restaurant in the last 9 years of eating out. Service was slow, which is fine as long as the service is friendly, but our waiter was extremely unfriendly, and seemed upset with us when we did not order any alcoholic beverages. We needed an extra napkin setting, as there was 3 of us, and only 2 settings, and when we asked for it, he said rudely ""fine...I'll get you one""...he never did, another waiter had to do it. Finally our food came (food itself was good). After we finished, we waited 20 minutes for him to show up, and after he brought the check, and as he cleared our plates, he got upset that a fork was still on a plate and pointed at my friend to remove it. He was extremely unfriendly. To give you an idea how bad the service was, this was the first time in 9 years that I did not leave a 20% tip. I always leave a 20% tip as a general rule of thumb, even if service is slow (as long as it's friendly). I still left a tip (10%), but perhaps I should not have left anything. With so many other restaurants in this area, I will never return to BJs again. I do not recommend this place at all. Look at the Yelp reviews...it seems to be a common problem at this BJs. The BJs in Southern California are all so fantastic."
Kelly H.,"Medina, WA",0,1,,5.0,2/7/2015,So Excited to find a BJs in WA! Excellent as always! Mmmm S'mores Pizookie. Wait staff was very friendly and attentive. My Daughter loves coming here after basketball games. They were very kind and patient as we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. Plus you cant beat their homemade rootbeer!!!!!!!!
Nick S.,"Sammamish, WA",0,61,11,1.0,5/29/2013,"Rough! I might try this place again when they get their feet on the ground. First experience at BJs and it was pretty bad. If your going to call yourself a ""BREWHOUSE"" you need to know your beers!!!! I asked what Nirto-beers they have on tap? Completely blank look on the waitress' face. Her reply, ""I think we only have one or two."" They actually ended up having 5. And the 2 she listed were not Nitro-beers and did not include Guinness. WOW!!! Lol!!!  KNOW YOUR BEERS!!! Its not that difficult."
Dan P.,"Sammamish, WA",0,4,,1.0,6/18/2013,"I was very disappointed in the this experience.  My wife and I went there for lunch. Food: My wife thought her club sandwich was ok, but the bread was soaked through with butter.  I ordered the pork chop and when it finally arrived was very disappointed.  The meat was overcooked and dry and the portion was tiny.  They apparently ran out of ingredients for my original drink order.  When the drinks finally did come, my wife was given the wrong one. Service: We were seated relatively quickly, but there was a slight mixup where we were stranded in the middle of the dining room while the host tried to figure out where we were supposed to end up.  Getting our food took forever.  I sat and watched people who arrived after us get their food, finish eating, and get the bill before our food came.  The waitress made some excuse about the beans not being cooked properly, so they had to re-do them.  Apparently they forgot to take the pork off the grill while re-doing the beans. All in all, looks like the BJs in Redmond is a great candidate for the next season of Kitchen Nightmares."
Jonas H.,"Kirkland, WA",0,1,,1.0,1/16/2015,"We decided to meet up there for my birthday with friends last night at the Redmond location. I hadn't been there for a year or so cause of bad service experiences but figured we'd give it another shot cause we need space for strollers etc. We got in quick cause of our reservation. We had a variety of food choices which all came out alright (I've had both worse and better steaks). However, the roasted asparagus side should be avoided as it was shriveled up and puny. Service was also horrendous. Desserts came out at separate times, drinks remained empty for prolonged periods, and after receiving our bill it took us another 45-50 minutes for waiter to get our bill settled so we could leave, on a school night I might add. There were other issues and it was very hard for me to want to leave a tip. I will not be going back to this BJs in the future because of the embarrassing experience."
Carly C.,"Seattle, WA",101,265,108,4.0,7/18/2013,"Not too shabby! Good lunch time deals, gluten free menu & the out waitress was great."
Erich K.,"Kirkland, WA",12,3,,5.0,8/19/2013,"Every time I eat here I am always blown away, service is really good.I have never had a bad experience or had to wait to long for food. Friday and Saturday nights are understandable as to why there could be an extended wait (because of how busy it always is). I would highly suggest this restaurant to any body, all there food is delicious and with a huge menu there is a wide variety of selections, always great to have options."
Tyler S.,"Redmond, WA",0,24,,1.0,9/4/2014,This place could be so much better. The food is just ok and its way overpriced. Great beer selection but that's not enough for me to go back. I love the look of the joint and parking is easy but I would eat next door.
Yi X.,"Sammamish, WA",47,5,2,5.0,8/9/2014,"We  had brewhouse burger, pizza and pasta. Food is great. Jememiah red taste pretty good. Our waiter is really really nice and patient."
John V.,"Redmond, WA",63,121,15,4.0,7/31/2013,"This place is quite big and has awesome outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating has TVs as well, which is really cool.  The menu is quite large with many different choices.  I had the Jalapeno burger and the wedge fries.  Very tasty.  I heard the Pizzas as really good, one person in my party had the BBQ and loved it.  Their deep dish was recommended as well.  I need to go back and try a couple other menu items."
Janet S.,"Redmond, WA",0,26,,4.0,10/19/2014,"I was nervous about trying this place because of all the bad reviews, but four of us sat in a booth in the bar this past Thursday night and had very good service. I loved the layout and feel of the place. My husband enjoyed the beer selection. I liked my fish tacos (the grilled fish was better than the fried - I had one of each). Happy hour goes until 7 pm, which was a pleasant surprise. We'll be back!"
Susan P.,"Seattle, WA",0,29,1,1.0,8/7/2015,"I went to bj's last night and tried to order a peach margarita and they were out of peach flavoring, so I had to order the strawberry lemonade which was good. Then I ordered the cherry salmon, which was tasty but didn't have the cherry glaze like the picture in the menu. Also it came with asparagus that was extremely thin and wilted looking like old veggies you would toss out at home, not appetizing looking at all so I didn't eat it. My fiancé ordered a steak and potatoes that came with wilted asparagus also. The steak was good but small and the potato tasted like it wasn't cooked long enough.  Also the wait for the food to come both times was extremely slow. The first time we were told after what seemed like 20 or so minutes our food wasn't even made yet. When we came back it took like another 20 minutes or so for our food to come. And like other reviewers we had to ask for water instead of being offered. Also there wasn't any bread given out like other restaurants do to eat with your food. The quality of their food did not match their high prices. And after reading other reviews of people's bad experience not sure I will be returning."
Erika H.,"Woodinville, WA",0,8,1,4.0,10/17/2013,"Never had a problem here except when we order potato skins and only want sour cream to dip in. For whatever reason the computer system they use to enter our order always tells the cooks that we want plain skins with just sour cream on them, I'm sorry but i like my bacon, chives, and cheese. The servers always apologize and fix our orders fast. Sometimes waiting can be a pain but join the rewards club and call ahead. I really enjoy the food and seasonal drinks!"
Cliff H.,"Sammamish, WA",0,2,,1.0,12/19/2014,"Have been to BJ @ Jansen Beach Portland several times and have always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. I was looking forward to visiting the new BJ and had the chance to do so when out Christmas shopping last night. This was without a doubt the worst experience I've had dining in years. The food was poor, Calamari tasted like two day old bait with a strong aftertaste, chicken wings were messy with several pieces with broken bones and the flat bread pizza was almost absent on any toppings. Wait help was totally unhelpful , short and some what rude. I would give this adventure a zero is possible, we won't be back."
Ksenia C.,"Yorktown, VA",34,181,133,4.0,8/24/2014,went for a yummy breakfast brunch and it was great. not many people. and chill atmosphere. great food. mimosas are awesome!
