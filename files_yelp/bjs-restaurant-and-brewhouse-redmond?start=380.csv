Curt C.,"Kirkland, WA",9,8,,4.0,7/13/2013,"The call ahead system worked well.  It was a busy Friday night so we called in for a 7pm and were seated about 7:10; passing 15 or so ""walk-up"" customers.  We were seated promptly. The key IMO to dining in this type of establishment is to be ready to order.  We ordered drinks ASAP and they came promptly, and with glasses of ice water ...  only complaint would be warm glasses for the pitcher of beer; but we just poured our ice water into the beer glasses and used our water glasses for beer.  Their IPA is quite good for an in-house brewed beer Our sandwiches and burgers were tasty and generously portioned, got extra pickles, no problem.  All in all a good addition to the Redmond casual dining repertoire."
T B.,"Seattle, WA",0,45,3,2.0,7/12/2013,"Looked forward to BJ's opening to give another alternative for mid-range dining.  Waited until it had been open a few weeks.  Went in on a weekday night.  Wait was not bad, about 20 minutes.  The lobby is not well designed to hold large queues so most people were waiting on the sidewalk.   Good things: Free pizza sample while you wait.  Was good because it answered my question whether I should order pizza.  The answer is no, the crust is thick and tasteless and toppings sparse. However- the flatbread is quite good, thin crust and good flavor. Beer selection was excellent and their red ale was very good.  Bad things: Repeated shilling of their ""frequent flier"" club.  One ""no"" should be enough.  Tiny table crowded with table tents and other junk.  Not much room for food. My pot roast sandwich was skimpy on the pot roast, heavy on the way too salty gravy. Service was slow, they were understaffed and undertrained."
Cory C.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,2.0,10/18/2015,"the menu is huge and the food is decent...  the service however, was pretty awful.  not even busy and it was well staffed but waited forever for service.  will not be returning."
Chris F.,"Redmond, WA",0,3,,2.0,5/29/2013,"I have been pleased with the food and service at the Tukwila location. The Redmond store has a long way to go. The food took forever. My steak was dry and cold. My lobster was the size of a prawn, and was overcooked. I understand that most of these bugs should be worked out in the next few months, and will reserve final judgement until i have tried them one more time in about 3-6 months. One bonus was that the waitstaff was attentive. The experience fell far short of the cost of the meal. My hopes are for their success. Redmond lacks in quality dining experiences."
Korey S.,"Snoqualmie, WA",0,27,,3.0,7/15/2014,"Been here a couple times and once to a different location. The food is good. There's a good variety so it's a good place for a group. I love their fish tacos and drove 30 minutes from home just for them. The place seemed busy for a Monday night, I assume others didn't want to cook in the rare hot summer day. It was just my daughter and I, so the wait was to be ten minutes. After sitting and chatting for a while we noticed a lot of new faces around us, and none of the people that came around the same time as us. We realized 30 minutes had passed. When I told the host we felt forgotten, he confirmed that we were not on the list. He was very apologetic and got us seated right away. I understand that mistakes happen, but I felt they should have offered us dessert on the house or something for the error. Our waiter was actually kind of rude when we wanted to order our food when he came to take our drink order. Waiting that long for a table, we were hungry. Ate quickly and left. The fish tacos were good as always, but service was really off. My first visit to BJ`S was highlighted with a marriage proposal from our waiter, so I have high expectations. Tonights visit was not up to par. It will be a while before we try again."
Julie H.,"Redmond, WA",0,6,,2.0,5/27/2013,"We went in to get some lunch about 1:45 on Memorial Day afternoon. They were busy, but it seemed to be running pretty smoothly. There was maybe a 10 minute wait to sit down. In a nutshell:  1. No, I do not want nachos. No, REALLY, I do not want nachos. How about some help with the ridiculous menu?   2. It doesn't matter how you order a burger, apparently they all come charred, well done.  3. When I order a ""bleu cheese"" burger, I expect more than one bleu cheese crumble. One tiny, lonely, abandoned little crumble, in a little smear of what appeared to be dressing (about an inch in diameter.)  Seriously? 4. When I've waited 30 minutes for my burger, and I am starving, I am not about to send it back to the kitchen. Who knows when or if I might see it again? The food wasn't bad; It was just OK. The service was slow. They charged my spouse for two drinks instead of one. Our visit lasted an hour and 20 minutes  - and we had a burger, fries and a drink.  They haven't worked out the kinks at this restaurant yet - far from it. I'll probably give them another shot at some point, but I'll wait a while."
Bill B.,"Bothell, WA",1,16,,1.0,8/5/2013,"We ordered nachos and they came out with barely any cheese on them so sent them back and ordered flat bread.  When we talked to the manager he said he would get our new order right out.  30 minutes later the flat bread came out with mostly bread and a small amount of meat and cheese.  The waitress said the manager decided not to charge us for the nachos and made no offer to correct the second offer.  We were not happy with the lack of concern, lack of fixing the problem, and no offer of desert or some off our drinks to make up for two cheese barren offers."
Jeff D.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,44,,1.0,7/15/2013,"horrific service. I was so excited when this place opened near my office, as I have visited their California locations and always enjoyed them.......... Man, how far off this place is. I've visited a total of 5 times since they opened, and each time the service has been awful. Just plain awful. Food has been decent each time, but the service is so bad here I can't bring myself to go back to this location."
Patrick K.,"Sammamish, WA",2,22,,1.0,3/13/2014,Dropped in for dessert one evening.  Upon using the restroom I found out there was no running water.  Confirmed it was throughout the restaurant but they were still operating.  How was the staff washing their hands???
Tracy D.,"Redmond, WA",7,3,,1.0,5/6/2013,"Do not bother. Food is super expensive, portions small, no happy hour offered throughout the restaurant(bar only). Ten dollars specialty drinks(weak). Our server decided that it was not a good day to wash her hair or make sure her nail polish was not chipped(and that a different color for each nail was a good idea) on opening day. That is a clear indication of how much the servers care about the appearance of the restaurant and themselves(and customers). You want to charge that much? Make sure your servers bathe!"
Steven B.,"Redmond, WA",0,11,,1.0,11/16/2013,"Horrifyingly bad food, even worse service.  The staff is wandering around in a daze. Forgot to bring out our appetizer. My burger was practically raw.  We will not be returning."
Priya P.,"Seattle, WA",18,44,1,1.0,10/2/2013,Gave them another chance with relatives from out of town. Mistakes on drink order and they didn't offer to fix it... We had to ask. Took about 15 minutes just to get our drinks and over 45 minutes (still waiting) for food. Waitress comes by every 15 minutes on average.... And that is me bring generous. Am I really at BJ's? Others are so much better. Months later...this place still is much below par. What is going on!?
Ben N.,"Issaquah, WA",1,6,3,1.0,7/17/2013,"The service was awfully slow.  It took 45 minutes for the food to come out, and it was wrong order.  It took another 15 minutes before I got my food.  I don't plan to go back any time soon.  It is not worth money and time."
jake b.,"Sammamish, WA",0,19,6,1.0,8/19/2013,"I ordered the biggest, most expensive burger available. The double deluxe.  Despite the place being less than half full, it took well over an hour to get. I can't imagine the wait if the place was full, but after tasting the burger, I wouldn't expect them to ever convince that many people to eat there anyway.  The burger meat was completely flavorless and fell apart immediately, along with the bun. The resulting pile of soggy meat-bread had one slimy strip of undercooked bacon sticking out and I had to add several condiments just to flavor the pile enough to eat half with a fork and give up on the rest.  Because I paid for the deluxe, a very small pile of fries was included, cold by the time I got it, and no refills.  I can honestly say that I should have gone to any fast food place around and pay 1/4 the price of this place for better tasting food.  I will never walk through their front door again.  Claimjumper is right next door and they have always been awesome."
Korry B.,"Bothell, WA",0,2,,1.0,1/3/2014,"12/30/2013  we had reservation for 5:30 pm. We met other family members at BJ's for a Christmas dinner gathering. I wished I had found somewhere else to go!!!   We were sat down in a timely manner and that was as good as it got. For the longest time no one ever came to talk to us (there were 10 of us) It's not like you could miss us!  Finally a young man came over to greet us, we told him our frustrations. He apologize and told us he was not sure who was supposed to be taking our order but he would do it.  1/2 the table ordered water to drink which seemed to take longer than the soda the other 1/2 ordered. Our salads were mixed up with one person  never even receiving her salad until AFTER the meals showed up. Then upon receiving her meal (and salad) they missed giving her stuff to put on her baked potato, which came about the time everyone was done. Another person didn't received her blackened chicken that was supposed to go on her pasta, it was eventually brought out, but we scratched our heads as to why it wasn't  on to begin with?!  The hamburgers were extremely salty, this coming from 6 people that ordered burgers, so whoever was seasoning their hamburger needs to back off a lot on the salt. So salty they couldn't eat them. I will NOT recommend this place to anyone."
John O.,"Sammamish, WA",0,6,,2.0,6/19/2015,"I have been to BJ's many times. I enjoy the atmosphere for happy hour and like the outdoor seating. The beer brewed on-site is good and the food is okay although inconsistent. The service tends to be slow and non-attentive. My most recent visit we had a group of seven on a Wednesday evening. Took 50 minutes to get a table. Once seated got our drink orders. When our drinks arrived we ordered our food. The kids asked for some fries to eat while we wait and I ordered a side salad. After a long wait I flagged down the waiter and asked when we might get the fries and salad. He said he would check in that the kitchen was backed up. He brought out the salad and fries. He said he made the salad himself. After another long wait our food arrived. It had been close to an hour since we ordered. My pan pizza was luke warm and the crust was soggy. A meatball in a spaghetti and meatball entree looked like it had sat in the oven all day (black and dry). My son's burger didn't arrive until 10 minutes after the other food. I flagged down the manager and expressed my disappointment. He comped the pizza, spaghetti and burger and gave us two pazooki samplers which was appropriate. Turns out the kitchen was short a couple cooks. Better communication and attention from our waiter would have made a big difference. Hopefully they will get their act together."
Morten R.,"Bellevue, WA",0,5,1,1.0,6/11/2014,"Ordered my food online for dine in, took them 20 min to bring my food and a 1 glass of water and the food tasted like it was pre-made or had been frozen."
Anna R.,"Redmond, WA",0,6,,2.0,5/13/2013,"Not going back.We went there Saturday night , the 11th  and we were seated at 8.30pm and ate at 10.17pm. The appetizers came in a reasonable length of time but the main course-forget about it.The manager came and told us at one point that my husband's deep dish pizza fell of the plate in the kitchen and another one was in the making.Well it took them another hour to make one. I have no idea what went wrong in the kitchen.The place was packed and I speculate that the kitchen staff was overwhelmed.In all fairness ,after we asked about some sort of  comp (thinking that we were going to be offered one more round of drinks) our bill was drastically reduced to about 1/3 of what we would have had to pay.That made the fair quality dinner easier to digest.But we never eat that late.They even asked if we wanted dessert but we were not prepared for camping so we refused. The ""Chicago Style deep dish pizza "" has nothing to do with the real thing.My husband was very disappointed. He also had the audacity to expect a piping hot pizza but BJ is the wrong restaurant to have any expectations. Before experiencing this place I had a plan to take my parents there in a few days when they will visit from overseas.Now I think that I'll do it only if they don't behave. For the same price but way better food we will go to Cheesecake Factory.I'm always happy there plus we eat the same day we go.A big plus when you have starving children with you!"
Amol A.,"Redmond, WA",2,20,6,1.0,8/23/2013,"Thinking of the good times we have had at other BJs, I took my family there to celebrate and ended up with the worst ever dining experience. They were grossly understaffed and mismanaged. After calling ahead when we went there we had to wait for another half hour. The kids were hungry by then. Then the drinks arrived one every half hour there on, preventing us from saying cheers together !! And of course the ketchup came in after I had finished my burger and the water after the kids had finished their meal. I had to walk up to the bar (I have never done this before) to ask for a glass of water and take it to the table because ""everyone was just too busy"".  This is a classic example of how a restaurant should not be managed. I hope BJs management reads this in the positive spirit of improvement and make it true to its brand.  I was hopeful and happy when I walked in - and felt pretty grumpy on the way out.  Not again for another year or two."
Monica D.,"Duvall, WA",14,6,1,1.0,8/11/2013,"Long wait for food. Chilli cheese burger was burnt, wilted lettuce and cold. Pizza/salad order was wrong. Never going back!"
