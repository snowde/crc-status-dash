Matt F.,"Woodinville, WA",27,13,,3.0,8/5/2017,"If I could do 2 reviews I would as my families in person experience has been very good, probably a 4 or 5 star, but our take out experience has been horrendous, probably a 1 star.  If you order take out, I would suggest going inside or pulling everything of the bags and double checking its accuracy before pulling away.  3 times I have ordered take out, and 3 times, MAJOR ERRORS!  Not just on 1 thing, but I ordered for 5 people the last 2 times and each time 4 of the 5 orders had issues.  1 time or 1 mistake is human error, 3 times with significant errors is a process or caring issue."
Mo Y.,"Kirkland, WA",2413,620,443,3.0,5/5/2017,I give the food 3 stars. The food was very basic and nothing special. The chicken sandwich was dry and it lacked the taste. However our server was truly the best. I forgot her name but she was truly a first class server.
Stu R.,"Duvall, WA",10,3,,1.0,4/29/2017,"This is our go-to in Redmond and we just had the worst service there ever. Even with consideration for a busy Saturday night, this was not how you retain customers. We have friends in the food service profession and are sensitive to the challenges they face. However, tonight they missed the mark on several steps, 6 times to be exact. The waitress told us she was going to inform the manager twice and then circled back to ask if the manager had been by, which she had not. We waited 5 more minutes (she'd already had 20) and left. Very very disappointed."
Robert M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,22,,1.0,10/9/2017,"In town for a business trip during the mlb playoffs. Asked politely where a I could be seated near a specific game and was seated in a specific section with a good view of the TV.  As soon as I had ordered, they switched the game (to a far less compelling game) and then made excuses for 15 minutes while not switching it back (bartender busy etc).  Eventually they sent a manager to ""help"" -- no explanation or solution.  Pretty basic."
Korry P.,"Sammamish, WA",69,174,16,2.0,4/29/2017,Don't ever go here on a Friday or Saturday night. Took about 40 minutes once we ordered to get our food. The waitress was fabulous. She was on top of it but the food took a long long time to get to our table. Funny part was a lot of the tables around us were complaint and the manager was going from the upset table to another.
Amber S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,7,,1.0,3/8/2017,"I come here all the time- and as someone who has been in the restaurant business since age 16, I was FAR from impressed with how management handled a situation. Let's start by saying my waiter was fantastic, the most polite man ever and deserves much praise. However; his manager needs to learn the politeness and hospitality that he has. My mom and I ordered an appetizer then shared a California Chicken Sandwich. Seemed like  a quick and easy lunch...this was not the case. The first sandwich took about 30 minutes to come out- as someone who knows what it is like to have a restaurant crash and burn during busy rushes this didn't bother me. The sandwich came out with black burnt bread- I tried to ignore it, but then it was completely cold. So, we asked out waiter for a new one and at this point were not even mad.  Our re-cook took about 20 minutes- as someone who knows that re-cooks and red tickets should be priority, this was not impressive. Also, the manager should have brought out the re-cook, this is standard practice. The second one arrives only to be burnt once again (not toasted well, but black burnt) At this point I am starving and just decide to eat it. Only one problem, the chicken was not cooked all the way and pink. The manager was notified by the waiter and came to take the plates- which I understood; however the way he grabbed them from my mom and I and comments and excuses he made were unacceptable.  He brings a third one and then tells us he is waiting on the fries and will bring them over. He never brought them out- never came back to check with us. At this point, I am under the full understanding that he does not care to keep us as a loyal customer so I am finished with BJ's. I used to be excited to eat here and admired the wait staff- but from the perspective of a long-time bartender on how management behaved here; I never want to return to hear his attitude and listen to him screaming at employees in the back."
D R.,"Flagstaff, AZ",0,41,3,3.0,7/11/2017,"I felt like they sat everyone before us. Then they noticed us and asked if we wanted to just sit at the open bar area. ""Same service, same menu"" Service and food was fine. Just long wait for a chain restaurant style of food."
Laurel C.,"Duvall, WA",0,3,,1.0,5/6/2017,"When Claim Jumper was next door  BJ's opened and we were excited since the quality at Claim Jumpers had fallen over the years.  Sadly since BJ's has opened, its quality of food & service has plummeted to a new low. Salads are always soggy if they come at all, the once phenomena flat bread pizza has fallen below standards and usually shows up cold & soggy with the once delicious crust tasting stale. It typically takes close to an hour for your order to show up and the wait staff constantly blames it on how backed up the kitchen is. The so called managers have no customer service skills at all and the tired wait staff take the brunt of customers frustration.  It's sad that customer service has fallen to a point where it seems non-existent & ""upper"" management doesn't even care to show up when you ask for them."
Vivian S.,"SeaTac, WA",28,143,109,2.0,4/4/2016,"I work next door so a lot of meetings are held here.  The menu is good but the food is just marginal, which is surprising for this area. The wait is very long,  The atmosphere is good.  I have been here twice, the first time the waitress was horrible (!!), the second time the waitress was fantastic (!!).  If you can, go somewhere else.  There are so many really terrific restaurants nearby (check out my other reviews), try one of them."
Darwin W.,"Kirkland, WA",23,1,,1.0,1/2/2017,"This place is even worse than the 2.5 star average.  Service is non-existent & food is mediocre at best, that is if you ever get any. Approximately 15 previous visits have averaged 2-3 stars. This time we waited 20 minutes for water, 10 more for drinks that never showed up. Beyond the poor service, television control is even more incompetent. After some employee had switched the live Rose Bowl one minute after it started to some random recorded program, the management...well, they stayed in the back room. After that we gave up & left. There are 4 places within 100 yards that offer better food & better service. We enjoyed the rest of the Rose Bowl with lunch & drinks at one of those higher rated establishments."
Kendra C.,"Lake Stevens, WA",22,1,,3.0,4/29/2017,Had lunch here today with friends. The allergy menu does not contain information on MSG so I ordered from the gluten free menu since MSG contains gluten. The waiter was helpful in helping me choose a salad dressing with no MSG. Told me the fries are made in oil with everything else and I should not have them. Returned to our table to tell me he informed the kitchen staff of my allergy. When my food arrived I had fries. I would not recommend this restaurant for people with allergies.
Melody P.,"Seattle, WA",466,738,1535,4.0,3/18/2015,"A group of us came here for post half-marathon meal. Our organizer called ahead of time and reserved tables. I've heard about BJ's but it's my first time there. And, I was very happy! I got a salmon entree and Bloody Mary. Salmon was good and the portion was just right! Bloody Mary was yummy!! The best part was that it's during brunch time and Bloody Mary was half price. The staff here was very friendly and BJ's was very accommodating for a big group of people with separate checks. Thank you for feeding a group of hungry runners! :-)"
Kayli K.,"Bellevue, WA",11,16,6,2.0,9/16/2016,"Very unpredictable. Service can be excellent or terrible. Food is different every time. It runs on the expensive end, but the quality is not consistent. During this entire last visit, our waitress probably said a total of three words to us."
Lori P.,"Snohomish, WA",0,18,1,2.0,4/8/2017,This only pertains to the Redmond location. I found the food to be unsatisfactory. My burger could have been a hockey puck for all I know. I must have got the last of the hamburger meat because my daughter's burger was twice the size and not burnt to a crisp. The fact that it did not come with the aioli that was listed on the menu probably added to the dryness. It was not worth the $$!
Ana Pau M.,"Redmond, WA",16,235,64,4.0,5/16/2016,Their food is good but the best thing are their beers.  Almost the whole menu is about them! The menu explains what would be your right option for each kind of food. You can choose from a huge variety.  I tried the ribs (the smaller ones so I could have something else ;) ) they were nice as well as the salads and cookies. These cookies are different but nice :) My second time there I tried the brisket sanswich and didn't like as much as the ribs but the meat is better! The music is great.
Janani G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,15,,1.0,3/9/2017,"The one star rating is for the service. Our waiter continued to ask what we wanted but kept bringing the wrong item or coming back to check again on what we wanted. It just seemed like he wasn't paying attention in the first place. i wouldn't mind this if the restaurant were really crowded and it was a busy day...but...we were literally one of 2 tables in the place at the time. And lastly, we had ordered a soup to go and they gave us the wrong one which we didn't notice until we got home. The wrong soup isn't a huge deal either except we got a clam chowder soup to go for someone who is a strict vegetarian. Overall the food was okay but the service makes me rethink visiting again."
Brian K.,"Redmond, WA",3,5,,1.0,4/1/2017,"Another one star review, but they don't seem to care. Arrived before the table next to us. Orders taken at same time, they have had food and now gone and paid the check. We are still waiting and when we inquired about our food, we were given whatever had been hanging around and was now stone cold. So... sent it back and now waiting and waiting ... fries are very tasty and employees are very polite. Needs a manager."
Shobhit M.,"Redmond, WA",0,2,,1.0,6/23/2017,First they screwed our reservation and then it took forever to get food. Very disappointed.
Michael R.,"Sammamish, WA",29,62,65,1.0,7/17/2016,The only reason why I come here is for the 4 Pokemon Stops here. Food is bad. Service is slow.  Totally understaffed here.  On a nice sunny day at 3:30 pm they closed down the outdoor seating because they had to let the server go home. Guess they don't need the business. Not coming back.
Jessica S.,"Kirkland, WA",99,416,106,2.0,12/21/2015,"Just ... no. Went here last night for a birthday party. We didn't have a reservation so there was a wait for a table at the bar. No problem, right? Wrong. We grabbed a few tables near each other in the bar area while we waited to be seated, thinking we could order some drinks and appetizers while we waited - which we could have, if the waitress had been available. But during her rare appearances, it was clear that food service in the bar area was going to be limited. We could barely get drinks. Several people gave up waiting for her to take drink orders and just went to the bartender. This would have been okay, but once our group was seated, it was more of the same - a waitress who checked in here and there, but very long gaps in between. The kicker was this: even though we were a large group, and the woman at the head of the table was opening gifts and wearing a birthday crown, our server simply handed out checks when dinners were finished, without even inquiring if we wanted dessert or, you know, birthday cake? The food was okay, nothing special. A flatbread appetizer consisted of a very dry, thin flatbread with some chicken and tomatoes, but no sauce or cheese holding it together. My daughter was at another table where she ordered a deep dish pizza that also apparently had no sauce and was told she should have asked if she wanted sauce on it. Huh? Deep dish, no sauce?  The interior of the restaurant was pleasant enough, and the drinks were good, but mostly our experience made me miss the Mexican place that used to be here. We won't be back."
