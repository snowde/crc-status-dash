Rich E.,"Redmond, WA",0,10,,3.0,5/12/2014,"We've eaten dinner here only a couple of times and were underwhelmed. I've recently discovered their lunch hour specials, however, and the personal pizza with salad for $6 is a great value, tastes find, and fills me up easily. So, that's how I patronize B.J.'s. I visited a different location down in Tacoma recently and discovered that they make their own sodas: root beer, black cherry, cream soda... yes! I had forgotten how much I love cream soda, so there's another draw right there. A solid 3 stars for me!"
Shira P.,"Sammamish, WA",15,8,,1.0,8/19/2013,"OMG! How is this place still in business?? I chalked up my first 2 negative experiences to their newness when I tried them a few months ago. Went back with a friend the other night, only to be served RAW CHICKEN! Seriously, though it looked to be a bit undercooked on the outside, the inside was completely translucent...as in salmonella raw! We were both completely grossed out, and, to her credit, our poor server was mortified. She asked if we wanted to order something else, but all we wanted was to get the heck out of there! Makes me miss the mediocre-at-best Desert Fire..."
Chris I.,"Sammamish, WA",0,4,,1.0,11/2/2013,Just as bad as last time and this is the last time.  Food was cold and tasteless. It took forever to get it.  I watched the kitchen catwalk and nothing was coming out.  Booze however was flowing freely.  Veggie pizza had a few strips of green peppers and chunks of onions .  Yum yum!
Darya M.,"Redmond, WA",7,7,,1.0,8/14/2013,"Let me just start by saying that I actually liked the food. Although, the service was HORRIBLE. I will never go back there, nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone. I've been to other locations and it was never this bad. It took them over 25 minutes just for our drinks to show up. Then add another 45 minutes before we actually got our food. And we ordered pretty quick. I also have a one year old so we tried to get our food as soon as possible so she could eat too. They took forever. And that's an understatement. The waiters/waitresses knew nothing about their own menu, and they were all honestly just stupid. There were two other people next to me who got seated right away. Apparently the waitress knew them because she stood there and talked to them for at least 20 minutes. You can tell she takes her job seriously.... but it was weird how they got their food within 10 minutes of sitting down. No one takes their job seriously here, you get treated like you are nothing. It is a complete joke. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. Waste of time and money."
Pamela W.,"Bellevue, WA",0,20,,5.0,1/15/2014,"Four of us visited 1/14/14 and it was great.  Pure and simple - great service, great food, great drinks, great atmosphere!   Wish I could remember our server's name, he was prompt, personable and attentive.  One of my friends has been here 5 times and she said it was always really good.....Try the Mozzarella & Tomato salad, Thai lettuce wraps, Fried artichoke hearts, all were excellent, great prices too!  We ran into another friend on the way out who had been seated on the other side of the restaurant and she said her food was great too - Suggest if you visit and your service is not good within the first 10 minutes that you tell the hostess, could be just a couple of servers are giving this place a bad name.......We'll all definitely go back!"
Damayanti B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,,1.0,8/19/2013,"We have tried to go have dinner here several times but there was always a long wait. This time we came at lunch and their was no wait. We had high hopes, but the food was just okay. We enjoyed the drinks, however. I'm gluten intolerant and the waiter assured me my dish would be prepared without gluten. They have a gluten free menu, but when my dish arrived it had gluten ingredients. I sent it back and by the time I got the new dish, everyone else was almost done with their food. Later that day I had the type of GI distress that only comes with gluten consumption. Gluten sensitive people, stay away! My friend had a big piece of avocado skin in her salad and my fork had crusted on food. Overall, a sloppy kitchen and meh food. We won't be back for dinner, but we might grab a drink at the bar sometime."
Nicholas S.,"Woodinville, WA",34,2,,2.0,2/5/2014,The food is ok. The service is slow and terrible. We ordered a couple drinks and never even got a glass of water or even offered a glass. I will not be coming back.
Nancy D.,"Issaquah, WA",0,4,,5.0,1/18/2014,"My husband and family come here to watch the Seahawk games and have dinner. The staff is attentive, friendly and puts up with our family for 4 hours. This place has created wonderful memories for our family! I highly recommend this restaurant!"
Fab F.,"Sammamish, WA",29,65,11,3.0,8/24/2013,"It has a little of everything but stick to old recipes, the innovations like ""moroccan salmon"" was just salmon couscous on tomato sauce. Kids meals are great."
CL O.,"Woodinville, WA",0,4,,4.0,12/24/2013,My husband and I have been here for dinner and drinks several times and have always had great service and food. My only complaint is the wait to be seated but we usually end up going on a busy night at a busy time.
S. P.,"Redmond, WA",0,13,,4.0,12/16/2013,I have to say people r being harsh on this place. I always sit at the bartop so service is always fantastic. The lead bartender is always there he is so friendly. Food is pretty good. Things r hit and miss but ahi poke is amazing. Its like cheesecake factory very corperate feeling but sit in and at the bar and its more cozy and laid back. Happy hour prices on drinks r great but have to say i think discounts on food is much to little compared to the other happy hour prices in redmond.  Good experience tho every time. Its what ud expect from a corperate restaurant what r people expecting?? And i think they do a good job with what they can do.
Chris C.,"Seattle, WA",2,26,,3.0,9/17/2014,"If ever there was a place that firmly puts forth and argument for the 3 1/2 stars review, this place would be it.  I visited this place with my daughter for a daddy-daughter date night.  I had a burger, my daughter had the kids mini corn dogs.  Let's start with what was remarkably good.  My daughter loved the ""smiley fries"" I think she'd come back just for those.  The variety on the children's menu is also remarkable--on par with a Red Robin, I'd say (I can't recall all of the options, but there was way more than the typical 3-4 kids items available).  They pour mostly their own beer, but they have many-many styles to choose from.  The bathrooms were clean, the place felt modern and well kept.  The Achilles heel of this place would be the service.  It was pretty slow.  I have not read all the other reviews, but I wonder if this is a knows issue with BJs.  If I were a manager I'd play close attention to which servers/sections were turning tables exceptionally slowly given the number of diners/items ordered.  If they fixed this problem, I'd have gone a full 1 star up in my opinion of this place.  Anyhow, all that said, I imagine we will going again sometime in the future."
Jeff G.,"Queen Creek, AZ",5,19,1,4.0,5/18/2013,"Came in Friday night around 9PM and immediately found a table in the bar which was very crowded. Our server was still very not used to the large crowd and had a hard time handling all of his tables; luckily one of the other servers got our drinks going while we waited for our server. I had their Hefewizen (the menu said to try it without the lemon which I did, but adding one definitely made it a lot better). The menu is very extensive, reminded me of the cheesecake factory. I opted for the grilled California chicken sandwich while my wife got the sliders. Everyone was moving quick (although we never felt rushed) and our food was out before we finished our first round of drinks. Everything was very good, try the wedge cut fries over thin; we really wanted to try the pizookie for dessert but were both stuffed so we will save it for next time. While the service is still a little slow, they have only been open for a few weeks so these things are expected. We will for sure be back."
Cynthia G.,"Issaquah, WA",12,88,88,3.0,6/17/2013,"My husband came in for a date night on their opening night. We wanted something fast since we were catching a movie after. The server was someone who was really trained... in fact he was from another state in town training the other staffs. First experience was good. Next time around, we brought in our kids. Definitely service is slow. we were hungry... at least the food was good. the only thing bad was the soup was cold. How can you drink cold soup? I had to ask them to reheat it. Now I wonder what canned food came out of the kitchen. The third time we visited, again, the food took awhile to come out. The calamari was good, except the dippings they accompanied it with did not compliment the dish. I suggest they use the tamarind sauce on the Avocado rolls and eliminate the red sauce and exchange that with the tamarind. That would be a better dish. I ordered Salmon and asked for a side of miso sauce since I wanted to taste it. That was a mistake. The sauce had no taste at all. It was pretty funny. My husband asked for ketchup, and the guy never came back with it. Had to ask another server for it. the place is definitely fun clean and comfy... food is somewhat good. Comparable to the price tags.. they have slight flaws here and there which they can hopefully fix in the future."
Eoghan M.,"Sammamish, WA",0,5,,2.0,7/30/2013,Went a 2nd time giving them the benefit of the doubt.  It was the same.  Wait too long for a table and then wait way too long for food / service / bill etc.  Place did not seem that busy but there seemed to be lots of staff busy doing not very much.  Our waiter was pleasant but quite the headless chicken.  He was literally waking around in circles at times.  Food is fine (ribs were a little dry and 2 of my kids ordered the same pizza but they did not look the same).  Environment is fine.  They seem to be shooting for somewhere between Red Robin and Cheesecake Factory but for casual chain dining with kids either one is a much better option.
Tom N.,"Kirkland, WA",117,47,1,2.0,7/11/2013,"I'd like to see this place do well as RTC could use better food as Claim Jumper continues to go south in my opinion.  That said, this place just isn't cutting it when it comes to food quality and standards.  The food quality just seems to be very low.  As an example the ""Black and Blue"" flatbread, a name that's not all that appealing, has very tiny pieces of steak sprinkled about.  Pizza is mediocre at best, lacking flavor, and something to make it memorable as a great meal.  Other items are just so-so.  While they may get away with this concept in other markets, I don't think this place will make it in Redmond unless they improve the food.  They do have good root beer but that would be enough to get me to come back.  Overall I'm disappointed."
Marie B.,"Redmond, WA",0,6,,3.0,7/4/2013,"Updating my review. Good food, open late which is a huge plus, still pretty slow service, but overall a good family friendly restaurant."
Lee P.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,8,,1.0,7/17/2013,"It looks good when you open the door, but then the honeymoon is over.  With the level of service and the food quality I cannot fathom why there was a 20 minute wait at 12:45 PM.  I guess this is a 'jumping on bandwagons' thing to the extreme.  So if you are going to follow someone make sure they are not going over a cliff, or to this restaurant.  After ordering (finally) it took about 45 minutes to get our food, and one did not come out for another 10 minutes.  I have ordered Caesar salad almost everywhere and this one was by far the worst.  It was soggy and there was no way it was made the same day.  It was halfway to being eligible for carbon dating.  If I was home and made a salad at 7 AM, left it out on the counter, then ate it at 5 PM it would probably be better than what I got.  Even if it was fresh it was rather bland, with just a mild dressing, and very dry chicken.  It was not a $13 salad.  Neither was the $10 calszone worth anywhere close to it's price tag.  If the food is this stale being brought to the table, I can just imagine what the takeout is like.  Better to just bring it to the UW archaeology lab."
Bob K.,"Redmond, WA",0,6,1,1.0,8/11/2013,3rd time since they opened. nice wait staff. great food. waited 60 min for the food from the time we ordered. we had reservations and were seated before they were busy and still the super long wait with no explanation or apology. I sought out the manager afterwords just to let her know and she made a few excuses and dismissed me. will think again before returning here.
Jeffrey L.,"Duvall, WA",0,14,1,1.0,7/29/2013,"If you have 2 hours for lunch and can wait 50 minutes to get your food, go here.  I have been to this BJ's location 4 times now, this one will be my last.  3 out of 4 the soonest I got my food after the waiter took the order was 45 minutes.  The southern chicken I received had cold potatoes to boot, I would of sent back, but did not have another 45 mins to wait.  When we asked for the manager, they handed us the GM's card (who was not there) and stated, ""This is just because we are busy for lunch"".  This location is not ready for prime time, seems like between their kitchen and waitstaff that can handle 1/2 of the restaurant, but no where near a full one.  sorry, strike 4, I'm outta here.    For a reference, I waited tables for 5 years though college, I know how hard it is to open a restaurant, and to deliver when busy, but they are past their honeymoon period, they should of figured out the kinks by now, not the case sadly."
