Kyle C.,"Kirkland, WA",197,2,,5.0,6/1/2017,"Man this place is great! Good food and better people! Ryan was one of the employees that helped me, and he was phenomenal! You could tell that he was good at his job, but just an even better person! What an experience 10/10, would definitely come again. If all their employees are as good as Ryan, they will definitely not disappoint!"
Alex H.,"Kent, WA",356,258,183,3.0,4/13/2016,"It was OKayyyyy.  I pretty much come to BJ's for the for the beer and the pizzookie's.  Specifically I prefer the Red Jeremiah and the white chocolate chip.  Both amazing. They're happy hour is decent too, nothing I would go out of my way for however. If you like microbrews this place is a pretty great stop. The crusted chicken parmesan is usually a go-to for lunch.  Not too heavy, full of flavor, just don't let them skimp on the sauce, it makes such a huge difference.  I tried the Mediterranean chicken tacos this time as well as it was pretty heavily advertised and other than the quinoa salad it comes with I can't say I would recommend this dish. It was just  bland. If you like decadent dishes full of gluttonous joy and regret immediately after you'll like their burgers and pizzza's here. As trump might say ""It's gunna be HUUUUGE"" The was service little slow, but we weren't in a hurry this time so we were unencumbered by this. Real nice guy though."
Bob N.,"Renton, WA",0,23,,5.0,9/17/2017,Vanessa helped us out in the bar tonight. She was super sweet and very professional. I love how the chef would bring the food to the tables it was very personal and thoughtful. We constantly come to this location and will return :)
Thotka F.,"Bellevue, WA",0,21,,2.0,6/5/2017,Food was good but it took a fat minute to come. Their au jus tasted like the chicken cup noodles lol
Anthony L.,"Bellevue, WA",8,9,2,1.0,7/27/2016,Communication lines between employees were not working... My girl ordered a small bottle of Chandon and some cheap prosecco came instead (she was told it was Chandon )... Salad came 5 minutes after the pizza and too top it all off I had to tell them the pizza was half off on happy hour when the check came.... Took over and hour and 45 min when the place had more staff than the amount of people at the restaurant the whole time.  Don't go here unless you want to spend 1/2 your day waiting for a beer and some food.... Can't even imagine how slow it will be during rush hours.... Manger helped in the end with comping a few items.
Abby C.,"Redmond, WA",15,92,38,1.0,11/12/2015,"Every time we come here I think maybe this time it won't suck...but I'm always wrong, the service always sucks! Employees are not helpful. Ask someone to refill your iced tea and they will say ""uuuuhhhhh, let me find someone"". Aren't you someone? It doesn't matter though, they won't find someone. This time I ordered soup and salad. The wedge salad ended up being the end of the lettuce and 1/2 inedible, and the chili was luke warm. We usually get the pizookie, but we will skip it and save our money. Need a to go box, that'll be another 10-15 minute wait for someone to bring it. Just do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
Steve R.,"Washougal, WA",0,4,,1.0,9/9/2017,"We arrived on a Saturday evening for dinner. There seemed to be a very disorganized reception crew. Although there were many empty tables, we waited over 30-minutes before swing seated. Worst service experience we have ever had. We will not be back . . ."
John M.,"Kirkland, WA",24,13,1,2.0,8/20/2016,"BJ's in a great location, has good outside seating when available (we have came twice this summer and they wouldn't open the patio up and gave my wife and I several different reasons) and has some good dishes, e.g. the wings and burger.  However we ordered the deep dish pizza recently and we're excited to have something more than just a piece of bread with sauce and cheese, a pizza with substance.  Instead we got a thick piece of bread with some sauce and cheese and some toppings.  I put a picture up on their Yelp page.  Go to Dominos or Little Caesars if you want to save some money."
Julie W.,"Puyallup, WA",0,5,,1.0,1/8/2017,"Don't make the mistake of trusting this place with your large party reservation. They can't handle it. When his restaurant is in the wrong, Frank ( the ""manager"" I worked with), doesn't make it right- he passes the buck. Once we finally got a table our server Shawna was lovely. Not worth the trouble however, would never recommend."
Judy N.,"Kirkland, WA",99,23,7,4.0,7/20/2016,3 Pokestops + Full Bar + Good Food = Best Restaurant to play Pokemon Go! 3 Pokestops accessible within the restaurant & 1 in the same block.  Food is not memorable but good. Salsa and chips are delicious and have unlimited refill.  Highly suggest to come here for resupply & dinner after hunting pokemons in Bellevue downtown park!
Aparna S.,"Bellevue, WA",0,16,5,1.0,2/15/2017,"My boyfriend and I used to enjoy coming here often. We were watching a movie at the iPic movie theatre and had a few hours to kill so we thought we would go in for drinks - expecting a huge line considering it was dinner time on Valentine's Day. There was no wait. We were seated immediately so that probably says something. I don't think we will be returning anytime soon. Over time, the quality of the food has gone done tremendously. Nothing ever seems fresh anymore. The service is pretty good though."
James D.,"Snoqualmie, WA",42,2,,5.0,4/18/2017,"My wife and i took our 3 kids, ages 10, 8 and 4, for diner after my oldest's softball game in Redmond. The service was great! The food wad great! I had the new spicy chicken in peanut sauce with soba noodles! Definitely recommend gong to BJ's for dinner. They are kid friendly with great food!"
Gloria H.,"Renton, WA",0,8,,5.0,4/15/2017,"We went for lunch today, we were served by Josiah. We had our 2 year old daughter who was very sleepy and cranky. He brought out some crayons,  a bowl of berries and a cup of juice without us asking. She stopped crying and happily ate her food and colored. Everyone was happy, the food was great, and I had the best service I have ever had at any restaurant by Josiah. He was quick, attentive and went that extra step to make everyone content.  If only every restaurant I went to I was served by some one like him lol. Thank you so much Josiah!"
David P.,"Bellevue, WA",58,453,77,1.0,3/26/2017,It took us 25 min to get a beer after asking two other waiters when ours couldn't be found.  This wasn't the first time this year this happened to us and it floors me that the management has made this a higher priority when this multiple coworkers I have brought this up with all have the same experience. How long are vape/smoke breaks?
Amber P.,"Redmond, WA",22,19,1,2.0,7/2/2016,"I am rating the service, which seems to lack sensibility. The restaurant seems to be missing any sense of urgency when it comes to service.  6/7 times we have eaten at this location, our order was either wrong  or something was missing from it.  Each time the manager has had to comp something off our bill.   Unfortunately, we love BJ's food so we tend to keep going back hoping it'll be different. But we have come to a realization that most likely will not happen under its current management system.  If you are in a hurry, have a large group or are super hungry...  I would suggest going somewhere else.  If you want to sit in the bar, order a drink and some food...   I highly recommend it"
Josh J.,"Carnation, WA",0,2,,2.0,2/11/2017,"Love the food, but after taking the family here many times over the last couple years, the service is consistently terrible.  Long wait times. Then when seated, wait longer. Orders are alarmist always wrong, not just a little thing, but like completely forgetting someone's order.  The only reason we come back here is the wide menu selection."
Jenn G.,"Redmond, WA",0,3,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Google how to cook rare steak, kitchen staff. For an $18 lunch I feel it's reasonable to expect what was requested. Wait staff was pleasant, but doesn't compensate for the massive fail on the food quality. Skip this place and go to a place where the cook actually IS one."
Brittney D.,"Redmond, WA",0,15,,1.0,4/4/2017,"Terrible service, always has been. Not sure why they can't get it together, customer service isn't brain science. You should never get your appetizers before your drinks."
Devry D.,"Redmond, WA",0,1,,1.0,4/3/2017,If it wasn't for the pizzokies I would never come here. Food is ok. But the real killer is that it is always so slow. Food always takes forever to come out. Service is generally terrible. Just ate here tonight and it took 45 minutes to get our two pizzas we ordered. This place is the worst.
TJ H.,"Issaquah, WA",38,12,,1.0,1/2/2017,"Horrible customer service, the waiter dropped a bottle of sauce and went everywhere, got on the walls, the mirror and seats. It hit 2 people at my table and the server did not inform the manager of the spill. We talked to the manager and he didn't give money off our bill."
