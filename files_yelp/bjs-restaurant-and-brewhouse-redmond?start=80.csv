Jamie R.,"Edmonds, WA",87,2,,1.0,11/29/2016,Service was exceptionally slow. Drinks not refilled. Food was marginal. Won't ever be back.
Maria A.,"Bellevue, WA",4,41,1,5.0,12/11/2016,"Lots of TVs,dark, gloomy atmosphere,bar area is well designed just as the family area.Location is perfect! Food is great! And selection of beer is good as usual."
Arica S.,"Manhattan, NY",287,81,23,2.0,7/22/2015,"So I've been here a few times (about 5) but I went for lunch today with a co-worker. Not pleased. Our waitress, Samantha, wasn't friendly. No smile, no water, nothing. We put in our drink orders and they take 10+ minutes to get to us. We're sitting at a table IN the bar, REALLY? mmm. Then our food came out 30 minutes later. WOW. She passed by our table several times and didn't even offer an update on our food or anything! I made eye contact with you and you kept walking! You know what the 'eye' means Lady! Errrrrr!!!!  So in all: 1. I was thirsty...for WATER. Do I really have to ask for water though? That's Waitstaff 101.  2. No update on the food during the whole 30 min wait....even with me giving you 'the eye'. Ugh. I have standards people. I'm not hard to please. I'm easy! E-A-S-Y! Give me the necessities! Food, water, and space.  No water, a 40mins wait TOTAL for food....estoy hambre....well, I was.  Anyways, I'm tired of this mess. I'm not coming to this BJ's again. I'm tired of their mediocre, uncaring attitude. I swear it's this west coast s*it. And that's that s*it I DON'T LIKE. :( ugh. *rolls eyes angrily*"
Annika H.,"Redmond, WA",77,2,1,5.0,2/25/2017,"Bj's usually doesn't have the best service in comparison to other restaurants but we had a fabulous waiter last night. His name was Darrell, & Joanne was the waitress for the other table. They were so kind & Darrell (my waiter) had many conversations with us. We had some girls who had just won a huge basketball game & he went out of his way to get candles for their pazookies to celebrate. VERY impressed with Bj's last night, they had great service. We had a party of 9 & there was a long wait for a big table so they really helped us to figure out a situation that would make everyone happy. Food was awesome, pazookies even better. Definitely recommend."
Joe B.,"Redmond, WA",0,3,,1.0,6/23/2017,It took us about 1 hour to get our food.  I got the superfood salad and it was not eatable.  No taste profile is available here.  They should take it off their menu.
Marie C.,"Seattle, WA",0,138,15,4.0,11/1/2015,"So my husband and I tried this again for date night and we were very happy with the food and the service since it was better than the last time we visited. Especially enjoyed the handcrafted sodas the Black Cherry was very good. Our server Samantha really made the evening. She deserved high praise for her smile, courteous service and our glasses were never empty! Due to the overall experience I would recommend trying to BJ's especially for late night or dinner date it was fun to try new things on their menu and the sodas were delicious!"
Elaine K.,"Redmond, WA",131,130,1038,1.0,7/31/2015,"And here we are after two years after our bad experience and nothing really changed. My friend and I decided to give it a second chance and than again, we were very disappointed. It was a bad decision. At the when we asked about the HH for the host and she said it was still on and asked where we wanted to seat. We decided to seat outside since it was a nice day. It took a while until our waiter came and when we asked for the HH menu, he said: ""I am sorry, HH just in at the bar!"" and I asked what time was the HH and he just said he had no idea!!!  We could not believe it!! Anyways we walked to the bar and another waitress came, we ordered two beers and a flat bread pizza and  chicken wraps. When the food came what we were speechless!! The flat bread was sooooooooo small, burnt and with a few shredded cheese on top. That was it. The chicken wraps was ok, but again, a bird size portion. We understand that that was a HH portion, but seriously? That little? Give me a break!!!! So, we decided not to order anything else and on our way out when we used the restroom, which has a huge long one sink for all the faucets wad totally clogged.  Maybe one day we go back to eat there only in the restaurant, not in the bar. Now, we now where not to go for a HH."
Anna G.,"Kirkland, WA",36,35,12,1.0,11/6/2016,"This place could be amazing. The BJ beers on tap are awesome but the foods horrible. Everything we ordered came out cold or wrong. The wait staff were trying their hardest but their friendly personalities can't make up for the horrible kitchen! If you want more than a beer, don't come here!"
Daniel W.,"Tacoma, WA",178,22,14,1.0,5/2/2017,"Was really craving their pizza. When the people next to us, who got here 10 min later than us, got their food before us I realized that we've been sitting and waiting for our food for 45 minutes. When we finally flagged down our server and asked where it was, literally we got our food in the next minute. So when we get our food, it's clearly been sitting there and my pizza isn't hot. She said it was because the pork chops just came out but that seemed like BS too. It was warm I guess... But that's what a heat lamp is for right? Oh and they forgot my chowder.. So I had to go remind her to bring it. She scoops it out real quick and brings it to us. Manager comes out and says sorry that our food is cold and offers to reheat it.. But we're not waiting another 45 minutes to eat. They didn't offer to discount or to compensate for the poor experience... Our server must have gone on break or something after our order was put in. But at least pass our table to someone who isn't on break please?"
Richard S.,"Redmond, WA",1,13,10,1.0,10/11/2016,"For the 3rd visit I have over 30 min food delays, with multiple excuses. Our waitress on each occasion have disappeared  for extended periods. Food is good however not worth the stress given so many other choices in Redmond."
Joan L.,"Bellevue, WA",2,16,9,1.0,5/2/2017,"We came in around 9pm. Put in our order at 915pm. At 10pm, there was no food. Looked around for our server, couldn't find her. Flagged her down 5mins later and asked where our food was. She said she will check on it and left. 2 seconds later, all of our food comes out at once... including the soup appetizer and the pizza Togo order. All of our food was lukewarm. No sizzle, no heat, no freshness. All the food was just sitting there in the back. Our server totally forgot about us. Why else would everything come out all at once and cold - 45mins later?? AND THE PLACE WAS NEARLY EMPTY. WE CAME IN AT 9PM FOR GODS SAKE. This was the worst experience ever. Manager came over and asked if we wanted them to recook the cold food. OFC NOT. WE DONT HAVE TIME TO WAIT ANOTHER 45MINUTES. and he didn't even offer a discount for shitty food and shitty experience. That's ok. I'll pay full price. No tip. And I'm writing a letter to corporate. Never coming back here again. NEVER! NEVER! NEVER!"
Michael M.,"Fullerton, CA",67,39,,2.0,12/6/2016,"I just finished some of the most mediocre jambalaya I have ever been served. I sort of blame myself, expecting to be served what was advertised in the menu. Next time I think I will stick with the bar snacks."
Y L.,"San Jose, CA",20,9,7,1.0,4/24/2017,Been there 3 times in the past year and I'm amazed how disappointed the service here is and I like bjs food too. Even the food didn't came out as I ordered.  The most recent time I went with two other guys. One was running late. So we just put in our right now but I ask the waitress can she just put a hold on it so when the other guy came we can all get the food at the same time. Next thing we know my friend and I food came out. While the other guy was ordering... smh...
Erica P.,"Seattle, WA",87,184,994,3.0,12/20/2015,"Hooboy. I'm going to preface this review by saying that I have never had a bad experience at any BJ's, including this one. Until tonight, which just happens to be my birthday. I chose BJ's for a family dinner because the service has always been solid, and its menu has something for everyone) The food was up to par, but the service was seriously lacking. After taking our initial orders, our server just up and disappeared. She breezed by once, vowing to return with refills on all of our drinks (which were enpty), and then we didn't see her again until after our food arrived, and presumably only because we asked the gentleman delivering our food to please find our server so that we may get the refills she had promised. At that point, she returned, full of apologies and telling us that she was really busy, but she had asked for help. She asked if we needed anything else, and we asked for a few things (sweetener for tea, etc) which we never received.  She returned one last time to take our dessert orders, and of our party of 8, only my daughter ordered a dessert. When she brought out my birthday pizzookie (tasty btw), she neglected to bring out my daughter's, and upon review of our bill, she never put the order in at all.  Despite tonight, I'm still giving BJ's 3 stars, because I'm really hoping that the poor service was the exception and not the rule."
Natalie T.,"Bothell, WA",0,5,,1.0,12/13/2016,"Went to BJ's for lunch with 7 other people.  For a total of 8 orders, 6 had some issues:  1.  Salad had no dressing 2.  Burger didn't come with coleslaw as a side (it was supposed to come with coleslaw) 3.  Bacon cheeseburger didn't come with bacon or cheese.  4.  Portobello mushroom burger came with cheese (requested that cheese be removed) 5.  Ham and cheese sandwich came with parmesan crusted bread (requested normal bread) 6.  Bacon, avocado, tomato sandwich came with normal bread (did not request for normal bread) It was too bad since the food was actually pretty tasty."
Ashanti S.,"Lexington Park, MD",71,12,9,5.0,1/24/2017,"I had the absolute best experience at this place!!!  All the bartenders were great but Shane was the Best!!  Food was great and when they didn't have the Ahi Tuna for my friend the manager gave her an even better Ahi.  He went out of his way to make her order great!  They forgot my soup one day but went out of their way to call me and make it right.  Who does that??!!!  They did and I love it.  We are here on business and I can guarantee that I would come back to Redmond just for that great customer service and food.  If you are looking for the best of everything I say go here you, won't regret it.  :)"
Glenda J.,"Seattle, WA",91,703,3044,2.0,6/10/2015,"Happy hour at the patio. Service good but the food failed miserably. Ordered the Santa  Fe egg rolls because we'd enjoyed them so much last time.  They were smaller and missing the Avocado dip.  Seems as if they thought they'd just serve it without hoping we would not notice.  We asked for this and we were told they ""are out and making a fresh batch"".  10 minutes goes by and we were told they are still making it and could they give us some fresh chopped avocado instead.  We were tired of waiting so we agreed. We received unripe avocados.  Shortly after that they replaced it with ripe avocados before we could ask. So my take on this whole experience was that they'd try to slip something by us, not once but twice.  Once hoping we wouldn't notice the missing avocado dip and second with the unripe chopped avocados. Second item we'd ordered is the Caprese flatbed.  This was overdone. Will reconsider coming back due to the disappointing food and their handling of the inconsistencies."
Morgan R.,"Seattle, WA",1,413,154,3.0,6/19/2015,"This is a chain restaurant, found at the edge of a mall. It's not a bad place to go if you're already in the mall, or working nearby and needing a sit-down lunch.  Then again, it's not a restaurant I'd go out of my way to visit. The iced tea was brewed and unsweetened (as it should be, but often isn't), the burger was good (California burger), the seafood tacos done well.   The service was fairly scripted (obviously they train their servers to say certain things, and they do as they've been instructed ... including the obligatory up-sell). So the food was good, but the atmosphere corporate chain."
Won Sub Y.,"Lynnwood, WA",17,68,1,2.0,10/24/2016,"Chain Food at it's finest.  Lol.  I can't say it was horrible but it has the Applebee's, Chili's, TGIFridays feel to their food.  Pre-assembled mediocre food.  The menu is monstrous so there should be something there that people can find to eat but I had their pizza and it was really doughy and heavy."
Jean S.,"Kirkland, WA",79,342,902,4.0,10/17/2014,"I found myself at BJ's in Redmond for lunch with my husband and toddler on a weekday. It was fairly crowded, but we were seated right away in a roomy booth. The server was great - when I asked him for their pumpkin ale (a new fall special), he asked me if I wanted to try a sample of it first. Boy, am I glad he offered - it was NOT to my liking at all! I went with the house amber and was very happy with my beverage choice. As for the food, it was ok, typical American bar fare. I went with the unlimited salad and soup - none of the soup was particularly good. The salads were a bit more impressive, and I enjoyed the wedge salad and tomato & mozzarella salad. My husband liked his Southern Fried Chicken, which was a lunch special. He thought the chicken was flavored very well.  Unfortunately, the snag in our meal came when I realized one of my daughter's chicken tenders was still raw in the middle. She was full eating the other two on her plate, so I didn't want replacements for the food, but I wanted to alert the server so the kitchen staff would know. Wow, the flurry of activity that ensued - the server was very upset on my behalf and kept asking if I needed any extra food or even a dessert for my toddler. Then, the manager came over and was effusively apologetic, as well, and informed me the kid's meal had been removed from our bill. It was all unnecessary but very much appreciated.  With such great customer service, I will definitely be back - especially to try the other beers in their vast selection."
