Farah A.,"Antioch, CA",30,4,,5.0,7/25/2017,"Came here for dinner around 10 pm with my family during our weekend trip to Reno. Since we visit the BJ's back home we wanted something familiar, and not as pricey as the resort restaurants. So glad we did. -No crowd, seated our party of 6 right away. -Food came out hot, fresh, and on average time. -All of our meals were delicious and the food tasted waaay better than the BJ's locations I have eaten in the Bay Area. This was my first time at BJs where I liked my meal (ordered the Santa Fe Salad). -Service wasn't overly exceptional but still great. Sam was our server and had no problem with all 6 of us and our special requests. We really appreciated that. Overall, we faced no issues, had a delicious dinner, and left with having spent a good time with the family during our staycation."
Rachel R.,"Reno, NV",83,71,15,3.0,12/1/2017,"I'd almost rate this experience a 2 star, but the waitress and bartender were friendly enough that I felt guilty. Not to mention that they had what must have been their rudest, non-customer service friendly hostess at the front. Despite the fact they were initially super busy, they handled our order quite promptly and with a friendly demeanor.  By the time 8:30 rolled around and the busy holiday Friday night dinner crowd cleared out, the need for speed and to make tables available immediately vanished.  Fast forward, or rather painfully slow forward 30 minutes later for dessert, some thin baked cookies I could have baked in 7 to 8 minutes at most in my kitchen with a scoop of ice cream and by the time the lackluster fare reached our table, I just desperately wanted to go home! The one or should I say 2 bright spots in this experience were the server and bartender who were friendly, kind and attentive and went above and beyond to attempt to make up for any mishaps. I understand it appears they have some issues to iron out and it could be a staff shortage or another thing, but I was not happy about waiting longer for a simple dessert than the entirety of our wait time for our drinks and dinner so the kitchen manager may need to regulate when the staff takes breaks etc. if nothing else to be sure patrons don't all of a sudden get hit with an absolute stand still.  Additionally, maybe the friendly blond at the reception desk could take over greeting of patrons. She was polite, smiling and and professional when I asked for assistance and is clearly more adept at working with the public. Overall, We will be back as it is one of my local Damonte area faves, but some basic changes are in order to ensure continued customer satisfaction."
Tracey C.,"Reno, NV",92,48,176,3.0,10/9/2017,"I use to have higher stars but lately, to me, this BJs is in need of some help. The last 3 times I have been here there has always been a problem. All I want to do is grab something yummy to eat and not have to keep returning it because of mistakes. Once everything is corrected, ya it's good but at that point I am frustrated.  One time I ordered the club sandwich, 1/2 sandwich, and they brought me out a club pizza?? Another, ordered the soup and salad lunch special and the lettuce was mushy and brown, terrible. The staff and manger are friendly and the place is always clean, a little too noisy sometimes but that is because there is always a crowd. I think I will be taking a break from BJs, just for awhile, I am sure I will be back though."
Anna P.,"Reno, NV",96,1,,3.0,8/28/2017,"I recently went to this BJs with my boyfriend and roommate and had some issues. I have some very severe and life threatening  food allergies and am very careful about telling servers about them so I don't, you know, die. This was the first time in years that I forgot to do so, but as I've eaten at this restaurant before, I knew what to avoid so I wasn't too worried (I made sure nothing I ordered had any nuts listed in the ingredients I didn't participate in the appetizers because I was unsure about the ingredients). Out comes our food and I notice something strange--almonds, or what looked like them, on my pasta. I have my boyfriend take a bite and he unfortunately confirms my suspicions.  We immediately alert the server who apologized profusely and takes the pasta, bringing it back to the kitchen to be replaced. Luckily everything turned out fine, the wait staff was amazing, and I didn't end up needing to use my EpiPen.  Here's the issue, though--if I had taken a bite, it is very possible that something serious may have happened to me, and I definitely would have gone to the hospital. It's not too much to ask, right? That a chef doesn't add ingredients to a dish without listing it? Because if it happened to me then it probably has happened to other people. All in all I probably won't go back, not because the food wasn't delicious or that the wait staff had any issues, but because I shouldn't have to risk serious health problems when I eat pasta."
Nancy H.,"Reno, NV",45,60,96,5.0,9/23/2017,"My boys have a tasty night here. The fried calamari is so tasty that my oldest cannot get enough of it. For the record, it is his first time eat fried calamari!  My youngest loves his food too!! Nice place for the whole family!!"
Mike B.,"Reno, NV",48,245,2278,4.0,7/2/2017,"Stopped here about 4pm on Sunday because we had a coupon. It was buy one entree, get one entree free with 2 beverages. The place was not very busy. We were seated right away. There are a lot of tables and a bar area also. We saw at least 9 big screen TV's in the place. Most had some type of sports playing. The place is dimly lit but enough to see well.  For those who don't know, BJ's is a chain restaurant with about 190 locations under a few different names across the U.S. It is based out of Huntington Beach, CA and is publicly traded on the Nasdaq. The menu is pretty extensive and features Italian based items with other American foods. They brew their own beer (about 13 varieties) and make their own root beer which my wife loves. We placed drink orders. Of course my wife got the root beer and I chose to try their own Jeremiah red. The red beer was pretty tasty. My wife ordered the salmon while I succumbed to my Italian heritage and ordered the deep dish pepperoni pizza with extra sauce, of course. The food arrived in a timely fashion. My wife said the salmon was fabulous and I loved the pizza. We even ordered a monkey bread pazooki for desert, delicious! Conner M. our server was great and kept checking on us. The food was delicious. Overall, a good experience but the cost is a little on the higher side, about $50 for two people before the coupon."
Tabitha M.,"Reno, NV",79,139,306,5.0,10/11/2017,"I love the pizzas at BJs, and their avocado rolls. There's something for everyone here. Like beer, they have a bunch on tap and a wide bar selection. My personal favorite pizza is the Mediterranean. These pizzas are big though so order smaller than you'd think as you'll have left overs. Certain days of the week they have half price specials which are good deals."
Nicholas B.,"Reno, NV",1106,75,933,5.0,6/15/2017,"Atmosphere If you're looking to catch the game or a few SportsCenter Highlights this is a great place for that. They have one EXTRA LARGE flat screen TV on split screen mode adorning the bar area. I was sitting in a booth about 30 feet away and had no problem being able to see or hear the sports commentary.  Food  Appetizer   Crispy Calamari This dish arrived at our table at a nice hot temperature, with the option of dipping the calamari into either the marinara or lemon garlic aioli. The calamari texture was perfect not rubbery and dressed in a light batter.   Entrée   Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe Burger I recommend this burger with two thumbs up. The sweet flavored Applewood Bacon, housemade guacamole, red onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Chipotle mayo, tomatoes, and jalapeno was a heart warming dose of deliciousness. And not the heartwarming heartburn I was expecting. Just the contrary, the heat from the jalapenos was mild, allowing you to enjoy the dish rather than being consumed by an overbearing portion of spicyness.  Served with a side of fries on a metal baking sheet one can't be possibly be required to show any restraint when consuming this all American delicacy.   Chicken Tenders with Fries One bite of the tenders fills your senses with the crispy crunchy batter followed closely by moist savory chicken. Served with a savory honey mustard​ and ranch dressing for dipping.   Triple Chocolate Pizookie  A little too chocolatey for me. I think the dish would be perfect if you substitute the chocolate ice cream for vanilla. Perhaps then the dish wouldn't have been overbearing.  Overall Like all restaurants my experience is based on atmosphere, timely service, order accuracy, customer service, and of course the food itself.  My experience at BJs hit on all notes. I will definitely be back to enjoy another meal."
Terri H.,"Eugene, OR",42,66,40,5.0,12/9/2017,"Last night I ordered BJs for delivery through a company call EatStreet . I ordered at 6:20 pm by 10:30 I still had not received my food. I called BJ's and due to not fault of them what so ever they felt terrible and the manager Cody who was at the airport hurried to the restaurant and he personally delivered my order free of change and threw in a piezookie . They were so kind and such good customer service , they didn't have to do what they did due to a horrible delivery company !! Thank you again MGR cody from Las Vegas who came here to deliver my food and to the great service in Reno  .. thanks again"
Lawrence M.,"Reno, NV",6,7,5,1.0,12/24/2017,"Where to begin... we ordered the sampler platter and asked for extra marinara. I guess that was our mistake expecting them to have items on the menu. Or at least let us know that they may be out of some items when we ordered before filling the order. My date only eats boneless wings and usually this isn't a big deal as it is on the menu. But when they fill the order and bring it to the table the should not say they can't substitute items when they needed to substitute an item they had no problem making an exception. We asked for an extra side of marinara and didn't bring it but we asked a second time and the lady walked by and dropped it on the table and said ""this is the last of it"" the marinara looks like they took it off another table that didn't finish it.  At this time no manager has come to the table to discuss the issue... oh he arrived and appeared to have no idea why we would think these were issues. I wish this was the first time I had issues here. The last time I had a rude server and wrote an email to the national website. I was offered a coupon and this was my return visit after that.  They comped the check which is nice but they should not expect a return visit."
Liz M.,"Reno, NV",16,56,79,4.0,1/14/2017,"I know BJ's is a chain, but my husband and I really love coming to our local restaurant to grab dinner on the weekend. The servers are always friendly here, and we haven't had any issues with our food. They're recently revamped their menu offerings, and everything we've tried has been pretty tasty.   I love using the app to put on name on the waitlist ahead of time, and do mobile pay at the end of our meal. And I can rarely resist topping the night off with a pizookie :)  I'm also a big fan of the Blood Orange Sangria, and their drink selection is pretty extensive.   Not the place to go if you're looking for quiet fine dining, but a great place to hang out and grab a bite and a beer."
Ghordan P.,"Reno, NV",0,10,,2.0,12/23/2017,"Disappointed to say the least. There were items missing from my order, the lettuce in my salad was welted and soggy even though I got the dressing on the side and my pizza was burnt and cold. I've never had a problem ordering in house but $52 for delivery, I was hoping for much better."
Barbara S.,"Reno, NV",0,22,63,4.0,11/19/2017,"Come early and no wait. Eating at the bar tonight. My favorite is the turkey dip with wedge salad. Huge menu,something for everyone. Good BJ beer. Tried the pumpkin last time. Very tasty."
Stan M.,"Reno, NV",67,66,103,4.0,10/20/2017,This is an old stand by for Reno.  Not bad for a chain and lunch is a good time to go since it is not too crowded.  Evening you better go early or expect to wait for a table.  Wide variety menu with good beer selection too.  Always have had great service there.
K L.,"Reno, NV",1,18,2,4.0,12/4/2017,"This may be a chain restaurant but this particular location is great. We always, always sit at the bar,  and typically order appetizers and sometimes lunch. I have to say, the food is pretty good. The bar tenders and wait staff are very friendly, helpful, and professional. We return because of one bar tender as he remembers us and knows exactly what drink we'd like!"
Cheryl B.,"Reno, NV",50,170,243,4.0,3/30/2017,"We tried to order delivery, which it says it does, then we're told they don't allow delivery. So we ordered curbside. Somehow, they lost our order, found it but we had to wait while they filled it, so what we wanted to make quick was not.  The service was friendly and food was great, so no complaints there at all. Pizza, spaghetti and avocado rolls with pazookie for dessert - YUM!"
Charles S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",928,1298,1079,3.0,4/4/2017,"This place is Good, not great. It's basically the same thing as all the other national chain restaurants. It's better than Applebee's and about as good as Chili's. They have a gigantic menu, so everyone in your group or family can find something acceptable to order. Service is good. Ambiance is ok. You could certainly do worse than BJ's for dinner."
David D.,"Carson City, NV",19,9,,5.0,12/11/2017,"Always great food. I Got the Ribeye steak and it was awesome, I would put that steak up against any steak house in Reno. We had the best waitress named Taylor. She was very attentive and sweet and never let our glasses go dry. Ask for her it will make you dinning well worth it!"
Karla O.,"Reno, NV",0,27,1,4.0,11/28/2017,Pretty pleasant experience. The Pino Gregio I had was delishous and the meal was great for me. My husband was not impressed with the jumbolia though. I thought his order of it silly because it is not a popular item and I'm sure the rotation of it is slow.
Carrie E.,"Reno, NV",94,104,2,3.0,2/23/2017,Meh. Meh. Meh. Long wait for mediocre food.  Our service is always decent though. Little hint to BJs..  please put cheese on your frickin potato skins.  How hard is that?
Barbara S.,"Reno, NV",1,14,,5.0,11/26/2017,"Thank goodness for BJ's! There is absolutely any and everything you can just about think of at BJ's. And everything is delicious. I work with people that come to Reno from all over the globe and we usually take our international guests to BJ's for a lunch or apps n such, they all always rave about BJ's and ask to go back if they return to Reno. Always great food and service."
Mark J.,"Reno, NV",895,432,241,2.0,7/1/2017,"The food is always good! The problem always ends up with us not getting our appetizers.  No lie we order appetizers and we even tell the server that every time we come to BJ's our apps get screwed up and it never fails we get our main course before we receive our appetizer or our soup or salads...... Endless  I kid you not, food is good the kitchen or wait staff just suck and our last visit was no difference.......  I really like the Blond Beer and food....  I have talk to the manager a few times and just tells us he is sorry and hopefully next time will be better....  I wish you dough heads would get your act together, that's all!"
Shannon J.,"Reno, NV",71,116,40,2.0,12/22/2016,"To be fair they were busy. Sitting at a table in the bar, we weren't given menus. The waitress came and took our drink order and then dropped off the menus. Since we just got the menus, we were not ready to order. When she finally came back to take our food order it was 15 minutes later. The food came out ok, but she never came to check on us while eating and I had to ask the food runner for a refill on my drink, which he never brought. I finally got my drink refilled after I was almost done eating.  I don't know how a place can be busy and not adequately staffed."
Luanã O.,"Reno, NV",60,7,,5.0,8/4/2017,"I LOOOOOOOOVE that place. My bf and I even bought a good deal at Costco.  The drinks are amazing, the food is really goos. People who work there are really polite and lovely. I never had any problem there."
Lorelei L.,"Reno, NV",17,42,72,4.0,7/6/2017,"From time to time they offer specials, my favorite is the buy one entree get second entree free.  The choices was anything you like in the menu.  My husband pick their Thursday special ""Bone -In Pork Ribs"" - comes with Salad and two sides for $18.95 and I choose the "" brew house pork chops"" for $16.95, so needless to say my meal is free, we just need to order two drinks in lieu of the buy one get one free special.  It's an awesome deal!  Our server Nate was pleasant and accommodating and provided us good customer service. There was a little issue with my drinks, I requested ""moscato"" for some odd reason the bartender serve white wine instead, when we mention it to our server Nate, he immediately have them change and it was corrected right away. Our food came in with our specifications, really always a great experience dining here."
Linda F.,"Carson City, NV",440,6,1,5.0,11/19/2017,"This was my first time here and the food was very good, our server Andres was very sweet and on top of our needs. Definitely Coming back :)"
Alyssa Y.,"Sparks, NV",461,225,151,5.0,12/1/2016,"I'm not the biggest fan of writing reviews for chain restaurants, but BJ's truly stands out.  First of all, BJ's always offers a great selection of high quality food. The menu changes seasonally and I've enjoyed every meal I've had at BJ's. My personal favorites include: wedge salad, broccoli cheddar soup, the spicy pig tavern cut pizza, California chicken club sandwich, and the salted caramel pizookie.   Secondly, the service is usually pretty good. On my last visit, Damian M. was our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I've had. He was helpful, patient, kind, and really easy to connect to. He must have filled my water glass six times, and nothing says ""quality server"" quite like frequent water refills do. Damian did an excellent job! Third, everything is reasonably priced. Check the BJ's websit before you visit because they have different deals going on pretty often. Even without a deal, the price is reasonable for every menu item.  I love BJ's because it has something for everyone in your group and it consistently provided a great experience."
Amy W.,"Gardnerville, NV",85,13,,2.0,11/19/2017,"I'm kind of disappointed. I have been here many times and usually have the best experience. I understand that I got there on a Saturday night, I called a half hour ahead of time and they said they would have a table by the time we got there. I was taking 6 of my friends out for a nice meal. We were told they had a 15 minute wait which would have been no problem but we ended up waiting another hour (had I known that I would have gone somewhere else because we were on a time limit) after we were sat everything started out well but servers started bringing us other people's food and when we finally got our food it was overcooked and full of grissell. Then to top it all off our 10 dollar drinks came when we had to leave and the check was all wrong. The bread bowl was amazing and that is why I gave it two stars."
Claudy H.,"Carson City, NV",156,394,5247,5.0,5/21/2016,"Short update :  Our server Darryl was very friendly and nice. The food were yummy, the tavern cut pizza was nice and thin.  My clam chowder as always was very delicious and thick & so creamy. My husband's wedge salad was very good, the wedge itself was very fresh.  The new lemon blueberry pizzokie was much better than the chocolate chips ( doesn't mean the chocolate chips isn't good but it's just too much for us, too sweet ) this lemon blueberry was light and has a sour sweet flavor and some raisins  made it perfect. Thanks to our server Darryl because he suggested us. Strawberry lemonade was always refreshing."
Brandy W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",83,460,45,5.0,11/19/2016,"It's a chain restaurant, but in my opinion, the food is good. We've been to both locations in Reno and Sparks and both are great, but we like this one best (and not just because it's down the street from our house).  The pizza is legit, but I recommend deciding on that and ordering before your drinks even, because it takes awhile to cook, especially on weekend nights. A medium deep dish is perfect for our family of 4 (ages almost 3 and 5 and two adults). My kids each take down a slice and we are left with a few slices each as well. If you want leftovers, go for a large deep dish. Or if your kids are slightly older, that should do it without leftovers. They have a new vegan ancient grains soup and it's awesome. I'm vegetarian, but I thought it was delicious no matter if you enjoy meat or not. You can't go without finishing it off with a pizookie. We love the triple chocolate one. Seriously, crazy good.  Tip: Download the app and put yourself on the list so you can beat the people who come in on foot. We arrived tonight on a whim and as I waited in line, I just checked myself in before the few other parties ahead of us. We got to the front desk and I told them we arrived. We were seated before lots of other parties, which is so nice with a couple of small kids who don't like waiting! They will text you when you table is ready! And with that, it automatically adds the points to your account. And another fun tip... download the app and you get a free mini pizookie just for downloading it!"
Kristy C.,"Reno, NV",383,625,323,5.0,5/10/2016,"Writing a review for a place like BJ's is hard and easy at the same time. It's easy because we've all been there so you (the reader) can definitely relate to what I'm talking about. You know what kind of food they serve and have probably had both good and bad experiences there.  It's hard, though, because you always want to try to contribute something new when reviewing a place and that can be hard to do when it's so familiar.  I decided to write this review after having two stellar experiences with employees, and really think that the service and attention at this location is one of the best I've had at the chain. On one visit I ordered the macaroni and cheese. It wasn't as cheesy or saucy as I would have liked, and the bartender immediately noticed I wasn't super happy with my choice. He offered to get me something different, asked if I needed anything while I waited, and I noticed that he wrote ""please add a little extra sauce"" on the computer after I ordered the chicken alfredo as a replacement. Attentive, action-oriented, and thoughtful--pretty much my favorite qualities in a bartender.  The next visit the bartender was just as attentive and thoughtful (different bartender). I expressed that I didn't like the pizza at BJ's because of the lack of sauce (what can I say, I like sauce!), and she came up with a ton of options to help us take care of that. She checked back multiple times to make sure everything came out as expected, that we were happy with our food, and was just generally really good at taking care of us. Again, excellent bar service.  You've all had the food and you've all been there before, but this way at least you know that if you go (and sit at the bar, though I'm sure the servers are excellent too) you're going to be taken care of."
Susan F.,"Reno, NV",0,30,1,1.0,11/1/2017,It's a shame this place is so bad in so many ways...most of the food is highly processed so much that u can't even request 2 have the things u don't want  in the dishes as they r all prepackaged...so that's the food...the bartenders & servers r the most unfriendly people I've met...not sure why they feel they deserve any tips w/this bad attitude...& lastly the atmosphere...it's always cold no matter what time of the year...overall...bad food...mean people & cold atmosphere...stay at home folks or give ur $$$ 2 some1 that appreciates ur business....
Cathey H.,"Reno, NV",36,5,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Ordered curbside takeout and upon arriving home with the order it was obvious the food had been sitting out for awhile. I called for pickup a few minutes after my scheduled arrival time due to a packed parking lot and still had to wait about 10 minutes.  I only live about 5 minutes away. When I got home the meat from the burger was cold,  the fries were really cold and not good at all even after warming them up. Same with appetizers. I usually have a better experience with curbside and I understand being busy. However when I paid $35 for food and could have gotten fresher preparation at Carl's Jr then I have a problem with that. Probably won't be back."
Denyce N.,"Reno, NV",4,19,13,5.0,10/20/2017,Had a wonderful meal tonight. Everything we ordered was great. Our server Taylor was one of the best we have had. Very enjoyable. We will be back.
Brian C.,"Reno, NV",291,182,262,4.0,10/17/2016,"This B.J's Restarurant & Brehouse is located in South Reno. Take 395 South to and you will not miss it! I have enjoyed going to this location for years and it has always been consistently good. The restaurant is consistent being clean, the employees being helpful, and the food being good. If you have not been to this location I would consider it next time you are in the South Reno area."
Sharman L.,"Meridian, ID",49,10,1,5.0,6/13/2017,"My husband and I stumbled in to BJ's tonight tired and worn out after a long road trip and quite honestly we weren't in very good moods but this meal completely turned our night around. Our server Damian M took the time to tell us all the specials and made some dynamite recommendations! The house made root beer and orange cream soda were amazing! The burgers were definitely above average and not at all what you would expect for a low price point! The highlight was definitely Damian though! What an amazing server!! My only negative feedback is that the host was busy chatting with a server when we came in and seemed to be ""bothered"" by us coming in. The good food and even better service staff more than made up for our uncertain first impressions!"
Trebor G.,"Reno, NV",10,24,36,4.0,5/4/2017,"BJ's Brewery is one of my favorite spots to visit.  This BJ's is no exception.  The environment is pleasant and enjoyable, with a ""Sports Bar"" feel.  The Craft Beer is amazing, they also have a great selection for other drinks.  The Ahi Poki is one of my favorite appetizers to enjoy.  Kelsey was my waitress and she did a great job in line with the BJ's usual courtesy and service.  I would recommend this BJ's to anyone."
Josh H.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,52,83,3.0,10/27/2016,"I don't often eat at BJ's but I decided to give it a try since I was in Reno and knew where it was located. I hate the fact that they always put me in an area where there are loud and noisy children. As someone who dines alone and usually has my iMac with me - I don't know how that singles children area. Nevertheless, the service was okay. My waitress had a big section that she was overseeing and the wait was a little longer than I cared for. It did give me the chance to look over the menu, as it is huge! She apologized when she arrived - so all is good there! I had the Five Meat Pizza, the mini which is four slices! It was SO GOOD! They use a deep dish pizza crust that made it tasty and good even later in the evening when I took it home, because I wanted some leftovers.  Not a bad place for friends to gather to watch the baseball game, which was on when I was there. Not sure it's the most ""Table For One"" friendly places."
Eli K.,"Reno, NV",6,33,,2.0,3/12/2017,"Ok lunch date with the wife after a movie.   Good things: 1. Bacon Cheeseburger- correct temperature and tasty.  Wanted something left off, it was done 2. French dip-cheese melted over all that dank sandwich with a herb au jus to go.  Yum!! 3. Dessert - vanilla ice cream, whip cream, strawberries and a fried pastry.    Bad things: 1. Subpar service/lack of knowledge of menu- I do realize it was a busy day., but not great service and he didn't know what an item was that came on my jalapeño burger.   2. 1 plate of fries were great.  Hot and fresh. The other plate of fries were cold.  My wife was very unhappy  3.The wait- Don't tell me 5 minutes and make it 3 to 4 times that long.  I understand the restaurant is busy, but get realistic with your customers and don't tell everyone 5 min when they walk in the door!!"
Debbie P.,"Reno, NV",282,517,1490,3.0,1/21/2016,"This place is always jumping but there's something for everyone.  Located in the Summit Mall it's a perfect place to take a break from shopping or a pre-movie bite!  Although, I only have one checked in here once; it's was the go to place for dinner with my family.   Once you get past the 6 pages of booze (my personal favorite part of the menu) they have tons of food options in the menu -- shareable apps, salads, burgers, pizzas, full entrees.   In my family, everyone has an dietary need:  vegan this week, caveman next week, gluten free, or well balanced.  My go to meal is the Ahi Tuna Salad - nicely dressed greens with tuna cooked perfectly rare!  No matter what the dietary needs are of my group there's always room for BJ's original Pizookie®!  The super moist rich and delicious hot out of the oven cookie topped with ice cream and baked to order!  We usually get a few Pizookie® Trio!   The good:  - The place is huge even if you have to wait, it's not that bad.  The longest I ever waited was 20 minutes.   - Gotta love the crazy cocktails and they do offer lite cocktails that are very tasty. - Extensive craft beer offerings and decent wine list.  - Large bar with high boy seating in the bar area. - Tons of booths but request one before the greeter seats you because he/she will have to go back to the hostess desk to get approval.  - Fast & friendly service.  - They have a frequent diner program.  I don't have the details as I let my cousin take all the points.  - Great for large groups they have the space and large tables.  The not so good:  - It can get really loud in there on a Friday night.  - The foyer can get a bit crowded.  Once you check in and they give you a buzzer kindly step away from the hostess desk.    - It's a chain restaurant.  At times it's filled with kids.  I'm not against kids by any means but sometime kids are kids.  So, it's kid friendly or you've been warned -- you decide.  I'm not up in that part of town often but if I do go, I'd stop into BJs for lunch or dinner or cocktail."
