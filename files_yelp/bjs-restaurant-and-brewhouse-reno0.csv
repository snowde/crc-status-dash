Brandi B.,"Reno, NV",61,3,1,4.0,8/3/2011,"I've been to several of these restaurants in CA and AZ.  Shortly after moving back to Reno I was pleased to find not 1 but 2 around town!  Started off with the tomato and mozzarella salad... YUM!  Moved on to a delicious Jeremiah Red beer to drink. I ordered the Ahi Poke api for my main course. Then after another Jeremiah Red it starts to get fuzzy, so word of caution... drink slow and bring a driver!  My water drinking husband kindly drove us home where we shared the 3 mini Pizookies for dessert.  He also bought a six-pack of the Jeremiah Red to enjoy another night!   Always a great atmosphere. Fun with friends or family! Lots of HUGE TVs in case you want to catch a game or 6!"
Michelle J.,"Vallejo, CA",5,25,1,3.0,1/25/2015,"Last nights dinner would have been a 1 star but I'm going 3 as an average since BJs is either hit or miss. My tip here, don't go on or at their insanely busy times. I literally had the worst meal ever in a restaurant last night. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. A signature dish of theirs. It came out with 2 cold chicken cutlets, one crispy brown the other the exact opposite looking like it hadn't been turned. The sauce was so thin it couldn't be seen.  The kicker was there were no vegetables. The server said, ""we're out of broccoli, you don't want anything else do you?""  Humm for $14.95 why yes I do!  I asked for asparagus that after a long wait came out raw, so raw it could not be eaten. I suffered through the cooked chicken piece and cold mashed potatoes and brought the other chicken and raw asparagus home to finish cooking myself.  We were going to a movie or I would have sent that disaster back!  Stick to burgers and fries when busy.... I'll go back but not during the 45 minute wait times."
Tina S.,"Urbana-Champaign, IL",33,37,1,4.0,11/22/2011,"I don't drink beer, and I usually dread going to chains, but this place has been pretty delicious, in my opinion! Especially for the price of  their lunch specials. You can get some really great meals for around $10 bucks. It fills you up, and it's fresh and tasty! Favorite appetizers: Stuffed mushrooms, Margherita flatbread pizza with sweet tomato sauce and basil MMMMmmmmm Favorite dishes that I've tried so far...and, I must warn you that I don't eat beef or pork, and rarely chicken... -Tomato Bisque -Shrimp scampi and angel hair pasta  -Grilled Salmon (cooked to perfection--moist and tender-- along with fresh perfectly steamed veggies!)  -Seared Ahi Tuna Salad My only complaints are that they sometimes put too much dressing on the salads, and sometimes the food is inconsistent in quality. But, for the most part, it's been VERY satisfying."
B C.,"Reno, NV",8,42,1,4.0,12/9/2010,"Oh. Yes. Gluten free pizza for lunch! And it exceeded expectations. Ordered a salami, artichoke heart and green olive pie... the green olives weren't on the menu but my server fetched some up from the bar. Per the menu, the gf pizza is described as a thin crust, my preference all the same, and it was crispy and flavorful. I particularly liked the sauce which had the right amount of tang.  Were I not so fat and happy right now, I might bitch about the spendy soda and wet greens in my dinner salad, but will not.  Perfect amount of face time with the pleasant and efficient server.  Am looking forward to my leftovers and my next lunch at BJ's!"
Shawn J.,"Reno, NV",2,46,,1.0,6/12/2013,"This waitstaff at this restaurant act like poorly trained salesmen rather than waiters.  When they ask you a question, they immediately follow the question with a list of 2-3 things you could order.  For example:  May I get you something to drinklike our award winning IPA or a strawberry margarita.  I left the ""?  "" out because that would indicate a pause.  When it comes out of their mouth its one long sentence.  Its really rude.  Especially since I havent even looked at the menu yet. I was offered pazuki 6 times.  Twice before my meal even got there, once while I was still eating it, twice while I was finishing my beer, and again when the check came.  The staff's attempts at an upsale would have been more subtle had they tried to wipe my butthole with a chocolate cookie when I went to the bathroom.  Again, completely rude and unnecessary. I worked in retail when I was younger and was taught these techniques to try and sell more warranties.  We called it, ""introducing specific products"" and ""mention early and often"".  Its really obvious that this is a crappy management team that is out of their retail element trying to increase sales because every waiter I have had at this restaurant does this.  Shut up and let me tell you what I want, this isnt Best Buy. Also the food isnt that great.  Mass produced, high profit recipes soaked in butter.  Reminds me of Olive Garden."
Michael M.,"Reno, NV",46,115,21,4.0,9/18/2013,Very good place to come. I like to think of it as an upscale Chilis restaurant. Diverse menu and great happy hour deals (big pizza with whatever toppings for $6 is one of best deals in Reno). Regular menu prices are a little on the higher price side but I come here often.
Chi Chi S.,"Sparks, NV",128,12,,5.0,3/24/2015,"Oh my god, we finally found the best server there!!!  His name is Nate and he is just so good at what he does.  He gives us the vibe where he isn't ""trying to be nice"" you know, that ""fake"" niceness that makes people very uncomfortable.  He was just being true and himself, very funny and friendly, helpful and confident.  Made our dining experience sooooo much better.   We'll ask for his section from now on.   Congrats on your coming baby!!   ""Yes, we don't get what we want, we get what we need."" (baby story we shared)"
Mimi G.,"Reno, NV",0,15,,4.0,3/19/2015,"Always a pleasure. BJs offer a great menu, big choice of both food and wines. The food is excellent, the service very friendly. Love going there"
Will H.,"Reno, NV",191,60,97,5.0,9/11/2013,"My family and I absolutely love this place.  Their beers and food are always delicious.  We have never had a bad experience here.  The staff is always friendly, polite and professional.  We love it here."
Jeremy L.,"Reno, NV",143,246,83,4.0,6/26/2011,"BJ's is right down from my office and very close my my house so I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. First - let's get the obvious out of the way.   If you come here right at lunch or dinner hour it's going to be busy, almost any day.   If you can wait an hour (lets say 1PM for lunch) then you probably won't have to wait. It's great that they have the bar area because if you're in a little bit of a hurry you don't have to wait be seated and can just sit down and go.   The screens aren't a huge distractor to me since unless there is a major game going on, the sound isn't being piped in. The beers that BJ's offers all taste good but if you're going there for the first time I'd recommend the beer sampler so you can try a little bit of everything. Food wise they have a lot of good food.  Personally I am a big fan of the appetizer flatbread pizzas.  For lunch especially the half flatbread pizza and salad is a decent healthy and affordable item.  OUtside of that their sandwhiches are great, their pizzas are really good (especially the bbq'ed chicken). All their salads are good and not overdressed. I've yet to have a bad meal here. It's also a great place to bring your kids (well 'tweens' and 'teens')"
Yumiko K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",241,825,102,2.0,6/12/2011,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse offers awesome beer (4 or 8 beer samplers are highly recommended), excellent service, and mediocre food. Our server (Nate) was super personable, patient (It took me forever to decide on what to order. Sorry...), and very accommodating (My boyfriend changed his mind to get 4 samplers instead of 8.) Their spinach stuffed mushrooms, mini bruschetta, seared ahi tuna, and stuffed potato  (Ginormous!!) weren't too bad, but none of them was spectacular (except for the beer samplers). If you are into juicy meaty burgers and sandwiches (and beer), this is a good place for you. I wouldn't go there looking for fabulous seafood and/or vegetarian meals."
Loiosh T.,"Reno, NV",5,69,,4.0,6/12/2011,"Lemme sum up:  Very good beer, good food, very good service Yes, BJ's is located in a shopping mall.  Yes, it looks like any other dinner place.  But I have to second Chris R's review that the friendly and knowledgeable staff make a difference.  Plus the food and beer are a really good quality and value. My friend and I were torn on what to order for drinks.  When it doubt...get it all!  We both had samplers of the house brews.  Wow!  Do not expect that you are going to get a 2 oz pour per beer.  BJ's serves about 4 oz in mini V-shaped pilsner glasses.  Bravo!  Here's the kicker:  neither myself nor my friend normally care for dark beers, but the stout and porter are both quite yummy with no lingering bitter aftertaste.  My personal favorites:  Harvest Hefeweizen (notes of cardamom), Nutty Brewnette (is that pecan?!), and Jeremiah Red (Danger! Goes down way too easy. Thank you, sir, may I have another?) Dinner was very good as well.  My friend, who is a meat and potato man couldn't stop raving about the Chicken a la Fresca.  It did look good and he devoured it before I could get a bite to taste.  I went with the Piranha Pale Ale chili in a bread bowl.  I was very happy that the bread bowl actually contained a good two cups of the chili.  The chili itself was meaty with an equal portion of beans to meat.  The top piece of bread that had been cut out to create the bowl was covered with cheddar and parsley and then broiled...nice touch! Do you believe we had room for dessert?  Well, it was to share so I don't feel that bad.  The Pizzokie was good but nothing to write home about.  Standard chocolate chip cookie in a six inch tin with two scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Just right for two people to share.  I do like that proceeds from each sale go towards charity.  There...I'm sure that burns off some of the calories, right? Overall, I'm looking forward to my next visit to BJ's.  They offer quality food at a decent price.  The service we received was really very good.  And I'm dying to try their NitWit.  *elbows you*  Yeah, yeah...takes one to know one, eh?  *laughs*"
Alyssa S.,"Reno, NV",64,102,255,5.0,8/9/2013,"Being gluten intolerant puts a huge damper on dining out, EXCEPT, when dining at BJs at the Summit Mall! I have been there every week since I found out I was gluten intolerant and the wait staff is always very patient and kind. They go out of their way to investigate certain food items of they are unsure whether or not it contains gluten. The GF pizza is great and the GF Pizookie is uh-MAZING! Thank you BJs for caring about celiacs and not treating us like we are an inconvenience!"
Lew L.,"Reno, NV",0,323,,4.0,1/5/2015,12 of us showed up without a reservation. They were very accommodating. We had just got back from snow shoeing. We all wanted something warm but they didn't have decaf tea. Waitress wasn't annoyed at us ordering hot water and lemon. She was very gracious about us ordering just appetizers and small plates. They have a great selection of light fare. My salad was amazing. All the other food looked great and everyone raved.
Chuck S.,"Reno, NV",0,10,1,4.0,7/13/2013,"Good service,ambiance. Nice brewery food like quisedias. Salads fresh crispy. Soups great"
A F.,"Reno, NV",0,12,2,2.0,12/17/2014,The food is ok.  Service is horrible.  Music is to loud on busy nights.  Adding more noise does not help.
Sabrina B.,"Reno, NV",289,687,1508,1.0,5/4/2008,"This place gets worse the longer it's open.  Its started out with decent service and decent food. Now, it's progressed to horrible service and horrible food. I've only been there when friends have visited and REALLY wanted to go there. I typically try to avoid it at all costs. Even their to - go service is horrible. Curbside is a joke -- I sat in my car for 20 minutes before I got out and went it. The hostess / to - go clerk replied ""I didn't think to look at the camera. Here's your food .... and it's been ready for awhile."" EVERY single visit I wind up with my meal either being taken care of courtesy of BJ's management or a gift card to use ""the next time"" I dare to risk culinary disappointment. Stay away. If you're dying to have BJ's, go to Nor Cal and go to the one on De Anza Blvd. It's bigger and actually has intelligent servers and management - not to mention quality food."
A U.,"Truckee, CA",0,60,4,4.0,5/4/2013,What a nice place for lunch. Came on a Saturday just before lunch with small group including an antsy 5-year old. Server got drinks to us fast and was patient with the little one. Excellent service and food. Asian Salad was very filling for this big guy and glad that I chose it over a burger for a nice change. Pizza and tacos were good for the other adults. Child had mac and cheese and liked it. Also available for little ones is carrots and celery with dressing to dip in. Nice all around.
Tahoe G.,"Gardnerville, NV",0,2,,1.0,10/25/2014,Worst service I've experienced in many years. Cold food. Kitchen mistakes. Food came at different times. Drinks were dry a good portion of the time. Waiter did not offer to comp even after out obvious dissatisfaction. Steer clear and go somewhere else.  Took over 2 hrs for a subpar lunch. Sad......
Penny D.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,1.0,11/29/2014,"We arrived at 5:40 on a Tuesday night.  We were promptly seated and our beverage order was taken.  We did receive our beverages in a timely manner and our salads, but after waiting another thirty minutes we asked our waiter where our dinner was.  He miraculously delivered our dinners.  My scallops were at room temperature and the asparagus with it looked as if it had been cooked last week.  My husband's turkey burger was also at room temperature.  After not seeing our waiter to complain we got up and left.  NEVER will we eat in a BJ's again.  The last time we were in this restaurant the service was  also very slow but we attributed it to the fact  that it was 7:00 on a Friday night."
