Jesse B.,"San Antonio, TX",25,223,61,5.0,6/7/2014,"Dear BJ's, You are AMAZING. How amazing? Well, let me count the ways. 5 star service: your servers are always perfectly attentive and the food always arrives in great time. I never feel pushed or manipulated and I appreciate choosing to get dessert all on my own devilish desire. 5 star food: I love your food. It's not like it's the healthiest fare, but it's the GOOD kind of bad. I loved the Bison Burger (only like 500 calories) and it was SO worth it. The Ahi Salad isn't bad either, and I LOVE all the deep-dish pizzas. Seriously, the food is so good, I would love to come around more often, but my stomach or triglyceride levels doesn't have the ability to ingest your caloric provisions. 5 star BEER: OMG, I love your beer. Jeremiah Red, P.M. Porter, you name it, it's so freakin' DELICIOUS. But damn it, would you please sell it in stores because I can't always make it in JUST for a beer! 5 star atmosphere: Thankfully it's never been crazy loud, crazy busy, and just flat out --crazy--. If you do get busy, it's never been so loud and crowded that I felt I had to leave or else risk insanity. Of course, I do try to avoid the busiest times (who wants to wait an hour for a table?). Seriously, for a franchise, this is an awesome place to go. Reno has other places that compare, but no one can't beat the convenience of some shopping, eating and taking in a movie. I wish you were here in Carson City, but whatever, it's not all about me.  I love you, BJ's. Love you too much, Jesse"
Ember H.,"Reno, NV",83,24,1,5.0,6/3/2016,"I swear I live here.  I'm not even joking.  We live on the South Side of Reno and this is our ""go to"" place to eat (get the Premier Reward card if you go often... it's worth it).  I love the fact that BJ's has a ""lighter"" menu, for those random days I tell myself I'm on a ""diet"".  I go here so often that I've tried to mix up my taste selection.  Every meal I've ordered from here has never been disappointing.  My last visit was a combo of the chicken tortilla soup with the Asian chopped salad.  The chicken tortilla soup was by far the best soup I've ever had.  ... and I've ordered the Asian chopped salad already 2 times this week."
Jeannette M.,"Sonoma, CA",64,103,12,4.0,8/20/2015,"Really enjoyed this restaurant and super friendly/professional staff.  We ordered a bunch of kids meals, appetizers and a dinner salad.  Kids meals (pasta with chicken) were pretty skimpy on the chicken, but the kids liked it.  I had an ahi tuna dinner salad and it was so fresh and good.  I loved it.  My sister had a few appetizers and she enjoyed them.  Order was customized and they got everything right.  I loved the atmosphere too - high end, but rustic at the same time."
Kate R.,"Reno, NV",7,10,,3.0,6/29/2016,"I have been to this location a couple of times. The number one problem I have with BJ's is that it is always overcrowded. On Friday night you have to wait for a table 30 min or more. So if you like BJ's, please always call ahead and make a reservation. The food is good but nothing special. It is just another franchise menu: lots of options but nothing really stands out. Also, I have noticed that their food is always slightly over salted but I guess this is a normal thing for all franchise restaurants. The service has improved over the years but do not expect your food to arrive on timely matter. It always takes longer than usual. If you like franchise restaurants, then BJ's is not a bad place to eat."
P G.,"Reno, NV",0,2,,5.0,6/25/2016,"Our favorite go to place for a consistent good meal. Service is always good. It is a brewhouse so it is not for that special romantic dinner, but for everyday eating out you won't walk away hunger. Casual and fun."
Stephanie G.,"Reno, NV",269,204,1498,5.0,1/8/2015,"I can't get enough of BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse! First thing is first, their beers are really...really good...even their root beer which is all handcrafted, so if you're in the mood for a craft -anything, try BJ's...they even have a gluten free beer...they have an entire gluten free menu actually. There are some amazing cocktail creations that are unique and fun too, but the freshly muddled mojitos are hard to pass up. There are many appetizers to choose from, Ahi Poke, Crispy Calamari, Flatbread Pizzas. Looking for something smaller? They have a, small-bites appetizer menu as well which can I just say, with those prices you will want to try them all, and the Bruschetta is something I insist on ordering every time and the crispy artichokes are something my hunny insists on ordering every time! I could go for cocktails and appetizers and that would be a good dinner all by itself with their amazing options for appetizers! BJ's has many amazing dinner entrée options as well. Everything from Pizza's, to very large stuffed baked potatoes, to pastas...the Cajun pasta with shrimp being one of my favorites. Spicy Jambalaya, juicy burgers and even an enLIGHTened' menu with a great Barbeque Bison Burger and the BEST Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos I think I have ever had!  ""Grilled chicken breast seasoned with Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub, cucumber, Roma tomatoes, red onions, feta and fresh cilantro tossed in red wine vinaigrette and drizzled with Greek yogurt crema in a chargrilled pita, served with Greek yogurt crema for dipping and seasonal bistro grains."" These...seasonal bistro grains...they speak of, I could eat a very...very large bowl of that by itself but the crema from the tacos, and the tacos, all one of the best combos ever. Finish this all off with a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie and just call it a night because you are officially in what I like to call a Brewhouse food coma."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,1/13/2014,We dined there on Saturday Night January 11th about 8:00 PM. Service was good. Menu has a lot of variety to offer. We had a party of 5 and they were able to accommodate all of our needs. Kids menu is good too! Food was tasty. We enjoy BJs and have dinned at many from Colorado to California and always enjoy the food.
Ellie G.,"Reno, NV",6,30,22,4.0,6/19/2015,Had lunch here today. You can always count on the same food you love. Very consistent. Speedy service. Their new batista is fast and can multi task. She does a great job.
Satya T.,"Reno, NV",36,60,16,5.0,5/27/2015,"BJ's is one of the few chain type restaurants I frequent regularly. Their menu has so many options. There is always something for everyone and it's cost efficient. Their service is always wonderful and very friendly! Lyndsey is my favorite!   I also enjoy quite a bit of takeout and its always spot on. I get so annoyed when you get all the way home and your order is wrong, but not here. They additionally have convenient curb side pickup.  I hope you enjoy too! (0:"
Lydia M.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,2.0,5/16/2017,"I was in there this last Friday and the service was less that exceptional. The server started off very friendly but in time began to become rude and annoyed. At one point she walked away in the middle of taking drink orders and just started taking TWO OTHER TABLES ORDERS. Once she finally brought the drinks my friend had ordered a whisky sprite and she brought him a whisky and water so he asked her about it and she said it was probably just sitting there and watered down?! She rarely checked on us and when it came time to split the bill took 20 minutes to bring us our check. There were only 6 of us, it does not take 20 minutes to split a bill. (My friends and I work at another restaurant it takes 5 minutes to split a small check) So we went up to the host stand and payed up there and the host was so rude. It was the short red head one. She rolled her eyes multiple times and treated us horribly. We asked if we could leave the check up front and she rolled her eyes again and said ""um I guess?"" She must have been new because she clearly has no idea how to treat customers. I was so dissatisfied with the experience we will never be returning."
Taylor R.,"Reno, NV",75,7,,5.0,2/9/2016,"Always consistent, love the rewards program and special offers. Mareisa is our favorite server and we love seeing her every time we come in. She gets extra sauce for the cajun pasta and takes great care of us. BJs is truly our go to South Reno restaurant."
Kevin K.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",17,5,2,5.0,1/20/2015,"This place is a regular stop for me whenever I visit the biggest little city.  The food and the beer is great, and the service is too.  Some of my favorites are:  The Pazookie, any pizza, Avocado Egg Rolls, the beer, and for those of you that don't like beer, my wife says the Berry Cider is great. While visiting recently, I was sitting alone and got up to use the restroom.  When I returned, my table had been bussed and my last piece of pizza was gone.  I might not have said anything, but Kim, my server, immediately recognized what had happened and offered me another personal size pizza.  I took her up on it.  When my pizza came out, it was the wrong pizza, a simple mistake.  She left me with that pizza and got the right one out as well. Outstanding service that exceeded my expectations!  Thank you Kim.  I will forever be a BJ's customer and recommend this place to anyone and everyone."
jack d.,"San Francisco, CA",5000,339,,4.0,8/17/2015,"We had dinner here and as far as a chain restaurant goes it was pretty good. The waiter, Dennis was very nice and helped us out with the promotional pay phone ap which gets you 20% off your bill which is a good deal. The meal itself was ok, nothing great but not bad, They did have the 49ner game on their many screens which was a big plus. Pleased with the food, the service and the discounted price."
Jason G.,"Reno, NV",30,28,73,4.0,3/21/2015,The food is always awesome. Their ribeye is more than that. It's Awesomazing! That wait was reasonable but bar seating could be better. I still like this place and I love the beers. Keep it coming BJs!
Jefferson D.,"Petaluma, CA",45,6,,5.0,3/22/2016,"Awesome service!!! Every staff actually greets you with a warm smile, not your typical BJ's restaurant. Loved our server Hannah."
Allie A.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",84,1850,486,3.0,5/9/2013,"3.5 Had a lunch meeting here.  I walked in and suddenly remembered one of my pet peeves with big chain restaurants..... THE NOISE.  The 3 of us were in a booth, so it was a bit easier to hear each other, but even then, the conversation was hard to handle. I ordered a Thai mango chicken salad concoction which was pretty good.  (Side note:  I happened to notice that out of the 15 or some women in the surrounding booths, every single one of them ordered a salad.  Velly belly interesting...) I did feel like we were a bit rushed.  I don't recall the waitress asking if we wanted coffee or dessert.  I'm finishing up my salad and out of nowhere the bill appeared.  Slam, bam, thank you ma'am."
Linda M.,"Carson City, NV",2,72,112,5.0,1/23/2015,Great reno lunch house with many food selections and to die for pizza.  Friendly staff and good service.  The root beer is brewed here as well.
Tracey H.,"Reno, NV",0,6,,1.0,3/16/2016,"I have ordered curbside many times. Food is fine, to go salads are weak and skimpy, pizza gets a little soggy, but it's a chain and there you go. A few mistakes here and there, but not enough to cause a stir or a phone call.  Something is amiss with the online ordering system, as now twice I've ordered pizza with EXTRA cheese, which spat out as pizza with NO cheese. Yes, I am so worried about my cheese calories as I've ordered the 5 meat pizza (not). Then, now twice in a row, the boneless wings came with NO SAUCE. I chose the rootbeer glaze both times (it won't let you advance until you choose a sauce) and the wings came unsauced. I've tried to substitute crispy chicken for grilled chicken in a salad, which came with NO chicken at all. I'd had enough.  I called the restaurant this time, irritated. We spend at least $100 there a week on both dine in and curbside. After triaging with the curbside attendant over the phone, the manager, Daniel, finally decided to assist me. At first he offered to make me another pizza for free ""if you want"", so I could drive 45 minutes round trip to come get it. Um, no. Then he said obviously something is wrong with the online ordering system, so to ensure accuracy I should not use it. Um, that's why it's there? So I don't have to call and do the whole person process? Lastly, he took my email address and said he would send me a gift card equivalent to the botched items to use by the end of that evening.  No card, no nothing.  New italian restaurant going in next door. Hoping to have better luck there."
Robert S.,"Reno, NV",848,894,3127,3.0,3/29/2011,"I've been here numerous times.  Most of the people I associate with like this place.  Me, not so much, but it's passable chain food, with some decent beers, or so my friends say. I guess maybe I am just not wowed and I really need to be wowed to give reviews above average.   I had the Italian Market Salad.  It wasn't ""spicy"" or flavorful enough for me.  It was loaded with stuff and was filling but it just didn't really pop. We had some appetizers.  Nothing wowed. I will return because it's near the theater.  But I wont choose it for myself.  I would rather go to Firkin."
Nicole L.,"Sparks, NV",0,13,3,5.0,7/27/2016,"BJ's is awesome! I've been here multiple times and have enjoyed it every time. The menu is huge; therefore, you have plenty of options to choose from! There is something for everyone. The parking lot always looks full but the inside is large, so I have never had to wait to get in. I've ordered take out and that was a great experience, as well. There is a dedicated take out area so it was fast and convenient!"
