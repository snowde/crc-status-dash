Chesty L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,172,18,3.0,8/23/2014,"I LOVE BJ's in MY MOUTH!!!! meh, only if it's the $5 special. The food here is passable, the theme is sports? Idk, even the staff seems bored out their mind. I suppose if your in the area, try their pizza but don't go out of your way to eat here it's just ooookay, thats all."
NewToReno B.,"Reno, NV",3,55,47,4.0,11/23/2015,"I am stuck at home, immobile after a surgery the other day, so I used the Yelp EAT24 app for delivery. Of course it's a little spendy but it is such a lifesaver to have that option. I got the Kale and Brussels Sprout salad... Amazing! The picture doesn't do it justice. The baby greens with the brussels sprouts, cranberries, blueberries and goat cheese are such a great mix. Very light but full of flavor. I'll definitely be ordering this again!"
Jackie V.,"Reno, NV",6,7,4,5.0,1/3/2015,"Wow this place was packed, despite that we got our seats right away, unbelievably fast and good service, and to top it all off a great meal. The jalepeno burgers is what we both ordered and it was tasty cooked just right and had the right combination of ingredients."
B S.,"Reno, NV",0,17,1,4.0,1/1/2015,"I love BJs beer but to be honest I have a hard time with food consistency. When it's not slammed the new entrees and small bites are awesome. But I could go to BJs weekly and order the same thing and get a different variation each time. Hits- would be the Kale Brussels sprout salad, tacos, jambalaya and always any pizza on the menu. Must haves- Blonde, Light Switch and the Pizookies are perfection. Stay away from - garlic chicken wings, I think the chef put them in the Alfredo sauce rather than garlic wing sauce. Burgers are not so great here either, usually over cooked. However, if you can get a burger cooked right (medium) then it's pretty good.  All-in-all I really like this place, close to my house, great family environment and always have fantastic service."
Susan M.,"Corona, CA",127,294,96,4.0,8/7/2015,"We had a reservation for six people and needed a booth. Unfortunately, one was not available at our reservation time. The management at BJs did their best to accommodate us as quickly as possible and gave us great service. Three of us ordered the Parmesan Chicken, myself included. It is two thin chicken breasts, breaded and served with a lemon chardonnay sauce. Amazing! My mom ordered a salad which she enjoyed and my husband had a pizza, which is always good at BJs. My 2 year old is quite the picky eater, but the garlic bread satisfied her. Overall a great meal."
Jodie S.,"Reno, NV",112,120,239,5.0,6/24/2014,"I ordered one of the new enlightened menu items the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos: balsamic marinated, grilled chicken breast, cucumber, Roma tomatoes, red onions, feta and fresh cilantro tossed in red wine vinaigrette and drizzled with Greek yogurt crema in a chargrilled pita. With Greek yogurt crema for dipping and seasonal bistro grains. WOWZERS!!! Definitely not something I would expect to be so good from BJ's. It was a healthier option that was great. The yogurt dip topped it all and made all the flavors so appealing. I would definitely order this again!"
Robin G.,"Madison, WI",0,5,1,5.0,8/2/2016,"GREAT customer service. We ate at BJ's in Reno twice in July. On both occasions the customer service was outstanding. On our first visit Miguel was our waiter and on the second visit Hannah W served us. BJ's must a a super employee training program and know how to hire the ""right"" person. Of course the food was great as well, but it was the wait staff that made it a memorable dining experience."
E K.,"Reno, NV",17,18,29,5.0,10/14/2014,"I am the the biggest complainer when it comes to horrible service that is why I must mention when service is outstanding, amazing, and great. Alicia was attentive, nice, and although the restaurant was busy she made us feel as we where her only customer.  Its employees like her that make our family enjoys going out to dinner."
Catherine D.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,132,6,3.0,6/6/2014,"Sunday night around 7:30pm, 4 of us sat at a booth in the bar thinking the service would be faster. We were wrong. We waited 15 minutes to get waters and a soda. Missing silverware until after we were served dinner and my uncle didn't get his starter salad.  I understand we all have our off nights, but it wasn't packed, there were 2 waitresses in our area and come-on this is a big chain! Consistency is key. Food is always good, service is always iffy."
Kim J.,"Reno, NV",3,14,12,4.0,12/11/2015,"As far as food goes, they have such a large menu that I'd say you should check it out before you get there!  This time I just ordered the appetizer version of baby back ribs which comes with slaw, and munched on a slice or two of the leftover Deep Dish pizza (awesome) which my two small kids split the 9"" one.  Hubby liked his jalapeno burger and beers.  I didn't care for the berry cider beer - too much berry, tastes like medicine.  A little slow in the kitchen for a snowy, Thursday night but great food.  And, the service has actually improved over the years."
Leone G.,"Reno, NV",20,72,393,4.0,3/29/2014,"We been to BJ more than a few times now, and we think its great. We never had a bad service here, and the kids like it too. From the sandwiches, soups, avocado egg roll and the desserts are all fine. Besides the food, I also like the T.V.s, because I'm a sports nut. So theirs always a game or sportscenter on, but their is no soap opera for the wife, sorry hunny. So it's all good for the families, as well as adults ( big screen at the bar ) and I do mean big... So come on down and have some good food and beer and watch the game(s)."
Jennifer O.,"Reno, NV",152,4,,4.0,1/13/2016,"Food is always great, the only small complaint is that they keep changing their menu ever so slightly.  I love all the newer healthy options, but miss some old items.  Service today was excellent Derek (not sure of spelling) was super attentive."
Peter H.,"Birmingham, AL",15,81,145,5.0,6/16/2014,"The best Pizookie EVER!!! (A big fresh bake cookie, hot and warm, top with ice cream)"
Cyndi Y.,"Reno, NV",20,30,,2.0,6/20/2015,This restaurant time and time again has no consistency with the quality or service of the food. Ordered fish and chips and the feature new item Mahi Fish and shrimp enlightened entree.  Both were tasteless and served at room temperature. The previous dinner experience the time prior to this was also terrible as we had ordered a hamburger and fries and again served room temperature. My husband got sick from the hamburger. Save yourself time money and a unpleasant experience !!
Lisamarie W.,"Reno, NV",149,17,127,4.0,5/5/2014,Excellent greeting at the front - friendly faces and smiles. Clean restrooms and restaurant I like sitting at the bar - Ted is the best. I enjoy the smaller lunch portions... New item lemon thyme chicken is perfectly sized and seasoned well. I have had mixed experience in the past but enjoy lunch at the bar
Jenny B.,"Reno, NV",43,94,23,1.0,4/29/2015,"I took my sons to BJ's for lunch recently.  The place was busy as there was a girls volleyball tournament in town.  Our server was Katy.  My son specifically ordered the wings with barbeque sauce.  The wings came out looking like they had been in the oven for hours, with hot sauce and ranch covering them.  When I asked Katy about the ranch (my son hadn't tasted them yet, but can't stand ranch) she told me ""They come with ranch. The photo on the menu shows it.""  Then she walked away.  My son said ""I'll wipe it off."" Then realized they were smothered in hot sauce. I called her back over.  I said ""He ordered bbq sauce, not hot sauce.""  She sighed, said they were very busy.  My son, not wanting to upset her, said he would eat them.  I said ""No, he should get what he asked for.""  Katy said to me: ""What do you want me to do""  in a very rude voice.  Her body language said she couldn't possibly be bothered by a mistake. I said ""Get him what he ordered, and leave off the ranch.""   She walked away, no apologies, nothing, just walked away.  She returned a couple minutes later with the rude response of ""My manager's taking care of this.""  Then she stormed off.   Katy was rude.  She acted like she couldn't be bothered.   My son did end up getting the wings, but with Katy's attitude I will NEVER spend $60 again on lunch for 3.   Further, BJ's really needs to add some VEGAN OPTIONS to their menu.  I only eat there occasionally because my boys really liked the food.  I usually end up paying $11 for a bowl of lettuce and a few carrots and peas. With all of the other things on the menu, you'd think that there would be a couple of good options for those of us that don't eat meat or dairy.   The only plus to this place: the beer is great.  Katy: I am sure you didn't appreciate the $3 tip on a $60 bill, but something has to get your attention. I used to work in the food service business, and I understand the frustration, but I also learned a lot of lessons."
Peter T.,"Portland, OR",102,521,727,4.0,6/15/2010,"Zipping through Reno the other day, visiting my old pal Laoman, Mrs. Laoman, and Gramma Laoman, we headed out to BJ's for a bit of lunch. I'd never heard of BJ's (the restaurant kind), but apparently they are spread across the US - there's even one in my back yard. Go figure. A cavernous space with a menu to match, BJ's offers a wide variety of foods to please most any palate, from salads, to pasta, to pizza, sandwiches, burgers. You can peruse their menu online, and find out if there is one near you, as well. We had a great meal and even greater conversation. Although I have known Laoman for longer than Mrs. BurgerDogBoy has been alive, I had never met his lovely wife and her mother. Charming folks, a lovely couple, beautiful home. I should visit more often. Or move in. Anyway, Laoman went with the personal size house special pizza, and gramma had the same sized pepperoni, Mrs. Laoman went with the sesame chicken salad, which looked wonderful, and I went with the Cuban burger. All BJ burgers start out as half-pound Angus patties, and the Cuban is dressed up like an almost traditional Cuban sandwich: oven-roasted ham, Swiss cheese, crispy dill pickles, dijonnaise and mustard. It comes on French bread, the menu doesn't exactly say that, it says ""served sandwich style."" The burgers come with crispy shoestring fries or seasoned wedges. I ate more of the strings than I should have. As for the burger? After a lively discussion about Morey's Fish House, in Motley, Minnesota, and getting frozen walleye filets delivered, Laoman asked me about the best and worst burgers I have had, and I am sure I got glassy-eyed, and said ""burgers are like women - they are all beautiful,"" before I got around to discussing BJ's burgers. ""The true test for me,"" says I, ""is the taste of the meat all by its lonesome, and I have to say, BJ's has one of the more memorable burger patties I have had in some time.""  All BJ's burgers are ordinarily cooked to medium well, but the server said I could have it anyway I wanted.  ""Raw?""  I asked. ""Sure,"" she said.  I went with medium rare, and it was cooked to medium rare PERFECTION.  PERFECTION I TELL YOU! I did not try any of their house brews, maybe next time. They have this giant-ass tank of beer outside, and I can envision me pulling a Homer Simpson, lying underneath the tank, opening the valve, and lettin' her rip!"
Rob P.,"Reno, NV",0,83,2,4.0,7/18/2015,"You can't knock this place, it's a solid 4 star chain. Service is always good, sometimes it's great. Menu choices are all good, not sure there is really a bad thing on the menu. Their rewards program is fun. Great place to take the family or grab a bite with the wife!"
Charles G.,"Reno, NV",30,16,3,5.0,4/2/2014,"I absolutely love BJ's. There's always a view to a TV and a game (of any type) can be seen. One of my favorite dishes is the mini bruschetta, but you can get a larger version of it (not quite so mini). When you order, ask for the larger version of it as you'll get more and it's super yummy. The Italian/Pesto (delicious) sauce is amazing.  I have two more favorite dishes, the Buffalo Chicken pizza and the jambalaya. Both great choices. This BJ's has great service and the staff is super friendly. There has never been a questionable visit in the 15-20 times that I've been here. Darrin (the GM) does a great job with his people and place.  If there's a line for a table (which there always is), try to babysit a table in the bar area. This is a free seating area where no list is necessary, it's first come, first serve."
Erin M.,"Pacifica, CA",16,168,2,4.0,7/9/2015,"Clean, great wait staff, prompt service, food quality was great.  This is a nice BJ's.  The only reason for the 4 stars is the overload of TV's in these restaurants.  California Club and the chicken caesar were great.  We'll be back."
