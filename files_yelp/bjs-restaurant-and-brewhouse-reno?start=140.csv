M C.,"Reno, NV",9,32,,4.0,8/20/2014,"Took some family folks that were here from Las Vegas and we had a GREAT DINING EXPERIENCE - AS USUAL! LOVE BJ's!!  Great food (pizza, avocado egg rolls, potato skins, pazookies!!) and great service! Prices are fair and comparable to others but ambiance is hard to beat. I'm a huge sports fan so I love the wide open, sports bar feel about the bar area. BJ's is good for getting what you expect; LOVE THEIR CONSISTENCY, REGARDLESS OF LOCATION.  BOTTOM LINE: 4 STARS FOR ALL (FOOD, QUALITY, QUANITY, PRICING, SERVICE, AMBIANCE)"
Chiddy B.,"Arlington, VA",1,70,41,5.0,7/5/2014,"I love this place. I always order the chicken club sandwich and my husband gets the extreme pepperoni pizza, of course we share an original pazooki! Always great service and great food. I love their mobile pay."
Mat M.,"Walker's Point, Milwaukee, WI",299,520,86,2.0,12/13/2013,"BJ's is a cool spot, good beer ... and the atmosphere is lively. This location had terrible service.  I mean, really horrible.  I live out of state, and my waitress kept my ID for about 20 minutes before returning it... as it's a company policy to do some type of check on out of state ID's.  As I found out, this location has been in some trouble with serving under age I guess.  This location seemed disorganized and without a seasoned staff.  I will say, the people working were friendly and kind. The food was good - and I enjoyed my burger.  I enjoyed the Blonde Beer and the Pumpkin Ale as well. As for this location, I won't be back.  I hear the one in Sparks is much better. If you want good service, look elsewhere."
Jovan M.,"Fillmore, CA",5,10,,4.0,8/18/2015,Huge menu with great beers. Soy Salmon it was really good kind of sweet. The prices are perfect for the amount of food you get. we went on a weekend so it was a little busy takes about 20 mins to get your food once you order. We will be going back.
Pete B.,"Reading, MA",0,7,,5.0,5/21/2016,"Being new to Reno, I was hoping to find a local bar to call my own.  My friend recommended BJs and I went to check it out and have not been disappointed yet.  It is where I end up most nights that I go out for food because of the exceptional customer service and outstanding food.  I usually sit at the bar but all the bartenders I've dealt with have been nothing short of amazing, especially Ted, Valerie, Ana, Sam, Andres, and Kathleen (I swear I'm only there 1-2 nights a week...) highly recommend this place, I would give it 6 stars if possible!"
Busyguy C.,"Carson City, NV",0,44,11,4.0,3/20/2015,"I've been going to BJ's since this location opened back in 2006/7  I have to say their beers are always great, some of the best micro beers in the area.  I do believe the right server can make a big difference when you go here, I'm a bar person and I'm giving ""TED"" a big shout out as a great host/bartender!!  I have tried many plates and pizzas and apps, I love the Ahi Poke, always fresh! The burgers are good and usually cooked to order, the original pizza is solid and the chicken is usually a great choice.  The salads are always good and worth adding to a meal.   I've had some issues with BJ's over the years but all in all this location is good and has a bit of a ""Cheers"" feel to regulars, it's nice, thanks."
Lucy W.,"Reno, NV",0,12,,3.0,5/18/2016,"The food is yummy, but the service was terrible. We sat at our table for 15 minutes before our server greeted us. We ordered 1 pizza and it took 45 minutes after we ordered for it to come to our table. Once our food came our server was again, non existent. We had to ask a hostess/busser for our check. Super frustrating, especially when you have little kids."
Magdalena C.,"Reno, NV",93,105,,1.0,9/19/2013,"Just tried to place the order for catering for 30 people. This is how it went: ME: May I please place a catering order? GIRL: Yes ME: This would be for May 23rd. (4 days from today) GIRL: Ohhh... Could you call on Sunday night to do that? I just want to make sure it will not get lost. It's big better if you call on Sunday. ME: Ok, I'll do that. GIRL: Are you sure? I can do that right now for you. ME: Ok, let's do that.  GIRL: They will not look at it till Sunday and it might get misplaced. ME: Ok, I'll call on Sunday. GIRL: I can also take the order now and leave it for them. ME: Aaaaarghhhh! *click* Going elswhere."
Jeff S.,"Reno, NV",11,8,,2.0,7/27/2015,"I've eaten here a few times food is good. Stopped in after work a couple times for a cold beer, don't think I've had worse bartender service. There were 3 of us total at the bar and I sat at least 5 minutes with an empty glass. Guess I've learned my lesson...ok for an overpriced lunch but not a happy hour stop."
Jennifer J.,"Reno, NV",113,232,248,5.0,4/1/2015,"For a BJ's, this place is typical of the chain. The food is consistent and the beers are good. The wait times are usually good but can get long on the weekends or typical night out nights, so plan ahead."
Celeste S.,"Truckee, CA",67,266,29,4.0,12/20/2013,"I don't like reviewing chains. Fact is, if you are hungry and it's close, you are going to go and reviews don't matter. Plus they tend to stick to corporate standards. BUT, not 100% of the time. And obviously staff/service can be different by location. This is the 2nd time I've been to this BJ's location. I honestly don't recall the experience from the previous time as it was a few years back, but this time our waitress was very fast and always attentive (pet peeve = my water glass is empty and that is my only beverage. She did not allow that.) She was also very friendly and considering how crowded it was at lunchtime, kudos to her.   My food was good = got the tomato bisque soup and an order of boneless buffalo wings. Mmmmm. A pleasant experience all around and definitely would go back."
Scott C.,"Reno, NV",8,12,1,2.0,6/17/2015,"2 stars due to 2 consecutive visits that were horrible!  What happened to this place.  I use to love it!  How can you screw up your own named pizza?  We had a party of six in 5 nights ago.  We were seated promptly, which was good.  The good ended there.  I ordered fish and chips, which came out like chips.  I had to use the minute amount of tarter sauce, which I watered down at the end to have this over-fried piece of god only knows to be able to swallow it!  Parents ordered BJ's favorite.. can't screw that up right?  ehm, wrong!  Due to the last 2 visits of having COLD pizza delivered, it was specifically requested to make sure the pizza was hot..put your finger in it before bringing it out to make sure.  Take a wild guess on the pizza temp at delivery.  COLD!  Return it!  It took 10 min. to get our waitress to remove the pizza from our table.  She was too busy taking orders and delivering water to the tables around us.  After said pizza was gone, it took 45 min. to get a pie back to the table.  The remaining 4 of us had long finished our meal.  NO offer of a free brew, no offer of a pizouki while the rest of us waited the 45 min. Mgr. offered to buy the tables meal.  Nice gesture.  Waitress came back with the pizza removed from the bill.   Never going back.  There are far too many pizza places that serve beer to take my business to."
Derek F.,"Auburn, CA",20,25,1,3.0,7/6/2015,"Busy. Sat us quick though. Ordered a rip eye steak, what I got was at best a chuck eye.  Kinda irritated me but tomato bisk made up for it. Over all its an ok place to go eat if a bit on the pricey side."
Tina S.,"Truckee, CA",9,33,115,4.0,3/21/2015,"I haven't been here in a while as the wait is usually long and their slow service isn't worth it, but today was different. They served us quickly and efficiently. The waiter was friendly and got us the sides we asked for. Usually when we ask for an extra sauce they won't come back but today they did. I went at about 1 which is one of there times when I usually see a line but there was no line today."
David B.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2016,The service and quality of food at the Reno BJ's has consistently gone downhill the last six to eight months. It is not a place I would recommend at this time. The food and service used to be terrific Andrew would like to return in the future.
Carissa P.,"Reno, NV",4,41,22,5.0,5/27/2015,"Not all BJs franchises are equally good, but this one is awesome to me. I don't know if it's the management that makes it that way, but if it is keep it going. I loved our waitress (can't remember her name) but she was very knowledgeable, happy and attentive. Food was fresh and love there abundant beer selections. This BJs has a great vibe and is a good place to have happy hour as well."
Daniel M.,"Reno, NV",79,11,5,1.0,3/29/2016,We love coming here until this time. Service was absolutely terrible. And then when we let them politely know we were treated absolutely terrible and they continued to treat us awfully. The server's name is Kathleen.
Melanie F.,"Reno, NV",306,60,226,4.0,7/29/2013,"Nit Wit is back! Thank you Pat Cronin! If you are looking for a restaurant with a group of friends that have eclectic tastes in food, this is the restaurant for you. Plus, they are a brewery that utilize local brewers. My favorite thing on the menu right now are the Mahi Mahi Tacos grilled. I have yet to have a bad meal here though."
Elvis P.,"Orange, CA",0,17,6,5.0,3/12/2016,This review is specifically for Ted! Bartender over at the bar. Now I'm a man of my drinks so I appreciate a good beer anywhere but what really made me feel wanted/cared about and appreciated was his service. Attentive to what you ordered and addressed you by your name. That was a first for me because most bartenders don't really take the time to even know your name or might not even care? Ted did. As soon as I received my food he made sure that the food was to my liking and my drink was always topped or ready to refill at my request. He also suggested great drinks to switch up when I got bored of the original stone ipa. Ted is the man!
Michael L.,"Reno, NV",589,731,47,2.0,10/29/2013,"We were shopping and hungry, oh hell I am always hungry. Went in and seated quickly and was greeted by the waiter right away. We each had the half sand and soup, our came with a salad as we did not want the fries.  The sandwich was fine, a turkey with a huge gob of lettuce. The soup was tasty and I should always tell folks to leave off the cilantro, but forgot to do so. Now the salad was much larger than either of us expected and looked nice and fresh.... But. I do not know if they have the lettuce resting in a bowl of water and sugar to keep it crisp or what but it was so sweet I just could not eat it. It was the actual lettuce and other items not the dressing which was blue cheese. The waiter was on the spot and friendly even if he did make an odd comment or two.  It is a nice enough place but once again the food for me let it down."
