Virginia B.,"Reno, NV",27,9,,4.0,6/5/2015,"Tasty food, great burgers and fish and chips. Even on busy nights service usually keeps up. Expect long waits on weekends, but it's worth it. Fun atmosphere and family friendly."
Heather M.,"Santa Monica, CA",29,511,6,1.0,6/29/2015,"B L E C H. Yet another lousy BJ's. I am so done with BJ's. Every single restaurant you can expect the same garbage. From poor customer service, to guaranteed screw ups on your order, slow service, no refills, management who could care less, and wait staff that treat patrons like scum. This location is no different. The old blonde waitress with glasses was so rude. We waited well over 20min with no greeting, no service, and when she finally graced us (ha!) with her presence she was just a you know what. She clearly didn't want to be there, had a bad attitude, no apologies, no greeting, no introduction, no welcoming vibe what so ever. So done with that. Just because you hate your job and whatever else your problem was don't pass that along to other people. Management didn't really care to be honest. Acted pretty fake to me. Stayed and had a lousy salad and soup which was a rip off to say the least. I won't be back to this BJ's or any of them - they really are TERRIBLE. I wil patronize places who treat me and my family with friendliness and respect and appreciate our business. Utterly sickened by the poor treatment. Bye bye."
Karen M.,"Reno, NV",0,29,,2.0,6/13/2014,"Every time I go here, I regret it.  Maybe writing this review will remind me to skip it.  The location is convenient, but for goodness sakes, bring the food out together! Whenever my family of five goes to BJ's, there's always one meal that comes out late.   Tonight it was my salad, and everyone was pretty much done with dinner when my salad caught up to the table.  Earlier in the evening, a server had dropped a plate.  It wasn't until we were (finally) about to leave that we realized the food on that plate was all over the floor and my husband's shoes.  The food is okay, but despite cheerful staff, something about the logistics just doesn't work."
Robert D.,"Douglas, NV",1,11,,4.0,4/14/2015,I have heard how good there pizza was here so being a pizza fan I had to try it.  I ordered the pizza togo and of course while waiting had a few beers.  The beer are awesome and a nice change from the main stream.  After a few beers the pizza came and when I got home and tried the pizza I was pleasantly surprised.  I prefer a thinner crust but will definitely be back for more.  Being so close to home its a nice place to have a few beers while waiting for your pie.
Gretchen S.,"Reno, NV",0,49,,3.0,2/20/2015,"I find myself consistently disappointed with this place.  More often than not, you wait forever and a day for your food.  The servers are generally nice and well informed, but the kitchen seems to take forever to deliver mediocre quality food.  The beers are good, so I would not hesitate to come here for drinks and maybe appetizers, but I'll skip it and go elsewhere for dinner."
James E.,"Reno, NV",86,25,134,4.0,4/23/2015,"I enjoy the variety of food, but they stopped the ""chicken teriyaki bowl "" which was my favorite lunch item. My daughter has celiac, Gluten free is important to us. She loves their pizza."
Destiny M.,"Reno, NV",321,131,195,5.0,5/7/2015,"This is such a great place to grab a bite to eat! There is definitely something for everyone on the menu. The inside is very well put together and kept extremely clean. It's a big place, yet their staff does a fantastic job taking care of everyone. My most recent visit here was for a lunch date with a friend. The place was packed, yet they has our party of four seated within a few minutes. We got the calamari as in appetizer and it was okay. We all picked at it, but I probably wouldn't order it again. My husband and I both for burgers that were cooked to our liking, my friend ordered a pizza and loved it, and my daughter got chicken tenders and mashed potatoes and also loved it. They gave us all big portions and everyone had leftovers to take home. It was around $50 for my husband, daughter and I to eat. But for good service and absolutely tasty food, the price was well worth it. I'll definitely be back again."
Thomas E M.,"Gardnerville, NV",214,430,2302,4.0,6/19/2011,"We stopped by on our way to the Aces game on Wednesday, June 16, 2011, and we enjoyed our visit. The scored some points early by allowing me to try some of their beers prior to deciding on the one that I'd buy, and I appreciate that, as not all micro-breweries are equal.  I tried three, and enjoyed them all.  As it was happy hour, I got a dollar off as well. My wife and I shared the Cobb salad and a mini-pizza.  Both were prepared well, and we both thought they tasted very good.  The mini pizza featured a thick crust and plenty of toppings.  Again, it was happy hour and thus we got the pizza for a discount.  It would not have been worth the full price, something like $10 for a six inch (my estimate) pizza. The service was great.  I got plenty of water, and a friendly attentive attitude. Will we be back?  Yes, but this is a sport bar, and my wife is not into sports like I am, and when I go there I am definitely drawn to the TV's and thus not the effective communicator that she deserves.  This, as any husband knows, can have consequences.  Everything went well this night, but it could have been bad."
Aleksander C.,"Reno, NV",3,25,5,5.0,6/6/2014,Expect nothing but great things from BJ's. I've had a waitress that would sing me back orders. Love this place !!
Daniel E.,"Reno, NV",603,291,236,3.0,7/5/2014,"BJ's is a national chain of brew house restaurants.  It is a publicly traded corporation (traded on NASDAQ) and the feel you get is your typical dining / drinking experience that is created by management that must please a board of directors and ultimately their investors.  I'm sure the sexual innuendo in their name isn't missed by their marketing department.  BJ's is the Denny's of craft brew pub restaurants.  This doesn't have to be a bad thing, but you can forget about the homely small craft brewery feel that you'll get when visiting Great Basin Brewery, Silver Peak, or Brasserie Saint James in Reno, NV.  They are going for a very wide appeal and have to do whatever they can to keep operations costs down.  You'll find something to satisfy everyone in your party, but the charm that was captured by the original BJ's location is most likely long lost.  My Mom and Susan were happy that they do serve bignets, I have to admit!"
Raquel G.,"Reno, NV",2,6,,1.0,1/15/2015,"This was a terribly disappointing restaurant experience. I have been here before and it has been tolerable. Won't be giving this place another chance. The service was mediocre; the servers were just phoning it in. E.g the appetizer, avocado egg rolls, were served without plates. Ok - fine. The food was edible but just passing. The Maui glazed pork chop with red potatoes and green beans: pork chop was moist and decent flavor; the potatoes were plain, not necessarily a bad thing, but they were overcooked and looked as if they had been under the heat lamp all day. The ""sautéed"" onions were old and dry. The other entree was the BJ's burger - greasy, bacon soggy and dripping - ewww- and the onion bun was over cooked so it was dry, the onions stale. Really, for the prices, NOT worth it."
Michon K.,"Reno, NV",52,30,40,4.0,2/24/2013,"Love it, love it, love it!!  Pazokkie is the best!!  Everything is good so far that I have had.  Love their blonde beer!  YUM!"
Heidi A.,"Reno, NV",27,6,,2.0,1/30/2016,"Food is very good. We get it to go usually.  We continue to go there because they have gluten free food that has never made my husband sick. However,  they make errors in our order almost every time and give incorrect wait times- had to wait over a half hour after the specified time. Not happy with service."
brandy e.,"Gardnerville, NV",6,44,68,5.0,6/3/2014,"Good service and great food! We ate at the bar and had beer from the tap. Ate avocado eggrolls, which were tasty and spicy. Then a gluten free cheese pizza. Perfect! We will be back for more!"
Claude C.,"Reno, NV",7,22,5,2.0,3/11/2013,"This past Friday my wife wanted to have lunch at BJ's...OK can give it a try again. The food was OK for the price, nothing out of the extraordinary. The service on the other hand, LACKING! It took over 15 minutes for our server (Charles A) to acknowledge our table. Since we saw this was going to take some time, we ordered the drinks and the food right away...well my soup arrived before the drinks did. Then, lunch was brought over but my wife's pizza was missing...+ we order our granddaughter burger with cheeese....no cheese. The burger went in, came back with two pierces of American cheese cut by hand ( rough hedges) and not melted. By the time we were half way on our food, my wife pizza showed up! At the end, no I am sorry, or any other kind of apology, my guess this is their standard way of taking care of customer. Managers by the hostess podium.... looking good! I would only come back if someone else pays.... BTW had better experiences at other BJ's ..."
John W.,"Atlanta, GA",211,418,78,4.0,4/2/2013,Pazookie! Bacon cheeseburger pizza! Oh my oh my!
April P.,"Reno, NV",9,71,1,2.0,9/25/2012,"I remember going to BJ's a few years ago and the food being semi-decent, so I wasn't too hesitant to be dragged here again. I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and it was served to me at some weird temperature between lukewarm and room temperature. The pizza had obviously been microwaved. I think this place has the worst pizza in town for the price. (Ten bucks for a mini pizza? That's microwaved?!) So suffice to say the pizza was pretty gross. One member of our party had the chicken fried steak and the meat was chewy and old. The people that ordered hamburgers weren't very impressed either. I'm not entirely certain how this place is still in business considering the mediocre food and expensive prices."
Richard H.,"Janesville, CA",9,26,1,1.0,12/6/2015,"Well, despite many enjoyable lunches and dinners here, breakfast is the epitome of mediocre. Slow service, limited menu, probably ought to close it up and wait for lunch. What a shame."
Kristin D.,"Reno, NV",0,23,,2.0,11/6/2015,"I actually like the food and the brew at BJ's.  I gave it a two because if you want to eat in then it's a great place.  But if you order to go expect a different experience.  Twice now I have made online orders for advance and got there only to find out they don't have my order.  When I showed them the confirmation their reply was ""Well we don't have it.""  Well I have my confirmation number showing I ordered it so you telling me you don't have it isn't really an excuse.  Each time they said they could place my order then and they would rush it along.  It would be done within 10 to 15 min.  Each time it was done within 30 min to 45 min.  And one time they messed up the order and it was cold.  Not sure why it was cold if they had to make it when I got there.  If you do want to eat the food make sure you are dining in."
Janette D.,"Caledonia, MN",1,5,,5.0,1/6/2015,"Their happy hour is awesome with high-quality and well-priced appetizers and drinks. I LOVE their Harvest Hefenweizer beer and their flatbread pizza and sliders. They have a great multi-screen TV above the bar where I can root for my favorite football team and quarterback: the Green Bay Packers and Aaron Rodgers from Chico, CA! GO PACK!"
