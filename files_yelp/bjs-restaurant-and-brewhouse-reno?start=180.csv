Kevin M.,"Carson City, NV",6,44,41,4.0,5/2/2014,"Great pizza and lots of different beer choices. I was happy to order a local draft (Great Basin ichthyosaur) to end my day. I thought $10.50 was a little steep for a 6"" pizza. It was very tasty though."
Sharon J.,"Roseburg, OR",151,382,519,4.0,12/19/2012,"I went here on a Sunday night, walked right in and was seated.  Fast help, and GREAT food. I myself had to drinks and my date had one. We both had pizza and salads.  The bill with tip only came to 42.00. Yes, I will be back, and yes I have been telling my family and friends about this place."
M F.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,8,2,1.0,5/25/2015,"Stopped in here to get a bite to eat before hitting the road back to Southern California, what a mistake! Horrible service... Finally got a refill at the same time we received our check, and to top it off, that is when the waiter decides to start a conversation with us. Management.. Get a clue. Let's get the bus boys to help out the servers. As if all this wasn't bad enough, my burger was dry and tasteless."
Gordon S.,"Minden, NV",0,20,,1.0,8/30/2015,Order was botched.  Service was poor having always to ask for refill.  Got the briscuit burger and it came with no briscuit.  Another overrated chain restaurant that relies only on atmosphere.
Bacchus H.,"Reno, NV",12,28,1,2.0,4/20/2014,"Hmmm, fast food chain which is overpriced and menu is overwhelming!  Went in on my birthday with girlfriend for appetizers & drinks. I asked before I ordered if they could make a particular drink & dingy redhead says yes to my request order of aDark & Stormy ( rum & ginger beer mixed drink) and waitress returns with a dark beer!  I tell her it's a mixed drink & she says 'oh, thought u asked for a dark beer!'  Her curls must be too tight. Anyway, my friend & I eat & drink & waitress asks if we'd like the cookie dessert & my friend says 'it's my friends birthday today'. Redhead says 'oh'. I'll be your cashier whenever you r ready!  Thanks a lot ditzy redhead!"
dave H.,"Mono County, CA",0,21,2,2.0,8/2/2014,Been waiting 45 minutes for a burger and salad. Even if the food is over the top delish it is kinda negated by such a long wait.
Alexis E.,"Reno, NV",0,18,3,1.0,8/23/2014,"We normally love BJ's restaurants, and we actually eat/drink there quite often. The new rewards program is a small added bonus if you go often enough to earn a free Pizookie here & there...and almost always, the food and service are fantastic. Until last night. Service at the door and at the table were mediocre. We were in somewhat of a rush on our way to a movie, so we ordered right away. We ordered a pizza, making sure to emphasize ""no tomatoes"" and ""half no onions"", and the waitress confirmed. The pizza came, with tomatoes. We disappointedly said ""we ordered no tomatoes, but we don't have time for a new order so it's fine, oh well"". We started eating & realized there were also onions on the entire pizza. I ended up scraping off all toppings & eating plain dough. When the waitress brought the check (never checking in to see if our food was satisfactory), we informed her the pizza was all wrong & we weren't happy. She just said ""oh sorry, I wrote it down right, it's the kitchen's mistake"", took our bill & left. No compensation, no attempt to make the mistake right, so we ended up paying $50 for a crappy incorrect dinner. We'll be going to the Sparks location instead from now on...great service there."
Danny P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",24,25,11,5.0,7/2/2014,"Their happy hour boneless wings are extremely delicious. They obviously don't have as many selections as BDubs, but they are better priced (during happy hour) and mouth-watering. The drinks are well made, but not the best/strongest I've had. Our bartender, Felicia, was very sweet, friendly, and professional. Even when dealing with customers the previous bartender didn't close properly. She always had a smile on her face."
Becks W.,"Reno, NV",1,34,,2.0,12/18/2013,"So my art team and I from IGT went here to celebrate out accomplishments for the whole year of 2013. We thought BJ's would be good because they have a large variety of different kinds of foods. We got there without reservations and only had to wait 3 minutes to be seated (not bad) considering the place was filling up quickly. We ordered these appetizers which weren't that great...southwestern eggrolls (copied from Chili's, but Chili's eggrolls are better because they are huge) some mozzarella sticks, a little bowl of chips with weird artichoke dip and some other eggrolls that I didn't even bother to try. There were 6 of us...and they didn't even bring out 6 for each of the foods. Dissappointing! It did take a long time to get our drinks too and most of us ordered water. So we got there at 11:40 and then we checked the time and it was 12:40....WE WERE WAITING FOR AN HOUR to get our food. It finally came and my Grilled Chichen pasta was so cold and my bosses burger and fries were cold too! Even one of the artists compained about his salad. Not exceptable! So they made our  two dinners....then forgot and then made everyone else's (Chef Ramsey would of fired the chef). We did complain and they offered to take it back....but hello...this was a celebration lunch and we have our work to get back to, so we did not have time. Then they offered desserts on the house.....UHHH...stupid...we DON'T HAVE TIME!!! They could of atleast offered 50% off the check or the meals that were cold to be taken off the check. Then we were all eating fast because of the time.  I recommend not going to BJ's with over 4 people. Very dissappointing. And if you see the place is filled up....don't even bother going in. You won't get served correctly. If you can't handle a busy restaurant...why are you even open?"
Neuy D.,"Chicago, IL",36,403,3,4.0,6/7/2012,"Not bad, Not bad at all. Nutritional info online (not on their website though). Very suburban and chain like which in a larger city would be a negative but we don't have many places like this in Reno so I like it, reminds me of home."
Bo D.,"Belmont, MA",25,154,28,1.0,9/13/2011,Got me sick. Ordered off the gluten-free menu.   The salad they brought me HAD gluten.   The manager apologized for them not being fully trained (great) and there were lots of problems with the way they handled everything.   STAY AWAY.  I wish I had and avoided being sick for days. Got letter from their legal department (to which I did not reply). Maybe they have done this all before.
Gail L.,"Reno, NV",16,22,,1.0,12/8/2013,"Sunday afternoon my two daughters and I went for lunch. We ordered 1 kids meal pizza, and 2 Gluten free pizzas. It took 30 minutes to get served, then after returning home realized the pizzas were NOT gluten free. Have been sick since eating there & know what eating Gluten feels like! Will never trust B J's food again...oh yeah, the bill was $40!"
Johnny B.,"Reno, NV",57,362,76,5.0,5/29/2012,"I'd guess I probably go here about once a month, their service is always great and I have never had a bad meal. I enjoy their bacon cheeseburger pizza and their fish tacos are also very good. I like the fact that they have so many other beers on tap besides their own brand, however it makes choosing sometimes difficult. Whenever we can't decide where to go we always end up here!!"
Glenda M.,"Boardman, OR",0,1,,1.0,10/1/2015,Don't even bother. My first experience was terrible. Left having not been served. A few years later I got the nerve to try again. Even worse. There are so many options out there. Do not settle for horrible service.
Shay D.,"Reno, NV",25,40,5,3.0,11/1/2011,I've been here a few times... For some odd reason its my friends favorite place. i think that the beers and the bar is pretty good. However we never go there just for drinks we order a lot of food and i think that they're food is really generic and not always fresh. too bad i'll try introducing my friends to places like Great basin brewing company
Kathleen R.,"Reno, NV",0,5,,2.0,7/13/2014,Mom/ son night out for dinner.  Couldn't decide....this was close...we were greeted promptly with no wait for a seat. They were busy at 5ish on a Thursday. Our first time with a huge menu and our waitress was right there asking if we were ready to order.Umm noo.  When we were ready he ordered a French dip although I think they call it something else. I ordered scallops with angel hair pasta peppers cheese etc... the scallops were perfectly cooked but the rest Bab joy one iota of salt pepper or anything to elevate that pasta.   It was likeeating water. Sons sandwich was juost so so....we probably won't go back.  Nothing ventured nothing gained......
Emily S.,"Reno, NV",2,1,,5.0,12/31/2012,"The food was so amazing. It made my mouth water before I even got my food. Service was good, a little slow, but as expected, it was crowed for a Tuesday afternoon."
Miracle G.,"Alameda, CA",61,113,192,4.0,4/2/2012,":D This chain has consistently kept their image: Great food. Even greater drinks and a super long line! I order their Jambalaya and always make it a point to separate the dish in half. It is HUGE! The pazzoookiissss are to die for! I know it's just a cookie topped with ice cream, but oh man, how can you not get happy with that combo! Another stample that goes fab with my jambalaya is their Peachy Keen Sangria! YUMMMMMMMMMM! Just thinking about a glass of such makes me want to head to BJ's!  Do make it a point to make reservations if your party will be large. To get seated faster if you're unable to make a reservation, head straight to that bar!!!! Open seating all day! Can't get any better to get the night started! :D"
Brian B.,"Minden, NV",0,10,6,1.0,12/27/2014,"I have been here before and am always baffled that there's a wait,  it's really just slightly above average bar food.  We were told it would be a 50 minute wait for our party of 8.  After an hour of waiting and watching ~15 parties of 4-6 get seated that had just walked in, we left.  Can't they just put 2 tables together??  I YELP'ed for nearby restaurants and found the Twisted Fork.  I called them and they said they could accommodate us immediately.  We were treated to great food and service and you could actually have a conversation without yelling at each other.  I highly recommend the The Twisted Fork, a bit more expensive but WAY better food."
Alicia S.,"Puyallup, WA",212,141,29,3.0,6/24/2013,A decent chain restaurant. Their prices are a little bit high for the quality of the food. They do have pretty good serving sizes though. The staff is pretty friendly and the restaurant was clean. Won't be at the top of my list but if I was in town and needed the convenience I would visit it again.
