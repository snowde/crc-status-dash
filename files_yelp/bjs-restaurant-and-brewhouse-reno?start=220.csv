Katrina H.,"Spokane, WA",7,21,2,5.0,4/11/2011,"YUMMY! Their avacado egg rolls are the best! I love their food so much. Whenever my boyfriend and I get a chance we head out to BJ's! Best Restraunt in Reno imho!  Their Irish Root beers are awesome, tastes just like a root beer float. Their servers are friendly and helpful, and their food is awesome, although the Jambalya is a little too spicy for me. :sadface: I even brought my 8 y/o niece here once they have a great selection for the kids menu even though she claimed the spaghetti was too spicy, I didn't believe it for a second though.  The price range is about the same as macaroni grill so not super expensive but not cheap either.  If you plan on making reservations, keep in mind you can only make them 45 minutes in advance!"
Steve R.,"Aurora, CO",171,743,269,3.0,12/29/2010,Decent food. Service was a bit slow. Overall a solid 3 experience. Small bathroom for a restaurant with bar - it had only 2 urinals inside.  Servers seemed to be distracted or had too many tables. If you've been to one BJ's you've pretty much been to them all.
Patrick W.,"Gardnerville, NV",1,20,3,2.0,7/12/2013,"On our second visit to this eatery, we were confronted with very sluggish service and food which was lackluster at best. I ordered the NY strip and paid extra for the mushroom sauce. When the meal finally appeared, there was no sauce. I had to track down the waiter who returned with the steak a short time later. I counted three tiny mushroom slivers on the top of the steak. When I asked where the mushrooms were in the ""mushroom sauce"" the waiter replied, ""Oh, you cant see them because they have been cut in tiny pieces and mixed into the sauce!"" Really? Then he proceeded to try and sell us more add-ons to the meal!"
p n.,"Reno, NV",1,48,,2.0,8/5/2010,"Went here 2 1/2 years ago and promised not to return after trying a few very greasy appetizers and lousy craft beers.  Went back a few days ago to meet a client. For the love of God, I can't figure out why this place is still busy. The food is just okay, the craft beers are still lackluster and it's very expensive. $12 for a salad....for lunch! Plus, I ordered an Arnold Palmer (iced tea and lemonade) and it was awful. Sweet tea and sour lemonade is supposed to balance out the flavor, but this thing was like sucking on a very bitter lemon. How do you screw that up? Pucker up.....I won't be back."
J L.,"Reno, NV",1,17,4,3.0,6/28/2012,Love this place but tonight was definitely a different experience for me. Service was very slow and with all the people working and standing around in there I was beyond confused why one person was expected to run the whole bar area... Food was not as great as usual either. Just not cooked all the way and looked a bit hurried on the plate. Pazookie wasn't even cooked. Oh well... There's always next time
Jace P.,"San Francisco, CA",45,80,3,5.0,8/17/2010,"I really wasn't expecting to be impressed by BJ's.  It's a chain, after all, and even in a swanky outdoor mall like The Summit, chain dine-in places like this are usually unimpressive and overpriced. However, BJ's is awesome.  Every time I try something different, it's delicious.  Here are my favorites: - Chicken Fried Steak.  Their gravy is nice and peppery.  The steaks are thicker than most, more flavorful, and they aren't deep fried.  The cheddar mashed potatoes are amazing, and the vegetables are good, too. - Pizza.  Any of their pizzas are awesome.  Usually pizza in a place like this is more of an afterthought, but apparently BJ's started as a pizza place.  It carried through.  Deep dish crust is crispy and golden on the outside and soft on the inside, not too thick, and they don't overload it with cheese or toppings. - Piranha Pale Ale Chili.  They put this on quite a few menu items, and it's really good chili.   - Chicken wings.  They're not the ""tossed"" style of wing you find at some places, where they deep fry or bake the wings until they're done and then toss them in a sauce.  These are brushed with the sauce and THEN cooked, and that's how I prefer them.  Very good.  - Avocado egg rolls.  Deep fried won-ton wrappers filled with cream cheese and avocados and served with sweet dipping sauce.  Awesome? - Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  It's pounded super thin, the breading is great, and they serve it with a delicious creamy lemon sauce and mashed potatoes. The only time I was disappointed here was when I ordered a salad.  Service is always great, prices are reasonable, they have handcrafted sodas and beers, and they're open late.  What's not to like?"
Stephanie P.,"Salem, OR",38,4,,5.0,6/14/2013,"I got the blackened chicken salad and it was probably the best salad that I have ever had, I also had the stuffed mushrooms and they were very good. I had delivery and it was here in a very reasonable amount of time. :=)"
Joe H.,"Reno, NV",1,8,,5.0,5/10/2014,Our regular place after kids sports such as swimming and baseball.  Extensive gluten free menu and great beer selection
Scott R.,"Coronado, CA",86,85,37,4.0,11/27/2010,"They have a fantastic beer selection, their originals are award winning and taste like it! The menu is perfect for stuffing your face and their deep dish brings me back to Lincoln Park, Chicago. Service is spotty, but the food and drink make up for it. Also, a really great place to watch the game if there is room at the bar."
David B.,"Reno, NV",12,49,56,4.0,11/1/2010,"I can't pass up Avocado egg rolls with cream cheese, pine nuts and lots of soft avocado in a crispy fried shell, cut on the bias with a sweet dipping sauce. Usually I try to cover the menu a bit at a restaurant, but in my almost 20 visits to BJs in the last 3 years I rarely stray from one order--the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon and a root bear in a frosty mug so cold it's icy. The salmon is always fresh, never fishy, and hot, contrasting temperature with the cold salad with its savory, spicy, Santa Fe dressing with crispy multi-colored crunchy tortilla strips and lots of avocado. Once I tried the cajun shrimp tacos lunch special and enjoyed them thoroughly. My only disappointment was that each of 2 tacos only had 3 small shrimp and lots cabbage slaw. They were still good though frugal. Their pizzas are rich and filling and well worth the entree prices. The 14-inch is usually good for 2 meals it's so thick and heavy."
Denise J.,"Reno, NV",77,31,,4.0,6/28/2012,"I love BJ's! Love their drinks and food! Great place to have a good time with friends and family. They have good happy hour specials and their pizzas are delicious! Their craft beers are good. My favorite is their porter. They have a large menu of food to choose from. So there's definitely something on there for everyone. As for desserts, I love their pizookies! Fresh baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream! YUMM!"
Rick S.,"Reno, NV",0,8,1,1.0,2/25/2014,"Will not go here again. Tired of being ignored. Tonight was the last straw. Took 50 minutes for a salad, fish tacos, and chicken fingers to come out. Eagerly await the coming of Cheesecake."
Tori E.,"Napa, CA",340,272,90,4.0,10/27/2009,"I actually really liked this BJ's. We got lucky and had a great waitress, who was really patient with me and my friend being super indecisive (and obnoxious after a few beers.)  The food was standard BJ's food, which isn't bad at all. Its better than most other chain restaurants, and I found it to be the best choice out of the chain restaurants in this shopping center. Will be back!"
J D.,"Reno, NV",38,98,2,3.0,9/2/2009,"Hit-and-Miss food, but a good Belgian beer selection. The first several times we ate at BJ's, I wasn't really that impressed with the food, but we do like their beer menu, so we go there pretty often just for a couple of brews and some appetizers.   Finally I found a meal I do like here - their jambalaya. It was filled with chicken, shrimp, and lots of other goodies. I love cajun-style food and I do admit that BJ's is a huge chain and for that you can't expect gourmet results, but the jambalaya wasn't bad at all. And a BIG portion."
Stephanie N.,"Reno, NV",24,5,,1.0,2/9/2014,"I have seen this place many times and decided to give it a try with my husband. He had been going on and on about wanting to have dinner here for a while. We had tried previously to go to the Sparks N.V. location for some soup and hamburger and it was very good. We thought we'd try dinner. Normally we go to Texas Roadhouse or Tamarack Junction. This was a bad choice. The service spot on, our waiter Nate was excellent. Attentive, engaging, funny and my husband with no filter usually banters and Nate was laughing and just as funny. He made suggestions everything sounded like it would awesome. This however was not the case. I ordered chicken parm, my husband Joe ordered balsamic chicken. He also ordered salad and I had stuffed mushrooms Joe is allergic to them. The salad looked really good, look being the key word it was a bit wilted and it was to sweet and the lettuce tasted odd. He thought it was his imagination he asked me to taste it. It was not is imagination. I then had the mushrooms with spinach. They were very good, I am picky because my favorite place to any kind of stuffed mushrooms another chain. Carino's in south Reno N.V. Nate came back he was very nice and fast service. He then brought out dinner. I took one bit of the chicken parm it was ok, sauce was way to bitter.Joe's was way to sweet for him we switched. It was tolerable, but still tasted funky.  We then tried desert. I will say the pazookie as the hot cookie deserts with ice cream on top very good. I had red velvet and Joe had Oreo cookie. Dinner pricing was a little high just shy of $60.00. For what we had food wise not worth it. I am usually very hesitant to review like this, but I was so bummed. Again could have been an off night, but I doubt it."
Rose F.,"South San Francisco, CA",42,422,504,4.0,8/23/2010,"We always come here before a movie at Century Summit. The location is perfect close to shopping, theater and highway.  I always get an ice tea and sampler of their handcrafted beers (the BJ's Brewhouse Blondie is my favorite).  The nice cold beer on a hot day in Reno-it hits the spot.  I like everything on the menu especially the deep dish pizza the BJ's Favorite and I always save room for dessert a Chocolate Chunk Pizookie.   The dim lighting is perfect to watch a sporting event or have a romantic dinner for two.  The service is pretty good most of the time."
John M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",146,134,1,2.0,10/4/2009,"I really have experienced a lot better places to eat in Reno.  Frankly, this place is just a boring Brewhouse with mediocre food.  What really makes it bad, though, its the horrible treatment by the waiting staff.  Slow to refill drinks, not very friendly, not very careful.   We asked to have our checks split up, to make it easier on our group, and our waitress acted as if this was a near impossible task and gave us an attitude.   DO NOT order the Jambalaya, unless you want way too salty overly-spiced nastiness.  Two thumbs down. If you can't even do mediocre food good, you may as well give up. Save yourself the trouble of going here, you aren't missing a whole lot.  Plenty of great food in Reno give your business to."
Mark F.,"Sacramento, CA",136,61,21,1.0,1/5/2010,Stay away from the Honey Mustard Chicken Salad. It's super lettucey and not very flavorful. The Calamari was lame. So dissapointed. Nothing but calamari carcasses deep fried to death. Should've started with the Pizookie. Except they are out of the chocolate chunk cookies.  Just do youself a favor avoid this place.
Toni W.,"Genoa, NV",3,7,,3.0,4/30/2015,"I am a BJ's rewards club member and I order the exact same thing every time I go there.... Ice tea, Thai Chicken Salad with mangos and avocado...( I know, I'm one of THOSE people)..... I always sit in the bar, by myself, to avoid the wait...... Today arrived at 11:30, sat at a booth in the bar, ordered my salad...... Hmmmmm.... When it arrived, I noticed that the mango slices were very small and LIMP!! Started to eat my salad and discovered slimey lettuce..... Some, not all, but still,......Not that the server would notice, but I sure did...to me this indicates that both the mango and the lettuce had ""lived"" in the kitchen too long..... Should I have sent it back? Probably, but I can't send anything back unless it's undercooked meat..... Left at 12:30 and noticed that not only wasn't there a wait, but the restaurant was 1/2 empty!!! Having obviously enjoyed their food in the past, I'm hoping that the slimey lettuce and 1/2 empty restaurant don't indicate a bigger problem..."
Kevin N.,"Livermore, CA",3,49,1,5.0,7/8/2012,"What can I say? Great homemade sodas for the kids, hand crafted beers for the adults. Never a bad meal, be sure to try the bacon cheeseburger pizza!"
