Deb V.,"Reno, NV",0,27,,5.0,2/3/2013,"We love this place and regularly frequent it. The food is amazingly consistent, the servers are so friendly and attentive, and you have gluten free options which saves the day for me! And they are delicious as well  Thank you BJ's for being here in Reno."
Jennifer C.,"Reno, NV",8,64,3,3.0,3/14/2010,"I wouldn't expect a place to be so packed on a Sumday night, but BJ's was.  We walked in to a 25-30 minute wait at nearly 7pm. It sucked a bit since my kids were with us. Whining was had. Then they came around offering samples of pizza (a slice from a personal pan). That wins a point in book for quieting the hungry kids.  The wait time was about right, and then we were seated. Our server was nice and attentive, but the kitchen end was slow. Painfully slow. Annoyingly, painfully, disgustingly slow. Slow enough that my kids started whining again between cheese sticks and main course. From the time we arrived to the time we left it was nearing 2.5 hours. That's a little longer wait than I expect in a restaurant like this (it's a burger and beer joint after all).  The food was not blow my skirt up good or anything. The root beer is damn tasty though. I do suppose I may return sometime to check out ther beer selection, although I'd likely be better off heading to Great Basin for an excellent brew.   Maybe a different night might be better, but for now it's at 3 stars for having decent enough food and kind waitstaff."
Adam J.,"Reno, NV",102,97,1,4.0,2/16/2012,Great beer and nice service just ok food otherwise 5 star
Paul L.,"Carmel Valley, CA",50,251,3,4.0,2/25/2012,"Food was good, probably my favorite chain restaurant. The only other location I've been to was in Westwood almost twelve years ago (don't think there were very many of these restaurants back then) and I was very excited to see that they had one in Reno. It wasn't as good as I remembered it, but the pizza and pizookies were still very good. Don't know if the Westwood location is just better, or if they've sacrificed quality over the years as they expanded. The menu was huge compared to what I remember. We're getting one soon near where I live, and I'm looking forward to it (after the new wears off a bit)."
Ruth A.,"Carson City, NV",58,130,10,3.0,10/16/2011,I like BJ's but can't bring myself to give a chain restaurant more than 3 stars on principle...I am glad they have enlightened entries.
Irene C.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,48,33,3.0,10/29/2013,"I gave this BJ's a 3 because service was good but food quality was bad. I was starving after a 7.5 hour drive from Las Vegas and was desperate to get some food in my stomach. After checking in our hotel and waiting for our party to arrive, we went to BJ's Restaurant to eat an to watch the Broncos vs. Indianapolis NFL game. Broncos was losing, that already put us in a bad mood, but back to the restaurant. I ordered the Angel Hair pasta with butter and lemon with chicken. It looked good, but it didn't taste as good as it looked. I don't know what it was but it didn't hit the spot for me, even though I could've eaten anything at the time. The food server was nice enough to come back often to ask us for refills and such. By the last piece of my chicken, I gave up. I thought after every bite, it would taste better and better, but it tasted worse and worse. Maybe i'll order a pizza next time."
Marcia J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,35,,3.0,6/23/2010,"I have a part-time job in South Reno, and we frequently head to BJs after work to let off some steam.  I'm not a sports fan, so the TVs aren't really my thing.  But I think of it as something of a sports bar/ restaraunt, so I don't necessarily think they're out of place.  (I know that's not how they advertise, but the TVs make it so.)   I've had variable experience with the service.  They're always nice, but sometimes they're *very* slow.  We've had them forget to put in the order of one person or another at the table multiple times.  They typically don't charge for the meal they forget and add a free dessert when they do that, at least, but you'd think they'd do something to preven the problem in the first place...  It is loud in here during busy times, but it fits in with my thinking of it as a sports bar.  Not a good place for quiet conversation, that's for sure. I do like the food.  I can't think of a time I've been disappointed with it...  The pizzas are wonderful (though they do take awhile; order a salad to start with!), the salads are great, the sandwiches are decent, and the pasta dishes are delicious.  Not a huge selection of desserts (who doesn't have cheesecake???), but what you can get is good.   Be prepared for a wait if you go Friday or Saturday night!  They do sometimes offer samples of their food (typically pizza) when they know they're telling people long wait times; that's always nice.  I recommend trying BJs, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because service issues are my big pet peeve."
Brittney Y.,"Reno, NV",18,18,8,5.0,1/3/2013,"I'm never unhappy with service or food here. Anything you pick off the menu is delicious. I love the sweet pig pizza, its to die for. i also love their jalapeno burger and their hefenwiezen beer."
Adriel H.,"Seattle, WA",0,28,14,3.0,12/12/2011,"My husband loves this place, so that is why we go. Here's the pros: 1. Extensive menu - there's something for everyone from health freaks to timid meat-and-potatoes eaters. 2. Giant TVs - good for watching the game, zoning out. 3. Congenial, casual but ""out for a drink"" atmosphere. Very relaxing. 4. Clean. 5. Friendly servers. 6. Great for large groups - they have the space for it, the atmosphere welcomes it, and again, that menu has something for everyone. Here's the cons: 1. It's a chain lacking personality. 2. The menu never really changes. 3. None of the food has been spectacular. Fine, but not spectacular. 4. Servers seem to not know a lot about drinks - I ordered a Black & Tan, was asked about it a few times, had to describe it, and was ultimately delivered a Guinness. At least they were sweet and took it back. I hate sending stuff back because I'm always afraid of the chef/bartender retaliation, but I didn't detect anything wrong with my subsequent Gin & Tonic."
Russell J.,"Reno, NV",2,17,6,4.0,9/29/2011,"Surprised BJ's rating is so low. I have went to BJ's many times and from the steaks to their pizza or fresh baked cookies with ice cream, it was always good. I also really like the cherry soda. Only thing you should know before you go is it can take a while to get your food. My guess is that it's always busy and it's also a very big restaurant. So expect to be there about a hour to a hour and a half."
Rick S.,"Reno, NV",47,32,36,5.0,7/9/2009,"My family ate here last weekend, and were all impressed with both the service and the food.  I had the Great White Pizza, which as Chicago pizza goes, was great (I love the thick crust and lots of cheese) our kids split the sliders with bacon (good) and Macaroni and Cheese (a little better than the blue box)  Others had a salad and a french dip, both of which had no left overs to take home (plates cleaned usually means they liked it. Suggestion:  If you know you want to go there on a Friday Night and live in the South meadows, stop by and get your name in, swing home and pick up the family and then go back.  That way you don't need to wait too long with the family. Also if you like to try beers, I highly recommend the 8 beer sampler."
R F.,"Reno, NV",7,124,8,3.0,10/6/2012,went here thursday night to get a to go food for me to take to work on friday.  we got a thai salmon and jambalaya.  my thai salmon was good... except the ends and the strings of all the snow peas (or maybe its sweet pea?  i don't know what the difference is) are all there.  either i eat the whole thing or not eat it at all because it was impossible to bite the string off.  so i wasted it and didn't eat them.  gross!  youre suppose to take those out!!!  i might not come back here.
Sharmin K.,"Reno, NV",0,6,4,1.0,1/3/2014,"What Happened to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse? It used to be good. Now it totally sucks. My whole family and I went for New Year's dinner Jan 1st, 2014 and were soo disappointed. My husband, me and my brother-in-law ordered the jalapeno burger. I asked for mine to be well done not, taste like saw dust. My husband's burger and brother-in-laws burger, even though they both asked for medium, both burgers came out tasting like saw dust. How do you screw up on a burger? It was the worst, tasteless burger ever. I seriously wanted to throw up. My kids got the 6 inch cheese pizza and they didn't want to finish eating it. My son used to love their cheese pizzas and would finish the whole thing. This time, he only had a few bites. There was no tomato sauce or paste on the pizza. THe pizza was dry. My sister and mom and dad really wanted a deep dish pizza, but they ran out. So, My sister and my mom and dad had the hand tossed vegetarian pizza. My mom was like, something's missing. Again, the pizza sauce or tomato paste was missing. That's basic. Overall, worst food ever. It's sad when McDonald's has better food than BJ's. For the last several years, it's been our family tradition to go to BJ's for New Year's dinner. Not anymore. WE'll be going somewhere else."
Nate I.,"Reno, NV",33,67,10,4.0,3/29/2011,"Good food, the pizzas here are very good.  The microbrews are good, better than most.  The red is good and so is the blonde.  Service is a tad slow, the environment is noisy but good for kids.  The pizookie cookie desert is awesome...never had a bad one."
Len R.,"Miami, FL",0,7,,4.0,6/19/2011,Upscaled bar food; varied menu; never had a bad meal. UPDATE: last time there the pasta was hard. Seems this is not a one time occurrence as Ketohu will verify in his/her review. I will leave the 4 stars until another problem occurs.
Erika S.,"Reno, NV",45,192,52,4.0,12/29/2010,"Not a corporate restaurant go'er BUT for group get together i always have several friends that want to come here. It is predicitably solid food. Ive had numerous appetizers, pizza and my favorite the Santa Fe salad with blackened shrimp. The avocado is always fresh and its a good portion for the money. The beer is ok. I usually stick to a blonde with a cider float. You can almost always expect a wait at peak times. I cannot stand the exact measure pours their bartenders are forced to practice so with that being said, stick to beer unless you would like to pay $9.50 per ounce and half of decent liquor. Id say of all the chain joints in town this is my favorite."
Jennifer R.,"Reno, NV",0,8,,5.0,7/28/2013,"This is one of our regular spots. If we done in we try to go during the week and typically not during peak hours. It can get really busy and the wait will be long otherwise. I've probably everything on the menu at least once pizza, salad, burgers, pasta, seafood, baked potatoes...and everything is great!  We usually just call ahead and pick up our food but one night (week night) we waited for about 45 just to pick up. We're pretty patient people and understand that sometimes people flood in all at once, or a business is short staffed. My husband went inside to pick up the food while I waited in the car with our toddler, after some time the manager came up and told him he was sorry he had to wait so long and gave him a $25 gift card for our next visit. That manager is pretty great, he usually makes his rounds to each table to make sure everyone is happy or if not, wants to fix the situation. We will keep coming back."
John R.,"Reno, NV",32,30,6,5.0,6/26/2010,I had never heard of this place until my girlfriend took me here. I gotta say it's the best pizza I have ever had. I can't speak about any of the other food because I have never ordered anything else except their amazing pizza.
Jen P.,"Irvine, CA",5,76,3,3.0,8/1/2010,"The food was good, but i took a star out because of service. it was a little slow. Our server forgot our order, and the appetizer came after the main course which is not what we wanted. The food was great but service could have been better,"
Robert B.,"Sparks, NV",0,5,,5.0,5/28/2011,Food and service was great. I went with a friend for lunch and we had the all you can eat soup and salad.
