Sarah S.,"Reno, NV",369,434,674,4.0,7/14/2008,"I don't really get why BJ's has such a low rating.  Maybe it just goes to show people's different opinions, but I strongly disagree with the food being bad (or disgusting, or any other negative adjective.) Most of the times that I have been here, I just sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait to be seated.  I know this is just a little thing, but they had hooks under the bar to hang purses on.  I love that!  The bartenders are always friendly and quick to bring drinks and menus. I have always gotten the Santa Fe Salad with Blackened Salmon because it is really delicious, really big, and I love it too much to try anything else!  Not hat I wouldn't want to try something else, because there are a lot of things on the menu that sound great! The last time that I went to BJs was with a VERY large group.  We decided to go on a whim, and didn't give the restaurant any notice.  For being surprised with a party of 30 all at once, they actually did seat us quite fast.  The service was good, but slow because of how many people we had.  But they did an excellent job of bringing everyone's food all at once.  I really do commend them for doing such a good job with such a large party."
Erin J.,"Sparks, NV",144,243,61,4.0,7/14/2008,"I usually get the same thing every time I go here; pizza.  Their pizza is a deep dish.  I love it, but I can understand why some people wouldn't.  The service has always been pretty good, especially considering how busy they always are.  Their alvacado rolls are to die for.  I can never pass them up.   Try to go during off hours if you dont like to wait.  I was able to finish 2 beers before being seated...but I am a quick drinker :)"
Tyler A.,"Dedham, MA",7,5,,1.0,4/16/2010,"Wont go back again. Do not order the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It is flattened skinnier than a pancake, so it was more of a overcooked chicken tender than a chicken breast. The entire meal was cold. The sun dried tomatoes were like potato chips and the sauce was like jelly. The meal took 35 minutes to arrive. When the waitress found out about the cold food, she offered to take it back for a new meal. I didn't want to wait another 35 minutes for a meal, while my party finished theirs. The manager took off the price of the meal, but I feel he should have comped us the entire meal for the whole party, as the cold food ruined it for all. This will be the last visit for us."
Trisha H.,"Reno, NV",63,258,16,5.0,7/15/2008,"I wasn't sure if  I was going to like this place, because I am not of fan of beer, and it was always so crowed to get in. It has died down a bit. Still a little wait to get in, but it is worth the wait. A friend of ours recommend raspberry ale (not sure what its called will update soon)...SOOOOOO good. That is the main reason why I go back. I have yet to find a favorite meal. But The pizza is good, and avocado egg rolls GREAT a must try! * Get there early in the afternoon/early evening. Or you will be waiting awhile."
Mia O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",88,27,1,1.0,9/7/2009,"This was one of our favorite restaurants until today.  Our order was Messed up.  Food took more than 45 minutes.  While they offered us chips and salsa, bill had to be done 3 times.  The second time had a salad charged twice. The third time they ""comped"" the second salad that shouldn't have been on there in the first place.  Waitress was apologetic.  Manager didn't come over once even though we said we were considering not  returning.  So sad..."
Kelli C.,"Reno, NV",23,46,12,2.0,6/27/2008,"I agree that the food is not great here.  I usually sit at the bar and even then it is hard to get good service. I only go here if I am shopping at the Summit, am thirsty and hungry and need a cold beer.  There is always a line, but I can usually find a place at the bar. I enjoy their seasonal brews and they will let you try a taste of something if you aren't sure."
Charlotte H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/29/2013,"Awesome food! The quality is consistently amazing. The service isn't as consistent, but usually pretty good."
Sarah R.,"Seattle, WA",79,320,37,3.0,3/20/2008,I have been to this place a handful of times.. and I haven't branched out since the first time.  The first visit I tried the appetizer egg rolls (disgusting) and was so disappointed. My friend had ordered BJ's favorite pizza and she was loving life. (despite the fact that they originally brought her pizza to the wrong table.. and it took over 30 min to get it. Her boyfriend and I had finished our dinner. They comped the meal) I took a bite of hers when it finally arrived and was sold. There's a reason it's the favorite.. it's awesome. Normally I don't go for meaty pizza since I am not super big on meat.  But damn. The service each time was just ok. Nothing extraordinary. They did bring my brother a nice desert when we had this birthday there though and the atmosphere is very comfortable.
Ketohu S.,"Reno, NV",0,3,,1.0,6/7/2011,"You know I've come to the conclusion that BJ's just doesn't care about their to-go order customers. I've gone to BJ's and enjoyed myself at the bar and with friends. But To-go is a no-go. They have pretty good food but the to-go service is $h** This is the 2nd time in a row they've screwed up my order at two different locations. The first time the girl who took my order neglected to ask which pork chop dish I wanted and just ASSUMED, which of course she got wrong. The manager offered to get me a drink which I accepted, and then he conveniently forgot about it. 20-30 minutes Later I get my food. Finally. The next time I order Spaghetti with meat sauce. I go around the mall for at least 20 minutes. I thought it would be ready by the time got back, especially considering they said 10-15 minutes when I left. Of course it's not ready. The manager said they made it for here instead of to-go. Of course he offers me a drink which I decline considering I might be waiting another 45 minutes before he gets to it. I get my food. Later on I start eating and WOW this pasta is hard! Meaning basically, they forgot about my order, cooked it as fast as they could and lied about making it for here. I'd like to give it 1 1/2 stars but nope. If you go, just eat it there. To-go from BJ's DON""T DO IT!"
Kyra S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",17,24,,5.0,4/7/2009,"Love this place, pretty much addicted to their avocado egg rolls. So far have loved everything I've ordered and it has a great atmosphere. And they're open till midnight on weekdays and 1am on the weekend...with a full menu."
Tina G.,"Lincoln, CA",5,4,,5.0,5/27/2014,"We scheduled a group party with very little notice at this establishment to celebrate my daughter's graduation from medical school. We had approximately 30 people and brought in our own cake. We ordered various appetizers, salads, pastas and entrees from the catering menu and asked that it be presented buffet style rather than family style for this event. The food was fabulous and the quantity far exceeded my expectations - we took home so much food. The atmosphere was great and very conducive to conversation and fun. The servers were not only polite but friendly and comfortable to have around. They set up the buffet beautifully and even helped serve the cake which we didn't even purchase from them. Our party was such a success that we nearly overstayed our 2 hr time limit without being aware that the time was over and we hadn't even cut the cake. They made concessions for us, allowed us to have the cake and finish up. We felt no pressure to hurry. The manager was so helpful and the staff just fabulous. They packaged up our leftovers nicely while we finished the cake and when I paid the bill, I was so surprised - we definitely got our money's worth. I would most highly recommend this restaurant for their food and their staff. If I have another group party, this is where it will be."
Chris H.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,2.0,10/7/2010,"They burnt the crap out of my take out pizza today.Seriously...I should have taken a photo...black top, black middle...but soft crust?  Up until today I would have given them 3-4 stars mostly because it's a decent place to take the family or indecisive folks. Typical brewhouse fare.  My wife loves the buffalo chicken pizza but it just doesn't agree with me. I suppose some of the appetizers aren't bad..and the crusted chicken is ok. Beer is so-so."
lee r.,"Reno, NV",2,3,,3.0,4/7/2009,"This is your standard run of the mill corp/chain restaurant/brewery.  The food is always OK.  The service can be hit or miss depending on the kid you get and how busy they are. If you like the Olive Garden, PF Chang, Red Lobster or the like you will love BJ's. The hours are the best in Reno"
Kristy K.,"San Francisco, CA",4,19,,1.0,12/24/2008,"I had THE WORST service experience of my dining career at this restaurant. It's been about a year and a half since I had my lovely experience, so maybe the service is better, but I will never go back. Now, the story: We arrived and there was a wait, no big deal, so we decided to wait in the bar. The service in the bar was fine and the hostesses sat us as soon as they could, no complaints with these aspects of the service. However, I cannot say the same for our server once we sat down. She came and took our order and then everything went downhill. I had ordered an appetizer to share with one of my friends, we expected the service to be slow, but we never received our appetizer or saw our server. We asked the woman who brought our pizza, I'm assuming the food runner, and she had no clue, our server didn't come back after we had asked. We decided to ask one of the hostesses where our server was as we had no idea what she looked like. After all, we had only seen her once. Finally, our server came back to our table. She was clueless as to the fact that we didn't get our appetizer then proceed to launch into a speech where she called the chefs/cooks in the kitchen ""RETARDED""  and explained that we should really come back on a Tuesday or Wednesday because that's when they are okay. (Really? You can only eat at this restaurant 2 out of the 7 days in a week?) This was quickly followed by ""and don't ask the host staff anything because they're retarded too"". All 5 of us at the table were completely shocked by her speech, I would think the owner would be mortified to know that these were the explanations given by one of his staff members. Then after the appetizer STILL didn't come, we again had to flag her down to tell her that we simply didn't want it anymore (assuming she had put the order through in the first place). She came over to our table with an empty, dirty glass from another table. When she left the table, she left the dirty glass sitting right next to me. At this point, I really thought that maybe I was on some sort of TV show where they test your patience. The manager came over and gave us free dessert, blah blah blah. As we were getting ready to leave, we all decided that we were still pretty disturbed by the whole ""retarded"" speech so one of the members of my group decided to let the manager know why we were not leaving a tip. He took the check over to her while the rest of us waited by the door. As we were waiting, our server walked by a few times and then finally came up to one of us and asked if she had given us our bill. SERIOUSLY? This is the most clueless server I have ever met, with absolutely ZERO people skills who should never be waiting table because she can't seem to figure out which way is up or down.  Because of this ridiculous experience, I am giving BJ's 1 star, if I could give it 0, I would. The food really wasn't very impressive and the service was beyond horrible. I guess it's not fair to judge an establishment based on one employee, but I really can't bring myself to go back."
Christy W.,"Erie, PA",7,42,3,4.0,7/6/2009,"I went to BJ's late last night and they were seemed happy to serve us.  I have always enjoyed their beers and the staff seems pretty knowledgeable. I recommend doing the beer sampler so you can try a little bit of all the beers. I usually get the deep dish pizza and a wedge salad, which you can't go wrong with.  I've never had a problem with the service (knock on wood).  Not the best location for me but worth the drive."
peg w.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",4,148,7,3.0,5/29/2011,"Food, service, and price all good BUT, they now serve instant coffee, instead of brewed.  This is terrible and when we complained to the manager he was complacent.  Later we found out he is not a coffee drinker so has no appreciation for a good cup of java.  So, if you come here to eat and want coffee, bring your own !"
Barbara M.,"Napa, CA",0,21,1,4.0,8/22/2010,I don't really venture out far from the things I like on the menu so today I stuck to my usual of the crispy chicken honey mustard salad and the amazing avocado rolls. The avocado rolls are what keep me coming back for more! They're delicious!
Sean S.,"Reno, NV",5,82,1,4.0,5/23/2011,"I first had Bj's Pizza before this place was a chain, they had a location down on the Newport Peninsula Called Bj Grunts ... might still be there.... but either way, it was, hands down the most amazing pizza, ever.   Yes, as is usual when a small thing goes big, the quality has dipped slightly, but not much!  Bj's pizza, while filling, is SOOOO good!  I have eaten at several different BJ's, their consistently good...  I would suggest givin' it a go."
Greg H.,"Chico, CA",0,8,,5.0,9/8/2009,Great Beer...  Great food..   Nice casual atmosphere.. This place was awesome...     I came here for lunch on a weekend and they rocked.  No complaints.
Steven B.,"Reno, NV",1,16,16,2.0,6/26/2007,"The beer is too industrial, not enough craft. The cask conditioned beer is the best thing they have but usually served a bit too warm; more room temperature than cellar temperature."
