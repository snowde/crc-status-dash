Bill T.,"Carson City, NV",1,4,,2.0,2/27/2011,"Driving back home from Reno back to Carson City as my wife and I decided to try BJ'S Restaurant  and Brewhouse for dinner.  I was actually excited to try  BJ'S  out as I've not eaten at this restaurant before it looked great from the outside but was less than impressed with the service and food. We had proceeded to order as the server came to take our order started with soup and salad but couldn't start till napkins and silverware was asked for , no smile or even a simple your welcome. Normally with soup I would like to be offered rolls or even crackers but as I asked the reply was"" we don't usually give it out unless you ask "" I would hope that maybe instead of waiting for the guest to ask that  the servers would be first to inquire as part of guest service. I had the new item gilled center cut pork chops and my wife the Grilled chicken and sesame asian salad. I must say the pork chops dish and salad display was fantastic but now the taste well the pork was a bit dry with not alot of flavor however the second pork chop was cooked much better don't know why but it was. The salad was very tasty  once we had more dressing. Overall I would like to say We were a bit dissapointed"
V A.,"Incline Village, NV",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2009,"BJ's is a chain restaurant that I've eaten at in a few states. Came in for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend and her baby son. Hostess sat us right away. The waitress got us menus and got our drink orders in. We ordered potato skins, a pasta dish, and a sandwich for lunch. We asked to get the potato skins before our meals.  We had to ask our waitress twice on the status of our food of which she answered that it would be up soon. The restaurant wasn't slammed and she only had a few tables that seemed to get their food earlier than us. We were polite and not rude to her but she deliberately neglected us. It took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food and she completely forgot our potato skins. To make things worse, my friend ordered a lunch plate and got the entree plate instead. To make matters worse, our food came out cold.  We were annoyed and didn't want to wait another 45 minutes so we sucked it up and ate what they brought out. I politely asked her to remove the skins order from our check which she did and with a huff left our table without even an apology. As we neared the end of our meal, she suddenly became more attentive and asked us if everything was alright. She finally realized that her tip amount was in jeopardy and tried to make up for her lack of service during and prior to getting our food. We got the check, and I paid and left her a 15% tip. I normally tip 20% minimum but her service sucked. My friend told me not to leave her anything but that would have been rude and I would have been playing the waitresses game. We complained to the manager who neither apologized or even seemed to care.  This seems to be typical of all restaurant personnel here in Reno. Hence, why Reno is still just a small cow town and not a real city. The only places where the service is just superb is The Steakhouse at Harrah's or Bistro 7, otherwise every joint that call themselves a restaurant in Reno just lack in providing any quality service. It's ironic because the heart of Reno is it's service industry.  I would not recommend BJ's at the Summit at all. There are other brewery/restaurants in Reno that provide a better experience."
Tracy S.,"Reno, NV",345,683,631,1.0,3/10/2008,"I have been a big fan of the BJ's in Belmont Shore for many years.  In fact, that location is so good and so cool that I never even knew it was part of a chain until one opened in Reno.  So finally Husband and I decided to take the long trek out to the far south end of town to eat at our own, local BJ's.  What a HUGE disappointment!!  Just.  Horrible.  First of all, it has become an atrocious chain restaurant with all of the chain marketing bullshit all over the place, and the chain design of fitting hundreds of people under one huge roof, packed together like sardines.  I'll hit Olive Garden if I want THAT kind of dining experience!  The service was too fast and too sloppy, and while we were rushed through our meal we got the pleasure of watching the server at the table next to ours spill an entire tray of drinks all over her diners.  The house salad, for which we were charged a mind-boggling $5, had obviously been sitting in the fridge all day, and was just a handful of dried-out iceberg with a few strands of carrots.  The pizza--the same pizza I love in Belmont Shore!--was atrocious.  Truly, I could microwave better pizza than that.  I imagined that somewhere in the kitchen somebody WAS microwaving pizzas.  If you want a brewhouse, go to Silver Peak or Great Basin...this place is the pits!!  You are warned."
