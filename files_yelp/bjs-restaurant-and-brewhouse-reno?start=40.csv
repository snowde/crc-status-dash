Katherine R.,"Rodeo, CA",48,91,,2.0,9/5/2017,It was ok - it is a chain and has a lot of bar food kinda thing.
John K.,"Everett, WA",0,6,1,5.0,9/26/2017,Bartender Ted provided outstanding customer service - give the guy a raise! He is a shinning star and should be recognized as a leader of the industry. Great selection of beers - True to style.  Enjoyed the fresh chips and guacamole. Very reasonable prices - Where do you find craft beer for $3.95 anymore. Keep up the good work.
Tarryn B.,"Reno, NV",85,58,109,4.0,7/23/2016,"We had a great family dinner. The service was wonderful. We didn't even have to wait for more than 2 minutes for a table, which was surprising for prime time on a Saturday night. We were served in no time, and everything was really tasty. I got the Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were delicious. It was a good environment for the kids too. It wasn't too quite so we weren't getting stated at for every little noise the kids made. The pizooki desert was a wonderful way to top off a wonderful evening. My only issuer was that we paid on the new mobile app too quickly and they wouldn't reimburse my offer for a free pizooki. :-/"
Walter W.,"Reno, NV",27,45,6,4.0,2/14/2017,"I always find myself ...."" let's go to bj's""  Service is a hit or miss but usually pretty good..... if you know your way around the menu that you'll be able to find some delicious choices for food. Beers are also great here..... not to mention the draft sodas..... it has to be a good soda if I consider ordering it over a beer!"
Mary Jane S.,"Reno, NV",94,81,549,4.0,7/1/2016,"Always a great place to meet up with friends or eat out with the family. Extensive menu means it's easier to satisfy everyone's palate. I like that they have some ""healthy"" options too so that you can binge on a pizookie (warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream) at the end of your meal. Only downside sometimes is that depending on how busy they are - service can be a bit slow. If you sign up for their free rewards program, you can rack up points to get $5, $10 and even $25 off future visits and be in the know about new menu options and promotions they have going on. So for a big chain restaurant I give them a thumbs up."
Kathleen O.,"Reno, NV",0,20,,1.0,9/5/2017,The food and service were as expected. We tried the Piadina which was good. The reason for the low rating was because of the extremely LOUD music overhead. Our server asked several times for the volume to be lowered. Each time she asked she was told only 1 person could lower the volume and he was on the line and too busy. We tried yelling to have a conversation but gave up. We did appreciate that the chain had a $3.00 dessert with 100% of the proceeds going to Harvey victims.
Andrea Harrison M.,"Reno, NV",12,60,15,5.0,12/5/2016,This is my favorite pizza in town! It's so delicious. When my husband goes out of town I order one of these and the leftovers are magic and comforting! It's the best tasting leftover from any restaurant I have ever eaten!  The potato skins are truly magic w ranch. So crunchy and flavorful. Everything was wonderful! I announced my babies gender here. I love the building layout and always worth the wait. A lot of great spots to take photos. And service is wonderful. Always spot on. They have half off pizza mondays and I hope this continues. My fav thing is ordering before hand and picking it up to go. So fast and so yummy! Oh my gosh I am leaving for BJs right now lol!  And my husband who doesn't drink much-- found a really good drink he loved and had three of them. The drinks are amazing. My kids love this place also! It's a win for everyone especially a large family outing.
Jim O.,"Reno, NV",0,2,,3.0,3/5/2017,"Service is friendly and staff well trained.  It does have a corporate feel, but not necessarily in a bad way.  The food is always good, considering what you are paying for, glorified brewery food.  The problem here is always the same, slow food service.   The appetizer, potstickers, took more than 20 minutes and the entrees, ordered at the same time an additional 20.  Ok for fine dining but not a casual brewery.  I'm not sure what the hang up is in the kitchen?  Usually the restaurant is full but tonight it was only maybe 2/3 full.   We were celebrating a birthday tonight so speed wasn't crucial, and the complimentary pizookie is a nice touch!"
Taylor R.,"Reno, NV",468,204,232,4.0,4/17/2016,"I'll admit, I was a self proclaimed BJ's hater. The menu is gargantuan and I never was able to find a thing that I liked for the life of me! Every trip, no matter what city or town I was in, I couldn't find a single thing I liked! Then, I found the avocado burger! And turned 21 and found the beer section..  The girls at the front were not very friendly but you only deal with them for a minute so, no biggie.  Our server was Scott. He was so so SO awesome. Seriously, he explained the peach beer to a freakin T. He always had a smile on his face and did a great job explaining the food if we had any questions. My parents said they often have him as their server when they go and he is always that friendly.  The burger was good. Not my favorite I've ever had, but good. The guacamole was delicious, but the burger wasn't cooked the way I asked. I probably wouldn't pick to order it again, only because as I previously said, the menu is so huge I would want to try something a little different!"
Mary L.,"Reno, NV",146,348,52,5.0,3/16/2016,"This is a pretty solid restaurant! The staff is nice and efficient! The food is consistently good. The beer is enjoyable! The only draw back to this place is on Friday and Saturday night you can expect to wait a while(which is only really a testament to how good it is!). On these nights we usually just call in our order, and take it to go!  With the very diverse menu, this is a pretty good choice to take guests! My favorites are the pizza!!!! (Seriously to die for!) the pulled pork sandwich! And The parmesan crusted chicken! Oh ya and the tomato soup! And the pizzoke! (Or how ever it's spelled!) what's a pizzoke.... It's a cookie baked in a deep dish pizza pan, served warm with ice cream scooped on top..... Kiss that diet good bye, cause you need to order this!!  Overall, for a chain restaurant, this is one of our favorites! But, plan ahead! If it's 6:30 on a Saturday night, be prepared to wait, get it as take out, or go elsewhere! Cause everyone in town will be here!"
Tam N.,"Reno, NV",69,21,,5.0,12/8/2016,"BJ's is a place we visit often and it's usually great for lunch or dinner. I really like their mobile app and they usually have a deal going on that you can take advantage of from the app.  Food is good, a lot of variety so if you're bringing picking eaters with you, there should be something for everyone.  The service is also very good. We don't seem to ever get the same waiter twice but nonetheless they're all very nice. Management is also really good. There was a couple of times where our order was lost and the comped is our meal to make up for our long wait. I really appreciate the gesture as opposed to other restaurant chains out there."
Serena L.,"Reno, NV",291,62,53,4.0,3/15/2017,"BJ's is usually the place my friends and I end up at when we can't decide on where to go.  Ive been here many times, and their food is really good.  I have tried the healthy kale and Brussel sprout (really good salad), root beer ribs (my friends favorite), chicken tenders and fries (when I'm poor/ can't decide what to get).  Also my group of friends LOVE the avocado egg rolls. In my opinion they taste better than the ones at Cheesecake Factory. My friend ordered nachos one time and when it came out we were so shocked at the generous amount they gave us.  We couldn't finish cause it was so filling we took it home for lunch the next day. Their famous pizookie is to die for.  I usually go for the Oreo pizookie, and my friends like the salted caramel.  I recommend getting the large pizookie platter to share with your friends (it's like $5 each if you share with 4 other ppl).  Ive also had their jambalaya, which is sooo good (a little pricier).  Most of their dishes are around $15-$20, so go for a more casual event out with friends."
James B.,"Sparks, NV",232,143,189,4.0,3/5/2016,"Tonight's experience is what we expect when we come to BJ's!   Sure it is usually pretty loud, and tonight was no exception, but we don't come here for the ambiance.  Emily had a the Blonde and I had the piranha to drink.   For dinner Emily got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was lacking in sauce, but Kelsey pour server corrected this with some sauce on the side .   I ordered a new dish North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp.  The fish while cooked perfectly could have used a little more seasoning.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sauce that covered the dish and the couscous were both very tasty.  This is a dish I will get again!"
Maxine T.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",9,41,20,5.0,6/4/2016,"I love, love, love this BJ's! The servers are friendly, and the food is always great. I had the full rack pork baby back ribs, and it was the bomb! The pork was tasty, and fall-off-the-bones tender. I didn't even have to use any utensils. :) $22.50 for the full rack, $18.50 for the half-rack, so I'd say go big!"
Stacia D.,"Reno, NV",186,121,153,1.0,1/15/2016,"Bjs by the summit mall is usually packed, so my husband and I decided to bypass the wait and got our food to go.  He called, talked to Brooke, and ordered 2 bowls of soup and asked if they still had pumpkin ale to fill our growlers. She said they did, and that our order would be ready in 20 minutes.  When we arrived, we parked in the to go parking but decided to go in to get the growlers filled. I was super excited about the pumpkin ale, it's my favorite! We walked in the TO GO entrance and was greeted by Brooke and another young boy. There were a small group of younger teens standing there talking to both employees, but stepped to the side for their friends to help Us.  We told them the name on the order and she quickly rang it up. ""Your total is 45.34."" She proudly announced. I do not think anywhere do you fill two 32 oz growlers and get two bowls of soup does it cost 45 dollars sweet girl. Matt and I both look at each other, and said what is so expensive? She told Us the growlers were 12.50 a piece and the bowls of soup were 7 apiece and Matt's bread bowl made up the extra. I turned around to look at their very large sign that says ""32 oz growlers refills 6 dollars. I turn back around and ask her if that's still the current price. She starts laughing and says ""oh I always do that. Sorry you are right, let me go find my manager to correct this.""  She takes the growlers and scours the store to find a manager. 5 minutes later she returns and corrects the bill with her manager's slide card. No manager though. She rings Us up for 30 dollars. This seems more appropriate. I hand her my card and she prints me a receipt. She walks away to the bar to check on the growlers. She quickly comes back and hands me the menu. She explains they are in fact out of pumpkin ale.  In between trying to help Us, Brooke is busy trying to ""hang out"" with this group of friends that happens to be hanging around. Very unprofessional. WHERE IS HER SUPERVISOR??!  At this point I'm frustrated with her. We specifically asked when we called if they had the pumpkin ale and she said she checked and they in fact did. Then with all the wrong totals, waiting for her to fix it etc I almost just asked for her to give me our money back, But since we had been waiting to eat now for close to an HOUR I decided to just follow through with our original plan. My husband and I picked two other beers for the growlers to be filled with. We waited another 10 minutes and left.  When we got home we take our soups out of the bag and they aren't even luke warm. Am I surprised? No. The soup wasn't even enough to fill Matt's bread bowl. We are thinking she gave Us cups of soup instead of bowls even though we paid for bowls. From start to finish this experience was TERRIBLE! Brooke needs training!!! :( our check was wrong, we were given incorrect information, our order was wrong. Bummer. Won't get to go from here again."
Carlene B.,"Reno, NV",14,4,5,1.0,10/1/2017,"First of all, let me state that BJ's has delicious food and I highly recommend them. Their staff are friendly and accommodating.  That being said... the ""delivery service"", that is supposed to deliver food is a joke.... and not a funny one. I'm STILL two and a half hours in of waiting... and surprise, surprise!... the restaurant said they never even received the order. O' but I've been charged! Awesome. Because a military widow with two kids to feed can spare a little cash?!?!?!"
Derek B.,"Las Vegas, NV",94,9,5,2.0,5/12/2017,"We came to BJ's for a celebration dinner. We had the table spilt into the three for the different families. One of the members were confused about the setup and asked for the waitress to explain. Our waitress was named Anna V. and was extremely rude and condescending. She got into our faces and treated us like we were children. If the dinner hadn't been planned before hand, I would have gotten up and left. They only redeeming factors were the other employees that were helping. The food was good, but the waitress was terrible."
Shira M.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",53,114,113,3.0,12/29/2016,"So sad. I was just looking for a good burger. It was greasy. The bun was greasy, the burger was greasy, the veggies were greasy lacked color and taste. The wedge fries and the BBQ sauce were good. The only reason I still gave it 3 stars were because the yummy amber beer and excellent service.  As a chain like BJ's you have to have a good burger. But not here."
John C.,"Reno, NV",0,4,,2.0,5/8/2017,"Stopped in early Friday evening and were seated promptly any later and there would have been a long wait.  Nice atmosphere, a little noisy.  Food was OK, but I felt it was pricey for what we ordered."
Olivia T.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",55,2,,2.0,5/24/2017,"This was our second time coming to this bjs in town and both times we had similar problems. The first time it took close to 30 minutes for a burger and sandwich on a weekday. When the food arrived it was clear it had been sitting a while. The bread was soggy and the fries were cold.  Tried again today, a Wednesday, and received the same quality service. Ordered a pizza for my husband, I saw that the spicy pig was on tavern cut so I figured ordering a spicy pig would be specific to that style of pizza. Waitress didn't ask if I wanted tavern or deep dish. Ordered a steak dip for me. We waited for 30 minutes and watched people who had come in 10-15 minutes after us get their food. We asked what was up and they said the an jus for mine was what they were waiting for. AU JUS! Which meant yet again our food was sitting and getting soggy. Right before the food got there a spider fell in my lap!! I freaked obviously and the waitress said is it gone? And we said we think so and then she left! No apologies or empathy or anything. Food got there and I'm feeling my skin crawl. My husband got a deep dish instead of tavern cut. Wish we'd been asked what we preferred instead of having it assumed. And both of our dishes were soggy. We just asked for the check so we could leave. The waitress said ""sorry about all the stuff"" and handed us a check for $50.  We only eat out once a week so it sucks when our date night meal is crappy as hell."
