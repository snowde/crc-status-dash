Ed K.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",1,22,,2.0,4/3/2017,"Service was friendly, but not very attentive. Very expensive for basic bar food. I pointed to the menu and told the server I would like this pizza and salad, he looked at it and said okay. On the menu it said $8.50... the bill came and it was $16.50... I asked the server and he said it is only $8.50 Monday - Thursday. Pizza was basically a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza that cost a lot more. If you like overpaying for mediocre chain food, this is your place."
Jen W.,"San Francisco, CA",695,1379,2318,4.0,12/31/2014,"I'm glad that there's a BJ's out here.  It gives me a late night option to grab some beer and pizza after a long day.   In Elk Grove, BJ's was a staple for us because well, nothing else was open that late after work.  I am also used to long waits but this location was empty.  There were only 4 other people at the bar around midnight.  The service was the best I've ever received at BJ's probably because of the lack of customers.  In any case, it was still awesome.   The bartender poured me a heavy vodka soda drink.  Thank you.  Haha.  The jeremiah red is also a staple of ours.  They even offered us a sample of their seasonal beer.   We normally order the same things...1/2 great white, 1/2 BJ's favorite, wings, and a caesar salad.  This time, we switched out the caesar for a beet salad.   Everything was what I expected...not the best...but great for a nightcap.  Take advantage of their happy hour for discounted drinks and food.   3.5 stars rounded up to 4."
Jean F. W.,"Reno, NV",6,112,,4.0,2/18/2017,"Went to lunch with the girls and it was SLAMMING busy 1pm but it didn't hinder our service. I almost NEVER order spaghetti and meatballs EVEN in a Italian place BUT the picture looked so good and it was one of the lunch specials. I really liked it, two very big meatballs that were flavorful and tender,and the sauce was mild but tasty and it was served over angel hair pasta. I was VERY impressed. Thank you BJ'S for a nice lunch ( hard to come by)"
Amanda P.,"Carson City, NV",84,55,121,4.0,8/16/2016,"If I ever had a complaint about BJ's it would only be that they are decently expensive. However, I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for.  I've never had a complaint with any of the items I have gotten from BJ's, and they are pretty consistent given they are a chain restaurant."
Rei R.,"Reno, NV",322,132,181,4.0,4/29/2016,"This review rightfully begins as a cautionary tale: WATCH. YOUR. STEP. The two-step platform from the lobby to the dining room floor is a cruel mistress that's taken many a hungry patron and rushing server alike to a short but tragic tumble to the cold and unforgiving tile. Boldfaced signage and verbal warnings only go so far to help since it's such negligible steppage. Just stay sharp to avoid falling flat on your face for all of BJ's to see. Speaking from experience: don't text and walk or these steps will make you look like a certified doofus. BJ's is my guilty pleasure chain. The quality of food is always a peg above the other casual dining joints -- never mindblowing but always satisfying -- and the service at this South Reno location has always been spot on. I am admittedly a fan of their in-house brews; I've gone through enough flights to have tried them all, and they span from meh to great. The Nutty Brewnette is probably my favorite of the bunch. I'm mad for their apps: calamari and flatbread is always a safe bet. During my last visit, I brought a party of four in for a 1:30 Tuesday lunch with virtually no wait. Not as busy and not as noisy as usual. Great. I ordered the North Beach Mahi-Mahi off of the ""EnLIGHTened Menu."" This was less of a play towards being calorie conscious and more about me just wanting some simple fish. It was a hint too bland, and I'd probably love it with something other than couscous, but it was filling. The rest of the table opted to share a large pizza. Word of warning: BJ's doesn't carry ""regular"" pizzas and only offers flatbread style tavern-cut or deep-dish, so settle on one of the extremes or peruse the other entrees. As someone who swears by Lou Malnati's, I cannot fully condone the pseudo-deep-dish travesty happening here. BJ's main feature starting out was their SoCal twist on deep-dish, but their offerings just don't measure up to a true Chicago-style pie. You're serving a meat medley quiche at best, BJ's! Honestly, I'd be up in arms in angry protest... if it wasn't so damn tasty. They turned out to be out of large chicken bacon ranch pizzas, which was initially disappointing, until management came in mega clutch, offering us a medium and a small -- which meant more square inches of fake-deep-dish goodness! God bless BJ's for giving us a marginally great alternative to the unholy horde of mid-range restaurants that litter every street corner and strip mall. My only qualm is that damned step that trips me up every visit, but even then, I'm glad that it keeps me on my toes."
T B.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,1.0,4/2/2017,"In all, I'm very disappointed with my recent order from BJ's. I placed an order for curbside take-out. The food was delivered to me within 10 minutes of my pick up time, so that wasn't too bad. The service I received was less than stellar; not too big of a deal, but it stood out to me. Once I got home and unpackaged all of the food I ordered, the small serving sizes and (lack of) freshness of the food were apparent.  The serving sizes would have been appropriate for a young child, not an adult. The chicken tender combo was missing the dipping sauce, and the chicken itself was overcooked and dry. Not unlike something you could get in the freezer aisle of your grocery store. The French fries that came with them were also old and dry. The calamari we ordered was decent. It seemed a little undercooked and overly chewy. Lastly, the salads we ordered were so light on the dressing that they might as well have been plain lettuce.  Had I paid a fraction of what this ended up costing, I wouldn't be so upset. It's way overpriced compared to most of the other chain restaurants around here. I'd eaten here a couple of years ago and had a similarly poor experience. Lesson learned. You may want to look elsewhere if you're looking for appropriately priced and edible food."
Mina O.,"Reno, NV",72,84,83,5.0,7/9/2016,"Such variety to choose from but everytime I try something new, they never fail me. Amazing dishes and good, prompt service. The salmon is out of this world and mahi mahi and shrimp tacos are so delish! Love love love it in here, as well as their red beers!"
Jeff H.,"Reno, NV",0,6,,1.0,3/19/2017,"Possibly it was a Sunday evening (5:30-6:45), possibly it was total lack of adequate training on the staff. It took FOREVER to get the food, we had one in the party that ordered off the children's menu and well he is a child (10) and they should have asked or brought his meal out as soon as possible, they did a nice job refilling the drinks early in the meal then hardly acknowledged we were even there. . . I had to stop wait people twice to ask for things, eventually the manager came over and picked up the whole tab, for the whole party.  I don't think it was 100% the servers fault, but. . . maybe, more than I think. My Girlfriend said that the BJ's in Sparks is a whole different 'feel'. . . so maybe next time we will go  there."
Julia F.,"Sun City, AZ",0,23,3,4.0,8/9/2017,"It's pretty good. Has great food, a very extensive menu and the wait staff is friendly and efficient. My only real complaint about this place is its LOUD! It's a big place with a lot of people, loud music & tv's. If you are looking for a romantic dinner for 2, this is not the place."
Evelyn S.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",1,19,,5.0,2/1/2017,Had a blast enjoyed the meal and the alcohol service was on point friendly waitresses I almost didn't wanted to leave lol
Chris M.,"Reno, NV",385,182,261,4.0,7/31/2015,"I was never really a fan of BJ's but I recently toured their brewery and it changed my outlook. Did you know they work with local farmers? ""Waste"" from the brewing process is picked up by a local farmer who uses it as feed for his cattle. It is a win-win because it frees up BJs bin and the farmer gets feed for his cattle! I would expect this from a mom and pop place but not from a chain. As for the food, I have a few things that have been really good. One of my favorites is the BBQ Bison Burger. At only 650 calories for the whole meal (it includes a slaw with a tangy dressing) The burger is ""topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, seared green chilies and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce."" I wasn't sure what to expect the first time I ordered it. I thought it might be dry but it was delicious and juicy. I couldn't wait to have it again so went back about a week later. On my most recent visit I ordered the lunch size Cajun pasta with a Caesar salad. This particular time the service wasn't so great but other times service has been fine. The Caesar salad was quite large so I wasn't able to eat much of the pasta but that turned out to be a good thing. I was able to get a whole other meal out of the pasta! Yum! The pasta had a ""creamy tomato sauce with blackened chicken breast, fire-roasted red bell peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions."" I was impressed with the chicken. It wasn't dry at all and had lots of flavor. I'm not usually a fan of red sauce but this was a creamy red sauce and had just the right amount of heat. Overall, I have become a fan of BJ's and the fact that it is near work is a plus!"
Doni V.,"Sparks, NV",207,18,61,5.0,3/18/2016,"Sam, Valerie and Ted were awesome. The food was great as usual!  Love the hopping atmosphere here."
Stacey S.,"Reno, NV",0,12,3,4.0,1/31/2017,"Went to BJ's the other day . We have been about 10 times. Always very good food. Burgers are very good, Food  portions are large, service is good considering the wait is always very long. They have a bar so you can actually order drinks while you wait. I have never gotten in under an hour. It's always at least a 45 min. wait. One of the downfalls of a good restaurant. We go there for their hamburgers but their pozza is good and their cookie ice cream brownie thingy desert (sorry can't remember the name) was stellar. Large portion  so you definitely could split it.) Only gave it 4 stars because it takes so long to get served."
Ly S.,"Reno, NV",598,208,1628,3.0,3/4/2014,"Mommy and daughter dinner time, and I chose BJ's, since it's near our house and we were indecisive about what to eat.  We were greeted immediately by the host and there wasn't any wait on this Saturday evening.  A gal asked us if we needed a kid's menu, and then we were taken to a booth. My baby girl ordered the kid's mini corn dogs with a side of steamed veggies; carrots and broccoli, and chocolate milk to drink.  I was in the need for some warmth, so I requested hot tea for my drink, which came with a large lemon slice and a mini hot water pot and two tea bags on a separate saucer.  For dinner, I tried their 'new' kale and roasted brussel sprouts salad (baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette).   I did substitute the goat cheese with feta, since that's my preference.   The food came out in a timely manner, was quite tasty, and we both cleared our plates.  Our waitress was ok, she did well taking our order, bringing out our drinks, and refilling my daughter's chocolate milk.  I don't think she ever introduced herself, which is what I'm accustomed to. She didn't ask about my tea, and didn't check on us much really.  She was helpful with updating my BJ's Rewards, and honoring my e-mail for a free mini pizooki. Her service wasn't bad per se, it just seemed all business versus adding a personable touch.  Who knows, maybe she was just trying to get through a rough day, and the best she could do was her job with a smile.   Many of the tables were filled and the tv's were displaying the NFL Network, baseball, and college basketball.  It wasn't too loud, and my girl and I were able to enjoy our conversation.  I like to come to BJ's with my girl or sometimes with friends to eat and hang out.  I would recommend it for casual dining and I'll be back the next time my sweet tooth craves those pizookies."
Jim B.,"Peyton, CO",90,175,620,4.0,7/3/2014,"This was our first time to Reno and to this restaurant.  We met local friends at the restaurant.   The service was very good.  The waitress was very forthcoming with her recommendations. Our friends, being regulars, ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls.  OMG - amazing! We all ordered something different and two of us tried two of their own brews.  The beers were great and we were all happy with our food. I ordered, on recommendation, the bone-in ""sirloin"".  It was very good. We had desserts as well.  We had the salted caramel crumble something or other with ice cream.  Yummy!"
Eric S.,"Boca Raton, FL",2,86,16,3.0,3/24/2017,"This a lively, fun place that has withstood the test of time as restaurants around it have come and gone as this shopping center has built up and grown. Though its part of a chain, BJs has a ""locals"" feel about it and if you come on the weekend be prepared to wait for a table. The food is dirt cheap and the atmosphere is ""steam punk"" gorgeous!!! The decor in here is as warm and friendly as the service which is top notch for this part of Reno! But the menu comes with a supplement entitled, ""Frozen Food For Dummies""... I always worry when I'm handed a menu the size of an instruction manual for modem routing industrial zones! You can have anything here from steaks to ribs to wings (bone in or out) and its all frozen. This place should be called BJ's Frozen Palace or BJ's Reheated Rotisserie... The only reason they don't dump half the menu and actually cook the remaining half is that this formula works very well for this area (cheap food, thawed and served quickly in a fun and festive environment). Who am I to judge? But if you want something better you're going to have to drive a long way away (like maybe Sacramento)."
Karen M.,"Clio, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/15/2017,"My husband and I brought 13 teenage students to BJ's last week for a rewards lunch. We had made a reservation, so we were not surprised that they had our large table set and ready for us when we arrived. Our server, Bryce/Brice, greeted us and gave several of the kids individual attention, talking directly to them about school and other things. After our drinks were delivered, Bryce took our order. Of course, we all ordered something different , from salmon to pizza, but it was all delivered within a relatively short time and no mistakes were made -everyone got exactly what they ordered. The food was plenty and very tasty. And because we needed to get the students back to the school by 3:30pm, the server put in our dessert order of pazoolas early (they take a while to bake) -halfway through our meal so there was no wait time in between, and we could meet our deadline. Our experience at BJ's couldn't have been better."
Patti B.,"Reno, NV",50,18,8,2.0,2/24/2017,"A few of us went to BJ's for dinner feb. 10th before seeing a movie. It was happy hour & I ordered a peach margarita. My pint glass was filled to the top with & & 2 large frozen peach slices were at the bottom of the glass. I literally had 5 slips from my straw & the glass was empty. We sat at a table in the bar & when I told my server he said he would bring it back to the bar. He brought me another drink, which was much better. When we got the check, I was charged for 2 drinks totally $17! I asked about the charge for the 2nd & he said he couldn't do anything & sorry. Horrible service & I definitely won't be going back for happy hour deals."
J K.,"New Washoe City, NV",7,3,,5.0,5/15/2017,"Great spot to hang out, love the Root-beer glazed ribs and wings! Ted and Kimberly are the best! If you have some time to kill before a movie or just out for lunch while shopping, stop in and say hi to Ted the bartender! Great drinks and great service!"
David H.,"Sun Prairie, WI",19,481,270,4.0,3/2/2016,I've been here several times for lunch and could come here every day! The menu and choice of food is increasable. The menu has to have more items than any other restaurant I've dinned at. My biggest complaint is that I find 3-6 things I want ti try each time. Service is usually decent and the food tastes great. I've only ever been here for lunch and can't judge it on dinner but I would expect its just as good.
