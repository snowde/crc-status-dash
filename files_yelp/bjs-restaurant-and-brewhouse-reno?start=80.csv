Chase H.,"Redwood City, CA",191,4,,4.0,12/8/2016,Mediterranean chicken pita is amazing! Highly recommend. Take-out is easy. It gets busy on the weekends so be sure to make a reservation
Jean L.,"Reno, NV",2,20,3,5.0,3/24/2017,"Always a favorite. Yes it is a chain, but there is a consistent standard in the food. We like to eat in the bar and avoid the wait of getting a table. Happy hour deals are great. They also have a to-go service where you can call your order in and it will be delivered to your car. They have special to-go parking places."
P C.,"Oakland, CA",5,15,16,4.0,3/23/2016,"Came in for dinner the other night. Had my usual the jambalaya. It was perfect cooked to perfection . Idk what it is about the Roseville Ca location. They need to take tips on service and food quality from this location.   4 stars because of the waiter was kinda all over the place, he missing a couple times."
Jennifer B.,"Reno, NV",611,159,1212,5.0,3/21/2015,"I've been here several times... I just gets better and better.... And this time!! Wow food, wine company!!! I am coming here again!!"
Paul G.,"Reno, NV",19,14,3,4.0,3/18/2016,"Typically don't have any issues with this location. They have a great crafted root beer, which I love.  Their burgers are always good. I love their thin French fries. And they have a new root beer BBQ sauce that I find quite tasty, and always get a side.  As always, we usually get a pazooki for dessert, one of the samplers is great. 3 smaller portions, perfect for sharing and allowing you to sample a variety of flavors.  It can get busy though, so I recommend using their app or calling ahead to get wait times."
Barbara L.,"Glendora, CA",9,3,,4.0,9/30/2016,Wait times are consistently long. Menu has changed and many old favorites are no longer offered. Beer menu continues to be extensive. Pizza is good and so are the burgers. Staff are efficient for the most part. Take out service is good and food is always hot.  Noise level is high.
F M.,"Reno, NV",0,11,4,4.0,9/22/2016,"Our family loves BJ""s! Good food, fun atmosphere. This is a friendly, fun restaurant. Very nice bar with very good, quality appetizers. Of course the beer is good too!"
Rachel S.,"Reno, NV",79,124,68,5.0,10/18/2015,"I still love BJ's. Both locations provide consistent quality food, great beer, and good, friendly service every time.  Tonight I had the Barbacoa chicken, which they served with the last beer dinner so I already knew it was good. This is a dish I would never have picked from the menu out of the blue. That Barbacoa chicken is fabulous, I highly recommend it. The honey sriracha Brussels sprouts are really good too.  We tried some seasonal stuff tonight too; the pumpkin ale and the pumpkin pizzookie. We were impressed by both, very good.  I remain a fan of BJ's foreverrrrr."
Alma F.,"Reno, NV",190,188,970,4.0,9/10/2015,"Came here today with my co-workers, to celebrate a co-worker's birthday.  His choice.  It seems like BJ's is an easy choice if you have a bunch of people who may have different ideas on what they want to eat at any given day.  BJ's offers a LOT of options ~ burgers, pizzas, salads, pastas, even a couple of Thai and Chinese choices thrown in the mix.  I've obviously been here before, and although the food is not horrible, they're not mind-blowing either.  But today, I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos.  It's one of their enLIGHTened items that supposedly have under 795 calories each.  Right. Anyways, this one was really, really good.  It came with a quinoa salad that was very flavorful.  The pita tacos were delicious.  The chicken filling reminded me of a greek salad and it was really well done.  Not too salty, nor bland.  Just goldilocks-right.  I'd order this again.  I withheld one star because as usual, service was slow."
Paul S.,"Reno, NV",1125,965,5321,5.0,4/10/2013,"April 5, 2013 Friday - dinner 6:00 PM 1 adult and a kid Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 5 stars!!! Background - My daughter loves this place so I took her hear for dinner.  I think is all about the dessert. Atmosphere - Much cleaner today from the last review I did.  Love all the huge TV's with the start of the baseball season they had three games going. Food   Appetizer - none order.   Main Course - I went with something different.  I had the California Chicken sandwich.  A chicken breast avocado slices between two buttery slices of toast.  The chicken was cooked well and not overdone, still very moist.  The slices of avocado where creamy, adding the right amount of flavor to the sandwich.      Dessert - My daughter skipped this, she actually wanted her left over birthday cake instead. Service - Excellent. But huge points for running my Oakley sunglasses back to me while I was going out the door. Future - Beer and food why not!"
S M.,"Reno, NV",3,5,,4.0,3/23/2017,"Went for lunch with a group of seven at 11:30. 5/6 tables occupied in the main restaurant.  Waited about 8+ minutes to get seated. Server came by to get drink orders. Promptly brought it back -all water, then took our order at 11:41am, completed at 11:44am, pretty quick for a party of seven. Sever brought condiments, could have refilled water, mine was empty. 11:54, restaurant about three quarter full.  11:58, two side salads arrived. Still no water.   12:02, server came to check on us, flagged him for water. Refilled  four of seven. 12:10 restaurant about capacity. Still no food. Oops.  12:11, two lunches came. Minute later, the rest came.  Yum, had the jambalaya, consistently good. 12:18 was checked if all was well. 12:23 finishing up and one birthday guy ordering his dessert. 12:32, check came.  12:38, picked up check.  12:44 Birthday desert with a candle came. 12:53 checks came back. Overall was a good lunch."
Heather C.,"Verdi, NV",181,124,708,5.0,11/4/2015,"That's much better!  We came in last night and sat at the bar for dinks and a salad before our movie.  Like always,the great service we're used to was there again! I don't know this bartenders name, but she had short brown hair.  She was great! I loved the new salad on the menu as well :)"
Althea L.,"Reno, NV",38,85,117,4.0,11/4/2015,Service was a little slow but food was amazing. Had the spicy pig and it was awesomazing! The thin cut fries with the jalapeno burger was also really good. Server was really friendly. Love the ambiance.
Mark S.,"Reno, NV",9,106,,3.0,5/23/2016,Had to down grade because of the food. Service is still great but they are now over salting their steaks and over cooking their seafood. My steak was like a salt block and the shrimp was almost mushy. This has happened the las few times we've gone so maybe it's a new chef. Whatever may be the reason I'm getting turned off.
Louis M.,"Reno, NV",96,227,369,2.0,7/1/2014,"Why haven't I written about BJ's before?  Can't really tell you why, but it was good before but not outstanding. So, unless something moves me to do so, I don't write about it. Unfortunately, something motivated me to write and it wasn't the food. First and foremost, the service was excellent..  The food, was fair to crappy. I'm disappointed in this place. On the table was a tent advertiser stating that we can call ahead and save time!  But, for the most part, when I dine, I don't want to rush in and out. I want to relax.  The dinner was a burger night. Meaning, I limit myself to one burger a month. I'm sorry PETA people, but I'm better now than I used to be.  We were seated after a short 5 minute wait. Which wasn't bad at all. The waitress came over and took our drink order. My dad got a diet soda and I got an ice tea. It arrived in short order (no pun intended) and our order was taken. The waitress was very happy and cheerful. Almost to a fault, but it was nice. The food finally came.... within a few minutes of ordering it. I would say that it wasn't even 5 minutes. Wow, that was just way too fast! It looked good. I tried a fry. It was nasty. The fries were luke cold. No really, they were only warm at best. They were soggy and just drooped. I think there's medication for that. That was my biggest disappointment.  My dad's fries were good. He ordered the wedge cut fries whereas I ordered the shoestring fries. For me, and my dad, the fries are as important as the burger.  When the waitress came by and asked how things were, I told her the fries were crappy (Yes, I actually said it that way). She asked if I wanted new fries and said yes. Less than 1 minute later, a plate of HOT fries appeared. I may be weird, but, if fries are to be served in a restaurant, shouldn't they always be served HOT and FRESH?  I was happier with this fries. Now, onto the burger. How can a place like BJ's serve me a fresh made burger in less than 5 minutes when they are at near 90% capacity? I put two and two together and realized that tent ad on the table to save time and the speed at which the food comes out meant one thing. They are trying to pump more customers into the restaurant.  Another thing. The hamburger prices are way too cheap. Most of the burgers were between $7.00 to $9.00. For a big place like BJ's? I bet you that their profitability is a teeny bit. But, if you can pump those consumers through, you can make it up. Of course there is the high margin products, such as their beer, which they are noted for and I didn't order.  So, why am I complaining about the speed at which the burger came out? Have you ever heard the phrase, haste makes waste? The burgers had to be sitting on the side. Pre-cooked. When the order would come in, the patty would get the necessary condiments and then out the door to the patron. GREASY!  Tasty, yes, but greasy. And, the fries too were greasy. Especially the sorry soggy droopy fries.  BJ's was a great place. I used to enjoy going there and the burger prices were the same 8 years ago. In fact, their prices should have gone up and kept the quality at the same level.  Instead, the prices have remained the same and the quality of the food has dropped.  -------------------------------------- Bottom line - Disappointing But, great service!!! Would I go back there? No.  Good service or not, when I go out for burger night, I want a good burger and good fries. It's only once per month, so it better be good!   I want to food prepared fresh so that it's served hot, and not greasy."
Frank S.,"Fair Haven, VT",0,121,24,3.0,7/15/2016,It's a pizza chain. How good can it be. Eatable substance.  Try some non chain local spot people. There are some great ones.
Dennis S.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,19,,5.0,2/27/2017,"Open late, vegan friendly, great bar, plenty of beer options. What else do you want? They have it all."
Adrienne B.,"Lakeshore, San Francisco, CA",135,15,7,5.0,12/18/2015,The customer service here is really good.  The staff is really making an effort to put the customer first.  Not really foodie food but it's nicely done with lots of choices on the menu!  Chad the manager is really working hard!
Kevin A.,"Reno, NV",223,32,37,4.0,10/20/2015,"We had a great dinner at BJ's Brew house. They do a great job for a chain brewery. Tomato & mozzarella salad, chicken tortilla soup, traditional Buffalo style chicken wings & an ice cold pale ale! They are good and consistent every time. Nothing over the top, but good. My only complaint was that our server was very presumptuous when checking back, saying things like ""isn't that great"" and "" are you guys loving everything"". The food was good, but I would like to decide what level of enjoyment I'm having, not have it thrown at me in a way I feel odd if I disagree. We do like this place and will be back!"
Darlene C.,"Reno, NV",1,24,14,5.0,7/5/2015,"They have the largest selection of beers I've ever seen. It's not crowded if you go at the end of lunch mid week. We were there to enjoy time, our waiter was helpful & didn't hurry us. I prefer dark/stout beer & they actually have options here. I enjoyed a dark Russian beer followed by Guinness stout. After drinking & eating it's an easy walk across the parking lot to see a movie."
