Ronald B.,"Twin Falls, ID",11,8,27,4.0,1/7/2018,"It's Saturday night and a birthday celebration for our party of 5. Our birthday girl chose BJ's Brewhouse Restaurant in Roseville. Still a good choice in our local franchise restaurants. Being a franchise ensures that the menu and service will stay consistent in this trendy restaurant. Tonight was no exception. Our reservations we're for 5 p.m. and we were seated promptly upon our arrival. Tonight's server was Nikki. She was friendly, professional, kept our drinks replenished, and give us plenty of time to make our menu selections. We took our time with the abundance of menu items. Also changing our minds on our selections. Not a problem for Nikki. Nicki never forgot us and correctly took care of everybody's requests. That's no easy task in my family. We spent 3 hours with dinner and conversation and never felt rushed to leave.  This evening we ordered 2 Classic ribeye dinners. You have your choice from a plethora of sides. They chose baked potato, asparagus, and honey Sriracha brussel sprouts. I highly recommend the brussel sprouts, sweet, spicy, and delicious. One order of double bone-in pork chop with mashed potatoes and asparagus. One order of Mediterranean Pita tacos and one of shrimp arugula Pita tacos.  The taco dishes come with unique side dish called seasonal Bistro grains. This tasty side dish is a combination of roasted sweet peppers, red onion, and corn. Then married with tasty spices, quinoa, farro, and black beans. We felt this dish was over salted. The Bistro grains is served cold, but I prefer to have it warmed. Which BJ's took care of for me.  Tonight for dessert, 3 orders of the always popular Pizookie.  This treat is your choice of cookie baked in a pie tin. Then topped with a scoop of ice cream. You can order this delight in full or mini sizes. Yum Tonight's pluses, service service service, cleanliness/consistency, steaks cooked to perfection, honey Sriracha brussel sprouts, Pizookie. Manager checked in on our table.  Tonight's minuses, over-salted seasonal Bistro grains, over roasted (limp) asparagus, tile floor near entrance, decaffeinated coffee that tastes like battery acid. No longer brew their own beers. BJ's is trendy, popular, crowded, and noisy. Having said that it's well maintained with clean bathrooms and we'll staffed. They have a full sized bar with a large assortment of beers. Although they no longer brew them at this location. Note of caution the tile floors at the entrance are extremely slippery. Yours truly nearly took a nose dive.  A note of journalistic transparency: I have two family members that happened to work at this restaurant. As always please like this review if it was helpful to you."
Margie M.,"Napa, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/22/2017,"Haven't been here in awhile. Very Disappointed, my meal came barely room temp. Steak was not warm , mashed potatoes were cool, steamed broccoli was cold.  Sad. Asked server to bring me steamed broccoli that was warm,  got the same thing again. Taking my food home to heat & eat.  The chicken tortilla soup was warm & tasty  so at least the starter was good."
Cute F.,"Sacramento, CA",3,152,8,2.0,12/19/2017,To say that their food is mediocre is very kind. I ordered two appetizers the lettuce wraps and the BJ's meatballs. The meatballs were good but the gravy was too sick and fully coagulated when it arrived to my table so the lukewarmness and the stiff gravy was not appealing. The lettuce wraps were good although the portion of chicken was too small compared to the amount of lettuce you received. At 11.25 was pretty steep for being less then a chicken breast full of meat.  My son ordered the prime rib sandwich and I ordered the root beer glazed ribs. Both were a disaster and painfully sweet especially the root beer ribs... and I don't know how Au jus could ever be sweet  but the shifts at BJ's achieved it! . The side dish for the root beer ribs was a nasty Sriracha coleslaw... it was not for human consumption. I felt really bad when I had to tell the server that we would not be coming back even though we had great service and she tried to get us to join the rewards program. There is nothing rewarding about going here and I don't want to endure this kind of food again. They need to take a field trip up to Chico to the Sierra Nevada brewery to find out how to do food.... and quite frankly they could get some beer pointers too.
C C.,"Roseville, CA",0,23,30,5.0,11/18/2017,"11-18-17 Sat @1:00pm We went to BJ's today ..We had a great lunch .. we tried out some beers, appetizer and dessert ...we been here before many times so today I am yelping !!! Great customer service like always and Joshua took care of us today ! He was friendly And helpful! Last weekend a family member had a birthday there on a Sunday with about 8  People to watch the game!! All had a good time ! We will be back.. A roseville fan! CC family"
Ash M.,"Rocklin, CA",2,144,63,4.0,1/5/2018,I love the happy hour specials and late operating hours. You can never go wrong with a pazookie to top off your meal!
Amritpal W.,"Riverside, CA",5,19,59,5.0,1/1/2018,We had guest over and the baby  wanted something gluten free. We got a pepperoni pizza and we could not tell the difference.
Doug G.,"Lincoln, CA",242,268,356,3.0,5/2/2017,"We decided to give BJ's in Roseville a try this past Sunday morning. My wife and I had plans that involved eating .. mid-afternoon .. so we were looking for a light, early lunch. Based on past experience with the Elk Grove location and others, we thought BJ's fit the bill. We even had a pretty good idea of what we wanted to order. The first thing I noticed upon entering the restaurant was how empty it was. On the same day of the week and hour of day, the Elk Grove and Folsom locations were generally already busy. You would find lots of people at tables and at the bar. We had plenty of seating choices in Roseville that day and we opted for a spot in the bar area at a comfortable table. I ordered a glass of wine (Estancia Cab), the Seared Ahi Salad and Chicken Tortilla soup. The service was really good. Our server was on top of things, no waiting - no mistakes. Friendly & professional.  The food was fine. My salad was ""good"" but I did not get as much Ahi Tuna as I am used to getting in this meal at a BJ's - not sure why. It was tasty and the rice wine vinaigrette and kick of wasabi again made this one of my favorites.  The soup was, ""good"" as well but I was surprised that the ingredients were not mixed in with the broth at our table. I guess I just missed the ""food prep production"" - obviously not a big deal and no impact on taste - just my attitude I guess."
Lynne B.,"Carmichael, CA",22,127,3,5.0,1/2/2018,"Awesome service by  Angie. Food was great, shrimp tacos were perfect husbands Cobb salad was perfect. BJ's delivers again!"
Darrell B.,"Newcastle, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/5/2018,I bought a 300.00 gift card there it was hacked into and emptied. BJ's would not respond to 2 requests for an answer or help resolving this issue.  Be careful if you are buying a gift card. They won't help if you have a problem. Darrell Boughman BJ's issued replacement gift cards.  Thank you BJ's
Amie A.,"Boise, ID",587,128,632,4.0,5/10/2017,"My friends and I just road tripped for 10 hours today from Boise to Sacramento. The whole ride over was filled with snacks from gas stations and LOTS of coffee. All that to say, we were elated to finally arrive and fill our tummies with a tasty meal. We arrived and were seated promptly. Our server was friendly and full of personality (her name was Kaitlyn)! She greeted our table quickly, took our drink orders, and upon dropping off our drink orders asked us if we had any questions about the menu. Their menu is MASSIVE, so I had like 5 things I was pondering. I asked her to help me choose between them and she recommended the Chicken Pita Tacos. I went with her suggestion, and I'm glad I did. They were light, but filling and the flavor was yummy! The price point was fair for the ammount of food that came with this dish ($8.75 for 2 tacos and wild rice salad on the side). I ate every last bite and didn't feel the least bit bad about it! After we all finished our dinner, we each ordered a pizookie! (It's a hot/melty cookie in a skillet served with ice cream on top.) You can't come to BJ's and not order one--these bad boys are the star of the show! We had a great experience and this meal was definitely a good conclusion to one long day of traveling!"
Alyssa S.,"Concord, CA",0,23,15,1.0,12/27/2017,"Sent back a margarita because their mix was undrinkable, they basically put it in a smaller glass and served it to me. Terrible service. Worst drinks."
Sarah M.,"Industrial Area West, Roseville, CA",68,10,,1.0,1/9/2018,"Horrible experience! Our food came barely warm after we were there for an hour. When we asked for new, hot food they brought back the same pizza but heated it in the microwave, gross! When I asked for a manager, he came over and argued over the time that we were there, which is a weird thing to argue over. Never apologized until we left.  Horrible customer service. Needless to say, I would not recommend this place."
Nathan B.,"Lincoln, CA",0,1,,3.0,12/9/2017,"This place is very hit and miss. Half of the times I've been there the waiters seem overworked and are tending too many people.  The beer and food is good, desserts are very good, however you will most likely be waiting a long time for a check up from your waiter.  Last time I was there I waited nearly 30 minutes after finishing my meal to get the bill!"
Sam B.,"San Francisco, CA",284,109,31,3.0,10/23/2017,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's Brewery and have had multiple experiences; however this wasn't the most pleasant.  When we arrived the host said there was plenty of room in the bar section to seat ourselves at a high top. We felt a little dumb doing two laps around the bar section to find zero empty seats. We decided to just wait for a booth.  When we got seated our waitress Casper (Yes, like the ghost) was a joy! She was so friendly and patient. She has one of the best personalities and attitudes I've seen on a waitress.  The main reason for my three stars is because of our food. We didn't order entrees, just the appetizer combo platter. When the appetizers arrived we were missing three of the foods. The random server plopped the food down and walked away with the most unpleasant look on her face. She didn't ask if we needed anything else. She didn't notice the missing items on the platter???? Also, we asked for the BBQ sauce on the side of the chicken, they were very similar to chicken nuggets. The avocado rolls were amazing though!  Casper came over right away and brought us the missing items. Thank you, Casper for making our night. It's always a better experience when the staff enjoys their jobs."
Cyn T.,"Roseville, CA",0,30,,2.0,12/12/2017,"Had dinner here last nite. 3/4 into our dinner, we were asked if we wanted dessert. Halfway in, we were asked if we wanted boxes. We still had several slices of pizza and half a bottle of wine, server was already cleaning up our table. WHATS THE RUSH????????? Can't we have a leisurely dinner?  Is it all about turnover????"
Karli D.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,340,768,1.0,6/8/2017,"Wow.  Quite disappointed I am having to write this review today.  But I just couldn't walk away not having said anything at all.  Therefore, I must explain my experience last night.  I absolutely enjoy the deep dish pizzas from BJ's restaurant and am not speaking on the quality or taste of the food, but rather on the customer service.  It was later in the evening, around 8:45-9 at night when I stopped in with a friend to grab a late dinner.  There was no one in line at the host stand but I proceeded to wait several minutes for the two hostesses (who were directly facing us and could clearly see we were there waiting) continued to have an entire conversation before helping us.  It was the rudest experience I've had at a restaurant in a long time.  The looks up and down from the two females was enough for me to turn around and walk out of the restaurant.  Clearly, my patronage was not wanted there and the fact that I couldn't even be acknowledged until two teenagers finished their conversation, while on the clock, is ridiculous.  I will never return here.  I will make sure to tell anyone to not enjoy a meal here due to the service.  And that is just the beginning.  Anyways, won't come back.  Wish I could give negative stars..."
Betsy M.,"Vail, AZ",71,456,525,1.0,6/25/2017,"We end up coming to this BJ's every time we travel in for a work meeting, and every time something negative happens -- someone's meal order gets dropped, they bring the wrong entree, they never come back for drink refills/orders... and this recent visit was no exception. I will start with, we will never return to this specific BJ's based on repeated poor experience. There were 2 of us.  We ordered ice waters (it was 109 outside), garlic knots and an appetizer sampler to share. That was it.  It took roughly 40 minutes to bring out.  This as we watched two other tables seated after us get their entree's.    But hey, that is okay because it is hot outside, so we hang in until some food runners deliver both the garlic knots and the appetizer sampler. Garlic Knots -- crispy on the outside, like stale crispy or sitting under a heat lamp too long.  These are rolls mind you, and not croutons. Appetizer Sampler -- the plate was super HOT, but the appetizer's not so much.  The buffalo boneless chicken nuggets were room temp, not even warm; the cheese sticks the same -- not even warm; the artichoke/spinach dip was warm at the bottom and cold on top; the avocado egg rolls were inedible.  The avocado was almost black, and I am guessing they were ready for awhile and were ruined from sitting under a heat lamp.   I am not sure what happened, or why it took 40 minutes to bring out cold food, room temp at best that you could tell had been ready for quite some time but the fact they are willing to serve food like that was more of the issue.  We ended up not eating it, besides sampling each thing (none of which were appetizing).  Management took it all off our bill, and we walked next door and got a nice piping hot Smashburger and shared some fries. The one star is the culmination of 4-5 visits gone wrong.  If I could give the server 5 stars by herself I would, she was attentive, kind, apologetic and totally not responsible for whatever was going on in the kitchen."
Tony S.,"North Highlands, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Horrible experience! I gave the waiter my i.d. so that she didn't have to ask, instead she said ""Can't use your big words?"" Referring to me as if I were a child. Later, she returned with our chips that were stale and admitted that was busy and forgot about our table. When I ordered my burger, it came very late and as I started to bite into it, I seemed to have hit something as hard as a rock. The bun was very very very hard. I tried to eat half the burger and stopped. When the waitress came by, she asked if I wanted a box. I said no, and she asked if I was sure. I told her that I did not want to finish the burger because it was as hard as a rock. I offered for her to touch it herself, and she did. She then proceeded to look irritated and asked me why I didn't say anything earlier, as she would have fixed it. I didn't say anything because it came out very late. At that point my table was very irritated and we wanted nothing more than to leave the restaurant.  If you don't believe me, then come and experience their horrible service for yourself. Save yourself a headache and some money. Do NOT come here. Roseville ought to offer better service and not treat their customers like an inconvenience. I literally could not wait to get out if this restaurant!!!"
Cynthia T.,"Davis, CA",63,185,260,2.0,11/25/2016,"TL;DR: superb service from Joshua C, not so great food for our entrees, but great dessert! will not be back unless I only want a pizookie.  I made the decision to come here to get some food to take a break from the craziness of black friday shopping at Roseville mall and thought it would be the best way to kill some time while I waited two hours for my necklace to finished getting cleaned at Tiffany's. Called ahead of time and the hostess said there was no wait. Great! We walked over right away from the mall and arrived shortly after 4pm. When we arrived, it looked pretty busy and we waited a couple of min to be seated. 5 stars for the service! Joshua C. was my server tonight and he was the second most amazing server I've had in my life. He was very super nice and dealt with issues we had in a very professional manner. The table behind us complained about their food twice and wanted to see the manager. Joshua was very apologetic and understanding and again was very professional. Did not give attitude at all! Unfortunately that's where the 5 star reviews end. The food was not very good. We did the Party for 2 deal. That comes with your choice of either a soup or salad, a medium sized tavern or deep dish pizza, and a full sized pizookie for dessert. We also ordered the salmon with quinoa dish. We went with clam chowder for the soup. When it arrived, it looked appetizing because they had a generous amount of clams in it! I took a sip and it was very very salty. I would say to the point where I would say it's inedible because I did not touch the soup again after that. But my boyfriend continued to go at it! Eventually he did stop after finishing about half of it.  Next up, we ordered the deep dish pizza: half great white and half bj's favorite. Again, upon arrival it looked good. The bf and I each picked up a slice and put it on our plate. Both our slices were very greasy on the bottom. Because it was so greasy, the bottom was very soggy. The weird thing was that it was only greasy for his half of the pizza (bj's favorite). My guess is that there were too many toppings. The bf brought it to the attention of our server and he offered to bring it back to the kitchen and have it in the oven for a little longer. But I said there was no need as the pizza was still edible. The third person at our table ordered the salmon with quinoa entree. I am not a fan of quinoa at all so I didn't take a bite to try it. He didn't like the quinoa but the salmon was cooked well. Thought it could've been glazed a little longer, but overall it was good. Finally, for dessert we got a salted caramel pizookie. I've never tried this flavor before but the other two at the table wanted to try it so I kept an open mind. Being a pizookie eating veteran, I must say this was cooked perfectly! When it's overcooked, it's very hard to get the cookie to come off of the pan. Definitely wasn't the case here. For those of you who have never tried the salted caramel pizookie, its a chocolate chip cookie with bits of caramel in it. They drizzle the cookie with caramel sauce and top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which is again drizzled with caramel sauce and also topped with mini chocolate chips. They were also very generous with the size of the scoop of vanilla ice cream. I probably won't be back to this location unless I only wanted a pizookie."
Angel F.,"Newcastle, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Definitely disappointed when I got here last night 12/15/2017 the girl at the front counter took a reservation n put me n my son under some random name which they had called numerous times before walking out to me to ask who I waz, got to my table ordered my food n appetizers people with bigger groups who came in well after me n my son did got they're food before us I got tiered littetally n my son also almost passed out on me, a little while after we see another group get served  i got up n we went to talk to the manager n told him what a shotty business hes. Running here n left. Overall this was a great place before, but now everybody looks hungover or over worked and under paid its not what it used to be Thats for sure"
Moz C.,"Sacramento, CA",21,64,24,1.0,7/3/2017,"Food is good! Accommodations of watress was nice! However, slow to removed our used dishes However, the bathroom: no ventilation, the spray bottle to freshen up bathroom is empty, paper towel on floor, soap dispenser has no head, 2nd dispenser is out!"
Josh L.,"Carmichael, CA",1,20,9,1.0,10/14/2017,Came in today for dinner around 430pm. Service was rushed but the restaurant didnt start to get busy until we were leaving.Worse part was my meal. Ordered the serloin a loaded patatoe and side salad total around 20$ alone just for my plate.Well I will be leaving a photo of the chared boot rubber I recieved. Patatoe lacked toppings As well. Salad was ok but nothing crazy.There is a reason this place has 3 stars as the price is very high for low quality food. server was nice but I left paying around 100$ for 3 people and that's with no alcohol.Cant recommend to familys or friends at this point very dissapointed.
Jami N.,"Roseville, CA",415,400,416,5.0,8/7/2017,I love coming here the food is so good and they have the Pazooki cookies on sale on Tuesday which are very good and well worth it I highly recommended trying it if you haven't
Paul G.,"Rocklin, CA",6,129,5,1.0,10/29/2017,"Terrible experience!  We were seated in about 5 minutes even though it was busy (although we had called ahead so I can't give them too much credit for that), but no server came by.  Finally, a server noticed us looking at each employee passing by and said that she didn't know who our server was but that she could help us.  She ended up being our server for the entire time, but treated us like we were more of a nuisance.  Our drinks were empty and we had to ask for refills.  She dropped off our bill just after we ordered desserts, and didn't even put it in a folio, simply the paper bill placed on the table like we were at Denny's.  She had another bill in her hands which was in a folio. On to the food.  The avocado egg rolls had a bitter taste to them, unlike the many times we had eaten them in the past.  Even doused in the dipping sauce, they were inedible.  The pizza, spicy Hawaiian Chicken, was bland and didn't contain any discernible applewood smoked bacon as stated in the menu description.  Even their famed Pazookie was a disappointment--the cookie was raw.  By this time my stomach was not feeling well at all.  We didn't even finish half of our food.  We all ended up having gastrointestinal issues.  Total waste of $60 and a few hours of our time.  We will never go back."
Frederick P.,"Roseville, CA",1079,133,380,4.0,7/16/2017,Went to BJ's for desert and had their famous Pizookie and of course it was good but the cookie was over cooked and the ice cream good but had been sitting on the cookie a little too long. 5 out of 5 if the cookie was not so over done.
John H.,"Roseville, CA",21,74,144,2.0,9/10/2017,"We have been to several other BJ's and have pleased with our food... But NOT at this BJ's... Our server John was great and very personal, but our food was terrible... My wife's quinoa bowl with shrimp was poorly presented and the shrimp was over cooked and was Luke warm and dry like it had been sitting out for some time... My baby back rips we're OK, but I wouldn't order again, my ""cooked"" carrots were so hard, (Not cooked) it appeared they were sliced and put in a cup... My creamed corn was down right awful, way Too much ginger... We won't be returning there anytime soon..."
Dima B.,"North Highlands, CA",26,3,,1.0,12/30/2017,"The wait time was 45 minutes on a pazookie Tuesday deal day. That's fine, I accepted the wait. We sat down it took about 15 minutes for someone to ask me what I wanted to drink. Drinks came about 10 minutes later I don't know if the lemon I asked for had to be picked off a tree in the back but it shouldn't take that long let's be honest. So I got my lemon water and ordered a deep dish pizza. I had to wait a whopping 35 minutes for a pizza which was clearly not deep dish considering it measured up to about 3/4 of an inch. The real kicker is that it was cold. How are you going to take your sweet time making my pizza which was not even deep dish but cost me about 17 dollars, and bring it out to me cold. Food was a joke. And for the stupid high prices you'd expect to get better pizza than a cold pizza from the grocery store that I can pop in the microwave and save about 3 hours and 17 dollars. Next time I'll stay home."
Brent J.,"Placerville, CA",29,85,22,2.0,10/18/2017,"I had a craving for the buffalo chicken pizza but was really stunned how expensive a personal pizza was. I honestly almost left when I saw it was $12.50. Add a soda and a tip and it was just under $20 for a 6"" pizza and a Coke. Sorry, but that's just ridiculous. Pizza was definitely good, but no pizza of that size should be more than $7 or $8 at best. Won't return."
Jacob B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",111,5,,1.0,10/21/2017,Our server was nice. Sure. Our food came out at all different times. We were a party of 14 and one of our party got there food 20 minutes after everyone else. And 2 of our party had the last of the food burnt and had to pick new dishes. I've been here a few times and never had this bad of service. Tonight was horrible get it together.
Shay S.,"Roseville, CA",0,7,1,5.0,11/20/2017,"Our server Allen was amazing! He was super nice, attentive, and always made sure we were good! BJ's should be very proud to have a great server like him! Great food and amazing service!"
Denny T.,"Sacramento, CA",187,612,403,2.0,12/5/2016,"Update from my prior reviews. It has been some time since I have patronized this location. It was definitely a contrast to my many experiences. After getting seated by the host and provided information on or server, we were seated for about 10 minutes before the server arrived. Server did not introduce herself, and wasn't sure if she was to cover the table. She proceeded to state she would get our beverage order started. We requested water which took five minutes or so. At this point we elected to order our food. Water was done while waiting on the food order and again waited for server to swing around. Our food order came out correctly and decently timed shortly after the water. Server rarely stopped by to check in on us. Food was hot and properly seasoned. No complaints on the food order which consisted of two soups, medium pizza and a pizookie.  We placed our order for pizookie when the pizza was delivered. Pizookie came out at a reasonable time because we didn't know how long our server was going to take.  Restaurant was clean and decently kept. Food was on point. Wait staff could use a little more attention. Perhaps one of the worst experiences or delays from service here.  We enjoy BJs but not sure we will be back anytime soon based on this visit."
Jen S.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,11,6,1.0,7/8/2017,"2 nights in a row waiting for take-out service!!!! Totally disgusted with the service here!!! You're better off dining in, you'll probably get your food faster!!   Last night (Fri.7/7), the family and I decided to order take-out from here, and our food wasn't ready at the scheduled time for pickup! We waited over a half an hour because they said the food wasn't ready!!! GGRRR!!! Tonight (Sat.7/8) thought the service wouldn't be as bad as last nite, maybe they're busy & understaffed but NO!!!! Arrived at 10:15 (again when the food was scheduled for pickup), and they lost part of the order!!! They said they cant find it & probably gave it away by accident!!! It is now 45mins later & i'm still waiting!!! STOP WITH THE EXCUSES!!!  Just admit you have shitty service & incompetent people working here!!! WONT BE EATING HERE ANYMORE!!! Worst BJ's Ever!!!!!"
Tessa D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,15,6,3.0,1/6/2017,In a snapshot: - long wait (45 min for dinner to table) - some food undercooked - portions given are smaller than those stated on the menu - waitress was nice - food tasted good (steak tasted better than most)
Vlad G.,"Sacramento, CA",17,11,11,5.0,4/26/2017,Ok place great food  Too laud in side Not a lot parking Friendly stuff and a lot of people
Ben R.,"Antelope, CA",20,20,,2.0,10/8/2017,"Roseville BJ's was a bit disappointing tonight. I can understand the twenty minutes wait to be seated but having to wait over an hour to receive our food is ridiculous. I understand on a Sunday night you're pretty busy but over an hour?!? And then when we got the food it was like it came from two different kitchens. The exact same meal was ordered, just different side dishes.  One steak came out perfect and the other was cooked unevenly. One order of green beans was perfect and the other order of green beans was like the bottom of the bowl or something, way too greasy, and over seasoned. The cous cous mac and cheese was pretty good but it was about half of the usual order. We will go back again but we'll stick with our favorite pork chops, which are always excellent. Along with the wonderful home brewed sodas. Mmm, orange cream soda!"
Tom T.,"Lincoln, CA",9,27,5,4.0,12/17/2017,"Great atmosphere, good restaurant, I can usually find something on the menu I want and enjoy appetizers are good. The bar is a full-service great bar not a quiet place which is not what I look for in a good restaurant. Recommended"
Stephanie D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",56,5,3,1.0,5/5/2017,"Let me preference by saying that BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants. However, this location is one that I will now avoid.  They weren't the busiest I've ever seen but the host and waitress we talked to sure acted like it. They seemed to not want to be bothered by us. The host gave away tables to 4 other walk in parties that came in after us before our party of 2 was seated. The waitress gave off an annoyed vibe, any questions we had she made us feel like we shouldn't ask. It felt like she just wanted us out of there. She never asked how we liked the food, never checked on us, and never got us refills. We had to ask a different waiter who was actually nice.  To top off everything, they got rid of one of my favorites, the sriracha chicken bacon mac n cheese pasta favorite. The BJs in Folsom still puts something similar together upon request but not this location.  I've never wanted to get out of a BJs restaurant faster and will not be returning to this one. I wish I remembered the names of the host and waitress but unfortunately I was too uncomfortable to ask our waitress her name again.   And hey, I get it, I get having a bad day or being stressed at work, I'm in the customer service industry too and it's rough some days. But you really have to just pull through and act to make other customers/clients comfortable and feel like they enjoyed what service they received. Why ruin someone else day just because you've had a bad one? Put a smile on at work and take your negativity home at the end of your shift."
Dan R.,"Reno, NV",66,40,17,2.0,5/27/2017,"Very disappointed in the quality of both the food and the service. We were at the Concord location 10 days ago and everything was fantastic. Today was poor in comparison. One of the items didn't have the items listed on the menu, all the food served was poor temperature and the wait time for the food was more than twice as long as any time we've been to any BJs location in the 3 different states where we've tried one. The restaurant was less than half-full so no excuse for the delays."
Jason D.,"Roseville, CA",0,7,2,2.0,11/4/2017,"Sloooww service. Didn't have a beer I wanted, then had to change a keg to get the next choice, and finally 30 + minutes by time I got my beer. Pizza was cold, then 30 more minutes to get a pazookie. This was lunch time so it even wasn't that busy."
Ashley M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",13,214,12,3.0,9/18/2017,"This was our first time coming to this location, we got seated right away but after that it took 15 minutes before anyone came by to see if we had been helped or had anyone gotten us drinks which we hadn't.  Was about to get up and leave when finally this young guy came over and asked us if we wanted to start off with any drinks, we got waters, 10 minutes later he came back with 2 waters and so we ordered an appetizer that came out quickly and was brought to us by someone in the back of the house, we were done by the time the waiter had come back by for us to order our food which were 2 burgers with fries he came by more frequently after our burgers arrived to see if we needed more fries since we got the endless fries, and then we finished off with a chocolate chunk poozkie, which very good.  It started off really bad with the lack of service and that sad part is it wasn't busy at all until we left.  But the service was a bit better by the end but that is why only 3 stars cause of what happened at the beginning of our experience.  The food was good and tasty and. That alone would get 4.5 stars. Service definitely could of been better 3."
