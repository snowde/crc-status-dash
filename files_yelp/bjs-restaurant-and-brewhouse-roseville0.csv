Selena P.,"Roseville, CA",270,2,,2.0,3/1/2016,The food is 5 stars but today i went in around 3pm and the women working the front seating counter was rude. Did not smile we had 3 adults and 2 newborns and she didnt offer to get us slings to hold the carseats in. Nor did she put us at a table that would work well for both carseats we ended up having to get up and move somewhere else and get our own slings for the carseats. She definitely needs to work on her customer service skills.
Eysonia N.,"Roseville, CA",51,1,,4.0,7/17/2016,"The service was great though the waiting took long. Worth it at the end! Food was delicious! We got a deep dish ziti, Alfredo pasta and a deep dish pizza. Portions were good for the pastas but the mini pizza was just that, mini. For an adult I would recommend a small if you are really looking to be filled. The mini pizzookie was great for a small bite after dinner between 3 people."
John E.,"Roseville, CA",25,24,51,5.0,7/3/2015,I don't know how one can give BJ's anything but five stars. Service is always superior and of a customer doesn't experience superior service a little intersection is warranted. We have yet to experience a less than excellent meal.
Bryon B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,11,3,5.0,1/9/2016,Love this place. Some times to busy. But try the house Root Beer and a Jerry Burst. Pizzas are thick and yummy.
Shirley H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/15/2016,Had the worst lunch in my life there today. It was rainy & cold.  Ordered clam chowder & bison burger. Soup was cold so sent it back. It came back barely warm. Burger was dry. No taste AND it was cold. Prices too high for such poor quality.
Haley C.,"Roseville, CA",2,36,,1.0,3/20/2016,"The customer service here is absolutely horrible. The last TWO times I've ordered food to go, it's taken over an hour to get my food when they said it would take 25-30 minutes. If it is going to take that long, don't tell your customers it'll only take half an hour. It just makes your customers unhappy and makes them wait at the restaurant for 30 minutes."
Natalie H.,"Sacramento, CA",230,15,,3.0,5/28/2016,"Last Wednesday night,  my husband two kids and i came here for dinner to celebrate my birthday.  Our server seemed to be extremely overwhelmed but very nice. We ordered an appetizer that did not arrive and our drinks were empty for quite awhile. A women named angeline i believe dropped our food off and noticed we had no silverware as well as no drinks.she quickly grabbed all of us refills as well as taking care of getting us utensils. She was apologetic and continued to check up on us even though we were not her guests. This was a disaster from the beginning and she turned it around and made it a better visit! This was great and i hope you all have more employees like her!"
Kayla N.,"Petaluma, CA",1,38,8,4.0,4/5/2016,"Can't remember our servers name but I came in last night with my sister and boyfriend. I never get desert, but my sister insisted the baked cookie was a must try. It was awesome. Awesome awesome awesome."
Mimi M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,24,2,4.0,9/2/2015,"Great beer. Extensive menu. Nice staff. Pleasant atmosphere. The skinny fries are superb. My only complaint is that it's hard to find anything that isn't overdosed with ""heat!"" (The spicy kind.)  I ordered the ""roasted Atlantic salmon with sautéed onions, mushrooms, fresh asparagus and fire-roasted red peppers served over quinoa and drizzled with soy ginger sauce."" Sounds healthy, right? In spite of seeing so many things on the menu with jalapeños, Sriracha or chipotle, I assumed the fire-roasted peppers would simply be grilled like the ones I get at Trader Joe's. But no - I couldn't eat it. The heat completely overpowered the food!  I asked to replace it with a chicken breast sandwich but my server (thank you!) shook her said and said, ""you won't like it. It's spicy too.) to be on the safe side, I ordered the potato skins appetizer. I've had it before. It's good. It's not the healthy dinner I was hoping for, though.  My advice to BJ's: Keep doing what you're doing, but provide better choices for those of us who are ""heat-challenged."""
Alex R.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,4.0,12/27/2016,I had a good time there but in summer some it spaces are hot and no air condition works there. That was the only downside.
Biff G.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,2,1.0,6/25/2017,Me and my wife for regular customers at BJ's for a long time probably spending 100 A week there and it has been a number of months since we've been there basically before the election we were there one evening and they happen to of had the debate on with the volume up it's a sports bar the only time I've ever seen the volume up if it's been the Super Bowl or a playoff game etc. anyway the volume was up doing the debate at the bar alcohol was involved of course so people are making comments it's no secret I am a diehard Trump fan well apparently the bartender working that night or young man late 20s I believe his name was Jared must've been a Hillary fan because ever since that night we would go in and he was working we were treated like crap it got to a point I had to address the manager the manager basically back to him 100% needless to say we have not step foot in BJ's again I went as far as filing a complaint with the corporate office they must be Hillary fans also I never got a response one
Brian B.,"Sacramento, CA",49,2,1,1.0,6/22/2016,"If they had minus stars this place would get them. 2 hrs for table on Wednesday night, 58 minutes for food. I use to do food service, places like famous nut tree, buckhorn, etc. I would have been appalled with such service to customers. Will never come back, and I highly recommend that you find a different restaurant."
Tiffany M.,"Roseville, CA",239,52,50,2.0,1/15/2015,"Good place for watching sports with the family. Nice big place that could accommodate large parties.  Pizza is similar to Pizza Hut, nothing special.  Wings are the run of the mill with bland boring sauces. Fries seemed as if they were under a heat lamp all day and very greasy. There is really nothing worst then old stale fries in my opinion, they are not that hard to prepare or cook to order so why even go there.  Dessert was a cookie I received for signing up on their email list, my server made the process feel painful.  Probably won't return unless there is a big game playing."
Mimi B.,"Irving, TX",1,20,8,2.0,11/8/2016,"We haven't been to BJS in awhile. It was nice to see the regular GM that we've seen for years. We were seated at about 6:50pm. We were able to take advantage of the beer Happy Hour.  Our favorite Southwest Spring rolls were discontinued due to illness on the East Coast???? We ordered 3 entrees and it took about 35 min to have our food served. Pizza was lukewarm. ...broccoli was missing from one  entree and when the dish was halfway eaten the dehydrated tasting broccoli appeared. We voiced our concerns to the waitress about the lukewarm food she asked we if we wanted to speak with manager. No apology. ...no apology when she dropped the broccoli off no apology when we asked for the check.  Although her customer service was as lukewarm as our food was, we tipped her more than 20% because we wanted to get out of there. Not coming back! Super bummed ....BJs was great backup/old faithful place to go when we didn't want to cook dinner."
Tim F.,"Roseville, CA",0,4,,3.0,11/24/2016,"I've eaten at this BJ's many times. The service is consistently slow. When I have ordered takeout, they usually screw up something on the order. I do like their menu and they have some good food. This location is just so busy that I don't think they focus on customer service since they are always so busy, because of their excellent location."
Sabra M.,"Rocklin, CA",7,84,3,1.0,10/16/2016,"We just had a birthday lunch at BJ's with a party of 9 and it was quite awful. First the hostess was just plain rude not sure if that's   how she acts all the time orwhat but damn, way to make people uncomfortable. We requested one of the large booths only to be told and clearly see 2 of the large party booths were ""out of order"" once seated we realized they were having multiple water leaks...yikes.  We had a super sweet waitress but it was pretty much a s*#! show to be honest. My drink order was wrong but totally not a big deal. We soon placed our order but had a super long wait, like this is getting weird long. I ordered a bowl of chili as it was pouring outside and it sounded perfect. The first time around I had a filthy slimy spoon and when they finally brought me a new one I got fat bite of cold chili....yum. By the time they finally brought me a second bowl it was luke warm but at least it wasn't cold and the rest of the party had already made a a huge dent in their meals I wasn't gonna say anything. Bedsides who wants to be ""that difficult person at table 12"" it sucks. Anyway, I swear the meat was bad or something as the chili itself had a rancid taste to it. I'm not going to lie I am seriously questioning the handling practices going on. Not too happy about the $93 check not including tip. We will likely pass...indefinitely on BJ's."
Michelle N.,"Orangevale, CA",62,53,41,1.0,1/11/2016,"Update: A BJ's representative responded to my original review and offered their assistance via email. I emailed back and never heard back again... Good job, BJ's. I don't appreciate the lack of follow through on your behalf with service in and outside the restaurant."
Christy B.,"Downey, CA",223,30,20,4.0,5/3/2016,"Shout out to Rob and Jamie! I had a girls night with 8 of my girlfriends tonight and they were awesome, attentive, and really helpful."
TheFlashingScotsman A.,"Bakersfield, CA",175,64,1,4.0,7/4/2015,"I've lived near one BJ's or another for years, but never went in. My bad. The food was all excellently designed, with just the right combinations of ingredients, and perfectly executed. The Avocado Egg Rolls were really good, and I would never have thought of that. Our server was excellent, very knowledgeable about the menu, very friendly, and kept our glasses full.  Oh yes, the iced tea. Crisp and clean, which means a lot to me these days, with so many places serving dirty tasting tea. Our burgers were quite tasty, with combinations of flavors that worked well together.  We had gone to BJ's with the idea of having dinner and setting up a new laptop using their WiFi, but the Wi-Fi was so slow we couldn't get the job done. But that's not really what I rate a restaurant. Good food, good service, I'm happy. We'll be back."
Taylor H.,"Roseville, CA",248,82,22,2.0,5/9/2015,"Haven't been to bj's in ages. Went last night with my best friend for a late night pizookie. Sat in the Bar area. Service took a while but it's the bar area.. It's what to expect. Pizookie was amazing and came out at a decent time. The waitress brittney I believe was ""nice."" But As a fellow restaurant industry worker, I would advise you to acknowledge that there are two people At the table dining in. I've never ever had an experience where I have completely felt invisible to my server. It was actually quite comical.. And my friend was asking if I noticed how weird it was. Yes, the most awkward and rude thing."
