Barbara P.,"Orangevale, CA",1,13,,5.0,5/10/2017,"you can actually make a reservation at the wonderful place. The entrance is kinda funny compared to where you park but the atmosphere is fun. Look up on their large black board and you can see interesting stuff about the brew. We had a large group of about 17 and the waitress was awesome getting us our drinks, food and checks. This was the easiest place to get our checks with the correct amount of people and a mistake was on one check but they easily fixed it. A few of us stayed at the bar for more brew and ice cream. This place has great variety of food from calamari and pizza, pork sandwich and appetizers to die for. My salmon was amazing. I noticed a variety of age groups, couples and they were even child friendly.  Dont wait to get your large group reservations in, they book up fast."
Edward C.,"Lincoln, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/9/2016,"Arrive at restaurant at 6:00 and didn't get served until 7:40. We actually had to cancel a party members meal because the meal took so long and she needed to leave. Spoke with the hostess because manager wasn't available and their response was ""Well, we're busy.""  No apology whatsoever!  Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences.  We will not return! Update: Manager finally came over and explained there was a glitch in the system and the order never got dropped. He was very apologetic. Could have alleviated if communication was better. Food was good but not almost 2 hour good."
E K.,"Loomis, CA",2,73,14,5.0,3/4/2017,Had a great Lunch with my mom.  Love those avocado egg rolls.  Jarad was very attentive and friendly made the whole experience more enjoyable.
Pinal P.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,5.0,4/28/2017,"My family has loved Bj's for years!!! But this time we had a wonderful experience! There was a long wait and my kids were getting hungry. So I talked to the manager about ordering in advance but they were not able to do that but they suggested that I order food for kids to go and then eat when the table is ready. But before we could decide what to order , the manager gave us a plate of some fruits and snack for the kids! The kids were so happy and saved us some tantrums :). I really liked the thoughtfulness of the manager! I love Bjs in general but this location is awesome !"
Ksusha P.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,23,9,4.0,4/28/2017,"I love bjs pizza. Pretty busy most of the times. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, good food. Parking lot far away:("
Salem M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",45,52,8,1.0,5/31/2016,"Very sad night coming here. My buddy and I came in to get some food after playing basketball. We waited ten minutes to be served and spoken to after seated which was strange to me. I ordered the rib eye, cooked medium which came out char burned well done. I told my server and he did the right thing by getting me a new one. Then...my new steak comes out completely bloody m.rare or maybe even rare, it was quickly obvious they rushed to bring this out. I appreciate trying to fix the problem, but it became worst. No manager nor anyone cared to speak to us about our time at BJs..a 45 min dinner turned into 1 1/2 due to slow service and poor back house cooking. It sucks that this happened because I realized the only thing BJs does a good job on making is the Parmesan crusted chicken, other than that my food doesn't turn out right.  I hope BJs gets this right so I can actually come here without problems..."
Avolyn F.,"Sacramento, CA",192,71,41,2.0,10/19/2015,"BJ's has become a regular place for me and my boyfriend to eat. It's reasonably priced with some good dishes that you can consistently rely on to taste just how you like them once you've found your favorites. I used to live near Arden and primarily frequented that location and then sometimes Folsom and Roseville as well as the one in Stockton. Almost every time it is a great experience. For some reason this location is the least consistent. Servers are hit or miss. The last couple of times they seemed like they would rather be elsewhere. The food is also hit or miss. Last night my boyfriends pasta that he orders every time we go here was bland, even I thought it was unusually bland because it was tolerable for me when normally it's too overpowering for me. (good news for me I guess but bad for him, he barely ate half). My pizza was pepperoni and mushroom but my mushrooms were added after the pizza had been baked. They were cold and raw almost as if they were forgotten until the server was about to take our food out to us. The prior visit we had to this location my chicken dish was burned, not just blackened but tasted completely burnt and I could not taste any other flavor than burnt. I am not one to complain about food at restaurants because usually I can manage and I just know what not to order next time but the server came around asking how things were and I just gave him the feedback that the cook may want to ease up on how he cooks the chicken dish. They then offered to take the dish off of my order which I told them was not necessary but I appreciated the gesture. Either way nice of them, but it was my last meal home before leaving for 2 weeks on a work trip, a bit of a disappointing last meal. I have gotten that dish at 2 other locations and loved it each time. The visit before that we had a coupon to use and it took us 3 times to get it applied to our receipt correctly. The manager got involved but seemed oddly defensive even though we weren't upset. Overall, might have to avoid this location in the future when I know I'll have a positive experience at the other locations. If you have had a bad experience here, try Folsom or Arden area they are great."
Jocelyn H.,"Antelope, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/29/2017,This is the 4th time with my experience with the same server Jaime but he has to be one of the worst servers I've ever had experience with in my life seems like he is miserable and his vibe is very negative other then that food is amazing
The-Reviewer T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,27,4,2.0,12/29/2016,"Merry B-Lated Christmas Yelpers. So today's stop was at the BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse located in the Galleria Area of Roseville. It was dinner time, and as I might say. it was a very packed house for a Wednesday. As we entered the establishment, the waiting lobby was quite crowded, we had spoke with the hostess of getting a table ready which we were greeted and given a wait time...... Wait time.... 45 min.- 1 hour ... Well we expected it be a long wait time given the busy day. So we decided to head out to the Bar area to grab some drinks , and well that area was too crowded. Luckily we found an opening at the bar so we ordered the brewery beer called the (Blonde) very light beer, close to I would say an ""Blue Moon"" very good and tasteful, Also it was happy hour on there appetizers so ordered some of there Calamari and A side of there Artichoke Dip & Chips, which I both recommend trying. But wait... what happened to our wait time for our table, so we decided to check up on the front desk on the status, how long should we wait til we got our table.... and Wow !! Big time they dropped the ball, they somehow lost our names and contacts .. and what made it worst, they told us, we had to wait another 2 hours. Big time failure in service hostess, no resolution, not even an apology. And what also I noticed, was that after we heard our names and contacts was not dotted down for a tables, other patrons were getting concerned, and I believe 1 or 2 others names were somehow missed. This was big failure for this establishment, The reason why I gave a 2 stars are the bartenders at the bar. The ambiance was very positive and including there service was on point, But as for the hostess at the front desk, I recommend some more training or yet worst , some extensive customer service, instead of talking to there co-workers about there day of shopping or on social media......Off to Dave & Busters....just got informed it's only a 5 min wait, and plus they've just informed me when I get there my table would be waiting...  Off to the next stop.... Be ready..... I could be YELPING !!!"
Jennie C.,"Roseville, CA",152,47,44,4.0,9/16/2015,Been to this location several times and the waiters are nice I especially like this hour because it is not too crowded it can get pretty busy during dinner hours and happy hour/ bar area can get packed.. Besides that it's a good time  The drinks are really delish although they can take a bit of time to come out they are really good and strong
Kathy B.,"North Highlands, CA",4,36,1,1.0,2/1/2017,"I made a call over a week ago for reservations for my 60th birthday. At that time, I was told reservations couldn't be made that far in advance. I wanted to make them for February 4, 2017. I was asked to call back a few days before and they'd be able to accommodate me. My daughter called today and was told they had no available spots. It was suggested she call other BJ's in the area which she did and it was the same situation. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed and won't be coming back to BJ's."
Rippal P.,"Antelope, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/12/2017,"Took to long, we waited an hour... our drinks were halfway done... and we saw workers on their phone.. it's daman btw"
Noor H.,"Roseville, CA",1,30,11,3.0,3/10/2017,"The food tastes good .. but the service is awful .. we've waited for so long time for our order and when I complained that to the manager, he simply ignored without even expressing apology!!"
Rob B.,"San Diego, CA",2275,147,272,5.0,9/17/2015,"Had incredible time and loved my calamari, bloody mary, cosmopolitan and cosmo light. The salmon that I had was delightful the portion size was huge!"
Ammar E.,"Sacramento, CA",2,11,3,5.0,8/7/2016,"My family like the place , The server Fred is so nice and professional. Downloading the BJs app is useful and my kids enjoyed the free pizookie."
Samantha O.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,23,2,5.0,11/3/2016,Allen was the best. He was attentive and suoer helpful my coworker and I. Next time in this area we will definitely stop in!
Shannon C.,"Folsom, CA",1,16,6,1.0,8/17/2017,"I love BJs and go to the Folsom one all the time but since my jobs are in Roseville I have tried this one about a dozen times now and every single time I am so disappointed. The food is absolute GARBAGE at this particular location. Every single time I have ordered any pizzookie it comes out burnt, dry, and not tasting like what I'm used to. I always order the same pizza with extra pepperoni and I pay 3$ for about 1/2 the normal amount of pepperoni!!! The few times I have even tried the TOGO was worse actually. It's not one Togo person helping me it's more than 2 and then I never get a napkin or utensils with my Togo I guess they assume I'm gonna eat it with my hands right? Then when I take it home and open it up in disappointed at the poorly cooked and incorrect food. I will give one star for the excellent server who has served me on 3 occasions there I do not know his name but service was amazing too bad it can't make up for the horrible food. Please retrain your cooks..coming from some who is a line cook.. the food is unacceptable to serve"
Danny G.,"Roseville, CA",319,98,789,4.0,12/31/2016,"this is an great dependable place. you can make reservations and count on the food being petty consistent. I have visited this place multiple times now. and this last visit I decided to try something a little bit different. I tried their Pizza I had pepperoni sausage placed on the pizza. I would say their toppings leave a lot more to be desired, very skimpy on the sausage. however our waitress was excellent she noticed it looked a little thin she asked if I'd like some more she went back brought me plenty! to me this is part of their consistency their service and their food you can really depend upon!"
Camilo R.,"Chico, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/21/2017,I would definitely say this is one of my all time favorite restaurants. They were more than understanding and Elizabeth was a great help! I was very grateful to have her as a waitress! The hospitality was superb.
Mare H.,"Roseville, CA",0,16,,5.0,9/19/2016,"Thank you Shawn ,for reaching out to me to let me know that my experience was not acceptable by any means. I hope it helps fix the challenges that sometimes arise.We'll for sure give BJs another try ! Thanks again for listening!"
