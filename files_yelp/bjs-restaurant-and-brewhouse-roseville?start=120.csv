Francine B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",131,228,338,1.0,4/22/2016,"I called at 3:30 pm to get a reservation for 16 and they told me reservations were booked up but I could show up early and reserve a table. I wondered why if I could get a table by coming early they couldn't just put my name in the early check in list since the wait would be an hour and a half wait? She said that is only for parties under 7 and someone would physically have to be there. Ok fine- A person arrived at 4:30. When we all arrived at 6, we were told it would be another hour at least. We left. I realize 16 is a large party but why would you not try and accommodate me by letting me at least do the early check in? Instead my mother in law wasted an hour and a half of her time. Not the best customer service."
Beth L.,"Rocklin, CA",6,124,,2.0,8/1/2016,"Pros: they deliver  Cons: usually food is late, cold or wrong I have ordered from here about 5 times. Didn't feel the need to review until this last order.  One out of the five times food was okay at best, the other four times left something to be desired.  I would only order if no other options are out there."
Brian A.,"Sacramento, CA",12,174,,2.0,2/11/2017,Late work meeting and I stopped by BJ's to have dinner and a beer and watch the Kings game. It took them over 30 mins to try to find the game on their dish network and I just left. Really? Its a Fri night and the Kings are playing and you don't have that preplanned and you cant the station. So glad I didn't waste my money on this place. I know why I don't visit this place.
Sean R.,"Newcastle, CA",0,7,1,3.0,3/4/2017,Food is good! One recommendation for BJ'S staff is to have eating utensils ready on the tables for the customers. Waiters need to be conscious of this so the customer doesn't have to struggle to remind them. Also make sure there is toilet paper in the bathrooms.
Stella K.,"Rocklin, CA",13,325,508,5.0,6/23/2016,"Haven't been to this location in years.....primarily because there is ALWAYS a wait. However, my friend insisted on dining at BJ's because he wanted a Pizookie! We met at the restaurant at 7:00 pm on a Tuesday night and what do you know....it was packed with a wait. It took about 30 minutes to get a table for three. We ordered a large BJ's Classic Pizza. It was good and had a decent amount of toppings. The waitress was a ray of sunshine....she was upbeat, personable, and made our dining experience SPECTACULAR. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name, but I am going to try to go back to the restaurant to get it. The Pizookie cookies were the highlight of the evening. We ordered three because one flavor was sufficient The Pizookies all tasted AMAZING! Thanks for the great service brown haired waitress! Whoever you are!"
Ann H.,"Grass Valley, CA",14,9,1,5.0,7/19/2017,I came here ready to chow down. Our server rich was extremely helpful and nice. I had the lemon garlic chicken-delish!

Jennifer M.,"Sacramento, CA",195,46,35,1.0,3/21/2016,"Came here for dinner with a group of friends.  I had actually been there 3 nights earlier and my experience was nothing like this one. Everyone at the table ordered a meal and added either a salad or soup.  Salad and soup arrived as ordered.  Prior to the meal arriving, the waiter who initially took the order came over stating our waiter would change and introduced the new waiter. Shortly thereafter, the meal arrived, but not by either waiter.  I was asked if I had received my meal, which happened to be a salad (not a side-salad) and a indicated I had not. From that point on the waiter, nor the server who brought the food returned.  Nealy 25 minutes passed and the waiter finally returned asking if there was anything else he could get us.  I mention to him that I never received my meal, but at this point I didn't want it.  He kept insisting he could bring it to me in a to-go box.  I explained to him that I came to dinner with the company of my friends to enjoy a meal TOGETHER, not me watch them eat and I eat my salad later at home.   His resolve to the problem was to take just the salad off of the bill, which wasn't a resolution.  I responded that I wouldn't be paying for something I never received.  He then, with an attitude said ""well what do you want me to do?"" As if none of this was his fault. I told him to go get his manager.  After waiting another 15 minutes the manager arrived, again insisting to just give m the food in a to-go box.  Again I declined.  By now I am so annoyed and frustrated, I don't want your food.   He questioned who brought us our food. I refused to tell him, because it wasn't their fault.  His kitchen didn't make the food and his waiter never checked on us.  He then stated he would take the salad off of the bill.  Not once was I offered anything for my inconvenience. I shouldn't have paid a thing for my bowl of soup and drink.  Poor service, lazy waiters and horrible management. I travel and eat out very often.  I have never had my food not arrive.  I have had the wrong meal, overcooked food and cold food, but never this. I will NEVER return to this location."
Bryan L.,"Roseville, CA",5,281,,1.0,3/17/2016,"I highly recommend against ordering any food to-go from this BJs because literally every time I've ordered something to-go that wasn't a pizza, they either screwed up my order, charged me the wrong amount, or both. In today's instance I ordered (online) a burger, fries, and a salad. A salad came with the burger but I wanted a different one so I substituted it with fries. When I picked up my food they gave me the salad, the wrong burger, and no fries. I called the person who gave me my food back over and told them of the error but instead of trying to fix it they just spouted off excuses about what happened. The burger was just buns, a patty, a slice of onion, and sauce. I've gotten this burger before and there was a whole bunch of other stuff on it so when I asked why this didn't have any of that on it, the person said the ticket indicated that I requested no greens on my burger. The sticker on the box said ""no mixed green salad"". I told them that was referring to the salad I switched out for the fries and they gave this idiotic response saying ""well they must have interpreted it as you didn't want any greens on your burger"". I think the cooks are dyslexic or just really incompetent for getting such a simple instruction completely wrong and believing it to mean ""take half the stuff off the burger"". I still didn't have the fries so they said it was going to be a few more minutes since they had to cook more. After that they went over and started chatting with the hostesses who were also not doing their jobs because they seemed to ignore everyone who came in the to-go door and didn't even bother to go find someone to help them (and me when I first walked in). At no point during this ordeal did they offer to take my food back and have it redone and I wasn't going to ask because at this point I was fed up with the shitty service and the ""take it or leave it"" attitude of the person I was dealing with and I just wanted to get home. Maybe I was foolish to believe that BJs couldn't possibly screw up my order every time I ordered something from here which is why I kept coming back but I guess I was wrong.  Be warned: they apparently don't give a crap about you unless you dine-in and I'm not the only one who has issues with the to-go orders; many other people have left similar reviews."
Steve R.,"Rocklin, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/26/2017,"I suggested BJ's to colleagues to meet and have lunch on July 26, 2017 because of their atmosphere and varying menu. Just before our meal was served I excused myself to use the restroom. On my way toward the restroom I clearly observed a hostess drop utensils wrapped in their cloth napkin on the floor. The utensils came out of the napkin onto the floor and the hostess quickly scooped up the napkin and utensils and placed them on the stack of menus in front of a server who was standing there. The male server then re-wrapped the utensils and put them in a ready position for the next seating of customers. I informed the manager and she apologized. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO BJ's. People are disgusting and don't care about health."
Rabekka C.,"Campbell, CA",113,9,1,3.0,12/16/2016,"I am giving you guys three stars, however I am giving Molly the wonderful Bartender 5 stars. All of our food took a very long time due to the kitchen being backed up. But she worked her ass off to keep us happy. I  am very thankful for her and her amazing service. Maybe you guys should consider hiring more help for the kitchen on weekends and peek hours."
Carson C.,"Granite Bay, CA",371,375,37,2.0,10/27/2016,"I would say subpar at best. I was visiting a family member's house in Granite Bay, and we were trying to decide where to go for dinner. BJ's sounded good, so we decided to head over to the Roseville location. We arrived about 7 PM on a Tuesday night. It looked busy as usual, but the wait time was not that bad... probably about 10 minutes. We were a party of 6, and got seated at a table that was pretty small for 6 people, and squished between two booths. The table was so wobbly that we had to actually keep putting our beverage napkins under the legs of the table...otherwise we would have undoubtedly spilled the beverages - it was that bad.  Our waiter was nice enough... he took our drink orders promptly. We then ordered our food and waited for about 35 minutes for it to come. Some other waitress came by and delivered one plate of food. We thought she was coming back with the rest, but we were incorrect. Another five minutes went by, and one more plate of food came. Now, out of the six of us, two of us had food. Again, we waited about another 3 to 5 minutes...finally, everyone had their food.  When the food arrived, I reminded the waiter about my house salad, and he said ""oh it never came?"" I told him that it had not come, and to just forget about it and take it off the bill. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos - they had a pretty good flavor, but when I ordered it, I had asked for new onions... there were a few onions on them, but I was so hungry I just didn't care anymore.  They were pretty good, but unfortunately the pita bread rips as you try to pick it up, so you end up eating the tacos with a fork.  Overall, I was pretty unimpressed. I hope they can become a little more organized for the patrons, but I most likely will not be returning. Carson C.  El Dorado Hills, CA"
Lauryn E.,"Roseville, CA",0,29,,4.0,7/20/2017,This branch of BJs was awesome. We went at lunch time and tried for the first time their lunch menu. I must say that the lunch menu is extensive and decently priced. The restaurant was packed but the service was still really quick and our server was very friendly.
Ema M.,"Carmichael, CA",34,29,57,4.0,5/12/2016,Pretty good spot. Parking is a bit crowded depending on what day or time. But their menu is pretty diverse which is nice.
Monica M.,"Roseville, CA",6,12,12,3.0,12/20/2016,"Gotta say bjs restaurant has gone down since I worked there it was such great food that's why I order for delivery,didn't think my food would be cold when I got it paid 68.00. I was not happy at all but was too hungry waited 2 hrs since the delivery driver didn't get there until 5...."
Berta S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",5,9,,2.0,12/1/2016,"Food is great, service is good, food is overpriced. Today I went there with a group of 60 people. I ordered an appetizer and a water nothing else. It took 40 minutes to get my appetizer. When other people were getting their meals I was getting my appetizer. I got my food at the same time that the people who came 20 minutes after me got their food. I am very irritated. And very annoyed. I got there at 8:45 and I left at 10:30. Not by choice, but because I had to wait so long for my food. This is not One of my choice restaurants. The only way I'm going back to this restaurant in the future is if someone very close to me is going here and it's very important to them. Otherwise I'm going to avoid this place."
Nick P.,"Elk Grove, CA",27,15,6,2.0,3/23/2016,"Let me preface this horror story with the fact that both the server (Yanni) and manager (Amy) were great.  Here goes... So my wife and I decided to treat my dad and mom to dinner.  We decided on BJs as our place to go.  When we first arrived, the wait was minimal; only 15-20 minutes to be seated.   Once we were seated, we waited a few for our server to show up; nothing too terrible, but not on-the-spot either as it was a busy night.  Once he showed up, we ordered our drinks as well as an appetizer and off he went.  This is where things started to go downhill.  He comes back with our drinks and takes our order:  Two steak dinners, a pasta/chicken dish and a personal pizza.  With that, he was off again.   My wife's soup came out first which we assumed was coming with the meal...  well before the appetizer.  After about 20 minutes we got a hold of him again and asked where our appetizer was.  He apologized profusely and explained that the kitchen was running behind and that he'd check to see where it was.  After about a total wait of 30 minutes, our appetizer arrives.  It's hot and delicious and we are ravenous at this point so it's devoured pretty quickly. So we continue to wait, and wait, and wait for our main dishes to be served with no avail.  After about 50 minutes I finally ask our server what's up with our meals.  He again apologizes for the wait and offers to refill our chips in the mean time.  We continue to wait for our entrees and our chips at this point.   After about 65 minutes our entrees come out.  My steak is cool and well done when I had asked for medium, and my father's steaks is cool, the asparagus is undercooked, and my dad's baked potato is cold and hard.  My mother's pasta dish and my wife's pizza are fine however.  At this point, I complain to our server explaining that the long wait and the condition of our food is uncalled for.  He says that he understands and that he'd get the manager. I talk to the manager and she acknowledges that there's no reason for this and that she would take care of our meal.   So all-in-all the food was terrible, the wait was terrible, but the staff was great working with what they have.  Which was the only thing saving this review from being a 1 star.  I wouldn't recommend going here until they work their kitchen out unless you like terrible food, and long waits with a smile."
Amber W.,"Antelope, CA",109,51,16,1.0,7/9/2017,I went in for my birthday dinner with my son and it went even a weekend holiday and it was packed and we were seated and I ordered and took so long and so after about thirty min I let the guy know I should have ordered to go and asked for it to be packed to go and of course no silverware and missing part of my sons food order which he brought 5 min later and was so cold. We didn't even eat until we got home to antelope and the food tasted awful the staff looked so stressed overworked and not enough staff to work when it's so busy like that and I only tipped for the simple reason he gave my son ice cream but other than that no smile or thank you or apology for it being so busy and the guy also gave me attitude when I wanted to use my $5 coupon off my app and said it will take longer since his manager is working the line and so on so I waited even longer. I hope someone attends to customers reviews and I will be calling to speak to someone about my experience.
P C.,"Oakland, CA",5,15,16,1.0,3/15/2016,"I ordered a takeout order of jambalaya. It was very bland and there was no sausage. I drove all the way back, and tell the takeout waiter what the problem was. He says ok, let me fix it. He brings it back still bland looking with NO sausage. If you're a chef how do forget the list of ingredients right in front of you. Not once but twice. The waiter offers me a complimentary drink for the inconvenience. I take it. He brings the food back with sausage and my free pizookie.  Mind you 2 hours go by from the time I originally ordered the to the time I go back to bjs to get it fixed. 20 mins before closing. The food was prepared wrong from the beginning. When I took the food back he didn't once attempt to make me a new dish. The same food was tossed again, and again. I end up giving the food to my roommate, and I made myself a sandwich.  I will NEVER go to THAT BJs again."
