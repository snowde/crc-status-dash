Jasmine P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,7,5.0,11/6/2016,"Went there on a Saturday night with a party of 4. Every other place in Roseville had a wait time of an hour plus. Understandable, it's Saturday night. Called BJ' s for a table with a 30 minute wait. We went there 5 minutes after my call and they had the table ready that second. We were so pleased! The waitress, Casper, was wonderful. The staff here are all so polite and I can tell work extremely hard. Unfortunalty,  there was a huge wait for our food, even the manager noticed as he walked by it's been way too long of a wait. He was very professional, he apologized as we were very disappointed with the long wait time, and even took some items off of our bill. Thank you Joe!!! I'm giving 5 stars for the food, the service, and the management ! Ill drive the 25 minutes from home for a night out here anytime."
Lina L.,"Davis, CA",62,102,191,3.0,6/7/2015,"In the land of the chain restaurants, decided to go to BJs because we were craving their chicken tortilla soup. I adore this soup and paired it with a simple beet and arugula salad. The salad Wasn't bad but there were several yellow leaves which they really should have picked out. Unfortunately the balance was off as both the dressing and the dried cranberries were too sweet. I probably would ask for the cranberries to be left out next time and ask for half the dressing. Also ordered two of their new shareable items - the brussel sprouts and the carnitas fries. I absolutely did not care for the former dish. The brussel sprouts which were over fried and greasy. The carnitas fries, on the other hand, were delicious. Then cheese could have been melted more but other than that that dish was very good.   Service was excellent despite the large groups. I would return again and order the soup and the carnitas fries."
B.J. D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",123,18,16,5.0,9/23/2016,"always a good time and I love the setting... of course it's busy during peak hours, but you must expect that with any restaurant and especially one that focuses on quantity. BJ's still delivers great food and a great diverse menu.. plus those Pazookis !!!"
B.J. K.,"Davis, CA",26,45,,5.0,12/13/2016,"Customer service was fantastic, server was great, food was fresh, hot and tasted good.  We were there for lunch and did not feel rushed at any time."
Josh K.,"Roseville, CA",0,42,,5.0,12/11/2016,"Great pizza, great burgers, great beer. Need I say more? Some of the beer pairings are spot on. My favorite is the ""Jeremiah Red"" with the ""Nutty Brewnette"" pulling a close second. The ""BJ's Favorite"" pizza is quite possibly my favorite pizza of all time. Typically a bit of a wait to be seated anytime around dinner hours, but I can almost guarantee you will enjoy it thoroughly. Bar is open seating and quicker; if you're dining alone."
Alecia V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2016,"I'm a little late in writing this review, but it must be done. I came in here with my family on a Friday night at 11pm. There were eight of us in total. We arrived happy to see the place was empty- as we were all famished. But to our surprise we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. Oh?? Really... hmmm okay. So I'm over here assuming it would end up being a mere 10 minutes max. Nope. Thirty minutes goes by... REMEMBER THIS PLACE IS PRACTICALLY EMPTY. As if things couldn't get any worse, we then see a bunch of hosts and servers at the front stand chatting away- all while there are a bunch of dirty tables that needed cleaning. I was very upset at this point and wanted to talk to a manager but there were no managers in site and I didn't want to ask the already unhelpful host.  A total of forty minutes pass and a manager comes out from the back and asks my sister how long we've been waiting and then apologizes; seeing how empty the restaurant was and knowing it should have NEVER taken that long to be seated. We finally get seated and at this time it's about midnight and it still takes our server TEN MINUTES to greet us and take our drink orders. LIKE REALLY? Not to mention it took our food an additional THIRTY MINUTES to come out. We were the only guests in the restaurant waiting for food mind you. Once our food arrives the server decides to place our bill on the table, not asking us if we needed anything else. Like really? Did we not JUST get our food? So rude. After my experience here I realized why it was so empty on a Friday night. You will never see that at the Elk Grove location. Probably because the service is much better. Needless to say, this restaurant needs a massive amount of polishing; perhaps new servers and new managers since I'm guessing management isn't doing their job since the servers aren't. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from here. I sure will."
Vadim R.,"San Mateo, CA",6,48,7,2.0,7/10/2016,"Love our BJ's in Foster City, but had to stop for dinner on the way back from Tahoe. This one has a horrible service. Ordered food. No bread. Asked for it. Got bread and butter. No utensils, no plates. Asked... Got utensils, had to eat on napkins. The food took forever. And we had to ask three times for a glass of wine. Hope not to come here anymore unless I really have to."
Claudia T.,"Fairfax, CA",30,158,9,3.0,5/15/2015,"Compared to the portion sizes at the BJ's in San Rafael, the Roseville BJ's has the smallest portions ever. Same price as all the other BJ's, but way smaller portions. My husband and I were in town and noticed that Roseville is the capital of all chain restaurants. We popped into BJ's since we usually have a decent food experience even if the adult beverages are weak. We learned to go with straight alcohol on the rocks so that we can save BJ's from embarrassing themselves in the adult beverage department.  Service was great even on a crowded Friday night.  Overall not a bad experience but a chain restaurant might want to keep the portions equal in all the restaurants, otherwise lower the prices.  My one major complaint is that it is always so dark in BJ's. It would be nice to be have enough light to read my menu."
Cynthia C.,"Sacramento, CA",199,223,1182,3.0,5/13/2015,"Called ahead for a table and was seated right away.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls and they great, but a little spicy.  Also, had the turkey club with a cup of broccoli cheddar.  It took a while for the food to come out, but it was a busy day.  The best part was the pizookie trio.  I would go there just for this alone."
Kurt K.,"Roseville, CA",4,128,32,1.0,1/27/2016,"The girl who took my order at the take-out register, Alyssa H, was flirting with some guy and I was made to feel that taking my order was an interruption of their flirting. I asked if it was OK for her to take my order and the guy  said, ""I guess I can move aside"".  During my order Alyssa seemed very distracted and impatient and both continued to give me dirty looks. They've been flirting for at least 15 minutes while I've been here and he was here before me. I think even a manager walked up there to ask her to climb up some where. It doesn't matter how good your food is, it's never OK to be rude to a customer. As I was waiting for my food, I noticed an advertisement on the front door for $8 movie tickets. Three different employees inside had no idea what it was. The bartender told me that she had no idea because she never came in the front door. I was told that my food would be ready in 15 minutes but it was more like 30. My  food was ready and I bought two of the $8 movie tickets but as I was leaving I noticed that I didn't have the two sides of ranch and a side of mayonnaise. When I got to my wife's work I noticed that her hamburger wasn't made correctly. I must have said three times that her hamburger was to have only cheese, bacon, and mayonnaise. It only had cheese on it. I also noticed that we didn't any eating utensils or napkins.  Maybe if Alyssa wasn't too busy flirting maybe my order might have been correct."
Jenni T.,"Roseville, CA",346,970,7114,3.0,12/10/2013,"As far as chain restaurants go, BJs is right in there towards the top. If comparing it to anything local, it's comfortably in the bottom half. I have tried quite a few things here and everything that I have had has been good, I have never hated anything or been disappointed, but it's just nothing super special. For Vegetarians, I have had the Fettuccine Alfredo which was good and so was the bread it came with. The Veggie Burger is good too, especially with fries and on sliced sourdough. The Giant Pretzel was good as well, especially for Happy Hour! The Sour Cream and Chive Baked Potato is good. And lastly, the Deep Dish Pizza was good, probably the item that I order the most. Notice how I said everything was ""good"". Nothing bad, yet nothing outstanding.  They are always busy, but the restaurant is huge so there is never much of a wait (if at all) and the service is always top notch. It's nice to sit in the bar for Happy Hour to watch the game because they have a bunch of comfortable seats and a few big TVs. Unfortunately the drink prices ad appetizers aren't discounted too much, so your tab will still be pretty pricey. I would recommend going here if you have a large party or need somewhere to bring your out of town family if in Roseville. Wouldn't drive just to go here though. They have a large menu and there is always something for everyone!"
N W.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2017,Have had good food and Service at other locations but I am sad to say that this location was a disappointment. 1 hour 45 minutes to get food and check. Food was cold on arrival and under cooked. They need to start making changes soon or else it will be a ghost town and boarded up windows.
Stephanie N.,"Roseville, CA",6,17,43,1.0,4/8/2017,"My family came here tonight to celebrate BOTH my mom's and dad's birthdays. Long story short...They didn't give us utensils when we sat down with our appetizers in front of us. Had to ask. Took a while so we had to ask another gentleman. Then our entrees came out and my dad ordered clam chowder and they didn't bring a spoon so he had to get up and walk himself to find a waiter/waitress to ask for a spoon to eat his soup. It was alright food and the service was unpleasant. I usually love coming to BJ's but tonight was horrible. My family and I laughed it off but we agreed to never come here again for a family dinner. The clam chowders were way too salty... the ahi appetizer was very bland... the calamari was cold and not crunchy... my shrimp and asparagus penne pasta was not well made. The sauce was good but it wasn't complimenting the penne... my boyfriend ordered some entree with salmon and quinoa and he thought it was alright...They took forever to bring out the complimentary Pzookies and we were just like forget it ...we were so tired of finding one waitress to help us figure out what's going on my dad and mom didn't even want the pzookies anymore for their birthday. He figured since we bought a traditional Coldstone cake at home let's just ask for the bill. It was just a bad night and although they were busy, it's still no excuse to have bad service especially when we were celebrating two birthdays for two special people."
April F.,"Elk Grove, CA",30,5,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Worst service. Enough so that I honestly told the manager that I would not pay for our food. It took 40 min to get a kid mac and cheese, kids burger and a 6"" pizza that wasn't even deep dish. We came in at 3:30pm on a Sunday in between the rush. The food was lukewarm when we finally got it!! This was after the server offered to bring  the kids food first (but failed to) and we had to ask 3 times for a soda refill for me while he brought my husband a refill. The manager didn't argue about comping our check and offered to redo our meals. At that point, we just wanted to leave not wait longer for mediocre food. The server brought us our comped check and failed to acknowledge the fact that the manager comped our entire meals with an apology. Unacceptable."
Dawn A.,"Roseville, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/24/2016,"I have visited this BJ's location on several occasions and always have great service!  helpful staff all around, and those Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts are amazing! Great place for lunch or dinner, or just sit at the bar and watch some sports!"
Kelly K.,"Petaluma, CA",0,17,1,3.0,10/6/2016,"My teens LOVE their food and menu, so I put up with it.  We tried the bar this time, and the service is no better.  These guys are just really too busy to be great or speedy at service.  It takes FOREVER to order, to get food, and then to pay.  But, the server always shows up for a chat, and ""sales pitch"" (friendly as can be) once it's time to pay.  That annoys me to no end - just be real, apologize, w/ a great attitude, but don't try to sell me on why you should have a great tip though we rarely saw you..."
Remix X.,"Rocklin, CA",1,18,3,5.0,5/9/2017,"Went here on cinco de mayo for a first date. Glad we chose this brewery for our first. The waiter was awesome, great suggestions and was enthusiastic about his job and helping us decide what to order. The wait time was non existent because I called ahead, and he even hooked us up with a free pizookie. Thanks for the great experience"
Nicole S.,"Palos Hills, IL",1,41,8,1.0,4/30/2016,"Only giving this place 1 star because I have to. We came here because it was the only place open late near our hotel. We were seated quickly (party of 5) and our server, Casper, was fantastic, but those are the only good things I can say about this place. The food was disgusting. The spinach and artichoke dip only tasted like artichoke, but we are it because we were starving.  Chicken tenders: How do you mess up chicken tenders?! They dried up my mouth and just tasted off.  Boneless wings: Pretty sure they were chicken nuggets out of the freezer section.  Mashed potatoes: Came out cold.  Jambalaya: Bland.  Never come here if you can help it."
