Dave E.,"San Fernando, CA",0,55,,3.0,9/14/2016,"AVOCADO ROLLS A REAL LET-DOWN mY Brother and I came in at about 8pm on Monday.... a good experience overall.   Fast, efficient service (thanks to Emily) and good/great food for the most part. the one MAJOR drawback was the Avocado Egg Rolls he ordered.  Th Avocado tasted under-ripe and bitter, not creamy as you expect avocado to be.   Plus, few of the pieces  seemed over-fried.  I satiated my brother by sharing my lettuce wraps, which were phenominal  as always... my default dish. ofcourse, we had to end the meal with his first Pizzookie experience... delicious Overall, a very good experience...hopefully  just a bad night for egg rolls."
Lexi H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",164,10,11,1.0,10/4/2014,"Service: 1/5 stars Food: 3/5 Don't even bother coming here, just go to Cheescake Factory or Mikuni's.  I am relieved to see that horrible service is a common theme for this BJ's. The staff here have bored/arrogant attitudes.  Except for Katie! (I hope that's her name) she was very sweet.  BJ's is a chain so you'd think the food would taste consistently the same at every restaurant. THIS restaurant is not that case. Sometimes I get a great pizza, sometimes I get an undercooked pizza. Which I ordered for pick up to discover a doughy, flat pizza... Called in to the manager, Jessica, about my dilemma. she offered to make me another pizza and come back to pick it up - seriously? Told her no, she said they'd send out some kind of refund type ""meal credit"".  She did not sound compassionate at all.  Sometimes my mac&cheese is awesome, sometimes it's really stale. Sometimes my kale salad has kale, and sometimes it doesn't. WTF! It's just so disappointing.  There are BJ's restaurants everywhere these days. I've eaten in other cities, and this place is by far THE WORST."
Justin G.,"Red Bluff, CA",146,50,3,1.0,11/6/2016,"The hosts & hostesses here are not very helpful. They're not very good at acknowledging their customers or their requests. The menu was very basic. Half of the menu items were plagiarized from the Cheesecake Factory. This being said, it was taking us a long time to figure out what we wanted. The server was very impatient with us, and didn't do a good job hiding her frustration. We only order water, so we got up and left. Awkward part was making eye contact with her on the way out. We ate Panda Express instead."
Dimisha R.,"Roseville, CA",51,46,55,5.0,1/11/2015,"Love BJ's in Roseville. It's close by where I live and I always leave happy.  Happy hour, lunch or dinner, great place for beers and food.  I like to set at the bar area, but it does get full around dinner time.  Friendly bartenders and wait staff.  Thanks guys for always giving me great service. :)  oh, and I do find this better than yard house, it doesn't have the long beer list, but BJ's is nicer to my wallet."
Emily M.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/11/2017,"Came in on a Friday night. The wait was much longer than told but being a hostess myself I understood and was patient. I had the server Nick and he was extremely friendly and personable. Definitely will come back. The service was amazing and Nick was very respectful and polite. Overall, my experience here has been great I definitely recommend people to get Nick and to come here. The food is amazing"
Noy P.,"Roseville, CA",5,54,153,4.0,3/25/2015,"Have been going to this BJs quite frequently since it's one of the few dining resto in Roseville that closes late.  Their wines are half off on Tuesdays.  Has late happy hour fr 10pm til close.  Food is good.   Service is usually great, but can be a hit or miss.  I just wish that they can be consistent in serving wine glasses that have no water droplets--- please dry them up before serving to customers.  Nevertheless,  we still keep coming back to BJs--- still worth spending some night caps here. Pics below were taken at different times."
Michelle B.,"Daly City, CA",3,36,92,2.0,6/19/2016,"Nicole, the clueless hostess who said there was no way for us to know when our table is ready, said to come back in 30 minutes to check in. 35 minutes later, I check in and I was told she gave my table away 20 minutes after I put my name in. Then another lady said they did an all call on a microphone and I never came. Microphone? Nicole said there was only check in's. I understand working holidays is stressful..I worked in the restaurant for 12 years and managed a 3M store on Fisherman's Wharf...advice..don't put clueless hosts in charge on high volume days."
Shari A.,"Roseville, CA",49,8,,4.0,10/7/2016,Watching the Giants game on the big screen. Wish they would adjust the a/c a little warmer. Good food.
Julia H.,"Spokane, WA",1,29,3,4.0,8/15/2016,"Went to bjs last night and had another good experience with them. Food was great, our waiter kept us happy by constantly refilling our drinks. I tried the bacon guac deluxe burger and my boyfriend had the chicken cantina pizza both are really good. The pizza was basically an open quesadilla from Taco Bell. Burger was delicious, one of my favorites. I would go there again."
Mike C.,"Auburn, CA",13,12,,2.0,7/12/2016,I have been going to BJ's for a long time due to the consistency and predictability. Tonight was the worst experience ever. From over an hour wait for food to a dropped and busted glass in my lap. Just awful. I am usually fairly patient and understanding but tonight with 3 little kids and 7 adults it was unbelievable. To their credit they did comp my sandwich. It is going to be a while before I/we go back.
Karen S.,"Sacramento, CA",264,653,9,1.0,7/31/2014,"The food here is always ""okay"".  The short version of my afternoon is as follows. I met up with a few friends for a celebratory lunch... only to have the girl who brought our food try to put down my plate, only to dump the entire ramekin of bbq sauce in my lap.  She apologized and brought me a damp napkin, but what ever happened to the comp for dry cleaning? Stuff happens, I get it, no big deal.. really. But: my bbq pork sandwich just went from costing me $9 to $21. Our server kind of made a weird comment/question ""Crisis averted?"" ... I just kind of responded ""yeah?"" because what am I supposed to say to that? Didn't even offer me my soda on the house or dessert... nada. So much for customer appreciation."
Hannah L.,"Lincoln, CA",85,2,,1.0,3/15/2017,"I have ate here & started ordering because of the horrible service. The last time Igot a table here the waiter checked on us once throughout the meal and I actually had to flag him down for dessert (pretty much the only reason I go there). Now, they give me shitty service through the togos lol. My ticket said ""no spoons"" for my pizookies for no reason... Obviously I didn't order my pizookie without spoons and the server taking the order had to type that in. (I work in a restaurant guys, I KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS & HOW TO READ A TICKET) Also I asked for the special whip cream that comes with Oreo cookie THREE SEPARATE times and never goT it in the bag. This place is a joke, and the only reason they are still in business is because of the pizookies lol"
Desirée J.,"Reno, NV",245,12,9,2.0,8/4/2016,"Trying to save your dinner experience for the night when I say DO NOT COME HERE. Seated at 9:50, although our waiter was very friendly and quickly gave us water and took our orders, about 10 minutes later we were told he had gone home and received another. We didn't get food until 10:30. Did not receive check until 11:20, and waited another 10 minutes for our server to take our card. Food was even more disappointing than wait time; boyfriends blt was soggy and my ""sriracha mac n cheese"" was literally noodles with some soupy cheese at the bottom of the bowl. Requested to speak to the manager (very friendly) who kindly and understandingly comped our entrées after we shared our experience. Friendly service but icky food and way too long of a wait."
Ryan R.,"Cedar Ridge, CA",1,9,1,1.0,5/31/2016,"If you enjoy waiting an hour for a plate of food, and waitstaff that are inattentive, then this is your place. This used to be a really great restaurant, but the last couple trips have been extremely frustrating. Total dining time from being seated to actually getting the check, which took forever, was two hours. Probably easily one of the worst dining experiences that I have ever had. Won't be returning."
Elizaveta L.,"San Francisco, CA",56,10,3,4.0,8/3/2016,"My favorite dish at Bj's are their pastas. Sometimes the wait could be a long one, but it also depends what day you would come. I usually go there around 7 on Fridays and sometime I have to wait 10-15 minutes. The crew are super friendly and welcoming. I love to go to bjs for their deserts as well! I LOVE their pazooki!!! Oreo is my favorite flavor. Would definitely recommend."
Emily T.,"Los Angeles, CA",554,260,613,4.0,1/14/2013,"This was such a fantastic location, this one especially and here's why: The boyfriend and I ordered a deep dish bacon cheeseburger pizza, soups of the day and a triple chocolate pizookie. All of that for the December 2 for $19 deal. The pizza was mouth watering delicious (it literally was a pizza that tasted like a cheeseburger). I encourage everyone to try that at least once, I guarantee you'll get hooked. I ordered the brocoli cheddar soup and the boyfriend had a tortilla chicken soup. I found them both to be quite yummy. When it came to the pizookie, the kitchen got our orders mixed up twice...long story short...we waited 30 minutes for our pizookie to come. BUT, the moral of the story is that the manager came to us, personally apologized for taking so long to make our pizookie, gave us everything for $19 and even gave me another $10 gift card for our next visit.  I'm a happy camper =) Will definitely come again."
L E.,"Petaluma, CA",0,27,10,2.0,2/10/2017,"Food was over cooked. Very slow service - didn't come to check on us, took at least 20 mins to great us. The bartender didn't know how to make the drink I requested - which is one of their specialty cocktails. We were sat next to a loud, obnoxious party even though there was plenty of seating throughout the restaurant."
Charlotte S.,"Sacramento, CA",23,119,15,4.0,1/24/2017,Came here the other night with a party of nine. I was actually impressed with the food and service. Shout out to Rosanne who never let our glasses go empty and constantly checked in. The manager also came by our table to make sure everything was great. Their cocktail menu was amazing. The only downside was the pizookie which had barely any cookie and was completely stuck the dish. :(
Valerie K.,"Citrus Heights, CA",501,648,933,5.0,8/2/2015,"Great service at this location! Food was good. Loved the double chocolate chip ice cream. Server was very attentive and helpful. Cider was great. Overall enjoyable experience. Ice cream was slow to come out, but server took care of it right away."
Mal P.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,1.0,7/27/2016,Server took 12 minutes to greet us. Was not apologetic even the slightest. Got our order all in one. We were just there to get a pizookie really fast. Didn't see our server for a half an hour and only for one second when she was dropping off our warm pizookie... So so so disappointed. Didn't want to wait another half an hour to see our server so we had to tell a manger up front. Probably won't be going back... And I can't find a Cookies and Cream pizookie recipe on Pinterest soooo ya. Bummed to say the least.
