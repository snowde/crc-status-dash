Mal P.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,1.0,7/27/2016,Server took 12 minutes to greet us. Was not apologetic even the slightest. Got our order all in one. We were just there to get a pizookie really fast. Didn't see our server for a half an hour and only for one second when she was dropping off our warm pizookie... So so so disappointed. Didn't want to wait another half an hour to see our server so we had to tell a manger up front. Probably won't be going back... And I can't find a Cookies and Cream pizookie recipe on Pinterest soooo ya. Bummed to say the least.
Ashley A.,"Roseville, CA",14,4,,4.0,3/6/2017,Yummy in my tummy so freaking good food I rather pay to eat here then go next door to uncooked food. Besides the girl in front always flirting with male employees. Shame shame shame to her.
Charles F.,"Rocklin, CA",0,8,,5.0,3/4/2017,This place makes great burgers! Pricey but worth it. It's so good it taste as good cold as it does hot! Can't go wrong with a burger here!
Christine A.,"Orangevale, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/4/2017,"Took my family to the Roseville location to celebrate getting a job promotion and the wait, service and food was terrible. Even gave this location a chance to rectify the situation by contacting them directly, not one single response. Management here is the utmost worst I have ever experienced and it shows in the way they treat their clients and staff. I have worked in the food industry and would never treat my staff or clients in this manner. Better service at McDonalds drive thru around the corner. Folsom and Arden area BJ's are a much better experience for your hard earned money. Do not bother with this location as they obviously do not care about your experience/s or return visits."
Amanda S.,"San Diego, CA",6,25,60,2.0,10/22/2015,"My grandmother and I have had our last two Tuesday night get together a here, after our last visit we won't be returning. Our server both times was Richard; an older gentleman with glasses. The first visit; We had two cucumber jalapeño margaritas, the California flat bread, the avocado egg rolls. The margaritas and flatbread were really good but the avocado egg rolls were warm and not very appetizing. Richard brought our drinks, not our food but he checked on us shortly after. We declared we had to come back next week to try the pumpkin cream cheese pazooki.  The second visit; We were put on a five minute wait, after waiting ten minutes and seeing two walk in get sat before us I asked the host when we would we sat, she sparingly muttered "" your next"", and continued to help others who walked in. We sat in about the same area, with Richard serving us, not remembering us whatsoever, he seems rushed and wanted our drinks; we asked for water while we looked, when he brought us our water we asked for two mudslides, the California flatbread, that was the last time he brought anything but the check to the table. Our mudslides took 15 minutes, I exaggerate not because our flatbread got their first. A young lady brought our food, and finally after asking she brought our drinks. They had definitely been sitting, Richard rushed by saying sorry they took so long because they had to get ice cream from the back, pfft. Come on, man fifteen minutes to get some ice cream. When the young woman brought our drinks by, we ordered our pumpkin pazooki we had been waiting for all week, finally when the moment arrived, the same young lady who had been actually serving us brought it out yet again. I was a bit diassapointed, the cookie was barely warm, making it like eating cookie dough with ice cream. I felt like they were understaffed and the food had been sitting, like our egg rolls the previous week.  grams and I will have to find a new place to have our weekly dates."
Hannah S.,"Incline Village, NV",2,11,5,5.0,4/20/2016,"Had dinner here Saturday night, Richard A was our server . Richard was by far the kindest and most efficient server I've ever had, he was great! Food was good, came out quickly and we were all happy with our dinner & service!"
Brandon L.,"Elk Grove, CA",65,389,373,1.0,9/26/2016,"Out of all the BJ's I have been to, this one was the worst experience. Came here with some friends hoping to have a decent meal. BJ's looked busy but it usually is for a Friday night. Service was average so it wasn't anything spectacular. The worse part was the food. I understand since it was busy the kitchen can be backed up so the food took a while to come out. But when we received the food, that was a whole different story. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken from the Enlightened section and this dish was insanely salty. It was like someone unscrewed the top of the salt shaker while pouring the salt fell out. I can barely eat half of the dish. My fiance ordered the Fresh Atlantic Salmon and her dish was overcooked since the salmon barely had it's pink color on the inside and it was chewy. One friend ordered the Alfredo with shrimp and they totally failed that dish too. His pasta was burnt on the bottom and they hoped the sauce will covered the burnt flavor. The manager did come out to apologize and to offer remaking the food but I wasn't going to wait another 40 min for my food. I would avoid this BJ's location if you can."
Mikayla F.,"Carmichael, CA",25,54,38,2.0,7/19/2015,"Came here tonight for dinner and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed. The food wasn't very good and the server was a little less than enthusiastic.  My boyfriend order the top sirloin (rare) with clam chowder and mashed potatoes on the side. The chowder had a good flavor but was really thick. So thick it didn't look like soup. His steak was almost uncooked looking and his mashed potatoes came out cold.  I got the bbq bison burger with mashed potatoes on the side as well. Mine was actually pretty tasty besides the potatoes also being cold.  The serve apologized for the cold food and brought him a new side that had clearly been microwaved.  Overall, I probably won't return."
Len P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/28/2016,"We went there with my family for a birthday dinner and they told us that the wait will be only 40 minutes. We waited for 50 minutes and then came up to the front desk to remind them, maybe they forgot. They tell us 10 more minutes. We wait 15 more extra minutes. And my mom went and talked to the manager and he was giving her attitude and told us we still had to wait. We left, and the manager yelled bye in a bad attitude to us."
Big Al H.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,19,1,1.0,4/30/2016,Ok so first we had to wait for 1.5 houston be seated then once we ordered food and appetizers it took an additional 1.5 hours to just get the 1 appetizer and when the food came out 1 dish of spaghetti was under a heat lamp so long the noodles were hard. The 2 were cold and a kids dish was handed to him hot with no warning. We were a party of 8 BUT 2 parties of 4 received thier food long before us. I will never go back here to listen to thier lame excuse it was busy in the kitchen.  Well if you can't handle a Saturday night rush you're in the wrong business
Nicholas L.,"Rocklin, CA",11,117,29,4.0,7/11/2014,"Being that BJ's is one of my favorite places to eat, I expect a lot every visit. I have been coming here since it first opened and I have always enjoyed it. I've been here with big parties (10-15 people) and small (1-4) people. For the most part, we are taken care of.  The food is normally hit or miss. Sometimes I will have a meal that leaves me wanting to come back the next day and then there are meals that make me question if I should ever return. The service is always hit or miss as well. For the most part, it is better then it is worse. Today, when I went on a lunch date with my girlfriend, it was just an average overall experience. They were not packed, the wait for our food was rather long, and the meal was just ok. Nothing stood out. For those who have had a bad experience, I suggest coming on the weekdays, when they are less crowded. I always give a place that I had a bad experience at a second try. I have always given BJ's a second try and it's always better the second round.  Overall, my experiences have been ranked from really great to really bad. It's very unpredictable with a very long wait for food. I suggest coming here if you are willing to spend 2 hours dinning."
Mari R.,"West Sacramento, CA",32,7,,1.0,8/22/2016,"Horrible Experience. Our group had a party of 5 and we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving by a personable hostess. We came in around 9:10pm and were seated at 9:18pm. After that everything went downhill, we ordered within 10 minutes of being seated and ended up waiting over an hour for our food to arrive at 10:25, and still an additional 15 minutes because my friend's order was sent to a different table..  My order consisted of a soup and salad and the soup was cold when it arrived, and not enjoyable whatsoever.  When I order a hot soup, I would like it to at least be warm enough to enjoy, but it was cold.  Based on the time that we were there they were not too busy, and we noticed that diners that had come in after our party were able to get their food prior to us being served and they had a larger party.  The worst part was that considering the wait time and the horrible service, there was not a single apology offered. No offer to make our dining experience better. I had never had such horrible service. The very least that the manager could have done was to come by the table and offer an explanation, and try to make amends.  The highlight of the evening, was leaving."
Nichole D.,"Roseville, CA",100,44,14,1.0,8/13/2015,"I have to say that while I love what BJs use to be all about I will never eat at the Roseville location EVER again. Being here after 9pm and it not being busy you would think youd have better service... nope. To top it off there was a shriveled up piece of brussel sprout tat smelled like ""poo"" on my burger that was unrecognizable until we started pealing it back. Joe the manager was not a good help either..... im very saddened to have to cross this off my list."
Donna P.,"Reno, NV",0,12,,2.0,1/3/2017,"This was our second visit in a week.  We do live in the area but enjoy stopping for a meal when passing through.  Our meal the previous week was exemplary so we didn't hesitate to return. My husband used the restroom while we were waiting to be seated and he notified the hostess that it was trashed.  Now, this could have just happened but he didn't think so based on the overall condition. We split a salad and deep dish pizza.  The salad was good.  We then waited for a very long time and no pizza.  The manager came by our table and apologized for the delay.  The pizza arrived moments after that, however, it was cold and lacked most of the toppings.  It was a deep dish pizza that was all cold dough.  Yuck!  We sent it back to be reheated but should have changed our order at that time.  We were too tired to complain and probably won't return here. My review won't make a bit of difference as this place is always busy.  I just don't understand how we could have both had such great entrees one week prior and then have this awful pizza."
Kyrstin G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,4,1.0,10/16/2016,"Ugh. This location is the worst. Seriously the worst. I've had terrible customer service so many times. I actually no longer go there, I just order delivery. Last time, they completely messed up my order. This time, honestly I'm probably never, ever coming back. First, I order pick up around 10:15 pm this Saturday. I just ordered boneless buffalo wings with an extra side of garlic parm sauce and three sides of ranch. I show up and what looks like a manager says hi and I say I'm here to pick up a Togo order and he tells me to wait. Why wouldn't you let me know it would be a second when I acknowledge you? I tell him I'll be back and I have to use the restroom. Mind you, I'm coming home from work which includes a two hour drive. I just want to food I pre-ordered and I want to go home. I finish using the restroom... no one is there. I wait. My food finally comes and I pay. I check my food... no ranch... no extra sauce. So, I asked the manager and he goes and grabs it. I realized I didn't reask again for my extra sauce. While I'm waiting for my ranch to arrive... I ask a girl for the sauce. She barely looks up from her phone and tells me she'll let him know. Uh?? He hands me the ranch and tells me he has to get the phone. I get it... he's the ONLY ONE WORKING!! I wait for five minutes while a guy has his back to me counting money, the girl is on her phone and three other employees made eye contact with me... including a general manager. Finally... I'm pissed. I wanted hot food. Finally I go to the hostess desk where the general manager is standing and ask for my extra sauce... AGAIN since one of the three employees I've asked could give it to me and the girl is busy on the phone. I automatically get corrected that she is clocked out. Like this all has to be a fucking joke. How can any paying customer sit there like that and be ignored. I don't care if you're clocked out or not, it's so tacky and unprofessional top sit on your phone like that especially when I've asked for help. Her and the employee that was counting money for an entire 5 minutes then begin to talk about how she's off and waiting for food, right? Like I'm an asshole because I've been waiting for something I asked for when I placed my order 40 minutes ago. Like I'm a dick for being ignored and this chick sitting on the phone. So, I said... I don't care if you're off or not, it's tacky. She then proceeds to argue with me. Like no. At this point, I'm done. No one offered me an apology, nothing. I eat there about 1-2x a week. But, to make my experience worse, I come home and pop a chicken in my mouth to discover it wasn't fully cooked. I tried three. Into the trash it goes. Seriously. Fuck you"
Steve T.,"Carmichael, CA",1,9,,1.0,6/19/2016,"Came here for Fathers Day lunch, second time we've been here in a month and the service was abysmal both times. We thought it was a one off the first time but we are starting to see a common thread as we sit here waiting for service and I seem to have plenty of time to read other reviews that mirror my frustration. It's like we are ghosts and they can't see us!!??  Our meal arrived in a decent amount of time with the exception of my wife's meal which didn't come until I had finished mine. As she began to eat she realized that her meal was missing the meat portion and that the potatoes were not cooked as asked. They did take my wife's meal off the ticket and give us some free dessert (thank you for that).  Wouldn't it be cheaper and more productive to just take care of the customer from the very beginning? I think we will avoid coming here until I start reading positive reviews about customer service."
Jason S.,"Roseville, CA",543,716,1840,3.0,4/22/2013,The family and I like to try new brunch places in and around Roseville...If thinking about BJ's for brunch keep driving...great for all their other menu items but this is a classic place of trying to be something to everyone. I tried the the Spanish omelet and my wife tried their scramble and it was barely ok. The only thing that was decent was my one daughter tried a breakfast pizza which was pretty good. This own is in some desperate need for good brunch places that are non chain orientated. Honestly hate to say but Cheesecake Factory is one the better around. Plus the mimosa's are a total rip off as well. Next time Cheesecake Factory here we come! Now if its lunch or dinner then its a whole new ball game and a decent place to catch one of those....
Robby Christine S.,"Wailuku, HI",0,25,,5.0,7/30/2016,"Good Eats! menu has lots of choices and prices are fair! I got to know my delivery drivers and they were the nicest people ever! totally trusted them with my food, cash, cc#'s ect. highly recommend BJ'S in Roseville!"
Karen M.,"Roseville, CA",0,23,,5.0,4/4/2016,Came in for an early lunch with my family. Seatted pretty quickly and our waitress arrived and promptly  took our drink orders. Wow.

Kept our Drinks full and on top of everything.Thank You for the Excellent Efficient and Friendly  Service. We also appreciated  the fact that our waitress was able to help us with recommendation on food selection. Will be back and will Definitely ask for same waitress
Anastasia A.,"Sacramento, CA",7,9,,4.0,8/8/2016,"I always like going here with my girlfriends and we always have a great time! Everyone is so polite and sweet. I just wish the wait times wouldn't be so long and the food would come faster because I just feel like at this particular BJ's, my food takes foreverrrrr to come."
