Victoria T.,"Roseville, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/27/2016,"We stopped by this branch on a normal day during the evening and got seated quite shortly. The server was great and did everything she could to create a pleasant experience for us. However, the food was not good at all. The broccoli's were soaked in the pasta sauce indicating the dish were prepared way too long before it hit our table and pasta was cold too. Two of the family members ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and surprisingly the two dishes were prepared quite differently. one had very few broccoli's and the other one had much smaller chicken slices that were burned on one side. The mashed potatoes were uneven portions on the two dishes as well. overall, the experience was not a good one at all."
Starla H.,"Chico, CA",23,5,,5.0,1/1/2016,"I came in with my family tonight for my brother's birthday. The wait was long so we opted for a table in the bar area. Although, my experience, the bar section gets sub par service. Our server, Allen O. Was awesome! He was on top of drinks, (mostly waters and lots of refills. We were dehydrated from shopping lol) He was prompt and pleasant! To say the least!"
May A.,"Roseville, CA",718,939,13962,4.0,1/11/2012,"Great food! Wow! so many choices on the menu... didn't know what to get! Ended up with the Grilled Pork Chops - two center cut pork chops, lightly seasoned and grilled, served with sweetened apples, white cheddar mashed potatoes, fresh steamed green beans and a tangy mustard sauce.  Yummy!  Fast, friendly service. Loved the atmosphere. Now I see why there's always a long line here... The parking is huge but with other restaurants, fast food joints, and other businesses around the lot can get full and you may have to park pretty far especially during meal hours. Review #0038"
Don F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/23/2016,"To start, been a long time customer of bjs in Roseville. I am not the type to go out of my way to write a poor review but my last visit definitely warrants one... Waiter was fine, she took a break and the other waiter was good as well. Though we had a black piece of hair in our fries , which was pretty gross. Furthermore, we ordered a double shot of makers mark, and let me tell you, it was not a double shot. The manager came out to argue with us that it was a double shot and never apologized about the fries; ended up charging us for the hairy fries!! Very disappointed and horrible service. Management wise. On top of all of this, we STILL left a tip because my conscious wouldn't let me leave without one. Though we most definitely won't be back!"
Samantha F.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/19/2017,"This is no way a bag on our actual waitress. I came in with my girl girlfriend and it was a Friday night so we both assumed it wouldn't a really quick thing and there's nothing wrong with waiting. There was only two of us and we spent sometime talking and what not, thank goodness cause it took a very long time to get our first order of drinks and one appetizer. We started to notice the waitress was waaaaayyyy over sat. She had a large party plus looked like to be 4 other tables seating about 4-5 people each. Poor thing I felt awful for her. I'm glad that we got her because of how understanding we are. She had noticed towards the end that we just weren't being waited on. She tried to offer free drinks or a dessert to apologize. We didn't accept and told her that it wasn't her fault her manager set her up to fail. I left a note wishing her a better night. Hopefully this review tells the managers that on the weekend nights need to have way more serves. Thank you Christina M for doing the best you were giving by your leaders."
pat G.,"Roseville, CA",0,42,,4.0,4/6/2016,"I really am surprised at the rather off setting reviews. I have had lunch there three times. We  come around 11:15 a.m. So food comes quickly and service spot on. The soup and salad combo ""endless servings' my choice each time.... Tasty  tender clams in the chowder and smooth and creamy. Not thickened with  gobs of flour....Salad, cold crisp and nice variety of crunchy veggies. Dressed lightly and quite pleasant. Lots to chose from for sure . As the menu is diverse and the prices are modest..... By time we did leave is was packed and the crowd  was eating away, lots of  talking and laughing, having a happy time seemed to me. The place holds a lot of folks as it is huge...... and the services people are running as fast as they can...The kitchen must jamming too.  I like it a lot and recommended you check it out !"
Howard R.,"Corona, CA",1,48,7,5.0,4/21/2016,"Went to happy hour from 10-12.  Great deals on appetizers and drinks it you want them. Nice staff. Lots of tvs.  Went on a Wednesday so it wasn't that busy.  Lots of parking. Bartender very friendly and personable.   Food took about 15 minutes.,"
Sree D.,"San Jose, CA",32,157,19,3.0,1/22/2015,"Not my type of food.  Great drinks, amazing service, but oh god , the portions and the food is overloaded with calories and fat."
Peter P.,"Scituate, RI",3,30,29,5.0,1/27/2014,"So, i went here for dinner with my girl for the first time.. right from the start they came threw with friendly service and seated us quickly. We started with drinks, a couple waters, a diet soda and one of there signature blonds, (which by the way, they have some really good beers) and a couple appetizers. For appetizers we tried out the spinach stuffed mushrooms, and the new corn fritters they have. Both, were excellent! The stuffed mushrooms have got to be one if the best appetizers ive ordered before. For dinner we ordered a delicious deep dish pizza, half Hawaiian half Vegetarian with jalapenos. The pizza was on point, definitely fulfilling and had some left overs for later. I'll definitely be coming back, and if your looking for a place with great atmosphere and food with super friendly service than you have to check out BJ's. Cheers!"
Porsche J.,"Orangevale, CA",42,2,,1.0,11/20/2015,"Had the most racist experience from here. Came and asked for a table. Hostess says 20 mins. Came to her 30 min later, shw says that she called us 20 mins ago and it will be 5 more mins. Then calls 7 other couples. Then overhead hostess giving different races different times. If you were black 30 mins, if you were white 10 mins. And other races had the 15 min rule. In this day and age you woukd think money was money. #NotSuportingRacism"
Veronica G.,"Roseville, CA",103,1,,5.0,4/28/2016,By far one of the best customer service experiences we have had. Our server Casper was Amazing! We will be asking for her during any and every visit going forward! The manager was very helpful with any issues we had! No wonder this place is usually packed! That kind of service will keep anyone coming back! Thank you again Casper for taking care of us! Our daughter loved how friendly you were as well! People like you make the biggest difference! Thanks again!
Parker T.,"Roseville, CA",3,13,2,2.0,4/1/2016,"I was throwing a suprise birthday party and called to make reservations for 20 ppl. Service was great.  Two weeks before the event,  I called to confirm.  I was told that there was no record of my reservation and I could not make a reservation on a Friday. The manager was a nice man and accommodated because one of the staff messed up on taking my reservation.  I booked a different venue the next day (due to my hesitation that the reservation would again be lost). I called bjs again to thank them for trying to accommodate and to cancel my reservation. The night of the reservation b j s called me annoyed that we didn't show up and they were now canceling he reservation.... bjs needs to work on its reservation system and staff's ability to book them."
Aimee A.,"Rocklin, CA",66,37,60,5.0,2/3/2015,"I am always 100% satisfied with the food here. I order items like burgers, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc. Always good food.  My favorite here is their avocado eggrolls. I LOVE them."
Jake H.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",3,116,109,3.0,11/19/2015,"I have been to a few of these restaurants and generally like them.  First off my server was very fast and I can say anything bad about the service it was great. I had a pizza which is usually great; however, this pizza was served on the cold side of Luke warm. Cold/warm pizza is not my favorite."
Alisha B.,"Roseville, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/20/2016,"When I bring my son here, it is usually a treat for us.  I've always had a ""good"" experience, waiters/waitresses are normally courteous and responsive.  On this particular day my experience was amazing!  My 2 year old son was in an unusual foul mood and felt the need to yell and throw things on the floor.  My waitress was Angelina, not once did she seem frustrated that my son was making such a fuss. She reassured me that everything was ok.  She made me feel really comfortable and at ease with whole situation. I truly appreciate her kindness and understanding. Thank you Angelina for amazing service!"
Vanessa B.,"Yuba City, CA",0,35,12,1.0,11/15/2015,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. We ordered out appetizer which came about half hour after being seated. Not only did it take forever, they threw it at us with no plates, napkins, or utensils. By this point, we needed a refill... The waitress is nowhere to be found and the busboy refilled our drinks. So about another half hour later comes our meal. We asked for our burgers to be well done... They were rare. Where's our waitress? Still missing! We ended up leaving and paying for garbage food and garbage service. I will never be coming back to this place."
Al S.,"Diamond Springs, CA",862,112,587,4.0,6/3/2016,I have eaten here many times and after eating here just two nights ago I knew I had to write a review. Not every BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is the same. I like this eatery because the staff is always engaged with you as the customer even when they are busy to inform you of where you at on their waiting list to get a table. The servers are always proactively taking care of their customers needs and the manger whose name is Joe is fantastic. The food is always presented very well and if they make any mistakes on an order they are quick to make sure it is taken care of immediately I also appreciate that they keep their rest rooms clean and the entire restaurant is maintained quite well. My only criticism is the parking can be quite challenging especially on a busy evening. You will receive everything that you would get at another BJ's but the one characteristic that I like about this location is that their appetizers are always warm. I have been to other locations that this has not been the case. I recommend that you come and check this location out.
Rebecca M.,"Rocklin, CA",56,33,28,5.0,3/20/2016,"We had an excellent experience at BJ's tonight. Our server, Jamie was amazing, he noticed what we needed, before we even asked.  The food was also cooked to perfection!"
Jamie K.,"Antelope, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Ordered online and arrived at the designated time to pick up my food. After waiting 15 minutes someone finally acknowledged my presence and informed me someone would be with me shortly. After waiting another 30 minutes, I called the restaurant to let them know I was waiting ... And how long I had been there. It took another 5 minutes for someone to come with my food. The food obviously had been ready the entire time because when I got home it was cold. I ended up throwing it out ... Cold greasy fish is not something I had in mind for dinner. Needless to say I will not be back."
Sarah T.,"Folsom, CA",0,14,3,3.0,9/17/2016,"I always get the same things when I come here. The calamari, hot wings, and a triple chocolate pazooki. They are delicious every time and well cooked and made. There are TVs playing multiple sports games at once, and usually the place is quite full. The waiters and staff are acceptably friendly and time managing. The music playing in the background provides a nice ambience, and the place is kept clean. I enjoy coming here when I have extra money to burn. It's a bit pricey, but worth i"
