Andy M.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,5,2,3.0,1/18/2015,First the Pizza was awesome and so was our second server Jessica #231. That said bad things did happen to make it a 3 star review our first server a guy was horrible not at all attentive never took any empty cups or app plates off the table and never asked us if we needed anything boooo you! Last the food that was ordered was Luke warm at best. Like I said the pizza was great and so were the pizookie's once they came out. All in all if I come back to this location ill be asking for Jess or  server like her and it looks like pizza's are the go to.
Roth D.,"Roseville, CA",0,29,4,2.0,9/14/2016,"I'm giving them two star's only because some of the food is really good.  But the service is just horrible. Consistently horrible.  We have been forgotten on so many occasions I will never go back.  They seat you pretty quickly but everything that occurs after that is so slow.  The servers won't make eye contact because they know everyone is irritated with the slow horrible service.  I don't know if this is a common problem for this chain but it is at this location.  If you don't mind constantly having to waive someone (that will be avoiding you) down for service, refills, your check, a kids pizza after everyone else has finished their meal give them a try.  I'm done with this place."
Daniel F.,"Yuba City, CA",1,7,,2.0,8/27/2016,"Usually my favorite place to eat, but their service has definitely gone down and the quality of food is that of a new cook. The food was soggy, service was OK, and when I almost fell twice on their waxy & wet floor I let them know and they gave me the death look. Altogether the quality of management of this particular location has gone down by far."
Hannah T.,"Hayden, ID",84,1,,1.0,9/26/2015,For starters the food is overpriced considering it's not very good. It's always way to packed in there. My homecoming group and I made a reservation a week and a half prior. Once we got there they said 10-15 minutes. We waited 15 then asked again and they said just a few minutes. The next time we asked they said it would be another 20 mins. If you make a reservation you should not have to wait for over 40 mins... We left and went to Jacks Urban Eats- Great Place
Amber D.,"Phoenix, AZ",44,22,3,2.0,3/13/2015,"Happy Hour is great, must sit @ bar. Changed things up tonight & were seated at a table.   Epic mistake: Sloooooooowwww service Ordered the deep dish lasagne (clearly frozen and undercooked).....tasted reminiscent of Chef Boyarde! This was a very disappointing experience. Could have paid $.99 for a can & had a better experience."
Amy A.,"Citrus Heights, CA",15,16,47,5.0,2/13/2015,"We go here with my little family at least 4-5 times a month we love it here, this place is great food is amazing and their deserts just perfect at the end of our meals.

At the end of my meal i HAVE TO HAVE OREO COOKIE PIZUKI  wow the best ever so good even if im full i will get it anyways because i cant come out of there without eating that for finish!! ;))))))  Thanks again you guys are the best!!"
Tiffany N.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",207,368,59,5.0,12/30/2013,"Out of all the experiences I've ever had at any BJ's location I've never experienced service here anywhere else. Our server was John (or Jon? Sorry dude, not sure on the spelling). But he was awesome! We came on a pretty crowded night, but he had awesome energy and was extremely attentive.  We ordered our food. I got the balsamic chicken, my sister got the prok chops, and my brother in law got a steak. When our food came out, he asked my brother in law to cut into the steak to make sure that it was cooked to his liking. This may seem like a small gesture...but I've seriously NEVER been asked that before ever by a server. It was pretty awesome (seeing as how majority of places have totally skewed perceptions of how to cook a steak perfectly). Food was standard as always. But the service I experience here was top notch."
Kimberly N.,"Sacramento, CA",4,63,16,3.0,4/30/2015,"We love the food and the drinks but the service here is okay and can use a little work. It's happened a few times where we're missing an item that generally comes with our entrees and it gets annoying when you have to remind them. Additionally, in one instance we called in our order and when we came to pick it up apparently their call center had a mix-up and our order never made it in. So we add to order in the restaurant and wait even longer for our food to be ready. Again we enjoy the food but the service just reduces their rating for us."
Jatin M.,"Sacramento, CA",50,151,5,3.0,9/18/2014,"Yup, all the bad service reviews are true. It's pretty rare to find a good server at BJs. I know that pretty well as I can't keep myself away from the Santa Fe rolls and pizookie. If service was better, I would probably give it a 4 star because the food is pretty good most times. I mean you get what you expect. But the wait times are crazy - wait to sit, wait to order, wait to get the food, wait to get the bill...it just keeps going on and on."
Sally S.,"Roseville, CA",0,10,7,5.0,4/21/2015,"My go to place to eat as anything I ever order is amazing . The best chicken wings ever and a great drink menu. ""A drink like that"" is my personal favorite."
Liana S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/27/2016,"I went to BJ's for my moms birthday lunch. Immediately as we open our menu, a coupon fell out that offeed a free pizookie with 9.95 or higher meal. Rain was our waitress and it was the best service I've had in years. She was non-intrusive like almost all waitresses are and my water was never empty.  Best mediterranean chicken pita tacos I've ever had. Amazing. The flavor was so condensed into each bite- it was perfectly paired with delicious couscous. Great meal for 10 dollars. My mom got a perfect chopped asian salad for the same price.  At the end of the meal, Rain honored the one coupon for both of our meals and we got 2 free pizookies.  Thank you Rain and the chefs for a great service on a great day. Bj's is the best."
Karen D.,"Roseville, CA",0,11,,4.0,2/25/2016,"Went to BJ'S during the Happy Hour on Monday and we sat in the Bar. Our Server was GARRETT who was Excellent. We ordered the soup and salad (Clam chowder) and the wings with Iced teas. The service was Fantastic as well as the food. The only thing that that could have been better is the wings didn't seem fresh and hot like in the past. They were warm if that and Dried out. Very unusual  for BJ'S. Usually very hot and fresh.  For the price I paid for those wings we should have said something but didn't.   Overall, The service we received made it a nice dining experience."
Donyk J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,,1.0,2/7/2016,"Garbage pizza, tastes like it came out of a prepackaged box. Never will order the pizza ever again. Maybe the other food might be good but definitely not the pizza ."
Bella C.,"Middle Village, Queens, NY",0,15,2,4.0,10/18/2014,"So surprised they were so packed on a Thursday night We waited about 20 mins for a table, however the avocado rolls were worth the wait!! Also the Pinot Grigio they have is amazing  My new fav spot for a chill dinner date"
Ralph B.,"Roseville, CA",5,81,,1.0,10/8/2014,"I have eaten at BJs in the past and the food was ok, but this rating is for their extremely annoying phone system. I called to ask a question and had to endure a very lengthy invitation to order take out food, hear hours, etc, before being able to speak with a human.    So, one star for punishing phone callers with stuff that many of us don't want to hear."
Sophia W.,"Riverside, CA",137,3,5,2.0,2/19/2016,"I understand restaurants are pretty busy Friday/Saturday nights, but it just seemed like it was unnecessarily understaffed. We ordered a pizza and an appetizer. The pizzas always have a long wait, but we knew that. Our app on the other hand... came out only 7 minutes before our pizza. Once our food came out everything was cold. The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the waitress was extremely nice. I felt bad because it just seemed very stressful."
Adriana H.,"Sacramento, CA",232,41,26,3.0,12/29/2015,"This location is always a hit or miss when it comes to service. Christmas Eve my boyfriend and I dined in and had a fantastic dinner with an attentive waitress. Just yesterday 12/28, some friends and I returned for dinner and the service was very off. Both times, being fairly busy. Overall the food is never a disappointment. My go to is the half sandwich/ half soup lunch combo ( They let you order this during dinner time as well). I order the Chicken Tortilla Soup, which is my FAVORITE from any other chain restaurant in the area.I also order the Chicken Club sandwich, the Sourdough garlic bread is what always gets me, YUM. You also can't go wrong with the famous Pizookie for dessert. Oreo is my default but they have several cookie options. The menu is very diverse, I can't imagine not finding something you don't like. My suggestion for first timers is to come on a weeknight between 4-7, I've found I've got the best experience in that time frame."
Sharon U.,"Roseville, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Seat your customers where they request when you have 7 vacant booths to accommodate, DO NOT ever say you can't  because you have to be fair with servers."
Juan M.,"San Francisco, CA",129,95,4,2.0,1/7/2015,"I would give a higher review if we were able to eat our food the night we ordered it. It's a busy place. It always has a small wait, sometimes a long one. We call ahead to the location closer to home.  This time we kinda didn't know we were going to eat there. On our way back from a weekend at the lake, we stopped by with the Aunts. We were sat pretty quickly and the waitress came soon after. The Mr and I were splitting a pizza and a wedge salad. My aunts were having a pasta dish and a burger.  It took a long time to get our food and we never saw our server. When the runner brought out our food it was cold. well, the pizza, burger and fries were cold. Not warm, cold. The pasta was warm, no where near hot.  Our server was no where to be seen. She was busy. They are always busy. So I went up to the hostess and told them what was up.  Jennifer, the manager there, was sent over and was really pleasant and apologetic. She offered to do whatever we wanted. Remake our food, heat up our food. Whatever we wanted. That's why I gave them an additional star. She was great. We had to get back on the road, it was well after 9pm and we still had to get back to SF.  You can't heat up a medium burger, it becomes well done. What's the point in that? We could have had our pizza reheated, but how long would it take? My aunt ate her pasta as it was warm. We had the rest boxed.  She comped the pasta and the pizza. That was nice. She did the right thing. We also got our salads at the same time as the cold food. That was weird. Not sure how the timing worked on that one. Expect to be there a while, wait for a table and wait for the food. If all goes well, the food is tasty and everything is fresh. The first time we went, we had a great server and a great meal.  We will have to seek her out should we return. There are a ton of places to choose from on the four corners of Galleria and Roseville.  BJs should remember that. Good thing they have Jennifer."
Amanda F.,"Colfax, CA",1,20,19,4.0,9/9/2016,"Four stars because the food was delicious and my waiter was awesome. I had a tomato and mozzarella salad. Wonderful combo. BUT we called in a reservation, that they claimed to not know about.. Even though they said come within 30 minutes or they'll give away our seats, we got there in about 20. The waiter we had was awesome, on top of it, super duper funny and helpful. The lady who was not my waiter, brought my salad, and literally threw it in front of me.. And when I say she threw it, I mean she dropped it so hard, it literally bounced and made a loud sound- then instead of an ""oops"" or something, she just walked away. (No wonder why she isn't a server, that wouldn't be good for their company) I would go back for the food, but would call in the reservation and put my name in as soon as I got there (which we did anyway) and I would avoid the half shaved head lady.. She wasn't  the friendliest person in the world"
