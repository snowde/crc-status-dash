K T.,"Rocklin, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/6/2016,"First time at the Roseville store. 5 in the party. All ordered different items. Wedge cut fries double cooked or, had been under the heat lamp, dark brown and just tasted old. Spaghetti and meatballs again to long under the heat lamp, dry and the meatballs over cooked. Took home half thinking a microwave might help. Not so. Good news, the asparagus was divine.  May go back but after the $92.00 disappointment I'll have to let time get rid of the bad taste. Deep dish ziti and ravioli were, well, good."
Katie S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",39,80,2,1.0,6/9/2014,"WORST. SERVICE. EVER. We had a large party that ordered 3 appetizer plates, 1 of which was forgotten and we asked the waitress twice to bring us plates... but they never came so we had to rip apart our drink napkins so everyone could grab a few apps and then pass around the dips. When we FINALLY got our drinks they couldn't figure out who got what. The cream soda (which was flat) was given to the person who ordered a beer and the guy that ordered the beer got a diet soda- the diet soda was supposed to be for the person who got the regular soda and the three that got water never got it... maybe if they had asked instead of guessing we wouldn't have had to play musical drinks. Dinner came AGES later... one of our plates was brought out about 15 minutes before the others and when the others arrived one was forgotten- which then took about 15 more minutes to be served... making a total wait time from being seated to having dinner served for all of the guests 90 minutes. When dinner was served it was disgusting at best.  The fish and chips were so over breaded that I literally had to dissect the fish portion from the breading- but couldn't really get the fish because it had been soaked in oil so long that it was a soggy mess engulfed in about an inch of burnt greasy breading... the chips weren't bad though- so there's one silver lining. We should have known better but we decided to give it one last chance and order pizookie platters- one person was celebrating their birthday so they got their own pizookie- they ordered the triple chocolate and got just chocolate chip =( the platters were also wrong... how hard is it to warm up a cookie and put ice cream on it... come. on. DO NOT go to this BJ's unless you want to wait forever, eat fish mush encased in a burnt bread coffin, and be served a dessert that may or may not be the dessert you actually ordered. Epic fail."
Caitlin S.,"Livermore, CA",0,38,1,1.0,4/21/2016,"Wow. I used to always enjoy going to BJS for happy hour but sadly, I will never come here again. I came here tonight and waited 20 minutes to be greeted. I work in the industry and didn't mind much..just figured he must be busy. Finally, server came by but never came back with drinks. After waiting 40 mins we left."
Cathy K.,"Davis, CA",0,13,5,1.0,6/30/2015,I ordered food 2 hours ago and it still hasn't arrived I called twice to check up on it and they swore it was on its way and then just hung up on me . Worst management and customer service ever!!!!!!
Paul A.,"Citrus Heights, CA",2,11,,1.0,5/22/2014,"I wanted to go here just for a Pizookie and my wife begged me not to saying that the service is horrible there.  I should have listened to her.  I had not been there in a while so I just had to have it.  I wont bore everyone with ALL of the horrible service details that we got while here but after waiting 25 minutes just to order and then getting cold food after another long wait, getting the wrong order, my child never receiving her drink, and the server never coming back to check on us, I was pretty upset seeing how this place isn't cheap. I never got a refill of my drink.  We even asked other servers to find her for us to no avail. The server was quick to bring us our bill. We eventually decided that it was time to go.  I asked to speak to a manager and the girl at the front desk said hang on a second I will when I am through with this, while writing on her seating chart.  Skip ahead several minutes and her several casual conversations with her coworkers later, she still hadn't gone to look for a manager even though she had nothing to do.  I grabbed the GMs card that was on the desk while she just looked at me. I called the GM and left a message letting him know how the restaurant was being run.  Almost two weeks went by before he called me back.  He was very convincing that he was sorry and that is not how the restaurant is run and all sorts of excuses.  He offered a gift card to return.  I told him that was not what I was looking for.  He insisted and took my address down and I graciously accepted.  Needless to say it has been several months and I am still waiting on that gift card.  No one cared all the way up the chain from the server to the GM.  No shortage of restaurants over there.  Good bye Pizookie!"
C M.,"Roseville, CA",0,38,4,2.0,9/30/2014,"Food was burnt, rice under cooked and sever was nice but not experienced as he forgot things such as utensils."
Renee K.,"Orangevale, CA",83,25,43,4.0,12/31/2015,"My friend used the app to do the ""call ahead check in"" option. It is New Years Eve and it worked great. The young gentleman that seated us was so polite, and welcoming. Server was great. Food took a bit but understandably so on New year's eve, it was busy. Food was good, the pizza was a special order and wasn't correct. Just a difference of chicken and ham, not a big deal in our book."
Gary B.,"Roseville, CA",4,5,1,2.0,8/15/2015,"Service and beer were good as usual, but the bjs favorite pizza was a damn mess. First thing I noticed was whoever cut it did a horrible job. I had to use the spatula to cut it. Then I noticed there was absolutely no sauce on it at all, and to top it off all the unions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and olives were raw and not cooked. The only thing on the pizza that was cooked was the cheese.  One piece of pizza literally had nothing on it but a little melted cheese. My wife had the ravioli's and they were good. Thank god we had $25 off using bj pts. Paid for the horrible pizza. Won't be back any time soon."
Diana T.,"North Highlands, CA",0,3,1,2.0,8/22/2015,"I've never had to wait so long in my life to get our drinks ordered. There were people that came 15 mins after us who already got their food when we only ordered what we wanted. (We both had groups of 5) Then after waiting for like 30 minutes, our waiter brought us our food, but got one of our orders wrong. So while everyone awkwardly eat slowly, that person was sitting there waiting for her food. Worst experience in a restaurant ever! The only reason I would give some stars is because the food was not bad."
Nathan M.,"Granite Bay, CA",119,3,2,5.0,6/1/2015,"Amazing experience!!! We arrived later in the evening fairly close to closing, but the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter, Zach, was excellent. He went above and beyond for us. He had great recommendations for the beer and food. He made our night!! Definitely want to come back!!"
Maisha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/27/2016,This has to be the worst customer service. I ordered online and went to pick my food up. They food they gave me had my ordered printed out correctly on the containers but my food inside was wrong. First they didn't give me all my drinks. Then we noticed there was no cheese on the burgers like we ordered and they didn't give us the sides to go with our orders. The manager and hostess together couldn't get the order right nor were they too friendly. Horrible experience. Will never go there again when in town!
Christy R.,"Fair Oaks, CA",13,1,,1.0,1/24/2016,"My fiance and i went to have a late lunch/early dinner, wanted a couple drinks. We ordered a taco platter and a hamburger platter, not surprisingly way to expensive for what it is. Definitely wont recommend for the food. The bar was a sad joke. Drinks are heavily juiced, or watered down, i swear my drink had a splash of whatever alcohol was in it. it was very disappointing. Just wanted a nice evening with my fiance, but we left feeling like we didnt get our money's worth AT ALL. We will NOT be EVER returning. EVER. we will continue to use our neighborhood bar and grill, so much for trying new places. Oh and the bartenders think they are just the hottest shit that ever walked the planet and they actually SUCK. i think his name was mark, just FYI. DON'T GO HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TRY A DIFFERENT BAR AND GRILL!!!!!!!"
Lindsey W.,"Chico, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/24/2016,"We've eaten at several BJ'S in CA and had a great experience each of those times. However, with this one, this evening, we called and were told it would be 20 min. for 4 people. We put our name in at 6:46 (we were in the parking lot)...went in after 15 min. I walked up to the hostess to tell her we put our name in and was told it would be about 10-15. I was a little frustrated at the idea of waiting another 15 min, but not a huge deal. So finally when it's 7:25, and we've got 2 starving kiddos, I go back up and ask how much longer mentioning we have had our name in for almost 45 min. The hostess very rudely says it will be a few more minutes. So we decided forget it and walked out! If you're gonna go so far past the time you estimated, the very least you can do is maybe apologize and give a better time frame. And you most certainly don't give attitude when asked how much longer. We are in town often as we have a lot of family and friends here, but we will not be going to this place."
Rachel V.,"Roseville, CA",43,8,,4.0,10/12/2015,Crazy busy but fairly quick service and the food is great. The server was awesome at answering our questions and brought us our food in rounds that were well timed. Apps and brew were quickly served! We stayed for dessert and it was de-lish!
Wes S.,"Lincoln, CA",41,354,23,3.0,5/27/2015,"I got an email saying basically you haven't been to BJ's in a while and my points would expire.  Say what?  Hells no!  So the fam and I went in for lunch on a Sunday.  It was pretty busy, but no wait to be seated.  That dang menu always gives me problems.  There is just so much to choose from it really is hard to narrow down my selection.  I ended up ordering the parmesan crusted chicken sandwich, wife got salmon and daughter ordered cheeseburger and fries.  THHHEENNNN the wait began.  The people next to us ordered there food probably 10 minutes after us and got their food before us.  The dude who got his food even said ""sorry"" because he even realized it.  We finally got our food after 45 minutes and the food was its typical goodness.  I didn't do any beer this time(had enough over Memorial Weekend).  They keep sending out emails with coupons so we will probably be back sooner than later."
Teresa P.,"Roseville, CA",7,7,1,3.0,12/6/2015,Food is always good. Staff friendly. A little too much time between visits from the servers each time I eat here but it's still a treat. The pizookie adds about ten minutes to your experience because they bake them fresh.....so delicious! Going with chocolate chunk tonight.
Dee D.,"Sacramento, CA",16,151,793,4.0,9/25/2015,"Pretty decent (albeit generic and expected) food, but be prepared to wait!  Granted we had a large party, but the food took forever to come out.  Whenever I come here, I always order the pizza because I know it's good!  The deep dish mediterranean (no chicken to make it veggie) is my favorite.  Free refills on root beer and cream soda - tastes like liquid candy.  Also free refills on Shirley Temples.  Too bad I never have room for dessert - the Pizookies always look amazing."
Jen F.,"San Diego, CA",48,10,15,5.0,4/29/2015,Avacado wraps my fav!  Pizza is great too... Not to mention always great drinks and they stay open late
Rosalio G.,"Lincoln, CA",1,3,1,1.0,7/4/2015,Bad service! Long wait times and table not prepared for service. When we complained to the manager he also took 30 minutes to fix the problem. Left without touching food that I had been sitting there for 30 minutes waiting for eating utensils.  And it was a Wednesday not even a busy day we just wanted to celebrate a birthday for party of 9.  There loss in profit and I tip above and beyond whenever I get good service.
David O.,"Antelope, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/29/2016,"As a regular at this specific BJ's I was definitely insulted with my experience. My night started off with the waitress spilling water all over my phone. I understand accidents happen but I decided I would file an incident report just in case I'd have any issues with my phone. After eating my meal they didn't even have the courtesy to cover my tab. At other restaurants where a waiter/waitress spilled a drink on the table, they would cover the meal. In this case, they spilled water on my phone and the least I'd expect is for them to pay for my meal. I decided that I would let the manager (Amy) know that I was disappointed in their inability to show common customer service and after saying that all the manager said was, ""Okay"" and turned around. After I walked out, my friend walked out a minute or two after me and mentioned that the same manager and some of the associates were mocking me and talking about me. Terrible customer service and I'm definitely not coming back to this location again. I come here every Sunday with a group of 10-15 friends and I'll be sure to tell them about my experience and we will not be coming back here."
