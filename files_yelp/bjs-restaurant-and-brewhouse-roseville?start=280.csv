Tonya H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/17/2016,Can I leave less than one star?  Went for desert but was served raw cookie dough with ice cream. Waiter literally didn't even say anything when he placed it on the table.   Horrible service.  Horrible food served.  Won't be back.
April T.,"Pine Grove, CA",0,7,1,1.0,7/17/2016,This location is awful. We went on a Sunday at lunch. Waited over 40 minutes for our wings and they were cold. We sent the wings back and they nuked them and bought them back out to us. Other customers have come in and ordered after us and got their food before us....... Still waiting for our food!
Derek F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",393,246,45,5.0,7/11/2015,Yes yes yes I love BJ's more than anything I love the triple chocolate present eat and I also love the balsamic chicken that they have anytime I see a BJ's I immediately pull over and park my butt right there with me a pazookie
Chris R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,33,1,2.0,1/10/2016,"Well I never would of thought that yet another bjs restaurant would disappoint me and my family. But this one has. After coming from church me and my family decided to go to our favorite bjs. After ordering our favorite meal which was the bison burger, we waited 28 minutes for our order. When arriving the burgers were like a sponge they were beyond well done. I even had a hard time cutting the burger in two. My grandmother decided to eat her burnt burger because we waited so long. I sent mine back and just lost my appetite. I feel sorry for my server she tried really hard to correct the situation but it was out of her control. I am lost on where to go for a good bjs. Or maybe this was a hiccup. But I am reluctant to come here again."
Brian C.,"Elmhurst, NY",289,326,35,3.0,3/7/2014,"The pizookie is awesome, though I can't say the same for the food or service.  I had the shrimp scampi pasta dish, which was just ok and I'd recommend not to order it. The service was whatever, especially because I felt like my waiter had an air of sarcasm about him.  BJ's is a chain, so take it as you will (I'd assume the quality of food varies slightly while the quality of service varies greatly from one location to another). I guess it's good for beer and drinks, but I have no reason to return other than maybe for a pizookie if Angela wants one."
Alfie C.,"Lincoln, CA",266,112,52,2.0,5/6/2014,"Tonight 5/6/2014 started out alright.  We didn't have to wait too long, found a table at the bar.  Services was good at the beginning and as dinner continued services became worseZ. Our waitress, at some point disappeared.  I believe she went on a break, neglecting to let us or anyone one of her colleagues know.   We were looking spend a nice evening having dinner and it quickly went to crap.  Three stars was a little generous of us.  At the end Richard took over and while he wasn't our waiter he ended the evening for us on a pleasant note..."
Marissa U.,"Roseville, CA",46,9,,1.0,7/9/2016,"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed. I come to this BJs all the time and today was just not their day. We were a big party of 13 but it took 15 minutes just to give our drink order another 15 minutes to get our drinks and 1 1/2 hours to get our food. My order was completely wrong. I ordered the rib eye with a house salad with ranch and a baked potato. The salad came out and it was a mixture of ranch and balsamic vinegar so they messed up and instead of making me a fresh one they drenched my salad with ranch. Which tasted nasty because the balsamic dressing was super sweet. My steak came out and it was practically mooing at me to the point that the waitress was surprised herself. The potato had nothing. No butter, sour cream or chives. So disappointing. Then I told two of the waiters that it was my sons birthday and wanted to surprise him with a pizuki it never came out which sucked because we were with all of my husbands family and it would of been super special. Then when the check came out I let them know it was separate checks and that number 1 was a rewards account. Well that didn't happen until the 3 time around granted we ended up getting $14 off instead of $10 but still it was such a hassle. I'm not quite sure what happened but I was so disappointed. It wasn't super busy so that annoyed me even more. I don't think it's ever taken us 2 1/2 hours to get out of BJs and with such bad service."
Kerry S.,"Granite Bay, CA",5,56,4,1.0,4/16/2015,"This restaurant and brewhouse was way better when they first opened! In recent years their menu has gone downhill, and so has their customer service. They forget to bring appetizers, and they forget to give you refills. The past few times my husband and I have tried this place it has been lacking in every area, and we will not go back."
Kelsi G.,"Sacramento, CA",25,4,,1.0,9/24/2015,"For the first time, I had a sincerely unfortunate experience at one of my late favorite restaurant chains. Not only did I have to send my salad back because of the greasy, filthy plate, but I also had to send back my entree (pizza) because they didn't finish making it. I always enjoy a BJ's experience until today. The manager came out after I asked for a discount on the awful food because I didn't eat more than a slice of pizza and he took the salad off the bill. That's it. Then I had to send the check back because the check was ALSO wrong. I feel bad for the server because he was cool and none of it was his fault. The kitchen and the manager could have been substantially better. Goodbye, recent favorite restaurant. The only thing that made me happy was the AC."
Stephanie S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,44,,3.0,12/14/2015,"Not very good food, but my server Jen, worked her a-- off for me. The three stars are because of her. If it weren't for her, I would probably give this spot two stars due to the food being so meh. The chicken was rubbery and the quinoa did nothing to compliment the flavor of it.  Seriously, why are we robbing Peruvians and Bolivians of this staple of their diet if we're not gonna cook it properly? Only good thing was the mashed potatoes and gravy. Oh, and for some reason, I had trouble accessing Youtube via their wifi. Maybe they don't want to pay for the bandwidth. But other than this, the only good thing about the place is the nice staff."
Ramon N.,"Rocklin, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/21/2015,"Excellent food and service.  Sometimes long wait times but expected on an excellent joint like this.  I left my cell phone and the staff took care of it and was waiting for me to pick it up in 10 minutes.  Btw,  the Nutty Brown was great while waiting."
Ursula O.,"Lincoln, CA",1046,288,720,5.0,7/10/2012,"Ooookk... I was actually sitting at TGI Fridays, getting horrible service, when I realized BJ's was still open (on 4th of July... Actually I called while at Fridays). Upon coming in, we were greeted with a smiling face, say at a tall table in their bar area, had drinks with in minutes of sitting. What amazing service by Melissa, the bartender and server!!! Our appetizer came and we enjoyed it! Then our pizza came, and e enjoyed every bite of that. Amazing service from Melissa. There were almost 10 other tables and she still kept all her tables happy!!"
Heather L.,"Reno, NV",0,13,,1.0,6/2/2016,"So bad! I know if you are a regular patron of BJ's one bad review won't stop you from returning, however I was a regular at this particular BJ's and as of tonight I will NEVER go back. First off service was slow, not a big deal it always is. But I ordered the seared ahi salad, something I get all the time. It was inedible, the lettuce had turned and was slimy, the tuna was decent and I made the mistake of telling the waiter that. It basically negated the fact that they served me expired disgusting salad. They took so long to get us our food that by the time we had to wait and wait and wait for our bill I had to leave my husband and son there to get our eight month old home to bed. When my husband got home he explained that they did take 50% off my salad and the manager told him that it was because ""I liked the tuna so much"" Now let me make this clear I didn't intend for them to discount the bill at all, but the fact that the cheap manager attempted to recoup her loss by saying I raved about the tuna was a bold lie. It was the only edible potion of my dinner and we had just left baseball practice, I was starving I would have eaten bark! This was an awful experience from the service of the staff, manager, and the food was absolutely revolting! I know this will not deter the average person going to a chain restaurant that they go to all the time or expect to get typical BJ's food, but if this even opens they eyes of the management at that location this review has done its job. Speak to your kitchen staff and make sure they are serving decent food, you can get very sick from turned greens! Yuck!!!!"
Leslie K.,"Rocklin, CA",0,2,2,1.0,9/16/2015,WHAT!!!! No more Oatmeal Raisin cookie Pizookies?!?! Who takes Oatmeal Raisin off the menu? It is a staple when you are talking cookies and ice cream! Ridiculous! We literally took Uber here after a nice dinner for our 10 year anniversary JUST to have this dessert. SO disappointed. BRING BACK OATMEAL RAISIN!!! The only redeeming thing was our server Kyle was not only super understanding but just great all around.
Natasha L.,"Roseville, CA",2,29,,2.0,3/5/2015,"BJs has always been a family favorite for us. But for some reason this particular Bjs is not up to standard. They were really good when they first opened but now i find the food is not good at all. I ordered a kids meal for my son and the chicken looked reheated and it was tough. He couldnt eat the smiley pototoes as they had been refried and tasted of oil.  My meal of pasta was really watery as if someone hadnt drained it enough.  We thought that might have been a one off incident and went back to try again. The food just isnt good here.  Otherwise, the service is excellent."
Nicole M.,"Antelope, CA",0,16,1,4.0,10/16/2014,"Best thing about this place was the staff. Everyone was extremely friendly and our server was very prompt and efficient.  The one thing I did not like about it and the reason they did get the 5 stars was due to my food being brought out at room temperature. Compared to what everyone else in my party ordered, my meal was simple and probably only took 5 minutes to make instead of 15 minutes for everyone else. I get that it happens but when I got my meal, it was actually completely cooled down in several areas leading me to believe that their warmers weren't working efficiently. I'll definitely go again, this was my first time and although the food was cool, it was still good."
Desta L.,"Miami Beach, FL",33,14,3,3.0,11/30/2015,"My boyfriend and I eat here pretty often and normally we order a meat pizza but the past couple times we've ordered it, it barely had any meat on it and when we went yesterday, they only put pepperoni on it.. Service is okay.. Love the pizookies of course lol."
Justin B.,"Reno, NV",0,4,,5.0,11/26/2015,I had great service food was wonderful. I actually got a Calzone which was not on the menu and he wrote it on the bill as a small pizza. Great all around environment couldn't ask for better.
Stephanie T.,"Sacramento, CA",273,434,43,3.0,3/29/2014,"Been here for lunch on the weekdays a couple of times.  This is like any other standard BJ's with their standard menu and food. They do get pretty busy around lunch, so service is a bit slow.  If you're coming here for lunch, try to think about what you want to eat here before you arrive so you can order ASAP once you're seated."
Sheila R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,1,3.0,11/20/2015,"Management reached out to me thru both this review and the one sent into their website. Apology not only courteous and genuine,  but also touched on all my points. I felt heard, and received a voucher to help lower the cost of dinner. We did return to same location, with friends, to see if indeed improvements had been made as promised. It was warm-er, however still cool. And we sat in the greenhouse room where the huge vents are not all positioned right over your head. I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup again- and it came warm instead of cold this time. However, hot soup would be nice. Everything else was good for our party of 6, and our server was excellent."
