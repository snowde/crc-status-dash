Terre P.,"San Jose, CA",244,200,101,1.0,1/12/2015,"It was Saturday night and apparently a brewery is the place for teenagers to go for prom.  Also apparently this BJ's was a little overwhelmed by the crowd.  We arrived about 7:45 after sitting all day at the nearby hospital.  We put in our name about 7:50.  We were told about 15/20 minutes for a table.  At about 20 after 8:00 (it had been about 30 minutes) I mentioned to my husband that it had been a long time and maybe I should check on the table.  He assured me that they would buzz us when it was time -- that is what the pagers are for.  At about 8:32 I said we really should check . . . and by we, yes, I meant him.  He went over to the desk and I saw them give him a new pager.  Apparently ours was broken, he was told when they walked through the bar area --- which was packed full, with muliple sports events being played on multiple TVs -- saying our name, no one answered.  So I am guessing that people check in and walk off with the BJ pagers all the time?  I guess since we didn't answer they assumed we left?  With the pager?  My husband said that he was told another 5 to 10 minutes . . . which would put us at 8:47 three minutes from an hour after we checked in.  I waited exactly 5 minutes then I went to tell them that they needed to seat us or I was going to start eating their customers . . . . I was very hungry.  They were going to clear a ""4 top"" for us ""because we had been waiting a long time.""  Ya think?  While I was at the hostess desk my hubby went to the restroom. I was looking for HIM when I happened to notice a small young man standing at the very edge of the bar mouthing our name.  REALLY?  The second pager they gave us didn't work?  And this little man was standing at the edge of the bar ---- NOT WALKING THROUGH THE BAR AREA --- STANDING at the edge saying our name?   I'm thinking the fumes must affect the brains of the people working here . . . . . . So since we had an HOUR to decide what to eat the minute the server -- or whatever he was -- came to the table we were able to order.  My hubby and I ordered the same thing except he asked for a side of mayo IN ADDITION the mayo ON the burger.  I asked for a different type of bun.  The waiter started a conversation about using mayo to dip fries in -- so it was clear that the mayo ordered on the side was for the french fries.   By 9:30, we still didnt' have our food.  And when it arrived.  There was a tiny little dish of mayo.  Enough to cover the tip of the knife and no mayo on either burger.  The person that delivered the food was not the person that took the order nor the person that took over for the person that took the order.  She was a drive-by server I call her because she didn't really stop as she ran by setting the plates down, we hollered after her to bring us additional mayo since it seemed as if there was none on the burgers.  Also, I didn't receive any produce on my burger.   Since the drive-by server was so rushed and already gone, I went back to the front desk to inquire as to who I need to talk to about getting produce for my burger.  She asked what kind of burger I ordered.  Well, the same one my husband ordered yet he has produce and I don't . . . . So she said what would you like, I said, ""Lettuce.""  She said, ""Any onion?""  I said, ""Oh, why yes, that sounds nice.""  I wasn't even thinking of onion, but once she said it that sounded good.  So they brought me a plate of lettuce.  Yeah, really.  So I asked where my onion was and he had to go get it. The beer was good.  They had a cider that was nice.  I was so hungry by 9:45 --- ya know, almost TWO HOURS after we arrived for dinner --- that I would say my burger was very good.  Both of our burgers were over cooked . . . but I was so hungry I didn't care.  My hubby did.  So I probably don't need to say that we will not be going back to BJ's --- for burgers at least.   I've been to this location before and, why yes, they are S L O W, but this brought it to a new LOW. I wrote this post soon after my experience, but didn't post it.  Now that my niece wants to go here for her birthday, I am posting this.  Because I am throwing a little fit with my family and telling them I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO BJ'S.  It will be Valentine's Day and I am absolutely positive that this location WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE VALENTINE'S DAY AS THEY COULDN'T HANDLE THE CROWD FOR PROM.   So, if we end up here you will know because I will be the one that was dragged in kicking and screaming!"
Brittney A.,"Roseville, CA",87,44,,1.0,12/31/2013,"So irritating here tonight. I called ahead for seating and was told 30-40 mins. Okay, sounds good right?! Nope, after waiting an hour and a half... We finally have a table. During our wait time, you notice that the hostesses do whatever they can to avoid eye contact with you. That bothers me. I understand restaurants can get very busy. But at least ATTEMPT to give your customers an accurate time frame so the experience doesn't start out terrible. Not to mention how frustrating it is to wait with two young children that are very hungry.  In the mean time, I got to listen to the employees complain about being on a double shift and how they haven't been tipped well at all today, or how its not even worth being here right now. Well that's great to know.  I was very hopeful that the food and service at the table would be better than the wait was but I was disappointed again. The drink I ordered was terrible, so I just opted for water instead. The meal itself was okay, but not great by any means. Then our dessert came out not even 5 minutes after our dinner did. Timing was way off on that one. High hopes for the dinner tonight but was really disappointed."
Robyn Y.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/14/2016,"I love BJ's!  I love the atmosphere, it's fun and relaxing.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  The fish tacos are awesome!!"
R. V.,"Yuba City, CA",0,23,2,4.0,9/5/2013,"First time to this restaurant and the hubby and I were pleased. We started with fried calamari, which were delivered fresh and hot (not chewy). I really liked the dipping sauces (marinara and a slightly garlicky cream) that came with the dish. I had the Texas-style chicken fried steak with a pepper cream gravy. Very credible CFS and the gravy was tasty. Only thing I would add is a touch more salt, but that is my taste buds. This dish comes with white cheddar mashed potatoes but I substituted the wedge fries instead (no reason other than I like fries with my CFS). It also comes with fresh veggies that were not cooked to mush (really hate when that happens). Hubby had the pulled pork sandwich and wedge fries with cole slaw. The BBQ sauce was just the right amount of tangy and the pork tender. My hubby is not a small man (not big either) and he couldn't finish his dinner and neither could I. Did I mention the portion sizes are flippin' HUGE??!?! You could easily feed two people per plate for what we ordered. I couldn't believe how much food you get for the price. I also had a watermelon margarita, which wasn't on the drink menu but the bartender had no problem making one for me. Hubby got a root beer, which he really enjoyed. Steve was our waiter and very attentive, making sure we had everything we needed. Jon the manager came by to see how our meal was. We told him we enjoyed our meal and the service and we would definitely be back. The menu is very large and there seems to be something for just about anyone. Next time we go we plan on checking out the pizza and the beer."
Carrie A.,"Auburn, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/11/2016,"Poor customer service, not our server, but management.  Their food keeps getting worse and worse, disappointing, there are too many microbreweries out there now for them to treat their customers so badly.  We had wilted lettuce, dry, over cooked jambalaya, dry pizza, it was just bad all the way around. Don't waste your money here."
Kate S.,"Auburn, CA",15,32,16,5.0,11/6/2015,We went there last night for dinner and it's a very busy place for sure!! The food is always great ...I had the bread bowl with calm chowder and a ceasar salad. Both were very good...waiter was very quick and attentive.  I would definitely make reservations or get there before the dinner rush. Lots of tv's to entertain you  too.
Denis L.,"Antelope, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2016,"Since the New York Strip disappeared off the menu, everything has gone downhill. Can never get a steak cooked to medium level. Its always served rare or medium rare. Test this theory yourself. After they cook it for you, it becomes well cooked. Terrible."
Chuck B.,"Grass Valley, CA",22,9,32,4.0,8/9/2014,The black and bleu-house burger was like no other. Very refreshing to have a hamburger that stands out from the rest. For beer I got the Oasis Ale. Very good toasty flavor.
Brittany D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,4/2/2015,"Went there Sunday night. The service was alright but the food was beyond horrible! I went with my mother who ordered the pasta while I ordered a bison burger, medium well. My mothers pasta was under cooked, she took two bites and couldn't eat any more. Now my burger came out rare, which I wasn't a fan of at all! This is the only BJs restaurant that I would tell people not to go to!"
Maxim D.,"Roseville, CA",244,134,80,4.0,3/9/2014,This place is always busy but it has a great selection of food to choose from. My favorite is the fish tacos or I usually gets the Cobb salad. I usually finish my night with dessert.  So I get the pizookie which is a hot cookie and it has a big  scoop of ice cream on top of it witch  just melts and makes it taste like  heaven on earth.
Joe P.,"Modesto, CA",0,7,2,2.0,10/27/2015,"Finding multiple dirty dishes being used to serve food and drinks was annoying especially after slow service. Food was good at least, tried to not complain about it though because I had a feeling waitress would make the experience worse. They should hire a new dishwashing crew is the main request"
Krissy D.,"Lincoln, CA",4,13,,5.0,3/17/2015,I love BJs!! I've never had a bad experience here - the food is delicious (must get a pizookie every time!) And the staff are friendly and helpful. I'd recommend this place to anyone! :)
Anthony P.,"Dallas, TX",178,111,66,3.0,4/12/2012,"Started off with the house Hefeweizen and a plate of calamari! Great combo before the main course. The calamari was tasty and we finished it quickly. The portion was a little on the small side though.  For the pizzas, I wanted to try both the BBQ chicken and the BJ's Favorite. I didn't want to order two different pizzas, so the waiter told me I could have both flavors on the pizza! So that's what I did. When it came out, I thought I was getting a deep dish pizza. What I saw was a normal pizza, and I was quite disappointed. Was I supposed to specify which one I wanted? Nobody ever said anything. Or maybe it was a deep dish and I didn't know it. Either way, still disappointed. Too much crust to topping ratio.  I also tried their new crispy jalapeno burger. It had about 5 or 6 deep fried jalapeno slices on the burger, but nothing was spicy. Overall, a mediocre burger but I wish it had more jalapenos so I could taste it more. Lastly, for dessert, I ordered a mini white macadamia nut pizookie. At this point I was stuffed so this was the perfect size. The cookie and ice cream combo was delicious! I'm a fan of any of their pizookies. Service is great here. These nice waiters are really helpful and will stop by pretty often to check up on you. Great beers and appetizers, OK food, and good service earns this place 3 stars!"
Amy N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,,2.0,7/24/2015,"Good food, bad service. Granted, it is a Friday night and they're busy, but our waiter completely disappeared for extremely long periods of time. No update on our food or dessert and it took Forever to receive both. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is delicious. Good food does not make up for super slow, non-existent service."
Tania H.,"Sacramento, CA",161,144,130,2.0,1/20/2014,"So the boyfriend and I came to this particular location for happy hour tonight because I had $25 off my next meal (if you are a frequent BJ's diner sign up for their rewards program) and we were shopping at the Galleria.  Now I'm giving 2 stars because our beers came out in a timely manner and are always good (try the Jerryburst it's a combination of their Berry Burst and Jeremiah Red) and our server was decent. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken (my usual) and my boyfriend ordered a deluxe burger with thin cut fries. We were waiting probably 45 minutes when our server let us know that she was checking up on our food but when our food came out my chicken was dry, the mashed potatoes were lukewarm and my broccoli was mushy. Like so mushy you could feed it to your toothless grandma and she'd be able to chew it, swallow it and not choke. My boyfriend wanted his burger medium rare and it came out well done and his fries were cold. Now I've been to other BJ's locations where it's been busier than this BJ's was tonight and have had faster service so my meal here was pretty disappointing. Lesson learned from this: stick to the BJ's in Elk Grove with my usual server because she's awesome. Her name is Sarah. **side note: a few years ago when my boyfriend and I first started dating we came to this location and a spider fell into our spinach dip from the ceiling. The manager gave us a new one but only because we could see the web the spider travelled down. It was pretty funny."
Robert R.,"Orangevale, CA",5,12,1,1.0,1/28/2015,"This review is in reference to Bj's management team who's attempt at answering Yelp reviews are just as disappointing as the restaurant.  Not only did I email a response, I called and left a message with my cell number.  Do you think I got a response.......Of course not.  They obviously have no intention of making this experience right.  The only course of action I have is to never go back and make sure none of my friends or clients return.   GO SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH YOUR MONEY!"
Joel J.,"Folsom, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/29/2016,"I have been to BJ's in Folsom several times and overall, it is pretty good. Went to BJ's in Roseville just yesterday and it was not a great experience. I asked the waitress lots of questions to try to decide what to order. She gave me her opinion so I ordered the thin crust pizza. The menu described the pizza differently than it is actually made. I ordered a thin crust pizza and it was crispy on the very edges but the rest was greasy and mushy. I hate to blame the waitress, she was just giving her opinion. It's my fault that I ordered what I did. I guess she likes mushy pizza but it was pretty gross. Then the manager (I assume that's who he was), came over to offer to get me something else. My family was half done eating by then and we didn't have all day to wait for them to make something else. So I told the manager we didn't have time to wait but he didn't offer to even comp my pizza. We ended up paying for crappy food. Not a fan of the Roseville BJ's at all."
Ron P.,"Roseville, CA",1,10,2,3.0,4/1/2015,"The food is good. The service is good. The downside is they must think their customers are stupid.  They have Fox ""News"" on. I don't like being lied to while drinking and eating."
Ellie W.,"Auburn, CA",0,15,8,4.0,6/30/2015,"My boyfriend and I come here all the time and always leave with happy bellies. The food is always hot and tasty, and dessert is hard to beat. Sometimes food or service will take a bit, but it is always very busy so we understand.  Service has never been anything but friendly and attentive.  Girls in heels- Beware of the hardwood floor in the bar area (you have to walk on it to get to the restrooms). I have slipped and fallen down once and I have seen some other girls do the same! They will always warn you about the one step into the dinning area, but they never mention the slippery floor!"
Christopher G.,"Detroit, MI",15,58,393,5.0,4/17/2014,"From calzones to pizzas, pastas to burgers and beyond...this restaurant has great options.  And the craft beers are worth trying out, especially seasonals!"
