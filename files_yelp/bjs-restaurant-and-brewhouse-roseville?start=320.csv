Alex B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,29,,2.0,11/23/2014,"Rarely go here, maybe once a year if that. I was shocked to find the bar area floor just as slippery as I remember from my last visit here. I figured they just mopped it with greasy water or something the first time, now I realize they just don't know how to clean a floor. Pretty gross not knowing what your sliding around  on as you walk through the bar area. Since I'm on the bar area now, revisiting this place brought memories of a disgusting smell coming from the bar that I remember from my last visit as well. It smells like a dirty dishwashing area that doesn't get properly cleaned. Besides their cleanliness issues, their hostess station is incompetent. There was only 2 of us, not a large group or anything. We checked in, we're told it'd be about 15 min. After around 30 min and seeing numerous people come in after us and get seated before us, we asked what was going on. Apparently they have some ticket system they use because the girl stated oh, here's your ticket, he'll seat you now. Don't know if that meant they forgot to put us on the cue or what but it was obvious by their reaction we were forgotten about.  Once we were seated, a waitress greeted us very promptly but after that it was few and far between. I have no doubt we could have walked out and it would have gone unnoticed for a half hour or more.  With the greasy, hazardous floors, gross smells and terrible service I don't think I'll ever go back. So many choices of restaurants in this area I wouldn't bother with this one."
Heather L.,"Rocklin, CA",2,26,,2.0,7/26/2015,"We were looking forward to a good dinner, but were thoroughly disappointed. We haven't been to BJ's in awhile but remembered it was good. The beer was really great however it went downhill from there.  I was impressed with their ""Enlightened  entrees"" selection which all sounded good. I opted for the North Beach Mahimahi shrimp dish over couscous. I didn't realize I had ordered fish soup (sarcasm). The fish was advertised to have a ""Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub""...yeah no, it must still be in the desert because it wasn't on my fish. The shrimp was supposed to be sautéed, more like nuked, and I was expecting traditional couscous, not lumps of pasta. It was also supposed to come with Kalamata olives which I'm assuming were lost out in the desert with the Big Poppa's rub. There was no seasoning except the flavor of chicken broth. Even the fresh basil had no flavor. My husband had a small Sweet Pig deep dish pizza. He said it was undercooked, doughy, and flavorless. My son had a CHEESEburger, however it would appear that the cheese too was lost with Poppa's rub and the olives. What was left was unseasoned and tasteless. However, he did rave the french fries were awesome. It also took an eternity to get our dinner...hmmm...maybe they were out searching for the elusive rub, olives, and cheese. Not sure. Sadly I think I will be scratching this one off our list."
T. W.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,426,202,3.0,3/13/2015,"It's your typical BJ's with a vast menu, lots of TV's, but inconsistent food and service."
James L.,"San Diego, CA",14,72,4,4.0,6/13/2014,"I always come here for their lunch specials - Cajun pasta with clam chowder are my favorite. Brenna is my server and kudos for her guest service. Very efficient, quick and always have a smile on her face. Also, she keeps herself busy behind the bar. Always looking for something todo, organizing & cleaning. Good employee!!!"
Andrew S.,"Cool, CA",8,31,3,2.0,5/4/2015,"Server was great!  Kitchen SUCKS!  Ordered 2 pizzas and a hamburger.  I understand both have different cooking times but the Kitchen Staff does not. The pizzas came out great!  The hamburger looked like it had been sitting for over a half hour.  Cheese look like plastic, burger was cold, jalapenos were the smallest I had ever seen.  Arden Mall location of BJs is one I frequent and never had any issues.  This one here in Roseville needs some help..."
Sherry L.,"Roseville, CA",49,39,1296,2.0,4/8/2014,"Actually this place is always good from the pizza,pasta,burger n dessert.i gave 2stars bc my fav baby back ribs is not good anymore,they changed it to regular ribs instead the baby back.the meat is not soft n juicy like be4 that's y I'm so disappointed."
Meghan W.,"Penryn, CA",726,144,52,2.0,12/21/2013,"Something has changed about BJs. I have been there a ton of times and usual enjoy my food and drinks.  I went to BJs this past week with a few others and as usual they were packed but we were seated in about 20-25 mins. We ordered an appetizer and drinks right away. Our drinks came out and we ordered. We prob did not have the waiter come back to our table for a good 20 mins. Our appetizer came out and no one brought us appetizer plates. I kept seeing our waiter go to all of his other tables but not ours. We all wanted another drink and one of us asked for sweetener for his tea and the waiter still had not brought that out. I asked another waiter for it finally.  When we ordered one of us asked about the menu change. Apparently BJs has changed up their portions to make them smaller (which is fine by me) but when our food came out it was not good. It looked like it had been sitting for a while and was thrown on the plate. It did not taste much better either.  At that point we all wanted to leave (even though we had discussed getting desert beforehand). Unless I have to go to BJs for an event or bc a friend is dying to go, I prob will skip this place in the future."
Jill S.,"Roseville, CA",50,10,4,2.0,8/22/2015,"I'll start with the good. I love their huge selection of foods. It's great when you have a big group of people. And, I love the desserts. But, the service is terrible and the food will never impress me enough to make up for the service.   The service is slow and I've even had down right rude wait staff.  Especially if you ask about the food wait.  We've had the kids served long after we've finished eating and vice versa.  I will say the manager is accommodating when there is an issue.  The last three times we've been here we've had a problem and we have ended up with free desert to apologize for our inconvenience.  To clarify, I'm not a complainer in general, but when service is bad, the server is rude and our food is cold....that's my tipping point."
Nichole V.,"Sacramento, CA",365,247,115,4.0,7/3/2013,"One of the things I love about all BJ's, including this one, is they are a great summer place to go.  Their air conditioning is fantastic! The environment is always very clean and has a warm feel.  Lots of television screens if you are a sports fan.  There is a good sized bar area too with an unbelievable amount of beer selections.  They also have home brewed sodas which are delicious.   I have been here a couple times and the service is hit and miss.  I have gone where we have a great waitress/waiter and my glass never empties.  Then again I have gone and I can never find the waitress/waiter.  So, it's luck of the draw on that one.  It usually is crowded.  If you go on a weekend just be prepared to wait.  Weekdays though I get seated quickly.   There aren't a ton of healthy options besides salads.  I wouldn't call BJ's a vegan paradise, but there are a good amount of vegetarians options.   This is definitely a place to go for good beer or a cocktail.  The booths and tables are great for socializing as well.   They also have a fantastic take out system.  You can order quickly and get your food fast."
Scott R.,"Aurora, CO",77,10,4,4.0,4/14/2015,"Here on business, staying at the Courtyard up the street. Really wanted a steak so walked down here. Was more than pleasantly surprised by how great my steak was. I had the ribeye and an Estancia Cabernet (because you know, it's half off all Tuesday long) and it was one the best meals I've had so far. Richard took fantastic care of me with timely refills and spent-on recommendations. Not sure if my travels will bring me back to this area but if they do I'll be back. Kudos to Richard and BJs!"
Kat D.,"Meridian, ID",147,179,150,4.0,2/27/2014,"I have been here a couple of times. My first visit was with my husband and his best friend and his girlfriend to celebrate my hubby and his bff's birthdays.  We ordered the potato skins as an appetizer.  OMG!  Completely delicious.  My hubby and his Bff ordered a beer sampler that gave him 4 different kinds of beer.  They said it was yummy.  All of us ordered burgers for our meal.  They were pretty decent.  After our meal, the server brought out a chocolate chip pizookie nice and warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a lit candle.  It was very sweet.  The 2 birthday boys appreciated the waitress not singing and bringing a bunch of attention.  Lol."
Joshua K.,"Antelope, CA",1,13,3,4.0,1/22/2015,Always nice. Great for lunch endless soup and salad with a lovely brunette is  awesome .
Cindy S.,"Roseville, CA",3,13,,4.0,9/18/2015,"I really like this place.  Although the menu is larger than I want to read, they have food choices which are fresh and healthy.  I'd price it just on the high end of casual dining, but worth it for the fun decor and convenient location.  I tend to go a bit early for dinner so I miss the massive crowds -- and then they don't try to seat you in a small booth."
M C.,"Sacramento, CA",44,10,,1.0,8/12/2013,"The only thing that was quick in this place was the check. I was a fan of BJ's until I went to this Roseville location. I don't know what happened, but it seemed like the waiter ignored us. Not like the place was busy, because half of the tables were empty. We had to ask other waiters several times about where our waiter was. Our food came out cold, and drinks never got refilled. I wanted to tip a penny, but my sister in-law decided to leave 10%. I'm not saying that BJ's is a bad restaurant, but I'm saying that we had a bad experience at this one. Next time, we will make the drive to either Arden or Natomas."
Vivian P.,"Roseville, CA",166,299,90,1.0,9/18/2014,"We came here for lunch and it was truly a terrible experience! The food was okay - but the server was just horrible. So hubby and I came on a Monday I think for lunch - the restaurant was perhaps 1/4th packed and we continued to see our server helping the tables around us but very rarely coming to help us! We ended up doing the soup and salad for lunch - let's be honest, there's no cooking involved with either, should be fast dishes - but we waited about 15 minutes before he even took our order, and another 15-20 minutes before our food was brought out. We were about 3/4ths through our first round and wanted to order our 2nd, and tried to get his attention on several occasions but he ignored us! So finally after we were sitting about 5 minutes totally done, he came over. We placed another round, and again took 15 minutes to come out - and the 2nd round - the bowls and plates of food are 1/2 as small - so why it took so long, who knows! At this time we were done - and rather than staying - we just asked for the bill. Took another 20 minutes for the bill - seriously - ridiculous and our drinks NEVER got re-filled. For lunch - for 2 bowls of soup and 1 salad each, we were there for nearly an hour and a half - I WILL NEVER COME BACK! And - in terms of the food - the soups tasted like they came out of a can - not fresh or good tasting at all - the salads were good. I'd rather go to Olive Garden for soup - where you always know it's fresh."
Mike A.,"Anaheim, CA",308,30,6,1.0,11/13/2014,This Bj's is the worst Bj's I have ever been to. The service is consistently terrible. The average waiting time to get your food after you order here is 45 min. I timed it multiple times. The food is always semi warm when you get it. The order is usually wrong. U will be without refills for a long time. The hosts is the best thing at this restaurant.  I now drive to the Arden or the Folsom BJ's which is adding 15-20 to my commute. But there I get great service. I will never come to this BJ's again.
Andrea W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,2.0,3/25/2016,"Asparagus and shrimp penne. Noodles were undercooked. Not the worst part. Waited 1 hour for uncooked pasta to arrive. 30 minutes to be seated which is fine if the food was worth it. The excuse for the hour wait for entrees was ""something happened in the back"". When we asked for the check I politely said what was wrong with the dish (uneaten) and that I would not pay for it. Manager said ok I'll fix that for you on the check but no apology. Friday night 9-10:45. We got our food at 10:30 and didn't even eat, took it to go because we were so tired. Customer service could very much approve along with food quality."
Bj D.,"San Francisco, CA",31,10,,1.0,4/19/2016,"We love BJs in Tucson, the best, so looked forward to the one in Roseville. The margarita was undrinkable, the food arrived cold. They forgot to bring the birthday cake, and we waited 20 minutes to get the bill paid. We won't be back."
Christina C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",62,76,50,5.0,2/16/2015,"Ready to have your mind blown? Two words: BJ's delivers. *dramatic pause for effect* Whaaaaaaat?! I work at a restaurant across the way and live by the sunrise mall, so going out to Roseville on my day off for food didn't sound fun. So after looking at their yelp page, I saw the delivery option. Major score!!! Our food was here in about an hour from order time to actually getting in our door. Not bad! We got a full meal for two for about $55 with delivery cost ($4.95) and tip. Such a cool option to have!!!"
Melanie M.,"Auburn, CA",3,65,3,3.0,3/6/2015,"I love the pazookie. I've frequented here many times. Each time is meh. Flavors are OK, but nothing spectacular. Service is decent, but beware busy nights in the seat-yourself bar section. My table was completely overlooked once. Everyone around us kept getting served but us. I usually get one drink, but it's never the same. The same drink has come to me many ways, many of which weren't so good. The quality always varies."
