Melissa R.,"Greenfield, CA",6,42,29,5.0,4/25/2015,Excited to celebrate Jeremiah Roller's 33rd birthday & Kevin& Donna Davis's anniversary.  Yani our waiter was awesome.  The manager got us drinks and appetizers because it was super busy due to prom.  Great service.  Great food.  Great company
Gladys G.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/17/2015,"Very comfortable, clean, modern location and not too loud for a busy place. Definitely not a dive. The parking is in the rear and it is awkward to find the front door. Don't confuse it with the take-out door. We stopped in for lunch on a Thursday.  I had the Calamari appetizer which was a little oily but very tender and good. My husband was very happy with his Seared Ahi Tuna salad. Our food arrived promptly. Tea refills right on time. We are definitely going to try a burger next time because all of them looked Great as they were going by.  It was pretty empty when we arrived but It did become crowded but never chaotic or loud. All ages welcomed. Bathrooms were very modern and clean. The service was super, fast, friendly and professional."
Joy J.,"Northern California, CA",241,337,79,4.0,12/27/2014,"Good food.  Good service.  The menu is incredibly long and filled with many wonderful selections!  The ONLY thing I dislike is the NOISE, but this is part of all their restaurants....so you just have to expect and accept it!  We do recommend it!"
Scott K.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/31/2013,"We've been coming here regularly for several years. Lately we have been coming to realize that this restaurant is perpetually understaffed. Waiting for tables when the restaurant is half full just before dinner hour or just after lunch. Wait staff running around frantic durring peak times, as there is minimal assistance from runners and the kitchen nearly always forgets side items.  Service is often poor, there are a few gems, mainly those who will get the side or extra items from the kitchen themselves before the food arrives.  To top it off, the managers at this restaurant clearly don't care about your business. If a meal comes out wrong expect to wait for another from the kitchen. 15 minutes for drinks, your problem... I've never been comped anything here after 5+ encounters where their competition would have comped an appetizer or dessert. The place is always full, why should they care I guess?? The food is usually good and typical for mid-high chain fair. Their couples specials are great when offered, $20 for 2 apps, pizza and cookie pizza is great! The new $30 with 2 meals in place of the pizza is good too. Just prepare for the service punishment when you arrive... At least the beer is good to drown your sorrows..."
Allison D.,"Roseville, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/2/2016,This place is awesome.  Aside from the poor service the food was awesome.   We both had pizzas.  Very delicious.  A little spendy but worth it .
Tom S.,"Kenwood, CA",267,1646,853,2.0,6/18/2011,"Big, too noisy, too crowded, too hectic. Beer is okay.  Food sucks.  Poor prep, worse than amateur cooking technique,  sloppy plate presentation,  frozen food ingredient flavors. This is dead, grey food that should be buried rather than eaten. Service is friendly but inept. Wrong orders delivered, dropped plates, etc.  Pitiful. Claim Jumper is the same mass production corporate family friendly restaurant formula with better food, faster service and more tolerable ambience.  Claim Jumper is 1.5 miles down the road, go there instead."
Haidar J.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/26/2016,My family&I been customers of BJs for along time. But the last 3 visits been horrible service is very slow food comes out cold the only time server is kind and nice and polite is when they hand you your check. We have decided not to step foot in that place again..
D S.,"Lincoln, CA",1,5,,1.0,6/14/2016,"My family and I arrived @ 8:43pm, and we were seated @ 8:50pm. We ordered drinks and took a moment to look over the menu. Our waiter returned shortly and we placed our order. My son was happy to hear that he was able to get a free Pizookie if my fianc'e or I ordered a meal valued at $9.99 or more, which was a given. We ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and the Jambalaya Dish with Pasta instead of Rice with NO bell peppers. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken arrived @ 9:45pm, and the Jambalaya Dish arrived with both bell peppers and rice so it was returned. I decided to keep it simple and NOT order the same menu item, instead l opted for the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I watched my family eat their meal as l waited for an additional 20 minutes. The manager came over and gave a half ass apology, and seemed to be more concerned with the vegetables that were on my plate. The manager made NO attempt to accommodate us what so ever. This is the poorest service l have ever received here, and l conduct business lunches here often. l had plans to meet some vendors here next week on business, well that's not going to happen. What ever happened to taking care of the customer? poor customer service is unacceptable. I remember my mentor telling me that customers is like Dental care, if you take care of your teeth they will be around for a long time, if you don't they will go away."
Kati C.,"North Highlands, CA",26,96,19,1.0,11/30/2015,this place is horrible and I usually love this (well the one in folsom or arden mall) ordered a buffalo chicken pizza....they barely put any chicken on it and tried to make big chunks of uncut onions make up for the absent chicken it was pathetic. got the sampler platter and they artichoke spinach dip was grainy and tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp for like an hour! made me instantly sick after just one bite! thankfully the manager comped it all but still just a poor showing on the chefs parts....
Rachel B.,"Rocklin, CA",1,32,5,3.0,10/22/2014,"Good customer service, large restaurant that is very chilly inside. I would bring a jacket. Nothing amazing about this place unless your hungry at night time and every other place is closed. Food is way over priced. I only come here when my friends want too besides that I never choose to come here."
AuburnChicki E.,"Auburn, CA",42,59,3,2.0,12/21/2014,"great happy hour food and drinks.What I expect at discount prices is discount food and service. They do about two steps above that..which is actually pretty good for a cheap ass like the company I keep.. For a real meal, please, go elsewhere!! I was so appalled by my experiences that I would warn anyone from this place expecting a quality dining experience at any price. All I expected was a pizza to be pretty   when the manager was called to print me and extra receipt ..I said, this looks nothing like the online photos, his response was..so you want us to print another on or are you good?! With five people waiting behind me and five people waiting for the crap I had to deliver...I just signed on the dotted line and thanked gawd I had elsewhere to eat that night. :("
Jennifer S.,"Roseville, CA",641,207,2,4.0,10/20/2013,"A great place to come for happy hour, got 1/2 off a bottle of wine and shared a variety of appetizers.  The only negative thing is that sometimes the food takes a long time to come out."
Addison M.,"Sacramento, CA",1476,395,439,3.0,10/9/2013,Came here the other night and waited 15 minutes to get water and have the waiter introduce himself. I love this place but that is just too long to wait if you ask me.
Jim P.,"Lynnwood, WA",102,423,364,4.0,10/4/2013,"Great happy hour deals, Had the Octoberfest and slider special! Great deal, good service at the bar and tasty food. Will return again as it was a good place to dine alone."
Gwen M.,"Roseville, CA",94,18,5,5.0,1/3/2015,Good service and good prices.  It's difficult to find good service and a clean restaurant these days.  This BJ's does well in both those areas.  I'll be back soon!
Gerald A.,"Roseville, CA",11,174,2,3.0,8/8/2014,"This is our third time in a month visiting BJ'S and this time with a group of 8. The four women ordered chop salads and the guys got sandwiches nothing fancy. I had the pulled pork sandwich and asked to add bacon, it was delivered without. The server couldn't be less interested in doing her job than this girl. Lucky for us she went on break and we got a server. The food took week over an HR to come out. When I was there a few weeks back with only two of us same thing. For the price the food is decent but service had to improve or I may take my food dollars to other establishments in Roseville."
Samantha W.,"Lincoln, CA",1,15,2,2.0,10/4/2015,"Not to thrilled with this place. Went here for my Dad's birthday and the waiter gave us our food and didn't come back until our check came, didn't seem like he wanted to be there. We figured we would give it another try at the Folsom one, for my Mom's birthday service was the same and they didn't do anything for her birthday and my food was so dry and tough to cut through. Not impressed at all."
Terry B.,"Turlock, CA",0,35,9,2.0,4/18/2015,"Very slow with the service. Someone who was not our waiter came and took our order. Had to request a spoon and cheese for spaghetti. Marinara sauce was good my wife said. Must have been just a bad day at the restraunt. Usually one bad experience doesn't totally keep us from returning but 2 does. They have one mor chance. BTW, 3 stars is just average service."
Robin G.,"Roseville, CA",134,17,3,5.0,1/13/2014,"Katrina P. was our server on Friday night at BJ's. Why do I mention this 1st? Because SHE is flat out FABULOUS! We've eaten at BJ's many times. The food is good. The atmosphere is good. The prices are good. But, nothing really encourages us to come back frequently. However....Katrina P. was friendly, on the ball and obviously enjoys the guests she is serving.  My husband is a picky eater; and has several food allergies. She made note of all of them and never blinked or grimaced at his strange requests.  I wanted a special drink --- her bartender wasn't familiar with it; but Katrina found out the ingredients and had it made. FABULOUS!  We'll be back more often."
Dina U.,"Antelope, CA",37,24,7,4.0,11/22/2014,"Celebrated a 50th birthday with a group of 12.  Made a reservation in advance and upon arrival, everything was ready. Also kept cake in refrigerator until we were ready for it. Service for a our group was the best! Ashley did an amazing job from allowing separate checks to getting every order correct and never had to wait long for drinks or anything else! Thanks for making this celebration with friends so amazing through good food and great service!!!"
