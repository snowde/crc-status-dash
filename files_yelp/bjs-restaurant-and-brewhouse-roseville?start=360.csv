Laura M.,"Roseville, CA",62,7,,2.0,8/30/2014,The food was good but you never know what kind of service you're going to get. Terrible server tonight .
Paul Y.,"North Highlands, CA",62,83,54,5.0,8/10/2013,"Once again great Food and Service!!! Ate in the bar and had Pork Ribs and THE BEST CLAM CHOWDER!! We also had theFied Calamari which is awesome. We have had Calamari at a lot of places but it is the Best by far at BJ's,"
Langiie D.,"Roseville, CA",118,84,112,4.0,10/22/2014,"Vanessa, the bartender, I think that's her name, is a great girl. We came in 20 mins before closing and she welcomed us with open arms. Made conversation while we waited for our drinks and food. She gave us fantastic service."
Daphne J.,"Rocklin, CA",4,20,9,3.0,12/22/2014,"I came here for lunch with my girlfriend and had the Peach Sangria drink and it was very good. For lunch I had the Chargrilled Mahi Mahi tacos and onion strings. The taco was just okay. I had better. The onion strings were okay, but much rather have had onion rings, which BJ's did not have on the menu. Overall, I found the found to be okay.  The environment was as expected for lunch, busy. Our server was attentive and checked on us twice. Food there is hit and miss. Today it was miss. I come here for the variety of food, the social atmosphere and of course the TV's and being able to catch the sports"
Megan P.,"Roseville, CA",1,10,4,1.0,5/28/2014,"me and my boyfriend went here for lunch and the whole experience was terrible. It wasn't crowded and our waiter was taking forever to take our order. we had to ask 4 different waiters for our refills and the 4th one finally got it after we asked him twice. The chef ran out speaking a different language and shoved our plates onto our table and our burgers were completely mediocre. My patty was thin and half of it was burnt off, I had one shriveled bacon strip that was cut in half. my boyfriends burger wasn't any better. we sent it back, paid for our drinks and left. my family used to come here with 10-12 people at least once and month and we haven't gone back since. service is terrible."
Rosie M.,"Henderson, NV",34,28,4,3.0,9/20/2012,"We were in town staying for a night and needed some late dinner so we decided to stop in at BJ's. We're from Vegas so the BJ's by our house is fantastic.  For appetizers, we ordered the watermelon and feta salad which was to die for and the chicken potstickers which are always fantastic.  Sad to say but I was not satisfied at all with my meal. I had the mahi mahi tacos and they lacked in flavor tremendously. I only ate one of my tacos and didn't even want to eat the other one. I also had the peach margarita which was way too sweet. I had to put extra water in it to tame it a bit. I didn't end up finishing it either.  Our waitress was very friendly and efficient but the kitchen was soooo slow. We waited like an hour for our food and the restaurant was not packed at all."
Ted P.,"Sacramento, CA",59,18,12,4.0,8/21/2013,"This BJ's is like every other BJ's. The service is pretty good. I've never had any real problems here. The food and drinks taste like any other BJ's. BUT one time, during lunch, I ordered a crispy calamari and they forgot it. I just asked them to take it off the bill. Also, I came here for happy hour one time and the bar area was full, so they were nice enough to accommodate our large party in the regular dining area and still gave us happy hour prices."
Iona L.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",2,5,1,1.0,6/25/2016,"BJ's is always one of our favorite easy dinners but this is the first time it felt like the chain restaurant that it is. We ordered two black and blue burgers and some shrimp tacos and all three had some issues. My moms bun was totally burned and only had half of the burger patty on it. My burger had the same issue with the patty and although my bun was overlooked, it wasn't nearly as bad as my moms. The manager came over and apologized but didn't do anything about it. The shrimp tacos were supposed to be one blackened and one grilled but my dad couldn't tell the difference. He said they were ""alright"" but nothing intriguing. We have never had a problem before and were just so disappointed about this last visit. The beers are good as always and I can really recommend the hefe. Just so upset about the food. I really hope they turn this around and not act like a chain restaurant with cheap and unworthy food. Not sure if we will give it another shot."
Liz D.,"Sacramento, CA",109,417,50,5.0,5/8/2013,"I was in Roseville last month celebrating my nephew's 12th birthday.  We as a family of 9 went to BJ's for an early dinner.  Matt was our server.  He was awesome, very attentive and on it at all times.  I can see where it can be difficult handling large parties but Matt was exceptionally awesome.  He even changed the TV to the Sharks hockey game for us to watch while we dined.  Great service, good food."
Terry M.,"Redding, CA",0,19,7,1.0,11/27/2014,"Been calling for some time on thanksgiving, no answer. At least post your hours on line on this day or leave a proper recording."
Brittany G.,"Aurora, CO",0,5,1,1.0,1/30/2016,Horrible service and the excuse was we had a big party in the other room.  The manager is very inexperienced and should be in a lower position.  We were here waiting on a simple desert that took 40 min. Not to mention the food took forever as well. Got to love a 3 hour dinner in a bar. Go else where people!
Brandon M.,"Sacramento, CA",188,190,14,4.0,6/9/2013,"This specific spot is a great one. The staff was really friendly to our party of 20, though the manager was keeping a close eye. The manager was quick to notice our grandma only had an appetizer and the guest of honor sent her food back. The food had a single hair in it, pretty gross, but when it was fixed in a blink of an eye it's hard to complain. She was offered a comp'd dessert. We had a great time and wouldn't hesitate to go back. I do hope they get mints soon, the flavored tooth picks were not a good substitute."
John M.,"Folsom, CA",0,45,,3.0,2/18/2016,"The lunch menu is great. Great avocado egg rolls, flatbread pizza, wedge salad"
Clancy C.,"Orangevale, CA",1,27,7,2.0,5/2/2014,"This place sucks dick. Reservations at 830 didn't get out of the place till 11:15. Service sucked so much ass. We had three different servers switch on us. You would think it woulda been managed a lot better on a Friday night. Beer was good as always. Pizza was horrible, patato skins tasted like nothin but grease. Thanks for the fucking diarrhea. Everybody else I was with sayed their food was shitty. I'm not super picky about places but this was by far the worst experince I've ever had. Enjoy a big steamy pile of cock bjs."
Robin R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2015,Went to BJs tonight!  Worst service ever. After 4 servers walked by us and then took the order of another table that came in 15 minutes after us we walked out went to Yard House and got immediate great service.
Andres N.,"Sacramento, CA",6,2,,1.0,5/30/2015,Tonight we went to this BJs restaurant and it was for my Girlfriend birthday. Just a simple birthday night out for her birthday! It was going all good until our food came out. We had our main entree before we had our flatbread appetizer. Which was extreme Pepperoni flat bread. I would rather have my appetizer before main entree. That is why it's called an appetizer. Which Sally B our waitress didn't deliver it to us but gave us our main meal. When we were eating our appetizer came from a different waitress and it was awkward because I just told Sally B that I did not want it anymore and still shows up on our table. I am glad that she asked to remove it from our bill. But my girlfriend best friend had a burger there and the options were if she wanted cheese or bacon? And she said bacon. Because she is lactose. We get the burger and it has cheese on it and she sat there couple mins scrapping off the cheese that she did not want. Sally B then ask if we wanted anything else. And my girlfriend and her friend requested ranch and ketchup. 20 mins later after reminding her she finally got them. This is the worst service that I have seen at any BJs restaurant.
J.R. C.,"Lincoln, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/3/2015,"Ive been here twice, the first time my plate was delivered at the same time the folks I dined there with were having their's boxed up to go. Nobody seemed bothered by this,  no discount was given dispite the fact I was not able to eat with the folks I was there with. This time I waited 20 mins after seating to order a drink, and 40 mins for a bowl of soup! I wish I had better things to say because I LOVE the BJ's in the bay area. Major bummer."
Alexa G.,"Carmichael, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/9/2015,On Saturday night I was having a terrible night and went to BJs for a delish dinner. My servers name was Amber and she turned my night around. She was incredible. Wish more food industry workers were like her. I will be back!!!
Ally G.,"Sacramento, CA",17,54,,1.0,3/29/2014,The boyfriend and I were stuck in Roseville and stopped off at BJ's because it was the closest thing around.  We both ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya after our waiter raved about it. Bad move. Not sure if it was the cook's first day but our entrees tasted like someone had dumped a can of cayenne in each dish. Both the bf and I love spicy food but this was positively inedible. We would have sent it back but our waiter never came back around. We left the food on the table and paid up front.  What a waste.
Lissette R.,"Roseville, CA",21,13,,2.0,6/23/2016,"My family and I went there for a family celebration. My son ordered the onion rings. What we expected where large onion rings, what we received were these skinny, spaghetti looking onion strips that were similar to what you put on a Thanksgiving green bean casserole. I had to use a fork to pick these up. My husband ordered a beef dish which came with a baked potato and asparagus. For some reason they put all this food on a plate so small that the asparagus hung from the side of the plate on to the table and the meat was so small, about a 2"" by 4"" piece. I'm thinking the reason for the small plate was to make the meat look bigger. We asked the waiter for a larger plate as it looked like his food might fall on the table. The waiter just brought us another place of the same size for my husband to divide his food onto to plates. Ridiculous!  My daughter ordered the macaroni and cheese. It was so dry with very little cheese sauce. I could have made a better version of it at home. I was disappointed by the overall quality of the food, specially at those prices. I hadn't been to BJ's in a very long time and am not planing to go back any time soon."
