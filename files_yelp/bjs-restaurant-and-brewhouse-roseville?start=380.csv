Kenneth C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/2/2014,"Dear lord this is the slowest place ever. This place in comparison to other places is like AOL 2.0 in 1998 and AT&T high speed service in 2014.  I came here with a party of 12 for a birthday. We didn't have a reservation and knew we would have to wait a bit so no issues there. After being sat it was almost 15 minutes to be greeted and after drink orders another 10ish to get them out. So almost 30 minutes after seating we don't even have food orders in. It took just under an hour to get appetizers out to the table and about an hour and 15 minutes to get entrees, absolutely ridiculous.  Servers were friendly except they moved at a snails pace with no real drive or urgency.  If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  There were 2 factors that were positive for my visit: 1st-the red velvet and the cookies & cream  pizookie. Both were fantastic. 2nd- the Irish rootbeer, great suggestion by our server (her name escapes me). Was a damn good drink"
Cindy L.,"Roseville, CA",2,11,1,5.0,2/19/2015,"Great place! This place has a meal option for almost any taste. I personally recommend you try one of their soups, or chili. If you become a regular, try the membership option, it save you some in the long run, and the online ""order ahead"" and ""pay via phone"" options are very convenient. Additionally the members club app lets you get on a priority wait list that has saved us from waiting too long on popular days."
Barbara S.,"Sacramento, CA",173,106,16,2.0,5/28/2012,"I preferred BJ's when I lived in Southern California and it only had a few items on their menu. The menu has gotten too large, and the service is typically not very great. The last time I came here, the table we were seated at hadn't even been completely bussed yet, and we had to wait almost 10 minutes for someone to come over and clean it. I would have rather waited in the lobby for our table to be readied. I also feel like EVERY TIME I come to BJ's, I start out with one server, but rarely finish my meal with that same server. Typically, ten minutes into the meal, a new server is introduced so that mine can go on lunch. Why did they assign this table to that person in the first place, then? Just assign it to someone else. If you're running such a tight ship with your lunch schedule, then shouldn't you have anticipated this? It really irks me. This nearly always results in a forgotten order, drink or otherwise. It's just bad service. There are some dishes I enjoy here, and I like the bar area for watching sports. I just don't count on the service."
Patrick N.,"Roseville, CA",169,189,26,5.0,4/16/2014,"The service here is always on point, they always seem happy and attentive... The food is always cohesive and delicious. Potato skins, avocado egg rolls, and their deep dish pizza are great! Brandon our server was on point."
Rebecca F.,"Roseville, CA",83,99,14,5.0,6/8/2013,Yum!! .) Great flatbread pizza! .) Soooo yummy! .) So yuuuuummmmy! .) Such good food!
Kriss R.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/2/2015,Over the years we have enjoyed BJ's food was good no matter what you ordered. Now they've taken several things off the menu not for the better...Today we were in and I had a beacon cheese burger. Don't know why they asked my how I wanted it done because it came out well (ordered medium) beef is so lean now there is no flavor and it is dense. Wedge fries were warmed and greasy. Service was very slow never did come to ask if we wanted refills. SCREAMING kids...More than one or two. Absolutely piercing. Everything now is over priced for what your getting. Really my husband had a $15.00 salad...You've got to be kidding...for these prices I would rather go to one of the major dinner houses...So how is this minimum wage hike working for everyone...We use to go twice a week.. Now we won't be back
Anna M.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,1,,1.0,1/2/2016,"I have been a customer of BJs for years and I have I never had such a subpar and burnt meal. Out of a group of five, four of the delivered meals were awful. Two steaks were burnt, the ribs were so dry they were crispy, the baked ziti was basically cheap mac n' cheese, and the mahi mahi was so small it seemed as if they had cut a full size portion in half. Now keep in mind that the waitress was incredibly nice and tried to help us with our 2 star dinner, but the kitchen was a disaster. And we weren't the only table with problems. I have never been in a restaurant and seen an additional three tables send food back and request to speak with the restaurant manager. Basically, if you go for the beer you will have a great experience. If you are looking for a good dinner, choose another restaurant because you will be severely disappointed with the quality of food and the standards of the kitchen. Go elsewhere!"
Madeleine D.,"Roseville, CA",33,112,5,2.0,3/16/2012,"What has happened to BJ's? I've been to BJ's more times than I can count now.  I work right in the area and tend to go after work for a beer or some appetizers, and I used to really enjoy it.  But now it just seems like the service has gone completely downhill. Last night two of my coworkers and I decided to go out to eat after our shifts, and the first choice was BJ's.  It was Happy Hour and the hostess told us we could go choose anywhere to sit.  Originally when our waitress finally came over it took a good five minutes to get menus and a couple more minutes just for water.  My coworker ordered a mojito and I ordered a beer.  It took another five minutes for those drinks to arrive.  Finally, the waitress asked us for our appetizer orders which took nearly 15 minutes to arrive.  Keep in mind these were the mini-bites appetizers.. Quite a while to wait for a teeny-tiny appetizer that's fried. When she dropped off our appetizers, I wanted to try my coworker's fried artichoke appetizer.  I asked her before I bit in if it was hot and she replied, ""No. Not at all... Not hot. At all!""  I had ordered the mini meat balls and mine were not hot either, just slightly warm.  Not great. Finally we ordered and waited quite a while for our meals which were not impressive either.  We asked our waitress to refill our waters at one point and she acted very irritated at the request.  We also asked her to split our checks because the three of us were paying with separate cards and she literally took a deep, drawn out breath and seemed like she was extremely upset by this request.  My coworkers and I looked at each other and didn't know what to say.  One coworker quickly said, ""I'm sorry! If that's not okay..."" The waitress responded, ""No. It's fineee..."" *Another deep sigh*. The three of us didn't really know how to respond to her attitude.  She seemed to think that she was doing us some great favor by refilling our waters and the simple task of splitting the bill.  I'm almost tempted to not go back considering this is pretty typical of most of the service I've received here lately.  Last time I went to BJ's a friend and I ordered two beers and waited 25 minutes.  After that wait we decided not to eat there, and it took another half hour to get our check, pay and leave.   BJ's - your food isn't great, so you might as well do some extra service training to make up that deficit."
Vince R.,"Auburn, CA",0,429,19,2.0,5/8/2014,We had the Calamari and boneless chicken wings. Sent the Calamari back.. Tasteless and greasy. The chicken wings could have been any meat. Doughy and salt were the only things I could taste. Chicken McNuggets are so much better.
Affy L.,"Vancouver, Canada",21,58,10,4.0,8/9/2014,"One of our fav spots to go to. Love the food and the different varieties. Glad they have a ""healthy"" section. Great beer too! :)"
Philip I.,"Sacramento, CA",825,125,3906,4.0,2/23/2010,"A lot of people hate on BJ's, but I've never had a bad experience here yet. We come here for what it's known for: PIZZA and BEER.  Shotgun all the samplers and you'll feel like a million bucks.  Order our current favorite pizza, the Mediterranean, and you'll be lovin' life.  A small order is perfect for two people.  If you still have room left stuff your face with a nice warm Pizookie. The lettuce wraps and artichoke dip are also notable mentions appetizer-wise.  I'm not a big fan of the rest of their food so -1 star for that, but like I said people should come here for the PIZZA and BEER. This is my favorite of the restaurant chains (Chili's, Friday's, CPK, Cheesecake Factory, etc.); I love gettin' BJ's!"
Demetri P.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",518,14,5,5.0,10/25/2014,"Great service  I loved it great prices and good waiters, they don't serve coke products , so they went out and bought coke at the market just to satisfy me that's great service I love it they know what great service really is"
Andrey T.,"Antelope, CA",0,4,1,2.0,6/26/2016,I stop comming to this restaurant a long time ago because thier food quality has gotten pwrrty bad since they first came to Sacramento but since i got a gift card for my birthday i figured I'd give it another shot. After out visit i wish i traded the gift card in for cash. I ordered their stake and shrimp combo and wife ordered the Louisiana style jambalaya. Not sure how long the rice was cooked for but it would have made better sense to make mashed potatoes out of it and overall was a bit Bland definitely not worth $19. As for my plate the steak was okay once again the shrimp was a bit bland and perhaps my plate sat out for a bit because my steamed vegetables came cold and my mashed potatoes look like they add sad for a little while. It was quite a disappointing experience once we finished up the waitress asked to take a plates never ask how our food was or question the fact that my wife did not even touch her plate. The only reason I'm giving it 2 Stars is because I like their beer.
Bryan T.,"Roseville, CA",0,29,1,2.0,12/5/2015,So i get it everybody has a bad day and i'm sure being a bartender is a hard job but one of the bartenders there (Emily) seems to have a bad day every time we go in and i'm giving a extra star because ALL of the other bartenders there are great all of the time so if you go there and want to enjoy your time do not sit at the bar.
Kristina G.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/4/2014,"Went there for the first time and I was treated very well. My waitress was a very kind, funny, and sweet lady who made my visit very comfortable.  Highly recommended people to go here."
Kitt L.,"Roseville, CA",5,12,14,4.0,1/13/2015,Foods are fare and beers are great!  Service is quick.  Great place to hang out and watch sports close by the bar area with big screen TVs!
Sonny M.,"Roseville, CA",0,59,,2.0,9/7/2014,"Use to be a good place but went back after some time and was disappointed.  Fries seemed to be refried.  The pasta was as if i made it at home.  My kids smily fries had a grey color when they use to be yellow, so we didnt eat them.  MY burger was ok. Hopefully it was just a bad day for the items we chose.  Took  long time to get the food although it was very busy.   Rather go to cheesecake factory"
Jill B.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/7/2015,"Love this place, ate they last weekend when I was up in Sacramento visiting friends. Had the veggie pizza and it was amazing."
Ray B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",29,99,179,5.0,11/19/2010,"PIZOOKIE!!!  Need I say anything else? That has to be the coolest word ever!  PIzookie!  Pizookie!  Pizookie!!! On a quest for comfort food we tried the Pizookie Trio!  Our flavors were White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter, and Cookies 'N Cream...  Mmmmmmm! I try to be frugal handing out 5 stars but this place is one of my favorite restaurants.  Half of the north state must have the same feeling too because there's hardly a time when I haven't seen a line.  Fifteen to twenty minute waits are not uncommon. Can't wait until our next visit!"
Suzanne K.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,125,41,2.0,6/25/2014,"Will likely never return. The pizza was undercooked - it looked anemic when the server brought it to our table, and so I had it  baked a bit longer.  Even after it was baked again, the dough was still raw! My previous visits were pretty much the same. I gave this place a fair try. I used to love B.J.'s in Southern Ca (Westwood) but for some reason the pizza tastes completely different at this Roseville location. I must note that the manager and server were very nice and offered to comp our meal."
