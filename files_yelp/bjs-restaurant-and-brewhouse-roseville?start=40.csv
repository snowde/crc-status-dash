Christina T.,"North Highlands, CA",65,32,7,2.0,7/12/2017,"I usually have a good experience at ALL the BJ's restaurant I visit, but my experience at this location was just notably different. I was meeting a friend here to have dinner and catch up since. My friend doesn't get there till about 6 min after me and we sit and talk that we started noticing that our waiter hasn't come around for a long time since she came in. Possibly cause it's a Saturday night I suppose. We order a shrimp asparagus penne pasta and my friend orders a sirloin steak with a few cocktail drinks in the mean time. The drinks were delicious! I got a paradise mule and my friend got the Alabama sunset.  The penne I ordered was SUPER soggy. There was no asparagus (my favorite part :[ ) , and the sauce did not taste okay. Maybe it expired? Idk. It got to the point where I could not stand it anymore and I just stopped eating completely. I didn't want to make it a huge deal so I just tried to toughen it out bc our servers kept changing and at this point I barely saw them come by (it was about 11:30pm). My friend ordered her steak medium rare, but after a few bites she just thought it was dry overall and couldn't finish either. Bj's had a buy one get one free entree deal that was posted on their website specifically for that day. The waitress wasn't aware of that I guess and questioned us, but we just pulled up the deal on the website. No big deal. The service was meh, not too much help as other restaurant locations but still decent. Not going to be harsh cause it was a busy Saturday night. The cooking however was just not good that night. I'm afraid to trust this bj's location again though.  -3 stars for poorly cooked food :("

John C.,"Magalia, CA",12,35,4,4.0,6/14/2017,"We have been to this location several times and have always walked away enjoying their food.  Their avocado egg rolls are one of our favorite appetizers anywhere. We've had the same kind of dish at other places but it's never the same. From the crispy outside to the gooey delicious inside, the dipping sauce is amazing too! A must try. I've had their brisket burger and enjoyed it's size/flavor and a bit of a uniqueness. However I'm not the biggest on burgers from restaurants. But if you are give them smokey BBQ goodness a try. The Ahi tuna salad is the latest dish I've tried and loved. The freshness and flavor of the seared Ahi and the vinaigrette blend beautifully. They have little dots of wasabi on the side to help give it that extra delicious kick as well. My only issue is the overall size, was want just a tad bit more or something extra with it.  Finally the signature dish, the Pizookie. This dessert is pretty simple. A large fresh baked cookie in the still warm pan topped with ice cream. We typically get the salted Carmel one and it is to die for! It's just the right size for the wife & I to share after our meals. We have had some slightly slow service from the staff in the past, with either forgetting a to go box or drink refills. As well as receiving a dish without part of the dish(bacon was left out of a pasta dish)  so I have a few reasons to dock them one star. But the food is worth the slight issues."
Neeca B.,"Kansas City, MO",298,283,1338,3.0,9/25/2016,"The whole tribe went,  aunts, uncles,  kids, moms, dads, and  grandma.  It was hot,  sweating our tooshes off so we were stuck to our seats. We mentioned this to or waiter who whole heartedly agreed. He did say he would mention it again to the manager. Thing of it is though,  is that what grandma wants grandma gets and she wanted to eat here. So we settled in and ordered ice cold drinks.  We ordered what any tribe would have ordered, the whole menu.  The 3 appetizers that I'd order again were the guacamole, avocado egg rolls and the portabello fries. One thing I absolutely love about eating with my family is that we all are big on sharing.  It's a collective effort to decide what dishes we'll order,  and two that stuck out to me were the clam chowder bread bowl and the deep dish ravioli. Insanely delish.   Before I forget my drink was the berry cider although good was no comparison to the dark delish brew my sister ordered. Large selection and I was able to sip a few, tasty stuff.  Huge space,  but no outdoor patio.  Good staff,  large parking lot, decent menu but I'll have to go in the winter since they keep it so toasty."
Matthew S.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,1,5.0,12/29/2016,"I had such a great nighg tonight, thanks to my boy tristan! Literally the best server i have ever had! He made sure our table have such a great experience and everyone is raving about him! Not only was he super friendly, but he was such a great waiter and got everything out to us ASAP! IF YOU GOT TO BJS, PLEASE VISIT TRISTAN!"
Grace G.,"Roseville, CA",43,316,912,3.0,2/6/2016,"What can you say for a big ass chain restaurant that is one of the few places that serves late night food and beverages. This place is so so.  My husband is not a fan of this place at all, but it was late and our options are limited. The food is mostly high calorie. The food is ok. Nothing to scream home about. My martinis had ice them....hmmm....that was different. The fries came out somewhat cold.  Long story short, have no where else to go in Roseville? This place is edible and you can coach the bartender to make your drink just how you want it....yeah, a martini with no ice would be nice. Please and thank you."
Ralph G.,"Antelope, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/17/2017,"The quality of food was just OK. I ordered the Rib Eye steak that was supposed to be 14 ounces. It was maybe 5 inches in length and a tad over 1/2 an inch thick. No way was it 14 ounces. I remember thinking that I should have ordered the Sirloin. But the meal got off to a bad start when I got my salad and after 5 minutes my steak arrived. I hadn't finished my salad and now I have a choice - finish my salad and let my steak get cold, or finish my salad after my main meal. I chose the latter and ate my steak. But before I could finish my salad it was whisked away by an overzealous waitress. So, not a one star but definitely not a restaurant I will return to."
Lawrence L.,"Temple City, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2017,they service sucks here. i tried changing the game 3 times by the they changed it . it was over
Kim H.,"Rocklin, CA",61,105,31,3.0,3/19/2017,"BJ's was a favorite back when I lived in Elk Grove, we went often.  Since moving to Rocklin/Roseville 6 years ago, have avoided this location like the plague. Every time, long wait, and mediocre food. Tonight we came with a large group after a sporting event (that included several athletes exhausted from playing basketball all day.) We tried to do call ahead seating (I have BJ's PremiereRewards), can't do for parties over 6. So, we all arrived and learned another parent put our group name in, and we were already on the list. The place was PACKED. We were told about 45 minutes, we were actually seated in about 70/80. Great table, GREAT SERVER.  SHE is why I'm writing this.  The food was good, I had Quinoa Shrimp bowl (very good), the other 11 pretty much had pizza or burgers. No complains, food came out fairly quickly, she was at table often to check. Here's where this place WORKED for us, CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Ashley applied my $10 off $35 to each bill (split 3 ways.) This is why we'll come for dinner again, and just plan a bit more time into evening. Great job!"
Kathy C.,"Carmichael, CA",38,37,15,5.0,8/8/2017,"Had the mahi mahi tacos.  OMG they were delicious!  I don't remember BJ's being so good on my previous visits but maybe because the only one I have been to is the one in Natomas.  Will definately be back.  The staff were great, had quick service, the request for lemons was met quickly too."
Hannah R.,"Orangevale, CA",1,14,1,4.0,6/20/2017,"I would have rated 3 stars, because that the food was average but Richard was our server and his service was SO OUTSTANDING, I had to give him the extra star.  Our pitcher of beer was VERY flat, but at least out buffalo chicken pizza was great, as always. We tend to frequent this BJ's because it's close to our house and it's usually pretty hit or miss.   I really can't complain about this visit because Richard was so personable, attentive, professional, and more polite than any server I've had anywhere in a very long time."
John G.,"Antelope, CA",44,3,3,4.0,4/26/2017,I like this place so much the food is great the people are friendly the only downside is the wait time.  I wish it could be done quicker.
Rae S.,"Rocklin, CA",27,4,1,2.0,7/1/2016,"I ordered take out and for my sides I ordered fries and broccoli.. I literally only got two pieces of broccoli.... Come on guys, at least try to give reasonable portions on the vegtables"
Mindy G.,"Lincoln, CA",43,16,1,2.0,1/30/2017,"Whomever is managing this restaurant needs to get it under control. I have seen a significant decline in service over the last few months, and it's disappointing to say the least. My family met for dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant was busy, and we were not surprised to be quoted a 30-45 minute wait when we checked in (we had also used the online check-in system). We didn't get seated for over an hour and a half - twice the amount of time we were quoted. While we were waiting, we saw an old friend who was on his way out of the restaurant, and he warned us about the wait time. They were quoted the same 30-45 minutes, and their wait was closer to 90 minutes. Yikes.  Once we were seated, our server seemed a bit overwhelmed, but was doing an OK job. The food (the only saving grace) was good, but I agree that the portion sizing was off. I ordered the same Sirloin steak as another Yelper, and was surprised when it arrived because it was about half the size shown on the menu.  This restaurant has what it takes to be a 5-star establishment. But, they have got to get the front of the house in order. Months ago, I would have seen the manager out on the floor assisting staff and checking in with customers. On our last few trips, that person was nowhere to be seen."
Rashmi R.,"Roseville, CA",0,1,1,1.0,5/13/2017,"Had heard a lot about this place, but had a terrible experience here! We went in after 10pm, we were waited upon by Nick who told us that the happy hour from 10 was only valid at the bar. He treated us very coldly after that and brought our mini deep dish pizza and side of fries well after half hour of placing an order. Besides, the fries were cold upon arrival which means they were probably ready a long time ago. He did not even ask us again if we wanted a refill of our drinks! So much for a brewery!!! Overall, it was a very misleading signboard for happy hour and a below average waiter who destroyed our experience here. Wouldn't wanna go back."
Dawn M B.,"Sacramento, CA",53,15,433,5.0,3/31/2017,"'O'-mazing!!! Artichoke dip, lettuce wraps, pizza, salads, and the 3 pazooki dessert?!? Soooo good!  Had an amazing time!"
Dan K.,"Roseville, CA",128,171,35,2.0,7/1/2016,"I've been to this place once, which was enough. It's not quite as good as the Arden location, but still ok. The service isn't the best, pretty forgetful of what the table actually wants and orders.  The food is inconsistent and isn't quite up to par, to their other location, but when they remember your table, they're decent and friendly.  I have a pretty high expectation and this place felt a bit short of it, by a few stars, 3 to be exact. It's not horrible, but I definitely would only go here if there's more than two votes and majority wins."
Matthew C.,"Grass Valley, CA",3,5,,1.0,6/17/2017,"5 of the 7 dishes that came out were cold. BJs used to be a place to go for a great meal and great brews. No longer. None of the people I was with were happy with their meal. I'm sure it wasn't the waiter or waitresses fault, the service was great but this experience with the meal was highly disappointing."
Stephen D.,"Orem, UT",105,8,,4.0,3/19/2017,"This was my first time at BJ's. I would recommend it based on my experience there. I was seated pretty quickly. My waitress was friendly. The only downside is that the table was dirty when I was seated. For example, there were used napkins stuffed into the seat cushions.  I ordered the salted caramel pizooki and it was delicious!"
Ria R.,"Roseville, CA",0,18,,3.0,9/5/2017,"I've been invited to eat here a few times and the food is your basic average american fare. I am giving it three stars though because last time I was there, I ordered the ahi tuna salad and it was the bomb! I may have to go back on my own to order it again."
