Libralove L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,56,2,2.0,5/29/2014,Every time I go here they mess up my order in some way. Even really easy things like ordering dressing on the side of a salad. This has happened to me at most bjs though so it might have to do with how the orders are put in.  The food takes forever to come out and is always mediocre no matter what I try. The last time I had the flatbread and it took forever and looked like something that you could find in the frozen food aisle of the grocery store. One time my friend and I waited 45 minutes for a dessert when they were extremely slow. They credited us the dessert but who cares about $5 when they're wasting your precious time? I would honestly skip this place and go somewhere else.
Marissa J.,"South San Francisco, CA",28,111,39,5.0,2/28/2014,Roseville BJs is the best BJs I've been to. Roseann was our waitress she is one of the best ones there!
Ann G.,"Rocklin, CA",0,30,3,1.0,9/25/2015,"Came for dinner at 545 on a Thurs night. It took about 2 min to be seated. It was not crowded but the hostess led us to a table in a large area right next to the only other diners and it seemed awkward so we asked to move to a table farther away. She sat us at a farther table and left to tell the server. Well the server never came, no one came, no water, nothing. While waiting an ant crawled across the table and after about ten minutes we just left. Will not be back."
Bob M.,"Sacramento, CA",231,67,43,5.0,11/24/2012,"Its a love / hate relationship with BJ's ..... food is always good, , place is always packed.... 15 min wait to get seated,  best ribs..... many times the either ran out of ribs, soup, or the dessert i really want, but they more than make up for it by not charging you for (beer) drinks all night........ one time i got seated and 45 min later, they forgot about me completely  I got the manager , and the night was on the house!   great place, but too many people there to get 1 on 1 service, and they run out of food!"
Me M.,"Sacramento, CA",4,102,57,4.0,7/13/2014,"Yay!! Update! Something has definitely changed, not sure what, but our last visit here was great! Great service, great food..."
Jeremy H.,"Sacramento, CA",23,3,,3.0,11/3/2015,a.soupe spoon for my coffee and out of a1 sauce but the burger was good and service was great
Amanda B.,"Antelope, CA",28,39,8,1.0,1/11/2012,I've had food here and drinks and everything's good. but one night my boyfriend and I decided to come here to eat and I called to see how long the wait was and if they did reservations. they have a call ahead list so you'll be on the list and when you get there they will shorten the wait time. but not in our case. I called they said the wait was 25 minutes and when we got there we would wait 5 more minutes to get seated.  we got to the restaurant and made our way to the hostess who ignored my boyfriend and helped a guy who walked up after us...when we finally were helped she said the wait would be 25 to 30 minutes. I told her we called ahead and she had nothing to say. so we decided to wait outside..and smashburger was looking better and better so we left. don't call ahead it's a joke. the foods good from past experiences but i would stay away on busy nights.
Chris O.,"San Francisco, CA",8,11,,3.0,8/9/2014,"I have always liked the good food and drinks at bjs but the location is hit or miss with the service. We either have a great time with quick service and a friendly waiter, or come across staff that seems to always have something better to do. Good for larger parties though"
Marie N.,"Sacramento, CA",317,272,129,4.0,12/2/2011,"The Angel Hair Toscana was f'ng amazing!  I added the Cajun shrimp option, sooo good.  It literally looked like a pound of pasta in my bowl and the leftovers fed me for two more days.  The only thing I had to correct about the dish was that they didn't give me nearly enough feta and I loooove me some feta. Other items ordered (to share) were fried artichokes (TASTY), and buffalo chicken won tons.  I was a bit leery about the buffalo sauce in a won ton, but surprisingly they were pretty tasty.   We had great service too: our waitress was very friendly and fast on her feet with refills and such.   I'd love to go back!"
Trevor R.,"Rocklin, CA",5,21,4,2.0,6/22/2014,"Very nice atmosphere and decor, lots of TVs, full bar.  However the service was very slow, after we were seated it was another 15 minutes before anyone took a drink order, and the food left alot to be desired.  Our party ordered pizza and pasta, the pizza was good but the pasta was extremely dry and the bread was hard. The food and the service is not worth what they are charging, will not come back"
Samara T.,"Sacramento, CA",10,75,11,5.0,11/30/2012,"Thank you so much ! My aunt and  myself  recently  met for dinner there. We both werent very hungry so we ordered tortilla soup and wine .  I recently had gone thru chemotherapy so I didn't have an appetite and she has been dealing with very hard times. We sat and talked for about 4 hrs and never were made to feel rushed or that we were taking up a table when the restaurant had filled up around us. GREAT FOOD SERVICE, PRICES REALLY REASONABLE!  TRY THEM OUT. THANK YOU TO WAITRESS AND MANAGER FOR ALLOWING US TO SIT AND CHAT ABOUT SOME REALLY TOUGH THINGS."
Mike S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",32,49,1,1.0,3/31/2014,This place sucks! The food and service sucks. Sat 15 minutes before anyone came over and I had to ask the front desk who was our server. She took a order from a table that sat after us. No water came until after my salad was served. The top sirloin was too peppery and tough. The veggies were barley cooked...very crunchy. Coffee was served after my ice cream. Are you freaking kidding me! I have been to BJ's before in Santa Rosa and the food and service was 100% better than this place. Train your freaking servers about customer service. Will not return ever! If I could I would give you a negative number of 10
Christina M.,"Roseville, CA",36,16,13,2.0,7/21/2015,"So after a LONG day at the State Fair we wanted something good to eat.  My sister decided on BJ's.  We were seated within 2 minutes of arriving as it wasn't busy.   We waited over 15 minutes for our server to take our drink order.  Our drinks, a child's lemonade,  2 beers and a peachberry ice tea took an additional 20 minutes to get to the table after we ordered.  Our server took our order.  We waited 45 minutes for our food, only to be told they dropped my moms pizza so they were making her a new one.  As the rest of us were finishing our meals her ""new"" pizza arrived. (35 minutes later)  Our waiter did not check on us once during our meal.  The manager was very apologetic about the mishap but didn't offer to take it off the bill or discount it for her.  It wasn't very busy when we were there, so I can't/don't understand the crappy service we received!!  Very disappointed to say the least!!!!!"
Cambi M.,"Rocklin, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/23/2014,"This is one of my favorites places. I try to go at certain times to avoid the rush. Their honey mustard, skinny fries, & fried artichoke hearts are the BEST! The staff are always friendly & helpful with recommendations. The restaurant & bathrooms are very clean."
Nicole O.,"Rocklin, CA",35,6,,5.0,11/20/2014,"Great service!!! Our server Fred M was on top of it! There was never a dull moment during our dinner...he always was there...asking if we needed anything, asking how the food was and etc. He is quick but made sure he delivered us quality food! Thank you! You deserve a raise!"
J C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",60,112,75,4.0,4/2/2013,"I've been several times.  Good food and service.  Large menu, pizza is great.  I have to say they were having an 'off' night the last time we were there.  The manager visited our table and apologized for the poor experience.  So I won't let this one time keep me from going back."
Monu K.,"Rocklin, CA",373,61,189,2.0,10/2/2011,"Lots of reviews here so I'll try and use a grading scale for this review.   Service:  D+ After coming here a few times, I've had a mixture of mostly shitty service and a few times when the service was OK.   Appetizers:  B They are good, but overpriced.   Booze:  B Pretty good selection of beers, just wish they were a little cheaper.   Meals:  C-   If you are just looking for a meal... go elsewhere.   Atmosphere:  B+ Nice place for a date if you can't think of anything.  People seem to shout out BJ's as a default ""safe"" place to go.   With all that said, I would never go to BJ's on my own will.  Whenever I end up there it is because someone else has made plans there."
Brian M.,"Roseville, CA",8,21,4,5.0,8/10/2014,"Portions are great, and the food is delicious. If you still have the appetite after your huge meal, you MUST order the bazookie cookie dessert. My wife and I never order dessert at any restaurants.....except for here. This is the place we always order dessert because it is just that good!"
Christina D.,"Citrus Heights, CA",6,80,,2.0,3/18/2014,"This pretty much sums up that more than one location are the same. I recently saw their commercial with a family enjoying themselves and it was a joke. It takes an hour to get an entree and there is a big chance one of the table orders will be wrong or not even submitted by the server. I took my daughter here before a theater show and not only did everything take a very long time, I was forced to rush my meal because it came 20 min. after my daughters kid meal which took 45 min. to be served.  You need to eat a snack before going and include a lot of waiting even if it is a burger entree and kids meal.  I had to take my fries to go!"
CeCe C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",18,3,,1.0,10/7/2011,I normally LOVE coming in to eat here.......   I called in for Call ahead seating and asked how long.... they answered 40mins... I was like Perfect... we are 35mins away..... When we arrived they said it would be 20 more mins.... then after 20 mins.... they came back with well about 15 mins more....  UMMMMM I think NOT... Sorry we went next door to Smash Burger and had a GREAT DINNER instead....
