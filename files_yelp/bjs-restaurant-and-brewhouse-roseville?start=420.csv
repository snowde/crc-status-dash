Janet O.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,10,6,2.0,8/5/2014,"I went out to eat with my family for a birthday and we had a big group. 13 people to be exact. After we were seated and looking over the menu for a while we started wondering where our waiter was. It was about 5 more minutes until he showed up to take our drink order. He returned much later with waters and warm beer samples. He was then ready to take our order. From the time our order was placed it took an hour for the food to make it to our table and they got our pizza wrong which was serving 5 of the people there and the meals were not exactly how they were ordered and cold to boot. There were people who got there after us and got their food before us and to have the food come out wrong was too much. I don't normally complain, there is someone else in the family who always does it first, but  I got up and asked one of the many workers, huddled around the cashier not doing anything, to get me a manager.  Now I gave them two stars because the manager made up for the mess by discounting the meals and bringing out two new pizzas. I hope the service gets better because the food and beer are great."
Troy J.,"Sloughhouse, CA",23,70,33,2.0,11/17/2013,"I really like BJ's, but just found out they are doing the same thing that On The Border is doing and cutting their hamburgers from 8oz to 5oz. I could not recommend them based on that unless you want 3oz less. They say they dropped the price, I suppose a $1, which will not make up for the difference in my opinion. Sounds like an exec heard that others are getting away with it and they need more money, so why not?  Went back to get another burger-the largest they make. The beef was like eating rocks-neither my wife nor I liked it and since we have had this experience that last couple of visits we are not going back. It seems Bj's has had some sort of managment change."
Pauleen T.,"Charlottesville, VA",48,84,77,3.0,7/15/2012,"GREAT ROOT BEER.  I love root beer, but I hate that A&W shit (mixed fresh from powder when you order it!) and that nasty cheap canned stuff.  If you like good root beer, then you absolutely have to try BJ's!  It's house made and on the sweeter side.  Mmmmmm so good. The mini pizzas are pretty small, but surprisingly filling.  They're probably the same size as a Pizza Hut personal pizza, maybe even a teensy bit smaller...which is good because then you'll have room for a delicious pizookie!  The pizza dough here is super fluffy and puffy and soft.  Love it. Finally, the service was REALLY REALLY slow and our waiter kept trying to sell us more stuff.  He was definitely pushing it and it got really annoying.  Also he was pretty good at pulling a disappearing act.  Minus one star for that.  No wonder the estimated wait at Yardhouse was 40 minutes longer."
Bhondhu K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,,4.0,5/24/2014,"I was listening to one of those Chefs I admire that his favorite restaurant is one of those big chain restaurants that I personally don't like.  When asked why, he mentioned that the restaurant is making several people happy everyday.  BJ's is one of those place for me -- nothing great about the food, not bad either, but the place is always lively, good service, friendly waiters, they will get you food from lunch menu during dinner, kids drinks are free and the list of niceties goes on.  They got VERY GOOD beers. I like their beer flights - in expensive and you could try many of them.  I am always happy there."
Sabrina N.,"Clovis, CA",0,7,,5.0,7/18/2015,"We had a reservation for 43 people that consisted of a traveling soccer team and their families. BJ's was INCREDIBLY accommodating of our large group as well as need for SEPARATE CHECKS. As a previous server, I know the work that goes into a large party requiring separate checks. I appreciate the friendly, timely and professional service provided by each and every staff member. Thank you very much for a wonderful and relaxing experience."
Jules C.,"Sacramento, CA",7,36,62,2.0,1/10/2015,"After a 45 minute wait for 6 on a Friday evening, we finally got a booth. We ordered along with our drinks right away because we know it takes forever. We were pleasantly surprised when the food came in about 15 minutes. My husband got the brew house burger which was super dry and he hated it. I had the tomato basil soup in a bread bowl. I loved the soup but they barely put a cup in there!! All bread no soup!  No water refills the whole time we were here until the check came. Uhh next time we'll just go to yard house across the street! They have a great happy hour menu fyi ;)"
Charlie K.,"Medford, OR",48,159,77,4.0,4/16/2014,"Yum! Always go here for my birthday with a group. Everything I've had is delish. Pizzas are great, the huge baked potatoes are awesome. They Jeremiah Double Barrel red is great!!"
Shane L.,"Roseville, CA",2,37,33,3.0,7/5/2014,Food is decent and I like the atmosphere but they take forever to serve you! Every time I go to this BJs I am disappointed with how much time it takes to get my food. Pretty good as long as your not in a hurry!
Cheryl L.,"Citrus Heights, CA",8,5,,1.0,11/10/2013,This is the 3rd time we have been there. Twice we have been forgotten about. Our appetizer didn't come until our meal. Our drinks were not refilled. By the time we got our food we had no drinks and they never came back when we ordered more drink. Manager came and promised we would be taken care if and of course we were not!! This time we went we never got our appetizer!  Don't go there!!
Nicole I.,"Sacramento, CA",191,216,389,1.0,6/15/2013,"I went to the Roseville BJ's for my little sister and brother's birthday parties with the entire family and a couple of friends. There's a BJ's in Natomas and I know that it can get crowded and so it's best to place a reservation if you want to eat at a certain time. My mom called a week ahead and they said that they do not take reservations but could put us on their call-ahead list that we could place our names on about an hour before we wanted to get there. I called a couple days later and was told the same thing so I called the morning of their party and was told that it wasn't busy yet and to call an hour before. An hour before her supposed party, I called to make the ""call ahead reservation"" for 15 people. The woman on the other end of the line told me that they can't reserve tables for that many people and that I should have called ahead to make the reservation. Hand-palm. I called my mom who was with the rest of the clan driving to Roseville and told them the bad news. They had gotten there early and so they ended up waiting a half an hour for enough tables to be put together for our party.  We all ordered our food and the server gets our drink orders. Half of the table gets their drinks. The rest of us wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, I flagged down another waiter and asked him if he could look into our disappearing drinks. They were never entered and so he briskly brings them out. We continue to wait on our food and after a while, a couple of salads came out. When you are paying over $15 for an entree that comes with a side salad, it had better be decent. The salads were from bags that you could pick up from the local grocer for $2 a bag. Seriously? Bagged iceberg lettuce as a side salad for a filet? As time passed, food gradually found it's way to the table. Three people would get their food, then there'd be a ten minute wait and two more would get their food. We told people to start eating their food as it was going to get cold by the time everyone got their food. After another 10-15 minutes, everyone except my husband (who ordered a veggie burger with cheese) got their orders. The waiter made his way over to see if everything was ok. We told him about the burger and he looks at the tab and says the kitchen didn't make it. He places the order in and I wait for his burger, thinking it can't take longer than 15 minutes. Everyone else eats their meals and a half an hour later, my husband finally gets his veggie burger. It's a veggie burger not a steak- all it needs is a couple of minutes on the grill to warm up but apparently not at BJs. Everyone else had finished their meals and we quickly eat ours as we are way past starving. We file out of the restaurant and head over to Ulta to pick up a couple of products. In the store, both me and my husband get the stomach gurglings and run to the bathroom. Nothing. We decide it's best to get home so we jump in the car and everything was seeming ok then the demon spawn (or bacterial growth) inside my stomach started to unleash its fury. The drive from Roseville to North Natomas has never been so long with both of us in tears as we drove on the freeway. When we got home, my husband induced vomiting thinking that he would save himself somehow. It didn't. I opted out of the vomiting and just stayed planted on the toilet. The stomach cramps were so bad that it felt that someone was clawing out of our bodies. We considered going to the hospital but neither of us were able to move much less drive the 15 minutes to the hospital so we stayed curled up in our bed. It took 2 full days to recover from whatever we got from the burgers.  My mom called the restaurant and was forwarded to corporate. She gave them our phone number and they got in contact with us. When I talked to their rep, she was ticked off that I didn't go to the ER (she was subtly questioning whether or not we got sick). She said that that specific franchise had never had any type of food poisoning problem, insinuating once again that we were somehow trying to scam the system. You can't fake the feeling of having an apocalyptic hell beast claw out of your stomach. No one has that great an imagination. She said she would send a gift card to make up for our experience and after we got it in the mail, we quickly handed it off as I do not trust any restaurant that gets me that sick for that long.  Save your money and time and go to another restaurant, we certainly are."
Vicky D.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/10/2013,"Our party of 4 seniors were seated furthest distance from the front door in a dark corner.  The service was the worst we have ever had.  One wait person started with us, but then disappeared, only to be followed by another that seemed to forget us.  Our dinner took over 2 hours, with cold food for all four of us, but by this time we did not want to wait another hour for hot food.  The coffee was cold , pizza cold, french fries cold etc.  Overall the worst experrience of any BJs we have ever had...adios roseville's BJs we won't miss you at al"
Gregg P.,"Roseville, CA",633,23,51,4.0,6/5/2012,"If you can't find something here to like on their extensive menu (yeah, I think it has gotten a bit too big) then you aren't trying. Beer is solid, food is good (I find myself returning often to their lettuce wraps--nice size, fresh, tasty) and service is steady too.  I think they do a nice job.  Only issue in this place is that it is usually busy, making the wait long.  Wish the bar area was bigger...always seems full. If you can score a seat though, always a nice choice."
Kathleen B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,4,1.0,10/24/2014,"We took some friends here last night as we have liked their food in the past. We ordered 2 pizzas, pepperoni with red sauce and mushrooms, one deep dish and one thin crust.  I got the kale salad which was delicious, with candied walnuts, blueberries and dried cranberries. The pizzas however were terrible! They were doughy and undercooked, with almost no sauce. We asked for additional sauce and they did bring some after about 10 minutes of waiting. The tomatoes on it were clearly canned. We also ordered beer, a porter which is our favorite. It was flabby and bland, not good at all. Our waiter was good, it was very crowded for a Thursday night. Will not be eating there again though. For $105 for crummy pizza and beer with one good salad, I think we will eat elsewhere."
Shawn C.,"Rocklin, CA",112,19,,4.0,11/15/2011,I had a really good experience here tonight. Had the ribs and they were good... Not top notch bbq but very good for a non-bbq/non-steakhouse place.  The root beer is very good as well.  Our service was quick and very friendly and I don't hqve any complaints except for a little confusion... We order spinich stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. 20 minutes later after getting our salads the manager comes over to us and appologizes because they were out of mushrooms and offers a complimentary replacement.  Very nice... But after we finished our meal the table across from us recieved the mushroom appetizers...  I don't know... But thanks for a nice dinner.
Sundiata C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,41,,4.0,7/16/2014,"Just split a great white large pizza with my wife and friend. He pizza was great. We also had an order of fried artichoke and corn fritters. The artichoke was ok but the corn fritters were good. The waiters in the bar area are friendly and attentive. Like most bjs the environment is casual and welcoming. Happy hours are 3-7pm or after 10pm, which sucks if you are looking for cheap drinks around dinner time."
Megan W.,"Denver, CO",40,145,47,3.0,8/12/2011,"I hate their service, but I love the Great White pizza and the mozzarella sticks. There's always something wrong with the order and when you point it out, expect to wait for days to get the fixed order with no apologizes/comping.  Big parties like to come here even though the service for said large parties is NEVER good."
Noelle R.,"Lincoln, CA",0,19,,5.0,5/22/2014,We usually get delivery & the pizza is definitely the best in town. Haven't eaten at the there yet but it's always busy when I drive by. Glad a family owned place is thriving in our little town.
Shawn B.,"Antelope, CA",20,203,38,4.0,9/25/2011,The food is always good and the beer is wonderful. I would normally say the service was top notch but not tonight. It took 20 minutes just to get water and 30 minutes to order. Well out of the norm. The manager didn't help us out on the bill because we were having an already discounted meal but he did give us a gift card worth almost as much as the meal for next time. All and all I will still come here.
Jeff S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",120,64,79,2.0,2/22/2014,"I give it two stars because there pizza is actually pretty good. Other than that, everything else is pretty mediocre! The wait staff here is not very friendly or attentive, the prices are way to high and the quality of food Is pretty poor. I've given this place a few different chances and it hasn't gotten any better. This last time in a group of 7...only 1 person didn't complain about there food! No more for me!"
S M.,"Contra Costa County, CA",3,192,4,2.0,9/10/2013,"Came here for lunch with family the other day and the place was about 3/4 full. I was not impressed with my veggie burger, which was bland and came with zero condiments and without the requested avocado. The burger, and the fries that came with it, were cold, too. Another family member asked for extra onions; those ended up on someone else's burger. Service was somewhat off, too. I came in first and got a table for our group and waited for about 5 minutes alone. The waitress came over and asked about drinks. I asked for water all around and said I'd like to wait for the rest of my group before ordering. She continued to ask me about alcoholic beverages and appetizers, and I had to repeat that I was waiting for other people. When they arrived, we put in the rest of our order. The food took a really long time to come out and, as I said above, we were missing quite a few things. Had to flag down another waitress to ask for everything."
