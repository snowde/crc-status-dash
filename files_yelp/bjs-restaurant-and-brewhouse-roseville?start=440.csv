Brook S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/3/2014,Worst place to order for delivery they have no way of keeping your food hot and im sure if was sitting for awhile everything was soggy and disgusting did not even eat all ... The staff was rude to begin with should have refrained from ordering !
Daniel G.,"Citrus Heights, CA",178,37,8,4.0,11/24/2013,"Some of the best Parmesan Crusted Chicken I've had. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here and I've been coming here for years. Great food, amazing service. If only it wasn't so busy when I wanna go!"
James H.,"Searcy, AR",9,22,3,1.0,11/8/2013,"Good food but slow service. We did have a group of 32, but only one waiter. The other two waitress' left and I never saw them again. Another thing is when I asked for something I had to ask 3 different times till I finally got it. And when separating the receipts, they messed up and added some things to the receipt that wasn't mine. They were EXTREMELY SLOW. And they were not that busy.. The Folsom location is much better than this one. I see a couple of other reviews like this. Jameson was the only great server. It's kind of sad."
Will C.,"Sacramento, CA",15,251,8,1.0,5/21/2011,"HORRIBLE - came here to attend a friend's 25th birthday party.  We were a party of 12.  3 of us were able to order before the other 9 arrived.  2 of the 3 that ordered received their food way too early.  One didn't eat their food because we thought everyone else would get their food at about the same time.  After waiting so long, she asked the waiter to re-heat...yup, re-heat the food again.  I ordered a SALAD, and I didn't get my food yet.  The other 9 ordered their food and 8 of the 9 received theirs.  I was still waiting.  I complained to the manager.  By the time I received my food it was maybe 45 minutes later, they placed it in a to go box in a to go bag.  I had come back from the restroom after drinking 5 diet pepsis waiting for my food to find this bag in front of my seat! The place was packed - about 1045pm on a Friday night.  NEVER this location ever again. EDIT:  Even though 2 of the 12 that didn't get the food were comp'd, I still rate this place as 1-star.  I found it insulting for the waiter to think I wanted my food to go.  I was sitting there in the restaurant eating out of a to-go container.  If I wanted to have it to go, I would have gone to Jack's or some place less casual like LaBou!  BAD...VERY BAD"
John H.,"Sacramento, CA",67,5,,1.0,9/10/2015,"Been here a few times, but this was by far the least impressive. I ordered my dinner with a request for no avocado. Arrived with extra avocado, but because it took so long to get it in the first place I kept it and decided to spend the next 5 mins digging through the meal to remove the avocado. Takes the fun out of eating when you are taking time to fix a mistake. I figured dessert would heal me.... Wrong. I ordered the root beer float and my party ordered several other desserts. As they were finishing up theirs I asked the waitress to cancel mine due to the extreme wait. I asked for it to be refunded. I watched our waitress speak with the manager who fixed our bill. My biggest issue is he didn't come over to apologize. He knew there was an issue. He probably knew there were a few issues with my meal, but he didn't want to take the time to apologize for the issues. I didn't want anything monetary, but when your business messes up have the service ability to apologize. I don't anticipate returning for any reason."
Brandy D.,"Rocklin, CA",32,46,37,3.0,1/6/2014,"I normally love Bjs. This delivery experience has soured my taste for ever getting delivery from them again. After a lot of confusion on the phone just trying to place an order, I apparently recieved a call and voicemail about my order not being able to be made as I requested. I keep my phone on silent and didnt hear this call come through. An hour later when I check my phone and get to call them back, I was told that the choice was already made for me altering my order and it was on its way. It sure was... cold and soggy. Not what I'd expect from a $50 meal. Pretty disappointed with Bjs today."
Julianne C.,"Sacramento, CA",108,131,44,5.0,12/15/2011,"The menu here is large, and there are many items that me and my family love: fried calamari, fried artichokes, blue cheese wedge salad, Pale Ale chili, cheeseburger pizza, buffalo pizza, huge loaded baked potatoes, open face chili cheeseburger (crazy good!!) And who doesn't love a cookie fresh from the oven topped with ice cream? Yum  We usually have great service here, but if you come on a busy Friday night, you run the chances of less than perfect service. This is a no-brainer, but still some people are surprised when they show up at 7pm Friday and have a wait.  When no one can decide what sounds good for dinner, BJ's is always a crowd pleaser."
Amy N.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/29/2013,"I have decided to write this review after a few bad experiences at BJs Rsvl. With in the last few months we have gone to the Rsvl location for a few occasions and mind you these are weeknight visits when they are not busy. The servers there never have time for the tables everything is rushed, the customer service attitude is no existent, they are rude and snobby young adults, & they never come back to check on drinks (water and iced tea) and get refills going unless you have purchased from the bar to keep that adding up on the bill. Each time when it's time to pay the check even though I have told them I'm in a hurry is at 15 min process to get the bill paid I have even had to go up to the hostess station to get it paid after 20 mins. All in all I will not be going back especially when Yard House is a few blocks away!!!!"
Alicia L.,"Antelope, CA",111,6,,1.0,11/4/2014,"Dont bother with take out! Girlfriend and I decided to order one of their more expensive fancy burgers which was supposed to include burger patty, bacon, cheese, parmesan bun, onions, tomatoes, lettus, sauce, and we added jalapeños. We pick up or order and EVEN TIPPED.. got home to find our burgers (or lack of) just tossed in a bin completely fallen apart missing pretty much the whole entire burger. The only thing included on the burger was burger patty, regular bun (no parmesan), tomato, lettus, couple slivers of onion and THAT WAS IT. No bacon, no cheese, no parmesan bun, no jalapeños, no sauce.... just a dry plain bland burger. Waste of money and gas."
Connie O.,"Fremont, CA",52,41,52,4.0,1/7/2014,"This place is always crowded but still a good place to eat with friends especially when you are at the bar..!! No other place offers or gives you lemon, mint, and cucumbers for your water..!! Awesome..!!!!!"
Conner P.,"Pine Grove, CA",0,5,,4.0,6/23/2014,"I would give 5 stars simply for the great waitress that served us a few nights ago, she was very nice and quick, I don't remember her name but she had red hair, I gave less stars because I paid $33 for a pizookie and a medium pizza, I did add shrimp which costed $9 so I payed the $14 for a basic cheese pizza which is a little annoying, but it was delicious so i can't complain too much!"
Adriana M.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/20/2014,"I don't understand why most of these reviews are rated so low and for the bad service too! I go to BJs quite often (few times a month), every time I go, not only is the service amazing (given the exceptions of one  or two servers) and the food always comes out amazing. In my experience most of my servers have been extremely friendly, very attentive and very helpful when it comes to the menu."
Evan S.,"Chicago, IL",545,194,9,3.0,12/15/2013,"If you find yourself in Roseville, it's worth checking out.  Especially if you want a great tour of beers."
Kim B.,"Roseville, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/6/2014,"The food is just ok, sometimes.Hey blonde ponytail with nothing behind the eyes, learn how to seat people. Service was as bad tonight as every other time we have been there. I guess when people line up outside the door, a place will quit caring. Wait, why do people line up for this place?? Next time ,going to Smashburger..."
Heidi H.,"Carmichael, CA",982,685,982,5.0,4/26/2011,"I'm not a beer drinker but I knew they made their own root beer but they also make cream sodas and cherry and orange sodas!!! Yum  The Pizza is the greatest and they have so many choices, everyone is bound to be happy here.  Lunch specials are great and they have plenty of salad and sandwich options as well as pizza.  They even have a frequent lunch card you can get signed to get one free after so many."
Jane W.,"Lincoln, CA",7,50,1,2.0,6/12/2013,"Tried the mahi-mahi with blonde beer-battered shrimp.  Never got to try the mahi mahi because they served the salmon instead.  Don't care for salmon and asked for mahi again.  After waiting another 30 minutes the mahi mahi still didn't arrive so I cancelled the fish.  Was told by mgt that I couldn't get a discount for the fish that I ordered that never came but I could get a free piezookie!  ok The shrimp was very salty and tasted like it came frozen and recooked.  Wasn't worth eating.  Shrimp needs to be fresh, plump, cooked only once, not salted, otherwise it's just dog food. The rice was good.  The dessert was excellent! All in all, I like BJs very much but there's a few meals I would never get again and tonight's was one of them. good beer!"
Nick L.,"Merced, CA",2,28,10,4.0,1/13/2014,"Not a bad place to eat, but not the best. The service was above and beyond. Our server constantly checked on us while we were waiting for others to arrive, and offered us her recommendations. The food was okay. The teriyaki chicken was okay, I've tasted better at other restaurants. My girlfriend had ordered the chicken Alfredo, but that was subpar. The pasta tasted weird and was soggy, the chicken was the best part. Would I recommend this place, yes but it's pretty pricey for what they have."
Amy K.,"Lincoln, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/29/2015,"We are frequent diners at BJ's since  late last year when we moved to the area and were living out of our RV.  Now that we have purchased a home, we continue to return to BJ's on a monthly basis at the very least. We have found the wait staff to be dedicated and any minor problems at our table have always been promptly and professionally handled.  Several times managers have visited our table impromptu and asked about our dining experience.  This restaurant delivers on good food and service."
Sarah D.,"Rocklin, CA",1,4,,5.0,4/29/2014,"This restaurant is amazing. Everything I have ordered has been tasty and delicious. The service is great, too. I will continue to go back with my family and friends."
Kera J.,"Carmichael, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/28/2015,"This place is horrible! And the staff is worse....my sister and her friends came here for prom night dinner and we're giving horrible service! To make things worse, when the bill was being paid a waiter stole there cash!! The group was flagged down and embarrassed on their prom night and was being accused of not paying!!! Then,when the kids asked for a manager and for someone to review the cameras they refused and threatened them with police and told them they couldn't leave which made them late to prom! The final straw was when they made my sister and her friends pay AGAIN!!! Taking a total of $240 dollars from them that night. The corporate office is a joke! So is this place. Ran like a play ground! Horrible. I will never go back ever."
