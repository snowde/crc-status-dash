Dennis D.,"Roseville, CA",8,23,2,5.0,5/31/2014,"Happy hour here is great. Decent beer and an individual pizza for only $10 bucks, can't go wrong with that."
Joyti K.,"Antelope, CA",110,28,5,3.0,12/14/2013,The only thing I love about this restaurant are the pizookies! I've been here waaay too often and kind of hate it now. In the beginning their customer service was better. The last few times we had to wait forever to get the attention of our server and asked twice for silverware with our food sitting in front of us....this happened more than a couple of times!
Shane T.,"Sacramento, CA",155,267,79,3.0,8/19/2011,"Went here twice for lunch and I really want to give four stars but I can't. First time I had the chicken fettuccine and second time I had the pulled pork sandwich. Both were excellent and I sat at the bar both times.  Had the same server both times and she sucks. Not very personable. On my second visit she gives me a catchup bottle and says it's almost out (so why do you give this to the customer). Starts to give me a second bottle when the first one is obviously out, and I have to ask for more. The second bottle of catchup is practically empty. I'm wondering where is her common sense? She goes to the back and brings out a new catchup bottle without shaking it, so I pour tomato juice until it becomes catchup.  If the service was better at the bar during the lunch hour I would be happy to say I'm a fan and tip twenty percent. I just don't have a lot to look forward to when sitting at the bar for lunch."
May L.,"Rocklin, CA",18,19,9,2.0,12/23/2012,"Was not a good experience. Slow service and cold food. We had 2 babies and came on a Thursday night around 9:45pm. It wasn't so busy so we thought it'd be fine. After waiting for over 30 mins, the pizza arrived and it was lukewarm at best. They offered to make a new one, and reheat the old one so we wouldn't have to wait so long. Well we waited another 15 minutes, and it again came at lukewarm. We could not believe it. It seems that they had a problem bringing food out to the tables and the food was just sitting in the kitchen for a long time! You could totally tell. We got the poozookie and it's the same thing! Waited 15 minutes and it came and the icecream was almost completely melted. Took us almost 2 hours to eat there and it was very difficult with 2 babies."
Lisa B.,"Panama City, FL",4,7,1,3.0,2/13/2014,"Enjoy eating here when I'm in Roseville.   My favorite is the Mediterranean pizza.  It's absolutely delicious.  Their clam chowder is also quite tasty.  Nice selection of beer for the husband.  Service is quick and friendly.  It can get crowded at times and rather loud.  Overall, a nice place to eat."
Mari Dani B.,"Oakland, CA",250,157,131,2.0,9/1/2013,Restaurant was pretty empty bit my party of 10 still had to wait 20 mins.  Then our waitress left for her lunch and it was like no one covered her shift.  At least there is the free pizookie on your bday.
Joann B.,"San Jose, CA",47,34,118,4.0,10/18/2009,"Our favorites are the buffalo wings, appetizer sausage pizza and the pizookie desserts. Their chopped salads are pretty good, too. I would stay away from the sandwiches. Just average. Of course, must order a cold glass (or 2) of their Hef. Yum!  The Roseville location is pretty packed at dinner time, especially during the weekends. Just like their Natomas location, service can take awhile. Thank goodness there's a wall of TV's featuring sports channels."
Heather S.,"Lakeport, CA",58,4,10,5.0,2/8/2014,We all loved our dinner. The manager gave us a free dinner and soup since they messed up our order. Service excellent. Salad fed 3 plus people.
Christine A.,"San Francisco, CA",352,280,108,1.0,11/24/2010,"Food is decent. Nothing to rave about... BUT my biggest gripe with BJ's is the horribly slippery floor. I should have remembered from the first time I went to the Roseville BJ's two years ago- but was reminded again this past weekend that heels are NOT a good option.  Going from the table to the ladies room felt like multiple bad wipeouts about to happen. I'm pretty sure the rest of the restaurant thought I was drunk because I was hobbling all over the place while trying not to give them a show.  Moral of the story: ladies, think twice about wearing those pumps you just got at the Galleria."
Ruth G.,"Rocklin, CA",86,21,3,4.0,3/12/2011,"BJ's is always a great place to go to get consistently good food.  They seem to have some new menu items and we tried the Ahi tuna appetizer.  WOW!  It was great!  You must try it if you are into the sushi type food.  Always a busy place, so if you are in a hurry and don't want to wait, go on the off hours.  And on the weekends, plan on waiting at almost anytime. Food is definitely worth the wait."
Rebecca R.,"North Highlands, CA",12,18,16,3.0,11/18/2013,Stopped in on my lunch waiter was great cook messed up my order gave me a bloody hamburger pretty much waisted my whole lunch waiting for my food to be right not sure if I will be coming back here any time soon
Clint C.,"Rocklin, CA",33,15,,4.0,4/24/2012,"Every time that my adult children come home to visit we HAVE to go to BJ's -The best pizza on the planet (if you like deep dish) and the Pizoki's are the best dessert on the planet (if you like fresh out of the oven giant cookies with ice cream on it) it is much better than it sounds!  This place is very loud and always crowded, unfortunately, otherwise we would come more often"
Svitlana S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",38,173,18,4.0,7/3/2011,"My kids (14 and 4) Love this place...We've ordered take out pizza a few times...and it sucked, but eating in has always been good. Any time my kids have a choice, they wanna come here.  But its always sooo busy and on most nights the wait is 30+ minutes, weekends its an hour +.  I guess the reason they are so busy is because they have something for everyone..."
Sherryl Z.,"Roseville, CA",206,117,186,4.0,6/27/2013,"My husband and I really like the food here but the service is always a ""hit"". It can be a ""miss"" sometimes. But the manager was really friendly. I was searching for a piece of paper by the hostess table so I can write down directions for my Aunt. He came up to me asked me if I needed help and provided me with scratch paper, he was very friendly. The servers are sometimes nice. Our server this time was alright, nothing special but did her job right. Nothing out of the ordinary happened but since we enjoy the food so much they do deserve 4 stars. If I go again in the near future and they surprise me with a ""great attitude"" then I'll def change my review to 5 stars."
California G.,"Modesto, CA",1,25,,1.0,7/29/2015,"Came here on the 24th of  July...around 10 45pm after a comedy show at the Thunder Valley.  I am from Modesto...and the BJs in Modesto and in Laguna blvd ( Sacramento ) always has great service and great food.  We were under the assumption that this restaurant would provide the same.  BOy I was wrong.  The waitress was horrible (red head with short hair). She was nice and pleasant...but She barely checked on us,.....she brought our drinks like 20 minutes after we ordered them.  Appetizers arrived cold ..dinner came late too.  I know it's not the cooks fault because we did see her walking around the facility and she always kept sitting down to talk to this young teenage boy. I know it wasn't super busy...it was busy but not crazy busy.  I was very disappointed.  Hopefully management will talk to their staff about being more attentive to the customers needs.  Very disappointed.  Will not be coming here again if I am in the Roseville area."
Garry L.,"Roseville, CA",8,17,71,4.0,10/13/2013,Excellent food & excellent service. The food was well prepared and delicious. Went here for a birthday celebration and was not disappointed. Would definitely be coming back here ...
Tony H.,"Roseville, CA",27,94,23,3.0,11/4/2012,"Service was suspect at best. We were turned over to a new waitress ""Ricky"" who stepped in and made up for the first servers poor attention and sometimes cluelessness.  Thank goodness for mandatory work breaks. The food was good not great, tried the steak and blue cheese flat bread which was tasty! Overall good food and good beer. Ashamed as it seems BJ's is less and less a place I enjoy eating."
Damon R.,"Davis, CA",42,67,7,1.0,7/16/2013,"They were out of the one item that the each person at a table of six wanted. Then was told that mini pizzas were not available with whole wheat, which is clearly stated on the menu that they are.  The small bite salad we ordered to start with came out after all of our pizzas.  The worst BJs that have ever had."
Bryan L.,"Rocklin, CA",1,112,9,4.0,8/12/2013,"We've lived here for years and I never made it into BJs until this past week.  It was actually a very positive experience.  We went for a late lunch (1:30ish), hence the place was not overly crowded and the service was very responsive.   With only two of us, we got in one of the half-sized booths for two.  The menu was huge, and I was just looking for something simple, so I went for a half sandwich and salad.  Both were pretty good.  Solid food for this sort of place...the thin, crispy fries were great.  I tried their in-house IPA, which was good, but not as bold and hoppy as you would expect for an IPA.  I don't eat out in the Gallareia area much, but I would definitely consider this place again.  Interior was pleasant, food was solid and service was above par."
Neon C.,"Antelope, CA",0,25,,1.0,7/11/2012,"SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE. At all the BJ's my wife and I have gone to, that has been the problem. It's just rude, slow and sloppy!!!! And when your beer and food is ok at best, you really need to step up the service and kick your snotty attitudes to the side."
