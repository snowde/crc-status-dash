Ray I.,"Sacramento, CA",22,4,,5.0,11/15/2013,I enjoy going to BJs with my family the food is great. We tried 4 different pizzas and we loved them all.  But the best part why I love going to BJs ls when l have a sweet tooth and nothing can kill my craving the way thier white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream!!  I absolutely love it.
Yesenia N.,"Roseville, CA",36,14,,1.0,7/18/2012,I went there for lunch today and had the mini pizza lunch special. My pizza was soaked in grease as if they deep fried my pizza crust! Within an hour I felt nauseas. I will more than likely never eat there again.
Sandy K.,"Philadelphia, PA",92,226,156,4.0,7/4/2010,I'm giving BJ's a 4 because my family loves this place (even my traditional Indian grandmother wanted to come here for her birthday dinner).  Come here for the pizza and beer and you will be satisfied. You can't go wrong with the BJ's favorite pizza. Also - the pizookie is amazing! White chocolate macadamia is my favorite :) Try to make a reservation because it gets VERY busy.
DL W.,"Roseville, CA",438,103,61,4.0,4/13/2009,"Apps and entrees are alright!   But wonderful beer!   i am not much of a beer drinker, but i do enjoy the Berrybust at BJs.  If you dont like the bitter beer taste, you will surely enjoy this beer. Dessert is yummy."
Jason F.,"Sacramento, CA",27,24,1,4.0,4/24/2011,I come here all the time. Only go to the locations that actually brew their beer on sight like this one. Beer tastes better.  Ask your waiter if they brew their beer on site. Good food overall. Good portions.
Adrian B.,"Rocklin, CA",171,109,39,4.0,11/2/2012,"Service was a little slow as usual. But food was amazing as always! had a Pirahna Pale Ale and  Blonde Ale and it was very good. Appetizers are pricey, but if you go during happy hour then it's half off."
Devan C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,58,2,1.0,6/20/2012,"the calories are listed on the menu for a reason - did you know a normal diet consists of 2,000 calories per day, and this place serves meals that literally are 2,000 calories?  If you eat dinner from this place and get dessert you might as well just save yourself $20 and eat a stick of butter instead Oh yeah, and would you like a beer with that?"
Blake F.,"Sacramento, CA",5,21,2,4.0,8/9/2013,"Been here multiple times and always a pleasure. Tonight, Michelle was our server and she was excellent and very informative on the menu. I had the fresh atlantic salmon and it was superb. Very fun place to go out with friends or the family."
Keena V.,"Sacramento, CA",194,28,156,4.0,3/29/2011,"Foods I love at all BJs: 1. Loaded potato with bacon and cheese 2. Mini pepperoni pizza 3. Pot stickers 4. Burschetta 5. forgot the name, but it's a pasta with white sauce and broccoli and chicken The service last night was exceptional from the girl that helped us.  Anything and everything we wanted was at our table without any hesitation.  I hadn't been to a BJ's in about a year or more, but going last night and getting the service that I did made me want to come back more often."
Carol D.,"Roseville, CA",2,183,1,2.0,12/24/2012,"The host/welcome experience at this BJ's is so NOT welcoming, and this is the third visit with the same result. A cold tone of voice, being told that we must 'wait' even though most of the restaurant is empty and there is no one waiting in the lobby... a feeling that we are intruding, and the front desk staff has other, better things to do. We came for a nice dinner. One meal was good. The ribs were awful.  Too tough to pull off with a fork. Nearly impossible to cut with a steak knife. Not much meat, and what meat was there was tough and tasteless.  Very little sauce and nothing extra on the side.  So basically, dry, tough meat on bones.  Too risky to battle at the table, so I took home most of the rack, and boiled it to make the meat soften.  Fell away from the bones, but not any more tender.  At least I got some protein out of it!!! Service was just ordinary, no connection at all."
Joe P.,"Roseville, CA",24,17,9,1.0,4/18/2012,"On my recent visit to you location #436 we had an encounter with the manager on duty named Jeremy. We were there because of a fundraiser for my daughter's school, Junction elementary. All the employees knew about the fundraiser. At the time we ordered we told our waitress Michelle that we did not have the flyer but could bring it up on our phone to show her. She was awesome. At the end of the meal she talked with Jeremy and she stated that he would not honor the fundraiser because we did not have the flyer. I asked to speak with him. When he come to the table he did not even let us speak, nor did he even say good evening. He was rude and said he could not honor without the flyer. Then he proceeded to ask what fundraiser. Really say no then ask for what. This manager has to be the worst manager ever! I can't even believe that a fine place like Bjs would even hire this incompetent fool. When asked if we could email it to him and maybe he could print it for us he immediately said NO! I asked could he photo copy someone else's he said well.....I guess. This type of employee should only be allowed to clean the toilets at a truck stop. He has the work customer service ever. The amount for donating was 15% of my bill which was $73.63 so we literally are talking about less than a $15 dollar donation. If I knew that the Jeremy was going to be so rude and ignorant, I would have rather just donated $20 to the school myself and not gone to dinner. I will NEVER come back to BJs. you can be assured I will post reviews everywhere online about this incompetent and ignorant Manager. I would like to know how a person like this would even be considered for a management posisiton."
Josh S.,"Rocklin, CA",40,40,23,4.0,12/17/2010,"Growlers! BJ's has a good selection of hand crafted BEER. After a few of these Beer's, there is nothing better than some greasy fried food. But before ordering your food, you should probably put in that order for a Growler or their finest BEER. After that is done, it's time to get onto food. Might I suggest the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Nestled lovingly on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes, the chicken is salty, crispy, tender all in one. Have I mentioned the Growlers? Don't forget to pick yours up on the way out. They seem a little small to me, but that could be because I drink the beer so quick."
Rachel M.,"Sacramento, CA",375,450,411,4.0,2/21/2011,"BJ's is probably one of my fave hang out type restaurants to go to that has generally reliable food.   My friend Patrick and I did lunch here today.  I wasn't in the mood for a giant meal, so I ordered two starters:  chips and salsa and the chicken pot stickers.  YUM. The salsa that comes with the chips is bomb.  Some of the best I've ever tasted.  BUT - I feel like every time I order this dish I need to ask for extra salsa because it's never enough for as much chips that they give you.  The pot stickers were perfect.  They're never soggy and they have just the right amount of crisp.  Not to mention, the filling is chocked full of flavor.  I almost never have to use the dipping sauce.  Though the sauce is tasty too.  I think it's teriyaki.   I always order a strawberry lemonade when I come here because they have one of the best I've tasted.  Free refills too!  Major plus.  So, two starters and one drink cost me about $18.  Not bad.  The starters could have easily been shared as well."
Erin K.,"Washington, DC",53,26,,4.0,4/13/2011,"I've eaten here twice now and been really happy both times. I had the Pale Ale this time and was satisfied with it. I ate the spicy spaghetti last time and the fish tacos this time, both meals were delicious. The second time I went we were in a big group and my friend's meal arrived to the table about 5-10 minutes later than everyone else's and they comp-ed his meal.  I always appreciate good service that recognizes when something goes wrong and takes action to make it better. I'm not in Sacramento a lot, but if I was I'd definitely go back to this place again and again."
Emily K.,"Roseville, CA",10,34,,4.0,6/26/2013,"I really enjoy BJ's.  Whether you're coming here just with a couple friends, or with a larger group for an event, it's a great experience.  I love everything I've ever ordered, plus the beer selection.  My fave dishes are the grilled ham and cheese with tomato soup (this might not be on the menu anymore but I think they could make it if you asked), the shrimp and angel hair pasta, or any of the pizzas.  And of course the desserts!  Who could go wrong with a giant, melty, chocolate chip cookie?   I've also been here for a bachelorette dinner, and they were very good about reservations and having enough room and accommodating us."
Bill S.,"Napa, CA",0,9,,2.0,12/9/2013,"Brett the waiter was excellent but the 1-1/2 hours wait for was a Terrible.  Brett said there was a party of 20 who's order was in before ours and we were 6. I aksked for the manager who came  and check on what happened.  He apologies for the wait and  did not charge us for 5 meals which was  appropriate in this situation. When the food came it was good, but I  never got a good answer for why it was so long wait for our food.  I think the public should know about our experience to decide if this specific BJ is worth the hassle.  I think  the Asst.  Mgr,  Todd C was not on the Ball making the Kitchen serving food on time. I hope the general manager gets involved and train's Todd C. Asst. Mgr or changes his or/her management team!"
Valerie R.,"Rio Linda, CA",90,173,,3.0,8/29/2013,"We came in one night when they were extraordinarily busy. No surprise there. The food really was disappointing, in that it was very small portion size. You should never leave a restaurant hungry, and we totally did. The waiter was very fast, but didn't even ask if we needed anything. Not sure of this place."
reuben a.,"Newark, CA",1,3,,5.0,6/15/2010,"All employees were hella friendly and quick with the orders.  The food was on point - get the CALIFORNIA CHICKEN SANDWICH and NACHOS APPETIZERS :) yummmm...  Good place to catch games - watched GAME 5 of NBA FINALS HERE - that was pretty coooool .  I was the only laker fan , hella outnumbered hahahah. but the place is really good - they should be proud of their service.  :)"
Erica S.,"San Jose, CA",248,1371,348,3.0,1/2/2009,"This BJ's was bigger in space than the ones I've been to.  On a Monday night, it was pretty busy due to people watching football.  Instead of finding a seat at the bar, we opted to wait for a table in the dining area.  Food took awhile to come out.  Even the appetizer took like 25 minutes after we ordered it.  I tried their Santa Fe spring rolls, which had chicken, black beans, roasted red peppers, cheese, and corn inside.  It came with avocado cream sauce and another sauce.  It came with about 10 pieces and since it was piping hot, it tasted good.  Perfect with cold beer!   For dinner, I tried the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza.  The server recommended getting a medium size for 2 people.  It was 6 big slices so it ended up being too much food after eating the appetizer.  Unfortunately, the pizza didn't look or taste as good as I expected.  It came with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, olives, and tomatoes, but it didn't seem like there was any sauce on it.  The toppings were very limited that I felt like I paid more for the dough.  Every bite seemed like I was stuffing carbs.  There was barely any flavor to it that I was a little disappointed.  Now I know what not to order next time.  Service was good though."
Kevin F.,"Yuba City, CA",0,11,2,3.0,11/23/2013,"BJ's is a favorite restaurant for pizza. However, in my opinion they are totally unable to make a good burger if you like them anything other than medium well. Tonight I ordered the brewhouse double burger and after 3 attempts I could not get a single burger with both patties showing pink inside.  All three burgers had one pink and one well done patty.  My advice is not to order the burgers because my wife had a similar problem it took two tries to get an edible one. My best advice is stick with the pizza."
