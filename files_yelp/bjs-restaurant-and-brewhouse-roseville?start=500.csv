Michelle S.,"Roseville, CA",201,194,10,3.0,10/12/2010,"We recently went to BJ's because it was late, we were hungry, and we didn't want to drive to Sac...plus, the weekend atmosphere (especially in the bar area) can be pretty fun. Based on my prior experiences with weak sauce mixed drinks here, I ordered a dirty gin martini--however, they managed to make what tasted like straight up olive juice :(  Dinner was pretty good and calorie laden as expected, but we noticed that the avocado eggrolls did not seem quite as good as we remembered... Would be a 2.5, but I'll give it a 3 for atmosphere :)"
Tammy S.,"Folsom, CA",343,603,172,3.0,11/22/2010,BJ's is pretty good food. Not a lot of veg options but I go there a lot because it is my friend's favorite. They are always super busy yet the service is quick and friendly. The beer is good but so is the wine. The menu is kinda typical but all good.
J B J.,"Roseville, CA",0,28,12,4.0,7/7/2013,Usually great food I only have had one miss out of many. We go frequent because my husband likes the beers. Too noisy for my preference.
Brittany E.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2015,"Don't get me wrong, I like BJ's but this location is the worst. The service is slow and food quality is just OK. I usually go to the Folsom location and have never had any problems there. Took my mom here for a mother-daughter date night and we left upset and overcharged. Our waitress was cute but she was a complete bonehead. We ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer and never received them. When our entrees arrived, we asked about our appetizer and the food runner sent our waitress over. She apologized saying she forgot to ring it in due to my mom's complicated drink order....a mojito with agave instead of simple syrup is not that complicated... Anyway, she told us that she would remove the appetizer from the bill and have the egg rolls bagged up and ready to go for us at the end of our meal, no big deal right? WRONG! We got the egg rolls but they were still on the bill AND she charged us for the agave without informing us that there would be a charge for it. It took 20 minutes of arguing for her to realize that she was wrong and eventually remove the egg rolls from the bill after giving us attitude about it. Won't be back due to that idiot girl and just OK food."
Joe B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,759,7,4.0,12/2/2010,"First time going to BJ's for happy hour... Usually it is too crowded and we can't get a seat... Yesterday, we were in luck... Had a great time.... Service was just fine.. Waitress was nice... Plenty of options for happy hour food... We had the sliders with fries.. Tasty good and a huge portion... Tried a mini pizza and finished the whole thing... The beer is good.... We liked the Stout and Porter... Didn't care for the light beers.... With all of the tv's, specials, and great location, we will go back again...."
Brook M.,"Sacramento, CA",4,26,21,3.0,2/15/2011,"Hot jambalaya!  It was a big party so the service was lacking slightly, but that is to be expected. The jambalaya was awesomely spicy and they had Chimay on their beer menu."
Anji W.,"San Francisco, CA",785,202,1755,5.0,1/8/2012,"I love going to all the BJ's in general, but the waitress that served me that night at THIS BJ's was great. She gave suggestions and was all smiles whenever she was around. I love this place because of all the different sports playing on the screens and the food is yummy. I like ordering pizza, the cheddar bowl, the jalapeno burger, and the chicken limone over the angel hair here depending on what I'm craving. Their drinks here are delicious too. BJ's is a repeat place for me!"
Sean M.,"Roseville, CA",666,129,774,4.0,3/17/2012,"I visited here the other night with my brother while his wife and his new baby girl rested at the hospital...she had just been born the day before. We wanted to get a drink and some food but didn't want to be in an atmosphere that was too loud and crazy, so we chose BJ's. I've been here many times before and their service, food and prices are always excellent! I really tried to order something different but I went with my usual...the Jambalaya! It's delicious...just try not to look at the calorie content!  I was glad we decided to go to BJ's instead of the ""other"" brew house, across the street. They weren't busy at all, and it was a nice, relaxing dinner with a Brewhouse blonde and one of my favorite Cajun dishes."
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, CA",266,876,2178,3.0,10/13/2010,"Huge portions, can't beat that. Plenty of items to choose from on the menu.  The service is pretty consistent with being friendly."
Jen L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/7/2014,This place rocks food is great service is awesome x can I ask for anymore and they even give you free pizza while are you waiting for the table
Rodel R.,"Sacramento, CA",141,359,18,5.0,10/24/2010,"""The soda isn't listed on the menu, how much is it"" - me ""How about free?"" - server I guess I caught a break there, or maybe we were in a huge group and he wanted a huge tip, which he got!  My friends and I celebrate birthdays at this location from time to time and we really have nothing to complain about!  Service is great! Another good perk about this location is the happy hour.  $5 pizzas and discounted appetizers and drinks, you really can't go wrong here!   My personal recommendation would have to be the Great White pizza... which is basically their version of a Garlic Chicken pizza.  My friends also made the mistake of ordering separate Pizookies, when we could have ordered the giant one and saved a lot!  Oops, LOL. I would also have to suggest the baked potato... it's huge! (TWSS LOL)"
Jonathan S.,"Rocklin, CA",9,9,,1.0,6/27/2012,"Deep dish pizza was horrible, incredibly bad service, and the manager was rude when we asked for assistance. We're not going back!"
Brittany H.,"Roseville, CA",171,270,20,5.0,10/9/2010,"I had my 21st birthday dinner here a week or so ago so I feel the need to update this. They were super accommodating, waitress was super patient, drinks were on point and got me just buzzed enough to still be able to function and go to the club after (and drinks are pretty well-priced!). And I'll be honest, in my previous review I acted as though I tried every single pizza at BJ's, when that wasn't the case. I'm usually a pasta-kinda girl, and pizza when I just don't know what the hell to get. Well this time I went with a pizza- I forgot what it was called but it was like a supreme pizza with veggies, meats, etc. (maybe it was the BJ's combo or something).. but let me tell you.. it was hands down probably the best pizza I've ever had (aside from Fiori's Pizza in Pittsburgh, PA).. deep dish, cooked to perfection, crust was so delish.. I'm seriously on a BJ's pizza kick. I had the leftovers the next day then I ordered a large to go which I devoured for a couple days after.. and now I want more."
Joe T.,"Newcastle, CA",18,13,2,2.0,8/17/2013,"What a disappointment!  The stars is for the   BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE®. Ordered a nice rare ribeye....brought me a MEDIUM ribeye.  Waitress was great and was not her fault as she relies on the kitchen to look good. She took back to the kitchen and brought a rare non-ribeye piece meat. Two bites and I was done. Left a great tip for the waitress, but never again. BTW, the manager was notified, but they never showed."
Cynthia A.,"Alameda, CA",57,159,3,5.0,12/31/2009,"We've come by again twice since the last review ... I found that lunch ends up being the same as the dinner. Why? - Two Pizza & Salad specials w/ sodas ends up around $20-$25 - Dinner for Two (Salad & Medium Pizza & Pizookie) is $20 Why didn't I know about dinner for two sooner?! The waitress asked if we wanted a pizookie, and we thought that it would have been extra to ask! When we looked at our receipt, we saw that the pizookie was actually part of a deal that they had. Wow -- mistake on our part, but we were full anyways! The wait is usually around five minutes for this place since we usually come when everyone else wants a seat, too. They're pretty quick with service."
Paul C.,"Roseville, CA",2,42,27,3.0,12/7/2012,Overall the food is alright.  I come here for the pizza with my friends.  We have some beer.  The pizza is good as I don't expect too much of it.  This restaurant always have so many people to wait in line.  I love the SPINACH & ARTICHOKE pizza.  Deep dish one is ok.
Jay D.,"Sacramento, CA",10,14,370,4.0,11/7/2010,"I went for happy hour and got the southwestern mini pizza and calamari. Sauce was good for the calamari and pizza wasn't bad. Happy hour is still quite pricy, but I would go back."
Alex C.,"Sacramento, CA",247,180,9,1.0,3/10/2010,Crystal bad server!! This girl in comparison was about the same as Daria on Mtv.. She was so plain and tall..  The food was ok.. Crystal's service really stunk. I never got a refill until the check came. No silver ware. No napkins. How do you suck at your job this much? Really? It's sad because I really like coming to this place.. Too bad Crystal's service really sucked..
Audrey P.,"Renton, WA",0,3,,3.0,11/6/2014,"I've only been here once, and my experience was pretty good. The service was fine. The sirloin steak was delicious and the pizzookie was as well, but my rice pilaf was undercooked. I wish I'd thought of mentioning it to the server!"
Chris B.,"Sacramento, CA",68,191,6,3.0,2/22/2010,"For me the only time BJ's is worth the trip is during happy hour where you can get your own deep dish pizza for cheap. I do enjoy their micro-brew but it's not the best. This place tends to get very busy, with pretty long waits and especially during prom season the place will be crawling with teens."
