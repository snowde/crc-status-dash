Chris M.,"Sacramento, CA",18,2,,2.0,12/29/2012,The food has always been great. The pizza is amazing. But this is the seccond time we have done call ahead seating and our wait time was longer than it would have been if we just went in. Call ahead seating is a joke and hurts you more than it helps.
Mike F.,"Rocklin, CA",16,29,8,3.0,2/26/2013,"Food & beverages good, little cramps in bar area & music had a tendency top be to loud."
Lady W.,"Loomis, CA",0,24,2,1.0,11/12/2014,"I have always enjoyed BJs restaurant.  My family and I have been eating at BJs for over 10 years without incident. However,  all of that changed today. We got the worst server in the world. For an appetizer we ordered the calamary. My daughter ordered unlimited soup and salad. The rude despicable server came back to our table after putting our order in and with her finger pointing said to the four of us. The soup and salad is only for one person.  You can't all eat from it just because it's unlimited.  First of all this was purely stereotypical to a black family. We were flabbergasted. She then bought the appetizer and another employee bought the soup and salad.  We had no desire to order anything else,  nor to eat anything.  I promptly went to the front counter and asked for a manager.  The assistant GM came out and when the server saw me taking to him she came by. I told her to her face ""You do no need to go back to our table.  I told the manager how disgustingly rude this was and asked for our bill so that we could leave. He said he will have a talk with her. While he spends his time talking with her,  we will Never Ever Return To BJs again.  I have never experienced such stereotypical prejudice in a restaurant.  To assume that just because we are black we were going to share unlimited soup and salad is horrible.  If each of us wanted soup and salad,  we had plenty of money and we would have been more than happy to order some for everyone. The name on the receipt is Cameron although this may not be the rude prejudice server's name since they switched us to a booth.  For this BJs should shut down!"
Meredith N.,"Brentwood, CA",72,28,2,2.0,10/5/2013,"We had destiny as our waitress. She was good until we started getting our food. Two of us had Caesar salads which had a bad taste to it and old browned lettuce. We sent one back and she said she would give us another, but never brought it. The pizza was soggy. The pizookie was amazing. The manager stopped by at one point and gave us these cards and said to give them to our waitress and she could run them to see if they had any money off on them, so we did that. Destiny told us they wouldn't work today and we had to come back. When we inquired further, she said that she already knows they're not going to work but will check anyways - we were clearly putting her out for asking this. She came back and said they WOULD work and they gave us $10 off our meal, then asked us if we wanted to use them. We said yes, gave her cash and asked for change. She came back and said, ""here's your change"" and dropped it on the table and left. No ""thank you for coming in"" or anything. So there went her tip. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the hostess and manager were nice."
Delmer B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",5,2,1,5.0,11/26/2012,The personal pizzas are good. But the pumpkin beer is the best I've had.
Mark H.,"Huntsville, AL",72,59,4,4.0,9/7/2012,A very impressive beer selection for a restaurant and their in house brew is high quality.  I enjoyed the Oktoberfest several times.  The pizza was very good and everyone that ate there enjoyed their food.  I will definitely be back.
Kyle C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/19/2013,"Typically I'm a fan of BJ's, however not this location at all.  I have been here multiple times hoping the poor service, cold food, rude staff was just a temporary thing. NOT the case in anyway.  I've never left this restaurant happy or satisfied. after my last trip, which was not my choice of restaurants, definitely will not return again."
Ben C.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,17,,4.0,1/21/2010,"Not being from Roseville, but passing through on the way to some powdery bliss, I happened to stop here recently. This place was quite good for what it was.  The food was nice, a strong step above a Chili's or similar.  Our service this day was a little delayed, but there was honest acknowledgement of this and they seemed sincerely contrite.  The atmosphere is like a good modern sports bar with large screens behind the bar for easy viewing.  One screen is 4x block of LCDs.  So know that this is what you are going in for when going. Me likey. So if your hungry and on your way from Sacramento to Tahoe, this place is a good bet.  It's right off I-80. Oh, and they've got good beer!"
Laura W.,"Sacramento, CA",48,158,8,1.0,8/14/2009,"I generally try to avoid all Roseville restaurants by matter of principle. I don't understand the desire to eat at crowded, loud, sub-par restaurants with poor service and huge parking lots that are so full you have to factor in time to walk from your car to the restaurant in order to be on time to meet friends. And that's almost what I always get in Roseville, and my experience at BJ's was no different. I was with a large group of about 16, and I know that makes it a little harder on the waiters, thus the ""large group gratuity"" they charge, but how hard is it to refill someone's drink? Apparently very hard for the BJ wait staff. My husband's water was empty for at least 20 minutes when mine also became empty and I asked the waiter for more water. Apparently he didn't hear me, so someone at our table got up, found him at the charge station, and requested water. Then we waited. And waited. When a waiter came back, we asked again. Two of us, in fact. No water. Finally the next time a waiter came by and we asked AGAIN, we finally got water.  Maybe we were discriminated against for not ordering alcoholic drink after alcoholic drink like our friends. A shot of vanilla Vodka is $6.50, by the way. But the waiter also brought a friend the wrong alcoholic drink, and another friend, the wrong dish. So maybe they're just incompetent. My friend ordered a pasta dish with chicken. The waiter asked, ""Grilled or blackened?"" She said grilled. Her dish came without chicken. When she brought it up to the waiter his excuse was, ""Oh, we didn't discuss the chicken, so I didn't know you wanted it."" Ummmm.... Maybe he caught a case of Amnesia and that's why he couldn't remember the orders? My food, the angel hair toscana, would have been good if it had enough sauce on it. I almost asked for more sauce, but considering I spent half the night trying to get a drink refill, I didn't feel it was worth the hassle.  My husband enjoyed his $10 club sandwich, just not the trumped up price. As a large party, we were put at several square tables pushed together to create a long rectangular table. It was crowded, we could barely get in and out of our chairs or talk to someone more than a couple seats down.  I'd go back if someone else paid because I'm not one to pass up a free meal. Barring that, I'll never go back."
Mike S.,"Roseville, CA",1,9,2,1.0,2/24/2012,bad service okay food with all the choices of restaurants in roseville DO NOT MAKE THIS ONE OF THEM
Adam O.,"West Sacramento, CA",75,161,8,4.0,3/22/2012,"Pretty much the same as any of the other BJ's in the area.  You know you are going to get really good food and service.  The drinks can be somewhat watered down at times, but the beer is always good."
Brittany M.,"Grass Valley, CA",2,67,,4.0,2/15/2012,"I've been here several times with family and the food and service are always very good! The beer is excellent! Everything I've ordered from the menu here has been very tasty, but the pizza is exceptional! Try the Mediterannean! Their lunch specials are VERY nicely priced - I ate lunch here a couple weeks ago for under $6 and it was more food than I could even finish!!! Is the food the most mindblowing culinary experience ever? No, but then again this is a glorified sports bar so you really just come here mostly for the atmosphere and the selection, not a world class dining experience."
Maren A.,"Davis, CA",16,7,,4.0,10/24/2010,"I'm a regular here and have a lot of favorites off the menu -- especially the Mediterranean pizza, and clam chowder, which is served in a perfectly-toasted sourdough bowl. The berry cider and BJ's Root Beer are great drinks if you've got a sweet tooth like me (they make their own root beer and the mixed drink version includes butterscotch schnapps and Bailey's). Every guy I know adores the chili cheeseburger, which is almost too big for one person, and the calzones. The lunch specials are pretty good deals, and my friends all like the salads and sandwiches. Service is always friendly and prompt, even when they're slammed. Definitely suggest calling ahead on a Friday or Saturday night, or my favorite, calling in a to-go order and eating at your own place, since it can get pretty noisy and crowded."
Kandi S.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,32,,1.0,11/20/2013,"I will NOT waste my money or time on going back here again. The food has gone downhill the longer they have been opened. The waiter was nice enough, but he had an area way too large for just himself to handle! We ordered 2 appetizers, and received only ONE and that was AFTER the main dishes came out! A pseudo manager came over and offered a blank apology that was just words he HAD to say, then said he would remove the appetizer from our bill, like he was doing US a courtesy of removing something we never got! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PLACE!"
Patti R.,"Sacramento, CA",105,549,113,3.0,12/7/2009,"Had lunch here yesterday at about 12:30 p.m. In spite of the hour, the restaurant was only about 1/4 full. Although I enjoy BJ's food and beer, their service has always been up and down. This visit was no different. Others around us who were seated after, were getting their food, and we were still on our 1,000th refill. It took two inquires for our food to arrive, and when it did there was a HAIR in my companions drink and he later found one in his baked potato! Back it went, and the mgr offered us another, but we explained about the long wait and he told us 'it couldn't be helped' and that it would take 'a little while' to get a replacement. Very disappointing. This was our first trip to this location and I am willing to give it a second chance. I just really hope they get it together....I really like their beer!"
Brie L.,"Kaneohe, HI",43,1,,4.0,3/31/2012,The Parmesan chicken with a lemon butter sauce over white cheddar mashed potatoes was excellent.  The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was someone took my food to the wrong table so I had to wait for them to make me a new one.  The server an manager both came to the table to apologize and I appreciated the follow up.  That is great service recovery from a fumble.
Debi S.,"Vermilion, OH",29,44,1,1.0,7/15/2009,"I used to love BJ's. Until my birthday. The waitress handed drinks over the head of my grand-daughter, which resulted in her being drenched on one side in my daughter's cantaloupe martini & the other in beer. No apology was given either.  It goes from bad to worse, Our food took forever coming out. We waited nearly 45 minutes, watching others who were seated AFTER getting their food, while we still waited. My husband finally asked the manager what was taking so long and all of a sudden there was our food, right after inquiring. ICE COLD!  I've decided not to go back. I'm done with them. We didnt receive an apology or anything. We were treated as an inconvenience. So we have decided not to incovenience them with our business or our money."
Jessica H.,"Roseville, CA",35,14,2,5.0,1/4/2012,Don't know how many times I've been and its always great. Lettuce wraps are awesome. Beers aren't anything special but good... They just need to stop waxing t he floors... I've slipped so many times... Hahah
Jerran H.,"Carmichael, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/12/2013,"Excellent and friendly service.  Met up with some family this last weekend, and while a little crowded, they made every effort in getting our party comfortable.  The food was excellent, and the prices very reasonable.  And of course, the beer was fantastic!"
Snookie I.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,18,,2.0,1/6/2014,I keep going back to this restaurant not because I want but out of default.  I really hope the food would get better but it doesn't.  Sad because they have a great variety of food.  The secret behind a so-so restaurant is to not have the food taste out of a box.  They haven't figured this one out yet.  Only reason 2star is because the bar...great beer selection.  Eat at your own risk
