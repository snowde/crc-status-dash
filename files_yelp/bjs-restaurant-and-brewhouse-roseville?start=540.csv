Jenna B.,"Roseville, CA",168,36,35,5.0,5/13/2012,"I love this BJs. Mojito night with  my buddy has become a tradition here - it's our favorite drink! Favorite foods are the Great White pizza, the calamari, the white cheddar mashed potatoes, the stuffed mushrooms, and the chicken fettuchini alfredo! Yum!"
Susan S.,"Colfax, CA",5,11,10,5.0,8/7/2010,"Fresh, quality food. Varied menu, comparable pricing. Whatever your pleasure, you will find something to tingle your taste buds. Attentive, friendly staff. Excellent service The desserts are limited to a very few ice cream topped items, cookie, brownie, and apple crisp, however, the food is so good and plentiful, who needs dessert.  I look forward to a return visit."

Ruth C.,"Roseville, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/9/2014,I had lunch yesterday with four other ladies. Ordered five cider beers that came out cool and flat. It took 45 minutes to get our food and it was not busy. Server was barely seen throughout our meal. Food portion was very disappointing. The manager did remove our  beers from bill since they were having a problem with their beer cooler. Overall experience was disappointing. I've always have been a big fan of this restaurant so I'm hoping they get it turned around. Based on ratings lately it's not looking good.
Valerie G.,"Antelope, CA",4,6,,2.0,9/20/2012,"Went to BJs with a small group of friends to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived about 6:00 on a Wednesday and were seated within a few minutes.  Too bad that this was the highlight of the service at BJs. The waitress that took our order must have practiced saying ""I'm sorry"" to the point that is a permanent part of her vocabulary.  I counted at least 30 ""I'm sorry's"" last night.  She took our drink order and everytime she repeated something incorrectly, she said ""I'm sorry. Sorry"".  We ended up giving her our dinner order at the same time, as we were not ordering appetizers.  One girl at our table ordered a pepperoni, mushroom and olive pizza.  She says ""Okay, pepperoni and sausage.""  The girl said ""No, pepperoni, mushroom and black olive.""  ""Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.""   She came back about 15 minutes later with the wrong soda, diet instead of regular, and did not bring my glass of wine.  ""I'm sorry. Sorry. I'll be right back with a regular soda and your wine. Sorry.  They seated all of my tables at once. Sorry.""  Okay, I didn't really need to know why she was screwing up, but I guess she wanted to tell us.  Twenty minutes later, the soda and wine were served.  She sent the manager over to apologize and I asked for a second glass of wine, which was delivered promptly. Our food was delivered and yup, the pizza was a pepperoni and sausage.  We sent it back and this prompted another visit from the manager who told us they would need to ""fire up a new one"" and ""Sorry about that.""  The food that we ordered was good, but the service was REALLY off. We received the bill and there was not one thing comped.  A couple of folks from our party excused themselves and spoke to the manager.  They did take the cost of the pizza ($20) off the bill and I received a gift card that would be worth anywhere from $5.00 to $500.00, but I wouldn't know until I return for another visit.  Nice. This place needs to provide better training for their staff.  Hearing ""I'm sorry. Sorry"" a bazillion times during service does not make up for the long waits and mistakes.  Get with it, BJs."
Tina F.,"San Clemente, CA",209,160,81,4.0,3/7/2012,"Great place to go to when your having a late dinner & every other restaurants around 95765 are closed! Service is very good, food is average."
Nicole C.,"Sacramento, CA",33,85,1,4.0,4/11/2012,"Went there last night for a birthday dinner, the food was really good i tried the pot stickers and Thai glazed chicken and the chicken club flat bread (we ordered a bunch of appetizers) and it was all really good i had a strawberry mojito which was  delicious. its a little pricey and it was packed on a Tuesday night. service was good didn't have to wait long for anything and the server was good at recommending drinks."
Stacey R.,"Pinole, CA",34,3,1,2.0,8/26/2012,"My family and I love BJ's so while out of town we went to the one is Roseville, and we were disappointed :( The service its self was ok but not sure why as we were done we got a new server. First we got soup and salad and soup was COLD Then the food came out 3 burgers and the southern fried chicken My mash potatoes cold husband fries Cold and our daughters friend didnt get her fries untill we got our recooks. My husband burger was very pink inside and we ordered MW. We didnt sent the burger back but a manager did come over and say sorry. That was it to say sorry.  We will not go back to the Bjs in Roseville"
Kelson P.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",53,105,135,4.0,3/3/2012,Good Good Good. First time there just had a few appetizers and a few long Islands. I liked it alot. We will be back for sure.
L G.,"Roseville, CA",107,32,14,5.0,2/28/2012,"... As good as it gets!!! Last night my fiance' and I had dinner at BJ's and we both ordered from there new seafood menu.  We both chose the Creole Tilapia for which we both agreed was very good.  I'm also excited that BJ's also does not charge a corkage fee; we brought our own bottle of wine which we both really enjoy & it complimented our entree.  The first bottle no corkage... a second bottle $7.  This one aspect of there service for me moved them from 4 stars to 5 stars.  BTW, our service was impeccable - will definitely be my go-to restaurant!!!"
Brooke W.,"Valley Ford, CA",0,16,10,2.0,2/28/2014,"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend and his parents on a Wednesday night, surprisingly enough it was packed. Could have been due to the super rainy weather. Anyways, we get inside and wait by the hostess stand for a good 2 or 3 minutes without any sort of recognition by the 3 chatty staff standing 4 feet away from us. Once they did notice us, the girl goes ""Have you put in your name yet?"" And my boyfriends mom goes ""No we haven't."" Then the girl proceeds to say ""Oh well if you could have come around (literally 6 inches from where we were standing) here, I can take your name."" Uh girl, if you weren't chatting away with your coworker you would have notice us. We ended up sitting near the bar with the tall tables and chairs, which was fine with us. Took a couple minutes for a waiter to come around, which was fine with us since it was so busy, and I work in a restaurant so I know how it goes. Took about 5 minutes to have a waiter come over. She was nice, took our orders and brought our waters. My boyfriend and I got bison burgers, which were really good we thought, my boyfriends dad got fish and chips and his mom got the salmon I believe which she thought was really bland and boring. Half way through eating, our server was going on her dinner break, so she handed us off to another guy. He was alright. Finished eating and it took 10 minutes for someone to take our empty plates..... Alrighty then. Overall the experience was alright, can't really expect much from a chain restaurant though. Instead, why not try a locally owned restaurant and help out with the local economy instead of wasting your money at commercially owned BS."
Brian L.,"San Jose, CA",59,76,,5.0,4/5/2010,"Last night was my 2nd time coming to this BJ's location and it was great again. It was busy but not as busy as I expected it to be for it being Easter and all.  My overall experiece was great from the staff to the food to the beer. Parm crusted chicken is awesome with the cheddar mashed potatoes nom nom nom and obviously you need to get a Pizookie for dessert also very nomamable. The beer I get here is the Pirhana pale ale, not a big fan of Pale Ales but if you don't like Sierra Nevada pale ale you will probably like this one. Once again a good place to eat and drink!"
Jennifer S.,"Mountain View, CA",64,464,8,4.0,2/6/2012,This was my first time visiting a BJ's and I was not disappointed.  I got the berry cider which was very tasty but the alcohol content was a bit low.  I got a half sandwhich and half salad which was a smaller portion than I thought.  The turkey cobb sandwhich was delicious and I liked the wedge fries.  The wedge salad was very interesting as it was literally a wedge.  I would have gotten the other choice of a salad.  It was a good experience despite the wait which happened because there were two tables of kids going to homecoming dances and birthday tables.
Lissa B.,"Roseville, CA",58,79,16,3.0,7/17/2009,"My husband and I usually come here for Happy Hour and it's usually crowded which is expected. We come here for their 1/2 off appetizers and discounted beer.  My favorite is their PM Porter.   Their pizzas are pretty good. I've tasted almost all of them.  Of course you can't forget their pizookies.  The Godiva one is to die for. We've had a great time when we come here.  When we bring our son, we usually come early for lunch to avoid big crowds."
Lori J.,"Sacramento, CA",93,118,11,4.0,10/2/2011,"I like BJs because of the beer.  :)  Everyone can find something they like on the menu.  I've tried several different items.  I really liked the Barbacoa tacos, the steak salad, and the flat bread pizzas.  The bar area is large with lots of seating for large groups or couples.  There is a wall of tvs to keep up with whatever game is on.  The bar is comfortable enough to go alone or with a partner.  The ambiance is casual, yet nice enough to take a date.  Overall, BJs is a great choice!"
Cristina K.,"Tustin, CA",8,108,1,1.0,6/30/2013,"Just ate there today for lunch and ordered the Thai shrimp lettuce wrap. It tasted ok. The shrimp tasted cold but I figured it was suppose to taste like that since it is kind of like a salad. I just got home and can we say, ""FOOD POISONING?!"" I'm so disappointed. The last thing you think when you eat at a restaurant is that you will get sick. :("
Nate C.,"Roseville, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/17/2014,"The service at this restaurant is horrible.  I like the  food which is why I've endured the poor service but never again.   We went in for lunch on a weekday and it took us almost an hour and half.  The horrible part is we didn't wait more than a couple of minutes to get seated.  The staff just flat out ignores you, every time you need something you have waive someone down and even then good luck on them bringing you what you asked for.  You know it's equally bad for the rest of the customers when walk past their tables and see everyone with their credit card on the table waiting to pay.  Whoever is running this place needs to find a new line of work."
Norm H.,"Wheatland, CA",140,90,12,5.0,1/21/2009,"Recommended but go early or call ahead for a table... this place is always packed!  The food was good, service was great but the wait was long.  We arrived around 7pm and waited a hour for a table.  While we waited... they gave us free pizza slices to appease the time...outstanding!!!  ...and yum!   So then... we got a table.  I ordered the ""famous meatloaf""... never had meatloaf outside of home or the chow hall... wanted to try meatloaf from the experts (that is... not that my wife is not an expert meatloaf queen in her own sense).  Anyways, the gurls had the Cajun Pasta and Mom got the Grilled Burger Melt.   My meatloaf was good... ok I was not awed!  At least my dinner tasted homemade!  Mom enjoyed her burger and the pasta was also nice... very tender, not spicy and full of flavor.   To finish, we got the ...tada!  ...the ""pizookie""!  Very nice! ...except for one fatal flaw...  the cookie under the cold ice cream became so hard that it stuck to the bottom of the pan.  To finish off the rest of the cookie, you'll need a ""jackhammer""!   I know this... as I watched my three kids pry the rest of the desert off the pan with a spoon...  and of course, what do you think happens next when the cookie finally gives... flying melted ice cream and mushy cookie crumbs all over everyone within range!!!  ...ugh!   Enjoy your meal!"
Darren M.,"Sacramento, CA",92,507,35,5.0,11/1/2009,"SOO much better than surrounding BJ's .  as always delicious !! can't say too much more , calzones rock me !"
Stacey C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",110,110,34,4.0,3/4/2009,"So, I'm not really a Roseville person but I got an opportunity to try this place I'd been hearing about, so the hubby and I set off on our Friday night adventure with visions of exotic beers and other libations dancing in our heads.  WOW, we walk in and instantly just love the layout and feel of the place.  It's large without feeling overwhelming, nice high ceilings, good acoustics, attractive decor..just a place you want to be.  On the TV screens(which are large but not obnoxiously so) there is basketball, football, golf, soccer, nascar, rugby and even cricket...a sport for everyone!  Our bartenders were nice, but did slack off a bit giving us our receipts, didn't offer to explain about the beer menu, lots of personal chit chat going on etc.  and I had heard that BJ's staff will sit you down if you've never been before and give you a run down of all their beers.  They did recognize their obvious regulars. But it was Friday night and we were out having fun so...bygones.  We ordered the darkest of the darks, a Tatonka Stout and it was divine.  Rich, malty with a bitter bite.   We wanted some munchies and my husband who is a picky eater wanted chips and salsa.  I was a little bummed, wanting something a bit more exciting, but I quickly changed my mind when the order arrived.  There was a variety of warm, fully salted chips in red, white and blue corn, and the salsa was actually fire roasted, you could tell by the taste.  This appetizer was so much better than I thought it would be.  Prices are cheap too which is appreciated.  I think the beer was about $3.95 and the chips and salsa were not much if anything above that. We had not anticipated having dinner, but after about an hour and a half we were starting to get hungry.  The place was packed with people out the door so the hubby grabbed a pager and we waited an additional 45 minutes..not too bad since we still had beer and chips to munch on.  For dinner we both ordered the NY strip steaks..we were in full indulgence mode. Both steaks come with a side, and I chose a baked potato, the hubby chose shoestring fries.  When the entrees arrived, OMG the potato was as big as my head with all the fixings.  The steak was cooked absolutely perfectly and was DELICIOUS.  Needless to say I took a few bites and was full, so BJ's fed me for breakfast and lunch the next day too.  I was super bummed that we were too full to try the Pizookie for dessert.  Next time for sure!  The only bad thing which will probably prevent my husband from coming back with me..or at least I'll have to drive, is that someone keyed all the way down the side of his new mustang while we were there.  My advice to anyone who goes is that you park in the main parking lot out front.  The way we went in was a weird way and we ended up parking on the side..it looked like it may have been where the employees park? Anyhow, it was a little less populated with people(yet full of cars) so next time we'll park closer, in MY car."
