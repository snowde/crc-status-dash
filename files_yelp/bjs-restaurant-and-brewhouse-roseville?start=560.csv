Nick C.,"Sacramento, CA",42,127,15,3.0,4/22/2009,"This place is okay, very large and definitely a chain restaurant.  GF and I ordered the following: Me:  Hefeweizen, Salad with Blue Cheese and Shrimp Scampi GF:  Purple Martini, Salad with Vinaigrette and Angel Hair Toscana To share:  Avocado Egg Rolls (Cheesecake Factory's are WAY better if you like these). The servings of pasta were RIDICULOUS.  I hate when you get so much pasta that it can feed 8 people.  There was barely any shrimp and not much in terms of true 'Scampi' flavor in the piles of limp, lifeless, WAY past Al Dente pasta.  The GF's was pretty bland as well, when it should not have been considering what the menu promised (Feta Cheese, Fresh Parmesan, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Garlic, Basil, etc.).  Again a mountainous pile of pasta.   The beer was good, but I would rather go to Pyramid Alehouse and drink their beer and eat their food.  The purple martini was good though!  So I think that the bar situation might be better than the food. I have heard so many good things from co-workers, so maybe I was actually expecting awesome food - sorry that I have expectations.  It just didn't hit the high marks that everyone raves about.  It is just middle of the road.  Thankfully I had a gift card to pay for the meal.  The GF and I will probably not be returning, unless we come with a big group of friends and belly up to the bar only."
George T.,"Battle Ground, WA",55,12,6,5.0,2/29/2012,"Good waitresses, Controlled Environment, Great food. Come here for a good time ;-)"
Paul V.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,,3.0,8/13/2012,"My experience echoes what others have said... The food was good, the service bad. If they can properly train the waiters, or hire more people, this place could probably get more business."
Kimber P.,"Roseville, CA",6,26,2,3.0,2/27/2010,"When this place opened, it was way better.  Their corporate offices are kinda screwing them, removing things from the menu that sold well because they would overshadow the new flatbreads.   I used to love to order the cilantro pesto pizza, talk about something you absolutely couldn't find anywhere else, thin crust, not too much cheese, little bits of tomato and very savory.  Now you can only order their flatbreads, I hope they end that test menu soon. To me, it's not a test if you whack the items already on the menu that are better.  They just stuffed the ballots by not having anything else on the menu to compete with the test menu items (boring flatbreads, don't order them)."
Kristin E.,"Sacramento, CA",16,147,9,3.0,6/2/2011,I havent been dissapointed or blown away by the food here. But I have to say... the Pozokie is AMAZING!!!
Jade W.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,40,,5.0,5/17/2014,"Fun place to eat for one time per year!  Mostly everything is fried if you don't mind having a heart attack early on in life.  Great food, but not for me.  Not into unhealthy fried food but nice, again, if you like to consume this type of meal."
Trish T.,"Rocklin, CA",318,30,1,5.0,3/19/2012,I took a friend here tonight for her birthday dinner. I've only been here once when they first opened and I wasn't impressed. Tonight I walked in and it was so warm and inviting. Every staff member was so nice and my dinner was amazing. I can't wait to go back with my husband!
Caitlin D.,"Castro Valley, CA",8,77,5,3.0,3/1/2009,"I've been to the one in Vacaville and the cookie with ice cream on top was really good!   I went to the one in Roseville and I got the turkey sandwich with avocado added on top.  First of all, they barely add any avocado on for the price they charge.  The sandwich was huge!  Tons of turkey on it.  It looked good and then when I picked it up, almost immediately, the bread fell apart into pieces.  I got the larger fries and they were pretty good."
Mark M.,"Roseville, CA",20,13,4,4.0,3/4/2012,Really good! Love the huge baked potatoes! I would have given it 5 stars but we had a problem with our food. I gave it 4 stars because the manager made it good he was very professional and took care of us.
Don B.,"Antelope, CA",39,30,,2.0,6/7/2011,"I've never been a fan of BJ's primarily because of the service. Sundays experience started out pretty good. Our server was nice, upbeat and attentive. She did a great job, unfortunately she had to take a break and her relief was TERRIBLE!! She had the attitude that she was ""too good"" to be a server and since she wasn't getting the tip from our party why bother. I had to flag her down to get a refill on my beverage. She took our dessert order and while delivering it stopped to walk 4 tables away to collect empty plates with my sisters pizookie in her hand. Returned to our table with and arm load of dirty plates from the other table and plops the last dessert down. The manager stopped by once and appeared to be clueless. ""Hi I'm the manager just stopping by ti say HI, everything ok?"" We asked for separate checks our relief server had no idea how to do it. ""Just write down a 1,2 and so on next to what you want to be charged for"" The restrooms were trashed, my grand-daughter slipped and fell on the flooded floor. We told the manager ""Oh, I had no idea"". Needless to say BJ's continued their reputation of lousy service."
J G.,"Auburn, CA",0,31,8,5.0,2/29/2012,"Michelle, the bartender was perfect. I don't need much. Acknowledge me within a few minutes. Answer initial questions. Bring me what I ask for and check in after a few minutes. Check if I need anything more then bring the bill. Do this with a warm smile. The smile is just a warm fuzzy bonus. Great service isn't rocket science but so few places do it well. It looked like BJ's had service guidelines popping up on the computer screen. Maybe it takes constant reminding. Well, Bravo. The two times I've been here the service has really impressed me. The burger was cooked quickly and to a perfect medium rare. I walked out of another restaurant tonight because the bartender was too busy on his cell phone to notice me."
Ashu N.,"Jackson, CA",0,17,,1.0,11/25/2012,"One of my favorite places to eat, especially because of the variety in the menu...but I honestly, cannot stand this location. I am sorry to say, but most of the waitresses (not waiters) lack quality customer service. Been here many times due to location and the party room, but last night was the worst service I have ever received at this place. Busy Saturday night as usual, understandable.  We was taken to a table that wasn't picked up yet and was ask to wait for a few mins. Yet the tables next to us was being clean but not ours? We had to wait. Ok, fine, no big deal. Waitress comes and asks us about drinks and makes suggestions. I told her we do not drink alcohol. Then she stated, she would let us look at the menu and come back. She comes back, takes our drink orders and takes her 10 mins to bring back water. Meanwhile, she is taking orders from the table next to us who came in after us! My friend made a comment stating ""I think she is treating us differently""...I states, ""oh no, why would someone do that?"" She comes back taking our orders, with no smile no anything, didnt even take our full order and starts walking away. I asked her if she would also start and appeitizer for us. She went away, table after us got served before us and I started noticing she was treating us different. I seen her at two different tables and her facial expressions and her monotone was very different.  As we waited for our food, not once did she come back and check on our drinks. I had ordered coffee, and it seemed it was an inconvience for her to get us coffee but it was ok for the table across from us. When I asked for a refill, she was at the table next to us. That is when she informed us the pizza which was the appeitizer was going to be a few more mins. She returns with cold coffee, no creamer and walks away before I can ask for some. She later comes back with all our food that was ordered at the same time, and just sets it on the table and walks off without asking if we needed anything else. Yet, again, my table is sitting there observing her with the table next to us and across from us. It took her ten mins to come back and ask if we needed anything, I asked for warm coffee and sauce for my pizza. The coffee refill never came, but my sauce did.  Finally, I got the hint, she did not want to serve us when she came with a check to our table and yet didnt let us get dessert? She put the check on the table, then states, ""This is your check, please stand it up when your ready."" about a good 30 seconds later she adds, ""Unless you want dessert."" Yet we have no dessert menu! and she already has our check ready? I was so confused and dazed by what was just happening. Especially, when I heard her asking the table next to us about dessert and making suggestions! I was soo upset! My friend said, he had noticed it all along, but thought he was just being picky. This waitress for some reason did not want to serve us, I dont know why, I really dont want to know why, but it is very unacceptable and I would surely remind my friends not to eat here if possible. I love the food, but not the service at this location. I wish I knew her name to file a complaint right then and there, even saw the manager in the blue shirt walking up and down the isles. But my friend did not want to make a scene.  To the girl who did not get a tip from us tonight, you are lucky I didnt have the time to sit there and write how rude you was being to us on that recepit. I work in customer service and I could not believe the type of service you gave us without any reason behind it. And I know that because you never served us before, nor could you have anything against us. I am very sadden that our night was ruined. I've always tipped bad service, but this was just too much."
C C.,"Roseville, CA",0,22,,3.0,6/7/2012,"Came here with my family for my birthday for the first time dining at this restaurant.  For a Wednesday night it was PACKED as if it were a Saturday night. Our wait time was over 20 mins. Okay, whatever. Lets get back to the point now. We ordered the appetizer sampler. I tried the avocado egg rolls. I have to say, that was one of the BEST appetizers I've ever had! I had a little bit of the chips and spinach dip. Also really good. I ordered the Hawaiian Ma hi Ma hi with pineapple fried rice. The taste of the meal was delicious, however it was lukewarm, almost cool when it was served to me. I like my meals hot to the point where I have to blow on the first few bites, but being as crowded and busy as it was, I just shook it off and let it go, because I didn't want to be the only one waiting for a redo of my meal. The Ma hi Ma hi must have been a little overcooked too because it had more of a ""dry chicken texture""  instead of a moist flakey fish texture. Definitely different than what I'm use to!  I had a Pizookie for dessert too (hot chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top). Very good! Stuck to the plate tho. Our waiter was a little ""off"" too. Usually they ask for your drink order in the beginning, but it wasn't the case at all! He was also pretty expressionless , seemed pretty shy and nervous.  I think I would come back here, maybe try a Monday night. The menu is HUGE so theres a lot more I would like to try. I didn't even try their DRINKS yet, not even for my birthday! Why? Wasn't feeling all that great."
Jen L.,"Sacramento, CA",63,39,91,2.0,5/24/2011,"Oh BJs...you failed me this time. Went here last night with my husband because we were hungry after shopping at Westfield galleria. I ordered chip & salsa for apetizer and it was not good. The salsa was too sour and it wasn't spicy enough for our taste. For my entree I ordered the Ahi salad, the dressing was too overpowering and the Ahi was not fresh even though the portion is pretty big for $12 bucks. My husband ordered the ribs and that was delicious. I was not a happy camper afterwards because I didn't really enjoy my dinner."
Timothy B.,"Beaumont, CA",3,18,,5.0,3/20/2011,"I love BJ's.  Their deep dish pizzas are great.  Pizookie's are even better for your desert.  Often times there might be a wait, but generally we get in quickly.   It can be noisy as in all BJ's.  However, if you love the food it is worth it.   The service is usually great as well."
Jennifer V.,"Sacramento, CA",34,8,,5.0,12/8/2013,Finally gave BJ's another try and I'm glad I did! My husband and I were waited on my Brandon a couple of weeks ago and he is by far one of the best servers I've had in a really long time. We came for pizza and drinks and after we ordered he let us know about a special that saved us about $20. He obviously didn't have to tell us since a smaller bill doesn't help the servers tip but we we really appreciate that he took the time to let us know. Even though he was pretty busy that night he made sure that we were taken care the whole night. Awesome service!! We will definitely come back because of Brandon's service.
chris c.,"Chicago, IL",128,173,,3.0,8/1/2011,Food is meh. Beer selection is above average.
Dan C.,"Pleasanton, CA",413,133,63,3.0,6/28/2011,The Fried Chicken Alfredo plate over noodles here is the BEST i've had in a long while Pleasant surprise.  The service was a helter-skelter but that may have been because we had 13 people...
Karen L.,"Folsom, CA",9,11,6,2.0,10/4/2013,"I love the food and have typically had a decent experience, but tonight is another story. I ordered over the phone for take out. Silly me, I didn't check the bag before I left (which really, I shouldn't have to do) and after getting all the way home, found that I was missing A LOT of what I ordered. Wanted 2 mahi taco orders - only got one, without salsa or guacamole. Ordered pizooki with ice cream - got just the cookie. Where's the quality assurance. Totally bummed and hungry."
Bobby S.,"Roseville, CA",38,36,6,4.0,10/29/2008,Some times there is a really large line out front but i have eaten there many times. I must be lucky because I have never had a long wait. And you can always go an eat at the bar they have nice tables in there.  Each time I have gone I have ordered something different. From pizza to the crispy chicken sandwich to a chopped salad. Everything was delicious. you really must try the bbq chicken chopped salad its great...
