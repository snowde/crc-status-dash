Jim B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/8/2012,"I went there for lunch and  I ordered a salad and a classic burger, medium, no cheese, but with onion and shoe string fries. The waitress bartender said, I'll just order it medium well if that's okay?  I thought that was odd, but whatever.  I'm pretty sure I know why she said that, which I'll explain later.   No less than 5 minutes after giving the bartender my order, the food delivery person came up and asked if I had the burger  with no onion (this plate had wedge cut fries).  I told that I didn't order mine without onions, but he guy next to me, he had just been given the same style burger, said that must have been his because he ordered his without onions and the one he just bit into had onions, in addition, he asked for wedge cut fries.   I could see the bar tender was thinking the same thing I was, that the orders got messed up, but what's more is, I told the gal, that wasn't my burger and I hadn't even gotten the salad I had , JUST, ordered!  So the bartender tells the food delivery person that mine just needed onions, but first a salad and to follow her back.   So I'm thinking, if she thinks I'm going to take a burger, that the paddy was probably already precooked. How else could the burger have been done in five min of my ordering and why was the bartender insisting it be medium well?? Because the precooked the patties for the lunch rush???   So I get my salad, it was fine and the bartender says, we're remaking  your burger so it doesn't sit back there, but within 4, minutes later,  I haven't even finished my salad, the same gal brings out a burger, the same one(???), but this time, it's with shoestring fries, but again, NO ONION! So I say, this doesn't have onions, is this the same one that you just tried giving me 4 minutes ago? And I can the see the bartender is freaked and she says, she doesn't know what they would have done back there and she'll handle this.  Well she comes right back out with the burger, this time with onions, and tells me that she spoke to the general manager and he assured her it was a new burger. Really, the general manager is overseeing my burger?   So I cut the burger in half and it's well done and just above room temp.  I was so disgusted at the little game they were playing save a buck or two, that I didn't even bother eating and I just paid the and left.   I won't be back there as a place that is trying to save a buck-fifty  by reserving  hamburger patty for an $11 burger is surely going to skimp on quality other places as well.  No thanks BJ's."

Amy Y.,"Roseville, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/21/2014,"I have been very disappointed with this location lately.  Yesterday my family came in for an early dinner. (4pm on a Sunday, definitely not a busy time)  My boyfriend found a piece of plastic in his pasta, not very appetizing. He sat there waiting for a new one while the rest of our party enjoyed their entrees.  When the bill came, the pasta was still on there.  I felt like it was unfair for him to have chewed on a piece of plastic, watched everyone eat while his plate was remade and then pay full price for something that was entirely not his fault.  This is not the first time this has happened.  The last time we were in the server dropped my grandpa's plate on the floor and he waited for 10-15 for his food to be remade while everyone ate and again the entree showed up on the bill. Managers knew of both of these occurences and did nothing make the situations better. We will not be returning to this location, because I feel like the management team doesn't try to take care of its guests.  It seems more important to them to save a few dollars then to creating lasting clientele."
Rich R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",3,29,,2.0,3/8/2013,"I was dissapointed with my experience here. I don't usually frequent BJ's cause I think there are better places for pizza in the area, but decided to give it a shot since I received a birthday coupon for a free pazooki dessert. Plus, I always wonder why there are usually allot of people waiting outside when I drive by. So when I got there I was by myself so I wanted to sit at the bar. I found a spot at the end of the bar closest to the bathroom side. It took a little while to be acknowledged by the bartenders. I finally got a menu and once again waited for one of them to take my order. So I ordered one of there beer sampler's and a California Club flatbread pizza. The beer was what I expected it to be which was ok and the pizza was good. Nothing to extraordinary. But the real problem I had was there were two servers who had obviously had relations and decided they were going to argue right there and then. The male server was obviously really aggressive and wouldn't let the female server do her work until he got his words in. Not the place or the time for that crap. That's why you never hook up with someone at work, it's an unwritten rule that they obviously did not know about. The male server even came up to me and appologized since I was in ear shot, but little did he know that I block out negative drama like that. So then I was ready for my free dessert and was happily surprised that I had different options of flavors of cookies and ice cream. But, I just wanted the regular chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. So after a while someone brought me my pazookie and I realized it was a tiny little cookie with a small portion of ice cream. You would think with the business that they get that they could at least give you a full size portion like allot of other restaurants do. But even worse, it was chocalate ice cream with a peanut butter cookie. The bartender told me that they ran out of vanilla ice cream and thought I would like this combo! Who runs out of vanilla ice cream???? So after all is said and done, the service was sub-par, the food was ok, and I couldn't even get what I came there for in the first place. Not sure if I would go there again on purpouse since there is better pizza places in the area. The customer comes first and left feeling like they had plenty of business and didn't care if I had a bad experience. Oh well, on to the next restaurant!!!!"
Kay M.,"Folsom, CA",0,6,1,2.0,9/27/2013,"Slowest service ever. :-( Food is ok though, I like their pizzas and pizookies. Would much rather prefer Chicago fire though."
Tim A.,"Sloughhouse, CA",45,85,2,1.0,6/10/2014,I can excuse just about anything when comes to great food and I mean fantastic food. If Denny's was the bar I was setting Bj's would have come in a close second to food and service but killed on price.  Calamari was tasteless rubber I think the managers need a trip to the coast to get a real taste of how calamari should taste and be prepared. This is your job and you should be expecting more and demand better of the staff and kitchen. Hey maybe turn off the sports shows and learn something by watching a cooking show it can't get any worst. Hamburger ordered medium came well done burnt and not just on the crust but actually burnt through excellent quality control! Server never returned with anything we needed that we ordered without asking for it 2-3 times to everyone around. The french dip had old dried out beef that actually had burnt crust on the edges of the roast beef so it was so dry and tasteless it could have been three weeks old. Then to skimp on the Au Ju  sauce made it even worst. The cheese just made it sadder. Managers go to Trancas Steak House in Napa it's not that far but order a french dip then go into your database of everyone that has ordered this from Bjs and send them their money back with an apology. 55 minute wait was only 15 minutes but I wish I had just left and gone to anywhere else so do yourself the favor and blow this joint off they will be closing soon enough. It's one and out for me but who knows what America will put up with!!!
J M.,"Rocklin, CA",0,27,,2.0,1/24/2014,"Really, really noisy. Place is always packed although I haven't quite figured out why. Food is average. The people watching is kind of fun...I guess. Mostly families."
Three XL T.,"Fremont, CA",14,125,2,4.0,4/3/2009,"Stopped in for lunch on my way to Reno. Friendly people working there. I had the chicken strips W/ fries on their Lunch Special Menu. Plus 2 pints of course! The bill was about 12 + tip. Food was typical BJs fashion. Nothing spectacular, nothing inedible.  I sometimes don't understand Yelpers who go to chain restaurants like Olive Garden or Red Lobster and expect some gourmet meat that is prepared from scratch by a seasoned Chef. IT IS A CHAIN!!! They have mostly mass pre-prepared food from a huge factory that is cooked for you right before they serve it.  To sum this up, don't be disappointed when you have shitty food for $15 a plate. If you want a gourmet meal it is gonna cost you about $40 a plate. (Plus Cocktails, a MUST!!)  Have a GREAT WEEKEND/ Cheers."
Mark M.,"Roseville, CA",17,348,,2.0,12/30/2008,"This place has been consistently packed every time I drive by.  We go here for work related event, and the food is always mediocre at best.  I love micro-brew beer, and everyone raves about their beer, but I think they're just OK.  I'm starting to like the Blonde ale, but if you hate cloves, avoid the heff. The best thing about the place is it's always alive and busy.  Good looking interior and always extremely clean.  Staff is always attentive and friendly.  Easy parking and great location.  But if I'm going to fill myself with fats and calories, I'd rather pick something better.  And theres so many good choices in the Roseville area these days."
George P.,"Citrus Heights, CA",5,51,,4.0,3/1/2009,"Sunday night.  Place was busy.  Lots of young people, but others too.  Large dining area and bar.  Several TV screens at the bar. My wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, $9.25.  She said it was great ( I almost never taste her food).  Since I wanted some variety, I ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls appetizer, $9.50.  Very nice avocado and freshly fried egg roll.  Nice mild Asian dipping sauce.  Also some Potato Skins, $7.95, loaded with cheddar cheese, bacon bits and sour cream for dipping, great potato quality.  Everything tasted great.  Nice Iced Tea, $2.45. The waitresses were very nice and attentive. I will come back and try other dishes.  The menu is extensive as you can see in their website.  But the place can be pricey.  The Avocado Egg Rolls (looked like ONE cut in pieces) was either overpriced or should have more of it.  Beers average $5 per glass.  I hope they keep up with high quality. My total bill:  $35 with tax and tip."
Jeanie O.,"Elk Grove, CA",8,128,5,3.0,7/9/2008,"Good deals for lunch.   I've had the mini 1 topping deep dish pizza + caesar salad for $5.95 and the half sandwich+salad/soup+fries was $6.95.  Shoestring fries are good and I've been told by the coworkers that the wedge fries are as well.  Good portions, so even though it was a lunch special I've walked away with leftovers. The bad part is that it takes a little while for the food to come out.  They brought the salads out fairly quickly, but then you get to wait for the main, so if you only have a short time for lunch be advised.  You need at least an hour.  Get there early as the place fills up during lunch time.  Prob wouldn't go for dinner though.  Prices seem high for generic chain food."
Cori M.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2013,"I absolutely love eating at BJ's. I've never had a bad meal. Usually I have amazing service as well. Today I got here right at opening, and being a server in the past I understand that it can sometimes be quite busy right at open. When the short, dark haired hostess asked how many, I said 2...she said it's all open seating in the bar and I told her I would prefer a table. She said there would be a wait for a table and I said that it was fine I would wait...she continued to tell me that I should just sit in the bar. I told her no I would wait. While waiting she started complaining to her co worker about how angry she was at whoever closed the night before because they sucked. I found this to be completely inappropriate as she was saying very mean things. I understand being frustrated but you never do that in from of guests. She was very rude and unfriendly as well. I write this while waiting to be seated...I just hope my server and food is better then that of the short haired dark hostess with a terrible attitude."
Duane H.,"Colfax, CA",14,41,8,2.0,5/29/2008,The only real highlight to this place is that it has pretty decent beer. The food is typical pre-fab junk that chains like this shovel out by the trough-load.  None of it is worth trying to fight your way through the stacked to the rafters horde of douches that inhabit the place.
Regan C.,"Cupertino, CA",28,206,7,5.0,6/14/2007,"I like this place quite a bit. Went here with a large group of co-workers. I didn't have a full meal here, but during happy hour, the prices for drinks and appetizers are cheaper. The appetizers I had were chicken wings, potato wedges, and an avocado egg roll - all which were awesome. I didn't have the pizza, but it looked savory! You probably have to make a reservation because its extremely crowded in here. The bar was nice, and service awesome. The waiters very very nice and came around to ask us if we were doing good often. Some of us made a mess, and they cleaned up for us. We did get thrown out because some of us had too much to drink, but we deserved that.  Also, get the Strawberry Splash drink - is fruity, but its pretty tasty."
Michael R.,"Los Angeles, CA",402,134,20,1.0,9/19/2007,"Another chain so many locals seem to be in love with.  The basic beer, I hear what is poured at the bar is not what is made on site, the tanks make a bar minimum batch to meet liquor license regulations.  Food is typical chain, service is spotty and ordering from the bar is a pain (especially when busy).  Massive wait times for dinner service for large parties Thurs-Sat so forget bringing your group here then. Worst of all, as with all of these chains, they kill the small and independent restaurateur.  Why do we care about them?  Well without them we have nothing unique about Roseville.  Every city has a BJ's, Chili's, Applenees and etc and they are all the same.  Homeowners in this area that are concerned about future home values should take special note of this.  If there is nothing unique or identifying about a city, why would young people stay or real estate specualtors either.  We should all promote indy restaurants, entertainment and unique elements.  All of which are rare around here."
Leo C.,"Dublin, CA",69,67,4,2.0,9/9/2007,"I'm reluctant to post this review, seeing these high ratings on this page, but it must be heard! I'm generally an OK fan of BJ's, have gone to several in LA, SJ, etc... thought this one would be decent. HOWEVER, I had probably the worst service I have ever had in the world. Not sure how that happened.  I went with a co-worker to catch some football.. ordered appetizer, salad, entrees, the works (on the company bill of course). Somehow, my salad comes, and we don't have any utensils, which is understandable.. but, the waitress didn't notice. Alright, that's fine, just an oversight.. so I asked her to bring some.. waited like 10 minutes, no utensils. I then proceeded to ask another waiter, who brought me the utensils.  So then... after about 15 minutes after ordering, we realized our appetizer never came. We keep waiting.. about 10 minutes later, the waitress says that they accidentally sent our appetizer to the wrong table. So they were making a new one... OK, I guess so. Appetizer comes, we eat it.. then .. they bring antoher appetizer to our table? That we never ordered? lol. We quickly told them that we never ordered it. Then came entrees.. those came without a hitch, although it came while we just started eating our appetizer, due to it being re-done. Oh well. We ask for some waters, as our beers were getting low. Of course, as expected, no waters.  We asked for waters again, halfway through our meal, and again, they didn't come... finally, we decide to order some dessert, and we finally ask again for waters... and the waitress realizes that she forgot again and finally fetches us waters. Overall, I'm not sure if it was just a busy night, or if they were training someone, but the service was horrible. Food was great though!"
Tiffany T.,"Beaverton, OR",314,891,200,3.0,1/21/2007,"Ate here today and I did get an awesome view of the New Orleans versus Chicago game so I think this place would be good to watch sports. However the food was just so/so. My husband had the calazone, which was kind of small and not as full of meat and olives as he would have liked, a little heavy on the ricotta cheese side. I had the fried chicken sandwhich was served kind of cold. The food for both of us was about a 'C' grade. The decor was nice. And I did like how they had baked potatos on the menu as a lunch selection and those were pretty cheap. If I went there again I would probably get one of those.  Very trendy and chain like since its so maincured inside. The service was very fast and our waitress was super attentive. Still the food didn't impress me, they are probably better at happy hour."
Jen H.,"Roseville, CA",234,222,51,5.0,12/4/2006,"If BJ's was bad, then why is it always packed?!?!   I have eaten here many times.  I must be lucky because I have never had a long wait.  Each time I have gone I have ordered something different.  From pizza to the crispy chicken sandwich to a ceasar salad.  Everything was delicious and I never had to complain.   My favorite drink from the bar is the razzeltini.  It is like a glass of raspberry chocolate delite! hahaha....I love anything with chocolate and raspberries. This is a great place to go.  Just make sure you save room for dessert!"
Pete S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",55,75,29,4.0,11/3/2010,"I've been to this location a handful of times and the food and service has been really good and consistent. You have to try their pizzas, if you're a fan of the deep dish. The crust is light with a crispy outer layer. I don't usually go for the deep dish at other places but at BJ's, it's a winner. They also have beer and large TVs.What else can a guy ask for?!"
ChiYan T.,"San Francisco, CA",127,180,197,4.0,3/16/2010,"You know, there has always been something about the popularity of the BJ's chain that has eluded me. The Cupertino location was the only place in that whole city where you'd find (and need) valet for your car. The Roseville location is larger with a huge parking lot, and on a Monday right around 7:30 to 8:00PM the dining floor was surprisingly full.  Their buildings are always noticeable, tiled, deep red-brown paint, huge metal circular columns and beer brewed on-site. Huge flat-screen TVs showing every sports game known to man are on display. The interiors are always full of wood, clean, and brightly lit with groups large and small everywhere.  The menu is broad, everything from pasta, stuffed potatoes, deep dish pizza, large salads, and numerous appetizers (luckily not all of it is deep-fried). When you're guzzling a beer and want your greasy side you got it, if you're on a diet they have healthier options, there are also a number of items that could pass as vegetarian fare. Their new ""Mini-Bruschetta"" were four minuscule pieces of toast topped with diced tomato and basil, a nibble then gone. The ""Garlic Parmesan Kettle Chips"" came in a huge mound with two dipping sauces. Just the right side of thick, crisp, seasoned, even decent the next day out of the fridge. The ""Chicken Pot Stickers"" were small but at least they came with really thin skins, which I like. ""Flatbread Margarita"" was a good size rectangle, decent amount of cheese and bread was not too doughy. My attempt at vegetables, ""Caesar Salad"" with grilled chicken was a little bland but piled high and the greens weren't wilted. I also used to be a big fan of their ""Pazookie"" which is a half-cooked (so it's still gooey and warm in the middle) large chocolate chip cookie sundae. That was before I started trying to eat more responsibly though, but I'm sure it's just as good as when I last had it. Their inventory costs must be huge.  We spent almost 3 hours here, service was spotty but polite (don't dally at the menu just go for a couple dishes first so you don't starve by the time you really know what you want).  They've managed to find a good niche in areas that are sorely lacking a nice sports pub with decent food where everyone from college students, families, and working professionals can go after a strenuous day to have a couple of bites (and have some booze while they're at it). The food selection tends to be better than Gordon Biersch and despite the large menu selection like Elephant Bar or Cheesecake Factory, more of the dishes come out decent (although nothing is spectacular). This is a fairly solid place to find a little bit to satisfy everyone, and for the rest of the people, the booze will take care of it. Just stick to the straight-forward drinks, both mojitos I had were syrupy-thick.  It's also helpful that they're open until 12:00AM Sunday-Thursday and 1:00AM Monday-Tuesday.  3 1/2 stars."
