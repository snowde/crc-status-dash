Ruben R.,"Chico, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/5/2017,All bs everything is a diversion from your food  Overpriced and extremely small portion  Pizzas all in the middle nothing on the 1/3 edge all bread for 28.00? Not even the half on Monday All foods deep fried and burnt to dust many things better
Pedro B.,"Shingle Springs, CA",11,88,14,5.0,8/9/2017,A great place to go and have dinner with close friends.  Good food and wonderful service. Thank you Mason!!! Plan to go back sometime soon.
Family B.,"Carmichael, CA",4,69,2,3.0,8/12/2017,Updated: I just added a star because I had my dessert that was packed to go and was amazing. Pizookie. It's a soft warm cookie with ice cream. Sounds simple but it's crazy good. Nice variety on menu. However the service took forever and my pizza wasn't even cut. Sent it back to have it cut and it was soggy. Papa Murphys does a much better gluten free pizza. Seems like an upscale applebees. Nothing special. No real reason to go again.
David P.,"Redding, CA",2,41,22,5.0,3/25/2017,Love this Bjs location this is my favorite Restaurant. I have never had a bad meal here today I had the Jambolaya and it was so delicious. I had it with there Bjs hefeweizen. The service is always excellent along with the environment.
Nick H.,"Marysville, CA",1,33,,5.0,8/27/2017,"Great selection of beer, extremely good pizzas and burgers and the carnitas fries are incredible. One of my favourite places to go when I'm in Roseville."
Katja M.,"Rocklin, CA",59,9,,1.0,8/26/2017,"I came here tonight with my friend and we got served by the rudest woman who had the worst odyssey to card me and then continue to belittle me, by saying I ""definitely did not look 21"". I could not believe my ears at all, and even my friend was shocked. That wasn't only the worst part of it....my friend and I got our margaritas and we couldn't even taste one once of alcohol in either one. I was completely baffled at the terrible service. Also not to mention, we got cold fries. She ended up leaving and we got a new server who was a lot nicer, but I went ahead and asked to speak to the manager. The manager helped us who was very accommodating.  I didn't feel welcomed here at all, and even though the manager helped us sort things out, I don't know if I'll be back. Some waitresses and waiters need to stop pre-judging and to understand that when someone's ID says 21 it means that they are twenty-one. I am completely appalled. The waitress was a women who had short highlighted hair and distinct makeup on, I unfortunately didn't catch her name."
Brandon W.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/18/2017,Everyone here acts like they hate they're job. Bar tender was annoyed when asked a question about the company beers. Waitress seemed so stressed to the point that we should accept her poor customer service because even I think it's not her fault. Overall the staff seems sad n mad n not happy to serve or answer a question. So this place sucks.
Bryan H.,"Roseville, CA",50,22,,1.0,6/29/2017,Our catering order of a couple of pizzas was 45 minutes late from our desired pick up time. Resulted in food arriving late for party where guests were waiting. This is not the first time our catering order has been late.
Ronnie B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",72,161,182,5.0,1/6/2017,"Just had a late night dinner and drinks here as it was one of the few restaurants opened until 12 am.  So very glad we came!  Excellent service and scrumptious chocolate martini as well as delicious fish and chips BUT you have to try the beet and arugula salad!! The best blending of taste sensations!!  Keep BJs in mind when you are hungry for some very late nite bites, the extensive menu has something for all taste cravings!"
Vanessa H.,"Olivehurst, CA",53,6,11,1.0,8/8/2017,"Party of 5 on a not so busy Tuesday night. We were sat right away and we told the hostess it was a birthday celebration. We got our drinks quickly but our food not so fast. One of us had steak and while the other 4 dishes were brought out, it was still another 15 minutes until the steak came out. We also told them 3 times that it was a birthday celebration and we never saw the pizookie. I regret leaving the server a $20 tip. First and last time to BJ's."
Georgia G.,"Fair Oaks, CA",11,31,4,3.0,6/19/2017,"Fathers Day! 108 outside! 7 of us couldn't wait to come in from the heat have a ice cold beer and dinner! We walked in expecting that nice cold(er) air My friend even brought a sweater in just in case A.C. was cranking(wishful thinking) We were met with a warm air. We were sat in the back of the restaurant and it was hot! People were fanning themselves and it was not pleasant! As always the food was very good, The waitress was on point. But the heat inside was to much. Crank up your A.C BJ's its hot people want a comfortable atmosphere when they are eating."
Morgan S.,"Roseville, CA",203,10,,5.0,11/2/2016,"Emily Moore, I think is her last name. She's the most amazing server I've had her in a long time! Curly hair, down to earth, made me so comfortable! Thanks for the great service girl! Keep the smile and the attitude! You're rockin Morgan"
James E.,"North Highlands, CA",24,2,,1.0,9/18/2017,"We like to come to Bjs because they usually have a decent atmosphere and the food is usually pretty good but tonight was not the night to come here obviously. We started out ordered drinks, an appetizer and our food. The app comes out and it has no bacon, the potato skins are cold and so the waiter offers to bring out bacon on the side which came out about 10 minutes later and was all soft not the way it normally comes out. The food finally came out and the spaghetti which is usually pretty good tasted like it had been left under the light for too long, as it has gotten kind of chewy. The service was not very good either... had to ask for sides several different times, had to wait about 30 minutes for a refill. Seemed standard for the night as the table next to us was complaining to the manager as we were waiting for our orders to get corrected. Won't be coming back here. Maybe the one in Folsom but not Roseville for sure."
Angela M.,"San Francisco, CA",81,62,35,1.0,11/29/2016,"This place is no good, both in food and in service. We arrived and were seated. My mother gets up to go to the bathroom and a waiter almost mows her down with a child seat in his arms. You would think he would be able to wait a second for her to pass, but instead he pushes his way through no 'excuse me' or ' sorry.' Then our order is mixed up. They bring out the wrong pizza. BJ's ALWAYS serves cold food so as you can guess what I am about to mention is the food was cold. All the meals were cold- fries were cold. Pizza was cold and not completely cooked. The burgers were mixed up- one was ordered medium well and the other medium, but they were switched along with their condiments.  The manager did give us the pizza for free which was nice and new 'warmer' fries were provided. They did honor our birthday with our free pizookie! Those pizookies use to be good back in the day- hit and gooey cookies, but now it is not so. The cookie was overlooked.  I guess this review is based on the food and the food at BJs is no good :("
Tabitha N.,"Sacramento, CA",1,17,5,5.0,10/22/2017,Between their pizza and their cookie dessert - this place is AH-mazing!! Def one of our favorite date night spots and the pricing isn't terrible. They have a special right now on their desserts - only $3! Plus they just started offering a free kids appetizer of fruit and bread right when you're seated which was amazing to keep our toddler busy until the real food came :) def recommend - never had a bad experience here. Plus their coffee is very good too!
Valerie M.,"Plumas Lake, CA",62,80,37,1.0,3/12/2017,"We came here last night 3/11/17 around 630pm our son wanted BJ's for his 6th Birthday Dinner. We have the mobile app and checked in, so we presumably wouldn't have to wait long, since it was Saturday night. When we talked with the people up front were rude, we asked how long to wait would be the we checked in already they said 30min even with the app.. okay...... so we decided wasn't worth the trouble and started back for the car just to get a text not even 5 min later that our table was ready... really?... We should have left that was only the start of our awful experience... we got seated, server took forever but was friendly place was packed so I get it. We ordered drinks, app and meals at the same time because we knew it was going to be awhile. Food was okay but not great mine was horrible. Do not order the Peta shrimp Tacos. They come with arugula and a vinaigrette. It was so drenched with the dressing that it tasted like straight vinegar. Gross.. son was happy though and that's why we came here. We were finishing up, ordered the kiddos birthday desert. When our server who had just bussed the table next to ours spilled 3-4 drinks directly onto our table and all over my son he almost hit my 6 year old in the face other the glasses some landed in his lap, if the server had not deflected one of them onto me. My son would have been hit in the face with a heavy glass. Seriously?? Other then helping us dry off. I was soaked my whole left side was. My poor son had soda in his hair, all the way to his socks. Other then helping us dry off no refund was offered. Never even had a manager come over. Your server just dumped a whole tray of drinks on your guests. On a little kid out for his birthday. Can't be bothered to come by??? I wasn't expecting a refund but wow way to care."
William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1740,1257,9441,3.0,5/16/2015,"My Roseville Macy's co-workers and I were having a special dinner party at BJ's on 5/3/2015, and of course, the atmosphere is quite busy in some occasions. BJ's is a national restaurant chain that most people dined there every day and night. After I ordered Lemon Thyme Chicken and Chicken Pot Stickers, my order was much longer (estimated 1 hour long) due to the amount of people we sat there after reserving a table. Since then, my order was arrived. The food that I ordered is good, but the cooked chicken breast and vegetables on Lemon Thyme Chicken got closely blacked despite the wait. Otherwise, it's a good dish. The pot stickers tasted very good too including the sauce. No issues at all. The service is a hit-n-miss. Due to the amount of parties (aka people) to reserve a table, it can be complicate to make their orders right including drinks. As for duo or loner dining here, it's much faster, and effective. The bartender side is very good. I can order alcoholic drinks in no time at all! In the end, BJ's in Roseville is a great place to dine in their favorite food and drinks all day long. Perfect for Happy Hour, or simply dining with your family, friends, and co-workers to enjoy."
Laura T.,"Sacramento, CA",321,35,201,5.0,10/5/2016,"Excellent food and service is always top notch here! This is an exceptional BJ's. The chicken and the salmon are both very good dishes. Also, try the avocado rolls!"
Mohamad A.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",1,27,22,5.0,6/18/2017,"Absolutely delicious food, great service, and free ""Fathers Day"" Glass cups plus a 20% off card for the next visit."
Ashley B.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/18/2017,"Had some coworkers go there for lunch, they ordered me the mozzarella and tomato salad to go since I was not able to go to lunch with them. When they brought the food back to me there was no balsamic to go with it. This happened before and I just let it go and decided to give it another chance. And they failed again."
