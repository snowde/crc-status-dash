Aaron M.,"Rocklin, CA",3,5,,4.0,1/31/2010,"I have been to this restaurant many time and have always had good service and great food. Happy Hour is great, BJ's beer is delicious! Most of the time I get a burger or pizza and you can't go wrong with any of them."
Shayne P.,"Plumas Lake, CA",13,38,12,2.0,1/26/2012,"If it wasn't for the Avacado Eggroll's and Jermiah Red we'd probably never come back. An hour and forty five minutes waiting for our food and the service was the WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIANCED IN MY LIFE!!!   They are lucky I even paid for the food after the service that was received. Our waitress appeared to be new and completely out of place. She came to our table 4 times within an hour and a half to tell us ""the foods on it's way""   I kept calm and didn't blow up since my family was with me. But I would not recommend this place to anyone since there's so many other restaurants within walking distance that have alot more to offer and much better service."
Todd G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",7,195,8,4.0,10/14/2007,"Having lived in Orange County for many years, I was very happy when BJs opened up in my new hometown. They have the best Chicago style pizza around. Their beer is very good and the Pizookie is to die for(Dessert). It is pricey, but the place is always packed."
Poi D.,"Brentwood, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/19/2011,"BJ's is BJ's when it comes to food and beer....usually always good, so it comes down to courtesy and service. Today, BJ's fell short on service. Service was very slow for late afternoon. It took 25 minutes to get our drinks, and 30 minutes just to get silverware and napkins, which had to be asked for.  After 45 minutes, we're still waiting on food."
Cloak D.,"Hanford, CA",0,45,5,4.0,12/31/2010,"It was really crowded when I arrived here (surprising, since it was 9 o'clock on a Sunday!), so I had to wait. I'm glad I did, because the Mediterranean pizza I ordered was the best pizza I have ever eaten."
P S.,"Sacramento, CA",10,314,30,3.0,8/13/2010,Food is consistently good.  The menu has a huge variety of options for picky eaters or large groups.  Nutrition info is provided with the menus for those with diet restrictions. Great French Fries and deep dish pizza.  Beer is better than some mass market domestic stuff.
Catherine H.,"Sacramento, CA",37,7,13,4.0,1/5/2007,"BJs is a pretty good restaurant.  The wait isn't always the best, but it does have a good atmosphere if you like being around people.  It's a good place to go with friends.  Even when it's packed the service is good.  We've never had any problems there.   The beer is good and I really like the French Dip sandwich.  My husband loves the Club sandwich.  You can get good deals on the appetizers during Happy Hour too.   If you want the food, but don't want to deal with the crowds just call in a Take Out order.  Good stuff!  :)"
Niki C.,"Hillsboro, OR",21,94,27,4.0,9/7/2010,"Every time I've gone, whether for lunch or dinner, service has been good to great and food likewise. I enjoy going here, to me it's fairly comparable to Applebees or Red Robin."
Hattie S.,"Marysville, CA",9,169,1,4.0,9/27/2010,All I can say is yum! They have a HUGE menu and the service was fast and friendly. I had the fish tacos and they were sooooo good! I will most definitely be going back.
Robert C.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,9,,2.0,4/7/2012,"We decided to stop in for a light lunch and try the new Mahi tacos. We were seated promptly by a very nice hostess and tended to immediately by a friendly waiter.  When we declined the sales pitch of appetizers and alcoholic drinks, the waiter's behavior changed immediately. After waiting 30 minutes, the waiter dropped the plates off quickly without saying a word.  The tacos arrived looking quite different from the advertised picture.  The Mahi was almost non-existent and I seriously doubt whether it was really Mahi.  My entire plate was very cold and the tortillas appeared to have just come out of the refrigerator. There was so little food that we finished eating within a short time and when we declined the waiter's offer of dessert, it was clear we had just wasted his time.  Even though we only stopped in for a light lunch, we were still hungry after a $22 check."
John C.,"Roanoke, TX",21,29,2,4.0,11/28/2010,"Okay, so it's not Chicago pizza but it's predictably god everytime. Do yourself a favor and don't look at the nutritional facts... it's depressing."
Mike S.,"Campbell, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/8/2011,"Met my parents and some of their friends here for Mother's day lunch.  What a disaster.  Sure, it was busy, but it took them a full hour (without stopping by once to tell us where our food was) to bring 3 of our 5 plates, then another 10 minutes to bring the 4th, then the manager came another 10 minutes later to say the last plate would be right out, then came 15 minutes later and said they just put the dish in the oven?!?!?!?!?  All while we're watching other tables get seated, order, eat, and leave.  They took some off the bill and offered a $25 gift card, which doesn't cover the incompetence.  Not sure what the heck was going on in that kitchen, but it was just plain unacceptable.  We'll never go back."
Angel G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/30/2011,Let me tell you we got our food and my steamed veggies were not even cooked. My husbands fries were cold. Then the mgr came back with my steamed veggies cooked and apologized. The waitress was training a new waitress and asked my husband if he wanted another beer and never brought it to us instead brought us our ticket. Being that we eat our BJ at my hometown I was very disappointed.
Hector S.,"Lodi, CA",46,2,,4.0,1/17/2013,"I had the ribs, very good barq sauce good and tasty came with a bake potato the size of Idaho, (huge), also had a blonde beer which was good also, went in about 4:30 before it got busy . service was great also."
Danielle P.,"Carmichael, CA",82,21,5,5.0,1/25/2010,LOVE the pizza....menu has a wide variety of things to choose from. Love the beer. But most of all...if you love sweets....THE PIZOOKIE omggg......its delicious...
Jane H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2013,"My nephew & niece were in town for the day so my family decided to go out to a local BJ upon my nephew's suggestion based on his experience in another BJ restaurant.  We came in at 4pm on a Wednesday afternoon hoping that early dinner on a Wednesday night was going to be a nice quiet meal.  We were seated right away, but that was when everything started to go wrong.  We sat there for 20 minutes and the waitress/waiter never came to take order.  We finally had to waive down a person in uniform to request attendance.  A waitress came over after about 5 minutes (we should've just left right there and then) to take our order.  So now we waited some more.  About 15 minutes later, the waitress returned to tell us that our orders were not ""sent"" to their system and that she had to do it again.  We were getting real upset then, but it was late and we didn't want to leave and have to search for another restaurant.  We continued sitting there for 35 minutes and there were still no foods.  Finally, they brought out the appetizer and all of us dove in because we were very hungry then.  The foods slowly came out and they were mediocre at best, but we were hungry so we were glad to at least had some foods to eat.  One of the items we ordered was a $28 pizza.  It came out last and it came out raw.  The toppings seem to be cooked fine, but the dough inside were almost 100% raw.  Wow!!!!  I couldn't believe it.  Wouldn't pizza BJ's bread & butter, its expertise?  Unbelieveable!!!   We called the manager over and he checked the pizza and apologized then offered to recook it for us.   What?  We waited for almost 90 minutes for the food and when we had the food, it was cooked ""wrong"".  We were completely upset.  It ruined the whole meal right from the beginning.  BJ will never get another penny from us EVER!!!! and we will make sure we let all our friends know about our experience as well."
Aimee W.,"Rocklin, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/26/2013,"On March 17th, a group of friend and I entered this location after playing a soccer game.  We sat at the bar and at first the manager was accommodating.  But as the night went on, the service grew worse.  My group of about 8 people sat at the bar for 15 minutes before anyone came to greet us.  Waited another 15 minutes for water, then waited another 10 minutes before our food order was taken.  When we finally asked that our food order was taken, the waitress was curt and rude and excused herself to fetch more water.  One of my friends is on a special diet and the waitress was not helpful when my friend was asking questions, nor did she present herself in a manner that seemed open to answering any questions at all.  It look nearly 1 hour for a pizzookie and a boneless chicken wing appetizer to come out.  When the timing was complained about the rude waitress came out and half hearted asked if there were questions in a tone that was less than pleasant.  Then she rudely stated ""I was given the food order exactly 24 minutes ago.""  Uh, right, she didn't even take our food order until we were sitting there for nearly 45 minutes.  The MOD for that night tried to excuse the fact that they had gotten busy, when other members started to complain about the service she huffed and puffed and begrudgingly comped the ticket.   I called the next day to complain to the GM.  I gave my story to the daytime MOD and was told the GM would call me back in the afternoon after the lunch rush.  There was no follow up.  Bad service from start to finish.  I will not be going back if I can help it.  I would highly recommend making sure that Amy is not the MOD or that you do not sit in Yury's section.  Yury is so rude!"
Shelly H.,"Roseville, CA",0,19,,1.0,9/21/2011,"Let me start off by saying that in the past I have liked the wide range of food items offered.  Generally this location in Roseville takes quite awhile to get into during the peak hours; which is probably common.  Also, in the past I have waive my right to complain about the service because it was busy, or the entree I ordered takes longer to cook...whatever the reason.  But tonight I no longer bite my tongue about their TERRIBLE customer service.  We met a group of friend for dinner (10 to be exact) and what started out a great time ended up in frustration and a vow to never return.  We offered to pay our portion of the check (since BJ's will not allow for separate checks with a group) with a Visa gift card.  I know, I know, Visa gift cards are a beast amongst themselves, but when the stupid waitress ran the card twice, we were then over charged and then the manager tried to treat us like idiots.  In this day and age of restaurants on every corner, the one thing that keeps customers coming back is CUSTOMER SERVICE....which this place has NONE.  I would advise anyone reading this to go somewhere else.  I know I will never dine in this restaurant again!"
Denise M.,"Placer, CA",1,62,2,4.0,10/28/2009,"Order the French Dip and half a baked potato.  One of my favorite meals in town.  Other than that, its just ok.  Have dessert elsewhere."
Rene L.,"Sacramento, CA",739,431,195,5.0,2/22/2012,"just like any other BJ's you have your bar area with plenty of seating, huge tv, and lots of seating on the floor.  they were beyond packed on a saturday night, but we were set on eating there and stayed.  i was told 30 mins for table for 2, and the pager vibrated 10 mins later- very nice!  the servers were super prompt and chill for such a swamped night.  i'll admit i'm a picky eater and had quite a few subs for my order.  our server was great about it, and my food came out perfect.  much love for BJ's :-)"
