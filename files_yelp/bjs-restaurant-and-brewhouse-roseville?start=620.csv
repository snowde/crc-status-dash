Dave M.,"Antelope, CA",71,31,,4.0,4/28/2010,"I love the variety of items on the menu and their beer is pretty good too. I really like their Tatonka Beer which is a dark but slightly sweet brew. It really complements BJ's spicier selections. Unfortunately for me, last time I went BJ's had removed my favorite pizza... the Blackened Chicken Pizza. :-(  Over all, I enjoy going to BJ's."
Miss C.,"Carson City, NV",23,46,11,4.0,12/26/2010,"We came here late last Thursday night. The place was packed. We shared the nachos. My friend didn't know if they were the best nachos ever or he was just hungry. I think he was just hungry they were just ok! However the flatbreads were very good. Service was good and the food came hot and fast. In short we don't always like chain places, but we will chose this place again, if there isn't a mom and pop open!"
Karen G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/18/2012,The food is equal to Applebee's but way overpriced. The service was very.....................slow. Im not impressed anymore with their restaurant.
Dave K.,"Sacramento, CA",296,121,11,1.0,2/24/2013,"Was very disappointed in this last trip to BJ's. Thought we'd be alright going there on a Saturday at 2:00. We were wrong! Waiter tip: when there are kids to be served try to get their food out first.  The line wasn't long and tables opened up at the bar so we decided to sit there.  We ordered appetizers right away.  It took about 15 minutes for the avocado eggrolls to come out.  Rarely do we ever send back food, the eggrolls were bland and the sauce not very tasty.  We were starving but couldn't eat these,  We asked to credit us or take it off our bill.  Our entrees came out after another 15 minutes.  My wife said her chopped salad was good.  My son's sliders were just a burger cut in quarters.  They didn't even spend the time molding separate burgers to fit the bun. He loves burgers and fries and told us he didn't like them.  My burger was tasteless.  It had no sauce and was incredibly bland.  After all of that, the check came and the server didn't take the eggrolls off the check.  My wife had to wait another 15 minutes for them to just bring them a new check.  She scrounged for cash because she didn't know how long it would take to get that back.  In this economy we don't go out as much and to have such a terrible experience is such a bummer."
Carlos A.,"Roseville, CA",1,38,45,4.0,1/22/2010,"Excellent Burgers!  Better than Islands,Better than The Counter, Better Than In/Out, Better Than The Hut.  This is a high quality burger, juicy and delicious.  Islands used to be my favorite, but their buns come apart in your hands leaving you with a mess.  Somebody tell them nobody wants to pay that much for a hamburger only to have it fall apart.  Too bad they used to make an excellent burger, down in L.A."
Melanee O.,"Auburn, CA",2,23,,4.0,3/18/2010,"I love the lunch specials, I can get a FILLING plate of food for under $10.  Also, there are a pageful of lunch options.  I definitely enjoy this place"
Mark M.,"Roseville, CA",5,30,,3.0,3/7/2011,"I see this as more a ""place to be,"" than to be there for a fine dining experience. The food is so-so, but if you are a people watcher, this is what you might call A-grade. You'll see everything here, too -- families, yups, and some older people. Mostly, yups, though. The energy is high and the food comes within a reasonable time -- except for the typical busy nights when you'll wonder whether they've shut the kitchen down before your order went in. The servers are youthful and generally good. I've had the manager provide free food for order screw-ups, which I thought was a nice touch. Don't leave there without trying the beer or the root beer (really good). The prices are modest and a group of four can get out of there for less than $75. The real downside is the wait -- and it can be significant if you are there on a Friday or Sat. Factor a good 40 minutes for those evenings. Bring along a good book or a fascinating date (or spouse) for a casual chat."
Sara R.,"Petaluma, CA",80,126,17,1.0,5/1/2009,"I went on a Sunday night, and the service was horrible. Our server was very condescending and rude. I think the only reason people think the food is good is due to the fact they are too tipsy to realize it is crap. Dessert isn't as great as it's hyped up to be. Disappointment."
Christine T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,30,,3.0,1/10/2010,"Don't get me wrong -- BJ's is always a fun place to dine, but the parking here is rather bothersome at this particular location. All in all, the food is pretty tasty, but you've gotta try the pizookie :)  It's the best!"
Jillanne D.,"Wichita Falls, TX",14,162,4,2.0,3/6/2009,"Well this place, well it's ok. It's across the street from the mall, tends to get crowded. Food is ok, the only thing that really stands out about this place is the HUGE baked potatoes. Other than that.. It's ok"
Lisa J.,"Roseville, CA",2,198,16,2.0,4/7/2009,Good rootbeer. Lots of greasy food. Crowded. I tried their soups and they weren't  something to rave about. I can make do without this restaurant.
Amanda J.,"Dallas, TX",152,149,93,1.0,1/9/2009,"If you like raw food and risking food poisoning then this is the place for you!  I ordered the shrimp tacos and the shrimp was so undercooked it was actually PURPLE.  I sent it back and by the time the food got to me my entire party had been done with their meal for some time.  The shrimp was still not cooked thoroughly and I just gave up.  Not to mention, we had waited for our order initially for a long time.  This quick lunch in the bar easily took us 2 hours.  I have had pizza there before and was not impressed.  Will definitely not be going back!!  blah!!"
Peggy G.,"Orangevale, CA",0,20,,3.0,3/27/2012,"BJ's is nice.  The food selections are plentiful although many selections are pricey compared to same food at ""unchained"" restaurants.   The hawaiian mahi mahi was flavorful although, food arrived luke warm.  Flatbread pizza and garden salad was very good!  Felt rushed as we were offered dessert while still eating our meal and once we confirmed no dessert was being ordered, check was left for payment which again was perceived as them wanting us to vacate ASAP."
Steve F.,"Sacramento, CA",2,35,,1.0,3/25/2010,"I'd give an even lower rating if I could.  Going here  on a friday night is a huge mistake.  I came before 6pm thinking that I could get a table for 3.  I was told at 545 that it would be a 45 minute wait.   30 minutes later, it was still a 45 minute wait while other's were seated ahead of me.  The hostess staff is unfriendly, unaccomadting, and undiversified.  Not to mention that this restaurant offers DB's a plenty with rude people bumiping into you. After our intiial 45 minute wait, we left to go accross the street to the many better options that existed.  If you have other options, take it.  This place is horrible."
Rachel L.,"Sacramento, CA",8,43,9,3.0,6/22/2009,"BJs is kind of expensive. I ordered the grilled salmon, with rice pilaf and steamed veggies with a cesear salad. It was slightly bland, but for the most part what I expected, nothing out of the ordinary, perhaps thats what I get for ordering the salmon. I would go back and try something different. My roommate got the BBQ pork ribs and seemed to enjoy them, but he was not that excited about the menu from the beginning. I sort of thought the menu was a little overwhelming, there was so much to choose from I could not make up my mind and just ended up saying the salmon at the last second. There was definitely some interesting things on the menu, I would recommend going with friends and everyone getting something different to taste test. The staff was slightly awkward, which made the experience a little weird at times, but other than that they were very helpful and considerate."
Louie S.,"Rocklin, CA",7,53,,5.0,4/22/2009,"I'm sorry, as my fooder credibility undoubtedly gets hurt even more now by my love for this chain called BJ's.But I just want to say I've been several more times, and every dish I try just tastes so good! I too am a food snob who hates chains for the most part (not as much as buffets though!), but BJ's almost always has something on their menu that fits my craving and tastes excellent."
Morgan P.,"San Mateo, CA",99,169,25,5.0,4/19/2009,"So...after my experiences at BJs in San Mateo, I wasn't too stoked to come and try this one. I'm glad I did! The server, Chris, jumped on it like a jump rope. Wiped down our table, was fast and geniune. The hostesses were friendly, and the food (as always) was super good. Their Great White pizza is my favorite. I usually do a Wicked Carmel Apple for a starter drink, but this time my client and I split a pitcher of the Berry Burst Cider. Very good choice! Next time I'm in town I'll be back to this BJ's."
Austin S.,"Auburn, CA",0,16,,4.0,6/10/2008,"Ah, I've spent several evenings here celebrating the end of a college semester. If you are a fan of micro-brewed beer and like a good deep dish pizza then this place is a must! I absolutely love the Blond Ale and Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Some of my other favorites have to be the pastas and the baked cookie things they have (though I don't often get them). Predictably you'll spend a little more here than your average restaurant but the quality of the beer is just great and usually the service is too. Personally I think it's worth the price; just don't go every night. Never sat at the bar and though they have TV's lining the walls and the obligatory crappy mixed music the dim lighting makes it a decent place for dates or just outings with friends. It can get busy during the weekends after 6pm and sometimes during the week as well, but don't be put off by a small wait to give this place a shot. You'll thank yourself for doing it."
Ashley K.,"Anaheim, CA",46,95,61,4.0,1/27/2009,"I have been to BJ's several times but it had been awhile since my last visit until last Saturday night. It was busy as usual. We were told we would have to wait an hour with a party of 7, but it was actually much faster. We got seated in about 25 minutes which was awesome!  We all ordered a wide variety of food from pizza, fish n'chips, salads, and sandwiches. Everyone was happy with their meal. I had the Santa Fe salad and it was really good! I would definitely get it again, but next time I'm getting pizza! It looked really good and the people that had pizza couldn't complain one bit.  Our waitress was really nice and she offered to split our check as many ways as we needed. We didn't even ask, which was cool.  We didn't order an infamous Pizookie because we were too full. I have had them before and they are sooo yummy. I want to go back and just order one of those little pieces of heaven. Next time for sure!"
Lourdes P.,"Miami, FL",24,11,,4.0,7/21/2011,"I was visiting Rocklin for my cousins high school graduation and this is where we went for dinner afterward. The place was really full (thanks to all those graduations) but we got seated right away. They have a large selection of beers which I was very happy about. But the star of the show was the famous Pizookie. I tried the chocolate chip and the triple chocolate but my favorite, hands down, was the macadamia nut, it was unforgettable!!"
