Jeff G.,"Sacramento, CA",293,18,,5.0,9/12/2008,"really good food, and the hefeweizen is superb!! ..i usually get the pork baby back ribs when i'm really hungry, or the great white pizza when i'm on that snack mode! ..for some reason, i like this location better than any of the other BJ's i've been too (vegas/natomas). Everytime i've been, the wait wasnt too bad..just dont go when prom night is going on, or dinner/lunch rush hour..be smart! ..and if you do get caught up, it's definitely worth the wait!  i prefer goin to BJ's than to any other chain restaurants.. i.e., Applebee's or Chili's.. more bang for your buck! better food too..the only thing i can think of comparing this place too is Yard House in Vegas, and i gave them 5 stars as well! =P"
Marc A.,"Roseville, CA",73,10,14,3.0,2/17/2009,"I agree with some of the negative reviews on this place.  In fact the last time I went here we waited over an hour to get seated after then hostess said it would only take 30 minutes.   The problem?  She never entered our name into their system but gave us a pager.  How is the pager supposed to go off if the system doesn't know we exist?   In fact, in my opinion if you see a 5 of us sitting there for over an hour and you are seating people that are just walking in wouldn't you think there was a problem?  To further explain how much the hostess was unable to do her job, my wife even asked her what was going on 45 minutes into waiting.  She then told my wife it would be 10 more minutes and asked for my wifes name again.  25 minutes later they still didnt page or call us up.  What is the purpose of asking my wife her name if you were not going to check the system to see where we were in line for a table.  Wouldn't she have caught the problem at that point if she was doing her job.  At least after I complained to the manager he didn't try to water down the situation.  He knew it was the hostess' fault.  I wish I got the hostess' name so in that way if you walk in this establishment  and see her behind the counter and seem to be waiting long for your table you know to check in since see seems to not know how to do her job. Luckily the food was ok and the manager diffused the situation, if not this place would get a 1 star!"
Rhiannon C.,"Buellton, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/3/2007,"I have been to BJ's several times, as for some reason my family LOVES BJ's pizza! I admit, the food can be good, but overall it's the basic run of the mill, typical corporate restaurant chain, with the WORST service EVERY time we go!      Now, I am not one to complain or be extremely critical, as I have been a server and bartender for 2 different corporate restaurants myself for 6 years. So I know how hard serving can be, but I also know when the server is slacking, or just plain rude.   For instance, my mother wanted to go to BJ's for her birthday lunch, so like good daughters, me and my sister took her to the Roseville BJ's, it was around two in the afternoon, and business was fairly slow. We were sat immediately, but then no one greeted us, or even made eye contact for about 8 to 10 minutes, until I went to the host and asked her to send over a server.  A few more minutes later, a girl comes to say ""Oh goodness! You haven't been helped?! Well, let me find Jeremy for you!"" She didn't take our order, or even get us drinks, which she should have, so at least the kitchen could have started cooking my mother's birthday meal, while she went ""searching"" for Jeremy. About another 5 minutes later, Jeremy arrived, without any apologies, and took our order.  He brought us our drinks, and then we did not see him again!  Our food came and went, our drinks sat empty, and all the while several servers were walking to and fro, not one of them stopping to check in on us!  Finally, I had had enough! I walked up to the host, and asked for a manager.         I explained to the manager that I was a server myself, and not one to complain, but it was my mother's birthday, and the service has been terrible, and we've been waiting for about 15 minutes for someone to clear our plates, and bring the check!  He profusely apologized, and said he'd ""take care of things.""    Jeremy appeared about 2 minutes later, asking if we wanted refills, presented our check, and then gave us a pizookie ""on the house."" Seeing as it was my mother's birthday, the pizookie should have been free anyways! Over all, we had 3 iced teas, and 3 salads that cost $45.68 before tip, and took almost 2 hours to serve!! It was a horrible experience, and every time we go, it's about the same experience!     In fact, the last time me and my family dined there, the host ""forgot"" to write down our name, so we were never seated, and finally resorted to the bar area, and true to form, the service was terrible! We had to flag down our waitress every time we needed something, then she would proceed to walk away, before we were even finished ordering!! It was so rude, I was shocked! She also ordered our food wrong, and never apologized, or sent a manager over to apologize. She then went on break, without informing us, and we were left to deal with one of her co-workers, who was not filled in on the progress of our order.  In the end, they never cleared our plates, or brought refills, and of course, I had to search out and find the co-worker, just so we could pay our bill!       For all the years I have been serving, none of these experiences would have been anywhere near acceptable, and most would have called for a write up or firing!!   I was so mad that I decided to write this review to warn all of you of the horrors of BJ's!  It's a fun environment, with lots of great decorations, and big screen TV's for all of us sports fans, but make sure you have a few hours to spare, and a lot of tolerance to rudeness and bad service!"
Kiran B.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/27/2011,I really like this place and there deep dish is perfect and the pizzokie is out of this world but sometimes the line is long and its really loud but worth the price and the smiley face fries are cute and very tasty
JENNA L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,32,,5.0,7/29/2008,"I only go here for the Pizza (always get BJ's Favorite; combination) and the house made rootbeer.  The crust is like no other...soft, yet crisp, buttery and light for a deep dish extraordinaire. We like to get a large so we have plenty of leftovers!! The wait is pretty horrific most of  the time but it's Roseville so I expect it anywhere!Oh and my husband says the beer is great as well!"
Linsey F.,"Sacramento, CA",75,317,5,4.0,7/7/2006,"Well, it is a chain restaurant, and you will have to wait a while for a seat, but OMG best french dip sandwich I have ever had! They give huge portions, decent service and loud atmosphere. Other menu items to try: artichoke dip and baked potatoes. What not to order: their salads suck."
Melanie I.,"Roseville, CA",212,264,6,5.0,7/20/2006,"I love this place for lunch. It is too busy at dinner time, but lunch rocks. My 2 favorite menu items are both on the appetizer menu, but I have been known to eat them for lunch. They are the avacado egg rolls, and the chicken lettuce wraps. The avacado egg rolls also have cream cheeses in them, and something a litlle bit spicy and a litlle bit sweet. They are deep fried of course, and come with a yummy dipping sauce. The lettuce wraps come with two dipping sauces, one of which is a very spicy mustard sauce that I will caution you to use in moderation. It is a wasabi type of hot that will make your eyes water and your nose run. I use a very tiny amount of it to add flavor without these side effects."
Cliff N.,"Fairfield, CA",31,119,37,4.0,7/31/2010,"BJ's has old world architecture of brick and mortar outside, but with big tall ceilings and a modern somewhat upscale feeling inside, with plank wood floors, leather padded booths, cut glass and overall a well decorated place to eat and drink. Comfortable but not pretensous, a little posh but fully functional. Jeans or high heels. The front desk to the waiter and all of the staff are very friendly, service savvy and on their ""J"". Their job one being their customers and I really got a feel that they were well trained and focused on making our experience pleasurable a concept! The waiter was fast, professional, without having an aura of pressure for us to order faster- it was my first time here and won't be my last based on the total quality! For lunch, I had the mandarin sesame chicken, whose chicken was tender, juicy and not over flavored, the sesame seasoning was just right and lettuce fresh and supple, she had the Cajun blackened chicken Cesar salad and told me it was very good, as my son exclaimed that his double mini burgers were very good, he thought the meat quality was high and liked the way his buns were not over toasted. Our food came fast and the servers were all over our every whim and need, we watched the Xgames on the big screen and I marveled at their twin large copper brewing tanks that are visible from throughout the place. The price was doable and there was no wait on a summer Saturday afternoon, not bad considering this is just down the street from the mega shopaholic Galleria Mall! I must say BJ's did everything right and I'll be back for more!"
Todd D.,"Auburn, CA",1,44,,5.0,4/4/2008,Jeremiah Red!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. Pizzas are very good and so are the baked potatoes. This place is always busy so the service is what I would expect.
Totally R.,"Roseville, CA",51,5,,1.0,1/20/2013,"I usually LOVE to come and eat at Bjs, I love the food and the atmosphere...But usually the service sucks and is really slow! It took more than 30 minutes for my food to come out today. I went on my hour lunch break from work with a friend and she got there a little bit early to get a table and to order....I showed up about 10 minutes later and it still took 30 minutes after that for the food to come out. Our server, Amanda, stopped by to say your food should be out in just a minute...10 minutes later as we were looking around to see if they had forgotten us, it finally came out. It was delivered by another server who literally just put the food down and walked away, before we could even bite into our food our actual server came by and said ""so how does everything taste?"" as she was literally walking away before we could answer...we were done with our meals and it was just sitting there for a little while and then she came by to take away our plates. We usually like to share a dessert, but i had waited so long that we didnt have time, but she didnt offer or ask how everything was...she just set the bill in front of our face and said ""i'll put this here for your convenience...."" we both put our credit cards in the holder and waited...and waited...and waited for her to finally stop by the table and see that we were ready to pay. So we paid got our cards back and finished up. The entire experience was so bad...I didnt have time to enjoy my food or the company of my friend and we felt neglected...Im not sure if i would come back...this was kind of the last straw for me."
Melvin R.,"Elk Grove, CA",17,9,,5.0,8/6/2007,I love BJs. They have awesome pizzas. I especially like their BBQ Chicken pizza.
Tim L.,"Roseville, CA",2,71,,5.0,8/6/2007,This is a great place to eat.  We tried many of their pizza's and have not had a bad one yet.  The beer is pretty good too.  Get there early or you will have to wait for a seat.  It's a nice place for larger groups.  Not too much noise so you can have a conversation and just noisy enough that if you get a little load yourselves that you won't be disturbing anyone else.  I'd like to mention that the managers at this place are top notch.  They go above and beyond to keep their customers happy.  Things rarely go wrong here but when they do the managers are on top of it and they make things right.  Very rare these days...
Marissa C.,"Sacramento, CA",15,55,3,3.0,10/16/2007,"I would have given 4.5/5 stars for the food but the service is horrible!  I have a pet peeve about workers sitting at a bar table when there are people waiting for tables!  I believe if you are going to, change your clothes so no one knows!!"
g g.,"Roseville, CA",1,9,2,3.0,11/28/2010,"The food is so-so here- kinda just lots of fried, oily, cheese drenched stuff. Whatever. The bar is also meh. I don't drink beer. I usually get vodka soda, and they are reasonably priced. One time I ordered a glass of wine that was absolutely rancid. I realize this is not a wine bar, but seriously? It smelled like rotten lettuce and vinegar. I told the server to go taste it and check the open date of the bottle, and she said it was just opened that day... Ummmm, not possible. The real reason to come here are the pizookies. Yum Yum! The ambience is nice at the bar, if the douche bag factor is on the low side that day. Sometimes it gets bad, though.  The low point of this place is definitely the floor- it is insanely treacherous. I don't know what the hell they're thinking with that floor. I was cracking up at Christina's review- it is terrifying in heels! They are definitely going to get sued at some point. And they'll lose, because that floor is indefensible.  As for service- I usually sit at the bar, and every time I was in the dining room the service was a C-. Except Kyle- he was the ONLY server that actually got everything right and was super on top of it. I'd go back and request him, otherwise I'll stick with the bar. Or just go somewhere else. lol"
Courtney W.,"Roseville, CA",40,3,,2.0,8/27/2010,"The servers were attentive and the atmosphere was lively.  The drinks were also pretty good.  The food was not so good.  They seem to overcook things and everything I ate from the apps to the entrée was dry and overdone.  It was also a fairly long dining experience and we waited 1+ hours for our food on a non-busy Thursday night.  I would go to BJ's for a drink - not for dinner, this was the fourth time I have been there and I have had the same experience each time."
L. B.,"Chico, CA",0,12,5,5.0,1/27/2010,"I love this place! I've been a handful of times - maybe 3 or 4 times because I live out of town. Their food is really good and their services has been fine every time we've been. According to the other reviews, it sounds like I need to try the Pizookie! Anyway, I know I've only been a few times but I'm suprised by some of the low reviews on here. For an appetizer, their Avocado Egg Rolls are really great. They sound pretty average but they're quite delicious. The dipping sauce is tasty. For the main meal I usually get one of their stuffed potatoes. They're enormous so they're still plenty for your main meal (especially if you get one of the appetizers). Once my mom and I went but we were not very hungry. We shared an appetizer and also shared one of the potatoes. It was the perfect amount. The one I like best so far is the Grilled Chicken Potato. Description from website: ""Grilled chicken breast and steamed broccoli in a giant baked potato topped with Alfredo sauce and jack and cheddar cheeses."" Yummyyyy! There is a pretty large selection of food choices and there are many more things I would still like to try. I want to plan another shopping trip to Roseville where I will definitely be visiting BJs (and Sunset Wellness Spa!)."
Jarred A.,"Rocklin, CA",0,15,,5.0,6/24/2008,"Great place with a great atmosphere.  The fresh beer is awesome, and the food seems to be made by recipes that go the extra mile to make them more unique/flavorful than your typical chain restaurants can come up with.  I give it 5 stars considering it's inexpensive and is just generally a fun kind of place with great beer."
S S.,"Roseville, CA",3,29,,5.0,11/20/2006,"Yes, the wait can suck, but watch the booths in the bar area, and snag one of those. The best item on the menu is the crispy chicken sandwich with wedge fries. YUM! Yes, it is simple, but it is super good. You won't be disappointed. The berry cider is light and refreshing. The pizzokie desert is great for those who like to eat the raw cookie dough at home (and who doesn't right!) Ignore Dane, he should just stay home and eat hummus and tofu."
Mark R.,"San Antonio, TX",1,17,,2.0,6/6/2009,"Beer:  Good Waitress/Service:  Pretty Good Value:  Average Food:  Not So Good Customer Philosophy:  Sucks The beer is good, but they should take ""Restaurant"" out of their name.  Large portions of not-so-great pasta with a little meat on top (I got the Cajun Pasta for $11.95).  Salad costs $3 more and no ""extras"" like bread or chips/salsa on the table.  Waitress was nice and perky.  What pissed me off the most though was their absolute refusal to do split checks for our group of 14.  I know this is common...but I just don't understand it.  It makes it SOOOO difficult to figure out who owes what, especially when you have singles, couples, and others in the group and you're trying to do the tax and mandatory 17% gratuity math...and some are paying with cards and some cash.  I've been here once before with family (just got appetizers, burgers, and beers) and it was decent so I'll probably go back, but I'll never bring a group here again."
