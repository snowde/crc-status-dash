Tule N.,"Rocklin, CA",8,1,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Food was promised at 9:45, 10:25, still no food.  So mad,  got food, then returned them because I know I wouldn't be able to swallow.  No one even sorry.  Well,  lost a customer for good. There are plenty to choose from"
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,4/2/2015,"It'd been a while since I'd hit one of these. It used to be Id go to one that had a ton of TVs so that I could watch all the NHL and NBA playoff games simultaneuosly. Hey when there are 8 playoff matchups per, you're DVR can only go so far...this stop was because we were passing through the area and it was 10pm. Not a lot open at this time on a sunday. Luckily this place was still more than half full and they were setting up a table for 20! Yes 20! Turns out there's some church group that shows up late every week. It definitely made the place even more crowded. So happening for Sunday.  Carnitas fries, potato skins, fried chicken with corn and mash potatoes, and a NY Steak with clam chowder and brussel sprouts. Holy shit this was like food for 5! portions are not small here. However more importantly everything was cooked properly. People may complain about chains but theyve been consistently solid for me. Our server took good care of us and handled that party of 20. Who knew Sunday night was the time for this eh?"
Niccolus S.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/6/2017,Hahaha what a joke!! Slow service and cold food. This wasn't our first time that we've had a bad experience here!
Debi H.,"Manhattan, KS",29,83,24,4.0,3/26/2017,"Our experience for an early dinner on a Sunday was very good. We only had a 5min wait and our order was taken right away. Our server was pleasant.  We shared fried artichoke to start, I had baked ziti & boyfriend ordered ahi salad. Strawberry Benet with ice cream for dessert we shared. Little over priced for the small serving of ziti. Only reason 4 stars, we were happy and full when we left. Joined BJ'S rewards program. Used a $10 off minimum off $35 order. All servers seemed happy. Alot of choices on menu to try so we will return."
Anon A.,"Roseville, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/15/2017,"This may end up being a recurring spot for my friends and I, I've been here before but the service we received was over the top great and the food was well worth the price... Gotta give a HUGE shout out to our waiter Zach for being so quick and attentive... Really nice and was really happy to talk and serve, his attitude plus the food is why I will keep coming back Zach... I hope I spelled your name correctly... But you deserve a raise"
Nicole W.,"Fortuna, CA",0,3,2,5.0,2/15/2017,"Sabrina was the bomb!!! She gave us the best service, had great recommendations and was so nice. I have 5 words for you: Brussel sprouts, lemon, feta cheese!!!"
Chris H.,"Manteca, CA",0,94,125,5.0,9/21/2017,after my experience here its only fair to write a review. we had a bday party for my mom at this place last sunday. I called a couple days ahead of the even to book a party for 20 people. that went really smooth and was effortless to be honest. we showed up a half hour early to check in and I had brought a cake that I got from safeway and asked if they could keep in the fridge for me and bring it out at the end of our meal. they did it without any hesitation. and to be honest was suprising it was so easy to do this considering there usually is a charge for this sort of thing. we got seated and as the people started to show up they just had to state they had a reservation for our party and they were walked right in to our section. our server was on top of everything. as people in the party started to trickle in they were on top of our drinks and was ready to take our orders once our party was all there. it was prob 20 min before everyone showed up and the server was extremely patient for us. we ordered our drinks and food and everything came fast. we had some issues with the food. complained about it and they were quick to fix or replace or just take it off the check. when the meal was almost over here comes the cake without me having to remind them. I brought candles for it and was going to put them on once the cake came out but they were ahead of the game and came out with their own candles on it and lit them for me. would of been nice if they sang happy bday so I wouldn't have to haha but it was just an awesome expiereince. I got an email to review my experience so I complained about the food but praised everything else and I got contacted by the manager. this company went above and beyond in my book and I am very satisfied with how everything was handled and how it turned out. so thank you very much!
Micki M.,"Sacramento, CA",421,617,5195,2.0,1/29/2015,"For some reason, me and BJ's have a bad combination, we just don't get along!  We've been coming here since their opening and used to like them in the beginning. What started as a great beginning, it became tumultuous when I had ordered several party trays that were supposed to feed 10-12.  Much to my dismay, when I opened the containers when I got home, it was enough to feed maybe 4-6! I was shocked because when I attended a friend's party who ordered the same trays at the BJ's in Natomas, their party trays were loaded with food enough to feed more than 12 peeps.  I had called the store the next day and spoke to the manager. He apologized and told me he would reimburse me with a gift card. Well, a week went by and no gift card. I called back and spoke to the same manager, he tells me that there must've been a mistake and he takes my name, and address, a second time, to no avail! I felt like a fool! Never received the gift card, even after the second time! I should have called corporate, but didn't think of it, at the time. This was some time ago, and even with the rough patches, I still continued to patronize this chain.   We've come back time and time again, usually with relatives or friends. It's been hit or miss.  On one of our recent visits, we had a gift card we needed to use. We were seated immediately, but waited for almost twenty minutes before our server ever came. We flagged a server and she notified our server.  He apologized and told us that he didn't know we were seated and he was busy in the kitchen area. That was a lie because he was just at the table in front of us taking their order. Anyway, we place our order and we ordered appetizers and two entrees from their new light menu. Our apps arrived and as soon as we started with our apps, the entrees come out. We were a little annoyed. Hubby's entree was not what he ordered. Our server comes by and we tell him that wasn't what hubby ordered. He checks his tablet and reassures us that he did put in for the right item. He comes back later (I'm practically finished with my meal) with hubby's dish. Not sure who to blame? Kitchen must not know how to check orders!? Their new enlightened menu items are low in calorie but it is lacking in taste, in my opinion. My scallops were not as appetizing as I had envisioned. I only took a few bites, and lost interest. When the manager came over, we told him our dismay and he takes our small bites appetizers off our bill. Nice, but we've had one too many misses here.  I'm quite conflicted when it comes to BJ's, it's one of those places that's not on the top of our list. My review for this chain has been long overdue and I can't refrain myself from posting my negative review."
Roberta B.,"Antelope, CA",326,7,,1.0,9/15/2016,I've I have been a few times. The food has been cold the last few times with no manager in site so i decided to actually email corporate. I never heard back so I emailed again and still no message. At least let me know u care about my money I spend there. Your 3 stars on yelp explains a lot! I or anybody in my party will not return!!
Chad S.,"Marysville, CA",27,70,5,2.0,3/25/2017,Service was slow. He never came to check on us.  One of the jambalayas we ordered was horrible. We brought it to his attention and all he said was sorry about that. It was not eaten. Rest of food was OK. Very disappointing experience
Vince N.,"Elk Grove, CA",46,228,356,1.0,10/1/2016,! star for having an awesome server. I forgot his name but he was great! he did everything in his power to make our visit good even until the last minute. The bad review is for the restaurant and the kitchen staff for being DIRTY! We ordered a bunch of stuff and in our order was a large pizza that 3 of us were going to share. About half way through the pizza one of us found a hair baked into the cheese on our pizza. Our server fixed the problem and did whatever he could to make us happy by getting us a new pizza even though we had already killed about half the pizza. We were pretty stuffed so we took the left over pizza home. The next day I warmed up the left over pizza and after eating a few bites I found a piece of blue plastic on a piece of the chicken. It looks like it came from plastic packaging or something that packaged cheese usually comes in. The first time we found hair and i let it go because our server fixed the problem but the second time when I found plastic in my pizza I almost went ape shit thinking about how sick I could have gotten by swallowing this piece of plastic.
John94521 H.,"Concord, CA",7,39,,5.0,3/14/2017,"Elizabeth was the server of the night. My sister and I were on the hunt for shrimp and we came to the right place with the best server. After our cocktail order (you can't go wrong with the cream soda), I asked Elizabeth about their shrimp items. When a server looks you in the eye and says ""We can put shrimp in almost anything you might order"", we were in. Elizabeth was really prompt, courteous and carried a great attitude about wanting to serve us through satisfaction. Our order was on time, in the right place and hot to the taste. After our meal, we had a great little conversation with Elizabeth, who was very informative about restaurants and what makes BJ's the best in Roseville. Sister and I were satisfied with food, drink and service. So we'll tell family and friends about BJ's Roseville and if your lucky you might get a great server named Elizabeth. . ."
Paul S.,"Ankeny, IA",51,38,23,2.0,10/9/2016,"Took my family there for lunch yesterday. We had Poke, Brussels, a club, chicken fingers and a deep dish pizza. The timing of the food was a little off. In fact one of our items did not arrive until after we had we had received our check and were ready to leave. Despite the fact that it was a full house you cannot forget to bring the food to the table of your customers and then not even make a simple apology!  That is absolutely bad form for any server at any time.  Pizza and Brussels were both excellent and the best  things we had for sure. The poke was Acceptable.  The club was very dry and the chicken was tasteless and overcooked.  The kids chicken fingers were as you would expect them to be. Overall this was a very disappointing visit."
Tara S.,"Rocklin, CA",0,6,2,1.0,6/4/2017,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely hate leaving reviews let alone poor reviews... We keep giving this BJ's a chance and now I'm really not understanding why we do. No kidding, all I order is a pepperoni and TOMATO pizza and it never comes out right.  I understand that sometimes this happens but this is literally the 5th straight time they messed up a simple pizza. This isn't why I decided to write a review though. This time we also found animal hair on the pizza, and we don't own a pet.  This place isn't a cheap restaurant like a fast food restaurant so we wonder why we keep dropping $50 to $70 on bad service.  As I read through some of the reviews on here it becomes very apparent that this particular location needs a lot of training to make sure they can justify higher ticket prices for less than average chain restaurant food and service."
Kayla C.,"North Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",13,25,45,2.0,1/9/2016,"If you love long waits, incompetent staff, and mediocre food, do I have a place for you. I only tolerate this place because the menu is the size of a Kings James Bible and can accomodate multiple picky eaters. Also, the cult of Pizookie has claimed several of my friends and relatives making this a common place for birthday dinner.  Despite being busy every day at everytime, the resturaunt is always understaffed and only partially open in the seating area. Further, there is no system for bar seating so have fun entering a hunger games style death match after that elderly couple in the booth signs their check. Yes, the three guys in football jerseys just showed up and you have been waiting 40 minutes, but no the hostess will not defend you when they steal the table you have been waiting for. Gotta be honest, I am writing this as I endure a 30 minute wait with a family of four screaming children sot accross from me. Call me jaded."
Ashley H.,"Sacramento, CA",43,7,,5.0,4/29/2017,"We had the best experience today! Our waitress was super sweet and knowledgeable. I have celiac and was a litter nervous eating at a ""chain"" restaurant. I ordered the turkey burger on gluten free bun... IT WAS AMAZING!! see you soon BJ's!"
K J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,1,1.0,9/4/2017,"45 minutes to get our food. It was cold so we sent it back to get warmed. Margarita was a lot of base and a dash of alcohol. Extremely sugary and thick. Food was mediocre. We ordered fries when we got our drinks. I then asked the gentleman who brought our food out again our fries... nothing....then asked the waitress after eating my food her response was ""oh you still want the fries?"" Yes... this is why I ordered them.(what I thought) I get the fries, sopping wet with oil. Found the closest person to a Manager and asked for the fries to be removed because they were not edible. I squeezed dripping oil off the fries. By the time I got the check my stomach was hurting extremely bad. Still up currently to write the post because I'm sick from the food."
Gigi C.,"San Jose, CA",1,18,,3.0,3/26/2017,"Came to BJ's during dinner time, 7pm yesterday. The hostesses were not friendly and didn't seem to have a sense of urgency. The young lady showing us to our table, Kelly was literally sweating !! She was so professional and very sweet. Kelly had a huge sense of urgency to seat us quick but still made us feel important. Other than that, the service was pretty mediocre."
Mary B.,"Elk Grove, CA",13,10,,3.0,4/4/2017,The wait time on a Saturday seemed a bit crazy.  Food was good when we finally got a seat for our larger party.
Alla P.,"Rocklin, CA",0,4,1,5.0,8/23/2017,loved my visit at bjs today!! service was quick and waiters were pleasant. and the garlic chicken pesto flatbread pizza thing was delicious!!
