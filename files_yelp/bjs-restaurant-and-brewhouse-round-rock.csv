Brett J.,"Pflugerville, TX",182,197,591,4.0,12/20/2017,"Revisited and updating my review... This is still not a high end restaurant, but it is not supposed to be... BJs is a hamburger, pizza, ribs, type of place. A large leap up from an Applebee's or a chili's for sure but that kind of selection to the menu. I feel it is a bit pricey... $12 to $14 burgers gets to be a bit much to make this a more then a once in a while place for a family of 4.  My sons had the spaghetti and the chicken fingers and they both ate it all. My wife had the 1/2 rack of ribs at $18 and she ate every last bit. (She did say the ribs were not tender enough but that the taste was good!) I had a $13 burger called the chicken fried steak burger with an over easy egg on top... I have to say it was sooooooo freaking good I ate it all! (I'm miserably full now... ouch!) The waiter was great! Really nice guy, very attentive, and just one of those servers you hope to get every time. He truly was a great server. BJs makes their own beer too, although I didn't have any this time... stuck to water... my wife did have a mixed drink. But it was lack luster. I like this venue... I really always have. TVs everywhere playing sports, it is a big place with lots of seating, there is s huge menu... bathrooms are clean and generally it is descent food.  For a relaxed evening meal after hitting the outlet mall... well it's just what the doctor ordered."
Erin G.,"Round Rock, TX",15,7,2,3.0,12/14/2017,"Here's a valuable tip...don't even bother with their new delivery service. I called 45 minutes after the order should have been delivered and they said they'd had it ready for 20 minutes but their third party deliverers had not shown up. The manager spoke to me and I asked her to just cancel our order since we spent $60 and the food was obviously going to be cold. She advised me that they can't even refund our money until next week as they have to go through the home office. Her attitude was pretty much that it wasn't their fault so not her problem...she offered no apologies or offers to make it right and clearly seemed annoyed at my complaint. Two hours after ordering...no food and out $60 for the week Update- (Thank you, Regina for your care and concern. ) Spoke to the general manager, Regina, and she was very helpful and checked to make sure the paperwork was done for my refund. She offered some compensation for my troubles but most importantly was very genuine and polite."
Mike M.,"Round Rock, TX",46,79,28,1.0,10/28/2017,"Every single time I have come here there is something wrong with my order. This is the 4th and last time.  We went in for dinner and appetizers. We ordered the chipotle queso and the boneless wings. It took forever to come out (no, it wasn't busy). The wings were cold, and the queso already had a dry top. It was obvious they had been sitting awhile. I sent the wings back and did not ask for more. They literally were cold. The manager stopped by and said she had arranged to take those of my bill and hoped I understood. I knew they would be taken off my bill as I expected it to be, like she was doing me a favor?  No, I didn't""understand"" why my food was cold. Why it wasn't brought out in a timely manner still warm our dare I say even hot? This place makes too many mistakes and I've given it too many chances."
Yamil C.,"Manor, TX",30,80,134,3.0,1/10/2018,"I've been to several Bj's and I love their menu eventhough at times it can be overwhelming. I sometimes wish for the cooks sake they will tighten that menu up, but i guess it works. This specific Bj's i probably wont go to again. I had a hair in my food and i decided not to complain i just pushed it to the side of my plate. However i was almost done with my food and i found another one. It really ruined my meal and by then i was ready to leave. Other than that the service was good abd tje ambiance was great. Hopefully you wont have the same experience because i really do like this establishment. Still give it a try but be cautious."
Rosa H.,"Round Rock, TX",63,50,184,5.0,10/17/2017,We have meetings R&F tonight! And hubby and I want to have late dinner at BJ And is happy hour tonight 9-11pm Hubby got the root beer glazed ribs and I got the BJ's Pumpkin Ale served good and the great night out at BJ!
Mark S.,"Pflugerville, Austin, TX",4,7,1,5.0,12/17/2017,Courtney our server was amazing. She could teach how to be friendly sincere and an expert on how to handle the back of the store.  Courtney made the visit an exceptional one.
Ashley M.,"Austin, TX",72,322,460,3.0,9/30/2017,Not huge fan of chains but I love their desserts! Plus their bar area is cozy and they have a nice drink selection. Hubby eats here often for work meetings and likes to get their salads.
Sylvain B.,"Solana Beach, CA",311,392,2404,1.0,12/7/2016,"30 mins waiting time, a group of 6, so we decide to go to the bar and order some beers. The bartender was so rude, stressed, pushy. She wouldn't let us decide which beer to choose and kept on asking ""so? So? Have you decided yet?"" every  seconds (and I'm not exaggerating). She was rushing us to order and wasn't friendly at all. So we got seated. Our waitress come, we ordered more beers. Beers came 20 mins after the order. Water 30 minutes after . The waitress dropped 1 beer on the floor. We waited 15 more minutes for the beer to be replaced. Ridiculous. There were no apologies made, no excuses, the beer wasn't even removed from the tab. The food, took 35 minutes to arrive (after the food order that was placed 10 minutes after the beers order...): Mediocre at best. My Mahi Mahi was drenched in sauce. So much sauce that the dish looked like a fish soup. Rest of the food: industrial, over cooked, over salty, over oily. Worst service I ever experienced. We gave up on dessert and 1 last beer. Will never go back."
Joaquin B.,"Hutto, TX",2,38,114,4.0,8/2/2017,"Yesterday I had dinner with a few friends we decided to go to BJ's,  I have to be honest with you, I eaten there before not my favorite spot for management reasons.  But yesterday my son order the shrimp pita tacos, I looked at the tacos, made  a joke about the quantity of Shrimps that were in the Tacos which were 2 or 3 in each tacos, in a matter of a few minutes the manager came to our table and offer an apology he went to check on it and they were right on point.  He offer dessert, an all together they were great.  Thank you BJ's."
Kait K.,"Georgetown, TX",62,54,4,2.0,10/7/2017,"I've been to the one in Tallahassee and was very good. The one here in Round Rock gets a 2 star. That is only for the cool atmosphere. The food is not very good. I got the black and blue hamburger. I asked for medium, came back VERY well done. There was two VERY little chunks of blue cheese. I had to ask for more. The waitress looked at me like I shouldn't have a problem w the crap burger that was placed before me. So this place is a NO GO. And I also over heard the table next to me complaining about the same thing to the manager."
Krasti Q.,"Pflugerville, TX",188,38,23,1.0,5/30/2017,"Came here with a group of 9 people for dinner around 8pm. The restaurant was practically empty so we immediately got seated. Despite how empty the restaurant was, service was very poor. We did not receive our water until half an hour after we were seated. In addition to that, the waiter failed to tell us that one of the drinks (non-alcoholic) that we ordered was not available. At least have some courtesy to let us know that it's not available, so that we are not sitting there thinking that they are still making the drink.. Food was alright. The steak was supposed to be cooked medium well, but instead it tasted very rubbery. Their margherita pizza was mediocre. Oh, not to mention, the order of sweet potato fries came out at the same time as the desserts even tho we ordered the fries MUCH earlier. However, I did like their cookies and cream pizookie. The cookie dessert tasted very warm and went well with the scoop of vanilla ice cream. But the lack of service and attentiveness to our table definitely played a big part in why this place is getting 1 star from me."
Richard H.,"Austin, TX",0,16,,2.0,12/11/2017,"After my original post, I received an response from the general manager asking for another opportunity so they could send us a gift certificate if I would supply my e-mail address.  I responded stating that the general consensus of the other people in our party didn't want to go back, but I asked if the gift certificate could be used at another location.  You guessed it, NO RESPONSE BACK."
Stanley M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",144,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"I will NEVER be back because of how they disrespected one of our nations Veterans. My mom passed out last night(she had just given blood and was waiting to grab a table and eat after) while waiting for her table. She passed out in the front lobby of the restaurant. When the two managers on duty, diane and regina were alerted about what was going on, they didn't care to offer any food, help, or apologize for the wait, but INSTEAD requested that someone move my mom from the lobby. My mom is a veteran, and was celebrating veterans day. Unacceptable in every way. I am disgusted."
Rini S.,"Denver, CO",238,154,188,3.0,6/27/2017,"It's a decent place to come eat no doubt about it. Nothing really stands out in a good way or a bad way. The menu is extensive, the portions are big and service takes a reasonable amount of time. Their standout is the pizookie which is a delicious skillet cookie that comes in various flavors. All in all, it's a great place to come in a group and has a family-friendly atmosphere."
Tom B.,"Round Rock, TX",74,233,10,3.0,10/31/2016,"No frills, cheap eatery with a great beer selection and plenty of TV's for sports. BJ's doesn't pretend to be anything else so I think some of the other reviews are harsh. It's not really the spot you want to go for ""date night"" unless you both love football and your team is playing I guess. I sat at the bar and had the Santa Fe salad with cajun shrimp, it came quickly and was nice enough, well seasoned and fresh tasting. I'd put it in the same bracket as Razzoo's locally but if you want a slightly more upmarket sports bar in the area try Cover 3 down the road."
Sean T.,"Round Rock, TX",0,5,,2.0,10/29/2017,"Really sad that things haven't improved much since I wrote the last review.  Sure enough, twice bad luck for my recent visit.  1. Was looking forward to getting their Pumpkin ale,and believe it or not..they were completely out.  You would think that with all of their advertising on every table and in the front, they would have planned demand better.  Nope!  None in until Tuesday.  2. And then another large party of 10 or so is seated next to us.  You guessed it, completely forgotten, not even water refilled and forget any hint of dessert or maybe one more beer....  Just here's the tab, acting like it's time to leave so that we can all focus on the big party next to you. Sucks to be me I guess, and sad that I haven't learned a lesson about this place.  Kids...take it from me, there are MUCH better places in Round Rock to frequent these days."
Courtney H.,"Round Rock, TX",37,88,52,5.0,6/13/2017,"Always a great experience here! Call ahead for seating and get right in. Service is always good, and food is a wide variety of tasty items from creative appetizers to big, juicy burgers, huge pasta dishes and yummy pizza! Being a rewards member has some perks too... although I'd come here either way. It's family-friendly atmosphere is energetic but not too loud."
Michael Q.,"Austin, TX",43,224,67,4.0,11/23/2016,Half off select foods for happy hour! We are definitely in for that!  It's a big chain restaurant so you will get what you expect there so this will be a fairly short review. Overall the food is pretty good and no complaints on the happy hour deals either. Though I will say you need to get the soup in the bread bowl it is simply amazing! I got the broccoli cheddar soup in the bread bowl and they toast the top of the bread bowl with some kind of garlic butter and it was amazing!! Dip that bad boy into broccoli cheddar soup and oh man I was in heaven! So I definitely recommend getting that soup in the bread bowl while you were there! It is not on the happy hour special but get it trust me on this! Our waitress was great and kept our food and drinks coming! We will be back and seriously soup in the bread bowl can't emphasis that enough (though I did mention it 3 times in this review)
Karlyn K.,"Georgetown, TX",36,226,85,4.0,5/18/2017,Picked up take out. Love that I can call it in and they bring it. Food was so so. Quite disappointed that the pizza was barely covered in cheese. Lesson learned to ask for full coverage. All in all a good experience.
Umar K.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,5.0,10/22/2017,"The service here is great and the food is always good. Always! I love their loaded burgers and always order it from door dash when i get those rare ""I'm all alone and the family is not around"" moments 2-3 times a year."
Jodi F.,"Round Rock, TX",1,15,7,4.0,7/26/2017,"Are here last night, pretty standard for a BJ's.  Service was good (we sat at the bar) my drink was never empty!  For food we shared the Brussels sprouts and potato skins.. again can't go wrong.  Nothing exciting about our visit. Bj's is always ok for a quick bite or drinks!"
Christi R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,1,5.0,9/20/2017,"Came in Monday night with my son and we sat at the bar. Kate was super amazing! We had an issue with our order, but it was handled wonderfully and I have no issues with mistakes being made when they fix it and make it even better! Kate handled it professionally and with such a pleasant attitude! Now I only want to sit at the bar!"
Alexis E.,"Georgetown, TX",75,42,25,1.0,7/23/2017,WORST SERVICE EVER! I wish I could give this restaurant negative stars. I don't think they could have worse staff. Every person that came to our table was awful. Eye rolls and just walking off without any response.
Ed O.,"Round Rock, TX",0,13,32,4.0,5/23/2017,"It's probably been 6 months since I was here last.  And, it was again a positive experience.  Certainly, no special awards will be given for unique culinary offerings or rich ambiance.  But, for a flavorful meal, generous quantities, and expedient service, BJs comes through for the win. Their Piranha Pale Ale always satisfies, and is my beverage of choice.  The only thing I might suggest as an improvement is to turn the lights up a bit... it was bit too ""eating in a cave"" for me this evening."
Lori L.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,4,,1.0,11/10/2017,"We were seated at 5:45, and were 1/2hr late to a 7pm appointment.  Late.  As is had to get to-go containers because our food finally arrived at 6:40.  The underside of the plates were literally disgusting, one order was completely wrong, and a grand total of one refill all evening.  One. Suffice to say, we were extremely disappointed.  The manager did comp our appetizer and threw in desserts(to go, of course).  I hope our experience is isolated and not a trend, but we won't be back any time soon."
Shruthi B.,"Austin, TX",48,22,128,3.0,6/6/2016,"We have been to BJs a number of times in Austin and Round Rock, and we have had a pleasant experience all the time. Decor and ambience are very warm and inviting. Ample seating spaces and booths are great for a couple night or for team parties.  There are high tables and bar stools next to the huge TV screens for those who want to just grab a beer and watch sports. They have a decent brewery and a good mix of cocktails. Nutty brewnette is my favourite. Jeremiah Red and Porter are great too. Food selection for vegetarians is good, but calorie loaded!  The first-timers can try these - Avocado Egg Rolls,Veggie Pizza(customizable to your needs),sandwiches and Pizookie for dessert. These are pretty decent. Quantity served is huge for me. Pricing is a little higher. Crave for some cheesy food and beer, BJ's is a good option."
Rick B.,"Georgetown, TX",0,18,3,2.0,9/6/2017,"We eat at the Round Rock BJ's fairly often (monthly), love the atmosphere and location a lot.  Food quality was great when they opened, over the last year it is average at best.  We typically get a fun loving server which adds to the atmosphere, cool neighborhood sports bar Restaurant.  On our last visit on Sunday, 9/3 the cleanliness really stood out as very poor.  The table was wiped, likely with a towel that was already dirty and the menu's were awful.  The menu stuck to the table and my fingers when I picked it up, there were various food items smeared on a majority of pages.  This was on all the menus at our table, not an isolated thing at all.  We belong to their frequent diner club, but until they address their sanitation issues we will not be back."
Alyssa M.,"Clarksville, TN",125,88,49,3.0,6/21/2016,"The waiter, Gunner, is nice. The front door guy was super sweet. However I haven't waited for food this long since, well, the last time I was here. It's been over an hour since we have been here and if it was just adults I would be ok with that however we have 3 young kids who are now restless. Luckily our waiter got the kids food out early or I would have walked out at this point. I have never have a good experience here and I don't think I'll be back to try it again.  2 stars are only for the waiter and front door guy. Edited for the nice manager, so 3 stars.  It still took way too long for food and to get our check. We were there for a total of just over 2 hours."
Lynne H.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,,1.0,11/10/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend for a Veterans's Day meal. We were told there was a 20 minute wait, which was fine after 50 minutes we check how much longer we needed to wait, only to find out they had forgotten to text us, that our table was ready. We were sat and waited 10 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. Then waited another 20 minutes for our appetizer, which was spinach and artichoke dip, when it arrived it was stone cold in the middle. We sent it back, it returned after another 10 minutes with our entrees and was still cold. My boyfriend entree tasted as good as military MRE apparently. When we complained to the manageress she was completely uninterested. Really poor dining experience will not be returning"
Mike M.,"Keller, TX",0,8,3,1.0,7/31/2017,"Probably the worst experience ever. Starting with a server with a put on corn pone accent to a filthy restaurant at 330 in the afternoon. Order apps. Get no plates or silver.  Ask for three times finally server comes with handful of forks and napkins unrolled and proceeds to juggle and attempt to place them. Youngest picked up his mistakes and he was clueless that it was off the floor.  Not all his fault, the unsmiling front of house people standing around should have been rolling silver or cleaning. If you got time to lean you have time to clean. First rule.  Be a while before we try BJ's  again.  For the price we paid for lunch I would expect at least competent service. Over $80 for hamburgers and chicken fingers and 1 beer you would think a fork and a napkin would have been provided."
Matthew T.,"Austin, TX",20,161,148,3.0,12/31/2016,"Don't come here expecting the best meal. It's not very consistent, you can tell most things are not made fresh here. I've had some good meals here and some not so good. I come here cause it's so close to home. Sometimes it's the only thing open around the holidays.  Great for large groups, games and drinks."
Angel D.,"Honolulu, HI",253,333,1370,5.0,6/3/2016,"after going to the BJ's in Georgetown, we found out there was a BJ's closer to Killeen. this location is very big and has a lot of parking. I was very happy with my first experience because I love craft beer and to find out that they brew their own beers; lured me in! we got two flights of beers and tried pretty much all their home-brewed beer. my favorite has to be the peach and their IPA. we also got lucky because we sat at the bar and this lady next to us ordered hamburger sliders but they were too overcooked to her liking so she gave it to us. we didn't mind well done hamburger sliders... it was free :P"
Brad Z.,"Round Rock, TX",27,5,1,1.0,4/8/2017,Slow to get table.. slow to get drinks... slow to get food... slow to get check... just plain slow
Vanessa C.,"Pflugerville, TX",141,25,23,5.0,5/4/2017,We come to or order from BJs a few times a week. I get the salmon quinoa and he gets jambalaya. Consistently good. Consistently seasoned.
Amanda P.,"St. Charles, MO",133,22,8,3.0,9/3/2016,Meagan P was our server. We are in town on vacation and don't have the kids with us. We wanted to just have a dessert to indulge in the evening. The pizookie was amazing! The server was annoyed. The moment I said we were just having dessert her annoyance was apparent. Our food came out quickly... It was delicious... But our water was empty almost the whole time...  And she dropped the check mins after our food was brought out.... She even tried to pick up the check when we had no even looked at it and we're still eating.  It was less than pleasurable. Thanks Meagan P!
R C.,"East Meadow, NY",6,94,191,5.0,2/13/2016,"We had Jambalaya and Bison burger for entree after having fried calamari for appetizer. As this is my first time to eat the entrees, I should say that they are the best-tasting thus far. Now I know why people crave to eat bison meat. It has its own unique taste compared to beef. It might be a little strong-tasting for others but for me it is just perfect. The jambalaya is indeed the epitome of cajun spicy cooking. Kudos to the chef. The waitress was amazing. I am basing my 5 stars only on food, ambience and food serving. The reception guy who gives you your estimated seat time needs improvement. We even had to ask for our waiting beeper. Our 30 minute wait estimate was more like an hour."
G T.,"Manchaca, TX",0,11,,1.0,10/2/2017,"MSG, MSG, MSG. If that is your thing go there.  My wife got MSG sick from eating there.  Don't go there if you are allergic to MSG."
Troy H.,"Round Rock, TX",191,826,1179,4.0,4/4/2016,"I don't get to come as often as I'd like, but I do appreciate it when I do; a nice meal with a good beer and friendly staff.   I have been here a few times and I see why there is always a line. You can watch some sports, have a nice dinner, host a birthday party, or just meet up with friends.   My favorites in food here so far are the:  - guacamole and chips  - roasted salsa and chips  - the calamari  - the Roast Beef Dip (aka French Dip)  ~ and some others I cannot remember   For drinks, I pretty much stay with an Arnold Palmer with Unsweet Tea and of course the local BJ Brew of Hefeweisen with an Orange slice.   Overall, you may pay a little more for some things, but you have to look at overall what you are getting. Good times, good staff, and good quality time when you are out for eats or drinks."
Chad M.,"Round Rock, TX",3,16,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Apparently food quality has slipped dramatically in the past few months. I ordered a Nashville hot chicken sandwich and the chicken barely filled half the bun, was only a quarter inch thick, and dry. When I brought it to the attention of the staff they brought it to the kitchen only to have the same sandwich returned to me and be told this is the normal size. To be fully transparent, they did comp half the price. My wife also shared with me that her ham and cheese was primarily cheese. Never did a manger greet us, ask about our meal, or discuss our dissatisfaction with the meal.  We've been going to BJ's restaurants for over 12 years. Our most recent trip has indicated they have gone full corporate and begun cutting costs at the expense of diner satisfaction.  I will certainly not be one to initiate a trip back to BJ's in the future."
M. R.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/2/2016,"Our server, Amanda was so sweet and attentive; I give her 5 stars!  The food is abysmal.  There are far better restaurants for less money.  I'd rather eat at Denny's....."
