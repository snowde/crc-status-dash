Kay B.,"The Drag, Austin, TX",96,17,4,3.0,7/10/2014,"Been here several times and for the most part, the food product is pretty decent. Service is so, so, but great reward program. Ill be back, but improvements can be made across the board."
David M.,"Georgetown, TX",0,1,,4.0,10/12/2013,"Have been here several times and love it. Good service and good food. Amber, our wait person, was wonderful. The Thai lettuce wraps are always good. I have read other negative reviews, to include the couple with the misbehaving toddler; if they aren't behaving, take them outside. No one appreciates a loud child and I have raised five kids. This is a good restaurant with reliable service."
Stephanie N.,"Round Rock, TX",1,14,,5.0,8/12/2015,I love this BJ's! We always have great food and drinks here. The staff is always friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend eating here any time.
Tiffany B.,"Cedar Park, TX",44,3,,2.0,4/28/2016,"We went to this BJ's location on Sunday afternoon 4/24/16. Apparently that was when all the parties were going on. We should have left when we saw the crowds but had tried BJ's before and enjoyed it, plus it was my husbands birthday and he requested it. There were large parties everywhere and I guess they just couldn't handle it. Our waiter was running ragged and we waited over 30 min for a dessert that never came. We sent a different waiter to check on it but he never came back either.When we finally went up front to ask for a refund for the dessert (our waiter was long gone and waiting on another party)the girl said she'd have to find her manager but instead there was more waiting so we paid 15.00 for over priced dessert that we never actually got to eat. I found it odd that they brought the check before our meal was even finished. Stupid on our part to pay before you've eaten. The food I did get was okay. I got the parm. crusted chicken and my hubby and another in our group got the jambalaya. Reviews seemed mediocre. Kids meals were decent sizes and they seemed to enjoy it. Maybe come in the middle of the day like we did the first visit.  Or pack your patience."
Hugh P.,"Austin, TX",14,41,34,2.0,12/18/2013,"With all the original/true brewery restaurants to try, why go to the Mc Donalds of them?  They do not brew beer on site, the menu is as generic as possible, and the one thing that a brewery restaurant must have (IMO) is beer batter cod.  This place says they use cod, but it is not!  Another profit exploit, sell trash fish for good fish."
Sonya S.,"Round Rock, TX",25,11,,2.0,11/8/2014,"So food wise this place is great, service wise not so much. On 11/07/14 was my birthday. My kids and I decided to eat there before heading back for another celebration that they had planned for me with there friends. My daughter decides to tell the waiter ""Nick"" that its my birthday, she had been telling people all day, because she wanted to make sure it was special for me. I don't know if the waiter just didn't care or if he didn't believe her, but afterwards our service just went down hill. He brought us our food and after we where done we sat there for 10 min before anyone came over the clear our plates and the person that cleared them wasn't even him.  Then we sat for another 10 min before he brought over the check. Even when we were eating, not one time did he top off drinks or even ask if the food was ok. I'm sure restaurants get lots of people that try to scam for free deserts, but I'm not one of them. I am not even much of a sugar eater and would have refused the dessert if it was offered. My children just wanted my day to be acknowledged, fun, and special. Can't say I would recommend this place for any birthday dinners."
Aurora L.,"Georgetown, TX",8,22,,5.0,6/2/2015,"I have been to multiple locations and never been disappointed. If I am ordering the pasta and salad lunch or the Moroccan salmon dinner, the food is always top notch.  I absolutely love the tomato bisque soup."
Brandy M.,"Pflugerville, TX",486,10,47,4.0,7/20/2013,"Enjoy going to BJ's on a date, with family or friends Chicken lettuce wraps are delicious and there are a lot of tasty options. The service is good and the staff friendly. If going for cocktails, try the Pink Cadillac."
W L.,"Austin, TX",0,40,,5.0,7/13/2015,They aim to please and will fix any problems.  I avoid them during busy times as I really like to go there to relax and not worry about my food/drink.
Deanna M.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,7,16,3.0,5/16/2014,"The only thing that might bring us back is the food. Pizza is pretty good and our appetizers were okay. We got the mozzarella sticks (large portion but good!) and mini Bruchetta (just..eh). Service here is just awful. Be prepared to wait very long for drinks, extra sauce, etc. I'd recommend ordering your next beer well before you are done if it's somewhat busy. I am also pretty sure that our second beer was the ""light"" not the ""blond"". At that point there was no use asking for another as we'd likely be ready to go once it made it to our table. The fastest service we got tonight? Them charging our card - was back with our card within a minute. Where was that kind of service the rest of the meal? Huge disappointment!"
Joann C.,"Round Rock, TX",76,2,,5.0,3/23/2014,Been going here since April of last year and I LOVE IT!!! I always have great service and the employees are very nice. I LOVE their chicken tortilla soup and their hamburgers are the BOMB!!! They are know for their pizza and beers. They are good too. They also make their own root beer and their prices are reasonable. I have gone to many Bj's and they are all great. They also have good desserts.Try it and you won't be disappointed.
Rod W.,"Winslow, AZ",2,52,9,3.0,2/15/2014,It was just ok. Nothing exceptional. Sliders were too dry. Service was ok. Our food didn't come out at the same time. Pet peeve of mine I guess. Waiter was friendly. It was a little loud for me.
Mazz M.,"Austin, TX",3,3,1,3.0,6/15/2014,"I usually eat at another location,  and by comparison,  this one overall can't touch the north bjs"
Jessica M.,"Leander, TX",53,12,,1.0,3/4/2013,"I was greatly disappointed by BJ's.  I will think multiple times before I go back.  We started off with plans to go somewhere else, but the wait there was up to a hour and a half.  So, BJ's wasn't far away and we figured we would try it out since their wait was only 15 mins. So, we finally get a table and the waiter comes after about 5 minutes of us sitting there.  He seemed nice at first. I was in a Cajun sort of mood so I thought I'd try the jambalaya, when I asked what he thought of it he said that the only complaint people have is it's spicy.  Okay, I can handle that.  It seemed like the chef just grabbed some seasoning and went to town with the dish.  It was very overpowering. My boyfriend ordered a calzone.  The thing was barely the size of a sandwich.  He was so disappointed that he grabbed a McDonald's burger after we left. Another friend, ordered a burger and fries.  Her fries?  They were cold.   Another friend had the nachos, yeah he wasn't happy either. We were willing to overlook the food, BUT there's several things I've learned in working in the restaurant industry.   ONE: You should never let a customer not have a full glass!   This guy knowing he gave me a spicy dish, was no where to be found and I had nothing to drink!  I was getting pissed. TWO: Once one person finishes their dish because you gave them a tiny calzone, don't ask the whole table about dessert!  That was just stupid, no one was even close to being done. Lastly, once you've given the check, DON'T disappear!  The customers are ready to go!  Well he disappeared and we wanted to give him our money so we could get change and leave.   At this point the restaurant was freezing too.  Here's a tip for the place, once the restaurant clears out, turn the heater up just a tad! So, we ask another waitress to get our waiter for us.  What does she say to us?  ""Who is your waiter?"" After we search the check for his name, we tell her and she says, ""Wow you should learn his name!""  My thoughts?  DUDE!!  The guy actually has to come around for us to remember his name!   Overall... yeah I wasn't impressed.  Oh yeah!  and my boyfriend is a Bud Lite guy.  Period.  None of this fancy stuff they make.  So the waiter insisted he try a sample of their specialty.  When we receive our check, guess what we got charged for?!?!  What does ""sample"" mean to you?  It means a free small portion to me.  Yes it wasn't a large charge, but don't charge us for something we didn't want!  Ridiculous."
Teresa T.,"Round Rock, TX",58,51,15,5.0,12/19/2013,"BJ's never ceases to amaze me! The avocado eggrolls are one of my favorite dishes ever and their handcrafted brews are delicious. I absolutely love their hef but the seasonal pumpkin is on my top 5 beers ever (and growing up with a brewer for an older brother, I've had more than my fair share of beer tasting). Great place to spend with family, friends and colleagues alike! I've had business meetings here, large group gatherings, catching the game with friends and so much more. My advice to you... if you see a BJ's then STOP and go in!"
Scott H.,"Round Rock, TX",0,10,,2.0,5/25/2015,New to the area and went there on the weekend as it looked nice outside. We both had sandwiches and both were pretty bland. Very mediocre food. I had a Guiness and it was a bad pour.  Some dirty silverware. Service was good but not enough to overcome mediocre food. First and last visit. Not worth it; go somewhere else.
Mary S.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,7,,1.0,11/28/2015,"Went in for dinner with the family. We found a table in the bar right away, however there wete multiple wait staff and even with that we weren't waited on righr away. We finally got drinks and ordered an appetizer. The drinks arrived and we went ahead and ordered dinner. Next thjng   being delivered with the girls thumb in the bowl and still no appetizer. It would be right out. Well guess what it wasn't and then dinner came out...asked them to cancel appetizer and then it came out by manager who we told we canceled order but he didn't even bother to ask why....this was our 4th time here and it was bad service, order and our only offer of apology came from a waiter who brought us a free pazookie....for the 3rd tine.  The manager walked around all night and didn't acknowledge or make eye contact with any customer.  This was pitiful and we will NOT be going back for over priced bad food and service !!!!"
Baldo B.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/12/2015,"We have been a rewards member since the store opened years ago. The first year of their operation was excellent. Food cooked good and the hosts were courteous and would frequently come to the table to asked what the customers needs.  The manager too was readily available if needed be and would try to appease customers if there is something wrong with your orders.  As the years passed, the store, the food and its service is on a steady decline. Most of the hosts  are rude and looks tired and does not seem to know what they're doing. My last bad experience in this place was on Mother's Day. My wife ordered a ribeye steak, medium well.  The hostess told us that they might be out of ribeye and later found out there is one more left.  When the steak was served, it was visibly burnt. This is not the first time that we ordered steak and it was served burnt. And I'm always austounded that it reached our table on its burnt state. It seems that that quality control, if there is one is very poor in the kitchen.  Since that was the last ribeye steak, they can't cook us another one. The manager talked to us briefly and apologized about it and offered us a dessert that we respectfully declined.  As we were about to finished eating and boxing our leftovers. A male and a female hosts came to our table and asked us to pass the used plates, when they can clearly see that we were busy boxing our food.  I told them, ""Can you just do it later?"" But they just stood there, waiting and leaving us no choice but to pass them the plates.  My expectation was that the hostess would ask us if they could box the food for us instead of helping them tidying the table.            I don't want to see this store lose business here in round rock. I hope they would bring the same experiences that we had when it newly opened, good food and good service."
Lisa F.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,5.0,5/10/2015,Excellent Restaurant with excellent service! The chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes  are they best in this area.
Ash R.,"Leander, TX",1,8,,4.0,3/19/2014,"Clean place and great service. Definitely a good place to go if you wanna have a good vibe and decent crowd to hang out with. The food is all good and their beer selection is really decent plus their ""home brewed"" beer is great. Would go back no questions asked!!"
