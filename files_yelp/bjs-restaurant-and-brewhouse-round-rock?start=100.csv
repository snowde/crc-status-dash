cristina h.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,2,2.0,9/3/2015,"This restaurant is consistently below average for me. Most of the time we sit in the bar area and it takes quite a while to be acknowledged. This time, service was good but the garnish on my plate looked like it had been dropped on the ground and stomped on. I'd like to ask anybody in their kitchen if they would eat what was put on my plate. Also, my layered beer was served all mixed up already and wasn't as great as it could have been. I'm not sure how many more chances I can give."
Monica S.,"Jarrell, TX",0,15,,5.0,5/26/2016,Our server Amanda P was the best we've had at any restaurant in years. They did not like how my appetizer turned out so they did not charge me for it. In fact they gave me two. We will definitely return to this restaurant in the future. I will be sure to ask for Amanda P as my server.
Angel H.,"Round Rock, TX",24,42,20,1.0,8/5/2014,"I called ahead to make reservations, yet when we got there they said we weren't on the list. I had called 20 minutes in advance and confimed location + phone number once I got there. We had a party of 8, I was starving and ended up waiting 25 minutes for a table. I got no apology and the greeter was being rude to our group. Once we sat, the waiter was great. We ordered fried calamari, it was Delicious.  A bit expensive for me. 20$ for pizza for one person. They have the best thin sliced fries. Cocktails are okay. They are known for their beers. I'd only go back for the fries. Not for service or anything else."
Steve B.,"Manor, TX",0,18,2,1.0,12/21/2014,Just had lunch and chose B.J. 'S because in the past the food has been awesome - not anymore.  It reminds me of what happened to Chili's when they went from actually making food to warming it up.  The lasagna had to be frozen and warmed in a deep dish pizza pan - no flavor and sausage nuggets were awful.  My son and myself had burgers.  The patty didn't even cover 1/2 the bun - weird!  Pizza was still good and service was great.  We have been going to BJ'S since they've been around and they were known for great fresh made food but it's gotten cheap.  I don't mind paying for great food but 2 days ago we went to mooya burgers right next door and paid the same for 5 and the food was just that much better.
Deanna B.,"Round Rock, TX",18,118,110,4.0,8/24/2012,"I dig BJs. Maybe its the sports tv that can be seen from any seat, Maybe its that they have tuned a game to my request in the past. Maybe its the beer they brew. Maybe its the fish tacos. Its all good. It is highly recommended to call ahead for seating. The wait will be long if you don't. Give yourself plenty of time to browse the huge menu too. Like I said before, I'm a fan of their fried fish tacos.  I have never been disappointed with service here but then maybe I am more patient and forgiving than some. The servers are human after all, and I'm not sure I could do a better job of it."
Chris O.,"Austin, TX",0,21,,4.0,1/18/2016,Service was very good! Steven was prompt and attentive...very cordial with sincerity. The food is getting better. The pizzas have always been good. I had the seared tuna salad and it was very tasty...the only exception was the wasabi was a bit too hit and strong. My son had the BJ's super burger and said it was delicious and it was huge. I will go back to make sure things continue to improve.
Darin J.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,4,,1.0,2/7/2016,"Had a birthday day dinner for my wife on Wednesday night for 10 people. We arrived at 5:10pm and the place was empty, between the manager on duty and the host it took 10 minutes to figure out where to set a party of 10. ( Now there was only 2 tables with guest when we got there) Finally got seated and our Server Jamie acted like he was to busy to have a big table. Ordered our food at 5:50 and at 6:30 I ask Jamie if our food was almost ready and is commit was""I don't know"" and he walked off. My wife went to get the manager and she went to check and our food started coming out one thing at a time. My food was cold ""Baked Ravioli""  rest of our  table had soup and flat bread pizza.  My Granddaughters soup was supposed to be in a bread bowl and when it came out not in a bread bowl Jamie said only one bread bowl was ordered. Not I'm sorry or anything.  Over really bad experience for us!!!"
Cliff S.,"Copperas Cove, TX",43,45,68,5.0,10/31/2015,STILL GREAT IN EVERY WAY!! This restaurant sets the bar very high. Others really can't easily compete.
Kelly E.,"Round Rock, TX",15,10,2,2.0,1/3/2016,"Our waitress was great, the steak was good but the rest was bad. I had ordered the house top sirloin with baked potato and roasted asparagus. The food came out and no butter or sour cream and the asparagus was horrible. They looked as if they were thrown in the oven no seasoning at all. Looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Our waitress went back the kitchen and had them sautéed some up for me. The manager who delivered to our table said absolutely nothing to me and walked off. We come here often enough but I will definitely be looking elsewhere in the future."
Melissa W.,"Cedar Park, TX",15,8,18,5.0,1/1/2015,"Very excited they opened a BJ's in Cedar Park!  I LOVE their menu. I start with their avocado rolls, delicious!  Everything on the menu is delicious. Plenty of parking, great bar area, excellent service. Great pizza's!"
Tim F.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,6,,1.0,9/5/2015,"We had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table.  We were overwhelmed with the drink and food selection.  The drinks are expensive and weak.  Margaritas are hand made, but they are cheap with the liquor.  The food  was good, but overpriced for what we paid for.  Our server also took a 30 minute break and it took forever to get our  final bill.   I don't think I'm going back.   My advice to management:  make better drinks and don't be stingy with the liquor and reduce your menu to what you do best or sale the most of.   I would put this place in the same category as Red Lobster.....big chain restaurant."
Derek B.,"Temple, TX",76,16,1,5.0,12/23/2015,"Gone here many times after work to grab a quick bite to eat, and usually works out well for me since its during their happy hour. Everything I've tried has been fantastic and there beer selection is also good. There BJ's house beers are actually really good. Service has always been fast, friendly, and never disappointed."
Jay C.,"Dallas, TX",19,23,59,1.0,7/9/2015,"Sierra was our waitress, rude gal.  She never checked up on us.  I waited 20 mins for a refill.  I really liked this place, in the past the service was great.  Sierra is the worst server there.  If you eat here and have her run the other way.  She'll argue and ignore you."
Tim F.,"Round Rock, TX",71,11,2,3.0,6/24/2016,"Came here on Wednesday around lunch hour and the appetizer (avocado egg rolls) along with the entree's (chicken Parmesan chicken and shrimp asparagus penne) were really good, so we decided to come back last night for dinner.  We arrived about 6-ish, so it was dinner time, however, there were more empty tables then full, so the place wasn't too crowded.  We sat down at 6:08 (I only know this from the ticket we received when checking in) and 30 minutes had gone by and not one waitress/waiter stopped at our table (the servers who WERE walking around wouldn't even give us eye contact and they all looked like they hated their jobs and didn't want to be there).   There were two families that arrived after us, one of them already had drinks and was ordering their food and the second, already had an appetizer on the table.   We walked out and told the hostess we were waiting for 30 mins and no one served us so we are leaving and all she said was ""oh, ok"".    I was very pleased with this place on Wednesday (server's name was Blanca who was GREAT), however, yesterday's experience will keep me from coming back for awhile."
Gary P.,"El Pueblito, Mexico",12,426,34,3.0,9/16/2014,Welcoming environment  Good business lunch venue. Plenty of adjacent parking.  Large capacity.  Noise volume is acceptable for easy conversation. Chicken Taco was delightful  Full of fresh ingredients & southwest flavor.
Michelle O.,"TX, TX",0,9,,5.0,12/30/2014,"Every time we go, the food is amazing! We use the online app and put our names on the wait list. We've never had a wait longer than 5 minutes! Appetizers, main dishes, drinks and desserts are all fantastic."
Soubhi K.,"Round Rock, TX",76,124,,4.0,8/16/2014,"We had a good experience here, good food, good service for a busy Friday night, good drinks.  We'd go back. We waited 15 mins for a table, really not bad on a Friday at 7 PM.  Our waitress came right away and our drinks came out fast.  The Berry Cider is yummy. I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was great, served over pineapple fried rice.  Hubby got pan seared scallops, also very good.  For dessert we got the peach cobbler and the baked beignets.   Mmmmmmm. Our water glasses stayed filled, our check came in a timely manner.  No complaints!"
oskier c.,"Austin, TX",0,41,,2.0,11/25/2016,"One word: S-L-O-W.  Got here around 7:10ish.  We did take a while to order our dinner because we had never been to the restaurant before and looked through their extensive menu.  Finally decided on an app and three entrees.  We got our app in a reasonable amount of time, what you would expect.  Finished the app and waited. . .waited. . .waited. . .waited.  It got to the point where we were debating where we should just leave cash on the table and leave.  We couldn't find our waitress either.  Usually, if the kitchen is backed up, the wait staff will swing by and tell the patrons.  Nada.  It didn't seem like an usually busy night, either.  We were seated immeditely and there were some empty tables.   I also didn't see any unusually large groups which can slow a kitchen down.  We finally got our entrees after flagging the waitress down.  This was at least 45 minutes after finishing our app.  Our food wasn't piping hot, so I'm sure it was probably sitting in the kitchen for a little bit. The food itself wasn't bad.  So for an app and three entrees (no drinks, no dessert), we got out of the restaurant in about 2 hours.  Not at all what I would expect for a restaurant of this type.  If you have time to waste, come on by.  If you don't, there are other restaurants close by that I'm sure will take care of you in a more timely manner."
Mark L.,"Copperas Cove, TX",133,51,28,3.0,7/30/2015,Beer and drink selection was great. Service and food was less than stellar. It's a good place to check out of your haven't yet.
Nicole S.,"Round Rock, TX",0,7,,2.0,4/23/2015,"Had dinner here last night with my family as I have on many occasions, usually it's decent but last night our experience was crappy to say the least. The hostess was rude and looked miserable everytime I saw her. Service wasn't that great and food was alright... not sure if we will be back to this location."
