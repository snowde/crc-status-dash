Michael S.,"Liberty Hill, TX",32,92,22,5.0,12/8/2014,I ordered the Mediterranean  tacos and must say it was pretty awesome and service was fast and friendly! Must say was nervous about all the 3 stars and glad I gave it a try I will be coming back again.
Suruchi K.,"Round Rock, TX",3,53,,3.0,6/18/2015,"Staff is nice, ambience is nice but the food is meh. And pricey. I think this is a better spot happy hour and apps or cocktails and desserts."
Kimberly N.,"Round Rock, TX",63,90,11,5.0,7/10/2015,"Cierra is an amazing waitress! She waited on our group for my sister's birthday! She had a great sense of humor and was very prompt with our drinks and food. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. It all looked and tasted amazing. And they brought my sister a cookies and cream cookie and ice cream dessert for free. Mmm mmm mmm! I definitely recomend the cookie trio for dessert. I will definitely be coming back here, they have such a wide variety to choose from! Love love love it!!!"
Michelle H.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/24/2014,"Food is great. Service sucks. My fiance and I waited 10 minutes for a drink order and another 10 for our drinks. The waitress forgot our daughters juice. We finally were able to place our order. Food came out quickly. But of course, our daughters grilled cheese was forgotten. We felt rushed because we were in the middle of eating our meals and she asked us if we wanted dessert. Maybe she was asking us for dessert early, because she knows itd take her 20 to ring it in. The lady who brought our food and checked on us deserved the tip. Would go back. But would definitely not have her as a waitress again."
Tiffany S.,"San Diego, CA",454,153,643,5.0,12/19/2014,"I've had several things here and they are all so good. The pot stickers are absolutely amazing! My favorite is the lemon thyme chicken plate, the chicken is so moist and perfectly seasoned. They have wonderful pizzas and flatbreads. I've had the Mediterranean with feta and olives yummy!! All of the staff I've ever encountered with are so friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. I'm beyond impressed with the quality of meal and service."
Kim S.,"Pflugerville, TX",79,294,29,3.0,4/28/2014,"I am not a giant BJ's fan.  It was just okay, and I keep trying to see if it will get better...glutton for punishment???"
Dallas H.,"Round Rock, TX",2,6,,1.0,11/22/2014,"My wife and I have been married for sixteen years. We have three kids. A night out without them is rare (and sacred). So we were really excited about going to BJ's for dinner and drinks last night (11/21/14). I've been one of BJ's ""Premier Rewards"" members since they opened in RR, so I opened the app and added our name to the waitlist before we left the house. We drove up ~10 minutes later,  checked in at the hostess stand where we were told it would be ""about 15 minutes"" until we were seated. So we waited patiently for almost half an hour (listening to a toddler in the lobby shrieking her lungs out) before we were seated...five feet from the lobby. Our waitress then rushed us through the entire meal, while simultaneously getting almost every aspect of it WRONG! My wife got the wrong salad and was told that it was just ""tough for whoever ordered it"" by the waitress.  We both ordered our steaks medium-rare and they were both delivered closer to well-done. And they both came with the wrong sides - who orders mashed AND baked potatoes? I then ordered a sampler of four beers...which NEVER came out. Then the waitress returns, lays down the check and says, ""Still don't want dessert, huh?"" and walks away. Yeah. This was BY FAR the worst experience we've ever had at BJ's."
Tina H.,"Round Rock, TX",55,96,2,4.0,12/22/2013,"My husband was starving after playing a round of golf so we wanted to go somewhere nearby home.  BJs is always consistently good for us  - good food with good service and just minutes away. We almost always sit in a booth at the bar so we can just seat ourselves quickly and watch some sports as we relax.   We ordered our usual:  hubby got his fish and chips with thin crispy fries and I got my grilled chicken club sandwich, no cheese, with thin crispy fries.  We also got some bone-in hot wings as an appetizer.  The combination of the grilled chicken, perfectly cooked thick bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo on grilled sourdough is perfection.  My husband loves fish and chips and BJs always does it well. Service has always been really great at this BJs for us.  Whenever we don't feel like going far and just want a decent meal we can depend on with good service, we look to BJs."
Cynthia S.,"Round Rock, TX",3,33,5,2.0,11/7/2014,"I've been to BJ's a handful of times and everytime time I leave feeling like I wasted my money.  The reason I give BJ's two stars is for the atmosphere/building and the beer.  The food is overpriced, bland, and the pizza isn't good either.  I've had all sorts of things on the menu ranging from all the appetizers to sandwiches to pizza to chicken and other dishes.  All of them were not tasty and I left wishing I didn't have to pay the overpriced fee for the unimpressive meal I just had. The only reason I even go to BJ's is when a friend wants to and it will pretty much stay that way, unless I can convince them otherwise."
T H.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,72,15,1.0,3/17/2016,"This wasn't my first time visit, but it will be my last for quite awhile. The place was pretty busy for 7pm in the middle of the week, but it looked like that things were moving. We were seated and started to look over the menu. During this time, all the tables around us were filled a few minutes after we were. We were engaged in a conversation and didn't quite realize exactly how long we were there without anyone speaking to us. The table in front of us had drinks an appetizers and behind us had drinks as well. Also, at least 4 server and hostesses walked past without a greeting.  We nearly left when the  server finally came over and asked us for the drink order. No apologies for the wait even I brought it up. We should have left, but I was outvoted. The food was mediocre, service was slow and  the bill was too much. Next time, we will go somewhere else."
Matt B.,"Round Rock, TX",19,186,22,3.0,5/18/2014,This is a large chain of restaurants.  I am not really a fan of chain  restaurants. Personally I think local business owners and locally sourced food is better and healthier for you. However I will leave that thought out of the review. BJ's specialty is pizza. The prices are on the higher side and it offers a lot of options and could be considered a higher end type of pizza. However the food is just not that great. The attraction is probably the whole package which is beer and pizza in a family type restaurant setting.  There are better options for pizza that cost less money. There are also better options for beer that costs less money. If you want both together then BJ's is a good choice.
J. S.,"Elephant Butte, NM",9,39,6,4.0,10/25/2015,"Good food. Better than Chilis, Applebee's, and Fridays but nothing special on the menu to have a huge lead on them."
Jake A.,"Austin, TX",0,28,117,4.0,4/5/2014,Great service and many beers on draft. Try the California burger! Can't get enough of it!
Doris H.,"Georgetown, TX",0,1,,5.0,4/19/2016,"We have been to this location several times and never had bad service or bad food. Went yesterday for lunch, but after the lunch crowd was gone,1:30pm. Not busy and all got seated quickly. Our waitdress was pleasant and helpful. Refilled drinks without asking and her recommendations were awesome."
Tim C.,"Williamson County, TX",855,1036,10976,4.0,6/18/2013,"The meatlover's regular crust pizza was excellent, shared it with my wife."
Vincent H.,"Round Rock, TX",26,14,46,1.0,4/26/2013,"I called the Round Rock, Texas location yesterday, using their ""call ahead"" service to avoid the wait. I gave them my name and when I got there, they said, ""I wasn't in their system"" and that "" it would be a 30 to 45 minutes wait"" ...!  When I explained that I used their ""call ahead service,"" the greeting staff explained that I must have called the wrong store location.  When I showed them my cell phone call log and how the phone number matched the business card number on the counter, they didn't believe me and that there wasn't anything that they could do.  There is something they could do, they could find out why it didn't work! Or stop offering the service.  One star until they get it fixed.  The Texas Land and Cattle restaurant down the street had a 5 star steak."
Bill B.,"Round Rock, TX",0,2,,1.0,12/11/2014,"The steak was a good cut and cooked perfectly,  but was so heavily seasoned it was almost inedible. Also, my salad was brought after the main course. We had a party of 7, and were sat at a booth that was very tight for our number. Unimpressed and won't be back."
Nicole K.,"Honolulu, HI",13,3,1,1.0,4/30/2013,"I love BJ's (normally)! I love the food, I love the variety of their menu, but  the Round Rock location is a horrible representation of this chain! 1st disappointment: about a month ago - friends that relocated to Denver, were in town for the week and insisted that we go to eat at BJ's as they missed it so much. We ordered 2 appetizers, only one showed up, 20 mins later. When we asked where the second one was, we were told it would be right out. The waiter returned and said there was a problem with our order, but the manager would come talk to us. Which he did, explaining that the conveyor belt in the kitchen was broken and that our dish fell off, so they had to make a new one (In other words, they forgot to put the order in). So, after 30 mins total we finally received our complete order of appetizers. Then our entrees came out, they got 3 out of 4 right! We chopped it up as a loss and hoped that it was just an off night. Last disappointment: Tonight - I figured it was one bad experience, I'd give it another try. BIG MISTAKE! We were seated immediately but waited 15 mins just for 1 beer, which is more than I can say for our appetizer. Again, it never showed up! People that were seated after us were getting their food. When our waiter finally made it back to our table, after being seated for 35 mins now, he told us that our meals would be right out! When we asked about our appetizer, he didn't know where it was. Obviously our food was coming, so we ""cancelled"" it. My meal was mediocre, not hot, kinda warm but I was starving. We were given a ""free"" dessert, which I'm pretty sure wasn't free as they overcharged me for my meal. But at this point a few extra dollars wasn't worth the trouble. I was just ready to get out of there! As much as I loved this place, I will never return to this location, EVER! And hopefully it has not tainted my dining experience with BJ's. ;("
E. L.,"Austin, TX",1,17,,2.0,1/26/2015,"Have eaten at the Sunset Valley location before, but this was our first time at the Round Rock Bj's (because located within spitting distance of IKEA).  The pros: wait estimate was pretty accurate; place is super kid-friendly, and their house beers are decent.  Not so pro: oh my god the chili. Ordered chili in a bread bowl and wow. I'd bet a week's salary that the chili came right out of a can. But I have to guess the can had been opened about a month before I sat down at the table. Seriously, folks, this was the worst chili I can ever recall eating in a restaurant. Just bad.  I imagine I'll probably be back to a BJ's sometime because it's convenient and reasonably priced. But I know what I won't be ordering."
Jake G.,"Houston, TX",24,28,,5.0,4/18/2015,"Great service and accommodations by the staff, especially for a wedding rehearsal dinner for about 50+. Nate was our waiter and took great care of us. Good job."
