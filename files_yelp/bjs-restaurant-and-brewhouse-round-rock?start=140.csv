James J.,"Austin, TX",103,91,19,3.0,1/11/2015,"I took a ride with a pink Cadillac in my hand which must've been the Cadillac ATS cause it was about 3oz full. I had the chicken parm which was ok. For the app we tried their bruschetta which was also ok. A bit on the pricier side, I think it could be a bit better."
Cynthia M.,"Georgetown, TX",4,25,,5.0,11/15/2013,Gotta love a great lunch where you feel cozy and relaxed.  This is the place.    Flatbread pizza and salad are great.  Waitstaff is excellent.  No wonder it's hard to get a job here.   The location is great if you're starving from shopping at the Outlet Mall
Kristina C.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,32,,4.0,8/2/2013,"I really like the options here. A big menu to please anybody you bring. And the beer selection is large, too.  The staff is very friendly.  There can be a bit of a wait during the standard times."
Nick L.,"Round Rock, TX",391,66,174,3.0,3/4/2015,I am not a huge fan of the food. The pizza is okay. I hit up this place for one reason and it's called a pazookie!!! Service was decent and the drinks are pretty good.
Lysa S.,"Georgetown, TX",290,21,1,4.0,2/20/2014,Today was the second time I had been to this place. I ordered the lunch special: Half sandwich and soup. I I had the delicious clam chowder and the California Chicken sandwich. The soup was pretty close to perfect. The consistency was perfect. I hate when soups are too thick and this one wasn't. The flavor was tasty and it was served hot and fresh.  My sandwich was also great. It had sauteed green chiles in it and avocado with a yummy sauce (might have been a chipotle mayo or something) and grilled chicken. The only thing the sandwich lacked was lettuce.   The service was great and so was the dessert. I was very pleased.
Erinn H.,"Round Rock, TX",20,41,,4.0,7/2/2013,"Pros: Love their frequent dining club.  The salads are amazing, the flat bread rocks,the pizookie is my favorite. The servers are always super friendly and have yet to mess up my usually complicated order. Cons: If they're busy, plan on waiting a very long time. Had my husbands surprise birthday party here. They were totally great and accommodated 30 of us w/o blinking, I made the reservation in advance and changed the # of people like 5 times and they were totally great about it."
John B.,"Round Rock, TX",0,40,,1.0,3/11/2016,"The food, breath of the menu and the beer selection is excellent.  However, the management for this restaurant is terrible.  The last few visits the place has been filthy.  Tonight when we sat at our table I found chips, French fries and a dirty napkin under the table.  I pushed all of it out in the aisle with my foot so the servers had to walk through it.  After 10 minutes one of the servers pushed the napkin out of the way.  I pushed the napkin back into the aisle again.  Ten minutes later a server finally picked it up.  I can't count the number of servers who just walked around the mess.  The chips and fries remained where you had to step through them.  I am assuming they got picked up after the restaurant closed.  For a restaurant as expensive as this you would think they could clean up a little bit.  I can only think that the manager doesn't care or is not taking the time to walk through the restaurant.   I have sent e mails and complained on line about the crap all over the floor on a couple earlier visits and  I never got a response.  This leads me to think the problem is above the manager level."
JC C.,"Round Rock, TX",44,14,9,4.0,9/13/2014,"Came in tonight for dinner and got the parmesan crusted chicken.  Husband got the California veggie burger.  Someone other than our waiter brought our plates but mine was missing the broccoli.  I mentioned it when the guy put down my plate and the guy said he would bring it on the side.  Then our server came by and said it might not be mine because it was missing the side so she took my plate back to the kitchen.  I was a bit confused because the plate was already sitting in front of me.  She then brought the same plate back a minute later and told me the side is on it's way.  Honestly, I didn't know why she would take away my plate and then bring it back.  Regardless, food was good as expected of a chain.  Haven't really had anything that I didn't like here.  Service not the best but food makes up for it."
Thi T.,"Round Rock, TX",0,6,7,1.0,12/8/2012,"My entire family visited this restaurant the 2nd time and it was a horrible experience. I would think they definitely need a new management team.  FOOD: Food comes out at a decent time, no problem here.  The pizzas and hamburgers are good.  However,  we tried the Classic Rib eyes this time and we couldn't even cut them with the knives.  It's so hard to chew and I almost choked trying to swallow the meat.  Do yourself a favor, do not order any steak here. SERVICE: Horrible!   When the food came out, we asked the waitress for A1 and Tabasco sauce, then we waited and waited...  We can see she took orders from two other tables and not even looked back at us once.  Our drinks were empty and there was nobody offered to refill.  After waiting for 15 mins, we asked another employee walking by for the manager.  When the manager came, I told him the situation, showing him our food was cold waiting for the sauce.  All he could say was ""sorry"", not even offering to warm or replacing our food.  He did bring us the sauce himself and re-filled our drinks.  When we almost finished our meals, the waitress came back and apologized, and that was about it.  She didn't even come to our table again to refill our drinks or remove our plates.  I had to wave at her to get the check so we could get out. BOTTOM LINE: Ironically, the management team doesn't seem know how to  run a restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, try another BJ's, not the one in Round Rock, TX."
Claudia M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/29/2016,Food was HORRID! Made me sick after I ate it. I wanted to get up and leave but the hubby said no. Service sucked!!! Never again.
Christina D.,"Houston, TX",3,34,1,5.0,2/27/2013,"For an Americana chain, I've always had good experiences at BJ's, from McAllen, to Houston, to Round Rock.  This review is for the Round Rock location because it's been years since I went to the other ones. Food - I had the Ahi Tuna Salad. I like my tuna to be seared for one instant on both sides, almost sashimi like, otherwise it tastes like canned tuna to me.  I asked the waitress to ask the cooks to do a quick sear, and she even came back to me after placing the order and said ""The kitchen said they can only cook it as they are allowed"" (meaning it can't be completely rare) and I said ""Ok"", expecting half a centimeter to be cooked but when it came out, only a millimeter was seared - PERFECTO. The lettuce was perfectly dressed, there was no excess dressing left on my plate. It was nearly a whole bag's worth of spring greens and NO iceberg or cabbage filler.  I drank a Red Apple (Irish ale + apple cider) with it which perfectly complimented the lightness and fruitiness of the salad.   Waitress was excellent, she was young, only 19, but very mature, attentive, and friendly."
Catrina C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",77,29,28,2.0,5/11/2013,"Food is pretty good. Average American restaurant with huge portions.  However, I feel like they've gotten too big for their britches and don't really know what to do with their growth. They seem short-staffed, even on busy Saturday. I waited for my food for thirty minutes, only to be told it been ran to a different table on accident and they were making my food again. Pretty inefficient.  Food is decent, though. Just work on the staff."
Brittany D.,"Georgetown, TX",3,13,,4.0,1/5/2014,"Well-priced drinks with a wide selection of beers, and  food is always nicely presented and prepared. My boyfriend and i usually split a salad and an entree, last time we got the California burger, which was filling enough for both of us. It's a great atmosphere for a casual date night, especially if you'll be offering drinks:)"
Joe Y.,"Manteca, CA",2,54,,2.0,12/12/2012,"My wife and I met here for dinner after work. We've ordered take out from this BJ's before and weren't impressed for the price, but decided to try the dining in experience....We should have gone to another restaurant.  We both opted for a steak entree. I ordered a medium rib-eye and my wife had a well done sirloin.  Her's wasn't exactly well done but close enough...mine was charred. We both opted for the mushroom sauce. She got her's and I didn't. They corrected the steak mistake after waiting for a long time to do so. The manager and waitress did apologize, but I could tell the staff attention was on the large groups of customers and they seemed overworked. They did take my rib-eye off the check, which was a situation-saving move. The beer is OK...and the food is over priced. The menu is so varied that I do see other things I would like to try, however this restaurant is not a priority."
Courtney L.,"Round Rock, TX",3,34,3,1.0,9/12/2015,"Well, no more BJ's for us. The kitchen cannot handle any type of food allergy. Most recently we ordered a pizza with no sauce. We told our waiter I was allergic to tomato. He came back and said it would not be a problem, and that he had checked with the kitchen and the pizza would not have tomato on it. We get the pizza, and I see a pink tint to the crust (it is dark inside, so I could not see clearly). I ask the waiter to check with the kitchen one more time, and he comes back and assures me there is not tomato. There was definitely tomato on the crust. After I took a bite he came back and told me that there was infact tomato on the pizza. The manager came over to check on us after and comped everything. The mix up was in no way the manager's or waiter's fault, but the kitchen just cannot be trusted. They need to train their kitchen staff to safely handle food allergies."
Susan W.,"Leander, TX",30,233,465,4.0,7/29/2013,"""Standard BJ's fare. Sandwiches, salads, pasta and burgers. Hand crafted root beer was good. Found a small piece of foil in one of the pasta dishes. Manager immediately offered to replace dish. Good service."""
Shy T.,"Austin, TX",0,169,1,1.0,12/28/2015,BJ's was absolutely horrible tonight. Nothing came out of the kitchen like it should have. I hadn't been in a while and now never going back. Food was horrible. Service has really gone down!!
Terry W.,"Wylie, TX",0,28,,3.0,10/25/2012,"I give BJ's 3 stars for the food, it is really good.  We usually split the small pizza and have a few salads and it is always top notch.  The micro beer is awesome, all of it.   The only down side to this place can be the service.  I honestly think they are doing the best they can with the crowds they are dealing with, but out of the 4 times we have been there, all 4 had some level of a service issue. Normally I wouldn't care, it is always something minor like appetizers, salads and dinner all come out too close together time wise or they serve the wrong beer.  However when you are paying $5 dollars a beer (way too high) and the food menu prices it all needs to click.  To their credit they have made right on every service mess up and that keeps me coming back."
Adde B.,"Austin, TX",0,15,1,2.0,1/31/2015,"My husband says I'm being generous giving BJs 2 stars after tonight. But one star is for the most delicious coffee I've had in a restaurant. Seriously. So good. Another star is for the Pazookie. It's a giant hot gooey cookie topped with legit vanilla bean ice cream. Yummm!  The problems lie in the service. We didn't have silverware until after we got our meals. Luckily the appetizer was a finger food. The real bummer was I couldn't drink my delicious coffee because I didn't have a spoon to stir it with. I can't do black coffee yet, I'm working on it. When our server wandered back over and we asked for silverware and more water, there was no apology and no urgency to meet the request. It was another couple minutes before we finally were given the allusive silverware.  If you have a ton of time on your hands, a great sense of humor and utensils for fingers- I recommend this place for your next dessert craving evening."
Danny O.,"Pflugerville, TX",10,159,2,1.0,9/29/2014,"Really don't like this location, I love the one at the Arbor Walk shopping center. But this one is a nightmare. Our waitress was a smart ass, I asked her if they still had their signature root beer she said in an annoyed tone ""Uhhhh, last time I checked"" and then rolled her eyes. We never got our appetizer until after we were done with our main courses and we sent it back because we were already full. My burger was heavily overcooked and it tasted like charcoal, I will not return to this location. BUT, I will return to the Arbor Walk location."
