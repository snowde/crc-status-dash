Will C.,"Austin, TX",10,2,1,1.0,12/20/2015,"It is with regret that I give BJ's one lonely star. Our waitress was a wonderful, pleasant woman who did her very best to navigate us through a menu so extensive and uninspiring that, just as with most books assigned to me during high school, I didn't quite make it to the end. The beers (brewed in house) were ""craft"" only on the sense that they reminded of my early forays into finger painting. We decided on a spinach & artichoke dip in which the only decreeable flavor was a hint of E. coli. My pizza (using term loosely here) was similar to previous experiences with the dish only in that it was round. A sad clump of cheese near the middle did little to disguise the Hawaiian King Roll it was placed on. As an added bonus, the management saw fit to add chicken to my veggie pizza. Frankly, I was more confused than upset. I kept looking around at the people around me expecting to see faces twisted with horror and disguise. But I didn't. I saw happy people plowing into sub par meals without a hint of regret. I saw complacency. I saw defeat. I saw more than I wanted to tonight at BJ's. More than anyone should ever have to see."
Ken P.,"Allandale, Austin, TX",1,4,,4.0,2/11/2016,"Love the unlimited soup and salad on the week days. Wait staff, is good but could be faster during lunch."
James C.,"Hutto, TX",117,97,14,3.0,7/23/2013,"I really enjoy the food at BJ's and once you get a table, the service is great. The reason for 3 stars, is the wait times are horrible.  If you go during normal lunch or dinner hours,  you will wait (over 30 min for typical dinners) My wife and I go here often , but at odd hours,  not typical dining hours. Food is incredible.  Pizza is top notch, and their brews are tasty."
Anastasia C.,"Round Rock, TX",23,53,4,3.0,11/14/2014,"We love the food however after the last 3 visits encountering extremely rude hostesses, we will be picking a different location.  Unfortunate but seems to be a trend that management hasn't fixed yet."
James F.,"Rockwall, TX",7,42,6,2.0,8/5/2012,"Probably would have gone three stars, but found hair on the food - (see pictures).  I called and spoke with a manager who offered to replace the item if I would come back in the next day or two, however when I said it would be about a week before I could return, he said he'll need to take my address down and send something out.  Needless to say, nothing ever arrived and we have not gone back."
Erin W.,"Beaumont, TX",17,91,334,4.0,4/14/2013,"Enjoyed our experience here! Good, dark ambience, even during the daytime.  Their menu is so extensive, it almost  feels like flipping through a Cheesecake Factory menu. They've got pizzas, Cajun food, burgers, potatoes, and all kinds of chicken dishes, and appetizers. I was even able to add an order of ""Gourmet Bacon Mac & Cheese"" as a side to my order - it was delish! In fact, I probably could have just had that side as my lunch and I would have been fully satisfied and full.  The only downside was that it takes a long time. Our lunch was 2.5 hours (the wait was 15-20 minutes). Also the potato skins were a little over fried. I think they dip them into a batter and deep fry them like fries or chicken strips. It was a little much. I definitely want to go again and try other items! Our server was fantastic and very friendly."
Stacey T.,"Round Rock, TX",75,105,186,4.0,7/7/2012,"I'm not one to go to a new facility that has just opened.  In past experiences, I get nothing but bad service.  I'm giving 4 stars not because it was WONDERFUL service - it was GOOD service; however, the food and beer was excellent and the waiter & waitress that we had tried their very best to give us a great experience.  And really, that's all that matters when it comes to a restaurant - especially a new one.   So my friends and I (3 in all) went here on a Thursday night around 8:30.  It was jam packed, and of course, this was to be expected.  So we get our little buzzer thingie and then head over to the bar.  They had a TON of beer to choose from on tap and we were able to get samples before purchasing.  The bar tender (she) had a slight attitude with the 3 of us for some reason (maybe the samples?) but we got our beer finally and talked a few minutes before our buzzer went off.  All of what I just said happened was about 30 minutes total.  We get to our nice big booth and get waited on immediately.  Our waiter knew the menu pretty well; however, as far as how certain items tasted, he wasn't able to tell us.  He explained that the management didn't have the employees try all of the food - only SEE the food during training.  Hmmm, ok, well we ended up with the stuffed mushrooms, crusted chicken parmesan, some kind of soup bread bowl, and I got the southwestern spring rolls (which were da bomb!)  Yes, I just said that.  Throughout our meal, the service was a bit slow, but as I said before, they tried and that's all that mattered.   Overall the food was good.  The beer was good.  The atmosphere was a tad bit on the noisy side but it didn't hinder our conversation so hence the 4 stars.  I'll be coming back here soon, I'm sure."
Catalina M.,"Round Rock, TX",163,183,80,5.0,8/12/2012,"bjs brewhouse is an awesome addition to round rock! will deffinatley be headed back! i love all the handcrafted sodas, especially the cream soda. been here several times since opening, and i love it! keep up the good work bjs!"
Shelley C.,"Frisco, TX",2,20,,5.0,8/29/2012,"I've been to this restaurant several times in the past few weeks, and every time I am more and more happy with it. The food for starters, is amazing. I have tried something different each time, and each time am thoroughly pleased. The lighter menu offered has great selections on it, and the appetizers are all great. I highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps.  Although the menu can quickly add up, try going during their selected HH times. They also have both an early happy hour and a late night one, so there is always an opportunity to get a good deal.  The service is always great! I appreciate good service and knowledgeable servers, and I haven't had an experience here yet lacking in either area.   The atmosphere is fun and upbeat, and I like the ambiance of the entire restaurant. I highly suggest giving this place a shot!"
Greg J.,"Round Rock, TX",53,31,1,4.0,8/14/2012,"Beer. Beer, beer, beer. Beeeer. Did I say beer? If you want to go to a restaurant that has a menu that doubles as an epic novel, you have your choice between BJ's and Cheesecake Factory. If you want to add in an outstanding selecting of beer, BJ's takes the cake. You can surely read other reviews regarding BJ's, but frankly, who are these people? This is the only review that matters. If you want to dine at BJ's in the evening, prepare to wait. New restaurants in Round Rock are like the kid's house with the trampoline. No matter how popular/unpopular, everyone is going to show up to check it out. BJ's is worth it, though. Pro-tip: Call ahead. They don't take reservations, but if you want to skim 30 minutes off your wait time, call on the way. Pro-tip 2: They serve the full menu at the bar area. So if you want to skip the wait and you see an open table at the bar, take it and have at it. We skipped the wait a couple times. Pro-tip 3: This place is notorious for over-estimating their wait times. So you may be told 45 minutes, but then be seated in 10. If you're a beer guy (or gal), I recommend doing a custom flight. Since the brew their own, they'll bring you four 4oz pours of any of their 8 (or 9 if they have a seasonal) beers. It's great! For the girls who want something fruity, my wife enjoys their berry cider (yeah, it's got alcohol in it) or their peachy keen sangria something or other. It tasted like liquid jolly ranchers to me, but hey, whatever floats your boat. For the non-drinkers, the home made craft root beer or cream soda is enough to send you into a diabetic coma! Get here early, try the beer and drinks. You can't go wrong with the food choices."
Mark M.,"Round Rock, TX",74,6,,1.0,10/10/2012,"I took my family here for the first time tonight as we've been wanting to try it since it opened this summer, but it has always been packed when we've tried to go in the past.  It didn't seem as busy tonight so we decided to give it a try.   Even though our server was nice, the food quality here was very, very poor, and was also very expensive for what we got.  Small portions and not much value at all.   My wife ordered a $16 steak which was just plain nasty...very tough, riddled with fat and gristle with a big tendon running through the middle of the steak.  I ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos for $10.75, however the two tacos were so microscopic that I was wondering if this ""entree"" didn't really belong on the appetizer menu.  The only other things on the plate was 8 tortilla chips, a piece of lettuce and a couple lime quarters.  How disappointing! Needless to say, we both complained about our meals, talked to the manager and ended up trying the salads instead.  The manager himself admitted that my wife's steak was really poor quality.  When he offered to get her another steak, she asked if the new one would be any better, and he said that he couldn't guarantee it.  That alone should have been enough to send us running out the door, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.   I got the Santa Fe salad for $12.50, which was supposed to (per the manager) come with a whole chicken breast sliced over the top of the salad.  Well, all I got was 4 slices of chicken on top (not even half of a chicken breast), and two of the pieces had gristle and tendon on them, which totally grossed me out.  The salad part was mostly the thick, white rind part of the lettuce and there was actually very little greens or good lettuce in the salad.  The rest was filler, a whole bunch of fried, crunchy things for the topping.   My wife ordered the Cobb salad , which ended up costing $15.75 to our amazement!   It was also supposed to contain a whole chicken breast per the manager.  It did not contain anywhere near that much chicken, maybe a half a breast if that.  The rest was the thick, white part of the lettuce that most people just end up throwing away...just totally cheap nasty filler.   At this point we ended up sending the salads back and just getting a refund of our money.   Wait times to get our food were also unacceptable.  Unfortunately we will not be returning to this restaurant."
Niki N.,"Round Rock, TX",4,6,,1.0,11/1/2014,4th time in a row bad service even sat at the bar because we were wanting better service. Love the food but hate waiting 20min for the correct check amount.
Karin C.,"Magnolia, TX",5,10,,1.0,11/1/2015,"Looking for a late night dinner after a show, BJ's was the only option. Usually like BJ's but our last two dinners have been lacking. Our previous bad experience was at the Whitestone location so we thought we'd give this one a chance. Bad decision. My husband wanted a Black & Bleu burger and I ordered soup and salad. Server informed us that they didn't have bacon prepped for the burger. That affects 12 different entrees on the menu so he ordered fish and chips because he'd had it at another BJ's and enjoyed it. Received my salad (mozzarella and tomatoes with balsamic- tomatoes are rough but good flavor nonetheless) then my husband received his dinner - Lukewarm and overdone. My soup took forever- server explained that they had already ""put it up"". When they brought it out finally it was cold. Told them I wasn't interested since my husband had already finished. Manager apologized and that was it. I so want to like BJ's but I think it's location specific. Know we won't be back to Whitestone or this location."
Anthony B.,"Round Rock, TX",13,120,20,4.0,11/26/2012,"This place opened a couple months back and the family and I had some reservations about trying it. We tried to go on a weekend night and it was so crowded we did not even bother. We went back at about 4pm on a Monday and enjoyed a mostly empty restaurant. I was afraid it would not be kid friendly, but there were several tables with children. Our waitress was polite, professional, and attentive. the rest of the staff seemed good as well. The entire building was spotlessly clean, and the interior must have cost a fortune with granite table tops everywhere.  The food ranged from ""not bad"" to ""really good."" The calamari was a little overcooked and had obviously been cooked in oil that needed to be changed. My wife had a seared ahi salad that was enormous. Both our kids had chicken fingers which were cooked properly and very tender.  I had the ""jambalaya"" which should have just been called ""New Orleans Style Shrimp and Chicken,"" or maybe even ""Blackened Meat and Veggies over Rice Pilaf.""  Real jambalaya has the rice cooked with the meat, but at least they were accurate in their description of the dish on the menu. I am not complaining BTW, the portion was huge and it was really good. I ate every bite and wanted more. The meats were cooked properly, the shrimp was nice and tender, and the rice balanced out the spiciness. It was hot enough to make my reading time on the toilet interesting tomorrow, but not spicy enough to keep from eating it.  My only major complaint is that the prices are a little higher than most similar places in the area. You will certainly pay more here than you will at Chili's, Le Madelaine, or TGI Fridays. We ended up spending 70 bucks after tip and tax. Don't get me wrong, everything was good and I left happy, its just that the price will probably keep me from being a regular."
Andrew G.,"Leander, TX",7,19,2,4.0,9/17/2014,"One of our favorite restaurants, I just wish it wasn't so expensive.  Sometimes we get crappy service and we have to wait awhile for our food."
mab t.,"Georgetown, TX",0,3,1,2.0,7/30/2012,"Took a friend for dinner tonight after having enjoyed a nice lunch there a few days ago.  I had the ribeye and it was not good.  Lots of gristle.  The ranch dressing on my salad was weird tasting. My husband had the blonde shrimp and it tasted like it was more batter than shrimp.  We both liked the Pirhana ale, however.    We went there for lunch a few days ago and had the all you can eat soup and salad and we both had the tomatoe bisque soup.   That was delicious.  The watermelon salad was pretty good., too.  The service is ok.  Will not go back again except maybe for the soup at lunch. And the ale."
Wennie A.,"Plano, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/3/2015,"If there was a negative star I would put that. Horrible service! The waiter didn't know the menu at all, didn't try to pay attention when order was placed. Brought out the wrong food, wrong drink, slow as slow can be. Didn't bring silverware, or get refills. We had a hungry crying toddler but had to wait an hour for the wrong food and there was hardly anyone at the restaurant. The manager saw the situation and didn't try to remedy it at all and made it seem like it was our fault for ordering the wrong food. WORST experience ever. Do NOT come to this location!"
B G.,"Round Rock, TX",15,13,,4.0,1/4/2016,Service is ALWAYS consistent. Always quick.  Food is very consistent....never had anything I didn't like.  The selection of beers on tap is great!  Good atmosphere for family or date night.
Jose A.,"Round Rock, TX",45,127,376,4.0,7/14/2012,"Had family dinner here on a Friday night. There was a wait but we decided to take an open table in the bar area. Our waitress was friendly and made our dinning experience wonderful.  I went with the Brewhouse Blonde Fish 'N Chips and a few Brewhouse Blonde beer to go with it. The batter was crispy and delicious, my chips were thick cut seasoned potatoes and my beer was delicious. My wife had a Mahi mahi and shrimp dish that she thoroughly enjoyed. Daughter 1 had a Flatbread pizza an daughter 2 had a deep dish pasta that they both really liked. We also had an appetizer of calamari which could of been more crispy but tasted good. Overall our visit was very good. The wife and I will have to come back and try more of their wide selections of beer on tap."
Alan N.,"Georgetown, TX",19,45,33,5.0,8/18/2012,"As chains go, BJ's is among the best. Extensive menu of pretty-good food, full bar with a wide range of private-label beers (for Texas locations, it's contract-brewed by St. Arnold's in Houston), and the capacity to serve enormous numbers of people, in a space well-designed to mitigate the noise that usually accompanies huge crowds. It's a long way from ""quiet,"" but you and your dining companion can hear each other across the table without shouting. It appears from other reviews that this location had plenty of the usual new-restaurant issues to work through, but now that they've been open a couple months, everything is mostly running like clockwork. The wait gets quite long at times, but once you get to the front of the line, service is fast and friendly. The food is on par with other BJ's locations: Better than most chains, but you do need to employ common sense in ordering (don't expect any seafood to have been caught the same day you eat it, or that pasta will be cooked perfectly al dente). As long as you have realistic expectations, BJ's will rarely disappoint. Edit: After a few more visits to this location, I'm upping it to five stars. The kitchen and service at this location are now a little better than other BJ's restaurants I've visited. The management here is definitely doing things right. If the menu and the dining room weren't each so massive, I might even forget it's a chain...momentarily."
