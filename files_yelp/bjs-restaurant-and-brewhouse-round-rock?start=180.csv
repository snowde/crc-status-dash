D J.,"Round Rock, TX",0,21,,3.0,10/31/2015,There is nothing great about this place but at the same time there is nothing wrong with this place. If you want Basic food that won't disappoint or excite this is the place. Pizookie dessert is really good.
Amanda M.,"Round Rock, TX",20,18,7,4.0,8/19/2013,"I like them.  I haven't been there in a couple of months but we went regularly before that.  We have had everything from their pizza to their steak and in between.  We have had a couple of not so great experiences and we let the manager know.  He was always helpful and friendly, interested in making sure his customers were happy. Our two favorites here: the red velvet pazookie (holy moly!!) and the hand crafted sodas--my favorite is the cream soda.  Oh man, so good!!!"
John B.,"Round Rock, TX",86,260,89,4.0,6/27/2012,"The family went by the new BJ's in Round Rock, and we had a good time. If you have ever been to BJ's, well, this one is just like the others.  Clean, nicely decorated, TV's everywhere and cool rock-n-roll music playing.  The menu is HUGE, and takes a while to read.  You can get pasta, chicken, steak, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, fish, pork... pretty much anything your party of picky eaters could want can be accommodated at a BJ's. They didn't seem to be suffering any of the opening week hang ups that most new restaurant locations have.  The staff was well trained, and there appeared to be a 1-1 ratio of trainer to trainee.  I'm looking forward to the 'new' being rubbed off this place, and for the hustle and bustle to die down a little bit.  We were seated by the station where most of the waitstaff hangs out, and we felt a little weird having so many people rushing around us all the time. I had the calzone w/ mushroom, pepperoni, and Italian sausage.  The ricotta cheese was very nice and balanced the spicy/salty meats.  I wish I had added a side salad, but after the calzone and splitting a pizooki trio with my family I was full without being stuffed. I'll definitely be back."
Jennifer F.,"Cedar Park, TX",11,25,3,2.0,8/15/2015,"Food here is pretty decent (better than a lot of chains), but the service is lacking. Without fail the hosts do a crappy job of estimating your wait time, and this particular occasion was especially bad. Firstly, what is the point of call ahead seating if your wait time doesn't start until you get there? I can put my name down and wait once I arrive just the same. Secondly, don't hand out pagers that don't work/have dead batteries! If you say 15-20 minutes, and then after 30 minutes we ask about our table and you tell us you've already paged 4xs but ""oops the pager isn't working"", you damn well better seat us at the next available table! Not seat 3 other groups (of the same table size) before us, who were obviously on the list after us! Absolutely not acceptable!"
Brian P.,"Round Rock, TX",0,12,,1.0,1/13/2016,"Placed an order for takeout. Their takeout area has a door leading into the kitchen with a small round window on it. As I'm waiting for someone to help me I was looking through the window watching the plates being made. No kidding here, there was a larger guy all tattooed up picking food off the plates with his hands and shoveling it into his mouth. He'd use the same hand and hit another plate for a different side sample. Four different times he gathered food off a plate and ate it with his hands. Sorry, that's disgusting and for that reason alone BJ's won't get my business."
Neal M.,"Austin, TX",432,794,107,2.0,2/17/2015,"Meh.  I came here once with a friend for HH and it was an OK experience.  Nothing to write home about.  I ate here again about a month ago with my family.  It took our server close to 20 minutes just to greet us and get our order.  By time he came, we ordered EVERYTHING.  Then it took about 20 minutes just to get waters.  I'll also point out that the place was crazy busy but that's not really my/other patrons 'problem'.  We shared some items such as potstickers, chips and salsa and caprese.  I had a parmesan chicken I believe.  It was OK, nothing spectacular but OK.  One of the kids had fish and chips and well, the fish was coated with something spicy and their menu didn't say anything about it having heat.  The kid couldn't eat it and got an upset stomach.  The other child got a steak and guess what?  It was full of silver skin.  She sent it back and the replacement seemingly got mixed in the shuffle.  All in all, we were there nearly TWO HOURS.  Later that night, the kid with the steak got sick.  Overall, never going to BJ's again.  Terrible service and mediocre food."
Taintpretty M.,"Round Rock, TX",3,50,6,4.0,7/6/2012,"For being their opening week we had a very good time here. The menu is a bit over the top with the number of items. I wish they had a specialty they did very well instead trying to cover all the bases. We had a couple of appetizers of the white pizza and fried artichokes. Both were very good and discounted for happy hour.  I did order a flight of beers and this was better than expected. One plus of this being a chain is that they had skilled brewers running things and it wasn't as scary as ordering beer from Flix (which still has not gotten down their brewing). The Tatonka was creamy good! At BJs they put a guide down on your table and then sit the beer in a designated spot so you will know what beer you are drinking. The new waitress got every one wrong. Luckily one of the trainers saw it and she straightened it all out and added two more. No complaints there when they catch a mistake and correct it with more beer! Even though the parking lot was completely full there was only a 15 minute wait. We ended up passing on the table and stayed at a small bar table. Had a great time talking to others at the bar.  We did notice the Westside Alehouse when we left and they had maybe 15 cars in the lot. Night and day on these two places. One with awful lighting, crappy food, clueless waitresses, and awful ambiance and then the other that has their act together in the first week. We tried Westside but you failed us."
Shannon A.,"Liberty Hill, TX",6,43,58,4.0,8/14/2014,"Excellent food, good service for a busy theme style restaurant.   Try the piranha pale ale, good flavor but save room for dessert and get the peach cobbler.   One of the best I've every had."
Jackie M.,"Round Rock, TX",2,22,,1.0,12/29/2013,"My husband arrived at BJ's and asked for a table.  The hostess was very kind and predicted a 15-20 minute wait.  We waited and into 20 minutes of waiting another couple, that arrived right after us was seated. I went up to another young lady, and informed her that another couple that arrived right after us was seated before us.  She immediately brushed me off, said that they probably had called ahead, which was clearly NOT the case, and then walked off. A few minutes after, we were seated.   I ordered the calamari and a house salad.  My husband ordered the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad. The calamari came out first.  It was extremely greasy.  The sauces were not good.  A plain cocktail sauce would have been better.  Then, the salads.  The salads were terrible.  My house salad contained mostly iceberg lettuce, it had two slices of tomatoes and one slice of cucumber that was cut in half.  On top of it all, it was drenched in balsamic vinaigrette.  The Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad that is pictured on the online menu is a fairy tale.  The salad that was served had five overly fried slivers of chicken that was more breading than chicken.  It was topped on a mountain of chopped iceberg lettuce.  As far of the corn, cucumber, hard boiled egg, almonds, and tomatoes they were sparse.  They were so sparse that we weren't sure they were in the salad at all. Our waitress was very kind and did her job well. On the receipt we wrote a simple message that summed it up: You were great, but that was a pair of very sad salads :("
deborah s.,"Leander, TX",17,28,,2.0,8/4/2014,"Was very disappointed tonight. The chicken fried streak was extremely tough, the service was very slow,and management was nowhere to be found. We will just wait for the Cedar Park store to open and try again."
Luis A.,"Monterrey, Mexico",0,10,1,4.0,2/23/2014,"I really like it. Staff is friendly and food is great, my only suggestion is PLEASE give the hostess a chill pill, she treats the servers terrible and shouts to them in front of the customers even when the place is not crowed. Other than that I'd say is a great place to have a sunday lunch. If you're getting a beer, get the piranha."
Jessica M.,"Austin, TX",0,12,5,3.0,2/13/2014,Food is always great. Which is a plus. But service? Ehh very mediocre. Hostesses are always rude but never had a rude server. Slow service?  Very much so and they seem to jump to the check pretty fast before asking about dessert which we always love to enjoy a red velvet pizookie. Take out is good but food has come out cold before even after waiting for it. All in all solid 3 stars and will return sometime.
Daniel C.,"Pflugerville, TX",16,108,13,4.0,10/18/2012,"I came here for lunch with a fairly large group. I ordered the jambalaya and it was delicious, but maybe a little too spicy.  So be aware of that if you do not like a lot of heat. The service was good even though we had a party of sixteen.  Only a couple of errs, but they were all taken care of very quickly."
Shelly N.,"Round Rock, TX",8,26,1,3.0,6/27/2014,"This was, at one point, our ""go to"" place for dinner. Unfortunately this is no longer the case. Inconsistent food quality. One day the meal is absolutely wonderful then the next time you order the same thing it's not worth eating. Not uncommon to receive your meal missing some of the components specifically the salads. Several times the food has been terribly salty. Service, while the staff is always friendly, the service is VERY slow. VERY... VERY... VERY SLOW. Not just waiting for the food but waiting to be greated once seated, frequently waiting for drink refills, takes forever to get our check (thankful for the ability to view and pay your bill at the table through the app)."
Summer D.,"Leander, TX",23,187,277,4.0,8/17/2012,Large varity of food.  Great happy hour and lunch speicals! Love the flat bread pizzas. If you like the Cheesecake factory you will Like Bj's!
Kiki L.,"Waverly, NY",1,18,1,1.0,9/14/2013,"Unless your kids can be seen and not heard, don't even think about coming here.  The website seems to indicate that this is a family friendly place, but our toddler decided to throw a fit as we ordered drinks. He wasn't happy and was crying loudly (is there any other kind?).  I tried entertaining him with the crayons and my phone, but we knew we'd just have to wait it out. He's 2 and he wanted to run around the restaurant instead of sitting still. I can honestly say that the tantrum was worse for US than anyone else in the restaurant and we figured he would calm down once the food arrived.  Just before our waitress took our food order, what I assume was the manager moved her aside and told us that ""this has been disturbing"" and that ""other guests have complained"". Having never been asked to leave a CASUAL, LOUD (from multiple TVs, etc) restaurant before, we were pretty surprised and annoyed. My husband immediately told him we would leave and the manager seemed to back off and offer ice cream or something to keep our kid quiet. Since we don't usually give our kids sugar to shut them up, we weren't interested. Plus, the tone with which he acted about the 'problem' was rude. The problem here was the poor customer service and the lack of sympathy for parents of a screaming toddler.  If we had been yelling at him or otherwise scolding him and creating a scene, I can understand why other patrons would be upset, but we were simply offering him positive choices to stop his behavior and remaining calm in the face of a tantrum.  This was our first and last experience at BJs."
Darrell G.,"Round Rock, TX",0,8,1,1.0,9/20/2014,"Sad!  Used to love eating here. I don't know if mgmnt changed hands or what happened.        Went in today for a late lunch with the wife. They weren't overly busy at about 2:30 pm. Ordered blackened fish tacos. They came out of the kitchen refrigerated. This is the second time we've been there and got COLD food. A couple of months ago, my wife's meal came with caramelized onions, yup...ice cold.       I asked the manager then if they received frozen food and heated it up. He denied it and suggested that they must have had some left over from preparing another order and put them in the fridge, forgot to heat them up before sending my wife's plate out.       I told the manager today, there is no excuse for me to order fish tacos and have them come from the kitchen ice cold. He agreed apologized and comped our meal...But as I explained they obviously have no one doing any quality control checks before food leaves the kitchen.  The service is great, the manager was professional and handled it correctly, but...      This food us OBVIOUSLY not cooked in house in less the chef only uses a microwave. We won't be back...and we ate here enough to earn hundreds of  points for having spent thousands of dollars here over the time since they opened."
Chris L.,"Round Rock, TX",9,86,,4.0,11/27/2012,"BJ's offers free lunch to we vets on our special day, so I went for a second visit. My initial assessment of the food and beer held up. Both are outstanding in quality, and the selection is really remarkable. The service at the bar was great, though tenders in general should really find a new schtick beyond the ""I care about you, but only a little, because I'm really cool"" routine. My shrimp tacos were jumping with flavor, my IPA went down nice and smooth, and the Pats game was on the big screen. All in all a fantastic Veterans' Day.  My only two gripes about BJ's are minor, and somewhat unfair. It is persistently busy, and deservedly so, but relaxation is difficult. The price point is also outside my comfort zone, but the market justifies it. There's not a whole lot of spread price-wise between this place and, say, Applebee's. The difference in product on the other hand ... not even close."
Staci P.,"Pflugerville, TX",61,32,3,2.0,9/5/2012,"I have been to the Arbor Walk location three times, and each time there has been an issue.  The issues seem to be service related; our order was wrong or cold, could not get drinks or refills in a timely manner, etc... My experience this past Sunday 9/2 was so mediocre that I felt compelled to write about it.  The Hostess were over eager but after about a five minute wait we were seated.  Our waiter...well he was just plain awkward.  He did not seem confidant in anything he said or did, and seemed to second guess everything we ordered (maybe it was just an awkward way of parroting back the order to make sure it was correct). The brews are pretty ok and i needed one in order to begin ""reading""  the menu that is large enough to be mistaken for a menu from the cheesecake factory... I settled on the Pot Roast Sandwich.  Very Lack-luster.  I got the impression visually that my entree had been sitting on the pass for a bit.  There were large pieces of celery on the dish that were stringy and hard to eat, and carrots that were not quite cooked.  The pot roast was dry and the gravy was thick and cold. The mash was good but not good enough to save the dish.  All in all I am consistently disappointed and probably will not visit again unless a large group has plans or maybe a happy hour or something. P.S. Parking around this location is terrible, getting in and out of the center at arbor walk is a dreadful pain in the arse!!!"
Lucy B.,"Georgetown, TX",3,71,,3.0,5/9/2014,"I will start with how much I love the hand-crafted sodas. I only tried the cream soda, and absolutely loved it. Once our party arrived we grabbed a table and ordered a variety of things. Not very satisfied with the calamari.Most of it, I'd say about 90% of it was all tentacles, which I am not a fan of. Luckily the hubby likes that part of the squid so not all was lost. Ordered the pepperoni flat-bread pizza. It was ""ok"" Would have liked it to be a bit more crispy and more sauce. Hubby loved the variety of drafty beers. Would like to give them another shot... but may order the regular pizza next time. Service was very friendly."
