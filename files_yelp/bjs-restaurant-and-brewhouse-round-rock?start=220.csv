Marc P.,"Georgetown, TX",1,8,,4.0,8/23/2012,"I read the reviews for the Austin restaurant and was not impressed. My family ate in Round Rock last week and we enjoyed the drinks and food. Going back Thursday. Ok, back again on Thursday. Had Mahi Mahi grilled tacos and craft beer. All four us enjoyed."
Jessica A.,"Round Rock, TX",340,5,,5.0,4/30/2014,I went there a month or so ago and absolutely loved it! The waitress was great and had lots of good advice and knew what was good on the menu. The pizza is to DIE for!! I will be back
Jason B.,"Round Rock, TX",29,16,5,4.0,1/16/2013,Been here 3 times and they seem to be rolling with the punches.  Cold food and a hour wait on food the first time. No service at all the second.  But wait everything has changed. We got great service the third time.  Maybe the kinks are getting worked out. Maybe its just because its tuesday night after 930pm.  Anyway hope they keep it up.
Brandy F.,"Taylor, TX",0,2,,3.0,3/30/2015,I go here just for the pot stickers and pazookies. Service could be better but food is always good.
Matt G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,9,,5.0,3/30/2014,"This is my favorite place to take a group. They have something for everyone. Full bar, micro brews, mainstream beers, wine......pizza, pasta, salads, fish- it's all good. Gluten free and veggie options as well. Something for everyone."
MATT G.,"Houston, TX",0,9,7,3.0,10/11/2014,"Food was ok, deep dish pizza was a bit shallower than advertised. Wife got the french dip......which she loved. Main problem was the seating that allowed the sun to blind you while eating! Get better drapes BJ"
Manoj I.,"Leander, TX",4,238,19,3.0,7/22/2013,"I really liked the one down south and I was really excited to see one open up in Round Rock. This is my second visit to this restaurant since they opened and I must say it has improved a little bit. We ordered appetizers, a caesar salad and a beer, they brought the wrong salad out first, we were super hungry so we took the salad, but we did not have any silverware, had to get one from an empty table near by. The avocado rolls were mushy and seemed like it was taken out of the freezer and microwaved. Out of the three things we ordered we struck out on two. The beer was good, but the food needs to catch up in quality with other BJs I have been to. The restaurant was pretty packed for a weekday and the bar area was super busy, so looks like they are doing good business. I hope they do something to improve their quality."
M K.,"Austin, TX",0,118,2,1.0,4/26/2013,"We visited BJ's tonight for the first time.   The place looks very nice and attractive.   The beer selection is huge if you enjoy different types of beers and micro brewery beer.   We were seated after a 30 minute wait on a friday night which was pretty good.   The menu is very diverse but unfortunately the service is a little slow and there were several servers who visited our table and it seems they never communicated with each other.   Our appetizer was a very simple chips & salsa which took forever to arrive.   The main courses were for the most part tasty (3 out of 4 were good, one was  just so so). The most disgusting part of the evening however was when the server brought us 4 small dishes in order to share appetizers.    After eating our appetizer, my son picked up his plate and found raw meat smashed up against the bottom of his plate.    Not only disgusting but completely unsanitary...how on earth does raw meat find its way to getting stuck on the bottom of dishes that are taken out and placed on a table?    We are not talking about a few small specs of ground beef, it was 3 or 4 pieces of raw beef each the size of about a quarter and perhaps twice as thick.   I wrapped it up and gave it to our waitress and told her about it, she was surprised and said she would alert the manager and the manager would come right to our table.   No manager ever arrived...I wonder if she really did anything or go back to find out what the kitchen staff was doing. The other disappointing experience was when my daughter finished her main course.   She picked up her plate to set it aside and felt something rough on the bottom of her plate, I looked under and it was dried on food on the bottom of her plate.   I rubbed my hand across it and the entire bottom of her plate was greasy or oily....it appears they served my daughter her meal on a dirty plate that was not washed. My conclusion about this place is they spent a lot of money on the building, have a few nice menu items, and completely fail when it comes to sanitation, customer service, and management.   We definitely will not be back...our health is more important then the few tasty meals we had."
Carly S.,"Gastonia, NC",35,36,8,1.0,7/20/2012,"Ugg, 2 burgers, 1 fried chicken salad, one baked potato and small salad, boneless wings and a kids meal $75 before tip, sodas but no alcohol. Took 30 minutes to get our meal and waitress forgot my mom's request for a differnet salad dressing. Finally went up to the hostess stand and asked for a manager and told him how long we had been waiting for our food and that we couldn't find our waitress. He went over to our table where our food was finally getting delivered and asked us what we needed, brought my request for cheese for my salad and left. Never came back and he didn't take care of anything on the bill, not even my mom's small side salad that took at least 15 minute to get the dressing, nor did he offer dessert on them. Nothing, nothing to try to gain back our confidence.  As for the food, my main complaint is that everything fried had to be frozen and oh my, the prices. $7.95 for a ""giant"" baked potato wIth butter and sour cream. Giant guys mean large baked potato. Oh, you want cheese or bacon? That will be an extra $2 something.  Save yourself from feeling ripped off like we did and go somewhere else, anywhere else! (ate there around 3pm for lunch today)"
Tiffany H.,"Round Rock, TX",0,10,5,1.0,8/2/2012,"Bad service, and management was terrible!  The store management did not seem to care about resolving the situation.   Another bad restaurant in Round Rock!"
B T.,"Round Rock, TX",1,45,13,1.0,8/6/2012,Bad service. Food was not as ordered.  slow to try to resolve - but never resolved.  mgmt did not seem to care.  another BAD restaurant in RR
April K.,"Round Rock, TX",5,2,2,1.0,2/23/2013,We went here on a Wednesday night and it was pretty dead. We were seated right away to only sit there and wait for a server to never come to our table. The people next to us we're being helped and we just kept getting walked by. Needless to say we left since we were never helped. We will not be returning to this location!!!
Matthew M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,2.0,6/21/2014,"Staff is extremely rude and not accommodating for customers. Plenty of open tables yet she said 25 min wait. Went to order to go and a nice gentleman said the bar booths are open no wait. Our waitress also extremely rude, slamming our drinks down and slow service."
tom m.,"Austin, TX",71,88,,1.0,2/12/2013,"How could someone give this 4 stars? I have had better service at Whataburger. Come to think of it I had better food at Whataburger.....for about half the price.  Service horrible, food mediocre, prices very inflated....$11 for a burger...REALLY? $14 for an individual pizza?  From the time we walked in and were seated until we actaully had food (which he got the order wrong) it was 45 minutes. This stuff is all prefabbed and frozen how hard is it to heat it up? The only reason I went was it was a friends bday and that is where he wanted to go.  Now I am venting what I should have said to him. NEVER AGAIN in this place."
Christopher G.,"Austin, TX",69,75,,1.0,8/6/2012,"UGGGGGh . I liked the one in Arbor Walk. But this one is run by a very rude manager. Argued with me about a $14 bar tab that I paid, but he said it was transferred to my table . BS, I signed and closed out at the bar while I was waiting for my table. The point is, I have never had a manager at a chain restaurant ARGUE with me. Oh well, I wont be back and promise to tell everyone I know not to eat here."
Joe V.,"Austin, TX",12,63,7,4.0,12/7/2012,"I thought BJ's was very good. It was only my second visit and the last time was at the grand opening for the location at the Arbor Walk (and I wont get into that one). Our server was very nice but I felt like she was a bit ""stretched."" She a very large section but I will admit it was pretty busy for a monday. But I was won over and I will be back."
Jen K.,"Round Rock, TX",23,102,11,2.0,11/4/2012,"Mixed reviews and now I see why. Our wait for a table was only a few minutes, but the service during our meal was so s-l-o-w... Not to mention that it was very expensive, and portions were small. Food was ""okay."""
Joann R.,"Round Rock, TX",45,21,1,1.0,6/29/2013,"Wish I had checked YELP BEFORE going to eat here.  First off, bad service - the couple that came in after us was served their drinks and ordered their dinner before we even saw a waiter.  That should have been my first hint.  Dinner was so-so I could get that meal anywhere and it was not that great.  I didn't get a refill on my sweet tea during dinner and it cost me $2.95 for one glass!!!  Very disappointed, will not go back."
Dorothea P.,"Austin, TX",135,200,11,2.0,9/27/2012,"Went for dinner and drinks at the new Round Rock location after work.I have been once before at the Bay Area Blvd location in Clear Lake outside of Houston about 3 years ago.  I liked the Blonde Brew, that was pretty good. I ordered the thin crust create your own pizza with mushroom, artichoke and roaster garlic. The pizza was pretty bad. It was bland, the tomato sauce was very acidic and just overall had a bad flavor, and it overpowered the pizza. I enjoy a thin crust done well, but this crust was like stale crackers. Definitely over priced, for an individual pizza and 2 beers, I spent about 26 bucks. Definitely would not go back there to eat."
Kelvin R.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",24,23,4,4.0,7/18/2013,"Not too bad.  On a hot day, the drafts were cold and the food was pretty good.  I have heard most people say they don't like it here, but I totally disagree.  No reason not to enjoy yourself here."
