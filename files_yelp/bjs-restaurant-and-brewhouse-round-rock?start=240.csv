Jackie w.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,4.0,12/29/2013,"Decided to go for dinner on a Friday night with 6, so we called ahead as they suggest.  We were told to arrive in about 30 minutes which we did.  When we got there, the hostess said the wait would be 25 more minutes.  After 35 minutes, still not sealed, as hostess said they were waiting for a group to get up from our table.   As I hovered around the hostess, the manager asked if I needed help. He was great!  Suddenly there was a table for us that just needed to be cleaned.  They push the call ahead, but it didn't work for us.  Need to have the hostess be more proactive in checking tables and getting people seated.   Service was good, food typical BJs.  Enjoyable meal once we were seated.  Manager was very apologetic and gave us an appetizer.   Will go back, but not during peak times.  Not really worth the wait."
Kari P.,"Cedar Park, TX",99,95,3,5.0,7/21/2012,"Just about as awesome as it gets! The manager Chad is very nice, and our server Dewel :),  was very attentive and patient with our crowd of adults and kids!   Can't wait to go back!!"
Esteban G.,"Round Rock, TX",32,55,19,4.0,2/26/2013,Excellent beer selections and a great appetizer menu that is even better during happy hour. I'd recommend getting a seat at the bar and letting the bartender take care of you. The Beer Flights are a great way to sample several brews and they are poured in generous amounts.
Alan C.,"Austin, TX",0,9,,1.0,12/1/2012,"Went only for the food & not the beer - bad decision. The BBQ sauce they use is, in a word, nasty.  Don't order anything where it's used. The appetizer flat bread pizza was a disappointing cracker with a few ingredients on top. Can't see going back there again."
Ryan W.,"Pflugerville, TX",6,34,2,2.0,8/12/2012,"We decided to visit BJs on 8/11 around 6PM. The place was packed and we had a long wait, but decided to hold out and give it a try. My wife and I both ordered an alcoholic beverage, myself an IPA beer and my wife a pomegranate margarita.   My IPA was quite good, however my wife's margarita was not worth the $9.50! they charged for it. We had avocado egg rolls for an appetizer, which were quite good.  However my wife and I were unimpressed with our entrees. I had a calzone with pepperoni and pineapple, my wife had the angel hair toscana. My calzone tasted like something I could have bought and warmed myself from the HEB frozen section. Pepperoni seemed like a Hormel product.  My wife remarked that she's had better angel hair pasta dishes at Macaroni Grill... kind of sad to hear that! That said, we're going to give it one more try eventually because the pizza and burgers looked good but if those fail us we will not be returning."
Andrew C.,"Round Rock, TX",3,56,,3.0,8/28/2012,"Solid mid level chain restaurant. It's a step up from the nearby Chilis, for sure. My food was nice, our server wasn't quite as attentive as I would've liked, my son thought their take on Mac and Cheese was a little too bizarre (chipotle chilis in mac and cheese??). I had a decent tortilla soup and the reduced calorie pork chop. In my dish, the pork chop and golden potatoes were wonderful, but the dish was seriously marred by string beans that tasted like the chef used about 5 times too much black pepper. It was a seriously stupid move that very nearly ruined a very nice dish. My daughter had a very decent fettuccine alfredo.  Still, I'll go back and try more of their food. For now I'm giving the place 3 stars, but I'm willing to believe my beans' over-seasoning was an anomaly. Time will tell."
Melissa M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,6,,1.0,12/20/2014,"Talk about an overpriced Applebee's.  The drink prices are so outrageous they don't even list them.  If you have a palate for bland, non seasoned food then this the place for you.  I swear they open the frozen box to get the dinners.  At least the staff was nice."
Gee H.,"Austin, TX",29,34,51,1.0,8/9/2012,"How in the world can you not have fish and chips, it's on the bloody menu for goodness sake.  They just opened this location, you would at least think they would know how to properly order their inventory.  Very disappointed, especially when I am a BJ's regular back in Cali. Service was not the business either, the service is extremely slow. Now I am ranting, but seriously making up an excuse that BJ's policy to take your out of state ID to your manager is a bunch of doodoo, just say you weren't properly trained and not lie to me"
Tara L.,"Leander, TX",21,18,1,4.0,12/17/2012,"The portions are enormous!  You can split the entrees with a friend.  Their happy hour appetizers are a good deal, and their craft brews are great!"
Chris G.,"Georgetown, TX",3,99,7,2.0,9/12/2012,This was my third visit to a bjs and my last. A friend wanted to go here so I figured I'd try one last time. I got fish and chips and the fish was way overcooked and the fries were a little overcooked as well. This pretty much ruined the meal. I also did not get regular refills on tea and they kept bringing warm tea with no ice.
LaMarcus M.,"Manor, TX",96,91,13,3.0,2/17/2013,Staff was great and upbeat. Food was mediocre. Would probably go again only for the beer on tap.
Nick C.,"Pflugerville, TX",2,107,,2.0,5/1/2014,"I like the food but there are buts here.  The kitchen blows with getting the food out.  You can need a shave from the time you order the food and see it.  But it is good food.  Can be noisy and TV's all over the place all playing sports ND WHEN I SAY TV's I MEAN tvvvvvv'S  tHEY ARE EVERYWHERE.  It has the slowest kitchen of any restaurant I have ever been to.  The wait staff really has to have thick skins for all the comments about length of time to come to the table, take the order, fill the drinks and then to actually see the food is an event.  So if you have a lot of time and in no hurry and not starving its an okay place."
Chris O.,"Round Rock, TX",0,10,1,1.0,9/25/2014,"This is the worst experience I've had at BJs. We got seated immediately which was great, but our server didn't show so. Beer took 20 min. Only after I voiced my frustration did things improve. Very unfortunate. Its our neighborhood spot, but doubtful we'll return again."
Tiffany L.,"Spicewood, TX",66,113,25,3.0,11/21/2012,I enjoy BJ's. I've eaten there a couple of different times and it's been good every time. I think they are a little pricey but for occasional dinning it's worth it.
Rudi D.,"Round Rock, TX",3,44,2,2.0,5/19/2013,Was a big fan of the neighborhood BJ's back in Florida . . . however this one is below average at best.  Food is still BJ's . . . but takes forever to come out and beer is warm.  A few of the bartenders and servers have been nice . . . . but majority seem new.  They need to do something b/c they have potential and a great real estate spot off I-35.
Beth A.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,56,8,3.0,7/29/2012,"We went to this new location because we had a $4 off 2 entrees coupon (hey, we are not too proud to save a few bucks). Everything was just ok. BF had a cider and I had one of their limited edition beers. Both were decent. We had the watermelon and feta salad to share. This was simple and tasty.  The drinks and salad came out fairly quickly. This was not the case for the entrees. Not sure what the holdup was but the waitress came by a half dozen times to say she expected them out at any time. We even had a visit from the manager to tell us the same thing. Mind you, we never complained to anyone that it was taking too long, but they must have been able to tell things were delayed. When we did get our meals, my entree, the Hawaiian Mahi was lukewarm. I like my fish to be piping hot on my plate. BF had the Ahi tuna salad. My thought was they cooked my meal and forgot his and mine was left to cool off while his was cooking. Wish they would have put it back on the grill because it was slightly underdone. This is no fault of our server. She was very attentive maybe too much so. One thing I don't like about BJs Is the number of employees all running around.It seems sort of chaotic. There is always someone different bringing out a certain part of your meal. In the end, meal Ok, service decent, overall Meh."
Bryan C.,"Tampa, FL",3,12,,4.0,2/21/2013,"Sat at the bar and had excellent service from a great bartender. House beer was cold and a great pour! Food order was prepared quickly, could have used more dressing or a side of dressing included. Salad was a very big portion for the price."
S F.,"Austin, TX",2,5,,2.0,6/15/2014,"Large Chain Restaurant.  Usually not my thing....but wanted to eat something different.  Took about 15 minutes for our server to bring our drinks to the table.  I finished my appetizer salad before the drinks even got to the table.  Food was average.  My burger was okay....salad had just a tad too much dressing, but it was tasty.  All in all, i probably wouldn't go back anytime soon.  Mostly because I usually try to support local businesses over Chain restaurants, and it felt a little overpriced for the quality."
Albert G.,"Austin, TX",37,25,1,3.0,1/1/2013,"Menu reminds me of Cheesecake factory that has merged with a sports bar. If you are looking to catch the game this is a great place for beer and has so many screens you will not miss a moment of the playoffs, worldcup, whatever you are into."
C L R.,"Hutto, TX",2,32,,4.0,8/30/2013,"GREAT fish tacos.  We have been tot his location several times, always had good food and service."
