Ryan R.,"Pflugerville, TX",3,4,,4.0,2/28/2013,"I enjoyed my burger and Chris, the mangager on duty **proactively** came up to our table when he saw our table was taking longer than expected to get food. Offered us a 50% discount to make compensate.  So, good food, when there was a problem, the manager Chris was all over it ensuring we were taken care of.  Cannot ask for much more than that so I'm recommending them and will visit there again.  Thanks, ryan"
Chuck V.,"Round Rock, TX",13,12,,1.0,1/31/2013,"I had a bad experience here, in almost every way - granted, they had just opened and the staff was probably still inexperienced, but they had been open for a couple of months. The entire family went, and ordered many things from the menu, all of which was bland (how can you fail at spaghetti and meat balls???). The only good things were the appetizers. The beer was drinkable, but barely colder than room temperature."
Kim K.,"Round Rock, TX",2,8,,5.0,4/30/2013,Amazing! we stopped here a couple of weeks ago for dinner not knowing what to expect and boy we were not let down. The bartender helped us choose a beer while we waited for the table and was so knowledgeable about which would suit our individual tastes. Very friendly and curteous staff! After we were seated our server showed the same enthusiasm as the bartender extending the knowledge of the beers available even more. We both got the pulled bbq pork sandwiches which were amazing! Served with a side of coleslaw that balances the smokey flavor of the bbq sauce extremely well and the thin cut fries we couldn't ask for a better end to our saturday evening! I only was able to eat a quarter of the sandwich and my boyfriend was only able to eat half of his so needless to say they did not skimp on the size of these sandwiches! I highly reccomend!!!!
Yesasvini R.,"Cedar Park, TX",68,38,,4.0,6/5/2014,"Several choices for vegetarians, I got the southwestern salad, they subbed the chicken with veggie black bean patty.Watermelon feta salad ( summer only) is a must try. Stay away from the pastas."
Amanda M.,"Sammamish, WA",0,26,,3.0,5/24/2014,Meh.  Saturday at 6 we got in with no wait.  Waitress was very nice and helpful despite all the problems with our service.  Kids food came WAY after the adults food.  Salad had a gross amount of dressing but they brought another as soon as we complained.  Bill was over charged for kids dessert but they fixed that too.  Food was good though when correct.
Tracey S.,"Georgetown, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/16/2014,"A very busy Saturday night so service was slow as expected. Ordered  drinks took  twenty minutes. Ordered Calamari which came out at the same time as the drinks and cold. Asked to talk with the manager and what a treat, we got the most arrogant condescending please do not come back to this restaurant  from Grant Raybourn. This guy is is so rude, he does not belong in customer service."
Jason K.,"Round Rock, TX",160,10,1,5.0,12/3/2012,"Service has been great every time I have visited this restaurant! The last time I was there, I took a buddy out for lunch. My friend spends 98% of his time traveling the U.S. and is exposed to all kinds of dining... We were both impressed with the quality/price of the food. To top it off when we walked out the door,  one of the managers gave us a $25 gift card for absolutely no reason."
John D.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,50,6,2.0,5/16/2014,"I've eaten at this BJ's frequently since it has opened. It was ok when it first opened, typical new restaurant problems I can work with that - IF it improves. Unfortunately it hasn't. Poor staffing on what should be the busiest days/times of the week. Disappearing wait staff, they reappeared long enough to leave the check though. Oops your tip disappeared too! Cooks not paying attention to what they're doing - wrapping not completely removed from 2 burgers at the same table. Instead of getting better they are continuing their slide into obscurity. Save your money, pass this one up!"
Carolyn C.,"Georgetown, TX",0,20,,1.0,3/5/2013,"We had lunch at BJs and I was looking forward to having the Mahi Mahi tacos.  I had them a few months ago and loved them.  Today, there was a small slice of fish on each taco with the usual slaw filler.  I mentioned this to our server and he said it was the usual amount because Mahi Mahi is so expensive.  The last time I had this, it was full of fish chunks.  I was impressed enough to recommend it to my sister.  I will never recommend this again.  The manager came over and of course said that was the usual amount of fish in the tacos.  I told him I would not have ordered it again if that were so.  He was nice enough to get me another taco with extra fish and it was good but I won't be able to order extra fish if I were to order it again, which I won't.  I will order fish tacos in places that fill the taco with more fish."
Lee F.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,5.0,2/17/2013,"Great beer, great food, great service and great atmosphere.  a little pricey but the experience makes it worth it.   An upscale brewery...AND THE WORLD NEEDS MORE OF THEM!  :-)"
Melissa M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,11,,3.0,9/1/2014,"I generally really like BJ's. I used to go there all the time when I lived in CA. Sadly this BJ'S is sub par.  I've been many times and the food often comes out wrong, the portions seem smaller than they used to be, the service is slow, and it's more expensive. I don't mind paying more if the portions were what they used to be."
Christin N.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,1/23/2013,"I was refereed to BJ's by a close friend. Ive been three times all of which have been terrible! first time I had TERRIBLE service, my server actually didn't visit my table but twice! second time my order was not only wrong but the hostess was so nasty to me that when I said I'd like to speak to a manager she cussed in front of / at me and the last and ONLY time I will ever step foot in the restaurant my server was not only neglectful but it took an hour for my food to hit the table and I order fish that could have easily been confused with tofu! I tried multiple times to like this place and Ive even tried to keep an open mind but as far as I'm concerned I'm done with this joint and will not refer or return again."
Josh R.,"Cedar Park, TX",5,10,,4.0,10/6/2012,"Awesome place w good food, great drinks, fun staff, and dessert that blows you away."
Tammy S.,"Austin, TX",0,8,,4.0,1/12/2013,"Seated at the bar right away.  Went on a Saturday afternoon.  Very loud ambiance.  The drinks from the bar were watered down and EXTREMELY OVERPRICED; but the chips and salsa were great. The waitress, Jessica, was great.  The food was outstanding.  The pot roast sandwich and the chicken lettuce tacos was awesome. Will go again."
sharon d.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,17,,1.0,7/12/2014,"Went in about 1pm on a Friday (there were 6 of us), got a table within about 5 minutes.  The table hadn't been cleaned first so the hostess attempted to clean it as we sat.  It was a round booth table so she couldn't reach the entire width.  I attempted to help her ( which I didn't mind), but the rag left the table really wet so my daughter asked if we could get a different rag.  The hostess went off to get it and my daughter went to wash her hands as the table was pretty gross.  As she walked back she heard the hostess telling the manager ""some woman over there is bitching and moaning"".  15 minutes go by with no waitress and us wondering if it was possible hostess had been talking about us.  She comes back and I apologize if we had been high maintenance.  She replies ""oh"".  My daughter replied she had heard her complaining about a customer.   She admitted she was talking about us but tried to say it was about something under our booth.  Wow.  We asked for the manager and while we waited, another 5 minutes, a waitress comes over.  The same waitress we'd seen walk by our table about 10 times in the 15 minutes were no one stopped to see if we'd like something to drink, nothing.  We could tell it wasn't going to be good when she barely smiled and said only, ""sorry for the long wait"".  We said we were waiting for the manager and probably would be leaving.  The manager came - the same person the hostess was talking to in the open about the bitching and moaning customer.  That's a problem.  First- nothing wrong (and completely normal), for waitstaff to complain about customers - what is wrong is for them to be so indiscreet about it.  And to the manager in front of customers.  That's behavior that is clearly condoned by him and I'm sure wasn't the first time.  Shows bad leadership.  He told us he would serve us himself if we stayed.  If a manager is ok with his employees speaking so blatantly about a customer BY the customers table, what kind of food do we think we are going to get?  It worried us to be honest.  Corporate will be notified because he shouldn't be in charge of anyone serving customers."
Lisa C.,"Georgetown, TX",0,104,2,3.0,2/3/2014,"Staff is very friendly, price is on par for this type of venue, 8oz sirloin is so small it looks like an oblong meat ball, Bison burger is OK.  If your wanting a good steak or burger, I'd suggest Texas Land and Cattle.  I don't see myself going out of my way to come back."
Mary N.,"Round Rock, TX",40,12,,1.0,11/29/2012,"In a nut shell, horrible, the menu is pretty extensive, but overpriced for the portion sized, the place was crowded, so you get the pack em' in move em' out feel... and the  server we had that night was just awful, started out with spotted and finger smeared silverware.. that should of been my first hint.. it was just me and the hubby, I ordered the fish and chips and he had a burger, we had the fried calamari appetizer, it was over fried, to the point of almost being burnt... but moving on, the waiter (actually a food runner not our waiter, nowhere to be found.... brought out our meals ),  I got fried shrimp?? what where is my fish n chips??  How do you mess up a simple order with just two people at the table??They offered to  correct the dish but after waiting 25 minutes for the food to begin with I settled for the mistaken dish...ehhh it's fried shrimp no big deal... but if I wanted fried shrimp I would of ordered it...we saw our waiter afterwards with little to no concern about his mess up, had to chase another waiter down to get a soda... just a mess, the manager did come to our table and removed the shrimp from our check and offered a free dessert to go, so great, I would love to take my dessert home, I just want to dessert the table, so we waited and waited for the dessert to come, and low and behold they brought out the dessert to sit and eat.. not packed up and ready to go, really c'mon can't the manager even get an order right? Well we just  paid and left, on the way out, the waiter actually yelled down the aisle  saying good I don't care.... my husband went back to the manager and asked for our check back  and explained to the manager what an obnoxious waiter that guy was and what he said.... we removed what little tip he was going to get to one big fat zero! We have never not tipped a server, but he was a real piece of work...  don't think we will be going back to BJ's for a while..... oh yeah and by the way, the burger, overcooked, and dry, better burgers at whaddaburger for Pete's sake lol!!"
Anna L.,"Round Rock, TX",3,51,35,2.0,12/30/2013,"The service was mediocre, not mean, seems wait staff is really busy. The wait for our food was horrible...30+ min. I had my hungry kids with me, so it wasn't fun. We didn't order anything fancy, pizza for kids and roast beef sandwich for me. The pizza was good. Roast beef sandwich did not taste fresh, dried dark brown edges on the meat. The kids finished their food before I got my meal. They were nice to comp my sandwich for the wait. Overall, not great experience."
C. S.,"Austin, TX",4,187,,2.0,10/12/2013,"First experience here on a Friday night. I am not sure if anyone there cares if we come back. The best thing we ate - an appetizer of fried artichokes with aioli (delicious). Then, we tried the special that came with salad or soup, pizza, and a dessert. Pizza was OK for deep dish - a step above Pizza Hut, but the spciy meatball was not special. Wedge salad is what one would expect for a chain - not bad. A few bacon and blue cheese crumbles tossed on top with some bottled dressing. Dessert was a large, warm, macadamia cookie with some ice cream - pretty tasty. Who doesn't like a warm cookie with ice cream? The whole experience was a little lackluster, but folks seem to dig it as the place was packed. B.J.'s seems like a cool concept though for a chain. We might go back. in addition, we did not get the annoying upsell as commented on in other reviews. The staff was professional and attentive, but there was little warmth. They seemed a little overwhelmed by crowds."
Mike K.,"Round Rock, TX",0,18,,1.0,4/12/2013,"I have eaten here on two occasions and have problems both times. The service is very slow. If you have only a 1 hour lunch you will be late. We went with mini-pizzas and soup for lunch and we waited over 30 minutes to get the food. Overall, we we there about 1 hour and 15 minutes. The food was just ok. After we complained the manager sent us a gift card so we tried them again. This time it was for dinner. We got hassled at the front desk because we didn't have a rewards card. It took them several extra minutes of fussing before we were shown a seat. Again, very slow service. We ordered the fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken. The chicken came out with a good amount of some black coating on the outside that tasked like smokey dirt. The noodles were not fully cooked. The beer, at least, was good. Don't waste your time here- there are better places."
