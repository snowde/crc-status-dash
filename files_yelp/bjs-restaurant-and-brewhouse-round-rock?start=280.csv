Mandy S.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/7/2012,"I love BJ's. Just not this one! I'm not one to write restaurant reviews, especially negative ones, but my experience a few weeks ago was just that bad. Strike one:  We arrived at 12:30 for lunch and were told there would be about a 15-20 minute wait. Reasonable, we thought.  About 35 minutes later we were shown to our table.  Strike two: Once finally seated we were looking forward to some lunch as it was now after 1:00. Unfortunately, our hunger would have to wait even longer. We didn't get our food until nearly 2:00! After waiting about 45 minutes our waitress said she had checked on our food and they were just waiting on our kid's cheese pizza. Really? A tiny cheese pizza takes 45 minutes to cook? Glad we didn't order a larger one. So, 5 minutes later they finally bring out our food (all from the appetizer menu or lunch menu... My point, it shouldn't have been anything that would take extra time), well except for the cheese pizza. Luckily, I have the world's most patient four year old, but even she was a little cranky at this point. Wish I could say the food was worth the wait. For four of us it was ""okay"" but the fifth ordered a baked potato that came out hard as a brick. It was sent back and we didn't want to wait any longer so just asked it to be removed from the bill.  The kid's cheese pizza wasn't very good either. I'm sure they purposefully don't serve it piping hot for kids but it should have at least tasted fresh out of the oven. Instead it tasted more like it had just been reheated.  Strike three: No, it doesn't end there. We asked to talk to the manager after our food finally came out and potato was so terrible, and rather than coming by our table immediately in an attempt to resolve the issues, he sent another waitress over offering a free dessert. We had been in this restaurant for nearly two hours at this point. The last thing we wanted to do was wait for more food. When the manager finally did come over, nearly 30 minutes after we made the request, he sounded shocked to hear that weren't satisfied with the service offered. If my daughter hadn't had to go to the restroom we would have already left before he even bothered to show up.  He kept blaming the fact that they were new, and without offering anything more than an empty promise that they'd get better, he actually had the nerve to say he hoped we'd come back soon.  Don't count on that! For the overall reputation of BJ's I hope they do improve, but my family and I won't be revisiting this location to find out. When we need our BJ's fix we'll just visit the others in Austin."
Massiel P.,"Temple, TX",0,8,1,1.0,7/28/2013,"Don't waste your money! Not to give a 0 star, warm beer, freezer cold BBQ chicken breast, reheated, warm outside, freeze inside,  and that was the special of the day! Never ever!"
Shirley W.,"Round Rock, TX",0,10,,1.0,12/6/2013,"I have dined here twice, each time the service was horrible.  If you want to wait a long time for your food this is the place.  Bad service is a turn off for me. The food was good, but that is not enough to keep me coming back.  I will go to the BJ's in Austin off of Mopac.  Get a clue about your wait staff."
Nancy M.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,17,1,3.0,8/24/2013,"First time to BJ's:  friday night and very crowded. Waited 30 minutes when they said it would be 15.  Many prople walked right in and were seated immediately because they had called ahead. Fair enough, i suppose, but that caused grumblings from the waiting customers.  After being seated, our service was sub-par. Everything took longer than it should have. I got the feeling that it wasnt a waitstaff issue, but a systems issue.  The food was excellent!  Baja shrimp tacos were delicious, and the fettucini alfredo was tasty. Saw lots of good food on tables.   Seems to me that if they could streamline their serving system they'd get more stars."
T T.,"Round Rock, TX",5,81,18,2.0,8/15/2012,"I like BJ's so I went knowing it was newly open. The servers were everywhere but they had no idea what they were doing. We were offered 4 different tables food. The final time I said listen you are the 4th server to bring us food that isn't ours, where is our appetizer sampler - and she got our waitress who didn't turn in our order!!!  Horrible service. I know they just opened but this was really bad. Food was just ok- when we finally got it.  I do recommend their watermelon salad though! I hope to give it another try in a few months."
Amy B.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,8,2.0,5/29/2013,"We normally like this restaurant chain, but this location is very inconsistent with both the quality of the food and service.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible."
Mark H.,"Georgetown, TX",0,6,,1.0,9/6/2014,"My wife and I went in for lunch on a Saturday. Sat in the bar area. Waitress dropped the menus and got the drink order. Drinks were served and we asked for a few minutes to decide on our order. Twenty minutes later she finally made it back. There was a table of four that both she and the manager were doting on and another table of five that caught her interest but my wife and I, although in the middle of both, got no service. When she finally found time for us we ordered an appetizer and burgers. We asked to delay the burger order, that we wanted the appetizer first. She responded she would. After a half hour or so the burgers were put in front of us. Not a minute later they tried to set the appetizer on the table. No thanks. The manager came over we got 'blah blah sorry you should have had better service' but that is our last visit. The waitress' total disregard for us in favor of a potentially higher tip was insulting. Little did she know..."
T T.,"Austin, TX",0,107,7,2.0,11/1/2012,"Holy cow, the yelp's overall  2 1/2 star rating says it all as a restaurant.  The place was almost empty when I arrived but it seemed an eternity before someone came to take drink orders. When she did she took our food orders as well. That's fine but she preceded to take other tables orders seated around me, then went to get our drinks. The ahi salad was good served with a rice wine vinaigrette with the exception of the rancid tomatoes. My lunch companion had a house salad , not fresh but dried out with the same bad tomatoes. Her other selections were acceptable but not great. Our server never returned. Our drinks were never refilled. When I  finished lunch and looked around to ask for the check, I noticed 4 tables around me also finished, waiting for their checks. As we sat, we made eye contact with each other, rolled eyes... Eventually the server showed up with checks for all the tables at once. If there was a problem, it was not conveyed. After waiting for an eternity for the check, I decided to not pay by credit card and instead left the only cash i had that included a meager tip. The service was terrible. My luncheon companion said she had experienced similar service on another occasion. That's all the confirmation I need to know  I won't be experimenting with BJ's again."
G G.,"Round Rock, TX",0,3,,4.0,8/11/2012,"I love this ""spot"".  The atmosphere is great and so is the food.  The manager--well, I'm still on the fence regarding him.  He's not so friendly (the evening shift mgr).  I figure, I'll still be patronizing BJ's after he's gone (which won't be long, after reading the reviews).  Anywho, great place!"
Theresa T.,"Round Rock, TX",37,10,,2.0,7/2/2012,"Based on the food, I would give them 5 stars. We orderd the new thai salad, deep dish pizza, stuffed mushrooms, tortilla soup, dessert and two drinks. The service was very slow for a Monday night and then our drinks were spilled on us. It took us about a half hour or longer to actually get our drinks. Plus I had a stain in my shirt when I got home from the drink being spilled on us. I know accidents happened, but the least they could have done was compensated our drinks and an apology from the manager."
Allie S.,"Cedar Park, TX",2,15,1,1.0,9/3/2013,"Not the Bjs I know that's for sure! I'm from Houston where the Bjs restaurants are on point and down right amazing. Thinking I would get the same experience here in Austin my boyfriend and I went to the one in round rock. We walked in, sat and ordered a salad, broc and cheddar soup, and five meat medium pizza to share. First off our waitress brought the wedge salad without the soup and said said sorry but we ran out of soup an have to make more it shouldn't be long; it's rude to bring one persons food and not the others. The wedge salad looked pitiful and was unappetizing. The pizza came (still no soup) where I unrolled my silverware to find my fork not just dirty but food still crusted on it disgusting. I told the waitress and she got me another. The pizza wasn't crispy like it was at the other locations. Then came my soup which tasted like it was a powder mix they added water and cheese to. I couldn't eat it. The table next to us had a similar issue with their baked potato; the i guess manager came out saying sorry but we dont have any baked potatoes for you at this time, the ones from lunch are not serve able  and the dinner ones arent ready yet. The dessert was good but it's kind of hard to screw up a cookie. As I was getting up from the table I saw the salt which had black specks all on it-i don't know about you but where I come from salt is white and if there's black stuff it's contaminated. The beer was good, the bar was great, but this location is a bar first and restaurant second. The kitchen and wait staff are lacking which I feel is a product of pour managing! I will not again."
Abby D.,"Hutto, TX",0,11,,1.0,6/1/2013,"It's all about first impressions with me. My family and I went to BJs to try something new. We had never been to one before and my brother in law picked it for his and his son's joint birthday dinner. We waited for over 40 minutes. We understand, places get busy. But there was no seating for people waiting. Also, some tables in the bar area would be cleared and people who came in after us would just hand the hostess their flashy thing and say 'forget it, we found our own table"" and sit down, even though they were going to sit someone else there. We waited about 50 minutes for our food to come out. It took 20 just to get our chips and salsa. My food came out wrong so we had to send it back. We managed to get a manager over and he wasn't helpful at all. He acted like he didn't care. We made it a point to say it wasn't the servers fault, yet he went and bitched at her anyway. When they finally brought my pizza out, it was smaller than the one they had brought originally. I mentioned it and he sassed me about knowing what I ordered. He did at least comp me for the pizza. When we got the check though we saw that we had originally been charged for the correct pizza AND the incorrect pizza."
Cherlynn L.,"Austin, TX",8,40,,2.0,1/26/2013,"Almost every time my husband and I go to this restaurant, we get the wrong order. Last evening (Saturday) I ordered the Thai salmon. That's not what I got. I got the Miso salmon and while there is not much difference, the Thai salmon comes with a mango salsa on top. Mine didn't. I didn't notice at first, then I asked the waitress where the salsa was. She went and got me some. My husband always gets the Maui pork chop and usually it's really good. BJs has gone downhill. The manager came over and acted like it was all just a one time happening. The dinner salad that came with my meal was just iceberg lettuce with two slices of tomoto and one slice of cucumber, and a couple of carrot slivers. CHEAP!! So I asked the manager about how cheap the salads were, and he said he never eats the dinner salads. So I asked about the owner and do they ever listen to customer comments. The manager said and I quote, ""The owner is from San Antonio and is an Aggie!!! That tells you what he's about.""  Wow, usually the manager is professional and not dissing the owner. So we are done with BJs. We go out to dinner a lot and have had other discussions with the manager to let them know what we weren't happy about. I ALWAYS tell the manager I don't want anything free, it's more a discussion of how we as customers feel when things don't go right and hope the comments will go up the chain so that the restaurant gets better, rather than not care. Well we feel BJs doesn't care and we are not going back."
Robin B.,"Hutto, TX",1,3,,3.0,8/13/2012,"My kids and I had after church dinner here with a friend and her daughter. We enjoyed the food.  I ordered the pork chops and they were great.  The green beans could have used some seasoning but the cheesy potatoes were fabulous. The kids ordered the pizza on the kids meal and added toppings to the pepperoni pizza. The pizza I must say was good.  It is that deep dish pizza, reminds me of the old Godfather's pizza.  I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the menu is too much.  It makes it hard to decide on what to get. I must say I had a side watermelon and feta salad that was great.  I love good salads and this was definitely one. The service was okay. We had 2 tickets for the table and we gave her 2 credit cards, each in a separate  bill holder.  She picked them both up but only returned to the table with one.  She said that she only picked up one and we told her no you got them both. My friend looked in her wallet to see if her card was there and she told her no.  But she kinda still insisted that she didn't get it.  I said you did so you need to go and find it.  She found it where she had put it down somewhere.  I know this can be an honest mistake but before you disagree with the customer go back and check yourself.  Based on some of what I have read this restaurant really needs to work from the philosophy that the Customer is always right. The 3 stars is because of the service issue."
