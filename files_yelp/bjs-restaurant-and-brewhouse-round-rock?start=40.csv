Christie P.,"Hutto, TX",0,5,,1.0,8/18/2016,We got seated and no one came by our table for 15 minutes. We finally got up and left. Terrible. The mgr contacted me and asked me to send him my email.. I did that and I never got any response!
candice c.,"Marble Falls, TX",17,29,1,1.0,7/25/2016,Terrible terrible service. We were there during a slow time of day (1:30 pm) and hardly anyone was in the restaurant. Our food took 45 min to get to our table after ordering. Absolutely ridiculous when there is no one in the restaurant. Waitress seemed completely miserable.  The only reason we went was because of my daughter's bday and she loves that place. We will not be back. Ever.
Alejandra T.,"Round Rock, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,So I went at 3pm for a meal just myself and one other person. I had first wait 10min for a table for TWO people. Then once I was seated no one came to introduce themselves as our waiter nor take our drink order. The restaurant wasn't full as all and there was waiters just standing around. I probably won't be back to this location ever again. You just lost a customer who's been going to different BJ's for a number of years
Michael L.,"Austin, TX",27,9,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Good beer, very bad cooking. For a huge menu, they don't cook any of it well. Even the salad was old a soggy.  Got me for 2- $70.00 meals, there won't be a 3rd.  Never had the problem at the south location, the RR location needs to fire the cooking staff. If you can cook pasta until done, get out of the kitchen."
Joseph A.,"Austin, TX",211,154,48,3.0,8/5/2016,"This restaurant is hit or miss for the most part. Most of the time it's a solid option, but during peak lunch/dinner times... for get about it! When they are on their game, this BJ's food and drinks are awesome! Will return to this BJ's only because I love this restaurant and this location is the closest. If I'm in a different part of town and craving pizza, I'll eat at another BJ's Brewhouse instead."
Elle L.,"Hutto, TX",0,4,8,2.0,7/10/2016,"We usually enjoy this place, not today, domain location is definitely better quality food. From the watermelon feta salad that was short on watermelon and feta, to the dry brown gross brussels sprouts that were disgusting. And even the monkey bread pazookies were skimpy on size and sauce"
Donna J.,"Round Rock, TX",16,17,,2.0,6/5/2016,"We stop going to BJ last year but decided to give it another chance. The service and atmosphere was great the food was not good. We order bacon, avocado, tomatoes with really crispy bacon.  The bacon was not cooked and had to be sent back. The two stars is for service and the manager did come over to see if they could redo the sandwich."
Emilio H.,"Pflugerville, TX",21,8,1,3.0,6/27/2016,"The food was great.  The drinks were great. Our a waiter Jamie was great. The greeter Kayla not so great.  The whole job of a greeter is to greet or to make you feel welcome. She did not do that in the lest. She wanted to seat US close to loud table, but that was not what we were looking for so I asked for a different table. Well how dare I make such an obtuse request. She never smiled at us and when she did walk by she would look the other way to avoid eye contact.  Kayla should not be the first point of contact with customers.  Long day or not, you are still on the job. We did speak with manger, she did comp our entree.  That was not what we were looking for, just a pleasant evening. We will go back, and give them another chance. Too many positives to write bjs off."
Scarlett H.,"Georgetown, TX",93,20,2,1.0,10/7/2016,"Ruined my night out with hubby! We ordered apps they never came.... My sandwich was a scandal, I had to come home and fix it up to make it edible!  When I returned with the Photos of my sandwich, I was Told it's a Cooperate Store, they're just following orders! The orders suck, as did my encounter with Management who blew me off!  Don't go....."
Harrison C.,"Snyder, NY",55,250,59,2.0,6/7/2015,"""My name is Marisa and I'll be taking care of you."" Our nightmare thus began. We arrived at 9pm with plans to catch a 10pm movie at the theater in the same plaza.  The restaurant was practically empty, so we figured this was a good time to get dinner. My friend ordered a portobello mushroom burger, while I ordered salmon. Marisa took the order and 5 minutes later came back to tell us that they were out of portobello mushrooms. So my friend changes his order to another burger.  We wait. And wait. And wait.  15 minutes later, I ask Marisa if they had any bread because we were hungry. She replied that the restaurant no longer gave out ""complimentary bread"" but that she could do garlic bread very quickly.  I told her that would work as long as the bread was fast - why pay extra for bread if the meal was about to come out?   No problem, she said.  Our meal was 10 minutes away, so she'd bring out the bring immediately. We wait. And wait. Another 15 minutes later, I have to ask another waiter if Marisa was around because she was no where in sight. Finally she comes to our table and I ask her what's happened to the garlic bread.   Her reply, ""Oh, that's right. I said I was going to bring some, didn't I?"" (No apology) I told her to cancel the order of bread, but she said that the bread would come out with our meal and that was just 10 minutes away. We wait, etc.... and she finally brings out the bread.   Another 10 minutes later, and we're past abandoning all hope of being able to catch the movie. Finally our meals arrive, and Marissa presents the plates with great flourish as if they were on time masterpieces.  And again no apology from Marisa - she could have made things a little better with a ""sorry for the wait."" Though the service was terrible, the food was better.  My friend was happy with his burger although the wedge fries were like Incan mummies.  My salmon was a little overcooked and the sides were shockingly tiny in portion."
Nicki D.,"Round Rock, TX",276,426,1167,2.0,4/15/2015,"Nothing really exciting here. Went in late Monday night for a bite and some drinks with a friend, and walked out having seen a $67 bill that was like WTF.  2 top shelf margaritas @ $10.25 a pop. REALLY?  1 Whiskeys on the rocks @ $9.25 a pop. REALLY? (and not a big selection of Whikeys either, I might add)  1 reverse HH Mojito, that wasn't muddled @ $5 a pop.  1 order of the chicken pot stickers, 1 order of the fried avocado egg rolls & an order of the carnitas fries. Carnitas fries need a lot more cheese, and was better with some sour cream. Pot stickers aren't really ""fried"", but they aren't steamed either. Could have used a few more seconds over a flame, imo.  Was the food good. Yeah, it was alright. Was it to die for? Not at all. I could have done better at Chilis, to be honest. Price wise, and flavor wise. The tastiest thing was the tamarind sauce on the egg rolls. Food was presented nicely, and it wasn't BAD, it just wasn't a $67 experience in my opinion.  Even at 8:45, with a fairly empty restaurant, sitting in the, the service was slow.  Go back? Eh.. not my first choice."
Colleen A.,"Round Rock, TX",27,12,61,1.0,6/9/2017,"I am writing to express my EXTREME disappointment in my most recent experience at your Round Rock location. I placed the order on my app and went to pick up the order at the designated time. However, my order wasn't ready. I don't mind waiting a bit, so I waited patiently. I told the cashier in the takeout area that I had a coupon that I received via email. She told me that she'd need to get the manager. Fine. So, I waited. The manager came, didn't greet me, started typing stuff on the cash register like she was in a hurry and then said, ""here!"" and walked off. I said ""Excuse me"" twice as she was walking away, but she didn't hear me or her mind was somewhere else. So, I see her go in the back and I can see through the window she is eating food in the kitchen, where my meal is being prepared. I waited longer. The cashier finally came back with food (they were ""waiting on fries"") and I told her that I needed to speak to the manager because she didn't give me the right discount. The manager comes back and fixes it, and tells me to have a nice day. I was a bit irritated at this point, but my family was hungry so I take the food home. I get home and unpack the food and my ahi salad is completely wilted and the ahi was almost nonexistent. There were maybe 5 squares that were less than 1/2"" square, cut very thin. This is less than half the tuna I get at other locations. I couldn't even eat it the salad because it was warm and wilted. When I added the dressing, it all went to mush. The calamari was cold. Have you ever tried to eat cold, rubbery calamari?! YUCK. And my husband said that his fries weren't hot. So gross - all of it. The pizza was pizza. My kids ate it. We were totally disappointed with this experience. We have just moved to the area and we used to go to BJ's in San Diego often. I can't imagine EVER going back to this location, if I can be convinced to go at all."
Brittany B.,"Round Rock, TX",105,35,2,5.0,4/4/2016,"The past two times in memory we have dined here have been top notch. Great service, great food. I love ordering the deep dish pizzas, half and half with two different toppings. They are always very accommodating and the food is always delicious.  The ambiance is nice. My husband enjoys keeping an eye on whatever sports are on, all the while still being family friendly. The kids meal corn dogs are fabulous! Wish they had an adult version.  Great job BJ's! This has become a family favorite!"
A C.,"Petoskey, MI",0,24,3,2.0,2/3/2017,"Caesar salad came with 1/2 a crouton on it & no Parmesan cheese on it or even offered. Rate this salad a 2.2.  Sent it back for house salad & while this was ok, there was a tiny little piece of what we think was a tomato on it-  not much of a variety on it of anything else but lettuce & flakes of cheese. Rate house salad a 3.2.  I ordered spaghetti & meatballs. Meatballs tasted like soy.  Spaghetti was ok. Rate the spaghetti a 3.4.  Waitress never brought xtra napkins.  Took like literally 20 minutes processing our payments to the point we wondered if she was back there copying our card info.  Rate the waitress a 2.8.  Would not be inclined to go back again."
Abby E.,"Pflugerville, TX",65,6,,1.0,12/11/2016,"So slow!!! Food was ok, not great, but the wait time was way longer than appropriate. Not terribly busy, we were seated right away. Entrees took over 30 minutes to arrive and dessert took another 20 minutes!"
Hannah P.,"Pflugerville, TX",175,309,1135,4.0,5/2/2015,Nice atmosphere. Good service. I ordered the chicken sandwich with crispy fries. The chicken was really good and fries came out crispy and fresh.  A good variety of food to select from. Will definitely come back to try the deep dish pizza and save room to try out the desserts next time.
Brock S.,"Round Rock, TX",1,54,,2.0,5/26/2017,"Food is so so, but the new tablets the wait staff has to use to take an order are horrendous.  We had to repeat ourselves multiple times.  If this was an attempt to speed up service, it's a major fail."
Kimberly T.,"Round Rock, TX",5,22,7,3.0,3/23/2016,My family and I love this restaurant! The food is always amazing and the staff is always very nice. We like to get here before the dinner rush so we don't have a long wait but if there is one it is totally worth it! Great options for healthy eating and for those nights when you eat what ever you like! We come here at least once a month sometimes twice! Update: Last couple of times here service had been meh... Our waitress had two tables including us and other servers were bringing our food. When we got our bill we had a drink on it for a different table. She was SO slow.
Jon S.,"Frisco, TX",108,21,13,3.0,8/10/2016,It all started with them bringing out the wrong order. I ordered a simple grilled cheese and they brought out one loaded with a bunch of meat and extras. The fries were cold. Service from waiter was decent. Not my favorite bjs experience.
Robert K.,"Hutto, TX",577,54,107,3.0,6/23/2016,"The food is great along with the atmosphere and the employees.....however the food always takes forever and comes completely off time, like getting your appetizers the same time as the main course. My wife however does love their soups!"
