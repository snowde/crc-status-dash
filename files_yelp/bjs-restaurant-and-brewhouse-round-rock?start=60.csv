Morgan F.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,2.0,9/2/2017,"I only give 2 stars because their hostess that was working their lunch/afternoon shift was the rudest hostess I have ever dealt with. I wish I would of gotten her name so the managers could train her to be a little more friendly to customers coming in. When we got up to the hostess stand she acted like it killed her to even talk to me. After she rudely asked for my name and  told us about the wait and we sat down my nana decided she wanted a menu. When I asked the same girl for one she handed it to me OVER HER SHOULDER. She didn't even look at me. My family and I almost just walked our due to her sour attitude. I'm glad we didn't though. Our server Tyrone was wonderful!!! He brought out everything in a timely manner, even got my sister and I to try some of the hand crafted beer. Our food was yummy, and the wait staff was so sweet woth my 6 month old  daughter. I would recommend coming her just beware of the blonde with a horrible attitude in the front!!!"
Zuhayr M.,"Pflugerville, TX",2,9,5,5.0,4/4/2016,"We came to eat some delicious pizookies, and delicious they were! We don't come here very often, but when we do, we are always satisfied. We had to wait a little while, and the waiter came. When she did she apologized for the inconvenience. After ordering, the manager came by and apologized again and told us the desserts were on the house! We were very satisfied and will definitely come again soon!"
L L.,"Austin, TX",0,19,3,3.0,6/19/2016,"Like the ambiance. Wish they didn't turn potentially healthy choices into unhealthy fried and cheesy foods. Wouldn't go here for a good, balanced meal."
A M.,"Austin, TX",1,23,8,1.0,2/2/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Walked in and we weren't even greeted, but instead treated like we were inconveniencing them to get a table. We were finally seated, but never waited on. After sitting patiently for over 10 minutes we got up and walked out. Not once were we approached or spoken to. So sad because we had always had great experiences in the past. We won't be back now unless the service issues are addressed."
Nic G.,"San Diego, CA",2,17,1,2.0,8/2/2016,"I've been to the BJ's in San Diego, CA so I was looking forward to this one. I've been a few times and I have only found one thing one the menu I like. Everything else sucks. The service is decent. Service and the one item is the only reason this place got 2 stars."
Christian C.,"Round Rock, TX",161,55,37,4.0,9/14/2014,"We needed to find a place where all four in our party could get what we wanted. So we decided on BJ's. I got the California burger, which was really flavorful, but actually quite small. It came with a variety of veggies including avocado, tomato, and roasted green chiles. Luckily, the beer I had helped fill me up to make up for the portion. Try the Totonka Stout and the Nutty Brewnette.  They're both brewed by BJ's and are really good. My wife ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which she enjoyed. It came with mashed potatoes and broccoli that were cooked nicely. Our buddy got the Tuscan Chicken, which he said he enjoyed. My cousin ended up not being so hungry and got the Bacon Macaroni starter. He loves macaroni...no matter what, so no accurate feedback on that dish. Our server was really friendly and cheerful. However, she did seem a little frazzled with taking care of too many tables at once.  We waited quite a while in between getting checked on for refills, picking up finished plates, dropping off the tab, etc. All in all, for a chain, this location is clean, consistent, and offers a large variety of food and drinks. I would definitely go back when with multiple people."
Heather D.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,17,14,1.0,8/1/2015,"First, the calamari came out all burned... I'm surprised the server even brought it out....then when my burger came out. The patty was black! Dry and very bitter... I took one bite and could not eat more! Won't be back again!"
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,3.0,7/8/2014,"Sorry BJ's but after my last two visits, I had to take a star away. I do enjoy the food and it's always consistent so no complaints there. My first complaint is with the order ahead mobile app. I got an email saying I would get $5 off my bill and a free pzookie for trying it so I thought, why not? Apparently you have to inform the hostess once you scan your rewards card up front that you have pre ordered. I was not aware of this and assumed since you do so via your rewards number online that once the computer checked you in the order would become visible to the server. It didn't. After numerous back and fourth we finally had to repeat our order to the server which defeated the entire purpose of ordering ahead so that the kitchen could start our food once we were seated. I will say, the server was nice enough to still give us our discounts but it was annoying all the same. Cut to tonight. I had a craptastic day at work and happened to have a buy one entree get one free coupon so it seemed like a winner. The server was very sweet and had our drinks, food, even appetizers all promptly out in a flash. So far so good, until she cleared our plates and I showed her the email coupon. She told us she would have a manager right on it. 5 minutes goes by still no check. She's taking drink orders, disappearing, coming back with drinks and food for other tables, and now 10 minutes. No check. Mind you the entire time we are sitting there plates gone and empty drinks. She comes by every 4 minutes to apologize and say the manager hasn't taken care of it yet. 15 minutes of waiting and finally the bill. The entire process to get and pay our bill took longer than it did to order and EAT our food.  I wasn't going to originally say anything about the mobile app experience because it's still new and I get that on the first try there are bound to be kinks. But two times in a row of mishaps was the end of the line for me. The whole point of going out and not cooking at home is to avoid hassle and have a relaxing experience. Or not."
Melhaine G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,3.0,3/14/2017,Came in at 9:30 pm waited until 4 people at hostess stand decided who would get family and me.  Didn't say a word just stood there for 5 minutes.  Thinking that I would just walk out.  I think they wanted us to.  Asked the young man that sat us if there was a problem and he said they were trying to figure out who to seat us with.  Poor service from hostess stand . And one of our waiters was a real hick over doing the accent.  Was a little offsetting to us that have a real southern accent.   Was he making fun?   Not sure .  Our waitress was nice .
Michael B.,"Round Rock, TX",4,68,4,2.0,11/11/2015,"I was really expecting more. The building, decor, menu, and beer selection were all impressive. I am a stickler for good service, and tip well but our waitress was flat out miserable. She seemed disinterested overall and annoyed when we asked for water refills. The food was ok. Very very heavy. Not worth the price.  Salad had wilted lettuce. Sandwich had tomatoes that were half green.  I expected more than a typical chain food experience.....but that's what I got.  Overall. This place sucked."
Ingrid B.,"Round Rock, TX",7,16,33,5.0,7/18/2015,"I've been going to BJ's for a long while now! This location is consistent with other locations, and I must comment that I think these restaurants are extremely well run with such consistency and continuity between them and every visit it's hard to find any complaints! The menu is vast, with so many choices it's difficult to decide. Their pizza is my absolute favorite, but I've had so many different foods that are always really tasty. For me, since I can't have gluten, their gf option is so delicious that it doesn't leave me wanting at all, which is beautiful.  The service is friendly and attentive, and even if there is a wait it usually goes quickly. There are tons of tables with a nice assortment of larger tables and two tops as well. It's large and usually has a lot of people in there, but I think the acoustics are great because it's not overly loud at all. Overall, a great place to go for a date, with friends, or with family!!"
Kylee E.,"Hutto, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Went to have a late lunch with my family of six. It was after 2 in the afternoon. There wasn't many people waiting but we waited for longer than the time we were told, granted we were a party of six. Waiter showed up and was very unprofessional. It took him a long time to get our drink order and than he forgot a drink that took over 20 minutes to receive. We received an appetizer of chips and queso which was lackluster. The chips were too greasy and a piece of toasted bread was in the mix. Waiter never asked if we wanted a refill on anything so we had to ask several times which took forever. The salsa we were promised never showed up and when the food finally arrived one dish was missing, which again took forever to receive. And when you have to ask for a refill three times and still it takes 10 minutes to receive, he should have known his tip for service was dwindling. Overall food was decent but service was horrible do we probably won't return for a long time if ever to this location."
Holly P.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,,2.0,1/14/2017,Fries were cold. Mom had spaghetti and meatballs and it was just okay. The garlic roll that came with spaghetti was hard as a rock. Food is overpriced.
James W.,"Austin, TX",4,19,1,1.0,11/26/2016,"So disappointed. Usually we love going to BJs at other locations, but here we only ordered apps and it took 20+ mins to get food, which came out cold. The server was lack luster at best and sort of rude. Like we were a burden. The manager brought our appetizers which were warmer, but certainly NOT worth the $18. The manager didn't seem too concerned about us waiting so long for lackluster product. BJs is a great restaurant, but this location is NOT a flagship."
Amy T.,"Round Rock, TX",259,747,539,3.0,7/9/2012,"Came here Saturday night. We wanted to give them plenty of time to work out their kinks..2 weeks seemed abuot enough ttime. My apt is right around the corner so we kept an eye out for the parking lot to die down.  SERVICE: ATTENTIVE to the point of being ANNOYING. omg bless her heart though she seems show room new ..like 16 yrs old and bright eyed and she seemed super nervous.  FOOD: We ordered a pizza. it was ok. the crust is thicker than I enjoy so the grease sticks to it. It was good though. Lots of toppings. Id go bk and try a different one next time around DRINKS: BEER was pricy. You'd figure since they ""brew their own"" it would be cheaper. nope. $5.75 .. eh.  next time I go i'll get water and grab a six pack of St. Augustine Lawnmower from specs on the way home.  AMBIANCE: its like 40 below zero in there.. so freakin cold..the second we sat down the bf jumped up and offered to grab my sweater from the car.. *i ALWAYS keep a sweater in the car b/c you cant have sleeveless at work... thank goodness.  BAR: very trendy. great for a first date if ur planning.  EXTENSIVE MENU. almost too large.. if youre good at something stick to that.. when you dont have a specialty . . i tend to want to go somewhere else. . b/c now i know odds are whatever you are serving...is frozen. not fresh."
Yuvaraj V.,"Austin, TX",120,264,466,4.0,2/1/2015,"**Please vote below if you like this review** Overtime, I have gotten to like this place. Especially the location and ambiance. It's almost always full of people, it's fun to people watch. It's one of the few ""cool"" sit down options in Round Rock. The lighting is flattering too.  Servers are always friendly. They have happily taken back something if we haven't liked it without scoffs or sighs. Great with managing groups. The bar is awesome. Lots of choices of brewed beer. You can't go wrong. I wish they had half pints though. A pint before a burger/pizza/egg roll is too heavy for me.   I am still not a huge fan of the food, most of the stuff is either cheesy or fried. I'd like I see more healthy options. Appetizers are better than entrees. Not a big fan of deep dish pizza as well. They only have a couple of good veggie options (ceaser salad doesn't count), like the avocado egg rolls and California veggie burger. However, no whole wheat options. Their breads are great but all fully refined flour. Their salads don't hold up in take away. The mini pizooki is nice dessert for two. Try the Ghirardeli chocolate one. They also have buy one get one specials several times a year, that is a steal- don't miss it."
David W.,"Round Rock, TX",0,38,,4.0,12/6/2015,We've enjoyed going to BJ's since it opened.  We hit it the other day and it was only so so at best.  My wife ordered a salad and it was drowning in dressing. We should have sent it back but didn't My Steak was really good but they got the soup orders backwards. My father in law got mine and they corrected it by giving my dad his and me a new bowl.   Their craft beer was good as always.
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,5.0,6/20/2015,"our waitress was excellent in every category. all of our dishes came out hot and perfectly prepared. pepperoni flatbread, salad, clam chowder, southern fried chicken, string beans, cheddar mashed potatoes, turkey club sandwhich, wedge fries. the string beans were steamed thus very crunchy and close to their natural raw state. the cheddar mashed potatoes are great. the gravy for the chicken is very seasoned and flavoraful. the chicken breast was not dried out. everything was excellent."
Cody H.,"Round Rock, TX",203,1,,5.0,3/16/2016,"5 stars to the service, but I was cut off after a beer and half... If have to deal with a manager who's name I believe is Fallon Fryed then might never want to come back again. Rude and looks like she's always having a bad day. Complete turn off to my experience at BJ'S."
Yamasa S.,"Round Rock, TX",0,4,,2.0,11/21/2016,"Yo, came here twice and both times the good was sub par. The first time I was served frozen ravioli. They heated up twice and both time it came out about the same cold temperature. The second time a friend and I shared a pizookie trio and 2/3 were uncooked to the point where you can taste the baking powder. =["
