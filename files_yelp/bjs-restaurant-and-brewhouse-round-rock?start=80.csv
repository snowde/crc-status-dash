Ashley C.,"Pflugerville, TX",36,177,70,4.0,4/5/2016,"The service was great, however the the mushroom burger was not that great.  My kids loved their meals and we ordered a cookie pie dessert thinv and it was out of this world.  This may be our new dessert location."
John V.,"Austin, TX",39,104,31,5.0,1/21/2016,Went with a co worker and enjoyed the food and service.  The waiter gave recommendations on beer to try.  I first wanted a beer and be advised me not to get it.  Then I ordered another beer and he brought a sample of what I wanted before and I'm glad I picked different.
Jake R.,"Round Rock, TX",0,52,18,4.0,4/18/2016,The service is hit or miss at BJ's. The foods always good but we've had multiple issues of food being brought out incorrectly. The pazookies are amazing.
Dustin S.,"Round Rock, TX",67,7,1,1.0,2/16/2016,Absolutely awful. Got a couple entrees to go tonight. Got a medium steak and it was RAW. We also got another dish that was so spicy it was inedible. I don't know if the cap popped off on the cayenne shaker. We live around the corner and won't be back. The bartender wasn't helpful either.
Michael L.,"Round Rock, TX",0,16,,1.0,5/31/2016,Ordered ribeye and mashed potatoes with asparagus. Meal was terrible  I will not go back.
David S.,"Round Rock, TX",11,3,6,5.0,6/24/2014,"Been here many times. Love the house crafted beers. It's a tops up between the Jeremiah Red and the Brewhouse Blonde. If you can't decide on one, their taster option is the way to go. Especially if you are looking to try something new.  One of the good things about BJs is you can either dress up or go casual. Great place for drinks after work or meeting with friends before heading out on the town.  The menu has many offerings sure to please anyone. I've never walked away unsatisfied."
Amanda M.,"Temecula, CA",0,31,5,1.0,10/12/2015,Horrid service. Food came out wrong. Some got their food & were finished eating before others received their meal. Burger tasted like bad fish.
Marty J.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",199,95,302,4.0,2/6/2015,"Eat Here! Amazing selection, there is something for everyone. Great, great! Service! From hostess to server, very tentative. As expected, an excellent beer selection. This place does not disappoint. eat here."
Ryan S.,"Austin, TX",7,3,3,5.0,1/11/2015,We recently had our holiday party at the end of December at BJ's in Round Rock! Everyone had a great time and our waitress Erin was top notch!  She checked in with us at the right times to make sure everyone is doing ok!   The food selection and portion sizes were perfect!  We definitely recommend BJ's and their pazookie desserts!! We will definitely be returning!  Great atmosphere!  Continue taking care of your guests!
Mike V.,"Round Rock, TX",154,137,1672,2.0,5/2/2013,"Went to this location for a lunch meeting yesterday. Overall, I was pretty disappointed. I'm giving 2 stars and not one, because the food wasn't bad, however,  the service was horrible!  Got there about 1:30, so the main lunch rush was over, and it wasn't really that busy. Our server was polite, but I should have known that the experience was going to be ""different"" when she asked if any of us had been to BJ's before. Two of us had, but the other one hasn't been to BJ's before. Her comment after that was ""We have good pizza, burgers, and beer, so you will be safe if you order that!"" WHAT???!!!---Or should I say WOW? After ordering drinks, we ordered 2 appetizers, the Pot stickers, and Chips and salsa. Our server stated she would put the order in, and come back to take our order- pretty routine. About 25 minutes later, she returned to take our order. We ordered and inquired about the appetizers. She assured us that they would be out in a minute. Another 10 minutes or so, and the pot stickers came out.(which were tasty, by the way) We asked about the chips and salsa. Her response was, ""oh, do you still want them?"" Ummmmm, yes, we still do, seeing as how we ordered them, and inquired  about them!  2 minutes later our lunch arrived. We all just ate in silence, probably because we were embarrassed for our server, who was noticeably screwing up all of the other table's orders in her section as well.  Needless to say, the chips and salsa never arrived, and it took a whole 25 more minutes to get the ""manager"" to take the appetizer off of the bill.  I like BJ's food and beer, but the total service experience is a turn-off! These people need some customer service training, BIG TIME!!!"
Teresa R.,"Georgetown, TX",0,8,,1.0,7/17/2016,Service was awful. Used to be one of our favorite places but this was our second time with awful service. Took 20 minutes before someone came to take our drink order.
Jason M.,"Killeen, TX",115,66,67,5.0,1/20/2015,This place was a stop me and my fellow bikers stopped at for the first time. Service was amazing and manager is a outstanding individual. When we wolf up to the building after parking our bikes out front a patron (old lady) fell over and busted her head wide open. One of my bike buddies is a medic in the U.S. Army and provided her professional medical attention.  The manager took half the cost of each of our bills. It was 7 of us. He didn't have to but he did. The waitress was quite nice and service was quick as possible due to to it being slightly busy. She was professional and always asked us if we needed anything. She quickly and on her own refilled our drinks. Food was definitely reasonably priced. Taste was great and portions were extremely satisfying. I would definitely recommend this place and much respect to the staff and manager. Thanks guys and you'll see me and my Motorcycle Club again.
Kyle B.,"Manor, TX",12,16,,3.0,8/23/2015,"We ordered salads for take out. They apparently have a glitch in their online ordering system. For both salads we removed the bleu cheese. On one salad we added avocado. When the salads got home both salads have bleu cheese and neither had avocado. Additionally - both salads were supposed to have ranch and one had bleu cheese.  I called the store and they stated the order did not state ""no bleu cheese."" On the ordering page where you can customize we had both removed the bleu cheese from our salads and left on the jack cheese (b/c it was supposed to come with both). There was nowhere to put the actual words ""no bleu cheese.""  BJ's - I suggest you fix this issue for your online ordering. We just brought home two salads that are now a waste and being thrown away. If someone unclicks an ingredient it should show up on the order as ""no ____________.""  Thank you."
Mark K.,"Leander, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/31/2014,My girlfriend and I eat here regularly due to our love for specific dishes.  We're rewards members.  However the service at this location is consistantly some of the worst I've ever experienced anywhere. I kid you not.  In our last ten visits.  At least one of several things happened on eight of them.  Our appetizer would arrive several minutes after our entrees.  One or both of our entrees would be wrong.  Drinks are wrong.  Ask for drinks to go before receiving the check.  Pay the check and continue to wait another 20 minutes while reminding our server multiple times and still never receive the to go drinks before we give up and leave. If the food wasn't as good as it is (when it's correct).  We would likely never come back to this location.  The few times we've spoken to management.  They've rectified the issues for that specific visit but we continue to have consistant problems.
Hailey L.,"Gilmer, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/26/2014,"Worst restaurant I've ever been to. Can I give it -5 stars? First of all, the waiter was incredibly rude. My party of four was still looking at the drink menu when the waiter came for our drink orders. We hesitated for all of five seconds, then he said, ""I'll just bring you all waters to start with."" So impatient. More importantly, the food was disgusting. I ordered a sirloin steak and it was the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. It BURNED because it was so salty. So salty the Mormons tried to settle on it. So salty that if you put a snail on it, it would DIE. It was saltier than an actual BJ. Two of my friends ordered pasta and it was still crunchy. I've never had to complain about my food at a restaurant, so having to get my meal comped was extremely unpleasant. Three of us got sick from the restaurant. Let me rephrase that; we paid money for diarrea. Eat here at your own risk."
Leo Q.,"Round Rock, TX",2,45,,2.0,9/27/2015,"Well, I've given them two more shots in the last couple of months and they continue to disappoint.  It is now clear to me that the management of the BJ's in Round Rock is simply not interested in making things better.   Service is really slow, follow-up is poor, and waiters continue to disappear for long periods of time.  Once again, I witnessed more than one table around me complain, return food, and be visited by the manager for an apology.  Why do I keep going back?  Well the beer selection is good, there are food items I like and I really want to see them be as good as other BJ's.  I think I finally reached my limit and may go a few months before I try again ... bummer!"
Gary O.,"Round Rock, TX",70,150,90,5.0,8/25/2014,"Pretty solid place for a big chain. Recurrent problems with to-go orders seem to be resolved. Nice variety of food and beers. Decent service. I go here more often than I do most local chain outlets. Bike parking all the way in back. Acoustics mean it can be kinda loud, not the best place for quiet conversation except perhaps during off hours."
Jere W.,"Round Rock, TX",62,17,15,4.0,7/27/2014,"This was our first time and not our last. I enjoyed a good burger which had a wonderfully soft and flavorful bun. A good bun is quintessential for a burger. It's like having cream without the ice. The decor was a step above standard chain restaurants. I did enjoy their selection of house brews. The porter was a even balance of toast and malt. Our server was young and new, but very pleasant and attentive. Not a bad option for a casual dinner out."
Katy B.,"Round Rock, TX",0,6,5,5.0,1/6/2015,"We had lunch here on Sunday, the 4th of January. We were seated quickly and our waiter (Ian) came to our table within a few seconds after being seated even if the restaurant was pretty busy. We got an appetizer and ordered. I'm usually very attentive to the cleanliness of the table and seats when we go somewhere, and you know how some restaurant have a bit of a film of grease on the table or chairs? Well not here, everything is clean, the ambiance is pleasant and the noise is acceptable. The only grievance I have is that we had to wait a bit for our food even though by that time there were fewer customers but thankfully my 2 year old was pretty patient (you wouldn't believe how 10 extra minutes matter with a toddler). Ian apologized and carried out as attentive as before. Bottom line, we liked our food, our server and the restaurant."
Phillip B.,"Austin, TX",610,700,9102,4.0,10/1/2012,"I love BJ's!  Who doesn't?  I love the vast selection of beers and the hot wait staff!  Ok, if you're gonna name your restaurant something sexually perverted, then expect pervs like me to play on it.  Mr, Hot Waiter asks:  ""What'll you have, sir?""  I so wanna reply:  ""The BJ with a complimentary spank on the ass!"".  Instead, I order the roasted veggie and goat cheese flat bread with a salad.  Very freaking delicious!  The veggies weren't over roasted and the goat cheese made the flavors come together.  Not too much basil pesto and the crust was perfect.  Oh man I love BJ's!  Hmmm.  I need a nap!!!"
