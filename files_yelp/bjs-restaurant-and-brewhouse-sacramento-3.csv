EMilio R.,"Sacramento, CA",705,78,3586,5.0,12/28/2017,"A couple of hiccups that really worked out to my benefit in the end so you'll hear no complaints from me.  LOCATION: Inside the Arden mall to the left of the main entrance between forever 21 and seasons 52. DECOR: Now, I'm not a huge fan of BJ's Decor choices simply because everything is too shiny. The wood on the tables is too shiny to take pictures of the food properly. The lights are bright and some places and dark and others. It's weird. I just don't care for it. Probably because it's commercial and standard. FOOD: I had the Twisted BLT salad and the chicken tortilla soup for their lunch special. Everyday you can get unlimited soup and salad for $9.95 from about 11-3pm. STAFF: All chill and super nice. I never had to wait for my salad or soup. The salad and soup even came out before my mixed drink at the bar, but that's probably because the kitchen is real fast. I mean it was just salad and soup, but staff still gets the win on this one. EXPERIENCE: Everything was going great. I walk in bar seating is full so I wait maybe 7 minutes for a table to open up on the floor and am escorted by a host to sit in a booth. Now, the host had mentioned their mobile app and customer loyalty deal going on through the holidays which promised a free Pizookie with your first time use of the app. The Pizookie was one of the reasons I came here with my girlfriend who swears up and down that the Pizookie is to die for. I'm not much for sweets, but the few things I do like are chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream so when these two things makeup the Pizookie, I already knew it was a win. And it was free?! Oh you know your boy got down on that, but not before there were issues with the mobile app. We try to put in the discount code for our Pizookie and pay through the app, but the app will not update our order so all it showed was the price for the two free pizookies and none of the other stuff we ordered. So after some troubleshooting with our waitress we finally get the manager over and it's the same thing. The apps not working, we cannot pay and we have been here longer than we had planned for. That's when the manager makes the best decision he could have made and gives us our meal for free for all the hassle and that, my friends, was a good day. -- @theMilsEdition"
Jessamine J.,"Sacramento, CA",501,86,67,5.0,12/19/2017,"This restaurant is located in the Arden Fair Mall, close to my work. Love coming here, great ambiance. Extremely consistent and great quality of beer on tap. (they make their own beer, which is also a plus).  Food: I have come here for both Happy Hour and dinner/lunch time. Like your typical BJ's, the pizza, wings, and burgers never fail. I've always had a great experience here and have been satisfied with my meals.  Parking: It's in a mall -- so it could be a hit or miss depending on the time of the year.  Service: Getting seated at this place can range anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour and a half. This place is extremely popular. I would highly suggest leaving earlier if you plan to go during dinner time. Lunch time and happy hour are not as hectic. I usually come during these times and have gotten seated within 20 minutes.  Overall, I will come here again and again. I like the food, I like the service,   and the bathrooms are always clean and updated."
Michael T.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,11,4,2.0,12/14/2017,"This is a busy place to eat dinner. I guess due to holiday shoppers, it's busier than usual. My wait was 50 minutes both times I've been here. The food is ""ok"", but better than the other options in the mall. There are plenty of choices on the menu and the staff is polite. I'm visiting from out of state and someone recommended it as a quick meal.  Overall, this place rates up there with Cheese Cake Factory or Chilli's. Not bad, but not great. I waited 5 min for my drink and 30 minutes for my deepdish pizza, which arrived luke warm. At least the waitress was pleasant when I sent it back to be reheated."
Heike S.,"Sacramento, CA",30,108,67,3.0,11/11/2017,"It has been years since I have been here, but a friend and I wanted snacks and cocktails so we decided BJ's would be fine. That was a mistake, especially on a Friday night. You need to be prepared. The line to check in was pretty long, and we got up it was a 90 minute wait for two of us. There was no room at the bar so we decided to walk around the mall and get a coffee. Literally the moment We sat down with our coffee, I get a text that the table is ready.   We ended up ordering one combo appetizer plate and hickory smoked sausage, as well as margaritas. The margaritas were great! The appetizers on the other hand, lacked flavor. Nothing had a distinct seasoning. The hickory smoked sausage came out cold and we sent it back to be reheated. My synopsis: come here for margaritas. Or beer. The two of us spent about $75 for 2 margharita each and appetizers. That's fairly pricey. Ambiance is very loud. Our server was nice, but when he went on break his replacement constantly came to the table to ask if we needed anything, To the point where I feel he wanted us to clear the table and leave. P.S Mall parking is already holiday crazy."
Makaela M.,"Sacramento, CA",330,58,42,4.0,11/17/2017,"The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 were the front ladies. When we put down our names down and she told us the wait time (45 minutes) my friends and I were debating if we should stay or go else where. While decided she gave us a dirty look and was not welcoming. She also didn't greet any of us. She didn't seem like she was enjoying her job HOWEVER OUR WAITER TONY WAS AMAZING! This guy was so happy to take our order, give suggestions, talk to us about the menu and our day.  I usually don't remember waiters names but definitely remembered his.  The food was great as well. I recommend the Parmesan chicken"
Lisa V.,"Sacramento, CA",33,182,398,4.0,12/9/2017,"bj is one of those places where its good when you particularly dont have a certain craving but theres a big menu so you will find one.  lunch specials are great in price and they now offer daily deals. this being on a thursday was ribs for almost half off with a soup or salad, two sides, AND mini pizookie. score!"
Rumeet R.,"Woodland, CA",18,30,18,1.0,11/27/2017,Fingers crossed I don't get food poisoning.  Such a disappointment.  The customer service was great for the food has definitely gone down hill.  I'm so grossed out.. the chicken was extremely undercooked.  I'll let you refer to the picture.. goodluck if you decide to eat here.  They did return my money but.. was it really worth it.
Christopher C.,"Sacramento, CA",1351,722,1078,4.0,10/7/2017,Decent lunch for a decent price.  I was not too happy with the wedge salad I ordered which for some reason the kitchen thought it would be funny to put so much dressing on that the waitress asked me if I would like another plate to eat it; ridiculous.  Not sure I will be back.  This could have easily been a lower 3-star review and only the quality of the pizza I had ordered made up for the kitchen silliness.  Service was average and absent.  The waitress was too busy to pay attention to simple requests.   Seen better but try for yourself; not sure I will be back as there are other choices right next door.  Ask for dressing on the side for sure!
Henry L.,"San Mateo, CA",2336,833,2811,5.0,6/26/2017,"Nice restaurant! Located right in the Arden mall, this place is actually pretty nice. The wait is not long--there are lots of seats and they are just the right amount to fit all the customers. Other BJ's I've been to have 1+ hr wait. The food is good. We got the burger and the seared tuna salad. The seared tuna salad tasted fresh, especially the tuna which was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The salad was dressed well. The burger was awsome too, especially the bun which was toasted just right. The beef patty had a smokey bbq flavor, as did the bacon. The fries were think but also crispy. Overall, tastes like just how I'd imagine a summer BBQ would be :) The serve staff are all very nice, and very knowledgeable. I asked about how the different kinds of burgers were different even though on paper they looked the same, and the serve staff explained everything well. When I chose a burger, the staff actually pointed out a cheaper item that is the same burger, just worded differently. Overall, this is a really nice BJ restaurant, compared to other ones I've been to! Nice!"
Tony S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,43,25,1.0,1/8/2018,What this issue about hostess showing a bad attitude? Walked in for lunch asked to be seated in certain area and changed our mind to a different booth she rolls her eyes while shaking her head. Hey BJs Management HOST staff is the 1st customer contact in  Restaurant should hire more courteous host staff otherwise just like we are getting up and going to another place for lunch so must others.
Joe R.,"Sacramento, CA",14,82,166,4.0,6/20/2017,"BJs is a great chain restaurant to come to. I've being going to BJs for years and the food and drinks, food, and pizookie are always pretty much the same, the service is really what makes the difference. The only reason why I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because of the location. It's at the mall, parking is awful, and it gets pretty packed. Other than that my experience here was great.  Service - the service was good. We luckily were able to snag a table in the bar area since the place was so packed. our waiter was very attentive. He even made recommendations for drinks and pizookie flavors.  Drinks - there are a wide variety of beers on tap, wine, and specialty cocktails! My personal favorite is the Jeremiah red! It's malty and has a pretty high alcohol content for a beer.  Food - there is a wide variety of American foods ranging from pizzas, burgers, flat breads, steak, and pastas. Pizzas and burgers are always a solid choice when coming to a BJs.  For an appetizer, we ordered a small bites trio or couscous Mac and cheese, garlic Parmesan carrots, and ginger creamed corn. And let me say OMG get the couscous Mac and cheese! 'Nuff said! For my main entree, I ordered the jalapeño burger which was great! I'm not too keen on spiciness, but this was a manageable spicy. The heat went away and it wasn't one of those long lasting spiciness.  Dessert - PIZOOKIs! We got the trio sampler with the triple chocolate pizookie, salted caramel pizookie, and the monkey bread pizookie. The triple chocolate was a little too chocolatey, but it's in the name. The salted caramel is my favorite and will always recommend it!"
Sarah R.,"Sacramento, CA",12,5,1,2.0,1/1/2018,"I have been to this location several times and never had any issues and the staff has always been nice. Until tonight. I walked in and the host didn't even say hello. I said hi and told him a table for 3. I also asked if I could get a booth. My 3yo son won't sit in a high chair and I can't safely have him sit on a chair. The host looked irritated by my request and said ""as of right now. No"" I said okay that's fine and explained to him the reason I can't sit at a normal table. He seemed irritated by my presence from the beginning. But the other host sat us right away. No wait. And there were plenty of booths available. I work in customer service and have worked in the hospitality industry. The way the host mad me feel for just walking in was not okay. He was a dick."
Rebecca J.,"Monterey Park, CA",3,240,2,1.0,11/15/2017,"This used to be the spot for me to grab a bite after a shopping sesh but the last five times I've been here have been far from great. Today was it for me, and not the good kinda it. More evil like IT, the clown.  We arrived. Wait was supposed to be 25 mins. No Biggy since most wait at any BJs fall within the 20-50 min range.  Twenty mins in, the host told us there's a booth available and that we better run before it gets taken. Not sure why she said that because there were two booths available. Guessing she was just lazy and didn't want to walk us there, so we ended up menu-less for about 20 mins.  We were able to order a drink and an appetizer. 15 mins later the appetizer comes out and our server was still nowhere to be found. We had to get someone to call him.  Once we got his attention, I asked if we could please get the check because the service and the wait was beyond mediocre. We were starving! Took him five mins to bring us the check, which he rudely dropped off at our table. Another five mins later, He then asked us if we were going to eat it. We said no, box please. Then he started with an attitude on whether or not we wanted to speak with the manager, as if we were offending him. We weren't. We just wanted to leave to go eat somewhere more efficient.  Even with that, it took him another five mins to bring back our change and then another three for the box. Strange thing to do when you know someone wants to GTF out.  Yeah, so no more BJs at Arden for me. Ended up at Applebee's which I don't even like at all, but at least the service is way better."
Tmo457 W.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,50,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Ate here with my gf, ordered avacado rolls and  2 pazookies. And 2 beers. My beer had a black thing floating in it. Avacado rolls were cut improperly, instead of a slant cut to make the presentation they were side cut and flopped all over, in addition the avocado rolls were all avocados and had no cream cheese. They were also under cooked and taken out before the 4 minutes time needed. They were soggy. Sent them back and they came back the exact same so we had those removed from bill. The tamarind sauce was correct. Both pazookies were under cooked in the center and had raw cookie dough flavor and appearance. The the icw cream was good. Service by the one waiter who apparently had 19 tables was the worst service i have had in several years. The guy was nice but extremely slow. We spent two hours waiting for everything and it ruined the experience. This bjs location is lacking"
Jasmit D.,"Livermore, CA",5,75,53,5.0,11/24/2017,"We came here on 11/18/2017 after my Graduation. There was a party of 15. We were seated within a good amount of time, and our two servers were Lexy and Michael, and boy were they great! Lexy was so polite and had a smile on her face the whole time. I would notice her talking to other tables as well, and with same, vibrant smile. Michael was also really good. Great customer service to the both of them. They handled our party very well, they were courteous, good on time, prompt, fast, thorough.  I would love to have these server every time to take care of a big party like that! our food was given on time, tasted wonderful!  Thanks Lexy and Michael for making my special day even better."
Chuck M.,"Rocklin, CA",296,221,2080,3.0,2/27/2017,"With chain restaurants you typically know what to expect. What's on the menu, quality of food, service, etc. BJ'S seems to be an exception to this in some regards. Dined here on two consecutive evenings recently with two different experiences. The first evening I was given an estimate of 5-10 minutes for a table but the actual wait ended up being about 30 minutes. Service on both evenings was spotty with drink refills slow on the first night and non-existent on the second.  I've also found that the quality of food varies surprisingly from location to location. In the greater Sacramento area, Roseville is tops, Natomas is at the bottom (got sick eating there), and Arden is somewhere in the middle. In regards to meat, be aware that medium = well done. On my second night eating here, once I informed my server that my table was just having dessert (having already eaten dinner at a restaurant down the street), she quickly became short. Once the order was placed she did not return to check on us again. I couldn't finish the sweet and salty dessert due to water running dry.  Don't know that I'll go to this particular BJ'S again. I'll probably stick to the Roseville BJ's where everything is consistently above average."
Matt C.,"Bellflower, CA",297,224,320,5.0,2/4/2017,"We were at the mall waiting for a custom T-Shirt to be made. We were just walking around - killing time - when we happened upon the BJ's Restaurant. I am a fan of BJ's Restaurants. We are regulars at the one in Downey in Southern California. Tuesdays are the best days there because they have Half Price Wine - ALL DAY. But anyway we walked in and bellied up to the bar. We were greeted within seconds by a pleasant and cheery Bartender by the name of Rachael. We chatted briefly and she took our beverage order. Rachael recommended the Piranha Pale Ale for me and my friend had some berry flavored cider drink. Our beverages were promptly served. The beer was nicely chilled and very tasty. Not too hoppy - just like she said.  She returned within a couple of minutes to offer us some food - which we declined. We just stopped in for a beverage. She was busily performing her BT duties but managed to spend a couple minutes here and there having conversation with us. Whilst sitting there we met a very nice gentleman named Jonathon. He was a guest at the bar as well. We had a great conversation about two of my favorite topics - Corvettes and driving. So Rachael was great, the beer was great, the conversation was great. The restaurant was not busy but was very clean including the restrooms. What more can a guy ask for? Jonathon - If you read this, it really was a pleasure meeting you."
Diane J.,"Cardiff by the Sea, CA",25,81,,3.0,11/9/2017,"We sat in the training section and our server was a bit confused about the soup and salad option.  Once that was sorted out, it was just a matter of waiting for my food.  The salad came straight away.  The soup... didn't.  I was there with my boss, who ordered wings and a pizza and had finished eating before my soup finally arrived.  Turned out the kitchen needed to make a new batch of Broccoli Cheddar.  Had they told me that from the beginning, I may have opted for something different.  The real frustration was that the broccoli was still ice cold.  It was just a matter of stirring it into the cheese, which was appropriately heated, but it seemed like they should've done that in the kitchen.  Still, it was clear that the server was trying to make me happy,  my boss really liked his food and in the end, I did enjoy my order.  All's well that ends well."
Lyn G.,"Sacramento, CA",106,119,88,4.0,3/26/2017,"Have always liked BJ'S and have never been really disappointed with food or service. Of course, it's usually a wait to be seated, a wait for service, but that's what's to be expected.  Food and service is always good.  This visit we both had the rib eye steak with cheddar mashed potatoes and fulfilled asparagus. It was so good! Steak was juicy and flavorful, mashed potatoes were creamy and you could taste the delicious cheese, and asparagus (huge serving) were seasoned perfectly. This by far was the best meal I had at BJ'S! I highly recommend trying it!"
Ken L.,"Northern California, CA",229,138,2124,4.0,7/5/2017,"The food was good, but was surprised it took a little longer than expected since there weren't hardly any one in the restaurant. The waitress was nice and made sure I was happy and apologized for the food delay so that made up for waiting a bit on the food. This is a great place to stop for a bite when at the mall."
A M.,"Carmichael, CA",0,20,25,4.0,11/26/2017,"I love this place, nice & professional service, food is fresh and the menu ..... so various!! Coming back definitely!!"
Jen B.,"Sacramento, CA",44,54,6,1.0,11/11/2017,"Just went here to honor my late father-in-laws birthday.  Waited over 5 minutes for the table to be bussed, finally approached a group of 4 waitresses that were talking about going out plans. I asked if the table could be bussed and they said, ""there is like only one busses here now sooooo..."". They look at me, dumb eyed and far too comfortable in their service position to clean a table. They then watched as I made 4 trips to buss the table myself. They never offered to help or did any actual work.  The actual service was painfully slow. We ended up leaving before our celebratory beer or birthday cookie arrived.  What was total bullshit is even though we weren't getting service and I saw other tables give up, there was no shortage of staff just leaning on walls chitchatting.  Don't waste your time here."
Stephanie A.,"Plantation, FL",67,36,128,5.0,7/19/2017,"One of my favourite restaurants! I literally visit all the time. The  menu is so diverse and they're is always something for everyone. Great happy hour deals and specials. I joined the membership and there are always great perks available. Btw, everything I have eaten there has been delicious. Not a single complaint!"
Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2129,5344,4760,3.0,5/27/2017,"I recently ended up at this BJ's for Dinner one night. I was staying at the nearby Hilton, who kindly dropped me off here via their shuttle service. Otherwise, there was no way I was walking here, unless I wanted to end up as a pedestrian casualty. When I entered, the place was busy, happy, and noisy. I wasn't big on the noise, but there was a nice table available, and the service was friendly, helpful, and prompt throughout. The food and the beer (I had a red ale) were just OK. I had some sort of ""healthy"" stir fry dish, that probably wasn't all that good for me. The menu gives you the calories of everything, which ended up causing menu choice paralysis and choosing the best of the worst. The noise added to this confusion, which is why I wanted out of this place post haste. But just because this wasn't my thing, doesn't mean all of my happy fellow diners weren't a little more positive about their experiences."
Lsxo S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,92,61,5.0,11/13/2017,"Took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner. And I must say, everything was so good. And the server was very attentive. I will defiantly be back again."
Janelle M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",4349,597,3618,4.0,11/2/2016,"I stopped by BJ's for dinner with my honey.  I downloaded the BJ's app and I must say I app is great! I like the fact you can reserve a time to dine in or pick up and once you check in at the front they state making your order immediately! In this case we dined in. We were greeted seated and 5 mins later our appetizers came out.  I ordered the BLT salad and my honey ordered the Potato skins. I really enjoyed the salad the bacon was crispy and the dressing was delicious. 15 mins later out 2 pizzas came out I ordered the Chicken Philly Pizza it was different yet good they use a Sriracha cheese sauce  in place of tomato sauce. The veggies on it was so greedy as well and had great flavor. The second Pizza was half Great White and Chicken Bacon Ranch. The great white was okay nothing special but, the Chicken Bacon Ranch had to be my absolute favorite. The pizza was nice and crispy and had lots of flavor down to the crust having great flavor that the other Pizzas lacked.  For the restaurant to be as busy as it was our waiter was still very attentive and made sure or refills of water never totally empty. Next time I'm going to check out BJ's for there happy hour drinks and eats. They also have a nice full bar with plenty of TV's to watch the game which is a huge plus. I, also liked that I could pay my bill from my cellphone, so very convenient!"
Kiarra G.,"Sacramento, CA",225,74,71,2.0,9/27/2017,"I frequent bj's often, but this particular visit was distasteful and I left feeling very dissatisfied. If I ever have to express my concern I usually do so in store but this day I was so worn out from work that I didn't have the time or energy being that it was later in the evening, Our server was named Patricia and she was cold, rude, and seemed as if we were bugging her. We ordered an appetizer, pizza, and pizookie. The appetizer was delish, but when our pizza came I noticed it had tomatoes  which we asked to be excluded. As soon as I mentioned it to her she grabbed the pizza, rolled her eyes, and didn't say one word, no apology, no ""I will be right back,"" nothing. After about 15-20 mins (which was expected since we figured they would have to make a new pizza) she returned with the same pizza and it was obvious that they only removed the tomatoes instead of making a new one.....it was cold and dry as if it was sitting in a warmer. Again I didn't complain, but when she never returned to ask how we were doing that is where my issue is, we were without water and needed refills but she was no where to be found, and I also noted she only had 2 other tables. Finally when she returned she brought us a box and we ordered dessert. It look 18 minutes for our pizookie to come out! The table next to us had ordered and received  their food before our dessert even came out! Once we got up and asked for the check she ran our credit card at the table and said she would return with the receipt. We watched her go talk to other workers, hug a friend that came in and chat at the micro before returning with our credit card slip! My biggest problem is that she never apologized for the wait or the mess up (I checked the receipt and she had put in our pizza incorrectly), she never came back to check on us, then she didn't even thank us when she dropped of the check."
Corie L.,"Burbank, CA",424,391,689,4.0,6/12/2017,Came here for lunch and ordered a small meal since I didn't want leftovers afterwards. I did end up having trouble finishing my food so I had my coworker eat it.  BJs is a chain so it's nice their standard is kept the same through out all their restaurants.
'Johnson R. H.,"San Jose, CA",271,12,57,5.0,5/8/2017,"ATTENDEES & SITUATION: The service was on point. There were several big parties and they did not skip a beat. We were part of a volleyball tournament near the Cal Expo Center. Apparently, there was a prom near by and they, as well, had many parties as well. I arrived later to my party of 24 guest. Our tables were split between the parents & adults and girls volleyball players. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and pizza. I was never with an empty glass. Our server kept the refills coming. I can't imagine I how many other other glasses he had to tend to. They were all dressed clean and looked very proper to serve. All our food came in a timely manner and just about the same time for each person. Our table was tended by several servers and each and everyone of them handled all our special request regardless if it was their main table; more refills, extra plates, more dressing, milk, utensils, etc. This was the most impressive thing, great customer service. FOOD: The only challenge we had was the 5 Meat Pizza I ordered. It was a bit on the salty for my taste. It could of been caused by the bacon. But it was still hot and fine to eat. EXTRA: Aside the food, we were able to serve a cake specially made by one of the parents. The servers even provided plates and forks for us. With all the big parties there, the table configuration still gave us ample room to surround the birthday girl and sing happy birthday to her.​ At the end, when the bill came, they were able to split the bill and pair them up with each parent & child. Talk about a juggling act! On point!! ALL-IN-ALL: I would definitely recommend and suggest BJ's Restaurant when in town again. Food was hot, world class customer service. Great Experience!!"
Winston W.,"Sacramento County, CA",4,200,2,2.0,11/30/2017,The decor is 4 stars. Their baby back ribs are no more than 2. I enjoyed being in the restaurant until the food arrived. Dry & crunchy all the way through to the bone. I'll come again but not for the baby backs.
Diana H.,"Zephyr Cove, NV",312,132,428,4.0,2/21/2017,"I've been to many BJ's across west of the US. This one is at the Arden Mall in Sacramento. Great location. Quick and no fuss service. Just exactly what we needed today.. The derby Cobb salad was excellent with very good house made avocado dressing. My husband had 12 oz rib eye with Brussel sprouts and asparagus. Cooked to medium temp, perfect. Both dishes perfectly gluten free and paleo. The place was getting packed before noon. Good sign.  Clean and good environment. Definitely on the list to return if in the area."
Vincent V.,"Chico, CA",16,266,5,3.0,9/26/2017,"On the pricier side, but the service was very friendly and prompt for how packed it is. The quality isn't worth the price you pay, and the portions aren't much either. However, it is at the Arden-Arcade Mall so you can always go shopping to burn those calories afterwards. The staff were extremely friendly and they gave our good friend a birthday present (forgot the name of their signature desert). I can see BJs here as a go-to spot for celebration."
Shelby G.,"Elk Grove, CA",11,160,44,4.0,3/11/2017,"My daughter and I had lunch at BJ's this past Wednesday; we were there to celebrate my birthday. I opted for the fettuccine Alfredo which had chicken and broccoli in it. I had a side size Cesar salad.  Because it was my birthday we could have had the ginormous chocolate cookie with ice cream; we were too full and passed on dessert. No matter which BJ's I visit and have a meal, the food is consistently good. This location didn't disappoint. I love the Cesar salad, as does my daughter.  Although I normally get a sandwich or fish and chips, I opted for the lunch size pasta. It was really very good. The broccoli was exceptional.  Good customer service, reasonable pricing, great menu selections and consistently good food.  My daughter and I will continue to have lunch at BJ's."
Matt Z.,"Aurora, CO",0,23,,1.0,12/10/2017,Um.. Wow. Pretty disappointing. The beers they brew are pretty average and nothing really captivating. I had 4 different type's and still searched for something to drink. We ordered the garlic wings and a pizza. I'm pretty sure the wings came out unsauced...maybe not... I've never had unsauced and uncheesed pizza before. I picked the slice up and every ingredient fell off. I was left with dough. Don't waste your money. There are plenty of other great places to eat in the area.
Michael C.,"Irvine, CA",479,59,89,1.0,1/18/2017,"This place makes me sick, and I mean literally. The staff were extremely helpful and nice, but holy hell did I have a problem with their food today.  I was pretty crunched on time today since I had to drop off my iPhone at the Apple Store for a battery replacement and then had to go back to work immediately after. I looked up some restaurants at the mall and decided, ""Hey, why NOT go to BJ's?""  Well, today's visit answered that question pretty clearly. I was helped pretty promptly by one of the folks at the take-out counter, and she offered a few suggestions. I eventually decided on the Bacon Cheeseburger and the Potstickers to bring back to the office to eat. I ordered the food and made my way over to the Apple Store while I waited on my food. By the time I dropped off my phone, the food was ready and I gave my thanks and departed to work.  I gave the potstickers to my co-worker as I ate the bacon cheeseburger while I was working. About half-way through, I looked at the burger and realized I made a huge mistake. The inside of the burger was not cooked at all. I've had my fair share of medium-rare burgers in my day, and this was not that. After work, I made my way back to Arden Fair to pick up my iPhone and made a stop at BJ's again before I left. I brought the remains of the burger and showed it to a different person at the take-out counter and she said, ""Yeah! Medium-rare is supposed to be undercooked like that!"" That's when I took inspiration from my hero, Gordon Ramsay, and used my hands and opened up that patty to reveal the insides. She got the manager, and I asked very specifically whether the medium-rare burgers were supposed to look like that, and he agreed that many parts of the patty appeared uncooked. He took down my name, phone number, and e-mail to get a voucher for a replacement burger. (I was sent a $25 gift voucher from BJ's) I'm not sure whether I'll take them up on their offer for another burger; I haven't even gotten the voucher yet, but if it's going to make me feel nauseous again, no thank you."

My friend and I came in on a busy dinner weekend and we got served in about 15 min when they said the wait would be 30. The server came right away to get our drinks and the food took about 7-10min to come. I've tried many things on their menu including pasta, pizza, flat bread and clam chowder bowl. And my favorite desert that I would get every time is the Pizooki. Price is reasonable, portion is big and quality is delicious.  Tony, who took our order, was pleasant and fast. He even took off the $2.75 on my chowder bowl because I mistook the price I was paying for. I give BJ a five star for that. BJ is definitely the place I'd come back over and over again when I'm at Arden Fair Mall."

Ashley H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,7,2.0,11/29/2017,I love Bjs...however they have the WORST large party policies EVER. I tried making reservations a week in advance for a large party however the manager stated that they couldn't make reservations from 6pm to 8pm. Then he told me to call ahead that night. Well now there new policy is call ahead can only be a party of 6. So they won't put me on the call ahead list. I just want to eat with my family of 10. Thats it. Its ridiculous. Please change the ridiculous large party policies!

Opened the lid and it looked like someone poured pizza grease from an extra large pizza into my cup. I ran in for an exchange, got a new soup and came back to my car... same thing. Half greasy oil/ half soup. I did end up calling the manager who offered a refund, which I appreciated."
Brittany B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",165,35,,5.0,12/2/2017,"1st visit in to this location and a pleasant experience! We have dined at several BJ's and have received bad service, good service, and everything in between. Cynthia M. was our waitress and she was wonderful. She was very accommodating and friendly. The food was good as always but our night wouldn't have been as enjoyable if not for the amazing service. Kudos!"
