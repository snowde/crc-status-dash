Sean H.,"Redwood City, CA",34,79,12,4.0,10/18/2015,"Pros: Quality beer Decent selection Gluttonous Piezookie Friendly staff (thanks Anthony!) Cons: Strange, mood-lit bathroom Fried artichokes are pickled and terrible Small dairy-free selection I would come again, and recommend this place to most people I know.  Great place to catch a bite after a Comedy Sports Show ( ), which is exactly what we did.  It rounded out a great evening."
Vivian L.,"Fremont, CA",421,346,410,2.0,8/27/2014,"Very nice ambiance inside, although lighting is way dimmer than it should be (I guess we're saving energy...). We ordered the crispy calamari, gourmet five meat pizza, and new orleans jambalaya. The crispy calamari was pretty good, thankfully the batter wasn't thickly applied. It tasted crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The pizza was a little too oily for my liking (and no, it's not because of all the meats). The meats and cheese also came right off the pizza bread, hence very messy to eat. The jambalaya tasted delicious at first, but a couple bites it got way too greasy. After this meal I started feeling nauseous 'cause of all the MSG and grease (I ended up having to eat soup-based foods for the next 2 meals). Service was decent, the waitress came and checked up on us several times. We did have to pack our own food to-go though, which is questionable considering BJs is a restaurant geared towards customer satisfaction."
Eric B.,"Roseville, CA",1,11,8,1.0,6/28/2016,"Typical chain restaurant. The service leaves a lot to be desired at the price point. My server spent more time conversing with her co-workers than waiting on our table. Pretty bad when you have to ask for refills and setups. From the look of the staff they could use some diversity. More seasoned professional servers and bar staff could very well improve the quality of service delivery. Nothing here to make me want to revisit this venue. If you want average food with below average service by all means this is your restaurant. Only thing management has going is location, location, location."
Diana O.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,18,5.0,2/26/2016,BJs is the place to go for my family when we want fast excellent service. The food is always consistent and the value Is always great!  When we have a Birthday or special occasion or just want to sit down as a family for a meal BJ's is always the perfect choice.  Thank you for making my job easier and taking care of the family table. It's not always easy working a full time job and feeding a family of 7. We appreciate your consistency! Another visit: I can always count on BJ's for providing us a table when we sit down as a family to celebrate or even gather for a family meal. Kyle did an excellent job serving us and making sure we had what we needed.
Eddie R.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",41,110,311,5.0,10/12/2016,We ate dinner here on 9-12-16 it was very good Love their salad that you're a dressing  is delicious had to look it up how they made it mine ate quite as good but not that it was a Caesar salad and chicken was very good I like BJ's haven't had a bad at any of them I've been to and service is out of this world
Blake B.,"Elk Grove, CA",119,40,31,1.0,10/29/2015,Tried this location for the second time. Each time we go here there are too many things wrong with the place.  I ordered the avocado rolls which are always good for an appetizer. Than I saw the crispy calamari on the menu and order it next along with 2 mini pizzas.  The calamari came out and they weren't anything crispy it felt as if they were not thaws out I honestly felt like I was eating octopus and I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth. Disgusting - one star Our deep dish pizzas came out and I'm starving but it didn't taste right meaning the bread was too soft as if they rushed it out.  - one star  Waited for my drink and for the wrong one  and  right one finally came out when I finished my pizza. - one star  Overall I like the brand but this location has let me down far too many times. Another minus star for multiple attempts.
Jasmine C.,"Sacramento, CA",324,254,3110,1.0,9/3/2014,"It was a weekday, has a work and school for tomorrow, so dinner to go, but it was a disaster, when the waitress took our order to go, she didn't ask what salad dressing that I want with my garden salad, she just decided by her self that I want ranch, same goes with our daughter kid meal chicken tenders no asking what is the sauce that she want. It's a weekday, and she isn't that busy too. And after we left, we were talking in the car if hubby check the bag that all our order were there and guess what, soup was missing, so we had to turn around for the soup :("
Cwiddy B.,"Sacramento, CA",13,51,23,1.0,10/1/2015,"Worst customer service ever. Our waitress, some chick with brown hair tied in a bun made us never want to come back, I should of stuck to the BJ's in Elk Grove where when the servers make a mistake they will fix it themselves and are very friendly. My friend & I ordered something super simple. I got the BJ's brewhouse burger & he got some type of tomato shrimp pasta. She asked what appetizer we wanted and we both told her calamari. Long after we ordered our food, we asked where our calamari was. She did some weird fake laugh didn't even apologize & made some other waiter give it to us. No apology, no nothing. We had to flag down the manager and he kept making some lame excuses for the cooks saying ""they took a really long time to make it."" The calamari was then docked off our bill, however it was the waitress's job to let them know she completely forgot about us & what we wanted. I also forgot to mention, there were people seated around us 20 minutes after we arrived & their food got there way before ours. Why? Our money is just as green as everyone else's. All we wanted was some food and ok experience, it was just horrible."
Mike A.,"Sacramento, CA",2,7,,1.0,2/19/2017,Wait person decent. $17 mini pizza came out luke warm and $17 salad with ahi tuna totally inedible. Took 15 minutes to get two drinks.
Mike S.,"Pacifica, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/4/2015,"Went in on a Thursday night with a large party (13 people). It took forever for the waiter to take our food order and then forever for the food to make it to the table ... except mine ... mine was not there. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, a seemingly easy, even harmless order. Nothing. After waiting another ten minutes, a burger was put in front of me ... A burger, not MY burger. My burger, I was told, was given away to another table, but I can ""chew on this other burger until my order is ready"". What?!  The waiter was apologetic, but he kept trying to sell me on this other burger. Well, I was hungry so I ate it ... then my actual order arrived in a pan, not a plate, but a cookie sheet-like pan. Yeah, I think I'm done."
James W.,"Garberville, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/19/2017,"The food was okay; nothing special. The pizookies are worth it, but that's about it. I personally had a terrible experience with the service, as my order took over forty five minutes, despite the waiter and manager assuring me multiple times that it would be just a couple minutes. Once I did receive the food, the manager seemed intent on trying to make it up to me with a $20 card of credit, but honestly I just wanted him to leave me alone. He probably came by the table five times, and I just wanted to eat my dang food! Also, after dinner, the pizookies took forever as well. I won't be back."
Ben D.,"Sacramento, CA",466,236,419,4.0,7/6/2015,"Coco and I came over here after a nice family picnic earlier in the day to cool off. I must've down 6 glasses of water after feeling so drained by the heat.  While Coco had a delicious BJ's root beer float. So since we'd already eaten we decided to split a dessert. She felt like chocolate so we ordered the triple chocolate plazookie! We've been to 4 other BJ locations so this is no different though I don't recall ever having such a rich decadently addictive dessert such as this. Only downfall is that's far too rich for her taste.  It was well worth it though, this venue possessed the good ambiance of other BJ Brewhouses and also had a thoughtful staff serving with excellence. 4 stars to BJ's."
Chris G.,"West Sacramento, CA",6,23,16,4.0,8/14/2016,Parking aside this is a great spot to grab some ice cold beers and yummy food. Atmosphere is typical to all BJ's but the staff here is better than at other locations. It seem like you always have to wait a little while to be seated but you can always grab a seat in the bat area right away.
Jason P.,"Sacramento, CA",211,193,1,3.0,4/19/2016,"Typically I'm a fan of BJ's. And being my second time around at this location, I thought my experience would have been somewhat better...But it wasn't .  So, we decided to stop by for drinks, app and a Pazooki ( I think it's spelled), Being it was a Monday evening and the weather was perfect for dining out on the patio. Well, as we were approached by the host we politely asked him if we could have a table out on the patio. It wasn't busy and it was only the two of us. So, he says he has to go get the waiter to seat us (Odd, I thought that was HIS job?) So as that left us confused and he disappears. Another house with an abrupt look on her face asked if we been helped. We stated yes, but...(Oh, yea she said Ok, swung her hair and turned her back on us as we were still talking to her.) Excuse me.... So the original host comes back and says, he can't sit us on the patio because the waiter has a large party (Table of probably 6 people) in the inside dining area.... WTF?! We are all kinds of confused at this point. So, we opt to sit inside the super cold dining area. That's phase one. So now we're seated, and we wait another 10 minutes before we are greeted by our waitress. So that's about 20 minutes wait time so far. Luckily she had a bubbly personality because I was going to say something about the wait. We order our drinks and ordered a side of fries because at this point we are just over it. The drinks come, my Margarita is full of ice. If I wanted a cup of ice, I would have asked for one. And my partner ordered some new Champagne drink, that looked nothing like the pic. Horrible presentation. And the sad part he had to send it back and tell them how to make their own drink. Like really? Who is running this place? Now the fries come out......So I guess someone ordered the friend and didn't want them so they set out till someone else ordered them and lucky us we got them. They were burnt, but felt uncooked... So we sent them back, then they come back with a higher stack of fries. Then the waiter says, they felt bad so they gave us more.. Nooo... you but more fries on top of the old because the top few fries were hot and the bottom were colder. I'm getting pissed off all over again. So that was a fail. Then I thought I give the Margarita a second try. But in a Margarita glass. Just another glass of ice. I'm so irritated cuz now these people are playing with my money. The Pazooki has arrived, and we're like ok this looks good. My spoon can't break through the cookie.... Hat's off!. Did they really send us a burnt cookie. Which I take it the manager took off the bill. But hell, everything we had was a mess.  I don't know what's going on with this BJ's but they need a major overhaul. This location is a HUGE disappointment! We should have went with our first mind and we to Cheesecake Factory. They have not yet to disappoint. SMH @ BJ'S!"
Gordon H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,33,3,2.0,8/13/2015,"Love the house porter & the seared ahi salad! Half of the servers here are transfers from fast food who ask stupid questions, make stupid comments, or try to become familar. Plus, the incessant pushing of yet another rewards program and another stupid card I don't want. Please install self-service ordering kiosks like those at Applebees! They really cut down on all the needless chatter. Great TV's & HH specials during football games."
Vania C.,"Castro Valley, CA",694,361,199,3.0,9/8/2014,"The place and service itself was great but the food was a little interesting. There was a 49ers gaming going on when I came to eat with my roommate so I wasn't super surprised that it was super loud when there was a touchdown. For lunch, I had the  New Orleans Style Jambalaya and my roommate had the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. Mine was ok but it bugged me a bit that I kept finding bits of angel hair pasta in my rice. Strange but at least it didn't mess with the taste. My roommate's pasta was a little mushy and dry but still the favor was good.  The lemonades were amazing. I had the strawberry lemonade and it was super refreshing, sweet but still had the perfect balance of sour. The lemonade was coated with sugar on top of the glass, smart to balance out the sour flavor (not for the strawberry lemonade though, which already has the strawberries for that).  Price was a bit high, about 40 bucks for a lunch. It was good but wouldn't be something I'd get all the time. Will be back eventually for the pizza though :]"
Joanne C.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,70,285,3.0,1/17/2015,I love their ahi poke appetizer! I wish they served more chips with it though because I always run out before I finish the poke. The great white is my personal favorite in terms of pizza. The shrimp scampi pasta is also good. For beer I get the Berry Burst Cider & of course you can't leave without having a pizookie.  Service is a hit or miss. Some days you'll luck out with an attentive server and on others you don't even get checked on.
Kayla K.,"San Ramon, CA",3,46,6,5.0,7/27/2014,"Came in on a Friday night around 10:30pm. It wasn't that busy and we got to pick our seats in the bar area.  No complaints, the food and service were both great.  Tried the bacon chicken and ranch pizza for the first time and it was soo good!  The new peanut butter s'mores pizookie is a must try if you like these flavors!"
Dorothy N.,"Suisun City, CA",0,19,,2.0,3/1/2017,"We went up to Sacramento to visit our granddaughter, who is attending Sac State. We took her out to lunch, and to say I was extremely disappointed would be an understatement. Food was mediocre at best, but our server, Kristine B, seemed to be completely overwhelmed. We don't know if it was due to under-staffing, overworked, or if she just was not in a good mood, but it took forever for her to take our orders, and we never got any additional service for coffee/drink refills at all. Cost, without tip, was $73.49, and it was nothing to brag about. The really sad part was we had to go up to the cashier desk in order to find our server to get our check.  To us, the only good thing about this restaurant is the location..but bear in mind it is in a large shopping center and parking is a total pain.  While we cannot speak for our granddaughter, we know we personally will not be back."
Katy S.,"Sacramento, CA",55,56,104,2.0,9/28/2015,"The calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and lemon grass chicken were very good. We ordered two jambalaya and a grilled chicken Alfredo. The Jambalyas were pretty good just a bit too flavorful. But the Alfreda was a bit hard. The service wasn't that good. Our server was William k as per the receipt wasn't that friendly. He didn't interact with us or anything but he did interact with the other table right next to ours. Which I don't get, aren't servers suppose to be equally friend or engaging to their tables? That how it was when I was working as a server back then. But things might have changed. When I told him my noodles were hard, he said there was nothing they can do about it bc there were already sauce on there. I mean isn't that how it's suppose to come with the sauce? Or couldn't he have said oh let me ask the chef to make you another one or would you like something else? But no he didn't ask anything like that, he just said there's nothing we can do about it. So I said ok, please bring me a box to take it to go. When he came back he just tossed the box on the table and didn't even say anything; not even a here's your box and he turned to the table next to us and starting talking to them.  I've been to bjs plenty of times but never had bad service like this before. Maybe he was having a bad day, but like my companion said maybe he just didn't like servicing us bc of how friendly we were and how race? ""Shrug"""
