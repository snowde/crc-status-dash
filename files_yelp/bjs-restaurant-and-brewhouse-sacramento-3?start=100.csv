Jackie B.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,49,12,2.0,9/21/2016,This is one of the worst BJ's in Sacramento. Every time I go here something doesn't go right. Just recently I had gone for dinner and our server said she would add the points onto my  bj account. -____- definitely did not get those points. Food comes out total hit or miss and I am the type of person if I am super hungry I will eat it because anything else would take that much longer. I'm always disappointed in this location. Really need to step their game up. I mean what's the point in having a rewards club if you never even ask me before brining the check. Literally gave this place a 2 star because I've never had a problem with their beers.
Carol P.,"Sacramento, CA",3063,824,879,4.0,1/30/2015,"Cherry chipotle glazed salmon from the ""enlightened"" menu.  Soooo good.  Soooo flavorful.  Soooo going to order it again.  Not enough o's to describe just how surprisingly delicious it really was.  WIth just a hint of sweetness, this savory glaze was perfect for my thick cut of salmon.  It was maybe baked a wee bit too long, as the fillet itself was flaky but not tender.  It was served over some really flavorful quinoa with spinach and side of the skinniest asparagus spears I've ever seen in my life.  It didn't matter.  The flavor was there. I called in this order for takeout, and when I arrived 20 minutes later (ETD-estimated time of doneness-given to me by staff taking order) to the restaurant, I waited a few minutes for the takeout counter staff and another few minutes to get my order.  No worries because my food was still hot when I got back home.  Of course, presentation of the dish was lost from being jostled in the plastic foldover container during transportation.  But again, no worries, it's a fabulous dish.  Hope this stays on the menu!"
A N.,"Sacramento, CA",3,3,,3.0,7/16/2017,This review is solely based on the Churro Pizookie--- NOT that good. It seemed as if they deep fried 50 churros together and they were just all in the back waiting to come out. They were not fresh at all. At least the other Pizookies are baked to order..
Mel K.,"Sacramento, CA",5,36,14,1.0,3/2/2017,"2 hours. This is the longest I've ever spent at BJ's or any restaurant for that matter. 6:15pm we arrived. 6:30- seated. 6:35- drinks and appetizers ordered. Server didn't come take our order until 7:30. I couldn't be mad at him, because he apologized for making us wait. Food didn't come out until 8:00. Took us mins of picking at our semi warm food to realize we had filled up on water or root beer. It took the server another 10-15 mins to come around before I could ask for the check and some to go boxes. Andddd then... we were freeeeee."
Pam C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,11,1.0,9/13/2017,I don't know whats been going on with BJ's the lately but quality of food is poor. It seems to have been like that this past year. It used to be one of my favorite places to grab a bite but not so much anymore. When someone suggests to go to BJ's I suggest something else. Their food comes out cold and or over greasy. Gross.
Rana S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,2,5.0,9/17/2017,"We had really good time there. Everything was perfect, cool. We went there 2 days ago. And they get us our table. Sofi the girl with charm, took order and served and treated awesome. She were like super friendly. And i love the food. I ask Sofi that who is cooking my food and that was Davin And Nash cooking for us that time. We loved that place and people there. Hopefully we going there next week too. Thank you guys for real good time"
Chris S.,"Arlington, VA",249,613,362,2.0,8/12/2016,"Great selection of draft beers.  But, the place is really packed and service is slow.  Seeing how packed it was in the bar area, I was surprised to see two children sitting at the bar.  Not at tables in the bar area, but literally sitting at the bar. I did not think this was legal in California."
Alex F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",43,5,,1.0,9/24/2017,"If I could leave no stars I would, me and my girlfriends family five of us to be exact when into this restaurant at 5:30 to ask about how long it would be get a table they told us that it would be 30 minutes so we asked if by six will be seated they said yes. Well 6 o'clock comes and goes and we go ask them if our table is going to be ready soon and they say that now it's gonna be another 45 minute wait because there's a table that will not leave meanwhile there's other five tops that are coming in and walking right past us getting to be seated and I understand they're busy but if they say that you cannot call before hand and make reservations, why are we been put to the side and not even being talked too?. Worst customer service I've ever experienced here nobody knew what they were doing even the manager came up and she had no idea how to try and resolve the issue. We finally decided to just leave after waiting for over an hour. Not acceptable at all. And this is the worse bjs I've ever been"
Craig J. T.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",5,42,9,2.0,9/11/2016,"Where's the toppings!!!!  Just went in to eat some gluten free pizza. Ordered the ham and pineapple as toppings, I got my pizza and it had almost no toppings on it. BJ's what has happened to you???"
Kristel V.,"Sacramento, CA",189,240,127,4.0,12/21/2015,"Food and service here is pretty good. Ordered the Beet salad with my all time favorite avocado egg rolls. I believe in consistency and all the BJs I have been to in Sacramento are pretty consistent. Also tried the baked beignets which was very good! Not too sweet, but just right!"
Jenna S.,"Valley Springs, CA",5,40,75,4.0,8/9/2016,"The pepperoni pizza and pazookie desserts are super delish. The servers were fast, efficient and knowledgable. Great ambiance, very cozy and warm. The neighborhood is great because it's right by a high end mall. My only problem is the price.. Some things are reasonable, but others are a smidge overpriced. All in all I would for sure recommend going, I am for sure:)"
Ross H.,"Sonora, CA",106,31,12,1.0,3/7/2017,"We put in our name at 6:45p the Place was busy but not that busy.....took an hour to get seated so we ordered appetizers, they brought our entrées prior to the appetizers. They took some of the entrées back and then brought the appetizers and then brought the entrées back again. Two hours at the table everybody is finely eating...... seriously?!?!?"
Sarah M.,"North Highlands, CA",18,14,3,5.0,10/28/2016,Omg all I have is love for BJ'S of Arden tonight. Super happy with the service. There was a glitch with the order system. The manager went out of his way to make sure our order was out on time. The waitess was super awesome too. I got everything I asked for and then some. It was like they were reading my mind. I would be about to ask for something and here she would come with it in hand. Again thank you guys for a awsome meal that I didn't have to cook. Super happy customer here.
Franko G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/30/2017,It's been a while since I had a great service and Andy did a outstanding  job  and the food was delicious
Josh M.,"North Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",17,1,,1.0,9/19/2017,"Normally I 've had good experiences with BJ's but this was my first time visiting this location at Arden mall. I called at noon to make reservations for 12 people for today 9/19 at 7pm. The lady I spoke to confirmed 3 times with me the time, # of people, and the day, I thought it a little extreme but hey it'll avoid mistakes. She then said she needed to run it by her manager and placed me on a 3 minute hold. Afterwards she said all was approved and then confirmed the time 7pm, the # of people 12, and the day today 9/19.... We did this 7 more times..... No exaggeration. We added 5 more people with prior approval. We have 16 of the 17 people there at 7 and the front counter says the reservation was set for 7:30. They had us wait for patrons to finish their meals, pay their bill and then they relaxed and visited. That was completely expected and in no way their fault for BJ's mistake. We left and now enjoying our meals at Olive Garden. Thank you Olive Garden!"
Dee D.,"Sacramento, CA",16,151,793,4.0,2/27/2017,"We hardly ever eat here, but occasionally we will get a pizza to go!  Their deep dish is really tasty.  Currently, they have a special on Mondays - half off large pizzas!  Can't go wrong with that!  The Mediterranean (without the chicken to make it veg) is my favorite!  Sometimes we'll splurge and get a pizookie - Sooooo good!"
Keely M.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",232,179,427,4.0,1/3/2016,Today was not so bad! Happy hour during the football games half price mini pizza and $1 off drinks! I was really happy everything came out quickly and correct! Way to redeem yourself.
Brittany G.,"Sacramento, CA",22,24,29,4.0,10/8/2016,The four stars is for the care taking after my order. Ordered deep dish pizza on my lunch. Took about twenty minutes via the online site. Arrived to friendly staff and quick check out but went back to work to eat and my pizza looked like they just threw it together. Dont get me wrong I'm not expecting the pictures on the menu but this was not acceptable. Came back later after my shift showed the night manager Shawn a picture I took of the pizza and he agreed. Asked me if I wanted a drink while I wait for them to make me a new one. I give credit where its do and their customer service deserves credit. I didn't have to give some sob story or suggest anything. His first response was do you have time I want to get you a new one.  This place is always busy but I'm even on a busy night they are ensuring standards are being kept. I wish it was done the first time but sometimes its the way you finish.
Kathy K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,3.0,9/16/2017,I got take out last night their spaghetti and meatballs lit was way to spicy. Almost every bite had a chili flake. I don't believe spaghetti and meatballs are supposed to be spicy. I could not eat it all. My husband had the shrimp and Mahi Mahi which he loved.
Danny R.,"West Sacramento, CA",12,25,7,5.0,5/22/2017,"I've never been disappointed at BJs. The food is always good and the service is friendly. Call ahead during the weekend so you can get a table quickly. The Santa Fe Chicken Salad is my favorite. They also have a great kids menu. Some good brews too, I like the lightswitch Lager and the misses enjoys their berry burst cider."
