Joanna S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,1,1.0,5/21/2017,I just ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo to go and when I got home there was absolutely no sauce on the pasta. It was horrible and dry. Don't go to the bjs on Arden!!
Les C.,"Folsom, CA",0,13,6,4.0,5/19/2017,"love bj""s  love there menu, there food, never a long wait, mostly get right in.  Great service and I love the rewards program.  Free food, free pazooki.  Can't get better than that"
Tonya S.,"Dallas, TX",23,79,193,3.0,2/11/2017,"We came in for the lunch menu , which we called ahead to verify. The waitress wanted to hurry and seat us because lunch was over at 3 . Our waiter comes and informs us there arent any lunch specials on weelend but the menu is still available. My daughter polite said  may a speak to a manager. The hostess should be aware of what is happening in your establishment menu/specials/times. Long story short oir waitet said my daughter had some cool sun glasses on and he would ring us up at the lunch rate  thanks BJ"
Abi C.,"Gardner, KS",177,13,15,3.0,4/28/2017,"Our party ordered three seared ahi salad & none came with avocado in them. When I prompted the waitress, she stated that there's no avocado in the entree. The menu clearly stated avocado, as well as the picture shown on the menu--avocado cubes all over the salad. We waited for the waitress to bring us a side of avocado...never happened. The waitress later offered us a mini dessert, limiting us to only one of the pizookie trio. I was not interested in it at all, but ended up getting it to go just to settle the disappointment."
Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",743,2526,266,4.0,10/27/2015,"Been ages since my last BJ's visit and I'm glad to find such a great branch right over at Arden Fair.  Conveniently located, ample parking and even a nice outdoor patio area for warmer nights. My girlfriend and I tried a number of items including the turkey burger and several new dishes I hadn't seen before including brussies in sriracha cream sauce, stuffed mushrooms and sriracha dry-rubbed chicken wings.  All the proteins were surprisingly tender with no semblance of overcooking or dryness.   For drinks, I went with a red buffalo (50:50 mix of Jeremiah Red and Tatonka Stout) that turned out to be an awesome mix of creamy roastiness and hops. So while BJ's may be ""just a chain"" in the eyes of many, there's no doubt that the slew of new dishes is delivering in terms of flavor, texture and value especially during HH.  For a relaxing date night or casual get together with friends, this branch is on my short list for sure!"
Nate T.,"Sacramento, CA",1,12,,1.0,5/15/2017,Patio is pet friendly but service is terrible. They have to find someone to wait on you. We gave this place a couple of chances. Never again. Patio dining sucks.
Jessica R.,"Sacramento, CA",69,94,115,4.0,7/6/2016,"My family and I visited BJs for lunch (Thursday) after shopping at Arden Fair for 2+ hours, there was a 10 minute wait and they sat us at a large booth. Beau was our server, he was kind/nice/polite/attentive, great smile. Avocado egg rolls were great as always. Sons grilled cheese was good with Fries. My salmon quinoa bowl was sooooo bland. Flavorless. My honey got a pasta and he enjoyed it."
Brenda R.,"Dallas, TX",3,50,33,4.0,7/10/2016,"Really casual environment. We got seated very fast here. Our waiter, Sean was extremely friendly and always showed a sense of urgency. I really recommend the the California Supreme Deep Dish Pizza."
Jason E.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/10/2017,"Wednesday May 10, 2017. Arrived at Bj's here on Arden and it was busy. Even though getting seated and ordering our 1st drinks was slow the staff on hand was extremely accomadating. Had 2 separate waiters. Both were friendly and made us feel important. Will be returning for future visits. Try the Berry Burst cider or the handcrafted draft cream soda. Nick was our main waiter."
Shannen C.,"Sacramento, CA",271,467,4006,4.0,2/17/2016,"Came here to order food to go. For a chain, the food is pretty good. The service is not bad either. They also have good happy hour. Will be back more."
Coleen M.,"Sacramento, CA",69,61,5,3.0,3/25/2017,"We went to BJ's and was pretty disappointed. We ordered an appetizer and it came out like 1 or 2 minutes before our meal. The appetizer was so hot we really couldn't eat it, then our meal showed up. Wow! So much for an appetizer, right? I ordered a beer and it came several minutes after my meal came. The food was good but they do not have table management or food delivery/cooking management at all. I would give them a 1 star for managing the flow of food/drink delivery. The food was flavorful and that's worth the 3 star review."
Sokha L.,"Sacramento, CA",27,4,,1.0,4/17/2017,Today is my birthday and right after the movies my husband brought me here for the first time to try it out. But the service sucks Kelly F. Was our server and we left our empty water cups and drink cups at the end of our table to see if anyone would ask to see if we would like a refill. Never will I go in again. That was my first time going in and will be my last time. The food was good. But service sucks. They stuck us all the way in the back and acted like they did not want to serve us. Never again!!! Is this how you train your servers to treat people like that. Unacceptable!!! The server did not stop by to see if everything was ok. We had to ask for our check.
Marcus M.,"Folsom, CA",403,266,399,2.0,9/26/2015,I always get suckered into coming here! Overpriced beer and ok food! The service is always prompt tho! The best thing about BJ's are their pazookies! The food here is ok. Not bad but not good which is why I'm not a huge fan.
Dorthy R.,"Sacramento, CA",161,14,53,2.0,12/15/2016,"BJ's is just ok in my book. The quality of service has gone down since I've been going, this location is especially bad. I just take my food to go now. I do love the mobile app"
Serina M.,"Sacramento, CA",2,3,,5.0,3/23/2017,"The food was great. The service was great. Tbh, my friends and I were drunk and indecisive when ordering our food. The waiter (wish I could remember his name) was super cool and patient. He even joked around with us a bit. Don't worry he got a good tip."
Sandy M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",33,124,7,5.0,2/18/2017,Had the lunch special which was a stuffed baked potato and a salad. It came out fast and it was delicious. Our waiter was very nice and did a great job making sure we were taken care of.
Joann P.,"Sacramento, CA",479,369,2286,3.0,8/14/2015,"Came here last night to meet up with some friends for dinner. Got there around 940pm and seated ourselves at the bar area. They have happy hour drinks starting at 10pm- close. Server was so slow. Took forever to get water and for her to get our order in. Food and drinks took forever to come out too. We actually thought our server went home that's how long it took. She messed up on our drinks. She brought out 2 glass of snake bite, when I only ordered 1 and got my friend's drink wrong. Other than the poor service I did enjoy my clam chowder. I ordered it in a sourdough bowl. It was very delicious."
Susy L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,34,250,5.0,3/6/2016,Bjz is always so good  the bartenders are so amazing  The lost lots of ppl  Since the took the happy hour specials  Too bad
Chaulzy S.,"Sacramento, CA",50,78,75,3.0,8/24/2015,I pretty much frequent bjs for a regular cup of bowl of chicken tortilla soup or a jerry burst. You can usually walk right into the car section and sit faster than waiting for a regular table. This particular occasion I didn't feel well so I called in an order for curbside service. I specifically told the person ( who rudely rushed me off the phone) that I was ordering for curbside service. Her said ok just call when you get here and hung up.. So I arrive and call.. Just for them to tell me they no longer do that service at this time of night. The sign says they do it until 9pm.! I called before 9 and was clear I required curbside. I even arrived before 9 and all. I didn't have the energy to argue so I get out and get it....  My food wasn't ready I stand there for 10mins waiting for someone to come back with my food literally holding back the urge to puke on their floor.  I just wanted my soup and to get home but no.  The person in the phone should have listened to me and not rushed me off the phone. They should have told me I would have to get out the car I could have had my bf be prepared to get out the car. Ugh I was so disappointed  The soup is always good that's the only plus
Judy P.,"Sacramento, CA",67,2,,1.0,4/4/2017,"There clam chowder taste like it's straight out from a can, I did not like it and their steak is plain no type of flavor but charcoal. I wasn't satisfied at all."
