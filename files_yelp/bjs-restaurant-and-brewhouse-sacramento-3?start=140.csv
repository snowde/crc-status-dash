Amritpal W.,"Riverside, CA",5,19,59,1.0,5/25/2016,I have tried this place before and this time was just as bad as last time. Last time we came the lettuce was in such bad shape like it was weeks old. This time the appetizer took about 45 mins and we got the Sriracha Queso Dips chili verde which I lie to you not had 3 spoons of fat oil in it. I don't know why but the service and quality of food at this location is usually the worst.
Emily F.,"Citrus Heights, CA",83,4,2,5.0,4/2/2017,"This BJ's location is by far my favorite. We had a party of 10 for a birthday and our waiter Benjamin was super on top of it while helping other tables as well, and made time to make us feel important and laugh. Great food and good company. I have all good things to say. If you can, ask for Ben!"
Marissa J.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",149,25,21,4.0,6/7/2016,"I have always enjoyed coming to BJs. I enjoy coming to this location in particular because it is located right next to Arden Fair Mall, which is incredibly convenient. However, it is significantly smaller than all of the other BJs locations I have been to, though the service is typically fast, so the smaller size does not affect the speed of service. I always love coming here when they have their 2 for $25 deal going on. For $25, you each get either a small house salad, Caesar salad, wedge salad (my personal favorite), or any soup, plus any medium Deep Dish or Tavern-Cut pizza, and of course a Pizookie, which is what BJs is known for - their large oven-baked cookie topped with ice cream. I usually always get the Cookies 'n' Creme Pizookie, but they have a ton of flavors to choose from. If you're indecisive, you can get the Pizookie Trio, which is three mini Pizookies and you can mix and match the flavors. Another tip I've learned is that they can make a Pizookie half and half. In the past, I have ordered a Pizookie that was half Cookies 'n' Creme and half Chocolate Chunk. Overall, I enjoy eating at BJs and will definitely continue coming to this location."
John T.,"Citrus Heights, CA",1,9,6,4.0,3/30/2017,"Here's a picture of our Sacramento Vietnam Veterans group that meets once a month to hoist a pint and break bread in Brotherhood and friendship.  We started our group back in September, 2015.  We enjoy lunch on the patio, only once eating inside during inclement weather, 19 months now.  Samantha (Sam), our waitress has only missed one month of taking care of us with 5-star service.  Good food, great service and the camaraderie of a dozen Brothers-in-Arms, today we celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War, toasting and saying a pray for our missing and suffering Brothers."
Vivian L.,"Sacramento, CA",2,13,,2.0,6/18/2016,"I usually go to the Elk Grove location, but decided to come to this location instead cause I was closer to it at the time.  Went there last night. Ordered a strawberry mojito, and the spaghetti and meat balls dish.  The food came out really quick, but tasted great, but as I was chewing, I bit on something small and hard. Took it out of my mouth, and it was a piece of cardboard! But I didn't make it a big deal about it cause I was happy that at least it wasn't human hair or a bug, so I continued eating.  When I got home, I felt really sick. I thought it was the mojito kicking in, so I decided to go to sleep.  The next morning(today) at 7am, I had horrible (sorry)diarrhea, and threw up ALL the spaghetti out. As of right now(12:13pm), I'm still having to use the bathroom.  I can honestly say that I got food poisoning.  Sad, too, cause I love Bj's, but definitely won't be coming back to this location anymore."
Amy H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/7/2017,"Our lunch took over 45 minutes and most of us ordered soup and salad at the Natomas location in Sacramento, CA Terrible service from the kitchen."
Sherg K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/4/2017,Came in to this location 2 hours ago and I now just threw up my fish and chips. The fish tasted funny but I wasn't sure if it was their special batter or the fish. The tartar sauce tasted rancid too so I asked for ranch to make up for it which it did not. Only giving two stars because service was alright. Do not order seafood. My friends ordered chicken and a burger and they're okay.
Josiah H.,"Sacramento, CA",361,139,511,4.0,8/1/2015,"I've been here too many times to count, but FINALLY I'm writing a review. Last weekend I took my boys to the BJ's at Arden for lunch last Saturday. I'd been to this location 1-2 other times, and always on the weekend. BJ's was filled as usual, with guests in the main areas as well as those in the bar section. Our wait for a table was only about 15 so while we waited ,we watched the Giants game from one of the MANY TV's they had in the establishment that was showing it. Once we sat and were given our menus, and we got our drinks first. Then I noticed they were advertising their new appetizer, the 'Honey Sriracha Roasted Brussel Sprouts'. From the picture they looked grilled, so I decided to check them out. I also ordered their 16oz sirloin steak with grilled asparagus a small Cesar salad. My oldest son got the Brewhouse burger as he always does and my youngest got the chicken tenders and fries....like he always does! :) My salad arrived first which was a fairly decent size for a side salad....and then the Honey Sriracha Roasted Brussel Sprouts came. WOW! these were hands down, one of the best appetizers that I've ever had here. I went into ordering them not knowing what to expect, and I left wanting to find out how to make them (which I did). There were so many different tastes and smells going on in just this dish, there was a creamy, sweet and spiciness to the sauce because of the honey and Sriracha combination. Mixed in with a smokiness from the grilled outer layer of the Brussel Sprouts, plus a little bite from the Brussel Sprouts themselves. That plus the cesar salad was a good start to my main dish. The sirloin was cooked perfectly, and it paired well with the grilled asparagus. With the appetizer, and salad to start my meal off. I purposely saved half of my steak and asparagus for dinner, and so I could leave room for dessert. And I decided to have the 'BJ's Baked Beignet', which was amazing. Imagine bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream.....yea exactly! You get this mixture of a warm cinnamon'y donut and cold creamy vanilla ice cream, topped with ripened strawberries in a sweet strawberry sauce! Overall it was one of the best pairings of meals that I've had at BJ's, which is saying a lot since I've probably eaten here at a minimum once a month. Over the last couple of years."
Anna S.,"Roseville, CA",54,210,101,4.0,8/26/2015,"BJ's is your typical large mass produced restaurant chain. The food is always hit or miss. Your service, same thing. You are always going to take a gamble of loving your food and service or hating it.  Today we took the risk and we loved it. I am a rewards club member and every week or so they email me with special promotions. This week I received a buy one entree get one free. My fiancé decided to redeem this coupon for lunch today. We had an awesome waiter who I wish we got his name. He was super friendly and very very attentive. Our glasses were never empty and when I asked for a side of ranch it came before our food! A lot of time they forget and you have to ask again, usually after you get your food.  My fiancé and I both got their new burgers. I got the portabella burger and my fiancé got the guacamole burger. Both were delicious. The side of fries are so good. They are thin cut so very delicious. My portabella burger had a kick that I wasn't expecting but I liked it none the less. My only complaint was my burger was WAY over cooked. It was bad. I actually think my burger was microwaved because the inside was really really hot, not the cooked on a stove hot but microwaved hot. I should have said something but I didn't care enough to. My suggestion is to order your burger or mean medium. I'm sure it would have been much better.  Overall I really enjoyed our lunch. They have a huge select of craft beer, mixed drinks and non alcoholic drinks. Their root beer is out of this world good. Oh and the pizookies are delish."
Kristi T.,"San Francisco, CA",438,357,1216,4.0,7/24/2014,"We came in as a party of 8 on a Saturday night, after the California State Fair. Though it was pretty packed, we were seated immediately. I rounded BJ's down to a 4 since service was inattentive. It took too long for our server to take our orders, and he took both drink and food orders in one shot. At least give me my drink first! It was also nearly impossible to flag him down for my mocktail refill. Maybe service will be better when it's less crowded. I ordered a Peachberry Iced Tea (Mocktail). It was sweet and refreshing. Plus, free refills! For my entree, I ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken. It was absolutely delicious! The chicken breast is extremely tender and juicy. I was surprised it wasn't dry at all! Also, the balsamic glaze was perfect. It didn't overpower the seasoning on the chicken. The entree included a side of salad and a side of mashed potatoes. I finished half at the restaurant and took the other half home. It tasted good even after it was reheated. For dessert, I shared a Cookies 'N' Cream Pizookie with 3 other friends. 2/2 times that I've tried their pizookies and loved them! I would drop by just for a pizookie! Located in Arden Mall, there is no need to worry about parking. Props to them for opening late, which is why we came here! They need to handle their conflicts inside the kitchen or outside the restaurant. We witnessed one while we were there. Though entertaining, it's not the best for their reputation!"
Mischa H.,"Sacramento, CA",278,13,33,5.0,2/3/2017,Went to lunch with my husband and had a wonderful time the bar tender was great and the food was delicious!!
Matt A.,"San Francisco, CA",219,3,1,1.0,1/23/2016,"I love to eat and have rarely disliked anything but the food was so bad I had to share this. The waitress was extremely nice and helpful and service was great. But this review is for the steak and veggies that came with the meal. It was a ribeye (their best steak available) that I ordered medium but it came out well done, dark, chewy, fatty and one of the worst steaks I've ever had. The brussel sprouts were also extremely over cooked and I could barely look at them.  I love BJs but they need to pay closer attention to my meat next time."
Alex L.,"Oakland, CA",38,58,29,3.0,12/26/2016,It's always a hit or miss. Today I ordered a $9 soup and salad to go. The bartender was very nice and helpful but it took 20 minutes for it and when the waitress brought it there were no utensils so I had to wait longer for them to get it. I should have called in regardless.
Tabassum L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,66,,3.0,6/8/2016,Last time I came here was last year as a late night thing with some friends.  The menu is a little on the small side. The only thing good that I like here is the pizookie.  Other then that it's not the kind of Restaurant that I crave.
Parker K.,"Sacramento, CA",183,43,48,5.0,5/8/2016,"Even on a crowded day, with a 20 minute wait, we were seated promptly. The service was great and remembered our exact order for the three of us without writing anything down! My friend also got a free birthday cookie for his birthday! We'll definitely be back and I'd recommend this place to everyone!"
Bailey R.,"Concord, CA",68,11,,2.0,7/31/2017,"Last night came I'm for dinner with some friends. We were seated quickly but that's about all the positive news I have for this review. Our waters took at least 15 minutes to get to us. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip since we figured it would take awhile to get our food. When that came it tastes like cream of broccoli soup. Extremely thin, and while I do like cream of broccoli soup, it was pretty lame for spinach artichoke dip. Our main courses came. My rice was hard, chicken was overlooked and Brussels sprouts had too much balsamic vinaigrette.. they were purple. French fries I stole from my boyfriend were amazing. And my friends spicy peanut noodle thing was good too. So most of the food was good.. just not mine I guess. We ended the night with some pizzookies and they were great as always. Our waiter was polite and we knew he was busy so no bad things to say about him. Just the food and the wait for waters. All other food came fairly fast for how busy they were."
Bobby G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/13/2017,"First time me and my family came to BJ's, got seated extremely quick but we sat and stared around for 30 minutes and nobody seemed to have noticed. So we got tired of waiting and left and came to Cheesecake instead."
Lewis V.,"Sacramento, CA",7,50,3,5.0,3/23/2016,"One of my favorite lunch spots... BJ's is the perfect blend of fun atmosphere, good food and great service. Starting with the atmosphere, it is just fun. If you are a sports fan, there are TV's galore that will most likely be showing something that you are interested in. If you aren't into the sports showing, BJ's delivers a dim, very adult feeling dining area that is fun to get together with your friends and just have a good night out. The food is fantastic! The menu ranges the from build your own pizza section to delicious burgers, to fancier fare such as the pastas and steaks. Everything that I have tried, I have always been happy with. Although I do not drink, I would fail this review if I did mention the huge selection of various adult beverages. If you can't find something to drink here, you may be too hard to please. The final thing to mention is the service. I have always had great experiences when I visit. The host/hostesses at the front are always smiling and helpful, even when busy. The wait staff is very attentive and also always smiling. Your drinks rarely get to the bottom, and the food is delivered quickly. What else can you ask for? Overall, BJ's does not do anything half way. They really seem to want you to enjoy your experience. I will definitely return in the future."
Anthony S.,"Carmichael, CA",2,46,2,5.0,1/8/2017,"I never tried this place until my nephew wanted to go for his birthday, so I took him. The service was great. There was a wait, but we had a large party so I understand. They just texted us when the table was ready. We just walked the mall for 30 mins, then they called. The food was good and the price was right. No complaints here"
Mimi I.,"Citrus Heights, CA",4,16,,5.0,11/14/2016,"we were there Sunday and our waiter was Shawn (might have misspelled it) he was fabulous!! we casual mentioned it was our mothers birthday to him and my brother wanted to pay for her meal and I would pay for mine separately. He was friendly and attentive! He had excellent customer service. He would mention a few times if the birthday girl needed anything else and if we all enjoyed everything and even brought her out a delicious Pazookie. I haven't had a great waiter in a long time who paid attention to little detail, thorough, friendly and made our experience pleasant. we got a seat and our food in a nice timely manner. Thank you so much for the best food and service"
