Lauren S.,"Sacramento, CA",126,18,2,5.0,1/17/2017,"This is my go to spot after work to wind down. My favorite drink in the Jerry burst, it really hits the spot. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It's always nice to see the kind and familiar faces smiling at me. The food is great, the drinks are tasty, and the staff is incredible. Cheers to the good times at Bj's Brewhouse."
Lydia H.,"Dixon, CA",135,316,352,3.0,4/24/2015,"They lost our reservation for some reason so we had to wait 45 minutes. A waitress spilled one of our drinks and knocked over a knife.They brought out our appetizers at the same time as our food. Did not refill our drinks. When my husband asked for another beer the waiter said he would let ""our"" waiter know. We had to ask 3 times for water. It took us nearly 3 hours from start to finish, very slow service. For the prices they charge I would expect better. That being said, we enjoyed pizza samples while we waited and the manager came by to check on us. The food did taste great and the pizzookie was awesome. Great selection of drinks. But overall, the experience was just ok."
Kamala L.,"Mendocino, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/30/2017,"(October 2016) Sharae G. was awesome! I ordered the Bison Burger ""burned"" to indicate that I wanted it very well done. It came medium. She happily took my burger back to the kitchen and her manager even came out to apologize. They brought me back a perfectly cooked burger, added extra crispy fries, and gave the burger to me for FREE! I am super impressed with this level of courtesy. Thank you Sharae!"
Jessica G.,"Elk Grove, CA",23,1,,5.0,1/30/2017,Our server tonight was Theodore and he was awesome. He practically read our minds when he came and asked if we wanted the jeremiah red and hopstorm ipa and Avocado egg rolls. Bbq chicken pizza was delicious and monday nights large deep dish pizzas are half off so it was an amazing deal. :) Food was great and service was awesome. Will definitely be returning :)
Carla A.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,23,4,1.0,6/16/2017,Horrible service from Christophe. Didn't refill our drinks and kept walking away from me when I asked for stuff. Must have been a bad day.
Adriana A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,2,1.0,10/5/2016,"Extremely unprofessional, had a fundraiser set up at this restaurant. Had It confirmed two weeks prior to the date. Bjs cancelled on us while some of our guest were there. They acted like they did not know about the fundraiser. Managers refused to talk to us. Will never host another fundraisers here. Extremely disappointed with the outcome, they just lost about 50+ customers."
Donovan H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",298,320,1321,4.0,2/16/2014,"You know how I feel about chain restaurants.. Especially when the food is predictable at any place you go to from coast to coast. However, I will admit that the food at ""BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse"" is slightly above what you would find at say, a TGIFridays, Applebee's, and Chili's. With that said and done, ""BJ's"" is probably my favorite go-to spot for consistently good standard comfort food. What makes this ""BJ's"" different than most is that their building is integrated in the Arden Fair Mall. This makes it a very convenient location after a complete day of shopping. And I like the fact that (even on the busiest days and evenings), parking isn't too difficult to find. For those of you who remember, the building itself used to be part of the (not-so-popular) ""California Cafe"". And when I found out a ""BJ's"" was set to open in early-2011, my excitement grew as I've always loved their amazing brewed craft beers. My review that I am focusing on is their Happy Hour that runs every Monday through Friday from 3-7pm. This is probably the best thing that ""BJ's"" has going on and their prices are unbeatable. I came here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday afternoon around 3:30pm as their was an abundance of empty tables throughout the restaurant. We decided on sitting near the bar as that would be an ideal area to track down the bartender and hostesses.  Keep in mind, I've never been here for Happy Hour until this recent experience. I was pretty amazed with the selections that were offered in the $4.00, $5.00, and $6.00 price range. I started off by ordering a ""California Club Flatbread"" with their signature ""BJ's P.M. Porter"". Both are priced at a very affordable $4.00/each. Our drinks and food come out in a very timely manner. I was definitely impressed with the size of this flatbread as it had a nice selection of grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. It was then completed with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Their P.M. Porter hit the spot too as I'm a sucker for dark beer. It had the consistency and richness of a Guinness beer but not as thick. As the afternoon migrated into the evening, their were many more appetizers that we took advantage of before the 7:00pm Happy Hour cutoff time. For $4.00, I also sampled their ""Margherita Fresca Flatbread"" and ""Boneless Wings"". The flatbread was decent but not as good as the ""California Club"". We loved the wings though as they packed the perfect amount of spice to every bite. For $5.00, we sampled their ""Chicken Pot Stickers"" which were pretty good but were slightly undercooked. And finally for $6.00, we sampled their (very popular) ""Avocado Egg Rolls"". These definitely hit the spot, crispy on the outside and soft avocado on the inside; especially after I was already working on my 4th beer at this point. Overall, I'd have to say if you're NOT coming here for Happy Hour, I'd have to rate ""BJ's"" only 3-stars. I've dined here on numerous occasions in the past and the food is your predictable standard comfort food. But the Happy Hour makes up for that, especially with the affordable deals on the food and craft beers. And if beer isn't your thing during Happy Hour, they sell well drinks (for $4.00), martinis (for $5.00), and a nice selection of wines (for $6.00). So eat, drink, and be merry at your Arden Fair ""BJ's""!"
Jim S.,"Sacramento, CA",5,27,2,2.0,12/5/2016,First time here. My server was a very nice am helpful   She always made sure to stop as she would go by to see if we needed anything. Booths a to small for a person over 6 feet. It was not very busy. Food for the price was not as grand as you would think. My steak was more Medium then Med rare. Portions were small on all our orders except for the hamburger that my son ordered. Beer was good had two of the samplers so I could try most of what they offered. Try it out it is a nice place maybe thing will be different for you.
Leslie T.,"Sacramento, CA",46,53,41,5.0,3/14/2015,"Craft beers and an extensive menu. I've been to this BJ's twice and I've been to BJ's once in Laguna Blvd. in Elk Grove. I'm glad to say that I haven't had any bad experience with any of the locations. The food is cooked really well, I love coming here for their pizookies, burgers, wings, and of course beer. The place has a nice ambiance and I like coming here to socialize with friends and or dates."
Renee' R.,"Sacramento, CA",14,4,1,3.0,6/20/2017,"Going out to eat is a treat. Because I'm very busy and cooking isn't my favorite thing. I've visited BJ's in Arden Mall on several occasions but my last visit may be my LAST visit. Upon arrival they took our name and phone number and said they would call us when our table was ready, which should have been 15-20 minutes. We never received the call so we walked back to the desk and they said oh we can seat you now. We probably could've gotten seated earlier had we not walked out into the mall. The waitress approached us immediately after we were seated and took our orders. We were on a specific time frame and she said that would not be a problem. Fast forward 45 minutes when our food finally arrived at our table. The food was warm not hot. Therefore it had probably been sitting and she had not picked it up and brought it to us. We had approximately 10 minutes to eat cold food. There was plenty of waitstaff and the restaurant was not even completely full. I understand lunch hours are busy but I feel like the service was marginal at best. I was very disappointed. I left a tip but not nearly as high as I usually tip. I really like BJ's but I think I will stick to the BJ's in the Natomas area instead where I've up always gotten outstanding service."
Emily H.,"Martinez, CA",4,10,23,5.0,3/28/2015,"Service was quick, no wait. Do they only hire attractive people? Lol but I'm not complaining.   Food was great, my boyfriend loved his too. but the lime margarita had way too much tequila."
Terrelle K.,"Sacramento, CA",664,36,54,4.0,5/7/2016,"One of my favorite places to eat and have drinks.  Especially if one of your favorite teams are playing. Chances are it's playing on one of their many flat screens.  I love their pizzas here , the selections are wide and their wings is a must try."
Ameenah M.,"Sacramento, CA",414,209,1516,3.0,2/28/2014,"It's 4:19 pm and today's my birthday, I wanted to come to bjs to get a pix police for my sisters birthday as well because we're twins. When we walked in apparently the host didn't want to greet us, instead I greeted her. It takes her a long minute to look for a place for us to sit. She comes back and ask of it's ok to sit at the bar and I told her sure. But at the moment I'm on crutches and I had to hop my way up the stairs. I'm looking though the menu and I know I wanted the choose 8 from the 10 beers they have to offer, my server comes by and I tell her what I want and instead of writing down what I wanted she tells me about happy hour. Miss I know about happy hour but this is what I want.  We order the traditional chicken wings. The California pizza flatbread, the Parmesan crusted chicken and the sliders.  Our drinks come out, then our food. She came to check up on our table but we were good. California pizza flatbread was great, there's avocado, chicken, cheese, tomato... It was pretty simple and good. I love chicken wings so they're always good to me. Sliders were good just cheese, meat, and bread, couldn't ask for ketchup because we finished our meal already. My sister always order the Parmesan crusted chicken, so I'm assuming it's really good to her.  Over the food was good. But our server never came back. Usually when you're busy I totally understand, but when you notice that all of our food was gone, you'd come back to check up on us. But she was in the back the whole time, she couldn't have noticed our empty plates. I wanted to order dessert too! It was our birthday, we wanted a pizookie. I was so irritated.  Honestly I'd come back because I do like their food, but the service disappointed me. It wasn't even busy."
Andi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,47,148,5.0,8/25/2015,"Everything was perfect. Server nice, hh drink excellent. Tuesday all wine 50%. Food tasty. Ambience really nice. Love it. Can wait to go back here. We came back today tfor more. Once again they serve us good, food deliz. And if you have extra money don't forget to oder their desert. Very good. We ordered trio pazookie.  Be all agreed the best one was the trio something. Check it out guys. 1 more thing for those who doesn't know about the 20 %discount, ask the server. What you need just download their app. After that just ask the server. Have fun guys. One more thing. Don't oder the slider during happy hour. The meat was burn and look likes frozen."
Carolyn S.,"Sacramento, CA",4,2,,1.0,6/5/2017,"Worst experience I've ever had.  It took bjs 2 1/2 hours to cook our order for 2 entrees.  Eat24 was extremely helpful trying to get our order delivered.  They even refunded us the delivery fee, even though it was bjs fault.  Will never order from bjs again."
Jen N.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,18,159,5.0,2/8/2015,"I know what you are thinking: ""Why are you reviewing a chain restaurant? This is Yelp; we must remain pretentious foodies!"" BJ's has always been a big favorite of mine for cheap yet still decent quality foods; basically, it's a college student's Mecca. Ok, fine, I get it Jeremy Stoppelman, you can afford better. But for the rest of us who aren't social media CEOs, BJ's is the place to go for a classically fun and loud environment, good food, and fantastic deals and coupons you just can't pass up. And the best part is how shareable food is. No longer do you have to shoot the death glare at your friend for taking a slice of your pizza! Bring your friends and try the Best Beginnings appetizer combo, a sampler of the most popular appetizers. This BJ's location in particular blew me away with their outstanding service. My friend requested to not have ranch on her buffalo chicken pizza  (yes, I did remind her of how crazy she was), but the message seemed to get lost. Oh well, since my friend's not allergic, she was going to handle it.  The manager came out to speak to us and asked for our names. We all practically excreted in our pants at this moment, scared that we committed a crime we weren't aware of (how most of us feel around cops). Then he bent down on one knee, deeply apologized for their mistake, and asked for forgiveness. He hooked her up with free salad and Pizookie Trio.  I really can't complain. Someone owning up to their mistake before even the receiver can talk about it! Almost unheard of in California, but I'm glad this chain restaurant still can offer great service. Thank you!"
L S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,51,2,5.0,11/14/2016,Great service for our free meal on Veterans Day. Appreciate the hospitality for a meal given to us!
Taylor W.,"Patterson, CA",70,8,,3.0,12/16/2016,Hosts were very rude. Walked in and they told us to sit near the bar. I said I didn't want to sit there but they insisted on me seating myself. I asked them to seat me in the main eating area but they were too busy with their conversation. Eventually sat where I wanted (they did their job). Service was really good besides the host.
Alyssa E.,"Sacramento, CA",1,5,,5.0,12/11/2016,"I have been here a few times now and have always enjoyed my experience. It is a fine dining establishment with a relaxing atmosphere. The employees are all nice and knowledgeable about their ever changing menu.  The flatbread is a must. I always get one to share.  The crisp crust and fresh ingredients will make these a highlight of the meal.  I normally get a seasonal entree. I have had butternut soup, seasonal salads, seared ahi and the ever popular braised tacos.  The tacos are not quite traditional, but ever so tasty. Think of a savory braised beef rib in a delicious taco shell. The meat is melt in your mouth goodness.  They also have a full bar and a great wine list."
