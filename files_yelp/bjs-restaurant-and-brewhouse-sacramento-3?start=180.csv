Ashley P.,"Roseville, CA",2,23,,2.0,7/13/2016,"I come here super often with coworkers and friends.   For the most part, I've always had good service.  I typically sit in the bar and get a lot of the same servers.  My experience tonight was so disappointing.  Our server seemed to always forget about us.  We would have to flag him down for anything we needed.  I assumed he was just super busy so I didn't take it personally.  But when we let him know we were going to step outside to smoke and that we wanted to let him know we weren't leaving and not paying, he responded saying if we did we needed to leave a card with him.  It just felt very insulting especially because of  the service we had received.  Joshua our server was so cold and I hated feeling like I was some teenager trying to dine and ditch.  I spend quite a bit of money here and after tonight I'm reconsidering that."
Theresa T.,"Sacramento, CA",7,3,,1.0,2/28/2017,"Let me just start off by saying that I was a big fan of Bjs until my last visit, the food and service is normally stellar but my most recent visit was awful.I was at the restaurant with my family on Friday night, our food arrived and we did not have any utensils and so we asked our waitress to bring some out to us. She seemed busy and was taking longer than desired to bring them so I asked another server for some in the meantime. His response was "" Oh, you didn't bring your chopsticks with you?"". You guessed it, my family and I are Asian-Americans. This statement is not only racist, but deplorable and should in no way be tolerated by the establishment. Our utensils were eventually brought to us and our food was great, but the second server's disgusting comment left a bad taste in my mouth. I will unfortunately no longer by attending this location, ignorant behavior like that should not be tolerated."
Esther S.,"Kapolei, HI",56,57,99,5.0,3/8/2016,"This review is long overdue. I called to make a reservation for party of 30 a month in advance. I spoke with Olivia and she was great. Very friendly and professional. She gave me the names of the 2 managers and confirmed everything. She even got approval for our party to have the happy hour prices which was very cool.  When we arrived our table was ready. They had a good variety of pizza and beer. I feel really bad for taking so long to write this review because I'm not certain the name of our waitress. I believe it was Johanna...but could be mistaken. She was awesome. She had a very calm demeanor and did a wonderful job as our waitress. It's not easy serving a big party. Having a big family, we often eat out with a party of 15 and often times you can see and sense the frustration of waiters/waitresses when asking for things. But not once did she seem overwhelmed, which I'm sure she may have very well been. She always had a smile and checked often if we needed anything. Her service was greatly appreciated. Overall, had a great experience with this restaurant and location. So thank you to everyone who made it a success. And we will definitely return whenever we're in town."
Luella O.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,4.0,4/27/2017,"We were seated in about 5 to 10 minutes, service was great. The baby back ribs were tender and tasty. The meal came with two side dishes, a salad any a mini pazooki. What more can you ask for?"
Emily W.,"Sacramento, CA",63,21,,2.0,9/10/2017,"Well my visit here tonight was a bust. I went with my friend this evening and when we put in our name we were told it should only be about ten minutes. After thirty minutes we decided we should check seeing as all of the people who had come in after us were already seated. As it turns out they forgot to put in our name. Accidents happen and we were promptly seated. Our server immediately came up and introduced himself and took our drink orders (just water since we had not yet had a chance to glance over the menu) which he quickly returned with. A few minutes later a gentleman turned up with two more waters looking confused at the water already sitting on the table, it was obvious there had been a miscommunication somewhere. Oh well, four waters isn't a problem, it's important to stay hydrated right? Then another gentleman (the only reason I gave two stars and not one) showed up to take our order and explained he was filling in for our server. We ordered an appetizer and a pizza. Our original server brought out the appetizer but no plates. We waited and waited. I finally had to go hunt down plates myself. When I returned our pizza was being dropped and then finally plates. I felt terrible when the ""fill in"" server saw our untouched (and now cold) appetizer and pizza and apologized for them coming out at the same time after we had requested the appetizer first. I explained he was not at fault and we dug into our cold avocado egg rolls where my friend immediately found an avocado belly button. We tried to laugh it off but it was getting harder to do so by this point. Next the pizza. It didn't have any sauce on it. We explained to our server that it was dry and didn't appear to have sauce and he offered ranch dressing. No apology. No offer to remake it. We ate one price and decided it was time for dessert. They can't possibly mess up a pizooki right? WRONG. It was hot dough. Mush topped with ice cream. We couldn't finish it. That was a first."
Ashley P.,"Sacramento, CA",5,9,1,2.0,2/12/2016,"I have always been a fan of BJ's Brewhouse, but I will never go to the one at the Arden location again! My husband and I were extremely disappointed with our experience. We went there at 6:30 PM last Friday night. It was pretty busy, but we were told we could sit in the bar where there were open booths and tables. We sat down and it took several minutes before anyone came to us, which we figured it was OK because it was a Friday night. A server with a blond ponytail finally came with menus and I immediately ordered our drinks because she seemed like she was in a rush; however, she went to the next table where she must have known the people because she took her time to talk to them for a few minutes. It was close to 10 minutes before we received our drinks and our server passed by us a few times without saying anything. When the drinks finally came she made a remark about the wait being over and looked like she was about to take off again, so my husband quickly told her that we wanted to order our food. My salad came out first, but my husband's Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts appetizer did not come out for a while. When they did, they were charred and burnt to the point that they disintegrated in your mouth. We've gotten this dish before and the brussels sprouts should still be green and intact, unlike these ones that were burnt to a crisp. After that, our server was nowhere to be found. My husband finally asked another server to take back the dish and to please get us a new one that wasn't so burnt. After a while our server came back with the Brussels Sprouts, rolled her eyes and said ""Here you go. These should be better"", but they looked like the same exact dish! The server took off before we could say anything. We decided to enjoy our pizza instead (which wasn't all that great), but knew I did not want to pay for these brussels sprouts because they were no better than the last one. When we were done with our pizza we waited a while for server to come back, but she was nowhere to be found. Our drinks had also been empty for quite some time so by the time she came to check on us my husband was irritated and asked for a box and the bill. She brought us our bill, saw that we had two slices of pizza left and said ""gee I guess you didn't really need a box"" and walked away. Ready to leave, I checked our bill which charged us for BOTH of the Brussels Sprouts dishes.  At this point I got up and asked the front hostess if we could speak to the manager. We explained to the manager that we weren't happy with the dish and that our server was constantly disappearing. He apologized and said that the dish was one of his favorites and that it shouldn't look anything like that. He let us know that he would talk to the cook and that we would not have to pay either dish. He took our plates then our server came out with the revised check and was clearly annoyed that we spoke to her manager. Before I could even reach for my card she hurried off. We waited for her to collect our payment, but she was once again nowhere to be found, so we flagged down the manager. My husband mentioned that we could never find the sever when we needed her and that she seemed annoyed every time she did come by our table. He apologized again and rang up our bill. My husband was so irritated with the experience that he went to wait outside while I signed my receipt. As I got up from the booth the server finally came back and gave me a very fake smile which I did not return. We appreciated the manager's diligence, assisting us with our bill, and for taking responsibility; however, the food and service were so poor that we will not return. I really hope he spoke to the server too. I'm not going to blame her for everything that happened, since the kitchen burnt our food, but we were never rude to her nor did we do anything to cause her to treat us like she did. Maybe she was having a bad night, but I have worked in customer service for many years and know that you need to keep your personal issues away from the work place, especially when you are working to get a tip. All in all, we were very unhappy with the experience."
Gabe R.,"Sacramento, CA",38,65,6,3.0,9/10/2016,"Meh, ok if you're in dire need of sustenance and happen to be in the area. The food is not really that good, I had a Caprese sandwich which resembled a microwaved pizza pocket. Wedge salad looked like it was thrown together quickly and was a sloppy mess, but tasted ok (even though it had the wrong lettuce for a wedge salad). The service was good, very friendly and accommodating. Good beer selection too. Atmosphere is really loud though, couldn't even hear what the person next to me was saying. I won't return unless I have to."
Eddy A.,"Rio Linda, CA",4,64,5,4.0,5/2/2016,"Very busy place Saturday night, but we had a great server, a young tall black gal that took good care of us 4. Now, the lousy news, I had the Mahi-Mahi with shrimp and it was dry and boring. Not something I would order again. I would  have dropped the stars to 3 if it weren't the excellent service. Cheers All!"
Ariel G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/28/2016,My husband ordered a pizza for curbside. It took them 40 minutes to bring out the food. My husband spoke with the manager and all he did to compensate our loss of time was offer him a cheap dessert as if that would give us out 40 minutes back. We've eaten at this location before. The service inside is terrible. This is slowest restaurant we have ever been to. Dinning at bj's will cost you 3 hours of your time and mediocre cold or burnt food.
K C.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,9,,4.0,5/12/2017,"I'd give this place 3.5, but I'll round up to four. There are some pretty good weekly/happy hour specials. Normally I would think the food is a little overpriced for the quality, but if you take advantage of the specials it's pretty decent. Service is always just fine, too. Good place to get buzzed up and eat some alright/good pub food."
Shane K.,"North Highlands, CA",90,96,82,4.0,8/13/2016,"every single BJs i have went to was always a great positive experience. at this Arden Mall location we enjoyed the server and i was a little bit in bewilderment not being able to see the Olympics on the TV screens.  anyways, I had the pasta which was mediocre to me..The pizzas and drinks are very tasty i must say that! will go again.  The bathrooms are clean, stylish and small. I love the vibe there which is young hip and family all at once. the dark wood is a nice elegant touch."
Lee D.,"Sacramento, CA",7,71,899,4.0,4/6/2016,"Got the Alabama sunkiss, pepperoni & clam chowder, steak & mash and fries and meat lover panini? All good just pricey for the portion typical of place like this."
Sharon C.,"Yuba City, CA",0,22,33,4.0,5/8/2016,A gem in the mall. Jeremiah Red is an American treasure. Tried the Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were fantastic. I recommend trying it if yoy like pitas. Server forgot my salad but redeemed herself by not charging me for it after promptly getting the order in and to me.
Dacia G.,"Union City, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/15/2017,Their deep dish pizza is to die for!!!! That accompanied with a chocolate chip pizookie makes up te perfect meal.
Angelica C.,"San Francisco, CA",267,38,52,2.0,7/16/2016,"Came to bjs for a late dinner after the Cali state fair. Ordered clam chowders for me but it was barely warm when it came out so it tasted weird. So did the broccoli cheddar my bf ordered. The Bjs clam chowder in concord and Vacaville were better. We were trying to get ahold of our waiter to order pizookies but she was nowhere to be found until we saw her a couple tables down chatting it up with other servers. When she did walk by, we asked her how long it would take to bring out a pizookie she said 5-7 minutes. We asked because it was 30 min till closing time and we didn't want to give the kitchen a hard time for putting in last minute order. And yup pizookie didn't come till closing:("
Kristin F.,"Sacramento, CA",156,90,148,5.0,9/11/2015,"I've been to this BJ's for a lot of meals, including last night for dinner! The staff is always very friendly here and the restaurant is clean. There's usually only 2 of us, so we never have to wait long to be seated.  Last night, my boyfriend and I partook in the 2 for $25 deal. You get 2 salads (I got a wedge, him a house), a medium deep dish pizza, and a pizzokie for $25! Great value! They even let you half and half the pizza, so I got the Spicy Hawaiin Chicken and he got the Extreme Pepperoni. Both were great! For dessert: an original Pizzokie. Fantastic, as always.  This location also has a decent happy hour which extends to 7 instead of 5 or 6 like other places. They have good cheap eats and I recommend a $5.00 Strawberry Mohito to drink!"
Angie O.,"Woodland, CA",30,41,23,4.0,11/19/2015,"This particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is one of my favorite because it is pretty much attached to the Arden Fair Mall. I usually like to end my shopping with a nice meal from BJ's, and I've made it kind of routine at this point. Obviously, BJ's is a chain restaurant. That ALONE will deter your average hipster from giving this place a visit but it's really one the few chains I continue to visit, and for good reasons.  Their menu is extensive. I'm a fan of simpler menu's, but I like that there is something for everyone (salads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, steak, etc.) and they have really expanded on their enLIGHTened (healthier) menu options. The pizza here is pretty good, I really like that they have thin crust options and you can also ""build your own"" pizza. Their sandwiches are also yummy and I would suggest you get Wedge Cut Fries with any burger or sandwich because they are seriously a better choice. They have a large selection of Brews (hence the name) and I love that every season they have a variety of season-inspired drinks.   Service. It can be hit or miss but for the most part it is average. Average as in attentive but not annoying, informative but not pushy. I've had both good and mediocre experiences with service but never a bad one, so I'd say that's a plus. TIP: If the host or hostess seat you in a spot where you don't want to sit, speak up, they usually have no problem with letting you sit where you want, and won't give you that sarcastic ""SURE"" (that is a big PLUS, for me)  Ambiance- Casual. It can get loud but not bothersome. The #1 reason I keep coming back: THOSE PZOOKIES!!. A warm delicious cookie of your choice topped with creamy Ice Cream?? Delicious!! My favorite Pzookies are the White Chocolate Macademia, or the original Chocolate Chip! Perfect way to end an exhausting shopping trip!"
Margaret L.,"San Ramon, CA",374,566,247,3.0,5/22/2013,"Chain restaurant. Decent pizza. Not amazing but it will satisfy you if you want deep dish. I usually get the deep dish pizza if I come here. I am not a fan of red sauce, and they can substitute it with white sauce. I think the biggest pro of this place is the pizookie. A warmly baked fresh cookie with ice cream on top? I think I may have some! It's delicious. I would recommend the unique flavors like red velvet and the white chocolate raspberry. I am a big fan of the white chocolate raspberry.  Pizookie is such a simple idea. For the bakers out there, they know how easy it is to make cookies and scoop ice cream on top. But when the cookie flavors are more unique, then it's worth it. I came here for the pizookie trio and I left happy. Overall, the food is mediocre. Good happy hour. You can also do bar seating if you don't want to wait. Since this location is at the mall, it's convenient to find and you can go shopping before or afterwards!"
Jessica S.,"HI, HI",0,22,1,3.0,8/23/2016,My husband and I always stop here for dinner when we are visiting family in town. The service is average. The food is a hit and miss.
Annie V.,"San Francisco, CA",269,53,32,4.0,11/22/2014,"I don't come here a lot but I always have a good food experience eating here. We didn't have to wait for a table even though the place was packed. Our waitress was nice too :).  Bison bbq burger - it was a bit dry but then again at 650 calories for a burger you can't expect too much dressing or extra condiments. It has a salsa like topping added into the burger which was a fresh taste to compliment the meat. There was also a side of salad with red onions, lettuce, and more onions. I didn't mind because I love onions :D!  For a total of ~$10 (including tips) it's quality is fair."
