A B.,"San Francisco, CA",8,45,92,1.0,11/29/2015,"So disappointed. Ordered a tortilla soup. Came out cold. Sent it back. The waiter brought back a microwaved lukewarm soup that looked disgusting.  I don't understand why they microwaved a soup, and couldn't bring out a fresh hot soup. The waiter was rude, and did close to nothing to help. Surprised because normally I have good service and great food.  Maybe just bad luck today . . ."
Ala Mode P.,"Union City, CA",0,12,,1.0,2/24/2017,"Food is bland and so ordinary. Nothing special about the food at this restaurant. My son ordered steak, and the steak was too dry. I ordered Spicy Pig Pizza, and there was nothing special about this pizza. In fact, it had an awful smell. This is not the first time I was dissatisfied about the food being served at this restaurant. I don't think I will ever be back at this restaurant. Our bill was $60.00, and I still gave the server a $10 tip although we were not happy. Such a waste of money!!!!!"
Jonathan Y.,"Sacramento, CA",45,20,9,4.0,7/13/2016,Delicious beer and a fantastic waitstaff.  Thanks for a yummy beer with my.baked ziti.  Will do again.
Kalyee J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/20/2017,"I am a huge fan of BJ's! I go there quite often and the service is always great as well as the food. They have plenty of options and have something for everyone. The dessert is wonderful! They have ""pizzookies"" which is a hot cookie (still in it's own mini pan) with melty delicious ice cream on top. It is one of my favorite desserts ever. They have many flavors too though ny favorite is by far the cookies and cream one. It is a cookies and cream cookie with vanilla ice cream and like a cookies and cream mousse/whip cream on top. So good! I wish they took reservations for many times I've had to go somewhere else because the wait is unreasonable."
Raquel N.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,10,6,2.0,1/29/2017,"When I think of BJs restaurant I think of good food and typically good service. Welly friend and I went to lunch the other day and I have to say I only got one thing I was looking for. The food was awesome! Everything came out how we wanted it. But I have to jump the gun and explain why I probably won't be going back.  When we got seated I over heard out server was supposed to be going home. Fine, I get wanting to go home after a long day. He took our order after seeming way more involved in all his other tables. It was almost as if he didn't want to take us because he was supposed to be going home and we are younger women. Our good came out very promptly and everything way right. We asked for a couple little things that were forgotten, no big deal. But then when we were almost done eating things got AWKWARD! My friend and I are catching up so we were probably talking a little loud, but the staff started having a full argument not even 3 feet away from us. Staff start blaming each other and the manager was involved. People saying they are going to call out because the didn't get the day off. I get having disagreements and needing to hash things out. But seriously right in front of us? It could have happened in a place more appropriate. It was so distracting we had stopped our conversation because the argument was vocal enough to were we had forgotten what we were talking about. So we patiently waited for them to be done so we could ask for boxes. But instead our waiter stormed off and once again ignored us. We asked a different waiter, paid our ticket and got out as soon as possible.  I have never had such an awkward restaurant experience. I hate the fact that we did because I really liked the food. But servers make of break things in my opinion. And this place didn't make my experience at all."
Raeann K.,"Sacramento, CA",25,51,34,5.0,11/28/2015,"Always a pleasure coming here. The staff is always super friendly and willing to help any way they can. The food is great, the drinks are great. My favorites are their burgers and salads. The pizza is really amazing too. Try their craft sodas, black cherry is super tasty.  There's also a rewards membership you can afk them for, you earn points by eating there you can use towards free food and such."
Mayra T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,4.0,1/28/2017,Always a great meal when I come here. I ordered wings for appetizer and was surprised at how many wings it came with. Overall good experience!
Jen H.,"San Jose, CA",375,165,346,4.0,10/25/2015,"I love the service here! We got a GREAT SERVER who was filled with energy. I think his name was Albert, not too sure though. My friends and I came here on a Thursday night. Some of the dishes we ordered was the portobello mushrom burger, the southern fried chicken, the steak, fish and chips, and the deep dish pizza.  Portobello Mushroom burger - the burger is HUGE !!! Very good portion size. I also recommend the potatoe wedges rather than the thinly cut fries. The wedges tastes a lot better !! But overall the burger was very flavorful and delicious Southern fried chicken - BEST DISH EVER. the chicken wasn't dry and very moist!! Loved the crisp on the outside as well.  Steak - It was decent.... not my favorite. but good for the price since you get two side orders Fish and Chips - it was okay. Nothing special in my opinion. its your typical fish and chips Deep Dish Pizza - I personally didn't taste this one but my friends did. They said it was very flavorful and good but they wished it wasnt so pricey.  Overall, great service and atmosphere. I would come back!  TIP: make a reservation before you come, we had to wait 1.5 hours to get a table!!"
justin s.,"Elk Grove, CA",233,55,17,2.0,11/18/2015,"This place is okay. Food is great but, this place doesn't have that many TV''s and is kind of small and my fork had something on the back of it? I'm not coming back to this place..."
Lawrence K.,"West Hartford, CT",83,107,25,4.0,9/20/2015,"Food is great. Lots of options. Love their traditional wings. Brisket burger is also a good choice. Have also previously tried their Caesar salad and tomato soup and both were great. My only complaint is it sometimes takes forever to be seated. I waited 15 to 20 mins today and nobody came to help seat me or any of the others in line, even after we asked for some assistance."
Julie K.,"Sacramento, CA",2,122,32,2.0,5/2/2016,"So, my friend and I did the curbside pick up  I ordered the club sandwich and request that there be no cheese or sauce Guess what I found? Cheese.  I hate cheese, but luckily my sandwich got cold within the 10 minute drive and I was able to peel it off easily. Another thing that really bothered and worried me was how they deal with credit card purchases. They don't have a portable machine, but rather run back inside with your card to make the transaction. I felt very uncomfortable because what if she pulled a Starbucks on me? (You know how that one Starbucks employee stole a customers credit card info and used it to buy junk) So two stores for messed up order, like they usually always seem to do, and for suspicious ring up"
Erick G.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",2,19,2,5.0,12/17/2015,Good service and good selection of beer! I like that we can order ahead of time with the app and they take Apple Pay. Cool spot to chill with some friends and drink up. The employees are pretty chill for the most part.
Henry C.,"Woodland, CA",46,111,63,4.0,12/16/2015,"This is my first time at the Arden location, the other times we have gone have been to the Natomas location. Although it was a busy Saturday night, we enjoyed our time here. We LOVE LOVE LOVE their Mediterranean pizza!!   We took some out of town friends here and they also loved the food! Although I prefer Natomas over Arden, this is one tasty restaurant!!! Both places have awesome personnel working for them ! If you haven't been to a BJ's, you must go try them!"
Jamie P.,"Sacramento, CA",1,3,2,5.0,12/10/2015,It was great the burgers and fries were delicious. I'm definitely coming back to this place when I go  ou again. Filled me up for the rest of the day.
May S.,"Vallejo, CA",195,74,113,1.0,2/28/2016,"I don't usually complain, but people need to know about this place. My friend was visiting from LA and we were both craving pizza, so we decided to come here. I've always loved BJs until now. We order the BJs favorite. Our waitress was a golden blonde Caucasian woman with a pony tail. She did not introduce herself and she seemed to have a lot of attitude. I'm not sure what her deal was but the way she was responding to my friend, whom is African American, did not seem pleasant. As soon as the food came out, she dropped our pizza on the tray stand like a total B and walked away without asking if we needed anything else like a normal waitress does. I was so taken back by her rude demeanor. I would never come here again or recommend this place!"
Sac M.,"Sacramento, CA",39,180,426,5.0,7/3/2015,Like most locations this is another good one great food great service coo drinks one of my favorite places I'm such a regular here u can't go wrong here
Rhonda L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/20/2017,We tried the food but it wasn't that good to me and servers was not very friendly.. Wouldn't go here again or would not refer none of my friends to go to this place..
Susan S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,27,4,4.0,6/18/2016,"this is a great restaurant, although during busy times it can get noisy.  The servers are wonderful and the food is really good and has a big menu.  One of my favorites is the deep fried artichoke hearts.  Yum!"
Aubree S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/1/2015,"Grosss . I loved it here till the day I had lasagna and the meat was like the meat they have on frozen pizza. Ya know those lil balls of sausage and the square prices of pepperoni . I thought they cooked their food not defrosted.. unfortunate they lost loyal customers. And the time before this I found hair in my avacado egg rolls . Thats how you know I loved it .. I went back after that haha . I tried   the lasagna and ""chefs "" failed me. These prices id expect fresh.. its not fast food it shouldn't be frozen.. or have that cheap of meat just leave the meat out."
Amanda D.,"Sacramento, CA",35,4,,1.0,7/14/2017,If I could leave zero stars I would. Ordered drinks from the bar and an appetizer. got our food 15 min later and no drinks. My husband asked several people still no drinks. My husband finally had to go get the manager who finally came back with drinks and an apology. He said they were going to comp us dessert and was very apologetic. Waitress came back and apologized and told us dessert was on them our dessert is a cookie with ice cream you choose the flavor or 2 flavors and split it. We ate our food and my drink went down rather quickly and when she came to ask if we wanted anything else I asked for a soda. Never got the soda told her to give the cookie and ice cream to our kids at their table. I found their service to be extremely shitty and I will never go back there. I couldn't wait to get home so I could get something to drink. My husband left her a $5 dollar tip I told him to leave nothing. I have gotten better service at a fast food joint then I got at this restaurant. Never again!
