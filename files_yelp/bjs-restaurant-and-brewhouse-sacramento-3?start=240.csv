Gabriel C.,"Sacramento, CA",299,58,49,5.0,9/13/2015,"I always love coming here. Great food, drinks, and desserts! The staff is always super friendly and welcoming. Their happy hour is to die for. Come and enjoy the great atmosphere!"
Jennifer R.,"Redding, CA",14,67,50,5.0,5/13/2016,The service we received yesterday was great. We ordered a pizza to start off with and it was like the server read my mind by bringing ranch to the table. The Cesar salad I ordered tasted like it had been sitting in the back for awhile. The server immediately grabbed it and said he would take care of it but before he went off to do that he ASKED if I wanted the same or different salad. I thought that the way he asked was very thoughtful. I was happy with the new Cesar salad he brought back. My nephew dropped a water we had at the table and he quickly grabbed a rag to help clean up. Wish I could remember the servers name. Overall we had a great experience.
Nicki C.,"Yuba City, CA",0,14,5,5.0,5/1/2015,Megan was AMAZING! Very sweet and on top of it. Best service we have had at a BJ's. We will be back for her friendly red headed smiles and great service!
Amy H.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/15/2017,So first off I really love BJ's but as a mall employee who works over nights my experience with pick up the last 4 or 5 times have been horrible. I order my good always like an hour before and I go on my lunch which is only half hour long and then I stand around waiting and waiting and waiting and no one helps me. Tonight I ordered my lunch I went in at 9 to pick up. My sandwich was ready but I had to wait 15 minutes for a house salad to be made. As I got there it took about 3 minutes to even have someone ask if I've been helped it took another 5 minutes for someone to let me know it would be a couple minutes and there were about 5 workers standing in the take out area talking with another girl who I believe works there and it took another 10 minutes to finally get my good. And I get back to my store which is at Arden mall to find out that I was then missing soemthing in my order and it was to late to go back or to call. As a mall employee I am highly disappointed in the service I received.
Michelle L.,"Sacramento, CA",795,718,4372,4.0,4/14/2015,"Came in for dinner as part of a fundraiser for Food Literacy Center (15% of food sales) and tried the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi entree off of the enlightened menu.  Oven roasted, glazed mahi‑mahi served over stir‑fried veggies and roasted pineapple fried rice, mixed with a soy-ginger sauce. Topped with slivered snow peas, red bell peppers and sesame seeds. Was pretty tasty! Of course after having a ""'light"" entrée, I skipped appetizers and beer and instead shared a mini Pizookie trio with the rest of the table. No more red velvet flavor but we did get salted caramel, chocolate chip, and triple chocolate. Yummy. There's a BJ's closer to me in Natomas, or Elk Grove, depending on where I find myself, but it was nice to have a non-pizza option (although the flatbreads looked pretty good too)."
Sara B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",174,170,142,5.0,2/1/2014,"We stopped by BJ's on a Wednesday afternoon after doing some shopping. It was just our luck that they happened to have $5.95 lunch specials going on. I ordered their Enlightened Chicken Tacos (corn tortillas filled with fajita marinated chicken breast, topped with cabbage, Baja sauce and pico de gallo; served with black beans and a tangy slaw of shredded cabbage and jalapeño pickled carrots and onions.) It was pretty busy inside for a week day, so we decided to sit at the bar. Our food seriously seemed like it took forever to come out and by the time it did, I was starving! One look at my plate and I felt disappointed because my tacos looked tiny, like street tacos style! But, they always say when you're hungry your eyes are bigger than your stomach and that proved to be true. For lunch, I felt these tacos ended up being the perfect size. They were savory and had a really nice flavor to them; I especially liked the Baja sauce that was inside. As for the shredded cabbage, it didn't really taste ""tangy"" to me and I couldn't pick up on the the taste of the jalapeño pickled carrots and onions.  The side of black beans and the few chips it came with were a nice touch. I left BJ's feeling quite satisfied and loving that my meal only cost $5.95."
Karen T.,"Elk Grove, CA",603,213,1092,4.0,7/20/2014,"My friends and I came here after the California State Fair since it was nearby and didn't close until late. The place was still fairly busy when we arrived around 1100PM. I ordered a peachberry iced tea mocktail that was pretty darn yummy. For my main meal, I tried the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon which I really enjoyed! The glaze for the salmon was sweet and was paired with tangy flavored couscous. Slightly odd combination for my taste buds, but I enjoyed it overall since the meal was ""light"" (as opposed to a ""heavy"" pasta) yet was still very filling. For dessert, I shared the Cookies 'n' Cream pizookie with 3 other people which was the bomb! I love BJ's pizookies and Cookies 'n' Cream is now definitely my favorite one! Service was a little unattentive, but it looked like our waiter was covering a lot of other tables during our time there. Not too shabs."
Lynette D.,"Sacramento, CA",3,94,9,4.0,3/29/2016,"So on Easter, our family came here and I had a wonderful omelet. It was so delicious and the salsa that they have there is fantastic.  We had excellent service. My son had spaghetti and he loved it. The best part of all was watching people trying to open the door to Arden Fair Mall (closed for Easter).  It was hilarious to see people get angry or large families milling around like they were completely lost!"
Jennifer T.,"Davis, CA",26,57,102,4.0,5/19/2014,"Came here for a friends farewell party with about 30 people!  The staff at BJ were very accommodating with our party.  We had multiple waitress to take orders, refill drinks, and check in on us.  For a really large group they were very patient and calm.  Atmosphere at BJs is nice, kinda dim though.  Place is lively, lots of people chatting.   Okay now back to the main reason for this review, the food!  I heard BJs were famous for their pizzas, so I got the hand-tossed ""BJs Favorite"" pizza.  On the pizza was housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives and white onions.  So much meat!  I really enjoyed the pizza.  The individual size is definitely filling!!  If you are a meat lover, try this pizza.  I enjoyed the hand-toss pizza because there wasn't too much dough.  It was really crispy.  A few of my friends got the deep dish pizza, but it looked more like a thick crusted pizza, not a true deep dish pizza.   The pizza was kinda pricey though, but it is kinda expected for a restaurant like this.  I probably won't come here if I was craving a pizza because I can go to other places for cheaper, but it would be nice to come here once in a while for a nicer experience."
Jessica B.,"San Leandro, CA",69,229,65,4.0,5/13/2015,"Came in a group of 7 for a birthday dinner around 6 on a Thursday. I was dreading it because of my horrible experiences at BJs in a large party at other locations, but this was not the case at this BJs.  Our service was great... I wish I got the name of the waiter but he was really good and patient with our large, indecisive party.  For being the middle of a dinner rush- our dinner came out pretty quick."
Andrew B.,"Plumas Lake, CA",1,6,,1.0,6/28/2016,Go to the BJ's in Roseville. The Arden location has horrible service and the food doesn't taste as good as the Roseville restaurant. Our server was slow and had a dirty shirt on.
Anthony C.,"Sacramento, CA",9,3,,5.0,12/4/2015,Great food. I had the ribs was best I've had ina while.. wife had the steak was a little bland but was still great with some a1. Waiters are friendly and got seated fast for beeIng by a Friday.. drinks never left empty. For the ammount of food the prices where great. kid got the kids pizza was big thick and soft. Tasted good. We will defiantly come back again. Forgot.I had there chillie. Was awsome.
Alyssa Mae C.,"Sacramento, CA",33,249,35,4.0,6/24/2015,"Consistently good!  I might order the soup and salad to stay on the lighter side, but I always steal a bunch of yummy string fries from my husband's massive double deluxe burger dish ;) Birthday pizookies are awesome, too!"
Gena S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,15,3.0,5/16/2016,"I am updating my review because before we left, the manager came up to us.  We didn't call him over or anything, he was following up on the salad he had heard about from the cook manager.  He tried to make it right by offering us a gift card to come back and try the restaurant.  We will try it again with the card in hopes that it is better.  The not only 1 but 2 servers we had that night still were horrible though."
Dionne T.,"Sacramento, CA",206,110,1013,3.0,6/11/2015,"Came here on Sunday nite to celebrate the MILs Bday.  We all ordered our own pizzas.....that's our typical order when coming to BJs.  I went w/the Chicken Bacon Ranch which was tasty.  MIL had never eaten at BJs before (how can that be??) so she went w/a custom order pizza w/mushrooms, asparagus, & one other topping.....chicken perhaps?  She said it was good but the asparagus was a bit hard.  Now the hubs.......who's favorite pizza is a bacon cheeseburger pizza: bacon w/ground beef.  So, ground beef technically isn't a listed topping, altho I think it used to be.  Anyways, he knows that they have sirloin for their burgers & at some locations they will use that meat & put it on his pizza.  However, some locations do not.  On this particular occasion, my hubby asked (because they've done so at this location in the past) but was disappointed when told he wouldn't be able to order it.  VERY upset & quite disappointed that he had to order pepperoni instead.  He was not a happy camper, to say the least.  All-in-all, the food was still quite yummy, as per usual. We also ordered their triple pazookie platter for dessert.  You can't go wrong when ordering a pazookie.  & For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, let me edge-ah-muh-cate you on it real quick.  Basically you get a freshly baked, still in the cooking dish, warm & gooey cookie topped w/a scoop of ice cream!  Dessert doesn't get much better than that.  They have a variety of cookie types to choose from: I went w/the white chocolate chip & macadamia nut.  I think the others in my party chose chocolate chip & triple chocolate, which is a chocolate cookie w/chocolate chips.  My MIL, who ordered the chocolate chip cookie requested chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla.  When the pazookies arrived to our table, they were VERY gooey....in fact, I'd say they were basically uncooked in the center.  Not really what you should expect, as the cookie really should be cooked all the way through.  Even though the cookie was not cooked all the way, who doesn't love eating cookie dough?  Which means I still ate it all up!! Overall, the food was good.  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar either.  I would still come here occasionally, but the hubby said he doesn't think he'll come to this location anymore.....mostly due to the no ground beef on his pizza thing."
Paula J.,"Paso Robles, CA",115,17,15,1.0,5/11/2016,"Waitress was good, but we have never had such over cooked calamari!! Chewy and hard... Nasty!"
Midtown L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,14,,1.0,2/17/2015,"I've always been pleased with this place as a go to spot for drinks and late night appetizers.  They definitely have that down to a 'T'.  I think I'll avoid it as an option for a full on dinner, though. Went in on a Wednesday for a birthday.  We were put at a super tiny table for six people.  With all of the advertising stuff they have on the tables, there really isn't any room to put anything.  We brought two bottles of wine with us.  The server  asks if we brought a wine opener. (Yeah, no).  A couple minutes later she returns with a wine key and glasses.  I'm thinking she is going to open our wine for us.  Nope.  She just hands my boyfriend the wine key and says ""here ya go!"" and walks away.   We ended up opening the bottles ourselves which, heads up to management, I think might be border-line illegal...? Even if it isn't, I can open my own wine at home and not be charged a $7 corkage fee.   Once the food came, everyone's but mine came out.  When I asked her about it she went to go check.  She came back about 5 minutes later stating that it would be about 5 more minutes because the kitchen ran out of pasta.  Having work in a restaurant, myself, I know that was pretty much code for ""I forgot to ring in your food, but I'm going to blame it on the kitchen so you don't think it's my fault and hopefully save my tip"". My food finally came about 10 awkward minutes later. It was tasty, but nothing to write home about.   Like I said, great for late night snacks and drinks at the bar.  Sit down restauraunt? I'll probably head next door to Seasons 52."
Alexandra R.,"Sacramento, CA",59,158,184,4.0,6/21/2015,We go to BJ's often because they have great food.  We usually have good service at the Arden location too!   We walked into the restaurant and decided to sit in the bar area because there was a wait for the restaurant.  We tried to order some beers but they were our of the one we wanted so the server brought us a taste of something similar.  I thought that was a nice thing for him to do.   We ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer and I had the ahi tuna salad.  The avocado egg rolls were really good but the ahi tuna was just alright.  I enjoyed the salad part!   We will continue to come back to this location because of the great beer selection and delicious food.
Brian T.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",74,26,,3.0,8/23/2015,"First time at this particular location. The staff was very upfront from the time we were seating that they were in the middle of a shift change, and that bar items would be delayed slightly because they were backed up, as they told our table and every table around us (new tables and guests in the middle of their meal). Ordered a layered beer, and when it arrived I couldn't tell if the two beers had been poured incorrectly and instantly mixed together... or if only the darker beer had been poured by itself. Sent the beer back, ordered another craft beer and it tasted flat. Finished it and ordered a different craft beer and enjoyed it. My food was delicious (chicken pizza). My wife's fish and chips tasted over done, and her ""crispy"" fries were soggy. Server remained very attentive and checked in on us frequently. I'd be willing to try the location again and hope the couple of things were just due to an off night."
Emily M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,4.0,12/2/2016,"I always order BJ's on my lunch break because it's fast and convenient. Today I ordered online about 20 mins before my lunch. Got to the takeout area and my order hadn't even been started or showing up on the computer. The girl working, Abby, said that it does happen a lot from ordering online. She quickly took my order, asked if I needed anything to drink while I waited and sincerely apologized. I just wanted to give her a shout out because I was about to say never mind on the order but she really went out of her way to get me my food quickly! Thanks Abby! :)"
