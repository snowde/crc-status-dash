Maybeline C.,"Sacramento, CA",37,140,88,4.0,3/14/2016,"This is my spot for some late night pizookies ! I usually come here at night with friends to just eat and catch up since its a good place for a late night dining with friends. I like there clam chowder bread bowls, deep dish pizzas, and the flat breads a lot. My favorite flat bread is the california club because its so good and the size is pretty decent whether its being ordered as an appetizer for the whole table or a light entree for yourself. They also have a lot of other different types of flat breads to choose from too. The deep dish pizzas are also really good too especially the chicken bacon ranch one! The service at night is okay, its just that they're not as attentive since i think theres less workers at night but its still good. My favorite part is the pizookie because its so good especially when they had the red velvet one! Overall this is a pretty decent place to dine and hangout with friends."
Cassie B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",15,47,39,1.0,9/3/2016,"I've been here on previous occasions and had great service.. came in last night and I was dressed down, probably should've just went with take out.. The server treated my table like he wasn't getting tipped, probably because the way we ""looked"". Ordered an appetizer with waters... then we ordered food after the fact.. food came out burger was fresh, the chicken club and fries were cold and stale.....and the appetizer was no where to be found. they bring the appetizer and we send back the chicken club sandwich... Came time for the bill & we were charged two chicken club sandwiches on it. The manager at the time just said sorry, they removed one of the two chicken club sandwiches, and went about her day.. stood there for minutes before someone in my party started yelling to get some service so we could do the right thing, pay and leave. The general manager received a call today... Nick handled it well and just heard me out. He offered a comp/gift card, plot twist it's not about the money it's about the concept that we were discriminated against because the way we looked. Keep your comp card, I'll pay for what we received, but you will lose my business. and hopefully yours too. If you don't look like you're gonna tip go somewhere and get consistent service across the board."
Cecilia T.,"Galt, CA",2,4,2,2.0,11/16/2015,"I enjoy BJ's for their Happy Hour special (2pm-5pm)...Their Mojitos, Lemon Drop, and dark selection of beer are great, plus decent appetizers. However, coming in here at any other time is disatisfying.  It had been a while since I had visited, and my morning work meeting had just ended; my coworker and I were starving. Decided to come in for their ""Weekend Brunch"" ...worse idea ever. My food took foooreveeerrr to come. French toast was small, eggs and sausage cold, and wasn't offered a second Mimosa (still delicious) until I was ready to leave. Waitress was friendly, but more occupid with other guests. The meal and experience wasn't worth the $16.00."
Meraje S.,"Vacaville, CA",9,36,30,1.0,12/28/2015,"Negative 5 stars! I wish I could rate negative stars on here.... Worst service ever... Even the manager Amy or Aimee is rude and had no customer service skills...  She basically told me and my friends we were lying... I always come to this location and usually it's ok. But this time we for this server (male) don't know his name but he shouldn't be a server  He was already annoyed with us when we ordered Because we wanted to make changes to our order. Anyway food room forever and it didn't even come out correct. Next they didn't refill our waters and we asked for our check they took forever and we asked for water refills and the check, the server walked by us a few times no refill or check so we decided to get up and go to the front counter and pay.... Which finally the server walked our check up to us and walked away... So no we want to pay and no one is at the register so a lady walks up and she's like ""can I help you"" we said we want to pay and leave and then she asks ""is everything ok, I'm the manager"" And we start to tell her what happen and we tell her we come here all the time which we really do at least 3 times a week... Then the ""manager"" says I'm here 5 days a week and I never see you guys here! What kind of response is that? She's basically is saying we are lying.... And she wants to argue with us... We next said excuse me what did you say we really come in here all the time  Then we ask for her name and aggressively she says Amy! And spells it out for us A-M-Y! I was so disgusted I couldn't believe this was the manager talking to customers like that....  I will not go back here again.... I know bjs is a chain and probably won't read this but I still wanted to let people know what kind of business this and what kind of management they have going on."
W. A.,"Sacramento, CA",2,20,2,1.0,12/26/2015,"I've given this restaurant many chances and all chances have been disappointing. The service sucks beyond belief. We just came back from here. Surprisingly they weren't busy for a Saturday. Got there around 1:30. Took literally 10 minutes before someone came over and greeted me. My husband and daughter joined me. After another 10 minutes our drink order was taken.  Seriously took about another 10 minutes to get mine  and my daughters drink. She told us the beer would be right up.. How hard was it to pout some beer from a tap in a glass? Ok... Whatever. Food took 45 minutes to come out. It's just ridiculous how long they take to greet you, get you drinks, and get you your food. I've never had good service at the Natomas location. That was it.. That was the last chance. With so many other dining options will not be attending this BJ's again."
Amanda C.,"Sacramento, CA",78,2,5,1.0,5/26/2016,"gluten free people: if you avoid gluten, avoid this bj's. they gave me raw cookie dough. they do not know how to cook gluten free food. avoid the stomachache & the shits."
Ryan B.,"Burlington, VT",15,72,1,5.0,1/13/2016,"Love BJ's Brewhouse. Never pass an opportunity to grab a cold beer, and some excellent food, when I'm in the area. Never disappoint."
Mo T.,"Sacramento, CA",85,16,1,1.0,12/28/2015,"I've loved this BJ's for years, and it's always been one of my favorites, me and my cousin frequent this location 2-3 times a week. We stopped going to Elk Grove for the reason of bad service. Soo it all started with our order from the beginning. We asked for extra chicken not a crazy request obviously at a extra charge. Our server didn't seem to like that. So only three waters at a table of four, not logical but maybe the fourth one was coming. Hmm no it wasn't. Let's kindly request. Oh yea I'll get one right now. Few mins goes by i see our server walk by a few times. No water. Hmm okay! One salad comes out all alone without the extra chicken. Maybe it's coming with the other salads, all the other salads roll out no extra chicken and still no water. Server walks by I'm checking on that extra chicken I sarcastically say thanks for the water. Oh I'm sooo sorry I'll bring it out now. He comes back finally with a pitcher to refill the other waters. Hmm excuse me but I have no cup, still no extra chicken we are done eating and now ask for the bill in pure annoyance. 10-15 mins pass with him telling us he is trying to get the extra chicken taken off because only a manager can do it. We are beyond unhappy and go to front to try to pay. Oh sorry sir you can't pay here we will try to get your check. 5 mins past finally a check. We proceed to pay up front. Then a manager by the name of Amy, approaches us and asks us is everything okay? Out of frustration we respond actually it's not. We come here a lot at least 3 times a week. Her response is I work 5 days a week I've never seen you here. Is 3 times a week not enough? Even if it was my first time that is a not a response I expected from someone of a manager position. I then proceeded to ask for her name and she decided to spell it out! A-M-Y or AMIE! Her loud tone of voice and border line screaming was heard to really grasp the exact letters! Wow bad service from the server and the manager. I'm not surprised because  BAD SERVICE COMES FROM BAD MANAGEMENT. Please save yourself the humiliation and feeling as if your presence isn't appreciated and visit another BJs or avoid this entire chain of restaurants as Amy has left me no option.  No food is good enough to have to go through this type of service. And that my fellow yelpers is how BJ's has earned my very first 1 star review."
Ames A.,"San Jose, CA",166,105,162,2.0,11/30/2013,"I came in on a Sunday night, and was quickly ushered to the bar (although I wanted a table because I walked in with books planning to finish up some studying and grab a bite). It took about 10-15 minutes to get menus and drinks.. I had to wave down the bartender in order to do so. Bartender was nice and caught by surprised the fact we had no menus and nobody had really helped us, in other words service is a bit lacking. The decor is your usual BJs, filled with high chairs, TVs, and a young crowd. Now for the food avacado egg rolls (6$ for happy hour) they were crunchy and filled with avacado goodness. Shrimp Scampi (16$) flavorless and bland seared ahi tuna salad (15) The sauce they used was flavorfull and yummy.  We both drank water so I'm not so sure how our bill came out to 45$, we paid and left and will probably not be back anytime for this mediocre food..."
Jaclyn L.,"Sacramento, CA",16,32,2,5.0,2/14/2016,"Went in for a Valentine's Day lunch and it was surprisingly wait free! Service was AWESOME! I've been to other BJ's Restaurant & this one has been by far the best. I was really surprised how fast and great the service was, especially on V-Day!"
Angel F.,"Roseville, CA",239,67,260,5.0,3/28/2015,"I am giving them 5 stars today because I never knew they served brunch on a weekend. To add to that, the bonus is ordering buttermilk pancakes, French toast, omelettes or just scrambled eggs are the best! All the meals are an awesome portion & no skimping on any part. They serve a great amount of scrambled eggs, for pancakes, they serve 5 huge thick stacks! You will get fed! I am relieved for that. The fact I can bring my kids of different ages & that they can have an awesome meal & get full off of w/out being picky is perfect for me! Now I know I can definitely come here for breakfast, brunch with fam & friends gathering & also have kids come along to enjoy eating too. I will definitely come back again for brunch!!!!"
Jake V.,"Littleton, CO",19,421,214,3.0,1/14/2016,Busy place since its at Arden mall. The staff was friendly and nice. The food was good and it is plenty for dinner. I thought the chicken pita tacos were good but ordered fries with them instead of what the usual side is.
Erika P.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",145,6,5,1.0,5/17/2016,"Sssoooo gross! :( This is my third time eating here and it still disappoints. It's a bummer, especially since I live down the street. The service is always great, but the food is so awful. Tonight I ordered some food to go, just some munchies appetizers and once I got Home & opened the bag I knew I shouldn't have tried them again :("
Veronica S.,"Sacramento, CA",132,279,415,2.0,4/5/2014,4 stars for the food. 2-3 for the service. It's really a hit or miss but lately they've been slacking. Most of the time I go here with my friend and we usually never have to wait to be seated or the wait is really short which is nice. However last time after we were seated it took over 10 minutes for our waitress to get to us. I had to go up to the hostess and inform her. When I did she just glanced at our table and mumbled something like ohh ok. No apology or anything. Our waitress was ok. Our drinks were never refilled though which was annoying. Food took awhile too. Appetizers came out quickly but the main dishes took over 20 minutes. Love that BJ's has a pay on your phone option now. We weren't even thinking of using it but since our waitress was taking forever with our check we ended up using it anyways. I guess I just find it weird that every time I go here and have bad service it's never extremely busy which could explain the delay on the food.  Having worked in retail hell for two years I know that it really sucks dealing with people sometimes. I always try my best to be polite when dealing with people that work in the service industry but some things there's just no excuse for.
Nicole B.,"Sacramento, CA",499,244,224,5.0,10/20/2014,"I had a great time here! The food is great, the staff is professional, we'll dressed, organized and the prices are fair. We came in late and sat in the cocktail area, where we were served by a very sweet girl with an accent,  I cannot remember her name for the life of me. But I do remember that she is vegetarian too! So she was very understanding that I wanted my pizza without meat, and when I got it WITH meat on it she immediately knew how gross it feels to us vegetarians to just pick it off so she offered to remake it right away.  Knowing that my boyfriend eats meat because his order was a meatlovers pizza, she offered him a box for my messed up pizza so he could take it home and enjoy it later. That was really cool of her! He did take it home and ate it for lunch the next day, he said it was very, very good! It took a while for my pizza, eventually the chef came walking out with it, that's right, the chef made it a point to come all the way to our table to apologize saying that it was his mistake. Obviously we were more than understanding because it happens every where, all the time but I just felt for the first time that someone actually cared and that was really nice.  The waitress and the chef(next time I visit I'm going to find their names) had outstanding customer service skills and helped us have a fabulous experience at this BJs!   As always, BJs food was delicious, the martinis were spot on and we had a great time. We will be back soon!"
Jennifer T.,"Sacramento, CA",21,147,13,1.0,2/27/2016,"I really hate  to give negative reviews, but this was by far THE WORST experience I've ever had at a BJ's EVER!! The service was horrendous! Our server came to our table right away to take our drink order and as we were waiting for our drinks, other tables that came in after we did got their drinks a good 5 to 10 minutes before we did. And the same goes for our food. Once we got our food, our server came back only once to check on how our food was and asked if we wanted another drink. When we asked for water, they were dropped off at our table without a word. The fish and chips I ordered were over cooked to the point of being almost burnt. When we asked for boxes, she returned a short time later with them and tossed them on our table and again no words spoken. And instead of dropping off our check when she brought over our boxes, she walked away as if she were expecting us to order dessert even after we told her we were not. There were no thank yous or any other words spoken at a higher than a mumble. Overall, I have never been so disappointed in the service or food at this establishment in my life. Even though I will never go back to this particular location, I will have to put up with driving further to other locations."
Yolanda H.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",121,8,2,1.0,11/3/2015,"I'm don't live out here so I'm sure I won't ever come back to this location,but I felt compelled to write a review anyway. I'm beyond positive I got food poisoning from eating here. I felt sick a few ours after eating my meal and I was in the bathroom for two days after eating at this BJ's. The worst part about this entire episode was that I was on a business trip, so I had to continue with my business while running to my room to use the restroom every couple hours....DON'T EAT HERE!!!"
Tianna W.,"Sacramento, CA",162,211,500,3.0,1/19/2015,"Been here once in the past. I remember the pizzas me and a group of people ordered individually were commonly dry, but still tasted. I went there today and had the lunch chicken taco plate. Very small as I was told but good with a side of beans. Initially, it took the server sometime to get to my table but she was nice. The lunch taco plate wasnt very light or  heavy, it was just right for the occasion."
Bianca N.,"Sacramento, CA",256,114,80,5.0,8/6/2016,"Matt J. was out waiter and prefer his section because he is always so friendly and helpful. He knows the good tasting dishes on the menu. He recommended the tortilla soup and it was so good. The added squeeze of lime added a great touch to the appetizer. We also indulged in the capres salad, with balsamic dressing that was not too vinigery and not too sweet. The main course I got the Jumbo spaghetti and meatballs because i had been craving it for a long time. And I decided that I wouldn't wait not one moment longer and ordered a beer that had a hint of lemonade, please try it ! . Boyfriend ordered the Shrimp and penne pasta. Of course, I dug my fork in his plate like I always to and it was flavorful, not too heavy and not overly salty. He did claim he didn't have that much shrimp but that the dish was very good. We skipped out on the dessert because, well we really didn't want to over so it...lol.. Again I have always enjoyed myself here, the bartenders and specifically Matt J. have always been super cool and atentive. Thanks Matt ! Until the next time .."
Katelynn B.,"Gold River, CA",34,5,2,5.0,6/19/2015,"I come for the Pizookie!  That is the best part of the meal! Granted the food here is great too. I like the Parmesan crusted chicken.  I've frequented a few locations and they've a been great, but I gotta tell you it's pizookie heaven for me."
