DaFoodCritic F.,"Sioux City, IA",18,33,51,2.0,3/10/2016,"Had it for the first time several months ago. The food was pretty good as well as their prices for what you get. I just had an issue with our server. He wasn't the greatest, he was kind of friendly but didn't pay much attention to us or even came around often to see if we were doing okay. He even forgot to bring a cup of milk we ordered for a toddler that was with us. We had to keep reminding him, asking for napkins, and also for refill on drinks. Was not the most pleasant experience."
Sarah J.,"Sacramento, CA",9,51,156,5.0,4/17/2015,I have been to all the BJs locations in Sacramento. This one is my favorite. Their food and service are always good and consistent. A little slow on busy nights but always worth the wait and the atmosphere that the staff help creat is great for a fun night out or relaxing lunch.
Carl Vincent C.,"Sacramento, CA",478,122,332,2.0,6/14/2011,Definitely not what I was expecting from BJ's. Long story short: the service was terrible. The hostesses seemed annoyed & painfully bored while seating me and my friends. Our waitress barely checked up on us too. It took nearly an hour to receive our food. & we ordered sandwiches.
Jamaica S.,"Sacramento, CA",30,38,15,1.0,10/31/2014,"My husband and I tried this place about a year ago,   I ordered the Mahi Mahon tacos he got the chicken sandwich. It's kinda hard to mess up a fish taco. It took about 30 min for our food to arrive during lunch hour, we tried to sneak a day date in wo. the kids. It grew frustrating to see people who arrived after me eating before me, it wasn't a complicated order or anything.  Mahi Mahi tacos;  1 fried,1 grilled. Fried fish tastes frozen fish sticks put in grease (they were burnt, but I was starving). The grilled one was bland and flavorless. A creamy ""guacamole-like"" dipping sauce, tasted like avocados and mayo mixed (yuck) the salsa was the basic jar variety (pace if I'm not mistaken) Best part was my strawberry lemonade. The waitress tried her best was does the waitstaff ever taste the food? ?? Fried chicken sandwich;  nicely Fried and seasoned chicken breast on a grilled roll, my husband said he'd try it again,  for him that's saying alot. Take 2 today; while at the mall hunger struck my two kids down for the count, I considered BJ's again letting bygones be bygones plus the kids wanted to try the Pizookie (why is there no Sniderdoddle pizookie?? whoever turned that idea down should've been fired places like c.r.e.a.m are selling the combo of snikerdoodle and ice cream and are making a killing) my husband was in the process if upgrading my kids' phones and we were hungry so this time we decide to only order appetizers while we waited for him. this proved to be a not so good idea as I ended up just paying for the starters tipping and leaving. the sampler plate comes with an assortment of different Lil fried bites none of them out shined the other at all, the artichoke dip needed something salty in it to balance out the creaminess. there were avocado rolls (the nastiness creamier most oddest made edible thing ever) it lacked any sort of substance to hold it together so it was like biting into fried bland guacamole wrapped in an egg roll wrapper.  stuffed mushrooms; spinach and cheese topped with parm. these were okay too, I just wish someone who really knew how to cook and season food worked there,  it had the potential for something great but it missed the mark only in seasoning.  I looked at the menu for about 20 min before deciding this place wasn't worth trying an entree. we booked it out of there quick, smh"
Addison M.,"Sacramento, CA",1476,395,439,4.0,3/2/2015,It's a good location the parking is very crammed and tight you might have to get valet parking if you want to get food at a decent hour or come later in the evening
Dawn C.,"Sacramento, CA",5,16,1,2.0,10/5/2016,"Walked in and service was snarky. Was told they were honoring a special, but at time of payment, they said they were not."
Lynn J.,"Sacramento, CA",28,66,22,5.0,1/3/2015,I have been here a couple of times and I always have a positive experience. Never waited over ten minutes for a table and the staff is always friendly and on top of things.  The Parmesan crusted chicken is so yummy. Served with potatoes and broccoli. The giant baked potatoes are great and super filings. You can never go wrong with the pizza either.
Helen B.,"Sacramento, CA",10,119,237,4.0,2/4/2015,First time in this place like any other BJ's it's noisy but this one is better.  I ordered the chicken wrap and it was the bomb for tonight
Lawrence B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/18/2015,"The meal started out pretty well, as my party of four got a table for lunch with no waiting. Our waitress was a nice young brunette who brought water quickly. Then the trouble began. After choosing what to order, it took the waitress 20 minutes to notice we were waiting for her. And it was another 25 minutes for the food to arrive! My clam chowder was very good, and my burger was great. My date's French Dip was mediocre (her words) at best. Her sandwich had almost no cheese, and the bread was inedible. My buddy's fries were only lukewarm.  Following the meal, our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert. We decided to split a Pikoozie (ice cream & cookie), and then proceeded to wait forty-five (45) minutes. Our dessert plate and spoons arrived, but no food to go with it! Furthermore, the waitress seemed to be avoiding us. Being left waiting is bad enough, but being clueless about the state of your order is inexcusable! Time was ticking down, and my buddy had to catch the train to San Francisco. Finally, we spotted the waitress and I physically intercepted her and told her to forget the dessert and just bring the check. It was only then--amidst hurried apologies--that she admitted the cook had made the wrong dessert and that she'd had to instruct him to make the right one! A little communication to us might have been nice! After a fifteen minute wait we got the check. I was tempted to leave my ""pointed insult tip"" (1/2 a penny), but I gave her the benefit of a doubt and left two dollars and change.  On the way out I stopped to use the bathroom. The overhead speakers were blasting music at 105 decibels (according to my sound-meter app), and the echo effect was terrible! The men's room was clean and nicely decorated, but you'd better bring shooting plugs to save your ears! That is not what a restroom should be like! This place looks like it will be a great experience, but don't be fooled. There is a lot of room for improvement!"
Cari Y.,"Berkeley, CA",76,46,29,5.0,4/16/2015,"First time here since it opened up.  I went with my siblings after church and it was just an amazing experience. I got to catch up with my siblings over good food. Could it get any better?  We had pasta which wasn't all that - Chicken alfredo. However my sister ordered a flatbread yada yada (forgot what it was) and it was delicious! I am a big fan of anything similar to pizza, in shape or form, and it was tasty.  Also had the strawberry freckled lemonade thingy and it was a little too sweet but just added some of my water to it and made it perfect.  Service isn't great nor bad."
Ashiana K.,"Vacaville, CA",102,196,394,4.0,11/18/2013,"Now, that I'm Gluten Free, I just had to try their GF pizza and pizookie!! My hubby and went on a double date and of course chose BJ's because they're still promoting their 2 for $20 deal (soup/salad, entree, and dessert for two folks). We ordered the GF veggie pizza with roasted garlic and spinach and it was incredibly delicious! I didn't feel like I was missing out on traditional pizza at all! We also got the GF pizookie and I must say that flour is such an essential ingredient to a cookie, lol but the pizookie wasn't that bad. I think it was a little overcooked but it was still ""eat-able"" and we had them top it with the peppermint ice cream (now that the holiday flavors are in!) Our server was decent but not memorable. What I didn't appreciate was I wanted to use a Visa gift card towards the bill and was told that the card was declined because BJ's run all their cards as ""debit"" and not ""credit"". Uhh, we live in 2013..large franchised restaurants should be able to run ""credit"" when handed a credit card, debit card, or Visa/AMEX gift card. This was definitely a turn-off but whatever. The GF pizza left me in a good mood so I didn't complain."
Steph G.,"Sacramento, CA",560,790,1237,4.0,6/15/2011,"The Peanut Butter Pizookie is SEX IN YOUR MOUTH!! It brings deliciousness to a whole new level...  I want to have babies with the Chef/Ower/Creator of pizookies. I've tried almost all flavors, with the exception of the oatmeal version (just personal preference). Each one has been almost as climactic as the Peanut Butter, but not quite.  All you big chain haters, get off your high horse and get into one of these bad boys (rant over)! There is a plethora of decisions on the menu (Cheese Cake Factory-esque). But, do be warned (the missing star) that their service is what you'd expect from a big chain. But to me, if you do a cost-benefit analysis...Pizookie wins every time. Few have tried to imitate, and all have failed.  All of the locations in the surrounding Sacramento area have been consistently good with food, but that little part about their service holds true!  Peanut butter deserves its own food group, just sayin...."
Trevor A.,"Sacramento, CA",100,122,12,4.0,12/30/2013,"The most efficient BJ's I've ever been in.  20 minute wait tops for a table the Saturday night after Christmas in the busiest mall in town?  INCREDIBLE service!  Managed to find a two seat table in the bar area in less than FIVE minutes.   Takes longer to park and actually walk to the place than to sit down generally. Servers & bussers are quick and attentive without hovering.   Food is still kind of run of the mill overall BUT there are some gems on the menu.  Had the Buffalo whatever it's called stout/IPA concoction which is by far the tastiest thing they do with their beers.  Goes EXCELLENT with fish & chips, the ribs or any of the Italian dishes with marinara. This go around I had the full rack of ribs for $20.  Came with one steak side & soup or salad.  Went with the horseradish mashed & chili which was offered as a soup.  The chili was okay with some shredded cheddar and a nice amount of sour cream on top but tasted canned.  I can live with that although it's not beans.  The horseradish mashed was EXCELLENT.  The ribs were an actual full rack that only costs $3 more than a half rack.  Cooked perfectly for a chain that doesn't smoke them.  The sauce was also perfectly done.  I prefer a dry rub but can live with sauce if it's not opened floodgates. The date for the evening had a spicy meatball pizza on the regular crust.  Neither of us like the tomato chunks so we went without them.  Could've used some olive oil in its place because it made the crust sort of dry.  BUT the spicy meatballs and jalapenos were a joy. Second good experience in this location has it officially in the ""places to eat when in the Arden area"" list here."
Audrey C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,,4.0,3/3/2016,"I love this place, everything on the menu is delicious,  my favorite is the oreo poozookie . Yum lol"
E T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,27,45,2.0,2/21/2016,Been here twice. Each time an order was subpar. Alcohol and cookie desserts are good.
Erica C.,"Anchorage, AK",831,261,3017,4.0,3/29/2013,"I haven't had BJ's in a long time. Yesterday, I stopped by here for happy hour since I was craving their pizza. I normally don't go to BJ's because I never really enjoy anything on their menu besides their pizza.  Happy hour is the best time to come for their pizza! 50% off all personal pan pizza's so it ends up only being around $5.25 per pizza. My all time fave is the Mediterranean. Nom nom. You must sit in the bar area to get happy hour pricing! We arrived around 5:30pm and there were plenty of seats. They also offer $2 off shareable appetizers and $1 off pints.  I had a coupon from the Sunday paper which gave us $5 off $20 all food items. So in addition to our pizzas we ordered a few more dishes. We tried their gourmet mac and cheese and calamari. Both were surprisingly good! I was very satisfied by the time I left."
larissamorn b.,"Marysville, CA",17,78,10,4.0,10/29/2015,"After my lunch fiasco (the nearly empty sandwich from Nordstrom) I used BJ'S app to order the ahi poke to go. Huge portion size was unexpected and much appreciated making the $12 (including tip) tab well worth it. Fish was sloppily cut but fresh as can be and the marinade and wonton chips were on point. Nice guy at the takeout counter, too. Order was ready on time and I'm pretty pleased with my experience."
Valerie F.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,10,2,5.0,4/10/2015,"Well, I was really nervous about going here after all the horrid reviews that I read.  However, they deserve 5 stars, for sure.  We did curbside, but we arrived too late and had to go in. They didn't tell us this over the phone, but the guy was new and nervous. He had assisted us over the phone, very well. He made sure that we were getting what we wanted and apologized a bunch. He was extremely kind.  When we went in, they apologized for the inconvenience and he thanked us for being so patient with him and offered us a couple of free drinks.  We ended up with two strawberry lemonades, chicken alfredo, and chicken tenders with buffalo sauce. We couldn't have made a better choice for take out dinner tonight."
Jeremy T.,"Forest Hill, TX",344,21,3,5.0,2/13/2016,"Our server Keya B. was phenomenal! So informative, and welcoming. The Deep Dish Ziti was delicious! We had such a great time! I enjoy BJ's atmosphere! We were just and a layover and I'm glad we choose to stop in and eat! Great place, amazing food!"
Jack H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,8,,2.0,3/2/2017,"Ok I was in there today with my family we waited about 15 minutes to get seated. When we got to our table the server greeted us and gave us our menu. He came back after 5 minutes to take our drink order and we ordered appetizers. I'll say after 15-20 minutes our drinks came with the appetizers. Then another 15 minutes past by and the server came back to take our orders. We waited about 30 to 35 minutes for our dinner orders to come. We had kids with us. Then finally our dinner was being served. Wait we had no place settings, like I had to ask for them. How did the server think we were going to eat our dinner? With our hands?? Our little ones ordered pasta, it came with spoons, like why would you give spoons with pasta.. I was kinda lost.  It wasn't that busy for Thursday. I've been to other restaurants where it was 2x busier and servers had it under control. Anyhow we waited a long time for our dinner. The server didn't really apologize for their slow service on a Thursday night. I don't think I'll be dining at this BJ'S at arden anymore. I think they should retrain their staff, hire better cooks. I gave 2 stars cause the food and drinks  was alright..."
