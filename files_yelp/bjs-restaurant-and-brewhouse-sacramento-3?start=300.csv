Stephanie M.,"Sacramento, CA",25,57,21,4.0,2/16/2014,"It's February 15th. Day after Valentines day. We head over to Olive Garden but the wait for a party of 2 was about an hour & 15 minutes. & since BJ's is right across the street I decide to call them to see what the wait was. About 25 minutes they said. Off we go to BJ's!  We get there & they get my name. I would say about 10 minutes later we got seated. Score!  We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip & chips for appetizers. Delicious!  I ordered a pomegranate margarita. Oh boy that was strong! I just turned 21 not too long ago so I'm still trying out new drinks. I had to wait until it got watered down with the ice to finish it.  The boyfriend ordered the scampi pasta with a piece of grilled chicken added & I ordered the Cajun pasta.  The wait for the food was I would say about 20 minutes. Not too long for a typical wait time at BJ's.  The garlic bread our pastas came with we're pretty burnt. Neither of us ate them & didn't bother asking for more. My pasta was quite good but it tasted way too much like tomato sauce. It tasted more like spaghetti than Cajun. The boyfriend said his only had the spices on top of the pasta and the bottom was tasteless.  Overall, the food was ok. Im giving them such high stars bc for the first time ever our wait time was really short. Like I've said in the past with BJs ratings, they've actually forgot about us. The portion sizes are huge. I maybe ate half my pasta."
Shay L.,"Sacramento, CA",132,21,10,5.0,10/6/2015,"I usually experience terrible to mediocre customer service whenever I go out to eat, but our waiter Michael was absolutely great. He constantly checked on us even with how busy it was. He never made my friend and me feel like a nuisance. I've never had such great service at BJ's in my life."
Timothy B.,"Murrieta, CA",16,4,17,1.0,8/29/2015,Worst hoist I have encountered at BJ's. She tells us that we will be seated right away and as we wait we see four other people be seat as soon as the talked to her. Then I asked what did right away mean to her. With a dumb look on her face I said right away was the four people that came in after me and they was seated right away. That's what it means.
Amanda L.,"San Diego, CA",82,17,6,4.0,2/9/2016,I haven't been to a BJ's in years and the wait is normally a deterrent but recently we stopped in for a late night bite and I was shocked at how much the menu has changed. We tried the Brussel sprout appetizer and it was great!! I recommend that for sure. I also had the Chicken Sandwich and it was a hit. If you don't mind a 30 minute wait then check them out.
Jennifer H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,5.0,3/11/2016,Best pizza ever!!!! Awesome customer service!!! If you love pizza you must go there!!! Try the sweet pig pizza THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!
Michael J.,"Pleasanton, CA",7,18,10,5.0,8/17/2013,"Love their beer. Especially their winning light beer nit-wit. Right temperature at serve. Smell good. Nice nitty taste. The best. I had 3 glass at my dinner tonight.  Their pizza is ok. Better than normal pizza joint.  Their serve is friendly. Atmosphere is friendly. It's inside a good shopping mall. So, waiting for table is not a problem."
Annie S.,"Sacramento, CA",15,27,27,4.0,10/11/2014,"I know this is a chain restaurant and people have certain expectations.  Honestly,  I like this place! I like that they have a wide range of kids menu for my little guy to choose from. They also have a light menu for customers who are watching their calories. ...like me. And they have burgers, pizzas and sandwiches for the guys and for groups to share. Overall, they have a little big of everything for reasonable price and good food! Can't beat that - right!"
Tesia J.,"Hayward, CA",95,187,21,4.0,9/28/2014,"Super tasty! I had the ribeye and cheesy mashed potatoes with a caprese salad. We also had tuna poke for appetizers (which they pronounced ""poke"" like you poke somebody with your finger. Lol) and a half and half pizzookie. I had salted caramel and my friend had like an Oreo one or something. Every single thing was delicious! The chips and tuna poke were sooooooooo gooodddd! Omgosh! The steak was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The potatoes were luxurious and the cookie was decadent! I was impressed!  Oh and the service was super friendly as well. The only complaint was that pretty much everything except the dessert came out at the same time. Lol. Anyway, I will be going back to try something else! Especially since I didn't get to taste any of their beer! (was on the clock!)"
Brian I.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,1,1.0,9/4/2016,"This place is the worst. I ordered from   for a delivery of bj's brewhouse.  I placed my order at a little after seven.  The first email they sent said it would be here (at my house) at a little after eight. That seemed reasonable so I went for it. The next e mail sent said another thirty minutes.  The driver then did not show up till eight fifty.  Almost two hours after my order was placed.  The food was ice cold, and un-edible.  We  tried to catch the driver but he just speed off.  We then called the delivery service,  they said bj's was responsible  for a refund.  Then we called bj's and they said the delivery service was responsible.  Then we learned that there was another party involved by the name of ""Food to you"" and that they were responsible.  As of now this has been three days later and no one knows who is responsible.  I still have ALL the food from the order and it is starting to smell.  I will post pics so you can see.  This was a seventy dollar mistake.  I have asked for a refund three days in a row, and they just continue to run me around.  All three of these places are a joke and I would never ever use these services agin or eat at bj's as a restaurant.  I would stick with Applebee's as they stand behind there food."
Sophia S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",119,22,17,1.0,8/8/2015,"My food was okay, and the service was horrible. It seemed as if our waiter was intentionally avoiding us majority of the night, and made it seem like we were asking for too much when we asked for straws, ketchup, and silverware. Bringing us an empty bottle of ketchup and then after the night when we were leaving, three workers didn't even acknowledge us but just kept giggling and laughing at the front desk. Definitely driving further down sunrise or even Elk Grove next time I go to bj's."
Melissa B.,"Davis, CA",40,108,34,4.0,2/19/2013,"Always a fan of BJ's. Large variety on the menu, and everything seems to be well prepared. Their giant stuffed potatoes are really good!! They have some fun beers/beer mixtures that are always great to try, my favorite is the Hoppy Buffalo. The pizza is good if you like deep dish, and dont you know you have to have a Pizzookie for dessert?? Its a giant cookie topped with ice cream, and its pretty amazing.  Lately I have been ordering 2-3 of the ""small bites"", which are basically appetizers for 1 or 2 people that are cheap! I like variety and being able to mix and match these for the same price as an entree. One of my other favorites is the flatbread, I cant remember which one but it has lots of veggies and feta cheese. Nom. Sign up for their Premier Rewards and you will get a member card that adds the dollar amount of all your visits. Each dollar=1 point, and 100 or more points gets you free stuff.  The Sacramento location is located inside Arden Faire Mall, so its a little crowded and parking can be difficult right in front of the restaurant, but the staff is friendly and fast nonetheless."
Ashleina R.,"Sacramento, CA",26,21,6,1.0,10/1/2015,"If Sara is bartending don't sit at the bar. She is impersonal and will hardly acknowledge you. And definitely don't get a mojito from her. It tastes like lemon lime Kool Aid. And don't ask her to remake it, because she won't. She will just add more lime juice. Save yourself the trouble and go across the street to Elephant Bar."
Farzin S.,"Irvine, CA",21,47,10,1.0,12/23/2015,"Don't get me wrong, I love BJ's food, but honestly will probably never come back to this BJ's. It took our waiter 10+ minutes to bring us our waters. The utensils and one of the wine glasses had food stuck in it(the wine glass was dirty after they poured the wine in it). The waiter was very grumpy and was definitely not happy to be there. It took them about an hour to bring us our food. Despite me asking her to make the steak medium rare, the stake was completely well done, borderline burnt and very hard to swallow. It didn't even come across her to bring me ketchup or dips for my fries and she did not even bother coming by and asking us how our food was. Not very happy with my experience :("
Rachel M.,"Sacramento, CA",112,2,3,1.0,5/22/2016,Me and my sister had lunch at BJs at Arden Fair and paid by mobile app and was chased down by the manager thru the mail saying we didn't pay our 46.00 bill image how embraced and upsetting this wasfor us. Come to find out there was a issue with there system. I will never go there again.
Hugh B.,"Daytona Beach, FL",402,3,1,5.0,1/30/2016,The Sriracha bacon and chicken mac'n cheese was PHENOMENAL! Our server Keya was great! Great experience.
Jamie S.,"Sacramento, CA",111,237,85,3.0,7/5/2014,"What is the deal with finding someone to staff their patio? I really like BJs. I really do. Their avocado egg rolls are always a must, and as a vegetarian I can't go wrong with either a pizza or veggie burger. Their Jeremiah Red ale is my favorite, and the Tatonka stout is a lovely break during the holiday shopping season. Their massive on-tap selection is worth a stop all on its own. Overall the food is predictable with other chain restaurants with a huge selection; a bunch of stuff that they keep frozen and heat up for you, pretending that they ""made"" it. Not complaining about the food, as that seems to be an industry standard among chain restaurants these days.  My point of contention is their patio service. There are relatively few restaurants in the Arden area with patio dining. In fact, I will often try a new place ONLY because they have a patio. If I was trying a place for the first time and was told that their patio dining was an issue, I'd probably leave to go someplace else.  But..... Every single time I have gone to this location and asked to sit outside, the staff asks like I'm asking them to go above and beyond their job to ""find someone"" to serve the patio. Why? Why do they even have a patio if no one can sit there? Why is it an entire ordeal to sit there? Why do I have to hear from a hostess about how busy the servers are every time I go? Why does asking for a patio table seem to bewilder the hostess so much? Perhaps the bigger question; Why do they even clean the patio tables, set them with condiments drink menus, etc, if they have no intention of sitting anyone there? The last time I went to BJs, I was going only to have a beer with a friend, and we were told that we could only use the patio seating if we first got our drinks at the bar and brought them out ourselves. Next time I might just end up getting my own takeout from a different place before going to BJs.  I realize that this most likely is not the hostess's fault, but damn. You would think that being this location is less than 500 feet from a Cheesecake Factory, with it's near-identical menu and conflict-free patio service, that they would at least have that area staffed."
Gabriel M.,"Fresno, CA",4,38,19,2.0,6/29/2015,"I've been here several times, food and service is usually good. Last time I went both of our plates weren't good. They were just ok but not typical BJs quality. Kind of disappointing.  Food quality not consistent."
Leilani S.,"Carmichael, CA",59,10,1,1.0,6/7/2015,"Let me first start off by saying this place was a big disappointment the food was nasty. I ordered stuffed ravioli my husband ordered parmesean crusted chicken. Let me say I knew this meal was off to a bad start when the waitress gave me my food and said here is your lasagna, I corrected her and said this is not what I ordered and she told me it's ravioli but they call it lasagna, yea whatever. So back to the moral of the story the food was gross my ravioli was salty and tasted like microwaveable food, canned ravioli taste better then this junk. My husband's food had no flavor horrible experience. The 2 appetizers we ordered were mediocre as well. We spent $98 on 2 appetizers and 3 dishes so not worth the money. Won't ever eat at BJS again."
Petite G.,"Roseville, CA",3,17,4,2.0,7/20/2014,"I'll start with the summary:  Food is ok, service leaves a lot to be desired.  Two stars.  Not recommended.  We won't be coming back here. We recently came here with a party of 10 on a weekday.  It took them a long while to seat us (45 minutes!) and others who came after us got seated ahead.  We patiently waited, since taking a group of 10 people to another restaurant at dinnertime seemed a bit daunting. We finally got our table and put in our orders with a member of the staff, who was friendly enough.  While we were waiting for the food to be served, another server came and said that our original server was on break and that he would be taking over.  After about half an hour, the food started arriving.  Everyone's food came except for my hubby's entree.  When most of the people in our party were halfway through their dishes and his entree still did not arrive, my hubby gently reminded the server about it, and said that he (my hubby) had ordered it at the same time that everyone else in our table ordered their food.  The server said that he was going to check with the kitchen, and rushed off.   Minutes passed and almost everyone had finished their appetizers and entrees, but still no sign of my hubby's entree.  So we followed up with the server again.  He said that since my hubby just ordered it a few minutes ago, it was still not done.  What?! This was a lie by the server, because 1) we ordered it with the rest of the meal and heard it confirmed verbally by the original server and 2) the ""relief server"" heard my hubby say we ordered it a while back, along with everyone else at our table.  He (relief server) did not even apologize, and rushed off again.  We had to call him back and ask him to check the kitchen.  And lo and behold, a few minutes later, he was back with the entree, which was now pretty cold!  So, a lying server + poor training = not a good experience. What saved the evening was the fun company and the pizookie.  Otherwise, the food is just average, and if we really want chain-restaurant food, we can get more flavorful versions at Chili's or The Cheesecafe Factory next time.  We were unhappy with the service here, and we will not be back."
Samantha H.,"Sacramento, CA",201,92,52,2.0,11/16/2015,"Below average for a BJ's Brewhouse restaurant. My soup tasted like it was straight out of the can and my salad was drowned in mediocre ""balsamic vinagarette"". My boyfriend who will eat anything and eats a lot didn't even finish his burger because it was too greasy. Our server was good, it was clean and the ambiance was cool. They sat us in a timely manner and we had a decent lunch experience, but the restaurant in Arden is way better and so is the Elk Grove location in the sacramento region."
