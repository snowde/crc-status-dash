Sandi X.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,35,1,2.0,8/11/2015,"As it was so busy on a Saturday, my sister and I were seated at the bar, which we didn't mind of course until the blonde female bartender started giving my sister attitude. My sister had to get her attention and disrupt her little conversation and then she would glare at us afterwards. She was literally avoiding us the whole entire time and when my sister asked if the lunch specials were on the menu she said well it's in there isn't it? There was a lot of rudeness and I thought it was ironic that the bartender was more friendly to the men than the women who came to sit at the bar. I will go here again but I refuse to sit at the bar again."
Nate M.,"Sacramento, CA",18,46,4,2.0,8/2/2015,"Seriously... the fish tacos my wife had were just about the worst tacos we've had. My greek tacos were plain and filled with dry chicken. We went around 1 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, so it's not like the place was packed. Probably won't go back."
Nick K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,1,1.0,5/21/2015,"Went in on Sunday with some friends and the service was absolutely horrific. We ordered and appetizer sampler which everything seemed to be old, stale, and kept warm by a heating lamp. We additionally ordered to orders of wings in different flavors. The second wing I had in one batch was cold still practically frozen in the middle. I advised the waiter and he said it was probably just the one wing and it didn't sit deep enough in the fryer when cooking and their distributor fully cooks the wings. He was extemely resistant to bringing a fresh batch. My friend then bites into one from the other order and discovers it is completely pink and uncooked so I asked for the manager. The manager was more useless than the waiter. He was a younger fellow with a trimmed beard. He had no concern for the chicken being undercooked nor our health being put at risk and kept blaming it again on the distributor. I argued with him that it's not the distributor because if they receive them fully cooked then they still aren't preparing them right because the inside should be warm and white not frozen and pink. He refused to work with us on the bill and only offered to comp the wings. He took the undercooked wing to ""provide feedback"" for his cooks even though we requested to keep it as evidence. I would understand the resistance to comp the meal if it only happened once but for the same mistake to happen twice with two separate batches is completely unacceptable, BJ's needs to own up to their mistakes."
Rick J.,"West Sacramento, CA",29,45,,1.0,5/6/2014,"Went there today for lunch with a couple coworkers and I will never return to this location again!   Before I begin, keep in mind they were not busy and the place was over half empty.   First, the waiter wanted to sit us right next to the restrooms.  We requested another both and were seated.  Then we waited and waited and waited.  Ten minutes later the waiter arrives to take our drink order only.  We all asked for water, waited another ten minutes (how long does it take to get water?), we were given water then told that the waiter will be back to take our order.  The waiter came back about five minutes later took our three orders then we waited another 35 minutes before the food arrived.   Because they took so long, our lunch break was almost over and immediately after they finally brought the food we requested to-go boxes and the manager to complain.  We complained to the manager about the very slow speed of service and he acted as if it was normal and was very insincere.  He even encouraged us to use their website to order in advance.  It took another 10 minutes to box up the food by the waiter and the manager brought the bill with a 50% discount.  But he repeated that we should use their website to order in advance next time.  Next time?  There will not be a next time!  With so many other choices in that area BJ's will be the last place I choose for lunch.   Once we got back to work and ate our food it did not taste good.  It was very bland and boring as if it was sitting for a while.  I wonder why?  After all that waiting for so long I was hoping at the very least that the food would be really good but it wasn't.  Very disappointing! Besides the manager, the wait staff were very friendly and nice however they have no clue what speed of service means.  If you are debating whether or not go here for lunch I would highly recommend that you go somewhere else unless you have plenty of time to waste and like the taste of bland boring food."
Amber M.,"Boise, ID",234,139,95,4.0,6/4/2014,"Love this place! There are so many options on the menu, and it's the perfect place for large parties! It is super busy, so if you're looking for a more quiet, low key place, this BJ's wouldn't be it. I have never had a problem with the service here, and everyone seems to be so friendly. Always coming back for more."
Ashley S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",233,39,27,3.0,7/18/2015,"This BJs is at a great location (the mall) and had a great beer selection. However, the avocado rolls and calamari were not as good as they typically are at other BJ locations. Great service. Somewhat overpriced."
Sophia S.,"Carmichael, CA",0,8,3,1.0,8/27/2015,I will NEVER eat here again!!!! I have been here many times before and tonight was RIDICULOUS AND UNCALLED FOR!!! I Ordered My Burger Well Done And Got A Bloody Burger!  Talk about appetite killer!  When they brought me my second burger it was STILL pink! I am VERY upset! For a $102 bill I DID NOT GET MY MONEYS WORTH!!! HORRIBLE FOOD!! WILL NEVER EBER GO BACK HERE!!!!
Cynthia Z.,"Sacramento, CA",34,25,8,2.0,10/30/2015,"I have been to bjs many times and this was by far the worst service at bjs and my history of dining anywhere. First our group was told 45 min wait, took hour 5 mins and multiple times asking what the delay was. Once sat the waitress was very sweet and the appetizers were good but from there service went down drain. It's took 45 mins to get food and than it was cold or hard from sitting under lights. My toddlers plate was so hot from sitting they had to hold it with two pot holders she ordered chicken tenders but the plate was burning hot. Than my fiancé, mother in law, sister in law and sister in laws dad all had to send there burgers back due to it sitting so long, or for being hard.. Manager did his best but the overall experience was awful"
Jackie G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,12,4,5.0,12/4/2015,I had an awesome experience at the Arden location.  My waitress was amazing!!!   My waitress was so great I left her a 30% tip!! Food was great too!!
Alliver V.,"San Francisco, CA",599,245,104,3.0,4/22/2013,The food is delicious and I recently tried the irish root beer. It is my new drink! The Pazookies are also my favorite. The service is okay. It's not the greatest but it can get busy and hectic while in dining at BJs. Sometimes you can get forgotten by your servers.  I'd come back again.
Catherine J.,"Sonora, CA",136,89,74,4.0,9/17/2015,"The folks here were very accommodating for our little party.  The food was good, the customer service was good, and they let us hang out to visit for a couple hours without being pushy.  It can get a bit loud when the place is packed, otherwise, it's a good restaurant that's connected to a shopping mall."
Linnea S.,"Emeryville, CA",38,19,11,5.0,9/17/2015,"This was my first time here at BJs restaurant. Man, can I say it was very tasty. A friend brought me here I had the ""Top Sirloin Steak"", with asparagus with broccoli and cheese soup."
Matthew B.,"Chico, CA",35,332,71,2.0,6/24/2015,Frankly I was not impressed with the food. It was average and corporate. The service was prompt and efficient. The staff nice.
Jonathan F.,"West Sacramento, CA",281,96,64,4.0,10/4/2015,"I love their pizza, though wish I could do it more often though definitely not the most healthy. This would be a cheat day without question. Amazing food, lots of beer on tap especially their IPAs."
Shaina Marie W.,"Sacramento, CA",68,95,64,1.0,10/4/2015,Tried to make reservations for 20 people and they couldn't fit us in on a Sunday night. I'm at the Natomas location  1-2 times a week personally and have never been denied for any size group. At the Natomas location we walked in on mothers day with 26 people and got seated immediately. Disappointed with this Arden location.
Teresa S.,"Sacramento, CA",255,95,151,3.0,7/31/2014,"First, let me start by saying 3-Stars means I STILL LIKE IT!!  BJs is a classic go to when I just don't know what I want, and am not in the mood to experiment with something new.  It's also the place I go when my friends and I just can't decide/agree. Less expensive than the near by Cheesecake Factory and WAY More Beer on Tap!  Also they have Berry Burst Cider and a pretty good Happy Hour!  We always sit at the bar and get good service from the Bartender, and additionally the people that come to BJs and sit at the bar are equally friendly and social.  The foods ALWAYS great. Exactly what I ordered with no surprises, and delicious. I only took away stars because 1) it's a chain... i.e. nothing special and 2) there's almost always a wait, and the bars always crowded."
Jennifer T.,"Sacramento, CA",7,108,43,4.0,8/27/2015,Superb customer service. The only downside was that the waitress forgot one of our items we requested. But she quickly got it to us after I reminded her. Food was good. I happened to like the BJ's in Natomas better than this one.
Ninarae N.,"Elk Grove, CA",448,187,201,1.0,2/18/2014,"The BJ's attached to Arden Mall is the absolute worst Bjs I've ever been to. I've only been here once and I will never return. My sister in law and I came here after a wedding rehearsal starving. We were seated in the bar area which wasn't even busy at all. I remember seeing at least 2 servers manning this area. The guy took our drink orders and then never returned to take our food order. He walked passed us multiple times, clearly noticing we still had menus on the table. Over half an hour had passed and we still hadn't been helped. I left $5 on the table to cover the expense of our drinks (I'm not one to dine and dash, no matter how bad the service is) and left. As I was leaving, I politely notified the host that we hadn't been served and that I was pretty upset. She apologized & I told her it wasn't her fault, but maybe to bring it up to a manager so that situations such as these don't come up again. Though I was pretty livid, I'm not so sure another customer would have been as polite as I.  From now on, I'll just make the extra trip to Elk Grove or natomas if I want my bjs fix.  Btw, I'm only leaving one star because I have to."
Sambo C.,"Sacramento, CA",251,111,123,3.0,9/7/2012,"I've been to BJ's several times and most of the time, it's just mediocre. There's nothing really that great about it. Their beer is what they're known for but I wouldn't say that it is spectacular or anything. I've ordered dishes such as pasta, pizza, stuffed potatoes, salads and more but there is really nothing that would keep me coming back for more. Service varies depending on your waiter. Some are really attentive and they give you their input on certain beers that they like. They also have a nice dimmed interior which I appreciate about the place. I guess this is a good place to go if you're just planning to stay out late and drink since they close at 1 or 2. Other than that there's nothing else to look forward to here."
J.K. E.,"Sacramento, CA",0,21,,5.0,10/24/2014,"BJ's Restaurants are a regional craft brewery in Northern California. They have locations in Roseville, Natomas and at Arden Mall. I have eaten at three of them. The one in Roseville is where they brew their ales.  The service at Arden was great and the ales are superb. The food is good and they are busy enough, so you know they doing something right.  I had a good time at their Happy Hour and would recommend them to any of my beer-drinking friends."
