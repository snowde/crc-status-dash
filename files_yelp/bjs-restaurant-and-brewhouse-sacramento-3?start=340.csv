Paola M.,"Sacramento, CA",9,30,16,4.0,7/31/2014,"I was actually very indecisive about coming here on my birthday dinner, but it was already pretty late ( almost 11 pm) and we were already in the area. I wasn't too hungry since we had already ate a couple hours earlier. So I decided to order the calamari appetizer. The calamari was really good. It came with marinara sauce, ranch, and slices of lemon. The waitress was very sweet. I got a free chocolate chip pizookie. It was delicious. I'd soo come here just for that. It was pretty packed in their, being that it was the last day of the state fair, but our appetizers came fairly fast. Though we didnt get free refills on our drinks it didnt matter to much. Anywho I would come here again for sure, I don't know why this place has quite bad reviews. I liked it here :)"
Kelsey M.,"Sacramento, CA",58,4,1,4.0,11/21/2015,Yesterday was my birthday and my first time eating here. When we got here we had to wait 30 mins to be seated it was really crowded. When we finally got seated we ordered and we were served in 15-20 mins like whoa that was pretty quick! My plate was delicious the deep dit ziti i think it was called it was with penne pasta topped with mozarella cheese and marinara sauce and meatballs. What i really liked was that i was surprised with a pumpkin pizookie with a lighting candle for my birthday! My aunt told one of the waitresses that she wanted to surprise me for my birthday amd they suggested that and another cool thing was they didnt even charge her for that! We tipped them and left happy!
Sammy C.,"San Jose, CA",243,423,752,3.0,1/4/2012,"This BJ is inside the Arden Fair shopping mall; very nice and convenience location. They seem to be very busy every time we go visit, usually chill at the bar area. However, their waters/waitresses weren't too efficient; we usually have to wait for like a good 6min when we found a table before someone comes over to take orders. Their food and drink are just ok, I think we like the environment more than everything there, especially if you are a sport game fan - they have many TVs with the games on; I took two stars off because it has been always difficult to get their attention to order more stuff."
Shauna S.,"Vacaville, CA",53,10,8,4.0,8/23/2015,"Had a fantastic server, awesome food AND my meal was made to order with no errors! Made for a great date night and our server even helped walk me through how to save 20% by paying from the app!"
Jeremy O.,"Sacramento, CA",92,24,1,5.0,8/19/2015,"The peanut butter pizookies are so good that they should be illegal! All kidding aside, BJ's is a great spot for a beer and some good food. Never disappoints."
Chris R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,33,1,2.0,11/13/2015,"Hi I have been going to BJ'S for a long while. Never had any issues. I decided to make a trip at the Arden mall location for a business lunch. As many restaurants have specialty drinks usually with liqueur. Well since this is work I really did not want so I ordered a virgin style version. The waitress could but would charge me the same amount as it would be for a drink with liqueur. I have gone to many bjs and it seems with this particular location it's all about the money. Don't know if it's a mall mentality or what. I have ordered this drink along with many others virgin style and they automatically deducted a dollar to 50 cents due to the alcohol difference. I will continue to go to my other favorite locations of bjs, Stockton, concord, Vacaville, and Roseville. Never again here at arden mall."
Sarah F.,"Sacramento, CA",146,11,,5.0,9/29/2015,"Great service! Our server was Karah and she was the best! Excellent customer service! Always coming to check on us, keeping our drinks full, and very knowledgable about the new menu items and beers! I had the black and bleu burger, my friend had a mini pizza, and we shared the queso dip! Everything was perfect and we will definitely be back again! 5 stars for Karah!"
Beth R.,"Galt, CA",80,6,,4.0,11/2/2015,"I love the service here.  I have gone several times with my sister and never had bad service.  The atmosphere is comfortable and not cold (which I have experienced at other restaurants).  We sat at the bar, and the bartender made sure my non-alcoholic drink was always filled.  The pumpkin beer is one of our favorites, which is so very good.  I ordered the Asian salad with modifications, and it came out perfect and tasty.  I had my mouth watering for the Thai Mango Salad that I had last week, but they had a menu change and no longer serve it.  Please bring that one back.  Overall, BJ;s is by far my go to restaurant as the menu has about everything you want."
Brittany P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",470,123,42,1.0,12/17/2014,"It makes me sad that I am giving Bj's a one star review. I used to be an avid Bj's lover -HA- but now don't even think about going there due to so many reasons.  Service: Uhh yeah, why does everyone seem so miserable when I go? Am I the bad aurora? Well anyways, one time I went with a classmate to squeeze in dinner in between classes and didn't know what we wanted. We glanced at the menu and our waiter said.... I kid you not, -annoyed voice- ""Will you hurry up and order?"" I responded, what? ""Yeah, you're taking up my time."" What?! I was so shocked that I decided to live tweet what she was saying to the other people there for dinner. It wasn't nice at all. Haha Another time I went, they took FOREVERRRRRR. Like FOREVER. My roommate and I went and it took the 30 minutes to greet us at the table, bring waters and then add 10 minutes of finally getting our order in... Oh and there was like 2 families in the entire restaurant. Take goodness for the pay-early-app.  Recently, I did an office take out order and when I went to go pick it up, practically everyone was in a bad mood. I went up to the hostess to ask if she can call someone to the togo counter and she was like, ""Just wait over there and be patient."" OKAY. Sorry. I said PLEASE and I am told I'm a nice person. A few other times I went they weren't so bad, but I had dealt with a few attitudes when I asked them to scan my reward card and such.  Food: It's good, but only if you order your usual. Haha and the pizookies are the only reason why I'll ever come back.  Womp womp.  I will definitely be back to BJs, just not the Arden one."
Jay O.,"Woodland, CA",0,7,4,2.0,5/10/2015,My son took me to bjs restaurant for mothers day today we ordered the mac and cheese for my grandson when it came to the table it was crunchy and dry we had the watress take it back to the kitchen to make another mac and cheese when she brought it back it still looked the same way my salmon was very dry with no sauce the deep dish pizza was really bad i could of went to papa murphy and got a better pizza I do not recommend the restaurant
Steven H.,"Sacramento, CA",69,12,,5.0,10/28/2015,Good food and atmosphere. The ice cream cookie sandwiches are the bomb! Their spicy pig pizza is one of my favorite all time pizza anywhere. I give BJs 5 stars
Kilifi F.,"Sacramento, CA",23,19,3,2.0,7/16/2014,"Not the best eating experience compared to our neighboring BJ's ""I'd rather have Hooters"" -DJ, accompanying friend"
Melisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",133,40,50,4.0,7/31/2014,"Very pleased with the food and service here. We came in with a group of 8 on a Saturday afternoon with no reservation. We were sat in about 15 minutes even though they were very busy.  Our server was great. I wish I could remember her name. She even put up with us all needing separate checks with a smile on her face. I had the turkey burger with no bun and I was pleasantly surprised. Usually when I get this at a restaurant it is dry and flavorless,  but it was done very well here. My gf got the Thai chicken mango salad and she said it was very good as well."
Jairo B.,"Sacramento, CA",4,19,25,3.0,5/1/2016,"I would give them 5 stars only because after they neglected to give us a table outside that was available, only for laziness to clean it, we discovered the place next door (Seasons52) what a pleasant experience we had next door, thank you BJ's :)"
Erin H.,"Snohomish, WA",29,157,70,5.0,6/25/2015,"I love this place ! I always get the best service ( Juan Carlos your fabulous ). I love the Ahi Poke appetizer and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos ( on the healthy side). Their pizzas our great , deep dish style. I love their beers as well."
Duane H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",114,621,29,2.0,11/23/2011,Could you get any more plebeian...? Not my cup of tea... and bad service to boot...
Janet S.,"San Dimas, CA",7,6,,5.0,5/30/2016,Visited this location This weekend and the service was top notch!  Our server was professional and courteous and never left us hanging on a busy day. Very clean environment as well. Would definitely go back for  the delish food and awesome service!!!!
Angela H.,"Richmond, CA",52,728,181,4.0,1/19/2012,"Yummmmm! The appetizer sampler was bomb! Those avocado spring rolls were SO amazingly good. I didn't think I was going to like them at all. Stuffed mushrooms were okay. The pesto sauce on them was good. Good spinach dip, too. But $10 for a margarita?? Holy eff. I was thinking maybe $7. Sheesh. I won't be ordering a drink the next time I go."
Matthew M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/26/2015,"This place was horrible the server named Joan, was to busy to ever come to our table for refills... We had to keep flagging down passing workers. Ordered a large pizza  came out raw and doughy, and the small pizza was extremely small and over priced, typical shitty food chain restaurant!!!"
Mim D.,"Sacramento, CA",317,113,75,3.0,3/4/2014,"Been here a couple of times already and each time I leave a bit dissatisfied. I've had the rib eye, pork chop, salad, BBQ ribs, chicken Alfredo, pizza. None of which gave me a wow factor. The food is mediocre but it's a nice chill setting. They do offer great beer and wine selection. I do like their Asian chicken salad and the spinach dip appetizer. I don't know if I'll be coming back when I keep leaving not satisfied."
