Marissa M.,"Manteca, CA",1,26,2,5.0,7/29/2015,"Just had lunch here earlier, and the servicr was quick and food was great. Our server Colleen was so great. Would def be back!"
Rod V.,"Dixon, CA",0,98,,5.0,4/20/2016,"We loved this restaurant - great staff and good food.   We had stuffed mushrooms, potato skins, Santa Fe salad, Heniken and their house Porter.    It's in the Arden Mall."
David A.,"Davis, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/3/2016,"Came in for a quick dinner with my girlfriend. The food was good, but our server Sabrina was amazing. She was quick to help with anything we asked for and was super positive. Thanks for the great service Sabrina!"
Julian F.,"San Ramon, CA",75,7,,3.0,3/1/2015,"So I went there this afternoon for my sisters birthday. We were at the mall shopping and I had called the front desk and asked what the wait was and they said there was no wait and that we would be seated right away. We got there and had to wait 25 minutes. Unfortunate, but things happen. Our waiter brought our drinks quickly and took our food order quick as well. We went through two full rounds of drinks 30 minutes or so before the food came. And good thing one of the food runners came up to us and asked about our order and we noticed that it was incorrect. When we finally got our food all of our burgers were cooked the same, and when I say cooked, I mean left on the grill to get all dry and charred. Why ask me how I want my burger then to just cook all the burgers very well done? And the toppings I had on my burger we scarce and depressed looking. Don't get the jalapeño burger. It sounds like a good idea. But those jalapeños were the size of almonds. And there was like 5 of them... With no chipotle sauce. Lastly we waited for 10 minutes for a pizza togo box. Positives: cold drinks, nice atmosphere, not too loud(as some bjs are) Negatives: the food was poorly done, the servers seemed to not work well together (very disorganized)"
Wendy N.,"Berkeley, CA",358,300,75,4.0,7/19/2012,"If you are like me, and a few hours of hardcore shopping make you feel like you just did a stage of the Tour de France, this place was like a pond in the middle of the desert! I was on a mission to get a new outfit and determined not to leave the mall without something cute to wear on my next night out. I succeeded but it took three hours, tough decisions, endless trips to the dressing rooms, and a big dent in my credit card.  What does one do after this? Get a BIG beer! Having an ACTUAL BAR located in a shopping mall is a genious idea. It has a darkish interior, lots of TVs, and a good selection of drafts. I briefly perused the menu (which seemed to have standard pub food) but just ordered a thirst quenching, soul saving Racer IPA, a wonderfully strong yet easily drinkable IPA. Felt very revived after this and happily left the mall feeling uplifted, satiated and ready to conquer the world. (Just kidding, but I WAS in a better mood and not so tired) :)"
Barbara R.,"Citrus Heights, CA",17,12,,5.0,5/16/2016,"We had a wonderful time and fantastic server. Great environment, great food, and super good service!! Can't ask for anything more!!  Five STARS!! *****"
Crystal C.,"Sacramento, CA",300,418,705,3.0,8/13/2013,"I had a shockingly good time here, but my expectations were low to begin with. I was stuck at the mall because I needed my iPhone serviced at the Apple store. Which is more complicated and time consuming than it ought to be, and resulted in my boyfriend and I having to wait for my appointment (they're always running behind), then emerging starving and stressed from the Apple store a while later. We needed food and booze stat, and Hot Dog on a Stick was not going to cut it. We were told it a table would be ready in five minutes, which actually turned out to be over ten minutes. We hardly noticed because we'd already cruised over to the bar and had pints in hand by the time our buzzer went off.  Can we take a moment to appreciate their beer selection? Just, wow. What isn't available on their wall o' taps is available in bottles. Plus, Rogue Dead Guy on tap? Keep 'em coming. We ordered the watermelon and feta cheese appetizer salad, which came after we'd been seated at our table. The salad was delicious and I plan to swing by and get it again next time I'm in the mall. I ordered the blackened salmon with white wine and butter sauce dinner with rice pilaf, steamed veggies, and chicken tortilla soup. You get a lot of food for the price, but it's just too much food. Unless you're starving or sharing, get something light or something that will make food leftovers.  The chicken tortilla soup was interesting because the waitress arrived with a shallow bowl with a handful of multicolored tortilla chip shreds and sliced avocado in the bottom and asked if I had the soup. Um, yes, but that is not soup. It was then I noticed the little metal pitcher in her other hand. She put the bowl down and poured the broth portion of the soup over the tortilla shred and avocado. At first I thought it was weird, then realized it was genius. Done that way, the tortilla shreds are still crunchy and the avocado is still cold when you start eating, which has changed chicken tortilla soup for me forever. If I'm in the mall I will be stopping by for another bowl of this soup. I was pretty much full by the time the actual meal arrived, but took a few more bites of everything. The salmon was good but unremarkable. The white wine and butter sauce was very rich and good at first, but cooled down quickly and kind of congealed. Yuckers. The pilaf was bland and the steamed veggies were a tad overdone and had no butter or sauce or anything. Meh. I'm not sure I would order that dish again. The service was friendly but, as others have stated, a bit slow. The atmosphere was a bunch of families and people escaping the hustle and bustle of the mall. Noise level was a dull roar, but you could still hear what the person across the table was saying.  Considering my anxiety level at malls and disdain of the food court, I know I'll be back for a pint, the watermelon feta salad, and a bowl of soup next time I'm at Arden Mall. I will probably sit at the bar next time."
Andrew K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/24/2015,Did reserve for 6 people in 2 hours advance and they did not have my name on the list.  They said we have to wait for 2 hours.  Forget it!
Stephanie T.,"Corning, CA",0,19,,3.0,2/19/2015,"Good food and over nice atmosphere. It does get very loud in the evening and if you do not have a reservation, then you might have to wait a while. The chili is the best thing on the menu. I also love the grilled pork chops. They make a few flavors of soda which are really good. Good for a date or family dinner."
Lee S.,"Sacramento, CA",32,32,,2.0,10/12/2013,"Another BJ's, another bad customer experience. You have to give this chain credit, they're consistent.  If it weren't the Christmas shooing season, I'd have no business at the mall an no business at this lackluster version of a brew pub.  Silver lining: Racer 5 IPA on tap. Let BJ's be your emergency only food and beverage experience."
Nicole B.,"Elk Grove, CA",269,211,644,3.0,8/31/2013,"My girlfriend and I along with her 7 year old stopped in to refuel after some heavy duty mall shopping. It was only about 445pm and surprisedly they had a 10 minute wait that actually turned out to be a 15 minute wait. We asked to eat on the patio but were told no patio service. Too bad cause it was a wonderful hot August evening.  We were finally seated and ordered. Our drinks were promptly brought but we had to wait another 25 minutes for our meals. WTH?? People that were sat after us were getting their food. Waiter did not check in or give us an update. I finally complained and he immediately brought us our two entrees,   ( at this point we all know they were tanning under the heat lamp).   Well I was famished at this point and getting cranky. Luckily the entree I ordered was DELIC O U S    !!!  I ordered the Hawaiian style pork chop and subbed out the red potatoes for the pineapple fried rice. OMG this rice was so good. Both items were on the under 550 calories menu, not sure how but I was so hungry at this point I  didn't care about calorie counting  and inhaled every last grain! Lots of pineapple, peppers, very flavorful and not greasy at all. Chop was good sauce was sweet and tasty, green beans were not that great. Again i loved the rice.  While the service was typical chain type , the entree was so tasty and reasonably priced I will have me go back again and soon as it was only $14 and some change after tax."
John L.,"Sacramento, CA",217,11,2,4.0,1/29/2015,Their unlimited soup and salad lunch special for less than $8 is unbeatable. It's super good and healthy. I have been here 3 times in the past 10 days!
David M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/9/2015,I went here with my family for lunch today. We were seated and given our menu. We sat there for 25 minutes and nobody came to ask for our drink. We disn't even have water. Mind you the waitress who walked past us 4 times who was serving a table across from us. I told my kids who were wondering why we were not being helped that we can go somewhere. I then called the restaurant to speak with a manager and he did not even apologize and told me well you can come back and we will help you. Was very upset with the customer service.
Bob B.,"Dana Point, CA",18,8,48,3.0,7/30/2013,After taking my parents to the mall to fix their computer at the Apple Store they wanted to stop and have a meal at BJ's.  The hostess was friendly and professional. The server was pleasant enough but her service did not impress me. Dad had a burger which he enjoyed and mom seemed to really like her Southern Fried Chicken. My meal consisted of uninspired tacos.  Nothing really special about this place but acceptable if you are shopping at  the Arden Fair Mall.
Stefanie H.,"Sacramento, CA",111,230,,2.0,8/27/2013,"Whenever I review a chain restaurant or fast food place, I try to review it in light of my expectations for that kind of place. I want to make that clear because I'm not saying BJ's deserves 2 stars because they're not Chez Panisse. They deserve 2 stars because, even as a middle of the road casual chain restaurant, they fail. My dining partner and I had the spaghetti with marinara and the veggie burger with seasoned fries. Only the fries were of acceptable quality. The spaghetti was overcooked and mushy, and we're pretty sure they covered it in the spicy sauce even though my dining partner ordered the regular sauce. This was one of the view vegetarian-friendly items on the menu, and it was unacceptably bad.  I had high school boyfriends who made better spaghetti.  For nearly $10, the waiter brought out a plate of watery, mushy noodles with sauce that wasn't even particularly good. The veggie burger was only marginally better, but it was by far the worst veggie burger I've ever had at a restaurant. The bun was toasted to the point that it was crunchy and dry, and the burger was tiny in relation to the massive bun. The burger was pretty bland, and the menu didn't say what exactly was in it. The fries were good, but the waiter didn't bother to bring ketchup out with the food, so both the burger and fries were fairly cold before I actually started eating.  I definitely won't be back to a BJ's, both because of the poor selection of vegetarian/vegan options and the overall lack of quality in what they did offer."
Tara M.,"Carmichael, CA",22,38,8,1.0,6/8/2013,"People! Pay attention to all the reviews saying the service is rotten! Even with these bad reviews constantly coming in BJ's still can't get it right. Our group decided to go there for a special occasion and we called in a reservation which they supposedly said they could do. When the group got there at the time they reserved they still had to wait an hour. After ordering they waited an hour for their food. I was 2 hours late and my group was just being served the food when I got there and there were still people WAITING for their food! Note for those who have never been to any BJ's: it is a full bar restaurant with TVs playing in most corners of the building so the volumes can get pretty loud. The ""manager"" Al came to our table and told our guest of honor to shut up because our table was supposedly getting too loud, this was understandably upsetting to our guest of honor specifically because most of the people at the table were still pretty cranky from being hungry. When two of the orders arrived at the table with tomatoes after they had been specifically asked to be tomato free our table did become progressively loud with anger. We explained that we would not be paying for food that had been brought out after an hour and prepared incorrectly and Al informed us that we would still have to pay or he would call security. He did call security, and the police. We only paid for the incorrectly made pizza because one slice had been eaten (it didn't have tomatoes on the slice). If Al really is the manager, he is by far the worst manager I have ever dealt with. He knows nothing of customer service and belongs nowhere near the food industry. His waiters know what they are doing more than he does; for instance the waitress that served my friend his dessert an hour after he ordered it and after he had to ask twice and was told it was made wrong one of the times, he ended up getting his dessert for free.  The BJ's at Arden is a joke."
Nancy K.,"Brea, CA",0,51,38,5.0,3/24/2016,"So happy BJs accommodated our huge group with short notice.  We estimated 30 people but the storm of our state win brought 60 of us here to celebrate. The wait staff handled our huge group wonderfully and efficiently with quick service to hungry people..thank u so much BJ's, you're the best!!"
Steve M.,"Carmichael, CA",30,61,1,3.0,1/12/2015,"I really really want to like BJs, and I used to like it s lot. Service is fine, food is good, big beer selection. However, it's become way overpriced for what it is, and their last menu tweak took out most of the things I like. If you don't mind spending $40 for dinner at a chain restaurant...go for it."
Khatirah R.,"Yuba City, CA",20,6,,5.0,7/1/2015,"Love this place !! I've been here a couple of  times and I have to admit they always offer delicious food and have great customer service.  Anyone looking for a good place to have lunch or dinner, I definitely recommend you guys to try BJ's, you will love it!"
