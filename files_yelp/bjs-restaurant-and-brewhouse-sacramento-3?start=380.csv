Airen P.,"Sacramento, CA",13,17,,1.0,12/14/2015,"My office is near here so we go to BJ's for take out on a semi-regular basis.  They mess up my order about 90% of the time.  EVERY time we've ever done a curbside order, they tell us to come in and get it because they're too busy to bring it out (what's the point, of curbside v takeout, then??).  The icing on the cake today that prompted me to actually post a review was the complete lack of customer service when I called to tell them they'd forgotten half my order.  I do appreciate that they refunded me the full amount rather than half (I got a soup/salad combo and only received the salad... a $3.75 quarter of a head of lettuce with some onion and tomato on top... supposed to be a ""wedge salad"").  My appreciation stops there.  It took 10 min. worth of passing the phone before someone could even help me with a refund, and then they ""accidentally"" hung up on me... when I called back I didn't even get an apology for the phone disconnection.  When the manager did refund my money for the order, he acted like he'd just GIFTED me a gourmet four course meal.  With SO many other options at Arden Mall, I'd recommend avoiding this location of BJ's unless you are looking to be disappointed in your meal/ experience."
Samantha L.,"Sacramento, CA",294,553,1160,2.0,8/24/2011,"I've been to several other BJ's locations before, and this one, compared to all of my other experiences, really doesn't compare.  (And that's not a good thing.)  I came here on a Saturday night with two other people and we headed over to the bar, which was about 1/2 full.  We sat down at a tall table near the bar because all of the open booths were dirty.  There were five un-bussed tables; when the server came to ask us for our orders, we kindly asked if we could sit at a booth and we had 3 people tell us yes, but still no one bussed the tables.  Finally, the fourth person helped us.  We then ordered drinks and they came out pretty quickly. My boyfriend got a beer, which was pretty good, as usual ($4.95/pint).  If you've never been to BJ's or just want a variety, there beer sampler is pretty fun; you get several 5 ounce glasses of their different beers. I ordered the berry burst cider ($5.95/pint).  It tasted just like a Capri Sun, or juicy juice box.  I wouldn't get this again. My friend ordered the Cherry Cola drink ($6.95/glass).  It wasn't very good.  She loves cherry flavor and didn't even like it that much. Overall, I'd only order beer if I were to ever come back for drinks.   Less than half-way through our drinks, someone came to our table and asked us if we wanted to order any other drinks.  Since we had barely made a dent in our current drinks (and they weren't closing for over an hour), we were going to take our time, so we said that we didn't want to order anything yet.  The girl then left our bill there.  We finished our drinks, paid, and left.  I don't know why she rushed us out of there, or if she meant to, but I don't think I""ll be coming back for drinks soon.   Notes: -Plenty of parking because it's at the mall.   -If it's your birthday you get a free small pizookie."
Robert D.,"East Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",1,44,11,3.0,6/20/2015,"It's in the ""mall"" which makes it the go to place when shopping.  I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here.  Food is good but not special.  The beer selection is good and goes good with the burger"
Ngoc L.,"San Jose, CA",346,394,5502,3.0,5/23/2011,"I came here for dinner today after a failed attempt at the mall. The whole purpose to go Arden was for me to get a pair of shoes from Aldo but they didn't have it. We notices BJ's just recently opened on our way out so decided to give it a shot.  Orange creme soda: This was one of their handcrafted soda. It was pretty good.. A lil too sweet for my liking but my little brother enjoyed it.  Ahi poki: This was for appetizers. They had some really chips to go along with the tuna sashimi mixed with avocados and lettuce. A bit on the salty side..But the chips was the best! BJ Pizza:  The pizza was decent... Sausage was good. I would've liked the pizza more if it was a little crunchier and less soft. It tasted a bit too doughy for me.  Scampi Pasta: I would not recommend this plate. The pasta was very bland.. The best part of the dish was the shrimp which was well done...flavorful.  Overall, I would give it a 3.5, the food was just decent.. The appetizers was my favorite part of the meal. I didn't have room for dessert but I'll get to it next time I come back."
Brent R.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,13,1,2.0,9/15/2013,"When I was exploring places for lunch on Yelp, at first I disregarded this BJ's restaurant because of the three star average review they had received. But because I have been to other BJ's before, and never had an issue, I decided to try it anyways.  To keep this short, I am just going to highlight the issues I had. Most of the food was what I would expect from BJ's, and for the most part the waitress was average to slightly above average (quick drinks, checking in with us enough, but not too much).  The really problem was with an omelette that one person at our table ordered off the brunch menu. This omelette looked like something that was frozen, microwaved, then set under a heat lamp for a couple of hours. It was complemented with some fast food like fried potato squares and plopped on a plate with no presentation. The patron took two bites out of the omelette and pushed the plate to the side, in obvious distaste. Then he grazed off the rest of our plates for the rest of the meal. The real shocker in this story was that the waitress noticed the full plate pushed to the side, but never once asked if there was a problem or how the food was. She asked if we wanted a box, I said no need. Then the owner of the omelet said ""Actually I think the dogs would eat this."" And that was it, we paid and left, never to return again."
Heidi H.,"Carmichael, CA",982,685,982,4.0,4/30/2011,"OMG I am sooo glad we got our own here in Sacramento.  I love the food and the atmosphere. Broccoli cheese soup, to die for!  So rich and creamy.  I like to go and watch a game and since there are TV's everywhere I don't have to ask for a special place to sit.  I can see one from everywhere and my husband cant complain.  I haven't been able to check out there happy hour as of yet, but believe me I will.   I had the opportunity to go there before they opened via a special invitation to local businesses.  They were training the employees and had all free food.  The restaurant was FULL and the staff was friendly and very attentive.  I only worry about the parking situation because I know how the other BJ's get.  When i went it was a weekday and the mall wasn't too busy so we were able to park right out front.  I guess time will tell on that."
Leah D.,"Escondido, CA",32,72,92,4.0,11/7/2013,"BJ's has this mini bite plate salad that is so good. It's watermelon with feta and only $2.95! Everytime I've come I have ordered it. It never disappoints. I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms and they were so good. We came in around 10 pm. As we got seated we asked our waitress ""Is it happy hour?"" And she was not able to answer our simple question. She said she didn't work Wednesday nights. Well sorry but your job is to know. We also got seated way in the back. No other parties were seated next to us. But it worked out so we could be loud. The service was slow and it was NOT busy at all. Even getting our waters took a long time. Other friends ordered a small pizza, burgers, and mozzarella sticks. They all enjoyed their food. The 4 stars are just based on the food. I am sad to say that the watermelon salad will be removed from the menu according to our waitress."
Don P.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/22/2016,I tried to use the App to get on the preferred wait list and several times it just froze and was unable to make the reservation without calling. A little frustrating but all worked out. We got seated in a reasonable time and while waiting we were served Root Beer and Tomato & Cheese Pizza. We ordered a variety of food and all items were excellent and no one got sick as other people have indicated. I am not quite sure how they narrowed it down as their normal food could have been bad.  We brought our own wine which they cork (1st bottle only) for free. My son and I had Jeremiah Red beer and thoroughly enjoyed it. An excellent compliment to our dinner. The waitress was extraordinary and very attentive and the Manager followed up with a courtesy visit to see how things were. If you are looking for a quiet and romantic place to be then this is not the place for you. Something is always going on and the place is filled with excitement. We will definitely be visiting here every chance we get.
Megan S.,"Concord, CA",18,15,1,1.0,3/31/2013,"AWFUL! My server Robert I think his name was was just RUDE! i work in the service industry too and i know when its slamed its hard.  HOWEVER, that does NOT mean you get to be an asshole to everyone who gets put in your section.  I am a vegan, it sucks to go out to eat sometimes and i know i should go to more vegan friendly places but my roommate had her heart set on bjs.  I asked what was in the batter for the deep fry and Robert just rolled his eyes at me.  WHAT? (ps, it has eggs) I get asked crazy ass questions all time, deal with it. So i had my food my total came to 3.51 my friends came to 18.?? he gave us both our checks in one book, she put her card in the pocket with her total  i set mine on the side with my total. He came back and the wrong cards had been charged THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INSANE. fyi, if you dont know how to reverse charges GET A MANAGER! he said it was our fault and then went to switch it, and came back with both bills on my card, charged AGAIN! i told him now they were both on my card  he grunted and rolled his eyes again.  came back with correct bills and said a manager would be back soon.  this was well over an hour after the first bill was brought.  the manager came and said sorry and my card would be back to normal in a few days.  nothing more. just sorry.  i will NEVER go back again. Also, Robert if you see this, dont work with people anymore.  ALSO. its been 3 days, ive still paid for three meals....."
Douglas Y.,"Sacramento, CA",569,893,2281,3.0,4/9/2013,"Newer BJ's located in Arden Fair Mall, this location is actually quieter than the normal BJ's.  Typical sports bar type set up with multiple flat screens set up throughout the establishment.  I have a theory about BJ's.  The food service at every BJ's I have been to has always been slow, no matter what you order or how busy it is.  I think it is BJ's policy to make you wait for your food in hopes of increasing appetizer and more importantly your DRINK orders while you wait.  That being said the menu is pretty vast and the food selections are competent but nothing special."
Lien V.,"Elk Grove, CA",172,133,355,4.0,10/15/2013,"Strawberry Mojitos!!! Need I say more? During Happy Hour, you can enjoy yourself a Strawberry Mojitos for $5.00. These bad boys are addicting! Add on a flatbread pizza and Im good to go. Its always nice to just chill, drink, eat and enjoy a good football game on a Sunday afternoon.  This Bj's is conveniently located inside Arden Mall. Clever location to be since I kinda got tired of shopping so we decided to have a drink and snack before our next destination. Service here was ok, could be better! Service in EG is a lot better though I must say."
Kimberly D.,"Roseville, CA",25,119,49,4.0,3/15/2012,"Went on a Tuesday night at 10pm and was surprised to see so many people there. We were a table of 4. Sat at a booth at the bar waited a little long for menu's (but what do you expect when you seat yourself?) plus their was a bit of a server change right in the beginning. We ordered a pitcher of the Jeremiah Red. Not my style at all but a good deep bitter beer for those who are looking.  Ordered the Avocado spring rolls and mozzarella sticks to start it all off. Looking at the menu after 10 mini pizzas are half-off and appetizers were also discounted. I think it was $3 off.  Avocado rolls were awesome, and mozzarella sticks were great. What came next was ordering 3 mini pizzas. We ordered the Spinach & Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken and then the NEW! Gourmet Five Meat pizza. I didn't get to sample the Buffalo Chicken. But from the looks and the fact I didn't get any it must have been good.  I am now also in love with the Spinach & Artichoke pizza it was very saucy just the way pizza should be. The new Five Meat was fantastic as well it could not have been cooked better."
Mandy D.,"San Francisco, CA",89,355,209,2.0,5/26/2011,"My friend and I came here because it's usually her go to spot. We ordered to go. She ordered a classic baked potato with bacon and I ordered pasta with salad for lunch. They must have been having an off day since, the cashier who helped me told me that they messed up my order, so they had to redo. That was very honest and nice of her for telling me, but they forgot my side salad, so the cashier  went back and got it for me.  When my friend and I got back to her place, she finally checked her baked potato. For $8, she had a baked potato and bacon, that's it! No condiments, the usual sour cream, green onions, and butter. So much for being a ""Giant Stuffed Potato,"" just a giant potato with bacon. Quite disappointing. My dish wasn't too tasty either. What I don't understand is that do they not double check their orders before putting it into the bag? Sadly, we had no utensils or napkins.  The servers were nice though, just the food and what we got wasn't the best. I just hope it was an off day, but from reading other reviews, they are still getting the hang of things. Apparently, they have been open for two months."
Destiny S.,"Sacramento, CA",11,18,6,5.0,2/14/2015,"My bf and I came here for Valentines day today(2015) and we ordered the crispy calamari, chile verde fries, fritos nachos, crispy jalapeño burger and double deluxe. The food was great. Love the service, such friendly people. The atmosphere was lively and my bf and I never been there before so it was something new to us. We will be back soon to try more of their delicious food."
Laura B.,"Sacramento, CA",95,33,24,3.0,6/19/2013,"I thought it was only fair to update my review as I was pretty tough on the restaurant (with good cause) in the first review. After being contacted by the General Manager; Nick I received a gift card in the mail to try and make up for the disastrous celebration dinner we had last week.    Yesterday 06/18/13 myself and three of my daughters went back into the restaurant for lunch. We arrived at about 12:45 after a long morning of shopping. As was the case last time our hostess was very welcoming and sweet. She said we would be seated within about 10 minutes and that was accurate. Our server was Crystal and she was an angel too!! Very friendly and engaging with my teenagers and very attentive. She made sure we had our water and drinks and kept everything refilled and had a charming demeanor. She made all the girls feel special. We all ordered lunch and I again for the sake of the experiment ordered grilled shrimp tacos. The girls ordered, chicken strips, chicken lettuce wraps & a thai salad. We also ordered an appetizer of avocado egg rolls. Everything came out in the correct order and was hot and fresh. We didn't have to wait to long at any point in the lunch. All of the lunch food was excellent and got rave reviews from the kids and my tacos were delicious! The egg rolls got only so so reviews. It was prepared and served perfectly we just didn't like the mushy texture.. Nothing but avocado and cream cheese on the inside so well, mushy. The outside was crisp and hot and fresh though.  The price for lunch was a little high, about $80 so we probably wouldn't eat there all the time but my second visit really changed my mind about the restaurant. Our server Crystal really had so much to do with redeeming the restaurant. She was awesome so we left her a 20% tip and a big thank you."
Jessica M.,"Sacramento, CA",7,25,4,5.0,7/23/2015,Excellent customer service during my lunch visit. Great food loved the drinks overall good times
Chrissy G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,20,4,1.0,10/17/2014,"Food was mediocre, they have changed the menu so the item on there was no longer on there.  Just have had better food. Service was decent no complaints. When I walked in after my party was sat I asked the hostess where they were and was told to walk around and find them . Probably won't return"
Lydia P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,36,1,4.0,5/13/2015,"I seriously love this place. I come here at least once a week. I love their Pizookie, and the fact that they have a smaller portion since I can't eat a whole thing by myself. They're even willing to leave the ice cream on the side if you ask. They have an amazing cocktail menu with specialty drinks that are delicious and don't skimp on the alcohol. My personal favorite is the Irish Root Beer with their own craft root beer! And their Happy Hour rocks! $4-$5 cocktails and $6 mini deep dish pizza... You can't do much better than that!"
Julianna K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,1,1.0,12/29/2015,I got served RAW chicken and when I asked for a mini pizza instead they charged me for my meal. RAW CHICKEN. The only thin that was done is they apologized for the RAW chicken. Then they messed up my bill three times and kept trying to over charge me. They are lucky that I didn't get sick.
Vanessa M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1,15,6,4.0,5/8/2015,"Delicious chicken nachos, good happy hour, good lunch menu, typical restaurant chain."
