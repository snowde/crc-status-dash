Cassandra I.,"Sacramento, CA",5,11,7,2.0,9/3/2017,I should of ordered from Natomas Location. Food was fine but I also got the couscous mac&cheese....BUT! The amount i had gotten was way less than what I paid for. I probably got not even half a cup of it looks more like 1/3 of a cup. Usually they would have it filled in Natomas but I guess not here on Arden location. Felt like i just wasted money just to get an half empty bowl.
Jarrod F.,"Sacramento, CA",7,11,,1.0,8/9/2017,"The experience here tonight was an epic failure. First, we were sat in the middle of the room and when I asked for a booth because of my wife's phobia of sitting in the situation was sold a song and dance by the hostess and told no. But the server was more than happy to do so.  Appetizer and drinks came on, but when entrees arrived the circling toilet water began to go down.  Our stakes arrived seriously under cooked mine ordered medium, was served rare and my wife's ordered well done came medium. After a 20 minute re-fire time, my steak came medium well and my wife's sides were changed saying they were out of carrots. The manager came to help resolve the issues but still, the night spiraled down. 45 minutes for dessert, the bill and one more entree( ordered with dessert, and came out 15 minutes after the dessert) the server picks up my card and now 15 minutes passed to get it back. In 2 hours and 20 minutes, the tables in front and back turned over twice. This is reason enough not to increase the minimum wage for such incompetence."
Sereena T.,"Sacramento, CA",122,113,78,5.0,2/23/2017,"So convenient to have the curbside pick up parking even at the mall! Lately I have been ordering over the phone -- You park in the assigned curbside parking, call the to-go line and they will bring your order out!  This location in particular seems super loud, and I was freezing last time I went for drinks with a friend, so I am not too compelled to dine in. I do not have any complaints about the food. It is not gourmet food, so I do not expect anything to decadent or fancy, but I do appreciate a precise and complete order every time I come!"
Melissa S.,"Sacramento, CA",19,515,297,2.0,7/31/2017,"I've come here many times in the past and have had much quicker service. Everytime I've come I've sat in on of the booths in the bar. The food was very tasty. I had the salmon and he had the ribs. Service was fine, I think it was just slow kitchen service."
Jess J.,"Winters, CA",0,23,6,4.0,11/16/2017,"We chose to eat here after our eye exam a few suites down. The man found a coupon online and we decided to give them a try. It had been 7 years the last time we tried this chain in another city. The special was to order $35 of food and get $10 off. Restaurant was busy, got sat down quickly and was waited on by Michael B. He was great, not to chatty, courteous and   recommended the hot wings. For drinks we got my ice tea and the mans Hefeweizen and later a Piranha Pale Ale. We ordered two appetizer's. One was the bone in chicken wings-hot and lemon Pepper flavored. The other was chips, salsa and guacamole. They were good, can't complain. For the main we ordered the deep dish medium pizza called, BJ favorite. It was really good pizza. The crust was crispy and not greasy and the vegetables were fresh! We mentioned just before ordering that we would use the special and at the end of dinner he mentioned that he would have to run that by the manger. We sat and waited a few minutes and thought maybe we would have issues. He came back showed the new total with $10 off! People forget that even with a coupon or Groupon used that one should tip based on the Original amount! Service industry is tough. The restaurant got really busy as we left with full tummies and good service. We thought that the chain should mention the special to patrons in the beginning of their meal because who wouldn't want to save a few bucks."
Ashley S.,"Sacramento, CA",157,105,94,3.0,6/30/2017,"BJ's restaurant is great when it comes to a nice casual dinner with some friends. Their menu has plenty of different things for anyone to try. I just wish their service was consistent. Some days I would sit, order, eat, and settled out in 45 minutes. Went there a few days ago and it took about 30-40 minutes for our food to come out and we have finished eating, it took about another 30 minutes just to find our server to get our check, and another 15 minutes to get us settled out! We were almost late to our movie..we ordered about 5:45 and we didn't leave until 7:20..when our movie was starting!"
Alex N.,"Arlington, VA",250,101,32,3.0,7/27/2017,"Solid 3 star. If you've ever been to a BJ's before, you know what you're signing up for and this locations holds true to the brand. I'm basing my rating primarily on the food - have had BJ's pizza before, and was pretty darn impressed. This night, however, it just wasn't the same. I hear that with chain restaurants, kitchens can vary dramatically, so I'm afraid this may not be the top tier BJ's kitchen. Would recommend to management to assess that. Otherwise, service was good, water was always filled - would be back if the time was right."
Jess H.,"Redding, CA",0,4,2,1.0,5/29/2017,"I typically love BJ's ever since I started working at the Arden Mall. It's my favorite place to go with my kids, whenever we have family in town or when I want an ice cold Blonde. I normally have great service from Mike or Athena up in the bar. My 30th birthday was this passed weekend of course I chose to have my birthday dinner there. I called on May 19th to see if they could accommodate a reservation of 20 at 7pm. The girl called me back and said her manager was able to do so.  When we arrived on the 27th at 7pm the hostess said they had no reservation. After explaining to her the situation she got her manager. The manager was extremely rude, pretty much called me a liar. He stated they had no reservation for us and that they would have never made a reservation on a Saturday night for 20 people. I then pulled up my call log and showed him where I called and received a call back. I also googled their location number to assure I called the correct location.  If I were him I would be scrubbing my previous schedule to see who was working during the time I called. He then said we could wait to see if they had any tables or we could go somewhere else. He was very concerned on how many of my party was actually there and ready to be sat if they could accommodate us. We had 14 currently there. He took me to the section where he was going to seat us to see if it was okay. It was going to be an end booth and a long table at the end of booth. This seemed like it would okay.  When the two hostesses sat us we were sat in two booths that were separated, 7 people in each, however, our reservation was for 20. Another group, in a booth was in between us. We were all very confused as this isn't what the manager had just shown me. The first hostess tossed the menus on the table before anyone even sat down. And instead of asking anyone to be seated she said ""I don't know why you all are staring at me!"" The other hostess kept insisting that this was all they could do and this where her boss told her to seat us. Meanwhile the middle of the section where we were going to be sat had three long tables that were unattended. The hostess said we could not sit there because it was for a reservation of 30 at 8pm. Wait a minute....I thought you don't make reservations like that?!?! I said ""this is ridiculous, I've never had such horrible service, we're just going to leave!"" The hostess kept saying, ""that's fine you can leave!"" I replied that she could shut up at anytime As she had a horrible attitude since we walked in and acted like we were an inconvenience to her. She was standing there not inviting us to sit or seeing if there was a possible better solution. Did I mention they were not busy and there was no one else on the wait list.  The tables weren't together, they would have never accommodated a party of 20 in the two booths, and they let a regular walk out of their establishment unsatisfied. The bottom line is we were there and whether we had a reservation or not they should have sat us together. The manager didn't even try to approach us again on the way out. I will never go back because of this horrible service. We instead went back to my house and ordered Mountain Mikes and it ended up being a much better choice."
Alex L.,"Sacramento, CA",4957,1547,3392,3.0,4/21/2016,"The hostesses are always overwhelmed and the noise level is always peaking the decibel meter. If you're lucky, as we were this night, you'll get a decent waitress who keeps your drinks refreshed, has good hearing and returns often.   Considering all the negatives, there is still a reason people keep coming back. In my opinion, it's a fantastic in-house brew selection and some pretty decent food. Weigh the positives and negatives when you decide whether to eat here."
Nate S.,"Carmichael, CA",36,9,,5.0,8/2/2017,"This BJs location is AWESOME!!!! Excellent service, great food, nice drinks and most importantly an amazing staff! The bartender Sara is fantastic, she always makes the drinks perfectly, provides world class customer service, and is very personable! She definitely deserves a raise for all of her hard work! :) I am a regular and she provides the most superior customer service out of anybody! (But all the employees at this location are great!) 5 stats just because of Sara!"
Raquel A.,"Orangevale, CA",46,67,10,1.0,9/8/2017,"I don't like going to a sit down restaurant and having a stressed out waitress because you guys sat her SIX TABLES all within 15 minutes, with one of them being a 10 person table. So not only was she hardly around and spoke a mile a minute, our salad and soup/entrees came out two minutes apart, and the food was barely lukewarm. So we spent almost 90 dollars on a shitty meal that wasn't hot, with a waitress doing the best she can with hosts who could give a shit less that she's one person trying to fufill the needs of 26 people all at different tables. To top it off, managers just stand around at this location. Most of our meal was seeing two assistant managers in clear sight talking it up forever while dinner rush hits at full speed. So it's ok for your employees to pick up the slack for bad lazy management who stand around, while we pay towards their salaries? Also, our whole meal took less than a half hour. I didn't go out to eat to  basically be thrown food, an expensive bill, and hasty goodbye. So frustrating and regretful I chose to eat here last night."
Jatin M.,"Sacramento, CA",50,151,5,4.0,7/5/2017,"Out of the numerous times I have been to other BJ's locations in Sacramento area (Natomas and Roseville to be specifc), I have never gotten better service than what I got yesterday at this location. I had a BOGO coupon and our sever was very helpful and accommodating. We didn't like one of our drinks and he gladly changed it for us. Didn't charge me for substituting toppings on my pizza. Thanks to my server, I had a great dining experience at BJ's at last!"
Missy T.,"Colusa, CA",16,12,2,1.0,9/28/2017,"My husband and I arrived early for dinner with my brother and his wife. I'll say we got there at 6:10 for our 6:30 dinner and put our name on the list while we waited for them to arrive. We happened to get sat before their arrival, wonderful we can get a couple drinks and order our appetizer while we wait for them. Our waitress shows, takes our drink order, a Dr Pepper for myself and an 805 for the man, we also ask for the Poke appetizer. She asked if we wanted it started then, we say Yes. She brings back the waters and my Dr Pepper and says she'll be right back with his beer. At least 15 minutes passes, our guests join the table, our waitress shows again, to ask for their drink order, still no 805, she says she'll check on that for him. We order two more cocktails and a fancy root beer at this time, and she says the poke should be right out. She brings the 805, two cocktails and no rootbeer. ""the keg is flat"". Ok.. we order dinner, still NO appetizer, I order a pasta and added a caeser salad, everyone else orders, she disappears. About 5 minutes later, my salad comes out, still NO appetizer. At this point my husband leaves our group to tell her to go ahead and cancel the scoop of raw fish that has literally taken close to 45 minutes at this point. Dinner comes, my pasta isn't everything I hoped for, it's bland, cold, and mushy. After dinner we wait with dirty plates for what we assume is the check... Nope, not once, not twice, but THREE times she came back to ask if we wanted dessert. We said No, thank you, ALL 3 TIMES! So now our nice quick dinner with family turned into a 2 hour affair where we didn't even get our appetizer. The restaurant was not packed, it wasn't busy, many open tables. No table touch by management, EVER.  I even left the table under the guise of using the restroom to find the manager to try to get some assistance, and I wasn't able to locate one, although I didn't specifically ask for one. As the manager, you should be visible and available to your customers. Your corporate office should be embarrassed. And if it's local owners, even worse. Lost long time customers this evening.  Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.  Poor Service Subpar food & a timesuck."
Carnage V.,"Fresno, CA",0,4,10,1.0,11/12/2016,Me and my buddy went to bj November 12 2016   Great customer service but food is horrible we order boneless BBQ wings for a appetizer and calamari eat about 3 wings and on the fourth one was not cooked all the way then my spaghetti and meatball came out and the meat balls where not cooked all the way my buddy got a ribi and it was mostly fat and no meat it's safe to say that the only thing that was good was the water and the server that we had I feel bad for her that there is just shit ass cooks that can not make food correctly they need new cooks end result I ended up in the restroom puking my guts out  will never recommend this place nor come back to this place
Joe M.,"Woodland, CA",70,142,288,4.0,10/30/2016,"Solid bj joint. Kinda the same as the natomas location. It can get packed but I've seen that with the other location as well. Service for me has been pretty good for all my visits. Unlike the other location, this one has a revolving door in front. If your done shopping and don't want food court, come swing by for some bj food"
John W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,4.0,10/10/2017,My wife and kid and I went for dinner on a Saturday. They do not make reservations so we called ahead of time and I was told we could be put on the weighting list which supposedly would make our wait in line shorter. It didn't make any difference we were told would be 10 was closer to 30 minutes. The food and service was great. The only bad thing was they only gave me about ¼ cup of mashed potatoes very skimpy. John w Sacramento CA
Alix V.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",7,30,1,1.0,8/7/2017,Worst service I've ever received in my life's the food has been horrible both times I've come here. Servers seem like they can't be bothered to help you. I'll happily drive 20 minutes up to the Folsom location. You couldn't pay me to come back here.
William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1740,1257,9441,3.0,1/6/2016,"After coming to the Elk Grove, Natomas, and the Roseville locations, I decided to pay a visit to this national restaurant chain called, ""BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse"" at Arden Way. I usually come to that place for quite some times, and I'm likely satisfied for this effort! Located outside Arden Fair Mall, BJ's has it all delivering their wonderful entrees, appetizers, drinks, and desserts to enjoy dining pleasures. The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most BJ's does. However, this place is quite smaller here despite the location which it attached to the mall, yet it does have some good, average space to dine in and heading to the bar side too. The employees are doing a good job here despite the environment of how busy it is. I'm sure they need to re-improved the customer service easier to make this place more reliable and motivated. Now onto the food! On 7/1/2015, I decided to ordered a happy hour appetizer meal: the chicken pot stickers and a glass of BJ's Blonde Ale. So far, the pot stickers tasted very good! The dippable sauce for the pot stickers did work the flavors too. The BJ's Blonde also tasted not bad at all for this light beer! Very crisp and bold for that ale! The next visit, on 1/5/2016, my father and I were visiting to the same place for an another try by redeeming their ""Buy One, Get One (BOGO) Free"" promotion offer during the lunch peek hours. We decided to ordered a Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl and a Lemon Thyme Chicken. As we ate it, the food is simply not bad. The Salmon Quinoa tasted good which it makes the seasoning very balanced. The Lemon Thyme Chicken is also tasted delicious too although it did add some salt a little bit as I continued to eat. I wish this plate needs to reduced the sodium content next time. Otherwise, it's a good, fine meal for lunch! There's tons of parking spaces available right outside Arden Fair Mall, so you can park anywhere you want near or far. All in all, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse at Arden Way is a good national restaurant chain that I really enjoyed dining here. I'll come back for more to try their incredible food and drinks every season! A worthy visit! My rating: 3 1/2 stars."
S. W.,"Sacramento, CA",3,67,33,4.0,3/28/2017,"Great drinks, great food, great waiter, and prompt service too.  I had the charbroiled salmon and my friend had the balsamic chicken and they were both VERY good. I love the mashed potatoes that my friend had and kept reaching into his plate to get more. The lemon pepper wings are really good as well and cooked to perfection.  I had a strawberry margarita and the waiter heard me tell my friend to get his with sugar so he put sugar on mine too, great service.  Our food came out VERY fast and we didn't have to wait for anything!!!! I can't wait to go back, I even signed up for their premier rewards!!"
Wissali R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",163,1,,3.0,9/20/2017,You have to wait in line forever to be seated. Food is great. The desserts are great! Just have to have to wait for so long to be seated
