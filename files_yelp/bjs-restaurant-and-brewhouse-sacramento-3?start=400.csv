Mey S.,"Sacramento, CA",35,33,57,4.0,2/23/2012,"The wait is kinda long here so I suggest the call ahead service they have since they don't take reservations.  I came here during night times and it's always busy. The food here is delicious.  The wontons are yummy but the portion is kinda small, only 3 pieces for like under $4. The appetizer sampler is a good dish to share.  I never knew avocado eggroll can taste so good too!  Beware that it's spicy too!  I like the variety of food they have.  I had try their mini-pan pizza and the crust was very puffy, love it.  The mini-pizzas are 50% off during happy hr.  Also, one beer got me feeling good so the beer must be strong or I'm just weak.   I've been here two times and have experienced good customer service.  One time it took awhile to get our waitress'  attention but she had a really nice attitude n plus it's during a busy night so I can't complain.   In case you don't know, they have restrooms inside the restaurant too.  My friend missed the restroom sign and went outside to the restrooms in the mall.  I thought that was funny."
Patrick M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",218,493,113,3.0,10/26/2013,Well what can you say about this place? It''s a chain that offers standard run of the mill bar and grill food. Yup that is about it. Nothing special at all about this place. The good thing is that no matter what location you go to the food is always the same and you know what you are getting when you order. As to this location it is BUSY as any location I have ever been to. The service is really horrible here. The lesson is if you are stuck and just need some generic food to fill you up this is it. Otherwise skip it and go elsewhere.
Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17,4.0,2/22/2013,"This BJ's has been a welcome addition to the Arden Fair Mall because the food options were not always so great at this mall. My kids and my mother all love eating here, so we are here fairly often.  On this particular occasion we were here on President's Day for a late lunch. When we walked in we were quoted a wait of 20 minutes and they gave us a pager. This was a first for us, having to wait at this location. Once we were seated we ordered right away because everyone was hungry and close to meltdown. We ordered a large BJ's combo pizza with salads for the adults to start and applesauce for the kids. We also asked for bread to avert a crisis situation. The waitress said she could do that and we were very grateful.  The pizza here is pretty good and a large leaves us with leftovers to take home to my grandmother, who also likes the pizza. The crust is very soft so it works well for kids and the elderly alike. We like it for the chunky tomato sauce and tasty toppings. Everything is pretty standard at every BJs I have ever been to, food wise.  Service can be hit or miss depending on the day and your party size. On this particular day since they were so busy things were a touch slow but our server was friendly enough and accomodated our cranky kids pretty well."
Ken H.,"Sacramento, CA",3,22,7,3.0,2/28/2015,"Somewhat disappointed. ...tried their Lasagne, it was very dry and too much Ricotta cheese"
Tierra T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/11/2015,"The employees at this location always go above and beyond to make sure you are well taken care of, whether you're seated at the bar or at the regular tables they are attentive to your needs. They also do an amazing job at keeping up the maintenance of the building from empty tables to the restroom. I've never had a bad experience!"
Mark S.,"Woodland, CA",7,188,171,3.0,12/30/2013,"The BJ's at the Arden Fair mall is nice; however, as with every BJ's the service is slow and not good. The beers are mediocre and the food only slightly better. I recommend trying another restaurant."
Rubi A.,"Sacramento, CA",8,4,,1.0,10/28/2013,"Worst customer service, ever.  My party wasn't attended for about 20 minutes. Mind you this was around 10PM and it wasn't at all busy. We got our drinks and appetizers about another 20 minutes later. When our food finally arrived about 40 minutes later. Our food was cold and 1 of the orders were wrong.  I am very disappointed in their customer service"
Jason B.,"Yuba City, CA",14,34,26,4.0,4/1/2015,Food is always good!! Dessert is really good.. service can depend on who your server is.. for the most part usually pretty good.. but sometimes u get the ones Wii aren't quit as attentive.. u realy can't go wrong with what you order!! When I'm down in Natomas this is one of the places I enjoy going!!
Brandon M.,"Sacramento, CA",188,190,14,5.0,7/5/2013,"For a joint that is a chain, I really like BJ's....erm....brewhouse. I was there with my wife for a BOGO deal...FACEBOOK FRIEND THEM...SERIOUS GOOD DEALS. She had a pork chop, I had the salmon....not the usual fair at BJ's but we figured why not splurge with the BOGO deal. Our meals were awesome and both are highly recommended. We also ordered the corn hush puppies and corn bread....for $2.95 they are a deal and super delicious. I tried the hoppy bison, which is their IPA mixed with a stout and it tasted how it sounds...and stout with an IPA bite....meh, I would try it but not do it again. We love this place for a good meal and a decent price."
Blake F.,"Sacramento, CA",5,21,2,5.0,3/26/2014,"I have been here with friends multiple times and the food and service is always exceptional, evident of a company well managed and staffed. The Fresh Atlantic Salmon is excellent, as is the Moroccan spiced salmon plate. I love their chicken tortilla soup that is poured onto your plate right in front of you. Our last time here, our server even replaced a side dish that was perfectly made but I didn't really care for, without me having to ask. Seeing a business go above and beyond to serve their guests is refreshing and the mark of great customer service. Mr. Gary Ford is often the night manager during our visits and is always helpful in attending to any needs or requests. As a whole, their service throughout the restaurant always appears fluid and orderly. We have never had a bad experience at BJs and without hesitation they deserve 5 stars. I love dining at BJs and would even love to work there, maybe one day they'll finally hire me!  Until then I'll continue enjoying their wonderful food and service at a great price."
Jessica C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,65,69,4.0,3/2/2014,"Much smaller location but the food was still great. Service wasn't over the top. My boyfriend ordered the Brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger... Honestly I couldn't tell the difference between the two but whatever, they were both good. Everything was hot when brought out and very flavorful. The pizookie of course was delishhhhh!"
M G.,"Pacific Grove, CA",5,141,91,5.0,3/17/2015,Visiting Sacramento for my partners birthday!!  Made a reservation for 10.  Had our table ready to go and our waiter was awesome!!  (forgot his name.....) We got drink orders taken right away and our orders came out promptly and everything was yummy!!  Now a lot of BJ's the food is good and even the wait staff is good BUT the food takes FOREVER to come out....not here.......had a GREAT experience on a busy Saturday night!!!  (March 14)  Our waiter always checked on us and we were never rushed.....that was really nice!!!   Recommend this place!!!!  Thank you!!!!
R M.,"Sacramento, CA",3,144,3,4.0,2/1/2014,"Stopped in tonight after shopping, and was Pleasantly surprised with the food, since I've never really been all that impressed with it, apart from the pizookie. Everything we had tonight was great- cheese sticks, deep dish pepperoni pizza, and the Moroccan salmon were all perfectly cooked and flavorful. Will be back again soon next time we're at the mall- good service and a good experience."
Jason C. J.,"San Francisco, CA",1500,983,612,4.0,3/27/2013,"After a long day of driving from SF to Sac and then Auburn and back, my relatives and I stopped at BJ's for dinner. We were greeted and seated quickly since it was 10 something at night.  Our pretty waitress, Galyna, was friendly and very patient with us since my uncle is an elderly man who is somewhat hard of hearing and loves to give servers a hard time. If our server is reading this, THANKS FOR PUTTING UP WITH US!!! xD Food: Housemade Italian Meatballs Chicken Parmigiana with Spicy Marinara Spaghetti Shrimp Scampi Pasta  Food arrived at our table in 23 minutes since the restaurant was also pretty crowded. I think the only one complaint my relative had was for the time it took for his diet coke to be refilled. I had the berry cider, so I was okay with just one drink. Otherwise, we'd have to make many pit stops on the way back to San Francisco.  Overall, great experience and kept our tummies happy."
Tracy K.,"Sacramento, CA",1,36,,5.0,5/8/2015,"I love this restaurant! The service is always on point and the food is fresh and delicious! We had Shawn319 as our server yesterday and we really appreciated the amazing customer service! He was very attentive, friendly and a great server! We will be back soon!"
Mike H.,"Sacramento, CA",209,244,53,3.0,8/22/2013,"I LOVE the place!!! Well, from a chain perspective.. I love the resturant! We ordered food to go since we were tired from shoppin all night.  To go service was slow... she was nowhere to be found for a while.  Once she showed up she was super friendly and helpful. But that's where it ended.... the food took FOREVER... which was not her fault but the order was wrong.  Not sure who's fault that is but either way I was unhappy that I didn't get what I ordered and it wasn't very good. Maybe just eat inside and don't get take out from here... you know what they say.. ""They F*&K you in the drive-thru""  Check your shiz before you go home! haha!!  Whatever, I love this resturant and will be going back because I am a creature of habit... haha"
Justin C.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",10,15,6,1.0,2/9/2013,"My wife and I just got done driving and long drive back from Los Angeles. we ordered to New York steaks with vegetables and baked potato for takeout. we both requested for this stakes to be medium well. once we got home both steaks were very rare! plus the vegetables that are supposed to be steamed were rock hard like they just came out of the fridge. I called the manager to explain my frustration. he said that he would send me us gift card for the amount that we paid. but my wife does not want to eat there anymore. so I went in and talk to another manager and requested a refund. I told him I still have the food. He said that's not how we do things here sorry.  terrible customer service, I feel like I was ripped off for 50 dollars! I am never going back there again and I will never recommend anyone to go there. Justin J C"
Christian J.,"Sacramento, CA",277,1,4,2.0,12/14/2012,"Do not eat here if you have a large party or if you don't plan on staying here for longer than 3 hours. They don't do reservations and calling ahead doesn't seem to do you any good anyways.  I called in the afternoon to set up a reservation (a service which they do not provide) and the employee told me to call 30 minutes before hand so that we would be first priority. We weren't seated until 9:30, an hour after I had originally wanted us to eat. Then it took another hour for us to receive our food and then after we ate it take another hour for us to get our checks and leave. I'm not sure what happened on this Thursday night but the service shouldn't have been this slow. We arrived at 8:30 p.m. and weren't able to leave until almost midnight.  As others have reviewed previously, the food is good and the venue is nice but it's all overshadowed by the horrible waiting time."
Jenny N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/27/2015,Don't go there for sunday brunch.  No coffee refill slow service. Fries came but no condiments offered. Finally got it 15 mins late.
Jason J.,"Sacramento, CA",239,143,194,3.0,4/24/2013,"My first time at this location wasn't the best; the service was slow and the food was bland. Today, a colleague of mine was craving a burger and I was dying for the avocado egg rolls (which is a must have); with BJ's next door, I decided to give it another chance. We went to lunch around 1:20pm, the restaurant was pretty busy but luckily the bar was open. We were greeted right away by Amy, presenting us a with a menu. She asked us what beverages we would like to have, suggesting a variety of different beers (unfortunately we were on lunch time) and if we were ready for any starters, offering us some suggestions. We totes agreed on the avocado egg rolls, which i find the best way to start. After given time to think, I decided to get the lunch size pasta & salad. I got the house salad with blue cheese dressing and the scampi pasta. The salad was dec and the pasta was a little wet. If it wasn't for Amy and the avocado egg rolls, my rating would probably be more like 2 stars."
