Julia N.,"Sacramento, CA",91,98,71,5.0,3/12/2013,"I've been writing a lot of negative reviews lately, so here's a change of pace! Short: Food is always yummy, drinks are nice, service is mostly good, prices are alright. I can always count on consistency, for a chain this place is awesome!  I come here because it's open late and I know its good. My absolute obsession/addiction is the Avocado Spring Rolls. OMG SO FREAKIN' GOOD. I love them, there's no denying! The creamy and fresh avocado filling that's slightly tangy with little gems of soft pine nuts in every other bite. The best part is the dipping sauce it comes with, like the sky meets the ocean and the land is born. Okay, that's a bit dramatic. But it's good, try it! Pizookie, no argument that it's amazing. I wish they had more personal sized ones though. Happy hour after 10PM means $2 off appetizers. What a coincidence, my favorite dish happens to be one! The drinks are pretty good, but don't get anything premixed. Their long island might as well be water, totally weak. The waitress said that they were all like $8-$9 but -$1 for happy hour = $9.50? Doesn't make sense, but she recommended a pretty good drink so eh, what the hell. (Peach margarita is tres bien! I think that might be French though :P) When they had the two for $20 special, we got kinda bad service. I didn't mind but my cousin stole the pizza dried pepper and cheese shakers to express her dissatisfaction. Yes, she was sober... Overall consistent, nice atmosphere, and open late. Definitely recommend if you're in the area and unwilling to drive to midtown or downtown area."

Mindy J.,"Sacramento, CA",17,19,5,5.0,1/19/2015,"I did the call ahead and got seated within 10 min!! We loved the fish and chips, can't wait to come back."
Jewels M.,"Yuba City, CA",177,38,26,5.0,11/8/2014,"Bj's is truly one of my favorite restaurants! I love getting the crispy fried artichokes appetizer and then for my main dish I usually share with someone and get the amazing and tasty parmesan chicken or a deep dish, gluten free or flat bread pizza. It all matters when I'm there and who I'm with but those are my favs!  I love a deal so whenever it works out I go for happy hour. They offer the California flat bread pizza (half size) for $4 and the personal mini deep dish for $6 as well as many other great options.  Tip- They only have one gluten free pizza option and it's a 10 inch so when you order the mini deep dish during happy hour they'll let you order the gluten free option for the same price ($6) with any toppings you want. It's seriously the best gluten free pizza you'll ever taste. I get mine a little well done and it's almost tastes the same as their flat bread.  That and they offer some pretty great happy hour drinks as well. I enjoy the ($5) lemon drop.  After all or that if you didn't eat too much you have to try a pizookie! Yummy!  I'm getting so hungry now! I wish I lived closer to a BJ'S location.  You know it's my favorite when I drive nearly an hour just to go eat there.  Side note- If you haven't done so yet I highly recommend that you sign up for their rewards card. You don't have to carry the card on you! They can look it up or if you download the app they can scan your card that way! Plus when you sign up you get a free pizookie. :D Enjoy your yummy lunch/dinner!"
Sundiata C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,41,,2.0,8/7/2014,"I've come here before and usually get better food and service. My friends ordered some drinks, the piña coloda tasted like Benadryl. They messed up our order, were slow on the water, and then didn't speak to us after we paid; just stepped up and cleaned our table without saying a word. And there was a moth flying around our table."
Cilla C.,"Sacramento, CA",69,22,9,3.0,1/11/2015,"Came here with my bf and friend . Got a good spot to sit , only waited 15-20 min . Got an appetizer of chicken wings and it sucked , had no taste at all basically plain . After got my bacon burger that was $10 , didn't finish because I ate my bf $25 steak with asparagus it was good . My burger was dry had to take it home because didn't finish but overall the service was a B+ good job !"
Stephanie T.,"Sacramento, CA",273,434,43,3.0,12/29/2012,"I usually come here after a long day of classes at Sac State, and I just want to relax. The service here is always great, which really surprises me since they must deal with a lot of annoying high schoolers from the mall.  I love how this place is open late, so if you don't finish class until 9pm, you still have plenty of time to enjoy a nice dinner or Happy Hour.  I really enjoy the pizza and burgers here. Those are the two main things I order, besides the Pizookie, of course! The drinks here are always good too. If you're underage, or don't drink alcohol, the Mocktails are nice."
Shonda J.,"Sacramento, CA",1,9,,4.0,2/4/2015,Everyone here is always so nice . I love the Parmesan chicken and the beer of course. Waiters and waitresses are always on top of things and to make my night they always give me the best pazookies.
Kandyce T.,"Citrus Heights, CA",2,17,4,1.0,9/19/2014,Horrible...just horrible! I ordered clam chowder and a ceasar salad..the ceasar had absolutely no flavor and there were definitely some questionable pieces of lettuce in there. The clam chowder looked awesome but was luke warm...had our server bothered to check in with us during the meal I would have made her aware of this.  I will not be back.
Jean S.,"Sacramento, CA",203,244,1450,2.0,6/28/2014,"I usually Love BJ's, but I did not like my last experience at this location. The main reason was the food. It didn't taste good. I always order the avocado egg rolls and chicken wings, but this time at Arden, the chicken wings did not taste right and the avocado egg rolls were not tasty at all. Not even the dipping sauce for the egg rolls was good. Usually, at any BJ's I've been to, these two orders are really delicious and flavorful, but they really sucked at Arden BJ's. The presentation was just awful too. The avocado egg rolls were ugly, very poorly cut, awfully presented, and smaller than usual! They must use bad quality ingredients too cuz the chicken just did not taste good. Furthermore, I ordered a kids meal of chicken tenders, mashed potato, milk, and a pizookie for my little boy. He ended up throwing up in the middle of the night!! And he NEVER throws up! That's how I know something was really bad at the restaurant. Be careful when dining at this BJ's. I would definitely recommend choosing a different location."
Bates B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,4,,5.0,12/11/2014,I eat here often. I have found the staff very accommodating and quick to respond to special requests.  Prices are very reasonable.
Patti R.,"Sacramento, CA",105,549,113,2.0,11/3/2012,"Service here has really gone downhill. Forgotten items, extremely slow service, dirty utensils and health codes violations regarding serving of food items in a sanitary manner are largely ignored. Telling a mgr seems to do nothing as service is worse and worse. This is too bad as I like BJ's for their beer and food. They need to get it together....fast."
Kristie F.,"Sacramento, CA",349,211,359,5.0,4/2/2011,"After what seemed like MONTHS of construction, it's finally opened! I personally love BJ's for the great food and customer service and this location was no exception!  Our server was super friendly and came to check up on us frequently.  My friend and I came on a weekend evening and the restaurant was SUPER CROWDED, but what do you expect when its dinnertime at a mall?  We were really lucky that since it was just the 2 of us, there was only a short wait. I love all the burgers here!  I probably have tried every single one on the menu o__0 As a newly 21-year-old, my friend ordered me a magarita.  Tip: you might not want to drink the magarita first before the food comes out because you might get a little intoxicated ... hahaha.  The magarita was $9 thought.  A little pricey to me...  5 stars nonetheless! :]"
Abigail L.,"Sacramento, CA",556,632,1580,4.0,6/23/2013,I went here for dessert and I got the red velvet pizookie. I love red velvet so I figured I would like this too. Unfortunately I wasnt able to eat all of it since it was just so sweet. I also tried the raspberry chocolate pizookie which was probably my favorite one there. I didnt really care for the oreo pizookie so I wouldnt get that again. The service was okay but it seemed like I waited a while for my desserts.
Jay S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,41,3,3.0,3/23/2015,What a beautiful place for Sacramento!  The burger was great. But the french fries were soggy. I love the selection of beers. Definitely will come back for the beers. Only problem was it was difficult to find parking close by.
Kristina F.,"Woodland, CA",144,345,205,4.0,12/12/2012,"The food is standard, the beer is great, and if you're out on a weekend without a place to go around Arden late night with friends, BJ's is open late!   They have small bites from $3 and up to go with your adult beverage. I had a drink called the Strawberry Patch, it had bicardi in it and tasted really watered down.    Nice dim lighting.  Efficient customer service."
Simone S.,"Miami, FL",41,119,293,4.0,6/15/2014,"Update, yesterday had a business lunch, though to give BJ's anther chance! and I tried the salmon and it was excellent!"
Charmayne Y.,"Vallejo, CA",389,80,127,3.0,12/6/2012,"I used to frequent this particular BJ's on my lunches and after work and there are several menu items that are wonderful.  The chicken teriyaki (I add in shrimp since I'm a foodie) and it is incredible.  Perfectly seasoned and the flavor is great.  Be warned the serving size is outta control and even at lunch, once, three of us shared it and it was perfect with a few appetizers.   Only reason for star deduction is that sometimes it can be noisy- yes I know it's a brewhouse. But it is a great place to watch games and enjoy a beverage. I've tried several and have never been disappointed.  Also, there have been times when the soup for the soup and salad isn't hot.  Not sure if it's because the bowl is cold when the tortilla soup is brought out but that is a missed opportunity there.  Otherwise, I say go and enjoy!"
Giana I.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,1,2.0,2/11/2015,"Ughh seated ourselves, waiter told us she was too tired to care where we sat. 15 mins... Guy slams plates down literally sighs, says nothing and leaves I love bjs but the waiters here are sad."
Michelle M.,"Sacramento, CA",228,602,2721,4.0,5/4/2011,Great food !! there is wait time if you go during rush hour but it's worth it.
