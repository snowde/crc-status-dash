Natalie C.,"San Ramon, CA",134,24,,5.0,11/11/2014,Thank you To the waitress with the first name beginning with an A For your excellent service! Its veterans day and you made us feel welcome! We sat outside to dine and the atmosphere was pleasant with the heaters on. The fried chicken was surprisingly delicious. The meat was juicy and tender so the cook did ab excellent job because usually fried chicken tastes dry in other places.
Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",89,315,21,4.0,4/16/2011,"Decent food and service. The restaurant had a nice cozy feeling.  It's at Arden Fair mall, so parking is what it is. Shockingly, it wasn't packed like the one in Natomas. The lighting in the place was a bit weird at lunch time.  Alot of glare coming in the front windows made the front booths difficult to see across to the other side of the booth.   And maybe I'm just getting old, but the music was a little loud. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy listening to Axl Rose screech about Paradise City, but I'd rather that the server be able to understand my order more. Definitely will go back and try the Happy Hour specials."
Jolanne T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,16,1,2.0,6/11/2012,"So, I've been the main caregiver for my mom for the past few months and tonight my nieces came over to give me a break.  I said I was going to Arden Fair to look at the new Apple Computers and then I really wanted pizza and beer.  They said go to BJ's.  I sat for about 5 minutes before the waitress came over.  She brought me water and a menu. I politely asked for lime for my water.  About 7 minutes later she came back and asked if I wanted a drink. I asked for a long island and for lime one more time.  Another 7 minutes later, I went up to the bar and got my own lime!  I was halfway through my water when she finally came by with lime!!! I ordered a mini pizza, light sauce.  Receive a pizza with no sauce.  The long island tasted more like sweet and sour and triple sec. My waitress did check on me once after she tried to give me two other peoples bills.  It's been a long process of taking care of my mom and I am grateful to be able to do so, but I just needed an evening where someone waited on me.  I soooo didn't get that at BJ's.   Decided to go home and make my own drink and sit outside. Saved money and enjoyed the atmosphere ten times better! One last point.  I was sitting where many of the wait staff were coming and going. One, just one smiled back at me when we made eye contact.  I am a former bar and restaurant owner and CUSTOMER SERVICE is a MUST."
Vanessa C.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,23,8,1.0,9/27/2013,"Came here for dinner, wait wasn't too bad for two, about 25 minutes. Got seated and waited about 15 minutes just to see our sever and order drinks. When we finally got our drinks and food we sat there for 20 minutes trying to flag someone down for a refill. Food was very bland, my tomato soup consisted of all olive oil. The Cesar salad tasted  nothing like Cesar.  Overall  Service sucked  Food sucked Had a much better experience at Elk Grove BJs"
Jennifer S.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",90,115,461,1.0,4/18/2014,"Ugh with so many good restaurants in Sacramento, I had to stop in this one. Although the staff was friendly, they took forever the duration of the meal. The food was good if you like Applebee's and TGIF's (which is by the way microwaved). No flavor on the California club or the fried chicken. I was very disappointed and it wasn't worth my time or money."
Menoride Y.,"Sacramento, CA",8,64,2,4.0,8/5/2013,You can never go wrong with burgers at BJ's.  Pizzas are good too for large party.  They have many beers on tap.  I go on a binge here sometimes but not with their home brew though.  Their brew tend to make me sleepy (too much hop?) Sign up for their membership program.  It's a great deal.  You'll get many free offers in e-mail.  Then check-in with your member code every time you eat here to get reward points.  Too bad alcohols don't count.  :( Tell them it's your birthday to get a free pizooki.  Go ahead.  They don't check.
Emma K.,"Sacramento, CA",2,2,3,1.0,7/10/2014,DO NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR.  I called ahead for two tables 3 people and 2 people. We told them about call ahead the said 10 minutes for 2 people 15 minutes for 3. We then dat their and watched people who came in after us get seated before us. I go up and ask them if our tables are almost ready. They tell us your table is being cleaned. Five minutes later I ask about our table they tell us the same thing. At this point my entire party is really ticked off and annoyed and then they tried to seat my parents at a horrible table and wouldnt move them. Moral of the story don't go to this BJs unless you have tons of time to sit around be ignored  and wait.
Candace T.,"Newark, CA",3,19,,5.0,10/13/2014,"Went with my son and granddaughter on a Saturday around 5pm. It was packed because of the Giants playoff game so everyone was in a great mood. The food was SUPERB! Had the combo sampler appetizer, then I had the shrimp scampi which was the best I've ever had and I've been to a LOT of restaurants. My granddaughter had the Parmesan crusted chicken that was HEAVENLY...lightly cooked and seasoned. Then we had a half salted  carmel, half chocolate chip PIZZOOKIE and it was sooooooo goooood and gooey! All around best dinner I've had in a while. :-) Service was great."
Sandy T.,"San Francisco, CA",303,373,418,4.0,9/16/2012,"Got the $19.99 dinner for two (2 salads or soup, pizza, and a pizookie), an order of pasta, crispy calamari, and another salad for 4. We were well fed and had two slices of pizza and some pasta leftover CRISPY CALAMARI [+] was delicious! No wonder it's the signature appetizer [+] two sauces for dip [+] and there's lemon slices to add flavor! TUSCAN CHICKEN LIMONE PASTA [+] chicken was soft and tender [+/-] was pretty good, but not very memorable [-] pasta lacked flavor BACON CHEESEBURGER PIZZA [+] tastes JUST like a cheeseburger! [+] a burger pizza!? The flavors worked well [+] and there's BACON PIZOOKIE [+] a soft freshly baked cookie [+] various kinds of cookies of your choice [+] with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top! Yummmm I don't go to BJ's often but when I do, I always get the pizookie. But really, you can't really go wrong with this place. It's a good group dinner place and there's something on the menu for everyone. And it tastes pretty good!"
Gina H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/18/2015,Hannah was the best waitress! Great food. Great turn around. Always happy to come by.
D S.,"Redding, CA",2,13,,4.0,10/7/2013,"Best pizza in Sacramento! We only wish we had a BJ's in Redding, so we could have it more often."
Mr M.,"Sacramento, CA",5,9,,5.0,1/20/2015,Fav restaurant and the scooby snack are awesome green shot drinks u can take their AT the bar. 10$ a shot.
Karina V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/22/2015,"I went in on Monday night (party of 5). We definitely got the best service we could have ever asked for. Our server Josh met all our needs! We never had to ask for refills on our drinks or wait around with empty cups for him to come around to refill. Will definitely be going back to this location and asking for him to be my server, and hopefully he will be my server every time I go in to eat at this location."
Tammy R.,"Rocklin, CA",1,23,16,1.0,2/15/2014,"I'm completely stunned that a chain of this caliber would allow a dish to go out on the floor looking like mine did.  I guess you *barely* get what you pay for.  Coworkers and I had lunch here and 2 of us orders the lunch Brewhouse burger.  It came to the table looking like a regurgitated piece of meat.  We all thought it looked like it had been dropped in the floor a few times (pics posted).  My friends burger looked similar, but, his was less noticeable covered in melted cheese.  Not a big fan of this place anyway, now, I will definitely never return.  The cooks should watch the food channel to understand how presentation can affect someone's order.  Horrible!"
Jessica S.,"Sacramento, CA",26,123,2,2.0,5/4/2013,"It's been awhile since I've been to this location. I was disappointed the waiter, waitress was too confusing we had 3 of them tell us they were are waiter. The Resturant was so cold by the time I got my food took my first bite my food was cold. I wasn't able to enjoy my food."
Michelle K.,"Montgomery, AL",9,12,1,5.0,6/1/2014,I love their pazookies. The revolving door in the front is annoying but they have good service and after I go shopping I always end up here.
Aman G.,"Roseville, CA",11,24,4,3.0,8/26/2014,"The food is decent, (the ones in Roseville and Natomas are way better) but the service really sucks. I had to ask 4 different waiters for ranch multiple times and still never got any. They messed up my order too and were not attentive."
Elif F.,"Sacramento, CA",266,167,3,1.0,1/12/2012,"Never again.  Look don't promise you are going to sit a large group in 15 minutes and then an hour later say...sorry the party at your table, which there are only two left are changing a baby's diaper, you have to wait until they leave.  The table was empty.  And then we waited another 20 minutes.  An hour and 20 minutes to sit down to eat after being told 15 minutes, getting really rude attitude from the front receptionist ladies, and then the food comes out wrong.   Nope, didn't think you were that fantastic to begin with, now, NEVER again.  I'm going to tell everyone know not to go here."
Amy A.,"West Sacramento, CA",134,39,,2.0,9/27/2015,"Our first visit today.  Extremely slow and uninterested service.  Our server didn't seem to care about our table at all.  Our beers took forever to arrive, and we had to ask where they were.  The food was mediocre.  The sliders--WOW, I have had better presented dishes at 3 am at Denny's.  The artichoke appetizer was borderline burnt.  We were very disappointed in both the service and the food.  Prices were high considering the quality and lack of style as far as presentation.  I have written an online note to the corporate office -- I am hoping to hear back.  The table next to us was having problems too, with their food taking forever to arrive.  Servers-- when people have kids, please don't take forever to bring the food.  At least offer some bread if the kitchen is slow.  Please."
D C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,21,4,3.0,9/21/2014,"I go to BJ's a lot. Every single time I leave satisfied. However, I usually go to the one in Vacaville because it's closer. Last night, I came here with my boyfriend after walking the mall. It was around 10 pm and it was pretty busy for a Friday night. We got seated quickly and we met our server. She was really nice and was definitely one of the best servers I've ever had out of all the ones that I've been to. I ordered a top sirloin with a baked potato and caesar salad. I got the salad first and it was okay. It was kind of sour and some pieces of lettuce were pretty limpy. I didn't get a lot of croutons either, but whatever. When I got the sirloin and baked potato, the meat looked dry and the potato was just warm. I didn't complain too much about the potato because it was soft enough but the meat kinda bothered me a little bit. I usually cut the top sirloin into bite-sized pieces but this portion was really tough. There were some dry and chewy parts, but there were some softer and juicier parts too. I don't know, it kinda felt like the meat was just reheated. It should've been a lot better than that considering it's around $13. So, the only thing that really pissed me off was a customer. I know BJ's can't control the customers they get but this one guy was out of control. It seemed like he was drunk, but he was talking really loud and he said some inappropriate things. Shouldn't he have been kicked out by then? I looked at some of the families around us and they didn't look too happy since they had kids with them. I was hoping that a server or the manager would tell him to keep it down - especially since so many servers walked by. Instead, a server kept bringing him beer and his actions got worse and worse. Yeah, it was already pretty loud in there but the things he said should not have been heard across the room. The servers just seemed to laugh it off, too. Don't hate the guy, just wish the employees did something about his actions."
