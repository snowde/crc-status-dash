Alex T.,"Sacramento, CA",1316,1002,6438,4.0,5/26/2014,came here for theur happy hour which wasnt bad. 5 bucks for any pizza is a deal. also ordered a mix drink berry mojito which was bad the alcohol was so low and the sweetness was like way too sweet most likely wont order a drink unless its a shot or beer. the service was great and attentive. will be bacm again.
Sam B.,"San Antonio, TX",82,254,21,2.0,4/14/2012,"Every time I come here with friends, they talk about how good the pizza is. And every time they do, I just feel bad for them. It must be pretty sad to live in a place with so many wonderful pizza options and think that this is as good as it gets. The food here is okay at best. The pizza is a Chicago-style deal with the very thick crust and the diced tomatoes, but it really just doesn't taste that great. I've had some of the other things, and the experience is about the same. The pasta is okay. The lunch stuff (like the tacos) are okay. But for what you're paying, I'd expect something better. Not being a drinker, I can't really speak to the beers here, but I understand that the variety is vast. That's a plus, if you're coming for that sort of thing. I, however, come to restaurants for the food. And here, it's all Randy Jackson: it's just alright for me, dawg."
Vicky Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",292,489,167,4.0,12/3/2012,"Co-workers and I planned on ordering the salmon, but when the time came, my fatty side won over. I ordered the Mini Pizza w/ olives & house salad. The house salad was better than expected and the pizza was big enough for two meals. My co-worker's shoestring fries stood out as the favorite. I'm not a big fan of chains, but I would consider coming back for this lunch special."
Robert R.,"Sun City, CA",37,231,2,2.0,3/31/2013,"One thing I've noticed that is common for all BJ's is SLOW service, and this place is no exception to that rule. If it weren't for the decent beer, I would not eat at BJs as often as I do. The menu selection is good but one can grow quickly tired of it; the food is good but not great. I must say that the pizza is better than average. On my last visit, they had immediate seating but offered me to sit in the bar area if I wanted. I said sure, that sounded great. I went to the bar area and they were completely full (you would think that they would be aware of this before asking me). So I returned to the hostess and then they told me I would have to wait 15 minutes for a table---even though they misinformed me! There were empty tables. So I left. Screw that!"
Steve L.,"Sacramento, CA",104,326,1,2.0,3/17/2012,"BJ's, the brewhouse with the unfortunate name, is big on theme, which is alcohol.  Mirrored shelves of hard liquor rise high above the bar, gleaming like the church of DUI. When we sat down as a family for brunch, our server asked if we wanted to start with Midori Sours. Um, no, dear - especially not the 13-year old. Speaking of service, turns out BJ's isn't so big on that. Ten minutes and counting before anybody stopped by to say hello. And while our server was keen on upselling us to liquid lunches, she didn't bring water or a sweetner tray for coffee and tea (we heisted one from another server), and her delivery of condiments consisted of slamming down a plastic catsup bottle on the table. On to the food - okay, I guess. Our son really liked his bacon cheeseburger and fries, and the wife thought her turkey club with avocado was good. I had a breakfast pizza - flatbread and marinara sauce topped by what was alleged to be a sausage and mozzarella omelette. Let's just say the flavors were elusive. BJ's is nothing more than another mediocre chain where employees try really hard to sling drinks. No reason to make a special trip to a place like this. I wish California Cafe' was still there."
Victoria S.,"Gilroy, CA",13,11,2,1.0,11/20/2013,"I attempted to visit this restaurant on Friday 11/15 and when I entered I was created by no one. I stood there with my friend and neither or I was acknowledged; needless to say after 10 minutes of standing there. ( I even walked up to the host and attempted to talk with her.) I left the restaurant and went elsewhere.  The next day on 11/16 I was in the Arden area again, I decided many the previous day was probably just a special circumstance so my Aunt and I decided to take lunch at BJs again. I assumed it would be busy so we arrived there about 1:20. When we got there my Aunt asked for sitting outdoor because we were on a schedule and the hostess flat out refused us. She said ""No~ you have to wait 10 to 15 minutes to be seated out there."" Neither of us understood why because there were only 2 tables occupied in the outdoor area. Finally at 1:45 we were called to be seated, I remember because by this time I was saying ""okay well if they take any longer we will just leave."" Specifically we were never told the wait would be longer than 10 - 15 minutes so when it changes to 20-25 minutes the Host should let people know. Anyways, we handed her back our buzzer and she told us Amy would take us to a table. So we went to the backside of the Hostess booth and stood there, waiting, waiting and waiting. Again, no acknowledgement  and there was a woman standing there, she just stared at us like we were crazy. Until finally my Aunt asked, ""So is anyone going to seat us?""  The woman who was standing there; who I am assuming was the manager on duty ( she was in a chambray (denim colored) button down shirt and she had short brown hair) was flippant and rude in her answer. She was like "" Well did someone call your number?"" and I was like "" Yeah we gave her the buzzer and she told us someone would seet us."" Then suddenly a girl in a black cardigan came rushing in from nowhere before the ""manager woman"" said anything else and fumbled grabbing menus as she herded us out to a table.  As we were walking away the manager woman felt the need to add in a sarcastic tone, ""Have a great lunch."" We were made to squeeze between the chairs of other customers to even be able to reach a table and those customers already seated as well.  We were finally seated at 1:50; the girl told us our waiter would be with us soon and she quickly left. We looked over the menu for awhile deciding what we wanted; we had decided on appetizers, pizza and we were going to get a few drinks. So we waited and waited; again I didn't understand what was going on because the waitress was outside helping other tables and taking drink orders and she never even acknowledged us to tell us she would be with us soon. Finally after 10 mins; at 2:00 we gave up and left. So much for that, I was extremely disappointed because I had really wanted the food and wanted to try a new beer. Needless to say I don't think I will come back to this BJs. Two-days in a row experiencing bad service doesn't seem like a coincidence. I don't think I can even call that bad service because it is more like no service. I ended up leaving on both occasions.  The restaurants I went to afterward were just as busy, acknowledged me once I entered the door, sat me within the quoted time and had a waiter at my table in a reasonable amount of time. I'm not going to go back to your BJs because I don't want to waste my time in a establishment where I'm not going to end up eating and I'm not going to go somewhere that has a manger that acts so rudely with customers. I'm definitely going to be telling others about this experience. No one else should waste their time through that, which is sad because other than service the establishment is good."
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,3.0,1/19/2012,"I came here on Sunday night after an event across the street at the Double Tree. I think it's nice that it's open late, there wasn't much of a wait around 10pm but when we came during the day to visit the mall, the wait looked horrible and parking wasn't very easy. Honestly? I'm over BJ's currently. I've went a few times recently to different locations and every time it's been underwhelming. The food is about the same but service has been bad. Maybe it's just me? I'm not sure anymore. There was really just one error this time. I'm not going to do a full review on this place, just highlight the ups and downs. -- G O O D -- -- No wait -- Food was decent -- Water glass kept full :) -- Pizookie is BOMB -- B A D -- -- Specifically asked for HOT fries with my chili cheese burger. They were COLD. So I had to ask for some new ones -_-"
Bri R.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,9,1.0,1/27/2012,"Where do I start? We called the day of to reserve a spot for 10 people for a friend's a party. We were told that we could only schedule reservation 45 minutes BEFORE the time! How crazy is that?  We called at 5pm and reserved our spot for 5:45pm. I got there at 5:30pm and was told it would be a short wait. Fine, that's okay, I was early anyway. At 6:45pm I WENT OFF! I let the receptionist and the servers hear it. 'They know how to make the reservation, but they don't know how to HOLD the reservation! The holding is the most important part!' (Jerry Seinfeld).  When we finally were seated (7:03pm) our server had the WORST attitude. She didn't even take our drink orders until 23 minutes later. We told her that the checks and orders needed to be separate (so everyone could pay for their own food) and she told us they didn't do that! That way the servers get better tips. When we finally received our ""food"" (8:19pm) almost all our orders were wrong! When we told her she smacked her lips and snatched the food from the tables. RIDICULOUS!!! I was pissed so I gave her an ear full when she came back.  A different server brought us the correct food and when I bit into it, it was like eating a sand burger from the desert... DRY, DRY, DRY! He brought us EMPTY ketchup and mustard bottles, yes, empty and took 7 minutes to bring us new ones. THEY NEVER REFILLED OUR DRINKS... NOT EVEN THE WATER. They food was NOT worth the wait or price at all.  They over charged us because they confused our table with the group next to us. Also, it was sooo cold and dark in that place. I understand setting the mood, but when you have customers everywhere WEARING COATS, GET THE HINT! I didn't take off my coat; I put my gloves on while waiting. It was so dark we used our cell phones as a source of light for ordering.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO BJS AGAIN... NEVER... GO SOMEWHERE ELSE... I HAVE HAD BETTER SERVICE AT MCDONALDS!"
Jeremy H.,"Sacramento, CA",89,125,54,2.0,1/26/2013,"2 Stars in Yelp reads ""Meh. I've experienced better"" and that pretty much sums it up. I feel like there are a ton of restaurants just like this one and we're all pretty used to them... sure there menu item differences, but I swear they all get their food from the same cheap vendor... whoever that is. Ordered a thin crust pizza, note the ""Thin"" in that description because apparently BJ's has no idea whatsoever that means... or maybe I don't. I always imagined thing meaning skinny or not thick. If I saw a person walking and said they looked incredibly thin you'd imagine my description there (skinny or not thick). BJ's thin crust pizza is thicker than most other regular pizzas I have ever eaten... and I'm an American which means I've eat an ungodly amount of pizza in a proportion that could probably feed a small village in some other countries. If you like thick pizza where most of what you get is doe then you'll love this place. So we did a custom pizza and one ingredient was white onions. I imagined that these would be chopped up or something. I mean, of course they didn't put an entire onion on the pizza, but there was only a few slices of onion and these things were like an entire leaf of union... probably there was about 3 of these leafs spread over the whole pizza and they were each about 3 inches by 3 inches. The salad was even more awful... or rather pathetic. It was like they knew it was bad so they just gave up trying and just threw some cheap green stuff they could find, threw it on a place, and sprayed it with some flavorless dressing. I would have given this place 1 star, but low and behold there was one good thing about this place that was worth an entire star. The beer. I only had one, it was some waste of money expensive special, but I had to have something to wash all their garbage down with, so I got it. Can't remember what it was, but it was dang good. If I was BJ's, and I'm not, nor will I ever name my child anything with that acronym in it, I would make the beer the main focus and food a side note. Though, maybe that's why I don't own any restaurants because that place is always packed even though I hated the food - so apparently a lot of people out there still love this junk."
Ami F.,"Roseville, CA",4,22,,4.0,9/5/2014,"Small restaurant but very good food.  The drinks are really strong, but the best pulled pork that i have had at any BJ's."
Carlos G.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,30,1,4.0,5/28/2012,"Never been here before and it didn't disappoint.  The restaurant is nice. Service was not bad, food was good and hanging here with friends was ideal. Over all, satisfied and will return.,"
Laura S.,"Sacramento, CA",64,25,5,2.0,10/16/2011,"I was excited to go here, as many ppl have said how much they like it, and this place is fairly new to the Arden Mall. I wanted to go to Elephant Bar, but my boyfriend convinced me we should go here instead. Saturday night, around 9, we get there and put our name on the list, them saying bout a 20 min wait. Many couples that got there after us were being seated, so we were like, what's the deal??? They kept saying like you're next, soon, blah blah. A little annoying... they finally, at 9:25 called my name with ""party of 4""....clearly we were a party of 2.....that's why that took so long. okay, no problem. it happens. our host wasn't too pleasant, she seemed annoyed at US, when we said we were only two people. I decided what I wanted quickly (Italian Market Salad) looked pretty good. My bf decided on pulled pork sandwich. Took a while for the waitress, also she was making me feel awkward, to come back with the waters we ordered and then again to come back for our orders, but it was pretty busy, so that's okay. Ordered our food. got excited, i was starving! took 25 min to get our food. im not sure if it seemed longer cause i was hella hungry, but it was a little bit of a wait.  and................ WHOMP WHOMP, my salad was so tiny!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If I order a 12 dollar salad, I expect not to be able to finish it. I cleared the plate in 7 minutes! Still hungry :/ also, too much dressing. drenched. but besides that, a pretty good salad, i liked that it had a lot of kalamata olives, usually ppl skimp on those. my bf's pulled pork pretty good. standard pulled pork. mashed potatoes yummy as well the crispy fries. left unsatisfied.  SUM UP: Lame salad portion slow service tasty food awkward staff"
Chad L.,"Carmichael, CA",12,17,60,2.0,12/14/2013,"Most recent visit was on a slammed night where we had at least 3 servers visit our table after waiting too long for the initial greet. I have been served consistently lukewarm pizza and have sent it back for a quick flash more than once. When we were served, the pizza came before the salad and we had to ask for utensils. Sent the Cobb Salad back.The service is always patient and agreeable, which makes it all the more disheartening that I am not sure how much more of their mediocre food I can handle. This place is a dressed up frat bar, and despite the slick  interiors and uniformed staff, it has become a so-so stop for overpriced mall food. I have had better dishes at Lyons, particularly in the salads and apps dept. The manager was quick and attentive and could have sealed the deal with a comp'ed Pazookie but I couldn't get out of there fast enough :/"
Ann S.,"Sacramento, CA",47,40,,1.0,7/31/2011,"I've read about this restaurant in China, I think it is, where everything is made out of ice.  The tables, the chairs, the bar.  You go in in your parka and sit there and eat on blocks of ice in a below freezing atmosphere.  People voluntarily go there, but what's in it for the restaurant?  Does shivering make everything taste good? Does it change your metabolism so you order more?  Perhaps customers want to get out so fast that they don't care what is put in front of them, and will pay anything on the bill? Maybe that's BJ's philosophy.  When I walked into the Arden Fair restaurant on a pleasant 90 degree evening last Wednesday, I felt like I was entering that Chinese ice cafe.  BJs was seriously over air-conditioned, and I'm talking freon gone wild.   I'm sorry I don't carry a portable thermometer with me, because I'll bet it wasn't more than 65 degrees.   I was so uncomfortable that I wrapped one of their cloth napkins around my shoulder and vowed from now on to keep a pashmina in the car, even during summer in Sacramento. The menu was as expected for this class of restaurant - a little bit of everything:  pasta, fish, burgers, ribs. Usually, when a restaurant has a lot of choices, they are good at nothing.  We went because I heard they had decent ribs and my 14 year old son loves ribs. You hear a lot of  things in this world that aren't true, don't you? The wait to be seated was short, but service was very slow, which is to be expected when the floors are iced down.  The restaurant looks nice, with few remnants of the California Cafe left.  But, it is a bit more handsomely appointed than necessary for what is essentially a family restaurant.   My kid ordered the ribs, and my husband and I both ordered a French Dip sandwich.  They asked me if I wanted ""skinny"" fries or steak fries.  Since I don't like fries much, I said skinny.  I would have switched to a salad but I'm neutropenic from chemo and am not supposed to have fresh veggies, and aside from that, they wanted to charge $3.00 extra. I'll stick with skinny fries, thanks.   After a long, long wait, long enough so that after 20 minutes, my husband still had time to walk all the way across the Arden Fair parking lot, behind Nordstrom and back to bring me my forgotten phone - they finally brought our meal.  Only, I got ""fat"" steak fries.  Which I really didn't want, so I asked to switch to what I'd ordered. By then I had a craving for skinny, salty, almost potato-less fries to dip in the au jus.  The server said they'd bring me some skinny ones right out, so I unloaded my fat ones on my husband and kid. The slab of ribs was unremarkable.  The sauce was boring.  It came with a baked potato, which my kid doesn't care for (good thing I got the wrong fries so he had mine) and only about a tablespoon of butter and sour cream mixed together in a tiny cup. Weird way to save money but I guess they have to pay for the air-conditioning somehow. He did get a salad with it which he liked  - it had hidden valley ranch dressing on it, he thought.  It looked like a bagged salad with croutons. My sandwich was ice cold, which was not unbelievable given the temperature of the restaurant and the long wait - if it had ever been warm enough, that is. The roast beef was your typical packaged roast beef and maybe had just been pulled out of the fridge and slammed on to bread and served with fat fries. Nobody ever brought me my skinny fries or checked on us.  Oddly enough, while this entire experience took an hour an a half, at the very end the busser picked up my plate WHILE I WAS STILL EATING.  Service was very very slow until they decided we were done. I didn't protest because it wasn't very good and the icey temperature had gotten to me. When she came to give us the bill, I complained that'd I'd not gotten half my meal and expected that to be taken off. The restaurant did one thing right - they took my entire meal off. My son had been eyeing the desserts, but the whole thing took so long and we were so cold that we skipped it. And, we'll skip them forever, since we won't be back. This is on par with Elephant Bar, Applebees, Chilis etc:  Chain restaurants with mediocre food.  Kids like these places because they have lots of choices and bland food, and adults seem to like them because they are predictable; you know what you are getting no matter what state you order it. So, if you like terrible service,  freezing temperatures and blah food, you'll adore BJs - in any part of the world."
Christine Q.,"Sacramento, CA",5,27,6,5.0,2/5/2012,"I absolutely love this place!  I've been here for dinner and lunch times. Their good is delicious. I have ordered, their pizza with my siblings, and cousin.  We had pizza, i believe it was the pig something. icant remember, but it was like a hawaiian pizza.  The crust, was not like a normal crust, it was nice and fluffy crust.  The cheese was right, as the pig was nice and had a good amount of sweet taste.  The pineapple had added the right amount is a slight tang that meld with the pig. That night we had a poozkie.  The poozkie we ordered was a normal size, that was vanilla ice cream.  Their vanilla ice cream was so GOOD!, the cookie was very sweet to my taste.  IT was GOOD!.  The second time that i went with my friends. I had ordered a fish and chips at this location for lunch.  Their fish i wished was more crispy and fully cooked.  The batter seemed as it wasn't fully cooked. I was happy that lemon was included in this dish, because it helped cut the oil taste.  The fries were good, but i had wished it was alittle bit more crispier.  The sauce for the fish, which was tarter sauce was good, it has a nice good tart/sour taste. BUT i can tell you that my 3 other friends enjoyed their own meals.  we had the appetizers and it was good, we had the sample platter that so we tired everything, i loved the dips, and umm.... it was an eggroll, but it wasnt the avocado ones. I can't really remember the name. The third time that i went was with my friends as well.  I had a hard time deciding what to order, but umm the server had help me decided on what was ordered on more.( this was at the location in arden mall) I ordered the chicken crusted parmasean with mashed potatoes.  It was the most crispy chicken ever!.  The chicken was amazingly good.  Their mashed potatoes were good, but i loved the chicken more. my friend loved their dishes and it was fabulous. I loved all these times, and it was really good. I loved to come back for food."
VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",60,624,11973,3.0,5/9/2012,"Ate here while in town and was surprised to see that their menu varied slightly from the one in my home town. I was craving Broccoli-Cheddar Soup but much to my disappointment, they only serve it Sun, Mon and Tue. They also didnt have the Onion Strings on the appetizer menu, as well as other choices. The food was good, although it was extremely loud and we had to repeat our order/requests several times to our waitress."
C K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/1/2015,I had absolutely wonderful customer service today at curbside from Ben!! He was nice and on top of everything! He is a great example of how people in the food/service industry should be! Thank you!
Christine D.,"Crockett, CA",116,304,132,3.0,4/12/2014,"Not bad for a chain restaurant bar establishment!  large menu selection food is average service is ok. Service can be a little slow when it busy, but I guess that's expected. Portions are big!"
Danny H.,"Memphis, TN",72,158,41,2.0,7/2/2011,"The food was good but the service was horrible. I went today for a late lunch around 3PM. It wasn't very busy at all and we were seated right away. It took about 7 to 10 minutes for us to even be greeted at our table. Of course by that time we were ready to order food. It took another 15 minutes for us to even get our drinks. We got our food about five minutes before our food arrived, which were the deep dish pizzas! I actually had to remind our server about our drinks as she was walking around laughing with co-workers! We then had to ask for refills many times and even for silverware to eat off of.  Our server was very inattentive. Makes me not want to return!"
Kitty T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,26,2,1.0,8/3/2013,"Recently visited with a friend and used a gift card. The bill totaled up to just a few dollars over the value of the gift card, so I slipped in a $20 since I needed to break it anyways. When the waitress returned with my change, I discovered that in fact, there was no change.. What!? She took all the cash and left some $19 on the gift card. When I asked her about it, she had a terrible attitude and made a big deal about it as if I was making a huge inconvenience. Why would I go in with a gift card and then want to give you cash so I could keep the most value possible on the gift card?!?! .. Then she took forever to (finally!) bring my change. I normally like BJs, but will not be returning to this location because of the rude service."
