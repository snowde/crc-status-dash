Gilly C.,"Sacramento, CA",24,12,1,5.0,8/16/2014,Yup! Our spot! Child friendly. Yummi pizza and hamburgers. Love the peanut butter pizuki. Wedge salad is very nice! We've never been disappointed with the food or the service.
Jenise H.,"Fair Oaks, CA",12,7,,4.0,1/20/2014,"I love Bj's a lot. Come here as often as possible and tonight I didn't have the greatest experience with one of the servers(he didn't introduce himself, my soup was cold, he basically threw my new reheated soup at me, didn't make eye contact) just not up to the usual Bj's standard I am accustom to. Thankfully, however, Amy the manager was very graceful and amazing with the way she handled the situation. I totally understand why she's the manager. Thank you so much, Amy. You were amazing"
Karl P.,"Sacramento, CA",1253,121,2,4.0,1/15/2012,"I don't always like chains, but this is a good one.  This particular BJ's has a smaller, nicer dining area than most. That makes it a great place for one-on-one discussions and a cozy date. All BJ's have a great menu with a wide variety of options. They have a good bar and, of course, their own brand of beers. Whether you're blonde, brunette, or redhead, you can order a beer named after your hair color. It doesn't get better than that!"
Kathy N.,"Sacramento, CA",105,114,31,3.0,10/17/2011,"Never been to BJ's prior to my first visit & honestly, i dont understand what the hypes all about cause it was alright.. They had the slowest service ever!! took maybe 20 to 30 minutes for our food to be ready, and it sucked cause we were hungry! It seemed like other people that came in after us got their food first -_-. We ordered fettucini, mac and cheese, a pizza, and this rice thingy( it looked like chinese food, idk what it was called)...they all tasted good, but NOT mouth watering good haha. Bill came out kinda expensive, and we were all full by then to try out their pizookie cookie.  IDK if i'll return, maybe..."
Sarah W.,"Columbus, OH",1,6,,5.0,8/4/2015,"Good establishment. If you are ever torn between here or TGIFriday, come here instead because you will actually get service!"
Heather C.,"Sacramento, CA",398,218,172,5.0,11/2/2011,"Wanna go shopping drunk?? DONT want to go shopping but your wife/girlfriend/sister/friend is begging you and you would rather get DRUNK? Need to get your oil changed and told you have to wait over an hour and have nothing to do.....well walk to BJ's ingeniously located in the Arden mall and get....DRUNK! =) BJ's is most definateley my favorite chain restaurant. They have a full bar, delicious beers, cheap and tasty appetizers, a huge variety of entrees and when you are a fan of BJ's on facebook you are always getting printable coupons.  Now the best part about THIS BJ's is that it is conveniently located close to my house which means happy hour is always around the corner, and if there ever comes a time when I have had one too many and cant drive just yet, I can burn the calories and the buzz off by shopping or people watching in the mall.  Its pretty much a win win here. But of course you could always just go to Bj's and have a good dinner..I do realize not everyone is as much of an alcoholic as I, Bj's is good for an old fashioned sober lunch/dinner as well."
Niki C.,"Hillsboro, OR",21,94,27,1.0,5/8/2011,"The food- was great. But every time I've tried to visit, at varying times of the day the service was HORRIFIC. Slow, orders were inaccurate, and drinks were difficult to order from the bar. I love Bj's and have never had such consistently bad experiences at another restaurant.  However after such slow and inaccurate service I won't be returning to the Arden Mall location."
Patrick M.,"Sacramento, CA",5,2,,5.0,2/26/2012,Cambria was the BEST Server EVER!!! She gets 50 Stars!!!!!
Lydia T.,"Elk Grove, CA",18,51,2,1.0,4/5/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here on a whim since we were hungry and didn't go to Maggiano's for some strange reason. There wasn't a wait and we sat down in one of the quieter areas. Our waitress was extremely friendly and kind to us but I forgot her name! My bf ordered the fish & chips and I ordered the top sirloin medium w/ white cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus. My bf said his dish was good but mine was far from it. The steak was cooked beyond well done and the waitress knew there was an issue even though she was standing on the other side of the room. She came over, asked if it was too well-done (I didn't even ask for it well done), apologized and took it back. The steak looked over cooked and shriveled. Manager Sean came & apologized and asked if I wanted a soup or salad to enjoy while I waited. I got a salad which was nice. The new steak took like 15 minutes to come out even after like 5 different servers came over and said it was on it's way & it was a top priority........ THE SECOND STEAK WAS STILL WELL DONE. Of course it would be well done if I waited 15 minutes for it. You had TWO chances to make a medium steak and failed so hard. What. The. Heck. My asparagus was sticking half off the plate because they brought my new meal on some dinky little plate. The asparagus was wayyy too salty and old. I tried to cut the old parts off but every time I did the top portion would fall off the plate. What a waste. The steak was tough and well done but I ate it. It was so tiny, maybe 6 oz? At that point I was so hungry and fed up that I lied to our waitress and said everything was fine when she came over. The only good part about my dish was the mashed potatoes. For $14 I could've gotten a nicer, bigger, and perfectly cooked steak from Texas Roadhouse. The waitress offered us a free pizookie to make up for the first mistake which was very kind of her. There was also a guy cleaning up the cups from tables and was clearly trying to carry too much on his tray because he ended up spilling it on himself and near another occupied table. He dropped the F-bomb and he wasn't very quiet about it. Kinda unprofessional. What a disappointing and unsatisfying experience at BJ's... I do have to say thank you to our waitress and the manager for treating us well. We left a 20% tip despite the issues and hope that it goes straight to our waitress."
Ryan F.,"West Sacramento, CA",106,222,19,3.0,10/30/2011,"Eh, you know it's not bad.  Great prices for lunch, you can get a mini pan pizza and a soup or salad for under $10.00. The pizza here is the primary draw.  I've never much cared for any of the rest of their food.  They have their own version of deep dish pizza which has a very thick and delicious crust and is served to you in a deep skillet. The best dessert is also served in a skillet, the ""pazookie"" which is basically just an enormous fresh-baked cookie served in a skillet with a scoop of ice cream.   In the world of chain dining in the Arden area I'd rank it after the Cheesecake Factory or Taro's but before your other options."
Nancy D.,"Sacramento, CA",26,15,7,4.0,4/18/2014,GreAt place for food and drinks . Their deserts are awesome . Especially the pizookies with ice cream
Shelley H.,"Tujunga, CA",65,40,23,5.0,4/3/2015,"So far it's ben about 4 mins the actress was busy but nice.  I guess that happens when the hostess tells you that the bar is open. Ordered a soda came right up. Checked back in on me like a min or two later. I decided to get the chicken buffalo pizza. It was spicier than usual due to more of hot sauce on top. However I love hot sauce so it didn't bother me. Then I ordered a mini pizookie (not sure on the spelling) anyway a runner gave me the food and it was a regular size, it was a mistake, and after talking to the server they gave it to me but charged the mini size. All through my waitress was super attentive. When I got the bill I noticed that she did charge right but what was awesome was that she save me money instead of paying $10.00 for a mini buffalo pizza she charged a build your own pizza with unlimited toppings which was $6.00. So instead I gave her a really nice tip overall this is one of the better bj's. If I have the chance to go to sacramento again. I will most likely be stopping by."
Ricky N.,"Sacramento, CA",480,355,92,4.0,5/27/2011,"Definitely on another level than other BJ's I've been to (for example Natomas and Elk Grove) The interior is just off the freakin charts!!! Reminds me of a Las Vegas fine dining restaurant. I couldn't stop gazing at the ceiling for some reason haha The food menu is pretty much the same as the others in the chain... but the drink menu is EXTENDED!!! They have over 50 beers on tap and some specialty drinks too. We tried the Lindelman Frambois which was super fruity and sweet, a good drink for girls. Haha not for guys, reminded me of berry cider but with more of a pomegranate juice taste."
Zak F.,"Carmichael, CA",85,29,1,3.0,12/22/2011,"Average family dining, in sub par mall.  Staff is hit and miss. This latest time service was pretty poor. Avocado eggrolls are the saving grace of bj's. Other than that its meh.  Beer selection is on point as it should be for a ""brewhouse"". Bottom line: Make the best outta the worst, grab a beer before the mall experience."
Chris C.,"Sacramento, CA",25,4,2,1.0,12/6/2014,"1st off let me say that I am a big fan of bjs. However, our first experience at this arden location we expirenced not only bad, but escalated into horrible customer service not only from our waitress (Devanie) but from the manager(Al) as well. To start, the waitress forgot my friend's drink, forgot my bread bowl after all the food came out and we had to ask where it it was after our friends were halfway done eating their main entrees. Also didn't refill our waters, had to ask even though all the empty glasses were at the end of the table after she passed countless times. & on top of speaking to the Manager, the manager told us he wanted us to tell us what should happen. I work in customer service and my friend is a manager, the manager could've been truthful and at least asked what can WE do to make it better not say it's up to you what you want to happen. Not even at least offer a bread bowl and apologize for this experience. The way he spoke made us feel as if we were trying to get something free when all we got from him was a half apology/explanation with a full priced bill until we seriously asked for an accomodation. Also waitress came back with our bill and did not apologize at all. Worst experience ever, point blank. Definitely sticking to the BJ'S in EG. 0 stars !!!!!"
Lindsay B.,"Sacramento, CA",119,128,2,4.0,3/18/2011,"Even though I don't usually make a point to review chain restaurants, I thought I should review the new BJs opening at Arden Fair Mall. I had the chance to dine there last night (for free, by invitation) while the restaurant did a week of ""practice"" so the staff could get everything ready for the grand opening. BJs is alright in my book to begin with, but give it to me for free and I'll for sure be there! The location (where California Cafe used to be) is better suited for a BJs than for a more upscale/pricey place, so I think business will do well here. It looks like any other BJs you've probably seen...big, nice, typical etc. There is an interior wall with windows shared by the mall that looks into a walkway by Juicy Couture, so you can people watch as you dine if that suits you! (Keep in mind that the mall patrons can see you as well, so be subtle with your staring). The food and beer was the usual BJs fare and the service was friendly but noticeably new and a bit unsure of the flow of things. I'm sure the kinks will all get worked out in due time and I think this is a good addition to the Arden plaza."
Angela G.,"Hercules, CA",36,68,81,5.0,3/8/2012,Came here last night for the first time (at this location) with my boyfriend for happy hour. Our server was SO nice! I totally forgot what her name was but she was so sweet and kept checking up on us making sure everything was okay. My boyfriend ordered their beer sampler which was definitely worth $12 or however much it was. We actually ordered buffalo wings that our server forgot about so she talked to her manager and they actually took it off our bill and didn't charge us! I wrote a bad review for the BJ's in Concord because they have bad customer service so next time I'm in Sac and craving a Beignet and Mojito I will def be coming back to this BJ's!
Charlene M.,"Sacramento, CA",80,10,,3.0,3/30/2011,"I was really excited about this restaurant opening at the mall, since it would give anothe option for me and my friends to go to for dinner and bj's food tastes incredible for a chain restaurant. My mom and I opted to sit in the bar because there was a long wait.  Their bar is a good size and is open seating so that's convenient. My mom had the BBQ pulled pork sandwhich (yummy) and I had the fettucini alfredo (it was ok). My fav part was the rootbeer! I like how they serve it in a chilled glass and I would definitely come back for the rootbeer alone. The service was decent, it kinda sucked how the server asked us while we were not even halfway through with our food and clearly still eating ( like my fork was still in my hand) if we needed boxes and dropped off our check.  Let's face it, when servers do that, it makes the diners feel rushed. The main reason this place only got 3 stars from me is because of their air vents.  It was FREEZING in the restaurant but I could manage with me coat on. What sucked was the air vents directly above our table that blew hard wind at my food that my pasta was instantly cold. I would have asked to be seated elsewhere but there were air vents everywhere! All in all, the place was decent and I will probably go back...with my winter coat of course."
Ricky K.,"Sacramento, CA",24,37,,3.0,7/10/2011,"This is my first time coming here to Bj's, and i gotta say that its ok to me. I wasn't that bad but the service took a while to come. I ordered the Grilled chicken pasta. the pasta was cheesy and the grilled chicken was perfectly cooked.  This place reminds me of the cheesecake factory lol."
Marie L.,"Carmichael, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/9/2014,Wow this place is delicious! I've never had such a great burger! I've eaten at the one in Roseville and it doesn't compare! Great food and very friendly!
