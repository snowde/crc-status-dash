Brad L.,"Vallejo, CA",58,118,4,3.0,3/14/2012,BJ's is one of the few chains that I think has somewhat decent food.  They are very popular so there is almost always a wait.  Their pizzas are decent and everyone always loves their desserts.  It is amazing how many types of pizza cookies they have come up with. Their beer is drinkable.  Nothing special and I do not think it will any awards anytime soon.  I am not a huge fan at drinking at BJ's in general.  Their mixed drinks are tasty but weak and expensive.  As I said before the beer is nothing special.  This is a place to go with your family for lunch but not with your friends when you want a night out.
Lily F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",45,70,62,4.0,3/1/2012,"I've been here a few times and I've always been satisfied with the food and service (3 stars).  The last time I was at BJ's  we stopped by for drinks and I must say that the bartender was awesome (Shout out to PAUL!). He was the only guy behind the bar and he did a great job helping everyone sitting at the bar and the drinks he made were awesome. So, with all that being said I'm bumping up my review to 4 STARS."
Frank C.,"Sacramento, CA",7,26,,1.0,5/2/2013,"I dreaded even coming back to this establishment after the first encounter of having a terrible pizza with lack of toppings or none and then the full drink tray spilled on our table and that ran all over my shoes and they only thing the waitress cared about was the next table to make sure they did not have anything on them. And having a bus boy spend half of our meal wiping up the table and booth and floor while we TRIED to eat, and at no point did he say a word. Oh but my g/f spoke with a manager and showed them what type of pizza we have had and had to gaul to ask if we was just eating the toppings off the pizza.. But I was outside because I was really trying not to lose my cool. But she got a whoopie $25 gift card after a 50+ bill. So anyways after the previous experience my g/f said Of we should go there and try the Burgers. I was going oh great have to wear my rain boats if going back there again(lol). So on to ordering She wanted a burger (called Black and Bleu) I ordered the Calzone in which tasted like a dry hot pocket made in a microwave. My g/f burger smelled burnt from the time it was on the table. My mistake is i didnt ask her how was it but after her lathering it in ketchup i knew something was wrong. She said it was dry and no BLEU cheese on it and one little tomato paper thin I might add. I asked how was it ordered and she said said med-well. WELL it was WELL done alright and it took me awhile to get the chard taste out of my mouth for the one bite I had of the burger. I asked the waitress that was changed mid way of us eating I asked  what was written on the original order for the burger because this is way over done and she said ""sorry""walked away and then 8 mins later said it was med-well and asked her to look at it and does this look med-well to you? She replied no not really well DUH. So we just laid the gift card for the check that took forever to come and well the gift card is 25 and this 5 should cover the rest  of it and I am not waiting for change and walked away with another bad taste in my mouth in more ways then one. Final Conclusion- How in the hell does have any customer retention here? Beer, drinks Or just a place to hang out and meet up at? I have no no idea but if your looking for a decent meal  the food court upstairs is better then this place."
Amy Q.,"Reno, NV",710,205,116,3.0,12/22/2011,"BJ's Favorite Pizza with a side of Ranch and thats all I could really eat here. I wish service was a bit more on point, but the servers tend to always switch halfway between my meals every time I go here. The food is served slightly warm to cold and when I pay extra for a wedge salad, the iceberg wasn't dry completely and had a pool of water mixed with my bleu cheese, it wasn't good. I like this location a lot, its modernized but cramped. I feel like I can hear everyone's conversations at once and the servers tend to not check up on the table."
Anne L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,7,,1.0,8/29/2014,"Last night I had dinner at this BJ's. I will not be back. Period. The service is lackluster, the food is mediocre, and the bar drinks are pitiful. I am not a big drinker, but when I do indulge I expect a full ~ yep full glass of whatever I'm drinking. I typically order a Lemon Drop, after my last experience at BJ's (several months ago) I don't really know why I tried again, but I did. Ugh. The Lemon drop was served 3/4 full and warm ~ yuck! Drinks are not cheap you know, is it too much to ask for a FULL glass?!? I'm done with this BJ's. I'll be having my meals at Season's 52, which is a lovely restaurant, that serves ice cold and perfect cocktails; not to mention how wonderful their appetizers and desserts are. BJ's manager(s) your restaurant is right next door to Season's 52, that restaurant was packed last evening, perhaps you should think on this a bit. Analyze why you had to ""close down 1/2 your restaurant because you were so slow"", (direct quote from host you seated us) when the restaurant right next door to you was booming. Wish I had been there."
Ernest John E.C. C.,"Torrance, CA",144,26,,5.0,3/24/2014,"The Food And Service is AWESOME!!! Rebecca is EXCELLENT!!! I Wish I can give her more than 5 stars. I would give her a MILLION STARS!!! The Service is Good and Rebecca is VERY NICE!!! I Love The Deep Dish Pizzas, The Handcrafted Root Beer, and The Pizzookie!!! It was Exquisite!!! I will return to This BJ's Soon. I will be there for MY LATE 39TH AND EASTER BASH ON EASTER EVE Saturday, April 19, 2014 @ 7:35pm with My Family and Classmates From Hogan High School!!! Hope to see you guys then!!! :)"
Alana K.,"Marina, CA",45,26,3,5.0,2/26/2014,We've gone to plenty of Bj's but I must say this is the greatest location we've ever been to! We ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps and weren't huge fans of it so we let our server know and the manager Al came over to ask why we didn't like them. He said he'd gladly take it off the bill. Awesome customer service! Never have I been to a restaurant where the manager politely introduced himself to ask us out feedback! Next time I'm in town I will be back!!
Robert P.,"Roseville, CA",122,49,13,4.0,6/19/2013,Just visited for the first time to this location and it was just as great as my previous experiences with other locations. Delicious food and the pazookies are amazing.
noc f.,"Sacramento, CA",258,206,854,4.0,5/14/2011,"Choices Choices Choices....I like choices!!! They have a lot of selection- Have ya seen their menu?!!??!! I like this place eventhough it gets  too loud sometimes...hehehehe Not crazy about the new Red Velvet Pizzookie though. Waaay too sweet for my sweet tooth. Other than that, It's a great place to go to after work and chill."
Dave G.,"Capitola, CA",29,52,,2.0,7/20/2011,"For a restaurant in the Arden Fair Mall, I suppose it's not all that bad.  I wanted to visit because I had read some reviews on Chicago Fire's page saying that BJs deep dish pizza was so much better.  Well, I'm certainly not an authority on deep dish pies, but I know what I like, and BJs work really pales in comparison to other deep dish pizzas in town. We've been twice so far, the service was absolutely lousy the first time (lunch rush) and I felt the food was overpriced for what we received.  The second time we came for dinner and while the service was much improved, I still left disappointed in the meal. They do have great beer, and it's a nice place to throw one back with a buddy and watch the highlights, but I probably won't be back anytime soon."
Matty K.,"Sacramento, CA",150,383,10,3.0,11/18/2011,"We came here on the opening night of a movie and decided to have a drink and a dessert while we waited.  I walked into a restaurant and stood at the empty hostess stand.  Within a minute or so the hostess greets me and tells me about the late night happy hour, and that the bar area has full service and open seating. This is the part where our experience went from 5 stars to three.  I stood at the bar area looking for a seat.  The only two booths open were dirty, so I waited there for someone to bus it.  5 minutes later of standing there awkwardly with servers walking by completely avoiding eye contact with me and ignoring me I finally chose a table all the way in the back.  10 minutes later my server greets me.  I'm sorry, but I saw her walk by at least 5 times while I sat there, couldn't she had just paused for 2 seconds and say ""I'll be right with you?""  It also wasn't that busy. The service was friendly and good, the drinks were delicious and the strawberry baked beignet was sooo good!  I felt bad being irritated at the beginning because she was actually very nice.  A beignet coated with cinnamon sugar topped with vanilla ice cream with strawberry sauce over it and covered in whipped cream.  My pancreas was sent into overdrive after that little concoction.   Overall:  Good service, tasty food, yummy drinks.  But it would be nice if anyone just told me they would be right with me."
PK A.,"River Park, Sacramento, CA",0,9,1,1.0,8/14/2013,"My husband ordered the bleu cheeseburger. I took one bite and was horrified to find a hard piece of bone. I understand that this was due to the butchering of the meat. However, when we told out server, she simply said, ""Thanks."" We then asked to speak to a manager, waited 10 minutes and they never showed. The lack of respect at this establishment for the customer disgusted me. We will never be going back. If you have crowns or fillings, please BEWARE!"
W. N.,"Orange County, CA",34,283,4,4.0,11/16/2013,"I can ALWAYS rely on BJ's whether I am in San DIego, Huntington Beach or Sacramento.  Great happy hour, seasonl beers and oh yes!  That pizza.  OLd reliable no matter where I go!"
Andrew P.,"Sacramento, CA",91,20,4,4.0,1/4/2014,"I ordered the new bj burger and wow, the meat was soo juicy, I wished I had more. The thin cut fries are also delicious. Although the service is sometimes slow, the food always makes it up. Will come here again whenever any special occasions come up."
David S.,"Sacramento, CA",24,12,,3.0,3/27/2015,"The craft beers - not bad but not great.  A little too chain-restaurant tasting.  The food isn't bad; my burger was cooked to order and fairly tasty.  The dessert was excellent - the pizookie dessert is to die for!  Atmosphere - meh.  It's really loud and busy, and impossible to talk to your date.  Overall I give it 3 stars."
Alice Z.,"San Francisco, CA",215,254,52,3.0,11/29/2011,"My second time at BJs. I've went to Elephant Bar and Gordon Biersch before so I thought they were very similar. I couldn't make up my mind between pasta or burger. It was a very difficult decision to make lol. My boyfriend just came from the mall and we wanted to grab a fancy type lunch. He wanted pasta; so I told him to get the Cajun pasta since i know he likes spicy! I finally settled on the California burger on a whole wheat bun and wedge fries with ranch. The burger was tasty, nothing special though. My boyfriend didn't like his pasta because he wanted the ""white sauce"" meaning alfredo sauce. The cajun pasta wasn't even spicy!! i thought it was going to be spicy! Disappointed. We had to get the pazookie pizookie however you spell it! My bf never had it so I had to pop his cherry lol. We decided on the red velvet! I never had to so I thought it would be yummy and i was correct! We devoured it in under 10mins it was soooo good!!! That was probably the best part of our entire meal! And the bill came out to be $36. I thought it was pricey, maybe because my dumbass bf just had to get a $5 beer...oh well. Next time we're coming to happy hour!"
Dale W.,"Stockton, CA",41,71,4,4.0,11/21/2013,"It was great to grab my own table at the bar, bypassing the line for tables otherwise, sample a couple beers, and order quickly. Good experience and service."
A B.,"Carmichael, CA",5,81,32,4.0,3/24/2012,"I generally have good food and service at BJ's. Today was my first visit to this location.  It was 2 for lunch and we were seated immediately.  Our service was very good and we were checked on frequently.  We had the fried artichoke hearts first, which were fantastic, and under $4.  We each had a sandwich - I had the turkey cobb.  Love it.  Very good.   Did not get the pazookie this time but it's to die for."
Laszlo M.,"Sacramento, CA",91,32,74,3.0,12/4/2013,Your standard chain. fair quality. nice menu. Good drinks. needs work on listening to customers instead of ushering them into the bar area. Long wait for table but it was a busy night!
J L.,"Sacramento, CA",62,62,28,2.0,9/20/2012,"I never like coming here. My husband their ribs and pizza. I order a chicken lettuce wrap..boy, I tell that dish was the most salty dish I EVER had in my life. Nothing is good here everybody here looks stuck up. If ya don't like your job then quit. We are your boss we paid your bills."
