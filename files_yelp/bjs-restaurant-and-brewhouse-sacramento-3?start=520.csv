Anna K.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,12,5.0,5/2/2013,"I've had BJ's more than 5 times now, and I will definitely go there again. Love it everytime!!"
Martino P.,"San Francisco, CA",40,10,,3.0,2/18/2015,"Very nice and professional staff, and the service is good. The food is decent. It's not bad by any means. The one issue I have here is the portions are irritatingly small, to the point where I won't be back. I'm sorry but for a place that serves more of an average Joe/blue collar clientele, I like a decent portion size. I find it irritating when a place like BJs tries to market itself as a high end place with minute portion sizes. This isn't a four star restaurant...it is on the same level as a Hard Rock Cafe, so let's up the portion size please."
Mike D.,"Sacramento, CA",102,172,71,5.0,5/25/2011,"Yeayer!!! Go on game night. And get the roast beef. The party will commence in your mouth. **Yelpers be forewarned: Wear sweats or be ready to unbuckle because the food is soooo good and the portions so big, you'll need the extra room!**"
Kelsey M.,"Portland, OR",3,20,,2.0,9/24/2012,"Wellllllll, this was my first BJs experience. Went with roommates to celebrate a 21st birthday. Overall unimpressed with all aspects of this restaurant. I wouldn't call it bad...but more so ""mediocre."" Overpriced entrees, overpriced drinks, un-enthused server (who never offered us condiments for our french fries!). I would gladly pay $10 each for a drink and burger if they were high quality, but they were far from. Burger tasted bland and drink was just the typical pre-made juice and booze. I would maybe go again if I'm not paying for it. However, can't see myself ever deciding to go here on my own will."
Jennifer H.,"Sacramento, CA",12,1,,2.0,2/16/2014,Had to wait for our food for 35 minutes and then it came out wrong. We asked to speak to the manager and after 10 minutes he came to talk to us and offered other food but at this point were past waiting for anything else. He comped our food and was really nice. Sorry that the kitchen was off their game.
Rachel E.,"Fair Oaks, CA",96,49,28,1.0,9/11/2013,"Wonder why we coming back. The ONLY good part about this place is beer and the bartenders. Other than that. Food is mediocre, certain hostess staff is rude, service can be good or bad and if you read one of my tips you will understand the rest. For now."
Nelle A.,"Sacramento, CA",23,39,20,1.0,4/5/2013,Bad service at this location. Took 25 minutes to take my order on a  not so busy night (Wednesday)
Shawn B.,"Antelope, CA",20,203,38,3.0,10/5/2011,"The food is good, the staff was decent. They tried to fit a whole lot restaurant into a little space so it was a bit crowded. Over all, not bad."
Christina D.,"Citrus Heights, CA",6,80,,2.0,1/12/2014,The server was slow and he messed up more than one item in order. He did not care about how he inconvenienced us. The Manager took care of issues and gave us a new server but the mood/ experience was ruined. We were later to an event we were attending afterwards because of how much time we spent waiting to order and get our order corrected.
Lauren M.,"Washington, UT",92,33,4,2.0,3/21/2013,Food is ok. Very poor customer service.
Eirika H.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,247,26,4.0,7/13/2011,"YUM. Love the spinach mushroom appetizer, the caesar salad, their crispy friend chicken, and their pazookie! (and just about everything I've tasted on the menu was delicious) The service is pretty great, and the atmosphere is classy and quiet. Parking is decent to find (except on the weekends) and it's definitely a great way to relax after an intense session of shopping! The price rivals that of the cheesecake factory (which I like more) but this place is a great place to come when the wait for the cheesecake factory is 0.5-1.5hrs!"
Connie B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2014,"We go out for lunch every day and BJ's has to be the worst one we have been to.  I placed an order to go and was told 15 minutes.  When I arrived, I was told an additional 10 minutes.  It wasn't even started yet.  It took 40 minutes to get a to go order.  And the excuse they always give is that they're busy...have you looked around?  It's never that busy and for a place that calls itself a lunch and dinner place, they don't know what they're doing.  They never, never try to make it good, the manager just stares at you and apologizes.  Never, never will I go there again. Minimum wage should not mean minimum service, they are just dreadful.  And when is being busy a bad thing?"
Tiffany K.,"Sacramento, CA",1,22,11,1.0,11/16/2012,"I feel bad for giving such a normally good place a bad review but I want this to be seen.  I had my boyfriend and his good friend visiting California (1 from TN one from GA) both captains in the army.  We went to BJ's on Veterans day.  I was waiting to see if the waiter would say anything at all about anything special for Veterans days and he he didn't.  I decided to go up and sneak out to talk to the ladies near the entry way and they were like oh yes we offer a special on meals and rattled of their specials.  I said oh, I am sorry we already placed our orders and our waiter didn't even say anything about that so we didn't even know going into placing them.  So I asked if they could do something special for them like bring them a small pizookie and the girl was very nice and said oh of course! At the end of the meal, our waiter said do you two want dessert?  Pizookies? They are free??? The guys looked shocked, free? Ok that would be great!   The waiter walked away and again they were wondering why they were free? I had to explain because our waiter was an idiot obviously and said oh it's to say thank you for your service! Sorry to be so harsh. But how hard is it to say, gosh thank you two so much for serving our country after you specifically know that these are two men in the army. They sacrifice their lives for us and the dude couldn't even say a measly few words. Not saying they had to offer anything and to be honest I wasn't sure if they would be doing anything but just thought it would be nice to find out.  But in finding out our waiter didn't even bring that up when they had the opportunity is was what really got me.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr­rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  HAVE RESPECT FOR THOSE THAT HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY. IT TAKES TWO SECONDS TO SAY THANK YOU.  And I finally got that off my chest. Thank you YELP! :)"
Milena C.,"Hillsboro, OR",3,101,7,3.0,6/25/2011,"Came here originally because of a cousin's wife's bday. Pizza was sublime (Sweet Pig) as well as the beer (Jeremiah Red). Man, Jeremiah Red is so damn good, I've been back a few times purely for that beer. Beer that gives a buzz but isn't god awful. What! It exists! Been back a few times. Service has sucked once or twice, but has been better overall. Salad/Flatbread Pizza combo is awesome and the drinks are strong. Something about this place prevents me from being too much of a regular, but still an enjoyable treat."
Michelle H.,"Tucson, AZ",155,30,,2.0,10/21/2012,"In terms of food, a BJ's is a BJ's is a BJ's. In terms of food quality, BJ's gives at least a solid three stars. What makes or breaks a chain such as BJ's is the experience you get at the location. And for me, my experience was none too pleasing. Hostess - keep doin' what you're doin'. Welcoming smile, pretty face - I'm sure it brings people through the door just fine. Server - You need to work on.... just about everything. I was in the area for an interview close by and decided to stop by Arden Fair afterwards for the hell of it. Luckily, my boyfriend and I came in at around Happy Hour. We've never done Happy Hour at BJ's before, but HH anywhere means pretty sweet deals. We asked for one small specialty pizza and asked if we could get an order of a mini-Pizookie. We didn't order any drinks aside from water; quite frankly, we knew ordering that was more than enough to make us full. 1. Server got our order wrong. We were given 2 pizzas instead. We shrugged it off and let it slide. It's fine. Still enough of a calorie bomb to ward off hunger on our stomachs. Bonus for us was that at least the pizzas were on HH prices. 2. Nearing the end of our meal, our server was never to be found. After even flagging down other servers, they were later nowhere to be found. When our server or another server did come by, there was no genuine feeling of service to be found in their expressions. YES, YES, I GET IT. WE DIDN'T PIG OUT AND DISH OUT MAJOR CASH. But A) HELLOOOOO, IT'S HAPPY HOUR!, and B) Don't you want to provide good service to make us WANT to come back and order more the next time? Paying with the server was a pain in the ass. Simply asking for the bill took about 10 minutes. Once the bill came, we slid a credit card in within seconds and had to wait another 10-15 minutes just to have them pick it up. How long did it take us to get our credit card back? Another 10 minutes. I understand if we weren't ideal customers in terms of getting much money from us, but besides the quantity of what we'd ordered, we never acted out or did anything outlandish throughout our meal. We were polite and gave respect to every employee, despite the worsening ""respect"" we got in return from the workers.  To spend 30 minutes of our time just to go through the paying process is not what I call good service. And for the record, the place was pretty EMPTY. It was around 3-4 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.  It's been months since this incident, and I never returned to this BJ's since, nor will I ever return again. From now on, one should be asking, ""How would you rank your service this evening, on a scale of BJ's - 10?"""
Kimberly O.,"Carmichael, CA",3,37,145,5.0,8/9/2013,Went with my mother and ordered the black and blue burger. OMG it is delish.  The potato wedges were fresh and wonderful.  I will go back for sure. MMMMM
Christine B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,24,,4.0,4/6/2011,"Service so good, I had to Yelp about it!  Well, not quite but lemme splain........ I am not a big weekday lunch eater but today I was SUPER hungry.  I really like BJ's BBQ Chicken Salad and remembered they do a smaller lunch portion so I was totally AT THAT!!!   I came in around 1:30pm and was quickly seated- that's ALWAYS a plus.  Ordered my salad and a yummy beverage that I won't mention since it is a work day ;-) 15 minutes later I get my water!!!!! WTH??  I did not complain but I did ask my waitress for the check about 5 minutes later when my drink finally showed up.  She apologized for the delay in the drink arrival and I explained that the drink wasn't such a big deal (I could gulp that down) but what was up with the salad??  IT'S A SALAD!!!!!  No cooking involved.  Within moments the manager was at my table.  I didn't ask for a manager.  I didn't even complain.  He told me that my first drink was not mixed to his standards and that he had them re-do it.  He then apologized and told me that my salad would be taken care of.   Free salad and a yummy manager approved drink- I will be retuning for sure!  Hopefully the ""newness"" doesn't go away too quickly.   Whew! That was my longest Yelp yet! =)"
Nhu-Quynh N.,"Sacramento, CA",358,297,65,3.0,8/26/2012,"Every time I come here, I always get my meals replaced because something was wrong. Medium rare that comes out cooked. Or Jambalaya that is over peppered. If I had to say the only thing I'd give props for is the fact that the service is excellent. They always compliment the meal if they had something wrong and had to replace. But their chef's seriously need to get a reality check on how to properly cook something and not just base it on what they feel like it should taste like. Cause if that was the case they shouldn't ask how I like the meat on my burger. I'm just saying."
Lindsey C.,"Sacramento, CA",248,67,6,3.0,8/16/2013,I love the food at BJ's but this location took us 3 hours to get in and out of. Horrible turn over rate. The food was the saving grace though. I just won't be returning to this location.
Hannah Z.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/1/2013,"Barely rates one star. Basically a Denny's with beer. The food is bland (white lettuce salad) and pre-made. The service was good (thus, the star).  Save your money and go to a locally owned brew pub."
