Christina K.,"Tomball, TX",17,27,30,2.0,8/20/2013,"Alright, so I've been to this BJ's a few times and have always been a fan, love the one in Houston, TX and went to the one in Natomas, always good food and service. BUT, tonight, we went to BJ's it's a Weds night and the restaurant wasn't super busy... waited 20 mins for a table for 3... wondering why there was a wait since we could see open tables, plus 3 groups of 2 were seated before us. Matthew was our waiter, he wasn't a very good waiter at that either, which reflected in his tip. I'm pretty sure that atleast 2 people sitting around us sent their fo"
Pam H.,"Redwood City, CA",227,162,63,4.0,7/17/2011,"We are hear in Sacramento for the weekend and needed a place for dinner tonight- we wanted something close to the dance venue that we were planning on going to and BJ's seemed to be about 5 minutes away.   We found parking pretty quickly, it is located in a mall, so lots of shared parking.  We were greeted by the hostess, she was very friendly and told us we'd have a 5 minute wait for our table.  That was pretty accurate and we were then seated.   Our waitress was friendly and greeted us right away, our glasses of water came pretty quickly, the cocktails took a bit longer.  We placed our food order and it came pretty quickly- but she only came by once after that to check in on us.  We could have used another check-in so that my husband could order a refill on his drink.   We did eventually get the drink ordered after asking the hostess to send our server over. Food was good..i had the Bacon Cheeseburger and my husband has the Talapia off the ""enlightened menu""- both were very good.  We didn't bother with appetizers or desserts. Overall, I am a fan of BJ's- our service was a little lacking at this one, but it wouldn't keep me from coming back or trying another location."
Lyndsy B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/22/2014,"Food is decent, beer is decent. Good selection of beer. The biggest drawback is that it is ALWAYS crowded."
Brandy H.,"Carmichael, CA",53,309,34,4.0,6/4/2011,"I love BJ's.  They have an amazing selection of beer.  I have not come across any food I have not liked.  At our table all the food was great; California cheeseburger, turkey burger, pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos, chicken pesto flat bread, and Cajun pasta.  Every one loved there food.  The best part was the pazookies.  We got the trio with chocolate chip cookie and vanilla bean ice cream, cookies and cream, and triple chocolate.   The only complaint.  They service was horribly slow.  It took forever to get our food.  I have only experienced that at this location."
maria g.,"Davis, CA",30,97,10,3.0,4/4/2011,"Went here with my friend for her birthday.  The size of the place is okay, but I don't think there is too much room between the aisles. I've been to other BJ's restaurants with better layouts.  The food was standard, and nothing special. The pizookie, on the other hand, was godly. OMG *homer simpson drool*. I'm so happy to learn that they introduced a mini trio of pizookies to share. The minis are perfectly sized. I always seem to get crazy sick after eating the larger ones lol.  The wait was pretty long. Maybe it's due to it being relatively new."
Johnathen D.,"Davis, CA",249,16,,3.0,6/28/2011,"Ok, so I went with some work people the other day and I was feeling like soup so I got the chili (which was a bit of a let down, but good. I just didn't expect what I got). The best part was the potato topped with chicken and other acoutrements. Awesome. Epic. It was massive and delicious and, because my tiny bird belly couldn't finish it and I had to take a doggy bag, it was still awesome like a week later out of my microwave. Totally a fan. All I'm gonna want from here for a while is giant, yummy, potatoes and beers. Count me in. Update: Went today (7/20/11), and the food was awesome of course. I had the exact same meal. Loved it. Only problem I had was the waiter was kind of rude. A man. I was there with 8 women. They all got their water's filled twice before I got me tea filled once. Rude. My friend tried to explain that it was just easier to serve water, and that sometimes they wait till you're almost done to serve tea so it's not wasted, but I don't buy it. lol. I think I was being ignored in favor of all the lovely ladies. I'm not too mad, cause I get the logic, I just love my damn tea. The waitress I had on my first visit wasn't like that with me. Holla."
nate j.,"Sacramento, CA",30,51,,4.0,4/22/2011,"real talk... I've worked for this company before... i was a trainer a Finished Beer Specialist (yes that's a job) this location has to be small on Bj's standards, but the bar and cocktail staff are great and I will go back."
Carizma D.,"Sacramento, CA",13,90,3,4.0,4/11/2013,Had a blast this past Sunday with my roommate at BJ's. We went right before 10pm. (Happy Hour starts @10pm)  We had mini pizzas (I had buffalo chicken & she had BBQ Chicken) Both were satisfying. The service was good. Shout out to Robert in the bar area for being very accommodating.
Jason C.,"Carmichael, CA",14,79,1,4.0,6/6/2013,"I've been here twice now: once for lunch and once for happy hour.  They have a great atmosphere inside the restaurant.  Beer selection is pretty decent, but they definitely seem to steer you towards their house brews - which are quite good.  Lunch was delicious and the portions were fine (even the small portion lunch was quite ample).  For happy hour we had drinks, appetizers and desserts.  The appetizers (we got the best beginnings platter) and the dessert (the pizookie party platter) were fantastic.  Drinks, however, were all over the map.  Beers were good, but the two mixed drinks my sister ordered were terrible (we all decided we had to taste them).  In their defense, our waitress was very accommodating and service was great.  I guess the lesson here is don't go to a brewhouse for mixed drinks!"
Colette P.,"Novato, CA",113,45,12,4.0,2/11/2013,"Food is great, good selection. However the service is hit or miss. Sometimes I have a great wait-person and other times I am left wondering how that staff member was hired."
Billy A.,"Sacramento, CA",31,141,205,4.0,5/13/2013,Good prices with large portions. I love the watermelon feta salad and the stuffed mushrooms. Both under $10 there Mac n cheese is absolutely mouthwatering. They stay busy but always have friendly and fast service. Open late so it's a great place to go and grab a bite to eat when ur hungry late night.
Anibal H.,"Sacramento, CA",6,6,,3.0,8/6/2011,"Definitely a good place to stop and have a nice lunch or happy hour deal.  The menu has so much variety that you are bound to find something to like. My 13-yr-old daughter and I simply had appetizers in the middle of the PM, and I have to say that the attention to detail and fresh ingredients was noticeable. And so inexpensive!  I agree with another reviewer who called out those who hate chain restaurants to get off their high horse.     The service was good and friendly.  We went to the one on Laguna Blvd  (Elk Grove), which on weekend nights is always packed, with families/ strollers in tow and long waiting lines.  Therefore the sound level can be a bit too much.  BJ's is a welcome addition to the Arden Fair Mall.  Let's only hope that it takes a while for the location in Arden to get to that level.  In the meantime, enjoy and be surprised!!"
Jessica P.,"Lincoln, CA",4,53,52,5.0,2/19/2013,"Went out for my Birthday last night, we had a party of 10 and we were served by Diego # 226. He was GREAT !! He had everything on point. Worth the price for the quality of food. I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch deep dish pizza , it was good but i definelty will stick to my Barbeque Chicken the flavor is great."
Ashton C.,"Fresno, CA",2,78,,1.0,4/3/2015,"Awful attitudes. My friend and I came here at 10pm for dinner, we drove from Santa Clara and we aren't familiar with the area. We arrive & the hostess just stares at us. No hello, no smile. My friend and I asked for a table & she told us that it was happy hour at the bar & it's probably easier if we just go seat ourselves. We looked at the bar & it  was completely packed. We told the hostess that there wasn't 2 seats for us to sit & she said we could probably ask someone to scoot over. Uh, no? We asked again for a table & she was like ""well...*eye roll* okay hold on."" Looks at this paper, assumingly, for open tables and then says ""k. Wait"". I looked at my friend & even she said that this hostess didn't want to seat us. I checked outside the door to see what time it closed just to make sure we weren't coming in like five or ten minutes before they closed, then I would understand because that is annoying. We showed up two hours before they closed at midnight. She grabs the menu's and says ""k this way."" Drops our menu's off and then just walks away. Our server took about 20 minutes to greet us but overall he was okay. I later overheard another female waitress yell ""Kevin!"" to one other server. She was at the register punching it something and my friend & I could hear her loud voice cussing away, bitching about how the hostess was double seating her. Being in restaurant business before, I could see why that would be overwhelming but this was a Thursday night, it was not crowded at all. I definitely think she could handle the few tables she had. She was dropping F bombs like no other (not that I care but in a professional setting, as loud as she was, was very inappropriate). The servers and hostess really need to act more professionally and straighten up their attitudes because they're not doing a good job hiding it and clearly they don't care."
Vicky Q.,"Sacramento, CA",68,153,264,4.0,11/7/2012,"I don't really care for BJ's but this Arden location is a bit better. Food tasted a little better but it might have been my perception of this new location. Only thing I like here is their pizza but I had their Thai Chicken salad last time and it was good. Great for late nights, food is okay, drinks are usualy good."
Randy M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,73,2,3.0,7/23/2014,"We had a great visit. Did the happy hour before the fair. Food was as expected for HH. 6$ pizza was nice portion but lacked sauce. Thought it was really dry. Dough was excellent. So were the toppings. The 4$ boneless wings were good too. Thought portion was a little small, but tasty. Avocado egg rolls were good but would like more crunch inside. I would order all again. Just add more sauce to the pizza. Overall, average to above for food quality during happy hour.  Pretty good drafts as well. I've always liked their beer. Went with IPA. Well balanced and easy to drink. We got the last bar table and our service was right on. Our server was attentive and she had great support. Love when teamwork is apparent. This location was good for us, Food wasn't quite four stars but better than most corporate chains for HH. Well try their non-happy hour pizza next time, looks really good. Would recommend."
Jim H.,"Sacramento, CA",23,134,9,4.0,10/29/2012,"I don't Yelp many ""chain"" restaurants but I really like this place. The happy hour is especially welcoming. They have 1$ off their drafts and discounted personal mini size pizzas. We really like their pizza here and we're kind of pizza snobs!  We had their spicy meat ball with sausage, jalapeño, spicy sauce. We split the mini pizza and added 2 small salads, 1 draft and a water. $16+  They have great dinners as well. Especially good is their chicken parmesan. We usually spit that as well because the portion is quite large. Yes, I am a fan."
Ronnie D.,"Dixon, CA",13,16,29,1.0,9/9/2013,"Went here for an early dinner with my wife and son after shopping the mall. There were hardly any people. After making it to the hostess desk and waiting for one of the three girls to stop gossiping and actually help us we were greeted with a ""how many?"" Then she turned back around and then we had to wait another minute for the other girl to start walking with our menus ( she realized we weren't following her then said ""oh this way."") The waitress had no idea about the pizza deal that had been advertised and charged us 22.95 plus tax when it was supposed to be 19.99. Oh and we had to ask her to get our empty plates and if we could have our dessert at some point because we already had our leftovers boxed up and the waitress still hadn't brought it out. unbelievable."
Madison A.,"Carmichael, CA",18,28,45,1.0,3/14/2012,Worst service ever. Been to plenty of bjs our server was horrible! Complained and management did nothing! Do not go there!
Bobby R.,"Napa, CA",14,13,8,4.0,8/25/2014,The place has Good beer and a really nice atmosphere. Super friendly staff. Ask for Rebecca-she's AWESOME
