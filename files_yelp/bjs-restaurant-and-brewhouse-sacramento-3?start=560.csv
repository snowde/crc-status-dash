Cindy M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,2.0,6/21/2013,So I went to BJs for the 1st time a few weeks ago. It took about 45 minutes to get a table (i understand its busy) They have a nice selection of drinks and food. I may have made a mistake i ordered the fried calamari =(  it was the worst i have ever had!!!! i should have ordered a Burger or pizza maybe it would have been better. Not to mention the waiter we got was kinda rude. I understand she was busy and maybe under stress but for a bill over 100 that women should have been a little nicer to us! If we decided to go back ill make sure to order something different and hope i don't get that same waiter.
SacTown G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,245,1,4.0,6/10/2013,"We had a great to-go purchase/meal this past Sunday. The woman who helped us was awesome. Boxed/bagged everything up and was super friendly.  I am not a BJ's ""fan"" but she was awesome and thus I was glad we brought in food for our office. Keep up the good work!  Oh ya, and there were several parking places out front, reserved for BJs togo orders, so was no problem parking!  Great job!"
Gayle P.,"Winter Park, FL",8,30,,1.0,11/4/2011,"I've been to many BJs locations, and this one my friends us the WORST!!! We were seated quickly but it took over 20 minutes before we were greeted. The server made no eye contact. She took our drink and appetizer order. 15 minutes later we got our appetizer, but still no drinks. Helloooo, it's deep- fried, I'm gonna choke. Food came out. THEN drinks came out. Drink order was wrong, and lo and behold, the food order was wrong too. Nearly an hour later, our server decided to check on us and ask if we wanted boxes. I had taken one bite of my dinner and she never even asked if it was ok. Don't even bother trying to explain the problem to management. They just make excuses without offering solutions. Spent nearly $50 for pretty much just an appetizer. So, we ended up going home and cooking for ourselves. Some night out!"
Food L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,46,,1.0,2/23/2013,"I was pretty hungry after walking around all day and thought to try this place out since it's relatively new to the mall.  Got some beers, and even though I didn't like the first one, I was able to exchange it with no additional charge: 1 star.  The time between ordering and receiving the appetizer was a long one hour.  Finally the main dish came out--we ordered pizza.  First of all, there was absolutely no sauce, very little cheese, very little meat/veggies (which were mostly from a can) on this pizza.  Basically, it was all fatty dough. Disgusting.  I was so hungry and had no choice but to eat some.   I asked to speak to the manager, who then told me that they don't use lots of sauce because it makes the dough soggy (umm...... then don't use so much dough, duh!).  Then she said that the cook simply did not ""disperse"" the ingredients evenly on the pizza (is that a euphemism for being cheap?).  She also said we came at the end of the dinner rush time, so that's why the wait was long.  I wasn't really happy with those explanations, and she offered to buy us dessert.  I didn't want more carbs after that pizza, so I asked if we could get a 20% discount.  Instead, we got $5 off our bill.   It seems like this place is having a lot of turnover.. one of the other reviews stated that the manager is male.  Also, if you're the manager of a restaurant, you want to keep customers coming back.  Sorry, $5 off isn't enough.  It seems like they are having this issue pretty often to not foot my bill.  Don't come here.  Poor management and very poor food.  $40 down the drain..that's like a top right?"
Grace W.,"Sacramento, CA",27,68,4,5.0,5/2/2012,"Reallly nice!!! I love the inside, its well set! Fancy much! Right when I walked in the hostess... smiled and she was super friendly, right when we sat down she kept lookin and she said ""I'm sorry you're just so pretty"" :) I left a big tip! Hahahaha"
Renee S.,"Carmichael, CA",21,2,,3.0,7/22/2014,"We go to BJ's about once a week for happy hour.  Always good food and usually good service. Today however the service left us feeling uncomfortable. While we were deep in conversation and both still drinking wine the server told us that we needed to pay the check now because she had to clock out, ""I literally have two minutes"". An unfortunate end to what was a good experience. It felt like all she wanted was her tip, she didn't really care about what our wants or needs were."
Dana C.,"Lodi, CA",708,491,855,4.0,4/13/2012,"What a great addition to Arden Mall... beers and shopping!  It's two of life's greatest pleasures all wrapped into one.  Perfect! My friend and I arrived around lunch time on a Tuesday afternoon.  Where do all of these people come from?  We were surprised at how busy both the mall and BJ's were. Sat in the bar and service was great!  Prompt attention and service from the nice bartender.  Beers were served in an ice cold glass.  Try the Jeremiah Red, it's yummy!   Ordered from the light fare menu.  The food was lacking in calories but not in taste!  Had 3 (very small) barbecoa tacos, which were served with black beans and a small pickled carrot/onion slaw.  The meat had good flavor, the beans weren't too salty and I felt satisfied after I ate.  Keep in mind, if you're really hungry, the tacos will not be enough! Finished our meal with a Piranha Pale Ale, which has a crisp hoppy finish.  Very yummy and worth trying. Overall, great service, good food, reasonably priced. Will I be back?  For shopping and beer... YES!"
lana Y.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/29/2011,"this particular location is so disorganized and the service here sucks!!! the last time i went here was in april!! i refuse to go to this BJ'S location. i go to the other locations only, this place truely sucks!!!  they gave me and my bf food poisoning!!! my brother went there a few weeks later had crappy service, they messed up his whole order.  They really need to rehire their whole crew!!!"
Elizabeth W.,"Sacramento, CA",148,26,100,4.0,11/28/2012,Great Customer Service. The Pastas and Pizza's are always fabulously delicious.
Cindy A.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,11,7,1.0,8/29/2011,"This is not the first time that I've been to a BJ's restaurant and not the first location either. Let me just say that I refuse to come back to this particular location! I had received the most terrible customer service ever!!! I met up with a friend for lunch and we got the same thing basically. We ordered from the lunch special menu. I got a half sandwich with house salad and my friend ordered a half sandwich as well with soup. I'm a big fan of this lunch option especially because I'm a  person who never finishes a whole sandwich in one sitting unless I'm there for 5 hours lol.  First off, our waitress was quite awkward with us but we got seated fairly quick. After we ordered, our food took forever to arrive--around 40+ mins. When we finally received our food, I noticed that my salad did not look the freshest. I picked out a lot of stuff that just looked off. My sandwich was burnt...while my friend's sandwich looked perfectly golden brown. I ripped a corner of the bread to taste...it was inedible. I told the waitress how I needed a new sandwich. Minutes later, a manager or whatever came over to our table and apologized to me about the sandwich, which I thought was great customer service! Boy, was I wrong! I waited about 15 minutes for the new sandwich to come out,  IT WAS THE SAME SANDWICH! The manager personally brought it out to me and I told him, but he LIED to me that it's a brand new one.....First of all, do not lie to my face when I know it is the same sandwich with a missing corner that I ate! We were kind of arguing which is just ridiculous. After questioning him for an explanation, he was forced to bring it back. I had to wait again....for like 20 mins for the new one. I was furious... I spent all my time waiting when I was starving!!"
Justin T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",813,11,1,1.0,4/1/2012,"HORRIBLE! THEE worst Bj's I have ever been to. Me and my friends walk in then we wait for a bit... There's seating everywhere. Then we get seated. We're waiting for the longest time and we're not even asked if we want waters. Another group sits down and they're served. We wait about an hour just sitting there and still no service so we get up and walk the fuck out. The lady at the front says ""Have a great day"" and we're all whatever about it. SOOOO DISAPPOINTED! If I could, I'd give -5 stars."
Rene L.,"Sacramento, CA",739,431,195,5.0,6/28/2011,"i don't care that it's in Arden Mall.  i could give 2 Sh$%s the food is generic and processed.  i'll even tolerate crowds if i have to. i'm here for the Wyder's pear CIDER on tap!!! $5.50 pints for happy hour in the bar area drew me in like a bug zapper.   when sitting at the bar the bartenders have always been on it with pint refills and food orders.  servers are a little slower when you're sitting in the bar booths, but nothing compared to the turtle race in the regular dining area... happy hours m-f 3pm-7pm sun-thurs 10pm-midnight"
Christian B.,"San Francisco, CA",56,43,,1.0,9/14/2011,"I've just eaten at this restaurant again, coerced by a family member due to a school-fundraiser the night we went.  BJs gives 15% of your check to the school, a noble goal I applaud.   The applause ends there, however.  On my first visit several months ago, it couldn't have been worse.  This time, it was just plain old bad.  I had salmon.  Had that fish in life actually experienced salt water?  One family member had mac & cheese.  He's 7.  I am sure he was delighted to see an exact replica of the Kraft version we serve at home.  I wasn't.  No one had a positive experience.   Oh, did I mention the starter salad?  A few shreds of iceberg, one slice of a rock-hard ""tomato"", and a few croutons.  I had been asked if I wanted my salad dressing on the side or mixed in with the salad.  I picked ""mixed in.""  It arrived ""lumped on top of.""   The server was nice and upbeat - but repeatedly intruded mid-bite, mid-sip (wine), mid-word.    Through a horrible mischance, I managed yet again to go to another BJs, this one in Rocklin just a few nights before the Arden visit.  JUST AS BAD!  Stay clear of BJs if you want competent service and good food.  AWFUL."
Phil K.,"Sacramento, CA",156,138,5,3.0,12/5/2011,"The food is great, beer selection legit, service is pretty bad.  I dont really blame the staff itself, they are usually quite friendly, I blame the management.  The bar area is always packed and they seem to be understaffed."
Lindsay S.,"West Sacramento, CA",22,4,,2.0,1/18/2012,"The food was ok, but the service was very slow. I waited a good 5 minutes for the waitress to bring me ketchup before going inside and looking for it myself. It wasn't even busy! I also ordered Cream soda for dessert and never got it. The waitress never wrote down my order! When I finally told another server to just cancel the drink order( we were about to leave by this point), she apologized and offered to comp it for me and bring it in a to go cup. Great. Except no one ever brought it to me and we finally just left without it."
Steve B.,"Livermore, CA",4,32,,4.0,9/30/2012,Food was excellent! It was a Saturday night so there was a bit of a wait with a family of seven.  Service was good and everything was enjoyable.  Most importantly the beer was cold and tasty!
Randall F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/16/2011,"I'm sure the food would have been good if it hadn't been left out for 20 minutes. We ordered at 2, didn't received the food until 2:45. The appetizers were served the same time as our entrees, all of it completely cold. They just forgot to bring our food when it was ready.   The servers look like they were hired based on their appearance rather than their skill.  I agree with others that the food could be good, they just need to improve their level of service. The manager was kind enough to comp the bill and understood the problem; so at least they may be aware of the service issues."
Robert N.,"Sacramento, CA",9,13,,1.0,7/16/2014,Ten of us for lunch on Sunday.  Food came in shifts of two plates at a time by the time the ninth person was served the first people were through eating.  My order did not come until after everyone else had eaten.  Food was mediocre at best.  Manager did comp my late meal.  Personally I don't ever have to eat here again.  While they had just opened a hour earlier we had a waitress change in the course of our meal.  Poor staff management in my opinion.
Dreas L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,13,,1.0,3/30/2011,"I brought my family here for dinner last night and won't be back. I would rather drive a few miles and go to the BJ's in Natomas or in Roseville. It started out by waiting a few minutes at the hostess booth for her to acknowledge us. Apparently she was too busy in discussion with the Manager and a server regarding the server's assigned section for the night. They finally moved to the side then the hostess immediately took care of a couple that just walked in after us. I am giving her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't see us even though no one else was around. We were then seated and our server took our order and served our drinks within a few minutes.  After about 20 minutes, we inquired about our food since we only ordered 2 mini pizzas, a kid's meal and a salad. The place was fairly empty being that it was a weekday and only 5pm.  The server said that our order would be out soon. After another 15 minutes, we inquired about our order again since our 3 year old was quite hungry. The server said that they had to remake one of the pizzas, however she made sure our order was pushed to the front of the line!?! At this point, we were done with this place as food was being delivered to people all around us that came in after us.  I asked to have the food packed to go as our 3 year old wasn't able to sit any longer. I also asked to see a Manager since the wait time was ridiculous. The Manager talked to us for a few minutes, gave a less than sincere apology and that was it.  Our order was finally brought to our table....with the exception of our 3 year old kid's meal. *Sigh* Yep, they forgot the kid's meal. We waited 10 more minutes for the kid's meal then packed all the food ourselves in the take-out containers, paid for the food and quickly left the place.  Needless to say, we will never return."
Lana F.,"Carmichael, CA",20,1,,1.0,7/29/2011,"When paying for your meal with your credit card never ever leave the ""tip and total"" blank!!!! Our waitress was Shannon I think was her name?... She did a horrible job but regardless we still left her a CASH tip... Two days later after checking my account I was charged $5 more then the amount I authorized! I call the restaurant and they fax me my reciept. Sure enough she writes in her own tip and the total!!!!!!! Apparently she thought she deserved more then what we gave her.! They refunded my $5 tip that she stole.. Its not about the $5.. I can care less .. She stole from me!!! I hope they have a no tolerance on this kind of stuff! People check your receipts!!!!!  I never write reviews... This was just to bazar for me to leave out!!!!! Very dissatisfied!!!!!"
