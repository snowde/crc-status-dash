Meh S.,"Sacramento, CA",37,42,19,4.0,3/21/2012,"Came here with my cousin, had the the country fried steak. Couldnt finish it and it was a tad too dry for me. The place feels alive and good service. I havent come here enough to have a favorite dish yet."
Stephanie S.,"Suisun City, CA",35,6,1,1.0,3/19/2011,"Went to promo grand opening and it was a horrible experience. Billy the floor manager was explaining that our food was traveling around the restaurant and that was why we didnt get it in timely manner. Once he found our pizza it had already been eaten by someone else so they ordered us another and in the meantime he brought out our desserts before our pizza. He explained that the kitchen is closed therefore he had to bring out the dessert. He also stated that ""we have to keep it moving because we have to be out by 9"". When we said we havent even had our pizza yet he stated ""well the kitchen is closed and thats why we are paying for the food tonight"". Not only did they seat our reserved party in two different tables, but could not have two drinks on one table....  One party member was double charged for drinks. It was a mess!!!! Our party from work will never go there again and will not recommend this specific location to anyone. In fact we are telling everyone!"
Sankari V.,"Roseville, CA",3,77,118,2.0,4/25/2011,"First visit 3 weeks ago was fabulous. So we ordered takeout the second time. The bread in our sandwich had mold in it. Called and complained. Decided to give it another shot. This time we were the first customers in the restaurant. Confusion at front desk as to where we should be seated. Looks like the hostess was new.  Experience was okay at the best. The croutons in our salad were stale. Decided to try again last week. Long hair in our salad. Manager apologized and offerewd another salad. This is it. Can't screw up thrice in just over three weeks. Good Bye, BJ's."
Sarah C.,"Sacramento, CA",263,28,4,3.0,5/2/2012,"This was my third, maybe 4th time at this location. Each time I think the quality service has improved. I remember my first time here--maybe because the restaurant was still new-- the service was horrible! no refills, never checked back on us, ghetto servers etc. my last visit was last week for happy hour. I ordered Balsamic Glazed Chicken--my go to entree. I love the mash potato, flavors and all, although my chicken was a bit dry. We had calamari--which was a bit burnt. Also the Ahi Poke which was not as tart as I would like. I usually only go to BJ's when someone else mentions it, not my personal favorite, it's just convenient for late night happy hours, or since we're close by."
Jason F.,"Carmichael, CA",8,24,,2.0,1/12/2013,Well the wait is not worth it at all i have been there alot and the wait just pisses me off i left there last night at 10 because of a 45 min wait and prior to that we ate there and it has by far the worst pizza on earth the people there a snoty and rude as well to many kiss ass yuppies trying to act like their shit don't stink
Melissa B.,"Beaverton, OR",297,208,79,3.0,1/24/2012,"The food is good, but the service is just... OK. It takes either standing up or flagging someone down a few times to get their attention. I'll cut them some slack though, because I know it's new. And I'd only eat there during happy hour."
Dave H.,"Sacramento, CA",275,113,89,3.0,2/19/2012,its pretty good food. I DONT like rehearsed service though. No personalization. Trained monkey servers. Food is pricey and beers are as well. Good ambience though. Might go back.
Dane M.,"Sacramento, CA",43,22,,4.0,11/8/2012,"The manager comped our dessert yesterday after they overcooked my burger.  Still one of my favorite places to eat, and the second burger was tasty."
Istvan T.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",0,2,2,1.0,5/22/2013,"We went here with a couple of friends for my birthday dinner. I used to like this place: decent food with reasonable prices, good beers, etc. Our dinner was fine and I really wouldn't have any complaints about the place, but it turned out that I forgot a little envelope or little holder type of thing on our table, that had a gift card and a ticket to a show in it. That was my birthday present. About 45 minutes after leaving I realized what happened and I called them. The manager on duty told me the table was already cleaned (the place was closed already), there was nothing left on it and nobody had turned anything in. It's been almost a week now, I have called a few times and their whole attitude is oh, well, that's pretty much gone and there's really nothing they can do for me. I have a real problem with a place like this. Somebody either took my things or threw it out by mistake. Either way BJ's should take responsibility for their employees' actions."
Justin L.,"Sacramento, CA",151,61,,1.0,5/31/2011,"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in quite some time.  Food was bland and uninspired at best.  Service?  What service?  Waited ten min for my drink just tomb told they're out.  Waited another 10 minutes for them to bring me a beer.  Total wait time 20 min for one beer.  Waited another 5-10 min for the girl to come take our orders.  The tv was on an infomercial the whole time instead of sports ... Asked 3 times and yet the station was never changed.  Also asked for horseradish 3 dif times and FINALLY got it by the time I had just about finished my meal.  This is really nothing more than a very loud, ""brewery"" themed Cheesecake Factory.  Oh and if I forgot to say it already... The service SUCKS!"
SassySusan K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,15,,2.0,10/11/2012,Just ok.  The food wasn't impressive and service was poor.  I won't return.  Can get better food at the food court.
Esther S.,"Sacramento, CA",132,72,16,5.0,1/17/2012,"I recommend  using the call ahead feature available. i usually call about 5 for 6pm and im usually put first on the list (even on Friday & Saturday nights!). the menu offers a wide variety of items so there's something for everyone's appetite. the staff is very friendly and very accommodating. for the price you'd pay for at your ""neighborhood"" regular spot , you can get  much better quality and better choices. 5 stars!"
Wayne L.,"West Sacramento, CA",20,105,14,3.0,1/10/2012,"The burgers are above average, the place is clean and the service is great.  Nothing special, just another Hard Rock Cafe styled burger joint.  Avocado egg rolls are pretty good... I'll go back..."
Brandon L.,"Stockton, CA",125,71,103,3.0,1/10/2012,"I've been to a lot of the locations actually, but this one was a little different.  They didn't have the pasta I wanted :(  But I got a crispy chicken sandwich with the thin fries, and that was pretty tasty.  I went with my big, and it was just like any other BJ's I guess.  The service was alright, but we did have a bit of trouble for a little while trying to get napkins from our waitress.  No room for a pizookie though.  BJ's is a nice place with a good eating environment.  My big bro is gonna get me FAT though :("
Jill R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,1,,4.0,9/11/2012,Had lunch today with my sister and BJ's and the service was great. The place was also clean. Good food.....We'll be back
Allie S.,"Sacramento, CA",28,108,2,3.0,12/18/2011,I think the delicious pizza's and beers may be the only thing most BJ's have on their side. I find the salads and soups mediocre. The appetizers are simple. But the service is typically nice and the lean menu is worth a looksy.
Matt R.,"El Segundo, CA",109,180,98,3.0,1/16/2012,"Just like any other BJ's. This one is particularly new. Ate here Saturday night the 14th. Jamell was my waiter. He's a bit loud and over the top, but overall a nice guy. There was a good mix of people. Not too ghetto and not too fancy."
Nisa N.,"Brooklyn, NY",383,241,84,3.0,4/14/2011,"A great addition to Arden Fair Mall.  I tried their Grand Cru brew and was pleased.  I don't typically like dark beers but this was good and I also ordered the chicken marsala to pair with it.  It went really well.  My companion had a salad.  BORING!  The service was ok; our original server left during the middle of our service and her replacement was kind of slow.  Otherwise, I'd return anytime I'm at the mall.  Beer beats shopping!"
Kerry D.,"Pineville, LA",1,17,,3.0,8/14/2012,"I live in Arden-Arcada, and after Sac Brew closed a few years ago- we have nothing here in the way of microbrew pubs  (there is now Kilt Pub on Arden, a much smaller not so-interesting place).  Anyway, when word BJ's was coming to this area- I immediately hoped they'd take over the old Macaroni Grill location on Alta Arden (which now has become In n Out)   Obviously they didn't, and opted to go right inside the ghetto Arden Fair mall.... well, the consequences of that are apparent.... For one, I can't stand the culture of the entire Arden Fair area- it is sooo ghetto.  Thus I hoped putting the BJ's away from the mall a bit would help- but that didn't happen. So, most times I go to this place (since I have few other choices that aren't a difficult drive from my house)  I deal with the typical ""Arden ghetto-kids""  who are a unique culture of ghetto-rap dressing, meth-head talking misfits who I really don't see around town BUT in this area!   And they are all often at BJ's- talking in their rattle-trap loud way as usual, ordering elaborate shots of liquor to impress their skanky girlfriends.. making the experience for those around them very annoying.  I go to Roseville- I don't see these types of kids.  I go to Reno- they don't exist there.  It is just ARDEN!  So the clientelle here sucks, period.  But other than that, the food is always good, the beers are good with good selection, the service is mediocre  (typical rather aloof hostesses that you encounter at most every other place in the Sacramento area).  Also, I've noticed the prices of their beers & food keep going up every time I visit this place practically-  nearly approaching Yard House levels!  You'd think with the economy sucking in Sacramento, as well as nationwide- that places like this would get a clue and maybe-  make things affordable??  I guess that light hasn't gone on in the heads of the owners here. But to sum up- good food, good beer, mediocre service, and really ghetto annoying clientelle- especially in the bar area.  Really not the place to go to meet a quality random stranger- unless they are just there to shop, eat & escape quickly."
Michelle B.,"Centennial, CO",60,60,3,4.0,1/12/2012,"This is a newer location so it is still going through some growing pains, but the food is still delicious. It's a good place to grab a bite for happy hour and then maybe get some power shopping done. The servers seems nice and respond to new customers in a timely manner. I haven't sat in the dining area to have a meal, only at the bar, and that's because I don't want to wait for a table. The bar area is a little on the chilly side so bring a coat. All in all I'd go back again."
