Carlos M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,2,5.0,6/17/2017,"First experience at a BJ's. Very satisfying. Good food and great service!  It's noisy but it has a bar, so you would expect that.  Nonetheless, great experience. Would recommend!"
Nate C.,"Fremont, CA",15,13,1,5.0,8/7/2017,Great service from Chad in the cocktail area. Only had to ask for everything one time and he was as friendly and as fast as it gets. The other cocktail staff could use some lessons lol. Great meal though thanks!
Melissa Q.,"Vacaville, CA",4,12,1,5.0,9/18/2017,"Our waiter Adam is awesome, he brought JT a bowl of fruit and bread right away to calm him down."
Caroline N.,"San Jose, CA",0,41,,4.0,11/18/2017,Great place to grab happy hour items! The atmosphere is very good although the service could be better.
Trina R.,"Fremont, CA",223,169,474,2.0,1/4/2016,"First time ever for this location with a friend.  My friend and I sat by the bar. Not the best place to sit at because 1. we felt neglected from our waiter, he only saw us 3 times. My friend had to flag down a different waitress.  We ordered 2 drinks. I forgot what my friend ordered but it had to with peach and I ordered the Royal soda Cream soda drink. I am sorry I forgot the name of the drinks we ordered but I remember both drinks were strong. That's when we tried to flag down our waiter to bring us water and cream soda for it to help with how strong our drink was. It took quite awhile for him to come around but instead he never did so therefore that's when we had to flag down the waitress, haha. It's just disappointing to neglect your customers):  We also ordered chips and spinach artichoke dip which was good! The calamari we ordered wasn't crispy at all, it was on the soft side but we are still thankful :) it was just a different texture in our mouth.  The pizookie we ordered was cookies n Creme! Wawow! So yummy, that's my favorite flavor of pizookie from BJ's.  I would definitely come back to dine in for the pizookies and their buffalo wings; their buffalo wings are good too."
Preet K.,"Yuba City, CA",0,3,2,1.0,11/26/2017,I love BJ's but i'm giving this one star to a server name Lydia. We were just there and this lady wasn't professional at all. She looked and talked to my fiancé the whole time and ignored me like I'm not even there. My fiancé over heard an older lady say the same thing to her husband that Lydia was only talking to him and not even looking at her. Anyhow when we asked for the check she ignored me again and asked my fiancé if we are paying separate in a very unprofessional manner which we found very INSULTING cuz I'm sure it was pretty obvious that we are a couple if she didn't notice my ring. Customer service should be a significant part of the job description when BJ's hire these people. This wasn't our first weird encounter there but this particular one was a bit insulting.
Summer M.,"Sacramento, CA",462,768,1213,3.0,12/28/2016,"I don't usually eat at chain restaurants like BJ's, but we stopped in since we were at the mall and starving- and the experience was pretty legit. It was the lunch rush with several people waiting for tables, but we were seated right away. The wait time for ordering/getting our food was not too bad- maybe 5 minutes til they came to take our order, 10-15 until we were served. I got a orange cream craft soda and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, and both were delicious. (Plus, as one of the ""Enlighted Favorites"", the tacos were quite diet-friendly. Score!) Plus they have some kind of rewards program for regular customers that my friend swears by. If you're at the mall and want something more substantial than greasy food court fare, give BJ's a try."
Angela S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,1,1.0,11/24/2017,"We went here the other night. No one greeted us and it wasn't even crowded so we left. This place is definitely overrated and cater to the people they ""think"" have money. Well you missed out because we definitely have a ton of money and always tip 30-40 percent. I guess we didn't miss much as people say you compare to a Denny's anyway."
Oscar M.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/24/2017,Great friendly staff... had a great time thanksss for the awesome food and service.i would definitely recommend this location to family and friends
Donna S.,"Roseville, CA",623,709,1055,5.0,12/11/2016,"This was my first time in a BJbrew house in any location .  It was very comfortable .  It's Christmas time so they are extremely busy .  The menu is extensive and all sorts of choices from different types of food. Our server was excellent . Very sincere and helpful.  Very personable.  The food came out quickly and was very satisfying .  It's a big place and popular . It's great for families! Yes the sound level is high but is a fun place with plenty of action. If your into sports it's all around you on tvs. You name it , it's on.  Fun place and good food!"
Jim R.,"Sacramento, CA",466,46,21,4.0,9/19/2017,Very good food. The service is very nice. The staff accompanied our wishes to turn down the loud music. They also adjusted the thermostat because it was too cold. Very pleasant atmosphere. A large selection of entrees. Gluten free entrees
Ryah B.,"West Sacramento, CA",148,60,2,1.0,2/14/2017,"Picked up to-go and told the staff I would be sitting and waiting in the lobby. They said 20 minutes, so then 35 minutes goes by and i finally ask someone and they said it's been sitting in their warmer. I check on the food and it's no longer hot. $53 of food that is barely warm? Explained the situation to the manager and she said ""I can heat it up for you."" Mmm overcooked pizza and appetizers...? Hahaha.  Thanks! Zero stars if I could."
Liana B.,"Sacramento, CA",231,266,965,4.0,11/17/2015,"Came here for a quick lunch on a Monday. My friend and I sat at the bar and were greeted immediately.  Bj's has good lunch specials! We both had the unlimited soup and salad. You can order any soup and salad at any given time with this deal. I had a bowl of their clam chowder, which was way too salty, and two of their Caesar salads, which was delicious! The greens tasted fresh, there was an abundance of Parmesan cheese, and the croutons were crunchy and well seasoned. I haven't been this excited about a Caesar salad in a long time lol. My friend had the chicken tortilla soup and the tomato and mozzarella salad. She said the soup was lukewarm, but the salad was good.  Service was quick and efficient, and we were in and out! I would definitely come back for their lunch specials."
Cheryl G.,"Sacramento, CA",146,140,28,5.0,1/29/2017,My new mission in life is to get Logan promoted from to go to server/server trainer. Or anything above that. After the horrible to go experience I had last month I was absolutely pissed off with this place. But with me having to work late & it being 1130 at night his attentiveness & cheery attitude was worth it. I deal with a lot of businesses & he is one of the best. And he's not a server yet! And he beats most of the the other ones during a slow business day. He actually cares about his work. So once he gets promoted ask for him. I'll make sure his section stays busy & full.
CB R.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,11,,4.0,4/19/2017,"We were seated very quickly on Easter Sunday when many restaurants had long waits if they had any seats at all, so that was very nice. All of the front-of-house staff were very friendly and accommodating, quickly swapping out a high chair for a booster seat, and keeping all of the glasses full. Everyone in our party expressed that their entrees turned out perfectly, and our starter was equally good and we went through it quickly. My rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly to medium-rare and the roasted asparagus and brussel sprouts will change your mind if you didn't already enjoy these vegs. I'm off desserts currently but the selections, like the rest of the menu, is extensive and you can always find something to match your mood or current cravings. BJ's is always a great go-to when your party can't all decide on any place else!"
phyllis n.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,37,,5.0,11/11/2017,"We have been to this restaurant dozens and dozens of times. The service today was outstanding all thanks to Angela T.  She was crazy busy but still had time to not only make us feel welcome but to chat with us. Rarely, do you meet someone who within five minutes of meeting them that you realize they are beyond special.  Thank you Angela for making our Veterans' Day memorable!"
Cindy W.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",299,187,707,4.0,1/26/2016,"This Bjs is usually busy because it is located right in the Arden Fair Mall. They are open until midnight.  Our friends wanted to stop by the bar for some drinks. The bar area was self seating. The service was a bit slow. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, guacamole with chips and calamari. The appetizer came out quick. The food is always delicious there. The pizza was good with the drinks."
Jennifer M.,"Sacramento, CA",135,134,595,5.0,11/8/2015,"5 ***Star***burger alert! Dam.....I knew I was going to be happy to get one of these first class burgers in my mouth! My tastebuds and I are very happy we went with the classic burger with guac and french fried onions! Mmm....mmmmm....m! I am already plotting my next conquer for B.J's.  So on to the shoestring fries....whoo hoo says my belly... Crisp, tasty and well seasoned! Ketchup was not even necessary for this splendid treat. The other option was thick wedged seasoned fries- I am confident either choice would not disappoint! *The expected wait was 25 minutes...we were seated in 5....server was uber attentive, our drinks were always full and no hard sales on apps or beverages. This was a great dining experience!"

Ricky M.,"Sacramento, CA",76,127,463,5.0,11/8/2015,The burgers are off the chain. The skinny fries were delicious. Even the ice tea stayed filled up the whole time. The waitress was there at every turn. Even though it was super busy.  I think this is my first five star review.  Even when we first walked in the hostess told us a 20 minute wait. 5 minutes at the most. We will be back for sure.
