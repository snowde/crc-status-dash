Denise L.,"Houston, TX",23,149,84,3.0,8/4/2011,"i do come here often because its convenient to work but i dread going there.  there is always something i have issue with.  usually its service related.  i drink water and i am constantly having to ask for water refills.  if it were a bar drink they would be there to offer to get me a new one every time i put the empty glass down, but i guess since its just water, they dont care whether or not i have water."
Christian Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,6,,3.0,7/2/2011,"I personally love BJs, and usually enjoy any trip here. Except this time the service was quite bad, including a waiter pointedly ignoring our questions. We would ask them for water, but the two waiter waitress we asked said ""yeah ok"" then didn't get them until 10 minutes later. I had the BJ's Burger which was quite good, the garlic french roll was crispy and delicious and my medium rare burger was well received by my taste buds. Good food, bad service."
Juan A.,"Lansing, MI",64,298,134,4.0,11/8/2011,"Up to the standards of my usual Bj's.. Great food, great beer, great atmosphere, and friendly waitress...."
Shelly S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,,3.0,4/11/2014,"I went here for lunch with a friend on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't that crowded which was nice.   I ordered some chicken tacos and thought it was delicious.  The waitress who helped us was pretty nice.  The only thing I didn't like so much was the lighting inside the restaurant.  It was really dark and it would have been nicer to be able to see what we were eating.  Other thank that, I'd come here again for the food."
John C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",5,195,20,4.0,11/1/2011,The pizza are the best I have ever had. I would strongly recommend the beer sampler. BJ's is just a great restaurant all around.
Thanh N.,"沖縄県, Japan",172,314,87,4.0,9/10/2011,I received a call from the Manager at this location regarding my experience and he has sent a $25 gift card to make up for the bad service I experienced. =)
Sam H.,"Sacramento, CA",2,2,,4.0,3/17/2012,Upon entering this establishment the lighting was just what I needed to relax after a long day of shopping with friends. The wait time was 30 minutes but we got lucky and got a table in the bar area.  The drinks were fabulous and the food came within an appropriate timeframe of 20 min or so.  Loved it!!
Jeannette C.,"Sacramento, CA",94,31,19,4.0,9/25/2011,"Good spot for a quick lunch with my kids before going inside the mall on a sunday afternoon.  Service was fairly quick, we didn't have to wait too long for a table to be seated and food came before they finished coloring.  Calamari was greasier than usual but otherwise, pizza & ck tenders with baffalo sauce were awesome!"
Erin R.,"Danville, CA",1,31,21,2.0,11/30/2012,"We were on our way home from Tahoe on a Sunday and wanted to catch a little football so we stopped at BJ's in Sacramento. We sat in the bar which wasn't too crowded...and that's where it all began. SMH It took over 15 minutes just to get a menu and another 20 minutes for our waitress to bring us water & take our order. Again, they were not slammed so it was hard to figure out what was taking so long. We were all pretty hungry so the longer we waited the worse it got. After waiting for 40 minutes we finally got our food. And after all of that waiting...the waitress got my order wrong! A veggie burger on a wheat bun is not that complicated, right?!? So back to the kitchen it went and I didn't see it again for another 15 minutes SIGH. There is no reason lunch at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon should take over an hour and a half for 3 people. The food itself was alright but in no way could make up for the lack of attentiveness or pace of the service in which we received."
Blake C.,"CA, CA",252,282,64,4.0,7/11/2011,"It's so great that this place is at the mall now. Good food, good ambiance, good service. Not bad for a chain restaurant! And even better that it is now in the Arden mall so you can do some shopping and eat."
Sarah B.,"Galt, CA",56,203,61,3.0,3/29/2011,"Came last night to check out the newest Bj's over at the Arden Fair Mall. The food was good as it always is at all Bj's. You know nothing special, but really good for it being a chain. I tried something completely different than I usually get, the Roast Beef Dip with horseradish sauce, it was wonderful! I love horseradish and this complimented it perfectly. The BF got the pizza and it was cooked heavenly, crust so light and buttery.  The service is another story. I understand that this is a brand new restaurant, which means there will be brand new servers, but I work in the mall and I know for a fact they were doing dry runs to practice for almost two weeks! That means they were serving food and customers before the opened to the public for almost two weeks. We were seated in the back and were not served in a timely manner. There were plenty of of other tables filled around us, other servers came and served the other tables, as we still waited. When we were finally served the server was very nice, but she had a head server or manager, not really sure was he was since he never introduced himself, with her. He literally stood there watching her with a stop watch in his hand! WEIRD! If she was training, then he or even she should have explained the uncomfortable situation that was in play. Through out our dinner he followed her to our table with out ever saying a word. The other thing that bothered me about the service was that there were TONS of servers, bussers, food runners all over the place and yet we were still ignored many a times. I work in a restaurant and if there are than many people hangin' around the service should be on point! But I can't blame our server Jolene, she was nice and tried to be very helpful, it seemed she needed help at times, but that guy, Steve was his name, never did at all. Oh except once he asked, ""Is she getting you another beer?"" hahaha Oh well. As for decor, I love what they have done to the place. I seriously never knew there was so much space when it was California Cafe. The bar is awesome too, can't wait to come by after work one day. This Bj's is definitely going to be a great addition to the mall."
Ema M.,"Carmichael, CA",34,29,57,4.0,8/1/2011,"Great food. Great location, I thought the service was really good. I def. will be going back."
Chris C.,"Elk Grove, CA",8,63,8,1.0,11/13/2013,I will never return!!   We told the waitress we were on lunch for work so you would think she would speed up the process.    It took 25 minutes for our food and another 15 minutes waiting for our check to be taken care of.    My food was cold and my burger was overdone.
Jenny Y.,"Sacramento, CA",148,196,598,3.0,7/23/2011,"I love the BBQ Chicken pizza from this place.  I've tried the pastas before and it's not bad, but I rather order a pizza when I come here instead.  The pizookie's are delicious, too bad they down sized it for the birthday person. I don't have any complaints about this place.  Good customer service, but sometimes the wait does get long."
Chuck D.,"Rohnert Park, CA",1,37,,5.0,3/4/2012,"Excellent food, atmosphere, and service.  Prices are excellent for this level of dining. I will definitely come back."
Nick W.,"San Diego, CA",25,61,17,3.0,7/12/2011,"I have to admit that I've been to two different BJ's and this one is a lot fancier than the one I've been to back in La Jolla.  It is relatively new and I have to say that the food is just as good as the other place.   Parking: Parking is pretty easy to find since there are lots all around the place, since it's in the mall.  Plus if you walk far, you can really walk off that pizookie.   Service: I didn't have to wait very long when I came into the restaurant.  The hostess was really nice and offered us indoors or patio and was very nice about it.  My waitress was relatively nice and always checking in on us.  I ordered a Mango Tango because I felt like having a drink, and it didn't come out right away.  The waitress came back and asked me if I had gotten my drink yet and took care of it.  She was always upfront with us and very polite making sure that we were satisfied with everything.   Food:  We got the BJ's combo deep dish pizza and I wasn't fully pleased with it, but I did enjoy it.  When I normally go to BJ's I get the Great White or BBQ Chicken Pizza; however, because my friend didn't enjoy spicy, we went with the combo.  There wasn't really anything special with it.  The sausage was well done, but everything else just seemed okay to me.  My Mango Tango seemed like it had too much rum in it.  I wasn't sure what to do, since I didn't want to send it back.  But yeah, I could definitely taste more of the alcohol after a bit, and since I needed to drive, I passed on drinking it after having a couple sips.  Then afterwards, we ordered the pizookie trio, and I have to say that pizookies have definitely gotten worse.  They used to be in a bigger pan, now they come out in a small dinky pan.  I'm utterly disappointed because I used to come to BJ's just for the Pizookie.  The oreo pizookie wasn't that great in my opinion.  It was really dry even with the ice cream, because of the fashion that oreo cookies are.  The chocolate chip and white chocolate chip and macadamia nut ones were alright though.  It's just sad the fact that because of everything in the world, things are getting cut.   Overall, my experience though was good.  I like the environment of this restaurant over the one back in La Jolla.  I like how there's a lot of space, a big bar, and nice dining areas.  On top of that, the food quality wasn't poor, but it wasn't grand.  I think it's because of the pizza we got, but yeah, hard to tell.  I definitely say, that if you haven't experience something like BJ's, then you should check this place out.  My friend compared the pizza we got to the one at Chicago fire, and she really couldn't decide which one she liked better. Although, she did enjoy the ""cookie pizza"" more than the pizookies.  The reason why I can't give it more than average, is because the place isn't better than what I expected it to be.  It was just your average place that gave you what you want, not beyond that."
Danny C.,"Oakland, CA",225,43,2,3.0,8/7/2011,"Tends to get really crowded, but their hefe is my favorite."
Josiah P.,"Sacramento, CA",215,38,2,2.0,5/17/2011,Fried artichoke hearts were good. Jambalaya was entirely too salty. Should have stuck with pizza.
Michelle A.,"Rocklin, CA",96,2,,3.0,9/28/2011,"Really, how can you go wrong with a huge chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream?"
