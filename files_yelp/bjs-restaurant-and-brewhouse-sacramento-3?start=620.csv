Susan D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/27/2013,"Stopped in for an early dinner with a party of three.  I really enjoyed the parmesan crusted chicken and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  My dinner companions also enjoyed their meals (chicken alfredo and balsamic chicken).  I liked the atmosphere, upscale yet casual and I have to say the service was good also.  I will go back to try other menu offerings."
M C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,82,10,3.0,9/5/2013,"Good food, nice happy hour, I'll go back.  The only negative is the margarita's are probably some of the worst in town...this chain needs to fix their recipe."
Brandon H.,"Galt, CA",51,6,1,5.0,8/7/2011,"I love BJ's! I haven't had anything there that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. From their soups and salads, to their steak and desserts, everything is delicious there. And they pretty much have everything on their menu. Especially their in house brewed beers, and root beer, yum! You can easily spend $50 for two people without breaking a sweat. But it's worth it. The environment is appealing, the servers are friendly, but I'd recommend calling ahead, as there is almost always a wait."
M B.,"Houston, TX",0,50,1,5.0,7/13/2012,Walked in around 430 and sat at bar. Waited on in 10 seconds. Had margarita and then a couple of beers. Had wedge saad with a mini pizza. Great deal. Good food and excellent service. Happy hour prices are excellent.
Joe F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,,3.0,5/25/2011,A good example of a restaurant that tries to do too many things.  The result is a very AVERAGE experience.  Not bad...just not great.
Jess B.,"Sacramento, CA",40,11,,4.0,9/16/2011,"BJ's has a great selection of food and beer.  If you can, hit up the lunch specials or happy hour for great prices.  They also offer specials during NFL games."
Stacia O.,"Isleton, CA",3,2,,2.0,6/24/2013,"We chose this restaurant over others nearby because we thought they could handle a 11 person party. We waited along time for seating and then our buzzer really wasn't working. We had a round of a couple different waiters, the last one was really pretty good. But the food took forever to come. It was our 12yrs birthday so they did bring a candle on a dessert for her, which made her day but then the other kids desserts didn't come for along time. They all sat around looking at hers! I just felt that the restaurant was very slow on the food. I had a BBQ chicken salad but it had just a little bit of chicken, and one of our party's pizza was cold. Overall we won't be back. It wasn't the experience we expected. We live an hour away and when we drive that far to visit a restaurant it needs to be better than that."
Lai P.,"Sacramento, CA",2,34,2,5.0,6/22/2011,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. The waiters/waitresses are very friendly. Their food is awesome. I think, their price is awesome for the amount of good they give. I find this place cheaper then apple bee's and chili's. BJ's is an amazing place with a wonderful atmosphere."
sofia m.,"Sacramento, CA",1,12,,4.0,4/9/2011,"The food and service is great! I really liked their food, but it was so loud, and it was pricey.  Overall good food, but it was expensive and I had to yell at my group so that they could hear me."
T S.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",3,62,,4.0,9/22/2012,"I love Bj's Restaurants! I have been to the one in Newport Beach, CA, West Covina, CA, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, Natomas, CA, and this location. Their pizza is delish! I love the deep dish style of Chicago style pizza. My favorite lately has been their buffalo chicken pizza. Before that, it was the one with Alfredo sauce.  Both are so good! And of course, you have to have a pizooke for desert... yummy! The 2 for $20 deal they have every so often is great! It makes for a perfect cheap date night with my man the nights we need a little one on one time away from the kids."
scott s.,"Sacramento, CA",29,56,8,4.0,9/1/2012,"had a nice lunch,new item chicken-mango salad.chic done perfect,seasoned well,just a nice lunch with good service,my 4th visit."
Dana C.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",86,20,,2.0,9/25/2011,"This place is just OK.  Service when it first opened was very slow.  We were lucky to get a drink every hour.  They have gotten better over the past few months.  Once when I went there I asked for outdoor seating.  They said ""why yes, we have a table right there (she showed us the table), let us clean it up"".  I sat there and waited about 2 minutes and they seated us.  But not at the table she showed us at a much smaller table because 2 girls came up and took our table and they didn't want to tell them it was taken for someone else.  So she shoved 3 of us with a table for 1 or 2 in the middle of the aisle, versus telling these young ladies that the table was already taken, but offer then the smaller table which would have been more appropriate.   Now it's the laughing joke, that you better run and grab the table before someone else sits down cause the Hostesses don't have any backbone to provide ""good customer service""."
M W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,64,95,1.0,5/1/2011,"We had the luck of coming to this restaurant 1 week after it opened.  They didn't have their logistical process down and so we -their beta testing paying patrons had to suffer.  We came in and it took 15 minutes to get a waiter.  We received our menus and waited an additional 15 minutes to place our orders.  We then waited FORTY FIVE MINUTES for our meals.  We finally flagged down the waitress who ran to check on our meals and then brought out two of our three dishes.  Our two dishes had been forgotten under the heat lamp so they were dried out, the only edible pasta from my dish was the pasta that was under the sauce, all the pasta that was on the outskirts of the plate was hardened from the heat lamps.  The manager came out to apologize and told us they were new and working out the kinds.  He informed us our third dish would be out shortly and it would be on the house.  Twenty minutes pass and voila our their pasta dish magically appears.  Here's the kicker - it was completely tasteless, no sauce was added!  The noodles tasted like plain olive oil.  The manager came back and apologized for the fluke dish and let my friend choose yet another item to order.  He recommended the deep dish pizza - at this point my friend was starving two hours had passed and he didn't care so he went with the pizza. The pizza was out in 15 minutes, the manager rushed it over to us and personally served it.  He sat and ate his meal and we watched him since we had already finished our two dishes 30 minutes earlier.  The last and final nail in the coffin was when our bill arrived it was wrong, they had charged us for the tasteless pasta and the pizza when neither was suppose to be on the bill.  The manager came out for a fourth time and apologized and fixed it.   There are a lot of Bj's out there, before one opens they should send trained staff and a trained manager to nail down the logistical and strategic processes before opening... this restaurant failed miserable at both.   I'd recommend going to Cheesecake they are right across the parking lot, have a great menu and they offer bread appetizers while you wait for your food to arrive."
Paru V.,"Sacramento, CA",3,8,,4.0,12/3/2012,This is my first time there. I am no fan of pizza but my friend compelled me that I should give a try there. I got a pizza and a stuffed mushroom. It was the yummiest lunch I ever had.  Staff were super friendly. I should say if I wanna have pizza I will definitely come here.
Ben W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/16/2011,"I love bj's, but unfortunately this is the only one near me. I was so eager to come here because it just newly opened. I was seated by a very friendly waitress who seated me at the corner of the restaurant and forgot about me! I tried to flag down any worker in sight, but nobody could see me from where I was sitting! I tried to be patient and wait For a while. I eventually got up and left and drove to the bj's in Natoma which was a lot better! I won't stop eating at bj's, but I definitely won't come back to this one."
Agent G.,"San Francisco, CA",3,42,43,3.0,4/4/2012,"I've always heard good things about this place, but the food never tasted anything near spectacular for me. I had the pizza once (heard good reviews), the appetizer tray, the famous Pizookie (overly sweet, soggy cookie), and a couple other dishes. The only thing I liked were the Kamikaze's I had there for my 25th birthday, they were great! You can't really mess up vodka, though.."
Kristine D.,"Fairfield, CA",61,340,159,5.0,10/14/2011,good food. i ordered the flatbread pizza and fried artichokes. they were really good! and so was the calamari! the drinks were great also! the berry cider and the peach mixed drink was stellar! i would definitely go here again and the waiter was super funny and had such good service all around!!! the best BJ's i've been to in a while!!!
Theane B.,"Sacramento, CA",4,19,,4.0,2/18/2012,great gluten free pizza and friendly staff
Britt W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/27/2011,"I went to BJ's a few weeks ago with a friend. I ordered soup and salad and she ordered an appetizer and salad. My soup and salad came up 5 minutes later. I tried signaling the wait staff but they all seemed to busy to notice. I may be in my younger 20s but that doesn't give you an excuse to ignore a customer. I am a server myself at a restaurant and I give full attention to every table I serve. My friend told me to go ahead and eat my food before it got cold. I was now finished with my food and we were going on 20 minutes still waiting for her appetizer. It finally came out with her entree salad as well. When our waitress a younger blonde girl came to our table to deliver her food i kindly told her that i received my meal 20 minutes ago and she is just now getting her food. She told me ""Well thats what happens when you order soup and salad at dinner, its a lunch item."" I told her that the soup and salad is on her dinner menu as well and she just said ""I had to write it on the ticket during dinner time so it wouldn't come up early."" She walked away after that and I sat and pondered why she didn't tell the cooks to hold off on the soup and salad as an entree then..This wasn't my fault but she had turned it around to be. If someone orders an appetizer make sure that comes out before the meals thats the whole point. There was no apology no compensation and this will be the last time I go to that BJ's."
Jan B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,31,,2.0,5/21/2012,"If you like tough, stringy chicken and a few other things on the plate with about a cup full of salt then BJ's balsamic chicken is the dish for you!"
