Jason T.,"Stockton, CA",63,9,,2.0,5/14/2012,"Very slow service and not very good at remembering little requests such as extra plate, sauce, refills"
Ray G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,4.0,6/7/2012,"Came to BJ's while i was shopping at the mall. Love having one here now. The Pizza is my favorite. Service was great, everyone was very friendly. I Didn't have to wait at all to be seated that the food came out very quick. I will definitely be coming back!!"
Sheena E.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",442,371,409,3.0,7/20/2011,"As of right now its 3 stars....that may change.  Our first time here was after working a long day at the fair and we wanted something yummy!  We ordered the calamari and a veggie pizza.  The calamari took forever!!  So long in fact that it came out RIGHT before our pizza.  It was cold and really dry...we had to send it back, then came our pizza, which was a small and they said 6 pieces, the pieces were tiny!  Then they brought the new calamari which was much better.  They ended up taking it off our bill which was nice of them.  We went a second time and sat in the bar area for happy hour, we got individual pizza's which were really good actually!  Much better then sharing a small and since they were half off we got them for about $5 each so it was cheaper then a small!  We also got the avocado egg rolls that time and I remember those being much better then what we got, the sauce was way too sweet and the egg rolls were way too greasy.  So far its just an ok, 3 stars."
Trevor S.,"Sacramento, CA",125,140,8,4.0,4/28/2011,"it's BJ's... just at Arden now. parking sucks, but it's at a mall so that's to be expected."
Amber O.,"Sacramento, CA",0,17,3,4.0,4/29/2011,"Went to BJ's last Friday for for drinks and appetizers around 8ish.  The place was very busy and there would have been a 20 minute wait, but we opted to sit outside.  Great decision!  There were overhead heaters that provided plenty of warmth.  We orders Martini's and they were great along with two appetizers.  We spent about $50 all together with tip, but it was well worth it.  I recommend BJ's for a casual night out anytime."
Vance H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,4.0,6/30/2011,Eat here last week. It different from other bj I been too.  Love the beer selection and menu choice. Good food good service. Be back.
Devin M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,6,,1.0,9/14/2011,So its a friday night and I figure that I would come to the BJ in arden.  I normally frequent the Laguna one which has exceptional food and great beers.  My friend and I ordered a beer...The beer came out...not cold and not quite warm.  I honestly have not been served a beer that wasn't cold enough before.  We let the server know who was more than willing to help.  She tried to help get us different beers but it still came out like barely chilled beer.  She explained to us about the tap and the system.  On top of that our order came out wrong...We ended up waiting again for our appetizer.  We ordered the special deal of pizza with pazookie and soup and salad for a deal.   The soup was lukewarm.  I figure you know what the pizza should be better...wrong again.  It ends up being as a warm pizza also...so then our deserts come out...guess what same thing.  It wasn't hot but its not the quality of BJ that I have experienced.  Either the management is not doing their job or the kitchen staff needs help.  maybe the beer filtration system needs an upgrade.  I'm not sure but this type of service from BJ is unacceptable.  I am not coming back to this BJ.
Brian R.,"Beaverton, OR",2,18,,1.0,5/1/2011,"Been here before with a smaller party and had no problems. Last night (I know it was a Saturday...) tried to use their call ahead reservation system and was told it was for parties of 6 or smaller. We had 6 and a 2 year old. Showed up at 6:15 and were told it would be about an hour wait. We thought ""That's just what they tell people so they don't get angry for waiting 30 minutes."" At 7:15 the two year old was offered crackers. At 7:45 my diabetic Mother was offered juice. At 7:50 ""Just a few more minutes while they clean up the table that just left."" I look, it's already clean, and seems to have been for a few minutes already. 8:00, we're seated. By the way, two managers have been circling the hostess station the whole time, not a single word or acknowledgement. Appitizers and drinks were brought out fast (1 star), but my Dad's food was left in the back for about 10 minutes while waited (not wanting to be rude to him). The server was notified of this and brought it right out, as if had just been sitting there and forgotten. The food? Eh. Same restaurant-in-a-mall food you would expect. Left after the mall was closed at almost 9:30, still without a word from a manager. I understand they're busy, but all restaurants are busy on Saturday night. Won't be going back, ever."
Sky P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,14,,2.0,1/16/2012,"While this place definitely has good food, they are not winners when it comes to service with a smile.  I went in to talk to the manager about having a large group in to celebrate the holidays with my family.  It might seem strange, but we usually get a group together and go out to eat so that we can all enjoy our time together, not be stressing about cooking and cleaning.  This group would have been for 30ish people on a Tuesday night.  The Manager rudely looked at me and said we are all booked up before he even let me tell him the date or time.  Unless he is a mind reader, I don't know how he could have predicted what I was going to say.  I would have been fine with the answer if he had at-least checked the reservations, but to not even let me tell him the information was just rude and leaves me wondering if it was more a case of him not wanting the extra work, or simply not wanting my business.  The hostesses were no joke, even laughing while he was dismissing me.  Beware of this place, they may have good food, but the quality of the food does not make up for an atmosphere of rude service."
