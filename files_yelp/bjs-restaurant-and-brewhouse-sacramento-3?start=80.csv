West HR Kevin A.,"Sacramento, CA",5,8,,4.0,4/15/2017,the best restaurant to enjoy all kinds of dessert such as food and the sacramento . Sometimes you need to wait but you have a good reason to be happy with the service and food
Karen K.,"Crystal City, Arlington, VA",27,7,5,4.0,8/29/2017,Yummy cheese dip with chips. I had the personal tomato and cheese pizza ... crust was a little thick. I also had the cucumber and mint water refreshing on a sizzling day!
D B.,"Mather, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/9/2017,"The ahi poke, at this BJ's specifically, is the BEST!!  It's my favorite item to have there, though so much of their food is good, and every time I go to this restaurant I have it.  You would think it would be the same at every BJ's but by FAR the quality of the ahi at this location beats any other.  It is never marbled and always fresh.  Thank you for taking this dish seriously and for being so consistently fantastic!!!"
Kory R.,"Fairfield, CA",318,343,1005,1.0,5/2/2016,"I stopped in on Sunday and got the Ahi Tuba Salad and BF got the Mahi Mahi and Shrimp. Service was wonderful, food was delicious UNTIL a few hours later when food poisoning symptoms hit me.. We figured out where it came from because BF didn't eat any of my salad and we ate our normal food prior to BJ's.. I will never be returning to this establishment again. **UPDATE** My doctor recommended that I call this establishment and let them know about what it happened. I spoke to the manager Carla who was very sympathetic and caring. She offered us a full refund of our meal via a gift card and advised that she would let HR know as well. Kudos to them for doing this as they could have looked the other way. We won't be returning to this BJ's but we will try a different location."
Shavonne T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,15,10,1.0,6/8/2017,My fiancé and I have ate here twice. Each time the customer service was horrible. I asked for no onions and I got a cold burger loaded with onions. We had to ask for silverware and refills on our drinks.  I did speak with the manager about my burger and he offered to get me a fresh one and to take it off of the tab. That was the only good thing about our experience ‍
Douglas J.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,3,1,1.0,11/7/2016,"I went to this restaurant on Tuesday Nov 1 2016. My experience was terrible. The hostess was rude & had zero personality. She seemed upset that I asked for a table instead of a booth. She told me the wait would be 10 minutes. After almost 25 minutes of waiting and seeing people who came after myself & my dinner guest get seated before us. I asked her if she had forgotten us. She said we had to wait because we requested a table. When we finally got seated the waitress came after several minutes and took our order. It wasn't unusually busy & I noticed several empty tables. I ordered a bacon burger & with BBQ sauce on the side & a dinner salad. The salad came with out an issue. A gentleman (not our waitress) brought our entrees to the table. I noticed immediately that my burger was brought to me without the French fries that should have accompanied it. The gentleman said that they noticed I had an onion allergy. They informed me that they fry their French fries in the same oil as their onion rings and were concerned for my allergy. I appreciated that but asked him why they didn't ask me sooner? Why not ask me before they cooked my burger. I informed him that I wouldn't have an issue with the fries & he went back to the kitchen to have them made. So there I sat with my burger without the BBQ sauce I had requested. I waited for our waitress so I could get the BBQ sauce, but she didn't come. My friend began to eat because I didn't want his food to get cold like my burger was becoming! When our waitress finally brought the BBQ sauce along with my fries I discovered my fries were STONE COLD!!!  Very upsetting. They offered to re cook my food, but my friend was almost done eating! They offered to bring me dessert. Why would I want dessert when I haven't eaten dinner. I payed for my salad & my friends meal. We left! I was hungry & very much disappointed in my experience. I doubt I'll ever go to a BJ's restaurant again!!!!! Sincerely  Douglas"
Ezekiel Highwind ..,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,Do yourself a favor and dont make reservations here i was guaranteed a call ahead reservation and when I got there they gave it away to a another party and I was early in arriving to my reserved time. I found it unprofessional!  I ate at this location before and there service was great but Im giving them the 1 star for the lack of communication for making reservations
Gretchen Q.,"Milpitas, CA",185,193,24,2.0,4/9/2016,"I like the food, albeit a bit salty (basically everything on their menu).  I love the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts. This appetizer came out pretty fast. Also yummy!  I usually order the Spinach stuffed mushrooms. Their mushrooms used to be soooo big, but now it's small-sized mushrooms. It was also pretty salty compared to the last time I had it. Clam chowder was also very salty.  My chicken lettuce wraps weren't that bad. It was a little salty but the lettuce balanced the flavor out. The chicken was good too. The only thing that wasn't salty was the Strawberry Lemonade hah. We surprisingly had a great service from our last visit."
Faith R.,"Carmichael, CA",13,22,13,5.0,5/22/2017,Excellent place for dinner and awesome service.  The server was helpful in assisting me in my entrée. I had the ribs and they were great.
an l.,"San Jose, CA",88,188,282,3.0,10/25/2016,"Dropped in for lunch as it was a convenient location in the mall. I really wanted to eat at the Nordstrom cafe(my fave) but it was prime time lunch hour and the wait was a bit long.  After spending all my money on shoes and clothes I didn't need, I got hungry and to my surprise, absolutely no wait at BJs. Since it was raining, I wanted the chicken tortilla soup. Being that I was also running errands all day, I figured I also needed some carbs in me so I ordered a lunch size California flatbread pizza. My friend ordered the half California club sandwich and the tortilla soup also. I wasn't impressed but the size of his ""lunch size"" California club. The menu said half of the regular size... he got one wedge. He also asked for wedge fries and got shoe string fries.  The server that brought our food out dropped it and left, so we couldn't tell her the fries were wrong. Our waitress never checked on us either so we just ate what we had. The chicken tortilla soup didn't taste as good as the BJs in Elk Grove. This one was a lot thicker and one small cube of avocado. The server never came to check on us... only when we asked for the bill. Considering more than half the tables were empty at the bar where we sat, I would expect better service.  I'm going to stick with Nordstrom cafe next time for better service."
Jimmy Z.,"Sandy, OR",1,4,,5.0,3/10/2017,"Absolutely the best. My friend and I decided to grab something to eat and decided on BJ's. Not only were the staff friendly but the food came out fast and was delicious. She ordered their Caesar salad with dressing on the side and I ordered the flatbread pizza. (Watching my carbs, however the beer didn't help.) I would definitely come here again. Highly Recommended!"
Patrick H.,"Sacramento, CA",39,16,6,4.0,2/24/2017,"Bj's is one of my go 2's for sure, always satisfied when i leave. Great place to bring my kids everyone loves those darn bazookies. I try and make sure and call ahead so i dont have to wait to be seated they can get pretty busy."
Ina S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,178,2,5.0,5/11/2017,"Great baby back ribs, two sides a salad and a pizookie, my new place for this wonderful meal deal on Thursday's, service was fantastic : D"
Charlie J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,31,4,5.0,7/22/2017,"Had the, I think it was called, the midnight special burger. With Chile verde and a fried egg. Omg soo good. Loved the food, scenery, and service!!"
Zaira R.,"Sacramento, CA",137,42,35,3.0,12/12/2016,"I have been to this location several times since it opened.  Each and every time I would say the service and food has been good but not great. There is usually a pretty long wait time. It's a good idea to try to call ahead or to plan on waiting for at least 20 minutes. It is a very convenient location, especially when you don't feel like eating junk at the mall.  Last night I ordered the spicy chicken soba noodles and they were actually really good. The only downside was the portion they served me was so small that I was still hungry after (which usually never happens). My husband ordered the sirloin steak and said that he has had much better steak at other restaurants and he would not say it was worth the money.  Overall, it is a comfortable and good dining experience."
Darci K.,"Sacramento, CA",740,264,3054,3.0,4/21/2015,"If you're going to do happy hour, have the mini pizza.  It's worth the $6.00 you can choose any of the pizza toppings you want ! The other 'tizers are sparse and not meant to fill a toddlers tummy.   The wait staff wasn't overly happy. Hence the three stars, and the avocado egg rolls tasted like regurgitated food."
Elijah G.,"Valley Oak, Stockton, CA",109,1,2,1.0,7/27/2017,"Bad service, the waitress was bad. They brought out our food and took longer then we expected. They were rude and disrespectful. Especially the lady at the front desk. Overall really bad service. I won't be returning"
Mindy F.,"Sacramento, CA",119,23,13,5.0,7/19/2017,"Went for lunch and enjoyed the bottomless soup and salad. The caprese salad is amazing. We got the portabella burger, sub patty for extra bella. Delicious, enjoyed a $4 brew on the Wednesday special. Would have ended with a pizookie, but we were stuffed. Adam was a fabulous server."
Fabian Z.,"Sacramento, CA",36,19,,2.0,7/17/2017,"Our service was super slow even though it was not even a busy hour of day business wise. Everyone in my group had an issue with thier order. My pizza was burnt and Arnold palmer was terrible. If you really want bjs, I suggest going to the natomas location."
Marcella S.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,29,11,5.0,7/1/2017,"Amazing staff! I left my bank card by mistake obviously! The staff kept my card, it was not used. I have lost my card before and woke up to nothing left in my account except overdraft fees. So you have no idea how appreciative I was! On our visit we had a waitress training and her trainer was amazing! The food was delicious as usual ! Thank you for having an amazing and honest staff!"
