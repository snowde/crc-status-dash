Anthony N.,"Sacramento, CA",415,57,584,5.0,12/26/2017,"This review is solely for our waitress we had encountered on Christmas Eve. I am big on customer service, so when I experience amazing customer service I love to give kudos, in hopes of  that employee receiving some recognition.  On Christmas Eve my family and I decided to go have some dinner and drinks, upon being seated we were greeted by our waitress Amelia. (Name may be misspelled). She was very approachable, sweet and genuine. She was very attentive to us and even chimed up with some conversation as well as suggestions. A couple people's food at our tables came way after the rest of us, maybe they forgot about us, but Amelia was apologetic and even comp us on some of our meals. Throughout the entire night she was very attentive, always coming by and seeing how we were doing. I greatly appreciate that type of service. I normally sit at the bar when I visit, but next time I may try and get one of her tables again. Hey, doesn't hurt she's a cute girl as well. Lol. But in all seriousness, she represented Bjs well that night, so hopefully her management team reads this and can give her some kudos as well!"
Tami K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,23,2,1.0,12/4/2017,This place has gone downhill!  We used to love going here but I think we probably won't go anymore.  The last straw was this past Saturday.  We had family over and my husband wasn't feeling well so I recommend take out from BJs.  I had ordered the bison burger and upgraded my fries to sweet potato. The burger was bland (I get bison at other places so I know what a good one should taste like) and all the fries were pretty much burnt.  Glad I paid extra for burnt fries.  Someone ordered the mushroom burger and there were so many she took some off.  My husband ordered the ziti which he normally loves but he said it was like it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  Not sure if they have new cooks or management but this place is bad. It's a shame as there isn't a lot of options in Natomas.
Bad S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,95,8,1.0,11/28/2017,"Sadly I have learned to have lower expectations when I visit Bjs. Tonight was no exception. The notable moment was when my wife brought to my attention that her Maui tacos tasted rotten. At first I dismissed her complaints. I grabbed a big piece of fish out of her taco and took a big wiff..ugggghh! Spoiled fish! We complained to server then I proceeded to go to the restroom to wash my stinky hand. Scrubbed deep with soap. Manager took responsibility and offered soup or whatever we may want. My wife, kinda ill after eating a bite of rotten fish, said maybe a soup.  Bill came, thanks for the 6.99 soup! Way to make it up... And my hand still stinks like decaying fish!"
Jae R.,"Sacramento, CA",113,46,413,3.0,9/1/2017,"Been here countless times pizza is usually good as are the tacos They have decent beers I don't care for their pastas salads pretty good When not too busy can count on decent service that was not tonight Ordered hamburger server said 'yes cheeseburger' so we clarified Then burger arrived with cheese AND bacon on it greasy not tasty Half way through burger when we were offered ketchup we did not ask for Restaurant is big also clean, nice, and lofty often a bit loud Not bad for a meal especially with children or with bigger group Crowd pleasing options most can find something they like from large selection"
Veronica S.,"Sacramento, CA",132,279,415,4.0,9/16/2017,"Such a great place for happy hour! Myself and a friend decided to come here after work one day and loved it. Their cider is delicious, I just wish they sold it to go :(  We ordered 2 beers each, avocado egg rolls, the spinach dip and queso and ended up paying around $16 each total. Really great deal. Their happy hour is also goes later than most places."
William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1740,1257,9441,4.0,9/8/2017,"For three visits in a row so far as of 9/1/2017, this BJ's at North Natomas takes the cake perfectly for serving their finest quality eatable foods and impressive drinks every day and night no matter what the special occasion is! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most BJ's has across America, and for this Natomas location didn't dissapoints! Much spacious and roomy unlike the Elk Grove and Arden/Arcade location has, and it's averagely busy depending on the environment during lunch or dinner. The employees here are doing an alright job for making the customers like me a fine service. I wish this service needs to be more friendly to the customers next time despite the busiest environment. As a result for me, no cons. Now onto the food! During my lunch break, I usually ordered one of my favorite dishes from BJ's called, ""Lemon Thyme Chicken."" As I ate it, it tasted very good although it was kinda nearly salty for my tastebuds. The cause for being close salty is the brussel sprouts. I'm sure they should reduce the salt content for the vegetable sides of the Lemon Thyme Chicken. The rest of them were also tasted amazing! The chicken breast did cooked perfectly without being too harden and nearly raw. Not a bad meal! There's plenty of parking spaces available, so you can park anywhere you want near or far. In the end, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse at North Natomas is a fine, remarkable national casual restaurant that I've ever visited. A fine visit indeed. My rating: 4 solid stars."
Jasmine H.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,4,3,3.0,12/22/2017,"Two stars for take out! An extra for getting the food out within ordering 40 min before closing. Usually BJs is pretty decent, today was our first and last time ordering takeout. I was craving the Thursday special despite having a full seafood meal a few hours before. We got a full rack of ribs (the ribs itself was great) special. My favorite- mozzarella and tomato salad had seen better days.... IT DIDN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE, my favorite part :(.   The potato fully loaded was subpar, but how could you mess up a potato. The broccoli... I didn't understand I usually LOVE ordering bjs broccoli for every meal, but this just didn't cut it, it tasted of mush. Now onto my macadamia pizookie..... hard as a rock! I enjoyed my ice cream though :) Nonetheless, I won't be ordering out but it was worth a try."
Vickie W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,26,33,4.0,10/8/2017,"A late dinner to BJ's never disappoints. We were celebrating two years cancer free for me.  We started with the root beer ribs. My only complaint was there were not enough, just kidding we each ate three along with a spicy coleslaw. My husband ordered the seared ahi salad and remarked it was the best prepared although he has enjoyed it before. I chose the parmesan crusted chicken with steamed broccoli and white cheddar mashed potatoes. On the side wad a caprese salad. I was not disappointed. We topped it of with the strawberry beignet. Makayla was a fantastic server checking back with us several times to see if we were pleased with our choices and fill our drinks."
Hinna A.,"San Francisco, CA",3,25,1,1.0,11/28/2017,"Wow. What a horrible night we had last night. Our party of 5 walked in around 10:23pm last night, with two kids (under two). Their was probably around 10 people in the whole place. Placed our order and waited 20-30 mins before our food finally showed up.  1.Salad was missing dressing, croutons. 2.Fries Stale. 3. Avacado rolls soggy and salty. 4.jalapeno burger came with NO SAUCE. No mayo, menu clearely states it comes with Chiptole mayo.. mine was plain. No jalapenos as requested, no fried onion strings as requested. Asked for it to be re-made, manager comes over to apologize and offers to comp the burger. Well, guess what?!?! we had to wait over 38 mins for a new one. Are you kidding me? unprofessional half assed management with shitty food. Honestly, with a 8 to 1 staff to customer ratio, why did it take almost 2 hrs to make a burger correctly? I wish this location would get its shit together."
S M.,"Rocklin, CA",71,6,2,3.0,1/9/2018,"So this is the first time I've ordered curb side from bj's which is a great service when I have a kid that I don't want to bring into a restaurant while tired and it's raining. BUT After being unable to find the curb side spot to park, I called the restaurant and she said ""you see the trash can behind and to the side of the restaurant ya you're supposed to park there"" umm ok all I saw was handicap parking she said ya it's on the other side of that. Well shit why do you guys hide the pick up spot? Why not just put it in front of the restaurant or at least have a big sign not one screwed to a hand rail. That's just silly. Otherwise I love bjs the waiter that came out was very nice just thought they could improve their curb side spot so 4 stars for today's visit."
Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1433,849,4285,3.0,1/17/2017,"The only thing consistent 'bout the chain of BJ restaurants' is the menu, other than that customer service is either good or bad- nothing in between.  The fambam decided to stop here after our long drive from Reno. After sitting in a car for almost 4 hours, our starving bellies needed food- STAT! Thankfully we were seated right away and a plus is that they were playing the Warriors Game on a tv nearby (funny to see, we were the only table cheering when GSW scored, LOL).  Our server, Robert showed up to take our drink orders shortly thereafter. If you're looking for the a friendly, personable server - then Robert may NOT be the server for you. We weren't expecting a bubbly personality, but at least a smile. He comes off cold, almost with an attitude like he doesn't want to be at work. Weird.  Our food orders were placed then the wait game began. After watching almost 2 full quaternary of basketball, it started to dawn on us that the food was taking FORever. One of the ""managers"" finally came out to inform us that there was an issue that has since then been resolved and our food will be out shortly. A few minutes later my food along with my 'rents food came out, yet my hubby's food was still MIA. After what felt like 10 minutes from the initial manager, a second manager came out to inform us my hubby's food will be comped and will be out shortly. The wait was ridiculous.  In regards to the food, the temperature could have been warmer but at that point we just wanted to eat then get the heck outta there. The lemon thyme chicken was good; it came with brown rice and veggies. The lemon pepper chicken wings were good, with a nice crunch. My mom's penne shrimp dish was okay, could have used more sauce - but the garlic knot was good. My hubby's salmon was overcooked, but was served with tasty quinoa.  In conclusion, if we're ever in the area driving back from Reno to the Bay - we will just stop at In&Out. That was our original choice for dinner, and plus I can't remember the last time I had a ""bad"" In&Out burger..."
Keyara C.,"Anaheim, CA",55,4,6,5.0,12/3/2017,The bartender I had last night should be manager. She made sure we were taken care of and made my drinks perfect. Usually people make them with too much alcohol but the drinks were perfect!!!! I had a strawberry splash and one other drink!! But it was worth every penny!!!
Sally D.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,3,1,4.0,12/30/2017,I came here for dessert! I got the Oreo dessert! It was so good!! Service was took kind of long but it was kind of worth it! Lol
Jenelle J.,"Rocklin, CA",170,31,7,5.0,10/31/2017,"My son and I go here several times a week after soccer practice or for brunch, and it doesn't matter what time we go, how busy it is, etc. the wait staff is always extremely helpful, very attentive and the food is always amazing! There's a reason we keep going back to this place.   I love the appetizers (try the sriracha brussel sprouts, so good!), the pizza is really good and one of my favorites are the grilled mahi mahi tacos!  My son and I also really enjoy the pizzookie, and the option to order one with half and half flavors makes it easier to share!  Thanks to Melissa A. for always taking good care of us!"
Barry G.,"Sacramento, CA",6,50,3,1.0,10/28/2017,"Ordered food for pickup. Apparantly they forgot to send the order to the kitchen??? Took a whole hour after showing up for the food to be ready! This is absolutely ridiculous.  The chicken sandwich which was supposed to have lettuce, tomato and honey mustard contained.... nothing. Literally just chicken and bread. The chicken was cold and was so tough like cold rubber. Absolutely dusgusting. I will NEVER order food from here agin."
Grant B.,"Roseville, CA",3,66,156,4.0,10/22/2017,"Typical Bj's. Good bar food, friendly service. Pricing is kinda high but nothing to outrageous. Fun spot to watch the games."
Marcus-Alex G.,"Davis, CA",175,56,9,4.0,9/18/2017,"I've never had a bad experience here, we were seated immediately, got our food out pretty fast, and the staff was nice and friendly. I love the Bjs back in my home town, and this one was just as good, the drinks are awesome, but I'd say my favorite part about Bjs, are the appetizers. The cous cous mac and cheese, and the roasted beats, and the wings, and pizza are amazing, the dinners are good nothing amazing, but the appetizers and drinks are a must if you go."
Gabriela H.,"San Francisco, CA",21,146,15,3.0,11/26/2017,I had the brew burger add blue cheese. The burns were coded in grease. So much so I couldn't eat them. There was an amazing crispy cheese layer on the bun I was able to salvage.
Nicey S.,"Sacramento, CA",7,31,2,1.0,12/3/2017,My piece of came out the wrong order twice then when my order was brought out my food was cold spoke to my waiter and then he disappeared I was so upset I spent about $50 on Pizza I got up and left the manager never came to see me at my table like I asked my waitress I don't remember her name
Dan M.,"Los Banos, CA",60,47,123,2.0,7/12/2017,The waiter was pleasant but didn't introduce himself  you could just tell he wasn't thrilled to be working Friday afternoon...especially after our group only ordered water. The quinoa salad was new item on the menu so I decided to try something fresh and new...needless to say I should have had my old reliable...the shrimp on the quinoa where drenched in lemon so the entire dish tasted like a Lemmon ....wasn't impressed! My son had the chicken sandwich and said it was great...my brother had the flat bread pizza and he said it was average... with the below average service and the lemon shrimp....BJ....deserve a 2!  I wouldn't go back but my wife and kids like the place...it does have a good selection of beer...but I don drink beer.....igofish2day out!
Amir A.,"Sacramento, CA",43,5,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Came here for dinner with my family, sister got a burger and they messed it up, while everyone else got there food. We asked for it to be replaced, they said ok, and everyone had finished their entire meal and it shows up a whole 45 minutes later. Manager apologizes and offers a pizooki, it's been 45 minutes still no burger and no dessert.  Wish they would get their act together, kind of ruined the entire dinner experience.  Please be advised."
Jeff B.,"Cocoa Beach, FL",0,37,2,4.0,11/27/2017,Always like BJ's and have been to many locations coast to coast. This one keeps the franchise and is no different than the others. Food is good and the staff was friendly. The only complaint I have with BJ's is not enough IPA options.
Terryann T.,"Sacramento, CA",38,71,70,4.0,9/14/2016,"This is an updated review, after 2 reviews. I had a couple of bad visits and after addressing these with the manager, Isaac, we came back again the other night for a family dinner. They were just starting to get busy and so service was slower but it could have been worse. My uncle was disappointed that they couldn't get the Warriors game lol but again no problem.  We got our drinks and ordered our food. Unfortunately there was a special on the large pizzas and they had run out so my brother and his wife were going to share a medium pizza instead. Our appetizers came out and luckily we shared those because there was an issue with the pizza, as apparently someone had forgotten to put in the order.  I have to admire the way that our server, Robert, delivered that bit of bad news. The manager also came by and apologized and offered them (my bro and his wife) some salads as the pizza was still being made. They accepted his offer and my mom ended up sharing her pizza with them. They got their pizza for free because it was so late and they opted to get it to go.  I'm definitely glad we came back again. It wasn't without its hiccups but it was not a horrible experience and we'll be back."
Sabrina V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,36,6,1.0,9/2/2017,"Pretty crappy BJ's. Arrived at 7pm and there was water all over the floor. I almost slipped twice, as I am in heels. There was no wet floor sign but the employees knew about it as they warned me not to slip in the water. Left BJ's at 845pm and the same water puddle was there. Untouched with no wet floor sign. And yes, I almost slipped again. I saw my waiter 2 times this night. Once was to order and the second time was to pick up my check. I wanted to order more drinks and asked the person who brought our food over if I can order drinks since my waiter was no where to be found. He said he'd go find out waiter but that never happened. Moral of the story? Go somewhere else."
Kristina T.,"Sacramento, CA",74,209,673,4.0,12/26/2016,"Early on during the week, my girlfriends and I decided on doing a get together dinner at BJs on a Friday. Being occupied with Christmas two days away, it did not occur to me that I was having dinner during one of the busiest nights, Friday. Though there were plenty of parking available pulling into the lot you would not know there were so many people waiting to be seated inside. Luckily, some of my friends arrived before me and were able to add our names to the list. Thank goodness the wait wasn't dreadful because it was packed and no where to sit; standing room only. Lol. Btw, waiting outside wasn't an option because it was freezing! Not more than 15 minutes later our party was seated.  Our waiter's name was Sergio. He was great, very approachable and funny. He was also prompt on getting things we asked for too, I wish all servers can be efficient like him. Anyways, we started off by ordering some alcoholic beverages because sometimes the Holidays can be rough. My drink choice was the Piranha Pale Ale which was good being that I'm not a drinker. Along side our drinks we had avocado egg rolls, siracha brussel sprouts and the calamari for appetizers. The egg rolls were good but too spicy for my liking and surprisingly the brussel sprouts were really good. For the main entree I had the chicken alfredo. When I ordered my meal I did tell Sergio that I wanted extra sauce but when my dish arrived at the table, it was still dry. I had to ask for more sauce and by that time I was over my meal. So I packed it to go and my kids enjoyed it. Haha. Like any other BJs, I can't leave without eating a pazookie! Lol. For the 5 of us, we ordered the party platter pazookie which is around $22. It was definitely cheaper than getting individual pazookies @ $7-8ea. We were able to choose up to 4 flavors; Oreo, macadamia, salted caramel and good ole chocolate chip. I could do without the salted caramel and Oreo though, it's way too sweet. When given our check Sergio was able to split it up by meals for us which was nice and effortless to pay and tip."
Amanda S.,"West Sacramento, CA",92,9,3,5.0,11/27/2017,I get a benya every time This did makes me happy. Irish rootbeer and a burger for dinner just makesure toy got some time they aren't always fast
Chester Y.,"Sacramento, CA",14,2,,2.0,11/11/2017,"Wait staff was not attentive and failed to order food in a timely manner. One hour is too long for sub par food at high prices. Avoid this place evenings, and weekends, service is poor. Manager said sorry we were really busy."
Angela S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,1,1.0,12/24/2017,This place is like a Denny's. Service is very poor and staff is rude. We went here for a work function and I was embarrassed we chose this place. Orders wrong and food gross.
Lsxo S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,92,61,1.0,11/16/2017,"Very unhappy with the experience I had. The service was okay. The food was just horrible. I ordered the top sirloin, a 8 0z steak. With a baked potato and broccoli. I ordered it Med well. When they brought my food to the table, it literly only had 3 pieces of hard broccoli. The steak was pretty much raw. I asked for more fire on the steak and they brought my steak back super burnt. So I just said forget it.. I will just take it home for my dogs to eat. The bill was $100 for 3 people. Very unsatisfied with the food there. I won't be back here. Don't waste your money at this place."
Lily C.,"Sacramento, CA",10,20,80,2.0,5/24/2017,Food was priced high and the service was slow. 3 hours to get out.   Wings were ok but when you're hungry everything looks good
Nanise N.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",51,3,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Tonight I experienced nonexistent customer service. We had a party of three, one being a toddler, when we arrived there were two parties ahead of us. The hostess took my name and said it would be about 10 mins, we went in at 10pm. It was a little busy, but all the other parties waiting were large. I figured this was the reason for only a 10 min wait because we were a small group. Between 10 and 10:30pm I watched 4 different groups be seated, 3 of which were groups of 3 who had checked in with the hostess after us. Finally at 10:32pm, the hostess looked at me and says, you're still waiting, I replied, ""yes, we are"", we were seated then.  By 10:45, almost 15 mins after sitting down, not a single employee came over to greet us, bring us water, or even say someone will be right with you. NOTHING! NOT A DAMN THING. When we got up to leave a waitress turns around and says have you been helped. I told her, ""no, we're leaving."" At the hostess station I asked to speak with a manager, explained him the situation and how horrible the customer service there is. His response, ""I'm sorry, thats all I can do for you."" I see where the employees learn their skills from. I wish I got his name, I was just so mad I wouldn't be enjoying my pizookie, I will never go back! Those undercooked desserts aren't worth being completely ignored and leaving a restaurant hungry. I would give no stars if that was an option."
Alla S.,"Sacramento, CA",29,70,85,4.0,10/19/2017,"I love their pizzas! The great white  is my favorite!  I havnt tried their other food options, but I've never had any issues with our orders! If you order for pick up, they have your order ready in 10-15 minutes."
Avtar S.,"Woodland, CA",28,98,112,5.0,1/1/2017,"Great food, great atmosphere and great drinks. BJs always has something for everyone's liking. Can't go wrong with big parties."
Mannie S.,"West Sacramento, CA",4,22,4,2.0,4/18/2017,"Fire the short Mexican girl with the tattoos behind her ear. She didn't check on us for a refill my friend had to die of thirst, he even took a drink from my tea and then I died of thirst. Also when me and my friend sat down , we weren't noticed until 15 min later.  The guy in the front was amazing he deserves a raise. Also the girl at the front desk when you walk in deserves a raise. They know how to take care of customers and a high level of hospitality."
david l.,"Roseville, CA",47,22,2,2.0,12/5/2017,"I've always felt BJ's is a decent place to get some food and a beer or two. Customer service at the locations I've been to has usually been good. Not so at this location on a Monday afternoon when hardly anyone was in the joint. We headed to the bar for a beer and appetizers. The Bartender was talking to the one patron at the bar. We stood there ... and stood there ... and stood there ... for at least 7-8 minutes... less than 10 feet from the bartender. He never made eye contact or acknowledged us. He was too deep telling some story to the patron. We finally left, headed back to the host station and asked to be seated in the restaurant. There a server by the name of Michael took good care of us. Yet i still left with a bitter taste in my mouth -- and It wasn't from the BJ porter. Cmon, BJ's... , in this era of competition, you have to do better with your customer service. My two stars is liberal thanks to your server Michael."
Marcy P.,"Corona, CA",79,15,5,1.0,6/4/2017,"How I wish I would have forced my sister to read these reviews prior to going here... I'll be honest, I'm not really a fan of the food but it was my niece's graduation and she picked it so off we went.  We precalked in a reservation for 9 people and still had to wait an hour to be seated...  Once we were seated, I ordered potato skins and they came promptly with one set of silverware that I grabbed. I was lucky able to use the spoon for my skins and on my ranch.  My sister ordered wings as an appetizer and they came or shortly. I grabbed one with my fork, dipped it in the ranch and ate it. Then I grabbed a second one, took a bite and looked at it on the fork, and almost vomited, the fork was so dirty with multiple pieces of lettuce stuck to it. I took it to the counter showed the staff and a manager came out to apologize. Then they had me fill out an incident report.  In addition to that, my cousin's burger tasted like it was made out of salt.  My steak was so fatty and gross and well done I could only give it to the dog.  My little cousin who ordered of the kids meal, her mom was charged for the (included) drink.  My daughter requested an easy cheese pizza as she does not like meat (not allergic just preference). They brought extra cheese and pepperoni, we scrapped everything of and she ate the crust. The experience will not be repeated by me at that BJ's or any other because of what happened.  The cherry on the top was when one of the hostess said to me when I asked for clean silverware to replace my filthy set said, ""the fork went thru the sanitizer washer so you don't have anything to worry about."" I explained that it doesn't matter how many times you sanitizer it, if it's not clean, it's not sanitized. Edit: After I posted this review I was contacted by BJs and give a $50 e gift card. I will go back and try another location.  Edit: I went to the Laguna Beach location with just my daughter for lunch. The service was adequate as was the food. The view was awesome! I'm glad it was a free but if not, reasonably priced."
Amanda G.,"Davis, CA",3,17,1,1.0,5/8/2017,This is the most mediocre food and drink imaginable. I would go pretty much anywhere else. Smaller places with better food are all over. My company always drags us here and it is disappointing every time.
Sven R.,"Sacramento, CA",191,122,117,3.0,7/5/2017,"I've enjoyed BJ's for a long time. The beer is first rate and there's always a new seasonal offering to try frequently. From San Jose to Elk Grove to this location in Sacramento near Arco Arena (sorry, I'm old school,) the dinning experience is pretty consistent. What does vary is the service and this visit here afforded us a wonderful waitress that was fast and genuinely concerned about our needs. This isn't always the case at BJ's.  I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip. It was a healthy portion of pink meat that had a good flavor to it. This was a French Dip and thus it required dipping, right?  Into the Au Jus it went but not before I smothered the bread with all the white ""horseradish"" sauce. I love real horseradish for its flavor and spice. This had very little of either. Still, the sandwich was enjoyable. Even more enjoyable was the sweet potato fries which were few in number. Truthfully, I didn't mind since I was not in need of more calories.  Ya, BJ's is a nice place to get a really good beer and some good food along with the brew. I don't understand the draw to wait as long as 45 minutes...let alone half that, but I guess others like it more than I do."
Jatin M.,"Sacramento, CA",50,151,5,2.0,10/31/2016,"I have been to pretty much all the BJs locations in the Sacramento area and they are all consistently poor. It takes forever to get a table, then forever to get a server, then forever to get the food. Only reason I end up back at BJs once every few months is the variety of menu options they have and beer. I have to find another go-to spot.  P.S. they no longer serve santa fe rolls (one of my all time favorites there) :("
Zaheer K.,"Hayward, CA",86,11,9,1.0,11/1/2017,"This location by far has the worst service when in comes to serving their customers. After ordering our food at 6:30 pm about 10 minutes later our appetizer was out. Seemed like a great start, about 30 min later the waiter finally walked by and we had to ask her how long our food would be. She advised us 2/3 are ready and the third almost. After bringing 2 meals out another 30 min later still no third plate. We ordered a 4th dish and it came out within 10 minutes and still no 3rd dish. What really set it off is the waiter had the nerve to say that there is a large group they are catering to which is unacceptable. Your suppose to cater to first come basis not based on group size. The manager on duty Javier was very helpful after it was brought to his attention over an hour later. The one star is for his service otherwise it would be a 0 star review."
