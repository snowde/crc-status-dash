Devo S.,"Sacramento, CA",970,1012,3135,4.0,12/1/2011,"I can say that the food and service have gone up a few notches since last whence I came, and that is a GOOD thing!  Oooh, and my new favorite thing there?  Their Berry Blast cider...loved it!  I'm not a beer drinker, but I will say that I'll drink half a glass of their Blonde Ale.  But cider?  Love it, and their Berry Blast is crisp and sweet...nice! Oh, and the food's pretty good.  Their menu is HUGE, so you're bound to find something you like; this time 'round, I had their chicken tortilla soup (sooo good; they bring out the dry ingredients and broth separately, then mix them together at the table; cool!) and half giant (and I mean giant) baked potato topped with their Pirahna Ale chile (yummers!).   It was good, and I'll be back :)"
Rebecca C.,"Redding, CA",99,142,423,4.0,12/17/2013,"B.J.'s is one of the places I most often visit in Nataomas. They are always busy no matter what time you go. (I think it's because of their great food!) The menu has essentially anything you want! Their food is delicious! The pizza is wonderful, chicken alfredo is wonderful, and their salads are wonderful too! The pazookies are one of my favorite desserts- especially the cookies and cream!  They have a berry cider that is surprisingly amazing!  The service is pretty good here too. I've had a few not fun instances but overall it's usually fine. They don't come by often, so make sure you ask for everything you want when they do come by."
Sierra L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/15/2016,"One star because I have to for this review. Drinks are good but I ordered a rib eye medium well. First time it came back medium rare & the second it was rare. Manager took the rib eye off my bill but still, steaks are made every night & you still cannot get the cook right. Disappointed."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,5.0,4/22/2014,"Had dinner there last night about 7:00 PM. Seated promptly by the hostess. Our server was Ryan | Great waiter- Potsticker appetizer was delish! Had the soup (clam chowder) in the bread bowl. Presentation is nice. Soup is on the salty side- good & very filling. Kid meal chicken strips (3) with fries. Quality portion for the price. Hamburger was hot, fresh and juicy .Yummy- served with a heaping side of fries. Turkey club was toasty and tasty with a big side of fries as well. BJ's has a lot to offer on their menu & the service at all the locations we have been to has always been great. BTW: they introduced new member cards. Now, each time you dine you'll accumulate points you get free offers. Check it out! We joined last night-"
Melissa R.,"Greenfield, CA",6,42,29,5.0,8/9/2015,"Savannah was an awesome waitress.  She came to our table often and was very helpful.  I had the Santa Fe salad with shrimp and my husband had the parmesan crusted chicken.  The food was very good, but we really enjoyed the service."
Brandon G.,"Gowen, MI",1,3,,3.0,9/8/2015,Came here when my mother when my mother was in town. Had a great beer. Good was mediocre. Spaghetti had little sauce. And was served with powdered parmesan instead of the shaved parmesan like house salad. But what was there was pretty taste. The three meatballs were a little squishy. My girl friends chicken Pesto sandwich was incredible.  My Hawaiian mahi was a little over cooked but the sauce was sweet with a hint of spice. Though the pineapple looked like it was canned.
Trish L.,"Sacramento, CA",111,8,5,1.0,10/24/2016,"I use to love going to Bjs, but after my experience last night I will not be going back. The menu was changed and they took off my favorite meal, the balsamic chicken. So I had to find something new which wasn't a problem. The waiter started out at the table by complaining about a party of 16 and his night. We were out for an anniversary dinner so the complaining was not the best way to start out the night. I ordered a steak and asked to get the mashed potatoes without cheese. The waiter said that was not possible which now leads me to know the food is just pre-made frozen and warmed up. When I told him I would find something different on the menu the waiter went back and forth with me 3-4 times pushing me to get the steak which ended in a slight argument. I kept telling him I would find something different. He was confused as to why I did not want the steak with the potato. In my opinion when I stated I would pick something else the issue should have been dropped. From that point on it was a waiting game for the food. My burger wasn't great, they no longer have shoe string fries, and our pizza was cold. When we got our appetizer, 15 minutes after getting one salad for the table, there was not any lemon for the calamari. I tried to get someone's attention but of coarse I was ignored since we were not directly their table. Never going back. Sad because pizookies are awesome. Yet again it's not hard to mess up a frozen cookie."
Elizabeth E.,"Stockton, CA",1,1,,1.0,2/4/2016,"Don't go here. Although I only ordered dessert, my server never checked on me. He took forever to drop off the check. Then took forever to pick it back up so I can pay. Therefore, I did not tip. ANNNND to top it all off, I checked my bank account today & the server tipped himself $5 dollars!!!!!!!!! I never write reviews, but I'm seriously pissed."
Michele O.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",58,198,358,3.0,11/30/2014,"Always a little too busy and loud for my taste, but is okay for a casual lunch or dinner out.  Ordered mahi-mahi tacos.  Tasted okay, nothing special.  Fish was a little on the dry side, a little ""fishy"" tasting (yes, I know, mahi-mahi is fish, but fresh and cooked right, it does not taste ""fishy"").   Overall, all diners in my party were satisfied.  Service was pretty good."
Rose R.,"Willows, CA",8,19,4,1.0,4/18/2016,"Absolutely the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant. The waiters didnt know who was our waiter after waiting for 15 minutes to get water. When we wanted to get out check, again the waiter disappeared. Terrible. As for the food, both my friend and I had tummy aches that night..... go else where!"
Mariah B.,"Sacramento, CA",74,17,8,1.0,2/14/2016,Rude. Just rude. Called ahead to put in a reservation and the guy told us 45 min. We get here and the woman tells us it will be another 25 min and that they don't do reservations with an attitude. Don't waste your money on the crap service and cheap food.
Sean G.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/26/2016,"Been here so many times and used to be a favorite, but since the last year or so, service has been very disappointing. Very slow, takes forever to get food, nor does anyone come and check on you in a timely fashion."
Keith M.,"Orange, CA",3,26,,3.0,6/23/2015,The food Was Ok  to be fair I showed up late night on Friday  1 hour before the kitchen closed  but I ordered the Jambalaya on the waiters recommendation. The flavor was there however all the meat in the dish was overcooked and dried out. I van only assume it was do to sitting in a warming tray.  Staff was very friendly and help full I did not bother to ask for a redo on the dish as I was on a timeline for a flight
Neha K.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",4,7,10,1.0,12/31/2015,Extremely rude. Poor service. The waitstaff were horrible. They were bringing out the food and appetizers at the same time. We were sitting there with a table full of dishes
Joe O.,"Sacramento, CA",3,13,18,5.0,4/24/2016,Love bj's got great iPhone app u will alway he a seat! Pay with it to! Love watching Big screen tv's on game day or having that tuna appetizer and a pizza
Sus R.,"Sacramento, CA",13,46,75,3.0,3/22/2015,"I like its beers, and the place. Great for watching a game or just going for a burger and beer. In fact I would stick to the burgers because they are amazing. Other dishes are just so so."
Luc L.,"Sacramento, CA",18,139,173,2.0,4/10/2013,"The worst service I have ever experienced. We had a party of 7 and it took the waiter 15-20 minutes before we ordered. Once we ordered, it took about 30 minutes before we got our food. Right at the beginning, I told waiter that we wanted our checks to be split. Within an 1hr, the waiter only checked on our table once after serving food. After food, we literally waited another 20 minutes for our bill. We had to get up and walk up to the cashier to get our bill because no one came back to our table and they did not split our check. They tried to double charge us for wings when they messed up on the order the first time. The manager didn't seem to know what he was doing as well as his servers. Our table was near a table of rude drunks who ruined the atmosphere of our seating area. Food was great but the service was horrible. They don't know how to treat their customers which kept me from leaving a tip."
KrisLarhonda H.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,7,,5.0,4/13/2016,"Good food, good beer!!!! We enjoy date nights here every once in a while because the beer selection is great and the food is good. The service is excellent and they have a very convenient ap you can use for reservations."
Dan R.,"Woodland, CA",3,7,,4.0,3/23/2016,"We go to BJ's often.  They consider us regulars and we often get what we perceive as special treatment.  Your experience may vary. The food is usually good, though 10-20% you will get a favorite dish that is a bit off.  It is clearly related to how busy they are at the time.  Local concerts, graduations and very large parties stretch the place to near capacity and food and service can suffer. If there are issues with food, the management is quite ready to make it right in some way. Good food: Brussel sprouts appetizer, most of the ""enlightened"" (healthy) menu, pizza. Drinks: The beer is better than average, though it may disappoint beer snobs (like me) a bit.  It is brewed by the company, but not on premises.  Hop Storm and Jeremiah Red are not bad.  My wife has enjoyed the lemon drop and pina colada at various times.  Call ahead seating works pretty well to reduce wait times.  About half the time the greeters who answer the phone recognize my wife's voice and accurately put us on the list."
Corina J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",777,201,697,2.0,8/5/2015,"We came here with about 15 others after a college grad ceremony. We had reservations for 15 and for some strange reason they only gave us 14 seats. Weird! It took them far too long to figure out where to put a 15th chair! We had already grabbed an empty table and added it on to the end! Oh NO! That will never work!! The two ladies from the front got extremely upset & twitter-pated about this moving of chairs! Oy vay!! So after all 15 were seated, it took a -long- time for someone to get our order. We had a reservation. I don't get it. Its not like we just showed up? Anyway the food was decent. I had a salad. Bathrooms were clean but a little dark for my taste. The service overall was not very good. We had a huge pile of dirty dishes that nobody came to collect. We actually had to pick up our own dishes and put them on another empty table waiting to be serviced! Its difficult to enjoy coffee & desert with no room to move! Mercifully, the end & time to figure out the bill. Oy vay again!!! There were other meals included on our bill and  others who had entirely wrong meals on theirs! The waitress asked us to look over our bill to see what was incorrect and she came back with a corrected bill. Really. Disappointing experience!!! I think I've been to the Folsom location & it wasn't super amazing either. Maybe this is endemic to this chain. Next time I'll probably avoid going to any of these locations if I can help it."
