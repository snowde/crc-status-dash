Cristina C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,45,49,1.0,3/18/2017,"Basic food for a ridiculous price. I think the more chain restaurants I go to, the more dismissive and disappointed I am with them. This place is overpriced and not even their happy hour can make up for it.  Definitely a no go for me. I would definitely recommend local restaurants and supporting families instead.  For the record I have had their Jambalaya, Sangria, Mojitos, Pizza, Pazookies, and burgers. All were basic and you can find WAY BETTER IN SAC. Check out the Jambalaya at SOUTH...mmmmm."
May D.,"Sacramento, CA",243,46,6,5.0,2/28/2017,"Our waitress and her trainee forgot to put our order in. Hubby and I sat there forever. A waiter came to us and said he was taking over. We asked him about our order. I think they forgot about it. So the waitress that helped is in the beginning apologized and told us the manager was coming. The manager hooked it up. I still would have paid, but would have been kinda upset. I would recommend this place because even though they messed up, they still take care of you and plus the food is delicious. I'm still coming back, especially on Mondays (half off pizzas) and Tuesdays ($3 Pizookies)."
Angela G.,"Orangevale, CA",42,25,29,2.0,9/12/2016,"I am VERY disappointed with our BJ's visit this afternoon; especially since it was my friends first tine here. The food was BLAND and I have NEVER had rubbery ( not crunchy Calamarie) until today. I gave 2 stars because my 2 Bloody Marys were amazing, but my friend has NO intention of coming back, EEEEEEVAH!Sorry Cindy. :0("
A M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,,1.0,9/4/2017,Do not order delivery from them! I took pics of the half sloppy portions I paid a lot for. You know easily when restaurants care about their delivery service or think they are cocky corporate shitheads.
A F.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/8/2017,Huge menu selection!! Super tasty food. No issues with any of the wait staff (can't say that everywhere!). Their root beer is delicious!!  Will definitely return or try another BJ's location
Suzy C.,"Davis, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/2/2017,"Food is ALWAYS cold, takes too long to be greeted.  As a retired server, I try to be patient however this place is fucking garbage."
Lindsey M.,"Redding, CA",3,23,18,2.0,3/18/2017,"Used the ""preferred"" waitlist, and was told that it would be 5 minutes. We waited over 20 and watched groups that checked in after us get a table before us. Don't over sell and under deliver to people, it's just wrong. Food was fine, our waitress was greatNancy"
Denny T.,"Sacramento, CA",187,612,403,4.0,9/24/2015,"Most recent visit we stopped in. Helped friendly and promptly by staff. Mia introduced in no time. Drink order was taken with no hesitation. We didn't take much time to order our meals. We ordered a soup, wedge salad, medium Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza and a salted caramel pizookie as part of a promotional special. Food didn't take long to arrive. The wedge salad and tortilla soup came. Hot temperature and flavor balanced was the soup. The salad was dressed in a balance of blue cheese dressing, bacon bites, onion, and salad. The pizza came out at a good point. The pizza was a mix of chicken, pineapple, and jalapeño. Better than expected. We were already full. Got our order for pizookie in which arrived at a reasonable time. The pizookie was a mix bag of salt and sweet. The vanilla ice cream was well scooped and matched well with the pizookie. Bill was settled in a decent time. Overall good experience"
Alyssa T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,40,35,4.0,2/4/2017,This time around both the service and food was good. The server was attentive and didn't rush us to leave when we stayed an extended time.
Maria Z.,"Sacramento, CA",272,113,1052,4.0,9/26/2014,Every time I come here it is packed!! My husband and I usually eat at the bar. Always a good bet for fast service. I'm not sure why this Bj's has a lot of bad reviews.  I went to another Bj's and had a horrible experience. So bad they sent me a $20 gift card in the mail. We were skeptical at first because I ended up in a verbal altercation with one of the bartenders in Folsom. But we gave them another chance. The bartenders in Natomas were awesome!! Excellent customer service. So good we ended up joining their rewards program!! Now to the food!! If you are on a diet this is a good place to eat. They have stuffed mushrooms that are to die for. Also the ahi poke is yummy and healthy. By far the apps are what you should order. Sometimes that's all I get! The corn aioli is delish and they have a new pepperoni pizza dip I'm in love with. Must try. I can say they could improve on service issues in the main dining tables. Takes way too long to get a new beer or a side of mayo. But that's the reason we usually sit by the bar. Overall it's a good experience and a nice alternative from watching football games at Bdubs.
Samuel N.,"Lancaster, CA",129,17,1,3.0,2/21/2017,"So we had many unknown choices and settle for the norm, it was ok and All I give them for taste is 3, service 4"
John S C.,"Sacramento, CA",388,16,9,5.0,3/7/2017,"Firstly this is a chain restaurant, not fine dining. Some people may have bad experiences as a result of bad expectations. That being said of all the chains in the area, this restaurant has energy, atmosphere, and fun hard working individuals making up its team of servers. Now, some are better than others, but I have never visited a restaurant where that is not the case. All I know is I spend time getting to know my servers, make them laugh, and in return, I have never had a bad experience here. In fact, I have found myself frequenting this restaurant more and more because of how quick and accommodating this restaurant staff is. The food is always hot and quick, and the drinks are strong and delicious. If I've ever had a problem, I've let the wait staff know politely and they made sure it was made right expeditiously."
Jen H.,"San Jose, CA",375,165,346,2.0,10/25/2015,"Service is VERY SLOW here. Even though all the waitresses/waiters were very nice. It took us 1 hour to get our table when they said it would just be a 30 minute wait. We came into the restaurant approximately 7:30pm, and did not leave until 10pm or so.  Some of the food we ordered were Chicken Avocado club sandwich - Very delicious. decent. would order again if i was craving it brewhouse burger - good typical burger. portion is big, the meat was cooked nicely as well.  ahi tuna salad - it was alright, but pricey in my opinion wings - flavorful and on point. very oily though.  Pizookie - delicious!!! highly recommend to everyone that goes to BJs Overall, food was consistent with other locations, and flavorful. However, service was VERY SLOW. and we had to keep reminding our server to refill our water as well."
Carrisa M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,4,3.0,4/3/2017,I give it three stars because the food was very good. However the 15 minute wait time to get our drinks then another 20 minutes 4 our food then another 25 minutes to get dessert was ridiculous. Not sure if this was the kitchen or the server's fault but not sure I go there again
Gina B.,"Carmichael, CA",1,5,1,1.0,4/2/2017,"This is not the first time I've been disappointed with the service and food at BJ's but this will for sure be my last time EVER eating at a BJ's establishment. The food took 45 minutes to come out... when it finally came out all of our meals where cold, my bread was soggy on my California Sandwich, the beef brisket had barely any meat, the fries where  terrible and the black and blue bacon burger did not have one slice of bacon in it..... not even a sliver of bacon!!! The waitress was pretty nice, which could have made up for the food being extremely late.... but then the food showed up and was TERRIBLE!!"
Keith S.,"Sacramento, CA",35,28,4,4.0,1/11/2017,Had to give an extra star because surprisingly the general manager actually listens. Since my last review they've actually improved the portion of rice. Lol Idk if the general manager told everyone in the back kitchen to serve a larger portion of rice but its definitely nice to know that the GM takes the time out of his day to review what he sees on yelp and improve whatever concerns customers might have. Greatly appreciate the service and it has only improved since then.
Sista S.,"Sacramento, CA",47,13,22,4.0,2/8/2017,"We ordered unlimited soup & salad at 11:39. 25 minutes later our food showed up. Needless to say we were not happy. Our server, Sergio, brought over the manager. Robert apologized several times and took care of our lunch saying, ""...it shouldn't take this long for such a simple order..."" They made immediate changes to how soups & salads were delivered to tables. Robert even gave us a complimentary dessert. This review is ultimately about how well Sergio handled our complaints and provided excellent service to us for the remainder of our lunch. Thank you, Sergio. Broccoli cheddar soup & tomato mozzarella salad were ok, by the way."
D And D.,"Cedar Park, TX",36,76,2,1.0,6/3/2016,"It all started out fine. Great salad, good appetizer and then the main course came out. A sirloin steak and burnt side dish was the most pathetic meal I have ever been served. The steak looked the size of a postage stamp and disgusting to say the least. We felt bad for our server who did a good job. The corporate management should be ashamed of themselves for allowing that type of garbage to be served. Pretty obvious they do not read their reviews."
Mee M.,"San Francisco, CA",55,62,255,3.0,12/5/2015,"Always a great place to hang out with friends for late night. Pizzas are good!  If you can't finish your pizzas or wings and you want to take it home, you can ask the server for a to-go side of ranch and hot sauce for the wings."
Joe M.,"Woodland, CA",70,142,288,4.0,6/17/2015,"So I have been eating at this bjs for a couple of years already. My go to dish is the balsamic glazed chicken. Also the deep dish pizza is nice and fluffy, making it a close second. Beer selection is nice but I get the brewhouse blonde as my beer choice. Their burgers didn't really impress me and the wings kinda fell short in taste, to me at least. But overall I have my go to items and can't say I had a really bad experience."
