Jeremy H.,"Sacramento, CA",89,125,54,3.0,7/28/2016,"Pretty good. Not amazing, but good. I enjoyed most everything I've ordered... been to this one and a few others probably a half dozen times total. The beers are pretty good, the cocktails are a little hit and miss, and the menu is a mixed bag. What I mean by that is they really try to tackle a large variety of dishes and continually add new things to the menu to see how customers like them. I've tried some of the experimental dishes and that's what they tasted like... experiments. Typically I'd like the first few bites and then I'd realize that it was overall waaaaay to salty or sugary. For price and portions though I still thought everything is pretty fair here and I'll likely come back here and there. I saw some complaints on service here, but I've always had great service here. They would accommodate to any seating requests I had, which is important if you bring kids, and our waiters/waitresses have always responded to us quick and kept our drinks filled. Knowing Natomas though, you'll definitely want to be careful about showing up during peak hours or you'll be waiting... that's how it is for most large restaurants in that area though."
Jean S.,"Sacramento, CA",203,244,1450,4.0,6/11/2015,"Out of all the BJ's locations I've been to, this one is my favorite! I've dined at this location over 50 times so I've had a wide range of experiences, but majority of them have been above average to excellent. One thing that stands out about this location is the customer service. I've come across some of the best waiters/waitresses in the dining industry here in this unsuspecting little BJ's. In the recent months, there were a couple of male waiters in the bar area and at least one female waitress in the restaurant area that were amazing! Genuinely friendly, excited, positive, and helpful! Definitely top notch customer service. There were a few times that I had waitresses that were not quite as excellent/genuine and some rather cold, but I can't let that take away from those that did provide excellent service.  A few other instances when I thought service was great - one time I came when their credit card machine was broken. The place was packed and the workers looked frantic as I overheard several of them saying they never used the manual credit card reader. I decided to order takeout instead of dining in. During all this chaos, the lady taking my order was still very positive, patient, and kept a friendly smile. She offered me a free beverage during my wait and was kind and helpful the entire time. The food came out a lot faster than I expected as well. Another time, the manager Jeremy had quickly addressed my issue when I felt something didn't taste right. He offered to take the dish off the bill or replace it (although I just kept it as it wasn't that bad). Also, being a loyalty member, I usually receive emails for a survey regarding my experience. Whether positive or negative, the general manager Shawn always responds and addresses concerns if there are any. One other note - the hostesses are USUALLY pretty good about greeting people when they come in or thanking them when they leave (although this was not done last night when I came and left). But out of 50+ times, the percentage of above average customer service is in the greater.  So onto the food. Not everything on this menu is 5 star and sometimes my favorite dishes come out better than other times. One of my must orders is the avocado egg rolls. Last night, it was one of the best ever! Crispy on the outside with perfect and generous amounts of avocado dipped in that sweet tamarind sauce...super delicious! I also tried the honey sriracha brussel sprouts and they were fantastic. They do have a tiny spicy kick. One of my favorite pizzas is their BJ's Favorite. Sometimes it's really good, but yesterday's was just ok. There was a lot of dough and the toppings were not spread out very well so some slices were practically naked. And the bell pepper toppings were not cooked very well. So not the best this time. I've ordered this dish several times in the past and it came out very tasty. Another great appetizer is their chicken wings with buffalo and ranch sauce. The chicken wings are usually moist and juicy and not over dry.  They do offer a kids menu. For $5.75, the chicken tenders, side of fries, and a cup of milk is not too bad. All kids meals include an entree, side, and drink for $5.75.  Of course, I can't forget the pizookie! Nothing beats the Cookies N' Cream pizookie, but all the flavors are really good! Some may say the pizookie is too sweet (and it probably is for one person), but it definitely should be shared! They have mini sizes now and even those can be shared. If  you are celebrating a birthday, they offer a free mini pizookie. Nice! BJ's is definitely one of the best chain restaurants amongst its kind. At this location especially, the food is usually pretty good, but the service is great. Also a great place for beers and game watching."
Cynthia C.,"Sacramento, CA",199,223,1182,3.0,6/7/2015,"Went here pretty late at 12 midnight since they are open until 1:00 am and they were still slow with service.  That has been my experience with all BJs though.....Had the deep dish lasagna ravioli and it was awesome!  Also had mini Oreo cookie pizookie.  Yes the smaller ones are available for you people still dying to eat some, but have no room left because of the entre.  I was able to squeeze one in and it was nice and warm as always.  Will be back, but not if I'm in a hurry.  ;)"
Bruno W.,"Woodland, CA",5,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,"Worst customer service with the same waiter twice.  I'm a regular customer at this location. I always come and order the same dish, chicken Alfredo. And the waiters are always willing to replace my broccoli with chicken since I dont like brocolli, for no extra charge. Even the first time I asked my regular waiters to take out the brocolli they offered me more chicken with no hesitation. I didn't even asked for it. So I always ask for no brocolli and they give me the extra chicken with no fee. Until having the worst experience ever on August when this waiter decided to have a lot of attitude with me even before ordering my food. When I ordered my usual dish he right away cut my words saying in such a very rude way there is an extra charge for replacing brocolli for chicken. I didn't like the way he approached to me so I decided to talk to the manager and that manager told me ""This guy is a good worker"" and this manager told me that yes there is an extra charge for replacing brocolli but hes going to do it that time for free. The manager just excused that waiter and I didn't even got an apologize for that attitude, instead the manager sent me the same waiter to attend me. I ate, pay and left the restaurant with a bad experience but I didn't want to post this on yelp, so I didn't.  After that I came back and my waiters treated me, as always, with respect and I replaced my brocolli for chicken with no question.  Until tonight, I had the unfortunate of having the same crummy waiter with a lot of attitude and he even recognized me. I ordered my regular dish chicken alfredo and asked him to replace brocolli for chicken. He answered right away and with a sarcastic smile ""dont you remember what my manager told you that we charge extra for the chicken"" arent waiters supposed to be courteous to the customers? Because he sure wasn't. His attitude was worst than the first time so I had to get up and left the restaurant. Im not planning to ever come back again even though this was my favorite restaurant.  I understand that there could be extra charges but there is always courtesy from waiters and that is the hook that makes a customer come back to the restaurant and that is the reason why I was a regular customer and used to come during my lunch break. In fact, i think courtesy to customers is more important that profiting $1 to replace brocolli. To me it shows that the business is weak and cares nothing about its customers. I never experienced this in other locations like Elk Grove or Arden. They are always courteous to the customer."
Ricky V.,"Sacramento, CA",15,57,9,1.0,4/17/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would. After waiting an 1 hour and 40 minutes for our food, it came out cold and the pizza was dry with literally no sauce. If I wanted simple bread I would've just stayed home... The waitress took forever to take our Oder - maybe 30 minutes, and it took her about 20 minutes to bring us drinks after being seated. When we received our drinks during our meals it took forever for her to refill the waters. When the manager came to greet us she looked inconvenienced, irritated, etc. She took the pizza off our tab, but of course never said sorry. Overall I would not go back...."
Leesii K.,"Sacramento, CA",277,17,,5.0,1/15/2017,"The girl Nicole with the purple hair was so cute & personable!!! Great, fast service. Recommended the Mediterranean chicken tacos & it hit the spot. (: !!!"
Jacob V.,"Sacramento, CA",8,7,,1.0,8/5/2017,"No more. I have given this corporation many, many chances but I am seriously done. We were in the neighborhood and between this and another corporate blunder we decided on the lesser of two evils. Just yuck. The poor server must have been having an off night because every one of his tables had something wrong with them. We asked for the new chicken sandwich and the country fried burger with crispy fries. What we received was a chicken sandwich that looked like something you could get at an AMPM gas station and the special chicken sandwich that straight up tasted like fryer oil.  Not wanting to cause a scene like some people can, we promptly got his attention and told him about our problem. The manager,  who besides the Pazookie is the only redeeming quality of this establishment, apologized and brought us out replacement meals.  I did not get her name but she had a chef coat on and a long braid. Her professionalism was top notch. I am grateful she was there to defuse the situation and offer a solution. She is a gem. Although we will not be returning to BJ's I wish the staff luck and prosperity."
Jeff K.,"Lincoln, NE",16,81,444,4.0,10/8/2015,"Food amounts are huge. Ordered some chili cheese dip, a lunch pizza and soup. The cheese dip is for four people I'm guessing. The pizza was a nice sized pan pizza with a good, buttery, and crisp crust!  Very good!   The soup was chili and it was a large bowl, not a coup as I expected. It was served with sour cream and green onion. Very good.  Staff was friendly. The server was always checking on me and filling my tea glass.  I recommend this place and would go back."
Ryan A.,"Sacramento, CA",210,19,1,5.0,7/16/2016,"Don't come on a weekday because all the dads will be on business lunches and you'll never get a table. Other than that, and aside from all the aforementioned dads creepin on every waitress ever and being demanding, BJs rules. It doesn't matter what kind of food you feel like, odds are BJs has it. So have a root beer n chill"
Tabassum L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,66,,3.0,6/8/2016,Came to this location a few years back with some friends after a Wedding. Customer service was good but we all just ended up having the Pazookie since it was late. Pazookie is a huge cookie fresh out of the oven served with ice cream on top. You can always get a smaller portion of Pazookie as well with a different topping. The only reason I haven't came back is because it's not really a Restaurant that I prefer.
Jody S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1326,,3.0,2/1/2017,Chicken thyme 690 calories is good. TVs in bar area. Good service. Good value. Healthy food options.
Alex R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/16/2016,This restaurant is really nice. Every time I sit at the bar the guy who helps me is always on top of his game. Don't know his name but he is amazing. He usually works there around 7pm
Michell K.,"Stonyford, CA",0,41,35,5.0,11/30/2016,"What's to say? Great food and friendly service. You might want to consider calling ahead for reservation during peak hours, but even on a busy night I haven't had to wait more than 15-20 minutes. Food comes fast and is delicious."
Angelica R.,"Davis, CA",72,3,2,5.0,6/17/2017,i just want to thank this location and specifically the manager Rob who went above and beyond for my party today . i graduated today and had a fairly large party and Rob made sure we were taken care of and made sure our visit was nothing shy of amazing. i ended up losing my grad photos and he personally went through the back to find them for me!! i highly recommend this BJs and am a very pleased customer. thank you again Rob you were amazing..best of luck to your son on his journey through college.  -Angelica
Angela M.,"Vacaville, CA",53,33,18,5.0,10/23/2016,"I come here a lot by ordering lunch through the app. Really easy to use and so convenient to order from the office and pick up quick on busy days. I've always had good experiences and this morning I went for brunch and it was great all around.  I ordered the breakfast scramble which came with green chilies - never thought about adding that with eggs but it was delicious! Good size of food for just $9.95! The scramble comes on a bed of potatoes but when I ordered I think they didn't have any prepped so it took awhile. I think I waited for about 10 minutes after my friend got his food, which I didn't mind, and the nice waitress apologized and the manager came out also to say sorry. They really didn't have to but they gave it to me free of charge for me waiting. Really great for them to not only go out of their way to make sure my meal came out perfect but also be so friendly and accommodating!"
Dee R.,"Sacramento, CA",218,274,1187,3.0,2/3/2016,I used the new delivery app and was not impressed with the time it took to deliver my food and the food Prep.
Milee T.,"Sacramento, CA",31,49,36,4.0,2/16/2016,I ordered brussel sprouts I must say it was my very first time ever eating brussel sprouts! I couldn't believe I've gone my entire life without ever eating them before! As busy as they are their service has always been quick and friendly. I've only been here 4 times but will continue to come back for their brussel sprouts and Parmesan crusted chicken.
Cory M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,4,1.0,3/26/2015,Waited 15 minutes to be seated. Waited 5 minutes for water. Waited 30 minutes for food. There was a chicken bone in my sandwich. Will not return.
Sophia H.,"Sacramento, CA",143,122,273,4.0,2/23/2016,"This place is always good. The service is hit or miss but it's a large restaurant and they have lots of people to cater too. Most of the time my food is perfect, I've had a few instances where my food was made the wrong way, or not warm. But it was always fixed. I love the pizookies! Who doesn't? And the Santa Fe spring rolls are really good!  They have great drinks as well, I love the root beer float, with real vanilla bean icecream!  So Don't let the bad reviews fool you, this place isn't as bad as they say! It's great for large groups, games, happy hour, or just for dessert!"
Racheal M.,"Sacramento, CA",10,7,1,1.0,3/15/2016,Was there last night. Got the chicken bacon ranch pizza. Was eating the leftovers for lunch just now and pulled a metal shaving out of my mouth. Wtf?! Never going there again. Posted a picture.
