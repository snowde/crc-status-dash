Raphael M.,"Livermore, CA",124,12,1,1.0,5/24/2017,Had Emil R. as our server. Three of us ordered food and apps. Ordered a trio for the app. Two steaks and salmon for entrees. Salmon entree came out. Apps came out ten minutes later. 20 minutes later our steaks came out. Server never checked on us. Manager sat at the host stand the whole night and didn't table touch anything.
Kyle S.,"Visalia, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/6/2016,If I could I would give no stars. The bartender was good and very attentive. But we ordered boneless wings and apparently that means we didn't want them fully cooked. Both of us were sick that night and the rest of the day.
Robin D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/10/2016,My friend and I went in for a couple drinks last night and was asked by the manager to order food and that they will not be serving us any more beers? He even said I know you are not drunk but we don't want someone from our establishment driving drunk? Then don't sell alcohol? Don't plan on going back here and was highly disrespectful never have dealt with that before. In response to my comment: Thanks for your response but your the manager at the location I'm talking about and further more your website for feedback doesn't even go to corporate it just reroutes the feedback to the same location? How is that any help? Basically any concerns for the location just go unheard.
Artesia W.,"Sacramento, CA",40,6,21,3.0,12/14/2016,Loving the ribs made with root beer. Waiting to order dessert even tho im full. Kids still eating
-Susan L.,"Yuba City, CA",79,56,338,1.0,4/23/2015,"Very disappointed at the amount of time for my friends & I to be seated. It was aver an hour wait! Then when we were seated, I ordered the seared ahi salad... The ahi might as well jump out of my plate because it was completely raw! If we weren't in such a rush to leave & all weren't starving, I would have sent my meal back. But who knows how long I would have had to wait for the food than.  I am pretty sure I don't want to go back."
Luis H.,"Oakland, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/15/2016,"Great food, great atmosphere,  and excellent service!!! Janelle was our server and she was awesome! Its our first time here and i think we've found the place to go to since we're new to the sacramento area although there's a BJ's almost in every region we never tried it before.  We'll call ahead next time and reserve a big booth so we can enclose our 21 month old. Thanks BJ's!!!"
Isabel O.,"Sacramento, CA",1,16,2,3.0,11/12/2016,"My husband ordered a large pizza, it was mostly bread and sauce. Cheese was barely visible and so was the toppings. Waiter was very professional he deserves 5 stars. Yet, it took 1.5 to get our pizza and steak on a Monday. Dont plan on returning for a while."
Antoinette Z.,"Sacramento, CA",69,1,,1.0,11/25/2016,Worst service ever. If you want to have any sort of decent service do not come to this restaurant. Horrible!
Charlie S.,"Portland, OR",9,90,174,2.0,2/14/2015,"Pizza was totally disgusting. First of all, it was tiny as hell for $15. The tomatoes are clearly canned. It has practically no sauce. The ingredients were thrown on in little clumps of like three pepperonis in one spot and not spread out. The pizza was also weirdly salty. Never again. Fried artichokes are good. The dipping sauce hardly takes like a lemon aoili or whatever they said it was -- has almost a ranch sort of flavor. Mac & cheese is mediocre. Tastes like it's made from a box with a seasoning packet. Not very good."
Tuan N.,"Sacramento, CA",725,209,353,4.0,11/21/2014,"This place is always buuuuuuuuuuuuuuusy during lunch hours. Get there quick and beat the rush! Like most chain restaurants, food tastes about the same to me for the different locations I've been to. This location is my personal favorite in terms of service quality. The one in Elk Grove is a hit and miss... Today, our party of 6 arrived just before it got too busy. Our food did take a little bit of time, but no more than 20 minutes. Our servier, Samantha, was a kind and energetic one. I saw her run past us multiple times carrying multiple dishes without a doubt of it falling! As busy as this place was, we still got checked upon to make sure we got everything we wanted.  As much as I wanted to order their strawberry splash, I had to refrain since I was dining in front of my boss.. LOL. Wouldn't want to get tipsy while on the job..."
Alex M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,18,7,3.0,11/20/2016,They gave me $25 gift card to give them another shot still haven't been back if i decide to come back ill write another update
Adriana C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/2/2017,"Came to have dinner, my husband asked for a well done steak and there was blood on it. I know, he's weird for liking his steak well done, but that's how he likes it. Anyway he asked for it to be cooked longer and they came back and said that they put a whole new steak and it would take another 20-30 minutes, mind you we had already been waiting for like an hour for our food. We decided to leave and they didn't even give us a discount for the inconvenience or anything.... moral of the story they don't really care for your business or care to make a bad experience into a decent one. And the waiter was a witch too lol. I'll be back but I'll make sure I get a different waiter."
Sergio R.,"Sacramento, CA",98,9,1,1.0,11/15/2016,"i went to dinner on Saturday with a party of 6 and the service really sucked. Our waitress was rude and took for ever to bring our food, We also ordered dessert and it too us about 45 to get three desserts we had ordered. When I asked the waitress about the delay she responded, cant you tell we are really busy. That same waitress also gave us really bad service two weeks prior to that. With service like that I won't be returning to that restaurant. After dinner I called the manager to let them know about our bad experience and he said I would get so sort of email on Monday 11/14 but I still haven't received it."
Micahlee W.,"Roseville, CA",30,21,,2.0,9/15/2016,"BJ's is a great restaurant, but everytime I've gone to the one in natomas the service is slow and they serve food that's sat under the heat lamp too long."
Keli R.,"Sacramento, CA",2,10,2,1.0,3/26/2017,"Wow. If I could give 0 stars,  I would.  Food is okay here but the curbside/pick up SUCKS BIG TIME. Like don't even bother.  We picked up an order and brought it home. AN ENTIRE SANDWICH AND NOT ONE BUT TWO ORDERS OF FRIES WERE MISSING. This was not some huge order or anything either. My husband went back to pick up the missing items (otherwise he had no dinner for himself at all!) AND WAITED LIKE 30 MINUTES FOR THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS. What is going on at this ridiculous location. Oh boy, guess what?! We got a free tea out of all this hassle. NEVER going back."
Angela G.,"Sacramento, CA",108,48,70,2.0,10/31/2015,"Alter reading all reviews it's clear that BJ'S has a service issue. Sounds like patrons are expected to wait to be attended. Must be nice... 10/31/15 approx 3pm we (three of us) came to BJ's for some good eats. The restaurant was not busy and had quite a few open tables. We were greeted and seated right away. As we perused through our menus I saw the waiter attend the two tables next to us. He did this a few times. Not once did he acknowledge us. Only after four more guests arrived and were attended within a minute of being seated did I get upset.  I went up to the hostess and asked her if we were going to be attended. She grabbed the manager. He urged us to stay. My table decided to try our luck elsewhere.  Honestly, it felts as if we weren't welcomed. You see... the majority of the other guest were caucasian and so were the servers. The party of four who were attended to right away were also caucasian. It seems like BJ's provides slow service selectively and since this is a reportedly frequent occurrence it has to be coming from management. Natomas is one of the most divers neighborhoods in all of the US. Is this why BJ's in Natomas has so many poor service reviews? It might be something worth looking into. Perhaps BJ's should also look into their hiring policies. All the wait staff was Caucasian, hardly representative of the neighboring population. It's hard to believe that only Caucasians would have applied to be wait staff. Right next door at Mimi's Cafe he staff is quite diverse."
Eric S.,"Rio Linda, CA",98,4,1,1.0,10/20/2016,Another decent franchise bites the dust. Used to be a fun environment with better than average food and great customer service. Service was horrible and staff was rude. Food was the worst it's ever been there... will not be going there again.
Karebear W.,"West Sacramento, CA",45,79,37,4.0,2/20/2015,"Our server Lorelei was awesome! She was very friendly and always making sure we were doing okay!  However, the manager or boss should have a talk with the front of the house people. They didn't greet us and ignored us when we walked out. They were not really doing their job. The whole time they were just standing there slacking off. Did they really just get paid to slack off?"
Sunny K.,"Upland, CA",0,36,,5.0,10/18/2016,Drinks are good & strong Food yummy Service great Great place to chill & a humungous menu :)
Phillip B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,6,4.0,4/16/2016,"No bad for takeout.  Well, it was actually curbside service.  I placed the order online after securing a $10 off coupon for purchasing $35 worth of food.  We ordered the crispy fried artichokes and sauteed brussell sprouts as appetizers.  We ordered two burgers, one medium rare with a side of white cheddar mashed potatoes and the other burger well done with a side of wedge fries.  The food was good and still warm when we arrived home to dig in.  The service was quick and the customer service was on point.   Here are the reasons I give them only 4 stars: 1.  The fried artichokes got a little soggy because they didn't vent the container.  I actually did it on the ride home, which saved them somewhat. 2.  I asked for a medium rare burger and my burger was actually cooked medium. 3.  The white cheddar mashed potatoes were super dense.  I'll never get those again. Other than those three minor issues, I would definitely order from BJ's Natomas again."
