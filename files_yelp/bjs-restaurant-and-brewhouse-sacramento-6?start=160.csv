Tiffany L.,"West Sacramento, CA",7,161,53,2.0,12/23/2015,"Customer service 3/5 Food: 1/5 My bf ordered sliders and they came out looking unpleasant. They looked as if somebody smooshed the 2 breads together and it was really flat. The meat inside did not even cover HALF of the MINI sandwich buns. It had NO FLAVOR, NO CHEESE, NO CONDIMENTS INSIDE. Horrible dish prepared for us. I will never order it again. Spaghetti was not good either. Sauce was so plain. Chicken Alfredo was OK. Only thing we enjoyed was the pizookie. Bj 's have the best pizookie!"
Kayla S.,"Stockton, CA",42,95,124,3.0,2/17/2016,"Chain restaurants done vary much from location to location so there's that. The layout/decor is basically the same as any other Bj's you've been to.  I always sit in the bar and there's almost always an open table or two you can snag without a wait. The service for me varies, as I have had really good attentive severs and some servers that are just ok. The last server I had in the bar was just eh. She seemed uninterested in helping us and assumed her way through serving us instead of asking us if we were good or needed anything else.  Other than that, typical drink and food selection, which you kinda have to expect when you come here."
Linda S.,"Sacramento, CA",116,242,873,1.0,10/26/2014,"Slow service, food brought out cold. Waitress came out with the receipt to ask what did you order again?? Everything is just sooooo slow."
Kim F.,"Sacramento, CA",36,82,59,1.0,11/29/2016,"On veterans day, I decided to come to BJ's to treat my fiance (which is a veteran). As I entered, there were people waiting. There were probably like 4 girls at the counter that were employee's just chatting with each other. I asked how long the wait is going to be, one girl said about 20 minutes. She asked for my number so that it will alert me when our table is ready. We waited 40 minutes, people that came in after us got tables. We doubled checked if she got the number correct, which she did, and she said we will be seated shortly. but still, NOTHING. So instead we went somewhere else. Multiple people that were waiting outside for an alert over an HOUR were complaining how some with the same parties of 2-4 were getting seated first. What a shame to see families and well deserved veterans sitting outside for an hour and more. We decided to go somewhere else. As we got to another restaurant, we still never got that alert text."
Karl S.,"Downtown, Sacramento, CA",44,10,5,2.0,3/16/2017,"We are frequent diners of BJ's and our visit this past Tuesday was very disappointing. We were a party of five excited to have dinner and celebrate Pi day with $3 Pizookies. It was a slow evening, so we were seated immediately. After 15 minutes, we weren't greeted by a server, no drink order taken. I had to get up and ask someone for service. When i asked if we could have service, a waitress (didn't catch her name but she had dark hair and tattoos on her arms), seemed annoyed that I was even talking to her and told me we would be helped shortly. It took so long that our drink and food order was taken at the same time. Our WATER showed up 10 minutes later and the sparkling water showed up 20 minutes later. Once our food arrived, our server, Trenton never paid any attention to us. We had to ask another server for water refills. We ordered 3 Pizookies for the table and when we got our bill, we were charged full price. Pi day fell on a Tuesday, so Pizookies were already on special for $3 every Tuesday. Trenton told us the special is ""tomorrow."" We had to show him the email with the promo and even the menu said so... Then he took another 15 minutes to bring our bill back. I wasn't going to leave a review but the second I KINDLY asked for service, we got nothing but a bad attitude from everyone except the server who wasn't our server. Food was great. Service, not so much."
Addison M.,"Sacramento, CA",1476,395,439,4.0,10/19/2015,This was my first time to this location it is a pretty active parking lot with a couple restaurants in the area. So today I went to lunch with my grandparents and when we sat down the waitress did not tell us her name so that's why this review is getting four stars but the service was great and the food was delicious as always! If you want to good burger here; get the California burger medium rare with either a shock top or Bluemoon for best results!
Erika S.,"Yuba City, CA",102,83,129,5.0,2/21/2016,"Love the online ordering for dine in, during a busy time you can order online for a specific time and you will be seated with ur food and drinks shortly after! I always come here whenever i go to a king game! Sometimes you even see players after home games!"
Lou G.,"Fair Oaks, CA",57,33,247,1.0,6/12/2016,"Came here for lunch on a Monday and the host was nowhere to be seen. 10 mins later she comes busting out of what seems like the kitchen door and approached me & my friends. She asked if we wanted a table or sit at the bar. As I was about to reply she immediately cut me off and insisted its best we sit at the bar because of their specials. We then told her that we wanted a table however, she still adamantly insisted that we sit at the bar because there's ""happy hour"" food specials.  You can see in her face she doesn't want to take the time to do her job and seat us. The place wasn't busy during lunch hour at all and customer service may be a big factor. The host is the customers' first interaction and if they get a cold welcome well they probably won't be back.  Negative stars for the host, BJ' please get rid of her. Food is underwhelming. 1 shining star for the sweet lady who served us."
Steve J.,"San Jose, CA",3,3,,2.0,3/5/2016,"This used to be my favorite place to eat! I brought family here that visited from GA and my wife, hairstylist, recommended this chain to all her clients. We were very disappointed when I ordered the ""6 oz"" steak. When it arrived it was smaller than the palm of my hand and only about a 1/2 inch thick. My wife first commented on it because Weight Watchers says a steak the size of your palm is a 3 oz steak.  We pointed this out to our waitress who tried to justify it by saying, ""that is before cooked"".  Really?  There is 50% shrinkage!? The manager finally came over and was going to justify the size by saying how thick it was. I showed that it was actually very thin. When we received our bill she had comped the steak. Which is the only reason I went back to BJ's. This time to a different location.  I went with a group from work and ordered the lunch portion salmon. While the oz's were not listed, when my plate arrived the whole table laughed at my sliver of salmon. It was hardly larger than a club cracker!! It was wedge shaped, less than 1/2 inch on the ""fat"" end and within an inch tapered to only about a 1/16 of and inch.  This sliver of salmon couldn't have been more than 1 1/2 oz's.  I didn't complain, I didn't send it back. I won't beg a restaurant to serve me a respectable sized serving for the money I paid them. I just won't go back. I won't take my family and these stories have been told to every one of my wife's clients. Don't waste your time and your money just to be disrespected with ""itti bitti mini"" food."
Toubi C.,"San Jose, CA",5,71,77,3.0,1/13/2015,Nice service. Food is pretty consistent. Not great but always pretty good. First time to this location. The Amber is my favorite beer. But they also have another 30 beers on tap.  Pizzas have never been that good. The crust is never crispy.  No brainers are the wings burgers fish and chips. Jambalaya also is tasty and spicy. In general u can't go wrong with the beer pub items.  They also has these new deep dish appetizers that rock. One was the carnitas fries which are insanely good but so bad for u. And these new fries with Fritos!!!
Crystal G.,"Ankeny, IA",0,5,1,1.0,3/17/2017,"Absolutely Terrible service!!!!! We waited for an hour for our food. Both tables behind and in front of us got there after us got their food. After an hour of waiting we just left. It's a shame because they really have great beer but after that experience, we will never go back again!! Thanks for the free drinks!!"
Michael K.,"Livermore, CA",0,11,2,1.0,3/15/2017,"Every time I come here this place gets worse and worse. When I started coming here regularly a little over a year ago the service was great. The portions of food were large and the appearance of the food was great. After that everything started going down hill and the last time I came here was an eye opener. The service has gotten much slower and the time we spend waiting has gone up as well. I mean really it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a refill on a soda. On top of that the portions have gotten smaller. I remember how big the portions used to be when it came to burgers and fries and now the portions make me feel like I'm eating off kids menu. Last time I ordered a burger I specified cheese to be put on my burger and it never made it on the patty. On top of that, it looked like the burger was put together with a blindfold. The fries...well the portions on them has gone down as well and you're still hungry after you finish your plate.The service is also poor. It's painfully slow and at times insulting. I asked for a refill on a soda and the waiter acknowledged my request but he came back to my table later empty handed. I told him again and after 10 minutes I had to flag him down to ask about my drink. He came up with some sort of excuse but it sounded like he flat out forgot.If your time is valuable and you don't want to be treated like trash I recommend you go elsewhere."
Junior A.,"Sacramento, CA",49,17,6,2.0,2/20/2017,"I walked in at 7pm, I was told there was going to be a 15 minute wait but a table came up in only 5 minutes. Once seated out waiter came brought the menu and then our drinks. After ordering the appetizers came and there were no napkins. The waiter was no where to be found. She only came when she brought the food out (two brew house bacon burgers). After that she just put the food on our table and left without asking if we needed anything else. Usually every time I've came to bjs I always have the same thing a burger and the waiter always bring the ketchup and mustard before the order arrives but this was not the case. She passed by when I was halfway with my meal and asked if we needed anything. But she did not stop she just said it as she was passing by so I asked her for everything that was missing. She came back with napkins, ketchup, and mustard. She immediately passed by again dropping of the tab. She came to the table again while I was still enjoying my meal asking if the payment was in the check box. I stopped eating my meal and put my visa in there and she came back right away and picked it up. She just picked it up and didn't ask if we needed anything else. I was going to order a pazookie but couldn't. The burger was amazing and tasted great but the service was really bad."
Olive D.,"Woodland, CA",63,9,1,1.0,5/22/2016,"AWFUL BRUNCH AND MANAGER EXERIENCE...I just had the worst experience here. My sister and I came to eat brunch for the first time at this establishment. I ordered the french toast combo and it took a while to get the food the server even looked surprised that the order didn't arrive after 30 mins of waiting as it was not that busy. The food was cold, bacon tasted like the microwave pre cooked kind and the french toast tasted like cumin. I took one bite of each item and it was awful. We told out waiter Jacob and he was very nice and brought the manager WHO WE DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR-Timothy Onions who was apparently indifferent he literally came and looked at us and after explaining that the food was cold and didn't taste right he basically snatched the food off the table and walked off without even addressing the issue. He didn't come back and we got the bill for my daughters meal. One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Now I'm out here driving around HANGRY at 1pm thanks BJ'S !"
Karen J.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,8,,3.0,3/8/2017,"The service could have been better. We waited 20 minutes for a table when there were empty tables that had not been cleaned. In fact, the entire time we dined, we noticed that it took forever for tables to be cleaned. Nice wait staff, they may need more or more training."
Johnny S.,"Sacramento, CA",17,68,35,4.0,1/1/2016,Great bar service.. Bar area atmosphere is generally fun. Great place to catch up with friends or co workers. Sports games are played on the tv. Try a Washington apple or any of the whiskeys. Maybe even a wild turkey tea (really good)
Kelly M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/6/2016,"I took my Kid's there on Labor Day. My dining experience was disappointing. The service we received was very uninspiring. I'll start with the positive first. The root beer rib appetizer was very good. My kids ordered from the kids menu which they enjoyed. I ordered the bacon cheese burger medium. It came well done and the patty was very dry. The menu stated the burgers come ""loaded."" All mine had was one iceberg lettuce leaf. I had to ask for pickles and I used the cole slaw from the rib platter on my burger. Tomato, onion, and pickles would have been nice with out having to ask for it.  And it came out luke warm. Overall it was a very bland experience."
Kevin M.,"Sacramento, CA",25,61,,5.0,12/29/2016,"We have come to this BJ's for years and never have we experienced what we experienced tonight. We arrived like any other time and were told it was going to be a 30 min wait. We went off to the side and sat down near the To Go entrance. I grabbed a beer while we were waiting and while talking to my wife about 5 min later a very upbeat lady asked if we were waiting to be sat. We said yes and she said well why don't I just sit you here, there's no one sitting there. We thanked her and she asked for our name so she could take us off the list. As she brought our menus to us and our 3 children I asked her name and she replied Amy I'm the on shift manager. She was so pleasant. Next our server greeted us (Michael F.). He as well was so accommodating and went well out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. Went above and beyond to find our kids mandarin oranges as well.  Thank you for the two great employees that made this visit to BJ's better than any other."
Jennie O.,"Concord, CA",5,58,57,2.0,8/16/2015,"I came in with my family on a saturday night. I started ordering while pointing to a bunch of items on the happy hour menu on the tables. But, bjs does not have happy hour on saturday..  So when I got my tab, it was 80 dollars... I do not mind paying for what we recieved... But if a customer is holding, pointing, and ordering off the happy hour menu.... Shouldn't the waiter let them know that they do not have happy hour on saturdays? I guess not, everyone at Bjs are just in it for the tip. Higher the bill, the more tip i guess."
Helen B.,"Sacramento, CA",10,119,237,3.0,10/31/2015,BJ has offered a healthy menu which is the best move got them.  I love the salmon w quinoa and asparagus it was so delicious.  I already knew that their pizza is the best.  Customer service it was okay but not excellent.  Like I ordered strawberry margarita and didn't get it until I asked for it.  Overall it was not bad.
