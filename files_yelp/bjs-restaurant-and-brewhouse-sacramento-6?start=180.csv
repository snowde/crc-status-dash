TRACY R.,"Sacramento, CA",584,680,856,4.0,10/15/2012,"If there is a game (football in particular) the bar has Happy Hour prices!!  It was Saturday, the BF was feeling old, and I'm pretty sure coming here has solidified the fact that we are now suburbanites.   It was after 8pm and the bar had people, but it wasn't overly packed so we were seated right away.  Service was informative and friendly. The food:   We ordered the mini pizza; that originally is like $10, but during HH it's half off!  Yeah..$5!!!  Totally worth it.  I don't think I can order this menu item now for more than $5.  It was good, but it was small.....$5 small. We also ordered 10 chicken wings.  Get the Garlic Parmesan wings and you won't regret it!!!  Soo good!  Wish we ordered all 10 wings Garlic Parmesan, but the bf wanted to try the Sweet Teriyaki Glaze.  The bf had 3 beers while I had 3 light Mojitos.  Turned out to be a great date night :)"
Malia H.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/4/2016,My fiancé and I are huge fans of BJ's however we left pretty unhappy this past weekend. Before we even got to the restaurant my fiancé had already planned out what he was going to order(spaghetti and meatballs)  and our waitress tells us that there were no more meatballs and for him to order something else ?? We were both completely dumb founded! Even the waitress was confused as to why the kitchen ran out of meatballs. Did not make any sense at all.  So fiancé ended up ordering the deep dish ziti which we weren't completely impressed by. The flavor was not great nor did they add enough basil . If anything they added a pinch of the basil even though the menu says they top it off .  Overall experience was okay. Bjs has kinda gone downhill with some of their dishes . I guess they made up for it at the end with our yummy pizooki .
Kim M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",12,8,,2.0,1/30/2017,"Wouldn't do a reservation for a party of 7. Had to speak to a manager that let us do it. Then we arrived and the hostess was snarky and told us they "" don't do reservations"" and that it was call ahead and that we would have a 20 min wait ..... exactly what we were trying to avoid as we had a baby. Food was good once seated ..  but was stomach sick later at night..."
Marnie W.,"San Ramon, CA",12,2,,5.0,7/30/2016,"Stopped in for lunch after the Joyce Meyer conference at Sleep Train Arena. Service was exceptional! Very friendly staff, great atmosphere. Ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with a side dish of quinoa salad, DELICIOUS!! So flavorful I can't stop talking about it (I never get this excited over food). Highly recommended! Thank you Sacramento and BJ'S for being such great hosts!"
Miguel B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,2,1.0,2/8/2017,"This place is the worst place you can ever go to for any occasion !!! I came with my family for my daughters birthday and we wait an hour to get seated. After seating, ordering our food we had to wait an hour to first get our salad with out no utensils. I definitely feel like they were trying to make this some type of joke or something so I sadly had to tell my daughter we had to leave the place due to their service and way of treating us.. hope no one else ever get this experience.. I talk to the manager and she try to cover up and say our order was placed 15 before we started to get up to go. Even though I timed it exactly as I watch the Sacramento kings game thru there quarters. The manager did not have no respect for what had happen to me and my family. So I just had to get up and go else where so please be careful with this place and the management there. Would never recommend to anyone or wish this upon anyone either.  If I could I give then NO STARS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Diomedes L.,"Roseville, CA",229,182,2464,4.0,5/26/2015,"I ve been to different BJ 's but this one near the natomas here in Sacramento was good.  We have just finished helping my mother in law move stuff from her home (the heavy bulky stuff ) and we were sort of tired and hungry.  There were 14 of us from 6 -60+ lol.   We didn't made reservations so we waited for a little bit but not too long.  Just like any other BJ franchise, the ambience is casual and sporty.  I know they have happy hours but I don't know if it applies during weekend.  I had their top sir loin steak, medium well, it was pretty dry and bland.  The veggies and the rice pilaf was more tastier.  Our servers and I say ""servers"" (there were 2 of them) was pretty attentive and proactive with what we needed.  We have ordered some appetizers prior to our main meal and it was pretty tasty.  It didn't take that long for them to prepare and serve it to us.  I rated this BJ higher than I would usually because of the service ,  and the friendly host/server.  I don't really expect that from a big franchise such as BJ 's"
Rich R.,"Sacramento, CA",1344,145,221,4.0,12/7/2014,"Great place for a group or just 2 people.  The food is very good and a great selection of beer. I really liked the ""Nutty Brewnette"" it was a dark tasty beer! Also the taster Pazookie was killer! If you're not into calories then this is the desert for you. Keep inning its a large serving good for at least 6 people!"
Michelle M.,"Sacramento, CA",2,172,8,4.0,11/13/2016,"My husband and I stopped by for dinner. We have never been impressed with the food or the service in the past at this location so we rarely visit.  We shared the calamari appetizer, kale salad and spaghetti and meatballs.  Everything was delicious and the service was very good.  Not sure what has changed, maybe new management but we will try it again soon rather than later."
Tommy K.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/22/2017,Well it started off good as we got our drinks and everything. The service was very good but the burger I got was very bad. I'm not sure if the late night burger was suppose to be sour. That is not a taste to be in a burger. I had food poisoning from that burger the next day. Just a heads up on that burger. PLEASE AVOID THE LATE NIGHT BURGER AT ALL TIMES. SOUR AND FOOD POISONING.
Nancy C.,"San Diego, CA",3,27,8,1.0,12/31/2016,We decided to eat at BJ but the service was horrible we were seated right away but we didn't get any waiter or waitress at all. I don't know if BJ will ever get back there customer service. I've always enjoyed this place in the past and when they first opened. This is my 3rd time being disappointed at their service. The 3rd time is my last and final time I will eat or recommend this place.
MJ S.,"Antelope, CA",0,2,8,4.0,7/1/2015,We were at BJs in time to see the U.S. Women's soccer team beat Germany in the World Cup and quite s few other people had chosen BJs to watch the game. The beer flights were a real good deal and we got two for one happy hour beers so we were happy to find that out when the check came. All and all the beers were great we liked the Oasis and the berry cider beers best. We recommend happy hour here for great beer and great prices!
Kage Love C.,"Roseville, CA",3,26,11,2.0,10/19/2015,Went BJ's last night 10/18/15 and there wasn't any host so we wait it a few min and we decide find a seat ourself....waitress came by and ask up did we need help with a look on her face n the way she use her tone....i just decide to leave the restaurant  Recommended to work on customer services or get fire!
Andy N.,"Chicago, IL",851,1075,3505,4.0,8/7/2012,"On a hot summer day in Sac-town, you become eager to go indoors into a nice, air-conditioned place with a good vibe and good beer.  Fortunately, BJs was able to offer my friend and I a great place to dine in during lunch, and was just the American food fixing I needed after being abroad in Asia for over a year! Four stars for the lunch experience.  For one- this BJs is huge, but can get packed very quickly.  During a weekday lunch ""rush,"" you're almost guaranteed a seat.  They sat us in a small booth for two, with clear views of the large LCD screens above us blasting the London games.  One point for that! The lunch specials were great!  All were roughly $7, and looked delicious. * Fried Chicken Lunch Special ($7)   - a slab of white, chicken meat, breaded and shaped as a country fried steak.  With a generous helping of MASHED POTATOES and corn on the side, this was the perfect ""Welcome Back!"" entree for someone like me. * Avocado Wraps ($8)   - Vegetarian friendly, and made a great appetizer for us!  Six crispy wraps loaded with generous amounts of Californian avocado.  With a tangy dipping sauce on the side, this was to die for. * Chicken Potstickers... to be honest, this wasn't even a part of our order!  Our waitstaff had accidentally served this to us, and were happy enough to give it to on us on the house.  Points for that!  This would never happen in Asia. Add that on with a great pint of beer and we were all set.  The environment was great, our server was nice, and we had an enjoyable time catching up and eating some good food. Parking is available outside in the huge lot.  Shouldn't be a problem at all."
Mai V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,10,2.0,11/7/2015,Service was slow. But I blame myself for coming in on a Saturday  night around 10pm. Took forever to get our check.  Food was cold. Salmon was good but quinoa and vegetables tasted like they were sitting out for awhile.  CA club tasted burnt and avocado  eggrolls undercooked. I had a coupon for the appetizer so can't complain much.
Anne T.,"Sacramento, CA",121,69,17,1.0,5/19/2015,"I've been to this BJs probably between 5-10 times, mostly getting take out for myself and co-workers at work. This BJs location is atrocious for takeout-- they consistently get my orders wrong and make no effort to correct it when I call. At least 3 times, I've picked up my takeout only to arrive back at the office to discover that one or more items have been left out. When I've called BJs to inform them of the missing items, they tell me that I can either A) drive all the way back over for a refund or B) that they will mail me a gift card in the mail. A gift card? Since I either paid with a credit card or cash I expect to be refunded with either a credit to my account or send me a check. What good does a gift card do me?  Not wanting to drive all the way back out there, however, twice I picked option B and told them to mail me a gift card. Guess what? Both times they failed to send me out my refund on a gift card. I called to follow up with managers twice and was told a gift card for my refund would be promptly in the mail. They never came. This is basically tantamount to theft since I never got what I paid for and they never refunded me my money. The last time it happened I did drive back to receive a cash refund (though that does not compensate me for my time and mileage driving over there).  Yes, I probably should have checked out each order but the thing is that when you are picking up take out for a large group of people and are on a tight lunch schedule it is often impractical to check everything thoroughly to make sure that everything is there. This is their job and I expect it to be done correctly. It never is. I'm either missing items and/or the items are not as ordered. The worst part for me though is the lack of making it right by the managers when they get it wrong--specifically in failing to refund my money when I didn't get the item I paid for. I estimate I've lost about $30 in orders I did not receive a refund for from this location. I lost patience in trying to get in contact with them about it but will use the power of the yelp review from hopefully saving others from the experience I have had here. Go somewhere else for takeout, it isn't worth it!"
Mari M.,"Sacramento, CA",164,17,69,5.0,2/14/2015,Loved it...  Even for it being valentine's day the wait was not bad only 30 minutes I was expecting 3 times that the food did not take long to arrive and it was delicious.  The waiter was awesome did not get his name but he is an example of what customer service should be. Overall with the wait and everything we were there for only 2 hours.
Alyssamarie S.,"Sacramento, CA",184,48,17,4.0,1/27/2015,"I usually come here for happy hour and on cheat days when I can actually eat ""bar food"". They have a wide selection of appetizers, flatbread pizzas, salads, burgers, etc. that are all delicious. Something I find unique is that they're very accommodating when it comes to special requests. When I'm in training mode I go on a low carb, high fat diet. I'd ask for substitutions and add more cheese to this and sub for a salad and each time they'd get my order right. Kudos to them. I've had a lot of places mess up my order and have to wait forever for a replacement.  Their crafted alcoholic drinks are okay.. more on the sweet side so I'd recommend an extra shot (or two, if you're feeling adventurous) if you want a buzz. Otherwise wells are always an option... I particularly like this location because the service is always on point whether it's to-go or dine-in."
KiKi W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,80,6,1.0,1/14/2016,"Customer service sucks!! From the minute we sat down until the end of the meal, our server was not very friendly and attentive to our table. His hygiene was also lacking. The manager basically made excuses for the server and didn't really listen to our complaints. Food was mediocre and drinks were weak. Will never eat here again."
Rukhsana M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,1,4.0,12/11/2016,Ordered delivery through Eat24. Timing waa not bad. For not feeling well the pricing for delivery and service was ok (higher side) but good if you can't or don't want to go out. Convenience is the key feature to that! The food was delicious. Especially the gluten free pizza for my daughter. Only thing we didnt like for why I removed 1 star was this Queso thing and corn chips we ordered. We got the meat portion removed but cheese was horrible...too thick and no consistency to grab with chips like it was microwaved cheese in a cup. Not creamy. Hopefully they improve on that.
Duabntxoo Y.,"West Sacramento, CA",38,7,,1.0,1/2/2015,"I would give them no stars if that were an option. I have come here numerous times (giving them the ""oh maybe it was just a bad night to go"" excuse).  And I've had it.  No more. Ever.  Whether it be a dinner for two or a group of 20, horrible service, long 45-1:30 minute waits for food, and I can't forget to say the food comes out cold.  I order steak before and it came out cold, burnt, and it looked like they just took it off the grill, threw it on the plate and put some broccoli on the side. Messy plates and cold food - I can't. Lol.  They didn't even do anything about it.  Don't come here. You'll regret it.  Honestly, at ANY BJ's. (The one in Arden sucks too) I'm sorry but I just really hate this place. Lol."
