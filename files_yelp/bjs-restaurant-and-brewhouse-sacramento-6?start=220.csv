Jennifer G.,"Wahiawa, HI",157,22,6,1.0,11/10/2015,"11/10/15 Should have went with my first instinct and went to BWW like my son asked. We got seated quickly, that was a plus. We have three kids and they wanted to sit us next to a large party where shots were going around so we asked if we could sit a few tables down. ( it was not busy) the hostess stared at us like she was very upset. My husband asked if that was okay because we could tell by the look on her face she was irritated. So we walked to the next table she threw us our menus. Didn't say a word, next our waitress came over not very friendly either. We always use our manners, please and thank you. No your welcome nothing!!! The girl who brought our food out also rude. Maybe it was just a bad night. The food was okay...the wings are always great but everything else I could have made at home and it would have had more flavor. Total waste of money. BJs....is not the same as when it first opened that's for sure. I think the Laguna location is much better. STEP IT UP NATOMAS!!!"
Tim M.,"Sacramento, CA",42,6,,4.0,12/24/2015,Menu looks updated and existing items have been changed a bit for the better. Always love the atmosphere and sitting in the bar watching the TVs.
Alex J.,"Sacramento, CA",100,28,25,3.0,3/16/2015,"2 stars for the service and food. It was slow service and felt like we could have at least been checked on or updated while we waited so long for a pizza and appetizer. The pizza we ordered (create your own with chicken, bacon,  and artichoke hearts) barely had any of the toppings requested but it sure had a lot of tomatoes...  The chicken lettuce wraps we ordered for the first time here. Way too over priced for the amount of food received.   This is not the first time I've been here but the last few times here I've received similar service without the place being that packed and many servers on the floor. The experience here at Natomas BJs is declining and that's unfortunate. Hope it turns around. Picked it up to 3 stars only because our server recieved assistance from another who realized she was really busy. That helped.. go team work."
John D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/25/2016,"I decided to us BJ's pick up for the first time.  We  ordered the Clam Chowder Soup, BJ Favorite Pizza with no tomatoes and the Meatballs Spaghetti with extra red sauce.  When picking it up, the pizza was cooked wrong and so remade.   30 minutes later, it was correctly brought out to us and we left.  Once home, we realized the Clam Chowder and Spaghetti had been sitting out since the original wrong pizza and so was dry and cold.  I called to complain and the Manager could have cared less, cut me off many times, and was obviously too busy to care.  Plus, I later put two and two together and realized that the cooks never read the extra instructions as the tomatoes were put on the pizza and the Spaghetti did not have extra sauce.  This is how BJ's lost not only a pick-up guest, but as a result of their failure and uncaring attitude, a regular dine-in guest."
Carlo V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,26,10,4.0,1/28/2016,"This is a great place to go on date or even to have a drink and kick it! This inside is real upscale and modern! They also have sports on on every tv so u won't miss a game!! The food is very good and the menu has a big selection of a wide variety of food,drinks and desserts! This place is really good for a date so wear your best outfit!!"
Patrick Y.,"Sacramento, CA",1138,118,1257,3.0,10/6/2011,"Experience today was less than stellar... Food was good, but service was super slow.  My coworkers had to wait 20 minutes for their refill of unlimited soup and salad.  It wasn't a tactic for my coworkers to become full as food settled in their bellies.  I know this because the manager ended up comping both orders of unlimited soup and salad. The manager ended up confessing that the kitchen was backed up and delayed in producing orders.   I'll go back because I love their Caeser Salad with Blackend Salmon!!!"
Kristen Q.,"Sacramento, CA",1,19,6,3.0,3/12/2014,"The first time I ate here was on my birthday in 2012(I had been wanting to eat here for forever!). I ordered the Angel Hair Classico with grilled chicken and it was amazing! Dish was quite large I couldn't finish it all. The sauce was really light but had lots of flavor and the BJ's garlic bread was like homemade! Service was pretty good, quick and seemed concerned about our needs. We got the triple pazookie for dessert and it was AMAZING! Had a great experience here. 2014 UPDATE: I went here a couple nights ago and some things have changed. The woman who seated us seemed in a rush and a little rude. We sat for about 10-15 minutes without anybody giving us a menu or asking if we wanted drinks. I ordered the same dish as last time and was really disappointed. The noodles were mixed with sun dried tomatoes and steame broccoli. There was absolutely no flavor so I asked the waiter and they explained that the menu item recipes have changed. My boyfriends meal was also a bit tasteless so the waiter immediately offered to bring out some extra sauces for us. We both got alfredo sauce and it made the meal better. Bread and chicken was still amazing. Even still, I'm not sure if I would come here again. I was really disappointed."
Scott F.,"Sacramento, CA",504,455,239,4.0,6/26/2014,"It's a chain, so if you like the food at any other b.j.'s this location follows through.  Love having one in my part of town, service is always friendly,  and the late night happy hour is a good deal. What has been bringing me back lately has been getting points through the rewards (even though you have to get a lot of points for anything really good) and the new app which let's you preorder your meal and even prepay if want to. This is great when you are short on time and super convenient.  And you can do it for most locations. I think it's brilliant and will have this in mind a lot more."
Cindy S.,"Sacramento, CA",461,489,436,4.0,11/20/2012,"If there were half stars I'd probably rate BJ's more appropriately at 3.5. The thing that makes it hard to review BJ's is its a chain restaurant. Food wise the menu is extensive and they try to toss in some ethnic foods (which some are good) but really its probably best to stick with salad, appetizers, a burger, sandwich and fries or their popular pizza. Last night I stopped in for dinner and the Niner game with 9 other friends. Service was attentive, our waitress checked on us so many times when we weren't ready we decided to let her know we'd flag her down when we decided. The restaurant wasn't super packed but got busier as the night progressed and the Niners vs Bears game was on. My boyfriend and I shared the new Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza and nachos. The pizza was really good the nachos were okay. I enjoyed the flavors and amount of toppings on the pizza. It seemed liked there could have been more toppings on the nachos for the amount of chips. Also the waitress actually forgot to put our nacho order in but they came out pretty soon after we reminded her. Actually for a party of 10 all the food came out pretty quick. As always I enjoyed my Berry Burst Cider and look forward to trying the Irish Root Beer (my friend ordered) next time. I would say BJ's is the best chain restaurant in Natomas. They've got a pretty big bar area (compared to the one in Vacaville), lots of tvs, good drink selection, a family friendly environment, good food and service."
Brian P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,28,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Disappointing experience over the weekend at this Natomas BJs. Party of four waited 20min on a Sat night, not a problem, but trying to get a drink at the bar was near impossible. Waitress for order wrong (twice) and wasn't attentive. Seemed understaffed for a busy weekend night. Food came out very staggered so we all are at different times. Waitress was very disingenuous and cheesy-polite. Bartenders called me ""boss"" instead of ""sir""."
Andy G.,"Fiddletown, CA",2,16,,4.0,1/14/2016,Was going to give one star... Manager Ron turned it around as did waitress.  Hostess is rude and should not be working any job that is customer facing.... The manager was sincere and appologized and kept checking on us.  He is an excellent manager and needs commendation .  Thank you Ron and Desiree... Made a bad situation right
Phil C.,"Orangevale, CA",74,22,16,1.0,6/18/2014,"I have always been a fan of BJ's. Having said that, when  I think of take out on the fly I think of this restaurant.  So this time after losing 5 unsuccessful tries to place an order on the phone and 10 minutes on hold to get disconnected it was time to go in and place an order at the to go counter. I'm that determined to get dinner.  When I arrive I grab a menu to confirm the name of the items I was going to order. I was told that it would be a minute after an order was given out. I agreed knowing it would buy me some time to glance at other items like dessert.  The 2nd order was given out to other take our customers. One minute after the 3rd order was called for other customers. I understand, I work in customer service too. I know the importance of getting customers out. I also know the importance of getting orders into the kitchen be able to reduce wait time. We have all been there, hurry up and get the order in to wait less.  When the 4th order is called and I haven't been asked what I want to order I pay more attention. It's been 6 minutes and still no time for me. I'm still looking at the TVs at the bar holding a menu. There is a young man that walked in that's greeted immediately, asked if he's picking up, after he confirms his name the girl leaves to go check out back.  5 minutes later she returns with his food and still no time for me to place my order. I'm now wondering if I missed something.  I guess waiting 11 minutes to place a take out order is normal now! I yelp the hours for chipotle. After all we pay more and leave a tip at bjs and not chipotle.  I didn't want to stick around now and place an order, wait for my food and get home to eat. I would've been eating at 11pm.  Chipotle closes at 10pm and when I walked in at 957pm the greeted me with a smile. Sadly I've been leaving nothing for a tip at chipotle.      Time to re-evaluate my loyalty towards bjs."
David S.,"Sacramento, CA",4,11,1,3.0,8/14/2016,"Food is good but service is terrible. The ""quick"" lunch takes 30 minutes plus to get your food... I dont understand why it takes so long."
Dave T.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",55,12,2,1.0,7/27/2016,"Came here sat july 23rd (day after my bday) for lunch... lets just say should gone to somewhere else... 4 adults and a 3yr old plus 6yr old.  We ordered the kids food first which was just an olive kids pizza and an olive and pepperoni.  Pizza came out both with olive and pepperoni and our ""wonderful"" waitress Stephine.. yes that in quotes, had the nerve to tell my sister to pick it off because it was gona taken 15mins for new one.. No apology or anything. Next up to the adults me and brother got our food just fine.  Wife ordered the brisket sandwhich remove all meat add veggie patty.  My sister in law order same thing remove all pork and beef sub chicken.  My wive's veggie sandwhich had bacon in it which we were already joking was going to come out wrong.  And sis in law had both brisket and bacon.  Again stephine *employee of month* said not her fault kitchen messed up no apology or nothing!! I had to call manager over to tell him hey i own my own business this wont be acceptable in any business.. we there for 50mins and manager had to refill my drink.  He was real nice and removed all charges for food that was wrong but still never even got a sorry from waiteress"
John A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,1,1.0,2/27/2016,"The service was ok. We only saw original waitress when she took our order. Then it was three different people in the hour we were there. I ordered the black and Bleu  burger. It came with bacon, Bleu cheese, grilled onions and a garlic aoili. The bacon was raw and nasty, almost NO Bleu cheese on it, no garlic mayo, and one tomato, and it was the end piece that still had a core in it. Thus place has gone way downhill. Will not dine here again."
Dee B.,"Sacramento, CA",586,30,91,5.0,8/12/2015,"I love this place, late night happy hour from 9 to close is absolutely amazing. I'm secretly in love with the bartender Steve ;)"
Alex T.,"Sacramento, CA",1316,1002,6438,4.0,5/1/2015,i had a great experience coming to this location. i had came here with my family after the barry manilow concert. we were sat down quick. then we were asked what we like to drink. we had plenty of time looking at the menu and deciding what we want. we were pretty quick about it since we hungry after the concert from resisting on the popcorn and nachos and you know the arm and leg kind of junk food snacks. anyways it was late at night maybe around 11pm and it was still packed. it happened to be on a week night and i thought maybe they had happy hour after 9 but maybe it was over and they said no not for tonight i said ok.  anyways we ordered a small sized pizza i believe it was the great white shark pizza. next we ordered their new dish of fajita nachos with beef i believe. the cajun chicken pasta with fettecune noodles. also one kids meal with chicken nuggets and fries.  the food wait wasn't long til we got the food. the nachos came out first and we were disappointed how the cheese stuck together and wasn't the regular cheesy dip. i knew the price we paid of course they used the real cheese to melt it but it was stuck in a whole bunch. next the pizza came out and we each had a pieces and they were big slices and were deep dish which was awesome with some ranch dip. next we had the pasta and omg this was the most amazing dish in our table. the pasta noodles were on point for the texture and mainly the taste to the sauce was good and chicken was well seasoned and char grilled too. it also came with 2 garlic bread sticks and they were so crunchy and tasty too. the kids meal was just plain chicken nuggets with fries and nothing to special with that since it was for a kid.  the service was great and attentive and came and check up on us. the server has to come back multiple times refilling the water since we were all dehydrated form all the dancing beforehand. i did have some craving for their alcohol drinks such as the strawberry splash but i was with family and i was the driver so of course i had to refrain myself from getting something with alcohol. i think the only thing missing with my meal was a ice cold beer or the strawberry splash haha. anyways hope this review help in sort of a way and had you imagined being their with me dining hehe. have a great day and thanks for reading.
Mason B.,"Sacramento, CA",42,43,110,3.0,12/3/2014,We had a party of 19 for lunch. 5 did not pre-order the food. They couldn't keep it all straight and screwed up on the orders. The food is great! (When they could get the order right). BJ's may not be the best place to take a large party.
Grace B.,"Sacramento, CA",265,641,467,4.0,5/20/2014,We attended for dinner after finals with my friends and just wanted to celebrate. We were a party of 6 people. I ordered the chicken pita tacos. I enjoyed my dish. The quinoa looking dish tasted okay. It was a little different for my palate . I personally cook quinoa for myself. I'm just not used to eating it the way they prepared it. But the service was great. My waitress was very accommodating. She kept returning and refilling our drinks and always asked us if we were doing fine. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. They were also nice enough to let us sit there after dinner and talk. We were enjoying each others time and celebrating the end of the semester. It was great food with great friends having a great time.
scott s.,"Sacramento, CA",29,56,8,4.0,11/19/2014,"Been to several BJs in N.CA., this was some of the best service i've experienced here. Mikayla, petite server, took very good care of our group of 10. patient, competent, calm, water frequently, orders perfect. Split the check willing, even looked up our acct. for  rewards points for us."
