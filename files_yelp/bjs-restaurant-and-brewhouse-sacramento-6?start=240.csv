Calloway C.,"Sacramento, CA",22,108,365,4.0,11/1/2014,Today's meal was surprisingly tasty! Usually we come here just for drinks and small bites! Tonight we had a meal and have no complaints. Join the club to get free stuff. Pizookies are always awesome!
Julianna B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,16,,5.0,2/2/2016,"Great place, clean atmosphere, great food!  We ordered a large meal and the order came right away. Our server was nice and tended to our every need. The food was priced reasonably and the drinks were on point."
Sami W.,"Sacramento, CA",172,38,21,2.0,4/12/2014,"Had a pretty dissatisfied experience. Inattentive waitress, had to ask 3 times for a glass of water, 2 times for a refill on coffee. Asked for a knife, and never received it. When i asked questions for clarification, she wasnt really listening, never answered my question, and left me more confused. Other timed when i was talking to her, she walked away before i was even done talking. She also wasn't very friendly, apologetic for errors, or attentive to us. My burger didn't come the way I intended it, and when I asked for some different toppongs, my waitress went and helpped 2 other tables, before bringing me my toppings. By that time,  my burger was cold, I had to send it back.  The blue cheese dressing on my salad was overly sweet. My mom's mushrooms came out cold, and the price for that and a side salad were overly pricey.  She did take the burger off my bill, but in return I didnt get lunch, but by that time I was not really hungry,  and my family had already finished their meal. Also, by the end of the whole experience, my mom was crying. I spoke with the manager, and he was very nice, and took off nearly the whole bill."
Jose B.,"Merced, CA",0,19,2,5.0,7/19/2015,"Excellent restaurant with excellent food. I've love bjs ever since the first time I had it. My preferred dish is the New Orleans jambalaya, but I also enjoy the pizza. The freshly brewed beer is also very delicious. I am always recommending bjs to everyone I know."
Tina K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/8/2016,"One of the worse experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. We had a party of 8 and were told it was going to be about an hour wait, you can't call ahead  for a party larger then 6.  After waiting for 50 minutes we asked how much longer and were told the table was being cleaned. After another 10 minutes and still not called we asked what was going on. The manager came over smiling almost laughing saying we have not been waiting long just relax we will get you seated? After waiting for 1 hour and 23 minutes we were taken to a booth that fit maybe. 6 average size people, after we asked where everyone was going to sit we were given another booth for the remainder of our party. 4 people in each booth sitting back to back. At that point we ended up walking out and had a great dinner at Casa Romos next door."
Dave K.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",10,19,143,4.0,10/23/2014,Great happy hour menu. also the regular menu is decent priced as well. the customer service can use some improvement. but overall a great place for good food.
Angelica G.,"Sacramento, CA",3,29,5,1.0,10/21/2015,"I order a small ranch chicken bacon pizza for $15 pretty expensive for a pizza. The pizza had barley any chicken and it looked like someone slapped the toppings on it. Tastes like too much salt, quality sucked! I'm never eating at BJs!"
Shane O.,"Folsom, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/13/2016,Never had a bad meal at this restaurant. Great atmosphere beer and food. Servers were on their A game. Will be back
Joe P.,"Pearl City, HI",145,2,2,3.0,12/8/2015,"I thought the salmon was good, the side veggies were a bit too soft and appeared to have dried out under the lamp but over all it was good."
B J.,"Carmichael, CA",98,7,7,3.0,12/5/2014,I went here with my dad I had I believe was called a shrimp scampi pasta or something along that....I absolutely loved the way it was prepared... it was like a dance of flavours in my mouth.....  My father had the same thing after we left my dad kept wanting to go back and get it again unfortunately he never got a chance to...... Maybe one of these days I will go back for the both of us.....
Todd B.,"Olivehurst, CA",0,73,,3.0,11/1/2014,"The place is clean. Nice atmosphere. Big selection of food. There is a microbrew if you are into that. I didn't have any this time but have had their beer in the past and they are pretty good. They have a sampler for their beers which is s nice touch. The food came out, eventually, and it was good. We ordered a pizza for the first time here and I have to say it was a lot better than most. These are the reasons I gave this place three stars.  The problems are the prices and the speed of service. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. The speed of taking our order, getting the food and then getting the bill paid was very slow. Over two hours from the time we walked in the front door till we walked out. And the prices are a lot higher than comparable restaurants. So, taking Ll this into consideration I really believe this is the last time we will come here. Too many other choices."
Sarah Q.,"Sacramento, CA",2,20,19,4.0,10/30/2014,Best pizza!! Yummy and staff is ok at times a little difficult! Pizza makes up for it tho
Gloria H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",68,9,,4.0,1/3/2016,"Had dinner at the Main Street location in Huntington Beach.  Whitney was our waitress and she was very engaging and very good at her job...great service.  Table was dirty with dried food, and we had to ASK for napkins and flatware when our food came and we couldn't eat it.  That's why I gave it 4 stars...We had fried calamari appetizer, 2 drinks, Bacardi dragon berry, and strawberry-lime refresher (very refreshing), and strong, flatbread pizza, Pepperoni Extreme pizza, and loved the NEW root beer glazed (5) short ribs, tender and came with a spicy slaw, just right for a small plate meal."
Shelby C.,"Chico, CA",47,30,2,1.0,1/3/2016,I went for morning brunch and got pieces of someone's lunch hidden in my pancake. I would rather eat a meal off an airplane. This place is sick.
Brandon S.,"Sacramento, CA",19,7,,4.0,11/21/2015,Love the Jeremiah red! Pretty good food for the price. A very cool thing they offer is every quarter of the year they do a beer and food pairing. Really good experience! They definitely treat you well. Just be sure to RSVP.
Ginger S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,63,8,3.0,8/11/2015,"Busy Place...dimmed setting, pretty clean except restrooms were messy when i arrived...bar was packed for happy hours which was our reason to go...so my guest & i decided to still dine there on the dining floor....got sat immediately but i think our servers were lagging a bit...maybe due to midday switching over shifts but it did take a long while for someone to take our beverage order...then food order  anyways food came out quick...our experience was meehhh so so, needed sauces napkins ect but couldnt find our server.....server didnt check up on us only to give us the bill....wont be back for a while."
Fancy N.,"San Francisco, CA",175,132,47,1.0,8/8/2015,"I come here for lunch or dinner often and the majority of the times I get the worst service from some of these servers. Infrequently getting great/mediocre service. One young server worked a late shift and I'm not sure if she was having a horrible night or had other stuff going on in her life but she was not all there at work. She forgot to bring our drinks out and after an hour of waiting for our food we find out that she forgot to put in our food order. Had to talk to the manager and although he apologized and comp'd just the appetizer we ordered (should have comp'd the whole meal cause the visit as a whole was horrible), he was defending his waitress instead with me instead of focusing on making the situation a better one. Im starting to hate this place."
Onecalblonde O.,"Sacramento, CA",8,40,12,3.0,9/30/2014,"I like BJ's food. It's good and consistent. They are getting 3 stars instead of 4 because of their service. I don't write reviews on chain restaurants often because I'm not sure if anyone cares. Any BJ's I've ever been to is always busy no matter what time or day. I have just never received truly great service here (as with a lot of chain restaurants). Sometimes the servers are very personable, however still aren't present in their sections as much as they should be. I feel management or corporate gives these servers too large of a section to give optimum service. So basically when I come here (and I mean any BJ's cuz I have been to a few, and it's always the same), I'm coming for the food and not the service.  Some menu favorites of mine... The flat bread pizzas, the Cobb salad, the wedge salad, the sandwiches (with either thin or wedge fries-both delicious), and the pizzas. Plus the Pizookie dessert of course;) Cocktails aren't very good, nor is their liquor selection. I'm not a beer drinker, but I hear their beers are good, which makes sense since they brew them."
Emme A.,"Leander, TX",23,43,,4.0,8/6/2014,"I was visiting Natomas and took a friend, her daughter and granddaughters here for dinner. I go to the ones in the Austin area all the time, so I knew what to expect. I had the Parmesan-crusted Chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes. It was delish! My friend raved about the chicken tortilla soup. The kids seemed satisfied with their spaghetti and chicken strips. Good food! What made the dinner for me was our waitress Mia J. She was patient while we made our decisions from the menu. She helped us get little ones situated. And, she served us with a smile. If I'm ever in Natomas again, I will try to make a return visit."
Terry M.,"Jacksonville, FL",14,97,7,1.0,7/15/2014,I have dined at other BJs before and had great experiences I neglected to post about and this must be my punishment. Absolutely terrible. I went with the Shrimp Scampi and the shrimp was terrible and obviously from a frozen bag.  I didn't even eat it and the waitress never asked why.
