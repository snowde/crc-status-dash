Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57,2.0,1/12/2012,"Wow! We had an absolutely terrible experience here, customer service wise.  We called ahead for a group of 7 and the table was ready just when they said it would be. That is the end of the positives. They appeared to be very busy and the waitress was definitely not lazy BUT the customer service was seriously unsatisfactory. So much so that the manager had to go around to various tables to apologize and explain that they had ""no shows"" in the kitchen.   After taking everyone's order, the waitress came back 5 minutes later to tell us that they were out of one of the items. The disturbing thing was that she didn't come back for 10 minutes to take the order again. Salads appetizers were delivered in two rounds. Half the table got theirs first. The other half got theirs 10 minutes later. If you're still with me and doing the math then you can see that we have been sitting her over 40 minutes by now. The one thing that really disturbed me (and I thought was pretty unforgivable) was that they did not give the 4 year old ANYTHING! They were slow (and they knew it) and nothing was served to the little one...even though he had ordered applesauce as his side dish. His mom had to ASK for it. The little angel never said a peep. His grouchy aunties and uncles were acting up more than he was.  Pizza was good as was the other dishes ordered by my companions (forgive me for not memorizing them). The much touted Pizookie was tasty. I liked the red velvet the best with cookies and cream a close second. I have to say though that it was slightly overrated. I didn't like how it stuck to the bottom of the metal pan. Isn't there a better way to make it? Food was decent but I would likely not return simply because of the service. If you are that short staffed in the kitchen, or elsewhere, you should close a section or get in the kitchen and cook yourself. Period."
Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17,4.0,10/25/2013,"It was my younger son's 2nd birthday and we were at the Sleeptrain for Disney On Ice. My youngest is probably the pickiest eater of the family, so for his birthday we wanted to get something we knew he would eat, so we decided to get his favorite foods of pizza, cookies and ice cream. We came for a slightly late lunch and they said they had to take a couple of minutes to get our table together. Once we were seated we ordered quickly. My mom and husband got small salads to start and the boys got applesauce. I decided I really didn't want pizza so I got their ahi tuna salad as an entree.  My salad was large, very fresh and full of good things, although I asked for them to remove the red peppers and they did not. They were big enough that I was able to easily pick them out. The tuna on it wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was decent and I liked the pickled cucumber in the salad. My family all loved the pizza and ate the majority of it with some leftovers to take home. Then the best part, on your birthday they will give you a Pizookie with ice cream and a candle in it.  I remember back in the day they used to give you a full-size Pizookie for your birthday, but now they give you a mini one. That was okay, since my son ate most of it on his own and the rest of us ordered another large one to split.  He was in cookie and ice cream heaven. The Pizookie is basically a deep dish cookie that they bring out hot with ice cream on it. They have several different types like a basic chocolate chip, a triple chocolate, a red velvet, oreo, etc. The full size ones are good for sharing and will feed three or four people. They also have a sampler, which is three of the mini ones, which is nice if you want to try several flavors. Although you still probably want to split it, unless you have a major sweet tooth.  Lunchtime seems to be busy, but not too crowded, whereas dinner at any BJ's particularly on the weekend can have significant wait times. Come early or be prepared to wait."
Mathew V.,"Sacramento, CA",6,14,28,4.0,6/30/2014,Lunch menu has a lot of variety & I was surprised at how affordable the prices were for a franchise. The Waitress we had was very welcoming and stirred up great conversation. She also knew the menu well. Would I go back? Definitely will
Karlie T.,"Berkeley, CA",3,31,33,5.0,6/1/2015,"Came here for lunch with my sisters, food was good but THE SERVICE was AMAZING! Nathan.E our waiter was polite and very very attentive this is the kind of service I will always pay extra for! Roseville BJs that man needs a raise! Actually this is the second time I have been here and their customer service is just excellent!"
Cristina B.,"Redwood City, CA",255,714,89,3.0,1/21/2014,"Friendly service, great pizza and surprisingly delicious seared ahi salad. I skipped the pizookie on this visit, but its a definite try if you've never had one. Its too much for one person generally speaking though, so order it for a group."
Steph G.,"Sacramento, CA",560,790,1237,2.0,2/15/2012,"Nobody puts baby in the corner... This rating is solely for my last visit. As expected, it was slightly busier due to two facts; 1) It was a Saturday night, 2) It was almost post Kings game time. We didn't mind waiting at the bar, Tim & Sean poured generously while we waited for our buzzer to go off. As we are being guided through the restaurant, we literally are seated in the very back corner of the restaurant, right by the little server cubby. Bad luck of the draw, sucks to be us, right?!? Then to top it off, our server had a stanky personality. He was grumpy, barely audible, grunted instead of speaking, and was curmudgeon like. I can deal with these last two things...but the deal breaker was that they were completely out of Peanut Butter Pizookie. These are literally my grown woman's crack, I live to eat these things any time I walk in to a BJ's. Our server came up and said ""...we are out of peanut butter,"" no remorse, no consoling, no customer service. He didn't ask if we still wanted anything, he just walked away. About 5 minutes later he dropped the check on our table, again, without a word being said. Our actual meals were not with their normal goodness either. I hope it was just an off night, because generally I absolutely love BJ's. The Mac-n-Cheese was extremely dry. Our Black & Bleu burger was came with the aioli when asked for on the side. Nothing was going in our favor, on top of a bad King's loss. Needless to say, our curmudgeon of a server left a less than pleasant taste in our mouth for this location. Stanky server = stanky review! **I will attempt another visit, I hope they get their act together!!"
Jay R.,"San Francisco, CA",171,319,46,2.0,6/18/2012,"Fact: I love eating at BJ's. I've been to about 4 or 5 different ones in my life and the food is normally fantastic.  Normally.  Maybe this restaurant was having an off day or something, but I think I'd rather go to another BJ's in the area. Our pizza was cold, food and drinks came out very late (even when the crowd died out), and most of the food felt like it had something missing compared to all of the other BJ's restaurants I've been too. The red velvet pizookie was the only redeeming factor (mmmm pizookie). Maybe I'll give this place another try, but I'd rather make the trip to the one in Arden or even the one in Vacaville."
Meghan M.,"Sacramento, CA",73,117,,3.0,4/4/2014,"I normally come to this BJ's if I want a quick bite to eat and maybe a drink. I usually ALWAYS sit at the bar even if i'm not drinking. The evening bartenders are always fantastic and remember me every time I come in. It is amazing though how much staff can change from the ""day "" crew to the ""evening "" crew.... but I digress... This is an overall review of the place, since I have been here many times over.... The food is normally good, not great but good. It satisfies whatever hunger craving I am having at the time. The portions are large and served hot. The drinks, whether alcoholic or non-alcoholic, are good as well.  The service at the bar is fast and generally really good (night crew). The bartenders are attentive and get everything done quickly and correctly. If you are sitting at a table, however, expect a little longer of a wait and that confused look when servers walk by trying to see who the tray of pot stickers they have in their hand belongs too. My gripe right now is that they have raised their prices. I will not pay $17 for salmon at BJ""s, I just won't."
Jen B.,"West Sacramento, CA",4,6,,4.0,11/21/2013,"Good:  - We went there on a weekend during dinner hours. No waiting time. - Huge place, nicely decorated and tables separated at decent distance.  - Service was good. The waitress offered beer samples to try before we made a decision. Drink and food came up fast, not as some other reviewer experienced (or we were just lucky?!). - Food came in huge portions. - Most stunning: kids menu. We ordered fish and chips. The food portion is big enough for adult! Our waitress suggested Kids dessert instead of full price one and she was right. A bargain @ two bucks 50 cents, it looks big and delicious.  No so good: - food is so so My mom's salmon is overcooked. and my salad pretty bland. If one is not too picky about food this is definitely a good place for family to relax."
Jennifer F.,"Livermore, CA",47,367,322,3.0,12/31/2013,"Typical BJ's.  We came here on a Friday evening.  Had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated, but that was expected.  They were pretty busy, but seemed to be moving through people pretty quickly. We ordered a kid's grilled cheese for our daughter and a ""deep dish"" pizza for my hubby & I to share.  While it tasted fine, I don't think I'd call it deep dish.  It was just piled with toppings.  We also ordered a pizookie for dessert.  Yummmmmm! They make their own root beer, which I got, since they didn't have Coke.  My root beer didn't come with any ice though.  Is that normal?  Not sure... Didn't ask, but it was fine. Plenty of parking, but in a busy shopping center."
Akaash P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/24/2014,Pizookie's are par none.  Do not leave bj's without ordering one haha.  Also their pizza is better than most pizza parlor's.  We'll worth it!
Cathy C.,"San Francisco, CA",280,125,61,4.0,4/30/2012,"Last weekend was my first time at BJ's and I know why so many of my friends like it :) My bf and I got to BJ's around 7:45 on a Saturday night and we barely waited (WOO). I super appreciate the seating the waiter let us have also...the half circle couch tables (lol sorry I don't know what they're called) instead of the dinky table for 2. Those seats are usually for 3+ but he still seated us there on a crowded Saturday night! Yay for our waiter! We first ordered drinks - bf got a beer that I didn't try and I was stuck between two fruity drinks and asked the waiter to recommend me one. He told me a lot of people liked Strawberry Splash and I decided to pick that...and liked it! I looved the strawberries in the drink as well. Made the hot night so much better :) Now....I'm trying to watch what I eat and I love how menus have the calories next to the food but ooooh my god. 90% of the food on the menu is over 1000 calories. I guess I shouldn't complain....I should have expected it, right? They did have a health-conscious section that consisted of a total of FOUR items :/ Wish they had a bit more. Well, I decided...fuck it. I'll treat myself for the day and got the crispy chicken sandwich. It was goood :) By the way - if any of you are wondering, the crispy jalapeno burger is HUGE. When I saw it on the menu I thought it looked big but when I saw a waitress holding it....wow. Amazing. Lastly, atmosphere is great. Great place to hang out with friends (but you probably already knew that) and chill. They have TVs everywhere for you to watch your sports games and a bar area. All in all...I would definitely come back here (my bf also said this location is more spacious than other ones he's been to) for the days I decide to eat a lot of calories."
Ashley J.,"Sacramento, CA",147,433,258,4.0,3/28/2014,Excellent service at the bar. Drinks are good. One of the bartenders is a cutie patootie. Im always afraid I'm gonna slip on the floors in here... But not yet lol... I like the fish tacos and jambalaya at this particular location.
Carrie C.,"Columbus, OH",82,25,14,3.0,6/23/2013,"My family and I are in the middle of appetizers. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact our server is AWFUL. Rude doesn't begin to explain. We won't be staying Thanks a lot, Savannah. From one server to another... You have a lot to learn."
Tania F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,2.0,11/3/2016,"We needed a table for nine. 8 adults, I needed one for a wheelchair accessible  and one for a child. They said the wait would be 20-25 minutes. my husband and I arrived earlier as we wait for our family to arrive. unfortunately their is only one way to enter the lower area and that consists of walking across the bar area, all around the dinning area into the lower half, not much room for a wheel chair, just wish their was a easier access to the lower area. We got to our seat and it was a round booth, which fit us all, however when seating my mother-in-law who is confined to the wheel chair the bar underneath the table doesn't move and wheelchair can go under, leaving her to be far aware from the table. We asked if their was a disabled table....cause I did ask for wheel chairs accessible. Bjs Server Sierra said it would be 20-30 minutes of a wait.  We told her put us down, we would seat here meanwhile. Sierra ,was great, food was great too but just highly disappointed, won't be coming back."
Eddie H.,"Sacramento, CA",147,81,8,1.0,11/21/2013,"So I'm pretty sure the wait staff accused me of alcoholism. Lol.  I tried ordering a pitcher for me and my 4 friends but they said I couldn't do so. I initially thought that meant they just didn't sell pitchers at the time, but I asked for clarification and cleared it up and they told me they couldn't serve pitchers to individuals. Yeah right, like I'm going to consume a pitcher of their strongest beer alone.  So I ended up getting a few pints instead because the server told me the pints were on special for $3.50. Cool, that's a cheap pint. Until the bill came and we were charged full price for them.   At the end, the manager rectified the situation, but was pretty shifty about it.  Cool happy hour special, but nothing really ""special"" about this place in general."
Jamie D.,"Sacramento, CA",84,83,67,4.0,4/20/2014,"Great happy hour prices.  I always order a Jerry Burst (Jeremiah Red beer with Berry Burst cider). It is the perfect amount of sweet. The restaurant can get quite busy, but the bar area is first come, first serve.  I am disappointed that they recently changed their menu, eliminating my favorite spinach artichoke pizza."
Erin B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/17/2013,This location used to be nice but it seems the service has declined significantly.  We weren't greeted by the front staff for several minutes although there were plenty of them (but I can get over this part).  We placed our order and it took foooooreever to get our food.  There was just two of us.  Our two servers were nice and the manager actually was the one who finally brought our food....but with no apologies. I'm hoping this was just a bad night and maybe I'll be back to find out but for now it's two stars for BJ's in Natomas.
Meuy R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",9,8,,3.0,12/7/2013,"If u like to eat plain, tasteless, and bland pasta such as the Scampi Pasta, you are more than welcome to order this dish...but if u're looking for flavor, then cover this item on the menu, because you will surely be disappointed! Bring your own seasoning if you want pasta! Luckily, we ordered the holiday special (2 entrees, soup or salad, and dessert) for $35, otherwise I would have returned it and ordered some wings instead!  I have to say our server was great and the pizookie was delicious!"
CG S.,"Martinez, CA",1,17,,2.0,5/3/2015,"Food was okay at best, drinks were terrible and the bartender was was the opposite of helpful."
