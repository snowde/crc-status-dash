John E.,"Sacramento, CA",4,12,,3.0,7/31/2015,Bjs is good IF the food comes out hot. Last few times my food was cold. It had to have been sitting under the AC or my server forgot about it but it hadn't even been that long since I ordered. I'm try it just one more time. I hope I can get it like it's supposed to be... HOT.
Sang Y.,"San Jose, CA",3,46,104,2.0,3/9/2014,What is up with this place at lunch?   I've been here twice during a weekday and both times it hasn't been that busy.  We ordered soup and salad and it took 45min to get our food.   But to be fair at dinner time when they're packed the service is fine.  I just don't get it.   Overall though this place has fallen off big time.   Not worth the wait.
Victoria P.,"Antelope, CA",0,15,61,5.0,5/15/2014,BJ's is our go to restaurant on Sunday afternoons. Their menu has a fantastic selection and can satisfy even the pickiest eater. Their food is well priced and the portions are fantastic. I particularly enjoy their balsamic glazed chicken.  Definitely a favorite.  We've never really encountered poor or slow service. Staff is always friendly and welcoming.
Paul G.,"Rocklin, CA",6,129,5,2.0,2/28/2015,"This review is for our visit a few months ago that I never got around to submitting. We had a terrible experience at this BJ's location.  The avocado egg rolls had about one slice of avocado for the entire order. They remade it and it was acceptable, but still pretty stingy with the avocado.   The pizza came out with no mention of my son's grilled cheese. Someone went to check on it but never came back. Our server finally came back and we had to remind her about the kid's meal. She apparently had never submitted it to the kitchen. Not a problem, he can have some pizza while we wait.  Umm, not really. The pizza's dough was raw. When we tried to pick up a piece of pizza it would be stuck to the others and you'd end up pulling off a piece of crust with some dough attached.  They remade it, but it still was undercooked.  We could not trust the food safety and did not eat the pizza. We submitted a complaint to corporate HQ and they did apologize, but it definitely ruined our dinner."
Dameion T.,"North Highlands, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2015,"Absolutely TERRIBLE service.... I took my wife to Kevin Hart's standup last night (Go See It) then to BJ's and there was an hour and a half wait for a table of 6 last night... This didn't bother me too much because Kevin Hart's show sold out Arco Arena which is right down the street. The problem I had is while we were waiting i ordered drinks and not only did the bartender short the liqour, he let it sit on ice for 3 minutes while he made other drinks and then gave it to me watered down with the appearance of a full glass lol. You never know a person's situation (he could be new, could be his first rush, could have simply forgotten) so I still tipped him $10 and this kills me, he looks up and says, ""i'll hook you up next time man"" as if he new he shorted me....  Finally get sat for dinner..... Our waitress doesn't introduce herself at all, just looked at us with the (i ate a$$ face) impression that because we were young we won't tip. She drops plates on our table and about 4 of us try and get her attention and she walks away... we sit for about 20 min before she comes back to take our drink orders (horrendous). I order a second Sierra Nevada and a hef... 20 more min later the beers come out and my Sierra Nevada is lighter than the Hef... hmmm....  ""thanks for the Dos XX but I ordered a Sierra Nevada""  she replies ""that's our seasonal Sierra Nevada, we don't sale the regular anymore, only the seasonal"" Hmmmm.... ""ok, no problem"" (eventhough i just ordered one 40 min ago.....) Appetizers were EXCELLENT (after a 45 min wait)! Mozzarrella sticks and Calamari!!! We order food.... ""Sorry, we mad the wrong pizza but this is the same thing, the only thing missing is meat... here you go..."" Scratching my head.... ""It's ok, we'll wait for the meat"" ""Are you sure? It's pretty much the same thing"" ""Yes, we're sure"" ""Ok"" Steak comes out dry as hell and the knife barely cuts it...  By far THE WORSE BJ'S IN CALIFORNIA!!! IF YOU GO FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE ORDER WATER WITH LEMON, MOZERRELLA STICKS AND CALAMARI! THESE ITEMS ARE THE ONLY ONE'S MASTERED BY THE STAFF!!!"
Sarah D.,"San Jose, CA",6,125,6,4.0,4/2/2015,"One of the better BJ's I've been to! Good staff, good wait times, always great beer."
Roberta H.,"Placerville, CA",49,54,54,2.0,1/29/2014,We had a long wait even though we called ahead. The waiters were great however not everyone got their food. Those of us that did had steaks that were cold. This was my first time at this location and I was not impressed.
Gaby B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,23,,5.0,3/4/2015,I love it here :) always amazing customer service! and the food is always good. can't go wrong with the pazookis! I'm actually writing this as I'm eating ice cream here with my family hehe.
Julian O.,"Sacramento, CA",116,44,39,4.0,1/26/2015,"I like this place a lot and honestly, though they are a little pricey, I'm almost never disappointed with my food. Avocado Egg Rolls are the bomb"
Dalene N.,"Sacramento, CA",48,14,4,4.0,3/26/2015,"I love this location and usually have no issues but since I'm a food safety controller, I will say that management needs to be more strict on keeping up with codes as far as the FOH is concerned. The servers need to have their hair out of their face and off their neck and shoulders. Also, if they are handling food at any time, their nails should be clean and clipped short. Sam, cocktail server, needs to pull her hair up. She is sweet but needs to abide by restaurant rules."
Manya G.,"Sacramento, CA",104,21,2,3.0,10/27/2014,"I am always happy with the food here but the service is inconsistent.   I'm not sure if they are short staffed or need better staff.  We went last Friday night at 9pm and were told it would be 25 minutes - we were sat quicker than that which was nice though.   Then they sat us for 4 even though we were 2 people. Then we didn't get silverware until we asked- after the food was brought out, then it wasn't clean .  All and all not too bad - but we seem to get this sort of service every time.  It just seems that there are a ton of customers and not a lot of service.  The servers are nice and polite, just not great.  The food is consistently good."
shawn m.,"Olivehurst, CA",52,48,22,1.0,8/15/2014,"I wish i could rate 0 stars. Went on 8-14-14 for lunch with my wife and son. I have never been  more ignored in a restaurant ever. We ordered an app, chicken tacos, pasta for the kid and i had soup salad and half a sandwich. Very easy stuff to make, but yet our order took well over an hour to get to our table and cold at that. Could see our server over talking to anohter table for almost a full 30 minutes not minding any of her other tables. meanwhile we had no drinks no check. Had to go up to the front to ask for out check and our food was actually brought out by the bar area server. only after i went to front counter did she realize that we were not happy. Girls at the manager for me to talk to. For a $30+ lunch very disappointed. last time I will visit this location.."
Jennifer E.,"Antelope, CA",0,19,,2.0,9/11/2016,"I've been to this location multiple times and each time the food gets worse and worse. Yesterday I had the bacon cheeseburger and fries, The fries were good but the burger was disgusting there was a flavor on my burger that honestly was horrible. Idk if it was the ""burger sauce"", the bacon or the actual burger patty. Needless to say i didn't finish it and i did not take my leftovers home. My sister even said that her pizza ,which she has always ordered the same one, tasted weird and different. We had ordered an appetizer when we were ordering our drink and it was the spinach and artichoke dip and it tasted amazing but the one thing has has always bugged me and they've done this every time, is they always serve it with broken chips like bottom of the bag looking chips. The saddest part is my sister even said they their water tasted nasty and she asked for more lemons to cover up the taste of the water. Like I'm sorry that's just horrible. I'd give it 1 star but the Customer Service was pretty good. But they def need to do something about the food because if someone is paying 10 to 20 bucks for something we expect it to look and taste good."
David S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,139,,4.0,3/11/2014,"Like a lot of chain restaurants, I think BJ's gets a bad rap from a lot Yelp reviewers.  Regardless of the experience they have, many folks never give a chain restaurant a good review...in fact, I think a lot of people actually lie through their teeth on some of the stuff that I see on here. BJ's Natomas does a nice job.  Their service is always cheerful and friendly, they have a wide selection of food that is prepared well, and a really good selection of quality beer.  One tip I will give for beer lovers...ask the bartender if they have any special reserve beers that they don't advertise or make part of their regular rotation.  I've had a really good Belgian Abbey Ale and some nice seasonal IPA's just by asking for something different. I like BJ's, and their success as a semi-upscale casual dining choice is evidence that they are doing things right."
Antoinette L.,"Sacramento, CA",26,28,51,3.0,3/10/2015,"I have mixed feelings about bj's. I really enjoy the food here. It's delicious from their soups, burgers, and pizza. The quality and serving size is great. But, if you go with a crowd say 6 or more the service really drops. Even worse, if you go during peak hours in the weekend you will almost for sure get bad service. It seems that they don't pride theirselves in service quality, oh food quality. I think the price here is a tad buy more expensive than average and the locations are nice. So you would think they would have descent servers. So food is great service is bad. Every time we go we just automatically get prepared for bad service do its not a let down lol"
Mali T.,"Sacramento, CA",142,97,138,4.0,7/31/2011,"BJ's!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I give you a 4.7 **** Love the fact that they open late, great new items, huge proportions, they got small bites on the menu as well and  friendly waitress/waiter.  Dislike the fact that sometimes there's a wait and sometimes the hostess forgets about you and you would have to walk in and double check with them again to see when will you be seated. What I love most about BJ's is their Clam Chowder in the sour dough bread! OMG!!!! So much clam and so flavorful better then Pier 39/Crab Station!  Their Creole Tilapia was very declious and low calories. Seared Ahi Tuna was also good. They have a lot of good food on their menu! So Kudo's to BJ's ***They even give you military discount if you dine in with your uniform on =)***"
Jeff K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,12,1,1.0,10/20/2013,"I have been a customer of BJ's restaurant for a long time, just like anyone else. The level of service I had received in the past was definitely up to par - until coming to this particular BJ's.  It was my friends 26th birthday. We stopped by late (around 11) for her free pazooki and a drink, to unwind from sushi. Unfortunately her license expired on her actual birthday, but for legal purposes, she brought her paper license  from the DMV.  When our group had finished ordering our drinks, we were routinely asked for our IDs by our nice waitress. When noticing the birthday girl was carrying an expired ID, my friend quickly pulled out the DMV paper license. Our waitress had kindly asked that she double check with her manager to see if it was allowed.  We then were rudely informed by the GM that they could not serve the birthday pazooki, as well as her alcoholic beverage. Our group had quickly replied to his remark, explaining that the DMV had assured her that the paper was still a valid ID - for drinks, as well as driving - but he increasingly began to lose his patience with us. He was not accommodating to such a special occasion, and additionally continued to condescendingly state that he had every right to refuse service, when our group was more than understanding and kind about the matter, even though we were all well over 21 years old.  I am not rating  poorly because of some bias against the franchise, but because of the horrible management, and the quality of how we were treated by this manager. I still wonder if it was just a horrible day for the GM in particular, or if he viewed us negatively because we are college students.  I believe that he is still accountable for his poor decision to flaunt such a negative attitude towards paying customers. I have already contacted headquarters to further fix this issue, so that nobody has to deal with such poor managerial service.     I would definitely not recommend this particular BJ's to anyone I know in the Sacramento/Davis area."
Joce B.,"Vallejo, CA",85,48,34,2.0,2/8/2013,The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because our server Jason was the best. He catered to our every need. His is awesome. I would give him 5 Stars.  Now as for the food. I was not feeling any of it. The deep dish was not any regular deep dish pizza. It's was too doughy than it should be. No sauce and hardly any toppings.  Usually a deep dish pizza comes in a pan but our pizza came out in a white plate.  Will not come back to this BJ's
Terry K.,"Stockton, CA",0,310,8,4.0,9/23/2015,Yay I am a fan of BJs. I've been to several around the southwest and they're all pretty darn good. I love the consistent food taste regardless of which restaurant you go into; that includes the beer!  Best thing is that the kitchen is usually still working late into the evening when most other restaurants have stopped cooking!I feel the prices are a bit high...so I usually sneak in when happy hour prices are in play. The Mediterranean pizza and Nutty Brewnette are my favorites. They all have TV monitors throughout the restaurant and usually a big BIG screen in the bar area. Winner in my books and suggest you try this place if you never have.
Scott P.,"Fresno, CA",77,35,15,5.0,2/25/2015,"A fun thing to do here is sit up at the bar and enjoy their taster set of the beers they make at BJs...there is about 7-8 beers in 2-4oz pours ranging from light to dark (blonde, lager, Hefeweizer, pale ale, IPA, Amber ale, red ale, brown ale, porter, stout) ..they are small enough that if you don't like it you can just take it to the face in one gulp ...food is also good here ranging from pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, etc...chicken wings are pretty god here too as they drizzle buffalo and ranch sauce on them which gives it a nice touch...don't forget to get a pazookie for dessert to top off your meal there..."
