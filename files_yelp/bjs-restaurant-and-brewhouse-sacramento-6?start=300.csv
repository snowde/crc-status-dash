Nguyet K.,"West Sacramento, CA",129,342,611,3.0,3/3/2011,"Tuesday night...  Very crowded BJs in Natomas. There was tables in the back, but they didn't want to seat us there. No open tables in the front room so we had to wait for 10 minutes for a table to open up. There was a few games on TV though.  The staff is very friendly and overall the service was good. The hostess seated us when our table was ready and soon after our waitress took our order for drinks and dinner. We got the calamari first and it was great, the chef cooked it perfectly, it was crispy.  We ordered a turkey club and a classic burger. The thin cut fries came out cold, but we didn't want to complain. (-1star) Just hungry, the rest of the food was hot though. The turkey club was good, but I didn't know that BJs grill the sourdough with butter, so it was a little hard and the taste was a little off. (-1/2 star) This BJs usually pretty good."
Miranda B.,"Sacramento, CA",4,73,6,3.0,1/10/2016,"Came in today for lunch.  Big menu and they do have lunch specials so that's a plus.  Our table got the salmon and quinoa lunch portion, turkey burger with wedge fries, turkey sammie and the deep dish mini lunch that came with a salad.  Let's start with the salmon.  Such a tiny portion everyone was surprised.  They said they do it by weight but still this piece was super small.  Overall she did like it but not liking the 11 bucks to pay for tiny portions.  The picture is misleading.  The turkey burger was good.  Had a little too much cranberries but that was a good flavor to add to the burger so one star just for that. Also the wedge fries were really good and we got a lot of them. The turkey sandwich was eaten but you could have gotten that anywhere.  I got the pizza and was not happy.  The crust tasted funny the cheese wasn't melted under the pepperoni.  I wish I hadn't gotten the pizza and if I ever come back I'll get something else.  Another good reason for the big menu.  Our table also got 2 white Russians and she said those were good.  For dessert we got the salted carmel which was good and between 4 people was perfect.  Overall not a great first experience so I dunno if I'd come back but if my group did then I would."
Big T.,"Pleasanton, CA",63,128,,4.0,9/30/2013,"Good food! Large selection! Great service! But really, the name? I did not know this until we had dinner here, but this is comparable to the Cheesecake Factory in many ways. Large selection. Good food. Lots of drinks. Except this place has a nicer bar. I wish they would have re-thought their choice of names. Call me a prude, but I find it difficult to say this name to my wife and her friends. Kind of crass. For that reason alone, we will not go here as often as I would like."
Sydney A.,"Sacramento, CA",36,18,14,3.0,10/11/2014,"Alright food. It's on par with Applebee's taste and quality. The food doesn't taste very fresh... Kind of like it's all frozen, premade or prepackaged. The servers are always warm and welcoming though and always helpful. There drinks are pretty good and they have a great beer selection.  One downfall if you want to have a nice dinner with friends or family ia.. it's so loud. It's always so loud that I can't really have a decent conversation. I would suggest this place if you have no other real options or are just indecisive on where to eat.  If given a choice,  I would spend my money at a restaurant that has fresher ingredients and can deliver on taste."
Ashley S.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,35,27,4.0,1/5/2015,I absolutely love this place. Yes it does take forever to get your food but it is well worth it. whenever i am in sacramento i make it a point to eat here.
Luis A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,3.0,5/25/2015,Best pizza in town great atmosphere for some drink recommend the long Island ice tea.
Brittany M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",28,6,2,2.0,8/7/2014,Worst BJs I've been to. I have been there a couple times thinking it might be better then the last time and it never is. The last time I went in there I had a salad and a lot if the lettuce was brown and wilted. The time before that I almost walked out because our weightier took about 30 mins just to come talk to us and get out drink order. This was like an hour and a half before they closed and there were only 2 other tables. Then to add on to the problem the staff was rude to us. I will never go back there again. I am willing to drive from Natomas to Roseville for better service and better food.
Mark L.,"Portland, OR",226,96,15,4.0,8/13/2013,"This review is just about the pizookies. Took the wife for dessert for her birthday. The waiter had an amazing 'stache, waxed and curled like an old movie villain. That made it worth the trip already! We split the pizookie trio, with peanut butter, triple chocolate Ghirardelli, and Oreo. The triple chocolate was way too rich, which is something I never thought I'd say. Peanut butter was good, but loaded with far too many peanuts, in my opinion. Oreo was amazing though, and enough to warrant all four stars of this review."
Tiffany P.,"Sacramento, CA",17,26,1,4.0,3/7/2015,Had the Santa fe salad with shrimp. . A little on the bland side but it was decent.  $15.99 was a little pricey for a salad though.
Lanell M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,2.0,5/9/2015,"I always brag about BJ's but, today we received 3 sets of dirty silverware and a plate with food still on the bottom of the plate and it wasn't dry.  The server was great but, the chicken alfrado was dry and the fish and chips were over fried and my sons mac and cheese wasn't mixed throughly.  I brought a friend and my family there for an early Mothers day but, have to say I was quit disappointed. I'll go again but, for now this is what I felt about the afternoon at BJ's."
Jonathan A.,"Sacramento, CA",147,97,33,3.0,1/5/2013,"Service has NEVER been something that BJ's wins at. I am unsure what they look for in the hiring process. Do they hire based on looks?  The service is slow, inaccurate, full of mistakes.  The beer is pretty good, but a little expensive.  Lots of TVs to watch the game. But it is difficult to get a seat for a large group. I still can't understand why this place is so busy. The food really isn't that good and neither is the beer.  For a better value and similar environment check out Carino's down the street. They have Happy Hour all day in the bar."
Stephanie T.,"Sacramento, CA",273,434,43,4.0,3/10/2013,"I know all BJ's are generally the same, but for some reason I like this location a little better than the Arden one. :/  This place is super convenient for me, cus it's near my house and the Sleep Train Arena. So I can drop by for some decent food after a Kings game or when it's late and I didn't get to eat yet.  It's also really great for the late night happy hour, cus it's literally only 5 minutes away from me. And the last time I went here for HH, the service was really good.  Not to mention, my boyfriend was able to meet Jason Thompson here!"
Sean M.,"Roseville, CA",666,129,774,2.0,12/23/2012,"Actual Date: 11/30/2012 This BJ's is different from all the others I've been to. They definitely do NOT have the same quality standards of Roseville's location. When I arrived with my date, we noticed that our silverware was filthy dirty. Not just water spots...there was still food caked on my fork! Okay, no big deal. Just get a replacement, right? When we asked our server to replace it, there were no apologies or even a mention that it was odd. His response was almost as if it were an every day occurance.  The chips that came as an appetizer were seriously stale. I've had an open bag of chips from home that weren't as stale as these were.  Moving on...here comes the pizza we ordered. Man, it was made fast! I was stoked about that because I was starving. Unfortunately, it was prepared entirely too quickly. The dough wasn't completely cooked and I've honestly had better (frozen) pizza's. I'm not sure what their deal is, but they were having issues that night. It wasn't just us either. I observed two other tables returning their food because it wasn't fully cooked. It wasn't very busy either. What a shame.."
Alim K.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",90,79,,4.0,1/1/2015,"It's Bj's lol. They're all over. Love the brews, pizza and desserts. Service is sometimes spotty, but lately they are stepping their game up."
Anthony M.,"Sacramento, CA",15,7,1,2.0,10/4/2014,I have been here twice.  The f irst time was ok and the second time was worse.  We ordered pasta and when we finally got our dishes the pasta was dried out like it sat out for at least 30 minutes and they don't carry red bull? Wtf
Athena K.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",1,6,,1.0,9/24/2014,"If I could give zero stars I would. SLOW service and the food is a great as the service. We ordered the ahi tuna appetizer with our drinks, and not only did our drinks take quite a while, when we finally received our appetizer it tasted nothing like any other ahi dish we have had at any other bjs. We had to tell another waiter about our dissatisfaction because for most of the night our waiter was no where to be found. And then when we complained he started avoiding us. After about 15 minutes with no new appetizer we asked our waiter when he finally came around, (which once again he was not checking on us or even refilling our drinks for the matter) to speak with the manager.  When the manager came over we explained all our issues and he was very apologetic, and said he was going to personally check on our orders and even asked my friend if he wanted another beer. And that was the last we saw of the manager. When we FINALLY received out appetizer and dishes, (which the appetizer was better,not even great and my own dish lukewarm) the manager not once came back and asked how we were and how any of our food. That to me speaks very loudly poor manager skills, poor customer skills, and just poor manners in general. And then when we get the bill the beer the manager offered my friend was added into the bill on top of the appetizer that wasn't that great. It isn't about the money, or even taking anything off.  If the manager at least came over, or if the server offered better service would have changed the tone of our meal, but after being a server for 4 years I can easily say I will not ever be coming back to this bjs and it really has made me reevaluate going back to any bjs."
Killa B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,2.0,3/4/2016,"My rating is for the curbside service. Fast and friendly, but they make you wait on the side of the building where the trash cans are located and where the employees take smoke breaks. Needless to say that once the food arrives you have lost your appetite because you can't get the stench out of your mind."
Tuyen L.,"Sacramento, CA",362,157,410,4.0,6/26/2011,"I love their pizzas.  They are soo good.  And during happy hour their personal pizzas are only $5!!  I've tried other items on their menu like sandwiches and pastas, and they were okay.  Good, but nothing too special.  I do however love their Caesar salad.  I don't know why, but it tastes so good!   When I come here I walk straight to the bar side because you don't have to wait for a table and you get served right away. I tried the red velvet poozkie! OMG sooooo good.. i want another one just thinking about."
Allison W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,21,28,4.0,2/13/2014,"First time eating at a BJ's and it was a positive experience. We arrived around 11:00 and were greeted and seated within 2 minutes of entering. Our waitress was very good (being her first day) She was polite and came to check on us during our meal. I ordered the fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and my friend ordered the lunch special chicken quesadillas. My food was very tasty and well heated. The chicken quesadilla was a small portion and not that flavorful. Nice, clean environment. TVs throughout the restaurant, mostly sports. Very spacious and plenty of room, but it looked like BJs can get very crowded very quickly. By 12, the place was definitely starting to pick up!"
Wayland L.,"Sacramento, CA",135,174,2,4.0,1/27/2013,"Since this is a BJ's, food is kind of uniform.  The food at I ate at this BJ's is basically the same as the BJ's in Vacaville, or in South SF.. or in Sacramento.  That leaves service. We got there probably about 7pm, and it was packed.  Well, apparently packed.  We waited about 15 minutes, which wasn't bad.  The two girls at the front of the house were overwhelmed.  I felt a bit bad for them.  Anyways, once our buzzer thing lit up, we were shown to our table.  There were about 5-6 empty tables around us.  Huh.  I assume they didn't have enough staff for that night.  Could have had 3-4 extra wait staff for the night and all would have been great!   Thankfully, we had a great server.  I don't remember her name, but she was perky and full of energy.  She came by often, cracked some jokes, made suggestions.. all I could really ask for in a server.   Needless to say, we left a good tip because she was so much fun.  That, and it was NYE, and no one should have to work NYE."
