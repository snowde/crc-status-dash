Holly Marie V.,"Woodland, CA",11,17,,1.0,2/11/2015,Never going back. I ordered a French Dip sandwich & my bread had MOLD. I was so disgusted because I had already taken a few bites. I couldn't even stay to have a free dessert or alternative menu item because I was so grossed out.
Kenny L.,"San Francisco, CA",174,762,80,3.0,2/4/2013,"You can NEVER go wrong with BJs! maybe this one time though I came here right after a tahoe trip with a large group of over 20 people so we were able to get two big tables from their hostess. Tables were perfect, right next to two big screen TVs just in time for the NINERS vs FALCONS NFC playoff game!  Beer is always good at BJs but this particular time, the food was not very good. Everything tasted bland. I have to say, the BEST thing i had was actually the fries, not even joking. I can give one extra star for the awesome job our waitress did in getting our food out and understanding that we were gonna be there the entire game, thanks for the awesome service girl with the glasses!"
Michelle N.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/21/2014,"I always order the same thing at Bjs, and at this place there was a lot of things missing. My waitress was not attentive, had to ask her twice for ketchup. My friend ordered steak medium rare and it was well done. Service was terrible, waited a good hour before all the food came. I'll think twice before coming back to this one."
Song C.,"San Francisco, CA",486,373,134,3.0,2/26/2011,Beer selection - great! Appetizer - avocado rolls Pizza - Have never tried one yet Lunch - reasonably priced Fries - criss cross cut or thin cut Pork sliders - yum Happy hour is not so great because I don't see anything half off.
Adam W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/20/2016,If i could give zero stars i would. I visited bjs tonight with my boyfriend. Not only was the wait so long and awful we ended up eating at the bar but my meal was overcooked i asked for medium rare and got well done but i was so hungry at that point i ate it anyways. I also ordered a to go item before i found my food to be cooked incorrectly the to- go burger was also well done and not medium rare like i asked. No gold star to the line cooks of bjs for not having enough knowledge to be able to properly cook a piece of meat! I will not be returning. Thank you bjs for a terrible experience!
Erica C.,"Anchorage, AK",831,261,3017,3.0,9/2/2010,"I've never seen this on the menu before.....""Secret Menu"" perhaps?! So I thought I'd share....  2 SOUPS or SALADS + 1 MEDIUM PIZZA + 1 PIZOOKIE = $20 ONLY!  **They will even let you do half and half for the pizza!**  SO worth it! YUMM. I had plenty of leftover pizza to take home! :)"
Martinez M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,26,40,3.0,12/22/2014,The food was great! But the down side was that we ordered our pizza without a couple of unwanted toppings but they were still added to the pizza :( so it took longer to eat since we had to pick them out from each slice.
Justin E.,"Sacramento, CA",27,18,1,3.0,1/17/2014,"Not a bad spot. On any typical night, expect at least a 15-20 minute wait to be seated. The best thing you can possibly get is their root beer. And they sell growls of them for $9, which is a pretty cool little collectible.  Food is average at best. If you arnt getting pizza, don't even go. The rest of their food isn't worth the visit or the price. Beers are decent at best. The only good-ish ones are the tatonka stout, Irish red, and their ipa. Everything else is just at par, nothing great Overall a decent place to eat. Not many spots in natomas to go out in the first place, so this one probly takes the cake. As long as you get a pizza..."
Tommy T.,"Sacramento, CA",42,51,2,4.0,1/10/2014,I like this place because they have a great unlimited soup and salad lunch. The soup variety is great but salads are minimal. The pizza is awesome and can feed a few people. The happy hr prices are ok not the best in town by no means. The beer selection is great and a full bar is a plus.  The service is hit and miss. I usually sit in the bar area and things move quick but the dining area is not always that way. Sometime there is a wait to even get seated. Just like everyone else no one likes to wait so be prepared if you are in a rush.
Drew T.,"Rocklin, CA",285,879,3018,3.0,1/4/2013,"Poor atmosphere, lackluster hosting and bar service, and unmemorable food. waitstaff was excellent and the drinks were great (beer and mixed drinks). Rewards can be OK if you eat out here enough, but overall not my first choice of restaurants around here. Go for pizza or appetizers or just get hammered and it doesn't matter what you order."
Alycea M.,"Sacramento, CA",142,21,15,4.0,1/6/2016,"I went into BJ's for the first time last week and really enjoyed it. When I imagined BJ's I figured it would look more like a sports bar and not as classy as it looks which made me enjoy it even more haha. I feel bad because I don't exactly remember our servers name (sorry, but if it helps I think it was Vanessa or Valerie). We came in around 5 right before the real busy hours on a Saturday night and immediately got sat which was great. Our food came out amazing minus my boyfriends cabbage which was over cooked. My only note would be for the cooks to check how they put the meat on the stove top. On both of our pieces of meat they were cooked differently on the left and right. We aren't snooty or obnoxious customers so we just went with the flow. Overall it was a great meal. As a server I know how busy it gets for the server and she did a great job. My only suggestion would be to SMILE! (: It wasn't that she was grumpy or gave bad vibes I just like seeing that you too are enjoying yourself even though you're at work! Lastly, would we come back/recommend BJ's? Yes!"
Nicole L.,"Chula Vista, CA",98,24,12,5.0,11/30/2014,Jason Bailey was an amazing server. He is so helpful and knowledgeable. He made our visit to BJs a memorable one.
I A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,48,,4.0,2/5/2016,"Good service and nice hangout. Grand Cru, Mediterranean, Sweet Pig, and Spicy Hawaiian Chicken all good!"
Kady G.,"Cedar Ridge, CA",13,1,,4.0,12/20/2014,"The food is fine and the drinks and service are usually pretty good. I really only have complaint: BJ's CORPORATE OVERLORDS - Please, for the love of whatever you hold dear, join the 21st century - along with with SeatMe and OpenTable - and accept reservations! I called ahead and *still* spent 25 minutes standing outside in the drizzle. I can order pretty much anything in the world with my phone and a credit card except for a table in your dining room. What's wrong with this picture?"
Cynthia K.,"Sacramento, CA",3,3,1,5.0,1/15/2014,"I still need to go to this particular BJ's, sorry, however we used to go to the one at the Arden Fair Mall.  The food was absolutely fabulous, and so was the service from the hostesses, and the waiters - whether it was the cocktail server, the actual waiter/waitresses, or anyone walking past us!  I especially enjoyed their special pizza that had spinach and garlic on it. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of it but would if I looked at the menu again so if needed, feel free to send me  question.   The wine and drinks were terrific too, but the pizza was awesome!   The ambiance is very nice however it can be very loud with so many customers.  The music is always nice and matches with the general age group and quality clientele - no rap crap, hard rock, acid, in other words noise (not music) - therefore the music was complimentary to the entire experience. DRESS - Casual or dressy is acceptable.  You will even feel comfortable if you are dressed up for a special occasion you might me attending later, such as a rodeo or masquerade party, as long as you look nice, without nudity, or extreme cleavage showing for example, since this is a ""family"" place. They used a beeper system for the waiting and had comfortable places to sit inside and outside (smokers).   The wait always seemed to go by quickly, apx. time was 10-20 minutes without reservations.  Plenty of parking but in a mall/shopping area so sometimes (depending upon the day and time) finding a space could take quite a few minutes, without using the mall valet service (which is free, but you should certainly tip them), and the HANDICAPPED parking was even more limited due to not having their own parking lot. Overall, this has become our favorite place to dine out when we want it to be special and delicious!"
Cheri B.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/19/2014,Terrible lunch today. Was served a grey rotten potato. Service was extremely slow and the manager I spoke with was unhelpful. I will never go back to this location.
Kay K.,"Sacramento, CA",11,68,16,3.0,5/2/2014,Food and drinks were reasonably priced.  Our server was funny and on point.  The ambiance is nice and lighting is dim which I personally prefer.  I tried Mahi Mahi grilled tacos and a lite version of the house margarita.  The tacos were good and I really liked the flavor of the black beans but they were cold.... Although the experience was not perfect our server was incredibly friendly and I will give this BJ'S location another shot.
Amber F.,"Sacramento, CA",62,91,41,1.0,11/3/2010,"This was perhaps the worst kids meal I've ever gotten for my kids.  We chose BJ's because we have kids and they have a kids menu, it's loud and generally kid friendly. They seat us in one of those round booths and we obviously have the carseat - carrier thing for our little infant dude, they tried to give us a 'sling' to leave him out in the walkway and basically on top of the table next to us.  We ended up having to wedge him in the booth with us.   I ordered the chicken with rice and vegetables for my toddler and the pepperoni pizza for the big kiddo, the lil' guy didn't get a kids meal from the menu heh.  So, their meals come, and the pizza is cheese, so we're like oh this is supposed to be pepperoni, the waiter in training says oh sorry we'll fix that up for you.  Then, I see it.  These disgusting vegetables they're trying to pass off on us.  See picture... The carrots are like dried up and old...  It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen, they look like they were found in a dumpster after a week of rotting or something.  I want to vomit thinking about it.  I ended up having to give her my fries because the waiter had disappeared with the cheese pizza and we couldn't even flag anyone down. The pizza retuns... it's literally the same cheese pizza with like 5 pieces of semi warm pepperoni on it now.  Like they put pepperoni on it and then put it in the microwave.   It was incredibly sad, then it got sadder.  No drink refills until they swoop by with the check, no checking on us to see how things were, no boxes offered, nothing like that. This was even worse than I had expected, mind you, I didn't think we would get much out of this place, it was just THAT bad."
Shaina Marie W.,"Sacramento, CA",68,95,64,1.0,11/2/2014,"I used my preferred wait list on my way to BJs and was seated immediately even tho there the waiting area was packed. After bring sat in the same place as the day before(Yes I came two days in a row) we saw our same waiter and were pretty happy. He was on top of it Halloween night and super nice!! This is where the service changed for the worst. I believe a lady by the name of Renee walked up to our table. A little ditzy ""hope you are all having a good Sunday"" we looked at her and informed her it was Saturday. We asked for silverware. We had already been waiting a while so we gave her our drink, appetizer and food order all at once. We should of asked for a different waiter at this point as she stumbled through the order. Drinks and appetizers were refilled and brought to table by many different staff after this. Stuffed mushrooms and pot stickers were only warm when brought to the table. Sent back potstickers to get the same luke warm ones back again. When food came the pastas were great, hamburger was great, but as always  one of our guests requests for a dry pastrami wasn't dry (this is not the first or second time this has happened at this exact BJS but multiple) as usual the same manager comes out in his blue shirt I think his name was Jeremy (surprised he didn't recognize us) said he's sorry for the inconvenience and comped the pot stickers and pastrami and a new one would be out quickly. The second one arrived and from the seat I was sitting in could smell burnt bread I myself reach over and flipped the bun and the inside of the bun was toasted beyond burnt. The person eating this was super disappointed sitting 20+ minutes watching everyone else eat just decided to eat the burnt sandwich. I was obviously mad at this point being that I asked to come here two days in a row. So I stopped Renee our waiter to ask why the bun was burnt (I even had her smell the burnt bun) she informed our table that this is how it's made and if she was eating this sandwich this is just how she would like it prepared. I double asked her ""so really you would expect a burnt sandwich and she said yes. We told her NOT TO COME BACK TO OUR TABLE. She started reaching for our check I told her to leave we have the app. We all left with a irritation. I love BJs I really wish I didn't have to beg my family to frequent this and other locations due to service issues :/ get it together guys."
