Erik N.,"Sacramento, CA",246,150,50,2.0,2/25/2013,"After having been to various BJ's several times, I've concluded that the only reason people would want to go there, and perhaps this is obvious, is for the in-house brews. They have a selection of house-brewed beers at reasonable prices. Otherwise, it's just another chain restaurant with standard american food. Not to mention, their menu is unbearably long....what don't they serve??  But seriously, get the avocado egg rolls. I don't care if those were fresh, frozen, prepared off-site, or what-- they are gooooooood.  Service was ok, but we waited almost 15 minutes before anyone greeted us or even brought us water.  Three stars for the beer, two stars for everything else overall."
Kim T.,"West Sacramento, CA",360,149,196,3.0,5/31/2012,"Came here for my daughter's, Maykayla's birthday and my boyfriend's birthday, the cool thing was, our server was named MCkayla. Pretty cute how a server with the same name as my daughter got to serve us. First off, I would like to say, THEY WERE OUT OF CALAMARI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh the horror! That was the main reason we came here other than the beer but omg, we ALMOST walked out because of it. So because of that, I was going to give this place 4 stars but I have to deduct a star for that one. I ordered the BJs Classic Ribeye (2 stars) with a HUGE baked potato side, the steak was a little dry, probably because I ordered it medium well.  We always order the sampler when we go to BJs but since we had our kids, I ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen (5 stars). It tastes much better than the regular Hefeweizen.  For dessert, I ordered the Red velvet Pizookie (4stars), and my boyfriend and my daughter each got birthday pizookies with candles lit. The service was excellent. I will be back after i make a call to see if they have calamari."
Chad N.,"Sacramento, CA",6,6,1,3.0,5/8/2014,"Food is good. Beer is tasty. If you are sitting at the bar and Tracy is the bartender I hope you aren't too hungry or thirsty because she blows off the real customers to gossip with coworkers or off duty staff at the bar. If you are lucky, you'll show up on a night when another bartender is working."
Kelsey B.,"Sacramento, CA",65,31,11,3.0,6/4/2014,Good service the food is ok. It's always very consonant. Good place for happy hour. The chicken lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls are good. It's got lots of TVs at the bar.
Hoa N.,"Elk Grove, CA",386,89,85,4.0,7/27/2012,"Late night bites! I like BJ's, but this location lack of nice service or something. beers pizza and drinks are always good!"
Maiyer V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,46,80,3.0,1/16/2015,"I like this place because of the pizza and the Pink Cadillac drink.  Pizza dough taste fresh, not premade.  Portion size is good.  Waiters and Waitress are very nice and helpful.  The only complaint I have is the service in the back.  It takes forever, and I mean it, for you get your food.  I went during rush hour (dinner time) and in the late afternoon when it wasn't busy at all and my food took 30 minutes to come out.  And it was only 4 of us at the table and we did not order the whole menu.  This place needs to work on their service in the back because they are affecting the front service."
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, CA",266,876,2178,3.0,1/25/2009,"I loved their deep dish pizza. The staff is always friendly. The place is a little loud, but very popular. I love their sandwiches.  The thin crust sausage basil pizza they have for their appetizer is very good, but smells kind of funny! haha Just close your nose while you chew."
Gurleen B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/15/2016,"I just left BJ's brewhouse and I am so upset about the service that I received tonight. Our waitress Stephanie continued to mess up our orders and could not get our simple check right. She spent half an hour shuffling about trying to figure out who's check she had given us and where our check went. She then proceeded to take my credit card from me and walk around the entire restaurant with it trying to figure out what to do. She profusely apologized but made no effort to accommodate us in anyway by giving us any type of discount or letting us speak with a manager when asked. When we finally got our check, we realize that she had double charged us for many things. She then proceed to spend another half hour trying to figure out how to get those charges off. Finally, she was not able to use my rewards card because ""the computer was down"". I'm a big fan of BJ's brewhouse but I will not be coming back here again and I will make sure that anyone I know hears about it. I am so upset after tonight and this meal has ruined my entire evening."
Coty B.,"Sacramento, CA",13,11,22,4.0,12/30/2012,"My husband and I are regulars here and or good reason. The music is great, the food is satisfying and the staff are on point. A bit pricey."
Prescila B.,"Sacramento, CA",354,456,359,3.0,1/13/2013,"Again, 3.5 stars is more appropriate. Another typical restaurant chain, some great dishes, some horrible..you decide. I personally don't think this chain has many great choices but certainly better than Applebees, TGI Fridays, Chevys or Chilis. Just a small step above those other guys, Im sure you know what I mean=)"
T R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,25,,5.0,12/3/2014,"Always good, fairly priced food, awesome priced happy hour food!  The BJ craft beers are really good.  I've been here 3 times, & it's always been a real pleasure!"
Thao V.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",49,10,7,2.0,5/17/2012,"Went to lunch here with a coworker. Food was yummy :) Service was CRAPPY! We did the lunch special with the soup and baked potato. I ordered the tortilla soup--big mistake! Don't get me wrong, the soup was delicious! The server brought it out and placed the plate in front of me, and I'm going,""Where's the soup?"". There was chicken and guacamole and other ingredients on the plate, but no liquid.  That's when she brought out soup and POURED it on my plate, burning me in the process.  She didn't even apologize, just poured and left.  My finger started turning a nice shade of red and started trembling.  My coworker asked the other server for ice, and she went,""What for?"". I showed her my finger and she said in a snotty voice,""Aww, do you needs band aid too?""   SCUSE ME *ITCH?!  Of course I didn't do that, but I did roll my eyes and ask for ice again. I'm never going back to this location!"
Kelli S.,"Stanwood, WA",1,19,7,5.0,12/29/2015,"Stopped here for dinner on our way up to Redding.  Food was very good.  My husband and daughter shared the ribs and said they were excellent.   I had the blt salad, but had them make it an entree size and add grilled chicken.  Excellent.   We don't have BJ's in WA and enjoy stopping here on our road trips through California."
Nicole G.,"Sacramento, CA",59,70,38,3.0,8/28/2014,Great for happy hour. 3 to 7pm...they've got drinks and small plates starting as low as $4. Have always had great service.
Jeneane B.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,93,,3.0,5/15/2014,"I was satisfied with my dining experience at BJ Restaurant.  The food was good and the beer selection was plentiful.  I had the scallop dish from the enlightened menu - it was good, especially considering it was a light dish.  My husband ordered a burger and fries, and they were average.   We tried a few of their beers, but found them to be only lightly flavorful.  The IPA in particular had less bite than we have come to expect from an IPA. While our waitress was very nice, service was slow and she got our checks and the dessert order wrong."
Debbs T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,5,5.0,11/14/2014,Hailey at Take Out was extremely pleasant! I am so impressed by her customer service even during an extremely busy night! I left with a smile on my face.
Adam O.,"West Sacramento, CA",75,161,8,4.0,10/8/2010,This is a great place to eat when I'm Not in the mood to be creative and go to non chain places to eat. George our server was more then great!   The food Is always good and being able to watch plenty of sports while ignoring my wife is always a plus.  Ok ok I'm kidding!   Gezzz.
Parris L.,"Sacramento, CA",3,5,,3.0,11/7/2013,"Decided to try the Bison Burger today. Ordered well, but it came baxk medium. Not enough time on my lunch break to take it back. I do not recommend this to anyone. I should've ordered the Moroccan Salmon. The best part of the lunch was the Oktoberfest Brew that I ordered.  It apparently received a Gold Medal, which I agree is well deserved."
Megan L.,"Sacramento, CA",2,31,10,4.0,4/19/2013,"JAMBALAYA!!!! JAMBALAYA!!! I love spicy food, so I always ask for it super spicy. This is my favorite dish on their menu. The flavor is delicious, and the extra spiciness kicks it up a notch! The clam chowder is really good too. I guess it's kind of strange that I come to a chain restaurant for clam chowder, but it's seriously way better than a lot of other places (and I've tried a lot, even award winning ones in the Sac area that don't really live up to their hype). There are large chunks of clam - yum! I hate it when restaurants serve clam chowder, and there are practically no clam pieces. This is not the case here - their clam chowder is so freaking good (as long as it comes out hot). Most of their appetizers are tasty. I like the thai lettuce wraps with shrimp. The menu is HUGE, so there are lots of choices. Service is usually pretty good. In general, a very solid place to dine."
Leanne P.,"Milpitas, CA",346,800,158,3.0,11/21/2012,"Pretty chill spot. Came here the other night to watch MNF.  I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't packed and we were able to snag a table at the bar fairly quickly.   Its a chain and the food and beer are always awesome.   Service was almost nonexistent though, which is what earns them 3 stars.  Our server barely checked on us and served us food but no utensils.  And took forever to refill my soda (and never refilled the water)."
