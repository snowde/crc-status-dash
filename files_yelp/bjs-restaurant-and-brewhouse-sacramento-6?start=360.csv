Lisa D.,"Riverside, CA",0,14,,2.0,4/23/2014,"I have tried too many times to count. BJ's service sucks! No matter which one I have gone to it is the same, poor service. I went to this location on Monday thinking if I ordered soup I could be in and out fast. No, I had to ask twice as to how much longer it would be. We even ordered and appetizer and it came out quickly but we kept waiting. 20 more minutes to get two bowls of soup? What is wrong with this restaurant. Why is their service always bad? It doesn't matter which location it is all the same poor service. If you don't mind waiting and your not in a hurry then it is OK. Some of the food is good and  some items are overpriced and terrible. I'm giving it 2 stars because the food isn't terrible. Just the service!"
Joy S.,"Eagle, ID",10,81,14,3.0,3/26/2014,"Had lunch here after a friend told us the food was good and reasonably priced. I would agree that the quality was good and they had a very large variety. The boneless chicken wings were spicy and borderline underdone. I would have sent them back but I hesitate to do so in any restaurant. What I really like was the fact they gave you nutritional info about each dish. The price was good if you ordered off the value menu, otherwise the prices were pretty standard. I would recommend as a go with an expectation of better than chain food."
William B.,"Portales, NM",2965,184,199,3.0,3/4/2012,"How can you not go to a place called BJ's?    I had a blonde on draft x3, and tried the gumbo.  My week has been all about southern food, and now I am back here in Sac, I thought I would see what it is like in comparison.  This gumbo was full of meat, and rice but lacked any sauce.  The flavor was really good, but as a gumbo, I can't give it more than 2.5 stars.   The beer, was very good, and the company as well.   Mike was our server, very good job!"
Chris W.,"Issaquah, WA",22,30,,5.0,12/28/2012,"Considering this is a chain, and they do an amazing job as a chain, they deserve 5 stars.  I don't expect fine dining here, but they exceed my limited expectations of a chain restaurant.  So with that being said, this is a chain and my review is based off that fact. Beers brewed by BJ's, pretty frickin good, a hell of a lot better then anything I had at Rock Bottom!    Flatbreads are delicious, you can get any ""pizza"" as a flatbread.   The BJ's in the Seattle area have an amazing beer selection on top of what BJ's provides normally.   This is all based off the fact that this is a chain, and the Natomas one has been mad decent to us!"
Jeremy O.,"Sacramento, CA",45,21,5,4.0,7/3/2014,"Let's start with the best... the peanut butter pizzookie is amaaaaazing. I like how chewy the ice cream is too. Everything that I have had here is good. The California chicken flatbread, diablo pasta, salads, apps... their beers are decent. I really can't complain and haven't had a bad experience at BJ's that I can recall. Also a nice spot to catch a game if you get a seat at the bar."
Julie N.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,8,5,1.0,3/23/2012,"DON'T EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!   Went for Friday lunch with 5 co-workers and arrived early before the rush. First, found shard of glass on my boss's soda.  Then, food took 25 minutes to be served.  When it arrived, only half of  us were served. The food was cold and look like it had been sitting a while.  Five minutes later the remaining half of our dishes arrived. My sandwich was missing some ingredients. The food runner took the whole plate, instead of leaving me at least the fries to eat while I waited, and I never did eat in the restaurant. Our server told me that my food would be made to go- which took another 15 minutes. I sat there and watched all my co-workers eat their lunch. When the to go order arrived, my sandwich STILL was not made correctly and I left it on the table.  When I talked to the manager, he was apologetic, but this place is a big chain restaurant!!!!!  The server said that the kitchen can't keep up when it gets ""slammed.""  Why not??  If you want to spend two hours on a Friday sitting and watching everyone else eat cold food-- then BJs is the place for you. If you don't, then don't waste your time or money there....go to Jamie's in Sacramento on Broadway.  Best garlic steak sandwich and fries in town AND they'll get you in and out in under an hour."
Doug G.,"Elk Grove, CA",6,26,29,4.0,8/12/2015,Soup and salad today for lunch. It's delicious and all you can eat. I think you get a choice of four different types of soups and four different salads. It's one heck of a variety for $8.
Melissa S.,"Reisterstown, MD",4,54,1,2.0,6/6/2014,"Well, we were comped my sister's dinner. She ordered the sirloin and it was AWFUL. Like, weird spice rub and super weird texture. It didn't have the mouth-feel of a steak. My dinner was OKAY, but honestly, I wouldn't go back here. The service is meh. But, our raspberry sparkling lemonade was delicious!"
Heather W.,"Sacramento, CA",10,9,,5.0,7/30/2014,"My favorite place to eat out in Natomas. Great selection of food, a little something for anyone's taste buds. Everything I have tried on their menu has been excellent.  I even love their handcrafted beer selections. Tons of tv's if your a sports fan. And servers who are professional, fast and courteous."
Dixie L.,"Sacramento, CA",73,34,,5.0,4/5/2012,"I love BJ! Their Chicago style pizza is a BOMB! I know, I know it is not authentic & is a chain restaurant but who cares, it is so good and it only takes them less than 15 mins to bake & ready to eat. The last time I had Chicago Style pizza was at Chicago Fire which took them more than an hour to bake and 45 min wait without a reservation. Service is great as well, very friendly staff. The house brewed root beer is cool! Can't wait to try their lemon drops. Will have to make time to go this weekend."
O M G.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1722,8464,3.0,3/3/2010,"We were in the area. We wanted beer. So, we ended up here. I've been to this location a couple times and it's been okay.  If you've been to one, you've been to them all. That's the comfort of a chain, I guess. This is next door to Mimi's Cafe and right on the corner of N. Freeway and Gateway Park.  BJ's is quite popular. Every BJ's that I've been to, draws a lot of patrons and it seems to always be busy. With my most recent visit, I was greatly irritated by our server's sly attempt at upselling. There's a way to serve people and suggest things but, it was so annoying that even her face started to bother me. It made for an unenjoyable lunch and consequently.. this review. For the most part, BJ's has an extensive menu with key novelty things like their HUGE baked potatoes, their pizookies.. I think it's pretty decent food but it's nothing I'll crave for or seek. I'll never be the one to say-- Let's eat at BJ's! If it's there, it's there. And that's my feelings on that. It is what it is. Since it's always busy, know that you can call ahead for your table and they also have a separate counter (even an entrance) for take-out."
Sean W.,"Sacramento, CA",127,248,332,4.0,5/1/2014,Chain stores are not my thing but the Tatonka Stout draws me back all the time. The food here is really predictably good as well as the service. We dropped in here to help the brother in law celebrate his promotion and we got some great beers and cocktails to match with the chips and salsa and the lettuce wraps. Everything was so good!
James M.,"Incline Village, NV",0,8,1,2.0,3/17/2014,"Understanding it's a chain and my expectations shouldn't be super high for a $17.99 top sirloin steak dinner.... this is a pretty sad presentation (see pic #203). Seriously, that's exactly how it came from the kitchen."
Scott P.,"Sacramento, CA",118,40,91,3.0,12/22/2014,"So, my wifey bought some gift cards earlier in the day and was so so happy.  She came home and said lets go eat at BJs because they hooked me up earlier.  So we get there and sadly the bar was full.  So we sit at a table in the bar area and we were promptly greeted by a server.  She took our drink a and appetizer order and then it was all downhill. My wife asked for a water with lemon and I a beer.  Some person brought me my beer before my wife's water and I asked her for a water and she said ""your server will bring it"". Really!!  So my wife went to the bar and got the water herself.  Minutes later our server returns with some dark murky watery substance and half ass apologizes for the confusion. We let it go and hope for the better. We get our appetizer which was great and that was it.  No service for 30 min.  This girl was all over the tables around us but never even glanced at us.  The two ladies at the table next to us were two drinks and a salad in before I had enough and flagged down our server to ask for the check.  I gotta admit though, she gave us our check and cashed us out in less than 5 minutes!!!  ""That was great service."" We love BJs but I was so appalled by the service I had to YELP about it.  Shame on you BJs!!  But to be honest I'll be back (but only if I have a seat at the bar)."
Kasem B.,"Sacramento, CA",68,67,1,5.0,7/7/2012,"You can't ask for a more varied menu.  There is something for everyone and it's all done pretty well, not half assed nonsense.  They got a whole bunch of different brewed beers if that's your thing.  Service is pretty good all around, both speed and quality.  Will be back soon. I almost forgot... you gotta try the pizookie.  Seems so simple cookie and ice cream but they do it very very well.  Baked in the platter that is served to you in so it comes perfect hot from the oven.  Perfect example of a well made meal, no matter how simple it may seem."
Violeta G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",2,45,1,5.0,5/19/2014,Went to Bj's for my Birthday and we had a great time! There was 7 of us and we all got great food and great service! I even got a birthday treat which was delicious! My husband and I love to come in for a date night once in a while and we bring the kids for brunch! Bj's will always be one of our favorite spots!
Cheryl H.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",5,30,23,2.0,12/9/2013,"So, we've tried this place several times, and every time, I wonder again why we did. I guess it would be ok if we drank, because this place is mostly a sports bar and pizza place. The first several pages of the menu are alcoholic beverages.  The last few times, the things I've ordered haven't been that spectacular and it usually takes forever. Also, the pizookies were overcooked and they were out of the Oreo cream that makes the Oreo pizookie so good. Generally just not worth the money or the time."
Casey S.,"Sacramento, CA",316,169,343,5.0,11/8/2011,"BJ's - nothing ends a workweek like a Berry Burst Cider, chicken lettuce wraps ( for us nibblers) and a Pzookie!  They are already a part of our memories!  Hooray for BJ's!"
Melany H.,"Auburn, CA",174,21,12,2.0,3/28/2012,Take out service isn't bad.  We use it for work once in a while to feed a large group.  Food gets kinda nasty while it waits for pick up and is in transit  though.. Table lunch service is good... Bar service sucks!!!  Waited 30 minutes for drinks- got tired of waiting and our group went accross the street to Chili's...
Chris N.,"Sacramento, CA",216,440,120,3.0,10/4/2011,"This is a fine chain restaurant... one which I prefer over many others. All the food is ""good enough,"" and they give you a nice variety to chose from.  And by ""good enough,"" I mean that it is often times good but could be better. I recently ordered their spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce, which featured a ""hint"" of alfredo. Sounded like a good time to me! But the end result was surprisingly bland. Now I'm not one of those people that loves ultra spicy food, but there really wasn't any heat to it at all. And while I am a big alfredo fan, the ""hint"" (which was more like 50/50) really mellowed out the marinara flavor until there wasn't much to it. I ate it all, but it could have been so much more. On top of that, the waitress forgot my house salad, and once I got it, I came to the same conclusion that I later would with the pasta: good but not great.  Other items have fared better in the past, like their thick crust pizza, and there's so much variety in their menu that it is hard to rate their entire restaurant on one meal. Still, this visit only gets them 3 stars... although I will be back again. Also note: They do not take reservations for smaller parties, but if you call ahead, you get on the ""Call Ahead"" list, which at least puts you in front of any walk-ins."
