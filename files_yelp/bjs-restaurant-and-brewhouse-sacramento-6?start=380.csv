Missus T.,"Davis, CA",0,72,1,2.0,8/19/2013,"You know how restaurants ask you to tell them about a problem before you Yelp? That doesn't work if they don't respond! We had a disappointing dinner here recently, and I took the General Manager's Card so I could email him. Alas, a full week later, not a word. So, Mr. Sandoval, here you go! We arrived a little before 5 pm, and handed the hostess our Rewards Card. The restaurant was less than half full, with one large party seated in the middle dining section. We were taken to the first two-top in that section, arguably the worst table in the house at anytime since every patron and server must squeeze by it, but made worse by being next to an 18 person party. I asked if we could have a different table, and was immediately seated in one of the raised curved booths, (from which I watched two other couples in the course of our meal refuse that table.) I was, truthfully, a little put out by this - there's no good reason to seat people at a poor table when the restaurant is not busy. It took slightly longer than usual for the waiter to take our drink order since he was also serving the large party, but he was very nice. Once our drinks arrived, we each ordered an appetizer and a main course, and the waiter said he would have the apps out right away.  After about 20 minutes, we saw waiter bringing our appetizers. That's slightly longer than we usually wait for our food at Bj's, but we figured it was the large party and were being patient. A runner right behind our waiter was carrying two more plates, which turned out to be our sandwiches. Waiter said ""oh, the apps took longer than expected and everything came out at once, can I get you anything else?""  We were dumbfounded but hungry, so we accepted our food. I'm sure I was not very gracious, however. I alternated bites of app and dinner so I got at least part of my food hot, but it was awkward and felt rushed.  While I recognize that BJ's is casual dining, I don't think that anyone expects to have all their courses served at once. I don't know if the order was put in incorrectly or if the kitchen made a mistake, and, as the customer, I don't really care - either the kitchen or our server should have caught the mistake and ensured that it was corrected.  Since this was a birthday dinner for us, we would probably have ordered a second drink after the app and had dessert. Neither of those things appealed to us by the end of the meal, however, and we paid and left."
Michael W.,"Sacramento, CA",96,99,3,3.0,3/28/2012,"BJ's seems to get packed at about 10pm since all the respectable restaurants are closed by that time and all the respectable people are home watching a Blu Ray from the Redbox.  With that said, it's a great place to be able to get something to eat late at night when all these other places are closed to us awake, fun-loving people. I got the sample of 8 - 4oz beers ($13) and the Jalapeno burger, medium. She got the quesadilla, a hard thing for a true Mexican girl to get at an American Fare place like BJ's.  For my palate, most of the beers were just okay, except for the Piranha Pale Ale - that was the best, but the fact that they have the sampler is what makes the beer experience. My burger was cooked to order, which is something that a lot of restaurants can't do for some reason. I wasn't thrilled about the jalapenos being deep fried since that takes away the heat and the flavor.  The burger was good - just good, nothing great and it came with an order of skinny fries. This place is classy for being up late with the rest of us, but you have to pay for that class.  I'd rather pay the $2 buck at a dive bar for a beer and poor lighting."
Pav D.,"Folsom, CA",53,17,4,1.0,7/1/2014,I attempted to come into this bjs late at night about 11:00 they would not allow me to order off the entire menu even though it just turned 11. After my food came out it seemed undercooked and tasted nasty. I perfer going to the Arden location because of the quality of the staff and management. I will not come back to this location even though I live a block away.
Metallic O.,"San Jose, CA",92,196,310,5.0,12/4/2009,"One word: Pizookie pi-zoo-kie: Rich, creamy ice cream carefully positioned atop an oven-fresh chocolate chip masterpiece. Their drafts and food is great too! Check out the full menu for yourself!"
Jimmy H.,"Sacramento, CA",29,223,21,3.0,5/29/2012,"I have had much better experiences taking BJ's to-go as opposed to eating there.  Eating in, I've had everything from rude wait staff to horribly incorrect orders to blue stuff on my pizza crust that I thought was mold but was ""just ink"" (I guess that's better?) to the slowest service imaginable. Managers always make it right by comping bad food and messed up orders, though sometimes you have to be willing to argue a bit. Calling in my food to-go however is day vs. night. Awesome and friendly wait staff. Food comes out on time and they have never gotten a to-go order wrong. They even offer free drinks while I wait.  It's a shame I can't eat in more here because I do like the food and I don't mind their novel of a menu because everything I've ordered from it has been pretty tasty. At least I can continue ordering out to get my BJ's fix."
Jane S.,"San Diego, CA",71,11,1,1.0,3/30/2012,"Took 55 min for a dish of ice cream and a cup of soup while the restaurant was 75% filled. Frigging unbelievable!!!   Sat down @ 12:05 pm for lunch. Waiter took my coworker's order of a dessert & my order of soup & sandwich. Some one else delivered the ice cream and soup. 12:40  the waiter dropped off our tab. He was perplexed when questioned about the other half of my order, the sandwich. He muttered something & disappeared. 12:50 We had to get back, so we went to the hostess to just give the cash to leave. Hostess said she couldn't take our $$ & we have to wait for the mgr. Hello, we need to leave!!! We waited until 12:55 then told the Hostess we really need to leave, not wait. She goes back & again tries to find the mgr. 1:00 pm the Mgr shows up, didn't say any thing besides ""You can leave.""   There must not be a min IQ test for BJ's staff. The only time I will come back is to use their rest room."
Jayne A.,"San Francisco, CA",332,113,382,1.0,6/30/2011,"I have been to a couple BJ's locations before and have never been disappointed until I went there about a month ago. It was the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. The whole experience started off normal with me and a group of friends getting seated waiting about 30 minutes for a table, understandable because we were a big group. No Big. Then we ordered our food and things started to go downhill for me. As we were waiting for food we talked and drank our water within the 20 minutes of sitting. No one came to refill our water, we literally had to find water and grab it for ourselves. What made this interesting was that we switched servers halfway and she never asked us if we needed anything, she was introduced and she soon left to serve other tables.  Everyone eventually started getting their food periodically and soon all the food was served EXCEPT mine. What ticks me off the most was the second server kept saying your food is almost done after everyone get their food but it never came. All the people at my table finished their food (even the slow eaters) before I got my pizza. I looked at my watch and it was an hour and a half since we ordered. This was ridiculous, it would have been kind of okay if the server didn't say that the pizza was almost ready every time but since she remembered I assumed that she was actually honest about it. Silly me!  Since I felt bad that my entire table was  waiting for me to get my food, I walked straight to the server and told her that I have waited for my food for this long and I don't want the pizza anymore. Luckily, the manager was there and he straightened things up...kind of. He got us all water, made sure that the pizza was actually being made and within 10ish minutes. Awesome right?  NOT!  When i got home and finally ate the pizza it wasn't even cooked all the way! The cheese wasn't melted,  the onions and bell peppers were still hard, and there wasn't enough tomato sauce. What the hell were they thinking when this happened? Oh lets tell the customer that we are making it when in actuality we are not. NO! Not cool. If I could give a 0 star I really would have because honestly this makes me not want to come to a BJ's ever."
Carrie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,302,27,4.0,10/17/2011,Went here before catching a movie and really enjoyed a sampler plate: Pros: Large with good drinks. Cons: A little too large if you want an intimate setting...I really felt like I was in my neighbors convo. Will go back...
Sisca S.,"Fremont, CA",116,156,646,3.0,7/18/2010,"We came here after a 10hr class b/c it was close to the office.  We were all anxious to get a drink and have dinner.  We had a 6pm dinner reservation, but got there 30mins earlier.  They still made us wait so we took the 15mins to go to the bar and take advantage of their happy hour specials.   Even though there is a BJ's near us in Fremont, this is the first time that I've ever been to one.  We chose the mega combo app that includes everything, the ahi w/ avocado, & shrimp lettuce cups to start with.  I chose the parmesan crusted chicken w/ white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  I added the tomoto basil bisque - yum!  The broccoli was flavorless and the potatoes seemed like they came out of a box, they were so dry.  My co-worker said the same thing.  He ordered the balsamic chicken w/ fried onions and the same mashed potatoes.  Amongst our group, we also ordered the turkey sandwich w/ thin cut fries - those fries are delicious!  I love it when they're thin.  The calzone is humongous, my mgr. only was able to eat half.  The thin crust rectangle shaped pizza was nice, although the picture looked so much better.  The salad was simple and just regular.   All in all, it was ok.  The server was really attentive, which we appreciated.  It's a great place for groups.  We saw many tables that were celebrating something (birthdays, retirement, etc).  Come early b/c as we were leaving, there was a line out the door.  This place was packed, but not at 5:30."
Tori C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",46,88,2,1.0,11/30/2013,Terrible service... It can't get worse. The food is super generic too. Ughh.
Delicia B.,"Oakland, CA",0,61,20,5.0,4/10/2014,"I travel all the time and chain restaurants are not usually on my agenda but I love BJs for their beer choices.  Tonight, Tim and Hans are behind the bar. They are so friendly, very customer oriented and work as a true team behind the bar!!  This is a must visit for you, makes this ""away from home girl"" feel very welcome!!   Thank you gentlemen!"
Kat C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,8,4,1.0,1/3/2012,Would give no stars if possible.  Not busy on Sunday at 5.  2 salads took 1 hr and 45 to get.  We then received one salad without dressing.  Never got refill offers on drinks.  Had ordered food to but they nvr embed to place order.   Todd manager offered a 50% off one entree and that took another 30 mintuted.  Manager and all employees never smile or greet customers This natomas location is not the typical BJ quality at all.  Terrible service today
B T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,3.0,6/27/2014,Food is average.  I waited forever for my soup and then was told that they ran out?! I do like their pazookie with ice cream.
Katharine A.,"Redwood City, CA",743,1715,73,2.0,7/17/2009,"I stopped in for salads and soup at lunch.  Food was decent although a bit bland.  The place was huge, the menu huge, and everything was just generally blah.   I have never heard of this chain before stopping here, but it reminds me of the cheesecake factory a bit....similar concept."
Tiffany P.,"Sacramento, CA",1,10,,4.0,6/17/2014,"The pizzas are good!! The beer flight is fun and a great way to sample beers! Food is pretty fresh!! And the service is nice! Wait time is a problem sometimes, but worth it!"
Allison H.,"Sacramento, CA",167,169,65,3.0,3/30/2011,"Imagine a restaurant where every single person who works there hates their life.  Now imagine that the food you order takes an inordinate amount of time to arrive; even longer than the impossibly long wait to get five people seated at the most uncomfortable hard-backed table while a cozy couple sits shrunken back in a luxurious booth. Lastly, allow your mind to explore a place where an 8oz glass of Lambic's costs more than a 12 oz beer of Lambic's and Stout.    This is the hell that is BJ's in Natomas.  A high school party with deep dish pizza.  I keep going there because my softball team loves it, but after this latest experiment I'm going to steal some string cheese and goldfish from the punks at the next table over to snack on at the table.  The pizza and pizookies (the brownie, OMG) are worth the fuss, though, so they do have that going for them and the specialty beers and cocktails like the drunken Root Beer (the alcoholic one) are phenomenal and WILL knock you on your ass.  The salads are pretty decent, too, and quite caloric (1000 calorie salad seems like an oxymoron, but it exists here). Just be prepared to wait your face off and be ""greeted"" by a server who presents herself as ""not happy"" and responded with ""really? you want hot chocolate?  But I have to 'make' it.. like, crush out all the powder beads and stuff.""  Are you serious!  It's a packet, add water to that crap and quit complaining.   And bring me a pizookie!!!  The Cookies and Cream one!"
Falyn W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",17,61,,5.0,3/1/2014,"I try to come here as often as I can, the food is wonderful especially the pizza! Yummy. The staff is pretty friendly and the atmosphere is excellent. Would highly recommend this place, and they have take out!"
Tracy J.,"Bell Gardens, CA",22,216,335,4.0,3/19/2012,"It's the perfect place to go when you have a group and they all want something different or American style cuisine.  It is a festive and LOUD place, so even kids are fine there.  Lots of TVs with sports so a great place to go watch sports and drink beer.  Also a great place for a night cap.  They have PAGES and PAGES of items available for eating and drinking, and desserts!   The only problem is that it is often very busy.  They have a call ahead service that you can use that helps you to get onto the list, faster.  But if you show up during the dinner hour, expect 45 min to 1 1/2 hour wait.  I'd definitely call first."
Katrina H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",41,81,2,4.0,2/25/2015,Beautiful and humble location. All the employees seem very happy with there job which makes serving there customers a joy! I ordered the chicken club and it was ok the chicken was bland but the bread made up for that. I also had a margarita and it was also very tasty. I will be back again and with more company!
Corey P.,"Woodland, CA",237,367,4,2.0,5/19/2011,"Given the amount of competition in this area for barn-sized restaurants serving massive portions of calorie-laden stomach-blasting food, I don't know this place is able to stay in business...the kitchen is slow, waiters and waitresses seem to be overwhelmed, and the food is mediocre, at best. The beer, however, was quite tasty and the bartender was both friendly and fast. Go for the beer, yelpers, but pass on dinner."
