Desiree W.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",159,23,22,5.0,9/19/2017,This Bjs is probably one of my favorite ones that I have been to. I started going here years ago  and haven't been in a while until today. The company I work for decided to take us out to eat here and he said drinks on him. I don't even drink but I took advantage of a free drink lol. I ordered the watermelon margarita i believe. It was really good and I squeezed the lime inside. However I didn't finish it. I also ordered the Cookies N Creme pizookie which is my go to pizookie but honestly the trip is really good as well. I saw later on in the night they had a churro pizookie. From the looks of it I will definitely try that out so anyone thinking about goin anytime soon it's seasonal.  I also got the BBQ chicken pizza . The waiter I could see was new only because there was a guy like on his A** lol but the new waiter did a great job I wouldn't have noticed . He's very friendly I wish I got his name to show Bjs he's a great waiter.
Rosendo R.,"Santa Monica, CA",21,40,3,1.0,10/6/2017,"DO NOT GO HERE! They will try and steal from you, the food is cold, service is rude and manager could care less. If I could give them 0 stars I would. The waitress was disrespectful to my girlfriend as she's reading the menu the waitress checks her ID for drinks, which is procedure no problem. She commands my girlfriend to remove her reading glasses and look up at her and not in a friendly way. Ok we move on we ordered the pulled pork slider and a salad. The pulled pork was cold. We didn't bother sending it back because the waitress was already moody. We ask for the check to pay. In this time we get a substitute waiter I pay with a 100 dollar bill and typically you should receive your receipt with your change he purposely or not only brings back the cash change and leaves. I ask him for the receipt and before I even bring it up he says ""oh I'm sorry if it's short I just got change from the front"" he waited as I counted knowing darn well he had shorted me a few dollars. He tries and apologize and now it makes sense why he didn't bring my receipt. I got and speak to the front and he not only lied about getting change from the front but also stole from us. He brought back the right amount of change and we spoke to the manager and all she could say was thank you for letting me know so I can coach him. He's probably done it before and gotten away with it even if it's a few dollars it's still stealing and the fact that the manager didn't seem concern at all makes me even question the business practices of this establishment. Find new management and review staff activities. I will never step foot inside this place again."
Harry M.,"Sacramento, CA",64,104,1005,2.0,3/14/2016,"Food is pretty good for the most part...but service here is not that great.  Came here around 2 on a Saturday with a group of about 8-10.  For the most part, staff was kind and friendly...only problem here was how long the food took!  On a quiet afternoon...food almost an hour before even the appetizer came out.  Took an additional 10-15 mins for entrees.  What kind of makes this surprising was that majority of us ordered salad.  I mean food tasted good for the most part...just to get our food took a while (although a couple of friends were not happy with their ahi tuna salad.  Said the tuna wasn't fresh, tasted frozen). The atmosphere was cool like all bjs.  The drinks and beers were good.  Just food service is slow.  If you don't mind waiting for your food...then this is a cool place to hangout.  Btw...this is not the first time we've waited a long time for food from here.  Some of my friends and I came here after a kings game.  That was more understandable because it was busy and the Kings were coming in after the game.  But on a quiet Saturday afternoon...??"
Matt M.,"Galt, CA",2,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Ima keep this short and simple. Went here last night, our server Ferris was great. So we get to bjs around 10pm. We wait for our food to come out for about and hour. Then all 4 of our dishes were cold. Pizza was cold, burgers were cold, my chicken sandwich and fries were cold. The buns felt like they have been out for weeks. And the didn't even have the sauces on the burgers like the description said it comes with.  Overall worst experience Iv had with a restaurant in a while. Will not be coming here till the kitchen  gets their shit together."
Rick B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",48,10,1,2.0,7/6/2017,Went for lunch on a Thursday around 11:45 am.  Place was busy and we had about a 5 minute wait for a table.   Slow to take drink order about minutes after seating.  Took drink order and order chips and salsa and waiting even longer to get them.  He dropped chips and drinks and left without taking food order.  5 more minutes to take lunch order.   Food came promptly but was warm at best.   Salmon had a few bones in it.  Other party ordered French dip and fries were cold and very salty.
Jenni M.,"Rio Linda, CA",55,3,3,1.0,3/13/2017,Every time I order food from here something is always wrong! Tonight I ordered the pizookie trio & all three were BLACK!!!!! I tried to eat one & it was sooo disgusting! I will NEVER spend my money at this restaurant ever again!
Jorge S.,"Sacramento, CA",17,2,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Waiting in the entrance for a host to get a table: 15 minutes, so I decided to get to the bar. 20 minutes waiting in a bar table for service. No one single server approached. Service in this place has been progressively going from terrible to non existent."
Lily D.,"Roseville, CA",78,451,1209,2.0,8/6/2016,"Came here on my lunch hour from work last Thursday and it was terrible.  The wait to be seated was quick but that was the only thing quick.  It took 20 mins before we saw a waiter.  Then another 25-30 mins to get our food. I ordered the chicken alfredo but they brought me spaghetti so they had to send it back.  Waiter apologized for his mistake.  he pushed the wrong button he says.  Another 10 mins later my alfredo arrives.  What a disapointment!  It tasted on par with a bad frozen meal.  No flavor and the sauce was not creamy/cheesy.  Waiter asks how everything was and I told him that it tasted awful.  He offered for a manager to come over but really what can you do? It is what it is... awful.   I didn't have time to send it back but it would have been nice if he voluntarily took it off the bill but he did not.  I paid $12 for about 6 bites.  I am not on a diet but I try to make good choices and if I am going to eat something highly caloric, then it better be worth an hour in the gym.  This was not worth it so didn't want to take it home either. It took another 10-15 mins to get our check.  Whole process was about 90 mins and only 20 was spent for eating.  I had to use vacation time to cover the time loss back to work which was another irritation.  Im bumping a star because I could have spoke up a little more and calamari was good.  Otherwise, this reminds me why I only come here maybe once a year.  Its nothing to write home about."
La Sandra H.,"Sacramento, CA",5,2,,5.0,4/24/2017,"I would like to thank Aimee Grimes, Issac Iacuaniello, the waitresses, and especially Kenneth Raymond at the Natomas BJ's from the bottom of my heart. They made the best day of my life (my wedding day 04.20.2017) go as smoothly as I imagined. They were all polite and professional. They were able to work with my reception party of 35 people on a busy Thursday evening. They took our orders with a smile and served our food hot, and in a timely fashion. They got every order right; in fact, I got compliments on their service from our family & friends. This location (Natomas BJ's), is a place that my husband & I dine frequently, & will continue to, especially with a friendly staff & great atmosphere!  Thank you again, to the Natomas BJ's! xoxoxo, Mr. & Mrs. Hart"
Robert H.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,4,4,1.0,11/29/2017,"Let me start off by saying if your in the service industry you should learn how to serve. When you say your gonna bring something, then bring it. Don't carry on a conversation with your coworkers about you weekends plans and forget your at work. Second listen to your patrons. When we have to repeat an order several times and your right next to the person, maybe you should get a hearing aid or maybe clean you ears. Lastly, if your food is cold when they bring it out, don't argue with the patron and ask them, ""Are you sure?"" Are you serious? Wow. Maybe you should enroll in a class at a local college and take a class called Customer Service."
Mike S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/24/2017,"Update on this, I received a message from the manager Isaac who felt bad about my experience, was very apologetic about it and wanted to fix he sent me a complimentary gift for a meal, I went in this evening and had excellent service, our server was makayla who was one of the best waitresses iv ever had, will definitely return"
T C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,96,13,3.0,11/17/2017,We decided to come here for dinner and arrived before the dinner rush. Food was mediocre and so was service. My sliders that I ordered looked very sad and not appealing. The fries had way too much salt
Cindy W.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",299,187,707,5.0,1/16/2016,We always come here to order their BBQ chicken pizza ! It taste amazing! The Oder for a regular crust takes about 25 or 30 mins. For starters we had chicken wings which always goes good with a beer.  For dessert their was a special pumpkin poozokie. It tasted like pumpkin pie with a cookie and scoop of ice cream on the top.
Cassandra C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,1,5.0,9/1/2017,"Service was good, got there at 11 pm they closed within an hour. Very generous of taking me in last minute!"
E. B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,16,9,1.0,9/1/2017,DO NOT order BJ's on DoorDash. BJ's does not make the food in a timely manner. They put doordash orders on the back burner they do not take precedence!
Matt F.,"Palmdale, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/15/2017,Wow you never really know what to expect at a bjs I quit coming because the bjs in Palmdale California ruined my bjs experience but our server Michael straight hit a homerun thanks for your knowledge on ingredients on the menu items including beer yes he knew that the buns on the burgers had a parmesan cheese crust haha I dont need  Google my wife knows everything didnt believe me and Michael settled it Thanks buddy!
Nic C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,49,4,3.0,4/16/2017,"We were told it would be a 15 to 25 minute wait.  Gave us a free pizza slice sample.  Wait turned out to be far shorter than that.  Yay! Waiter explains they have new tablets for order taking, just rolled out a couple days ago, so please be patient. He was awkward.  Understandable.  There were three of us.  He completely missed one drink order. A couple round of drinks.  Takes an eternity to place orders.  Two plates come out cold.  Actually all three, but one was a salad, LOL.  Cold wings.  Sent them back.  Brought one plate out.  Still waiting on the second.  So one person is at the table with nothing to eat. :(  Just like when one person was at the table with nothing to drink.  :( To their credit, they did offer soup and salad for those with cold wings.  (No, thanks.  We want what we ordered please.) They end up giving us all three plates for free.  Drinks are expensive.  Lots of ice with just a little margarita. Surprising experience for such a popular and well established chain!  The word ""farce"" came up, LOL. Had the cold wings, motion to the waiter, he nods, talks to the next table, then leaves!  Like, he forgot that fast?!  Poor guy was literally sweating bullets.  We had a lot of extra glasses on the table for a little too long.  I also asked for extra napkins early on, which never arrived. We had been there for an hour before the cold wings finally arrived!  It was laughable.  Ended up getting the wings to go, LOL. Granted, it's Easter, but it wasn't that crowded.  The initial wait time forecast caused a raised eyebrow because there were visible empty tables... The cobb salad is excellent!"
Irvin M.,"Elverta, CA",0,8,11,5.0,4/29/2017,I had mozzarella sticks with Ribs and Fries. Not too many places can cook everything to perfection but i had no complaints. The service was great i never had to ask for a refill and even on Prom night we were still seated within 10 min
Shawn C.,"Sacramento, CA",28,14,20,5.0,8/6/2017,I love the ahi Tuna salad it is the best! The bison burger is also very good. It's kid friendly and they provide crayons and kids menu to draw on. Tv with sports and tons of beers to choose from. This is a great family diner destination.
Jennifer W.,"Sacramento, CA",49,13,2,4.0,2/21/2017,"BJ's is always hit or miss for me. Much of that has to do with service. Although I will admit we had to wait about 15 minutes to finally be seen by our waitress. Once we were the service was really impeccable as far as a chain restaurant is concerned. The Portobello burger was delicious, the hubby got the chicken avocado club and a root beer pulled pork sandwich rounded it out. We also ordered a green flash ipa, they now offer a honey peach tea (sidenote- there seems to be 2 options of peach tea. I was brought both. The version I thoroughly enjoyed came unsweetened with just the rt notes of peach and slightly sweetened with the honey. Similar to what you would get from a tea place without the boba. The other brought to me sickeningly sweet), and also a strawberry lemonade. All in all we had an enjoyable lunch and would come back to this location again."
