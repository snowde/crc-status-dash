Jhoana P.,"Turlock, CA",12,44,,2.0,6/24/2013,"The food and drinks were blah for the price. I had been to another BJs and my experience had been better. I had a fruity drink that was way to weak and small to justify the $10 price. We had two appetizers and the avocado rolls weren't as good as at the Cheesecake Factory. We also had a pizookie and the cookie part was way over cooked and dry. Overall the only thing I like about BJs is the name, just because I get a chuckle out of it."
Tony H.,"Roseville, CA",27,94,23,3.0,6/16/2012,"BJ's is like Friday's with craft beer. The food has to all be pre-made and microwaved/ quickly prepared. I used to really like the avocado egg roll, but as of late they just aren't as tasty, not sure why. The artichoke dip is good, but the colorful chips you get wit it are greasy. I have never had the pizza there so cannot speak to it.  The beer however is GOOD! If your taste buds are forgiving, you'll like it."
rahboodrie s.,"Sacramento, CA",6,18,6,3.0,3/12/2012,"UPDATE:  Visited here on 3/10/2012.  I know, I know...I said I wasn't coming back unless there was a get together, right?  I have to eat a bit of crow but 1)had family come visit and we needed a last minute place to eat 2)it is super close to home.  Doesn't this constitute a ""get together""?... Has service improved in my opinion? NOPE!  Service is still at a snails pace however, everyone was happy with there order...when it finally arrived.  The food servers and waiters were nice though!"
Jennifer R.,"Sacramento, CA",6,78,17,4.0,11/13/2011,"I don't think I've ever been disappointed in this place. The food is great and the atmosphere is super comfortable and relaxed. It seems like every time I find a favorite dish, I end up finding another I love. Their fish tacos are pretty much the best I've tried anywhere and they have this chicken dish that is to die for (parmesan-crusted chicken). Not to mention their desserts and appetizers are yummy. This restaurant also offers appetizers and meals that are healthy and smaller proportioned which is a fantastic idea for anybody on a diet or just watching their food intake.  They serve a great selection of beer and ""girly"" drinks. And another great quality about this restaurant is it's for every age and sure to even please those ""picky"" eaters in your family. No matter what location you go to, it's consistent. Great restaurant!"
Akina A.,"Japantown, San Francisco, CA",22,8,3,1.0,4/10/2015,This place was just frustrating to me. I came in here last night took 15 minutes to be greeted by a server and they got all of our food wrong. We came today again since it was one of our friend's birthday/graduation lunch. It took 5 minutes to be seated since we were a walk in of 9 people. I didnt mind since I know how it is to work at a restaurant. Then it took 10 minutes to be greeted by a server after that it took almost half an hour for our food to come out the server didnt check up on us or anything then later on she came by when we all got our food already and asked if we needed anything else then she started talking about her life story. Im sorry but i dont care how busy you are and what you wanna do after work. You were horrible. You didnt even bother to come by and say that our food is coming soon at least or apologize. Second thing half of our food was cold we didnt want to send it back because we didnt want to wait another 20 minutes for the same food we ordered the first time. Im sorry but this BJ sucks I rather go somewhere else.
Barry B.,"Lincoln, CA",6,41,2,4.0,3/9/2014,Eat in the Roseville location as well as the Natomas one and have not had a bad meal yet. Great service too!
Devin T.,"Sacramento, CA",13,24,,3.0,8/14/2011,"BJ's offers good chain food and above average beer.  The menu has a frightening variety, and I always end up a little overwhelmed (in a good way).  The buffalo chicken pizza is awesome, as is the breaded chicken and the turkey cobb sandwich.  Unfortunately, the personal sized deep dish pizzas end up being mostly crust, so bring a friend and get a larger size.  The flatbread pizzas are great.  They sell them as appetizers, but they are meal-sized. I wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.  Most of the entrees are well over 1000 calories, and when my fiancee ordered off the ""healthy"" menu, her tilapia was terrible. The beer is not on the level of most microbreweries, but is still better than the offerings in a non-brewery.  If you like dark beer try the Tatonka stout.  The Jeremiah red is the best medium-bodied beer they offer in my studied opinion."
Eddy A.,"Rio Linda, CA",4,64,5,1.0,1/11/2011,"Over priced, over booked, over-rated, food is so-so The place is a zoo on weekends...... Pro side, their selection of beers is pretty good. Good place to bring screaming kids, the place is soooo noisy that no one will notice your screaming brat...."
Katie Jo L.,"Sacramento, CA",35,20,1,1.0,12/27/2013,"Super slow service, it took 30 minutes to get waters.. the appetizer (soggy eggrolls) were haphazardly placed on the plate... no dipping sauce... our beers took 45 mins to get to the table, after we finish the appitizer. Both our food and apps went to the wrong table before getting to us... and we thought getting there by 5:00 would help expedite service. Overall just a terrible experience!"
Dana P.,"Manteca, CA",0,28,1,3.0,8/25/2013,Food was typical BJs food. Server was nice but food service was way slow considering it wasn't busy at all.
Clarissa C.,"Los Angeles County, CA",50,241,14,4.0,12/19/2011,Here for business...was totally starving. Read the reviews and tried the honey-crisp chicken salad. Totally hit the spot! I did the curb side ordering service. They were ready with my food. Would come back again if in the area. Parking is a bit crazy. Took me awhile to get to the curb side parking spots.
Patrick H.,"Sacramento, CA",93,113,79,3.0,1/12/2014,"It's a chain and I'm sure you've all been there before and know what the average tasting food is like. So I will focus on this location and my experiences with it. Wait times for tables on any weekend night is ridiculous. You'd think the food was free. But I guess when you want to go somewhere with generic food to celebrate a friend's bday or have a big get-together with friends or family bj's is ideal. They seem to have a difficult time splitting bills for large parties as they always seem to mess it up somehow. On the plus side they have a good selection of draft beers and there's always their saving grace, the pizookie. #rtb"
See H.,"Sacramento, CA",56,5,1,1.0,4/25/2015,"I usually enjoy my stay at this Bj most of the time, but this time was just an disappointment after another. My bf and I got there and the host did not greet us at all. We stood there like idiots, then finally a nice lady came up to us and got our name and we had to wait. Two other couple came after us but got seated right before us. Got seated and then waited for a good 7 mins for our waitress to serve us water. We waited another 25-30 mins for our food to come, which we understand because it was somewhat busy. Our food came and it was a disaster! My bfs burger came with no lettuce, tomatoes, pickles or onions! He ordered medium rare but got a dry piece of meat in his burger..my Alfredo noodles was dry and some strings of the noodles was hard. My dish was warm, almost cold. My bf told the waitress that his burger came with no greens. She told us that the guy must've switched his burger with someone else and she went to go grab some greens which took her 8 mins...(after around this time, it wasn't busy at all) she came back and placed the plate of greens on it but didn't even apologized for what happened. Got our check and placed my card in the folder and she came to grab it right away. As when we were walking past the hosts, none of them said ""thank you"" or ""have a nice night"", the two ladies just stood there and talked to each other. Not sure if I want to come back to this place...unfortunately it's the closest one to me. Sorry BJ, y'all staff disappointed me this time. *thumbs down*"
Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",446,2659,990,4.0,12/30/2008,"This one is a million times better than the one at Oakridge in San Jose. Their food smelled amazing (I just had plain bread) but their road side assistance (aka order and pick up) was fast and efficient despite what seemed a million people were going in for dinner.  The burgers, fries and sides smells delish (although slightly nauseating) and my two slices of plain bread put something in my stomach.  Everyone got burgers and fries.. the salad looked fresh...  The van was silent as people ate after a long day..."
Tommy A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",28,123,4,1.0,2/18/2015,"5 stars for our server who was very attentive and professional.  Was in last night, ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls, as well as Marg flat bread and both were really bad.  I eat the rolls at ever BJ's location I go to and these were soggy, no crunch and after each bite, the avocado would squeeze out the ends.  For the flat bread, most of the outer parts were completely bare of cheese, sauce and Tomato.  Looked like whoever cooking these items just tossed things around and did not pay attention to any detail.   Very disappointed with this location on a slow night."
Mike B.,"Vallejo, CA",22,1,,2.0,2/8/2013,"I gave it 2 stars because of the food not the service me and my family had!!... Jason being the waiter gave us excellent treatment also the kitchen manger was just a all around cool dude. Now the food! Taste was good not going to lie... Just not what I expected... The Deep dish pizza wasn't DEEP or Saucy I was craving for a hot oven pan filled with tomato sauce,cheese,sausage,onions,pepperoni and more cheese steaming hot as well.. but instead they brought out a thick fluffy style type pizza that was far away from what I wanted and so that being said i was disappointed...oh yea and the baked potato hardly had anything on it my son said ""I thought it was going to be loaded"" but it wasn't! The beer and drinks 10 stars most def.. So if getting your drink on is your plan! This is the place."
Annie L.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,24,17,3.0,3/14/2014,Gotta say BJs is one of my favorite restaurant.. but when I'm on a busy schedule and going home after a 12 hour shift I phone in my orders. I called in and the front desk transfered me to the Togo desk. It took almost 15 minutes til I hung up and re dialed again. The second time it took about 5 minutes. Picked up the food went home... There was no utensils in the bag and the cup for my soup was covered in claim chowder. .. come one at least wipe it off for your presentation!
Razza M.,"Sacramento, CA",47,241,6,2.0,11/27/2010,"We read the good reports on BJs and I was keen to visit. It's a shame there were so many people and our server, Lionel, pretty much dumped stuff on our table, reached over others to place drinks and dropped the food off with haste. One star for the place One star for the pizza"
Joann P.,"Sacramento, CA",479,369,2286,3.0,9/26/2011,"I come here for the Fried Calamari ,Stuffed mushrooms, and clam chowder! Everything else is just blah!! Don't get the strawberry lemonade here!! so freaking Sweet!! Taste like i was sipping on sugar water! Oh and the service....Slow as hell!! Took forever just to get our drinks. oooh and the hostess at this BJ was not friendly at all! She didn't smile once. Wasn't sure what was up her...a**!"
Tria H.,"Del Paso Heights, Sacramento, CA",32,38,3,4.0,2/9/2014,This place is always awesome. I like the atmosphere here. Not as big as the one in Natomas. Food portions seem to be the same. Good customer service as always.
