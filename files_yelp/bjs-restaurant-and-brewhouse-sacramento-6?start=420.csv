Barbara G.,"Lodi, CA",259,310,22,4.0,3/27/2013,Good food and service. Grabbed the 2 for $20.00 deal which was a lot of food for 2 people.
Mia C.,"Orangevale, CA",41,858,533,4.0,10/20/2013,We took a takeout from this location one late night. Gotta try the stuffed mushroom appetizer. So yummy!
Kelly Q.,"Sacramento, CA",70,107,46,2.0,1/12/2014,Ehh this place is ok.. not too bad i never really order any meals from here because the appetizers are always better If i do i always get a small pizza which isn't bad. But needless to say the service here STINKS!!! They are sooo slow and i have had quite a few rude servers.. people you are in the customer service industry so learn how to be friendly!! They never offer a happy hour even when your in the bar area which is a big disappointment. But there food all in all is pretty food i suggest trying the shrimp lettuce wraps and the avocado egg rolls if you don't mind waiting forever to get it!
Doctor G.,"Alameda County, CA",0,1740,1,3.0,8/12/2011,"This is a really good chain restaurant.  Easy parking, large restaurant for big crowds, big menu, good service.  Well known ice cream and brownie dessert as big as a small pizza.   Large private room for big parties.  Lots of TV's for sports viewing."
Melissa C.,"Sacramento, CA",67,51,,4.0,1/3/2011,"This place is always busy!  I love coming here after work to a get a drink or two with coworkers. Their tomato bisque is absolutely amazing!! It has a nice cheesy taste that mixes well with the tomato. They add these delicious croutons too!! Their pizzas are very tasty. They have a variety of interesting combos. The best part of BJs is their pizookies!! Oh dear, it's like heaven in your mouth!"
Halani X.,"West Sacramento, CA",35,108,40,2.0,1/22/2011,"Not impressed with this location's food. We ordered a Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Cajun Chicken Pasta. The pizza came out with uneven toppings, one slice didn't have ANY chicken, onion, celery at all (just sauce). Looked half-assed. The pasta dish was edible, but nothing special. Lots of sweet from the tomato sauce (almost too sweet) and the chicken was coated in flavorless ""seasoning"". At least I know what not to order next time. Other dishes I've had in the past here have been better. Otherwise, service was good."
Amanda M.,"Sacramento, CA",65,16,,4.0,5/11/2011,"This place is pretty good. I love the food and the drinks, but on occasion they can be a bit slow. I haven't tried the beer but their mixed drinks are delicious. My son loves the food on the kids menu and loves going there. It is definitely a family-friendly restaurant, as well as a good place to have happy hour.  The staff are always very friendly, however, like I said before, they can be a bit slow. I understand that place gets very busy, especially on Kings game nights, but even when its not busy, the kitchen and staff can be slow. Not all the time, just on a few occasions when I have been there has it been painfully slow."
Rosie l.,"Sacramento, CA",56,16,2,2.0,1/18/2014,"We have been going Bjs for a long time and found this visit to be disappointing. The service was terrible and the good was just as bad. I ordered the margarita flag bread and the sauce was extremely sugary. I didn't know if it was a one time thing or made to be this way. I approached the waitres and she said she would go test it in the back and tell them. It felt as if she did not care that I didn't enjoy my meal. After coming here so many time and enjoying the good and atmosphere, this made me want to never try again. It was extremely sweet and the reaction to my concern was disrespectful. It seems the customer service, food, and atmosphere is not going to the right direction."
Brett S.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,2.0,9/27/2014,"Went today for lunch. .. saturday. I specifically asked for my order ""to come out hot,  even if you have to put it in the microwave"". I often order the baked potato and it is older/tough and never hot. It is always at room temp and the cheese butter doesn't melt nicely. Anyhow knowing what to expect asked for it to be hot. It was promptly served. .. not very good quality and true to form...room temp. This is not just a problem at the natomas location but same experience at roseville. Manager came out with the potato hot this time. Great job in taking care of it. Upon finishing my meal was deciding on desert when I noticed my glass that I had been drinking out of was completely dirty and had Crap all inside the walls. It looked like pulp from lemonade but I had a Dr pepper. Anyhow let the waitress know and asked for my bill. .. no apology or any ownership over the disgusting experience that I just finished a glass full of yuck! My friend then also pointed out the dirty walls at our booth. Hopefully Management reads these yelps and incorporates a little more pride in operations."
Dusty L.,"Orland, CA",1,33,3,4.0,2/16/2014,"Ive been here several times and have never, ever had a bad meal. Their pizza and burgers are amazing the service has always been good. Its a great place with a huge menu. Their cheesebuger pizza is awesome. We will definitely be coming back."
Julie S.,"Sacramento, CA",155,90,61,2.0,4/4/2013,"Food was over cooked, service was bad, the only time it was good and quick was when they dropped off the bill and came back by 2 min later to pick it up. The serve we did get passed us off to some else so they could leave and after that we were pretty much forgotten. Also the other server didn't go home we watched him serve other tables till we left. Don't think I will be going back."
Nikole G.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,45,23,1.0,10/18/2012,"Finally got an hour and a 1/2 lunch!! Wooohoooohohohoo! At least that was what I was screamin when I suggested that my group of 5 co-workers run to BJ's for their lunch special. Boohooooo was what we all wailed as we ran out the door with two minutes to spare before our lunch was over and possibly being fired in the horizon. We arrived at 12:10, Ordered at 12;30. Got our drinks at 12:45. Finally, after waiting for our waiter Jason to come back to our table, asked for our food to be brought right along with boxes, since we already finished our drinks and didn't have time to eat...@ 1:10. Our waiter Jason said ok, turned away with a scowl and immediately shook his head like...""How dare they change their minds and decide not to wait 20 more minutes for their food! How rude! Don't they know who I am??"" Needless to say- poor service after that point. 2 minutes later he brought our checks... At 1;20 my group was waiting at the front desk for our food, because we really needed to get going, plus we had already paid for our food-so we couldn't leave!! At 1:28pm they finally brought our food. The manager said he was going to get us food vouchers for making us wait so long...walked away, and we never saw him again.  We never  got   any  food  vouchers.                BJ's dropped the ball on this one."
Michael S.,"Sacramento, CA",120,44,22,4.0,9/17/2013,Love the chicken wings and Santa Fe salad!
Dee Z.,"Converse, TX",0,11,2,2.0,9/14/2014,"Had the pizza. In a word, poor. Tasted just like Pizza Hut-greasy, scant sauce, doughy, gross. I sent it back and the server credited my ticket appropriately. We've been here a couple times and it's always been mediocre. Time to cross it off the list and move on. I recommend detouring to Mimi's Cafe next door."
Monica M.,"Sacramento, CA",180,213,38,4.0,9/9/2010,"Erica C. beat me to it!  We went here today because my dining partner got a flyer in the mail for a special for the month of September.  Your choice of 2 soups or salads, a medium pizza and a pizookie for $20 bucks. We each ordered the salad and decided on the Artichoke & Spinach pizza.  The pizza was delicious. Artichoke hearts, spinach, mozzarella & cream cheese (yes, cream cheese) make this a one-slice-and-I'm-full kinda meal.  You know what that means, leftovers! We could barely finish the Triple Chocolate Pizookie. Chocolate heaven for sure :)  They don't advertise this in the restaurant but it's a great deal. I may be back before the month is up."
Bradford L.,"Antelope, CA",8,125,2,3.0,11/13/2013,This place is convenient and comfortable. You can come in be seated and blend into the background. The food isn't noteworthy. I was feeling generous last time I reviewed this place.
Terese L.,"Roseville, CA",9,104,17,1.0,11/13/2013,Slow service. Shitty beers; tasted watered down. Charged full price during happy hour. We waited over 10min before even being acknowledged for drinks; I eventually had to hunt down another server just to find our server. No refills. Meals took forever. There's many other restaurants in the area; go somewhere else!
S W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,3,4.0,4/9/2014,"Another family favorite .. been here w just my hubby, w the family & as a larger group the day my hubby & i got Married each time we had a good waiter(ess) food & drinks are always good a favorite is the (not sure of the specific name) teriyaki Salmon & rice dish/meal :) Although I ordered take out once & won't be doing that again... I'm not sure if serving sizes are different then when you eat at/in the restaurant but I was very displeased w not only the portions of what we ordered (4 meals) but the quality of it too - it was Nothing like we'd had in previous/post visits"
Stephanie P.,"Lodi, CA",94,4,20,1.0,2/1/2014,"I would give this BJs no stars...horrible place, not good service at all and even when we tried to work with them on little things going wrong no help at all. We had no water, food took soooo long an was cold, orders were wrong or mixed up, waitress would not split the bill in anyway - she told us ""do it yourself at the end"". I even got up the check with the manager and just let him know things were just kinda going wrong but he never came back to our table. We have been here for four hours!!! Horrible! I would never come back here again nor go to another BJs from this one experience. Sad day all because of horrible company and their policies."
Romain C.,"Jersey City, NJ",23,89,67,5.0,6/7/2013,"Yum porter. I had calamari yum. Then I got the Parmesan crusted chicken yum. Ended with brownie with ice cream yum! So this place is BANGIN'! Javier was a great server. Wish we have BJ's back in jersey, not talking about the wholesale club."
