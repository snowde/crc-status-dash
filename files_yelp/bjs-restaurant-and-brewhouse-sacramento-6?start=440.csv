Michael H.,"West Sacramento, CA",440,212,415,4.0,12/30/2010,This is a good place for large groups for family and friends. I like chicken and avocado so I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with skinny fries and it was good!  The service was good and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.
Shane T.,"Sacramento, CA",155,267,79,4.0,7/7/2011,"Here is why I can give four stars for my first BJ's visit. I don't come when it's packed. I stopped in 7/3/11, that's a Saturday at 3:30 and got a booth for three including my eleven year old daughter. She was pleased with the kids menu.  Ultimately the food was good and we enjoyed the service of our waiter Sammy. The kids menu is great and very reasonably priced. For an appetizer the wings were just crisp enough on the outside and steam could be seen coming from them after tearing out a bite. Awesome! My chicken club sandwich and string fries were exactly what I expected. Nothing over the top but not below par either. It was exactly what I would expect from a chain restaurant. They are not trying to serve gourmet, but they covered the fundamentals on basic dishes. My girlfriend had the chicken oriental salad that did not disappoint. With my two Nit Wit beers(Belgian), this was a good weekend lunch for sixty bucks with tip included."
Brenda B.,"Sacramento, CA",420,479,7342,2.0,10/20/2010,"This place is not what's cracked up to be. The place looks fun and hip but the food is disgusting.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich.... it was cold, saltly, no flavor. Fries was also way too salty, cloeslaw was ok.  I tasted my friends, mini deep dish pizza, it was too greasy to really enjoy, tastes like pizza hut pizza.. i don't like pizza hut.  The avocado rolls were decent, but also very rich.  Overall, I would never pick this place for serious eats... but i guess, its a fine place for  big get togethers and beer drinking..."
Chuy S.,"Sacramento, CA",143,13,2,1.0,5/24/2014,"I came in with a larger party. William was our original server. We waited a 20 min on drinks. Another 20 for out server to even take out order though all of our party was ready to order. A couple of us ordered appetizers and after 45 minutes we finally went to speak to a manager. Apparently our server put out appetizers in with entrees to come out at the same time even though we ordered both. Normally appetizers come first but we got entrees and appetizers at the same time. The manager tried to make it seem like it was our fault saying that's how the order was placed so that's how they put it in. As soon as the manager came to out table all the food came out after a 45 min wait and drinks got refilled. How convenient.  The server john took over afterwards and things got somewhat better. Though our foods didn't have sauces or missing ingredients food was okay.  Overall Horrible service. I wouldn't recommend this place, considering this happen when it was pretty slow . Slow enough for a group or hostess and servers to be standing at the front desk. Thanks for ruining a birthday dinner bjs."
benji s.,"Sacramento, CA",24,64,3,4.0,8/8/2011,"I try to avoid food chains as much as possible but on nights i just wanna relax with good friends in a 5 mile proximity bj's is the place to go.  Always starting off with a Jeremiah red to get my quick buzz going, I venture off into munchie mode which usually includes ordering everything off their happy hour menu. i would sit here and write a whole sentence for each appetizer but im not going to, well because they're actually all pretty damn good. I will tell you that i do order the fried artichokes every time.. who doesn't love fried artichokes? The balsamic glazed chicken breast, BOMB."
Justin C.,"Boston, MA",37,174,1,3.0,11/6/2010,"Food: 4/5 (not considering it's a bit fatty) Price: 3.5/5 Service: 2.5/5 I came here a couple of times and the food is always good. The tomato bisque was sooo good. You can't so wrong with any of their pizzas. I love Chicago style so it definite works for me. And if you come here, then get a pizooky. That partially under-cooked giant cookie is always made perfectly.  The lunchtime menu is fairly cheap. My friend and I only spent about $15 (not counting the tip) together. We ordered a personal pizza and a sandwich with fries. Each comes with soup or salad.  They only thing I can pick at is the waitstaff. A few times they gave me the check pretty early on. Like within 5-10 minutes I got the entree. I was maybe halfway done with my food. And there was plenty of seating most of the times it happened.  Anyway, that happening a few times was a bit annoying. My last experience it happened again and I wasn't surprised. But then the server took my food before I was even done. I mean yeah it was just like a third of my fries left, but I wasn't done! Not cool!! I wrote it on the receipt that I wasn't done. She ran after me when I got 20 feet off the premises. Scared me! She was somewhat apologetic, but a bit fake. Meh.  Other than the sometimes ""bad"" service, the food is always good. Maybe don't come if you're on a diet, even if you're ordering salad haha (but serious, no joke!)"
Alvin A.,"San Diego, CA",40,75,152,4.0,11/11/2010,"The restaurant's a good spot to bring family & friends for lunch/dinner or just hangout and watch a game over beer & pizza/appetizers! The deep dish cheese pizzas taste great offered up fresh from the kitchen on a pan. Notables are the Hamburger, Great white, Chicken artichoke one too.  They offer other dinner entrees like jambalaya which is pretty good. They got the best true Buffalo wings in Natomas - if you like BIGGER wings than the baby one offered at nearby Hooters or Wingstop (which are still good - in their own right).   Their a ""brewhouse"" because they have their own selection of beers - which taste great - comparable to ""blue moons or shock tops"".  The bar got huge flat screens & spread out on corners of restaurant so you can catch a game at any corner. This place can get packed and will sound like your at an arena or ballpark restaurant crowd."
Nick P.,"West Sacramento, CA",3,16,3,3.0,3/20/2011,"Pretty tasty food, and the house made beer is on point, but service here is always MAD slow, and the wait staff is always quite friendly, but not the greatest at staying on top of a table's needs. Try the Tatonka stout, it's a great example of what a stout should taste like. The PM Porter is quite tasty as well."
Foodie P.,"North Highlands, CA",45,22,,5.0,11/20/2014,One of my friends and I went to grab dinner and we had an awesome time. William M was our server and he was great. It was kind of cool because he was attentive and trying hard to get us to grab desert. I ended up with another beer. I think it was the second time he serves us but he was awesome and I hope when we go back he serves us again.
Don F.,"O'Fallon, IL",161,334,85,4.0,6/5/2011,"I had the cajun jambalya it was outstanding.  Asked for it extra hot and was not disappointed.   The flatbread was exceptional.   Several different draft beers all seemed to taste odd, kinda flat.   kinda loud, was obviously a meet up place and very popular for happy hour."
Jenn N.,"Brentwood, CA",722,778,894,3.0,7/3/2008,"Boys, get your pervy asses to BJ's.  As we stood in the lobby waiting for our table, the husband and I eye spyed more than one perfect 10 meandering around this place.  Granted, I think a lot of them come here because ""their"" boys bring them here to tune them out with the sports screens but at least you will visually be stimulated. The big sport screens are nice. My only complaint was that a lot of them seemed to be on a rotation. I.E. I saw Colin Montgomerie thrown into the lake 3 times and there was footage of PB with Cower on the sidelines coaching.  I'd have to log a few visits before I could accurately comment on how they handle live events. Food: Daughter #1 ordered a chicken sandwich and wasn't impressed. Daughter #2 ordered chicken strips and thought the smiley face fries were ""clever"". Husband ordered their specialty pizza - of which I stole a few pieces of.  It was thick & oily (if I knew how many calories were actually in it - I wouldn't even go there) but really good. I got the baked potato.  They have a whole section for just their potatoes.  IMO, they'd be better off using ""select"" & ""cut"" for that section.  It wasn't cooked all the way through and was served luke warm on top of that.  The toppings were less than generous. I ordered ""a drink like that"" and it reminded me of an otter pop.  They boast that it's made with 151.  They fail to mention that it's measured with a small eyedropper. The pizookie on the other hand was simple and scrumdiddilyumptious. There was a mix up between servers and a) our server seemed semi-annoyed that we wanted to order dessert and b) it took forever to get our bill."
L M.,"Sacramento, CA",31,222,405,3.0,10/2/2010,"ok service.  She did not refill our drinks. We had to ask her to. We told our servers to do lots of stuff: give us parmesan cheese, chili pepper, ranch.  She did not rush us out so that was nice.  food is good I guess. The deep dish pizza was delicious but i felt it didn't have enough sauce on it or cheese.  We also got the mac n cheese for my little nephew from the kids meal. It was plain and not good. Needed more cheese. it tasted like noodles and butter.  The box of mac n cheese would have been better.  my sister loved the beer. Beer here is good she said.   3 stars because the last time i ate here i got really bad stomach ache for 3 days."
Genae S.,"Sacramento, CA",18,40,31,4.0,10/30/2013,"BJ's is a great place to come after work to relax and unwind...good food, good service. I love there chicken sandwiches. There are always games on the television to watch as you unwind."
Steve B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,7,,3.0,2/2/2014,"It was a very busy night.  So let me say for the record that this is taking all of that into account.  The food and beer was great as always.  The bartender who served us while we waited for our table was efficient and friendly.  These are the saving graces of this visit.  The server was absent virtually the entire time--she did not bring us the check in anything approaching a reasonable amount of time either.  The worst part, however, was the absolutely deplorable condition of the men's room.  I went in twice--no tp, large puddle of urine on the ground, urine on all the seats the entire time.  Clearly they don't clean often enough.  I hope bjs corporate reads this."
Marco S.,"Oakville, CA",0,9,,4.0,3/29/2014,"Its BJ's. Its a chain. You know what to expect. Like they say, consistency is the key. My eldest brother lives near this location. Whenever we find ourselves in the need for some brew, and buffalo wings, we always stop by here. Great service. Great food. When I'm drunk at least."
Dustin V.,"Lincoln, CA",2,9,1,1.0,11/17/2012,"Sitting at my table, drink has been empty for about 10-12 minutes and our server, Melissa just brought out my pizza with the wrong toppings. Waiting another 15 minutes for the right pizza. Got my Pizzoki for free though. :)"
Tate B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",14,7,2,4.0,3/3/2014,"Lots of great beers on tap, but the large selection of food means something is going to fall through the gap. Some things are tasty and fresh while others feel like they came out of the freezer. Their gluten free pizza is surprisingly awesome. Good place for a couple of tasty beverages and an appetizer."
Mimi V.,"Elk Grove, CA",297,607,776,4.0,9/16/2010,"BJ's is a great place for happy hour. Hour hr is usually from 10-12PM M-Th. I love their pizza, each and every kind is good to me but the best one i like is the buffalo pizza. It's only 5 dollars for a mini during happy hr and it usually fills me up. Buffalo wings are the best there! I can say they are definitely one of the best wings i've ever tried. Chicken salad wrap is also tasty. Great place for beer and they usually have different beers for different hollidays and seasons. Great place for a birthday dinner or a hang out spot w family and friends. Havent had a bad server. It's basically another T.G.I.F. spot but a more nicer spot."
Maylene D.,"Pollock Pines, CA",71,208,,5.0,10/7/2013,"The food was delicious and the staff were polite and efficient.  The restaurant was clean and the food was quickly delivered straight from the kitchen, hot and cooked to our specifications.  We were there between lunch and dinner so it wasn't packed or overly crowded."
Richard F.,"Sacramento, CA",55,20,5,4.0,1/19/2011,"Can you say Pizookie? One of the main reasons to go to BJs! Aside from that heavenly treat, BJs offers a wide selection of American food. From pizzas to burgers to home-style meals, they are all spot on and are served in large portions. Then after your meal, for dessert you can have a Pizookie! So far the service here has been excellent. The waiters check your table plenty of times. What really impressed me was during a visit with a bunch of friends. They casually talked about my birthday for hardly a minute, yet somehow our waiter overheard and he brought over a Pizookie. I don't even know how he was able to hear because I didn't even see him around our table at all either. So that really surprised me! The only negative thing I can note is the noise. The music is just too loud, and since the ceilings are so high, everything in the room echoes. You can barely have a conversation. Plus, the place gets packed fast, so reservations are recommended."
