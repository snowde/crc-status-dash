Jessica H.,"Orangevale, CA",299,399,213,3.0,10/13/2010,"If you've been to BJs you know what you're going to get. For those of you who haven't I'd go for beer and appetizers or deep dish pizza. You can't go wrong with either of those. Don't try ordering Bud Light or Coors, BJs is a chain brewhouse, meaning you get their beer."
Richie C.,"Sacramento, CA",7,42,,3.0,8/10/2010,"They serve food here.  If you would like to buy food, they will sell it to you. That's typically how I feel about restaurants I'd rate a 2.5 Good atmosphere for 20 somethings.  Guys, you're going to like the waitresses; gals, you're going to like the cosmos.  So whether you're out to watch the game or you're just coming from a showing of Sex and the City 2, you'll be ok. Standard sandwich stuff.  Some people dig the deep dish pizza's.  Do you like deep dish pizza?  If not maybe don't go here.  Instead buy 3 first class tickets to Vegas and go to Social House inside the Aria (the 3rd ticket you're buying is for me) ... call me (I'm miming the the telephone thing with my thumb to my ear and pinky to my mouth.) My bill was 32.63 and I left a 5.37 tip, does that bother servers?  I like even numbers."
Priscilla V.,"Sacramento, CA",39,103,22,2.0,6/12/2013,"This review is based on my last visit. It took 20 min from the time we sat down to get water and our waiter was pretty much non existent after that.  This was by far my worst experience. I would kind of understand if they were super packed, BUT nope! We were the only table in the row. So, I'm thinking if you go after 9 don't expect much of the waiters. I ordered the Thai mango salad and It was ok. I could have made a much better healthier at home."
Jessica V.,"Sacramento, CA",21,13,,5.0,9/10/2013,"I have been here twice and both times were great. Service is great, beer is good, and food is yummy. Can't ask for much more."
Cheng S.,"Sacramento, CA",51,114,1,3.0,5/9/2011,"It's always busy so I guess they're doing something right, but I like coming for one reason...beer. Other alcoholic drink are just ok. The food is meh. Average at most (overall). Pizza is pretty good. Steak...had better (went there a few weeks ago and they ran out of them). Appetizer is ok. Pasta, well, I can do a better job.  Now, let's talk about service. It can improve. It gets hectic and service suffers. I would go back but wouldn't be my first choice."
Jeff R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",47,134,59,4.0,5/26/2013,"The menu is very diverse and anyone in your party will likely find something that will appeal to them.  This place is all about the beer; and their Jeremiah Red is hands down the best on the menu and goes great with burgers, pizza, and fish & chips.  The one complaint is the time it takes to get seated on a Friday or Saturday night but call ahead seating is offered and makes this less painful.  Service is reliably good but I have had subpar service in the past and had it take them 15 minutes to acknowledge that I existed; but the managers have done their best to make up for the poor service.  Definitely a consistent place to have a great meal and great beer!"
Alvin P.,"Daly City, CA",521,133,51,4.0,5/23/2010,"Good brew, good food, good friends. Sac is awesome. 2 pitchers of blondie. 2 large pizzas consisting of great white, bj's favorite, bbq chicken and southwestern. nothin beats a midday buzz!!"
N.J. L.,"El Sobrante, CA",59,11,,5.0,1/19/2011,"got buzzed off of 2 piranha pale ales.. got a ceaser salad with some salty ass crutons but its cool because i like salt, and cajun pasta with the blackened chicken ,that was hella good!! next time you go, whoever's actually reading this.. order that!!!  I LOVE BJ's!!!! hahaha"
Denise R.,"Bend, OR",0,5,1,1.0,12/16/2014,Very upset on how they changed the call ahead seating. When we got there before a Kings game BJ's said I had another 20-25 min to wait for a table. The call ahead only shortened my wait by 5 or 10 min. We left. The way it used to work was much better as your wait time started when u called!!
Jess C.,"San Francisco, CA",1193,2456,4428,3.0,5/2/2008,"This place is bumpin in the evenings. Who woulda figured!  The food is slightly better than average bar food, it's a nice place to chill. If you're looking to gain weight, this place is totally perfect (like every other chain restaurant here in Sac). For $15, I started with some greasy bruschetta, had a ginormous pizza with 3 kinds of meat on it, and ended with a pizookie topped with 3 scoops of ice cream. And my diet starts....now."
Brandy H.,"Carmichael, CA",53,309,34,4.0,4/23/2011,"My husband was thrilled to see that they had completely redone their menu adding tons of beer on tap and in bottles.  I had the fish tacos.  They tasted pretty good, I just wish the fish tasted fresher with less breading.  My husband ate his usual, the pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos, so yummy.  The best thing, the pazookie trio.  We choose chocolate chunk, cookies and cream, and double chocolate.  They were great. Our server was quick and efficient.  My only annoyance was the high pitched squeaky voice of the girl at the hostess area."
Daniel N.,"Sacramento, CA",4,41,1,4.0,7/19/2011,We love this place and the food. Just wish i would make it to lunch there more often the deals are great.  I love the beer there and the mixed drinks are killer too. The appetizers are great as are each of the main dishes. The hand made Pizza's are amazing and they have some very cool ones there.  I highly recommend BJ's restaurants to people who haven't tried them yet they are truly great!
Nick F.,"Roseville, CA",66,14,4,3.0,5/17/2011,"Went there for a lunch date around 1 on a Tuesday... Pros: for the amount of people (will get to that later) the service was good.  Food came faster than expected and waiter checked up on us a few times...the food was decent too. What you would expect from a chain American restaurant but was not mind blowing. Con: we arrived around 1 and that seemed like the end of the rush because it was PACKED. If there were less tables, I would have given 4 stars.  The amount of people caused it to be really loud and it was hard to have a conversation."
Sam S.,"Sacramento, CA",5,132,10,3.0,8/25/2013,Love the Jeremiah Red. The food and service could be better.
Miranda b.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,,4.0,10/23/2011,"Our party of 8 was seated quickly (although the floors are incredibly slippery!) It's a nice, large place - our big round corner booth was a nice spot although I would avoid it if you'd like to have a conversation across the table. The menu is long and the prices are okay - a medium deep dish pizza is $18 and feeds 2-3 (with appetizers), appetizers run around $3 or $8 for 'shareable' appetizer plates. I've heard great things about their pizza, but mine was disappointing. It was very, very soggy. It had clearly been sitting there for a while. Everyone else in my group was very satisfied with their food (the stuffed potatoes are delicious!). The spinach stuffed mushrooms appetizer (6 mushrooms for $3.50) were probably the most delicious thing I've had at a restaurant in a long time! The salads are filling and they don't skimp on ingredients- all fresh with great dressings. There are many vegetarian options - more than I've seen at most restaurants - and most of them are delicious enough to satisfy meat eaters. Desserts were perfect - the baked beignet, the pizookies, the apple berry crumble pie. Desserts were a great end to our meal. Our waiter was very quick- and attentive without being annoying. She was refilling drinks before we even noticed they were empty!  Although our pizza was far too soggy, I'd give them another chance based on the rest of our experience."
Lucha O.,"Sacramento, CA",48,20,25,4.0,5/4/2011,"You'd think with so many menu options, they might fall short when it comes to taste. NOPE! Fiesta, Italiano, Asian... they do it all so delicious!  There's a bit of a wait on a Friday night... but that just goes to show how dang good the food is! I love that they have healthier options. I wouldn't dare order one of those heavy-duty crust pizzas, but I can tell you the flat bread pizzas are scrumptious! I love the avo-spring rolls and lettuce wraps. Thai shrimp, balsamic chicken... yum! (no, I'm not a pig, I've been several times)"
Miles C.,"Sacramento, CA",125,114,24,3.0,9/3/2010,"A lot of people talk about the Pizza here and I have no intention of getting a pizza at a place that isn't a pizzeria.  I don't get Egg Rolls at Chili's either, I'm weird like that.  The pizza may be fantastic, i simply don't know. The soup here is actually I think the high point.  The chili is good though quite mild but the other soups are tasty and the bread bowls they can be served in are excellent.  The Large jacket potatoes are also quite good though i am often left with a lot of unadorned spud which is a problem for me.  The Cajun pasta here is a let down, the sauce is this sort of bruschetta topping stuff that is chunky and doesn't cling to the noodles and the chicken is blackened but the spice mix is pretty sweet for my taste. The Pizookie here is their big desert draw and while my girlfriend is in love with their super chocolate version it was too rich for my blood.  The other versions are like a soft baked cookie in a deep dish pizza pan with a scoop of ice cream.  Nothing terribly inventive but there is a reason everyone serves cookie sundaes, they are delicious. The food here is always pretty good, the service is sometimes good but never great and gets horrible when they are busy.  Nothing here is to die for but everything seems to be quality (though sometimes misconceived as with the cajun pasta)."
Brian J.,"Sacramento, CA",11,7,10,1.0,10/13/2013,Did not get the order right 3X. Had to ask for coffee 3X. Ordered a bowl of soup and received a cup. No chives with potato. Had to wait almost one hour to be seated. Two Pazookies were not available. How ridiculous this place is.
Gary S.,"Glendale, CA",56,53,22,2.0,11/25/2012,"Ordered the Mahi, Mahi and although it tased ok, the presentation was horrible (looked like it was scraps being delivered to a homeless person) and the amount was about two bites."
Joelle O.,"West Sacramento, CA",143,90,15,5.0,5/13/2013,My entire family loves going to BJ's. The quality of the food is excellent. You do have to wait quite a while during busy times and they don't take reservations. You can call ahead and let them know how many are in your party and they let you know about how long the wait time is. That is helpful. I always get their Balsamic glazed chicken. It is wonderful. The pizza is great as well as the poke! Everything we have tried has been a hit. We will always go back because you know you can get a fabulous meal at a descent prices.
