Janae W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",121,25,2,4.0,2/7/2012,"One of my favorite go-to places when I want a yummy gluten free meal that isn't going to make me sick later. LOVE their cocktails, LOVE their gluten free pizza, and SO EXCITED about their gluten free pizookie. I've never gotten gluten poisoning here and the service is almost always spectacular."
Bill E.,"Kansas City, KS",3,20,,5.0,4/27/2013,"Staff always does well, entertaining and the food is consistently great.  House hefe is my favorite!"
Scott B.,"Sacramento, CA",20,30,11,4.0,10/6/2010,"THE GOOD: -Excellent deep dish pizza.  Come here for the pizza and you'll leave happy.  Large specialty pizza or 4 topping of your choice is 24 bucks, and worth every cent.  Ordering online for takeout is a cinch, I wish more takeout/pizza places would follow suit. -The caprese salad is like 3 bucks and one of the highlights.  Surprisingly, the tomatoes were fresh and ripe and actually had FLAVOR!  Crazy, right?  Especially from a chain.  This appetizer/salad is quite frankly a STEAL, and is a large portion.  There is no reason NOT to order it. -If you like frank's red hot sauce/buffalo wings, try the buffalo pizza, it's one of my favorites.  -Good selection of beer, including bottled belgians.  Their own brews are hit and miss, though the Oktoberfest Lager is excellent right now.  Some days the same beer is great, others its skunky.  Luckily, they are happy to give tasters of their own brews, so be sure to get a sample before ordering an entire pint.   -Service at this location is decent (see my other scathing review of the Elk Grove location).    **Important note:  They have a huge menu with a large variety of italian plates, american meals, burgers, sandwiches, etc, which is good for large groups of picky people/kids, but I would stick to their pizza.  It's what they do best.  If I were to review the menu as a whole, I would have to drop the rating by a star or two."
Davina C.,"Sacramento, CA",68,55,2,5.0,9/30/2010,"I have a serious crush on BJ's restaurant. The kind of crush that is like ""I don't care what anyone says about it"" bordering on ""You'd better watch what you say about it""... I only wish there were 3 more in town so that I'd always be within 5 miles of my crush.  See?  Now it's just getting creepy.  Of all the choices, my favorite dish at BJ's is the plain ole spaghetti and meat sauce.  Simply because it's so easy to make, but most places just can't seem to get it right.  Also you can't go wrong with any of their beers but another personal favorite that is NOT on the menu is the double berry burst - half BJ's berry cider, half Lambic frambois - trust me... it's a treat and a great alternative to a beer.   Their Natomas location is always ridiculously packed, that's a given. So go with less than 4 and you won't be disappointed.  If you are, I don't need to hear about it!  :-P"
Christine R.,"Marin County, CA",1630,1015,14273,3.0,2/10/2010,"Luckily, there was no wait to have lunch w/ my friend & our kids, as we chose to do a late lunch.  I felt rushed by our waitress, and noticed people were lining up for dinner.  Patrons should feel relaxed while dining out - it's a luxury, let them enjoy it.  I usually stay for dessert & have their signature pizookies, but not this time.  Check please!  In addition, their take-out section had no employees present to take orders.  They're sure to lose out on some business w/o ample staff members at their post."
Peter M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,77,4,5.0,10/11/2012,Good food at good prices.  Staff is very friendly and the TV's are great!!  Go Giants!!!
Greggae H.,"Sacramento, CA",496,44,3,1.0,12/14/2009,"GOD DAMN IT!  I swore, never again, but my buddy had his God damn birthday dinner here. I am pretty sure they read my last review and are now trying to snuff my eternal flame.  I went to the Roseville location this time. I had to leave the party early and asked for a separate check from the group of 20. The waiters head almost caught on fire from the short circuiting that took place after being asked this question. He told me he couldn't so I proceeded to convince him that in this day and age anything is possible with a calculator and lead No. 2 pencil.  Much later the poison came. I'm pretty sure they passed around my photo and a copy of my Yelp profile. They got it from Applebee's. They are both trying to kill me.  I had a BBQ Beef samich. I missed my next appointment that evening because I was locked in my bathroom after barely making it home. SO, you try to kill me and ruin my Saturday night! Not cool. Not cool."
Jenny M.,"Saint Paul, MN",63,76,45,2.0,4/15/2010,"I had a couple of people tell me about the beer flights here, and since I'm a beer-lovin' kind o' gal, I was ready to go as soon as the opportunity presented itself. However, I was about to be sorely disappointed by my entire experience at BJ's... except for the Pizookie (more on that later).  First off, the service was not good. Not awful, but I served all through college and I know what results in this kind of service: over-management and under-respect, hallmarks of the chain restaurant server training that robs you of any individuality. Not the servers' fault, but still definitely worsens the customer experience. We also found ourselves sitting and waiting, and waiting, and waiting for service - this problem can be blamed a bit more on the server. Boring, contrived decor and atmosphere as well.  Food: way overpriced, and not at all good. I had the thai shrimp lettuce wraps, and could have made better at home with frozen pre-cooked shrimp and store-bought teriyaki sauce. Tried a bit of my co-eaters' pizza and fries, too - also nothing special, particularly for the high prices. The one bright spot was the Pizookie, which was a yummy cookie/ice cream pizza thing. It wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten, but I'd order one again.  Beer: not bad, and actually decently priced, but not worth putting up with the rest of the experience.  I couldn't decide at first if I should give this place two or three stars, since I tend to try to see the bright spots, but my general rule is if I'd go there again if dragged for a party or something and wouldn't complain too much, I give it three stars. If I got invited to a dinner taking place at BJ's, though, I'd beg, bribe, and cajole my way into trying to get it moved elsewhere. And that's why two stars is the rating of choice."
Trent C.,"West Sacramento, CA",47,70,28,4.0,1/16/2011,"Beer.....Good! Pizza.....Good! Lunch-sized pasta....Good! Piezookie..........ahhhahhhh.  sorry, i drooled a bit on the computer. Busy, but worth it."
James C.,"Woodland, CA",1,29,,1.0,8/5/2012,"Terrible... We usually go to Arden but found out about this one thats closer to us... Went there and got seated at 5:30... got seated and the dude that was supposed to be our waiter, literally looked at us, and ignored us... I thought hmm.. maybe he will come back.. Nope.. now it's 6 PM... another group comes in and he goes straight to them! As soon as that happened my girlfriend grabbed the manager and we let him know what was going on. Food was just ok too... Will not be going back, will be going to Arden from now on.  Btw the waiter was about 5'9 with blondish hair... looks like a dumbo... hopefully he gets fired or something because what he did to us was unacceptable and uncalled for."
Akash C.,"Davis, CA",101,32,10,2.0,9/30/2012,Our reservation was for 8:10. They didn't seat us until 9:00 and then took 30 minutes to bring out our 3 pizzas. When we finally got our pizza it was luke warm at best. Here's the kicker. They were neither full nor understaffed. What a disappointment..
Sarah H.,"Kansas City, KS",155,307,36,3.0,8/21/2012,"Okay got double charge, but the incorrect charge was left processing on my account for 3 days leaving me low on funds and almost making me overdrawn. Other than that this place is good for a BJs.... I did however find a stem end in my avocado egg rolls, which isnt too apactizing."
Darryl R.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,66,21,2.0,10/10/2012,Don't come here if you have time constraints.  This is the second time I came here with a reservation and had to wait.  Reservation at 6 and I finally got food at 7:30.
Abe F.,"Yolo, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/14/2009,"Tried to go to BJ's in early 2009 for my birthday, but the line was out of the door and the wait was ridiculously long (understandable of course) so my friend and I just ended up going somewhere else that evening. Fast forward many months later and I went back to BJ's with a friend, to the bar, as we had some time to kill before watching ""The Hangover."" The bartender was extremely cool and friendly and the drinks were probably the best I have ever had (he had to look up how to make what we ordered and still did a wonderful job - his first time ever making the drink). He was constantly cleaning and making sure my friend and I were taken care of. The restaurant was fairly sparse that night as it was a weekday, but I have to say that I was very impressed with the ambiance and atmosphere. My thought was that of a great place. Fast forward (yet again) a few months later and I met a friend at BJ's for dinner. The place was packed (Saturday night) but the wait was not too long. The service was excellent - the food was average (but I believe that to be more about what I ordered and not of what can normally be expected from the establishment). My friend and I had a lot of time to kill before a movie so we really took our time enjoying our meals and having good conversation. We were never rushed by any of the staff. Went back a week or two later as I heard the pizza is some of the best made. My friend and I were seated right away. The place was busy but not packed (it was a Sunday evening). The waitress was extremely kind, helpful, and funny and the pizza was to me, the best that I have ever had (so much so that I ordered the same as takeout a couple of weeks later). Great place and my first 5-star review! I will return to BJ's many times in the future!"
Joe P.,"Sacramento, CA",10,151,,2.0,12/19/2011,Being a regular it is SAD to see how my last several visits have ended up.As I mentioned this is a regular stop for me but that is changing.I have really noticed how the pizza has changed.Less and less of the meat and other stuff.I actually have heard the same from several other folks.This is what they WERE famous for ! Also the service in the bar area is very sub par having to wait 10 plus to be greated after we sit down.This continued throughout the meal.She did come to our table once and tell us it will be ready in a few minutes.The place was not that busy so it is difficult to justify the poor service.All in All not a good dinning experience !
Rachel B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,,4.0,4/27/2013,"The food at BJ's is consistently good and tasty. I wish the place wasn't so noisy all the time. The thing I'm here to tell about is this: Tonight we saw on our receipt, the recently added, 'suggested gratuity"" in the amounts of 15% and 20% for our bill. However, the 15 and 20% amounts were figured on the after tax total ! Why would anyone give a tip on the tax!? I never do! I tip on the pre-tax amount, as everyone should!  I did not care for this at all and I am sure most people would not bother to think about it, but just give the suggested tip amount so they wouldn't have to figure it out. Don't be a fool! There is enough tax on things already and giving a server a higher tip because of the tax charged is not right and it's not right of BJ""s to do this on their receipts!"
Andrew Z.,"Berkeley, CA",40,61,1,3.0,1/3/2010,"If you find yourself in the land of strip-malls (aka Natomas), BJ's isn't a bad option at all.  Most restaurant chains don't have a great line-up of brews to choose from, so based on that alone they get an extra star, up from what would otherwise be a 2 for an above-average chain.  My favorite, btw, is the Jeremiah Red Ale. Typically for dinner I would think you'd order pizza here, which is very good.  I hadn't really had much else until I tried the Balsamic Chicken last night, served with mashed potatoes, crispy onion strips, mixed greens, and sauteed onions (yes that's two onions!).  The Balsamic glaze was very tangy and went great with both the onion sides.  This is a fairly healthy option for a place like this, and quite tasty, I assure you. Plus, not only do they have a large bank of TV's behind the bar to watch while you wait for a table, but you may even see a few local sport-stars there like we did last night (Kings players Jason Thompson & Omri Caspi).  Top that, Apple Bee's!!!!"
Simone H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,9,,4.0,8/31/2014,"BJ's restaurant is a good place for family dining.  Our server was pleasant, but a bit overwhelmed by our large order.  Our meals were very good.  We will return again."
Cindy C.,"San Jose, CA",114,235,60,2.0,2/14/2010,"Buffalo Chicken Pizza: Definitely had the buffalo chicken sauce that is usually found in a buffalo wings appetizer, but it didn't have enough chicken pieces!!! I thought I was eating cheese pizza on my first slice. Sampler Appetizer:  Everything was fried on that platter except the artichoke dip (which I had better elsewhere). There were mozzarella sticks, avocado eggrolls, and Sante Fe springrolls which was kind of gross and I couldn't figure out what was in there. Overall experience:  I felt sick afterwards.  The only positive thing about it is the service. The waiters we had were really nice despite our big party."
Yvonne N.,"Sacramento, CA",1409,648,1562,4.0,9/16/2009,"Just writing this review to add to my Sac Happy Hour list.  I haven't been to enough happy hours in Sac since I live in SD.. =(  My list is lacking in life!  I shall add more as soon as I discover the rest of Happy Sacramento! Anyway, I love BJ's happy hour - 4-7 and 10-close.  Half off all mini pizzas and $1 off pitchers and appetizers!!!  Each pitcher is enough for 4 glasses and they have a huge selection.  However, I always go with Hefenweizen with a few orange slices.   This particular location is nice because it's new and it's the only BJ's around the area.  In general, meaning at all BJ's locations, I would recommend the Bruschetta and the Great White (mini pizza).  My girlfriend and I loved their Bruschetta, treasured it and savored it and even saved some to enjoy at home!  AND we ordered two mini pizzas EACH.  That's right!  Order enough to take some home because their pizza is even more delicious when you re-toast it at home to make it as crispy as you want.  The Great White has chicken and garlic so if you like garlic, you'll love the hints of garlic in every piece!! Some word of advice, ask them to make it extra crispy.  Otherwise, it might sometimes come out tasting too ""dough-y"" and also because it'll make the crust sooo crunchy and perfect!"
