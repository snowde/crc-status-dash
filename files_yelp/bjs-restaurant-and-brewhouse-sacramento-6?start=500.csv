Norma Denisse S.,"Mesa, AZ",175,458,296,4.0,7/12/2010,"Its true what they say...No two are alike.  I had a much better experience at this location in Sac than the one near SF. I was given a gift card last year sometime and was holding onto it, this weekend was perfect to redeem it since my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat. He wanted something light and I wanted something filling.  I went with the Chicken Club Sandwich and Fries...It was great. The chicken was juicy not dry or overcooked the bacon gave it just the right flavor and the avocado was a great touch. The fries were too skinny! lol reminded me of super model legs ahahahahah.  Anyway, the food was good, I had a bite of my boyfriend's Cesar salad with blackened salmon. It was good too. I really wanted to have a beer since I've never had one from BJ's but it was too early for a drink.  I'm sure we will visit this place again :)"
Amie D.,"Sacramento, CA",10,18,,3.0,2/4/2013,"The elk grove location is light years ahead of this one. Some days the service is so bad and the food way undercooked, I find it to be worth the drive down there. Even the pizookies are not as flavorfull as they used to be, but that could be a personal issue."
Michelle G.,"Roseville, CA",72,35,8,3.0,10/3/2012,"We usually frequent the BJ'S in Roseville, but came to meet family to celebrate a birthday! Normal BJ'S atmosphere... a little too loud for babies or toddlers (our party had two under the age of two). However, our large party was seated in the middle of the dining floor with booths on one side an pair tables on the other, and the staff actually set couples in the pair tables, so our parties backs were literally two inches from their tables- it was ridiculous! I can't imagine why the couples didn't request to be seated somewhere else. The food was fine, we ordered pizzas and house salads. But we're disappointed to with service/ consideration not shown to the other customers."
Mona P.,"Sacramento, CA",80,98,10,2.0,8/23/2010,"BJ's is a great restaurant, the food is always good.  I recently went there for lunch and was disappointed, I ordered some french fries and they were old and cold when we got them.  The service was definitely not up to par, the waitress would quickly rush through our order and run away to the next table.  My previous service experiences at BJ's have always been good but this time the food and service was quite disappointing."
Amanda R.,"Sacramento, CA",182,67,30,3.0,6/28/2010,"Been here a few times. Not much to write home about. Most recently came here to watch the USA v. Ghana world cup soccer game when the idea of going to a pub didn't pan out like I wanted it to. The place was actually real nice and quiet at 1130am. Then 1230pm came about and the place was packed. Loud people with their loud conversations. Avocado egg rolls were so delicious. The dipping sauce was a good touch to this appetizer. Shared a medium meat pizza and was full after only 3 pieces! Decided to share a brownie desert and immediately regretted it. It was this thin piece of brownie with a 7"" pile of whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream buried at the bottom.  -1 star for the waitress trying to get us to leave fast. She kept coming back every 5 minutes asking us if we needed something else when we told her the first 3 times we were fine or asked if we were ready to pay for our bill. I hate being rushed. Not good."
Spring L.,"San Francisco, CA",722,189,43,5.0,6/18/2010,"I looooooooooooove this place! It's like the cheesecake factory, but for dudes. They've replaced the peach bellinis and cheesecakes with Belgium brews and flat screens. YEAH! I have not had a bad experience here yet and everything I've ordered was delicious! Their pizzas remind me of Pizza Hut (buttery crust.. mmm) and their club sandwich is one of the best I've ever had. and POTATO SKINS. and pizookies. oh god. =9"
Rachael R.,"Glendale, CA",16,157,26,5.0,4/19/2012,"BJ's is probably my favorite chain restaurant because their food is just damn good. I had their pot roast sandwich recently and it tasted so home-made. Also, their pizzas are chicago-style, which I like. Also, their light low fat entrees are delicious too, especially the tilapia one. The beer selection is great too. This Natomas location is always packed."
Ryan F.,"West Sacramento, CA",106,222,19,3.0,12/31/2009,"This place is always packed.  The food is fine, pan pizzas served fresh, other than that standard ""American Chain Restaurant"" fare.  Can't comment on the beer as I generally go here for working lunches. Nothing extraordinary but not terrible either.  They do seem to hire a lot of kind of obnoxious 20 somethings, but OTOH, the service is pretty reasonable. I have no idea why it's so popular, other than that Natomas is a bit starved for good places to eat.  It compares well to Chilis, Johnny Carinos and Logans, which are its immediate competition, so I suppose that answers my question."
Pia V.,"New York, NY",1795,884,1359,2.0,8/31/2009,"1.5 STAR REVIEW!! -- This just like all the other BJ's.  The pizza is good, personally I've grown partial to their buffalo chicken pizza, and the service is ok as well.  Their draft beers are pretty great, esp their Berry Burst Cider -- *yumm!!* They have great happy hour specials with discounts on pizzas, apps, and drinks.  So my boyfriend and I try to come here during those times and we sit at the bar.  The bartender/service at the bar has always been great.  It is the service that I've gotten at the tables that has always been a 'so-so' experience for me here. --- Also, my friend called in on a Sunday to ask if they did have any happy hour going on and the time of it if there was one.  The person on the other line told her that there was one from 4-7pm.  So we left our little get together and took separate cars there.  On our way there I decided to call again, just in case she may have heard them wrong.  So I called and the woman on the other line told me the same thing, happy hour from 4-7pm today at the bar.  So we get to the bar, have a seat, and what do we find out?  That happy hour doesn't start till 10pm-closing.  Even though we called TWICE and asked TWICE, they told us that the person told us wrong.  WOW ... really?!  Even though we all were told wrong by one of THEIR employees they still refused to give us the happy hour that we were told on the phone, *tisk-tisk*.  I understand that there are probably some shady people out there that are always trying to get a discount and screw people over, which is probably why they kept asking us if we knew who we talked to or whatever.  But damn, I was calling in to ask a SIMPLE ASS question!!  I truly didn't think that I needed to ask for the girl's name on the phone.  So I guess that's my bad for assuming that they trained their employees enough to KNOW when their happy hour times are.  Oh well ... They need much better communication at this place.  And seriously, I work at a restaurant myself and if I don't know an answer or am not sure of it ... I ASK!!  Don't go giving out wrong information people.  It makes for bad impressions and bitter people. If this never happened I would've given the place 3.5-4 stars.  But really, this experience just made all of us so angry.  We felt like they were treating us like scum just trying to get a deal ... when in reality we truly weren't.  And in the end, it was their fault for allowing someone so incompetent to pick up the phone and give out information.  Ugh!  Sorry BJ's, but I really am that disappointed."
KC P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/6/2013,"Was eating dinner there tonight and they screwed up the order (Bacon instead of Basil for a Vegetarian!) - so much for having dinner with my boyfriend. He was done before my meal ever came out and instead offering to comp the meal, the manger on duty threw the plate down in front of me and only offered a cursory ""Sorry"".  People make mistakes but to charge us for a meal uneatenen and a lost experience? Plenty of other restaurants available for not a cheap night..."
Jessica L.,"El Cerrito, CA",737,909,29,3.0,7/20/2009,BJs is growing on me.  It's a great place to sit at the bar and grab a $4 beer and some food.  The flat bread pizzas are just ok and the nachos are big and good but could use some extra  cheese and toppings. The beer is good! And I have never had a problem with bar seating or service here.
Steven C.,"Sacramento, CA",8,8,,1.0,10/23/2011,Sunday 3pm and the place was not busy yet still took so long for the service and food. The server was not attentive at all and didn't even apologize for her lack of courtesy or poor performance.  This is the second time this has happened here.  Never going back again.
Yves J S.,"Sacramento, CA",96,280,42,4.0,11/11/2009,"Always fun to go here with friends, especially if you like to drink. They have a full bar and a very large assortment of fresh beers. The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food and service is usually enjoyable. Stopped by Bj's and naturally the place was packed. The wait was about 20-25 minutes which was perfect since some friends had not arrived yet. I was sitting outside with a friend when the hostess that signed me in came outside and gave me some freshly made pizza to enjoy while I waited. It was not only delicious, it was free! We finally sat down and the service was quick to help and very friendly. I ordered a ribeye with the tomato bisq soup. I requested my steak medium-rare and it was ohhhh soooo delicious! The juices were just pouring out of the meat and the soup was rich and hearty. Angel our waiter was always on top of our drinks and the entire dining experience was fantastic!"
Ken O.,"Lincoln, CA",2,41,,2.0,1/25/2014,"First time visit last night.  Ordered Southern Fried chicken. Was brought 2 very tiny boneless breasts perched on a scoop of mashed potatoes in a huge bowl that made the chicken even look smaller. Also very bland. Note to BJ's - when someone orders Southern Fried Chicken, they expect it to look like a plate of food you would get in the south. Not a tiny foo-foo mess."
Johnny C.,"San Francisco, CA",5,33,1,2.0,6/8/2011,"I usually go to the one in Elk Grove (5 Stars). Went to the one in Natomas once since it's close to home. Expected it to be the same as the one in EG; food, beer, ambiance, etc.  But I had an interesting experience here that I want to share. Not even halfway through my dinner and looking to order more drinks, the waiter comes up to me and my date, tells us his shift is ending and wanted to know if I wanted to pay for my bill early.  The place was packed, so at first I thought he was rushing us out, so I told him he could bring me the bill. Then realized he wanted his tip before he clocked out.  When he gave me the bill, I ended up telling him, ""Thanks, I'll pay when I'm ready to leave, who's my new server?""  Don't ever reward a waiter that is rushing you, esp. on a hot date!!!"
Taylor W.,"Sacramento, CA",8,18,,2.0,11/27/2012,"Went here on my birthday. I came here a lot a few years ago, but after rediscovering BJ's, I was pretty disappointed. The portions used to be huge and the quality was beautiful. Now, it's very pricey and the food is ok at best. Probably will be the last time I go here."
Erick M.,"Woodland, CA",0,42,18,1.0,1/21/2014,"Terrible service.  We decided to come here on a sunday night after the niners/ seahawks game for dessert only.   To my surprise the place was pretty empty, quite a few empty tables . Though we could see the place was not packed, we still waited about 20 minutes to be sitted.  Once we got to our table, we notified our Server we only wanted dessert, she then went missing,  perhaps she figured her tip would not be a decent size tip due to us just wanting dessert, she comes back about 15 minutes later w a warm coffee, and my girlfriends  hot chocolate,   Time to get a refill on my coffee, she was MIA , comes back later on , perhaps 20minutes after she dropped off our first coffee/hot chocolate with my second refill and at that time she has the check for us...    So ... Bad experience, unnecessary waiting, bad service, did not get any more coffee , could not order more hot chocolate for my girl thou i knew there were no free refills on this, we were willing to pay for them . However, the check arrived quick and she made sure to close us out while we were still working on our dessert.  They need to train some of these employees and their mickey mouse customer service.."
Wes S.,"Lincoln, CA",41,354,23,3.0,4/12/2010,"Came here this weekend and called ahead to get our names on the list.  Were seated right away upon arriving.  Ordered a Jeremiah Red and followed that up with a Nutty Brunette.  I ate the baked potato with chicken/broccoli/cheese with a side salad.  My gf ordered French fries and the gourmet mac and cheese.  My food was good but hers not so much.  Her fries were barely warm and the mac & cheese was really not that tasty.  It wasn't a horrible dining experience just not as good as we normally have at BJ's.  We shall be back, oh yes, we shall be back."
Nikki M.,"Irvine, CA",139,42,,1.0,9/16/2011,"this place used to be good but has gone way downhill. ordered the current promotion of dinner for 2 for 20. Sounds good because you get choice of 2 salads any medium pizza and pizookie for 20. We got buffalo chicken pizza which looked good but when we bit into it it tasted like bbq chicken. the bottom layer was bbq sauce and chicken then they put the buffalo sauce and topping on top of it,. they screwed up and gave us a start of a bbq chciken asn when realized the mistake just slapped the buffalo chicken on top of it. Gross! This service and food quality has gone downhill. Im over bjs."
Kirsten D.,"Sacramento, CA",108,112,5,4.0,7/31/2011,"Not a huge fan of places like this just because I usually find the food bland and plain.  .  I will say, they get 4 stars for their small plates + 1/2 off wine tuesdays..... I love this place for that only."
