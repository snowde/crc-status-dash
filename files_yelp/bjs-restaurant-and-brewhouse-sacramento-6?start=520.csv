Dawn C.,"Sacramento, CA",5,16,1,3.0,6/26/2014,"Servers are nice, lunch service is fast, food is pretty good, they have a light and gluten free menu."
Jo H.,"San Jose, CA",210,246,13,4.0,5/29/2009,"I went up to Sac for the Britney Spears concert (yes...yes... I know).  We decided to get a bite and some drinks in the area.  I had never been to BJ's and until recently didn't realize there was one in SJ at Oakridge mall!  The place was packed w/ concertgoers and regulars.  We were given a buzzer and a 35-40 min wait time.  I think you can call ahead to be put on the buzz list.  That's something to think about if you're in a time crunch.  We decided on pizza, salad, and beer.  A winning combination right? Our pizza was half BJ's Classic Combo and half BBQ Chicken.  My friends got one of the light colored beers Brewhouse Blonde I think and I got a Nutty Brewnet (love a dark beer).  The Nutty Brewnet was good and packed a nice little punch even with a heavy meal.  I realized that when we got up from the table...whew.  I could have used a few more for the concert.  Our pizza came out pretty quickly.  I have to say I liked the Classic Combo slice better than the BBQ Chicken slice.  There was a little too much sweetness going on w/ the BBQ side between the sauce and the sweet red onion for my liking.  The crust was thick, yet crispy on the outside.  It reminded me of an old old old school Pizza Hut Pan Pizza crust but better.  Overall the service was fast even on a busy night, the pizza and beer were good.  I'll have to check out the San Jose location some time.  They do curbside take-out always a plus for me."
Mim D.,"Sacramento, CA",317,113,75,2.0,10/5/2011,"I came here with a group of friends & this place was packed! The wait wasnt too bad. I'm not much of a beer person so I chose the fruity beers lol I had the very berry beer I believed? I had the asian chicken salad that I wasn't too fond of the dressing lacked some flavor and I felt like my salad mix was an out of the bag cole slaw mix that they used and marked up the price. I've had the pizza here as well and it was mediocre. Ive just expected better and they didn't meet up to my expectations. Service was okay, just like every other place."
Isaac O.,"Sacramento, CA",41,134,1,1.0,2/20/2010,"Okay, so I've eaten here quite a few times and all has been good in the past.  The Thursday before Valentine's day, the wife and I met a few friends for an after work beer get together.  I decided to have the spaghetti and meatballs (a big mistake it turned out).  It tasted fine and my wife tasted a little and had no comment.  Later that night, we were both very ill, my wife to a lesser extent; we were up all night and into the next morning.  I'll spare all the details, but it was not pretty.  It actually caused us to delay a planned trip for an entire day and it took me a couple days more to fully recover.  After a few days while on my trip, I did manage to email BJ's about this but never heard back from them.  Suffice it to say, I don't know when I'll return to BJ's! I notice that another yelp'er review that said she ""felt sick afterwards""; this was 2/14/2010 which was 3 days after we ate there, probably not a coincidence."
Cynthia B.,"Greenwood, CA",4,61,8,5.0,10/12/2009,"love this place and location! we've had the best server in the bar area guy named Solomon, takes great care of us and I can tell of his other tables. My strawberry/lemonade never is empty b/c he somehow knows we need it before asking - that makes GREAT server!  I've had so many items on their menu, he revealed last night some new ones coming too. Highlights any mini pizza esp. the buffalo chicken (BTW are half off happy hour & during any NFL game!)  Husband LOVES their balsamic chicken, crispy onions, yummy mash potatoes...lil salad too.  I've had many salads, burgers, pasta items and NEVER a complaint about a single one. Love their pazoka desserts too."
Lorenzo G.,"West Sacramento, CA",14,14,19,1.0,9/11/2011,"I have been to this location twice. The first time I went to this BJ's, I went with a fairly large group of friends and we told the waitress that we would have to split the bill. Remember that because I'll mention it later. It took FOR EVER to have some one come and ask us what we wanted to drink and even longer to have someone take our orders. After waiting for so long, some members of our group even left the table to go order food at the bar. They got their food shortly after we got our drinks. When we FINALLY got our food, I got the wrong order. It was to go to the family behind us. When I let the waiter know, he just took the plate and gave it the man that ordered the dish. What if I talked or sneezed on it? When I finally got my order it was over cooked and the chicken was burnt. How do you mess up Chicken Alfredo? Hell, I can make it better than them!  I was reluctant to eat here a second time but I figured maybe they only sucked that one day. I was wrong. They just suck. Our server was nice but the food and my drink was awful. The appetizer was better than my burnt turkey burger. I couldn't even taste the turkey, just that burnt left-on-the-grill-too-long taste. The fries were OK. I ordered a Lemon Drop which wasn't nearly as thick and blended as the picture in the menu made it out to be. It was watered down, strong and diluted at the same time, and I could hardly taste any lemon in it. I had the waiter take it back and he said he'd have it taken care of. I never received another one but he didn't charge me for it and he waved the charges on my other two drinks (two Pepsi's) so that was very nice of him. I don't think I'll be going back here again. I'll just stick with the Cheesecake factory and enjoy the awesome Lemon Drops they have there.  (To the waiter who might recall this: your service was great but the food was awful. I think you're doing a great job but the cooks prepare dishes that leave much to be desired)"
Mia D.,"Sacramento, CA",542,295,65,3.0,1/28/2010,"Everytime I've been here this place has been busy.  And not just busy, it's extremely busy.  I'm usually here whenever someone is celebrating their birthday.  I think it's because of their birthday pazzookie...nom nom nom... Anyway, the last couple of times I've come here I've asked the same questions, do you accept reservations and how long is the wait.  Typical questions requesting honest answers right?  Well, why is it then the host staff are rude when they answer my question or don't answer it at all.  Sometimes I get a no they don't accept reservations or sometimes I get a yes but it's far off from the time that I was intending to request.  As for the answer to how long the wait is, they sometimes say 10-15 minutes which isn't bad if you have a ton of people with you but then they under guesstimate and your wait ends up being 30-45 minutes and they don't tell you that until you get up and complain. Anyway, I usually order the basics here...fish and chips, sliders, salad, soup.  My kids usually order the kids cheeseburgers and the chicken strips.  These are all the staples and not once have they messed up our order...thank goodness. Now the pazzookie (sp?) is another story.  This is one large cookie with tons of ice cream on top.  It's definitely made to be shared because it comes in a pizza pan.  This is the party order of course.  There's a smaller order but remember I usually come here with a big group. The beers aren't too bad either.  I had the raspberry one, which isn't really beer but it was good.  I'm not much of a beer drinking if you couldn't tell by what I ordered to drink. The bar always looks full so if I came here with a couple of friends to check out a game since there are a ton of tv's around, I don't think we'd have a spot to hang out ,even at the bar since it's always crowded, but one of these days I'll try it out."
Wayne L.,"West Sacramento, CA",20,105,14,4.0,2/7/2012,The burgers are excellent.  Great place to go before a Kings game.
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,4.0,7/14/2009,"I was in the area for a kickboxing tournament and was with a party of 6. definitely a great choice for an afternoon lunch on saturday. BS - BJ's are pretty consistent - huge menu, decent portions, but a little bit spendy - Service was attentive and pleasing  - Food is generally tasty - They always have a few good local beers on tap - full bar I enjoy BJ's because it's consistent. It's entirely possible to find places where it's hit or miss and I haven't experienced that whenever I've gone to BJ's. I've been to the following locations: San Jose, Fremont, Tanforan/San bruno and now Sacramento! Basically I came with a few of my boys, 6 of us total. If you're a pizza fan and you haven't tried BJ's Chicago deep dish, you're MISSING OUT! There are those people that like thin crust or no crust and they SUCK but here at BJ's they have awesome Deep Dish. Probably the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. The Mini is pretty small so if you're a big eater, step up to the next size which I believe is like 14 bucks! It's worth it tho. I got a Chicken Ceasar Salad. It was huge and had a little bit too much dressing but not anything to complain about. The chicken was smoky and grilled. It's what I expected. And I was a little bit nervous because I was competing so the salad hit the spot and still gave me some nourishment but didn't make me feel like I overate. Mostly everyone got pizza and they scarfed em down! lol.  Someone got a burger and said it was really good. I've never not gotten pizza at BJ's because I think that's what it's specialty is. Nevertheless I heard nothing but good things about my friends' dishes a cheese burger and a chicken sandwhich.  Also if you have enough room, you've got to get the pizookie. A trip to BJ's is entirely worth it if you get the pizookie. Enjoy this franchise because its so much better then any other I can think of... oh wait, its so much better then Uno's! haha Oh and last but not least, most BJ's are open until 12 or 1am so you have always have a late night brewski and a pizookie!"
Mike E.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/12/2012,"Went to BJ's at North Fwy in Sac this evening.  Food was good.  Service?  Not so much.   We had a coupon for 2 soups and a pizza for $20.  Great deal (cheap, actually).  My wife ordered the tomato soup and I ordered the broccoli cheese.  Her soup came out right away.  I waited for mine for a while then the server came out and said they were out of broccoli cheese.  Asked if I wanted to order something else.  I asked for the tortilla instead.   My wife made it through her soup, my tortilla soup hadn't arrived.  Not until I stopped the server asked proactively was I told that they were out of the tortilla as well and that they were preparing a new batch.  He never said how long it would be.   Then, they served us the pizzas.  As they were doing so, he said the soup would be a bit longer but would be happy to cancel it if it was too late.  I wasn't in the mood anymore so I asked him to cancel it...but did ask if I still had to pay for the soup (not the cost, but the principle).  He said he'd find a way to take it off the bill.   After we're done eating, the manager (bald, glasses, pink shirt) comes by and says there's nothing he could do on the bill.  Ok.  What's worse?  He threatened that if he tried to make up for the soup on the bill that we'd end up paying more! What  kind of a response is that?  Again, not about the cost but the principle/approach! He offered for us to take home a salad, which we said no to because who wants to eat a soggy salad the next day?   We didn't make a big deal about it, smiled and paid our bill.  We boxed up the rest of our pizza.  Consumed with our kids, we started to walk out of the restaurant without our box.  We realized about 45 seconds after we had left the table that we had forgotten the box and went back to the table.  It was gone!   They had already thrown it away.  Disappointed, we called the same manager on the phone while driving home about how quickly they had tossed our box (I mean jeez, maybe a little concern for the family with young kids...consider they may have just forgotten and come back in a few seconds?).  Maybe leave with the host for 2 minutes before tossing?   Instead, his response?  We coach our team to clear tables and reset ASAP so we can seat the next party.  So, we're just part of the herd they're pushing through to keep their numbers up?  Maybe but I've never had anyone be so obvious and unapologetic about it."
Gabe O.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/23/2014,The quality of the food has gone down and the service was ok. Drive 10-15 minutes further and go to the Arden or Elk Grove one.
Jenna C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/20/2011,"Food was good and it usually is always. Some of my regular BJ items are: clam chowder (seriously better than other straight seafood restaurants), balsamic chicken, and of course pizookie!!! Disappointed that they took away the meat lasgana it was so good Idk they did. Got a frozen peachlike alcoholic drink really good too bad happy hour only applies to just the beer."
James M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",32,223,89,3.0,8/30/2013,your average overpriced brew pub. loud lousy service passable food. at least they have a few gluten free options (very few).
Marcus R.,"Phoenix, AZ",786,51,14,4.0,9/13/2010,Good place to hang out and drink brewz and watch football
Jonathan T.,"Sacramento, CA",633,26,6,4.0,7/20/2009,"GO for the late night happy hour!  Usually, I'm not a huge fan of ""big box' restaurants, but if you're going to go to one, you might as well go to one with a good deal. Their late night pizza deal is awesome and if you combine that with a $4 beer, you can do much worse for a late night meal. People love their pizookie, but I'm usually way too stuffed for dessert. Definitely not a romantic place for a date, but a good atmosphere for friends and loud conversation.  I'd even considering driving out to Natomas to watch a big game at BJs."
Anji W.,"San Francisco, CA",785,202,1755,4.0,12/5/2011,This place is like all the other bjs. Great company with great drinks is ALWAYS a good thing. The service is always friendly to me and I tend to run into ppl here!
Michelle F.,"Sacramento, CA",3,23,6,2.0,7/30/2011,"The food is ok, the place is noisy and the service was terrible.   It might be I'm used to smaller family owned places, but it wasn't warm and welcoming.  Unless I get another gift card I won't be going back."
Natasha C.,"Old Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",0,18,,1.0,9/11/2013,"I usually love BJ's and am a loyal customer but this location is terrible. I made a reservation for 15 people weeks in advance for my college graduation celebration and had a horrific experience. We had two servers but neither of them were ever around. They were absent so much that everyone at the table was constantly out of drinks, it took 1 hour to even order food and even longer to get it even after speaking with the manager. We were there for 3 plus hours. I was almost late to my graduation ceremony. This location ruined my celebration and was a just a complete and utter catastrophe of stress that easily could have been avoided by better staffing and more responsive customer service!"
Ken L.,"Sacramento, CA",20,31,4,3.0,5/4/2011,"Beer is great, the food is only average, their service is pretty good in general, a nice place for beer & hang out but not the best place for hunting for the best food."
Veronica M.,"Sacramento, CA",37,10,2,4.0,6/7/2012,I pretty much love everything on the menu. the only reason why I gave it a 4 is because their blue cheese cheeseburger where is too salty but everything else I've tried on the menu is delicious especially the clam chowder and the red velvet with ice cream.
