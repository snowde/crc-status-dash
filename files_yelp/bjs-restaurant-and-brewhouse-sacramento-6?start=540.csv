Ginny K.,"Roseville, CA",0,8,,4.0,8/27/2011,We had a large group of 15 and the service was fast and friendly. Food is always good and the pizookie is Perfect end to a meal. Fun atmopshere.
Heather C.,"Sacramento, CA",398,218,172,3.0,5/31/2009,Went here last night for a free dinner with the parents (thank you dad) and it was alright. Nothing too great but nothing bad. It was very packed but we were seated in about ten min. which isnt too shabby in my book.  our server was fine...like i said nothing amazing but she didnt do anything bad eaither.  The food was good..but nothing special. I got the original pizza which was pretty tasty. I liked their crust which i usually dont...(not a big fan of the pizza crust)but it was fluffy and light. They served my pizza like they do in chicago with a deep dish pan and serve the whole thing table side.  Basically I had a good dinner here and I wouldnt mind going again. But it wasnt anything super special or original to make me give it more then three stars...
Heather S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,2.0,10/11/2012,"I've been to a few different BJ locations and I have had the same general experience at all of them.  Their service is mediocre and on a couple of occasions, somebody at my table didn't get what they ordered.   I am not a fan of BJ's."
Sony M.,"Oceanside, CA",5,81,5,2.0,6/12/2009,"Dude. Pizookie is the only thing this restaurant has going for it! I finally ate from the actual menu today (I usually stop in for dessert only) and I figured I couldn't go wrong with their lunch special mini deep dish pizza. I mean come on, they are known for their chicago inspired menu ...right? WRONG! Maybe I am spoiled by Bay Area's Zachary's Pizza where they do TRUE deep dish. BJ's deep dish? More like dried out pizza hut! There weren't even globs of sauce or cheezy goodness! I decided on mushrooms as my one topping and there were maybe 4 or 5 slices on the whole thing and those tasted like paper because of the dryness. Plus, the crust-pizza proportion was an epic fail. The pizza was only about 6 inches in diameter and half of that was crust. Blegh.  Stick to the pizookie. And not just any pizookie, but the chocolate chip pizookie."
Darren M.,"Sacramento, CA",92,507,35,3.0,11/1/2009,"BJ's is always good ,  why only three stars ?   LONG waits almost any night , ghetto crowd , almost any night ."
S. Rene' P.,"Citrus Heights, CA",43,233,57,1.0,6/6/2011,"Junk!!!  We had nachos it was salty, soggy and nasty."
Mark R.,"San Jose, CA",1,46,14,2.0,7/17/2011,"What is it about the service in this BJ's? My party also had an inattentive waiter. Took too long to bring drinks. After ordering an appetizer he took too long to come back for our dinner order. After that was served he disappeared for another long spell. We were needing drink refills but no waiter. He was polite, but needed a refresher course in Service 101."
Vannika Y.,"Union City, CA",29,51,1,2.0,12/16/2009,"So I went here for the first time about two weeks ago, and I really have to say I expected better.  The service wasn't bad, I can't complain there. However, the food....the food wasn't that great. I ordered the Angel Hair Toscana with Chicken....something like that, it was soo plain, I could have made that myself. There wasn't much sauce or flavor and the chicken was dry. My friend ordered the combination deep dish pizza and omg, it's just like ordering a heart attack. The pizza was unbelievably greasy, fried pizza??? Gross. I couldn't even finish one slice, California Pizza Kitchen wins this one hands down.  However, not everything was terrible. I have yet to taste their Pazookie, it looks good, it sounds good, so I can't say anything just yet. Also, their drinks! I'm not a big fan of alcohol, but their berry Cider was pretty bomb, so was some of the beers. (and I hate beers!!!) So all in all, the drinks were good, but I would have to pass on the food! Nothing special and a bit too greasy."
J S.,"Sacramento, CA",8,80,2,4.0,3/15/2010,"BJ's is one of those good restaurants that I would go to more often if I A.) Had the money to go out to eat and B.) If it were closer to where I live. I ordered some sort of burger, I forget which one it was, and it was great. My friends and I shared a pizookie, which I think is what makes BJ's stand out. If you like ice cream and cookies, you will LOVE the pizookie. The main reason we chose to eat at BJ's is because my friends wanted to watch the football game. The bar is excellent for game viewing, as long as it's not too crowded.  The service was good, not amazing. But what kind of weird to me is that when we asked the waitress, ""Why was this restaurant named BJ's?"" she replied, ""We were told to say that there is no reason."" Hmm, maybe there's a really good story behind the name."

Missy M.,"Sacramento, CA",10,23,,5.0,1/22/2012,"WE loved this place. We keep going back for the BBQ pizza its amazing. They also from time to time offer the 2 for 20$ deal and that is great comes with a pazookie, pizza, and salads for 20$ cant beat that. Anywho I guess this shows my age but this place is packed with young people on Fridays, and Saturdays so on those nights I would prefer a place with a shorter wait but outside of that its a really nice environment, and perfect for a our date-nights."
Ryan H.,"Folsom, CA",0,40,1,5.0,3/3/2014,"Great lunch specials. Food is great, service is great. I love coming here! Highly recommend the black and bleu brew house burger. And the handcrafted cream soda is really good as well."
Loren L.,"Antelope, CA",124,247,96,3.0,4/24/2009,"We tried the Natomas location this time for my son's B-day. The pizza was really good as usual.  I had chardonney shrimp pasta that said to have roma tomatoes and roasted red peppers. The tomatoes were raw and just thrown on the top of the pasta. Clearly the chef didnt even toss the pasta with the shrimp mix and just dumped it on top. I didn't see any roaster red peppers either. It didnt taste like anything really. There was a bunch of plain pasta even after I stirred t around towards the bottom and edges that had no sauce on them.  The Berry Cider was really crisp and fresh, very good.  The waiter was nice and helpful and gave my son a free pazzooky for his b-day which was to die for.  I think we should just stick to pizza and beer."
Andrew M.,"Sacramento, CA",46,3,,5.0,12/31/2010,"I love BJ's! I just asked my dudes and every one of them love BJ's too! It's not just guys either. Whenever my girl says, ""BJ's"" I'm like heck yes! If I could it would be BJ's every day afternoon and evening. Awesome."
Jason W.,"Sacramento, CA",6,17,,4.0,3/12/2012,"Very cool place to get a drink with friends, or to bring the family and have a delicious meal. Food is excellent and a very wide selection of beers to choose from. Plenty of TVs to watch the game. The wait for tables can get kinda long at times, but it's a busy place for a reason. My wife and I eat here a couple times a month, and love it!"
David L.,"Fairfield, CA",880,94,135,4.0,1/14/2009,"Love their lettuce wraps, pizookie (sp?), and their personal pizzas. Service is always decent and friendly. Bartenders are pretty cool on football Sundays and they always try to accommodate people who are trying to watch certain teams play. OOH and try their root beer! They brew it themselves."
Nicky L.,"Sacramento, CA",21,72,,4.0,10/15/2008,"The food here is good. They have a lot of choices and are pretty accommodating to your tastes and needs. The portions are large. The brew is pretty good.  I have tried various things on the menu and have not been disappointed in any aspect (size, taste, freshness). My big complaint is the service, so slow.  I always go over my lunch hour when I choose to eat here.  I actually wrote a letter to their corporate office about the service; a manager did call me from this place and we had a good talk about what could be done to improve the service.  I really like that they were so attentive to my complaint."
B H.,"Sacramento, CA",49,225,37,3.0,8/13/2011,"Beer is good here. It's a huge menu so I think you are better off keeping it simple. We have better luck doing pizzas and beer than other stuff, it's been hit and miss when we stray away. Hit pizza and beer though and you can't go wrong."
Dustin R.,"Sacramento, CA",252,107,113,4.0,7/23/2011,Food is great.  We love the wedge salad and deep dish pizza.  I am a huge fan of their cold rooter on tap as well.  Highly recommend this place for groups as there is something for everyone.  Great service and selection are constants from this brewhouse.  I don't drink but I hear their beer is pretty good too.
P S.,"Sacramento, CA",10,314,30,2.0,7/22/2011,"Husband had house salad with thousand island dressing he said was excellent. I had house salad with ranch that was good. All our main courses were not hot. I had the BJ's combo pizza that was very good. Husband had fish and chips. The fish was good, but the fries were so cold he sent them back. They now have stopped putting the price of the cocktails on the menu, so if you would like to know the price of the cocktail before you order it, your server has to go to the bar and get a price quote. WTF? Hubby had the Top Shelf Margarita made with mix and not good. My Very Berry Margarita was very sweet and both tasted like a minimal amount of tequila was used. I am taking away a star because of cold food and the menu not having prices for their cocktails and making wait staff have to go to the bar to get prices."
