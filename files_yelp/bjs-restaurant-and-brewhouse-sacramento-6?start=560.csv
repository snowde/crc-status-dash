Chris B.,"Yuba City, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/29/2014,"Horrible. Came in with a party of 15 which included 6 bodybuilders who just got done competing and were about to pass out. Told them that and they told me 45-60 minutes. Cool no problem. Waited 2 hours while the table they were waiting to clear for us just sat there and chatted away. The management needs to be more considerate of people waiting in the lobby to be seated. When you're busy on a Friday or Saturday might, allowing people to eat and then sit at the table for 2 hours is unacceptable"
B B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,32,12,4.0,11/20/2008,"The wait for a table was long. The wait for the pizzas was even longer, but they're pretty much the same amount as the wait at the Spaghetti Factory or California Pizza Kitchen.  The pizzas? Fantaastiiiiccc *sing song* The BBQ chicken pizza was an explosion of goodness on my taste buds. The pizzas were worth the wait. The triple chocolate pizookie was insanely insanely rich. Chocolate cookie with chocolate fudge and chocolate ice cream. I think I died a little after eating it and went to chocolate heaven. Then they heard it was my birthday, and even though they didn't sing, they brought out another pizookie for me. This was had vanilla ice cream. I *really* died after eating this one. 4 slices of pizza + chocolate pizookie + another pizookie = too much food = tummyache.  But the food was oh-so-awesome.  The women's bathroom also had black and white pictures of a half naked man with six packs. What is up with that? But I guess I can't complain. He was nice looking ... and buff."
April T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,16,,4.0,12/9/2008,After a busy day in the office I like to stop in at BJs and have their appetizer pizza and a beer. As long as I didn't skip lunch I can get by with eating only half and saving the other for lunch. If I hit Happy Hour the pizza is half price and that is one great deal. I also love their balsamic chicken and Parmesan crusted chicken. If going for lunch you have to get there before noon or wait 45 minutes. At dinner my friends and I grab a table at the bar. The service is always fast and friendly. A friend wanted to buy me dinner for my B-day but she had a flight to catch so we went here.  Quick friendly service and when the waiter asked what flavor I wanted for dessert I assumed that was a scoop of ice cream - nope it was a pizookie and on the house.  GREAT!!!
Bryan L.,"Roseville, CA",5,281,,4.0,1/17/2013,"My uncle said he had reservations at BJ's, but I didn't know it was this one until we got there. When I was here last year, the service was awful and the food was mediocre, but tonight was a different story. When we got there, the hostess said it would be a 5 minute wait for our table but after 10 minutes we decided to just sit in the bar. There was one table left and we ordered drinks while waiting for the pager to buzz. After another few minutes we just ordered our food and asked our waitress to just tell the hostess we found a table in the bar (it had been nearly half an hour since we first walked in). This time, the service was fast and the waitress was nice (unlike the people I encountered last time) and most of all the food was a lot better. The only downside was that our table was in-between two other tables so it was like sitting with a group of strangers who would rather you sit somewhere else."
Tracy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",160,91,16,2.0,7/22/2008,"1. Call ahead and they said there was no wait time, yet we waited. 2. Didn't know that the new trend was for guests to find their own seats and not get menus. 3. Mimi's French Quarter kills Bj's California burger. Also our waitress didn't give us ketchup, moron. 4. The mini pizza (half off at happy hour) tasted exactly like any other frozen pizza.  5. I couldn't imagine any one wanting to pay $10 for their mini pizza. Food is over priced for what they give you. My broccoli was chopped up to resemble baby food. Walked out of the place and my prince charming said, 'Wow. No wonder this place got such a low rating.'"
Nicole J.,"West Sacramento, CA",11,52,,4.0,12/23/2008,"I recommend the late happy hour (10pm - closing) Sunday through Thursday with drink specials, $2.00 off appetizers, and 1/2 off mini pizzas.   3 of the 4 of us had 2 rounds of drinks (one was DD), and enough food to make all of us full (and happy) for under 80 bucks!  We had no problem finding seats in the bar and Jose totally took care of us!  PS-- Jose makes his own custom blend cocktail sauce by request!"
Brad C.,"Elk Grove, CA",67,62,2,4.0,1/8/2011,"I live closer to the BJ's in Elk Grove so I've only visited this location in Natomas twice.  It gets pretty busy but for good reason.  They have good food, great beers, and friendly service.  Recently, I went there for lunch and ordered the unlimited soup and salad for about $7.  I tried three different soups (clam chowder, broccoli cheddar, creamy tomato bisque) which were all fantastic.  The options for salad are wedge, Caesar, and house.  While there was some confusion in the kitchen causing one of our dishes to come out late, the manager did come to the table twice to bring the food and apologize.  It was something out of the hands of our server who did a great job.  I'm certain that I'll go back soon."
Crystal L.,"Saint Paul, MN",173,74,,3.0,9/20/2010,"This place is ok.  The food is alright, the place is very loud, and the service is usually slow.  They get the third star for the pizookies (which are amazing) and the waitress the last time we came.  We let her know that we were on our lunch our and needed to get out of there soon, she got us back to work with 10 min left to spare, on top of that my soda cup was never empty....she was amazing."
Stefanie C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,46,6,4.0,6/22/2009,"I've been here several times and have no major complaints. Yes, the food is not great, but is good enough to satisfy, and the wait staff has always been good to us.   We had a horrible experience with another restaurant in the area on Father's Day, so we decided to come here for dinner, instead.  We were seated right away, our waitress was attentive (I forgot her name!), and the staff was ultra friendly to my daughter (who is 1 year old), which earned them a few extra points from me.  They did run out of a couple of their menu items, which was a bummer, but being that it was a busy Father's Day, I'm willing to forgive them for it.  Oh, and the white chocolate macadamia Pizookie is yummy! mmm."
Travis M.,"Sacramento, CA",3,57,2,4.0,7/26/2011,I don't know what I rated this place before but this time it deserves a 4. Service was great and the added a red velvet pazookie to the menu. A must!!!
Polar B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,32,,3.0,11/12/2011,"We had lunch today, which is a good value but since the restaurant was so busy it took 45 mins for the food to come out. It was pretty good, we had pizza and a giant potato but were pretty famished by the time it came out. It was a pretty good experience but the food could have come earlier."
Amber S.,"Sacramento, CA",41,19,,4.0,2/17/2011,"I've been to the Bj's in Natomas a couple times. I really like the service there; the waiters were very friendly. I had this strawberry dessert, oh my god it was to die for! Bj's beer is delicious as well!"
Blake C.,"CA, CA",252,282,64,4.0,4/25/2011,"This BJ's is close to work so some times we will go here after a meeting for lunch. They are always packed around 12-1pm so be educated of this if you have a large group. Food is good but service was slow, to be expected for lunch during the work week. All in all not to bad."
Randy L.,"Sacramento, CA",8,9,,5.0,8/24/2009,"I've been to the BJ's on N. Freeway several times now. I have never been disappointed. It does get busy on Friday's and Saturday nights, however, I've never waited more than 10 mins.  I recommend the shrimp chardonnay. It is ALWAYS good and they really give you healthy portions (it's prolly enough for 2 ppl). Very good selection of beer as well."
Justin H.,"Grass Valley, CA",1,1,1,5.0,3/1/2012,"I have to say... they could have served me on a dirty table with a filthy napkin for all I care. Their tomato bisque in a bread bowl is just that good. Not to mention the beer,"
Patti R.,"Sacramento, CA",105,549,113,4.0,3/14/2011,"Had a terrific dinner here tonite! Was told we would have 'at least a 25 minute wait'...yet 10 minutes later, we were seated!!  Our table had the Chili Cheeseburger with thin fries, New Orleans Jambalaya and their version of a French Dip...oh yeah....and a Sampler of course! They were out of the Tatonka Stout and substituted their 'Oasis' seasonal beer. Oh Delish!!  The whole dinner was great, food server super attentive and we left feelin pretty darn good. Definitely we are coming back to this location!"
Kelly L.,"Yuba City, CA",55,146,4,2.0,10/21/2012,"A group of six of us, plus two extremely adorable infant twins, went in for a late lunch yesterday, and we were all really hungry. The place wasn't very busy - the big back room was virtually empty, and we sat at a table near the door. Our waitress came and took our drink order, which included a cup of hot water to heat the girls babas because they were famished. A few minutes later, out comes half of our drink order, no hot water. Several minutes later, she brings us all glasses of ice water, which we didn't ask for, and no hot water. So we politely reminded her that we would like some hot water, as she was taking our food orders. So, out comes the rest of the drinks and our chips and salsa - and no hot water. We all kind of looked at each other like ""wtf?"". We all watched as she hurried around to her other tables, clearing off their dishes. Finally I had enough and flagged her down, again requesting some hot water. As we were waiting on that, three different people came out and brought our food. They asked if we needed anything else, and we requested three ranches. She finally showed up with the hot water, and by that time, my glass of lemonade had been dry for far too long, as well as our beer and ciders. We had random people dropping off ranches, and then when she finally came back with refills, even she brought three ranches. It was ridiculous! Total lack of communication. Our server either shouldn't work there, or should be re-trained on how to prioritize."
Nichole V.,"Sacramento, CA",365,247,115,3.0,2/19/2011,Food was good and large portion size. Took forever to be seated and the waiter was difficult to find. The restaurant itself is a comfortable environment and they have any alcoholic drink u can think of. I ordered the veggie burger which was fantastic! We had spinach artichoke dip for and appetizer that was delicious too!
Kristin C.,"Carmichael, CA",1,16,,1.0,11/15/2013,"So, this was my 2nd attempt (My friend said, I should give them another chance)...  NEVER EVER Again. First, there aren't enough servers to handle the # of tables/customers.  Which means that yes, once again - It took over 30min to get a drink - let alone refill on my water. . . and then our order was not correct when 2 of the 3 of us got the food.  OOOps did they forget the 3rd customer at our table?? yeah - no idea how.  The incorrect food, was lil things like no onions.. so since I'm not allergic- not that big of a deal. BUT the food being room temperature and tasteless, well that is a big deal.  We had been there 2 hrs (from time being seated at the table to the time 2 of us got our ""order"".).  My friend (patron #3) was so annoyed that when the server stated they would get her food asap and she asked will that be under 30min? and the server replied ""probably not"" - she said, never mind- I'll go to wing stop.  THEN they actually had her meal on our bill. WTF?!!!     Anyhow, we didn't eat the crappy meal - ended up at Wingstop.. you know where there's good service & decent food?!    This place is a joke.  No idea why its so ""trendy"" - everyone I talk to says, the food is not good and the svc is generally lacking. So why the hell do you go there?!   Well, I will not - EVER try them again."
Larry L.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,4,3.0,9/11/2009,"With so many of them in the Sarcamento area, it is hard to choose which one to go to. Granted it helps to have as many locations as they do, especially when you have friends spread out all over to. I personally have been going to the Natomas location for some time now. Menu selection and pricing is very good. Slowly working my way through all the menu items.  Have to say that the pizzas can fill you up fast with the many different pizza combinations they offer. Generally I go back and forth between the pizza and entree menu. Have to say my favorite pizza is the BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger. Sounds a little funny, but it is really good in taste and the ability to fill you up fast for such a personal pizza. If you choose to order off of the Entree' menu, you have to try the Jambalaya. I like to eat spicy foods and I would have to say the pasta is great and so are all of the fillings."
