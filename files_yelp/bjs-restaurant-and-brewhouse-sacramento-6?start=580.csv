Nicole w.,"Roseville, CA",23,100,,2.0,9/27/2010,"This was my 3rd time going to BJ's, I have always not been that crazy about the restaurant in the past, but I thought I'd give it one last try. I ordered their deep dish pepperoni pizza, and the person I was with got the deep dish mediterranean. My pizza didn't have any sauce on it, which I thought was really weird, and I didn't feel this was a genuine 'deep dish' pizza, just extra thick. The person I was with really liked his pizza, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Personally if I am getting deep dish pizza in Sacramento, I'm going to go to Chicago Fire, because it is hands down the best in town."
James P.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",4,18,,1.0,7/1/2013,"I went to BJ's this evening with my wife and 8 year old Son. To start,  the person that was seating us was complaining about another customer to the Hostess loud enough for us to hear her. After that, the same lady that was complaining was supposed to be seating us, but was so busy talking to her co-worker that she forgot to ask us to follow her, leaving us at the desk. She finally realized her mistake after about 15 steps. When we got to our table there was a small pile of sugar or salt.  Instead of cleaning the table she placed our silver wear over it.  When our waitress comes to help us, she was nice enough, but slow. It seemed like everything took forever. Off of the kids menu we ordered a grilled cheese and fries, I had the BBQ chicken, and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich. Again seemed like it took an abnormally long time to get our food. The chicken and pulled pork sandwich were both very good. When my son tried his sandwich he said that he did not like it. He said that it tasted very spicy. I looked at it and it looked like there was green flakes on it. I took a bite and it tasted like they used garlic on it. My wife and I looked at the kids menu and there was no mention of garlic. When the waitress came by we told her and she said she would talk to the manager. She came back and said that she talked to the kitchen staff and they would redo it, but cook it with out garlic. When it came back it was the same. They took it back and did not charge us, but the damage was done. But again it took forever for everything. Order, food, check."
Dave H.,"San Antonio, TX",213,485,220,3.0,1/27/2011,"I really like the sampler platter of beers.  Just skip the Hefeweizen as it tastes like watered down Pyramid.  The caesar salad was nice.  The flatbread pizza had a nice crispy crust, but where was the basil and italian sausage?  It looked like they use 1 piece of cut up basil for the whole pizza and some sausage scraps.  Where's the Beef (or pork in this case)?"
TS M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,2.0,12/29/2013,"We have been to Natomas BJs many times & the service was decent. The last few times it's been a slow service & the servers bring in the wrong orders. So have to wait longer, getting to a 2 hour long visit instead of the 1 hour restaurant visit.. Moreover,  today the manager was covering up for their mistake (false advertisement). We had ordered holiday gift cards for $50 (which comes with a free holiday glass as advertised in their holiday menu & on poster in their restaurant). After getting the gift cards, when asked for the glass, the manager says that the min. order is $75 & it expires on Dec 25. Where as it clearly said on the ads , the   card purchase should be $50 & there was no expiration date for the offer & neither did it say while supplies last. The manager should have been honest."
Pinot Squirrel S.,"Sebastopol, CA",4,71,3,2.0,2/14/2011,Don't bother. Our second attempt at getting good service. There are so many better brew pubs out there!  Food was cold on both visits.
Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,3.0,3/26/2008,"Yup, BJ's is a chain but they are always willing to make me veggie friendly dishes which the menu is lacking.  My husband loves going to BJ's so I end up there a lot but thankfully I love and I mean I LOVE the Southwest Salad from there, minus the chicken.  It is delicious, I could eat it every day.  Thankfully, this BJ's delivered it to me quickly and made to order....chicken on the side for Paul and an extra plate.  The salad is huge, plan to split it with someone.   The bruschetta is pretty good from too although I am pretty sure it is not all that authentic.  But, it still tastes good, I love the balsamic vinegar that they drizzle on the bread.   It was huge inside and so crowded, I was shocked.  It was on a Thursday in the middle of the afternoon.  It was the biggest restaurant I have ever seen.  Waitstaff was incredibly nice, although we had to ask for them to fill up Paul's soda and that is a big pet peeve of his.  But, overall three stars.  Although the salad is delicious it is overpriced and it is nothing fabulous by any means.   But, it was super easy to get in and out of there quickly.  Easy access to the freeway too!"
Steve N.,"Brentwood, CA",199,453,403,3.0,7/6/2008,"Ya, BJ's is ok.  It looks very contemporary, like a reuse building that use to be a place where they manufactured steel or a warehouse.  However, it was built new.  Nice attempt and I liked the atmosphere.  Placed felt like it had some energy. The food was suppose to be good.  We heard the pizza was very good, clam chowder was good, and they had giant potatoes.  SoI try a personal pizza and it is very good.  My wife, Jenn, gets a basic baked potato.  It was fine to me.  Maybe you can't really get an ""amazing potato"" these days.  It seems like I've had really good ones that were smaller at home.  The kids got kids foods, i.e. chicken this or that.  Nothing special to report here. Prices were ok. not great.  Parking was not bad.  I'd like to go back sometime with some friends and soak it in again."
Mark S.,"Olivehurst, CA",10,88,44,2.0,5/31/2013,"Never again!!!  I have given this place three chances before i wrote this review. I have never walked out of BJ's satisfied.  Iv'e had butterflied 'ale' fried shrimp last year that were overcooked and bland, probably frozen. My next visit was strictly pizza. I had thick crust/deep dish and it was not bad, but if you have the time, there are soooo many good pizza places other than this. The last visit was the worst. I went on a Friday @ 11:30am, with a party of 7. We were greeted right away and was able to order right away. The waiter was great, but he had mentioned that he has tables on both ends of the restaurant, not just in this section. Seriously? What's up with the management? The food took forever to come out and not one person in our party was very impressed. My blue cheese burger was overcooked and dry. I had to order a side of mayo to moisten the burger up a little. It was obvious that my patty broke apart on the grill, yet the cook thought it was ok to put it back together and serve it, so i had a chunk fall out right away. The flatbread pizza was not very good, the 'gluten free"" thin crust pizza was basic, the cheese quesadilla was skimpy etc. This is a case of a big chain restaurant that puts no love into it's food and cannot keep up with a busy dining room."
Lana h.,"Sacramento, CA",19,27,1,3.0,10/22/2012,"I have had BJ's pizza many times with each time being worst than the last. First time I had it I thought it was amazing and worth every penny. The crust was fluffy, and crispy. Loaded with cheese and all sorts of toppings. I feasted that night. Second time, the dough was old and pretty much ruined the pizza. The third time, over this past weekend it was not fully cooked. The dough was still white and raw inside, the cheese had not melted, and the pepperoni was layed out in stacks. It was 3 or four slices on pepperoni on top of each other in one spot with the rest of the slice empty. Some slices even had no pepperoni. This pizza cost over $20 by the way. Little Caesar's would have done a better job for $5. Just a huge disappointment. I'm giving them one last shot. Right now it's at a 33% success rate, if it dips to 25% I will have to reevaluate my entire life. I may have to take time off work to get it figured out. BJ's is a huge part of my life and I hope I won't have to replace it."
Jeffrey L.,"San Jose, CA",8,15,,3.0,9/18/2008,"BJ's is always solid, the environment is laid back and the servers are always really courteous and accomodating. Downside of this particular BJ's is that it is always packed. ALWAYS PACKED. I went this past Monday at 8 pm, for a 30 minute wait. I came a month ago for lunch, 20 minute wait. Last semester, everytime I went was at least a 20 minute wait.  Depending on the night too, the crowd can be docile or rambunctuous as all hell. During the Cowboys/Eagles game this past Monday, they must have split the restaurant between the Dallas and Philly fans, because everytime something happened the whole place was in uproar. It was fun for me and my buddy because we were watching the game and having a beer. But for those poor 3 families that decided to celebrate their kids' birthday that night, it must have been terrible. In any case, this restaurant has solid food but is a hit or miss depending what are you going there for, a family restaurant or a sports bar. Choose carefully."
Julie Q.,"Sacramento, CA",6,4,,1.0,12/30/2007,"Went with my sister on a a Sunday night at 8:30 (before Kings game ended) and waited for over 20 min after being told it would be 5.  (note:  there were several empty tables so they must've been short a server or something...)  We were seated at an up front table that was blasted with cold air every time someone opened the door.   Ordered drinks, appetizer, salads and pastas.  Unfortunately, we waited with an empty table (no place settings and no drinks) until they brought the main entrees.  Totally forgot our drinks, appetizers and salads.  Manager noticed and came by to tell us she would comp our food.  Regardless, marginal food and crappy service.   On another note, I guess we weren't treated any different than other guests - in fact, while we waited for  for our food to arrive we noticed a few of the Kings players and their friends arrive and wait for a table.  Again, there were plenty of empty tables but they kept these guys waiting over 25 minutes with empty tables nearby.  I thought Francisco Garcia was going to go crazy waiting for a place to sit down. For such a large restaurant it's amazing that the wait is so long, the bar is so crowded and there are so many BJ's staff standing around the front desk chatting.  I am done with the place.  Too many other options available."
Maria P.,"Antelope, CA",2,24,,4.0,6/11/2013,"I've been coming to this BJ's since they opened, and I have never had a bad experience. I try something new on the menu almost every time I go, and I have liked everything. Staff is always really nice and helpful. I will continue to give these guys my business."
Lan L.,"Hayward, CA",57,30,44,3.0,6/1/2007,"Don't expect a review on the alco-mo-hols cuz I don't drink.  I went with my sis, her hubby and their kid and we got a seat right away in one of the booths near the bar. It's first come first serve and we would have had to wait about 20 minutes for a regular table. Don't bother cuz you'd get the same service near the bar.  I took a look at the menu and realized this place was just like the Cheesecake Factory without the cheesecake. They just replaced it with beer. Note: beware of places that offer a wide range of culinary choices...they never do it right. I did get the BJ's burger and it was mmm-mm-tasty. I cut it in half cuz it was so huge I couldn't possibly eat it, and the juice was running down meat. The potato wedges that came with it were really good too, I ate quite a few before I got to my burger. Outside was nice and crunchy and the inside was nice and fluffy soft. Maybe it came from a package, but I don't care. Burger and fries was worth it for about $8.  I'd give this place 5 stars if it were based on just the food but we also ordered the Pizookie, which you really can just make at home with Nestle Tollhouse mix and grocery store ice cream. And I don't mean Haagen Daazs, I mean Safeway ice cream. Seriously, those are the only two things that comprised the Pizookie. My sister ordered the shrimp linguine which was only okay...I can and have made better.  Four stars for the burger, but just three for the whole shibang."
Allison M.,"Sacramento, CA",32,83,,3.0,3/28/2008,"I've eaten here quite a few times since it's within my sphere, and pizza is always delightful. Their pizza is pretty good and filling, and my husband loves the Jeremiah Red beer, which is supposedly brewed by Sierra Nevada. He should know since he won a certificate naming him an honorary brew master. I, on the other hand, know nothing of beer ways. As for the food, I've only had the pizza and the calzone, which was fair to middlin'. But I've heard that the salads are okay.  There is always a long wait, too, but you can sit at the bar if space allows. A few months ago we had to wait over an hour, and two women got in a car wreck out front and one wanted to fight; it was quite entertaining.  Back inside BJ's, the service is often sloppy, thus the three stars. The staff is not terribly attentive, and last time we went we had to wait forever for our pizza because they dropped it on the floor and had to bake a replacement. Despite the service, the pizza is worthy, and they serve it on a space-age pizza stand!"
Rachelle B.,"San Diego, CA",293,543,125,5.0,7/20/2010,"Hot as hell, and in the mood for a drink, my boyfriend drove aimlessly around downtown looking for somewhere to eat... and park. It was so frustrating, so we decided to head to Natomas for dinner instead. Since I'm not from Sacramento, and my boyfriend had already taken me to his favorite places, we just couldn't decide where to go. And the last thing we wanted to do was pay for parking... again. I had to be at Sacromento airport in a few hours anyway, so this was a good choice. We were going to try Carino's, but I saw BJ's across the way, and we both decided that that sounds much better than some random Italian joint that we have never been to before. I can never pass up going to BJ's, it's just too awesome, even if it is a chain. Their food is consistently good, no matter which location you go to. We sat at the bar, which was nearly empty. Pretty crazy for 4 PM on a sunday afternoon. Every BJ's I've gone to is always packed, no matter what time of day it is, so this was very nice. I had the Nit Wit, a Belgian wheat beer and BF had a captain and diet. Of course, we had to get the chips and salsa (I always loved them here, they're made of red, white and blue corn). I decided to have the fish tacos, which I surprisingly have not tried yet. The tacos, along with about 15 other items were listed toward the back of the menu as ""under 670 calories"" nice for me, since I try to watch what I eat nowadays. BF ordered the turkey cobb sandwich. Tacos were large, and it came with 2, with a side of chips, an avocado creme, and salsa. Loved the tacos, especially with the avocado creme, but I used it sparingly. It was too good to be ""low-fat"". I was almost full after just one taco, so I just decided to eat just the fish and cabbage from the other taco. Not a huge fan of flour tortillas. I think they'd be much better on corn tortillas. They were still really tasty. Fish is nicely cooked and light, not dry or greasy. BF said his sandwich was also very good. The bartender was very nice. She happily suggested a few drinks to us and we took her word on it, she was awesome. BF was very happy to see that she put in a little extra of something in his mai-tai. Brownie points for her. She also made sure our water glasses were full, and asked us periodically, but not annoyingly, if we needed anything else. Loved it. Nice way to end an awesome weekend in Sacramento."
Albert W.,"Orange, CA",701,1823,60,3.0,7/4/2008,Solid pizza joint that everyone can find something on the menu they'll like.   Nothing is a WOW
Theary E.,"Fullerton, CA",75,23,2,4.0,7/30/2010,"Meh their food here is okay... I've been here a few times but never really enjoyed it to order the same dish twice. My friends keep bringing me here because they like it and I'm not one to fuss in public about where to eat!  I decided to give their BBQ pulled pork a try... oh yum! it was juicy, with crunchy fried onions. Their slaw was not slaw, it was like big ol' chopped up pieces of cabbage... bleh. Wedge fries are good. Not a fan of those thin fries.. they get cold if you don't attack them first.  I am however a sucker for sweets! I love the pizookie! I'd just go for dessert cause it's so yum! Our server was nice and friendly. Never had bad service or anything.  I think I'd come back for their pulled pork and maybe their cajun pasta.  I do like this location better than other BJs"
Eileen L.,"San Francisco, CA",344,1307,15,3.0,11/30/2009,I finally got a chance to go dine in at a BJ's . My friend and I had the Southwestern deep dish pizza which tasted okay . We also had a pasta which was okay except it was lacking some flavor . Their homemade rootbeer tasted alright but I was kind of disappointed because I was expecting something better . The staff is very nice and friendly .
Samantha S.,"Beaverton, OR",19,33,2,3.0,8/25/2012,"We had a pretty good dinner here on Thursday.  We'd tried to go once before during the week but the line was out the door???  I guess it can get pretty busy here.  Even on a Thursday around 7, it was PACKED!  We didn't have to wait for a table, which was nice, but it took awhile to get our food or to flag down a waiter for drink refills, because every single table in there was full and the waiters were all super busy.  But besides that the service was friendly and the food was decent.  They have some ""small plate appetizers"" that are really inexpensive and bigger than what I expected (the stuffed mushrooms were especially tasty!) and our entrees were not anything amazing but not bad either.  It seems like a fun place to come for dinner and drinks, and we'll probably go again."
kate r.,"San Francisco, CA",117,426,11,3.0,2/2/2007,"2.5 rounded to 3, because I frequent a lot of these when I'm with others. I got to agree with everyone about the standards of this place. Yeah, its a chain restaurant, and at one point I called it my favorite ""default chain."" The wait sucks if you are attempting to eat here on a Fri/Sat night, their biggest customers are loyal chain-goers who know of nothing better. I would like to scream out loud that all of their pastas suck, pasta is such a delicate word. They should just call it ""bad sauce and noodles."" Their portions should give you three meals, and if you can eat one plate in a single seating... I'd go get your cholesterol checked. I'm a NY-style pizza girl myself, so I will spare you from my Chicago-deep-dish negativity. I will say that the ""Spinach Artichoke"" is a flavor overload, I thought I could never get enough garlic, I thought wrong... I ended up scraping off the entire topping and just eating the crust. SO WHY THREE STARS? 1. Believe it or not... YOU SHOULD ORDER A SALAD AS A MEAL, cause they are damn good. Yeah, yeah, a salad is just glorified rabbit food. No seriously though, the Santa Fe is both tasty and filling, as well as many of the other salads. 2. Their menu satisfies a wide range of palettes, take a big group and they'll probably find something to be happy with. 3. Can't vouch for the beer, but the ROOT BEER is the best ever. 4. You can get a decent deal at happy hour. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH MORE THAN A 30 MINUTE WAIT, unless you just need to see for yourself."
