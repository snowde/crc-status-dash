Veronica G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,7,5.0,8/5/2017,We came here for our moms birthday dinner on a busy Saturday evening. We got lucky and got an awesome waitress Melissa A. who made our evening even more enjoyable. She was very friendly and efficient - great customer service. On top of her great customer service food was very good also. We will be back soon and request to be at 1 of her tables. Thanks again Melissa you are awesome !!!
Mary A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/13/2017,"I eat at BJs frequently. Probably once a month or every couple of months. It has a large menu, usually not a long wait at this location, and it has better food than some competitors. This location in particular has always given me problems. Either the service is slow, they don't offer refills, etc. Not anything that I feel warrants a review. I am not a person who complains often. But what happened today is something that I feel people need to know. Today while we were eating lunch, my son was given his chicken tenders kids meal. This is something that he has eaten numerous times, and we have never had an issue. The worst that has happened is they have been lukewarm, presumably because they sit under a heat lamp while the other food is cooking. Again, not anything serious. I just had a baby, and I was distracted with tending to my baby. My husband cut up my son's chicken and he was not looking. My son took a bite of chicken and put it back down, and that's when I saw it. It was RAW. I mean, COMPLETELY raw. I freaked out and took all of the chicken off of his plate. I immediately got the waitress and she told the manager. The manager deflected responsibility, stating that the chicken comes precooked and it was an error with the supplier. And while that may or may not be true, I still do not understand how a chef can serve raw chicken, and to a child no less. Salmonella is no joke and it can be deadly for a toddler like my son. So you have to wonder, if the supplier gave them one raw piece of chicken, how many more are there? Why two stars and not one? The manager did try to remedy the situation. But I also felt like he didn't care that much. This is RAW poultry we are talking about. The kids meal was removed from my tab. But I feel like this is a mistake that is unforgivable. My son could get very sick, and now I need to play the waiting game. I wish that I had taken a picture, I am really angry at myself for not taking one. And yes, my husband should have paid more attention to my son's chicken. So should I. But when you eat at a restaurant, there are certain minimum expectations. Your food being cooked safely is one of them. Regardless of whether or not it was the supplier's fault, raw chicken should never have even come in contact with my son's plate. This is why I cannot in good faith ever return to BJs, and i cannot recommend it to anyone else. I wish that I didn't have to write this, but I feel that it is important for people to know."
Vlad P.,"West Sacramento, CA",3,35,4,1.0,11/21/2016,"It's our 1st anniversary Being married with my wife! So I thought I would give BJ's another shot! Oh man was I wrong! We walked in and waited 15 minutes when they had 10+tables open!  We later were seated at small booth when we requested a bigger booth!  We waited 25 minutes for someone to take our order for drinks, then waited 10 minutes to get the drinks! After the waiter brought the drinks she did not take our order just walked away and came back 10 minutes! She said are you guys finally ready to order! That was so rude when we waited all this time! As we ordered I told them to bring out the food all at the same time and they just did what they wanted and brought it in 3 different times! The calimari was nasty its like they haven't changed there oil in over a year! The lemons on the side still had there tags! I ordered pita nachos and they brought out a flat bread pizza with a few macho ingredients!  The tortilla soup was over salted had no chips in it or avocado as shown in the picture! Never coming back the food and service is going down the drain! It looks like a mess I don't know why waiters are expecting tips these days!  Uhhhhh I can't do 0 stars!"
Manuel R.,"Mesa, AZ",222,17,,1.0,1/26/2017,"Someone brought to my table, didn't tell me my waiter was coming or if I wanted water. Im by myself. I was waiting over 20 minutes and still no one came. I saw the same person go and talk to another table and that table got drinks. I know I could speak up but cmon now. All I wanted was a pazookie. Lol Not pleased by the service today."
Lynne M.,"Sacramento, CA",23,97,32,5.0,7/5/2017,Saw that Wednesday was their $10 loaded burger special with unlimited fries.  $4 beers.  Bj's seasonal nitwit a blonde was amazing   My other favorite was the Jeremiah red.   We were greeted by the manager who seated us.  He let us know the specials.  Our server came right over with our beer.   Love that they have gluten free buns for their burgers.   Dinner for 2 under $30.  Great inexpensive date night
Sunny S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,,1.0,5/29/2017,Terrible customer service. It has not improved one bit over the years. I make sure to avoid this place as much as possible
Tsenu V.,"Sacramento, CA",89,7,5,3.0,2/15/2017,It's a great place to hangout with family and friends or maybe someone more.  Food is ok. The beer on the other hand is great. Just order the BJ's Goliath IPA with 9.0% ABV.  Taste great for IPA drinker and a bit on the stronger side.
Yoli S.,"Sacramento, CA",96,17,,1.0,7/21/2017,"I chooses this restaurant to ask my girlfriends if they would be my bridesmaids and had the worst customer service. She even had the nerve to tell our party that she only had two hands, yes we know that but we had empty glasses the entire time and we didn't received our entire order. One of my bridesmaid didn't get to eat at all. So upsetting and will never go back to this bj's the server name is Mollie."
Yappy Yuppy Yelper Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,74,245,5.0,10/15/2016,Ahhmazing as always. My experience was unique at this visit. This time I'm in a wheelchair. My anxiety was for naught. BJ's is wheelchair accessible! Plenty of room without being in the way or hindering other patrons enjoyment. The food is scrumptious. I had a ridiculous large nachos and talk about great. Had enough to share with my friends. Ordered Avocado Rolls for my baby daughter and the look of sheer exquisite pleasure said it all. Mmm mmm good!
Christopher S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Food always lukewarm tried to give them another chance but food once again lukewarm. Not just mine but my girlfriends and people next to us. Will definitely not be back, sad because they used to be ok."
Dawn T.,"Mather, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/16/2017,"We went here for lunch on September 20th. The occasion? We were ""celebrating"" my sister's birthday. Her first birthday since her passing. It was very emotional for all of us but we chose BJ's because we had been here many times when my sister was alive. We knew the food and service would be great...what we didn't expect was the amazing compassion shown to us by all!! The server brought a desert with a candle for my sister. The manager (I'm so sorry I can't remember his name) came to our table and gave us hugs! He also thanked us for choosing his restaurant to celebrate this day...he indicated he was honored. Leaving the restaurant, the girls at the front desk wished us well and thanked us. We were honored. Truly amazing!"
Lydia H.,"Dixon, CA",135,316,352,5.0,4/3/2016,We enjoy date nights here every once in a while because the beer selection is great and the food is good. The service is excellent and they have a very convenient ap you can use for reservations. We have not ordered one thing here that we haven't liked! Don't forget to try the pizzookie!!!
Amy J.,"Sacramento, CA",523,204,1015,4.0,2/24/2016,"It always feels a little wonky doing a review for a popular chain. Everybody's kinda been there, done that. However, when a particular location does a few things very well, it seems worthy of pointing out.  Even though the BF and I are non-drinkers, we usually plant our butts on the barstools. We both love watching sports and one of the biggest advantages of dining at any BJ's are the multiple TVs. Another plus here is that you'll probably be waited on by Haans or Channing, easily two of the friendliest and most efficient bartenders I've ever met. They always greet new friends with a smile and never let a glass go empty for long. The quality of the food here has dramatically improved over the last year. A French dip that used to have tough, stringy meat is now tender and loaded with meat. They stepped up the au jus too, adding herbs and seasonings. Calamari is more consistent as well, arriving perfectly crisp on the outside, with soft squid inside. My inner sauce queen loves that they serve it with marinara and aioli for dipping. Two fairly recent additions to the menu that are worthy of an enthusiastic thumbs-up are the salmon quinoa bowl and the portobello Swiss burger. The salmon is an incredible value. For $12 at lunch you get a bed of seasoned quinoa topped with mushrooms, roasted red bell, sautéed red onion, asparagus, and a generous portion of glazed salmon. I'd been skeptical of ordering it, fearing it would be bland. Not so, it was very tasty and less than 795 calories as a bonus. The portobello burger was unexpectedly gourmet. The large slice of umami bombed mushroom on top of the burger was of course a treat, but I didn't realize they were also throwing in arugula, caramelized onions, pesto, and a balsamic vinaigrette. The combination of flavors was incredibly delicious. Highly recommend adding bacon to really take it over the moon. However, the $2 extra for bacon takes it out of value range creating a whopping $15 burger. Worth it occasionally, but probably won't be on the regular rotation.  The rewards program is one of the best in corporate America. You earn a point for every dollar spent. Several different rewards are available, but the one I like to shoot for is earning $25 off your meal after 350 points. Not so hard to do if you darken their doorway about twice a month."
Julie L.,"Woodland, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2017,I'd give it zero stars if possible.  Went to husbands work dinner.  Ordered the special prime rib.  Medium rare to medium.  The person next to me ordered prime rib medium rare.   When food was delivered the waitress called out my order prime rib all veggies.  Set it down and left.  It was well over well done and sitting right next to an actual med rare prime rib.  Couldn't eat it.  So dined on literally green beans and asparagus.  Other party at my table had order that never came.  He took his in a to go box since the entire group minus me had finished.  This is after politely waiting for him to be served before the party started to eat but finally at his request dined on a half cold meal.   No refills.  Went to bar to get my own drink since didn't have edible food while the other 9 people ate. Contacted BJ's the said they would send a voucher  to try there again... needless to say they never sent it.  Never ever again.   Update this yelp review... asked to please contact mgr... mgr on duty didn't bother to show up at table.   Mgr had to okay bosses meal removed from tab as well as mine.  Didn't show his face at our table.  Too little too late.  Seriously.  You had a chance WHEN WE WERE THERE!  Now you care??
Nikole B.,"San Francisco, CA",9,30,31,3.0,6/23/2017,"I mean it's BJ's what do you expect. I never wait too long for a table, wait staff is decent and friendly AND I love their $3 desserts on Tuesday :) and they also have a new pink cadillac martini super BOMB!!!"
Yao C.,"Sacramento, CA",231,343,3605,4.0,4/16/2015,"Great place for groups and the food is usually pretty good considering it's a chain restaurant! Setting: spacious and great for groups... Parties and sporting events work out very well! They have plenty of tv's for the games and boxing matches! The center section in the bar is the coolest because they have a multiscreen TV that shows all the sports!  Spacious waiting area as well and a good atmosphere! Food: good burgers! I usually get the crispy jalapeño burger with the skinny fries! It's a great sizes burger that comes out fresh! The fries are crispy and hot!  A real popular app is the calamari and it's really good and crispy! Comes with two sauces... A tangy Marianna sauce and a blue cheese white sauce... Not sure if that's correct but it's good! The Parmesan chicken is good with mashed potatoes but my lady likes to order fries instead! The chicken is crispy yet moist!  They also have a large drink menu and i keep it simple and get the frosted glass with house Brewed root beer!  Desserts are popular with the warm cookie and ice cream! I love the Oreo one! It's delicious! Overall, sometimes it will have its off days but it's good most of the time!! It's busy on Fridays and Saturdays!!! Bumping! Happy eating!"
Jenny H.,"Sacramento, CA",3,4,,1.0,7/15/2017,"Terrible service. Nearly empty restaurant, they had to think where to seat us. At least the host didn't expect us to sit in the filthy booth he first took us to. Silverware was dirty. Food delivered without asking if we needed condiments. Eli, our ""server"" when asked to retrieve said condiments and dressing for the dry (as in no dressing) salad I received, took another order first.  Another server we flagged down was able to help us before Eli ever returned. Will never come here again."
Amanda D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,109,18,1.0,6/9/2017,"BJs, BJs. What happened? I feel like BJs is a boyfriend where we had some amazing times and then you find out through mutual friends that he's a jobless alcoholic. We haven't been to BJs in months and our experience tonight left us sadly very disappointed.  Our appetizer order of chicken lettuce cups tasted like some cut up chicken with a bottle of soy sauce poured over the top. It's was just pure sodium.  Next came my husband's clam chowder in a bread bowl. Except it came out in a regular bowl and had to be sent back, which took another 15-20 min. When he did get it back, he said that it tasted very fishy.  My chicken Cobb salad was inedible. I waited 10-15 min after it was brought out to get the salad dressing. The chicken tasted canned almost like the chopped stuff you get in the tuna fish cans."
Kate B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/21/2017,"One of my favorite BJ's locations in Sac, the food is somewhat consistent here. Though if it's a busy night, be prepared to wait a long while for the food to arrive. I have been here a lot, and the only thing that irks me is that when I ask for extra garlic knots to go with my pasta, some servers here will force you to pay extra, while others are gracious enough to give you extra for no additional cost.   Also, if you order pick up, make sure to double check all food they give you, because they have a tendency to ""mess up,"" which will require you to drive back."
Shannen C.,"Sacramento, CA",271,467,4006,4.0,8/9/2016,"BJs is one of the few chains that I can tolerate. I think overall the food is pretty good and service can be a hit or miss but mostly it's been good for me. I been coming here for years and my favorite thing is the soup and salad. I really love their wedge salad,clam chowder and tomato soup. Remember to sign up for a BJ's rewards card and you get a free dessert and coupons sent to your email."
