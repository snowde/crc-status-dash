Brandon B.,"Davis, CA",14,187,1,3.0,1/18/2010,"We've hit this BJ's location at least 10 times.  BJ's has been the default choice in Natomas for beer and giant portions of comfort food for a couple of years now.  The place is always busy, but the wait times aren't too bad (sit at the bar and have a beer or on the benches outside).  The bar area has a massive wall of TV screens tuned to various sporting events, and there are similarly large TVs strategically placed throughout the restaurant so that you may never have to engage in conversation with your dinner partners. We have never had a bad meal here, but I've never wanted to rave about things either.  The atmosphere doesn't make you want to hang out and enjoy your (decent) beer for all that long, but it's a kid-friendly place (triangular prism-shaped crayons that don't roll off the table -- genius!) and there's something for everyone."
Ubersheist G.,"Ventura, CA",23,110,15,4.0,6/14/2007,"Seriously?  Only 3 stars?  Sure, this place is a chain, but they really do strive to put out some quality products.  This is coming from someone who avoids chain establishments as much as possible. The macho straight guy in me hates to admit outloud just how good something as fruitily-named as the ""pizookie"" (ice cream 'pizza' on a massive cookie) is, but it's just too fabulous to deny. I didn't give it four stars since I've had to wait most of the times that I've gone there, the beers that I've tasted there in the past have been... meh..., and the atmosphere is very chain-y TGI Fridays/typical noisy and bustling franchise/corporate drone restaurant.  However, the food's always been very good, reasonably priced, and varied enough to accomodate anyone and everyone in our group.  This place comes well recomended from me."
Roberta X.,"Sacramento, CA",71,12,3,1.0,10/25/2009,"Do not order the Cajun pasta. It's a sad excuse for pasta. The pasta was hard and the taste was very dry lacking in sauce. The chicken was also dry. Do not buy the tropical mojito. My friend bought that and it was sugar and water with no alcohol. In addition, we were seated near the walk way like we were part of the grand entrance. The only thing that was good was dessert."
Kimberly B.,"Oakland, CA",95,18,21,1.0,4/30/2012,"My parents and I had lunch at the Truxel Rd. BJ's yesterday and had a horrible experience. My pulled pork sandwich was fine and my fries were hot, the coleslaw however, had little to no dressing. My Mom had the Roast Beef Dip and the first one was ice cold as were her fries - the bartender (we sat at the bar) was kind enough to replace it - which took forever - he even spoke to TWO managers to try and speed things up. When it came out - very little meat, non-melted cheese - overall BAD - Mom was NOT happy. Then one manager came over and she complained about the amount of meat and he says ""oh, it's pre-packed in baggies, let me check..."" never saw him again. Dad's mac n' cheese was discusting, we all tasted it - gross, and also not hot. Then, the bartender gave us a sample of an upcoming Spring Salad of mixed greens, watermelon and feta - the salad and melon were totally wilted and there was absolutely no flavor to the ""light balsamic vinagrette"". They may want to re-think that one. Bottom line, I feel like the manager should have at least offered to take mom's sandwich off the bill, but didn't and we paid and left - swearing to never come back."
patrick w.,"Sacramento, CA",235,253,24,4.0,8/26/2009,"i've been here a few times, usually at my brothers request. always has been pretty tasty and good service. tonight though, i experienced something in the way of customer service that i believe is worth mentioning somewhere. i came by to meet some family for drinks and a bite to eat in the e gizzy. the waitress i had was real nice, and i got  my standard three refills of diet coke which i believe is mandatory for decent service. The food comes out, mine is not served...i honestly didnt even realize that my food was over 20 minutes getting to me....  the manager comes out of nowhere and says ...we have a problem...your foods taking longer than i like to see...im going to comp your food for you... proactive customer service is amazing. i do this often in my job and honestly i appreciate it when people take the initiative to do so. he has personally made me a fan of the restaurant. ..plus the avocado spring roll type dish i had was awesome... kudos"
Allison B.,"Chico, CA",57,108,21,5.0,3/26/2010,"I'll gladly drive an hour from Yuba City to Sac just to eat here. The food has always been amazing, staff always super friendly, and the drinks are great! Also, you can't try this place without ordering a pizookie. Mmmm."
Brittany S.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,51,,3.0,11/22/2010,"Went here with a co-worker for a late lunch and a few beers.  Usually we're pretty good about rooting out good restaurants in the Sac area, but this was ""we need alcohol and food right now"" situation. BJ's is a blue-collar Cheesecake Factory.  Over-the-top decor with a high-end but folksy Americana theme, extremely loud, nothing on the menu under 1200 calories.  There are perhaps three vegetarian options on the menu.  I got the Ceasar salad, it wasn't bad but not amazing either.  Other veg options: garden salad, veggie pizza, veggie burger.  Maybe buried somewhere in their novel-length menu are other veg-friendly dishes, but I can only read so fast.  And yes, I realize by being a (mostly) veg I bring this on myself at places like this ;) The service was quick and friendly.  Beer was mediocre, but at happy hour prices, I certainly wasn't complaining.  Basically, their lager tasted like Bud.  The unfiltered wheat was good.  They have about a million beer choices, so perhaps I just made a poor one.   Three stars for good prices, service, and beer selection . . .  but just don't expect much from the food."
Richard G.,"Antioch, CA",13,31,,5.0,5/28/2010,"oh bjs, we finally got to meet. after hearing raves and reviews, i needed to check this place out and tango face to face. Menu has a nice selection. I went and ordered the fish tacos. That right there is a meal that will keep you full probably for the rest of the day!  although i rarely pair my meals with a beer, i gave it a shot and tried their brew. first cup was a light hef and then the second i stepped up with a dark. not bad and if u have any room left, dont forget the pizookie! its worth it overall, good service. a place i'll consider for a birthday gathering of some sort or just a good ole family outing"
Robert D.,"Sacramento, CA",1,12,,3.0,1/2/2013,"Great beers, great service, great wine, but their steak tastes awful. Very plain, no flavor, and the only thing that saved it was the A1 sauce and the gravy mashed potatoes."
Katherine C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,18,1,3.0,3/22/2010,"In response to an e-mail to the company, I received several voice mail messages from the manager at this location askign to talk about my experience.  Before we could speak, I got a goft card in the mail to make up for my bad experience.  Great customer service goes a long way!"
Chi-Hye M.,"Honolulu, HI",109,111,34,3.0,10/29/2007,The pizza is good...plenty toppings and filling after having 2 slices. the dessert was better...i think
Andrew K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",27,55,1,3.0,10/25/2006,"Yes, it's a chain - but they serve great beer and good food.  Their deep dish pizza doesn't compare to Zachery's in Berkeley, however, it fills and hits the spot nonetheless.  Of the beers, their piranha is a bit too hoppy for my tastes, but I really enjoy their jeremiah red.  +3 for the beers, +1 for the food, -1 for the inevitable wait to get seated."
Jenny P.,"Sacramento, CA",4,23,,4.0,10/9/2012,I love this place food are great with good price and great services.  They give you such a big portion.  friendly people...with great music .nice causual hang out place with friends ....we have such a good times there and get to each so much.  Their drinks are very good
Gina B.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,124,45,5.0,11/26/2011,"One of my top favorite restaurants in Sac. There is always something delicious on the menu. The best avocado egg rolls and you MUST try a pizookie! It's a giant cookie with ice cream on top straight out of the oven. The servers are always pleasant and check on you often, but not enough to be a bother."
Eric G.,"Caldwell, ID",6,4,,4.0,11/15/2010,"Freaking tasty. Always some good brew on tap and the food is priced well and tasty. Side note, my best friend is a vegatarian and raves about the food here!"
Rob B.,"Sacramento, CA",171,168,23,3.0,2/5/2010,"Generally a decent place.  Beer is ok; the recent special Grand Cru brew was excellent.  Food is ok.  I typically have one of their sandwiches or pizza's.  My wife likes the Turkey Club.  I usually get thin crust; its well made, although the sauce is a little on the sweet side.  My three kids love it, which is primarily why I go.  All in all, generally a good experience, although when they get busy you can expect the quality of the service to go down dramatically.  Tip:  For lunch, get there by 11:30 AM, for dinner by 5:00, and you will be seated immediately.  Get there any later, and you can wait a long time."
wendy r.,"Sacramento, CA",5,37,,3.0,6/19/2011,"Not the best, not the worst. I agree with earlier reviewer who said don't expect and service or attention from the the hostess stand. My husband and I have been here many times and never fail to get a laugh out of the mysteriously snobby attitude of the BJ's Natomas hostess stand. This isn't Claw in New York for gosh sakes (think movie ""Date Night"").  It is kind of funny. The place is mediocre, pizza was not very good and this is their specialty, mind you! Burgers are good, salads are pretty good. It's so-so. Service is ok. Wait staff is always pretty friendly, but lacking in good customer service skills. BJ's manager, if you read this, I have tons of restaurant and customer service/hotel experience, I would be glad to offer you my services and train your staff to provide superior, top notch, knock-their-socks-off service. There is actually a technology behind it, it doesn't always work to just tell your staff to be nice or try to give good service, you have to show them how to do it. It's called training. In fact, the only place we had good service in our 6 years of living in Sacramento has been at Ella downtown on K street. The waiter did in fact knock our socks off with his superb service. Good thing too because food was not great and way over priced."
Vespa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",33,30,48,3.0,3/1/2011,"It took so long to get seated. There were about 5 to 6 girls who work there and they were just standing around and stared at us as we walked to the waiting area. The food was great and they have big portions. The waiter was so hard to find. It had a good atmosphere, we were there for a long time just talking."
Aida N.,"Sacramento, CA",10,59,,3.0,3/3/2010,"BJ's is one of my fav happy hour spots. It's only worth it to go to the bar area for their specials.  Honestly, the service is superior because the girls are so much  more attentive at the bar.  I only come for the pizza here & the artichoke appetizer Otherwise.. The food in Sac is pretty hit or miss anywhere you go. It's like ""frozen food"" prepared...."
Howie M.,"Farmington, CA",2,36,,4.0,5/24/2012,"I have only eaten take out from here. Last night I had Chicken Fried Steak, Mashed potatoes and vegetables. It was really good. The gravy on the Steak was tasty, it had just enough pepper to give it a little kick. The potatoes are excellent, they are mixed with cheese so you can't go wrong. In the past I had a pizza, I wasn't impressed with it. I have also had a burger in the past and it was pretty good. So after eating there three times, two good meals out of three, I give it 4 stars."
