Russ S.,"Sacramento, CA",4,101,51,4.0,12/14/2009,"My wife and I got the carside to go. Called in the order and they said 10 minutes. We arrived to find 1 carside spot (taken) next to 3 handicap spots. The lot was entirlely full. We called the number on the sign when we arrived. Food was hot and fresh and well packaged when they brought it out. To our dismay,  one of the items was mismarked, and we got home to find a turkey sandwich in place of a burger. We called then returned for the correct item. We received an apology and the correct item as well as a $10 gift card. Pizza was excellent but small. Kids chicken strip meal was great. Burger was great. We will go back because of the gift card."
Mina H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,21,4,1.0,2/15/2009,"I went here a few months ago for a friend of a friend's birthday and it was disappointing to say the least. We went with a large group, and it seems that one side of the table was getting better service than the side I was seated at. One of our friends received unnecessary and borderline racist comments from the waitress who did a terrible job of serving us. Seriously, we were ideal customers and did nothing to warrant such terrible service - she forgot drinks, didn't refill water, dropped off a stack of plates on one side of the table, etc. On top of that, the deep dish pizza that everyone raves about was a salty mess. I know this place is a chain, so I hold them to relatively low standards. Still, I wish I could give BJ's 0 stars for our awful experience."
George S.,"Vallejo, CA",15,27,,2.0,6/24/2011,"Always a farvorite of mine, but alas the love affair is over!  On my visit to BJ's today I discovered that they have discontinued the best item on their menu, the Meatloaf Sandwich...yeah, that's right, I said meatloaf!  It was an awesome dish with great nutritional value because it was always served with high quaility lightly steamed fresh vegies.  TODAY however, I was forced into choosing their similar dish, the roast beef sandwich.  The meat was very good, no problem there...and it had the same volume of simple carb items, mashed 'tatas and a piece of sourdough bread.  But what it didn't have were the high quality vegies..instead it was a weak assortment of baby carrots, cooked celery and onions...wow, very limited nutritional bioavailability there, and also a lot cheaper for BJ's corp.  So, long story short, the recession has arrived at BJ's, even though they manage to stay packed all the freakin' time!!??!  It makes me think it's not the recession but corporate greed, and at what cost, yours and my nutritional health!  For this reason BJ's entire corp gets 2 stars from me.  And on another note a mom and pop resteraunt across the street closed it's buisness last week...what the hell are we doing to ourselves?  We are slaves to corporations!  Please, if there is a choice between a mom and pop or a corp run buisness then make the better choice, support people, not corporations!"
Olivia D.,"San Francisco, CA",198,138,77,5.0,3/24/2009,"My coworkers and I used go after work for drinks and appetizers.  The sampler appetizer is sooo yummy (spinach artichoke dip and santa fe spring rolls are a must!) and their hand crafted brews are really good too.  Ask your server to recommend one-- you won't be disappointed, or try one of the seasonal brews, so good!  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but they have a number you can call ahead so you can avoid that which is cool and convenient.  They have a huge menu, which can be tricky for indecisive people (like myself, ha) to navigate but everything I've tried has been really great.  You can't go wrong with the salads, and the pizzas!  And if you have room for dessert :) the pizookie is to die for mmmm"
Nancy F.,"Sacramento, CA",32,4,1,3.0,4/28/2010,"I been there twice and like the atmosphere not dissapointe,but i went there about 2 weeks ago and order the chicken potatoes,because was cover can't notice that the chicken was burn under all the chesse and they served to me lika that,not fear and will not return"
Nancy R.,"San Francisco, CA",278,237,9,4.0,1/20/2009,"Delicious food, horrible staff lol I mean wow... They give you the biggest baked potato you've ever seen with your steak."
Alan N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/20/2012,"Saw an ad in the paper today and thought it would be nice to take the family to BJ's for dinner.  Seated promptly but a bit cold in the back of the restaurant.  Everything went  well up to ordering the food.  The food took a little longer than anticipated, but once it arrived it became obvious.  The food was cold and the shrimp was uncooked.  It was suppose to be grilled shrimp but I didn't see one grill mark, just spices sprinkled on top of raw shrimp.  Had the steak and shrimp sent back and asked not to spit on it.  My wife's pot roast was 70% fat, but some people would enjoy the fat more than the meat.  Called the manager, Joey, to complain about the quality of our food.  He stated that he understood our frustration with the poor quality food and offered to take care of our dinner.  Next, we got a bill for the kids meal and a drink.  I thought Joey was suppose to take care of dinner?  Felt bad for the waiter and tipped him anyways. This restaurant is the worst in food, service and management.  Won't return unless they change chefs and managers"
Jon C.,"West Sacramento, CA",23,51,15,2.0,11/1/2009,"This was a great idea, and I am sure it's delightful for those who love beer. My wife and I don't drink, so that part will remain unrated. This place has a wide range of menu items. The thought of Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is a wonderful thing to think about, ordinarily. BJ's has the right idea. The little pizza lifter so it's above the table, the server delivers it with a huge clamp because the dish is still hot, and they even serve up your first slice. This was awkward at first, but it's kind of nice. You see all the melted cheese and it get's you all excited. You bite into it and, well, the cheese is kind of odd. It's watery and kind of flavorless. It's the same at both BJ's we've tried. The rest of their food is sort of ho hum. It's not the first, second, or even third place we think of when we go out."
Mike G.,"Winter Garden, FL",5,51,5,3.0,8/4/2009,"As far as a chain goes, this one isn't bad.  It is made better considering the fact that it is in a location surrounded by just about every chain restaurant you can imagine, which sort of makes this one of your better options.  The servings are large, the menu is large, the variety of beer is somewhat unique with some nice options.  The prices aren't that bad for the amount of food you get and the service is quite good.  Its smaller than the Cheesecake Factory but larger than your average Chili's.  A good choice when you are jonesing for some old fashioned processed food."
Kimi M.,"Parkville, MO",126,83,45,4.0,10/23/2008,"Been to this location a couple times. The place is bustling. Service is could be a little better. All of the food I've tasted there was good. I've had the broccoli and cheese soup in the bread bowl, yum! Although the bread I think said it was sourdough but didn't taste like it. The deep dish pizza and thin crust appetizer pizza were good. I have yet to try their famous ""Pizookie"" dessert but I hear it's awesome."
Steve F.,"Sacramento, CA",2,35,,2.0,3/25/2010,"Great food, horrible parking accomodations, and slow service.  Forget about actually sitting at a regular table.  The key here is swooping in on an empty one at the bar when the previous patron gets up to leave.  You have to be like a vulture here."
Jeremy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,38,,4.0,9/27/2008,"Dont really understand all the hate on this place. I've been eating here for years and its always been great! I stick with the pizza for the vast majority of the time, and thats what keeps me coming back. Fantastic thick buttery crust, good toppings, good cheese, good times. Make sure to say no tomatoes if you dont want any on the pie though, cause they come standard. The calzones are pretty dank ball too. The beer is hit or miss though, I will say. And the price can go up quickly when they have so many delicious items on the menu. Did i mention the pizookie? One of the greatest dessert items ever invented!"
frank s.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,28,,1.0,6/27/2008,"actually went to the one in elk grove...only order the burger cause was hungry....wow brewery burgers are usually good right? I was actually kind of angry it sucked so bad, so cheap in quality and tasted horrible.   I will never go back to bj's ever....don't go to a chain brewery like this go to one of the original ones in downtown."
Inigo M.,"San Francisco, CA",35,2400,69,4.0,1/20/2009,Outstanding baby back ribs and roast chicken-- unexpected. Otherwise it's your typical chain restaurant.
Jen C.,"Rio Linda, CA",93,11,,5.0,7/25/2011,"Love this place!!!!  Great food and great service!!!    If  you have not eaten here yet, you must go check it out.   Definately worth the visit!"
Jaymie M.,"Sacramento, CA",66,5,,4.0,5/29/2007,"I have eaten here a handful of times and let me just say that I have never had a bad experience. Me and my husband usually stroll in later in the evening to avoid the long wait to eat, and the bar is first come first serve so if you can find a table there then you wont have to wait at all. The menu has a wide range of options, I can never decide what I want to eat. The appetizers are GREAT! Gotta have the sliders, make sure to add cheese and bacon. PotStickers are also wonderful, Pizza is okay, not a big pizza fan though, my husband likes the pizza. Haven't tried the pasta, but probably wouldn't, will save eating pasta dishes for when I am eating at an Italian restaurant. I will say though that the Halibut Fish Tacos are to die for, I have had them twice and both times were great. The beer is good too, if you are a beer drinker and not picky about your beer I would greatly recommend the sampler, you get 6 oz. of six or seven different kinds of beer, the Jeremiah Red was my fave. The atmosphere is great, they play good music and my husband can keep up on his sports from anywhere in the restaurant. Something on the menu that I haven't tried but eventually will is one of their famous stuffed potatoes.  P.s. If you have room, don't forget the Pizookie."
monika l.,"San Francisco, CA",56,106,,1.0,12/27/2006,"What a joke this corporate franchise is! I have tried to do this place justice by going on three different occasions. When visiting the soon to be in-laws last week, my hubby and I decided to grab a bite and a beer before having to ""deal"" with the weekend. The wait was about an hour and a half. (And to think we were actually going to wait). We grabbed our ""vibrator"" and headed to the bar. The wait for a drink was apx. 20 minutes. And we waited patiently...for 20 minutes. I finally said something and they barked at me for not waiting my turn. Umm..Yea. It gets better. I wait 5 more minutes and they ask for my order and my ID. Until they see my 31 year old fiance's. They won't serve him. Why you ask? Because he just went to the DMV , and they hole punched his ID and gave him a paper one as well. They original wasn't even expired. SO ridiculous!  Back to the actual review and me not venting. Blue collar American families going ape shit in a restaurant with kids running around and dads getting drunk off of poor quality beer.  You would think with that much room to brew that they would have some quality instead of mass quantity. The pizza, is about as lack lusting as the beer. So many toppings that you lose the realization of eating pizza. There are better ways to ""fill"" a pizza space. Go to Zelda's downtown. They'll show you. The price is above average for the amount. Moving from Sac to the city, you realize that  there are just as many good pizza places in Sacramento as there are in the city. You just have to find them. And this my friend is not one of them. Andrew K. below me compared this to Zachary's in Berkeley, and JB's isn't even close. The management needs to take a few courses in ""turn over rate"" and ""working with your customers"".  Do me a favor and save your $50 bucks for two bad beers, a pizza with  flash frozen veggies and flavorless sauce, and a ""pizookie"" cookie with cheap vanilla ice cream and toll house ""thaw and cook"" cookies.  Go somewhere where they actually care about you/food. You'll be happy you spent the money elsewhere. There are other breweries in Sacramento that have WAY better customer service and you get the exact same bang for your buck!"
Tripp K.,"University Place, WA",16,49,,3.0,2/24/2009,"This location is usually pretty busy during lunch, which is the only time that I have been there.  We had a wait of 45 minutes, which for the traditional lunch is not going to work.  Additionally, make sure you call ahead if you are planning a lunch meeting, or show up early to make sure you can start on time.  Food is decent and the drinks are good."
Dave H.,"Sacramento, CA",4,43,9,4.0,11/6/2008,"pros: Good pizza, good cobb salad, good beer (try the flutes), big portions, good pizookie cons: always busy, kinda expensive, everything else besides pizza and cobb salad is mediocre still gets a 4/5 since i really do enjoy the pizza"
Matt B.,"Portland, OR",16,100,,4.0,11/30/2008,"I've had nothing but great dining experiences when I go to BJ's.  The salads, thick cut fries, burgers, chicken sandwiches and thin cut pizzas are all very good.  Beer is always cold and staff is friendly.  However, expect a long wait if you come around 7-10 on a Friday or Saturday night."
