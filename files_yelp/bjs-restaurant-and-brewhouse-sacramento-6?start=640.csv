Kayla M.,"Rocklin, CA",141,30,14,1.0,1/29/2010,"One of the worst restaurants I've been to. My experience there was Horrible.It was extremely crowded when i arrived, i had a cast on my foot from breaking it, I was in a wheelchair, So thinking our hostess would seat us somewhere in the front for easy access to get out, she decides to seat us all the way in the back of the Restaurant, hitting every single person in the bar. I final sat down. our waiter was friendly at first. we ordered salad and ""Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo"" the only okay thing on that plate were the cheese sticks. Everything else was repulsive. Then for a main dish i got the personal size great white because I'm allergic to red sauce on pizza and on the menu it said Alfredo sauce(My father and I orders pizza because of the great reviews) Anyway, My father orders BJs favorite.. as our food arrives our drinks were empty. You all know you need to wash your food down with something.. So me and my dad sat there waiting for about 30 mins starring at our waiter sitting at the bar chatting with the bartender.. finally he came towards us my father had to literally scream,""EXUSE ME?"" it got his attention.. the waiter then took our drinks, waiting patently. For 15 minutes again starring at him at the bar. He then walks passed us and serves the table next to us my father int erupts, "" excuse me can we have our drinks? "" the waiter says, ""oh sorry, i forgot"" Finally after probably an hour of waiting, he brings our drinks, i take a bit of the Great White pizza and for some reason it tasted like Cinnamon i look at the inside to see what it is and there is a thin line of red sauce i immediately stop eating. My Father and i didn't complain.. that night we ended up feeding our dogs the pizzas. I will NEVER step foot or cast in that place again!"
Bruce Y.,"Sacramento, CA",2,40,,3.0,8/12/2007,"Just another restaurant!  I rather spend my money some place else.  The food is pretty bland and for what you pay, you would expect more.  The drinks are pretty strong, the clam chowder tasty and I love the bread.  Other than that, nothing seems to be very good."
Rahul S.,"San Francisco, CA",1,20,,4.0,11/28/2010,went here for drinks and food before the bulls vs. kings game and the drinks and food were really good and the prices were reasonable. The 8 beer sampler was $12 and had 6oz of beer in each glass which is a steal.
Jenny R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,3.0,11/16/2008,"Love love love the food (salads, PIZZA, pasta, pizookie etc) There is ALWAYS a wait..and service is hit or miss. I've had pretty good service lately, but I hated it quite a few times.  My birthday was an awful experience.  First, our reservation wasn't entered into the computer, so we had to wait.  The server spilled soda all over my brother and boyfriend without any apology, plus didn't have it cleaned up for over 10 minutes (we used OUR napkins).  But other than that, it's been ok. Great for late night outings."
Michelle I.,"Sacramento, CA",3,103,,3.0,12/23/2009,"Had a Christmas dinner there last night with a group of about 25. It was buffet style with  pre-arranged appetizers and entrees. Despite a 7:00 reservation, we still had to wait 30 minutes for the table (or should I say the food) since the table was empty when we arrived at 7:00. I guess they preferred us all to stand in the bar and drink!! Once seated, we had a very attentive waitress. I've only eaten the French Dip Sandwich there as it's to die for. But, as options were not available, I had 1 of the 4 various deep dish pizzas, the Mediterranean. More dough/bread that toppings, and none of it had any distinctive flavor. Not one for deep fried anything, i passed on all appetizers. Overall, i would personally stick to the sandwiches, and can get a much better pizza (my preference!!) at Papa Murphys'!!!"
Sara G.,"Sacramento, CA",1,4,,5.0,4/17/2008,"I love BJ's. The first time i went there was for my boyfriends best friends girlfriend. I ordered the fedachinni (sp). The most recent time i was there was for my high school prom. Me and about 10 other people went there before the dance for dinner. they were very nice, really fast. and there was about 4 other prom parties there for dinner the same time we were and they kept up with everything. I would suggest at least visiting there. I have heard they have good beer also."

mariza r.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",31,213,29,4.0,7/5/2007,"to be clear, i only put 4 stars because of the wait that is associated with this place-- i do not usually experience any wait because we take a late lunch or early dinner-- you will leave full.  this place is supposedly known for its pizza, but with an expensive addiction to this place, i have yet to order one as the main course. i have had the appetizer one (pesto cilantro) and it was mighty tasty-- especially because we topped it with some of the shrimp from another dish (ps- i think its2 dollars off any appetizer during happy hour-- sit in the bar area) i dont think i've ever had something here that i did not like. lunch and half sizes are a scam.. you get half the food for $2 less than the whole price-- get it all and just take it home. the portions here are LARGE, dont take the portions as a challenge.. give in to the leftovers box.. we personally never make it to desert but you do get a free pizookie on your birthday-- just mention its your birthday.  now to the serious stuff-- the shrimp pasta (either of the two) is great. the bbq beef sandwhich is amazing. the ribs are fantastic (ask for extra sauce on the side and wet naps)-- do not get the baked potato-- go with the mashed-- the gravy is--- just do it.. but the creme of the crop-- strawberry lemonade- aka the main reason i go to BJ's. i love sugar, and perhaps it is because i get it with no ice, but its super sweet. i do think it depends on the location though because the BJ's in Orange County has a legit amount of sweetness.  average cost for 2 is $40-50, and the service does slow down if it's busy- but if you have a good server it isnt that bad"
Brokester C.,"Union City, CA",45,152,1,4.0,5/1/2008,"i'm just a sucka for this place, and i don't know why. maybe it's cuz of the berry burst cider, or the nutty brewnette. maybe it's because of the chicken lettuce wraps, or because of the chicken wings. maybe it's because of the big screens with all the basketball games on. i mos def know it's not because of the ceasar salad, cuz that sh!t is nasty, for real. the burger is just OK. never tried the pizza, or any of the other beers. i always leave here with a good buzz, and a smile on my face, so i heart you bj's."
Derrick H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,18,5,3.0,7/13/2007,"Located in the Sacramento Gateway, BJ's Restaurant is just another corporate franchised restaurant serving typical American favorites; pizza, salad, pasta, burgers and fries, in a hip, yet modern setting. With an on tap brewery and bar littered with plasma tvs on the walls, this place tends to fill up during weekends and venues at Arco Arena. The food is nothing really special, somewhat expensive for the quantity and quality offered. However, I was here for the drinks, and the lady, the desserts. We had a pizookie, a hot chocolate chip cookie slapped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Its amazing how these 2 go so well together, but for $6.95, I am not sure if it is worth that price. The beers are good, my fav is the darkest beer on tap, with its sweet yet smooth flavor. This place is not worth manuvering leaps and bounds in the parking lot for the food, but for a night of good drinks, and pazookie. Enjoy."
Camille C.,"Sacramento, CA",25,162,3,1.0,4/8/2007,"We came with a group of 5 on a Saturday evening, so we had to wait 45 min. No biggie--it was to be expected.  However, the service was bad, horrible, and even worse. First of all, we were seated in the very back corner of the restaurant (no more than 2 feet away from the emergency exit and where the servers come in/out of the kitchen) at a table that really seats 4, despite the fact that there were other tables open. If we made any movements or gestures, we surely would've knocked a tray out of a server's hands. Our waiter takes our order, brings our drinks, and after what seemed like forever, had a different server bring us 2/5 dishes. After another 15 minutes, the other 3 dishes are brought out by yet another server. One of those dishes was a salad, and the other an appetizer (chili cheese fries)--I have no idea why it would take THAT long for those dishes to be prepared. Our original waiter comes by to let us know that he'll be taking his break and some other server will be ""helping"" us. We never saw our original waiter again. I asked for some ketchup for my burger and fries, which were now cold as I didn't have the heart to eat my food before my friends got their orders, and THAT took forever to come too. We should've known better, but we ordered dessert, and that also took forever. It even took forever for them to pick up our bill so we could pay and get the hell out of there. I've been to other BJ's, and I'd say their food is generally worthy of about 3 stars, but the service here was non-existant. Therefore, 1 dull star for the dull service."
