Tony M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,10,,2.0,7/18/2017,Went here with my brother and nephew as i know my nephew enjoys this place. The beer on tap was limited for a so called brew house. It took way too long to have our order taken and get some beers - it was not that busy as we went after the lunch crowd. Food came and our waitress didnt come by to check on us until our meal was almost finished asked if we wanted another beer but didnt ask how the food was - i wasn't impressed with the food. i had a grilled cheese  with soup. the sandwich was greasier than the french fries and salty - it was terrible!  the clam chowder was like gravy you put on biscuits i didnt finish any of my meal.
Roger M.,"Sacramento, CA",61,94,63,2.0,10/31/2016,Out with my wife for a Halloween dinner date. Got our drinks ok. We ordered our dinner my wifes was good but my rib eye sucked. Asked for it med well and all i could taste was the burnt meat from the grill. Only could eat half of it before i had enough of the burnt taste. I had to ask the server twice for butter for my dry baked potato. The asparagus still had the ends on them. Ill go to some place else next time.
Bridgette F.,"Sacramento, CA",1,6,1,1.0,9/28/2017,My boyfriend and I were super hungry and decided we wanted to eat here. It was around 8pm and decently busy but we were still seated right away by one of the hostesses. She told us our waiter/waitress would be right with us. 10 minutes later still no waiter so we approached another waiter who was serving tables nearby and they said they'd get someone to take our order. Another 10 minutes pass and still no waiter or even waters at our table. In total we waited 30 minutes for absolutely no acknowledgement and left with hungry stomachs.
Gabby M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,8,,1.0,3/29/2017,I put a zero because the service was the worst I have ever had in my life.  I myself have school tomorrow and who spends two hours waiting for a burger?? How ridiculous!!!! I will never ever come back to this BJ's restaurant again! And neither should you. Save you money an time!
Adam A.,"Sacramento, CA",11,12,19,4.0,5/24/2016,"It's been to long since I've eaten here, that being said I this is a restaurant you have to try at least once. I had dinner with my mother and despite the crowd of people waiting for a table it only took five mins to be seated.  Here is the only thing negative i can say about BJ's is how cramped you feel. ""Who are you and why are you in my lap"" is how i feel some times.  Despite this the noise isnt that bad and you can have a conversation with your party without having to yell. Ok to the good stuff. I had a small pizza, half Great White and half Spicy Hawaiian Chicken, with a sample of the BJ's PM Porter and BJ's Tatonka Stout.  The Great White is my favorite pizza here.  Skip Round Table and get a BJ's Great White every time. The Spicy Hawaiian was good but when you say theres bacon on my pizza i better taste it!  Between the Porter and the Stout i would recommend the porter. Think Guinness light. The Stout was a little heavy for my taste. Overall it was a great meal.  P.s.  Sorry to call you out BEN!  You where a great waiter. Fast, funny, always had a smile, and super hot. Lol ^_^"
Julian G.,"Sacramento, CA",80,39,13,4.0,8/26/2016,"Great place! I come here with a friend to just hang out and its a great restaurant with a nice ambiance. Food is great, just wish there was happy hour."
Three D.,"Woodland, CA",110,116,53,2.0,5/20/2017,"Since I cannot message the business. Here's a note to the manager. I find it hard to believe that when a customer asks if the bartender can make the jalapeño cucumber margarita without the seeds. The manager or owner would approve of the answer ""NO, they come chopped with seeds"" How hard is it to de seed a slice of jalapeño? I'm sad because I like the drink and I'm a mixologist."
Amm S.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,16,4,4.0,7/4/2017,"Good food. Had grilled alfredo pasta extra spicy, which was good though i think the chicken was a little less. My brother had california club sandwich which was tasty. The fries were yummy."
Tanji D.,"Sacramento, CA",1,4,2,3.0,6/24/2017,This is a good spot to grab a reasonably priced meal  & drinks (if you partake).  Fun times with family and friends
Erin L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,47,2,3.0,5/21/2017,"Not a bad place to eat. The staff is friendly, and the place is clean. I did have one experience when I ordered out, and the young man who gave me my order didn't know what the drink was or how it was made, even though what I picked was on the menu. I ended up looking it up on my phone to tell him what was in it. But he was friendly and joked about it, and it only delayed my order a few minutes so I didn't mind. The fries are quite good, and I really like the burgers and sandwiches, the pasta leaves something to be desired"
David S.,"Live Oak, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/21/2017,"My wife ate here last night before a play. Our grand daughter wanted clam chowder. It appeared to be just routine canned soup. Very blah and salty. Additionally, she stated that the service was less than adequate."
Laura T.,"Sacramento, CA",321,35,201,5.0,10/4/2016,Delicious salmon at this bjs! If you get the wedge salad just request for salad on the side because it can be a bit much!
Rich L.,"Woodland, CA",1387,142,23463,4.0,11/15/2015,"One of the few national chain restaurants that get it.    I very much dislike national chains and would much rather support a small local business but this chain does things right. I don't drink alcohol but all my beer buddies concur that their beer selection is excellent and served properly...that's good enough for me. The menu is a bit extensive but that is one of the beauties of this place, there's something for everyone AND they do it all well. Pizzas are a pretty big seller here; many different types from flatbread to deep dish, they are all very good. Pasta dishes and sandwiches are tasty and always perfect. The burgers or also on point.    The service for this location is better than the Arden location and superior to the Elk Grove location. There is always staff willing to help and I have never had them say ""I'll get your server"" they handle it.    I've been to a few large parties here and the service is still top notch. The west side of the restaurant can be closed off giving your party some privacy and much quieter room.   It is a loud restaurant but between the food, the service and abundant parking, you will have a very pleasant experience."
Sam M.,"Dixon, CA",6,10,,2.0,5/14/2017,"Probably the worst service we've ever received from a Bj's. Trying some new computer system to take and place orders might seem like a good idea but orders were not exactly correct. Takes FOREVER for drink refills, and instead of having a order corrected quickly, a new order has to be placed. Same footed when reordering drinks. I shouldn't have to wait 15-20 minutes for a refill. I hope they get it figured out sooner rather than later or I can see them losing business."
Christine C.,"Midtown, Sacramento, CA",50,10,2,5.0,4/30/2017,I had the best experience and waiter! Farris is amazing and super helpful. Great drinks and amazing food! Thanks Farris!
Atolonia M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/30/2017,Everything was ok. My friends shrimp and asparagus dish had very little (amount and size) shrimp and he was completely disappointed. I love lemon on my salmon and kept getting little bar wedges of lemon that did not cut it. Service was fine though.
Sabrina L.,"San Francisco, CA",809,89,224,5.0,6/5/2016,Currently sitting in the waiting area because we have a party of 19 and they're offering us amazing customer service! :) The wait is about an hour to an hour and a 1/2 and they brought us single serving pizza slices!  I love great service! Go BJ's!
Luis R.,"North Highlands, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/20/2017,"We went in and we had a server who was doing a good job. He unfortunately had to go on a break and that's when it all went bad. He had been relieved by RENNE I believe her name is and all she had to do was charge simple right? I'm giving her the money we were a lot and we didn't want to give anyone a headache by telling them to split the check. So we all put our money unfortunately not all of us had cash so we made three separate transactions two cards and one cash. RENNE stated there's a gratuity when I know there is we don't just go and leave nothing. I ignored her first comment then she made that same comment twice that's when I thought I was being disrespected. I wrote a not to RENNE on the receipt in which it stated you don't have to repeat that there's a gratuity amount when I know there is one and that it was unacceptable that no where does it state I have to leave a tip. I personally gave her the receipt as soon as she read it and laughed she went looking for me and started to smirk. She made a comment like"" if they can't pay why do they come here"". Unacceptable this is by far the worst experience I have seen ever is it because my skin tone is not the same as hers? Bad"
Linda C.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",228,68,454,3.0,2/21/2016,"Came here for dinner with the boyfriend after the movies. There was a 15-20 minute wait, and they will text you to let you know when your table is ready.  The restaurant is pretty big, and there were a lot of tables. The service was alright. Took our server awhile to get to us every time because they had so many other tables to attend to.  We ordered the deep dish pizza, mahi mahi tacos, and calamari. The food was alright - nothing too special.  Drinks - they have a large variety of beer, cocktails, refreshers, etc. Will probably come back for drinks or happy hour sometime!"
Keely M.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",232,179,427,1.0,8/10/2016,"I had one of the worst dinning experiences at this Natomas location of BJs I have ever experienced. Our waitress was one of the worst waitresses I have ever had, I wish I knew her name to post it here but honestly I didn't see her enough the whole trip to get her name. I actually had to get up after our food was delivered and walk across the restaurant to get someone to bring me water. Originally the waitress took 20 min to bring two waters and a beer to our table then never came back to being more water or offer new drinks.  She finally came back to our table to take our order but was very short and had no sense of urgency or care at all. We had a party of 7 you would think she, at the very minimum would care about her tip, but she didn't. We ended up tipping two dollars only because we couldn't walk away giving her nothing. Our food was cold like it had been sitting in the window way too long he pizza was soggy and they never brought my nieces burger at all we ended up canceling her burger because she was hungry we gave her some of our food (she is only 7 didn't quite understand why she didn't get food).  It took 2 hours to get a cold pizza and finally get out of the damn restaurant. I will not go back to think location, I think the waitress is a reflection of the management which I am sure have no idea how to run a restaurant. Someone needs to be replaced in this place and you can start with the Managment!!"
