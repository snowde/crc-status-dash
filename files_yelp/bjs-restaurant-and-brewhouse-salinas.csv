Paul S.,"Elkhorn, CA",5,8,,5.0,12/31/2017,"Eat here at least once a month, sometimes 2 or 3 times a month, maybe 30 or 40 visits so far.  With few exceptions, food has been just perfect.  Staff has always tried to bend over backwards, extremely accommodating, knows the food they serve really well, very generous when things aren't perfect.  The chief cook has even come out on occasion to talk to customers.  Big restaurant, nice atmosphere though can get noisy, some very nice large tables and WiFi.   As for those bad experiences, they were not nearly significant to turn me away from coming back, as many other restaurants have (on the first visit), largely due to a busy day and waiter who probably was new.  The only incident involving food was receiving a salad that was warm and soggy and did not seemed like it came off someone else's table.  Ummmm... Oh, the bizookie deserts are to die for.  Literal joyous death by bizookie.  S'mores bizookie is amazing, but maybe a bit too much for one person.  Good item to share with 2 or 3.  They also have salted caramel bizookie if you're into that."
Timothy N.,"San Jose, CA",108,63,48,2.0,11/28/2017,"Pizookies!!! Literally the only reason to ever come here. Especially for $3 The plaza it is in gets way too much attention not to mention sharing an already small parking lot with numerous other food joints. Besides parking, if you come here on a weekend, expect it to be crowded. And what does crowdiness bring? Slow service. Besides having to wait an hour when they told and texted us '20 minutes'. The service was horrendous.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big restauraunt and each waiter is probably juggling several tables. I understand that, but when customers are literally sitting there with food done and pretty much eye-ing the waiters to find their waiter for the bill, a water refill, or dessert then there is an issue. It wasn't even just a couple of tables as I even witnessed numerous tables raise their hand to flag the waiter.  Hmm this next point I think is more of my fault but I think the waiter could have actually asked to make sure. Previously I had the triple chocolate pizookie and it was the best thing ever. Basically imagine brownies and ice cream. Anyways, so I forgot the full name this time and the waiter already took 20 minutes after we finished eating to just bring our check(didn't even check on us or ask if we wanted dessert, just brought the check), when I ask if we could add a chocolate pizookie.  My error? There is 2 chocolate pizookies. One that is a chocolate chip called a chocolate chunk pizookie(?) w/ their vanilla ice cream. Now yes, it is my fault, but I think he could have spent an extra 15 seconds asking me which one instead of just ordering the first one he remembered because they both have chocolate in their name. Didn't dock stars for this but figured it was part of the 'service' that they can provide."
Nicole L.,"Salinas, CA",0,60,23,3.0,10/27/2017,"I like coming here on Tuesdays for the $3 pizookies. We usually order one of every flavor and just enjoy a little bit of each.  I do not care for the lighting during dinner time. It is way too dark. I can barely see the menu, and there have been times my grandfather actually had to pull out a flashlight to read the menu.  The service is really a hit or miss. I have had excellent service and also really horrible service. It just depends on the day.  As for the food, it is pretty consistent. I like the soups and salads. Everything is always hot and fresh."
Sal B.,"Monterey, CA",82,28,69,2.0,9/17/2017,I live in Monterey. Ive heard Good things About BJs. I went My First time a Few Months ago I saw the Combo With Potato Soup or Salad. So I tried The Clam Chowder That was Good Tasted fresh. then The Potato with Bacon and Cheese. there was Very little Cheese and Bacon. After That was Gone all I ate was the potato. For $8 I was expecting a Loaded Potato More Cheese and Bacon Not 3 oz on it. On 9/17/17 I went back to Try something Else. I had the Root Beer Glazed Ribs. They were Great !! Then the Potato Skins. They Were Great A lot of Cheese and Bacon. I returned on 9/18/17. Had the Potato Skins again. Then Half Rack of Ribs with Mashed Potatoes and Ginger Creamed Corn. THE RIBS did Not Come with Their Peppered BBQ sauce ???It Was DRY and Chewy.   I could Not Eat the Corn. Too much Spices and over powering with Ginger could not taste the Corn.  Otherwise  ill Try something else.
Ben R.,"Salinas, CA",76,4,,1.0,12/30/2017,"The customer service here is fucking terrible. The wait times at the tables are way too long no matter how packed or empty it is. The front desk usually only has a bland look and ask basic ""table for two?"" With no actual greeting. The most annoying part is that the server never comes to check on you. The 4/5 times I went they took my order, brought my food, then check. No asking of we are alright or needed refills."
Melissa C.,"Salinas, CA",15,80,87,2.0,8/16/2017,"Walking in, you'd expect a warm welcome. Well the girls at the front ""desk"" make it awkward. No greeting, just the general question ""table for 2?"" and that's after they finish their conversation. The food here is just OK; not the best, not the worst. But they sure do make you wait for it. Food prices are questionable. You don't get checked on too often even though they have plenty of employees to go around. Don't see why this place is popular. Been here twice and left dissatisfied both times. Shouldn't have come here a second time but i chose this place as a whim. Not making that mistake again!"
Cyrina Y.,"Salinas, CA",72,26,18,2.0,11/9/2017,"Hate to say it, but the Salinas BJ's sucks. I've been here a handful of times (always by the suggestion of the person I go with), and each time the service is really bad. It takes a really long time for us to be served our food; the food isn't hot when we do get it; and we don't get checked on by the waiter/waitress. The menu is great with lots of options, but because of poor service, I'd opt for going to a different BJ's."
Mike M.,"Carmel, CA",121,281,290,4.0,8/26/2017,"Our server Victoria was a champ. She obviously was overstretched with tables but she still managed to provide a quality early dinner experience. I had the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken. The mashed potatoes and broccoli arrived warm, not hot but the flavor and texture of the sides made up for the lapse in presentation. The chicken was really good. The texture of the chicken breast was consistent. Maybe it's not real chicken, I don't know. I don't care either. It was delicious. The dish is a winner. I'll order it every time and I won't have to read the voluminous B.J.'s menu with a thousand items on it ever again. My wife had the Brewhouse Burger and it was another winner. The beef was top quality. The Caesar Salad side was thoroughly enjoyed by my wife. The overcooked, close to burnt Calamari is responsible for the loss of a star. We ate it anyway because we were too hungry from a long day to argue or wait for a replacement. It should not have been served. We'll continue to favor B.J.'s as a legitimate option in our dining rotation experience.  :)"
Paola M.,"King City, CA",24,9,19,4.0,9/2/2017,Favorite part of this restaurant the drinks can never go wrong with the root beer. Food is also delicious and staff is amazing very friendly and attentive. Ambience I like but sometimes it's really dark we can't even see our menus. Other thank that will definitely be returning.
Marlen P.,"Oxnard, CA",2,14,21,5.0,1/22/2017,"I'm giving this place a high rate because: 1. It was very clean 2. We were sat in less than 10 minutes 3. Our server, Joey, was phenomenal. 4. Our food came out quick 5. This Bj's food was the best out of all the Bj's I've dined at. *i dined here at about 1pm"
Eva A.,"Salinas, CA",60,9,,2.0,12/14/2017,"Went today for lunch. Appetizers were 4/10, pizza was 4/10 ( flavorless,  dough seemed a bit undercooked). Friend had pasta (undercooked) 3/10. Waiters were friendly, but forgot about table.. didnt have a drink for awhile.  Will not be returning. Im said to say it but ive had better food at dennys..."
John A.,"Salinas, CA",0,18,,2.0,5/5/2017,"IMO, the food is OK -- not great but not bad either.  The drinks, though (especially their own soft drinks) are good.   I knocked it down a star because of the service.  Sometimes we would get a server who was really on the ball but I stopped going here because the service is almost always too slow.  The servers are often inexperienced and have not yet learned how to do multiple things in one trip. That said, if you have a group, this is actually a pretty good place to go because they have plenty of room and the menu is large enough to have something to satisfy everyone."
Roxanne G.,"Salinas, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/23/2017,Five stars! This place is my go to. The service is amazing and the food is great. There is a manager there I didn't catch her name but she's a sweet heart thanks for all your hard work.
Joey M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",109,54,12,1.0,4/1/2017,"We had the most AWFUL experience at the BJ's in Salinas yesterday (3/31) A group of my friends and I were celebrating and decided to have lunch here. We arrived at about 2:30pm and walked to the hostess and said we'd like a table for 4. She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or in the dining room and we asked to be seated in the dining room. She said it would be about 15 minutes. We asked if she needed our name and she said no. We asked if we could get drinks at the bar and she said it would be fine and that she would grab us when our table was ready. Fast forward 15 minutes later, I walked back to the host table where a different hostess was waiting. I told her we checked in about 15 minutes ago and we were still at the bar waiting for our table. I told her the hostess before her did not get our names and she said that was fine and she'll come grab us.  Fast forward ANOTHER 15 minutes, my party moved back to the lobby and sat there waiting for our table to be ready. The hostess was just standing there and finally I asked again if the table was ready and she said ""Oh, we never got your names."" How long was she going to let us sit there in the lobby before saying anything to us? We were the only ones in the lobby? We checked in with her while we were at the bar so it makes no sense that she would have forgotten what we looked like? And like I said, how long was she gonna let us sit there before realizing we were still waiting? The dining room and the bar weren't even busy. Eventually, the hostess blamed the hostess before her and sat us. Then, our server, Joey, continued the bad customer service and was not attentive, not friendly, and definitely did not want to be at work. We waited for about 20 minutes before our orders were even taken. The manager needs to be aware of what is happening in their store. The customer service is so poor. The hostess and server were unpleasant. We have never received such horrible service."
Manuel A.,"Salinas, CA",1,13,6,5.0,7/24/2017,This visit was awesome. Wednesday is my favorite day to visit BJ's. $10 burgers and never ending fries.  Service was great and food was good.  If your hankering for fries and a good burger this is a great option.
Janet D.,"Monterey, CA",17,43,,3.0,8/19/2017,"Our ""Dine Out Seniors"" group met for lunch here again.  we had about 20 members who enjoyed the food.  However, I was disappointed with the service.  I told the waitress we had two birthdays to celebrate.  I gave her the names of the two women and she dutifully wrote them down.  They give a Paluka chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for your birthday and I also ordered one for me just to eat for dessert.  However, the girl asked who had a cookie and I raised my hand.  Then, she asked who had a birthday and she just dumped the cookie on her and did not give the other girl hers and did not bother to sing ""Happy Birthday""  The food is good and the beer tasting great, but not a good place to celebrate your birthday!"
Trisha D.,"Salinas, CA",11,16,1,4.0,9/9/2017,This place is my favorite place to eat in salinas. The only compliant i have is with managment. I asked a question to a manager name Filiberto i expected he knew everything about the food instead he was very sarcastic and didn't even speak english well. Maybe bjs should pay for English classes and courses in customer service this guy obviously dont know his job well. Other then that the food is always great.
Bryan T.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,1,1.0,7/21/2017,"I've been to this restaurant several times, and everytime I go the wait and service is terrible. I get seated and handed a menu and the waiter leaves. I look through the menu for a couple of minutes before I know what I'd like to order and then comes the waiting game.  I close my menu and place it off to the side to show I'm ready to order, but the waiters don't even bat an eye. It's supposed to be the waiters job to come to see if your ready to order not for you to call on them. After about 15 minutes of just waiting we finally get our order taken and the next waiting game begins. It takes a good 20-30 minutes before food comes out and its not even at the same time, orders are taken out at different times so people end up having to wait and watch their friends/family eat before they get their food. They also don't refill glasses of water unless asked to. This place is terrible and I'm surprised I even went a 4th or 5th time considerong the streak of bad luck I've had at this place. Overpriced for mediocre food and terrible service. I'm better off getting some BJs worth my money elsewhere if you know what I mean. If I could give this place a 0/5 stars I would, but I can't so I won't. This place is definitely a terrible blowjob."
J L.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/25/2017,"I do not know if it has improved any since a year or so ago, but my goodness... the worst customer service I had seen in my life. Eons would go by and the wait staff was missing in action. During my last experience, during the first hour we got a table and got drinks started. We waited a good while for someone to take our order, but that came in the second hour. I also remember watching a family get their order. They were pissed. Not only was the order incorrect/not to their specifications, they had waited as long as we had for something to happen. Honestly, at that point, I vowed I was not going to go back. Spend your money and time somewhere better."
Brent P.,"Somerset, KY",1,146,69,5.0,3/6/2016,"Seating is fast, the server was at my table within 3 minuets and very knowledgeable and helpful.  In 20 years of traveling, this is one of the nicest places I've eaten at. I'd give them 5 stars just for the atmosphere they have cultivated here.   The Gluten Free pizza is great!! Would never have known it was gluten free !!  I will definitely be back when I'm in Salinas again!!! For those of you that drink, they have a very large selection to choose from."
Dominic A.,"Salinas, CA",0,9,4,1.0,9/7/2017,This place has been a blunder since day one...I mean looks like corporate tries to keep the menu looking good but the staff does not perform what BJs is trying to do at least at this Salinas location ... Management at this location needs to hire people who care....
Tammy B.,"Santa Paula, CA",34,6,2,5.0,9/4/2017,Great lunch with family who lives in Salinas. Fast friendly service. Great tadting food. Will be back!
Olina L.,"San Jose, CA",0,30,24,3.0,10/26/2016,"We was here at the bar today for happy hour, had a beer, pizza, and fried artichoke. Unfortunately we didn't get the happy hour price (bar tender promised 50% discount for pizza). And we don't liked the artichokes (and refuse to eat it),  but artichokes was in the final check :(  Overall the food and beer is always tasty at this place"
JR F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/18/2017,"My fiancé and I came in on Sunday August 13th for dinner around 5:30. As we were standing by the host stand waiting for a table, my fiancé fainted as a result of a health issue. I was able to lay her down on the floor and bring her back to consciousness. After a few minutes, I was able to help her up and we made our way for the door. During this whole incident, not one person came to ask if we were ok or if we needed help. As we were headed out the door so I could drive her to the Emergency Room, I was struggling to hold her up and juggle my car keys, our wallets, and sunglasses. Still, no one did anything to assist, including employees or anyone sitting/standing in the crowded waiting room.  I am incredibly saddened and disappointed by the complete lack of concern and compassion exhibited by BJ's employees during this medical emergency. I have spoken with the GM who assured me that that's not how he trains his employees and that corporate will be calling me to send me a gift card (as if that will make up for the gross negligence and disregard demonstrated by employees). Still no call almost a week later. Needless to say, we won't be going back to this restaurant."
S S.,"Monterey, CA",0,13,3,1.0,4/24/2017,"Such a great blue atmosphere outside, until you walk through that giant revolving door. That's when things become a circus. We called ahead on Sunday afternoon(about 40 minutes ahead of arrival time) We tell the hostess on duty that we called ahead and our name is (Blaah Blaah) She said it would be about 10 to 15 minutes. Now we are a group of 5, two young children, and three adults. Twenty five minutes and we are still waiting(standing) no room to sit in the lobby area. I could swear I saw a monkey juggling menus on the take out kiosk , but it was just me hallucinating from a lack of food.   I approach the desk again and ask if there is a problem with seating us. The hostess says you are a group of 5 , 2 to 4 people are easier than 5 and up. Ok fair enough, about ten minutes later we get seated.  This is when the fun starts. We sit for about 15 more minutes and finally get our drink orders taken. Ten minutes pass, water comes, ten minutes later the rest of the drinks arrive.  We finally order in about another 25 minutes.  Seems at this point that we should have just said we want the check and go over to Red Lobster, but we were begging for more circus acts. Act two(or three, lost count) takes place when one of two appetizers arrives. Why is there only one? where the heck did the other one go? Again the picture of that juggling monkey popped into my head eating our stuffed mushrooms.  So when four people order we should have four plates arrive at once, right? wrong again, one plate gets out first, then another , then another, with gaps of time between them. I'm not making this up, it's just unreal.(like the monkey) The food was not prepared correctly , I should have been back there cooking. Better yet my three year old daughter could whip something up. It really couldn't get worse, but then again this is BJ's sooo... in one of the dishes there was a long piece of twine(string) on the pizza. We told the waitress about it, showed her, and well the management never arrived to smooth things over, nothing.  As we left the establishment the Monkey offered me his left over banana peel. We will not be returning until the next ice age. Sucked!"
Ernie R.,"Salinas, CA",7,69,2,1.0,6/5/2017,"This is directed at Mrs. Celeste Page, don't know if she is still the store manager? After several months from our last visit we wanted to give BJ's an opportunity to make some corrections. I understand running a business is difficult. So by now changes must have taken place. We are starting with 5 stars this evening. We were greeted by Patric very welcoming and felt genuine we were told we had a 5 min. Wait. So far so good. THEN! We ordered. The server put in the wrong order for one of my daughters. Then my double bone pork chop was a wreck. Dry brittle and way way over cooked. The minute something went wrong Patric disappeared. The expediter made no excuses. Michael the manager came to the table and apologizes 15 min later. He offered to make it right and feed me. By then the mood had changed and it was over. Sorry BJ's for the one star but we have tried time and time again."
Walter S.,"Carolina, Puerto Rico",6,20,14,5.0,5/23/2017,"This place won't break the bank, and you can eat healthy too. We had the seared ahi salad, with a dressing that had just the right tartness to complement the meat. The chicken tortilla soup was hearty, and the beef brisket burger had a wonderful hickory flavor, (best without the mayonnaise.) I had Merusso Moscatto wine--all agreed it had just the right sweetness. It was Tuesday so their signature dessert, the cookie with ice cream and wine were both half off.  I will go back as soon as we get the chance."
Adrienne B.,"Salinas, CA",64,2,,1.0,6/8/2017,"The food is always good... But if you have a party of more than 4, the service usually sucks !! The restaurant is not even busy & the waitress is nowhere to be found. You have to wait FOREVER for your drinks & they bring your salad & food at the same time... Then maybe you'll get your drink a half hour later after you've asked 5 times !!"
Michael M.,"Waimanalo, HI",0,5,,1.0,10/27/2017,"Wow. What a TERRIBLE experience. We love BJs and come here often but today was the absolute worst time here and honestly one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. We arrived around 2PM. Our server, Tammy, spent about 10 minutes walking around doing other things before even acknowledging our presence. When she finally did, she came across as curt and hurried, like we were a bother and interruption to her day. Regardless, we put in our order for an appetizer and food, with the intent to get dessert after as well. After bringing it out we asked for a side of ranch to eat our wings with. We watched out server walk around, cleaning tables chatting with the manager (who also needs a refresher in customer service because he is terrible as well) and doing completely irrelevant tasks while our table and the ONE other table this server had sat neglected. We say without drink refills for this entire time as well. After we asked AGAIN for the ranch she finally brought it and our wings were freezing. It had been over 15 minutes. HORRIBLE lunch service. She was much more concerned with cleaning tables than she was serving the ones she was assigned to. And the manger. What a joke. He did nothing but walked around cleaning tables and chit chatting with the same table over and over. We made eye contact multiple times and our entire table looked PISSED and he did nothing. Not difficult to see why the wait staff is terrible when they have an equally terrible lead of service. We ended up not getting dessert because we knew it would take forever and at this point we were so upset. There are so many negative reviews regarding lunch time. You would think the owners would step in and make some change. Guess they are fine with losing business and loyal customers. Save your time and money. Eat elsewhere. Chipotle will cost half the money and at least they'll serve it with a smile."
A B.,"Soledad, CA",0,25,40,4.0,2/25/2017,"Went to BJs today, and had The avocado eggrolls appetizer. The appetizer was good except I would not recommend the soy sauce dip. Instead of the soy sauce dip we got ranch dip, and which made the eggrolls taste better. My dinner plate was the jumble meat balls  spaghetti plate. This plate was delicious and my friends have ham and cheese grilled sandwiches which they enjoyed with honey mustard. Staff there were very friendly.  I will go again."
Sean M.,"Corona, CA",0,37,2,5.0,5/10/2017,50% off large pizzas on Monday is a killer deal!!! It's my Monday go to when I'm on the road traveling for work. I love the spinach/artichoke pizza. It's no longer on the menu but they still make it for you if you ask. Food for thought!!!
Alison J.,"Santa Maria, CA",98,4,4,5.0,5/23/2016,"I have always been impressed with the BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse chain but this particular one located in Salinas really blew my mind. Upon entrance we were immediately greeted with a warm & genuine smile from the hostess who promptly seated us to our booth. Then our waitress came by and introduced herself and informed us of any specials and took our drink order. The food arrived promptly, the drinks were delicious, but most importantly (for me) the service was professional and the bathrooms and restaurant was sparkling clean!! We will definitely make this a solid food stop for us when traveling!!"
Robert S.,"Enola, PA",45,8,3,2.0,12/28/2016,"So where to start!!??  I rarely ever will give such a low rating but after the experience we had this time around, I feel it is warranted.  Day after Christmas, everyone is out for sales, and returns, you would think I big chain like this would be staffed for the occasion.  WRONG!  Called ahead 40 minutes prior, arrived to wait another 40 minutes, 20 of which there was not even a hostess present at the front of the house. After our total of almost an hour and a half wait, we were seated, only to wait 15 minutes to even see a waiter. 15 minutes later and we still have no drinks. Which is odd because they were maybe 50% capacity seated, with another 30% waiting in the front to be seated.  Management proceeded to tell us they were understaffed, however seemed apologetic.  After replacing our waiter, things seemed to pick up a bit.  As for our food, the steak was good and no one in our party seemed to complain, nor be all to thrilled about the dinner.  All I will say is, the management needs to step their game up, and they need to learn to run the business effectively."
Brianna P.,"Salinas, CA",11,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,"I've ordered take out from here on numerous occasions, and almost every single time there is some issue with the payment system. Why offer to take PayPal if you can't see that it has been paid when I come to pick up the food? After my last experience I specifically said I wasn't going to come back, but Salinas really has very few options, so I was forced to come back here.  When I came to pick up my takeout today the kid working at the takeout section of course had to grab his manager immediately, who ended up making my experience worse rather than better. After showing him my receipt he poorly explained he needed to email to be forwarded. This long winded explanation basically caused my food to be cold. His attitude was rude and unfriendly, he wasn't sincere in his apologies at all and the person he was supposed to be managing was more apologetic. I didn't get his name due to the fact that he wasnt wearing a name tag (that bothered me as well).  Don't ever go here!!! I don't know if every BJs is like this but it makes me never want to be a customer of theirs again."
Nikki C.,"Salinas, CA",0,4,4,1.0,6/11/2017,Andrea on the Togo orders needs a little more training or a lesson on phone etiquette
Ruth M.,"Salinas, CA",4,20,13,4.0,6/27/2017,"the ahi tuna salad is great, with a glass of wine your good to go  one time I ordered the salad by phone and was late picking it up, they made me another one so it would be fresh. good service, the tuna salad is the best  a little pricey but what isn't."
Tonia C.,"Monterey, CA",51,108,414,4.0,10/1/2016,I want to weigh in and say the service was quick and friendly at our recent visit last week.  It looks like they've had problems in the past.  Maybe it's hit or miss but once for lunch and once for early dinner it was great.  I like the healthy options that are available.  The burger is consistently good. My favorite is the fried jalapeno.  Outdoor patio is great when the weather cooperates.  It's a chain but sometimes the consistency of a chain is just what hits the spot.
Brian P.,"San Francisco, CA",93,2,,2.0,2/24/2017,"My first review. I always read Yelp reviews, but have never written my own. Well, tonight, I finally have to weigh in and write about how bad BJ's is. This is not my first time here, and all the previous visits have been less than stellar. But tonight, this takes the cake. We started by making a reservation for 9, as we were having a birthday celebration. We found out several hours later another guest could make it, so we called to add them to our party. We were told that they could put our name in, and we could wait. REALLY?!? My daughter wasn't feeling well, so she stayed home anyway. Little did we know that she would be the winner in this whole ordeal. We arrived and were seated immediately. Half the restaurant was empty. My wife and I shrugged our shoulders, realizing it would not have been a big deal at all to add someone else to our table (and it had room).  Our waitress was pleasant, but the service was slow.  Our food finally arrived and more than half the dishes were poor. My mother-in-law ordered a chicken club sandwich, which arrived with WAY undercooked and it was obvious the food had sat out too long, as the the underside of the sandwich was soggy. My father-in-law ordered the flat bread pizza, which too, was also left out too long, as the center was soggy and the outsides of the crust were stale.  My wife had a salad, with no dressing, and since our waitress was not around, was not able to send it back. Another person's order was wrong, and another had onions on their burger, which they specifically asked not to have. Again, tough to send back, when the service is not around. When time came to pay the bill, we asked to speak to the manager. He came out and listened and he did comp the poor plates, as well as give us $40 in gift cards, so I will commend the manager on making the effort, and give this review a 2 instead of a 1 star rating.  The kitchen, however, rates a ZERO on this effort. Hope they can turn this place around, but it's been too many unpleasant experiences here."
Nate H.,"Salinas, CA",0,16,5,1.0,2/18/2017,"I'll start this off by admitting that I am an idiot. I don't know why I have given this place as many chances as I have. Every time I have been here the service has been atrocious. I swear I have seen turtles move faster than half of the servers. There is never any sense of urgency, no matter if the restaurant is busy or not. This last visit was on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was roughly 30% capacity. There was no hostess in the front. She showed up a few minutes later and so slowly  led Us to our table, I swear I almost fell asleep on the way. The food is usually ok, but I can no longer frequent an establishment that cares so little for their customers."
Jherica B.,"Pacific Grove, CA",40,1,,1.0,8/17/2016,"I was highly disappointed for not the first or second time. The THIRD Time!  Service is insanely slow. I do have to address the ultra concerned manager that finally made an effort to right the wrongs done at this establishment when we were walking out. Kudos on a ridiculous attempt to actually care at the very last minute.  We arrived at 3pm and we were seated withing 5 minutes. Unfortunately, we sat at our dirty table ( no silverware provided ) for 13 minutes without having any one greet us or take a drink order. We saw several staff members walk pass us including our supposed waiter. No one spoke to us. No one cared. When I finally flagged down a hostess to ask if we had a waiter, she replied sure, let me get your drink order. By 3:40 our drinks still did not arrive. At this point, we walked out. The manager tried to ascertain why we left. All we could say was failure to be acknowledged. I wish I could say that this was something rare at this location, but I have experienced long wait times from the staff and it never has to do with the food. It is always having to do with a waiter not realizing that someone is in their section.  Management needs to take more care to properly train their staff."
