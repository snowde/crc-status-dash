Elizabeth C.,"Salinas, CA",0,22,1,1.0,11/22/2015,"It's always sad to me when you can ruin a price of nice salmon. Service was great but the food was terrible. My boyfriend had the hamburger and only ate half and did not bother to take any home. Too much sauce. The salad has not improved since I was there two years ago. You cannot serve ice burg lettuce in Salinas, the salad capital of the world unless you are doing a wedge. I complained about it then and it's sad they still serve this bland salad. The look of the place is great, too bad the food does not match. Disappointing. Reminds me too much of TGIF."
John N.,"Goleta, CA",147,52,28,4.0,5/30/2015,"Love the Jeremiah Red Ale. Great place to relax and watch the game. I always just eat in the bar area seating, so no waiting."
Juan G.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/6/2016,"Had an awesome experience on my visit last night (6/5/2016 around 8:30pm). Our server Mikaela B. Went above and beyond on making our night out at bjs a place to have dinner with friends. She was very attentive, always smiling, and took great care of us. We will definitely be back! Thank you for making us feel at home."
B K.,"Hollister, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/5/2016,"Another fantastic visit to our ""go to"" place when we are in the area. Service was super, food was fresh, tasty and presented very well. Love this place!"
Mireya G.,"Salinas, CA",0,29,,4.0,10/27/2015,"Came in for lunch with my cousins from Vegas and was not disappointed. Service was good, and food was good too!"
Pete P.,"Monterey, CA",16,8,4,1.0,12/30/2014,"So last night I took my company staff out to a late X-mas/New Year's dinner.  We called in a reservation the week prior.  We receive a confirmation phone call the morning of and we needed to amend the number.  I show up a little early than the reservation just because that's how I am and the amended number which was 21 people never made it to the night shift.  The service was awful in basically every way.   1) No one asked who the host of the group was. 2) Half of the tables didn't have a napkin/flatware and we needed to ask. 3) It took over a half an hour for everyone to get their first drink. 4) The servers never introduced themselves. 5) One of the servers dropped an appetizer too close to a member of our group. 6) One of the servers bumped and dropped an empty beer bottle on the back of my office manager's head. 7) My drink, an old fashioned' was incorrectly made. 8) The server's didn't take our group's order in order leaving the servers to basically call out 'who had the _____'. 9) The second round of drinks took another 30 minutes for the last person of our group to get theirs. 10) The servers were unaware of our company's planned menu. 11) The servers were unaware of our company's (2) drink maximum. 12) Not even a manager came out to check on our group to make sure everything was going well. 13) In the end the server mistakenly assumed the older person of our group was the one paying.  Not the person sitting at the head of the table.  WOW! 14) The cook came out and introduced himself at the end of the dinner and gave us 2013 holiday beer glasses.  It's 2014 going to be 2015 in (2) days. At least the food was good. It is clear to me that upper management has no clue or doesn't care about the service that BJ's provides.  Let's  just call the place Shenanagin's.......  Obviously I won't be making this annual event at that establishment again.  Hope this helps Yelpers!"
Margaret G.,"San Juan Bautista, CA",0,25,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Went there today  around 2:30pm,  the food was good, but there service was just terrible. First the person who sat us was not all there, then we never got waited on until my husband went to the front and had to ask for some service. Our waitress Donna, made us feel like we were a bother. I wanted to leave but we were so hungry, it took another 12 minutes for our food to come. I'm not sure what was going on, but something was off..."
Sharon W.,"Salinas, CA",0,19,5,3.0,3/2/2015,Mixed emotions. 3 times I've been here first two waited forever. However most recent I had an excellent server she checked back often. Wish I got her name she was great.
Cindii F.,"Salinas, CA",134,23,,2.0,3/31/2015,"I have to give this place a 2 star review for two reasons; food isn't great here every single time I've been here there's always something wrong with my order, either it's cold or doesn't not taste good. Second, service is HORRIBLE! last time I came here I waited like 20 min for my waitress to bring my bill and another 20 min for her to pick it up...not to mention I never had a refill on my drink... Seems like they don't really care for tips the way they work there"
Alissa M.,"Salinas, CA",138,3,,1.0,7/17/2015,"I've had multiple bad experiences here recently. The sad thing is that it started out so great! Maybe the owners/management have changed because it's going on a steep decline! In the past 6 months a waitress has spilled water into my Kate spade purse off of her serving tray and then laughed & walked away. I've received a burger where the center was cold. The side salad looked like it had been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be served for days, droopy gross lettuce, I got the Cajun pasta that had teeny tiny slivers of chicken, and I've also received stale cold fries. I hope that a manager/owner reads this bc they're doing a terrible job and they need to get their butt back in gear."
Melissa B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,15,,2.0,8/14/2015,"The food here was okay. Menu is huge, but it's so big that it's kind of hard to figure out what to have. Service was sooo slow. At one point, our server went on break, introduced us to another server, and then we never saw that server again. Verily, the original server came back. I think we were there for over two hours!! Way too long for a casual restaurant that was only because service was slow. Thought we would never get to pay. The cookie desserts are really yummy. Too bad it takes so long to get. We won't go back."
Haylee B.,"Salinas, CA",4,24,5,2.0,3/22/2016,"My family and I came here on st. Patrick's Day. We were not offered drinks for almost 10 minutes, we ordered everything at once because we were very hungry and we had 10 minutes to think about it already. We received our appetizers 15 minutes later, my wife had ordered a dark and stormy that the bartenders had no clue how to make. She received a pint glass filled with rum and an alcoholic ginger beer on the side like a make your own cocktail!!! We waited over an hour for our meals and still nothing! We got a peak at the manager as he interacted with only one table within our view. But sadly be never came to check on us. We asked our server if our food was ready if so we were going to take it Togo. She came back and let us know that it was not, so we paid for our appetizers and drinks and left HUNGRY AND UPSET. We did get a chance to speak to the manager on our way out and he offered and I'm sorry."
Wendy B.,"Monterey, CA",484,113,423,1.0,11/24/2014,"Our waitress had a few table she has just started her area we were her first table, she seemed really unhappy didn't smile, short, unprofessional, she was rude. Not friendly it made my friends and I feel like we should leave. It was very uncomfortable and we didn't enjoy our food. At the end she give us a bill that was over by almost $100.00 when we told her it was not ours she give us attitude and walked off. It was my friends birthday and they brought us dessert when we were almost leaving. This is my four time here and every time they get something wrong.  Bad customer service, the management team as well. Great location and potential it's sad to go to waste."
Philip H.,"Salinas, CA",97,2,,4.0,9/27/2015,"Was a slow night and our starting waitress was not too great and messed our order up. But we got a free appetizer, and the waiter that took over was fantastic, thank you Robert, you were extremely helpful and kind"
Carmella W.,"Salinas, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/19/2016,"I've eaten at this location on 4 different occasions and every time it was the same thing--HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The staff had been bad since the day it opened. Also, the food doesn't seem as good as other BJ's locations."
Joseph S.,"Monterey, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/20/2015,"My drink wasn't filled up on time like it should have been.  I had root beer and I had to ask for a refill.  Plus at the end, I told the waitress that the bill was ready and good and she assumed I was giving her a $16 tip on a $59 bill.  It made no sense.  She went on break and I asked someone to check on my change but no one returned.  I love eating at BJs and I wasn't pleased at all.  The server should have left the receipt with the change instead of assuming we were done.  I don't think I want to return to this BJs in the future.   I didn't bother escalating to a manager because of how time consuming it would have been with how busy they were."
Eric L.,"Salinas, CA",0,17,,5.0,5/16/2016,This place is great. If you go to the seated areas or the bar area the service is great. We had a server named Spencer who was very polite and professional and knowledgable on every menu item. We had seen him cover many tables constantly checking up on refills and requests for extra napkins and condiments the other tables were wanting on a very busy Saturday night. The bar tenders worked well together covering for each other's areas when the other was busy. There was no issue requesting to change one corner of the massive tv to a different game. All around this restaurant has become the go to spot for my friends and family to go. I'd recommend this to everyone. The beers there are amazing and I've never had ridiculous wait times to be seated on any day or night.
Tammy B.,"Salinas, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/8/2016,"the waiter was so very nice and helpful....he deserved a raise for how much he put forth the extra mile to service...was very please by his service ****** BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse 1730 N Main St, Salinas, CA, 93906"
Ruth H.,"Salinas, CA",25,18,,1.0,2/27/2015,"I've dropped them from two stars to one star, I had hoped that after six months or so things would have improved; sadly they haven't.  Tonight, in addition to slow service and oblivious servers, we had incomplete meals served to us. The kitchen should know what goes on a meal's plate, and both of our entrees were missing key components. The kitchen missed the mashed potatoes on my dinner, and the horseradish sauce for my husband's French Dip. The server who delivered our meals was not our original server, and not only was oblivious to the incomplete plates; he did the drop and vanish approach to serving. It took several minutes to get a server's attention, and finally our server came over to see what we needed; we explained about the missing components and she took our plates back to fix them. When they were brought back, the main part of the meal was lukewarm, the only item served at the proper temperature was my mashed potatoes. And to add insult to injury, the music was so loud, we had to shout at each other over the table just to be heard.  I'm so disappointed in this particular location. I've had better experiences at other BJ's locations, but I'm not driving two hours just for BJ's, Salinas has plenty of other alternatives."
Robert H.,"San Jose, CA",89,16,15,5.0,5/8/2015,"My fiancé and I brought both our mothers here to celebrate an early mother day. We had an over 40 minute wait for our food and they got the salad wrong. The reason I am giving 5 stars is because the manager Michael was very apologetic the server Jeremy was very accommodating and they more than made up for the mistake. They were very kind and know what it takes to make up for a mistake and make things right. I highly recommend this BJ's to anyone. Once the order was correct, the food was excellent. Definitely will be back."
