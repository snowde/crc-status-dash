Lynnice P.,"Sausalito, CA",112,1,1,1.0,8/29/2015,"Don't eat here. My family and I came around 9pm and it took 15 minutes to be sat - not that bad. Once we sat down we ordered the ahi poke which was basically saturated in soy sauce and it looked like they chopped up avocados and threw them on the plate. We also ordered their Hawaiian mahi mahi and jambalaya. The food took awhile and when it finally came it was extremely dried out, bland and smelled like fish. I returned the food because it was inedible. Worst experience I've ever had at BJs and am thankful I don't live in the area."
Alberto V.,"Salinas, CA",6,116,149,2.0,9/14/2014,"The food is great and the beer selection is large. However, the service is beyond terrible. As a matter of fact to be honest there is no service.  Went in last night for a quick beer and a few appetizers. To begin with there was no one in front to seat us. When someone did appear they simply peeked their head from a corner to say I'll be right with you. He went along side to where I could see through the window the entire waiting staff hanging out in the patio area.  Once he did return to take us to a table he basically ran to the table as my girl and I walked behind him. He had a huge smile on his face as he said your waiter will be right with you. Of course he went back to the patio.  From the moment we sat down we had many servers pass us by not even aknowledging us. Wouldn't even look at us or the couple behind us nor the large group next to us. About fifteen minuetes later we simple gave up and walked out. The two tabels next to us murmuring look they're walking out. Maybe we should leave too.  Pathetic service! and I should add it was relatively empty with the exception of the bar."
Veronica H.,"Sacramento, CA",33,34,57,5.0,12/26/2014,"I wanted to visit this BJ's a couple of more times before writing my review. I have to say that our first visit was below standards but it was to be expected for a very busy Friday night. Nonetheless, that does not excuse bad service.  For my second visit, I'd say it was a much better experience and they deserve every star because of our server Adam. Adam was the epitome of a fantastic server/waiter! He was attentive, friendly and genuinely happy!  My friend and I dined here for lunch. We order the artichoke appetizer and it was delicious - the only suggestion I'd make is possible replacing the chips with baked bread.  I ordered the Cajun Pasta with Blackened chicken and it was delicious! I ate my entire plate... It was yummy!! My friend ordered the Parmesan crusted sandwich with potato wedges and he loved it just as much as he loved the dinner dish which is served with veggies and mashed potatoes.  Surprisingly we still had room for desert! At the recommendation of Adam, we had the Oreo Pazookie and Salted Caramel Pazookie! Good lord it was heaven in the form of dessert! I am not exaggerating either.  I can't wait to go back and I will def request for Adam's section... You should too!"
Carolyne Z.,"Royal Oaks, CA",56,3,,1.0,9/5/2016,"If there was negative stars they would get it. We were sat outside by 1:35. Three employees came out to pet a dog at a table near us (who already had food) we were never acknowledged. My husband went in to request service. Although we were given menus by the hostess, we finally left at 2:10 with no water, no service, no acknowledgement. THIS BJ'S NEEDS NEW MANAGEMENT IMMEDIATELY!!!!"
David V.,"Salinas, CA",2,8,14,2.0,8/6/2016,"Keep getting inaccurate inconsistent service, and keep hearing the same reviews from various friends. Sad, BJ's could be a great place. Stopped going. Headed next door"
Sera H.,"Salinas, CA",0,17,4,5.0,7/18/2016,"We have been hesitant to try this place again.  We went to the opening a few years ago & I got sick from one of the ales I tried. I think I was allergic to it. Also, we've been watching the Yelp rating, which has been really low for a while. But hubby & I decided we'd give it a chance for lunch today. We were v. surprised at what a great restaurant it is! I repeat that it was lunchtime, so the place was empty. That might have something to do with the prices (hint: lower the prices for lunch so you can beef up your lunch crowd). We wwere seated in 2 min. Hubby had a pulled pork sandwich, I had a HUGE salad. Both were excellent, just super great. I had to take 1/2 the salad home (there was so much of it--and it was hummy.)   Our waitress, Ariana, was also super great. We had fun talking to her and service was impeccable, very professional.  The whole experience has made us want to go back and try more dishes off the menu.  But I think we'll avoid the drinking crowd and just come at  lunch time."
Mike C.,"Monterey, CA",7,82,21,3.0,6/27/2016,The appetizers have not been good. Had Brussel sprouts and fried portobello mushrooms.  Both were not very good. Sent Brussel sprouts back at first they were burnt. The second batch was under cooked.  Ordered margarita flat bread to try that.  Flat bread was good.  I choose the salmon grilled and it was nicely cooked and the veggies it came with el Dante and were perfect. My mum had the watermelon salad with grilled chicken.  The salad was good but the watermelon was old.  Over all the salad was good.  My son had Mac and cheese and he loved it.
Travis N.,"Salinas, CA",11,49,3,1.0,7/19/2015,"After moving to California two years ago.. this place has the worst service I have experienced in California.  The only ones that are good are the bartenders.   Last time I went with a friend and sat for over 20 minutes before a server even came to our table.  I think nearly every server in the building walked by, looked at us and didn't bother talking to us or asking us if we wanted to get drinks.   The only reason people go here from what I am assuming is the good food and bartending staff.  Jeremy rocks it at the bar and hands down is 100% better than any other wait staff in this place.  Each time I come and have a bad experience the manager is just standing around not paying attention to anything.   Avoid at all costs unless you sit at the bar."
Robert F.,"Salinas, CA",67,1,,3.0,9/10/2016,"3 stars just for the flavor and overall food. Other then that took a few Minutes to be seated in an almost empty restaurant, food took more then 15 minutes for a sandwich. Will be back but only during the NFL games when the the prices match the service."
Andy O.,"Prunedale, CA",48,18,7,5.0,11/19/2015,"Wife went with daughter, and mom who are picky orderers (glutten free, dressing on the side, etc), and apparently BJs hit it out of the park. Wife  has been raving about how good the pizza was and how nice the service was for days. I haven't even eaten here and I'm giving them 5-stars. Will visit again at the next Stone event."
Prim P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",41,29,7,2.0,6/21/2015,"2 1/2 stars. The food was decent but the service kinda blew.  My parents and I came here on Father's Day. We were shown a booth but my dad wanted one closer to a tv so he could watch whatever sport was on and so we moved. We waited for at least 10 minutes and no server came by to say anything to us. A huge party was seated at the same time as us so I thought our server was one of the ones helping with them, but that wasn't the case. After more than 15 minutes, I stopped a busser and asked if he could find our server. The busser got the general manager and he took our order because he had no idea who our server was. Um, okay. I then watched him enter our order in the computer and less than 2 minutes after he was done, our appetizer arrived at our table. Whaaaat? Turns out that the appetizer was meant for another table. Nice. The girl that dropped it off then asked if we wanted real menus. Uh, we already ordered. Anyhow, our real server was finally found and her excuse was that she was new. I don't even know what that means. I think no one was assigned to that table we were at and she was just given the table to cover, but that's just me. Get your shiii together, BJ's."
Rubin M.,"Salinas, CA",1,10,5,1.0,4/8/2016,We have been waiting for our food for more then 30 minutes. We haven't even been served our appetizers. Our waitress hasn't even come to check on us or give us an estimated wait time.
Jessica A.,"Burbank, CA",6,12,3,1.0,1/4/2017,Where to start... so we decided to give Another try no improvement AT ALL!!!! Food was not good again! The previous time we came to this place we found a hair on our dessert. N today I ordered a coffee it took them literally 15min to bring it well I didn't get a spoon or Cramer n FYI I did ask for them like 3times n nothing plus they never brought my husband a refill i gave up on the spoon n Creamer I had to get up n go to the bar n get a glass of water. What a waste of money. People don't waste ur time or money here I rather go drive thru. I wish I could give them no stars!!!!!
Susan U.,"Los Angeles, CA",501,782,1965,2.0,7/13/2014,"I was never a fan of the place but since it was the meeting spot for an after-race party, I had to go. So I ordered avocado rolls and black and bleu-house burger. The rolls were tasty but the burger was very bland. Low quality. I had a glass of beer. I only enjoyed this drinking part. Well, the other star was for the personable staff.  BJ isn't my type of place to eat."
MIGUEL S.,"King City, CA",97,7,3,1.0,10/17/2016,"Bj brew house what can I say their manager Jessie is piece of work after sitting at the restaurant for over an hour waiting on simple Appertierz then after I complained I asked to cancel order the manger still had the nerve to charge us for full price of the appetizer that I did get. Which was some mushrooms which I clung to life to!!! Because I felt so hungry from waiting for so long. But I do admit the wait staff did awesome Job, it just back end & management where the problems are happening ....now to top it off as we were leaving the waitress stoped by to apologize for what had happen with the delay in our order and then proceeds to hand us our bill AGAIN saying ""I noticed the manager only charged you for the one appetizer & ice tea but canceled the rest of your order that didn't come...so here's your bill"" by now I'm more than irritated because I had already paid the measly tab which was roughly $10 and we gave $20 directly to the manager and told him to give our waitress the change for her tip! So if she's saying our bill was never closed out...where did the $20 go we gave to the manager???"
Jennifer L.,"Modesto, CA",67,82,29,4.0,5/18/2016,"Great brews, food and people.  Had a wonderful time watching the Warriors game and great conversation.  I have always loved BJ's and I'm so glad the one in Salinas didn't disappoint."
G M.,"Cupertino, CA",2,38,164,2.0,4/20/2014,"Mediocre! 'Nuff said! Kale & Brussels sprouts salad : where's the Brussels sprouts? Where's the cheese? ... It's Salinas for goodness sake..(hello!Farm Town!) BJ should have special Salinas menu! Such as The Steinbeck burger, mojito Monterey, etc. to set themselves apart from the other BJ Brewery/Rest. Oh & by the way: Food took so long to come out my kid fell asleep! Even my beer came out late! This was after the big crowd left, & after the evening rush hour!  Big restaurants are popping everywhere, the charm of Salinas is getting lost in the background. It's better to clean up Salinas & update the buildings & parking lots, but keep the charm.."
Kathleen G.,"Salinas, CA",0,12,2,4.0,12/11/2016,"Great choices, waiter! Love the ambiance. Has a really cool vibe. Casual but a bit more upscale than going to Applebee's?"
Ashleyann B.,"Honolulu, HI",159,5,,3.0,1/22/2017,"We have eaten at many of these chain locations in the past, and always had amazing service. This time though, was a little different. Drinks took quite a while to get to the table. Appetizer came out with only four plates, even though there were six of us at the table. When our food came out, everyone's arrived at the table but our birthday girl's food. I waited exactly five minutes before tracking down another server, and alerting her to the situation. When our server arrived back at our table she explained that her food was taking longer because the smiley face fries weren't done cooking yet, and said it in a tone as if we should have already known that. Why on earth would you deliver the adult food before the kids?!!  Another 3 minutes passed before we received her food. I'm sorry, 8 minutes between delivery for a child's food (on their birthday no less), is 8.5 minutes too long. This whole time there wasn't a single apology. Once everyone finally had their food, we dug in to our now cold food. My hubby realized that his Brussels sprout salad was lacking Brussel sprouts! We waited another 4 minutes for our server to check back, and she fetched us the sprouts. By the time they were added to the salad he was already half done. Sorely disappointed with our decision to chose this location to celebrate my kiddo's special day. We won't be back."
Dawn S.,"Salinas, CA",29,90,252,3.0,9/10/2015,The food is good. The service leaves a little bit to be desired.  Happy hour is well worth the money. We were satisfied with our sandwich and burger. It's football season so if you wantt to watch the game in a social setting and you aren't in a hurry at all this may be the place for you.
