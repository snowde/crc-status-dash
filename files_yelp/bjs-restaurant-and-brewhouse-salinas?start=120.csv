Kyung B.,"Monrovia, CA",216,223,776,3.0,4/22/2013,"This place is great during the evenings and has a lively middle age crowd.  The food is tasty but a tad costly.  We had Andy as our server (great service!). The one thing i LOVED the most about this restaurant was the calorie count it had next to all their items.  LOVED to know the fact but so saaaaad to not be ordering a 1,200 calorie meal like i was initially planning.  I had the single person calzone.  Super delish and healthy(ier than the other items) but it was made with white sauce instead of red tomato sauce.  I think the calorie count on that was 590?  or something like that. we also got the 8 glass beer tasting.  the darker beers (stouts) seem ""flat"" but it's because they make it with nitrogen so that it's ""smoother"".  I liked all the light lagers and beers except the IPA but that's cause i don't like IPAs to begin with. my husband liked best of all that they had the phillies game playing on one tv and a poker tournament on another. :)"
Harryette O.,"Cypress, CA",146,46,14,3.0,6/21/2016,"The food is pretty good, and the servers are kind. The problem is, they are slow. The food is slow in coming to the table, and the servers make minimal visits to the table. The atmosphere is fun and festive."
Jennifer D.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",81,5,,5.0,5/24/2016,"Had a great experience here on a Monday lunch. The bartender was super sweet and recommended the new mobile app, in which I got an appetizer for something like $.20??!! Food was spot on too! Thanks BJS salinas!"
Ray A.,"Salinas, CA",12,6,,3.0,7/19/2016,"Food is good, service is below average. Waiters are slow and sometimes seems like they forget all about you, but at the end of the day, I come for the good food."
Jason P.,"Monterey County, CA",58,71,54,3.0,3/16/2016,"I'm giving this particular location a 3 star review. Last night my wife and I came to this BJ's for dinner, it's been one of our favorite places to go since we lived in Texas. We've always loved the atmosphere and the great food selection, paired with great service.  I can't say that those things lined up for us last night. Our waitress seemed a little frazzled, and maybe had too many tables on her plate. It took a good 10min before we even got a drink order in. Re fills came few far and in between.  When we finally got our food, it was ok. I was really too hungry to be picky at that point, but my wife's pasta was under cooked and not very good. I ordered the jambalaya, which is my favorite dish at every BJ's. My food wasn't bad at all. I think the only issue I had with mine is I think it was a little over seasoned. We needed with a salted caramel pizzokie. That wasn't too bad.  Again, BJ's is usually our favorite place to go, from Texas to Washington state it's been amazing. I'm just not a fan of the customer service at this location. I'm not sure if this will inhibit me from coming back again, but I guess we will see."
Oralia G.,"Salinas, CA",1,11,,3.0,4/18/2016,"I visited this restaurant for a friend's birthday last week. First server did great she was a delight but she left around 10pm next server was not as good.Food was good.What bothered me the most though was there was a pizza being brought over to my table and the guy who was bringing it over dropped the plate on me. It was small and none of the actual pizza fell on me but the metal part of it did. It was very painful he somewhat cleaned up his mess he left it very slippery, and the replacement pizza wasn't brought out until maybe an hour later after the server was reminded. I do believe it was accidental but i did bruise it was very upsetting i didn't want to ruin my friends birthday so i didnt want to fuss. I wish the guy who dropped it would have cleaned up his mess better and maybe just check on me. Accidents happen but this one could have been handled better."
Jessica G.,"Cottonwood, CA",33,70,16,2.0,3/19/2016,Went here last night with my husband and my sister and her boyfriend. They arrived before us and got their name on the list and we're told 15 to 20 minutes. At 45 minutes they started handing out free slices of pizza. The total wait ended up being an hour. Our server was on the refills but the food was cold and not too good. Overly priced for the long wait and gross food.
Andrew N.,"Salinas, CA",120,85,124,5.0,8/15/2015,"The appetizer menu is my favorite here as well as deep dish pizzas. Mac and cheese margarita flat bread, and pot stickers are tops for me. Beer menu is wide and some of their seasonal beers are really good."
Ken P.,"Livermore, CA",0,259,1,2.0,11/7/2016,"I swore I would never go back to any BJ restaurants, as the service in Dublin was so bad I just gave up. Unfortunately, my wife picked BJ's for her B.D. dinner in Salinas where her family lives. The sad truth? The food is actually pretty good. I had the spicy chicken soba noodles, my wife and daughter picked salads, my bro-in law and father in law had hamburgers that looked good. So what's the problem?  The service is bad enough not to go back. We showed up on Saturday morning at 11:30 and the place was empty. We had 8 in our party and asked to sit outside. They looked at each other like we asked for a red carpet entrance. They finally let us, but it took 15 minutes to move a table over! Then it took another 15 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order. Then another 15 to get the drinks. We spent 2 hours there, it was ridiculous. At one point our waitress was talking with a family outside for about 10 minutes: laughing and having a good old time, while we all waited.  Unfortunately this location falls under the same rating as Dublin. 2 stars for the food and beer. Look at the reviews from all BJ locations: same old story. Wake up owners! Mismanagement throughout the company , get some training and accountability and you may move up a star or two."
Robin O.,"Visalia, CA",39,69,53,1.0,2/15/2016,"Hands down the worst BJs I have ever been to. Ordered the Roast Beef Dip with skinny fries and a side salad. The food came out literally 5 minutes later. No salad. I said wow that was fast and the server says yeah, they messed up on someone else's that ordered the same thing so you got their food. Gross! And the salad came behind. Fries were stone cold and the bread was hard as a rock. I complained politely, no discount or apology. Just an $18 tab. Won't be back."
Janeese D.,"Salinas, CA",5,11,,1.0,6/29/2016,"We stopped going.   We tried multiple times, but we never were served food that was hot or even warm.   The flavors are good, but who wants to eat old or stale french fries.  I guess their kitchen is way too far away from the tables or something goes wrong with putting different plates out to the same table and having the food served fresh.  Anyway, they don't have it down at all."
Lisa N.,"Vacaville, CA",42,33,45,5.0,4/14/2016,"I've been to a few BJ's restaurants, this by far is the best! They don't overcrowd with so many tables & they don't blast with loud music  we actually enjoyed our dinner & conversation! I think all the BJ's (and all other restaurants) should follow this model of the Salinas BJ's! Thank you for a great night!"
Katt M.,"Salinas, CA",1,19,5,4.0,8/16/2015,"I hadn't  been to BJ's since they opened a few years back. I wasn't impressed then. My family decided to give it a try today. My son had the BBQ brisket burger with bacon. He loved it. He got the thin cut fries which we all stole from his plate. My husband got the California flatbread. It's too big to eat it all, especially after eating stolen fries. We also got the fried artichoke appetizer. The aioli sauce was good. We liked the breading on the outside, but the inside artichoke was soft. We are accustomed to fresh artichokes in this area, still it was good for a change. I got the chicken wings appetizer for my meal. I liked that there was no breading on them. I got the extra hot sauce for them, which I thought was only mild, but I liked it. Also their BBQ sauce. Couldn't eat it all. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I must say, though, that the most memorable thing about our visit was the excellent service we received from our waiter, Adonis. He was extra friendly and helpful and was always there when we needed something.  There is a great club/discount promotion going on now. We saved 20% off the bill by paying on my phone. Easy to sign up. Good future discounts.  Make sure you tip based on the full amount. There was a suggested tip based on 18% of the discounted price. It's easy to change.  We will definitely be returning."
Sharon R.,"Hollister, CA",28,16,,1.0,12/23/2014,"My husband and I have been to this location several times, for the food, NEVER the service, which is why we will never go to this location ever again. Here's a typical dining experience: Arrive at restaurant, wait up to 5 min to be seated. Once seated, wait a minimum of 5 minutes for server to greet you (longest was nearly 20 minutes). Order drinks, wait a minimum of 10 minutes for drinks to arrive. Ready to order? If you asked your server to give you a minute please expect to wait at least 5-10 minutes. Food is ordered, wait a minimum of 30-40 minutes for your meal to arrive.  Thirsty? Or did you drink your entire beverage? Good luck getting a refill. Feel free to track down a server (or your own) and tell them to bring you another - asking results in a forgotten refill. Food finally arrives! Tastes amazing! It's consumed within 5 minutes...Still thirsty though. Finished eating, wait a minimum of 20 minutes for check to arrive. Ready to pay, wait a minimum of 10 minutes for card to come back so you can tip (if you think they deserve anything), and get the heck out of there! Overall time spent in restaurant: 1hr and 30 minutes.  This is the shortest amount of time we've spent in this BJ's. Our longest experience was over 2hrs. Yes the food is good, but it's not worth the wait/service this BJ's location has to offer. And please note that during none of our visits has a manager apologized for their staff or the wait time of food/drinks, despite our complaints.We could drive to the San Jose location in the same amount of time for a MUCH better experience in less time."
Roxy D.,"Salinas, CA",7,19,19,3.0,5/3/2015,I had just given up on this place  but decided to come for brunch since we had a voucher from the manager (due to the last bad experience). M6 husband did not like the ham which was super flat resembling packaged sandwich deli meat. I enjoyed my classic breakfast sandwich. Overall this meal was probably the best experience we've  had here.
Nayeli M.,"Salinas, CA",0,13,7,1.0,4/11/2016,"Service was unbelievably bad. It was about to be 8pm. We got seated very quick. We got our table and our initial server was amazingly friendly, attentive and overall good at his job! We ordered our food my pasta was undercooked and chewy, not well seasoned. Didn't eat much of it but other times I've gone the food has always been good so I didn't think too much of it. So we decided to place our desert order, he informed us that he would be taking off for the night and naturally that another waitress would be taking over. No big deal, however, the first and LAST time we saw her is when she dropped off our desert without saying a word!  We finished waited for the check, about 15 minutes of waiting I decided to call a waitress walking by. I said ""excuse me"" she glanced at me and kept walking. I was a little irritated but I just thought maybe she didn't hear me. Again, a second waitress passed by I made sure to say it louder so she could hear me. She then looked at me, rolled her eyes, looked away, and kept walking. At this point we were there for 35min I asked my boyfriend to call over a young man cleaning the tables. We informed him that we had been waiting and that we just wanted the check. He said he would let the waitress attending the table know and took off. 15 more minutes went by and nothing. Finally I asked the same worker if he knew anything about the check, he apologized and went to tell the waitress yet again. We waited for another 10 minutes for them to bring us our check.  We were there for a little over an hour JUST WAITING FOR THE CHECK. It is very irritating to be blatantly ignored when all we wanted to do was pay out bill."
Lori M.,"Seaside, CA",181,6,2,2.0,12/27/2015,"Just.../no. Started off bad from the beginning and went downhill, sadly. It's Saturday night, busy, I get it. Walked in, stood right in front of the podium to check in. My two teenage girls went straight to the bathroom so I stood by myself. Enter two families/parties behind me who are asked for their names and how many in their party as I'm ignored. Finally, I say, ""excuse me but I believe I was here first and have been standing here."" She looks at me and without acknowledgement that she just put others ahead of me asks for my name and tells me there will be a 25 minute wait. No, don't think so. Lucky for me my girls came in while I parked the car and put their name on the list. We were seated rather quickly because of this.  We order chicken lettuce wraps as appetizer. They came out in a reasonable time and were delicious. However, we had to get up and find our server to ask for appetizer plates after attempting to eat juicy messy lettuce wraps over a napkin. I don't recommend it. I order ribeye with side of asparagus and side of Brussels sprouts and abportobello mushroom asparagus starter salad with NO CRANBERRIES AND NO PEPITAS.  Going low carb. Salad and dinner arrives at the same time (weird) and I'm given a steak (overcooked - definitely not medium), asparagus and a friggin plain dried out overcooked baked potato!  Had to send it back because I definitely cannot eat a starchy dry baked potato (if I'm going to eat it, it's going to at least have a little butter).  While waiting for that, I start on my salad,  no cranberries and dressing on side as ordered but PEPITAS all over the place. I spent the next several minutes while waiting for my dinner with the right sides picking out pepita seeds. I didn't want to send that back also. The girls received their spaghetti and meatballs and chicken Alfredo without incident, thank goodness. In the end, the food was okay, our server Brian tried (he even noticed I had a mountain of PEPITAS on the side of my plate and said he told them to HOLD them, but they didn't).  We didn't get a water refill (the only thing we  were drinking since we cut out sugary drinks).  In the end, this place is mediocre at best and perhaps new management or serious training could help whip this place into shape. Attention to details matters in this industry. 2 stars is the absolute best I could give this BJ's. The worst BJ's location I've been to which is sad because I actually live nearby this one. Probably will not be back - this is my 2nd time here with similar outcome."
Matt S.,"Salinas, CA",164,78,4,1.0,7/27/2016,"Ok last review for this particular BJ's ever...went last week with the fiancee for dinner...though I suppose that's always how this story starts. I ordered a Totonka...that was good! However, that's pretty much where the ""good"" part of this story ends. I ordered a large half-great white/half-chicken Philly pizza (super excited!) while the lady ordered the blue (or is it bleu? Whatever) cheese burger with the thin fries. Not long after our seemingly nice-guy waiter took our order, he came back with some other dude to tell us that he was taking off and said other dude would be taking care of us. Ok. That's fine. Now let's skip ahead about 45 minutes. We haven't seen our food, let alone new server dude since the introduction. Finally, our OLD server comes to the table to say that he is sorry that the food is taking so long and asked if he could get us some soup or salad on the house to make up for it. Uuuggghhhh we're F-Word hungry for the main course but ok, we ask for a salad. He says ok no problem and says the manager should be by with our food in a moment. Within 10 minutes or so, some manager guy came by with our food, didn't say a word to us, and left...douche move. Anyway, also keep in mind we never saw the ""salad on the house."" Whatever, it's been almost 50 minutes since we ordered so let's just eat...hopefully a pizza and a burger can make up for the crap service we were seeing tonight. NOPE!!! On my end, both the Great White AND the chicken Philly tasted EXACTLY the same...BLAND! And I'm pissed at this point because I used to go to a BJ's in Southern California ALL THE TIME FOR THEIR PIZZA AND IT WAS ALWAYS AMAZING! THIS BJ's has now screwed up the pizza EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! HOW?!?! FOR THE LOVE OF CHEESES CHRIST HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?!?! Ok, how about the burger, which last time was really good...NARP! Flavorless meat with bleu cheese that seemed to be WAY TOO pungent, and I'm not being a wimp here because I know how bleu cheese can be, but this was like old foot cheese. The fries were ok though...I guess. So we eat a little and hate everything and the new dude server comes over and says ""hey so I'm not sure what happened to the salad so...yeah."" To which we both stare at him in disbelief...BUT WAIT HE KEEPS GOING! ""Yeah you know how sometimes you have your good nights and you have your bad nights. Yeah, you know?""........the disbelief stare continued...""so anyway, the manager is going to discount some of your meal for you tonight."" That got an ""ok thank you"" out of me. Here comes the check...the manager took 4 dollars off of our nearly 60 dollar check...HAHAHAHAHAHA....AND get this! THEY HAD PUT THE SALAD THAT THEY FORGOT TO GIVE US ON THE BILL AND ONLY TOOK IT OFF BECAUSE IT NEVER CAME!!! Remember that whole ""on the house because we suck"" part??? Apparently they didn't. So 3 trips is the charm for us with this BJ's...one mediocre trip and 2 ABSOLUTELY AWFUL trips? We're done...just terrible."
Vera R.,"Hollister, CA",0,42,4,1.0,9/29/2016,I went a couple weeks ago for lunch - my first time at this location. Boy was I disappointed. The service was not great. The waiter seemed overwhelmed with two tables. He forgot half my order and when I finally got it (fries) they were cold and hard as a rock. I always have the tomato bisque at BJ's because it's my favorite. It was luke warm and I'm thankful it wasn't my first bowl of it or I would have never ordered it again. Going back would certainly never by my choice...
Alyssa F.,"Gilroy, CA",3,46,,2.0,11/21/2015,"So slowwwww. Absolutely ridiculous. There was only like ten other parties in the entire restaurant and the wait for our food after ordering was over 35 minutes. Waitress was unprofessional and beyond slow. We were never offered a refill or asked how our food was. She stood in the corner and chatted with her friends most of the time and then disappeared. Food was alright. Although, one person in our party ordered an seared tuna salad and there were huge round balls of Wasabi hidden throughout the salad that someone carelessly just smacked on. All its issues really comes down to such a crappy staff. Definietly will not be back."
