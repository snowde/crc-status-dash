Christina G.,"Murrieta, CA",39,41,31,1.0,10/21/2014,"I've been meaning to write a review for this one! I recently went on a trip to San Francisco and my Bf & I had a gift card to BJ's so we decided to stop in Salinas to get some dinner. Worst. Mistake. Ever. All of the reiews about the service (lack of) are absolutely true.  The service was horrendous.  We were seated, the server comes over...starts wiping the table (although it was already clean) and talking trash about the busser and how he never does a good job. Seems like he wanted to present himself as the good guy. Anyway, server asks what we would like to drink- my BF order's a type of beer called the nutty brunette, in which the server looks at me and tells my BF it looks like he already has one. I'm not one to typically get offended but this server was already very ODD & getting on my nerves. 20 minutes passes. No sign of our server. No water. No beer. No order taken.  We ask to be moved. Again, the beer my BF ordered still hadn't come. We had THREE different people come over, one went to check on the beer, another took our order, and the third came to see if we had been helped. BJ's in Salinas- you are a hot mess, get yourself together. Absolutely no organization, communication, or customer service."
Shena R.,"Marina, CA",16,163,120,1.0,10/25/2015,This place is a joke. Of all the times I've been here the service has been consistently awful... Wait staff slow and untrained. LONG wait for food. This place needs new management.
Sophia M.,"Clarkston, WA",49,14,3,1.0,12/19/2015,"Just ate here. Worst BJ's I have ever eaten at. Seriously $40 dollars down the drain...if you're smart you would eat somewhere else. What a disappointment.  If I was the owner I would shut this location down immediately, because it is a horrible representation of typical BJ food. One star because I had too."
Bahar S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",29,193,21,1.0,3/6/2015,"I used to go to BJs in high school and I remember the food being good, but my recent experience was pretty dismal. I got the shrimp pasta and it looked nothing like the picture. It was smothered in bread crumbs and served warm rather than hot. It was dry and lacked sauce but maybe that's because it was covered in stale bread crumbs. I'll stick to pizza if I ever come here again."
Mariko M.,"Toronto, Canada",189,839,1132,3.0,8/28/2013,"We arrived in Salinas late and not knowing the area, we asked the Front Desk for recommendations. If you stay at the Residence Inn, you get a 10% discount so we decided to eat at BJ's. It's a sports bar with many huge screens along with a dining area. Prior to my visit at the Salinas' BJ's, I had never heard of this place, but apparently they're all over the south-west US. The service here was okay - our server became really slow once we told him that we weren't ordering alcohol. On to the topic of alcohol, this place does have an extensive beer menu with local brews. My dad and I ordered the thin crust pizza - it was paper thin (which I like), but you could tell that it was just heated it up from a package (very unevenly baked). For a discount I will eat here, but besides that, I'm a-ok not coming back. Good for: drinks, watching sports"
Ricky P.,"Marina, CA",2,37,149,1.0,11/8/2015,"This place sucks! Took them 20 min just to ask us what we want to drink. Service sucks, the food came out cold after sitting and waiting for 45 mins! Brought the food out with no silverware too! Now I'm sitting here looking at my food waiting for a fork! It's almost unbelievable how bad this place is."
Tylor M.,"Seaside, CA",39,94,3,5.0,3/20/2015,"My 5 stars is based on a few good visits and 1 excellent visit.  Compared to the BJ's in Modesto (see my other review), this place should get a 6th star. My wife and I had a baby 2 weeks ago.  Last night was the first time we've gotten to go out together since he was born.  Our server was awesome.  He was patient, understanding, and anecdotal.  He was attentive when my wife had to leave for 45 to feed and change, and he definitely earned my 5 stars.  He turned what could have been a difficult outing into an awesome one.  Thanks, Jeremy, for being everything a server should be.  We will be back, and we will ask to sit in your section."
Ronel O.,"Salinas, CA",5,32,,5.0,2/28/2015,"UPDATE Service has definitely improved since they first opened. We had ADAM as our server and he has the best customer service here. Give this man a raise. Try their new IPA and deep dish pizza's They have a huge menu, I haven't had a bad meal here yet."
Kyle T.,"Monterey, CA",146,15,8,3.0,3/1/2015,"Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi  It's not bad. There's not much flavor in the dish. I would not order it again. The ""Bloody Mary"" was pretty good. The pizookie was delicious. Mistakes happen but overall the service was excellent. Very nice waitress. I would come back in thre future."
Jessica S.,"Carson City, NV",2,23,2,1.0,12/28/2015,"4 adults went here for dinner tonight. We were seated after a few minutes,  but left at the table without someone to take our drink order for over 10 minutes. By the time Javier came over to us we were all ready to order, not just drinks but also or meal. 2 beers, 2 waters,  a soda and a coffee were ordered along with a burger (well done), pasta, fried chicken and the rib eye (medium). After 10 more minutes the waiter come to let my husband know they were out of the beer he ordered. Still no other drinks. Slowly after the soda arrived. Still no water,  coffee or beer. The beer and water eventually showed up. No coffee. It seriously took over 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee. We've all had slow service before,  but this is ridiculous. Then the meal comes. Well done burger is medium at best, medium rib eye (mind you, this is over $20) is so raw is purple and on the verge of being bloody, and the succotash is chewy, old and cold. Jesse, the manager came by and asked how our dinner was. We were honest. The burger was sent back and replaced. The steak was eaten around the most rare parts and the chicken and succotash was left mostly untouched. We were starving,so we ordered a poozooki sampler to share and a decaf coffee. Glad they couldn't screw up ice cream and cookies. My friend prepped her coffee and began drinking it till she saw a coffee ring in the bottom of her cup. Since it was a new cup of coffee, this was utterly disturbing. We called over a server and all they said they'd do is replace it. Gross. You poured and served a ""fresh"" cup of coffee in a dirty cup. When the waiter brought the check, I told him I had no problem paying for the beer, poozooki and pasta dish since those didn't have issues. All they removed from the check was the coffee. Awful. Unclean. Crappy service. Hope the health department visits in the morning and shuts them down. Wish we'd seen the reviews before."
Salinas C.,"Salinas, CA",0,9,19,1.0,9/12/2016,"Lulu, the worst host I've seen in Salinas. Talking to other co workers while trying to figure out were to sit. (aka bad multi-tasker)"
Eric P.,"Salinas, CA",0,52,,1.0,4/2/2016,"I've been here several times, which has been several times too many.  Slow, very slow!  If you don't have a lot of time, forget it.  The food seemed good, but might have been because by the time the food got there, just about anything would have tasted good. The last time was because of a special social event.  Unbelievably, even slower!  We wouldn't have gone except we were invited to something special. Maybe it is so slow so they can sell more alcohol.  Maybe the plan is to get you drunk enough so that anything seems good. Hopefully I'll never get invited to any more special events there and will never go again..."
RoseMary J.,"Salinas, CA",9,33,8,4.0,2/14/2016,"Good food, nice assortment if draft beers.  I have always gotten great service.  I'm not big on restaurants that put children in proximity to the alcohol, wheter or nor their party is drinking, doesnt matter.  It's the language the alcohol incites that  bothers  me.  Put them in the separate room."
Lenny L.,"Lancaster, CA",36,27,9,5.0,3/22/2016,Excellent service from start to finish! We were greeted with a warm welcome and seated right away. Our server Mikayla was great and provided us with outstanding service. The manager Jesse talked with us and was super nice and made us feel so welcome. The food was delicious and my Jerryburst hit the spot! I can't say enough good things about this BJS! The GM must be doing something right because this team rocks!
Stacy B.,"Monterey, CA",25,36,28,3.0,1/23/2015,"Great lunch menu, service can be iffy at times. Outside seating is available that allows pets (at least small dogs.)  They have a incredible dessert called a pazookie. The beers are ok I like the berry cider. The only reason for 3 stars is the inconcistancy in the service"
Maria W.,"Monterey, CA",34,3,8,1.0,10/31/2015,"No refills. No one cleared the table. My mother's arugula salad was all spinach and zero arugula. My salad was lettuce and dressing. Our medium pizza was cold on arrival. This isn't the first time for bad service here, but it's the last time I'll ever be back to this location. We weren't able to speak to a manager because she was busy with 3 other table's complaints."
Barbara Z.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/16/2016,Fast and flavorful! Excellent service--perfectly attentive. The Buffolo chicken sandwich is fab if you like high flavor impact.
Fabian M.,"Watsonville, CA",1,5,5,4.0,6/22/2015,"So this was out first time here and I have to say it was a nice experience. From reading the reviews I was scared to come here at first but most bad reviews were about the service not the food. So we took a chance and great service but the food...  well the burger was lackluster and the bread was completely covered in grease and my pizza was okay but at that price your better off at round table. They only got a 4 out of 5 because of there flat bread appetizer, that was amazing."
Cheri L.,"Salinas, CA",2,24,3,2.0,11/2/2015,"Why, oh why, is the service so awful at this place??  The waitstaff is friendly and hard working but I can't figure out what they're busy doing.  At breakfast on Sunday, the place was almost empty, and I actually resorted to flailing my arms in the air to get anyone's attention. I wish I could say this was an isolated incident.  You would think they'd get tired of apologizing to everyone. I'm a glutton for punishment as I keep returning...."
Emily C.,"Hollister, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/31/2015,"We had a X~country meet in salinas The kids all wanted to get together & go to  BJ's! We had a total of 17 people, I called and the manager put us right in NO problem. Our server Missy was above and beyond kind. She took our orders and she was always there asking if we needed  refills or anything.  Very very patient and always with a smile on her face! We also asked her to split the bill she did it with no problem! Thank you ‼"
