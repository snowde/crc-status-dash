Krystal L.,"San Jose, CA",64,126,29,2.0,8/15/2015,"Wanted to like it but didn't. Both experiences I've had here were just the worst service of all time. Rude, slow and condescending. The food is also nothing special.. Strange recipes and tons of salt. They also make you wait a ridiculous amount of time.. We had ordered just dessert one time we went and it took 30 minutes to tell us the kitchen was backed up.... Then after waiting 15 plus minutes more we had to just walk out. They had a ton of empty tables and no excuse for that. We won't be going back.."
Viki D.,"Salinas, CA",44,56,59,4.0,2/6/2016,We love BJ brewhouse but we only sit at the bar and get the most excellent service ever there. Their lettuce cups and some of their small plates are amazing and we have never been disappointed when we've had any questions or problems with their order the bartender just takes care of it without blinking an eye. The tab beers are amazing and so are the margaritas.
Maria DeGennarro M.,"Monterey, CA",0,64,33,5.0,12/15/2015,My boyfriend and I decided to come here for date night. We been here before a couple of times but I had never reviewed it. Every time we come here we get fast and friendly service. We have never had a problem. The staff is friendly and attentive which is the reason why we come here every other month. I love the calamari which is one of the reasons we always come back. Also they have the best strawberry mojitos. I would defiantly recommend friends to come here for dinner.
Nathan P.,"Salinas, CA",3,60,9,3.0,9/23/2015,"Happy hour is good. You can't really complain per prices are really cheap. But if you decide to eat there, you're rolling the dice. It's hit and miss.  When it's good it's great. When it's bad it's BAD. Just realize that and,you'll be alright. I'm still going."
Amy M.,"Salinas, CA",10,45,3,5.0,1/19/2015,I straight up walked out of Chilis because they didn't even bother to acknowledge us beyond seating us for over 20 minutes...within ten minutes of being here at BJ's I have drinks on my table and my party has ordered.  I have been to this location several times and have ALWAYS had the best service! I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner services and it's always good service. The food choices are awesomely varied so likely they will have something for everyone in your party.   I love BJs!
Sarah S.,"Watsonville, CA",0,15,,4.0,8/23/2016,"Went for dinner on a Friday night - had the best waiter I've had here - Jose B. was attentive, kind and on top of everything!  Food was good, beer was better and Jose B. was the best!"
Wil S.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,,2.0,2/18/2017,"I have to say we waited over 20 minutes for a table for 2 and when I was ready to leave they called our name. As we walked to our table I noticed a number 2 seat tables available and a number of booths that could have been filled by the number of people waiting to be seated. Our server Was prompt and seemed nice enough. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and of course they looked nothing like the menu. 6 very tiny mushrooms not a good value but fairly tasty. However, we had to eat the mushrooms on the platter they were served on as our server and the two other servers that brought us our appetizer and shared salad never offered us individual side plates until we asked for them and then it appeared our server look a bit befuttled until I pointed out that everyone else had the plates on their table. Surprising my dish looked nothing like the menu and tasted like I could have made it at home, so fairly good. This not a place to have a private conversation as the music is a little on the loud side but maybe it's a distraction from the food being a step, and I mean only a step, from regular pub food. I'm only giving BJs a 2 star rating mostly for the inattentive service, mediocre food, and generic beer."
Paul L.,"Carmel Valley, CA",50,251,3,2.0,11/7/2012,"Wife wanted to go there last night because she saw on their facebook page that they were offering happy hour prices in the bar and restaurant all day on election night. I figured there wouldn't be anything on TV other than election coverage, so we went to Salinas to meet some friends there for dinner. I don't know what their happy hour consists of, but they didn't honor any kind of happy hour pricing at this location even though there was nothing stated about any non-participating locations in the ad. The server just said that she hadn't heard anything about it, and when my wife showed her the offer on her phone, she said she'd ask the manager. I don't think that ever happened. We never heard anything more on the subject. Not a big deal, but it seems like a pretty shady way to get people in the door. The other thing that annoyed me was that it was so dark that we could barely read the menu. Either use bigger, bolder print, or turn the damn lights up. I haven't had that problem there before even though it never seems very brightly lit, but it was all of us. Not just me. Those pendant lights in the booths only seem to light up a six inch diameter circle in the middle of the table. Food and drinks were fine, but my wife ordered a pizza and they left off the tomatoes. It wasn't any kind of special order or anything, just a regular menu item. You'd expect that they could at least get their own menu items correct with no special requests. There was little if any sauce on the pizza, so it really could have used those tomatoes. Service was good, but a little slow considering that there were more employees than customers. Much better than last time I was there (never wrote an update review about that dinner) when everything was painfully slow and it took over 45 minutes to get our pizookies."
Aldo C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/25/2015,"One star because the waiter was nice. I ordered the turkey burger, which tasted and looked horrible. It looked like the picked it out of the trash.  The fries that came with the burger were disgusting. They tasted a day old, and they were extremely over cooked. The fries were rock hard, and inedible. My nephew ordered a simple steak and steamed broccoli, which he thought was delicious."
Jasmine S.,"Salinas, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/13/2015,Came here with a couple of friends one time and I swear the food took about longer than one hour to come out. Towards the end we did separate tabs and many of us were very disappointed in the service me and my boyfriend tipped about 6 bucks despite the fact service was bad for first time customers and others did not tip as we were walking out me and my boyfriend were the last ones I headed to the car when I noticed he wasn't coming they were holding him from leaving forcing him to pay for everyone's else's TIP it was humiliating since we left tip for our tab the staff doesn't even have the right to do that have never gone back since then! If I could leave no stars I would..
Armando M.,"Sonoma, CA",34,63,51,2.0,5/11/2015,"We chose this restaurant for our Mother's Day Brunch. I was surprised when we were able to be seated immediately (party of 6). It was just after 10 AM and the restaurant was mostly vacant. Our hostess attempted to seat us at a table that was covered by smudge marks. I requested to be seated at another table and she complied.  Our server arrived about 5 minutes after being seated and she appeared to be overwhelmed. We should have gotten up at this point and gone somewhere else. We were waiting for someone to join us, and therefore there was a delay on our part. However, our drink order was slow, cream and sugar was not available or offered for our coffee, and the server looked like she was on the brink of a nervous breakdown.  Our order was ""finally"" taken and it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to the time our food started to arrive. Our drinks were not refilled and I discovered that one of our napkins, given by our hostess rolled with silver ware, was dirty. The restaurant was still empty and I couldn't see why we were not getting adequate service and a prompt pace. The table next to us seemed equally frustrated as we were. Our food arrived and one entree arrived 5 minutes after all others. This added a further delay and frustration to our experience. Someone claiming to be the Manager visited our table during this period. He mentioned that he ""just""arrived and learned that we had waited for an unreasonably long time for our meals. He apologized and promised to make it up. He asked us if we needed anything and I said Yes, refills on our drinks. Our table had empty glasses, empty plates, and we had been there for 1 1/2 hours.  I place the blame on the management and inexperienced servers. I felt compelled to pull the manager aside and inform him of what our expectations were. I opted not, because I wanted to remain ""civil"" for the remainder of our visit. I suggest you close one day and have a training session with your staff and perhaps fundamental training for the management. Everything was way off. I would like to explain it all, but I feel that I should not because it is not my responsibility to train you or your staff. I am however, compelled to share my experience via Yelp to let you and others how subpar of an establishment you are running. Lastly, it is an insult to have your servers pick up their tip while the table is still occupied. The only reason we left a tip was out of respect and pity. Won't be back to this Bj's. I have been to others and I have never had an issue. The food was good by the way"
Don J.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,5.0,12/16/2015,We totally enjoyed our dinning experience . This was our first visit and we we're very impressed  with our waitress her superb service and the very tasty food. We  will be patronizing this facility agian real soon. Very nice. We loved the side salads very good.
Lori P.,"Fairfield, CA",1,49,4,5.0,12/16/2015,Stopped her on the way to SoCal. The service was exceptional from the second we came through the door! Food was delicious. I am addicted to their root beer!
Julie C.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/29/2016,"It was a rare date night for my husband and I so we decide to go to BJ's for dinner.  We got there around  6:45 and were seated after only a few minutes.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer which took longer than we expected. After we ordered our waiter stopped by several times to check on our order. We waited for nearly an hour and never got our food. Other people around us, who were seated after us, got there food before us.  On the last visit from our waiter we told him we were not satisfied and we left.  Truly disappointed that we never got our food and had to leave."
Jack K.,"San Jose, CA",15,9,,1.0,5/12/2016,"I am giving this place 1 star because I don't see how to give it zero. Came a little before 5:00 to be ignored at the bar for 5 minutes. When I finally got to order a drink (skinny margarita) and a mini pizza, the drink came and I thought it was way too sour. But I never got a chance to tell the bar keep because he continued to ignore me. It is a skinny margarita because you can't drink it. The mini pizza never came. So after 30 minutes, I told the bar keep to cancel the order. He said he would go talk to his manager. What? I waited another 5 minutes and the manager never showed up. So much concern is overwhelming. I asked the bar keep how much the drink was and wow it was $8.50 for a lousy drink that I took two sips. I left $10 and left. DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE NO CONCERN FOR TIME OR SERVICE."
Marlaina M.,"Salinas, CA",31,22,11,1.0,5/16/2015,"I do not know how many times I've given this restaurant a chance, thinking service and food will always improve. SAME horrible service and food is always disgusting! My pasta was dry n tasted like it had been out for hours, I asked the server if I could get my pasta replaced and she said "" I can bring more sauce"" WTF . Moreover, My clam chowder was super salty, but the cherry on top of my horrible experience was shitty service. They really need to improve the customer experience."
Michael O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,2.0,6/13/2015,Super slow service and the place was not even busy. Forgot my wife's salad and thank goodness we had 90 plus minutes to eat because it took every bit of that.   Expensive...won't be back to this location EVER!
Dria M.,"Salinas, CA",2,21,,1.0,5/29/2016,"The 1 star is not for the food but for the service provided. We were seated in an area towards the back. We waited 15 minutes for the server but he/she never arrived. My husband had to get up and find an employee to help us. We waited 5 more minutes and a very kind hostess had to take our order. Pete, our server showed up and said, we were seated in an area with no server assigned....so he apologized. Our dinner was delivered by a gentleman who made no verbal/contact just simply placed our food in front of us and left....we were not given silverware, pepper or cheese. Again we had to flag a different person. We had to flag another person, who was on break, for refill on drinks. Waited so long for our check, we actually had to get up and ask the take-out person for our check......Pete could have offered our dessert on the house to compensate for the horrible service, but I guess that too was much to ask for....was it the hostess who sat us down in a deserted area??? Or perhaps the server Pete, not interested in serving us???"
A Z.,"Hollister, CA",45,133,151,5.0,7/20/2013,"Wonderful!  It's the best BJ's I've been to this far, the layout of the place with small booths for couples is awesome! Service was good, food was delicious, no complaints"
Marshall C.,"Newman, CA",0,42,14,1.0,6/5/2014,"Not a good experience.  Stopped in for lunch.  Had to wait ten minutes for a table in an empty restaurant.  Ordering went ok.  Food delivery was much slower than ever before.  One order was incorrect.  When we pointed it out, the delivery girl said she has to check with the server.  Finally the order was corrected, but the rest of the party had finished their food.   The server didn't care. Two in our party had the endless soup and salad special.  The second fill took almost 15 minutes to get.  When the server came by to drop off the seconds, he apologized the clam chowder was out and asked if we wanted another option or wanted to wait 5 more minutes for the chowder.  We waited another ten for it.  We were never asked how our food was or our experience.  We got our check. It was supposed to be separated to two (we specified once seated).  We asked to speak to the manager and another server came over with ours and asked ""what's the problem here?""   No.   We will wait for the manager.  Manager came by and we explained all to him.  He asked that when we return, to ask for him and he will be sure to help us.  Nah, I won't be back."
