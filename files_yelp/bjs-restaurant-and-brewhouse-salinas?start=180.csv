Grady C.,"Salinas, CA",44,21,3,2.0,9/20/2015,"'Adrian' was my bartender on the second half of my experience at BJ's. Never asked if I wanted a refill or another drink, but when there were Hispanic/Latino patrons at the bar, he took care of them and never left their cup empty. Poor performance from the bartender on a mediocre Sunday afternoon."
Robert H.,"Atascadero, CA",2,6,,1.0,4/30/2015,"We tried to give this place three tries, but it must not be in the cards.   Took us 10 minutes to get a server, 45 minutes to get our appetizer, and the food came out in the wrong order.  Staff seemed confused and overwhelmed at all levels in spite of the fact that the restaurant was half empty.   Took us 90 minutes to complete dinner and I nearly walked out twice   We won't be going back.   Not indicative of all BJs, for sure, but this one just can't seem to get it together."
Sharon P.,"Winters, CA",2,20,,4.0,2/12/2016,I came here with my family and it was a great experience.  I had the steak with a baked potato and  asparagus.  My steak was cooked perfectly along with the asparagus-not too soft and not to crisp.  Would definitely come back! Waitress was attentive and friendly!
Andrew B.,"Concord, CA",1,9,2,1.0,5/25/2015,It was the worst.  Brought our friends from holland here to show them great beers and food.  I was so embarrassed.  We had to stand at the bar and get our own beer.  Waited for an hour to order.  The waiter had excuses but no service.
William R.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/29/2014,"Service - slow Food - ok Beer - great I really want to like this place but the service is so slow it seems like borderline neglect.  The staff are nice enough, but when you have been sitting in the restaurant for 15 minutes without so much as a glass of water it starts to make you wonder. I can understand the wait for my main course - good food can take time to prepare.  But if you are going to make me wait the least you can do is send someone over to make sure my drink is full.  Why does it take 10 minutes to get a beer?"
Jennifer Y.,"Monterey, CA",21,79,23,4.0,6/10/2015,"I love the Root Beer. Love the atmosphere, the service is good and the food is pretty good."
Lia S.,"Salinas, CA",105,48,157,2.0,9/24/2015,"My husband ordered the shrimp scampi pasta. And I had the deep dish ravioli. Both dishes could have been better. With the shrimp scampi pasta, the noodles were over cooked and had a weird taste to it. The deep dish ravioli had no pepperoni or sausage in the sauce like promised. We came during happy hour and they ran out of mini pizzas. Our server went on break and the one that replaced her was busy running around and didn't pay much attention to us. When he finally returned to our table we ordered dessert and a hot chocolate and asked to see a manager. We told the manager our situation regarding the pasta and she handled the situation.  When our original server arrived back to check on us, I asked about the hot chocolate and she said they don't serve it. It would have been nice to know if the other server had told us and I would have ordered something else. The food here is ok. Best at happy hour. Service could definitely use some work here."
Mrs. T.,"Gonzales, CA",1,52,4,2.0,12/2/2015,Food is good and servers are super nice BUT every time we come here the food service gets slower and slower. This time I ordered a salad before my entree and it never did show up. Sad. I do like this place. Seems like maybe a management or scheduling problem.
CandC S.,"Salinas, CA",0,28,6,1.0,1/14/2016,"I have given this location multiple chances and sadly, I don't think they are capable of changing. Due to its proximity and hours, I'll find myself going there for dinner with friends, but this place is only good for just that. Otherwise, good luck being seated in a timely fashion, good luck with having 1 dedicated server, good luck getting your food and/or drinks any where within 45 minutes and hopefully you get everything the way you asked for it. We went recently for a birthday (surprise birthday at that) and it was ruined! One simple task and they managed to mess that up too. Ordering food will do you no better, check your food before you leave!"
Susanne M.,"Salinas, CA",72,3,,1.0,7/4/2015,"The service here is bad. Once seated we waited 15 min before our waiter cane to us.  Once we got our ice tea, didn't  bother to ask  if we needed sweetner. We had to go to them. Food Is just dropped off, nothing said. The waiter that brought our meal was more hospitable."
Aryan O.,"Long Beach, CA",111,537,26,4.0,4/5/2012,"I've been to many BJ's up and down California and when I found out that it was here in Salinas, I was pretty shocked. The place is a decent size and can fit parties, but not many. So expect a long wait if you do come with a party. This place is very ideal for couples or parties of 4 to 6.  The beers and pizookie is what draws me to BJ's all the time (and the Jambalaya). If you're not too sure on what beer to get (Nutty Brunette, Jeremiah Red, Piranha) I would suggest getting the flight of beers. It's a sample of most of their signature beers. Everything is pretty good on the menu, you can't go wrong with any of the items. The soups are really good, the burgers are good as well (Deep Fried Jalapeno Burger, add mushrooms and bacon), Jambalaya and the pizzas. If you're not too hungry on pizza I'll probably just order the mini, it's basically a four slice pizza, a good size especially if your trying to save room for dessert. Pizookie all day tho. The Chunky Chocolate Chip is really good and so is the Which Chocolate Macadamia  There are TVs everywhere so you won't be missing out on anything. The one thing though (not sure if it's because it's Salinas) but they do have a policy on weekdays at 12am they pull your alcohol off your table no matter how full it is. So you better drink fast. And on weekends probably goes the same, an hour after closing. A little FYI for you guys."
Lane D.,"Vancouver, WA",1,99,,2.0,10/3/2015,"Arrived for lunch, the restaurant is less than 50% seated. Was promptly seated and served beverages and order taken. Ordered chicken wings, side salad, small pizza and turkey club.  It took over 1/2 hour to get to the table.  Asked for additional buffalo sauce and it was served chilled, as in Frank's straight from the bottle.  Have never had either quality service or food here."
Erica D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,29,6,2.0,5/22/2016,"The food at this place is eh, nothing special. It's ok, it's good but it's nothing that I'm gonna always remember or anything like that. The one thing I do remember about this place is the wait is ridiculous and I'm not talking about the wait to be seated. No, once we were at our table the service was very slow and it's been like this every time I've gone. I would've gave the place 3 stars if the service was good, I mean the waiters are friendly but it's just too slow."
Nicole J.,"Wayne, NJ",9,18,,5.0,3/3/2014,"Ended up going here on a Saturday night after we found out or original restaurant choice had a 1 1/2 hour wait, which was really surprising since this is Salinas.  Anyway, this was my first time going to BJ's and it was a fantastic second choice.  My boyfriend and I were seated in less than 10 minutes, but there seemed to be a longer wait for larger parties.   They have a huge variety of food choices, so I'd guess that they have something for everyone, even people with gluten allergies!  We ended up getting the calamari as an appetizer and the deep dish BBQ chicken pizza, both were absolutely delicious.  I think BJ's may be my go-to pizza place from now on it was so good. The service was good, had comfy seating in our booth, and a decent beer selection along with a full bar.  I'd give this place more than two thumbs up if I could."
Melissa M.,"Monterey, CA",20,24,81,4.0,4/7/2012,"I've been to a BJ's before its good As always  visit . they never let me down ! So this time my family  and I decided to check out the new BJ's in town ! I was kinda not looking forward to the wait bc it seem super busy ! We went during lunch time 12:30 !

My hubby and I had 2 beers the Pale Ale n Blonde yummy  !!! For lunch was the Calif Sandwhich so good melted grilled chicken ., chipotle mayo , green peppers so good ! Hubby had the Chili cheese burger omg that thing was so good and heaping w/ cheese lots of it he had to take the rest home !  Our service was awesome ! Let's just hope it stays like this , one of the mangers came over to check on us too . That was nice !! Over all yummy as always !!!"
Denise V.,"Saint Peters, MO",0,1,,2.0,6/29/2016,"Great food but it took a whole hour to get our sandwiches and the restaurant was only about a quarter full.   If you wanted to go on your lunch hour, you would never make it back in time.  Maybe that is why it was only a quarter full on a Wednesday at only 10 minutes past noon."
Jo J.,"Folsom, CA",7,22,20,2.0,4/24/2015,"Food was okay service was okay to poor, waitress never came by to see how good was only dropped off check and left and didn't come back for a long time even though you could clearly see we were done. Hostess was texting on phone hiding from coworkers."
Anna C.,"Salinas, CA",328,76,34,2.0,7/16/2015,"Service is always slow. It takes a while to be seated, a while for a server to come, and even longer for your food to come out. You'd probably spend more time waiting than actually eating your food. I've been here a couple of times since it opened, hoping service would improve but it hasn't. The burgers here are great though."
Diana M.,"Salinas, CA",2,10,,4.0,6/19/2015,I kinda wanna give if 3 and a 1/2 stars. It's not very good here but I've never had too bad of an experience. It is really pricy but the food isn't worth the price. Their pizookies are very amazing though. It's one of the main reasons I actually come here.
Debby F.,"Monterey, CA",62,425,269,2.0,6/29/2015,"Well, the stars are falling. We came here for brunch. We arrived at noon, and the place was less than half full.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our pancakes with eggs and bacon. The bacon was undercooked and soggy.  My pancakes looked golden and fluffy, until I Iifted one to butter them. Underneath, they were burned... crispy critter burned. So were my husband's.  It took a while to flag down the waitress, and she immediately apologize and said she'd order new ones.  We got tired of waiting, so I scraped off the tops of the pancakes to eat them. Almost 10 minutes later, our pancakes arrived. They were raw inside.  We flagged down our server who apologized profusely. I reassured her it wasn't her fault, but that the cook needed to go back to pancake school.  She took our plates away ""to show the manager"".  We had to wait another 10 minutes and the manager did come to our table.  He comped our meals, except $2.50 for the coffee.  That was very nice of him, as we would have paid for our eggs.  So, five stars for customer service.   We gave our server $20 in cash, and she asked if we wanted change. Um, yeah... she was nice, but not THAT nice!  We got shorted .50 but we let it go and we did tip her based on what our meal would have cost @20%. Bottom line-- we were there for one hour and fifteen minutes.  I don't think this place is really set up for breakfast.  Service was way too slow, and we won't come back for brunch. Very disappointed."
