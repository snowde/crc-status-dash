Trinidad G.,"Salinas, CA",11,11,8,4.0,2/16/2014,"I had there pulled pork sandwich ,Avocado spring rolls and there own beer and also a berry soda also there own ! The Service was very good.  My only dislike was the lighting it was hard to read the menu the time of day was about 12:00 pm for being day time not enough of light ? The lighting would be more to the mood of night dinner date? Food ,Drinks where very Good ! I would say go eat but you may want to bring a flash light to read there menu. :-)"
Diego S.,"Monterey, CA",314,131,9,3.0,10/18/2013,"Very good food.  Service is very very slow.  Restaurant 1/3 full 6 servers a bartender, a hostess, a manager and 2 busboys and I had to get up of the table twice to get more water.  If you have time to spare and not that hungry go, food is good."
Larry C.,"Salinas, CA",57,26,112,4.0,1/2/2014,Ok there is one thing  that has to said Deep Dish Pizza. Yummy words failed me it would be a criminal. The rest of the menu is hit an miss but the pizza a total home run.
Jeff D.,"Salinas, CA",15,18,2,2.0,6/5/2013,"Ugh... Where do I start? We've been to BJ's in Stockton many times, but only once before here in Salinas. I thought I would give it one more try since it's close to our house and we were ina hurry. Mistake. The food is average at best. The service is far below average. We got there on a slow- mildly busy evening. We seated ourselves in the bar area and waited for our server. He showed up and was fairly nice though seemed uninterested to be talking to us (looking around the bar while we were ordering our drinks, little to no eye contact or smile). I asked if he could change one TV to the NHL Conference Final game instead of sports highlight... After the second time I asked he told me ""I am busy.. I will ask the manager when I get a chance"". We watched him clean tables, talk to other staff members, walk past the manager a dozen times (manager was standing on the floor) and no game. BJ's food is ok.. what will keep me from ever going again is the service. With all the options out there I can go be ignored somewhere else with better food..."
Mary M.,"Salinas, CA",4,14,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Bad service. We waited 25 minutes from the time we asked for our check (and we had to ask for it, because our server disappeared) to the time he brought the change, at which point he didn't make eye contact, apologize for the wait, say thanks for coming in, nada. While we were waiting, one table walked out because nobody ever came to take their order and the people next to us had to ask for their check as well. If the place was slammed I would get it, but there were multiple empty tables and it just wasn't that busy. It's been a year since I went in here because the service was bad last time around -- lesson learned. Again."
Cassie F.,"Seaside, CA",59,2,,1.0,3/17/2016,"My friend and I decided to try BJ's for dinner. It was the first time I have ever tried this restraunt and it will be the last. I could write a book about the problems we had with this visit. After ordering the appetizer we had to wait almost 20 minutes just to get some chips and dip. Then when our drinks were empty the waitress said she would be right back with some more, we didn't see her again for another 20 minutes. All the empty tables around us were not cleared or cleaned almost the entire time we were there. My friend's order came out wrong and when we both asked the waitress for ranch she came out with 1 tiny cup of ranch and set it between us and took off before we could ask for more. Another issue I had was when I had asked for a water and the waitress poured it into my cup that had my lemonade in it and then she just walked off.The biggest issue though was that the wait staff was so inattentive and seemed to want to do anything else then check on their tables. What should have been an hour dinner turned into a 2.5 hour dinner spent mostly waiting for our waitress to come to the table. I know we were not the only ones with this issue tonight. We saw people having to bring their checks up to the register after sitting so long waiting for their waitress to come pick it up and another couple who had to wait 40 minutes for anyone to even come to their table at all since they sat down. It's such a shame. It's such a beautiful restraunt and if you had a more attentive wait staff, you would have so much more better reviews and a higher rating but this seems to be a consistent issue."
Cynthia M.,"Morro Bay, CA",1,28,,2.0,5/20/2015,"Went here for lunch on the way home from SF last Sunday.  Should've tried 5 Guys, which was right next door.  Oh well, next time.  I ordered the chicken club sandwich.  Chicken was dry, and there was no sauce or mayo or anything on the bread.  Bland doesn't tell the half of it!  My dad had some sort of bbq sampler plate, and the piece of meat (chicken, pork, cat?) was thin and dry and covered with an insipid bbq sauce.  My hubby had the burger, which was just ok, probably the best of the bunch.  Finally my little one had the corn dogs, which again, were just ok.  It took about 25 minutes for the food to come, during a non-busy lunch time.  Never again."
Doesthismoniker M.,"Salinas, CA",0,20,12,5.0,4/12/2016,"Fabulous Service,tasty food and best prices in town!! Love,Love,Love our dates at BJ's!!"
Beckie O.,"Watsonville, CA",22,6,1,5.0,5/16/2015,We came to BJ's for our daughter in law's birthday! We were seated right away & our server was Vinnie! He was amazing & efficient & we will come back & ask for him! Thanks Vinnie for your greatly service!
Gen C.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/9/2016,"From the moment we were seated their customer service was so bad! We were there to celebrate a birthday  so we expected to have a nice good dinner, that didn't turn out so well. No waiter/waitress even acknowledged us as were seated. And there were plenty around  serving other customers. FIinally had to call the manager over after waiting 15-20 just to order our drinks!! We all explained to her the situation, which she deeply apologized for her workers and said there was no excuse for them not tending to us. She immediately took our drink order. Finally a waitress came to take our food order, which you can tell she was fairly new. Finished our dinner asked for our check. We waited...and waited...and waited....she never came back with it, after about 20 min or so had to call the manager once again. This time it was a different one. We explained to him the whole situation from the moment we were seated to now, also told him we did not set out to be complainers or to get a free meal, because I bet sometimes situations happen like that. We were pretty capable of paying but that we were really upset on the poor customer service  that we were treated with. I will never ever go back to this restaurant here in Salinas!!!"
Lydia S.,"Salinas, CA",29,21,16,1.0,10/8/2014,I don't understand why there was hardly anyone in the restaurant and it still took 30 min to get drinks...40 min for appetizers...another 45 min to get our dinner...40 min for dessert and wait for it......another 40 min just for our bill. I could understand if the place was busy and it took forever but it was practically empty. Slow service.
David P.,"Carmel, CA",0,2,2,1.0,12/14/2013,"Very disappointed... Ive always wanted to go to to bjs and and all of my friends said it was amazing. I went there this Thursday night to try it.When I walked it the restaurant was beautiful and so was the bar and I had high expectations.We were seated as soon as we got there. It took about 10 minutes for someone to get our drink order. We ordered a calamari appetizer and that took about 10 minutes as well (no problem). Expecting it to be hot and crispy,It was not cold but lukewarm, soggy,and flavorless. The dipping sauce was straight out of a jar.  After the calamari,I ordered a brew house burger with bacon,cheese,lettuce etc.About 15-20 minutes later I get it and what do you know,warm and soggy.The fries weren't crispy but soft and lukewarm.The burger on the other hand was lukewarm,flavorless,and soggy bun. I was extremely disappointed in this restaurant and will not be going back. P.S the best thing I had was my root beer"
Jill B.,"Summerville, SC",236,257,56,3.0,8/10/2013,I came here for a lunch with my Aunt when I was in town.  The food was OK but the prices were kind of surprising. Probably won't necessarily insist on dining here next time I'm home but wouldn't complain too much if I ended up here again.
Courtney T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",9,41,3,5.0,12/19/2013,"Extensive menu selection and ridiculously delicious food!! We came here for lunch and the food was so flavorful and fresh! I highly recommend the chicken tortilla soup, it's the best chicken tortilla soup I've ever had. It wasn't too heavy or too soupy- it was perfect :)  I really like that they have the calories listed next to all the items on the menu too. It's nice to know the caloric range for those of us who are dieting but who also like to eat out!  Overall I highly recommend this place! The service was fast, the food was delicious, their bar is fully stocked with everything from gold label Patron to IPA beers and the ambiance was really nice. It was a cross between a casual sports bar and a fancy restaurant. I can't wait to go back for more tasty vittles!!"
Gerri A.,"Madera, CA",77,13,3,1.0,2/1/2015,"Came here with a party of 20 after softball. Since it is close to the ball park I'm sure we are not the first team to eat here. Waited 30 min to be seated. Server came introduced himself , said he was bringing another server to help. Told him we wanted separate tickets by family, usually not a big deal - the food came out-took unusually long and to get our bill- total nightmare! We waited 30 minutes just to get our bills done correctly. Management blamed it on how their system worked, servers blamed it on each other- whatever, just let me pay so I can get out of here. Got out of there at 11:15pm and still had to drive back to Fresno. Unacceptable service for large parties!"
S. K.,"San Mateo, CA",33,50,7,1.0,5/13/2013,Where do i begin.... My boyfriend and I stopped here for dinner after a long drive heading to San Luis. We were seated right away however were not even greeted til over 20 mins later. Servers kept walking passed our empty table and nobody even cared. We finally found a manager and a girl finally came to greet us gave us a half-A** apology and took our order. Food was slower than the service. A quick dinner ended up taking an hour and half.  Noted: never stop in Salinas again.
Lisa V.,"Salinas, CA",0,14,,2.0,9/21/2014,For some reason this BJ'S food and service just doesn't cut it.  Food cold service slow.  Perhaps too many young people working there.  I just don't know. 2 stars 1 extra because of the dessert.
Yvonne O.,"Soledad, CA",1,8,6,1.0,9/20/2014,"Food was delicious, when it finally arrived.  Several other people around us who had arrived after us were served their food before us. The wait was so long that our waiter passed by to ask if we were ready for dessert. Will consider other restaurants next time."
Jesus F.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/28/2014,I gotta say this is bjs and this location sucks. I mean yeah food is bjs and beer is beer. But the service is awefull. It's like the food sits in the back getting cold until you can get it. The wait staff awefull. I had a great bartender .but when she took a break another male took her spot. As he was putting beer glasses in the beer cooler upside down I simply asked why he would do that. The glasses were still wet and wet glasses in a cooler would allow the water to collect and freeze. That's why glassware is put upside down. This guy turned and told me to mind my business. What a joke of a place .I do not recomend going. Again food is good service sucks.
VG G.,"Watsonville, CA",0,19,1,4.0,2/18/2015,Great customer service in the bar area. We ordered a pizza and some drinks. Waitress gave us a sample of a drink that we might enjoyes and we actually did like it. Overall it's clean and exceptional.
