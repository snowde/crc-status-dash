Ben F.,"Monterey, CA",82,12,1,2.0,8/6/2014,"When BJ's first opened it was great. Attentive, great food, good drinks, accurate take out orders... Now, 2 years later, it's to the point my family and I don't even want to waste our time. The food is still pretty good, but everything else has gone noticeably downhill. The hostesses are usually friendly, but service is sorely lacking. Recent 'highlights' have included a appetizer served post-entree, and a entree arriving before silverware/napkins.  What BJ's does still have going for it is the food taste is still good, and the drinks are still drinks. Take out orders were consistently found to have errors or missing components. Sadly we'll be crossing BJ's off our list for family dinner night until this place can get back to how it used to be."
Polly K.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,1,1.0,5/17/2015,"Okay food, not consistent. Service to put is nice is inconsistent. Started out wanting to be high end, but is almost a dive bar now.... Might I go as far as to compare this to the Kings's Den??? At least the King's Den doesn't charge 6+ $$ for a beer and you know it's a dive before entering. Needs a management change,ASAP. Might I suggest Gordon Ramsay, cause it's a nightmare. Someone who might take pride in there location and JOB. I remember being excited when BJ was first moving hear. I based this off my experience in both the Sacarmento location and the busy San Jose Mall location. Needless to say I won't be going back to this location anytime soon... Horrible in all ways. A complete Failure. F-."
Serg L.,"Gardena, CA",119,84,835,4.0,12/5/2013,Enjoyed the happy hour food. The server was really cool this time. The angus beef were very good. The high light was the critter beignet.  Yummy.
pat b.,"Monterey, CA",21,15,,2.0,2/11/2016,"Cheap, okay happy hr if you you like their terrible beer and corporate poured drinks and bad food. The service at this particular one is so horrendous that they deserve an extra star just because its terribleness enhances the eating experience. They've elevated being bad at service so it is on  par with Cirque du Soleil or a good Vegas show. The table next to us didnt have a waiter speak to them after 15 mins and walked out. Truely masterful."
Olive R.,"Sacramento, CA",22,47,24,4.0,1/5/2015,"Every time I do not sit in the bar, I always regret it. Service is so much better in the bar area. Bartenders are great and friendly. And like I said, service is good! This place has my favorite happy hour :)"
Paula B.,"Salinas, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/11/2015,Went tonight with 15 people for dinner and they were struggling with our orders. At the end of the meal they brought out a huge pizookie to share with our whole party that was comped and we were happy. When the check came it was realized they comped all the orders and only charged for drinks and appetizers.  We were elated!  Both manager and server apologized. What a great way to turn something bad around. I am very happy with the way this evening was handled and will still recommend this restaurant because even if they do something wrong they will make it right. Good job BJ's!
Robert M.,"Hanford, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/16/2015,Fail.   -15 min from seating to waters and sodas arrived.  -45 min to first appetizer. Second app came with meals. Not ideal since at that point I want to eat my food. Oh yeah. Appetizer was cold.  -lettuce wraps are no good. Nothing like PF Chang's.  Fried artichokes were alright but lukewarm. Tomato mozzarella salad was doused so heavily in dressing that you couldn't taste either.  -1 hr to food. Screwed up both kids meals. Failed to bring side for one. Never served the other bc they messed it up so we cancelled it. -Sat a trio from the bar at the table right behind us with our three young kids when there were no less than 20 open tables in the vicinity (should have been our first clue). The trio proceeded to speak loudly about sex with frequent Fbombs until we left.  -took 10 min to bring the check an 5 more to run the card.  -Fed my kid that didn't get food by going next door to Chipotle. Should have done that to begin with.
Dennis A.,"Salinas, CA",15,63,39,1.0,12/19/2012,Every beer bar I've been to if you get the last of the keg it's free. Not here. I brought up the carbonation from the new keg and they told me it wouldn't be a problem and it was..  here they made me wait for 15 min for a not even full house brew. I'd wait for an actual craft beer but not something that's corporate and isn't local.  I really wish management would read these and make amends with their patrons..
Pamela G.,"Salinas, CA",35,11,88,1.0,10/6/2014,"Came for burgers because the monterey brewing company was closed. (They make the best in town) Have had them here before and they are usually pretty good. This time it was awful.  Both burgers were raw and we ordered med rare. Waited forever for second batch and mine was really salty.  The worst ever!  Waiter said manager would be by the table,  he never came.  Waiter was decent though. Worst experience I've ever had.  Very disappointed!"
Eric W.,"Paso Robles, CA",4,13,1,2.0,3/4/2015,"Kitchen was slow,  pizza was warmish. Not enough cheese and sauce. Wings were good. Great place to watch a game."
Marlene G.,"Salinas, CA",65,48,8,2.0,7/30/2014,"Food is good, drinks are okay. and service was horrible. Took forever to get a glass of water. The waiter was extremely rude. Took forever to get our food. This is the second time I've come here and both times I had the worse experience. I will not be coming back. (maybe just for drinks) LOL.. :)"
Christopher S.,"Salinas, CA",121,39,1,5.0,3/1/2016,We were greeted immediately as we entered. Host  asked if we preferred the dining room or the bar area for happy hour. We elected the dining room. Our server was Jeremy. He was amazing!! He offered several tasting of bar taps for us to sample. His knowledge of the menu was excellent. Food took a little longer to come out but he stayed on top of drink refills and apologized for the wait. Food was excellent once it arrived. Jeremy suggested dessert and they were super good. You can never go wrong with salted caramel.
Cinda F.,"Salinas, CA",13,10,,5.0,2/24/2015,"Yummy and delicious as always! I don't think I have ever gone to BJ's yet, and been disappointed. I go there for comfort food and tried and true favorites. I much rather have a BJ's than a Cheesecake factory. Love the food, the servers, and with the rewards program, why wouldn't you eat there?!"
Maria G.,"Salinas, CA",3,56,56,1.0,9/23/2014,Bad bad service....... Took 20 min to get 1 beer and 1 glass of water in a table for 2. We wasted 1 hour & 30 min just for an appetizer the glass of water 1 beer & a margarita. Instead of ordering dinner we asked for the bill luckily they didn't take long for that. We paid & went next door to get a burger... Big mistake on giving it another try. Didn't want to complain since another costumer across was pretty upset complaining to the manager & it did not look good.
J S.,"Roswell, NM",37,27,,2.0,8/17/2014,Ummm. Sloooooooooow. Very slow. Nice waiter but very out of it. The wheels were turning but I think the hamster was dead. Took 20 minutes for a house salad and 40+ for lunch. There were maybe 20 people in the resteraunt at the time.
Kimberly S.,"Harbor City, CA",24,10,3,1.0,6/10/2014,When you make reservations make sure you add in an extra 30mins to an hour for your reservations. Also the girl at the front desk has an attitude. I've never been to a BJs restaurant that was so short staffed and rude! I already talked to the manager and I will also email corporate thanks to the rude girl at front desk who wants to give me the evil eye as I leave since they were past our reservation time and their excuse was no server and then no table when they already let other groups ahead of us who didn't make a reservation. :P
Brandon B.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/2/2014,Awful service. Food was decent. Took forever to get water and to get served. Second time this happened at a BJ's. Not going back
John N.,"Hollister, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/24/2016,"Slooooooooooooow service, and waitresses don't know how to anticipate customer's needs. Just clueless. More often than not, this is typical of their service."
Yalda M.,"Milpitas, CA",8,21,5,1.0,11/6/2013,Horrible service and food! Chains need to pick it up a notch ! My fiancé got his order 15 minutes before mines. I felt bad letting him sit there on his own so that I can finish my food. I ended up taking it Togo
Tee J.,"Salinas, CA",3,78,1,1.0,5/15/2014,"- I had lunch with a customer here last week.  Excellent food and service.  -- We three adults met here for dinner this evening.     -- Of all the restaurants we visit... and we visit many... this had to be the Worst experience ever.   It's as though it's not the same restaurant where I had lunch last week!    -- Gawd... what does it take to run a restaurant well..???  -- Poor service.  Incorrect order.    -- One of the ""quality assurance managers"" is so cool, and full of himself, he's a joke and an embarrassment.  -- We joined their ""incentive club"" and were told we'd get a FREE mini-pizza for doing so.  Pizza was very good, yet we were charged for it.   -- I requested my steak be cooked ""medium.""  Instead it was Very Well Done.    -- The veggies on the plate were tiny and looked so old they appeared ""used,"" if you can imagine such a thing.   Even the Dining Room Manager agreed the veggies looked bad.   The lettuce for our pre-dinner salads seemed old and was not crisp.  -- At our table we ran out of sugar.  I had to walk around the restaurant to find someone to ask to bring us sugar.  The sugar Never arrived.  -- To ""comp"" part of our meal, the Manager said he'd buy one of us a beer.  The beer never arrived.  -- When I mentioned to the waitress And manager that my steak was Way Over Done... they agreed and offered to cook another dish.  I said thanks, but No Thank You.  A few minutes later another steak and baked potato was delivered to the table.   -- During this entire encounter, dishes and coffee cups stacked-up on the table.  With all the visits from the waitress, the ""quality assurance manager"" and the Dining Room Manager, one would imagine a few dishes or coffee cups would be ""bussed.""    Not one dish... nor coffee cup... nor sugar-wrapper was ever removed."
