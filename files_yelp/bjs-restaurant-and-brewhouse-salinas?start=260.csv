Frank M.,"Seaside, CA",31,12,6,4.0,1/28/2015,Great steaks! Bomb ass burgers! Good selections of beer. Why would you ever go to 5 guys next door. Price is pretty much the same.
Bryan L.,"Oregon City, OR",23,65,8,1.0,9/8/2012,"I'm going to keep this short. Service was just ok.  This was my first time here. I got the seafood jambalaya (a few months ago)...by 10PM that night I was up nauseous and throwing up. I'm not a puker, I haven't thrown up in like 8 years.  My stomach hurt very badly. I tried to call the restaurant and get a hold of the manager. I was told they'd call back. They never did. I used the form on their website to complain. I never heard back. I don't even want anything, no coupons or discounts or free anything at all. I just wanted to know that someone in charge over there knew I got sick. They couldn't even give me that.  I won't be back.  I don't care how good the food is, if I get sick, you get one star. (also, in fairness, the rest of my group enjoyed their food)"
Yvonne M.,"Seaside, CA",0,12,,3.0,2/15/2016,"The food wasn't really that great, especially not for the price. Horrible how dark it is in there as well. Pasta was rubbery. Meat was bland."
Krystle H.,"San Pablo, CA",5,18,23,5.0,10/20/2013,Had a really great experience at this BJs in salinas. Wait time was quick for a Saturday night. Waiter was great food was tasty. Huge selection from menu. Couldn't make up our minds. Definitely will come back as well as other locations.
Madelynn A.,"Salinas, CA",1,3,,2.0,9/24/2014,"The food is tasty! I always order their sirloin steak and it's always delicious. Unfortunately, the service is not great. It's never crowded which makes me wonder why our food and drink orders take so long?? Plus, getting your bill is another 20min wait. I just don't have an extra 4 hours in the day to eat one meal here. Bummer because I really love the food!"
Roland C.,"Salinas, CA",16,2,,1.0,9/30/2014,"Food was delicious. Had the shrimp scampi pasta. HOWEVER,the service was the pits. Super slow to get our food. Waited a long time. Then when we got our food, they forgot the utensils. Can't eat without it. Then they only got me one piece of garlic bread. Server said she would get me more. 20 minutes later, I got the bread. The first server went on break. Then we got another server. Both pretty slow. Won't be coming back anytime soon."
Vanessa D.,"Salinas, CA",68,90,,1.0,1/27/2013,"I understand that small things go wrong in restaurants, but when 10 small things go wrong in one visit it drives me absolutely crazy. We were sat down and ignored for about 10 minutes.  Someone finally came and took our drink order.  It took 5-10 more minutes for us to get waters.   We didn't have a server, we had a rotating group of about 5 people stopping by our table every ten minutes. I understand that a host might take your drink order, a server might take our order, and a food runner might bring the food... but I think it is important for there to be some consistency in the service.  There was absolutely none. I still don't know who my server was... I really hope this was just a fluke and not a new restaurant model. My turkey burger on was AWFUL.  I get turkey burgers everywhere so I know how good they can be.  This one was dreadful.  I also made the mistake of getting a whole wheat bun.  It tasted like mildew and had the consistency of a dry sponge.  I have had many tasty whole wheat buns in the past so I don't know why this place would choose to serve such gross ones.  The healthier option shouldn't automatically taste like dirt.   Anyway... I won't be going back here!"
Alex S.,"Watsonville, CA",0,19,,1.0,8/2/2016,not ever going again really bad and slow service takes forever to order food.
kathleen v.,"Salinas, CA",118,56,87,1.0,8/5/2012,"came here 5 times... 2 were to drink with family and friends the other three were to eat Their cocktail drinks: TOOO SWEET!!! My friend even decided to order a AMF cause  you cant really mess up that drink. Well, they did it was too sweet and can barely taste any alcohol. The other time were just for beers, which are okay tasting. As of FOOD... HORRRRRRIBLE all times!!! wasn't hungry the first time and ordered their small pizza that has four slices... That tasted like crap! I could have bought 2 little caesars pizza fed more people and be more satisfied!!! The other time, got the Mahi Mahi tacos... SUCKED!!! Fish was chewy, and i could barely even taste any fish because all the vegetables in it just overpowered everything. I tried giving them a 3rd try having dinner with another friend. Decided to get the pasta this time... I was sooo surprised when i first got my plate of the scampi pasta because i had a MOUNTAIN high of pasta that was practically a family serving size, but i know this just had to be too good to be true.. i take a bite.. NO TASTE AT ALL!!! felt like i was eating just boiled up pasta... tried mixing around, NOPE.. no taste still... Put salt to add flavor.. why did i bother. Waste of money!!! NEVER AGAIN... I guess this place is just good for a sit down place for some beer and pizookies Oh may i had, wait time sucks if you have more than 2 people, and there has been a time we sat at one table and they kept coming to our table with drinks desserts and soups and we kept saying we didnt order that."
Chase H.,"Salinas, CA",8,1,,4.0,2/16/2015,"Great customer service from all team members,  food is great as always.  It's a little pricey but it's a awesome treat when we can go."
Dolly R.,"Salinas, CA",6,4,1,5.0,12/19/2014,"let me begin by saying that i am an employee of this establishment. i truly enjoy serving the guests and i make sure that i go out of my way to make sure that the guests experience is like wow! we have a wonderful crew and an awesome management team! if ever you want to be treated like royalty and enjoy being catered to, come in and ask for dolly! it will be my pleasure to serve you!"
Darcie M.,"Salinas, CA",25,2,,2.0,2/11/2015,"I went for a simple dinner date with my boyfriend. We ordered an appetizer,  I ordered steak, he got fish. All was pretty good. We ordered dessert....here is what really ruined our night... the waiter brought the check before he brought our dessert and handed it to me instead of my boyfriend. When we finally decided to leave I put my jacket on and picked up my purse and before I could step away from the table the busboy was clearing the table behind me. I felt so rushed and embarrassed.  This nice dinner date turned into a nightmare.  We will never return."
Nicole T.,"Castroville, CA",0,20,,5.0,12/14/2015,place is great! food is legit! service is legit! my husband's drink was perfect. almost no wait time and it was busy. definitely will be returning here. i can understand why this place gets busy
Season F.,"Salinas, CA",16,6,2,1.0,7/17/2015,"I've come to this location several times (probably about 4 times total), in an attempt to allow them to redeem themselves, but sadly they have not. Each time I have gone there, service has been very poor. Long wait times- in one instance they forgot we were waiting outside and did not page us. We had to go back in and remind them we were there. I don't think we've ever gone there and maintained the same waiter. We always end up having to flag random waiters down, even just to pay our bill. The food is decent, but often overpriced for the amount you actually receive, especially when it comes to salad. Today, my boss went to pick up our to-go order of salads. I ordered the kale and brussel sprout salad and I received it without any brussel sprouts, no goat cheese, no onions and even the ingredients it did contain were sparse. As far as I'm concerned, not worth the $10. Very disappointing. Sorry BJ's... You're not worth it."
Renee B.,"Seaside, CA",7,10,29,5.0,8/16/2013,"The place was packed but it didn't stop the service from being great. We ordered the nachos, balsamic chicken, and the Texas style chicken fried steak. The nachos were OK but the entrees were YUMMY!!! Defiantly will be back to this location."
Sally Anne S.,"Carmel, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/30/2015,"Five girls go to dinner. Have coupons for free appetizers and dessert. Waiter takes coupons when he takes the order. He goes on break and another waiter takes over who is real snarky. When the bill comes, they do not honor one of the coupons. Said they could not be combined. Original waiter did not inform girls of this requirement. The coupons were good, not expired and girls ordered what was required to receive the discount. Not a nice experience."
David B.,"San Diego, CA",2,76,9,1.0,1/19/2015,"If you like over priced bland corporate food made with poor ingredients this is a place for you! You've got to be kidding me right? This food was a joke! Really such a disappointment because I was with a group of friends who hadn't seen each other in a long time. The whole meal and service was so lame, so Salinas."
E H.,"Watsonville, CA",12,55,10,2.0,7/28/2012,"Came here during the early week for lunch.  Firstly I would like to say as a dining experience BJ's has got some visual appeal.  The interior of the restaurant and equally pleasant outdoor ""dining patio"" may make you forget you're dining in the ""salad bowl of the world!"" Now the food...we started off with an appetizer of Crispy Calamari ($9.75) served with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli.  Presentation was wannabe pretentious, however, the calamari was overcooked, chewy with enough fried crispy crumbs (yo ho Long John Silvers) to nearly outnumber the calamari pieces.  Ok, so they have some great advertised lunch specials starting at $5.95 - Big On Flavor, Small On Price!  Depending on what you order it's more like Meh On Flavor, WTF On Price.  I literally had to follow-up this tiny meal of Half Flatbread Pizza with Salad ($6.95) with a Costco Hot Dog one hour later cuz I was still hungry.  The Flatbread Pizza was AGAIN overcooked/burned, tasteless and tasted more like a Saltine Cracker.  Despite being in the ""salad bowl of the world"" the salad was literally a small handful of mixed greens, mushy tomatoes, few carrot slivers, sprinkling of onions, and one cucumber slice wouldn't satisfy an anorexic!  Once again served on this over sized wannabe pretentious platter. My dining companion ordered the Southern Fried Chicken ($5.95) and reported being satisfied with her meal of  a small buttermilk fried chicken breast, pepper cream gravy, mashed potatoes and corn and fire-roasted red pepper succotash all layered on top of each other...wannabe pretentious once again. They do have some AYCD handcrafted old fashion soda's ($2.95) which are very nice.  The cream soda was divine and the root beer brought back some sweet childhood memories of days gone by when soda was cool! Service was a hit or miss.  The hostess was very friendly and our waiter although friendly seemed a bit dazed and confused at times.  We also got a ""bait and switch"" waiter who brought our food...wish I would have gotten his name because this dude brought on his F-game, what a jerk!  ""Homeboy"" gonna be on  the unemployment line soon...ha! Hope they step it up because wannabe pretentious didn't cut it for me."
Jazz R.,"Boise, ID",2,34,1,3.0,8/9/2014,"Great food! Good drinks! Only complaint is the server's seemed to be messing around like they were hanging out. Don't get me wrong I like a friendly atmosphere, but they were talking about other coworkers,  and how the boss was lazy, also being noisy. All in all would go back for the food!"
Irene S.,"Monterey, CA",1164,565,,5.0,6/26/2012,"I love eating here! I am so thrilled that finally there is a BJ's Brewhouse in the Monterey County.  Before, I had to go further north to eat at one of these restaurants.  Like at all BJ's Brewhouses that I have been to, the selection of food is great, the prices are reasonable, the food is consistently tasty, the atmosphere is trendy but classy, and the service is always friendly. Some of their restaurants in the further Northern regions of California have received awards. I especially love the pizza here.  There is a great selection of pizzas including a veggie one that is low calorie.  During happy hour, all the mini pizzas are half off- a great deal!  There is even a selection on the menu just devoted to low calorie meals- and these meals are not bland at all! I have had the pork, and the Thai fish. Both are very filling and tasty.  I also love the $6 quisadilla lunch special.  Yummy!!! - A price of an entree appears to range from $6 to about $15.   My boyfriend loves the large selection of ales that are available.  During Happy Hour, I believe there are deals on beer and ale.   I would also recommend trying one of their Pazookie desserts- these consist of one large cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top. I love the Ghireradelli Pazooki.  Although, now that I am eating healthier, I rarely have such desserts. By the way, if you subscribe to their free e-newsletter, you can get a free  complementary pazookie dessert on your birthdays! Pros: -franchise restaurant with great food, prices and service consistently -has rewards program and e-newsletter that sends coupons regularly  -great selection of low calorie entrees -large selection of ales and beers including seasonal brews -unique dessert - the pazookie   -good deals during happy hour Cons: -Nothing!"
