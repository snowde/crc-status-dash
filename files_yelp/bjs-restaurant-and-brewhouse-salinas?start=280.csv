Nikki N.,"Ridgecrest, CA",0,19,1,4.0,12/29/2015,"For the appetizer, the ahi poke (raw fish) is a hit or miss.  Once the fish was really good and fresh and another time it wasn't fresh.  The calamari and avocado egg roll is pretty good.  Their golden beet and argula is a nice small portion and delicious.  I really like their clam chowder bread bowl.  For entrees, I like their Mediterranean chicken pita tacos.  The ambiance and service is great.  The only reason I rated 4 stars was because of the not so fresh ahi poke.  Overall, all the food there is great and I would definitely eat there again."
Tom W.,"King City, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/28/2014,BJ'S hopefully will clean house again. Our food was horrible. My fiancé and I ordered salads and they took forever to get to us. The lettuce was brown and the chicken was burnt. Bad food and bad service. Not a good combo. Definitely gonna eat somewhere else next time.
Ami M.,"Santa Margarita, CA",4,12,3,4.0,9/7/2014,"We were seated five minutes after we arrived. Our server was very friendly and attentive. I had the bison burger, my favorite dish from BJ's. The food was delicious and prices are reasonable."
Steven C.,"Temecula, CA",0,14,,1.0,12/15/2015,"The only reason I'm giving this particular location a star at all, is because I have to. It was horrible, to say the least. And we've been to MANY BJs across the U.S. First, our server Robert seemed lazy and untrained on how to correctly do his job. We ordered two waters and calamari to start. Calamari came out cold and was missing the dipping sauces. Told the server, he said he'd refire it and we also ordered chips and queso to go along with it. We then placed entree orders (guac burger, hickory brisket burger). We waited and waited and waited for the new calamari, and mind you we were still waiting on the chips and queso (which should come out before, it doesn't take that long) and we never NEVER got water refills. (We had to get our food runner to grab them). So new calamari comes out (much better this time) but old calamari dish (with calamari still on it) is still on the table. We eat calamari. Slide to the side with other dish. Chips and queso comes out 15 minutes later than the calamari, along with the burgers. (Calamari plates still there). Chips and queso were cold but we suffered through it. My burger (hickory brisket) was missing the BRISKET of all things and had no mayo on it. Fiancé's burger (guac) was missing the chipotle mayo on it. We got the stuff we needed about 10 minutes later so we were eating the cold chips and queso. So we add our toppings and cut the burgers in half (calamari plates get taken away finally) and the burgers are raw (we order medium well) and cold. So we tell the server, he brings the manager over, we tell him, we get it taken care of. The server has redeemed himself at this point, he seems less lazy and more friendly. So, to top it off, it's my birthday and I ordered a chocolate chunk pizookie. So I'm guessing the theme of the night was cold and raw because my pizookie was just complete dough with ice cream on top. The dish it comes in (usually unbearably hot) isn't even warm. So, I'd have to say, all in all, this was the most horrific experience I've ever had at any restaurant in my entire life, worldwide (because I've traveled and even third world countries had better food and service).  So, I'll never return to BJs, at least this location (which sucks because we love BJs and the area as we're going to be here often for work). Sorry for the long post, but someone needed to know. (We ripped our waiter Robert 20% of what the original bill should've been because we were giving him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he was overwhelmed with the three tables he had, who by the way, we're just as upset with service as us because he kept forgetting their food/drinks from the bar and refills).  Thank you."
Amber M.,"Salinas, CA",1,52,4,2.0,4/4/2014,"Service was bad/slow. The food was ok at best. The place is always noisey and dirty. Been there a few times and it just never seemed to improve. God forbid you put in a pick up order, they will screw it up every time."
Tristan Greg U.,"Salinas, CA",25,39,5,2.0,2/13/2014,"I don't think I need to say more. If your in a mood to wait for food and pay for bad service, ENJOY! Otherwise visit a different BJ's in another city. This BJ's is not worth the visit unless leadership authority in this BJ's location changes."
Ben D.,"Salinas, CA",7,56,7,2.0,6/10/2012,"A small group of us (6) went here for lunch recently.  We got there early, the dining room was basically empty.  We were seated promptly.  That's when the promptness stopped. We waited about an hour for our food.  Even then, it came out in phases.  The waitress said this was due to the fact two of the meals had been dropped in the kitchen.  I'm guessing the waitress forgot to put our tag in when she took the order. The manager came out (at the end, when we were paying) to see how things were going.  I told him it was way too slow.  He clapped his hands, said something about getting ""this show on the road"" and walked away like that was gonna help. Parts of the meal were OK, but it was mostly lacking.  My BBQ beef sandwich was slapped together, and looked unprofessional.  The fries were cold.  The sodas were all ice, with a sip or two of soda between refills.  My companions reported similar issues with their burgers and fries, including overdone meat. I've had to-go pizza from BJ's a couple times and it was excellent.  That's why I was so shocked at the horrible experience I had in the actual restaurant.  I've heard that the Salinas BJ's is having issues keeping a decent manager and the whole restaurant suffers for it.  From what I saw, I wouldn't find that hard to believe. I might be willing to give them one more chance in a couple months.  If they drop the ball then, I'd be done for good."
Candee B.,"Salinas, CA",9,11,2,1.0,5/17/2013,Okay been here twice and twice I got sick. At first you think that maybe it wasn't food but the second time my boyfriend wanted to eat there and he got sick too. The first time I had a shrimp noodle dish and it took forever for them to bring it out even though the place wasn't busy. And the second time we only had appetizers which took almost an hour to get to us. I don't know what they are doing back there in the kitchen and I don't wanna know. The drinks are amazing so I would have a drink at the bar but I'm NOT eating the food  from this place. It really is a shame because the atmosphere of this place is pretty great just not worth a stomach upset.
Gilberto B.,"Gonzales, CA",2,5,,1.0,5/12/2013,"NEVER AGAIN!!! I have gone to BJ's before and the experience was ok. They over cooked my steak and my kids meals were not great. It was opening month, so I thought it was just the staff trying to learn the ropes. I went back, enjoyed the bar experience, but the side dishes were bland. Mother's Day, our party of 8, 2 kids included, the wait was 30-40 minutes. No big deal, expected since it was Mother's Day. 45 minutes rolled by and with my BJ's pager in hand went to ask how much longer. Two girls looked at their screens, one said that I was put on the list, the other could not find me. My name had been dropped. I asked if I was going to be made to wait another 30-40 minutes. The hostess turned around and as if no big deal replied, ""yes"". No apology offered or even a hint showing that they cared. My kids being hungry and hungry kids don't do well waiting, I turned around and left very upset telling them thanks but NO THANKS! We went to a competitors establishment and happily dropped down $300 for the meal. BJ's has been a disappointment since it opened. Why should I be surprised now."
Geri F.,"Las Vegas, NV",205,57,58,4.0,7/20/2012,"Pizookie love! Honestly, eating here.... I forgot I was in Salinas. The building on the outside and inside is nice. It's a got a revolving door, which is sort of out-of-place for Salinas, but I thought it was an elegant touch. The inside is designed to make the place look bigger than it actually is.... cool.  It's not bad... the steak tastes like steak... the potatoes are pretty huuge. :3 and the sandwiches, which my friend had, are pretty good as well. GET A PIZOOKIE FOR DESSERT! IT'S ABOSOLUTELY DELICIOUS - THE WARM COOKIE MIXED WITH COLD ICE CREAM...whooooo."
Janet M.,"Monterey, CA",88,6,,1.0,12/4/2015,We went for lunch. The service was so slow two customers walked out. The server took 10 minutes just to take our order.  It took over 25 minutes just to get our food. My gluten free pizza wasn't hot. This is the second time I have went to this restaurant. I hope the service gets better or we won't be going back. I left feedback on their company website and no one responded. Staff members were walking around the restaurant. It makes me wonder what was going on in the kitchen.
Cali M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,84,6,4.0,9/21/2012,"We tried this restaurant and loved the food.. loved the ambiance and loved the hip environment.. they have a great selection of all different kinds of brews, as well as tasting serving sizes for the light drinker that just wants to try a sample.  There are tons of appetizers to choose from and they are all really good.  You can order appetizers in sample portions, as well, which I loved!  We especially loved the Thai lettuce wraps, avocado spring rolls and caprese salad. Everything was really delicious and the service was also great! The only downfall was that there were a lot of empty tables with a lot of people waiting to be seated.  The hostess stated it was due to not enough staff to wait all the tables.  Possibly they are working on this? Other than that, it was great and we will return!"
Theresa C.,"Hollister, CA",33,134,47,3.0,4/20/2014,"Typical main stream restraunt. High prices and small like servings; think dennys. But I do like the atmosphere though very mod hip place to be! If I wanted to stop somewhere  on the weekend with some friends,chances are id probably stop here first."
Rob L.,"Lincoln, CA",13,6,,1.0,10/3/2015,"Disaster!!! I will say that the manager was a good guy, and explained to us that they had three people call out in the kitchen (on a Saturday night). At first I thought we were super lucky - after being told they were on a 10-15 minute wait, we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Waitress checked in to let me know she'd be right with us, and after 5 or so minutes she was. We were being patient as it was Saturday night, and it was busy (my wife and I both worked restaurant jobs as kids, so we get it). Drinks came relatively quickly, then we placed our order. 10 minutes later our original waitress told us she was going on a meal break and introduced our new server. Then we waited for over an hour for our food. When we were finally able to flag down our waitress, she apologized and went to find out what happened to our order. A few minutes later my wife's food and my youngest son's food were brought to the table. Then my dish and my oldest son's fries came out, but no entrée for him (did I mention it was his 12th birthday?). Over three minutes later his food came out. By this time my wife had summoned the manager, who was having a rough night. He was very apologetic and did comp our food. This place is huge, and I think they have just too much going on - they offer call-in order service and they bring it to your car in specified parking spots. As I was leaving, I wondered aloud how many cars had been served while we sat there waiting. Again, I was impressed with the manager and his demeanor on such a challenging night, as well as his jumping right to a strong solution. But with a kitchen running 3 people short, maybe tell people that drive-up / take out orders will not be accepted due to the inability to take care of patrons in the restaurant."
David L.,"Salinas, CA",0,16,,3.0,5/19/2012,"My wife and I had lunch here yesterday.  It was about 11:30 on a Friday and we were seated right away!  Our waiter was friendly and attentive and our drinks arrived promptly (my soda was a little on the flat side but tolerable).   It was about 25 minutes after we ordered that I looked at my watch and mentioned to wife that I hoped it wouldn't be too much longer.  Suddenly, a manager appeared and apologized for the delay.  The odd thing was that we hadn't complained and I didn't really think that 25 minutes was that excessive.  Did he see me look at my watch or does he just routinely apologize to everyone?  Then our waiter came and also appoligized and asked if he could get my wife a second glass of wine... I had the lunch special with 1/2 grilled California grilled chicken sandwich and chicken tortilla soup.  The soup was excellent but the portion was way too small.  The sandwich was good but a bit on the soggy side and the bread was so soft that my fingers poked though.   I requested fruit instead of fries.  They were obvioulsy from a can so I won't be having that again.  My wife had a lunch flatbread pizza with salad that I also thought was kind of on the small side.   Next time we'll get some appetizers first. When the bill came, my wife was suprised that she was charged for the second glass of wine - she thought the offer was a comp.  She pointed that out to waiter and he had it removed from the bill without any hassle (we gave him a nice tip)."
Kari D.,"Seaside, CA",10,108,12,3.0,4/30/2012,"Went here last night and it was PACKED. Thats not unusual, BJ's is a great restaurant and it is pretty new. I've been to several on the West Coast and was really happy that they opened one in the area.  When we got there, it was about 5:30..yes pretty early for dinner to me. It was packed as hell and I think the space between the revolving door and the hostess counter is too small. Since a lot of people came with like 12 + people in their party it was quite a wait to even ask for a table. But since it was just the 2 of us, we were seated in 15 min. What attracts us to B'J's is the beer, and the food. DUH. But its cool that they are also a brewery, so we can taste the different types of beer thats not mainstream, as my boyfriend and I are broadening our horizons. Anyways, one of the the beer that is ""back"" for a limited time is the oasis amber. We asked our server what he could compare it to, what it tastes like. He had no idea and couldn't suggest anything. We ordered it anyway and recieved it 15 min later...which is whatever but we tasted it, and it was not exactly an oasis...it tasted bland and had no summery notes, no citrus, hops just nothing. Wish we would have known...I was hoping for like a longboard, landshark or lost coast type of beer.  We got our food, but they forgot my salad, I got it and then 15 minutes later they came back with the same salad. Pizza was good as usual. They do need to improve the service, of all the B'J's I've been to, San Jose is still my favorite and if they are going to sell and brew their own beer, the servers need to be knowledgable."
R. A.,"Monterey, CA",3,72,1,2.0,8/1/2012,"I'm from the Sac area, where we have several BJ's, I've been to this location 3 times now, each time hoping it will be better but it just never is.  Today our server was super sweet (more than I can say for the last time we were here, when the girl spent more time sitting at a table with her boyfriend than serving her tables). Our food took FOREVER! Our server apologized a few times, but the bottom line is that no one should ever have to wait 45 min for lunch. We went around 2pm and they were not busy, there was no rush of people, there is no good reason it should have taken so long. When the food did come my sandwich had way too much sauce on it and hardly any chicken, but I was starving and didn't want to wait for them to fix it.  When I worked in a restaurant, a manager would come by the table when the food was backed up to apologize and make sure the guests had what they needed for the time being, we never saw anyone. It would have been a small gesture that would have made a big difference (what would have been even better was if they GASP! bought our drinks or sent out a dessert) I don't think I'll be back here any time soon."
M G.,"Pacific Grove, CA",5,141,91,5.0,8/23/2014,"Came here again and again we were not disappointed!!   Went with the lunch special.   1/2 flat bread pizza with a small salad.   One Margarita pizza and one California club pizza....both very, very good.   The salad was fresh and good BUT could have used a little bit more of the balsamic dressing.   The house made rootbeer IS AMAZING!!!   My wife had the the Scottish Ale (not sure of the exact name) and loved it.   We ended the meal as we always do with a pizzookie!!  Other restaurants try to imitate this dessert and fail.......BJ is the expert at the pizzookie!!  Our server was attentive and great.  The host who met us at the door was welcoming.  Another great experience.  Next time we are going to try their happy hour which starts at 3 and they have great drink and food specials!!!!"
Sarah C.,"Marina, CA",109,141,8,4.0,7/12/2012,"Switched the server on us? Avocado spring rolls... yummy! The sauce with them was quite good too, though I liked them better without it. Our waiter was good and was getting a little help from what looked to be more senior staff. And she was nice and friendly. The flatbread pizza was good. Dough was chewy and tender. The burger was HUGE and the fries it came with was an ample portion. Not like other places that give you 4 for your side. It feels kinda like a cheesecake factory rip off esp with the 30 page menu but everything looked and tasted delicious like them too. We will return."
Matt R.,"Millbrae, CA",32,37,12,5.0,4/19/2014,"Had a great time here with my friend, we got the four beer tester with BJ's own brewed beers and they were delish. We had the blonde, berry cider,  ipa, and red. Highly recommend the blonde or the cider. We both had a burger, specifically the deluxe and the black and bleu. Very good and prices were really cheap. They also have their own home made root beer which was spectacular"
