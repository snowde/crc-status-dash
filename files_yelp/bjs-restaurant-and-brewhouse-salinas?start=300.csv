Dianna M.,"Prunedale, CA",129,238,632,4.0,7/2/2012,Jevana knows her stuff! Thanks for the advice on food and beer. We had a wonderful time.
Kenneth S.,"Salinas, CA",1,10,,1.0,2/26/2013,If you enjoying customer service of any nature chances are you will not be finding it here.   I now have been dragged to this establishment a number of times by my wife in hopes of change.  Lunch time with not a soul in sight you will often have your order given to you not correct and barely warm. Dinner is pretty much the same as lunch with the exception that there are more people dinning.   I am over this place.  Was really hoping that it was just the opening few months that was making the service lack.  Not the case anymore being open for so long.
Charles H.,"Salinas, CA",6,59,34,3.0,7/8/2015,"Service was very good until our server went on break (which she informed us). Then it fell short of okay.  Relief staff brought our meal which was prepared pretty good but no flatware or napkins and difficult to get servers attention to ask. I got up after 10 minutes of waiting and located some from another table. New burger on menu advertised with house Aoli.... none on sandwich and when ordered as side afterward it showed up but was just straight mayonnaise. Happy hour drinks are listed as ""Call"" liquor $4. Spending many years as a bartender it's pretty standard that a call is a label/name brand. Ordered a Sapphire tonic. Charged $8. asked manager who informed Sapphire is premium. I asked what would be considered ""Call""? - Jack Daniels. LOL! A bit of confusion there but he did make adjustment on bill. All in all it was more comical than frustrating. Service needs improvement but food was okay."
Tulipanes R.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",4,13,1,1.0,11/24/2013,"Worst. Place. Ever. We were here on Wednesday early evening, not a busy night at all. We were sitting at our booth without a waiter for at least 20 minutes. I had to walk over to the ""hostess"" and ask for menus and they looked offended when I asked. When our waiter brought out appetizers, we had to grab the utensils from the booth next to ours since we had none. We waited for our food for 30 min, that's when our waiter came over and explained he had accidentally pressed on the ""hold order"" button but would try to get our food out ASAP. Come here if you want bad service and shitty over priced food."
J. Leigh L.,"Monterey, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/30/2015,"Checked-in waited.  Others parties seated.  Checked-in waited.  Other parties seated.  Taken to table.  Seat, clearly not cleaned after the last party left, covered in crumbs.  Brushed off.  Told hostess.  She seemed indifferent but said she would bring something to clean seat.  By the time see returned with a dirty dishtowel, I had done what I could and brushed what I could off.  Then she asked me if I wanted her to clean the seat.  FYI hostess:  do not ask you customers if they want you to clean up something, just tell them you are going to.  At any rate, I took the dirty towel and wiped down the seat.  The hostess seemed fine with this arrangement.  After all why should she have to wipe down a seat. Waited another ten minutes for someone to arrive at the table.  Actually, I needed to summons someone by raising my hand and shaking it in the air until I say wait staff.  The fact that I had to wait after being seated was utterly confusing because, while I was waiting to be seated, there were always three or four of the wait staff hovering around the hostess desk looking like they needed something to do.  At last a very nice member of the wait staff (Missy) arrived at our table.  After she took my drink order and delivered it to the table, I overheard another member of the wait staff ask her if she wanted to keep our table or not.  I am not sure why since no one else was interested in helping.  Maybe the person that asked was supposed to be the server.  Who knows but the staff is in clear need of training. On to the food (after more waiting and the dinnerware finally arriving):  the menu is ok and quite similar to a Chili's or Applebee's with a wider selection of beer and slightly higher prices.  I ordered something call the top sirloin.  The portion of the steak was on the small side for the price and a bit salty.  The portion of the two sides that accompany the meal was downright sad.  I received on scope of a rice pilaf concoction the flavor or, um, salt and about eight very tired and very old and wrinkly pieces of asparagus that did not have the woody ends cut from them and overwhelmingly tasted like, you guessed it, salt.   On to the meal of the other's in the party:  one wrong and one inedible.  On the milder side, on order arrived with the incorrect side dish.  The server allowed the diner to keep the incorrect one and promptly arrived with the correct one.  The most abysmal meal was the one that could not be eaten, a mahi mahi dish.  When it arrived, the diner asked if it was salmon because of the very strong fishy smell.  The serve advised that it was mahi mahi and that if it were the salmon it would have been a larger portion.  An odd thing to say to a customer.  At any rate, there was a short-lived attempt to eat the mahi mahi because the first bit was promptly spit into one of the small drink napkins provided.  I was asked to taste it and, after seeing the reaction after a full bite, requested only a flake of fish, which was quite enough.  The mahi mahi tasted old, metallic, and somewhat fermented.  When Missy arrived back at the table apologized and took a new order.  The manager eventually arrived at the table as well stating he was sorry and that they were trying to find out how long the mahi mahi had been around and how it had been handled during its time at BJs.   The second dish arrived and was consumed.  From what I was told and overheard being told to Missy, it was good.  I did not try any nor was I at the table while it was being eaten.  I was in the nicely tiled bathroom violently defecating my meal.   At any rate, after two unconfirmed cases of food poisoning I received no discount from the bill, will not be returning BJ's ever again, and cannot recommend dining there either."
Thomas F.,"Salinas, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/23/2014,"I really like BJ's Restaurant. Good atmosphere and I've always had great service here. The food is very tasty and a huge menu of items to choose from so there should be something for everyone. Their beers are definitely worth a taste and if you're driving, their soda's aren't bad either."
A. D.,"Salinas, CA",3,24,,1.0,10/21/2015,"This place is horrible! Everything about it! The service, wait time, food, price! It's time to put a new restaurant in it's location. This restaurant has been up and going too long for it to suck this bad! You have to chase people down to get something to drink- let alone a refill! Forget it! When you find someone to take your order be prepared to wait forever and when it finally does come out it's disgusting! Do not go here!"
Joel C.,"Salinas, CA",26,8,3,1.0,12/22/2013,Horrible waiter. Lareyna was her name. Never smiled and was rude the whole time. Even closed out our tab with out even asking us. Got annoyed when we asks to split tab.
Marc M.,"Salinas, CA",74,53,3,4.0,4/28/2012,"I went here the first weekend that it opened. Actually this would be my first time being at Bj's and lucky me, they opened one close to my area.  So being the first weekend, it was guaranteed to be packed. Friday night a lot of locals want to try something new in the area. Waiting time was 2+ hours especially if your party has 6 or more.  Like I said, this is my first time being at a Bj's so I'm not sure how others looked like, but this one was really great. Even with the full house, it was set up nicely. But I'm not sure if having security was standard, or it's just in Salinas? I'm not sure.. but either take it as being safe while eating your pazookie! LOL! Oh yeah, WTF? Pazookie?? It feels like they just baked a cookie and straight put ice cream on top! Damn!! But that was genius!!!!! Service was great, but my friend didn't think so. LOL! Since the bar was packed with drunk people, unfortunately her beer sampler was lost within the crowd! LOL! I think she was just upset because her order came in last when she ordered first out of everyone. But the waiter was very apologetic and very nice. She made sure to try to get our orders to us right away after that. Also, I'm not really sure about the service that walks between the aisle. I understand that they have to take your plates and glasses so there would be more room on the table, but damn! Let me finish my drink first!!!  Food, well I just shared a chicken potato with my friend, because we're really just into drinking that night. But the beers were great. We tried the blondes and the brunettes (I'm a brunette kinda guy) and they were good. (Common sense, blondes for light beer and brunette for dark beer) We also tried the seasonal beer which was Oasis. That was great. Got two pitchers of those! All in all, This place would be a regular place to hang out and chill right after work or just have dinner with friends. Happy hour is between 3pm-7pm at the bar Monday thru Friday (well that's what the waitress told me) So it's perfect!!"
Rebecca V.,"Marina, CA",2,37,3,4.0,10/1/2014,"I actually quite like this place, despite the negative reviews, but perhaps that's because I have only ever been at lunch time? Servers are always quick, pleasant and polite, even sociable, and I have liked almost everything I have had there- certainly better than Chilis or Applebees. I tend to get the chicken pita tacos, which are great. It seems to be prepared two different ways by two different chefs, because I have had it both ways repeatedly there, but despite the inconsistency the dish still tastes great, so I don't complain."
Jeff C.,"San Juan Bautista, CA",0,47,,1.0,12/13/2013,"Service is horrible, the food comes out cold, and the drink prices aren't listed on the menu. This place is all hype."
Vishal V.,"Stockton, CA",8,67,3,2.0,4/9/2012,"Ok, where to begin.  The food was adequate, drinks were good, and the service was garbage.  That's a pretty good summary of my experience. The problem is is that they are new, and when you are new, you suck. Especially at service. Food, however, was pretty good, and beer was also well-made. So, come here for the drinks, not necessarily the food, and certainly not the service."
Kristin B.,"Mountain View, CA",1,19,1,3.0,6/6/2015,"The bartenders were great, and some of the other staff seemed competent. Our waitress was completely clueless. She was confused about almost everything we said and appeared to be totally oblivious all evening.  Good beer though, and one of the better atmospheres in Salinas.  I'll probably be back, even with the sub-standard waitress, next time I'm in the area."
Kristine C.,"Salinas, CA",120,36,22,1.0,9/9/2013,Pretty much every time I've dined here the food took an obscene amount of time to get to the table. This has got to be the slowest kitchen in all of Salinas.. & the food def does not warrant the wait.
Samantha C.,"Aptos, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/11/2015,MANAGEMENT SUCKS!!  I think Corporate needs the reevaluate the people they hire to run their business into the ground.
Marleen B.,"Royal Oaks, CA",361,6,,1.0,12/12/2013,Took my mother in law there for lunch today. Service was terrible. We both ordered soup & salad & it took 45 min. Probably would have been longer except I finally asked someone to get our waitperson. When it finally came the order was wrong so had to wait again. The menu said there was a special price on beers so we ordered one. When the bill came I was charged full price. When I asked she said it was only at the bar. My response was that it shouldn't be put in the menu then. She made the correction. I have been there a few times and only once was the service good. Won't go back for another long time.   My question is where is the manager??
Rick G.,"Salinas, CA",383,4,5,4.0,2/25/2014,"Had a wonderful experience, yet again.  The Executive Chef and Manager came over and said hello.  Our Server Pedro was also excellent this particular visit, the best I've had here.  With all the bad reviews below, just ask for this guy, and he'll make sure your visit is great, but I do have to agree that sometimes the service is slow.  I definitely recommend BJ's to all my friends."
JMarielb C.,"Seaside, CA",1,30,5,4.0,5/26/2012,"First time in the new Salinas location and had a GREAT time. I was there last night with my work girlfriends, party of 5.  It looked like a long wait so we just hung out in the bar with a beer until a booth cleared and voila, waited only 20 minutes. This trick works great at every BJ' s I've visited, LOL... I have BJ's hopped all over Cali and I was not disappointed in Salinas.  A couple of flight of beers between a bunch of us girls was perrrfect, the bruschetta appetizers and spring rolls were fab.  The highlight of the evening was the Mediterranean Pizza, pesto, feta cheese, chicken and that signature fluffy bread-HEAVEN! I am obviously thrilled to have BJ s so close by, I no longer have to take a 1.5 hour drive to San Jose for this treat!  I plan to be back often....."
Erika V.,"Salinas, CA",59,37,36,3.0,1/13/2014,"Im torn between 3 and 4 stars because the food is good but service is not so good. Wide selection of food, I usually play it safe and order items that have visuals on the menu, haha. However expect a huge wait time! for some reason it always seems like their waiters are in training, they're like all over the place. I'd go back..."
Jem P.,"Salinas, CA",2,7,5,1.0,3/14/2016,"It was pi day and I went to eat and have their pizzokie. This place is a hit or miss, however I have shared more misses and today was one of them. Granted when they have promos it will be busy and it was, the part that annoyed me the most was that we placed our order right away: egg rolls and flatbread.  It took 35 mins to get flatbread and was told the egg rolls didn't meet their standard?! The lady next to us sat 10 minutes after us, and ordered a steak and received her food before us.  I don't blame the servers cause they are the front end, but seriously annoyed.  The manager took care of it, but this is like the 3rd time a manager took care of it, but it's just disappointing, and the server didn't even ask if we wanted the pizzokie.  No wonder BJs needs to give free stuff or 20% off things or give movie tickets because how in the hell are they gonna get people to go in.  I should have just went to 5 guys next door and had a milkshake. People should only when it is super slow."
