Jess C.,"Salinas, CA",0,6,1,2.0,3/19/2013,"I went there the other day, Food was very bland. I ordered the Chicken Marsala. The Strawberry Margarita was the best thing I had there.  I wouldn't count on food being fresh and flavorful."
T F.,"Salinas, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/4/2015,"I've been here several times in the past year and only one time have we had decent service.  Our last visit, we were at the restaurant for 1 hour and 45 minutes.  We spent at least 30 minutes waiting for our food (My boyfriend was able to order, leave, go to big 5 down the street, shop and return and our food still wasn't at the table).  The restaurant wasn't that full so I don't understand why the service was so slow.  The server barely checked in with us and didn't bother to acknowledge the teenager in our group at all (no offer of a drink refill or a glass of water or anything).  I had hoped over time the service would get better but it seems like this place isn't going to improve.  Disappointing because the food is actually decent."
Dawn C.,"Marina, CA",63,49,124,3.0,11/10/2013,Decided to go here despite our previous bad experiences...we had an excellent server :-) we ordered the Thai lettuce wraps to start yum yum yum soo good! My hubby ordered the breakfast pizza Huge!! I ordered the pub bacon cheeseburger that was really good. The only negative is that one consistent thing here is the food always takes forever whether it's appetizers or entrees sometimes wait up to 30 minutes and today was no exception...Otherwise good was excellent service was excellent...
Sergio G.,"San Francisco, CA",53,4,,1.0,4/19/2014,"Gone there more than one occasion, the servers just don't know how to be professional. I asked for a mudslide and about 4 attempts to make one I finally asked them just to give me a Long Island. Once again drink was horrible. I just asked a  coke since they can't mess that up."
Morgan A.,"Los Angeles, CA",175,32,2,2.0,11/8/2013,"OMG the food is consistent but the service sucks. The one blonde with curly hair has to carry all the other incompetent servers. Smh I love bjs, but not salinas'"
Dick R.,"Monterey, CA",0,13,3,2.0,12/26/2014,"the women bartenders in there at night, are rude.   They have attitudes and give really bad service.  I will go elsewhere"
Jassgirl B.,"Pacifica, CA",0,9,2,3.0,4/12/2014,"Decided to come here after our big bike race. When we first walked in we were greeted by a very happy hostess told us it would be a few minutes. After we were seated our waiter Vincent was great, after brining our drinks. When getting our appetizers we asked the heavyset lady for ranch and she told us who's your waiter I'll tell him ugh rude. We then noticed our good was taking kinda long so Vincent managed to grab us some salads and apologized no biggie. The heavyset lady finally bought us are good and again was rude we said thank you and she just ignored us again. Both of the burgers were wrong but Vincent was very quick to fix it and within mins we were choking down. Overall we had a great time just maybe tell her to check her attitude. Vincent on the other hand was amazing.."
Rey T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/17/2013,Service sucks. Waited 50 minutes for our food.  Dont waist your time here.  Not even a busy night but waited for food that was sub par.  Never again
John B.,"Salinas, CA",0,5,,2.0,9/16/2013,"Went for dinner on September 7th.  Not too crowded and didn't have to wait long.  The server dumped a glass of ice water on the table and my lap (my wife and out of town brother were spared).   We ordered calamari appetizer and told the sever it wasn't that good.  She made a sad face and said sorry, but that was about it.   Ordered burger with blue cheese and it was good.  All three burgers were good. When we got the bill we observed it was full price, but at least she didn't charge for the ice she dumped on me."
Orlando L.,"Salinas, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/6/2015,"Went for my birthday last night with a large party. Everything was great. The service, the drinks, the food, everything went very well. I'm very happy I made the choice of having my birthday dinner there. I'll be returning."
Bear S.,"Salinas, CA",3,16,9,2.0,11/2/2013,"Food is good bar food, however, the service is not horrendous and the kitchen is real slow. The last 3 times, the good has been over a 45 minute wait. Last visit they lost our order with only 10 people in the restaurant. Over an hour wait for food."
Troy F.,"Salinas, CA",50,3,,1.0,12/2/2013,"Absolute worst restaurant experience ever, I will never go back or recommend this location to anybody. Made a large party reservation for 10 got a table that seats 7.  It took 30 min to get first round of drinks and half where wrong, took another 20 min to get those fixed.  It took over an hour to get appetizer, food showed up 5 min later.  Food tasted like it was reheated in a micro wave.  Got charged for drinks we didn't order.  Manager was an idiot.  Monday night football with the Niners playing and only one bartender for about 150 people.   They need a whole new staff."
Debbie R.,"Reno, NV",0,8,,3.0,1/2/2015,"We ate lunch here on New Year's Day. There were many empty seats and the service was still slow. The waitress was quite nice and friendly and there appears to be a very full bar selection. The decor is very nice and there are large TV's around with the volume off to watch sports. The menu is exceedingly extensive, including gluten-free choices. The quality of our food was very good and we will definitely return. Hubby had Mediterranean ""Tacos"" and I had the Lemon Thyme Chicken from the Enlightened Menu. Both were delicious. My only complaint is the slow service. 10 minutes for waitress to arrive after being seated, another 10 minutes waiting for 1 beer, then waited about 20-25 minutes for our food (approximation)."
Alana K.,"Marina, CA",45,26,3,4.0,3/3/2014,Our server Derek was awesome! We came in for a quick dinner before our movie and everything came out super quick! Everything tasted wonderful and we even got a free small pazookie :) we are both stuffed and ready to go watch out movie. will def return!
Arci M.,"Seaside, CA",2,19,13,1.0,7/8/2012,"07/08/2012  The food was decent, however the service was BAD BAD on todays visit. We ordered appetizers (avocado eggrolls) which came out, our drinks however didnt, we reminded the waitress... our salad and soup came out, still no drinks, we asked yet again, finally I got my Arnold Palmer, my boyfriend however still waiting for his beer! Dinner comes out, yep still waiting for the beer! Waitress finally brings the beer as our dinner is getting cold, she gives a half-hearted apology.  We mentioned it to manager who barely acknowledged us and said: ""he was not going to give us free alcohol"" without giving an apology, and marched off without giving us a chance to respond.  Once waitress brought bill, I told her she was not receiving a tip because of bad service. We had to remind her repeatedly about our drinks. Her manager was rude and could've at least offered a discount on our bill. (even a sincere apology would've been appreciated) Not coming back! They can BJ themselves. Gonna stick to Monterey Brewing Co. on South Main St."
Maureen S.,"Salinas, CA",5,8,2,5.0,3/5/2014,Super fun and great service! They handled all 33 of us with care and great service! Food was excellent!
Xochitl V.,"Watsonville, CA",44,27,10,4.0,2/9/2014,"Food was very good. Service was wonderful, never disappoints us. My Atlantic salmon was so tasty."
Susan B.,"Salinas, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/24/2012,"Went to BJ's last night for the  2nd time.  Same exact experience....wait was not long which was good but the rest no so good.  Can not recommend this place.  Food did not come as ordered.  I admit I changed the menu a bit but really not that much.  The waitress never noticed that the order did not come as ordered.  We ordered an appetizer that was delivered to the wrong table.  The server did not notice until we brought it to her attention.  Then it was brought when our main meal was brought to the table.  The food was so so, my husbands meal was not as expected either. Server was polite and friendly but was a bit pushy when it came to ordering the food. I guess there is fine line on taking the order and taking too long to come  back to order but she was just a bit over zealous."
Irma H.,"Monterey, CA",0,44,,4.0,2/21/2014,My husband and I enjoyed the bison burger which was very good. The burger was juicy and flavorful . Mario the server was just a pleasure. Highly recommend BJ's in Salinas.
Rudy M.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,1,1.0,3/13/2016,I have been to bj's twice before at the one in San Jose. Food was great service was great. So when they opened one where i live i was beyond happy. I raved to my wife about how good this place was since she's never been. So i took her for valentines day and got the worst service and food was just ok. I understand its valentines but still need to try and be intentive. So i went back this year giving it a second Chance. Let me tell you it only got worse. They were not busy at all. We sat down waited 30 min no waiter or waitress ever came by to say hi. I asked a bus boy if he could find our server he said yes left came back and said they are coming. It took another 30 min and still no serve. Then the manager passed by i flagged him down and told him what was going on and he apologized and took our drink order. Our server finally comes over and says sorry there was a shift change. We said fine we ordered our food and appetizer we get the appetizer but no plate or silverware. We wait 15 more min now our food comes. I'm missing my bake potato. I let the person know who brought our food since it wasn't our server. She said let me check on that. My server then comes i tell her that i am missing my bake potato. She says let me get that. I NEVER seen her again. Another server comes to our table says she's our new server for the remainder of the night. I tell her i am still missing my bake potato. She apologies and says let me go get that. Just like that NEVER seen her again. I had to get the manager and tell him about my situation and ask for the bill. He's reply i guess you had a bad experience from beginning to end and apologized and took care of our meal. Which was nice but i rather pay and get treated like i matter. Mind you all of this happened on a unbusy night. I mean more then half the building was empty. If i ever wanted bj's i rather drive more then 50 miles to get treated like i matter.
