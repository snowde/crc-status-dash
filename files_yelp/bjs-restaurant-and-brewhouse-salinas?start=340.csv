Nick C.,"Salinas, CA",4,43,233,2.0,12/8/2013,"Well I went back this time last Tuesday with my nephew, my niece, and my sister too, I didn't really catch whom are waitress was because as soon as I got there I probably Saw her twice; once when brought the drinks then to bring them and I know that it take time cook then but all four of us order a three-course meal so 25 minutes later got up and find a server ask if get our salads and soups that we order in a refill on our drinks please. He ask who our server was and I said I don't know she has a been around twenty-five minutes as soon as I got this gentleman he took care of us got the soup and salad and then five minutes later he brought us our main course then after all of that we're done with our meal she finally came over and say oh how was your meal and we all looked at her funny ask four to go  boxes. Whatever you do do not sit in the far room and before I go back I'd be calling see if Stanley the manager working first."
KW D.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,5.0,5/3/2015,"Our 4th or 5th time at BJs.  Food always good, service always prompt.  This time, however, we had a waiter worth heavily tipping & singing the praises of.  Next time you go, be sure to sit in Moises' section!"
Arcelia H.,"Greenfield, CA",12,1,,1.0,5/3/2015,"Ordered a Ceasers Salad, literally got half a head of lettuce (not romaine), 5 croutons and maybe a teaspoon of dressing in a giant bowl.  My server looked very annoyed and rolled her eyes when I asked to have it changed for an alternate side."
Heidi D.,"Salinas, CA",196,8,3,5.0,5/13/2013,Oh my goodness the Bison Burger is amazing and our server Frank was on it!  I love going on Tuesdays...wine is 1/2 off all day.
J S.,"Marina, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2014,"If I would have remembered to check YELP before booking a party here I would have chosen elsewhere. The ONLY reason I gave the rating of one is because the food wasn't that bad and the staff appeared to be friendly....However, the lack of service and the very slow service wipes out the friendliness of the staff. If the food wasn't decent, I would give a flat ZERO stars.  So, I reserved a party for up to 20. It ended up being about 12 or 13. I understand that sometimes larger parties are harder to handle and sometimes a little slower. But, the restaurant was kind of dead. We actually had up to 3 waiters at our party, which actually made it worse. Two people received pretty decent service, 4 others ok service and the others were left wondering what we need to do to get service. For most of the dinner, we have empty appetizer plates and empty glasses. Two guests waited about 30 min for dinner. Mind you, the restaurant was NOT busy. I also never received an appetizer plate I ordered. I was so disgusted towards the end of the evening I had to voice my concern to the manager. THIS is where I REALLY got irritated after the initial dinner.  So, I went to the hostess desk and I asked for the manager on duty. I voiced my concern with the manager and stated that they waiters seem very nice and friendly, but the service has been very slow and that my party is constantly waiting for orders and drinks and the mood at the table is a little low. He said that doesnt sound normal and that he would check with the kitchen and staff. I said thank you and went back to the table. We were there probably about 20 minutes after that and the manager NEVER came to talk to me to resolve my issues. Perhaps he assumed since we were done he didn't need to bother? We were only done because the service was HORRIBLE and we didn't want to stay or spend any more money there.  I will NEVER go back to this establishment nor will I ever recommend anyone to ever go there as the food does NOT make up for the lack of service you receive."
Cameron C.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",56,20,5,2.0,11/4/2012,"I would not knock all BJ's but this one kind of sucks!  I have been here 6 times since they opened and 5 out of 6 times they told me they were out of avocado egg rolls.  But there is more...... the one time they did have them, they were brought out after we were into our meals (Trust me I did not ask for them after my meal).  However, not only is this low rating about avocado egg rolls, their service sucks.  The only time I received fairly quick service was when I went at 10am and was the only table there.  I understand new restaurants have to shake out their bugs but they need to hurry up or they will lose customers."
Ozzy T.,"Monterey County, CA",417,90,416,2.0,10/31/2012,"Average service, seemed as though no one was responsible for serving the tables we were seated at because it was a good 10 minutes before someone approached us, the people behind us who arrived after us got service before us and it wasn't too busy at the time. They have a nice selection of drinks and the food is very good. Nice lunch specials. But something is up with management or lacks a good manager because every aspect seemed too slow and unorganized..."
K H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/14/2016,"One word: BEER!! I am a beer enthusiast and BJ's has a big selection of delicious craft beer. My favorite is the Jeremiah red and my fiancé usually sticks to the darker beers. I recently discovered that they blend their beers, and so far I like what I've tried.  The service is always good. We normally sit in the bar area and sometimes it's a little busier then we would like, but the servers aways do their best to be attentive to their tables.  As far as food goes, I don't think I've never had anything I didn't like.  Their fish n chips are the best I have had, and I like pairing them with the potato wedges rather than their fries which tend to be really skinny. Their steaks, pizzas and appetizers never disappoint.  After reading some of the one star reviews, I think they are being reviewed on their super busy days. I would encourage them to visit when it's not prime time so they can enjoy the atmosphere and the food and beer.  I have not experienced a bad meal here, and my fiancé and I eat here super often."
Steve C.,"Salinas, CA",21,15,10,2.0,4/2/2013,"The First couple of times eating here when it first opened was good, but has gone down hill fast and I will probably not eat here anymore. The last time i ordered a pizza and it looked like someone threw a few pieces of meat and garnish on it and called it a pizza, tonight i ordered a Crispy Calamari appetizer for myself because the picture in the menu has a heaping pile of Calamari in it , well don't even go by the pictures because i had about 10 or 12 small pieces maybe 2 very small squids on the platter. What a joke BJ's you lost my business by being cheap on the portions."
Kass H.,"Salinas, CA",27,33,,2.0,6/2/2014,"I recently went back an ordered the same (customized vegan) dish, asking just for ""some grilled veggies"" with marinara on flatbread, & the waiter ordered every veggie they had.. It had no sauce, and although the veggies were good, the bill came with my dish being over $23!!! Just for veggies and bread! I was very disappointed. It had cost me less than half that the first time I had the similar dish. I would've appreciated if the waiter had paid attention to the cost of this customized dish to realize it was way too pricey, or at LEAST let me know ahead of time how much it would cost. I didn't say anything because I hate being ""that"" customer, especially since I'm already a bit of a pain since I'm vegan. I don't think I'll go back anytime soon."
Bob R.,"Salinas, CA",0,276,2,1.0,8/1/2014,"I don't know why I keep coming back. I have never had a good meal here. The beer is good though. Stop by for a beer. This time we got salads and pizza. How could they screw that up?  They could serve wilted salad greens and burn the pizza, that is how.  How do they stay in business?  TGI Fridays had good food and they are gone.  Why can't they fix the kitchen?  The service is not that bad."
A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",845,1249,8,3.0,1/21/2013,"We stopped here for dinner on the way home from Pinnacles National Park.   I had what I usually get at the Cupertino BJ's, the turkey burger with avocado.  It was really disappointing.   The burger itself was extremely charred and there was just a small bit of avocado on my sandwich.   The pizookie for dessert was really good (although, continuing the theme of food not cooked for the right amount of time, it was pretty undercooked - but that did not detract from taste).  Service was good and there was no wait when we showed up early on a Sunday evening.  However, the lack of consistency in the burger was really disappointing, since you can normally count on chain resaturants for consistency."
Saqqara K.,"Henderson, NV",269,88,14,1.0,10/9/2012,"Just didnt get menu right, left things off, forgot things, it wasnt busy there and it was me, my friend and her 4yr old son.  Too dam dark, bring your flashlight to read the menu.............server was sweating from working so hard, while others just stood around watching  him.  he gets 5 stars, forgot the guys name.  Nice decor, 1 star for that."
Carlee M.,"San Francisco, CA",5,44,1,2.0,6/20/2013,Came in at 7 and was greeted professionally and was promptly seated. Order drinks that came 10 minutes later and one of them was a flat beer. Ordered another beer and that too was flat. I then ordered an appetizer that came 30 minutes later. Chicken wraps were so-so. Then received our meals promptly. The pizza was a pre-made then frozen then reheated dish. You can tell. And my mani mani was very salty and over cooked. Service was great the whole way but wouldn't come back.
G. B.,"Emeryville, CA",13,21,,1.0,6/1/2012,"It's great to see a restaurant like this in Salinas -- it's long overdue.  Just don't leave behind a pair of expensive sunglasses at your table (on accident) or you won't see them again.  Perhaps some of the servers and management staff need a reminder that THEFT is a real ding on customer service overall, and tarnishes the reputation of the restaurant -- ultimately affecting business."
Phil M.,"Salinas, CA",25,175,17,4.0,8/15/2012,"I like the atmosphere/vibe. Their homebrew Hef is terrific.  I only tried a salad, since I ended up having a huge lunch earlier that day, but it was good.  It is, in my opinion, a little on the pricey side (at least, our bill was higher than I expected for a couple salads, a beer, a lemonade & one apetizer).  Overall good, though, and I definitely plan on going back for a better sample."
Erin H.,"Glendora, CA",18,24,,1.0,12/27/2012,Worst service I have ever experienced in my life. It took a good half hour to get our drinks and an hour and a half to get our food. Once our food was served we still did not have any silverware and when we asked they said it was really busy and they ran out of silverware!  we waited another 15 minutes for our silverware. Severely understaffed and poor service. I usually love BJ's so the food was ok...but worst service by far!
Erica L.,"Salinas, CA",0,29,4,2.0,1/28/2015,"Ok, not great.  It really depends who your waiter is.  We have gotten good service there, mediocre service and bad service.  The food is alright.  Last time I was there I ordered one of their burgers but substituted the patty for a veggie one.  Having been vegetarian all my life I know what a veggie burger should taste like and it should still have flavor.  My burger had lettuce, sauce, tomatoes and tasted completelly bland.  I only ate half and felt guilty because it was like $10.00.  My daughter had a marguerita flat bread and it was good, my youngest one had a kids meal with a grilled cheese which she only took a bite of. My husband had a pizza with pineapple, ham and sausage and a Jeremiah Red which is basically the only reason we keep going back, their Jeremiah Red. The waiter also forgot to put in the order for one of our appetizers and messed up our dessert order and the order of the table next to us as well.  They weren't even that busy it was a week night.  I recommend it onlly if there is a dish you really like there or if there is nowhere else you wanna go.  Don't expect great service and great food, it is just ok ( and kind of expensive for being just ok)."
Local consumer C.,"Salinas, CA",80,55,26,2.0,5/29/2012,"I really want to love this place. I really do! I've been here at least 5 times since they've opened. I try different times to see how well their service is even when they are slow. This place needs to get their act together and hire some quality help. These long waits (even when it's not busy) is unacceptable. I'll be complaining to headquarters today about our experiences there. I've even tried their call-ahead seating and that doesn't even help! If you call and ask how long the wait is, they'll say it's 30 minutes only to find out that you have to wait another 30 minutes when you get there. I get that it bumps you up on the list to call ahead, but the person answering the phone should clearly state that when asked how long is the wait! This last time we went there, a family of four, and the place was not even half to three quarters full and we had NO wait to be seated. But we didn't see our dinner until 60 minutes after we were seated. Apparently, (according to our server), they are required to bring out the food all together. So, the pizza was hot out of the oven but the rest of the food was cold as ice cubes! Then upon complaining that the two burger meals were cold, it took another 25 minutes to get that! So, two of us were done eating and had to watch the other two eat. And during that 25 minute wait, our server never came back to check on us to see if we needed drink refills. After waiting 20 minutes, I went up to ask to speak with one of the THREE managers and I stood there waiting for 10 minutes and they still didn't come out after they were requested. The food eventually arrived so I sat back down. The server was so frustrated at how the kitchen was putting out the food that he said if it doesn't get better that he'd be quitting his job. I felt bad for him. Of course, they are good about comping for meals, which is their only salvation at this point. But after wasting 2.5 hours of our evening there just to eat dinner, and having similar experiences all 5 times that I've been there, I'm not sure that I will come back soon!  I thought they'd have their sh*t together by now but apparently I'm wrong."
AJ Q.,"Denver, CO",8,72,8,5.0,5/15/2013,"This is by far the best gluten free pizza I have ever had. We went in for lunch, and the place was fairly empty. We got seated quickly and didn't have any problems. Would eat here again if we're back in Salinas."
