Mark G.,"Salinas, CA",25,172,23,2.0,6/20/2012,"nine of us appeared here for a company celebration today. it was not crowded at 2:30, yet it took an hour for our food to arrive.  my first root beer was cold, but the refill was not, and had no ice. i expected my flat bread/pizza to be warm, but it was not.  all of the dishes were presented well. drinks were filled to the top, and refills came without asking.  prices appeared to me to be high.  not going back."
Hank T.,"Fullerton, CA",0,72,3,1.0,8/11/2013,It took 15 min for a server to come to our table and  get our drink order.  The utensils were dirty also.
Jay H.,"Gilroy, CA",1,6,,5.0,3/1/2014,"We had a fantastic experience unlike any one would expect from a chain restaurant. Our visit was 2/28/14, a group of 6 of there to celebrate a friends 57th birthday. The restaurant was crowded, but we managed to get a table near the bar until our dinner table was ready. We were greeted by Danny Torres the G.M who came and introduced himself. This guy went above and beyond anything we could imagine @ a BJ's. He brought us beer & food samples while we were @ the bar. After we were seated he came by multiple times to check up on us. At the end of dinner more beer samples and 4 pazookies....Seriously!!!! I thought I was in some kind of time warp or something. We will definitely be back! Our server was also fantastic as well. Danny you really know how to take care of customers and we truly hope your company will see this review and realize your value. Thanks Again Jay"
Janelle R.,"Marina, CA",32,103,5,2.0,7/27/2012,"We had never been to this particular location before but had been to another location once before. Our waiter was very unattentive and didn't seem very comfortable with talking to people or taking their orders. The service was extremely slow and we never saw the waiter except to take our order and give us the bill.  The calamari appetizer was extremely small and came out as one lump rather than individual pieces. My bacon cheeseburger had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever but I managed to literally choke down half of it. Another guest's order was not correct but was resolved quickly. The 'deep dish pizza' was about two inches of dough and hardly any cheese or sauce. The salad dressing was very tangy.  At the end of the meal the waiter asked if I wanted a to go box for my picked apart burger. I told him that it was not good and that there wasn't any flavor. His immediate response was, ""Do you want to speak with a manager?"" Whereas I would normally applaud this question he did not apologize and I was still extremely hungry but it would have been pointless or order something else as the other guests were done eating.  For dessert we ordered the pizookie sampler since we had heard so much about it but I was not impressed. The flavors were good, but they were tiny and the metal dish wasn't even full!  The craft black cherry drink was very good, but it's not worth it to drive all the way to Salinas for a soda."
Linda C.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,2.0,7/12/2014,We eat at BJs in San Jose all the time. Love the beer and food. So we tried the Salinas one. Food still great but we had to wait 25 minutes before they took our food order! We were going to a concert and had to get food soon. The server apologized saying he was slammed! There were three tables in the main dining area with people. The bar had about 20 people in it! That is slammed? We had been in Olive Garden. And left due to bad service and went to BJS instead. Can't you get good service in Salinas?
Daisy U.,"Salinas, CA",3,15,20,2.0,4/27/2012,"First time at this restaurant. First impressions: great environment, my patron margarita was perfect; however they didnt carry any energy drinks for my red bull vodka :( customer service sucked, we had a party of 6 and were gnna split da bill ...she made us check our own tabs for any mistakes she made, which were quite a few. Very Dissapointing, the ratio between waiters and customers is not well calculated. Overall advise to future customers is be prepared to wait"
Brent F.,"Monterey, CA",38,43,11,2.0,5/20/2012,"BJ's overall was decent 2.5/5 You can tell they're still working on their flow and team building. They gave gramps one of those Irish Coffee skinny mugs for his coffee he gave it a try but it hit him in the nose and it was too dainty for his working man fingers. After a search and explanation that the regular coffee mugs were all broken one was found, irate employee went crazy? They also brought my soup &salad entree as an appetizer so the soup got cold and the grandparents fussed over wanting me to eat while we waited for their entrees. The chicken tortilla soup was quite good. They made a big deal about pouring it from a cup to the plate that had the chicken & cheese mounded in the middle but then submerged the fresh  lime in it so I couldn't really squeeze it without getting soup fingers. The salad was a basic bland iceberg with a couple tomato and cucumbers slices. I got the creamy garlic dressing as it was the closest pairing for the soup. It was very bland compared to the soup so I put a huge amount of pepper in it to give it some kick. I know this is nit picky but the holes in the pepper shaker were ridiculously small, it took me a good 20-30 seconds to get enough out lol.  The grands decided on pot roast.   Gramps got the open faced version and Grams got the entree version. Salad is $2.50 extra I think, so they didn't get any. Looking at the two meals I'd get the sandwich and just not eat the bread since it was $3-4 cheaper for the same food. The pot roast was very tender the mushroom gravy was flavorful but salty. The mashed potatoes were odd to me. Dense and oddly dry even though you know there is a ton of fat in them. The roasted veggies were kinda lifeless looking. Seemed more steamed than roasted none of that carmelized burnt edges that make roasted veggies so tasty. Positives were that the staff was friendly, the decor was very nice and clean so far, the menu was huge and had a nice variety. I do want to try it at another point when I can splurge a bit more on calories since most of the entrees were over  1200 kcals easily. I'd actually like to split one of their deep dish pizzas with one of their ""award winning""  brand of beers. Grams thought they would have had a brewery setup like the Monterey  Brew Pub but I assume it's all done centrally and shipped. I'm pretty curious as to wether they're owned by the same company as PF Changs Cheesecake Factory or CPK. Feels very much like that style of elegance for the masses. I'm hoping that after another month they'll get it together and I think it'll be a good addition for Salinas. Red Lobster next door is going to go out of business though."
Brittany W.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,,4.0,2/8/2015,"I absolutely love this restaurant. From the moment we walk in, the employees are very nice and greet you. I love ordering their steak! One of the places that cook it the way I like it!  I'm a creature of habit and I like to go to the same places that treat me and my guy right from the start. We also like getting their sample beer, where there are like 6 beers (don't remember)? And their different flavors. I really like that it's a big enough restaurant roomy. You will definitely be seeing us again!!"
Brian H.,"Salinas, CA",18,37,25,1.0,4/21/2013,"Very nice building, I'm glad people have more options in Salinas, but the menu is not that different than an Applebee's and the service is horrible. They are 3 for 3 on screwing things up when I go there."
Pete C.,"Yuma, AZ",1,5,,2.0,4/3/2014,Good food. Good atmosphere. EXTREMELY slow service...every time at the North Main St location.
Ashley H.,"Monterey, CA",33,39,1,3.0,4/20/2013,Wonderful setting and great service. Food ok. Fries and wontons are great
Jaime M.,"Monterey, CA",32,1,,1.0,3/7/2013,When you get a beer that seems flat things happen I understand some things are out of the employees hands...when you request it replaced with a different beer and it is also flat and there's no apology and they walk by your table and ask didn't you order an appetizer a half hour ago? your sitting there like dude shouldn't that be what I said? This never happened at Chevys it's sad that it closed because of a restaurant like this...for the most part food is ok and beers are plenty to choose from but don't expect good service or always receiving food on time or beer flat free
In The Moment Portraiture W.,"Fontana, CA",193,7,11,5.0,6/21/2013,"I was with my family and my daughter for the weekend because my daughter was registering for school. We had dinner at BJ's Brewery and we had an awesome server by the name of Delores. Delores was amazing she was so attentive to us  constantly checking .on us and she  has the best personality in the world , that is the best server iI've have ever had. The manager was cool also he came  over to our table and asked if we needed anything and to make sure everything was good. Thank you Delores for loving Your job and treating us so special see you soon !"
Allen N.,"San Diego, CA",236,149,26,3.0,6/20/2012,"When I first came here I was stoked because its BJ's and man that first week was crazy! People came here dressed up like it was upscale which I found hilarious. Anyways I come here to watch the game on the big screen and have a a couple drinks with friends. Unfortunately since it's Salinas, they don't offer a late night happy hour like the other chains do. Service is getting better over time. But all in all it's just BJ's."
Amber F.,"Salinas, CA",2,25,7,2.0,9/23/2013,"I love their selection on the menu, however the service is horrible.  My family and I sat there for 20 minutes before being greeted by a server and then our drink order took another 15 minutes to get to us!......I would say that they would have a good thing there if they can get their customer service on track!"
Bryan A.,"Roseville, CA",1,13,,4.0,5/25/2013,"BJ's has a good variety and usually has good service. I've been there about 15 or 20 times and have only had slow service twice, in my book, that's pretty good. Get the avocado appetizer! Mmmmm!"
Marty M.,"Salinas, CA",0,40,,3.0,5/3/2014,"Met some friends here for lunch the other day.  They have been many times; this was my first. I have seen bad reviews for the service, so was keenly aware of this aspect of my visit.  I have absolutely no complaints about the service.  I was a little early, so I waited for my friends. I was greeted immediately and given the choice of taking a table or waiting.  I opted to wait.  The hostess offered me a menu to read while waiting.  My friends were greeted immediately when they arrived and we were promptly seated.  Our order was taken as soon as we were ready (I needed a few minutes to read the large menu).  No complaints about the food service-- our server was friendly and responsive. The food was as expected.  I really enjoyed my California Chicken sandwich and my friends enjoyed their selections.  They told me they have never been disappointed here.  There are many choices for lunch-- soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, pizzas, etc.  Prices seemed reasonable.  I end up paying about the same price almost anywhere I go for a sit down lunch in Salinas. My only complaint was that the music was a little loud and the acoustics such that it was difficult to carry on a conversation."
Stan O.,"Salinas, CA",17,18,4,1.0,12/26/2012,"Worst service EVER. SEVERELY under staffed. 45 min to get a beer. 90 minutes to  receive meal.  No drawn butter for lobster, another 15 min wait. Almost had to go into kitchen to fetch myself.  Food was good as usual. EVERYTHING else missed the mark."
Neil Mikel L.,"Palm Springs, CA",42,74,14,3.0,11/14/2012,Gave this place anohter try--the food was actually better. The pumpkin ale great. The service still nees some work. The desert was not their strong point. I would go back and try a few more items.
Trixie C.,"Salinas, CA",74,20,4,3.0,11/16/2012,Great food but slow ass service! (I want my damn pazooki!)
