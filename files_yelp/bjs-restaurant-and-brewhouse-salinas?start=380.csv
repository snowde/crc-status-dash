Mary B.,"Monterey, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/27/2012,Great service by Cody.  Food was served quickly & with the utmost courtesy.  We will come back soon
Amanda B.,"Salinas, CA",170,10,,2.0,6/13/2012,"I was so excited to see this place had opened in Salinas...we don't get many trendy chains, you know?  I will say the food was outstanding...but the service was the worst I've had in a long time.  They brought out the wrong drink order for my friend, and the wrong meal order for my son.  The manager came over and apologized...and then they still brought out the wrong kind of pizza for my husband...and it took our party of six 2 1/2 hours to complete our lunch.  Thankfully our kids were exceptionally patient that day.  I might go back sometime, but I was completely unimpressed with the whole experience."
Julian L.,"Salinas, CA",19,68,32,2.0,8/13/2012,My food was not good. My company loved hers. Service was crap. Will drive to San Bruno next time.
Eric G.,"Salinas, CA",12,48,4,1.0,9/24/2013,"We went here for dinner and felt invisible the entire time. After being seated we waited for at least 15 minutes before the maître d' (a black guy) at least walked by and asked if we had been helped and took our drink and appetizer order.  It was another 10 minutes before our drinks were brought out (by a server, a white female) and about 10 minutes AFTER that our appetizers arrived by the same server. The guy that I THINK was our server (shaved head, goatee) finally took our order, which took approximately 1/2 hour to get to our table (shouldn't take that long to make a few tacos and hamburger sliders).  A female waitress brought our meal out to us and about 10 minutes later the guy with the shaved head asked if I wanted a refill on my drink, to which I responded ""yes."" (It had already been empty for 15 minutes.)  My iced tea refill never came and I had to walk to the bar myself and ask the bartender for a refill.  I returned to my table, we finished our meal and after 15 more minutes of no attention from staff at all, we decided to go to the front and politely explained to the maître d'  (who was busy playing on his cell phone) that our service was horrible, that we had been forgotten about and we just wanted our check.  He alerted the lug of a waiter, who brought our check.  I promptly signed it and we left.  On our way out the door the maître d' said a passing ""sorry for the service"" and that's it.  I am not sure if he's the manager or not but if he is that restaurant is going to go under as he does not seem to care about decent service, offered us no explanation or anything.  The place was not busy at all and was nearly empty which makes me wonder not only why the food took so long to get out but why the wait staff was so inattentive.  If they do not have some sort of structured, standardized program to teach their wait staff one needs to be implemented.  That is going to be the last time I go there."
Sally O.,"Salinas, CA",2,8,,1.0,12/24/2013,Absolutely horrendous service! I could go on and on about everything that was horrible. They need new management and a whole new serving staff.. Do NOT got to that restaurant!
Carolyn P.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2013,"When the bf and I have a bad experience at a restaurant we like to give them the benefit of the doubt so we return 3 times in a given period......3 times in a 3 month period for BJs......BOTTOM LINE: THE FOOD ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR THE SLOW SERVICE. I GOT SICK FOR WEEKS, WILL/HAVE NEVER RETURNED  (bar exception, I like the Brewhouse blonde).......read on :)   Try one: Extremely slow service, food was tasteless (Calzone worse than pizza hut). Thought it was our food choices and decided to try something else on the menu next time. Try two: Service was slow, but we weren't terribly disappointed so we thought to give it another try.  Try three: Service was even slower than the first! 30 min to get water, I was ready to leave but bf convinced me to stay.....should have left. Pork chops entree (although tasty) gave me an intestinal infection! Couldn't eat anything for a month and a half without having to run to the bathroom ASAP afterwards to sh**t."
Mike Y.,"Monterey, CA",27,50,2,5.0,6/2/2012,Best chain brew pub in the nation. Good drink selection and an excellent menu
Ari S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,5,,1.0,9/8/2013,Waiting 30 minutes for a F*%^ing burger!? Ridiculous - this place blows for service - go somewhere else
Brent V.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",8,253,39,2.0,5/4/2012,"Our first time here to eat and what else can I say...    More of a place to drink & party than to eat :-(   On the plus side, everyone is really nice...  lol"
Chris L.,"Salinas, CA",0,10,,2.0,6/27/2013,"The restaurant is nice and new, but the service and food is mediocre. It took forever for me and my wife to get our food and once we got it...we were pretty disappointed. Food is bland and has little flavor."
Valerie M.,"Salinas, CA",0,9,,3.0,1/5/2013,only been here a few times but over all i would say its a good resturant. love the pizza's and and cookie dessert they have there . I know some ppl have complained about the servers there but my servers have been pretty good. I remember a good one was tall short blonde hair and always refilled my drink.
Ez_1 G.,"Watsonville, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/25/2015,"the service is very slow and the food is not as good at the BJ's in san jose. we had avocado rolls and they were not as good as the san jose location. the food we order was a little on the burned side and not as good. what I'm trying to say is if you want a real Bj's experience you should not try this one. the food took a long time to come and it was not a busy night (thursday at 6pm, no wait line).. i hope they make this place a little better. the serves a nice but the food and the service does not live up to what is expected from a place like thins...... try something else."
Steve G.,"Seaside, CA",1,2,1,2.0,11/14/2012,"The pale ale is good. My wife and I were not much a fan of the other brews. I'm not partial to a lager, kolsch, or hef so the odds were against them. The IPA started off great- nice citrus and floral notes... But for some reason the wonderful smell and flavor quickly faded and I was left with an old, malty tasting IPA. The brown, porter, and stout were not my style either. Ok for style but I personally prefer a bit more carbonation and body on my porters and stouts. The brown was a bit sweet for me as well. We had a deep dish pizza. The fist one brought was incorrect and the staff corrected the mistake rather quickly. The dough reminded me of a biscuit more than a pizza. I kept wondering if it was made by Pillsbury to be honest. If it weren't for the wonderfully attentive wait staff, I would only have the pale ale to be positive about. Our waiter was great and he got a good tip. Overall its too much of a trip for us to be back. If I lived closer I might hit it up for an appy and a pale but not dinner."
Jen C.,"Seaside, CA",52,1,,1.0,11/12/2013,"I don't usually write reviews, in fact this is my first yelp review. I had to share that this was the most horrible dining experience I've ever had. Party of 7 veterans/active duty soldiers on Veterans Day so we did get our free appetizer/mini pizza but it took them 45 minutes to get the appetizers to us. Then another 30 minutes for our food, and my husbands order was wrong. So we'd already been there over an hour before we start eating, mind you they weren't the least bit busy, all the while our server never came back to check on us and all our drinks were empty. After we finished it was about 15 minutes until she took our dessert order and another 20 minutes for her to bring out desserts and checks. As if being there for over 2 hours wasn't bad enough I woke up in the middle of the night very very ill. Definitely will not being going back to BJs ever again."
Steve S.,"Salinas, CA",0,14,,3.0,6/28/2012,"I was very happy to hear that Salinas was finally getting a great restaurant. I'm kinda tired of eating at the regular spots in town like Ginos, Ellies, Outback or Smalleys. Not that there's anything wrong with them. I've been to BJ's in Arizona and it was great. I only have a couple mild complaints. First, when they came with my dinner, I had the 12oz steak and baked potatoe. The potatoe was massive! It took up half of the plate. They only give a micro spoonful of butter. It would only cover 1/3 of the potatoe. I asked for more and they still only gave me the same amount, so basically I could barely cover half of it. Don't be stingy with the butter! Also, they are a little slow as far getting your meal in a timely manner. It also seems like the waiters and waitresses are a little overwhelmed. I will go back for sure because I love their food. I will probably wait a couple of months though to give them more time to perfect things. We should give them a little break since they are still so new. Great atmosphere! I do like the fact that they have security there. It is Salinas after all. It's unfortunate that they need it, but we don't want the dumbass gang members ruining BJ's like they did Fridays. Hopefully next time I go there I can give them another star or 2 rating."
Marco V.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/21/2012,The service was HORRIBLE!!!!! It took me just a lil over 3 hours to eat dinner. Wow! I gave it one star because the food was good.
Toney B.,"Salinas, CA",6,25,1,1.0,4/9/2012,"My Caesar salad was served and finished before the appetizer hit the table. The appetizer was nachos which were cold and barely edible. Our empty beer glasses were picked up without an offer of refill. We barely saw our sever and the entrees were also barely warm. We expressed our concern. All this after a 45 minute wait to be seated!  Give them a couple months to get their act together. 12/30/12 UPDATE:  Despite my commitment to the contrary, we went here tonight ONLY because our daughter received a free meal certificate as a scholastic achievement award and she was bent on using it. We went early to avoid the long wait we had experienced before.  To our surprise we were seated immediately in a nearly empty restaurant... and then waited for quite a while before our server arrived to take our order. We placed our drink, appetizer and entree order at the same time since we had had more than enough time to peruse the menu.  Our daughter's lemonade arrived shortly but we had a while longer to wait before our beer arrived.  30 minutes later I had to ask our server to check on the status of our appetizer. 10 minutes later it arrived,at which time we had to ask for our eating utensils and napkins, followed by our entrees less than a minute later.  Apparently the kitchen staff is not aware of, or does not have access to a stove, oven, or hot table!  Have you ever eaten COLD, soft ""crispy"" calamari?  YUM!!!  The puffed up dough ball of a pizza our daughter was served was pale, dough-white, no-trace-of-browning bread that had something resembling strands of half melted cheese lightly sprinkled atop a few cold pepperoni slices!  We both had the jalapeño burger with potato wedges.  The wedges were hot and awesome.  The burgers... tasteless, cold and most definitely NOT spicy. I swear to you that it was like eating a MacD's quarter pounder...  WITHOUT THE FLAVOR OF A QUARTER POUNDER!  Where in hell do you find jalapeños that are tasteless?  Anybody? The beer was good and that is the only reason they get 1 star... well that and apparently I cannot give them 0 stars. The use of the name of this establishment has been banned at our home.  ANYONE USING IT WILL BE FLOGGED!!!"
Steph D.,"Omaha, NE",0,8,1,1.0,3/12/2013,"My only advice: BRING CASH i dont usually like writing bad reviews, so lets me just write my experience and you can decide if you want to go or not.... Ive been here a few times...and i would have liked to gone more if it were like any other bjs but its not. My first experience was when it first opened, it was fine for being a new. My server had his tray tipped and spilt a good part of my martini on my friend. which i thought was funny bc my friend was wearing board shorts and the guy was really nice about. He was very attentive to serving out table and talked to us a bit. I had calamari and it was delicious. Then, i came here again with my sister, we werent carded for our martinis our food was hardly warm and calamari was soggy and gross but whatever .that happens sometimes, i get it. I came here again about 3 weeks ago with my sister. We wanted to sit outside bc it was a nice day, they brought us to the patio and we were by ourselves the whole time out there. I had 2 martinis and my sister had one. my server mumbled the whole time but my sister and i just figured she was new, she hardly checked in with us and didnt bring us our food, some guy did and he also got me my second martini. good guy :). sooooo after she brought my second martini she ran off and i had to loudly say ""Excuse me"" before she left the patio so i could ask for some utensils, napkins, water and to order some stuffed mushrooms (which were gross and soggy with way too much sauce in it)...she brought me these things what seemed like as slow as possible.  I guess it was the supervisor who asked us if everything was ok, and we figured she was just new so we said everything was great. Im pretty petite and not much of a drinker so we walked to target and bought some things, i couldnt find my debit in which i used to pay for our stuff at bjs, so i used a credit card and then went to the bank to withdraw money, and then i searched my car in the parking lot. Couldnt find it, so i called bjs...i guess they looked at this point i feel like they probably didnt really and just checked their hostess area to see if one was turned in. About 5 oclock i get a text from chase fraud saying my bill was more than it shouldve been and i had other suspicious activity.I checked my account online and say that BJs had charged me more and apparently i spent 60$ at shell, $30 at mcdonals, and  $10 at CVS. So i called bjs and the supervisor ken was pretty cool about my suspicions as to who i thought might of taken it and he said he would call me right after he talked to her. He called me a few hours later and said he couldnt get a hold of her and would try later. I waited 3 days til i finally called him back. He told me she didnt do it, and i asked him how he knew and he told me ""Bc i asked her and she said no"" ....um ok that sounds legit if i stole someones card i would most likely say no also....this is kind of upsetting. ""So why didnt you call me back to say this?"" ""uhhh bc i had a few days off and i just didnt get around to it"" EXCUSE ME BUT I BELIEVE MY CARD GOT STOLEN AT YOUR RESTAURANT. so at this point i was really upset regardless if it was a lie or not youre making excuses for your lack of supervising skills and someone due to the circumstances seems like she really took my card... He gave me the GMs info. I guess his name is Eric or something rather. He called me back right a few minutes after i filed a police report. I told him i wouldnt have done this if i felt like my situation wasnt handled so poorly. I told him if i were Ken i would have not waited for me to call him back, i wouldve comped my meal and had me come back again for another free meal.(maybe) bc regardless if she stole it or not, the service has more than most times been crappy and customers come first, especially if they were polite to begin with. Eric said he was very sorry and made excuses for ken and this girl and proceeded to tell me about very personal tragedies about her life ( i would be pissed if i were her) and um isnt that like illegal?? and said he would mail me a gift card...which i never got either? im not going to call and ask for his excuse for that one is... he gives me a call a few days later, i call him back the next day and im on hold for over 5 mins. i hang up, they are not even worth my time at this point."
