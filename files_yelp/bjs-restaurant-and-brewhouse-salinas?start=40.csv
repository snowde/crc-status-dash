Janis D.,"Morgan Hill, CA",31,76,7,5.0,4/13/2017,If you want a great lunch with even better service go to Bj's. Ask for Monique's are. She had only worked there 3 weeks and is a pro! Treats her guests like a million bucks and the food was great. But with her smile and upbeat attitude it made the experience 110% of what you hope for!
Jessica H.,"Salinas, CA",49,13,19,4.0,3/3/2017,"For a Friday night,  their service was actually pretty good.  Drink service was slow,  but that's again probably because it's a Friday.  Food was good.  I've had bad experiences with the service here,  but tonight was pretty decent. The tomatoes on the burger was good. I got the chicken barbacoa,  best item on the enlightened menu."
Don J.,"Salinas, CA",18,9,,1.0,8/1/2016,"sorry I  chose to go to BJ'S brewery and restaurant today, but it will be the last time. On several occasions my wife ordered the country fried chicken without the gravy and mashed potatoes the dinner portion, and has never received the sucotash. They fail each time to include the second breast until we remind them of our original order. The drinks were slow coming, but not as slow as refills or the catsup for the fries. Her wedge salad was ordered with vinegar vinegarette but came with ranch. The table next to us had the staff jumping even though we were there first. The waitress  didn't bring out the order so no asked if we would like anything else, like catsup or more water. We had to wait several minutes to even catch a glimpse of waitress, usually GOING The Other way..P.S. I turned in my reward card, rewards come from good service."
Kate F.,"Salinas, CA",0,6,,3.0,6/18/2017,"All three stars go to Michael, the manager I spoke to today, Father's Day, after sub par service. This including getting seated at a sticky table, a waitress that didn't once smile genuinely, with a Hot Topic doom-and-gloom make up ensemble. She offered my mother ""Pepsi products"" as an alternative to Coca Cola. After a half hour wait for our food, my mom asked her to wipe down our table. She replied, ""Just this side?"" The entire table is the usual, or to what I am accustomed.  Our server placed our food on the farthest side of our table and left us to retrieve with a rag to wipe down our table. We sat there with our food on our table out of our reach for longer than five minutes. After only wiping in front of me and a really forced ""Sssorry about that, guys!"" my mom found the rag to be bone dry when she herself took it and applied actual elbow grease into wiping the table down in front of me, herself and my brother with the waitress standing there watching how it's supposed to be done. After pushing the stickiness around, the waitress plopped our food in front of us, and left. No offer of anything like bbq sauce, or if we needed anything else.  There were only five tables in our section and I watched every other table get checked up to three times for drink refills, etc. This included the table right across from us that our waitress checked on at least twice while just passing us right on by. When she finally did come over, I asked her for a take out box. After the sticky table and watching my mom palm a dry, mystery rag over our table herself, I had a lot of food left over from loss of appetite. I asked another server for the manager when our server gave me the smallest take out box possible for the large entree I couldn't finish because of the lack of cleanliness.  Thank you Michael, for making it right. The food was fantastic, the way you patiently listened to our plight was greatly appreciated. Thank you for letting us ask for you on our next visit. Maybe the waitress was having a hard day. But whatever the case, today was a celebraton of the first Father's Day our family endured after my father's passing and she ruined the staple event of the day because of, as we concluded, lack of training. I hope this gets resolved before the next family trying to celebrate something gets the treatment that we received. Manager Michael, I give you an A+. We didn't leave upset or bitter about the server's D- performance. We will be coming back."
Sonia L.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/17/2017,The service here is horrible. Save your time and go elsewhere. I went to BJ's with with a group of four. Everyone got their food except one. We asked the waiter to look into it and the food never came. The manager ( obese Caucasian male ) promised the food would be out right away and guess what... It never did. Three of of us shared our food with our forth guest and paid for the meal.  We get together on a weekly basis and make it it point to never return to BJ's.
Estefania R.,"San Diego, CA",69,22,6,4.0,10/7/2016,"Service here has definitely improved! A few months ago the staff seemed like a circus act! One spill here, another one there, someone tripping over there. It was so insane! Lucky for them most of the spills were in an area where the guests had a sense of humor or else that would've been a lot worse.  Now they are back to normal. Long wait sometimes, but great service once you get a table. Their portions are not too big in regards to meals. Pizookies are good to share."
Sheila A.,"Salinas, CA",0,10,5,1.0,5/14/2017,"Absolutely disturbed by the breakfast that was served to me this morning aside from it being super greasy and awful. I took a bite of my egg whites and it was like plastic I had to spit it out. I could literally stretch out the ""egg whites"" with my fingers. Aside from that horrible experience both the ""manager"" and the waitress where completely unhelpful. Their beers are good but defiantly NOT WORTH THE TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!"
Stormin' N.,"Monterey, CA",18,5,17,3.0,10/13/2016,"Kind of disappointed that the tomato bisque broke--sauce separated and now a layer of grease on top. Used to be my favorite here, but this is the second time they brought out substandard bisque. I'm sad"
Glen G.,"Oakdale, CA",58,15,6,2.0,12/30/2015,"Good food. Slow delivery; inattentive waitress. When we arrived the restaurant was slow, but it took about 20 minutes to pull two tables together. We had to ask multiple times for refills. Food for one was brought out about 15 minutes before anyone else was served. I had to ask another waitress to find our waitress because after serving, items were forgotten and our waitress didn't bother coming back to check with us.  Despite the service, the food was good."
Jesus M.,"Turlock, CA",112,2,,2.0,4/20/2017,I had the bison burger which was ok but what really put me off was the coleslaw. It was not fresh and was brown. The server was great but the food was below par. I would not recommend.
David H.,"Salinas, CA",276,62,12,2.0,3/13/2017,"I went here today with my girlfriend.  I'm not sure if this food quality is going down but it was bad today.  When this place first opened it was spot on and the service was super good.  Now, it's gone down hill.  I love this place don't get me wrong.  It's just that this last time, I ordered no avocado and ""bam"" they put avocado.  That chaos my hid every time."
Karen Alejandra J.,"Soledad, CA",26,8,4,3.0,5/14/2017,"We had a couple of drinks at the bar , and we also had the flat bread  pizza and the deep dish ziti , really good food. But not the best service here in the bar, the lady barely came to us to see if we were okay , and not a single smile at all."
Cece M.,"Hollister, CA",0,19,1,5.0,5/13/2017,The santa fe chicken salad is the best aswell as the salted caramel pizookie 5 stars well deserved
Lewis L.,"San Juan Bautista, CA",24,7,,1.0,2/6/2017,"Worst service, went 2/4/17 at 5:50p. Had to ask the waiter 3 times for water, my salad got lost and never got to me, no apology. The waiter never took our dirty dishes, its ashamed that they have no customer service smarts! Shame! Shame! on the manger.l Lewis"
Larry H.,"Monterey, CA",1,13,26,1.0,3/14/2017,My lord the service is slow. Fries were cold. Took 30 mins to get a beer. Go else where or stay home and cook. 2 hours and the cookie never arrived. Sad place and terrible management.
Marilyn S.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/15/2017,Atlantic Salmon dinner was delicious. Both my husband and I ordered it and it was cooked to perfection. Love the stuffed mushrooms and chicken wing appetizers too. Our server was friendly and efficient. Short wait but worth it. This restaurant can sometimes be hit and miss. But last night's dining experience was a definite positive hit.
Steve C.,"Salinas, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/24/2017,"I won't be back.  Ordered the Chicken Club sandwich with fries which I ordered crispy.  What I got  back was a greasy sandwich - the toasted/grilled bread was soggy and the fries limp, not crispy - again probably too much grease.  I did let the waiter know of the issue and he asked if there was anything he could do about it - but I didn't feel like making too big of an issue of it, so I ate what I could, paid the suggested tip and left.  The kitchen staff shouldn't let food go out that way"
Nelly T.,"West Sacramento, CA",3,60,82,1.0,2/18/2017,"If I could do negative stars, I would do it. Horrible place, horrible service, horrible from start to finish. Not worth it. Don't spend a minute of your day at this awful place."
Lexie H.,"Aromas, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/19/2017,I have never in my whole life had an experience like the one I did Thursday. We went out to dinner for my birthday with friends and family. When my burger came it was practically still alive. Extremely raw. We told the server who brought it back..when it returned it literally looked like they just microwaved it. The lettuce and bread was now completely soggy and when I picked it up there was raw meat mushed in the bottom of the bun. It was absolutely astonishing..Happy Birthday to me. I will never eat at this establishment again and I don't recommend anyone else to either.
Sam M.,"Marina, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/18/2017,Food was not good the first time nor the second time I ate here.. Bbq tasted like overly sauced meat and the vegetables were overly cooked. The kids corn dog was so hard you could've cracked the plate .. I informed the waitress about the kids food. The waitress response was how did this get out here .. we paid and left
