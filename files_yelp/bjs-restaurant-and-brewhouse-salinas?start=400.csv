Charles Y.,"Berkeley, CA",142,277,6,4.0,3/27/2013,ahahahahahaha its called BJ's lol
Amy D.,"Berlin, Germany",161,1,,1.0,4/7/2014,"This place does not deserve a rate. They do not know good customer service and the cooks never seem to make the meals correctly. I have returned several times giving BJ's ""another chance"" as the other BJ's I have been to were awesome experiences. This place is reputable yet Salinas BJ's is not even close to up to par.  The staff needs training for sure. My sisters and I joke that if we ever go there again - don't go hungry, don't order mixed drinks and just stick to beer and after three sips, order your next drink!"
Temo G.,"Watsonville, CA",0,11,3,5.0,7/12/2013,"You have to try the new BBQ addition to their menu;  The Baby Back Ribs are to die for, and the service was excellent, my wife and I were there for our Anniversary, and we were treated like Royalty. Keep up the good work!!"
Richard H.,"Livermore, CA",9,15,,5.0,2/26/2014,"My store Manager from Salinas suggested we go to BJ's with our accounting staff. We all ordered the same...Caesars Salad, Tomato Bisque and an entrée. The food was fantastic. The tomato Bisque was the absolute best any of us have ever been served....and personally I have tried many at many nice restaurants. The highlight was the Kitchen Manager heard us raving about how good it was, he came over and generally described their preparation. My staff was totally impressed. Mr. Torres then asked our opinion of a new Salmon dish they were introducing and offered a sample...glazed Salmon over asparagus...absolutely incredible. What a fantastic experience. As a business owner, I really appreciate the wow factor, Mr. Torres provided it. When I visit Salinas, BJ's is our place."
Patrick C.,"Hollister, CA",2,19,4,4.0,4/11/2012,"Huge crowds, food was very good. Had the pizza and my friends steal look good. Try there beers you will be happy. Cool that they had other beers other then just theirs."
Kevin S.,"Monterey, CA",13,96,133,3.0,6/4/2013,"Locations for good food and excellent drink selection are limited in Salinas.  BJs offers both of these but my last two visit have been tests in patience.  The food while decent is shadowed by service that is nearly absent.  My most recent visit left me waiting for nearly 30 minutes to have a waiter stop to take my order.  I would love to chalk it up to a busy night but my late night, mid-week visit reflected one section as closed off and the remaining areas were lucky to have 30-40 customers total. The personal deep dish pizza was just underwhelming.  In the end the Pizookie and my generosity were the only things that bumped the experience above 2 stars.  It will be a while before I muster the courage to eat there again.  And just as a word of caution, if you leave with any leftovers in the black plastic containers they use.  DO NOT MICROWAVE them.  You will be left with a lump of plastic coating the contents of whatever you hoped to eat .  Hmmm I will have to post a picture of that online."
Gio P.,"Salinas, CA",5,6,3,1.0,8/13/2013,worst service i wait 45 to get drinks and they were out of fountain sodas on monday ???ridiculous!!!!!and to get my food another hour wow just wow!!
Sue M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,45,24,1.0,1/27/2013,"We ate here once. That is 1 time too many.  This was at around 8pm and we ordered the avocado rolls and those come cut in half when they serve them. The color of the avocado was black, as in rotten. Not only should the cook not have served it, the waiter should not have given it to us to eat either.  We didn't want to get sick, so we showed it to the waiter and said we weren't going to eat this.  He got a manager.  Guess what? He did not want to remove it from our bill. Yes. We couldn't believe what we were hearing. No reasoning would make him remove it from our bill.  He gave us a store credit to use next time we came in.  We gave it away for someone else to use. I drive by here all the time and never will I eat here again and never will I recommend any person to eat here either. It must be that BJ 's is not a good restaurant in general, because the one on Blossom Hill in San Jose had ok food but the wait service was so slow and terrible."
Monica W.,"Salinas, CA",0,7,,3.0,4/14/2012,"First time at a BJ's.   Great ambiance, clean bathrooms.  Was myself, my husband, and our 16 yr old son.  Our lunch was $79 & not worth it.  I had the seared Ahi salad, and it was just okay.  My son had the beacon burger and he seemed to enjoy it.  My husband had Sliders and he said it was okay, but greasy.  We also had calamari and buffalo wing appetizers, both were lukewarm and tasted microwaved.  To drink, my husband had their seasonal brewed beer and he said it was  ""good"".  I did have a excellent Cadillac Margarita. Our waitress was not ""on it"".  She checked on us once we we were served our meal, but then she disappeared.  We waited and waited and waited...We were never asked for more drinks or refills, we never received our check.  When she never returned ~ we decided to go to the ""check-in"" podium at the front to let them know we were ready to pay and leave.   BJ's is definitely a place to go for a good drink and bar food.  Not a place to go when you're expecting an above average dining experience."
Rhett L.,"San Juan Bautista, CA",0,10,,3.0,12/11/2012,I have always enjoyed the food at BJ's restaurants in general but the Salinas one has very poor customer service in regards to table service and I spoke to the manager several times about participating in my non profits event with donating gift cards and the manager blew me off several times in person or with not returning my calls.
Jessie T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/22/2012,"We have actually come to this restaurant to be entertained now! Just when i think it could not get any worse - oh it does!  It is amazing how the simplest dinning needs are overlooked (silverware, napkins, drinks).  The place is so nice and the staff seems normal, but I keep trying to figure out what that system is that is it always so intrinsically flawed!  Busy or slow, it is always 25 minutes just to get a drink (even Ice tea!).  They consistently get 3-7 things wrong! EVERY TIME!  We thought they were just new and give it a chance, but they have been opened for almost a year and it is always the same!  I guess they are consistent!  Consistently poor!"
Dan D.,"Boise, ID",0,30,,3.0,7/14/2013,"Nice atmosphere, menu had a lot of choices, but our food was a little bland and took a long time on a slow lunch shift. Friendly servers, though, and they apologized a few times for the wait. Overall, not the best food, but not bad."
Peta B.,"Salinas, CA",2,151,14,3.0,5/27/2013,"Decent is the word to use here. It's the kind of place where I wouldn't demand too much of the kitchen but which can succeed at the basics. Some of the pastas are fine and the burgers can be nice. A-OK is a good was of putting it, although I am torn between a 2 and 3 star rating (2.75 isn't an option but what I'd really give it)."
Dennis K.,"Salinas, CA",0,14,,4.0,3/16/2013,"Dropped by at 7:30 on a Friday night. There was a short wait for the dining room, but there was room at the bar, so sat there. Had good service throughout the night. Had the ribs, which could have had more flavor but were tender and meaty. Plenty of beers on tap to choose from, though the bartender I asked to make a creative cocktail didn't have much imagination. Still, pretty good overall. I'll be back."
Carlos O.,"Gilroy, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2014,"We went on a Wednesday night. Waiter suggested an appetizer so we ordered calamari then a few burgers and a few kids meals. They never brought out our appetizer. I informed the waiter and he apologized.  I then informed him that the bacon was missing from my burger, they brought it out on a different plate. After the waiter stepped away we noticed the sides of our kids meals were reverses so we had to take food off one plate to put it on the other.  The manager came over and apologized for the mix up and compt us a free dessert.  We asked for the beignet with the ice cream on the side. 15 min later another server brought it out with the ice cream on top. I informed him we asked for the ice cream on the side.  He said keep it and I'll get you another one. The waiter came and saw there was ice cream on my dessert, apologized and took the plate away and said I'll take care of it. When they brought us the correct dessert one of the spoons they gave us was dirty. By this time it was no use bringing it up. The manager came back and apologized again and he appreciated our patience and hoped we come back again. Sadly I will not. I should have listen to my friends and family when they said the service wasn't good. Was my first and last time eating at a BJ's"
Lauren U.,"Salinas, CA",218,2,,1.0,7/1/2012,"I came here with a group of my friends for a second time giving this place a second chance in hopes of an improvement of faster service and better food. Because I know the one in San Jose is great! Unfortunately, it only got worse. My dinner took four hours. My friends sandwich was cold, and my other friends' chicken had a hair in it. We had three servers, none of which paid any attention to us. We waited a long time for our dessert and at the end we were extremely dissatisfied with the service and wanted to speak to the manager. However, it was more like him being defensive and trying to belittle us. I couldn't believe how rude he was. He thought because we're college aged girls he can talk down to us. It was completely unprofessional and I'm never going back again."
Israel Z.,"Salinas, CA",77,2,,5.0,4/13/2013,"I had dinner april 12, 2013 with the family and dinner was great.  The service was excellent.  who ever the owner is you really should appreciate the waiter by the name of Matthew.  He was a great server and made the dinning experience very enjoyable."
Melissa M.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,,3.0,7/25/2013,"The food is always good, but the service is hit or miss and the bar service is ALWAYS slow!  The last time I was at BJs I ordered a glass of chianti and the server brought me some fruity, pink drink in this tall skinny glass.  Then it took forever after that to actually get what I ordered.  My dinner came and went and I still didn't have my glass of wine.  If you go, expect to wait and DON'T order drinks from the bar. Just save yourself the trouble."
Michael S.,"Soledad, CA",0,38,30,2.0,6/2/2012,"They seem to have a long wait time even when they aren't busy. I thought the food was good, but YMMV. It took a long time for our waiter to come back to the table when we weren't immediately ready to order. The food is pricey. The place is nice, but it's a little high and a very long wait."
Ed S.,"Salinas, CA",0,11,,2.0,6/13/2013,"The food was awesome, the bar was great, the service was sub-par. Our server was very friendly but it took forever to be seated and get our meal. This restaurant is woefully understaffed and it definitely shows in the overall quality of the service they are able to provide."
