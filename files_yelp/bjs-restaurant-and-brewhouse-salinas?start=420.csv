Larry Y.,"Aptos, CA",0,13,1,2.0,1/12/2013,"I ate at this restaurant on Sunday evening (January 6th). When I got my bowl of soup, I found that the spoon was dirty. It took about 3-5 minutes of waiting before my server came back with a clean soup spoon. Then when my entree came (rib-eye steak) I got a badly bent steak knife. The server said she thought it was because it got too hot when it was washed. That is not how a steak knife gets bent. Again I had to wait several more minutes for the server to come back with another knife. Food was OK but I was more in a hurry because I still had another hour drive to reach my destination."
johnny C.,"Seaside, CA",0,5,3,2.0,9/13/2012,"The First BJ's I ate at in Bakersfield was Good. Salinas' BJ's Sucks. The food is good, the drinks are good. The Prices are high & the Service SUCKS!!! The first time we went it was newly opened and was very busy. So we figured they were working out the kinks. Went back 4 months later on a Wednesday night thinking it won't be busy and the service has to be better, NOPE!      We were seated right away. However It took almost 10 minutes for any Server to come help us. From what i can Tell they do not have specific Tables they cover. It seems they all just run around helping who ever they want. Then we gave our Drink and appetizer order. 10 minutes later still no drinks. Our appetizer arrived before our Drinks. The Spinach dip is Small quantity. They give you about 3 times as many chips as you can get Dip on. Then we Asked for waters and those never showed up.      All in all this place should be good, but it has a long way to go. They need to revamp their serving practices. If i go there again, i will go straight to the bar and get my drinks and then grab a table. We will see what 6 months time does and give these people another shot. If things aren't better, I will never go there again."
Shelley D.,"Salinas, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/1/2012,Tried this place twice and the food is terrible.  The first time they forgot the chicken in a chicken dish.  The second time I ordered a loaded baked potato (how could they get that wrong). Although I received all the ingredients the potato was undercooked! I gave this place 2 stars only because it was a great place to watch a football game.
matt m.,"Marina, CA",5,25,,4.0,4/11/2012,"We've been to BJ's before and was excited to hear that BJ's was coming to Salinas.  Aside from the chaos of opening week(crowed and long waits) we had a very enjoyable experience and will return in the future. We would suggest calling ahead to find out about wait times. Our server was great and very prompt with our beers and taking our order.  We order the jambalaya and pasta dish and both items were tasty. The portions were large making to-go bags  must.  Given that it is a brewery the beers didn't disappoint either.  In addition to the house beers, they also offered house made sodas and a decent selection of guests beers. Finally, they are extremely accommodating for parties with infants."
Nicola L.,"Salinas, CA",18,9,,1.0,6/7/2013,"On 06/06/13 my son graduated Middle school and wanted to eat at BJ's as we have enjoyed the food on the two previous occasions we went.  Both times it was really busy yet the service was excellent and we received our food in good time.  This time however was not the case.  We arrived at 7:45 pm and were informed there would be a 20 min wait, this was fine as we could see it was busy though not like the two previous occasions.  After 20 min we were shown to our table and our beverage order was taken.  A few minutes later our waiter returned to take our food order.  Approximately 15 min went by and we received out appetizers which were good.  Our plates were removed and we were assured that our Entree would be served within a few minutes.  By 9.15 pm we were still waiting for our order which our waiter kept telling us would be a few more minutes........   Eventually our food arrived, my graduating sons burger was so raw it was mooing even though we had requested med to well, my husbands salmon was so so while my older son and I had ordered Moroccan Salmon, the vegetables were supposed to be roasted but were steamed and ice cold, the salmon looked like fish sticks and tasted fried and were also cold.  We complained to our waiter and he took the food back to the kitchen and called a manager for us.  I explained the situation and she said she would take care of it for us.  I declined having my food heated and said I did not want any food as after the long wait and cold food had lost my appetite.  My sons agreed to have their food redone.  By 10.00pm they were still waiting and by now were tired, disappointed and miserable.  I went to look for our waiter whom I thought was avoiding us due to embarrassment, I asked the hostess to prepare our bill as we were leaving, she agreed and said she would send the manager to us, lo and behold our food appeared at that moment as we were ready to leave.  The manager offered to pack it all up in a to-go box and said we would not be required to pay for the meal.. The second attempt was mediocre and all around a huge disappointment.  I really don't know what went wrong as we have enjoyed our previous two experiences as well as friends who frequent BJ'S.  I doubt very much whether I will put myself through the same experience again, I think I will just give it a miss in the future."
Kyreen C.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/9/2012,"Says on the website that they take reservations, so I called a week in advanced to try and book a table for 15-20 people. The hostess that answered said they are not currently taking reservations till the end of June and instead to call and utilize the ""call ahead system"". But in order to use the call ahead system we'd have to have a party of 9 or smaller. So how does that suggestion help? It doesn't since obviously I was calling for a party of 15-20. So I was then transferred to guest services and had the same unhelpful information regurgitated to me by yet another employee. And when I told them that the website states that they take reservations, I was told that they will speak to the manager about that ""error"". But that another option would be to  send someone from our party an hour before we expect to arrive to wait for seating. Seriously? Get your act together people. You are running a BJ's franchise, at least run it to standards. This place needs to hire more knowledgeable employees that knows a little something about customer service. Looking good in a black tee and slacks shouldn't be the only requirement for employment at this establishment."
