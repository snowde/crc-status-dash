Brenda V.,"Moss Landing, CA",59,9,,5.0,3/16/2017,Good Food for that area and no gangs appear to overtake it! We meet our friends here for drinks and appetizers! I love the quinoa dish!
Marlee J.,"Seaside, CA",102,171,362,5.0,6/29/2016,"Fabulous service for a group of five with a few drunks in the mix. Our waitress was amazing and patient. She was super attentive and I was impressed! We ordered calamari, two orders of wings and a medium 8 sliced specialty pizza- delicious! Bill great price of $66.64 and our waitress was given a generous tip cause she definitely deserved it!"
Marissa P.,"Monterey Bay, CA",232,275,1931,2.0,6/29/2014,"Good food, bad service. You're taking your chances when you dine here.  This restaurant is lacking in service. I don't know what it is....poor management, poor training, a lazy staff or ALL OF THE ABOVE!  I mean, c'mon....30 minutes just to wait for your bill? Wrong order being brought to you? Or my all time favorite, the manager seating a family that just walked in when there was an hour wait just because they complained....maybe if I complain louder I'll be treated like a queen here. I do dine here often since I live close by and my son loves the food, but if something goes wrong i just breathe and tell myself, ""i should have known....."" It really is disappointing and I hope they get it straight soon!"
Haide H.,"Marina, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/11/2017,"Love coming here, I usually sit at the bar & get tended to by Derek, Robert, Anthony, or Ryan, these guys are awesome! They'll sample beers for you, definitely recommend the jerry burst. They're very attentive and make conversation with you making it an awesome time at the restaurant which makes time fly by. Jesse, the manager, is just as great, he's always asking if my steak is to my liking and making conversation showing genuine interest. Cant emphasize enough what a great place this is! Also, skip the pazookie and get the beignet, so good!"
Karen S.,"Monterey, CA",353,23,5,2.0,3/8/2017,"Food was delicious but the service was insanely slow. Waited for 40 minutes just for appetizers. But like I said, food was very good."
Elizabeth P.,"Salinas, CA",78,11,,1.0,3/5/2017,"We went to BJ's last week and the service was horrible. We made reservations a week early and were seated promptly, but everything went down hill after that.  We were there for my son's birthday and wanted to have a nice dinner.  It took my husband 45 minutes to get his beer and my son never received his pepsi that her ordered.  After we ordered we received our meals 30 minutes later.  Everyone at our table received their meals except my brother in law.  After 15 minutes he asked where his dinner was and it took another 10 minutes for him to get it.  I will say the food was good, but they are not prompt.  I think there are not enough waitresses for them to be efficient.   I will probably not be returning anytime soon."
Diane V.,"Woodbridge, VA",32,42,47,1.0,7/2/2017,honestly was to be 15 min to seat actually 44 min.  ordered all prompty.  salads came out slow...but it took over 30 min for beer selection came.  main dishes still have not come.  never had an experience like this and i have been to a number of bj.  my daughter actually bussed her own dishes  to have her dinner.
Jeremy J.,"Seaside, CA",2,15,,2.0,4/26/2016,"This review is late and hopefully things have changed. Been here multiple times because this is one of my family's favorite places to eat. Wait time for a seat is usually pretty reasonable, but after that is where the problems usually ( more then five times) begin. The wait staff is always friendly so I think this is more of a management issue. My family usually order drinks and a couple appetizers, the drinks take about 15 minutes on a average @ that time we ask about the appetizer, and they assure me it is on the way. The next time the server stops by and we order still no appetizers. Our meal usually comes after about 45 minutes of waiting as well as our long lost appetizer & less one kids meal. ( yes have forgot multiple times). Summary: Yes I have been comped here many times not because I have asked, because they have been through MANY managers and the process has not changed or improvements have not  been made at all & for that I cannot blame the wait staff that fall's directly on the shoulders of the management. I will continue to go here because my family loves the food, but 90 minutes total time and 45 minute ticket times with two young children are inexcusable."
Jen F.,"Salinas, CA",117,4,,5.0,7/3/2016,"No complaints! I love their seared tuna salad and we got the BEST steaks we've ever had there. Seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly!  I've only gotten a couple mixed drinks and beers there, but they were very good and service was always really good too. I honestly don't understand why it's got so few stars."
Susanne C.,"Ventura, CA",1,6,,3.0,7/8/2017,"We ended up here because it was a convenient to meet up with friends on our way through town.  It was pretty crowded and we had to wait about 20 mins for a table. That is usually a sign of a good restaurant, but not this time. I was disappointed, as I always am with every bjs I've been to. My opinion is BJs is way overpriced for what you get.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about either. The service was the biggest disappointment this time.   First, the server brought the wrong drinks to the table and passed them all out before realizing she had the wrong table. Then, we got our drinks, but the lemon drop came with salt on the rim instead of sugar. Yuck!  The server took it back and had the bar make a new one. It was good the second time out.   Then that server took a break and we got a new server.  I'm guessing he is still learning because he never asked us if we wanted refills or more to drink and never cleared any of our empty glasses.  We also got our check before our dessert came.  Weird.  Dessert finally came and it was delicious. It was hard to share though with all the empty glasses in the middle of the table.  I am never impressed when I go to a Bjs. This was probably my last visit."
Marily E.,"Shirley, MA",0,4,,1.0,7/25/2017,"SLOW-one could grow OLD waiting for the server to just come and greet us !!! Been here twice and the wait staff is so SLOW!! We even mentioned that the next time we come maybe we should eat at the bar!! All we wanted was to have a drink, rest and then order - it took 18 minutes to be greeted and 26 minutes for our first drink - then the server was very sweet so we felt badly about criticizing her but honestly really rip the bandaid off - if you want a nice night and have a server realize you want your drinks but yet keep it moving along then come here! We just moved to Salinas from back East and fully realize things move more slowly here but come on!!"
Crystal C.,"Houston, TX",144,132,183,5.0,9/2/2015,"I'm glad I stopped in here after shopping at the Salinas, CA mall. This is the FOURTH BJs I have visited sine being all over the country and by far the best experience.  Please, don't get me wrong... The other locations were great, but this one SURPASSES my idea of great & that just means they're supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! LIFE.... it's just too short to waste on mediocre.  If you don't live now, when will u? Hi to BJ's ONE WORD: Clam chowder....yum (3 words, but you know what I'm saying) *haha   The service is simply great and I'm voting this one on my best places to visit in MY world...my tiny little world matters and yours does too!    ##DROPSMIC"
Andres R.,"Ceres, CA",97,17,,4.0,10/3/2016,"Friendly staff, not much of a wait, good food, great deals from time to time, and the manager Micheal is very welcoming and appreciative of the restaurants customers. Will definitely be returning."
Lisa S.,"Watsonville, CA",0,11,1,2.0,7/7/2017,They say 3rd time is a charm so we tried it hoping for a better outcome. We were wrong. The food was ok. The pace of service is horrible. So much so that we will not return.
Lisa G.,"Atascadero, CA",71,459,87,5.0,4/19/2016,"I've had good food, and friendly prompt service every time I've been. Fun atmosphere, lots of TVs to watch the games on. Staff are willing to change the channel to game of your choice if you ask, which is super nice!"
Marc T.,"Salinas, CA",0,5,1,4.0,12/31/2016,"So i decided to give this place another chance and im really impressed with the service. Spencer and Steve really gave me that great positive service. Even though it was a little slow with the food. When Spencer comes around us, he'll inform us about our food. Thank you Spencer for giving me and friends a good experience here."
Breanna H.,"Salinas, CA",255,4,,5.0,12/30/2016,"Just moved to town and my boyfriend and I stopped by here for dinner since it's so close by. We were seated quickly and had amazing service by Spencer! Beer selection was awesome. I had the Mediterranean pita tacos, very good."
Elizabeth V.,"Southwestern Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",80,1,,1.0,7/2/2017,My family and I came to the restraunt and had to wait 30-45 minutes even though we were told we only had to wait 15-20 minutes. Our waiter took about 20 minutes to even come over to ask us what we would like to drink and take our order. They brought everyone's drinks and forgot about my cousin's drink. She had to wait 10 minutes before she got her soda. I had to wait 30-45 minutes to get my 4 tap sampler. Everyone in my family was super irritated by the time we got our food which it took about an hour to get. I was expecting to have good service on my vacation but that wasn't the case here. Super unhappy with the service we got here.
Lisa H.,"East Garrison, CA",16,29,,5.0,10/22/2016,"The hubby and I stopped at BJ's last night and I have to say that we received the absolute best service from our server Anthony!! This guy was the truth, he anticipated our every need which is rare these days. We informed the manager and left him a 25% tip. Great job Anthony"
Mike J.,"Houston, TX",4,35,292,4.0,8/28/2015,"Chili was awesome. Topped with sour cream, onions, grated cheese, and I'm not sure what else.  Half sandwich of turkey ham and bacon was bigger than most half sandwich and soup combos you find at other places. Toasted and warm. Flavor was okay. Nothing over the top.  Had a BJ hefferweizen that was pretty great. Lately I've been into the ales so this was a refreshing change.  Service was pretty quick and fairly attentive although drinks ran out here and there.  The place has several TVs to get your game on and a full bar !  Restaurant is big capacity. Couldn't get the table count. Maybe when I return."
