Sandy W.,"Salinas, CA",2,31,,4.0,7/14/2017,Have been here to eat a couple of times. A little slow but it is a good and it is reasonably priced.
Aimee H.,"San Jose, CA",68,57,61,5.0,8/15/2016,"I had great service yesterday at BJ's. If you ever come here ask for Samantha M. To be your waitress. Her service is on point, plus she's friendly and cute. I'm definitely coming back again to only ask for her.  If I were management I would give her a raise."
JRolando M.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",1,20,1,2.0,6/1/2016,"This place used to be okay, but now every time I go I get a little more disappointed.  Last time I was there with a couple of friends. It took almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive. Once it arrived we had to wait another 8 minutes for the server to bring us silverware... Also, the drinks are full of ice! I had a mojito and finished it in 3 sips."
Colin G.,"Marina, CA",29,376,12,4.0,3/14/2016,"Maybe I'm just hitting some one-off times, or maybe people on here are trying to get free stuff out of the managers there, but this BJ's has exceeded my expectations both times I've been in. It's like a 30-minute drive for us, so we only come up when there's good reason to. And - let's be honest here - the food is just not very good and is more expensive than most similar places in the area. I mean, you're in Salinas: if you want good food, you have at least 20 great Mexican restaurants to choose from and a ton of other good independent places. But, when we do come, the service has been really good. The servers are professional, know the menu really well, and know a lot about the beers. This is in stark contrast to the two BJ's I've been to in Tucson - my only other interaction with the chain - where the servers could only just paraphrase the descriptions written on the menu. It's a nice place too. Clean, comfortable, not too noisy but not too quiet, lots of TVs, etc. It certainly seems to be a popular happy hour spot, but there also aren't many happy hour options in town."
Vanessa G.,"Castroville, CA",7,9,390,4.0,5/5/2015,"I have heard many people talk about their bad experiences here and about the really bad service. Me, being a server myself, care a lot about the service I get in a restaurant so I was very hesitant to try it out. My boyfriend had told me about his experiences in other BJs restaurants and finally convinced me to try it out. I have been here three times since and I must say I have not had any bad experiences. The servers I have had were all really nice and attentive. My food came out at a decent amount of time. Like I said, I work in the restaurant business so I understand the food may take longer depending on how busy a restaurant is.  My boyfriend and I get the artichoke spinach dip every time we go because its so delicious! Last time I went I tried their Balsamic Chicken plate and I honestly loved it! The mashed potatoes it came with were some of the best I've ever had. I wish I could've finished it all but I was so full.  Overall I think everyone should at least give this place a try."
Sadie V.,"Prunedale, CA",0,3,2,1.0,10/28/2016,"First off the service sucks ASS. Lemonade tasted way too sour. My fries were practically frozen, and very stale. I got a huge rash after I ate their food. Horrible service. They take forever and all they do is apologize and don't even give you a discount for taking 30 minutes for a simple order."
Becky R.,"Box Elder, SD",0,3,,1.0,4/28/2017,"I don't understand when I ask for my fries close to being burnt, they come out cold and wimpy. I'm pretty sure the cook doesn't care or my waitresst"
Michelle D.,"Salinas, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/17/2017,"I went to BJS last Sunday for brunch and it is by far on of the worst experiences I've had at any BJS that I've been too. I gave it one star because the server was nice ... But thats about it. We ordered our food it took about an hour to get our food (mind you it was empty) and then when the food came out EVERYTHING WAS COLD. Then we sent it back and it came back out luke warm, and flavorless. The manager approached us and said ""so were good now"" as if that could make up for that unsatisfying meal. I will not be back to this place..."
Becky P.,"Seaside, CA",164,4,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Just terrible.  Service sucked and no one, including the manager, attempted to address the issues we were having.  What was expected to be a 1 hour and 30 minute dinner turned into a 3 hour train wreck.  Not to mention, the party next to us was experiencing the same problems throughout the evening.  Needless to say, we will not be returning here."
Russell W.,"Salinas, CA",0,12,,4.0,5/22/2017,"OK, it's a chain so that makes it drop a star.  Otherwise, there is very little to dislike.  The menu is extensive and has so many options, it's possible to become confused.  The wait staff are really excellent and the drinx are quite nice.  The food is mostly expanded pub food but that's fine.  It's just dark enough, just loud enough and not overpriced.  BJ's has been a very, very welcome addition to the Northside.  I don't think there is a history of problems here, either."
Anne P.,"Monterey, CA",139,182,342,3.0,11/25/2014,"The food is basic bar food but with an upscale higher end feel.  They have a variety of beers and a full bar. Good size TV that are plastered around the walls so that you can watch football, baseball or whatever sport is being shown at the time.  I had the holiday special where I would chose two entrees and two sides. I had the top sirloin and scampi. The sirloin was medium it was delicious didn't need any sauce and it was definitely not dry. The Parmesan crusted scampi it complimented my white cheddar mashed potatoes. The seasoned veggies were a bit on the hard side.  For dessert we had 2 orders of the mini trio pazooki! My favorite flavor were the sea salt caramel and peanut butter. Some were a bit too doughy and not crisp at all around the edges.. But others were baked to perfection.. The white chocolate macadamia was a bit too sweet for me.  Service was alright. I guess she was overwhelmed with MNF and visitors coming from out of town since it is thanksgiving week.. It took awhile to get orders, refill our water.... But what I found weird... The check came out before our desserts! Hmmmm..  To our server... I hope you have a better day today... Try to smile and not just drop the check off.. From table 631"
Bob G.,"Aptos, CA",0,19,4,3.0,3/15/2016,"Given my previous experience at BJ's I begrudgingly agreed to meet up with friends from out of town here. I must say the service has improved. Ryan was our server and he was great; he had a positive attitude, was attentive, checked in on us and followed up on refills. Score one for BJ's for hiring this guy. I have no complaints. I even saw the floor manager walking around looking at tables.  So why only 3 stars? The previous service. If the great service is consistent I will update my rating. I can't be won with one visit. I was in Friday 3/11."
Little S.,"Salinas, CA",4,50,9,2.0,7/27/2016,"Sad to see after all this time they still can't improve. My strawberry mojito was the only good thing when we visited. Ordered appetizers which took long to arrive, stuffed mushrooms were tiny and wings were cold, dry and they had ran out of celery, waitress came by later with a couple but they looked old. I asked for glass of water that never arrived and never came back for check and apperantly we couldn't just pay at the front...... Only went because I had gift card but not going back"
Brandon C.,"Marina, CA",145,11,,1.0,10/17/2015,"The only reason I gave a star was because of the food and drink. The amount of time that it took to get a waiter to get anything more than water was astonishing. One dish came 15-20 minutes before the other dishes at a table of 5, which still took 20-25 minutes to come out on its own. My dish was a small pizza but didn't look entirely presentable, it was just messy and seemed to be thrown on a plate with toppings strewn about. Another plate was missing it's sides, and that had to be brought to the attention of the waiter. When we ordered a trio of pizookies for an obvious three people which was brought to the attention of the waiter, we only received 2 spoons, and had to wait another 10 minutes for just a spoon, which we received a much larger serving or soup spoon. It was frustrating and idiotic. We spent approximately two hours there of which the majority was spent waiting."
Jeff R.,"Watsonville, CA",52,111,3,5.0,8/16/2016,"Been to BJ's many times in the past but our last visit was the best with the superb service from our waitress Amanda.  Entered the restaurant at 7PM on a Thursday night and the hostess said their would be a 15 minute wait for a table.  We opted to get a table in the bar area which is open seating and sat down right away.  There were four of us and each of our meal were great especially the rib special which was a full rack, salad and two sides for the normal price of a half rack. Yep we ended up taking most of our meal home since it was so much food.  Their own beers are tasty and the fairly priced.  Always enjoy the sample route and finishing up with my favorite Jeremiah Red, a wonderful Irish style red. The artistic graphics of the beers is noteworthy."
Barbra S.,"San Francisco, CA",16,1,,1.0,4/16/2017,"This was my first time at BJs and my last. I should have realized from the interaction with the hostess, who was kind of rude, that this wasn't going to be a good experience. She asked if I wanted to sit at the bar because there was no wait.  I said no thank you I would like a booth. She seemed very put out by my asking for a booth and again stated that there was no waiting at the bar... I said we would wait for a booth and she said (in an irritated tone) it would be a 20 minute wait. She then proceeded to seat us less than 5 minutes later(btw the booths stayed half empty for our entire meal) Our server (I forgot his name) was okay....however when our dinner came out my potato was cold and hard. I asked for another one and some steak sauce. My husband eventually had to go get some for me as my steak was getting cold. The steak was so salty that my son ( who loves steak) barely touched it. After some time elapsed the waiter brought another potato, which was hot but still hard. I complained to the server and he said he would take something off the bill or something. Then the manager came over and offered me mashed potatoes?!? I was done with my meal by then so I said no thank you... we got our check and nothing was taken off. My husband didn't want to make a big deal, so we just paid and left... horrible experience overall...(pizookie was good though)"
Joel C.,"Salinas, CA",0,13,1,2.0,4/13/2017,"I've came here a couple of times, the food is always great. Never had a bad experience with the various things i've ordered. What turns me off from this location: is the service. It's always hit or miss; mostly miss. The hosts and hostess always do a great job, theyre there, tell you if theres going to be a wait but the servers on the other hand are terrible. Sure they come and take your order pretty soon after you sit down, but you are basically ignored for the rest of the time. There's been times where I go entire meals without even getting a refill or a server coming over asking if anythings okay, I have to stand up and tell the server if they can refill my drink. Then once you get your check, even if you immediately put the money down, they walk away and leave you waiting for them to come back."
Gio S.,"Gilroy, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/10/2016,Bad pasta very bad drinks we love the one in san mateo it is way better than this one in salinas never ever coming back
LaSaundra G.,"Soledad, CA",36,28,144,3.0,1/8/2016,"So, after my last review I received a voice message from the manager of BJ's and two $50 gift cards via email; tonight we decided to use them.  From the moment we walked in 7:48pm until the moment we walked out 9:30ish, I track the time it took for us to be seated, how long it took for the waitress to our orders, how fast the food came out of the kitchen and overall service. Keeping in mind it was a packed Friday night.  We walked in the hostess backs were toward us chatting amongst themselves. While wait it seemed as if the hostess staff seemed a bit lost on who was next to be seated, the reason why I say that is they asked those of us that were waiting which parties we were with and how many people in our parties. After 24mins of waiting we were seated, not bad from what we were told upon arrival a 20min wait. Our waitress McKay was great very perfessional and friendly. Our food was hot on our table by 8:44pm. As we were walking out again, the hostesses chatting among themselves with their backs towards us as we were leaving the front doors. They didn't even acknowledge us leaving saying thank you or good night, any of that.  With all this said, it was a much better night than December 22, 2015 visit."
Stephanie R.,"Santa Clara, CA",28,50,,3.0,9/30/2016,My favorite thing to order here is Clam Chowder. They're service can be better in the fact that they take forever to bring out the food. but it always taste good. and their root bear is AWESOME
