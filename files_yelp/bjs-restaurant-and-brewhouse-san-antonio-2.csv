Anthony S.,"Norcross, GA",54,7,,4.0,9/27/2017,"Excellent. Peruvian quinoa with salmon was delicious. Salmon was a touch crispy on top for my taste but the tomatoes, mushrooms, and rich quinoa were just what I was looking for.  If you like theirs tomato sauce then I'd recommend the dish. Either way job well done. Excellent service for moderate $$"
Shawn W.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",122,470,2428,3.0,10/22/2017,"Good service, good selection, and a good amount of deals offered at BJs.  I lived near a BJs in Maryland and never went to it.  It was one of those.  Oh I have time to go and time ran out.  Luckily moving here there is a BJs not too far from me.  I am glad there is as on my few visits to this place it offers some pretty good food and adult libations.   I have gone here mainly at lunch time and service has always been quick and attentive during the higher volumes.  Checkout their daily brewhouse specials they have going on Monday through Thursday and score a deal.  Also I would suggest downloading the BJs app to your phone so you can earn credits to freebies and get your free birthday gift from them.  The bartenders are friendly and do a pretty good job on the mix drinks as I have sampled more than a few drinks.  I am usually not a beer drinker but they offer this one particular cider known as berry burst.  I am a cider guy and this is one of those ciders I wish they sold in stores.  A very tasty in house brew to enjoy. The food is on par with many other chains that fill this spot in serving this particular selection of food and the choices are much the same.  One big difference is that BJs offers pizza.  They offer what is referred to as deep dish pizzas but to me it is not truly a deep dish pizza that you might be thinking of if you are thinking of a Chicago deep dish pizza.  It is more of a thick pan pizza and the crust is very airy and light.  Good pizza but everyone seems to be finicky when it comes to pizza.  It is on the level of many nationwide pizza chains.  The appetizers I have tried are pretty good but like the pizza it is on the level of many other chains. Good spot to have some food.  I don't think it will let you down but for me it did not wow me in terms of the food.  Now the drinks I will say were something that will have me returning."
Donovan T.,"San Antonio, TX",314,372,371,5.0,9/1/2017,"I have become a regular to BJ's. BJ's brews their own beer and it is amazing. When I come to BJ's for a beer I only drink their personally brewed beers. They have some custom beer mixes that you can choose from as well. I usually get the Hopstorm mixed with the stout. This was my first visit to this location. It was also my first time using the BJ's app. The app is really cool. You can keep track of your rewards, place a call ahead reservation, pay your bill and more.  Our waitress was on top of things. Come to think of it I don't think I have ever had bad service at BJ's.  Keep an eye of for their specials. On this visit they had a half rack of ribs, 2 sides and a mini pazooki for 13 bucks. The half rack was enough for me. Once we were ready to leave all I had to do was use ApplePay on the BJ's app and our transaction was seamlessly complete."
Brent L.,"San Antonio, TX",256,706,1301,5.0,8/3/2017,"Great options for carnivores as well as vegans!  I had the Superfood salad which was humongous and full of superfoods such as blueberries, kale, etc.  See the description on the menu. The GF had the Mediterranean chicken tacos on pita bread and it looked so good and she said it was good too. Service was great - about a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night around 6pm wasn't too bad either. Crazy dessert options too - try the baked beignet loaded with ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream.  Devilishly delicious but like half the calories of the Pizookies that they have on their menus.  If you do want a Pizookie, sign up for the rewards club before you go and you can get a free one!"
Aimee J.,"San Antonio, TX",81,22,12,4.0,1/6/2018,"I love the food. Great variety and healthy options. The veggies I had with the salmon was delicious! The beer is pretty boring. Not really a craft beer kind of place, but the service and atmosphere was excellent."
Abg G.,"San Antonio, TX",6,69,221,5.0,12/5/2017,This is my 1st time but I think I will like out because I am hungry lol. It's close by work lobby very clean. Service so far so good. If it's  all good I will return but for drinks hehe. Joann C she was great server.
Sarah F.,"San Antonio, TX",26,223,7,2.0,7/30/2017,We came for lunch on a Saturday. We were seated right away and the place was not busy. We ordered our food and it took over 30 minutes to come out. The root beer wings tasted like plain BBQ and they were not even hot. The thin crust cheese pizza was not cooked all the way and was soggy. The Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were a disappoint. The quinoa mix was very good though. Extremely slow service to receive cold soggy food.
Adrian Z.,"San Antonio, TX",0,14,2,1.0,12/3/2017,"So I'm back, because out of town guests chose this location. Place is still half ass. My guests ordered beer flights and one of them had a cracked glass. He asked for it to be replaced and they topped off the glass with beer and brought the same glass back. He brought it to her attention again, that time it was fixed. A sirloin was ordered at my table medium well. It came well done and charred on one side almost like it was forgotten. BJs charges quite a bit for their food. None of it should be anything less than ordered. I don't care for a redo  like last time or my money back. I just want to tell people that expect BJs food to go to the RIM location."
Pam B.,"Bastrop, TX",15,139,,4.0,8/15/2017,"What a wonderful meal and time my daughter and I had here yesterday! We were having some mother and daughter bonding time before she delivers her first baby next month. She had a salad and tea while I had not one but two of the $5 house margaritas and the chicken sandwich fully loaded..all so good , very good but the star of the meal was our phenomenal waiter, Keenan. He was so nice, so funny, so informative and please do yourself a favor and GO and do what it takes to have Keenan for an extraordinary experience!! I highly recommend a visit!"
Sarah G.,"San Antonio, TX",17,75,64,4.0,8/13/2017,This place is definitely a go to when we want good food at a good price. The menu options are endless and the pizookies are so good! Love the flatbread pizzas but my go to is definitely the Parmesan crusted chicken with DOUBLE MASH.Mmmmm. The drinks are good but expect to pay $9 or more for a tasty margarita. I love the rewards you get through the app definitely worth signing up for. Also like that you can pay on your app. This location has been open about 6 years now I would say and I have never had a bad experience. I usually use the app check in and save a lot of time from waiting for a table. Have never had an issue with service either.
Anthony R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,12,,5.0,11/24/2017,"Absolutely love this place!!! My server Marlyna was so amazing. She's serving me the best drinks and the best food! An absolute perfect ending to my weekend. Service is great, no wait, the GM came and stopped by to check on us. 100 out of 5 stars. Will continue to come as long as it's open"
Paul B.,"San Antonio, TX",35,17,9,5.0,3/10/2017,"*** March 10, 2017 Update ***. They the new Brewhouse Slow-Roasted menu selections.  Try the prime rib or the Double thick bone in pork chop!  You can't go wrong. *** *** Update *** If you read my review below it may have sounded negative. Let me assure you they have the BEST customer service in San Antonio. In addition, their management reads YELP reviews. We were told by the floor manager that the Smoores Pizzokie is coming back. They remembered the feedback they received and took care of their customers!  Thanks Brady, Matt, Rachael, Gabriel, and the rest of the amazing staff.  We come here all the time because they have good food and a great staff. Someone made a BAD menu decision taking the smoores pizzokie off the menu."
Stephanie M.,"San Antonio, TX",20,28,24,5.0,7/18/2017,We went on a Thursday night and we were seated promptly. We ordered the special which was a half rack of ribs two sides and a dessert. We also ordered two drinks and a flatbread pizza. The food at BJ's is so tasty and comes out quickly and hot all the time. For all that food we spent $30 which we thought was a great deal we love BJ's and we will always be back.
Bryan B.,"San Antonio, TX",47,231,170,3.0,7/19/2017,"Place is a bit pricy, they brew their own beer, they have a nice variety.  I like their pazookie dessert, it's pretty good. Food is mediocre. Nothing too much out of ordinary modern American fare."
Cindy P.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",40,4,,5.0,11/6/2017,"I love coming here. The food is always good, pretty much no matter what I get. The menu is big and the service is great"
Ashley K.,"Denver, CO",45,119,53,3.0,6/20/2016,"Ordered spinach artichoke dip, a small deep dish pizza, and the pizookie trio.  The dip was really good.  The pizza was super soggy and under-cooked.  The cookies were good in taste but were cemented into their little container, so very difficult to eat. We did have a really great waiter, I think his name was Brendan. Answered all our questions and was very helpful."
Molly S.,"San Antonio, TX",2,11,,5.0,10/18/2017,"BJ's has become one of our favorites! We've been coming here every Friday night for our date night since we moved here 4 months ago. We have had great service and food every time. Their beer is amazing!! We haven't tried the whole menu yet, we tend to stick to the tavern pizza, boneless wings, burgers, and ribs. We have not had a bad meal yet and the waitstaff is outstanding!"
Tenecqua D.,"San Antonio, TX",4,9,24,2.0,10/15/2017,This visit has gotten off to a horrible start. Myself and my family was seated. 15 minutes went by without any acknowledgement from any of the waitstaff. I had to approach the hostess stand to get a waiter to even take our drink order. This is completely ridiculous. Hopefully the rest of our visit goes off without any further issue.
Sandy C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,,5.0,10/13/2017,Tonight I ordered BJs through DoorDash and when my order arrived my pizza was missing. I called BJs manager David and he was amazing! He understood my problem and the General Manager Everette delivered my pizza to my home within 30 minutes!! Excellent customer service!!!  Every manager should be like these guys!!
Robert A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,4.0,12/15/2017,Very relaxed atmosphere. Great selection of micro brew beer. Food is very well presented and tasty. Service is fast and on point.
Fernando M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,5,2.0,9/24/2017,"Skip the pickup option, the food tasted like it was previously refrigerated.  The food is much better when you dine in.  The review is just for picking up your food."
Devin O.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",39,110,31,5.0,4/11/2017,"Mmmmm fresh pizza. I can't get enough of the Mediterranean Pizza here. Way to delicious when it comes out fresh from the oven. It never does taste the same as leftovers so I recommend consumption be done in one bite. Large selection of craft beers and IPA (whatever the hell that is) hipster beer. And TVs are everywhere at every angle, this way you can pretend to pay attention to your fancy while actually watching NASCAR or the NBA."
Sarah J.,"San Antonio, TX",96,247,213,2.0,1/2/2017,"5 years ago, I loved BJ's. It was a frequent hangout spot for brews (Love that they have Hoegaarden on tap, and a similar citrus wheat bear of their own!) and flatbread pizza or apps with friends, and I almost always sat at the high top bar tables. My husband and I even went on our first date at BJ's back then.  Unfortunately, as the restaurant has settled into its prime, frequently busy Alamo Ranch location, everything has gone down hill. Not just the service, not just the food...everything. It's awful to watch a fun spot decline like this!! We've known this for awhile, but a few days ago one of our couple friends wanted to have dinner-date night there, so we gave it another shot. I got excited when we walked in because the hostess was extremely friendly. As soon as we sat down, the tone changed. We asked for a table for 5 and a high chair when we were seated, and the table they gave us was a booth. When we reminded our waitress about the high chair, she said she wasn't allowed to put it at that table. Fine; understandable. However, the 5th adult in our party wasn't there yet and we let him know not to come because there wasn't enough room at the table. The rest of the restaurant looked to busy to move spots. One meal down for the waitress (and her tip.)  We ordered and there was a whole issue amongst our party over the beers offered. My husband just wanted a Bud Light or Budweiser, but none on tap. He ordered one of their supposedly similar house brews to try it, but it tasted terrible (and nothing like Budweiser so I don't know why the waitress pointed it out.) Okay. The couple we were with went back and forth with the waitress about the correct way a Black & Tan vs. a Snakebite should be made. Now they may have been wrong - I'm no beer officianado - but the waitress arguing with them was really not acceptable either. A few beers down for the waitress (so of course a lower bill to follow.) Food was an issue in itself that the manager actually did attempt to handle, and did a decent job. The kitchen brought out our meals but they had burned my husband's Root Beer Ribs, so the FoH Manager came to apologize and promised they would be out soon. Soon wasn't exactly the case though, they came out just under 20 minutes later after the rest of us had almost finished our food. However, the manager DID comp them from the bill. Another meal down for the waitress, though we made up for the $10 in tip because we don't like to take things for free; that's certainly not why I use Yelp. The small plate of fried asparagus was chewy and took strength to bite through. My avocado spring rolls were as delicious as I remember them. Drink refills were few and far between, but the waitress also looked very busy.  Overall, with the drink and food issues, and the waitress's terrible attitude and rudeness, I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. The one thing keeping BJ's from getting a 1 star review from me is the manager's attempt to at least appease his customers, and his attentiveness to the floor when it was necessary. It seems like since he's providing so much help, the wait staff could try a little harder to work with him!! My Yelp rating system: 5 stars= Add this to your bucket list! 4 stars= I would recommend visiting. 3 stars= Average, acceptable, positive. 2 stars= You might be able to drag me in.  1 star= I will definitely not be returning."
Amber S.,"San Antonio, TX",14,124,49,5.0,9/7/2016,"I am a huge fan of this location. I have been here twice and it has not disappointed either time. I love love love the pink Cadillacs!!!!!! They are super yummy. They are super strong. Just fabulous. Not a fan of ""couscous"" but I don't think it's BJs. I just don't think I'd like it no matter who was serving it. It's just weird.  The service was spectacular tonight. We sat and we drank a few drinks and we ordered an app. Then we had a couple more drinks and ordered our entrées. Not once were we rushed or did we feel rushed.  Just a little bit of advice. THE STEAKS. My mom ordered a steak rare. First it came out well done and then medium well. So avoid the steaks if you like them juicy. If you like them done and dry then you're in luck! BJs is ur place!!!  That was the only issue and we did not feel it warranted losing a star. After all, it's a brew house, not a steak house. There are plenty of wonderful, unique choices on the menu besides steaks. The salmon is to die for!  Just a great experience and we were super pleased."
Jordan A.,"San Antonio, TX",3,2,,5.0,8/30/2017,Decided to try out BJ's today for lunch for the first time and I was actually impressed. My server nando suggested a loaded burger with bottomless fries and when I told him I liked dark beers he got me the tatonka stout which was perfect. Great beer and even better service
Sleazy T S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,29,21,1.0,1/29/2017,"Went here a while ago and one of the people I had gone with ordered a sandwich of some kind with bacon. Well the bacon wasn't even cooked. Ok maybe a little bit probably about 2-3 seconds on each side. I honestly believe had they eaten it they would have gotten sick. Probably hospital sick. This sort of thing is completely inexcusable. When you build a sandwich and you don't even see that the bacon was WAY WAY undercooked. You should find another career choice.  The manager was kind enough to remove it from our bill but to be honest with you , it put me off for even my food."
Chris G.,"Kingston, NY",0,8,,1.0,11/15/2017,"Poor experience from the get go. Restaurant was nearly empty, yet we waited 20 minutes for a table of 6. Drink refills(paid, and of the alcohol kind) were not offered throughout service. Food came out intermittently and then a fish and chips entree was delivered nearly 10 minutes after every one else. Clearly something is slipping here as we have eaten here several times in the past, but quality and service are not where they need to be."
Laura D.,"San Antonio, TX",8,4,1,3.0,7/21/2017,Great food but horrible service. Beverages are supposed to be unlimited refills but I had to hunt down the waitress to get a second glass of tea and then wait forever to get sweetners. If they are short staffed they need to get more waiters!
Cynthia F.,"Houston, TX",10,15,5,2.0,8/20/2017,"Service was horrible, I understand why there were so many empty tables.  No comparison to Houston both service and food quality."
Sara S.,"San Antonio, TX",58,58,93,5.0,2/21/2017,"Sign up for their rewards program, check out their menu ahead, download their app and your gonna want to be a regular customer!  *hands down great for kids! (6 month, 5yr old, 4 yr old) *Their cocktails  wow wow wow *Food -bison burger  delicious   -Ahi tuna salad  delicious  no chopsticks though! -kids meals are good portions! *SERVICE GREAT SERVICE!!!!!"
Bruce W.,"Hondo, TX",6,66,203,2.0,10/5/2015,"Waitress was pleasant and somewhat knowledgeable regarding the kitchen preparation of the food.  Started with the artichoke dip. It came to the table piping hot and creamy, very good. Had ravioli for entrée, it was piled high with cheese so you had to dig to get to the ravioli. It was more like eating a thick lasagna. Flavor was not good. It is way over priced. I will only eat here again if I am getting the bison burger. Service was top notch"
Niki C.,"San Antonio, TX",27,36,16,5.0,4/7/2017,"Came back and was blown out of the water. Our server Vanessa was awesome! Everything tasted great and her beer suggestions were on point. We didn't tell anyone about us because management asked us to come back so they can rectify but I honestly feel you truly don't get the good sense on if it was fixed if you do that. Even the management was walking around checking on people. I feel like it definitely got better or it had an off night the night we went. Regardless, awesome!! Ty"
Alberto C.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",172,1,,5.0,11/13/2017,This is a fantastic restaurant. Good clean atmosphere and great drink selection. What made my experience wasn't just the food but the service Derek was an outstanding server who went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. Never did he have us wondering where he was and made sure our drinks were always full. Easy going to talk to and wasn't one of those servers you try to get away from the table as soon as he dropped off the food. I live on the other side of town and would be personally driving to this location just to request him as our server again.
Sadia K.,"San Antonio, TX",67,178,78,2.0,11/6/2016,"Service is extremely slow. We waited for almost 40 minutes for everything to come. while my husband and I enjoyed the tavern style pizza chicken pesto, the rest of the group had mixed feelings. One said the steak was on the drier side. another didnt enjoy their short ribs. Our pizza, while being good, was not cut in equal pieces which was a little odd. But we enjoyed it nevertheless. There is a long wait at bjs so its better to book in advance. while we were  content with our food, our group vowed never to come back again."
Leigh B.,"San Antonio, TX",17,67,29,4.0,1/17/2017,"BJ's knows how to cook good food. Everything is delicious and they post calories if you are watching your weight. Service is professional and friendly. I like to eat here as often as I can and I like to try different things because no matter what I order, it's going to be tasty."
Erick Alberto M.,"San Antonio, TX",105,4,,5.0,5/29/2017,"Our dish was perfect, drinks on point. My fiancé and I had a blast here. Already a regular in this place, and probably be coming more often."
Pam M.,"San Antonio, TX",56,206,935,5.0,8/27/2015,"Where to start? Service and food was awesome. We started with potato skins and mushrooms.  Then the California Flatbread. Ended with a trio of desserts. Cookies and cream,  salted caramel and white chocolate macadamia. Yummy!! Service and food was perfect. Prices were great.  Awesome menu variety.  This was our first time and we will definitely be back! New fav! Don't forget to download the app to save money and earn points! ! We say at the bar and had an awesome experience."
Josh O.,"San Antonio, TX",2,2,,3.0,7/10/2017,I've been here twice in about a weeks span and both times the food was great. But the service was sooooo slow it was almost unbearable. We got our appetizers almost immediately before our food arrived..and it took about an hour to get the appetizers.  We also were visited by the server very infrequently for such a slow day. And our whole table had empty glasses for a good half our before we get another refill. Overall not the best experience.
Tj C.,"San Antonio, TX",1,40,3,2.0,7/1/2017,Be here about 5 times food is always good. Today was not the day the service was slow and the food was not very good I don't know if I'll ever go back it was that bad hopefully they get their act together
Robert P.,"Hinesville, GA",50,22,45,5.0,6/13/2017,"First time at BJ's. Food was delicious . Best ribs I've had in a restaurant in a long time. My wife had a salmon dish and she loved it. If you've never ate here, you have to eat here"
