Cowboy J.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,19,,2.0,5/11/2013,I was here on a Thursday night about a month ago with my neighbors at 9pm.  It took us 50+ minutes to get our food. The last item that came out? The steamed vegetables for one of the kids. I was not aware that it takes that long to steam vegetables. Baked potato arrived at the table stone cold.  We hardly saw our waitress. Sorry BJ's that is unacceptable.
Liz F.,"Pasadena, TX",0,6,,3.0,3/10/2014,"I'm new to the area, but I would often go to the BJ's back home in Houston. I went the other night with my fiancé because I was craving their fish and chips. Since this is a chain restaurant, I expected for everything to taste like the food back home, which it did for the most part. The fish had a nice crisp and it wasn't oily, but my fries were cold. Also, my strawberry lemonade was overwhelmingly too sweet. I would go back, but with some reservations. The service was okay, but I hate cold food."
S And B D.,"Minneapolis, MN",12,208,17,3.0,6/18/2011,Nice atmosphere with average food and decent service. I did not think their light micro brew was good.
Michele J.,"Monument, CO",5,9,,5.0,10/15/2011,"One of our most favorite places to eat! We go probably once a month with our family of three boys. We also love to bring out-of-town visitors here. The menu is extensive, so everyone can find something they like. They have their own root beer, which is awesome! My boys always love their kids meals and they are reasonably priced. I have had their sandwiches, salads, pizzas -- all great. Huge portions...fun atmosphere...great service...reasonable prices...we love BJs! Our kids even ASK to go when we tell them we're going out to dinner!"
Shauna V.,"San Antonio, TX",12,28,7,5.0,6/8/2011,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!  I can honestly say I have nothing to complain about.  Food was yummo and the service was outstanding!  My husband and I sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful with our beer AND food selections.  She was also very attentive.  We will definitely be back for more beer and grub and will highly recommend to everybody!
Gloria V.,"San Antonio, TX",3,52,16,1.0,6/22/2013,"The food is great.  However I'm VERY dissatisfied with how I  felt rushed throughout my meal.  I had barely been eating, less than half way through the meal, and our server says, "" can I get a dessert started for you so it'll be ready when you're  done?""  To which I reply no.  I know I want a dessert, but I'm not sure yet if I'm going to have room for it once I finish eating.  Within two minutes she brings the ticket to the table, and were still eating.  We were never offered another beverage, even though we where eating in the bar area and having an adult beverage oth our meal.  She was in such a hurry to get us out of there, she took the bill without our payment, only to have  to come back for payment!   Did I mention, WE Were Not Finished!  AND THETE WAS NO LINE OF PEOPLE WAITING TO GET INTO THE RESTAURANT!  Rude service!!!  And my free water, was never refilled the entire time we were there! Despite how. Much  I enjoy the menu items. This will be my absolute last time to go to that BJ's, and perhaps, to any other location since management said that was BJ'S's policy to place the ticket on the table before the customers finish eating.  I really can appreciate that concept at lunch time, but on a leisurely Saturday date night?  What a frustrating end to what I expected to be a fun evening.  I would not have left the restaurant as soon as we did.  But by the time the server came to rush back for our ticket payment, and yet never a drink refill, I felt very unwanted there!  HUGE MISTAKE!"
lucia n.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,,2.0,12/27/2012,"My meal came out at least 20 minutes before my boyfriends, so it was the dilemma of do I eat in front of him, or wait and then eat cold food.  He pushed me to eat, so I did, and then asked for coffee, which was served to me ice cold.  Had ask repeatedly to get a refill of water, and never did get our condiments.  Food was nothing special, doubt we will be back."
Allison P.,"Waelder, TX",60,48,228,4.0,4/13/2011,"Ate at two , one in California and then in San Antonio.  Both were great!  Drinks are insanely overpriced ( chain..what do you expect?). Had the ahi poke   appetizer and the shrimp lettuce wraps .  Lite and delicious!  The quality was the same great level at both restaurants.  Tried one of their micro brews and it was tasty and worth a repeat despite cost.  This place is now a definite ""go-to""."
Melanie H.,"San Antonio, TX",229,5,21,5.0,7/1/2011,"Always a pleasant experience.  The hostess are kid and waitstaff is knowlegable.  Everyone I know loves the pizza, but I always get the tilapia and a cup of broccoli cheese soup (best in town in my opinion).  I always love my food and if I did not order a cocktail...the freshmade rootbeer is to die for...and you get free refills.  We love the restaurant7"
Michele W.,"Humble, TX",160,59,9,5.0,4/8/2011,"Yet another wonderful restaurant we found using Yelp! We had such a great server! Wonderful food, drinks and service. Couldn't have asked for better."
Brent D.,"San Antonio, TX",1,5,3,4.0,11/6/2011,"Great BJ's.  They have the most beer choices of any of the BJ's.  The service is good, although a little green.  I'm sure they will get better with time."
Mike C.,"Helotes, TX",36,4,8,2.0,6/20/2010,"First of all, my rating is low because of the overall experience.  I believe that BJ's has the potential to be a great place to hang out and drink some great micro-brew beers, but not the best place to actually sit down and eat.  This was my first attempt to visit BJ's, and I hope that my problems were growing pains of a busy newly opened restaurant.   We arrived around 6pm and were seated in around 15 minutes, which was pretty good considering how packed the place was.  We sat down and promptly looked over the 12 page menu.  The food selection is huge, but they seem to highlight the beer menu in the very front which has a rainbow of custom brewed beers.  I ordered their Imperial Stout, which actually was on of the best I have had.  Then the appetizer came.  We ordered the Avocado egg rolls, which looked delicious on the menu and the waitress gave them raving reviews.  They were perfectly fried egg rolls with a large lump of warm Avocado, with a couple subtle seasonings.  Biting into the outer shell of the egg roll was crispy and delicious until the warm avocado squirts into your mouth like you just bit into a giant bug(not that I have eaten a giant bug, but that is what I was imagining).  I could have gotten past the texture if there had been even a hint of flavor to make up for it, but I was very disappointed.  The dipping sauce was excellent and was sweet with a bit of zing, but they only served us enough sauce for about 1 of the egg rolls. After the appetizer was over, I was ready for my main course, a medium New York Strip steak.  The waiter drops my food by and asks me to check my steak and then runs off.  I checked the steak and it was cooked to the point that it was like chewing on leather.  I waited around 10 minutes for the waitress to return to send it back.  She took my steak and said she would bring the manager by.  The manager never showed up.  Right as my wife was finishing up her meal my steak arrived.  Luckily they had done it right this time.  I was so upset by then that it was difficult to enjoy.  I wouldn't call it a great steak, but my second steak was cooked correctly.  I will give BJ's a second chance in a few months, but only for beers and appetizers. To summarize, if you are looking for good food and service, go down the street to Red Robin and only come to BJ's if you are looking for some good craft beers."
Christian T.,"San Antonio, TX",90,36,3,5.0,10/6/2010,This place is fantastic!! great house beers!! great deep dish pizzas! and an even better atmosphere! I would recommend to anyone!!
Andrew E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,8,,3.0,4/23/2011,"My wife and I have been here several times. Each time has been a very different experience. Either the food or the service is off. If I recieved a consistant experience a fourth or even fifth star would be easy. Their beer is very good and the grilled pork chops and chedder mashed potatos are excellent. However, one of us leaves dissatisfied every time. I hope it improves because I enjoy the menu and atmosphere."
Mark S.,"San Antonio, TX",2,27,3,3.0,9/9/2012,"I've been a fan of BJ's for several years now and it's good to have one fairly close to the house here. Being a chain (and I'm not really a fan of chains) I find that the food and drink here is dependable. It's obvious that other people have had bad experiences. These things happen, but everyone is due for an off-day once in a while. I'm just a little more easy going when it comes to restaurants and that's why I enjoy it here; I don't have high expectations. We came here yesterday for a beer and a snack. We ordered a couple pints (their Oktoberfest and Hopstorm IPA) and shared a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was awesome! Granted the pizza wasn't mind-blowing but it's a chain restaurant/brewpub, what do people expect? I'm not going to sing to heavens about how great BJ's is, but if you want a nice cold pint, good bar food, and watch the game (and if BW3 is packed) then this is your place. If you set your expectations at the right level, you'll enjoy it here."
Sarah T.,"Houston, TX",75,11,,5.0,6/28/2012,"I am VERY surprised that this place only had 3 1/2 stars.... This place is PHENOMENAL!!! I am so impressed with every aspect of this place. The place is impeccably clean and beautiful. The staff is very well trained, super friendly, and seem to genuinely enjoy being there. They have such a huge selection of delicious food that they have page numbers on their menu. And i think it runs into the teens lol. They have an amazing happy hour with half price apps and mini pizza. I'm not a big pizza fan, but I'm a big fan of these. There is even an option for wheat crust or flatbread. They have a reverse happy hour too for a late night snack. Nice place to take your family, have a girls happy hour, or to chill and watch a game. Mike the GM really impressed me today when our waiter made a teeny tiny mistake that was no problem but still came to our table and offered to make everything right. He was friendly and professional and I was very impressed with him. I could eat here every day. Make sure you leave room for a pazookie. Delish :)"
