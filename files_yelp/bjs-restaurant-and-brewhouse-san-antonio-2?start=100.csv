Tim G.,"San Antonio, TX",23,56,8,5.0,6/5/2015,"Haven't been back to BJ's for some time--not close enough and we don't eat out as often since going on our diet. But we always eat well when we do go.  I got the Buffalo burger, great chipotle and chili peppers topping, really delicious burger, and only 630 calories. Subbed out the cole slaw for asparagus, they were wonderful.  Wife had dinner salad and broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl. Great bread, very tasty soup.  We split the three mini pizookie dessert. Triple chocolate, peanut butter, and white chocolate macadamia nut topped w ice cream, absolutely to die for.  Mrs. enjoyed a strawberry and rum something, I had the four beer sampler. Didn't care much for the Jeremiah Red, too sweet at the start, and way too bitter hops aftertaste, but that's just me.  Server was excellent, as always. Shout out to Jeremy! Will most definitely be back again."
Gail V.,"San Antonio, TX",12,14,2,5.0,3/3/2016,"Don't know what you're hungry for? B.J.s has it all & the staff at this location is always so friendly. I love their pasta dishes. I just wish they would come with 2 Garlic Knots. They are so good, one is just not enough. Want something lighter? Try one of the soups in the bread bowl! The lid is so yummy. Try a Cucumber Jalapeño Margaritaso good! This place is always clean, friendly & service is great."
Lisa S.,"San Antonio, TX",166,411,9,4.0,10/31/2014,"I enjoyed lunch here with some coworkers. The restaurant has a big wide open feel to it and is nicely decorated. We thought the servers were very good, very friendly. There is a good variety of both meals and drinks, something for everyone here. The lunch menu was good, reasonably priced I thought. I would certainly recommend it, especially if you are eating with a large group."
Daniel W.,"San Antonio, TX",29,122,137,2.0,10/6/2015,"Came here yesterday with the pops for a quick lunch and were quickly seated. Given menus and time to order. We decided on spinach artichoke dip, raviolis, and a deep dish pizza. Our waitress was friendly and prompt bringing out drinks and refills, while the bjs team was quick to bring out our dip. The artichoke dip wasn't bad, wasn't amazing, but could have been better with maybe some bread instead of the tortilla chips that are provided. Our entrees came out quickly and I asked for one of they're specialty root beers with my meal. Unfortunately for me, it wasn't working, so I had to settle for a cream soda, and was ever so disappointed. Onto the food, the raviolis were more like a lasagna bake that was not good. Too much cheese to cover up too little flavor, however the garlic bread was delicious, maybe they should have used these for the dip? On to my deep dish pizza, it was kinda warm, but not hot, eerie because it supposedly just came out of the oven?? It was also not bad, but will not be ordered again by me. I like their regular crust pizza better. All in all, it was a bad experience at a place I have enjoyed before, so hopefully next visit will bring better eats."
Kevin T.,"San Antonio, TX",10,77,71,4.0,3/4/2015,"Another good trip in the books. We had multiple appetizers and all were pretty good. The calamari was a little short, mostly legs and not rings (see pic). The local beer was fantastic as always and the service was acceptable but not outstanding."
Logan F.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,59,17,5.0,5/28/2015,One of my favorite places close by!  The beer is always good and the service is always spot on! I have tried many of the items bait my favorite are the hamburgers!  Never had one that did not make me happy!
Ashley C.,"San Antonio, TX",99,34,212,3.0,10/23/2014,This place is decent. Meh... NOTHING to write home about.. kinda pricey for what they offer. They didn't have any drink or food specials...LAME I did like the parmesan crusted chicken and the endless fresh lemonade.
Casey K.,"Bellingham, WA",7,76,97,3.0,12/15/2013,"Game day Happy Hour!!! Vast menu, wonderful selections, and a clean atmosphere. I love this place! I would give the full 5 stars if they still played the sound on Cowboys games."
Amy W.,"San Antonio, TX",40,49,8,4.0,2/13/2015,"I went here with the family expecting only pizza and beer and I was pleasantly surprised to find an extensive menu and lots of choices for the kids! They even have craft beers on tap and kids menus with crayons! The whole family loves it! The staff was so professional, friendly and attentive! I will be back BJs!"
Paul P.,"San Antonio, TX",53,499,2051,2.0,12/15/2014,"Service was lacking. Clueless really. This guy Nicholas didn't put my drink order in, I'm waiting a long time for simple refills. Incompetent service spoiled my business lunch. Alamo Ranch is often a disappointment. Food is good though. I have had way better service at the 281 location."
Kelsey B.,"Boerne, TX",271,7,,1.0,2/28/2016,Our server was very nice but the wait on drinks and food was terrible.I was with a group of 4 people and when we  ordered a drink  it didn't come to us for about 15 min and the place wasn't even busy. It took about 30 min for just the appetizer to come out and when it did they burned the spinach dip and had to re due it which took an extra 15 min until that came out. My friends meal was cold and My California chicken club sandwich was burned as well. The bread was toasted completely black even the server begged to take it back to the kitchen. This was definitely not a location I would like to go back to
Eliana C.,"San Antonio, TX",44,13,15,1.0,8/30/2014,"I won't waste much words because I already wasted a date night and my dignity.  So I had been fighting with my boyfriend about how he was neglecting me and not taking me out enough. A friend of mine raved about BJ's and I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about...warm watered down margaritas and cold food. Not even the server could suggest a meal, he confessed he didn't eat there much. Worse thing was spending over 80$ on this lousy meal, I could have bought clothes."
John P.,"Lowell, IN",1,11,1,4.0,9/1/2015,"Hefeweizen beer is the best, followed closely by he brown ale.  Food is good, but just too many things in the menu.  Service was very good at this location.  Would definitely come back."
Michelle N.,"San Antonio, TX",19,36,29,5.0,6/11/2014,"I love this place and their happy hours. They have half price appetizers and specials on their house wines drafts and cocktails during happy hour . I usually order the sliders. They're way bigger and juicier than any sliders I've ever tasted . Not to bring up Applebee's, but please don't use their sliders as a reason not to order here. I almost did and I'm glad I didn't go with my gut . They were so good . If given the option to add on Fries for a dollar, you definitely should . It's definitely worth it ! Don't let the name scare you off either! They're definitely a lot more reserved then they're name entails. I've been twice in the last week, and plan to go back this Friday! Definitely give this place a try."
Mike R.,"Helotes, TX",42,103,113,2.0,8/16/2015,"BJ's was busy on this Saturday night as one would expect. Our server was fairly attentive and well versed in their vast menu. We had the ""manager"" over to the table to explain the difference in the ""new"" plates they were now using. I had questioned our server about the quantity of our Calamari appetizer. The photo on the menu was why we ordered it. The portion and the presentation were sub standard to the pic. So here's the funny part, the manager takes a couple of wasted moments trying to justify the portion was the same as the pic. Not so.  Just for the record, the portion wasn't that bad it just wasn't close to the picture on the menu.  So I, with a smile, say ""just change the menu out to your new plate arrangement to match pic to what you serve"". I get back from her, ""do you know how much it costs to change our menus out?"" Like I even care by this point. She does offer to bring out more calamari as a backhanded gesture just to pacify me. No thanks.  Disappointed to say the least..."
Adriana N.,"San Antonio, TX",5,6,2,1.0,8/30/2014,I've been to this location a few times. The first time the service was bad and the waitress never came back to our table after our initial order. Another waiter was kind enough to take notice & get refills for our drinks.  Today was just as bad if not worse. The noodles were over cooked and the sauce had no flavor. I normally don't return food & I suck up but this was not edible. I did get it replaced with the Parmesan chicken which was great but the waiter  was rude for the rest of the evening. I know it wasn't his fault for the food but it wasn't mine either. This is the was the last straw. I will never dine or recommend this place again.  Overall bad service & management!!!
Vivian Q.,"San Antonio, TX",144,199,729,5.0,9/1/2014,"Great food and always awesome service. Todays menu: maui Glazed Pork Chop (super yum) glazed in a sweet and tangy sauce. California club sandwich with a wedge salad and thin crispy fries. Washed these down with a blond beer and handcrafted draft root beer, for desert peanut butter s'more pizookie. Check pics and special thanks to our server ""Austin"" sure appreciate the extra attention with our meal and keeping an extra eye on anything we may need he was quick, smiley and polite."
Marnie S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,4.0,7/22/2016,LOVE their sirracha Brussel sprouts!! Best item they have put on their menu. Also love making my own mini pizza on flatbread with my favorite ingredients. It's a weekly stop for those 2 menu items.
Jade M.,"San Antonio, TX",204,644,1575,4.0,9/10/2014,"I'm definitely a fan of BJ's. Almost everything that I have tried I have enjoyed. My favorites are the Atlantic salmon with rice pilaf and steamed veggies, the California Club sandwich, the Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread, the Mediterranean tacos, and the traditional wings appetizer. My parents are big fans of their Piranha Pale Ale Chili and the gluten free thin crust pizza, and my boyfriend likes their New Orleans Jambalaya and the Crispy Jalapeno burger. The food is pretty consistent and each time that I have had a problem the manager has fixed it right away. The first time was for a to-go order - I had ordered a ribeye steak and when we brought it home it was heavily seasoned and tasted of pure salt. The manager offered to make a new one, refund us our money or leave us a gift card for what we spent. I opted to have a new one and the replacement steak was perfect. The second time was on a visit this past weekend. I wanted to try something new so I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos. As soon as I picked one up I noticed that it was cold, so I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be served that way (kind of like sushi or ceviche) but she said it wasn't and took it back right away. The manager stopped by our table and offered me a soup or salad while I waited for new tacos. I tried the wedge salad (excellent!) and then the shrimp tacos that came out were amazing!! The flavors were great and the shrimp were nice and warm. I would definitely order that again. Also, if you sign up for their free rewards program you collect points for every dollar you spend. Since my family eats here quite a bit, it's nice to be rewarded for our loyalty. There are different items that you can claim (free pizookie or $5 or $10 off your meal, but we always save up our points for the $25 off a meal - it's like getting a whole meal for free!). Thanks BJs!"
