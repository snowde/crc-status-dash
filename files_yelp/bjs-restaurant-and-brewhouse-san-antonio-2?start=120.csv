JayJay G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,,2.0,7/8/2014,"I would always pass by this restaurant but never really bothered to try it over the years. So I decided to have dinner last night considering that they're open late at night--which is something I love in a restaurant--and the presentation was great, the server was very beautiful and professional, the food looked great although I regret ordering what I ordered. It looked good but it tasted a bit dry. My friend's steak was extremely dry as well. I probably should've tried something simple like a turkey burger, but overall, the service is excellent, the food can be questioned. I would prefer walking next door to Olive Garden."
Carin S.,"San Antonio, TX",83,18,17,5.0,9/17/2015,"Love Bj's. Pizza, great beer, salad. I'd be hard pressed to find something I don't like on the menu. The puzuki is a must try!"
B S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,,4.0,7/7/2016,"Service was excellent. The atmosphere was very nice for date nate or family night. The restaurant looks clean. The pizza and Ceasar salad was the best I have had in many years. The ziti was good but not my favorite. It did not have enough marina sauce, and it was not thick at all. I also didn't like the leafy garnish on top. Again that is my preference. I will visit again to get more tasty pizza and strawberry lemonade!"
Rebecca C.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,38,74,4.0,9/7/2014,This place is soo good. Everything on the menu that I've had order and I've been here twice has been delicious. The first time I was here I Order tons of different appetizer. The second time i actually order a meal. It's delicious I won't even bother recommended anything just the WHOLE menu. Good place to have with a special someone or with a groups.
Roni R.,"San Antonio, TX",183,256,1458,4.0,10/29/2012,"Came in for lunch and I wanted something different. So went with their new flatbread Black and Bleu pizza which is grilled skirt steak with bleu cheese crumbles, onions, and Portobello mushrooms along with a side wedge salad. Talk about delicious my taste buds were in lunch time heaven.  This is a  must try if you're in the area."
Abe R.,"San Antonio, TX",86,9,,5.0,9/28/2015,"Mainly dine in on my birthday. Yeah BJ's is that good. I have tried the thin crust pizzas and it's amazing. Not much crust with a lot of meat, cheese and flavor. The Ahi Poke(Hawaiian ceviche) tastes great with all the fresh veggies and fresh fish. I also love the glazed chicken with vegetables. The chicken is juicy and pulls off softly. The BJ's original pizookie is a must have for desert. Service is rather quick. Don't have to ask me twice coming here. Indoor and outdoor seating available."
Tiffany C.,"Apollo Beach, FL",1,3,,1.0,10/9/2015,"I have been to this location about 4 times. Every single time we have gotten super slow, horrible service. The food was mediocre, the beer was warm. Went today for lunch, won't go back again. Took my waiter almost 10 minutes to bring me a tea refill. A burger and a baked potato and soup took more than half an hour to get to us.  Too many better choices in San Antonio.  Don't bother."
Derek G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,22,6,5.0,9/20/2015,Excellent place to have dinner with the family and have a couple of their famous in house beers. Definitely worth the cost and the food is amazing. Plus they are open really late on weekends. Don't forget to try the pizza.
Amanda B.,"Petersburg, VA",128,288,84,4.0,3/15/2014,"Service was absolutely outstanding.  I tried 3 different beers and was given samples of them all before I bought them.  Waitress had ideas for everything we wanted.  Food was served quick, hot and how we ordered, but I think my steak was a bit over-cooked, closer to medium then medium rare, but I'm very picky with my steaks so, I'm still giving them four stars.  I'll be back, at least for the beer."
Barney A.,"Henderson, NV",29,88,178,4.0,4/2/2015,"I typically don't review these types of restaurants unless there's something special about them. During my San Antonio trip I was looking for a family friendly place to have lunch. We were a large group (9 people) so BJ's fit the bill. I've been to BJ's in Las Vegas several times before so I knew what to expect. What separated this BJ's from the rest was the outstanding service. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the gentleman who served us but he was a star. Patient, understanding, personable, offered great suggestions, checked in frequently and even called my mother in law ""mom"" at one point, which put a huge smile on her face. I will update this review with his name, but for now I want to thank the anonymous waiter at BJ's who made our experience there truly special."
Tamara N.,"San Antonio, TX",107,116,188,3.0,10/30/2013,"We have been to this establishment a couple of times since moving to this side of town and have been satisfied. The staff is very friendly and eager to recommend items from the menu, to include the vast variety of beers. My husband and I went for an early dinner a few days ago and ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. It was so big, we took half of it home. It really is enough to feed four people. It includes Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls. The Spinach & Artichoke Dip was probably the best version that I have ever had. It was so good that it will probably be our default appetizer from now on. My husband really liked the Santa Fe Spring Rolls as well. The Avocado Egg Rolls are good and the dipping sauce is great but we had to add salt because they were very bland. We ordered the BJ's Favorite Pizza the first time we went and it was very very good. We had the BJ's Classic Combo this time and we did not enjoy it as much as we did the first one. I had a Caesar Salad on our first visit and it was very good as well. My husband tried the Pumpkin Ale and fell in love with it. I didn't care for the spices in my beer, it was weird to me.  The BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer is the best Root Beer. It is served in a frosted mug and is soooooooooooooo good. We can't wait to go back to try other menu items!"
Christine G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,1,5.0,6/1/2015,"Awesome experience... Marcus was our server. From greeting us, introducing himself, taking drink orders, appetizers and entrees, he was On Point!! Avocado rolls were delicious, summer ale Nutty Brunette was refreshing with lunch. Just an overall great experience..."
Chelsea M.,"Raleigh, NC",224,211,431,3.0,3/9/2014,"3.5 stars, really. I like BJs, and this location is pretty good. I've only ever sat at the bar or a table in that area (easier access to drink refills... ya know?), therefore I cannot speak for the service elsewhere. The food is consistent, and it's on the top of my ""chain restaurants that I'll eat at"" list. Their beer is also quite good, the IPA, blonde, and lightswitch lager are all pretty good beers. They have a decent variety on tap as well if you're not feeling like trying theirs. Magic Hat #9 is always my go-to. Mixed drinks are not too shabby, but I rarely dabble in those. I like their small plates ($2.95-$4.95) because they're not too much before your meal, but the apps are tasty, too...Thai shrimp lettuce wraps and avocado rolls are my favs. I get the pizza most often. I used to love their buffalo chicken pizza, thin crust or deep dish. This is the only place I've seen celery put on the pizza, and it's the perfect touch. New menu items recently, really enjoyed their brussel sprouts/kale salad with berries. Also, clam chowder is very good for being at a chain and nowhere near New England. Always good service at the bar. The bar area is good, too. I've never waited too long or had issues with food."
Chelsea O.,"San Antonio, TX",168,3,,5.0,8/26/2015,Great food and awesome service every time. Brandon was our favorite server we've had there.. Super nice guy and really on top of things! We love this place:)
Tanya C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,89,3.0,2/26/2016,BJs beer is always great! Service was very good. Had the Bison BBQ burger lunch portion the burger was too dry...def not going to order again. Asked for sautéed calamari which the Chef attempted but was blah!
Carl B.,"San Antonio, TX",857,36,12,3.0,1/24/2015,"We've given this place a lot of chances but it seems like it's just always inconsistent. Sometime the food is good other times it sucks, sometimes we get a decent server other times we get a confused flustered one, sometimes the atmosphere is chill other times it's noisy and hard to have a conversation. They do have a pretty decent draft beer selection and their menu is extensive but over all the most I can give them is 3 stars. There just aren't that many places to choose from on the far west side of town for casual/bar dining so we reluctantly go here more times than we would if we had a choice. One of my favorite appetizers is the avocado egg rolls but unfortunately this time they are way over done and taste awful, oh well maybe they'll get it right next time...."
Gretchen B.,"San Antonio, TX",1,3,,5.0,3/2/2016,We had a phenomenal waiter in the bar area and the food was ready very quickly! Another past server noticed us and took the time to say hi and see how we were. :-)
Angie M.,"San Antonio, TX",113,201,46,4.0,11/29/2013,"Good variety and food.  Nothing spectacular food-wise, but it's good, lots o' beer, and the staff is cool. Calamari is good.  Potato skins are stellar.  Flat breads are good, too. Overall, a good, close by place to go."
Glen O.,"Dellview, San Antonio, TX",20,22,1,4.0,10/31/2014,"I often forget to check in here, but we love going to this BJ's.  The drinks are always on point, and I don't just mean the beer.  I'll often splurge and order a hand-crafted martini.  Every one I've ordered from them has been on point.  The food is deliciously consistent.  Service is typically stellar, but I'd be lying if I said I'd not experienced an off night.  Be sure to try the pizza, the burgers/sandwiches (yay pulled pork!), and oh that Ahi Tuna Salad.  If I want to overload on my empty calories? The cookie thing is amazing."
Cameron L.,"San Antonio, TX",1,4,,2.0,3/5/2016,"Most of the time that we've been there the service has been OK in the food pricey but good. When my parents came in on Christmas Eve we decided to go there for dinner. My wife called ahead because there was going to be 9 people in our party. We only live about 5 minutes from the Alamo ranch location, told on the phone that if we got there in the next 15 minutes there would be no way. We arrived in less than 10 minutes in Word form by the hostess that would be an hour and a half wait. I told the young lady that we had called in just a minute ago to make reservations and were told that if we got there in 15 minutes we would be seated immediately. Is there told us over the phone that it would have been an hour and a half way it would have been one thing, but to get us to come in thinking that we are going to be seated right away and then tell us that is an hour and a half wait just to be seated I was not happy."
