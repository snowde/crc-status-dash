Sabine F.,"Cibolo, TX",89,428,1265,4.0,7/10/2011,"BJ's is a nice place to eat . The atmosphere  feels like a nice smokeless sports bar. I ate the Chicken Tuscany, which was okay. My husband and son ordered pizza and said that it tasted delicious. My son is a beer  connoisseur  and said that they had some of the best beers at BJ's."
Cynthia C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,2.0,2/25/2016,I went to BJs for lunch at 1130 today.  It took an hour to get my meal.  Some people in my party had to wait even longer.  The restaurant was not very busy so I can't imagine why the service was so slow.  With this establishment being clise enough for the military community to grace at lunch time it seems things should move in a faster pace.  The meal was adequate  but not worth the wait.
Joe G.,"San Antonio, TX",2,16,1,1.0,7/31/2014,"Cherry Glazed Salmon w/asparagus & couscous was tasteless, asparagus dried out and so was the glaze. Salmon was overpowering the sauce and the couscous. Maybe another dish will be better. This was my second time there, and if I go back it won't be soon."
Morgan A.,"San Antonio, TX",6,103,37,3.0,6/19/2013,"We ordered a large Mediterranean deep dish pizza to go from BJ's. placed the order on a Friday night and it was ready within 10 minutes. Service was quick and pleasant. The pizza was okay, nothing spectacular, and in my opinion overpriced. I prefer Kennedy's Chicago style instead, much better quality and worth the price. That said, I'm interested in giving their menu another try; some of the items look really delicious."
Greg T.,"San Antonio, TX",1,10,16,3.0,1/18/2015,"The food was delicious, and the server did a good job. But everything else under par.  We got there just before 5:30 PM on a Saturday night.  I gave the hostess my reward card number and waited for our party of 5 to be seated. Another party of 5 came in about 5 minutes after us. They requested a booth and 2 kid menus, I requested a table.  Somehow, our tickets got switched; they were seated before us as were about 5 other parties that arrived after us.  We were finally escorted to a booth, the host had 2 kid menus in hand. I informed the host that our tables had been switched and the other party was sitting at the table I reauested.  By this time, the resturant was packed so the manager at us at the bar, he pushed 3 small high tables to accomadate our party. Other than the 20 minute delay to finally be seated, the seating was fine.  We ordered a couple of beer samplers, and began to look at the menus.  The waitress accidently knocked over one of the small empty glasses and it shattered. Shards of glass went everywhere with majority of the broken glass landing in my friends lap. The server quickly cleaned up the area and apologized.  Accidents happen, and the waitress handled it like a pro.  When our food finally arrived, my daughter's dish was garnished with a wilted piece of lettuce that had began to turn to black.  My New Orleans Jambalaya was coated in cayenne pepper to the point that the dish was inedible.  You could smell the spice from 3 feet away. I sent the dish back and by the time the replacement dish arrived the rest of the party had already finished their meals. In the end the food was delicious and the server did a fine job, but overall the attention to detail was lacking. When I paid my bill I noticed that I was not credited with my reward points and I had to go back to the server to have them added.  This little error was a result of the other party being given my table in the beginning.  I noticed that tables seated around us had also sent dishes back.  It was a very crowded Saturday night and it seemed like the restaurant was simply understaffed.  Overall a good meal, just a bunch of little details that brought the experience down a couple of notches."
Jared B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,1,1.0,3/7/2015,"Do not go here for drinks. Even the waitress told us one of the mixed drinks we ordered was the worst drink she has ever tried, of course this was after we complained and asked her to take it back. Then ordered a Grey Goose and Tonic, received Absolute and Tonic. If you understand the difference, this place is not for you."
Mary Ann C.,"San Antonio, TX",1,13,4,4.0,1/14/2015,The food is good. The Customerservice is less than desirable . In the beginning it was great but the past few times I was less than satisfied . Their pazookie is amazing! The price is reasonable and the location is ok . Their menu reminds me of Cheese cake factory . l normally  order  chicken fried chicken with mash potato and corn . Very good.  Lol  My kids love the spaghetti and their macaroni and cheese. if you have their app its worth it Cause you collect point that can earn you a free pazookie or X amount of money off your ticket!
Chelsie M.,"San Antonio, TX",3,6,,5.0,4/6/2015,"After getting sick of typical chain restaurants like Chilis, Applebees, and the rest, BJ's has quickly become a favorite spot, and I'll never go back to the others. Really, nothing else similar holds a candle to BJ's. Every time I go in seating is fast, even during busy times. The wait staff is always nice and professional and the food is amazing; everything I've tried so far has been delicious. They have more adventurous fare and good ol' pizzas and burgers alike for any palette... and awesome drinks as well. Prices are fair and they have good specials too. Recently tried their take out service and it's the most organized thing ever... and I've had bad service with curbside in other restaurants. BJ's is worth the visit... don't waste your money elsewhere for casual dining."
Liz P.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",1,69,1,5.0,8/17/2013,"This place is great they have great tasting beer for those who like to drink. Lol they have girly beer for girls like me that don't really drink and good food. They deep dish pizza is really good. I had the buffalo chicken one minus the onion. I can honestlynot complain about it. Yes it takes them time to bring your food but what is there to expect when it's so busy. Their dessert is so yummy too fresh made cookie cake with vanilla ice cream couldn't ask for anything better. Great service, great food and great beer"
Char B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,44,5,4.0,10/18/2015,First time here tonight and we really enjoyed it! Waitress was nice and entire staff was attentive. Food was Awesome....my fav was the cookie dessert/icecream. Definitely will be back!
Rob C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,,4.0,12/20/2015,Great variety of food choices.  House brews are very good.  Excellent choice for a chain selection.
Charles B.,"Houston, TX",7,53,17,2.0,4/10/2012,"Hey BJ's, serving 4 out of 5 people passable food won't get you four out of five stars.  1.5 stars for you, but I'll round to 2. Our family and a friend had dinner at BJ's.  A medium pizza for two, a burger, a bread bowl soup, and pasta.  The first four were OK, but my daughter's pasta was unbelievably bad.  The flat fettuccine noodles were stuck together, sometimes as many as four thick.  It appears somebody dumped them in the pot to boil and never stirred. The waitress was very apologetic and got the manager.  He offered to remake the food, but said it would be awhile to make the pasta.  By the time he came over, the rest of us were almost through.  We explained we were trying to catch a movie and didn't have that kind of time to wait.  Rather than offering us something else, he simply said he would take the item off and left.  He was not very apologetic and not even too disturbed that half the pasta was stuck together and hard. (And, no, it wasn't possible to find the half good pasta among the hard and stuck together pieces.)  My daughter shared the remaining portions of the other entrees.  Yes, he took the item off, but he ruined everybody's experience. The thick crust pizza was very doughy also and sub-par.  Kennedy's Chicago Pizza a couple of miles away is way better."
Dolph M.,"San Antonio, TX",19,305,360,4.0,4/19/2010,"Brand new location! All our food was great, and the atmosphere is very cool. However, I think they roll the cost of the atmosphere into the menu prices. As good as everything was, I can't say there's much value to find at BJ's. However, the BBQ chicken pizza was particularly notable. Most BBQ pizzas tend to be soaking in sweet barbecue sauce overpowering any other flavors... BJ's manages to balance both traditional pizza flavors and BBQ flavors in such a way that it still tastes like a pizza, instead of an open-face barbecue sandwich. Excellent recipe!"
Whitni F.,"San Antonio, TX",2,24,19,4.0,9/15/2014,"I was very upset when they got rid of their delicious salmon plates, and didn't replace them with anything better. So lately I discovered that this place has some of the best pizza I've ever tried.  I love eating here, but sometimes the take out phone is super busy, so i end up having to place my to go order inside and waiting for them to cook it. The menu options are average, and i would compare this place to Cheesecake Factory but it has a slightly different ambience."
Ch C.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,14,,5.0,12/4/2015,"LOVE THIS PLACE! Every time we go in, we get the best drinks and beer and best food. We always try something new, but we have our favorites. We get the brussel sprout appetizers, love the flat bread pizza, love the avocado rolls. Service is great. Yay for BJs."
Heather J.,"San Antonio, TX",15,87,16,4.0,11/9/2012,"My husband and I had gone to BJ's by ourselves for lunch and dinner, all of which we enjoyed.  The portions are a respectable size and they have a wide range of options.  I don't tend to like huge menus, but a large part of theirs is due to pizza and burger options.   Our most recent experience was actually when we held a surprise party for my Grandmother's 80th birthday.  We had a dozen family members coming from all over and needed a place to surprise her.  Unfortunately, most places with private rooms charge way more than we had in our budget and require larger groups.   While the Alamo Ranch BJ's doesn't have a private room, they do have a back section that is partially partitioned and they could take our group of 12 people.  You just call ahead and ask to make a group reservation, with the only fee being the automatic 15% or so (it might be 17-8%, I can't remember sadly) gratuity added onto your bill.  Then all you have to do is show up at the time you reserved and everyone can order off of the regular menu - they even will let you split the check! Another benefit was that we were allowed to bring our own cake and ice cream, which our waiter brought out when we asked at the end of the meal.  Service was only slightly slower than when we had come as a couple, but this is not unexpected since a larger party simply takes longer to deal with.  All in all it was a wonderful meal and worked well for our family since we were only a mid sized group and preferred to split the check among ourselves.   If you need a casual place to take a larger group or just want to go for an individual meal, I would definitely recommend BJ's Brewhouse."
David W.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,84,116,3.0,9/15/2012,"Food was good. Service not so much.  Our entire order came out all at once.  Food tasted good.  Too bad it was cold from sitting there. ""Sorry about that"" was the best they could do. Would have been 5 stars."
Jd D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,8,,1.0,11/15/2015,"Boy, Bj's has gone to the birds!!!!!!! They use to have half price appetizers and 4 dollar call drinks for there happy hour and during NFL games. No more. Now its 2 dollars off appetizers and only $1 dollar off during happy hours. They are falling short and very expensive! We also noticed during there happy hour that they give smaller portions, so when you are suppose to save $2 dollars off of there $10 appetizers they give your smaller portions. so you don't really get a good deal at all!!!!!!!!!! Go to 54th street,,, they still have half price appetizers and good drink discounts!!!!!!!!!!!"
Cecily P.,"San Antonio, TX",160,199,125,3.0,5/23/2014,"Pretty ok. Nothing I had was particularly special (pizza, wings, artichoke dip) but everything was reasonably tasty and they were very accommodating when we came in fairly close to closing time. Nice drink selection and ok service. A good casual option in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."
Roberto L.,"San Antonio, TX",16,65,28,2.0,3/13/2012,"We went here to eat as a family. It was actually one of the first places we ate out when moving to San Antonio, so I was excited with it being a ""brewhouse"" and all! This review is weighted on the name having ""brewhouse"" in it, so while the food was OK, the other factors pull it down. Food (3 Stars) ------------------- I got a burger, can't really mess those up. In order to ensure that, I ordered an open face burger. It was pretty good. My wife ordered off the specials list and she was happy with her meal as well! I would give the burger and fries and meal an overall 3. Beer (2 Stars) -------------------- I ordered the American Ale. I don't know if the fault is on me, the restaurant or the server. The real answer might be ""yes"". When I read the description on the menu, I was expecting a nice darker ""Budweiser American Ale"" style beer to come out. When the light colored beer came out, I looked at my wife and said ""uh-oh"". It was an IPA, there is no other way to describe it. The menu should have read ""American Ale: It's an IPA.""  Service (2 Stars) ----------------------- This is where things kind of pulled the experience down for me. I sipped the beer and then it sat there for the rest of the meal (I hate IPAs). The waitress finally asked about the beer and I told her I thought it was more of an IPA and that the menu didn't really describe it right. She said ""yeah. that's true, I mean it is more like an IPA"". She then walked away.  Overall, we have eaten around this place a few times, but never gone back. I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it hard, but it made it really hard. I have experienced better and would rather try different places."
