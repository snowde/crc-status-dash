Ricardo R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/1/2015,"My girlfriend and I had ordered ravioli and a burger to go on Friday 9/18 from here. She had ordered her burger well done, but when we got home and she bit into the burger one could see that the meat was really pink not even fully cooked. She was disgusted and poked through all of the meat to discover that the center hadn't even been cooked while surrounding meat was pink as if she had order a rare burger. My girlfriend called them right away and asked for a manager. The manager spoke to her and said she would refund the cost of the burger to which 2 weeks have past and it still hasn't happened."
Amanda B.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,96,25,1.0,9/28/2011,"BJ's is so great. Unfortunately this is the WORST location in San Antonio: 100% due to the manager. I believe he was the assistant or day manager, or some other title for a little boy wearing big boy shoes he found for a minute. The wait staff and food was amazing. I will update as soon as I find the card with names I wrote down. Long story short: Was with a large group for a birthday. Was kicked out (twice) by this tool because he ""needed the tables for another reservation."" To my knowledge, BJ's doesn't take reservations? We had a large group of professional adults, including a few medical doctors (just a point for ability to take on large bill.) We complained to the server, acknowledging it was obviously not their fault. Douchebag's supervisor came out apologized said there is no way it is acceptable.  D-bag came back out, said supervisor talker to him and he ""guessed"" he could have handled it better... Cute apology. We did not want anything for free because that was not the point of the complaint, we made that known. Everyone but the tool trying to prove himself got that. The ""reservation"" showed up, smaller than our group, bunch of trash bags, 50% kids... After a good laugh we ventured to another location and continued to spend a few more hundred dollars. Food and service is always great, but this manager is a clown. Once I find my note I will edit my review...  Upside: Apparently this is this only BJ's in the country that takes reservations for six losers wearing clearanced Ed Hardy and six toddlers, because that is how a restaurant makes money. Call your friends and tell them they can bring that adorably chubby happy hour mistake of theirs!"
EDWARD G.,"San Antonio, TX",42,16,5,4.0,7/30/2010,"Nice place with a contemporary sports bar kind of vibe and a ""Ginormous"" TV screen behind the bar. I can't really ""rave"" about the food because its just a standard mix I describe as ""upscale bar & grill"" kind of food that you would find at similar corporate themed restaurants. I mean the food is good overall. Nothing to rave about. But they do have a great beer selection.  I like BJs for Happy Hour because they have good discounts on drinks & appetizers at the bar and there is usually an interesting mix of people. They also a ""reverse happy hour"" for later at night. And they serve Boddingtons on tap, which makes me very happy.  The bar staff is very professional and personable. They seem to recognize & greet regular customers and they always make me feel welcome. They are also very attentive to service no matter how busy it gets and they will usually engage in some good bar banter. This kind of personable service seems to be working in developing lots of regular bar customers there and I like that. The service and staff and management are excellent. One time for lunch, I had a minor concern with my food and the manager was all over it to correct the issue and to ensure everything was taken care of. (That kind of ""hands on"" service oriented management style adds an extra star to my rating of this place.) While the food is pretty good overall, the pizzas are excellent. They have good deep dish Chicago style pizzas, and also little mini pizzas like at CPK. But the nachos, however, are horrible. I mean horrible. They serve them like a big mound of chips on a big plate with a little bit of cheese and toppings. But just below that top layer is nothing but a mound of dry chips with some bland chili on the plate. Not good at all. I like BJs overall. Its a good neighborhood bar kind of place with a contemporary vibe, good food, a great beer selection, and great service and staff."
Dee R.,"San Antonio, TX",52,77,137,1.0,11/25/2013,"Boohoo, this place was disappointing the silverware was dirty, our food was sloppy, and our server Jenny was so inattentive. Won't be coming back here.."
Madison L.,"Warrenton, VA",1,49,31,1.0,9/10/2013,"I normally love this place, I've eaten here a bunch of times, however, today I came in for lunch ordered the large BBQ chicken chopped salad, minus the chicken, corn & cheese, (I'm vegetarian). So basically it was just lettuce, tomatoes & black beans.  Did I say black beans, oh yeah, I could of fooled myself cause there was exactly 5 black beans in my salad.  So I politely ask our server for extra black beans, she came back with 12 black beans,  are we having a shortage on black beans?? I'm just saying, considering that I decide to eliminate the chicken, corn & cheese, you think that they would politely add extra beans without my even having to ask. Oh yeah, and did I mention all this for $14.00. WHAT, $14.00 for iceberg lettuce couple of mini chopped tomatoes, and well, I already mentioned the bean, or lack there of. Very disappointing, BAD B.J."
Shane W.,"San Antonio, TX",57,11,1,3.0,5/18/2012,"Really dig their root beers and creme sodas. They've got an extensive list of personal brews that they're quite proud of. The drinks list is close to 30 pages. So, for the beer snob in your life they'll feel at home. Good food as well, wide selection, just nothing to Yelp about."
Mary L.,"VA, VA",55,297,2,3.0,6/3/2011,"Blah! I really wanted to give this place a good review since so many of you loved it, but I really wasn't a fan. I came here with my bf for dinner one day and was incredibly indecisive as far as what to get. I ended up being convinced to get a stuffed potato and it was honestly the worst potoato I've ever had. It was lacking flavor! The chicken wasn't seasoned, the broccoli was steamed and it just was horrible. I was livid after my first bite. Our waitress swore up and down that it was good and I believed her. Too bad. My boyfriend got a pot roast sandwich and said it was amazing and as we looked around, a lot of the other stuff people ordered looked good too! I think I may have just picked a bad menu item, but it really left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). I am really reluctant to go back now just because of how bad that meal was.  The service was pretty good. It took awhile for our food to come out, but it was crowded so it was expected. I guess if you go, whatever you do, DO NOT get the stuffed baked potato because it's the WORST! If you want a good stuffed baked potato, go to Spud Ranch! You'll be a lot happier and it won't cost as much!"
Texas001 M.,"Spring Branch, TX",7,49,,2.0,5/20/2014,I had a 1/2 rack of ribs and steamed broccoli and my wife had a personal pizza.  My ribs were dry (they were not baby back ribs)  and the broccoli was cold. She said her pizza was good but not Pizza Hut good.  All in all I could not give more than 2 stars.
Rod E.,"San Antonio, TX",3,7,1,1.0,7/1/2014,Food was good but service was terrible. Waited at least 20 min to see waiter after we ate. I asked to see the manager she came right over. I told her that I had not seen our waiter for at least 20 minutes and we needed togo boxes. She came right back and put them down. I thought they put the food in there for you oh well. The food was good though.
Ash M.,"San Antonio, TX",168,342,469,4.0,11/21/2011,"I've been to BJ's a handful of times since it opened and it's been mostly good.  One time my husband and I (after a few drinks) realized it had been an hour since we placed our order and as soon as the manager saw we were looking pissed he came by and apologized, citing a hold up in the kitchen.  He comp'd us another round of whatever drink we would like (their mojitos are delicious!) as well as dessert.   Their bar area is (at the risk of sounding like an alcoholic) beautiful!  However, whenever we get a table at the bar, the service tends to go down a notch.  I think it's where they start off the new kids.  Aside from that, their brews are amazing!  The lightswitch lager and harvest hefeweizen are my personal favorite.  It does get ridiculously crowded around 7 - 9 but afterwards it mellows out and is a great alternative to the neighboring Buffalo Wild Wings if you don't feel like spending too much money, getting drinks spilled on you and/or getting stabbed."
Adam B.,"San Antonio, TX",65,193,222,3.0,4/18/2011,"Heard a lot of good things about BJ's, but mostly about their beer. The only comment about the food I would get from people was how the menu takes a while to go through. Well, they weren't lying. The menu is huge. There were so many items to choose from that I found myself having to shoo the waiter not once, but twice. We ended up starting off with the Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer. The tuna was fleshy in a very good way and had a gingery, but flavorful taste. The wasabi gave it that punch that you would expect to add to a good piece of raw fish. For our meal, we went off of a suggestion from our waiter. We got the California pizza. Made with chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. This pizza was delicious. The crust was really nicely done. This was a winner. The other dish we ate was the Cuban burger. It is a half-pound burger served sandwich-style, topped with oven-roasted ham, Swiss cheese, crispy dill pickles, Dijonnaise and mustard. This burger was very good, but mine came a little overcooked. There was some char on half of the patty that I normally will deal with, but the burnt taste took away from the burger. The other half was fine and I enjoyed every last bite of it. BJ's is a great place to take groups of people to eat because I have no doubt that they have something on the menu for all types of taste buds. I gave it 3 stars for the burnt half of a patty, but I will be sure to try it again and update my rating if it changes."
Jason R.,"San Antonio, TX",23,5,2,4.0,1/26/2014,"Avocado egg rolls and pizza are the shizzle, especially when half off. I tend to visit quite a bit and sit at the bar and find their customer service and food are pretty top notch."
Sheryl G.,"San Francisco, CA",184,350,935,4.0,9/20/2011,Love their lunch special unlimited soup & salad. Fave is the tomato bisque with the capese salad. If I want something light go for their mini bites menu: usually get their barbacoa steak tacos followed with the bruchetta. Finish with a small pazookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Last time I went there they had a red velvet one with white chocolate chips and it was heaven on a spoon.
Andrea B.,"San Antonio, TX",37,35,12,4.0,1/15/2013,I'm a fan! Staff is great and the specials they have in the bar area are incredible!! Happy hour during the football games got me hooked!! LOVE IT!!
Yvonne C.,"San Antonio, TX",5,10,1,1.0,11/22/2013,"Sub par at best.  Stinky carpets. Long ass wait.. crappy margaritas... and hello, who the F puts cumino in tartar sauce!!?!!?"
Natalie R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,9,3.0,10/26/2013,"Sigh.. Idk..  First time here was good, their grilled chicken sandwich is really good.. The ahi tuna appetizer was fresh and delicious.. This time meh.. Service started off good then went down.  My chicken fried steak was bland, Caesar salad was all iceberg lettuce and too much dressing.  My boyfriend had the pot roast sandwich which tasted amazing!!! His tortilla soup was soo delish and I love the way they serve it!! Pizookie was good too! Overall my meal sucked and his was on point lol."
Iris R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,1.0,3/19/2015,"This place is disgusting!  Food was cold, staff was rude, and took long to refill my drink. Won't be going there again."
Cindy A.,"San Antonio, TX",4,11,12,5.0,1/15/2013,"Love this place! Went for the first time this past weekend with my honey to watch some NFL. Their beer pints were a bit pricey, but they do have an amazing food menu. So many items to choose from. We ended up ordering the new beginnings appetizer plate which runs around $16. Luckily they had happy hour during NFL games so all appetizers were half off. Score.. lol but, I wouldn't mind paying full price. It was definitely worth it; filling and tasty. We couldn't even finish it. Our server was also awesome and on top of everything. Great job. I will definitely be going back to BJs. I loved it."
Erica V.,"San Antonio, TX",6,21,,2.0,6/17/2010,"I know I have been accused of being a restaurant snob and now I may have to agree.  This was a terrible experience. I don't know if our waitress had short term memory or what her problem was, but she introduced herself to us about four times and couldn't remember what we were drinking. Pepsi is difficult to remember when your in a bar-type restaurant I know.  The restaurant was not crowded as we went during the week and it was later in the evening. We were still not ""allowed"" to sit in a bigger booth (the 4 person size) because we were a party of 2. However after seating us, they sat two parties of 2 in the bigger booths. Hmmm  Ordered chips and salsa to start...salsa was wonderful, chips, I would have rather brought my own. To thick and almost stale tasting. I ordered a burger on sourdough with the wedge-cut fries. The other person ordered a chicken sandwich of some sort with the thin-cut fries. Our food was first brought to another table, then finally brought to us. The fries were nicely warm, not hot, but somewhat acceptable. The bread on my burger was not sourdough, but the garlic bread option. The bread tasted okay, but I was not in the mood for garlic bread, hence ordering the sourdough. The bread quickly became very soggy with all the 1000 Island Dressing they seem to own stock in since it is listed on the menu for almost everything. The burger meat itself was good. It had a nice texture and smelled great. It could have used seasoning, even just salt and pepper would have been good.  The chicken sandwich which appeared to not really be identifiable was okay. The thin-cut fries were the best thing in the entire meal. Pretty sad.  Our waitress seemed to only want to wait on the man at the table and never looked me in the eyes or even in my direction. She continually brought refills to the other person, but I had to wait until my glass was empty.  Atmosphere was okay, not to loud or to bright. I WILL NOT go back for food, including getting take out. I may (if I have a moment of weakness) go back to try the dessert.  Sadly, I would have preferred to waste my time eating a McDonald's Double Quarter pounder, large fries, and large Coke at home while watching TV instead of eating out. This is why I do not eat restaurants that I feel are on the same level as Chili's. I will take home from those restaurants, but I refuse to waste my valuable relaxing time having to fight with waitresses or deal with bad food."
Bradford H.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,14,1,5.0,1/19/2013,"I think this place is 5 stars. Honestly, both take out & dine in service past the test. Good service. & even though this is a chain, it's one of the only in my top places I like to go when I'm in San Antonio. Great beer selection as well. Cheers."
