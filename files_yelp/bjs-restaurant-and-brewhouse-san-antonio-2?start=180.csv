Adam G.,"San Antonio, TX",250,259,349,2.0,5/5/2010,"Oh BJ's why hast thou forsaken me?  As my colleagues and I happened upon the new BJ's for an after work let's get the weekend started affair, we needed a table for 12 to accommodate us in our frivolity. While waiting we took advantage of the discounts afforded those who arrive after 9 for the reverse happy hour which include $1 off drafts, $2 off apps and half off mini pizzas.  Those specials do not, however, transfer into the main dining room once you are seated.  What!?!  Your name is BJ's Brewhouse! You have the name brewhouse in your title. You make your own beer. You celebrate the artisanal craftsmanship necessary to create and deliver such a fine hand crafted beverage with murals lining the walls depicting the harvest. In other words:  ""There is no place where beer ends and food begins.""  You are a bar!  Freetail does not exclude it's patrons seated near the exit door from the nights specials nor does Blue Star nor Flying Saucer. BJ's how can you justify such behavior?  Well apparently the misconception that they are a bar is readily amended when anything other than those items drawn from a tap are requested. All night I saw the most disgusting variations of such simple things as a Mojito, an Amaretto sour, or a Margarita. At one point some members of our table ordered a shooter unfamiliar to the bartenders who replaced it with a recommendation of something that resembled a glass of orange Tang.  What the hell behind the bar can you put in a drink that makes it orange?  Judging from the puckered up faces of the participants it did not, unfortunately, taste as good as a glass of Tang.  BJ's I am so excited that you have finally opened your doors and I can safely say that I love your house-brewed porter but I think there is much work to be done yet."
Luis R.,"Cheyenne, WY",11,115,4,4.0,7/16/2010,"I always wait for the crowds to settle before visiting a new place. Did the same for BJ's, and also avoided rush hour. Started the meal with a Tatonka brew...very delicious! Had 2 more beers from the menu and they were excellent. I ordered a Deep Dish pizza, and to my surprise, it was almost like being in Chicago. This is the only pizza in town that can call themselves Chicago Style Pizza...but they don't. I have lived in S.A. for 8 years and have tried every Chicago wannabe pizza place, but they are all very disappointing.  Also, the crowd seem to be well behaved, and not silly childish like BWW.  4 stars granted if you stick with pizza and beer only. If you try the other dishes, then it goes down to a 3 star review."
Crystal G.,"San Antonio, TX",21,43,,4.0,6/26/2010,"My experience was the opposite of the other reviewers. Our server put my kids' orders in first, so they didn't have to wait long for their food. When I told him I didn't care for my ""taste of"" beer, he brought me a free sample (3 oz. or so) of another one. He was EXTREMELY attentive, but not to the point of being annoying. I ordered the calzone, and it was perfect. The crust was crisp and flaky, and the marinara was flawless. I only give it four stars because it was a bit overpriced. I paid $2.55 for an iced tea, and only $1.95 for a ""taste of"" (5 oz.) beer. That's just crazy."
Raymond P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,75,4,5.0,8/13/2010,"This place is the best. Yesterday evening I went for the second time. So far, I've only got around to tasting their hamburgers, but I can't get enough! It's too delicious. The first time around I went with the family and so we did a little taste-testing with each others food. There was nothing bad on the table. Pizza. Macaroni & Cheese. California Burger. Cuban Burger. Thai Wraps. All of it was divine. No regrets on any of our orders. This second time around I ordered a Classic Bacon Cheeseburger with Seasoned Fries. Couldn't have asked for anything better.  While the food was good, however, the service wasn't at it's top performance. It was busy, but I think it always is. On top of that, our group had phoned in before we got there, but apparently something happened because we had to remake the reservations when we arrived. Not cool, but the food made me forget about it all. I think I'm still full...  Oh and their root beer is delicious. My favorite of all their non-alcoholic drinks."
Joe M.,"Gilbert, AZ",21,53,2,5.0,3/13/2013,A menu that can satisfy just about anything you crave! Friendly and attentive servers and a great drink menu!
Angela E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,21,4,2.0,7/23/2012,"Bad experience tonight. (Alamo Ranch location )  Today is my stepdaughters 13th bday, she chose BJ's to have dinner at (on a Monday night.)  So I call around 2pm, to ask if we can make reservations for 6pm for a party of 11.  I was told by Mercedes that, no, I shouldve called 24 hours in advance and they wont take my reservation.  I asked really, you cant take the reservation now for a Monday evening? and she replies - nope.  I then told her, I guess I should just go to another restaurant, to which she replies, ok, thank you , goodbye.  RUDE.  I normally would have just gone to another place, however my stepdaughter really wanted to eat here.  So with that said, I called back and spoke to a manager - Mike, who apologized for the previous girls behavior and said they would love to have us if we are still willing to come.  So our reservation was made. 6pm comes,.. our party of 11 is seated.  Our waitress is Breanna.  In taking our orders, Breanna is a tad bit condescending and rude and not very personable.  My father asks if both the wedge fries and skinny fries are seasonsed and she says - No, just the wedges, in a tone which reeks of speaking to a 5 year old.  Then my 4 yr old son order burgers & applesauce, hes the only one who didnt get his meal when the entire rest of the table got theirs.  I asked her where his food was, she stated she would check on it and let me know.  She then proceeds to take another tables order, log it in the system (5 minutes has passed) and then I had to go up to her to ask her again.  Again, she states she will check on it and let me know.  She then comes back (everyone else is 3/4 of the way done with their meal, and my husband is feeding our son his burger) and says the kitchen dropped it on the floor on  the way out and they are having to recook them.  Which I think is a load of crap.  I think they forgot the order to begin with and were trying to buy time. Needless to say, we should have chosen another place for her birthday.  Poor service from start to finish.  Waste of our money for the food and service we got.   Eat somewhere else, you'll be happier you did."
Paula R.,"Weeki Wachee, FL",162,22,17,5.0,12/10/2010,"Went to BJ's for the first time tonight. It was a bit chilly, but we sat outside to reduce our wait time (it was a last minute restaurant choice). It wasn't so bad though. Kind of enjoyed sitting by the heaters - especially since it's the holiday season.  Our server was great - personable, attentive, although a little forgetful, but still overall pleasant.  Food choice was overwhelming, but that's a good thing. I went for the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was a great choice. Nice light flavor. Mashed potatoes had great flavor. Broccoli was cooked just right.  Nice night out with friends. I would definitely go there again!"
M N.,"San Antonio, TX",0,27,5,3.0,5/15/2012,"Food is ok, nothing special. I ordered a calzone and was unimpressed, to say the least. Tomato soup was great, wish I'd stuck with that and not wasted $ on the calzone. Wait staff was good. Had a stranger (waiting customer) approach our table to try and guilt/bully us to hurry up and leave because they were waiting on the table. We hadn't even ordered yet!  If you are with a large party and you need a variety of food options, or if drinking takes priority over eating, this may be the place to go. If you want great food, go somewhere else."
Erika B.,"San Antonio, TX",30,144,25,4.0,10/10/2010,To me this is a great place to just hang out and relax.  Their porter is fantastic and one of my favorite beers.  Although service is typically excellent I will have to say on occasion they are not the fastest and I have seen the same wrong pizza delivered to a table 4 times where it became a game to us and the couple at the table.  But honestly the service is pretty good and the waitstaff even when not at the top of their game have always been professional and very nice. During peak hours I would definately call ahead and get a reservation as I have seen people wait for an hour for a table. I have had a few sandwiches but I typically eat the pizza.  I'm not a deep dish fan so I ask for it to be on a flat bread - yummy and not so much bread.  They also have a great spinach and artichoke dip - you can really taste the parmasean.  I had for the first time one of their salads - the itailian - and it was delish and huge.
Clayton A.,"Live Oak, TX",111,10,16,4.0,2/15/2012,Spinach artichoke pizza is a must! I love that they have such a wide variety of food in their huge menu. They also have a gluten-free menu.
Jason P.,"San Antonio, TX",3,11,1,4.0,2/8/2011,"Actually was pleasantly surprised on both of my visits here.  I expected the beer to be good, and the food formulaic given the large chain of BJ's popping up all around San Antonio.  I was wrong.  The meatloaf sandwich was quite impressive (and that's saying a lot, 'cause my mom spoiled me growing up with incredible meatloaf), and the garlic mashed potatoes were the only ones I've ever had that weren't overwhelmed with garlic. My wife enjoyed her salad. The other occasion I had the poke bowl, and was again pleased.  The sushi grade tuna was incredibly fresh (akin to my Florida experiences), and well seasoned. Beer is good, especially the red.  Large, impersonal restaurant, good service.  Probable great for large gatherings."
Jen T.,"Monterey, CA",46,21,,3.0,8/30/2012,"Good beer selection. Food is fine for a chain. Service is spotty. I'd go back, but I didn't love it."
James G.,"San Antonio, TX",3,16,4,2.0,11/24/2012,Parmesan Crusted Chicken was good.  Steaks were decent not the best we have had but not bad.  Biggest complaint 4 out of the 6 silverware sets were crusted and dirty so we had them replaced.  Probably won't go back here again.
Dom D.,"Dayton, OH",18,22,3,4.0,12/28/2011,"This place is really nice, great beer we tried the berry cider beer it was great. They have really nice specials during happy hours and late nights check their website, the pizza is fluffly & buttery it was ok. But it had flavor. Went there for lunch also, and it was even better. Great place to dine for a good price. They also have really good appetizers that are delicious ;-)."
S B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,26,8,4.0,7/16/2014,"Fun casual environment. Great for groups from work, families, or date night. Brother's favorite dish is the jambalaya, but they also have great burgers and great fish. Wide range of choices on the menu for any foodie. Full bar and good beer."
aaron h.,"San Antonio, TX",36,96,3,3.0,9/27/2011,"I am by no means a connoisseur, but the brown ale is about as good as I have ever had.  It's a chain, so the food is good but lacks imagination.  I don't know if the beer is brewed on site or if it is shipped in.    I have been a couple of times and will likely go back.  Its worth a visit if you are in that part of town."
Tiffany G.,"Mico, TX",5,6,4,4.0,5/21/2012,Fish & chips were decent - just ask for desired crust thickness - mine was on thin side.  A good beer battered fish should be perfection in terms of crunch.  Have with a dark REAL beer people - they are known for their impeccable selection.
Eric C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",14,7,3,5.0,6/19/2012,"Greats selection of beers on draft, great food, great atmosphere. Stopped in and fell inlove instantly. Me and some friends ended up staying several hours watching the large flat screen tvs at the bar and trying out some of the microbrews they offer. The avocado egg rolls are delicious. Wish we had one of these in Corpus."
Bob B.,"San Antonio, TX",26,6,,2.0,1/14/2011,This location has been repeatedly disappointing. My wife and I had attributed the poor service and cold food to this being a new location and 'working the kinks out'. It's been a while and there's been no improvement. No thanks to a return trip.
Jack F.,"Mico, TX",4,4,,3.0,1/31/2012,Food and beer is good but staff is not friendly. Not a place to sit and drink a beer. Just not welcoming.
