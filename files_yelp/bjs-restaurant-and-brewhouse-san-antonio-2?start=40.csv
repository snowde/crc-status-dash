Kayla M.,"San Antonio, TX",61,40,1,2.0,3/25/2017,"I normally LOVE BJ's Brewhouse!  Today we were seated by the hostess then ignored for 15 minutes!!!  No one stopped to take a drink order or acknowledge our presence at all.  So finally we got up to leave (no one attempted to stop us or even noticed), on the way out I paused at the hostess stand to tell her ""Thank you for seating us but we are leaving.""  I expressed to her that we waited for 15 minutes without acknowledgement and that I was unhappy.  Her response was ""Ok.""  Just, 'ok' ..."
Tim M.,"San Antonio, TX",153,119,126,1.0,7/21/2016,The place is full of dirty tables.  Lots and lots of dirty tables.  They said it would be 15 minutes before they can seat us.  Meanwhile 5 employees are congregated at the hostess stand doing nothing.  We just came for dessert...pizookie.  We didn't even get dessert.  We are regulars here and have never been so disappointed it what we call a dependable and consistent restaurant.  Letdown is an understatement.  Management might have some play in all of this.  It will be some time before we return.  The potato skins were also not very good.  Oreos...we'll have Oreos
Darcel B.,"San Antonio, TX",89,34,23,3.0,6/15/2017,We have never experienced great or even good service at this location. There is always something wrong with our order. Compared to other locations this one disappoints.
Anna R.,"San Antonio, TX",109,99,1209,2.0,12/26/2014,"After our ""after"" Christmas shopping we stopped at our neighborhood BJ's. BJ's you let me down and I fell hard! I always bragged about your consistency in food flavor, presentation and price. My husband and I ordered the fish/shrimp taco plate; we asked for no onion. Tortilla's were cold and hard and flavorless and my shrimp taco had onions in the taco. As faithful patrons I was extremely dissatisfied with my food! My step daughter ordered the lasagna and said it was just ok and that she would not order this again. From a 1-5; 5 being the best, she gave your dish a 3. Ravioli was not seasoned in her opinion and there was too much ricotta in the dish that was clumped together. We will give you another try and hope they our dining experience will improve ~"
José G.,"Puyallup, WA",57,19,3,5.0,4/10/2017,The BBQ Brisket burger was insanely good and the home brews are fantastic. I am constantly let down with the beer selections in San Antonio but this place is here to pick up the slack. I would recommend the Hefeweizen to anyone tired of drinking the same mass produced American alcohol available all over town. Our waitress was on point too. I'll be back next weekend for that BBQ pork sandwich.
Megan Z.,"San Antonio, TX",49,9,5,2.0,8/4/2016,"My fiancé and I went there last night for dinner. The wait time for our food to come out was about an hour. We ordered the seafood and chicken tacos. The waitress, Sydney, was nice enough. She apologized about 5 times for the wait.. Meanwhile, the people (also a table of 2) who were sat after us ordered, received their food and left the restaurant before our order even came out. The waitress's excuse was ""I put your order in, we have had so many complaints from everyone tonight!""... Bravo, great response. This was my first time at this location and  needless to say (I feel the need to say it anyway) it wasn't a very pleasant experience. I didn't see a manager walking around to greet tables or handle the ""so many complaints"" as I was told. To top it off, I tried using their nifty app to pay my 50 dollar tab, it was advertised that you get 20% off for using the mobile pay option.. It didn't apply the discount so we had to wait even longer for the ""manager"" to approve the discount.. When we were finally able to leave, the waitress kindly handed me a coupon for a free desert (with purchase of entrée of course) which was expired.. Thanks a lot! We don't go out very often so it's very disappointing to have a such bad experience. On another note, the food was great (hence why I gave 2 stars instead of 1). Just wish the manager and staff knew a little something about customer service.. Rant over, hope no one else has the same experience.  I would also like to note, I recognize that $50.00 isn't a lot of money, I would hope that this isn't the reason we were put on the back burner. I have previously worked in the restaurant business (though it was years ago) and I understand that things happen, a lot. We did not throw a fit of any sort. I have been in the customer service industry, different field, which is why I am writing such a review. I always appreciate any feedback I receive, as I cannot be everywhere at once, so I may correct the issue. My hopes are that you will do the same."
Jackie W.,"College Station, TX",174,1,,5.0,5/22/2017,Favorite place to watch the Spurs!  Great rewards program - points add up and you get free items. Customer service is never bad. Their menu is like 30 pages long and it's legit. Mediterranean pita tacos are so good. Do not leave without getting a pazookie - they are everything!
Karin T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,10,5.0,9/3/2017,It's always good here. The hostess and servers are friendly and polite and the food is good
J Wade H.,"Tahoka, TX",3,90,14,2.0,7/17/2016,"Nothing special at BJ's tonight. It gets 2 stars instead of 3 because of the plating. It looked like the back of the house just threw the food on the plate (picture posted.) Food was decent, but the visuals went a long way."
Rumaldo D.,"San Antonio, TX",60,119,55,4.0,7/25/2016,"Although I'm not a fan of chains, this one does it right.  They have a large menu with lots of variety to choose from, all of it well executed in a fun and comfortable atmosphere with an excellent bar menu as well.  Great date place, definitely more upscale that Fridays or Chili's.  Great place to linger over drinks after a movie.  Servers are always very personable and attentive."
Jesse S.,"San Antonio, TX",10,30,3,5.0,3/24/2017,"Awesome new menu items, The Prime Rib and Double Pork Chop are awesome deals. Always vibrant and fun environment. Cheery and quick servers. Great dining experience and worth the wait."
Linda S.,"Sparks, NV",28,35,18,2.0,5/5/2017,"I'm just not a fan of the food, Tried 4 times when meeting with other couples for dinner. For sports watching great lots of huge screens, Service was never a issue at all,"
Jelena w.,"San Antonio, TX",157,61,474,4.0,2/8/2017,Always good food. I love the ahi tuna. Alot of selection in the menu. Takes me sometimes to figure out what I'm eating.
Monie H.,"Fort Worth, TX",240,361,514,2.0,11/30/2014,"Definitely get the beer, cocktails, fish tacos, and burgers.   The wait staff at this Brewhouse is awesome!  They are so welcoming and attentive - they are definitely a huge part of the nice, relaxing atmosphere here. Unfortunately, My hubby and I tried the pizza and mahi mahi entree tonight, and we were disappointed.  This is a beer, cocktails, fish taco, & burger spot.  We should not have ventured off what we knew was good here, but we got curious........the kitty died."
Tam T.,"San Francisco, CA",4,11,,5.0,2/4/2017,Love this place!!!!!! The menu is great for people who don't know what they want to eat. A little bit of everything! The peach margaritas are amazing!
Patrick G.,"San Antonio, TX",107,801,35,3.0,7/25/2015,"I'm going to steal another line from Jerry Seinfeld and mention that no member of the wait staff should shake your hand when you sit down at their table.  Anyone who is handling food shouldn't be touching patrons as they enter for a meal. The restaurant itself is exactly what one would expect at a casual chain brew pub.  The dining area is massive and the bar seemed even bigger.  Good thing they had ample parking to fit all of the patrons that can eat at this location.  This was a good thing because the place was packed during my most recent trip here. There were a few items labeled ""new"" on the menu and I went with the bacon guacamole deluxe burger ($11).  It was an extremely large amount of food for such a low price.  The bun was probably the best part of the burger as it was buttery and grilled so it had crispy edges.  The guacamole really overpowered the burger because there was more guacamole than any other ingredient.  I did like the jalapenos used to spice it up though.  Diners also get the option of thin cut fries or potato wedges with seasoning.  They both sounded good and the thin cut fries were good enough. The wait staff seemed really busy and managed to forget about our table a lot.  We ended up sitting after our meal for about 30 minutes when the bill was dropped off.  I understand they were busy, but I watched a lot of them not being able to multitask.  They would get distracted and walk right by a lot of the times. Overall, this place is a good casual option for a cheaper bite to eat.  I want to try the beer as it sounds very good but it was a little pricey.  I will definitely go back but this place won't be anything I get excited for."
Jenny P.,"Waukee, IA",5,5,,5.0,7/18/2016,"Delicious! I was in town for work and looking for a place for dinner and this more than hit the spot. I had the chicken club sandwich - with bacon and avocado on sourdough toast with a side house salad and it was fantastic. Very fresh and delicious. I also tried the Nitwit seasonal brew and it was perfect for summer, light and fresh.  For dessert I had to try a mini salted caramel pizookie and it was delicious. The cookie was still warm and the caramel and chocolate chips were a  perfect combination. The mini size was good for one or it would also be enough for two to share. The service was great, friendly and timely. I would definitely come back, if not just to try more pizookies and beer. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"
Kate P.,"San Francisco, CA",46,6,,5.0,3/5/2017,I'm a huge fan of spice. Two of my favorite items that won't disappoint are the buffalo chicken pizza & the Siracha brussel sprouts. It's like a fiesta of flavor in your mouth. The management was friendly and the place is clean too! Tip: don't get the celery on the pizza...just my personal choice. We'll be back for sure!
James S.,"San Antonio, TX",364,109,180,5.0,6/18/2015,"Maybe I'm biased, but this BJ's has a great waitstaff lineup. Every visit (and I visit often) kicks off well because of prompt, energetic & friendly service. During peak hours, however, expect to wait no less than 30 minutes to first be seated. I've yet to experience one bad or disappointing beer/wine at BJ's, and on that note their drink selection is very large. Of equal size is their menu... an abundance to choose from... something for everyone's taste. And trust me when I say: NONE of their food offerings are weak! Moreover, portion sizes are more than satisfactory and prices far more than justified! BJ's atmosphere is casually upscale, lack of seating choices never an issue. Televisions are plenty and the crowd usually lively. Ultimately, whether for an intimate date or a daily bar hang or that dinner party of 12, this place is versatile enough to fit the bill without qualm. Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... Overall recommendation = 5; Food taste and quality = 5; Portion size = 4.5; Price = 4; Restaurant atmosphere = 5; General service = 5; Waitstaff amiability = 5; Location and/or first impression = 5."
Cindy A.,"San Antonio, TX",1,12,9,1.0,9/20/2016,"I have NOTHING good to say about this place. We had to wait 10 minutes for no reason, NOTHING was  edible, I gave up after sending 4 things back (the calamari was greasy and chewy, the portobello mushrooms were over cooked and resembled and old tire, the poke was way past the 'best by' date, and one bite made me sick for 2 days, thin cut French fries were over cooked, and mashed potatoes were inedible) and even the server was at a loss for anything good to say... This place has slowly declined, we will no longer be going there.... so sad..."
