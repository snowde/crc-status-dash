J G.,"Austin, TX",1,8,,4.0,1/12/2017,Other than the amazingly long menu...everything on it is fab.    The Austin location is always freezing so bring a sweater.
Jordan D.,"Denver, CO",17,2,,5.0,1/20/2017,My daughter so proud she got straight A's with perfect attendance and I took her to Bjs!! Thanks Bjs my family loves you.
Jason H.,"San Antonio, TX",62,36,36,3.0,9/3/2016,Waitress staff is either way slow or overworked. The food is great but service could be better
Bev R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,27,,5.0,2/24/2017,"My first time here...my sisters said it was a good restaurant so I decided to try it. Nice and big...open layout. We ate in the main dining room.  Server was friendly and knew her menu. We ordered potato skins for an appy. Not bad but I've had better.  Around the table we ordered the midnight burger...I think that's what it was called, sone kind of vegetarian salad..my sister loved it, avocado egg rolls and California club. Food was hot and fresh and served timely. Our tea glasses were rarely to half way. All in all a good lunch. The menu is extensive. Lots of food options and drink options. Bottom line...I will be back."
Shakea D.,"San Antonio, TX",32,26,23,4.0,12/11/2016,My family and I love this restaurant the food is really great and so is the service one of our favorite places to eat.Brandon is our favorite server he's the best he is so sweet and answered all our questions he always has great suggestions on food and drinks.We love chocolate pizookie.
Isabella H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,13,8,3.0,2/18/2017,"I was excited to have some quick appetizers on a bit of a time crunch. The spinach and artichoke dip was warm, cheesy, and very good. However, the flatbread (margherita) was underwhelming and the shrimp tacos had undercooked shrimp which is always disappointing. However, the staff was friendly, they take call-aheads, and our food came out quickly. For it being 10:30 at night, the staff was very prompt."
Sarah B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,1.0,2/11/2016,"I have given BJ's chance after chance, and I won't be back.  I was recently there on Monday, February 1st with a party of 20 or so at 2:00 in the afternoon for a farewell luncheon for three of my husband's coworkers. We were some of the first there. I ordered a rootbeer and the ahi tuna salad at 2:05.  The root beer came out quickly enough, but it was pretty flat and had little carbonation. It was the first time I had it, so I'm not sure if that was normal. I had only one since I didn't want a refill.  A 2:45 I asked how much longer my salad would be. That's 40 full minutes after ordering an entree that's barely cooked - the tuna is barely seared - and the rest is lettuce. Seriously? On a slow Monday afternoon it takes longer than 40 minutes to get a salad out? When it finally came, I had to scarf it down since I needed to leave at 3:00. I got more than half way through it before I noticed that the avocado was left out. I couldn't find our waitress to say anything, so I ate it and left my husband there to pay the tab.  The service was slow. The food took much too long. And when it did come, it wasn't even made correctly. Time after time that I've been there, the food has sucked and the service has been mediocre. I cannot for the life of me understand why my friends like this place and keep suggesting we go here."
Priscilla F.,"San Antonio, TX",0,12,11,2.0,8/5/2016,"My first time at BJs, the waiter was really nice and attentive except he was very busy and didn't get to refill our waters.  The quality of the food was just ""okay"".  We ordered guacamole dip with chips and it was plain.   I ordered the pot stickers as an entree, it was ""okay"".  I'm disappointed in the food after hearing that BJs is supposed to be one of the top restaurants.  The glass of cabernet was weak.  I decided not to order dessert.  Good luck if you decide to try the food here."
Annie K.,"San Antonio, TX",94,1,,5.0,11/26/2016,"I love this restaurant! I love being able to come in after work, since they are open so late. The servers are always so nice and personable, so it is always a very pleasant dining experience. I definitely intend to come back and dine again in the future, multiple times."
Haitham W.,"San Antonio, TX",586,3,10,1.0,7/14/2016,Couple bad experiences in a row. Try giving them the benefit of the doubt. First night - server was not happy nor welcoming. Ordered jalapeño burger and it was not appetizing to say the least. Second night - ordered shrimp and asparagus to go and it was mediocre at best.....and I got charged twice. Third night - server was phenomenal. Ordered the queso dip with no chili and it tasted powdery. Calamari was so greasy. Top top it all off....they don't serve the shrimp scampi which was their best food item.
Andrew V.,"San Antonio, TX",36,2,,5.0,10/17/2016,"Good food, good drinks and the best service! Ask for Brandon F. and he'll 100% take care of you! Dudes legit! You're welcome in advance!"
Angel P.,"San Antonio, TX",37,1,,5.0,11/26/2016,Service was awesome and Mark was super friendly. Food has always been great and even better this time in. I will most definitely be telling everyone to come eat at this location. Thanks for the great food and excellent service.
LaToya S.,"San Antonio, TX",15,282,188,3.0,10/21/2015,"I ordered online ribs and double mashed potatoes. Picked up the food and get home to eat it. The ribs were dry, the mashed potatoes were lumpy and hard. I think it would have been much better had I actually dined in as opposed to ordering out because for sure I know they wouldn't put what they gave me on a plate of a customer dining in. 3 stars because the guy who brought the order out was nice."
Richard B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,,5.0,10/30/2016,My favorite in the area! Service is always top-notch and friendly. Pizza and beer are euphoric!!
Jay B.,"San Antonio, TX",150,265,175,3.0,6/24/2016,I've been here a few times and have come to the realization that the best thing here are the Pizzookies...The appetizers are just okay...The pizza's aren't bad...But the Pizzookies are Off the Damn Chain...Especially the Salted Caramel...if there are 2 or more I recommend the Pizzookie Sampler.
DEBE S.,"San Antonio, TX",13,47,,4.0,8/13/2016,"BJ's remains our Fav local place for lunch/dinner in the Alamo Ranch area.  We always sit in the ""bar area"" where there is seat yourself immediate seating available.  Can't remember the last time we had to wait there.   Great beers and wine, awesome selection, happy hour and daily specials and the BJ Rewards program all less than 2 miles from home...what is NOT to like!"
Adam W.,"San Antonio, TX",0,81,24,1.0,8/2/2016,"I've tried BJ's once years ago and it wasn't too bad so I finally went again and it's still pretty good for a chain restaurant it's not great but good ,as for the 4 star rating 3 for the food and an extra for the great service provided by our awesome waitress parris . I had the pizza as I did years ago and it's even a bit better than I remember . If giving the choice as far as pizza goes I'd go elsewhere but for a place that's open late- midnight- it's easily the best late night place for a decent pizza and a few beers !"
Natalia S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,5.0,10/7/2016,"I love this BJs restaurant! Not only is it literally in our backyard, the staff is amazing! I frequent BJs because of the bar staff. They are great. Remember our names, know our beer choice and are always accommodating with our sports channels/preferences. We love the small talk with them. Jarrell, Scott, Ali and Francis rock! Besides the yummy food, They are the reason we enjoy coming here so much."
Ashlet M.,"Temple City, CA",8,19,3,5.0,9/9/2016,Always have great service and such great food. One of my favorite bjs to come to. Their happy hour is in bar area only and has such great prices. Definitely recommend coming to this location!
Ted A.,"San Antonio, TX",75,41,13,4.0,2/15/2016,Great place.  The take-out section of the restaurant is very well used. On this particular night there were 5 people waiting for there to-go orders.  The young lady working the counter was very friendly and did not show any signs of being overwhelmed.  I don't beleive I have ever expereiced bad service at this location. Which is why we keep coming back!
