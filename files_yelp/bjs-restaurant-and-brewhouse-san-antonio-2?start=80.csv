Michelle S.,"Henderson, NV",27,49,,1.0,12/23/2016,"Nasty nasty nasty! Run, don't walk!!! Full disclosure - we just finished a 12 + hour drive and were so desperate we would've eaten at Olive Garden. Oh hell - BJ's b#^+%^ slapped me in the face and said ""wake the eff up b"".  It was terrible."
Roque L.,"San Antonio, TX",160,50,115,2.0,6/2/2015,"Waited at the bar for my food to go, the woman at the queue used the excuse ""It got busy"" mind that it was almost 11 pm and my food was cold when I got home!!  My fist experience there was great, just upsets me that she had the audacity to lie."
Rick B.,"San Antonio, TX",1,12,,5.0,6/12/2016,Had a great dinner the other night on Friday. Our server was Molly she was awesome. I sure wish they would have the Moscow mule is ready to go without having to buy a separate ginger beer and then doing the shot kind of expensive at 15 bucks for a drink. Overall excellent food great atmosphere and service.
Lexi Behuin P.,"Virgin, UT",0,7,,2.0,12/26/2016,We waited for at least 20 minutes for our server to come to our table! Food was good but to be I don't want to wait to be served or wait twenty plus minutes for a drink! The bathrooms were nasty! Toilet paper ever! That bathroom hasn't been checked for at least 2 plus hours!
Chris A.,"San Antonio, TX",68,599,1527,3.0,2/17/2013,"Went here for Happy Hour the other day... They do half price appetizers and $1 off beers. They also have cocktail specials for $4. The food was pretty decent although I only had the appectizers. I would avoid being suckered in by the Thai shrimp appetizer as it was absolutely nothing special and very messy. The best deal was the sliders which I recommend with cheese ($1 extra). It like 4 sliders for $4 or maybe $5, I can't remember.  My biggest issue was with the service. I was with a friend and we ordered a total of 5 appetizers and they ended up bringing them out all at once. Come on! If a group puts in that kind of order you bring it out in waves. And, 2 groups that came in after us got their orders before we did so 2 demerits for the service. Overall the food was good, not great. The service was subpar but they were kind. The beer was pretty good and I would recommend the micro brews they have on tap. Overall, a pretty decent place to watch some sports and get some cheap eats during happy hour."
Billy C.,"San Antonio, TX",49,105,24,4.0,3/4/2016,"Good for almost any situation, BJ's is one of our favorites for quick, varied food options. The flatbread pizzas are wonderful, the drinks options are plentiful and the menu is very diverse. Not as many options as Cheesecake Factory, but the food also tastes a little more authentic and costs less. Great for a casual dinner with friends where everyone may want something different."
Michelle W.,"San Antonio, TX",40,4,,5.0,1/2/2016,"The hubs and I ate at BJ's this evening as we received a gift card for them! We were acknowledged right away by the smiling hostess and seated promptly at a table, which we requested versus a booth.  Our server was Vanessa A. She was very friendly and she brought our drinks promptly. We ordered the Crisp Potato Skins for our appetizer. There were very crispy and flavorful! The portion was more than enough for 2 people! I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed veggies! Hubs had Parmesan Crusted Chicken with the white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli! The meals were delivered in a very timely manner and we both agreed; DELICIOUS!!   Hubs had two glasses of BJ's own Oktoberfest brew, which he really enjoyed.  He would have had a 3rd but, he was driving! Afterward we ordered the Salted Caramel Pizookie To Go! We just finished it. Boy oh boy! A white chocolate chip caramel cookie topped with cinnamon ice cream, drizzled with salted caramel and topped with teeny tiny chocolate chips! Mmmmmmm!  So decadent! Thanks BJ's!  We will definitely visit again!!!"
Jazmyne B.,"San Antonio, TX",39,39,111,4.0,8/11/2015,"Delicious food, pleasant clean atmosphere, & the salads are to die for. That's what sold me, salads are big in portion and looks fresh. Extremely flavorful food and drinks. This is my mom and Is go to spot."
Tiffany S.,"Bowie, MD",125,235,218,3.0,3/5/2014,"So, this place looked a little uppity from the outside and therefore we assumed we'd elect to sit at the bar to hide our jeans & sweaters.  That was pleasantly not the case.  It wasn't too crazy. It wasn't too dressy. Also, there's lots of beer.  We ordered two house beers and a stuffed mushroom app. The beer was surprisingly bitter for our tastes but the app came so fast. And it was DELICIOUS. We both ordered mini deep dish pizzas. A Buffalo for the hub & a veggie for myself. They were amazing.  We also ordered a "" Salted Caramel PiZookie"" which is admittedly the most obnoxious word I've ever heard, but looked good. Imagine a mini deep dish sized cookie, baked with pieces of pretzel in the dough. Then serve it hot topped with Caramel Sauce and cold Ice Cream... There was spoon scraping involved. Worth having to say it twice, and then again when typing this review.  Additionally, our server was adorable & sassy & I want to be his friend."
Tiesha T.,"Charlotte, NC",209,165,453,3.0,6/21/2014,"I had never heard of this place before moving to Texas but I'm glad we gave it a try! Our server was terrible at her job but a sweet little girl. She never checked on us forgot simple things like our drinks and dessert but was courteous. Lord I hope this child stays in school because she ain't cut out for the restaurant biz. The restaurant itself looks very high end but at a Ruby Tuesday or Chili's price. We ate dinner and dessert for under 30 bucks for two people. We don't drink beer but there are tons of beer options and they have sports playing on the TV's so this would be an ideal spot to watch a game. Hubby and I ordered the deep dish bacon ranch pizza with no onion and the berry cobbler for dessert. The 14'' pizza is a good size and thickness, more than enough for two people to share. The crust taste very similar to a pan Pizza Hut crust but less greasy. I am from the south not Southwest and we love cobbler. I have to say I was impressed by theirs! It was the best part of our dinner. They have a pretty cool rewards system set up where if you download their app you can order your dine in or carry out meal ahead of time and tell them when you will be there. You can also do call ahead seating from this app and pay for your meal. If you pay with the app you get five bucks off your meal. It is pretty neat I have never seen a rewards app like it. Each dollar you spend is worth one point and your points are used towards free food or money off your bill."
Drew W.,"Melbourne, FL",10,18,,4.0,12/10/2015,"The almost 2 hour wait was ridiculous, them seating parties bigger than us, when we arrived before them, was ridiculous, but... The food was great, the calamari was a bit disappointing, however, the fried artichokes, were amazing! I had the Double Deluxe, sans cheese...I got my delicious looking burger, but, it had cheese, so they prepared a new one for me. Once my party of 7 was almost finished eating, my burger arrived...it was good, but looked hastily made. Nonetheless, I ate it and enjoyed it's tongue titillating tastes. Overall, bad beginning, great finish!"
Crystalina H.,"San Antonio, TX",7,16,22,3.0,2/5/2015,"I love there rewards program, you can download their app on your phone and sign up. If you have a chance to sign up you won't regret it! There food is always good , I tried there new plate which is the lasagna and it wasnt that great... I've had better plates there, there prices are a little high. But when I do go I always have great service and a great time. Make sure you try the beer samplers !! And there Margarita's!"
Gina C.,"San Antonio, TX",1,4,,2.0,12/11/2016,"Service was good. I ordered the plate with two Mahi Tacos, if you could really call them fish tacos. I have had so much better elsewhere,for a far better price.  The tacos had one little teeny piece of fish in each taco. When I bit into the taco, I was wondering if it had any fish in it. Very sad experience. Go out to eat and order something that I wanted, and just not good.  My husband had the gluten free pizza, which was not spectacular, just okay. Will not be going back. It had been awhile from the last experience,which was the same."
James G.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,189,1,2.0,6/5/2015,"I was travelling on business by myself and went in and asked for a table for one.  The restaurant was half full. The hostess said, ""The bar?"", I responded I wanted a table and she again said that I could eat at the bar.  I didn't want to eat at the bar. When I sat down, she started to say that tonight they were running low on....silverware.  I looked at her and she said that they were low on silverware so it was going to be a few minutes until she had some for me.  I looked at her and said ""I expected to hear some sort of food you are out of, not silverware"" and laughed.  She responded that they had a lot of big parties that night which is why.  (Again restaurant half empty). My dirty martini was served without olives - when I ate my last bit of Pizza another waiter came along and asked if he could take my Parmesan cheese and pepper shakers for another table.   I was left wondering if the place was under bad management or experiencing financialy problems."
Christina M.,"Brownsville, TX",0,2,,4.0,6/6/2016,The food was great. An extra special thank you to Manager David Wheelis for helping set up our reservation. His staff has nothing but nice things to say about him.
Amanda S.,"San Antonio, TX",80,11,7,5.0,6/6/2016,"There's a reason BJ's is a go to for me and my friends - consistently good service and food. The deep dish pizzas are great, and the PZookies are my FAVORITE!! Thanks for another great night!!"
Denise P.,"San Antonio, TX",27,45,30,5.0,3/25/2015,"Our go-to place for beer and apps. The staff is always so friendly, there is ALWAYS plenty of variety and we walk away fat and happy."
Charity P.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,,3.0,5/29/2016,"Food is good. Huge menu with lots of choices. We went there on a Sunday afternoon with no wait but I know from experience that any given Friday or Saturday night will have you waiting from an hour to an hour and a half.  I got the Sriracha queso and chips and my husband got the mozzarella sticks. Both were really good. Our margaritas were a bit sour but the food was so great we really didn't care . I do have a problem with the call ahead policy. Really, if a restaurant isn't going to take reservations then they shouldn't even bother. Basically if you call them and tell them you're coming and ask to put your name on the list when you show up you will be handed a pager and you are put at the end of line. It does absolutely nothing so don't try to call ahead just go. Here is my biggest gripe: THIS PLACE IS EXPENSIVE. And I say that because what you are getting is burgers, pizza, pasta ... We noticed that many of the appetizers were just as, if not more expensive than the main courses. And seriously $9 for a 12 oz margarita? It wasn't even top shelf and tasted like sour mix. I could go across the street and get a huge fishbowl margarita with a beer in it for the same price.  I probably won't be eating here anytime soon except for a special occasion."
Jodi L.,"San Antonio, TX",57,6,,2.0,11/21/2016,"We have historically always enjoyed this restaurant. Our God daughter is basically addicted to the pazookie. Even though it is a bit expensive we would go here about once a month. In the past several visits we have been noting a decline in the food quality. Service is good, but the food is just not worth the cost. We ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was ALL tentacles and clumped together and much too chewy. Next came the chicken tortilla soup...with NO chicken. I sent it back and when the bowl was returned they had simply thrown in a few pieces of grilled chicken. Then they brought the bowl back to me and no big surprise the soup was now cold. Now finally the Flatbread arrives. The flavor was okay but the crust was soggy. We have decided that a cookie desert is not worth it. We won't be going there again anytime soon. Over $100 for a family of 4 and no one enjoyed their food."
Donna H.,"San Antonio, TX",123,258,317,4.0,1/5/2014,"Love this place, close to home.  Regular table service is so-so, we prefer to sit at the bar where we've never had any service issues.  It does get packed at dinner time so be ready to wait.  They have specials during football games (1/2 price apps and alcohol discounts). Wide range on their menu, never had anything we didn't like. Adding on, chose to do an 'edit' vs. an 'update'. I'm keeping them at 4 stars.  Mini pizzas are perfect if you have a group & want to try a few different ones. During happy hour they are $6 and there's no limit on how many you can order. Appetizers are large portions and are also half off during HH.   Sometimes beer can be out due to them being seasonal or made in-house however there are plenty of choices if you need a back up.  Try their cream sodas, they are made in-house & are so dreamy.   It's our local 'drinking hole' and we're here maybe once a week or every other week."
