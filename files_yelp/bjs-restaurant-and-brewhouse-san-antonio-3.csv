Danielle H.,"San Antonio, TX",5,18,55,4.0,10/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I decided to go to BJs at about 6:30 on Saturday night to eat and watch the Spurs game at 7. When we arrived, there appeared to be quite a few people waiting, so I was a little nervous about the wait time. When I asked the hostess, she said it was only 10-15min wait, which was surprising and relieving. Right after putting my name in, we noticed a table opening up in the bar area (open seating) so we just took that table.  Although it was very busy, our waiter greeted us immediately, grabbed some menus and silverware for us, and brought out two waters. He was spectacular.  I started off by ordering the new Tito's electric lemonade and my boyfriend ordered a gin and tonic. I loved my drink! A lot of times it's hard to find a drink that's strong, tastes great, and isn't overly sweet. This was perfect! It definitely had a kick, but the lemon flavor mellowed it down quite a bit. It also wasn't too sweet, which is always so hard to find when you order a ""girly"" drink from the cocktail menu. My boyfriend said his gin and tonic was also very well-made. We also started off with the root beer glazed ribs as an appetizer. These had a good, smoky flavor, but they were slightly dry and needed more sauce.  My boyfriend ordered the house top sirloin with the cheddar mashed potatoes, couscous mac and cheese, and a side Caesar salad. He ordered it medium rare and it came out somewhere between rare and medium rare, which he had no problem with. He said it was fantastic and definitely would order it again. He also loved his salad and mashed potatoes, but he said the mac and cheese was weird- that the couscous gave it a really strange texture. He enjoyed everything except for that.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and added a fried egg to it. It was okay. It definitely has potential, but the patty was overcooked and dry and the fried egg wasn't runny at all (which is what I usually get when I order fried eggs on burgers). It came with a side of fries which were amazing- super crispy and fresh. I'd probably still order the burger again because I think it was probably just an off night.  Overall, everything was good. The service was fantastic and the drinks were perfect. A couple points were lost due to minor issues with the food, but we'll definitely still be back!"
Marcus C.,"Boerne, TX",0,59,,3.0,10/1/2017,"Love BJ'S at the Rim.  Have always had 'great bar service' but due to a party of 4; we chose seating. Seating was great and service for 4 was great. All 4 of us ordered the Prime Rib which is served on the weekends only. Wife and I ordered MED and other couple MED RARE and they all came out the same.  The server never 'asked' how the meal was and wife and I just asked for 'to-go' and being polite to our lunch guests just had it 'to go' and the guy even messed up our desert to go. I've been a long time customer with BJ's and know what not to order and what to. I fault the KITCHEN MGR and CHEF for letting such display of that is 'shown in menu' versus what is given. And to continue - They offer a perfect picture of a 'chicken sandwich"" on their front of their menu but what it is. It's a retangler piece of chicken on a round bun. Let the kitchen MGR know he owes me $3.00 as I had to see McDonold's for two cheeseburgers as could not eat the over RARE Prime rib. As far as Pizza - They do no wrong. It's great and fresh - I'll still return but know what to not to have and other to have and will let my friends know the same. The other issue is the RIM location does not show up as a location within YELP or Traveladvisor."
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,4.0,7/15/2017,"My late night munchies were satisfied by a ""BJ's Favorite"" 6"" mini deep dish pizza. Pretty tasty with a nice buttery crust. As always, I could not resist the call of the mother of all desserts, the Peanut Butter Pizzookie. Thank God I live 200 miles away from the nearest BJ's or I would be having gastric bypass surgery."
Jack S.,"Tucker, GA",511,2,,1.0,1/10/2018,"There was no toilet paper in the women's restroom, and the hostesses were clearly not concerned with the. well being of guests. i highly recommend finding another place to dine. this is not your number one choice. trust me!"
Ron T.,"Boerne, TX",0,1,,5.0,12/6/2017,"My wife and I have been regulars at BJs for several years.  The service, food variety and management make every visit great!! Ron & Helene"
Tammy-Sue K.,"San Antonio, TX",5,85,71,5.0,7/1/2017,"This is an excellent GF thin crust pizza well done. BJ's won me over and trust me I've tried many others! Our server, Melinda, was amazing! She kinda read our minds, bringing us the things we needed before we even asked! AND they have Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, my favorite. This is shorter than my usual review but better something than I forget again! This BJs is amongst their best, Bon appetite"
Bailey N.,"San Antonio, TX",54,240,82,4.0,6/25/2017,"I've had several experiences with BJs. This location...I've never had a problem with. I've had everything from their pasta, to sandwiches...to their other dinner platters. I've always had good food.  Last night I had their Parmesan chicken platter. I think I inhaled it. Wow. Probably the best meal I've had there hands down. We also had dessert...the pizookie trio. They were fantastic too.  Melinda ... I believe ... was the name of our server. What a sweetheart. Took great care of us. She's from El Paso (as am I) so we had a good time chatting about El Chuco town.  On a more serious note about the menus though...every time I've ever been to BJ's....the menus are naaasssty. Sticky and gross. Not enough to lower my star rating...but close."
Angela F.,"San Antonio, TX",493,464,1669,2.0,10/14/2016,"2.5 stars What was I thinking NOT ordering a pizza here?! Pizza = safe, but not great. The half price happy hour mini pizzas used to be dependable but I haven't had one in years so...no se but regrets not ordering that over.... The $3 siracha queso was powdery and too thick. In one word: chalky. There weren't near enough chips and they charged us for more chips.  The chicken Cobb salad was pretty awful...the dry chicken breast had the most flavor of everything in it! Even the bacon was gross; it tasted pre-frozen and fatty in a bad way. The Gorgonzola was the 2nd only enjoyable part. Even the ranch was tasteless...?! How do you ruin a salad? Chili's & BJ's can tell you... My reason for coming - the Jeremiah Red - tasted flat and old. The Harvest Hefeweisen saved happy hour. The Pumpkin Ale just tastes sweet, not at all pumpkin-y.  On the bright side - my friend loved the BJ's Irish Root Beer. The service is good; atmosphere large and festive.  Ugh."
Wayne Y.,"New York, NY",2,6,3,1.0,10/18/2017,"Very poor quality food. I will not patronize this location again. I ordered sliders cooked medium rare, and I received burned sliders on over-toasted buns. This is not the first time I have been served poor quality food at this location."
Ryan F.,"Layton, UT",3,9,,5.0,12/10/2017,"Great beer and food. For beers, I had the Tatonka and a bourbon stout. Both we're delicious. Tried four different pizzas all were very good. Atmosphere was nice, busy but not overcrowded. If in San Antonio you can't go wrong with this spot."
Steph C.,"Sugar Land, TX",264,227,970,5.0,2/8/2017,"I love love love coming to Bj's Restaurant and Brewhouse! Out of all the times I've been here I have only had one complaint which was the calamari was too overcooked but it was not enough to not give them five stars. They took it back no questions asked and gave us a new one. The service is always great, the food is always fresh, and the wait is never to long.  The menu is great, the drinks are great, and they have a huge selection of beer. I'm not a beer drinker but if you are you will love it here. They brew it themselves and have won awards for their signature beers and cider on tap.  Some of the things I love getting here are the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos! This plate is delicious! My fav! I also love the chicken tortilla soup and clam chowder bread bowl. The calamari is also good as well as the potstickers, pizza, and salads. The other day when I came I also tried the stuffed mushrooms for the first time and they were very good.  I also want to add that our waitress a while back was named Debra and she was very kind and on top of everything. We were talking to her and mentioned the experience we had with the calamari and she could also tell my boyfriend was not having a very good day so she brought us a complimentary chocolate chunk pizookie. We were so surprised and thankful. It was so sweet of her I will never forget her kindness. Thank you so much Debra!  The pizookies are a must try and there are different flavors. If you can't decide I would recommend getting the pizookie trio.  If you have not been to this Bj's you have to give it a try!"
Tonya W.,"San Antonio, TX",18,1,1,5.0,12/3/2017,"My boyfriend and I originally came here to this location because we had tried the one in Houston with my brother and sister in law and food was good, but we will definitely be coming back for the service!!!! Our waiter was Austin W. We visited on 02dec2017 for dinner from the moment we sat down till the moment we left was the best service I have ever had. First he seemed to love what he does he was very knowledgeable of the menu very helpful in making our decision. He was so friendly he kept up with our drinks not pile on the table like some places I'm talking to last drink went to set it down he walked over with new drink. He made sure everything was up to our standard when food had come out...... and like anywhere things happen we're human I ordered a steak well done it still had pink but he took care of it immediately and also updated me on how long it would take to rectify then mgr delivered it!!!!!! While we sat in his section the same exceptional service he provided to us he gave that service to @least 4 other tables that we saw seated near us while we were there.....It's nice to see that people still know what exceptional customer service looks like."
Tuan T.,"Dallas, TX",694,282,200,5.0,2/17/2017,"I been going to all the BJs and especially the ones in California when I lived there. I love the chain since they have a good selection and good tasting house brews. My favorite always is the Jeremiah red but this time I tried their new IPA on tap. This location in the Rim area was decent. It wasn't super crowded on Valentine's day which I expected to be a bit more but we were seated right away with no wait. I got the Mediterranean chicken pita taco like things which were decent but I honestly was trying to be healthy and pick from their healthy menu. The beers came out fast and cold and the service was quick. My wife ordered the clam chowder bread bowl which I have personally never had, along with the side of Cesar salad. Both came out really well. I like how they toasted and buttered the top. It was soft and flavorful too. I honestly hope their chain succeeds here. I really enjoy the service and food at BJs."
JR G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,13,2,5.0,10/22/2017,Great casual restaurant with lots of menu items to choose from. Enjoy the atmosphere and the multiple TV's for sports game. Food and service is on point! Highly recommend
Colin B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,21,1,5.0,12/1/2017,"I've been coming here with my kids and parents since they opened. Consistently great food with an almost overwhelming menu of selections. I don't drink,  but I hear the beers are great. I can for sure say the so das are above par, and delicious. I'm writing to commend the bartender,  Dianne. She's just awesome. Under pressure,  still smiling,  full sports bar packed three deep,  no problem. She's just great and seriously knowledge. As a career,  you need to appreciate her skills of consistency in pours,  amazing. She's a good person and a great employee. Train her for management, or whatever she wants!"
Taryn M.,"Far North Central, San Antonio, TX",55,5,2,5.0,11/24/2017,"We chose this place tonight because of the variety on the menu. We knew everyone would be able to find something. 8:30 on a Friday night and we were seated within minutes. Greeted right away. Appetizer came out quickly. Food was great, everyone enjoyed their meals. Server was attentive."
Sam M.,"Liberty Lake, WA",1,9,1,5.0,11/13/2017,"I love BJ's. They always have good food and good service. I got the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger with the signature BJ's Root Beer. They were so great, as they always are. For dessert I got a Pizookie, which is basically a big pan-baked cookie with ice cream on top. The service was amazing and engaging. I even had a very fun talk with my waiter, who was very kind and helpful. I don't think there is anything that they could do better."
Felipe L.,"Little Elm, TX",41,255,313,4.0,5/29/2016,"Not a big fan of chains, but since I am vacationing with family, chains are safer sometimes lol, since i have previously ate here before while traveling for work, so brought the family since we could not decide what we all wanted. Kiddos had the grilled cheese man what can I say it was very good my daughter loved it, and so did I. My son had the mini pizza pecorino, it was also very tasty. Wife had the shrimp tacos, and she said they were absolutely AWESOME! to be honest I was shocked to hear that from here, as she makes her own. I had a Trusted chicken breast in tasty herbs and garlic mashed potatoes, it was a good tasty recommendation from Paula our waitress, she also recommended for me the Nitwit?  Beer good Blue moon clone, all in all a nice  dinner. We also had the Monkey bread yummy family treat. The only NEGATIVE was the Calamari, really greasy and very bland, will never order that again!"
Marco G.,"San Antonio, TX",26,165,121,4.0,7/4/2017,"Came here with the folks looking for a pizza and salad. Walked into a very lively restaurant very big and bright all around with lots of people. I enjoyed the atmosphere more than anything, I felt happy being there. We got sat down and ordered the calamari and the meaty pepperoni extreme pizza. The Cal him I came out first very promptly it was very well cooked crisp and not over battered like it's so common in some places. The marinara sauce though was perfect it was salty enough that it blend in with the calamari. Then the pizza came out in a huge dish very large even though it was a medium I thought it could feed more than four people really. But I had three slices and they were very good a lot a lot a pepperoni and a cheese was pretty good quality. The pizza was covered was a deep dish, covered through which was a struggle to find crust to hold on to lol. But if that's the only issue I had, I feel they have a pretty good setup. I WILL BE COMONG BACK (at the very least for that desert)"
Donovan T.,"San Antonio, TX",314,372,371,4.0,11/6/2016,I am a big fan of BJ's.  BJ's has an extensive selection food. The food here is delicious at an even better price. The menu contains light selections as well as your normal dishes. There are TVs all around so you won't miss your favorite game. The serves are friendly and competent.  Try BJ's beer. BJ's makes a beer mix where they mix 2 types of brews in one glass. They also make some tasty cocktails.  I recommend BJ's for any event.
Tim K.,"San Antonio, TX",3,104,39,4.0,4/15/2017,For such a diverse menu BJs typically delivers good quality and tasty food. Salad are always fresh and come out quickly. Had the brisket and bacon burger tonight which was very tasty and cooked medium as requested. The fries were plentiful and good. Son had the jambalaya which was really good and a nice sized portion. The amount of toppings on the tavern pizza my wife had were a bit sparse so that gave it a 4. Orlando gave us excellent service.
Carl C.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,4,,1.0,2/2/2017,"Worst service I've ever had, I came super hungry at around 11. This is one hour before closing time, and the whole time our server was focused on her side work. I have been in the service industry for years and I know closing duties are annoying, but that shouldn't stop you from taking care of your guests. I ordered the Jalapeño burger and it was super dry, no flavor, but hungry as I was, I ate half my burger. The server came to check up on us and asked how our food was, so I told her it wasn't really up to my expectation. She asked if we wanted to speak to a manager, which I said yes. She came back saying, ""since you ate half the burger we can only offer you dessert"" which I gladly accepted.  The free dessert doesn't make up for the super dry food, and the manager also didn't take the time to come talk to us. I was fine paying for the food since I ate it, but this should have been handled better.  Honestly not going to be back at this location."
Melissa J.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,4,5.0,5/24/2017,Wow!  I have been to several BJs Brewhouses.  This ace was fantastic.  Great service and excellent food.
Kathy H.,"San Antonio, TX",227,100,633,1.0,6/4/2016,"Usually sit at the bar. Always get standard service from bartenders.  Last time ordered red wine. Got it warm (yuck!).  Found out it's because they store their wine bottles on the lighted display.  Told the bartender that was a bad place.  This visit saw that they still had the wine on lighted display and instead ordered a mixed drink. During our dinner, another patron had a medical emergency. Thankful to other patrons for acting quickly to assist the patron.  Very disappointed in all of management's response, they were all hovering from afar and didn't approach until patron was alert again. Very poor pathetic disappointing response! Only the Chef came out and tried to get action with out much success.  They need to seriously working on their medical emergency plan."
Molly S.,"Fort Worth, TX",24,84,117,5.0,6/24/2016,BJ's never disappoints. We always get seated pretty quickly and our server went above and beyond this time! I had the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos and my server offered to change the grains to a side of my choice which I wasn't aware you could do. The pita tacos were delicious and I would definitely recommend them. Also if you join their points club they always send emails about special deals that are going on such as a free pizookie
Yash C.,"Irving, TX",6,11,4,4.0,9/26/2016,Excellent food!!!Our server Mr.Roy and his service is really good.This is my first visit to Bj's.We ordered AvocadosEgg Rolls and Deep Dish ziti it was really tasty and Jumbo Spaghetti meatballs this is okay we didn't liked it much i think it should need some spices. Finally finished off with Pizookie Mini this dessert is very tasty!!! I would recommend this place....
Fecal M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,5.0,11/15/2016,"On Tuesday November 15th, my friend and i, decided to visit bjs at the rim. We arrived at 6:45, hoping to get a couple drinks before happy hour was over. We waited 15 minutes with no acknowledgment or greeting, we then walked out. Im very disappointed because normally we go to the bjs at alamo ranch and we are used to great service. This one is alot closer to where we live, but we will be forced to drive an extra 15 minutes to get great service. Great management.  The seek the problem and fixed it I will visit this location again"
Alex C.,"San Antonio, TX",92,37,8,5.0,3/21/2017,"BJ's is a great place for a quick date night and a cold brew.  This location seems to alway surprise me starting with the food and then the service.  I have been to many BJ's locations throughout the US, and this one takes the icing on the cake.  The servers and cooks have always taken care of me and kept my drink filled and my belly happy.  I hope this level of service keeps up."
Britni W.,"Fresno, TX",129,33,31,5.0,7/19/2017,Mel was our server and she was superb. She was so pleasant and very helpful. She even helped us find a new appetizer that we were blown away by. If any issues came up she was quick to resolve. Our drinks were never empty and she kept up with all her tables with out missing a beat. As a former server she was pretty top notch in my book.
Crystal K.,"Boerne, TX",62,113,450,5.0,7/16/2016,"I love that I can always depend on BJ's for a decent late night bite. Service is always great! We love the many non-alcoholic drink choices. One of my faves is the sparkling raspberry lemonade. My loves they black cherry soda served in a frosted mug. They also have other flavored teas and lemonade's as well as house made orange soda, root beer and cream soda.  Our favorite appetizer is the spinach and artichoke dip.  So far my favorite sandwich is the chicken avocado club omg it's like really good! Like you won't look at anyon her club the same. Chicken breast sliced thin with yummy bacon, melted cheese and sliced avocados, served on soft yet crispy garlic sourdough bread. Every bite is delicious!  One of my other favorites is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which is thinly sliced but they serve you two portions cooked to perfection and served with garlic mashed potatoes. I love to dip my chicken in the mashed potatoes it makes a yummy pair!"
David K.,"San Antonio, TX",0,24,1,3.0,4/6/2017,"I frequently come to BJ's for the craft selection of beer. About 50% of the time I enjoy having the chili in a read bowl.  The few times the bowl was barely carved out.  If there was 1/2 a cup of chili that would be an exaggeration.   My wife had tomato bisque in a bread bowl and experienced the same thing.  She asked for additional soup and the waitress brought out a small cup (1/2 cup?).  We said something about it to the waitress and she just shook her head and said ""sorry- I don't make the bowls.""  If I ever have it again ( I love chili!) I will ask for a bowl and have the bread bowl on the side.    Otherwise,  pizza and other options are good.  Wednesday's are 4$ BJ craft beer nights ( at least for now)."
Diana C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,5,5.0,5/6/2017,"Had a great experience at BJ's as first time diners. Alysha was an excellant waitress, helped us with a Buy-One-Get-One steak meal and movie tickets! She was accomodating, friendly, knowledgable and personable. Thank you for a great forst time visit for our 19th Anniversary!"
James S.,"San Antonio, TX",328,6,,3.0,5/2/2017,The food? Passionate. The bathrooms? Pristine. The hostess? Welcoming. The waiter? Lukewarm.
Courtenay C.,"San Antonio, TX",18,36,2,4.0,8/31/2016,Service is usually average to above average depending on server here so I usually have no issues. Food is good and some items are better than others. Steaks need a little more seasoning. Burgers are big and good. My favorite is the Spaghetti and Meatballs. The added kick and tomato sauce is tasty. I come here often just for that. Drinks are good and they have an impressive list of beers by them or crafts. Def. somewhere you can stay and relax with friends. And almost forgot about there pizookies! Delicious baked cookies over ice cream! So good!
Jennifer S.,"San Antonio, TX",56,121,251,3.0,11/10/2015,Good happy hour wine...half off bottle or glass...half off mini deep dish...calamari was ok and wings were good...good bar food but not blown away.  Staff super nice!!
Jordan W.,"San Antonio, TX",91,6,,2.0,4/18/2017,"Last couple times I have been here have been a real disappointment. They messed up my sandwich one time and I sent it back (yes I know taking a risk) and I got it back in 5 min (when it took 45 minutes to get it the first time). All they had done was scrape off the stuff that wasn't supposed to be on the first time and brought it back, but it still had it all on it like I wouldn't notice. What if someone had an allergy to something and they did that, it was just a real slap in the face as a customer. Had some other bad times after that when I was dragged to go here by other people, from slow service to not very good food. Just save your time and get your food somewhere else."
Sarah G.,"San Antonio, TX",17,75,64,2.0,7/13/2016,Went for a late a late dinner with a group of friends on a Tuesday night.Service was really lacking despite the place being empty.We order drinks from the bar and it was nearly 15 mins before we got them.the watermelon basil margarita was really good!(once I actually got it)the food was also good for everyone. We had to constantly ask for refills.We decided to order pizookies and those took awhile to come out as well.Then on top of that the ice cream was melted on one as if it had been sitting out! :/ Food was good service could improve though.
Anna Jo K.,"Abernathy, TX",0,11,3,5.0,2/11/2017,"Kudos to this BJ's!!! Orlando, our waiter, was AWESOME!!!! The food was amazing. The managers were fabulous! Can't say enough positive!!!!"
Fernando U.,"Gainesville, VA",68,182,61,4.0,6/19/2016,Every time we visit BJ's we try something different and have thus far been impressed with all of their offerings.  The staff is well prepared and informed on their menu.  We'll keep visiting BJ's.
Joe P.,"Adkins, TX",0,18,,3.0,8/14/2017,Went with large group for bd party. I was disappointed in quality & quantity of food. I had the mahi tacos tortillas were thin store bought served with tortilla chips very sad. The beer wasn't very cold. The only bright spot was the service Bryan C was excelent.
