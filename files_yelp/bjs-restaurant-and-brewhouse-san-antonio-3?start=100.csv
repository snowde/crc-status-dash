Howard H.,"San Antonio, TX",15,54,,5.0,11/7/2014,Good food and fast service. Nice place and great bar. Very busy when I was there. Nice spot to eat after a movie.
Lady R.,"Austin, TX",10,270,79,2.0,7/28/2013,"Sooo... reminded me of another chili's just with added Italian items. Not good and not bad. I loved that we were greeted by a really cheery, sweet host, but that was quickly ruined by our waitress who seemed like she didn't want to ever talk to anyone. We ordered pizzas, shrimp scambi, salads, and an appetizer. Food tasted like commercial made food and much of it was tasteless. I felt like I was eating salt bars when eating the pizza. Could only eat two bites. It was REALLLLLLYYYY SALTY! Aren't salads supposed to come out first and not last? But our wait time for the food was only about 25 minutes and we were sat right away.  What are my suggestions? Warming up a pizza at home ($6) instead of spending $20 for the same pizza here. I will try BJ's again, but wouldn't recommend it for good food."
CJ D.,"Port Aransas, TX",2,4,,1.0,10/31/2014,Ordered the jalapeno burger to go and SIMPLY asked for no onions and no sauce. Never thought they could screw up such a simple order. Ended getting a hamburger with nothing on it all! 2nd time now they have screwed up my order. Oh and the burger tasted like sh*t. Won't ever go back to that BJs again and for sure dont recommend this location at all.
Beth E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,8,,5.0,2/5/2016,"BJ'S is our favorite neighborhood restaurant! The food is amazing, cocktails are great and the burgers are the best. Great waitstaff and a great management team. Our BJ'S is perfect!!!"
Rozzi P.,"San Antonio, TX",1,11,1,5.0,2/22/2015,Fantastic service!!!!!!! Had such a good time and the food was great!!! My sister in law and I had the pink Cadillac and they were wonderful! Will definitely be back.
Carol C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,8,,5.0,2/1/2016,"We've gone to BJ's many times. They have reasonably priced, good food. The skinny fries are excellent and the home made Root Beer is very good. They have a huge menu with burgers, pasta, pizza and many other things. Everything we have tried here, has been good and the food always comes out to the table, hot. That is not the case at every restaurant."
Ashley K.,"San Diego, CA",69,171,2,3.0,8/3/2012,"I wrote this on 7/15. I'm here right now and man our waiter blows. Drinks took forever. Wine took an additional 15 minutes or so. Came right before the pizza. This guy is seriously high. He doesn't hear half of what we say when we order. He's blonde with short spikey hair, and vampire dark circles under his eyes. And he just handed us Parmesan that's empty. Seriously, drug test this guy. Then he leaned over out booth, literally on the booth, yelling something like ""No way, seriously?!?"" at another waiter. And when we started and said ""what?"" he noticed we were occupying the booth and backed up laughing and saying sorry. I like BJ's but that was a bad experience."
Nick S.,"Center Point, TX",4,15,6,2.0,6/8/2014,"Their ribeye was barely cooked properly but it was definitely overseasoned and caked in pepper. Dry too. Was like eating beef jerky. Overpriced. For some reason there is valet parking but this place was full of men in baseball caps. I'm not saying I'm a fine diner or gourmand but I did not get a good ribeye steak and that's about as simple as it gets. Also, they said they screwed up the baked potatoes, so they gave me ""loaded"" mashed potatoes instead. I was expecting some chives but all I got were some oversalted mashed potatoes covered in thick melted cheddar about half an inch thick. What a tasteless joint. You should have seen the bill too. What a dump. Only at there because I was visiting someone at a local hotel. Should have gone to Red Robin. At that place is honest about being a low-brow chow hall. I should have gone to Rudy's or Bill Miller."
Shaz B.,"Houston, TX",131,196,56,2.0,4/6/2014,"I'd like to start this review off by saying this much: this place has been my chain restaurant guilty pleasure for many a years now. Unfortunately enough, this particular location has done a poor job with its customer service, which makes me question why I even return here. The food is better than many other big name restaurants around, but the service and staff here is no bueno. Food-wise -- I'm a big fan of their cajun pasta (with blackened chicken), their pizzas (usually the 'mediterranean'), their flatbreads, a few of their appetizers, and of course, the pizookies are the most rockin'. Don't get me wrong; the food is definitely worth a try, or more. Service-wise -- No, no and no. I don't mean to take away from the servers that have been on point, because there are also those, but the few that have been unpleasant and irresponsible, I'm not a fan of. And what's worse is that they know they've been that way and choose to ignore it. Example below. There have been a few times where I've decided to order curbside takeout (before 9 p.m., you have the option to have one of them come out and bring your food to your car). I usually get the fettuccine alfredo, which ALWAYS comes with bread. Now, the last three times I've ordered this, there's always been an issue. The first time - they were ""out of bread,"" so my order didn't come with any bread, which I was fine with, since that's understandable. The second time, I strictly said that I wanted no meat with my order of the alfredo and the side order of the macaroni and cheese - not only did I not receive bread, but I also got the macaroni and cheese with bacon. I called back to see if I could get an exchange or a refund, but the girl who was helping me decided to put me on hold for around 20 minutes. I hung up, called back and my calls went unanswered. I decided to leave it and not waste my time. Then, the third time, I ordered the same alfredo, yet what I got was a handful of pasta jumbled up in sauce, and once again, no bread on the side. I know BJ's has great quantity when you usually order, especially seeing from my orders at other locations, but this one has continued to slack when it comes to their to-go orders. The worst part of all this is that I sent an e-mail to corporate to inform them of what was going on, with pictures and all, and about six weeks later, I still have yet to hear from them. As I said, the food is usually good and better than most chain places around, but I don't like coming here any longer, and haven't since the last time."
Thomas K.,"Sugar Land, TX",18,3,,2.0,10/5/2014,Pretty loud place. The waiter never did get my BJ Points right despite numerous tries.
Scott D.,"San Antonio, TX",14,9,9,2.0,4/24/2012,"I ordered the COBB Salad (take out).  While it was certainly large, at a price tag of nearly $14.00 I would have expected more than a box full of chopped lettuce.  The premium toppings (bacon, turkey, avocado, etc.) were practically non-existent - just mere scraps really.  They did put a decent amount of Feta cheese on the salad. Due to the way the salad was prepared, it had very little flavor.  You really had to dig for a crumb of bacon. Very disappointing since I have enjoyed their food on 2 previous occasions."
Victoria H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,5.0,1/8/2016,"Bj's at the rim is the best in San Antonio.  It's clean, with great food and a welcoming atmosphere for all ages. Service is outstanding and beer is even better. The whole staff makes sure to take very good care of every guest. I always leave saying wow I love this place!! I always go back, I'm hooked!!"
John G.,"Knoxville, TN",154,431,1082,3.0,4/13/2014,"Somebody tell me how to give half-star rating please!  This place deserves 2 1/2 stars. Nothing unique or special about this place, corporate, chain joint trying to cut costs at every corner, at least our server was nice and attentive.  We had two beers and two appetizers for 33 bucks, just saying, sure glad we had a gift certificate!  The flat bread pizza was paper thin.  Beer was standard and overpriced, 5.25 for a house brew?  I would only return to this place for happy hour maybe or if someone else was footing the bill to be honest."
Heidi K.,"San Antonio, TX",95,105,,4.0,9/11/2012,"Very good chain food. I enjoy many menu items. The beer selection is amazing. I love the Jeremiah Irish Red, Octoberfest, and a seasonal Pumpkin brew they had last year. (Hope it comes out again!)"
MJ C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,43,15,4.0,1/20/2013,Awesome avocado egg roles. Also loved their tomato & mozzarella salad. I had the California burger. It was bland. Service was great. Waitress was very helpful and she made sure we had our drinks replenished and asked sufficiently if we needed anything. I will definitely be back.
Catherine A.,"Bangor, ME",268,558,1344,4.0,9/4/2012,"BJs is a great find in the southeast. Whether you're in the mood for a filling deep dish pizza or just tapas, BJs is the place for you. From their appetizers to their desserts, the meal will be filling so come hungry. And be sure to save room for dessert, BJs specializes in the most delicious cookie dessert called the ""Pizookie"" a warm, gooey, delicious cookie that's baked in a pie tin. If I still don't have your attention, how about the french vanilla on top or the that cookie comes in three different amazing flavors. BJs is a great as a group destination for birthdays or celebrations or as a date. The restaurant has group seating or intimate booths to make the night truly special. BJs has great beer selections and always has ESPN on so you won't miss anything by going out to eat. Nestled right in the heart of the RIM go catch a movie afterward for the truly perfect experience."
Anthony S.,"Harrisburg, PA",176,300,154,3.0,4/3/2012,"I usually try and stay away from reviewing chain restaurants because I don't really see the point.  When you go to a chain restaurant, you know what you are getting.  You are going to get mediocre food that is relatively high in calories and just OK. I don't think there is any chain restaurant out there that I would give anything but 3 stars to.  This review though is meant to highlight some aspects of Bj's which makes it a little different and give them some recognition for the things outside the norm that they do well. Food: I have never had a good meal here.  I have eaten lunch here twice, and dinner here twice.  Each time, I completely under-satisfied by their meals.  I have had a burger that was drier than the desert and under-seasoned/ not seasoned at all, a bun that was seared better than the meat on the bun, and lettuce/tomato on a sandwich that was mealy and mushy.  I hate their entrees.  Their appetizers and desserts, on the other-hand, are very good.  I love their potato skins, their pizookies, and their other appetizer offerings. Simply put, f you want to go to BJ's, go and get a wide variety of their appetizers.  Even their flat bread pizzas are awesome.  This is a real go-to spot for us when we have the munchies, or we just want some good ole' junk food.  The real star of the show here though is the Root Beer. This may sound strange, and you may be thinking, ""Anthony, you are writing this review because of the damn root beer?""  To you I would respond, ""hell yea!""  This is the very best root beer I have EVER had.  It is unbelievable how good it is.  You need to get a frosty mug of it AND...AND it is free refills.  This root beer should not be 'free' anything.  I would pay money for a second mug of it--that is how good it is.   A little background on my history with root beer: I have been a root beer lover for years.  I have been to hundreds (yes, hundreds) of micro-breweries in the Finger Lakes, and across the U.S. that brew their own root beer--each with their own unique twist.  Up to this point, Saranac Root Beer was the clear winner--no argument.  Now, Bj's root beer is a clear winner at Number 1.  Amazing root beer, really. Food: 1 star for entrees + 2 stars for appetizers +1 star for root beer = 4 / 5 stars Service: As with any chain restaurant, this is hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a server who just started employment and they don't secretly loathe every customer that they have--and sometimes you get that veteran server who genuinely hates everyone and pretends to be nice--until they run out of 'nice' and stop giving a damn (yes, speaking from experience). I have generally had more enjoyable experiences than unemployable experiences Service: 3 / 5 Atmosphere: This is another thing that the location at The Rim has going for it.  I think that atmosphere is really nice.  The furnishings are classy, the bathrooms are clean, the floor is clean, the servers seem clean, the bar is clean, and everything amount the restaurant makes me want to come back--even if their entrees suck.  That is a pretty darn good atmosphere.  The only thing that taints this sometimes, are bad servers. Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: When we order appetizers, we usually go during Happy Hour so that they are half price.  I sit back and throw-back a cold one (root beer that is), and eat some delicious munchies while enjoying the company of friends or family.  Would I pay full price for an entree ever again?  Hell no.  Would I pay full price for an appetizer?  Depends on the appetizer.  Would I pay full price for a pizookie (dessert)?  Hell yes!   Price 3 / 5  Final / Concluding thoughts:  Honestly, if their entrees were better, this place would be awesome!  Unfortunately though, they just aren't--they are actually bad.  But we take this place for what it is--an awesome hang-out spot that is clean and fun to get together with people and drink some root beer (and yes, their regular beer too!) and vacuum-up some good appetizers.  Then, you get to finish everything off with a really delicious, moist, gooey, and satisfying pizookie.  This restaurant serves a very specific purpose for us--hang out and bar food.  It is definitely not a place we go to have a good meal. One final note, it sucks to find parking on a weekend, a Friday night, or other 'rush' times."
Adrian W.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2015,Worst service ever.  Waited for waitress for 30 min after we set down during lunch hour.   At least the manager took our order after the complain.   Then it took another 30 min to get our food.  Food is average but service is Horrible!
Michael W.,"San Antonio, TX",168,37,74,5.0,5/4/2012,Excellent staff & tops in management! Newest brew is the MOAB (Mother Of All Beers) Hop Storm IPA! Bar service is super with Adrienne! Enjoy your next lunch at a premier San Antonio watering/eating place!
Eric W.,"San Antonio, TX",0,19,1,4.0,7/29/2013,"Wings are good. Trying new beer here is fun.  The atmosphere is good.  Several of the plates I tried here were okay, nothing some are  good . I guess the trick is keep it simple  with wings, pizza and beer. They do have good reverse happy hour. I have fun when I go with a group and sit in bar area."
