Isaac L.,"San Antonio, TX",37,80,4,1.0,11/16/2013,Ever have dinner and the service and food just didn't meet your minimal expectations? This was one of those visits. We ordered a pizza with extra sauce and they didn't put any sauce.  Their solution was to bring cold sauce and that's what they did. The waitress had zero personality. She was not rude but not friendly.
Brent L.,"San Antonio, TX",256,706,1301,4.0,5/30/2012,"Really good food selection and great service.  I had the parmesian crusted chicken sandwich with a basil and fresh tomato topping on it along with shredded lettuce.  My meal was only $5.99 - you just can't beat that.  The next time I go, I will be trying the chicken fried chicken plate - it sure looked good!"
Kenneth S.,"Madison, AL",0,12,12,1.0,1/7/2013,"We were visiting San Antonio, Texas for Christmas and was going to meet family for a lunch. We had 9 in our party including 2 children. This was our chance to see three family members that had been sick and could not join us for Christmas Eve. The service was terrible having food coming out as much as 35 minutes after the first servings came out. We had to get the Manager to eventually get all our food. The food was GREAT which was the only redeeming part of this visit. I would really think before coming to this location again. If you try this location I hope your experience will be MUCH BETTER than this..... :("
Amanda B.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,96,25,5.0,9/28/2011,"Best location in San Antonio. (I think a few morons had a mythical Huebner Rd. location mistaken for this, it is the Rim location)  So great, service food, everything. Call ahead, they are busy every night. The restaurant is designed perfectly, but waiting around for a seat with the traditional SA crowd can really do a number on one's appetite. Motz sticks and wings are too good. Pizza's are delightful. I love these so much I have yet to venture elsewhere no matter how enticed.  Paced yourself and get a pizzookie, I have forgotten this many times and been unable to physically take on another bite. It is heartbreaking every time. Every time."
Mariana F.,"Del Rio, TX",1,14,5,5.0,6/24/2015,I love BJ's. The food is great! I'm not too much of a drinker but I love most of their beers. My favorite is the the pumpkin ale. I have never had a bad experience at BJ's. I will always recommend this place!
Kate K.,"San Antonio, TX",19,221,,4.0,4/30/2012,"I actually really like BJ's, and it's probably my favorite of all the big chain restaurants.  Their deep dish pizza is what I always get; it's one of my favorite pizzas ever.  Their beer selection is pretty stellar, and I usually try the special brew.   And of course, the pazookie is to die for."
Tracey G.,"Allen, TX",0,4,,5.0,8/10/2014,We stayed at the La Cantera resort and were looking for a place nearby with an extensive gluten free menu because of celiac.  BJs was wonderful.  We even ended dinner with the gluten free pizzuci.  Thanks for a great experience.
S B.,"McKinney, TX",0,4,,3.0,7/27/2014,"Pros:  The New Chicken Pita Tacos were delicious and the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza was wonderful too. Our waitress was very fast, efficient, polite, and she gave great service.  Restaurant was very clean.  Cons:  The Jambalaya was SO spicy, it could not be eaten, and we are spicy food eaters. It felt like the chef poured a quadruple amount of Cayenne Pepper in the recipe and that amount of Cayenne does not make it a Cajun dish. Someone please tell the chef to back off the red pepper."
Andrya S.,"Kaiserslautern, Germany",67,170,23,3.0,11/15/2013,"BJs is standardly good on all counts, but nothing special. It's a go-to spot for us when we have visitors that frequent places like Applebees or Outback, as it seems just a step-above those, but doesn't get into the realm of exploration that might scare these visitors a bit.   We love, love the Pizzookies (desserts) -try the peanut butter one- but noticed that the kids version is $2.25, while the Trio for the adults (consisting of three of the kids sized dishes) costs $9.50 for the exact same thing. Sooo, we'll be ordering the kids' version next time.  Their beer is good, and so is their home-made rootbeer. None of the food has been overly impressive, but it's never bad either.  We did have an issue with them accidentally putting the spicy marinara on a kids' spaghetti dish on our last visit.. we thought the girl was just trying to not eat, so no one believed her when she said it was spicy... :( After a difficult time getting her to eat it, one of the adults finally tasted it, and poor thing... it was really spicy! When we asked the waiter about it, he said the spicy and regular sauces look the exact same, so someone must have messed it up in the kitchen. Not a huge deal, but maybe a comp or a new spaghetti would have been nice... and a perhaps a sign in the kitchen clearly distinguishing the sauces...  All in all, it's an easy place to go with a wide variety of people because the menu is large and there is something for everyone. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, and certainly never as a special treat, but when you are having trouble deciding where to go due to a variety of tastes in a group or a preference for standard American food, this is a safe bet."
Crystal C.,"Chicago, IL",5,33,5,1.0,8/4/2011,"This is my second time trying to give this place a chance, but it was just as horrible as the last time. We had a birthday party here and everyone left dissatisfied. The food came out cold and the service was stagnant. Never got our drinks refilled, and we had to ask repeatedly for things, which never came.  Once we received our bill, the waitress had no problem adding a 17% gratuity to all of our checks. Well, we were more than upset about this, considering we had such lousy and neglectful service. We told this to the manager, and the only thing she offered to do was take off the gratuity on our bills, but that was all. She could have offered something better, but she was very smug and didn't care.  BJ's is a large corporate chain and it seems that they could careless about their customers' bad experiences. I will NEVER come back here again. They're too overpriced for bad food and service."
Vanessa M.,"Winsted, CT",248,452,1098,4.0,1/2/2012,"I have to say Im extremely impressed. I organized our Holiday Team Lunch here, which consisted of about 12-15 of us. We ordered in advance to save some time and sometimes that can be a crap shoot. This was no crap shoot. Food arrived as soon as we did and it was hot and delicious. Everyone seemed pleased. Drinks were refilled in a timely fashion and we even had time for dessert which was also fantastical in itself. Thanks you Bjs for making our team lunch a success."
Amanda H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,13,,5.0,4/13/2014,Awesome service beginning when we first walked in the door. Hostesses were so welcoming and friendly. Server was no different. Love this restaurant chain and especially this location!
Jake W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",206,97,168,2.0,8/29/2011,"Another large, publicly-traded chain (NASDAQ: BJRI)  that spends more money on decor and flat-panel TVs than on its food. It also hopes its patrons will spend more money on its 'signature' cocktails and craft beers, ostensibly to wrest attention away from the less-than-stellar food. The menu is a riff on that of another popular publicly-traded casual dining chain, The Cheesecake Factory (only the latter's food is so much better). Seriously, the menu is a heavy, spiral-bound book with mouth-watering photography that does little more than confuse the patron. It was lunchtime, so I ordered a salad, the Santa Fe Salad.  The blackened chicken was cold, the greens included some parts of the head of lettuce that you normally throw away, and the combination of flavors was just off.  The fire-roasted peppers were from a jar. I actually returned 2 other times, hoping for tastier experiences, and they were just blah."
Nate V.,"San Antonio, TX",10,1,,2.0,4/4/2014,"Food is good and the beer is great. However, it seems that every time I come here the service takes longer and longer and the wait time for food is ridiculous. Prepare to wait about 45 min to an hour for your food."
John H.,"San Antonio, TX",102,486,86,3.0,10/29/2011,"I'm not a big BJs fan (uh-huhuhhhuhhuhhh... he said he's not a BJ fan).... The microbrews are just OK, the food always seems really heavy to me and they all kind of look the same.  I'm really curious about where the microbrews come from as there's a lot of magic hand wave over on the website (which reeks of shiners)."
Marc M.,"San Antonio, TX",2,11,7,1.0,6/17/2013,"It's playoff night in the Finals and we Arrived around 11pm.  We sit forever waiting on a server.  One finally came and said ""I am not your server but what do you want to drink.""  It went down hill from there finally had to go get  the manager, the service was awful. It seems to me if these places  want to stay open later than most they should at least have servers who are not having a coronary to leave and go home and really are there to serve.   BUT the real kicker: Cory Joseph (Spurs)arrives with his family and  is seated  in the table directly in front of us and  its late.  It took forever for them to get the drinks then their order came out one or two plate  at a time I was so disappointed of the lack of service they presented to he and his family.  By the time the last person received their plate some of the first had cold plates or were finished.  When they brought them their last plate they brought the bill with it.  Then they practically kick them and us out because they wanted to go home turning off the lights and turning off all he flat screens.  Some of the Joseph's  party had not even taken two bites.  Hey you can screw around with us BUT YOU CAN'T SCREW AROUND WITH OUR SPURS. THE WAY THEY WERE TREATED THEIR  WHOLE MEAL SHOULD'VE BEEN COMPTED.   CORY is way to polite and respectful to say anything.   We finally got our check And left two or three minutes before they did . When they came out they saw us and our car with all the SPURS  flags on it and stop and talk to us and even took a picture with us. WHAT A GUY AND HE REPRESENTS THE SPURS SO WELL.   Get your act together BJ GO SPURS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Erika B.,"San Antonio, TX",30,144,25,5.0,10/19/2011,"Ok first off I love love their porter.  It is a great dark beer that has a wonderful caramel undertone.   Ben and I always get a flatbread pizza.   FYI You can get any pizza on their menu as a flat bread.  So we love and typically get the vegi and Mediterranean pizza.  But tonight we took a risk thank's to our waiter Matt and picked the Cheeseburger pizza.   Absolutely love it!  THANKS Matt.  It tastes just like a cheeseburger.  You can really taste the pickles, onions and bacon.  We also had the ahi poke stack which was tasty.   We then moved on to the wings.  You can get boneless or with bone.    You can get 5 of one flavor and five of another.  We tried the hot and spicy and garlic parmesan.  Great picks and to me the wings were spicy but I am a light weight when it comes to spicy.  The parmesan and garlic sauce was excellent and lived up to its description.  Eat safe and enjoy."
Dave H.,"San Antonio, TX",213,485,220,3.0,3/20/2011,I can't believe this wasn't in Yelp.  Great beer selection. Avoid the flatbread Pizza if you like a lot of toppings.
Valerie A.,"San Antonio, TX",15,13,14,4.0,1/28/2013,This location has always been a favorite. Close to so many other venues. Good food and the staff is always friendly. I was thrilled to be enjoying my first pizookie and it was DELICIOUS! Excited to go back for my birthday to get my free PIZOOKIE!!
Jill C.,"San Antonio, TX",36,74,,2.0,9/3/2013,"My family left BJ's wondering, ""Do they know what seasoning is? Do they have salt in the kitchen?"" That was by far the blandest food I have ever eaten in my life. Granted, we did not order pizza, which I have heard is quite good, but if that's all they can do well then they shouldn't have dozens of other items on their menu. Boring, bland, flavorless food."
