Jamison E.,"Sugar Land, TX",7,147,63,3.0,9/9/2013,"Avacado egg rolls were meh had them before and remembered them better. Hubs got black and blue burger. Rated burger good but not true blue cheese more like blue cheese spread. Both agree 3 stars. Went on a Friday night and the place was absolutely packed and the wait was long. Since the place has opened we have been probably 2 times. It isn't one of our ""go to"" restaurants but  when we have exhausted all our usual places we may return."
Christian T.,"San Antonio, TX",90,36,3,5.0,2/11/2013,"This place is slowly becoming my favorite place to have dinner at with my girlfriend, They have the problem of having too many things in the menu, but that does give you alot of options. When it comes to the drinks, what can you say, they have awesome beers! They even let you mix and match. A bit on the pricey side, but not too bad."
Jack C.,"Boerne, TX",9,1,,2.0,2/8/2012,"Whats up with the service tonight at BJs?  Staff seemed very confused and disorganized!  Stopped in with a friend after a game of racquetball to get a beer & food; having been coming in on Wednesdays for a month. Sat in the bar area; waited 10 minutes before a server showed up.  He took our drink order; when he returned with the drinks, he informed us that another server would be taking our food order.  He returned 10 minutes later - frustrated - and took our food order.  Twenty minutes later, the young lady - who was supposed to take the food order - informed us that the kitchen had made a mistake and that she would get the correct order out to us shortly.  When we finally got our food, the burgers were good but, the fries were cold!  Then she disappeared, returned later, left the check, and disappeared again.  The young man returned, took my card and brought back the receipt.  Very disappointing overall"

Sheila R.,"South Jordan, UT",20,13,13,1.0,6/23/2013,"I've been to a few BJ's restaurants in California and loved the food and the service along with the cleanliness.  The San Antonio location is by far the worse service, dirtiest, and believe it or not.... My main entree was spaghetti and they serviced it to me with noodles and meatballs minus the meat sauce.  I had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my meat sauce.  The manger felt bad and gave me a free dessert.   I just ordered an appetizer, one entree, a drink and a dessert and it took about an hour and half that includes waiting for my check.  A couple who came in 30 mins after us was long gone and I was just starting to eat my free dessert."
Armando Z.,"San Antonio, TX",21,9,,1.0,7/30/2012,"My email to BJs today:  My wife and I visited the location at The Rim today for lunch. As we wanted to enjoy the Olympics while we ate, we decided to sit at the bar. A young lady named Adrianne was behind the bar. She greeted us and took our drink order. When she returned a minute or so later with a club soda and Shirley Temple, she asked if we were ready to order. We asked to have a few minutes as my wife had not had the time to look at the menu. After 4-5 minutes, she returned and took our order. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad and my wife the Hawaiian Mahi. Over 25 minutes passed without her following up with us. Adrianne visited with a couple at the end of the bar and fiddled with her cell phone from time to time. I finally had to ask her to please check on our food; within 3-5 minutes our food finally appeared. It should be noted that there were no more than six people sitting at the bar while we there (including ourselves), so I was somewhat surprised at the level of service. I enjoyed my salad and my wife thought that the fish was ok. As many times as I have come for lunch during the work week this is the first time I have received service as poor as this; it also the very first time I have never left a tip due to the lack of service *anywhere*."
Sylvia M.,"San Antonio, TX",48,38,20,1.0,7/9/2012,"TO LITTLE TO LATE !                           The BJ'S ""The Gold Standard of Operational Excellence""                                                 YEAH NOT SO MUCH!         DATE NIGHT... Dinner and a movie....wow what a great idea unless you go to BJ's for food at 7:10..... 20 minute wait to get a table, no problem, no surprise I asked about the wait.. However I  was surprised to see a fair amount of empty tables so why the wait??? Ahh never mind we are hungry its already 7:30  Sunday night. We took that wait time to read the menu and decided our order. Greeted with-in 5 minutes by our waiter who took our order and got  us drinks.....never to be seen again!! Oh yeah except a cameo appearance in a walk by scene where I begged for food as he passed us. Still we waited!   WOW I somehow go my difficult hamburger order (not) by 8:20 only to realize  no food for my husband .. Guess there no spicy  wings fly around in a beer join????  TO LITTLE TO LATE MY HUSBAND LEFT HUNGRY!!...the manger comped by burger, really you are kidding me that's it.... its now 8:45.                                   THANKS BJ'S FOR TOTALLY SINGLE HANDED                                RUING DATE NIGHT FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND!"
Sonja B.,"San Antonio, TX",29,344,1,5.0,4/9/2011,"We ate dinner here on our return from a vacation. The waiter was attentive, helpful, and thorough.  The food was great; however, the portions were immense. And I'm saying this as someone who likes to eat! I ate my burger (cheese, green chilies, avocado, etc.) over 2 days.  The hubby got the trio appetizer platter. The fried artichokes were good (I've had better elsewhere). The ahi tuna appetizer was, according to the hubby, outstanding. I did not try it. The Bruschetta - that was one of those moments when you enjoy life just for finding something so incredibly good and simple.  If you ever go to this restaurant - get the Bruschetta. I'm not kidding. It's special.  I also had the berry cider. Worth getting- It was light and very refreshing."
Frank C.,"San Antonio, TX",2,66,,2.0,10/10/2014,"Terrible. train the cook. I had passed this place before at the Rim so I thought I would try it. Very impressive building, nice greeters and a great waiter. But it ends there. Burger and thin crispy fries. Fries were exactly like Freddies Frozen Custard and they arrived COLD, not lukewarm, just cold. The burger has a huge bun, but no sign of the mayo I asked for. It was dry. There was one thin limp piece of lettuce, no onion, 3 pickle slices(dill) and three slices of tomato, one which had the stem in the center. It should have been thrown out. Like I said before, train the cook. Place was not busy(I wonder why) and the food was still hit and miss? Go somewhere else..."
Alvaro V.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,27,4.0,8/23/2013,This place is awesome..everything in the menu is delicious...i had the Enlightend mango salad and it is to die for
Caitlin S.,"San Antonio, TX",15,22,1,4.0,8/8/2014,"I've only been here twice, and the first time was several years ago.  It was Friday night, so the mall was packed, as was the parking lot for the restaurant.  We actually had to go park at Red Robin because we couldn't find a spot.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but that was fine.  Our waitress was great-she was friendly, very attentive, and knowledgeable.  It was very busy inside the restaurant, not one free table the entire time we were there, and the food came out pretty quick considering the hustle and bustle!  She kept our drinks filled and was always checking on us as she walked by.  My mom and I got the 2 for $22 deal which includes your choice of two of their salads or soups, a medium pizza, and a pizooki.  We both got the wedge.  The blue cheese dressing was delicious, however, I think that it could have used some fresh cracked pepper.  We chose their signature pizza, which comes with green peppers, white onion, pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, black olives, and seasoned tomatoes.  The crust was PERFECT.  Crispy on the bottom, and slightly chewy in the middle.  The toppings were good, but there was almost no sauce to be found.  However, the crust and the toppings more than made up for that, and we were hungry, so we didn't even think of sending it back.  I had their Berry Burst Cider and wow was it tasty!  It was the perfect summer drink, light and refreshing, not a high alcohol content either.  It was like adult dessert in a glass...For our dessert, we chose the salted caramel pizooki.  The waitress had me at salted caramel, pretzels, and chocolate.  It was every bit of delicious that she described and more.  I took one bite and was in a blissful state.  The three of us shared it, and it was just the right amount.  I will definitely be going back for more pizza, berry burst cider, and salted caramel pizookis!  My dad had the jalapeno burger, which was my recommendation from the last time I ate there.  It was a HUGE burger, with a very generous portion of tasty, seasoned fries.  The bill took a little long getting there due to a computer error, but I have no major complaints, and definitely like their food.  Two thumbs up!  I do have one issue, though.  I used the ladies room and noticed a very strange series of art on the wall.  Pictures of flowers, and a shirtless, very muscular young guy holding tires and flexing his muscles.  What is all that about?  Not tasteful at all.  I felt violated having that guy on the wall of the bathroom.  I wonder what's in the men's bathroom?"
Fran S.,"San Antonio, TX",197,42,52,4.0,11/21/2012,"Loved the catering service from this location earlier this week. I was looking for something different to take lunch to a favorite client to thank them for their business. I ordered the Friends and Family Party Pack off the catering menu.  It was recommended for 8-10 people. First of all, the food was fresh and hot when I came to pick it up. Second, the portions were more than generous. I probably could have fed 4-6 more people with this order. My only suggestion is to add serving utensils and paper plates. Neither was included with the order, so I was a little short when I set up the lunch for the client. My client loved being treated and I was a hero because the food appealed to everyone!"
Pete M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,18,,2.0,9/15/2013,"SLOW.  Second time visit.  Even after calling-ahead 75 minutes ahead-of-time, we waited 40 more minutes to get seated (party of six).  Then the six of us were seated at a table for four with 6-inch side flaps up.  A bit ridiculous, in my opinion, given the amount of time waiting for a table.  We were hungry so we made it work.  It took an hour to get our food, despite no special orders.  (They were slow on our previous visit as well.)  I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi.  It was good but the portion was small.  All-in-all I'd return with friends but not my first choice."
Monica C.,"San Antonio, TX",11,17,4,5.0,4/23/2013,By far the best BJs in SA. I've been to the one on 281 the waiter was good but by far the one on I10 is the best their drinks and bartenders are the best. The coconut drink i had was sooooooo good it was like drinking a coconut drink be careful :)
Jason R.,"Cedar Park, TX",45,14,1,4.0,10/17/2012,I always like coming here. The lunch salad is always a good portion.  I've kind of tunnel visioned myself between the Crispy Honey Chicken Salad and the Fried Chicken Sandwich... Both are stellar.  I'm not even sure if they serve anything else other than Pizookies. :-)
Sarah K.,"Austin, TX",0,21,1,3.0,6/6/2014,"I have eaten here before and been more than pleased. However yesterday I came in here and experienced several of their wait staff not doing too good on the customer service. Delivering food with no utensils, twice. Then another member of the staff delivered my food and another member of our party's food with out asking who's it was and attempting to serve it and instead silently placed it in the middle of the table and walked away. Just wasn't the best experience that I've had here or the friendliest staff either. And I love the food at BJ's, that's why I still gave them a 3 Star Score. I tried the tomato and mozzarella salad, as well as, the spinach and artichoke stuffed mushrooms with lemon aioli off the tiny bites menu for the first time. Both were amazing and I highly recommend them."
Elisa S.,"San Antonio, TX",1,9,2,4.0,3/8/2014,"We had a group of 10 and they were able to accommodate us through a reservation. We ordered the lettuce wraps and corn fritters that were delicious.  The corn fritters hit the spot.  For dinner, I ordered the turkey burger with no buns, side of pico de gallo and guacamole.  My turkey burger was cooked as I requested.  Our waitress provided great customer service and was attentive to our big group at all times.  We skipped the dessert."
Joe G.,"San Antonio, TX",1,4,,3.0,5/4/2014,"The menu has changed with fewer options which is disappointing since that was one of the main reasons my wife and I frequented this restaurant. Also the portions served, while adequate, are not nearly the size they once were. Yet, the prices have remained the same."
Jenna L.,"San Antonio, TX",41,19,16,5.0,3/24/2011,"Came here for my birthday. Pretty good service, excellent food. Appetizers and all. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken... Excellent!! I need to go back soon!"
Marie E.,"San Antonio, TX",26,70,,2.0,9/28/2013,"Server didn't smile when she greeted us. Seemed like she didn't want to be there. Also seems like she hated kids. Perhaps she shouldn't be waiting tables at 5pm if she doesn't like kids. Had a tough time finding something to eat for our son with food allergies..,server seemed irritated that it took so long. Brought my husband's order 5 minutes after everyone else's order. Mine came out wrong, and by the time they brought out a corrected one, everyone else at the table was done eating. This was a shame. I like BJ's, but the service at this location leaves a lot to be desired."
