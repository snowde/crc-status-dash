James V.,"Martinez, GA",5,42,5,4.0,10/6/2011,Nice atmosphere and good food. had the salmon for lunch and it was excellent.
t o.,"San Antonio, TX",0,43,2,2.0,8/27/2011,"Went to BJ's twice and both experiences were just ok. Food is way overpriced for the quality and quantity. Had the worst flatbread pizza ever for lunch. It was served cold and the sauce had no flavor. Had it w/ a side of lettuce only but the dressing was good. 2nd time had open faced pot roast sandwich. The mashed potates had flavor, pot roast was tender, but carrots were hard and bread on bottom was soggy. Boyfriend's spicy cajun pasta was horrible! Had no flavor, chicken was dry and sauce was not spicy at all. They have a good beer selection and would probably only return for happy hour prices on drinks. Server walked by my empty glass of water many times. Young servers that weren't the best. Nice ambiance w/ dark wood and lots of big TV's. Not the best, but not the worst."
Linda L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,7,,5.0,10/11/2013,"Recently enjoyed a delicious dinner at BJ's at the Rim with my daughter. I ordered the small bites Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and a personal BJ's Favorite pizza. Everything was so good! Our waitress, Liz, was super friendly and funny. The manager was very solicitous and let us know of the slight delay in the kitchen (it was crazy busy for a Tuesday evening). Further, both Liz and the manager helped my daughter decide on a beer to accompany her pizza, giving her a taste of her top two choices. We also took a pizookie dessert to go, which was just right for two! My leftover pizza was almost better the next day! I can't wait until we have another occasion to visit BJ's!"

Julie A.,"Bryan, TX",0,15,9,1.0,11/18/2012,The Rim location served me their Blond Shrimp with a side of coleslaw and potatoes. The Blond shrimp was over fried and browned with a very bad aftertaste. Their side of cole slaw was so tiny that it was barely two bites. It was so cold inside the restaurant that I had to put my leather jacket on. I went to the ladies room where the ladies and young girls were complaining about how cold it was. A cold front had come through and this management was too cheap to turn on some heat. I will never go back.
Sarah D.,"Castle Hills, TX",1,29,,4.0,11/2/2012,"Went to BJ's with my husband and some friends. They have a gluten free menu, which really helped one of my buddies (he has celiac disease), and they had a decent happy hour menu. We enjoyed our food and our beer. No complaint really."
Matt R.,"Rocksprings, TX",2,8,,5.0,1/9/2013,"How can you not like BJ's.  There menu is eclectic, with: seasonal items, classics, unique chef inspired creations and they have pricey and cheap items for all budgets.  Also, they have a LARGE selection of hand crafted beers and even their own Root Beer.  Every thing has that extra little touch instead of the same ol' thing you get at most places.  You can tell they're really shooting for something great.  Perfect!"
