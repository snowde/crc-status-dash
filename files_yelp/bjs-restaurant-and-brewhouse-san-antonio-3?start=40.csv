Danielle W.,"San Antonio, TX",26,10,,5.0,3/4/2017,Jeremy was so nice and very attentive. 5 stars to HIM for putting up w/ all our strange requests + eating preferences. Hopefully you have a chance to have him as your waiter!
Jasmine B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,20,51,4.0,7/31/2016,"Came for an early dinner with my bf. Place was pretty packed. The food was good, I'm giving four stars because I wasn't thrilled with the service.      I ordered the bbq chicken salad and my bf ordered the grilled salmon with couscous. My salad was soggy and just didn't look appealing for the price. I reordered and got the bacon mac and cheese. This was a much better entree and it felt rich and creamy, but not something I would order again, though I'm sure people that enjoy cheesy pastas in general would like this dish.     My bf's salmon - AMAZING. Perfectly cooked, the couscous was delicious. It was a beautiful looking plate. I would definitely order that next time.  For dessert we decided to be adventurous and got the sampling of three mini pizookies. They were cute and delicious and hot with ice cream on top of each. So decadent. The chocolate one- delicious but a lot of chocolate (chocolate cookie with chocolate ice cream), so be prepared. The peanut butter cookie one- tasted good, especially if you like peanut butter desserts already. The salted caramel one was my favorite by far. I recommend that one for sure.  Overall a good experience. The waitress seemed annoyed when I returned the salad, and she didn't really check on us too much after that. But the food was delicious, ambience was fun. The appetizers people were ordering around us looked delicious. I would go back here and try some of the other items I saw!"
Ashley L.,"San Antonio, TX",48,1,,5.0,2/18/2017,"Great food and even better service! Our server Orlando was top notch! Great recommendations...Orlando knows the menu well and is quick to take orders, bring refills and help when needed. Thank you Orlando!"
Sandra R.,"Helotes, TX",1,12,10,5.0,10/15/2016,Good service. Many choices to choose from in the menu. Been there a few times and all the family has enjoyed their meal.
Steve B.,"Boerne, TX",0,11,,4.0,8/12/2016,"I've been a fan of BJ's for years. I've always loved the grilled fish tacos.  A while back I had some that weren't so great, (too much slaw vs fish and cold).   After hearing word of my disappointment , the restaurant manager (Matt) went out of his way to make sure I returned for another plate.  I did return at a later date and the tacos were better.  The waitress (Hillary) was very friendly and attentive too. She suggested I try one grilled and one fried.   She also returned to make sure they were good and which one I preferred.   (I had never mentioned my previous trip.)  The fried tacos were better I believe, the fish is tastier and they also stay hot longer.   BJ's is always a fun place to go.  Lots of TVs, full bar, pizza and burgers for the kids, and a flexible menu for those with dietary restrictions.   Also just a nice place to go have a beer.  I'll be back soon!"
Jeremy R.,"Odessa, TX",1,26,53,5.0,7/2/2016,Everything from walking in to end of our meal was great. The food is excellent and the beer is awesome! Try the Double stout! Atmosphere is relaxed.
Anita C.,"Kerrville, TX",0,20,,5.0,1/23/2017,"Last week I tried the ""SPICY PEANUT CHICKEN WITH SOBA NOODLES"". Outstanding!  It's my new favorite item on their wonderful menu. No matter what city I am in, BJ's never disappoints. Also, great service from the young man with the fun hair cut."
Vincent G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,5,3.0,4/2/2015,New happy hour is terrible compared to the old one happy hour.  Use to love coming to BJs for happy hour based on the menu options and the quality of food. New menu will not be bringing me back.
Christine D.,"San Antonio, TX",6,4,,5.0,5/13/2017,"My husband and I went for our anniversary dinner last night. It was awesome! We had a short wait, they text you when your table is ready. The staff was very pleasant. Our server, Ivy, was great! Our food came out really fast and it was so delicious. Looking forward to our next date night!"
Amber S.,"San Antonio, TX",14,124,49,4.0,1/21/2016,"The service here is hit and miss. Sometimes you get good service, sometimes it's mediocre, and other times it's it just plain horrid. On the off chance you do happen to get good service, don't expect a winning personality from any of the servers. They will be nice. They will smile (sort of) and they will probably get your order right. I am not sure why but a lot of places are like this now. Kind of robotic in a way. They also enjoy standing around talking to one another... A LOT. But if you are there with people you enjoy being around you don't need a server that does anything other than just his/her job.  The food is excellent. Pricey, but excellent. It probably doesn't matter what you order, it's going to be good. This is what the 4 stars are for. JUST EXCELLENT FOOD.  Now onto the drinks. TIP: Whatever you do, if you like beer, and they have a HUGE selection of beer.... DO NOT ASK YOUR SERVER TO RECOMMEND ANYTHING!! I am quite sure these guys do not drink beer, ever. And if they do they obviously don't have taste buds. If you feel the urge to try a new beer just close your eyes, point, and hope for the best. Your chances are probably just as good if not better. (I think they recommend all the stuff they don't normally sell just to get rid of it.) DEFINITELY DO order the Pink Cadillac or the mojitos, any flavor mojito. If you are looking to drink casually get a mojito. If you are looking to feel really good off of just 2 drinks, get the Pink Cadillac. You will not be disappointed at all. And they taste fantastic."
Mónica S.,"San Antonio, TX",35,9,16,2.0,5/29/2016,"Excellent food, great atmosphere, friendly staff. But our waitress totally neglected us today! Didn't bring sugar and glasses of water. Had to ask busboy for it. Took forever to come back with appetizers, and when some else brought it, it was with the main meal. She forgot the soup, that supposed to come with the appetizers. Piña Colada tasted like water and rum! But we could not find her to change our drink. We informed to the person who brought the soup about replacing our drink for a Margarita. It never made it to our table! This gave her half our usual 20% tip. I feel sorry for them when they are under staff, but a little communication or I'm sorry would have made a big difference. I still will be back, hopefully some else will take care of us."
Glenn R.,"San Antonio, TX",29,28,,5.0,4/19/2017,Love this place. They have great pizza and ice cold craft beer on tap. This our favorite place to eat.
Kelsey B.,"Boerne, TX",271,7,,5.0,10/14/2016,I had an amazing waiter today for lunch! His name was adrion and he was incredible! Super nice and outgoing. He made the visit enjoyable and was the best waiter I've ever had by far! I recommend sitting in his section every time you come!
Kevin C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,5.0,4/18/2016,"I had an amazing birthday experience here last week.  Everything was great.  My wife and I agree that it was one of our better restaurant experiences in a long time.   The food (I had the baby back ribs; wife had southern fried chicken) was perfect.  It was one of those meals with no talking in between because the food was so good.  The drinks (I had vanilla cream soda followed by an orange cream soda) tasted awesome as well.  It actually created a dilemma for what I'm going to drink next time.  I've always been a handcrafted root beer kind of guy, but those handcrafted cream sodas are some serious competition. And of course, no BJ's trip is complete without those amazing Pizookies, which at this point is even pointless to comment on because we all know they're heaven in a skillet. The best part though? On your birthday, the Pizookie is free! :D The service we received was exceptional.  We had a waitress named Katie who was phenomenal that night.  She was very friendly, talkative, helpful, and we could tell from our arrival that she was going to make sure we left happy.  Needless to say, we were very happy.  It almost felt as if we were getting served by our friend.  I wish everybody who goes to BJ's could get her as their waitress.  She was that awesome. All in all, my family has been going to BJs since 2012 in Las Vegas, but our recent trip made us contemplate why we're not going more often on family nights. 5 stars from this guy!"
Rene C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,,5.0,7/4/2016,Great food.  Always consistent. Big menu with lots to choose from. Wait staff is attentive without being pushy.
Greg H.,"Boerne, TX",33,70,49,4.0,10/21/2015,The food was great and a meal finished off with a pizookie is always a win. Though it did not appear crowded the time to get our food seemed rather long.
Shane P.,"Boerne, TX",316,48,12,5.0,6/2/2015,"I don't always drink beer, but when I do, it's at BJs Brewhouse... The beer is cold and smooth. I love the dark Tatonka Stout, but my limit is 2 or I'm on the floor. My family loves to come here and I too because I don't ever hear any complaining that they don't like such and such food. Everyone gets to enjoy what they like. The calamari is always requested by the kids and I must say, they have some of the best. It's not chewy like some of the other calamari we have ordered, even while traveling to the beach. You'd expect seafood at the beach to be the best... But BJ's calamari is excellent. My wife typically orders the parmesan crusted chicken and likes it so much she sticks with it. I wander around a little from the burgers to the salads with an occasional sharing of a pizza with my teenager. Service is always solid and it's great to be able to call ahead. They have a rewards program as well, so you can get $ off and free pazookies and such. We really enjoy eating there and the staff is attentive to your needs."
Timmy L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",28,4,,5.0,8/19/2016,"My wife and I  recently fine in the restaurant and enjoyed everything. From the atmosphere, the food, and definitely the service.   We had a fantastic pizza and a really great fried mushroom appetizer.  We most definitely will be dining there again soon. I am going to try the beer dinner on Tuesday as trying some of the many different kinds of beer sounds awesome."

James P.,"San Antonio, TX",67,590,413,3.0,7/17/2014,"This is a fun chain that offers a variety of bar food.   The highlight a BJ's is its homemade brews.  They range from a light pilsner to a heavy ale, and everything in between.  It's not the best craft beer, but it's better than mass produced crap available everywhere.  BEER: 4.5 stars. The food here is on par with every other bar & grill.  It's freshly prepared, tasty, and well presented.  The burgers are average to perhaps slightly above average.  The pizza is (for pizza snobs like esposa and I) disappointing: crust is limp, ingredients semi-bland, and sauce tastes prepared rather than freshly made.  FOOD: 3 stars. Service is variable.  We've had great service and we've had mediocre service:  SERVICE: 3 stars. OVERALL: a fun place to enjoy bar food and sports.  Pales in comparison to Cover Three.  Better than others for its beer.  RECOMMENDED."
