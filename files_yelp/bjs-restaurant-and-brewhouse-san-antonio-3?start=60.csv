Allie I.,"San Antonio, TX",17,34,95,4.0,8/12/2014,I've been to this BJ's location several times and I've always received good service and very nice people.  I went with my mom this last time and we had a lovely experience. We both ordered drinks from the bar that we've never tried before and our waitress was very good at giving recommendations and describing the drinks to us. My mom didn't end up liking the drink she originally ordered and our waitress recommended something less sweet and my mom loved it! On top of that she was also kind enough to take the first drink off our tab since my mom didn't even drink it.  We both ordered pasta. I got the angel hair with shrimp and my mom got the shrimp scampi. I ate my entire plate! So good!!! My moms was delicious too!  I like BJ's because it has such a wide variety of food and drink choices!
James H.,"Layton, UT",10,355,138,2.0,2/8/2016,Everything is decent as far as food & drinks go but these restaurants are very poorly managed.  Employees are understaffed and working their asses off. No sign or concern of any form of management.
Sydney Y.,"San Antonio, TX",123,19,6,3.0,4/16/2016,"I've been here probably like 20 times, because of that fact that their pizookie is to die for. Their service is never that great, which is why I give it three stars."
Cj C.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,58,50,4.0,4/3/2016,Service was great and the food was awesome! No complaints on that...just wish they hadn't removed my lunch special from menu i loved that combo.
Hoa H.,"D'Iberville, MS",148,3,,1.0,10/29/2016,"I've never walked out of a restaurant before today. I used to be a server so I understand being busy, but we literally sat at our table for 20+ mins without being greeted. When I got up to ask if someone could help us, all the servers at the host stand just looked at me and continued to talk. If I could give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. This was my first time coming to this restaurant and will be my last. Actually, I will never go to a BJ's ever again."
Melanie T.,"San Antonio, TX",6,33,65,3.0,6/6/2015,"I am a fan of BJ's. The food is tasty!!! There is a wide assortment of alcoholic beverages. The bar area is great for hanging out,  watching a game or unwinding . The clam chowder we perfect and tomato/ mozarella salad hit the spot. Yummy!!"
Steve L.,"San Antonio, TX",26,170,77,4.0,5/19/2015,"Yum. With a gathering of great friends, I completely enjoyed the Mahi-Mahi grilled fish tacos and spinach stuffed mushrooms! Now I'm stuffed! Good service, great atmosphere and tasty food, that's enough for everyone! Steve Bob says, ""check 'em out""!"
Justin D.,"San Antonio, TX",52,6,10,4.0,6/22/2015,One of my favorite places in San Antonio to have beers with friends. They have an awesome selection of fresh made beers. The food is always great. Lots to choose from. Awesome bar area. It's to my home so we go often.
Julieanne M.,"Humble, TX",6,23,1,5.0,2/15/2016,Excellent place to eat. I went here back to back and each time the service was great. Both times there was a wait but it was well worth it. I had the Jambalya on both trips. A++ for taste and quality. I would take both of my waiters back. Thank you BJs for making a former Houstonian feel right at home.
Neil L.,"Winchester, VA",49,42,38,4.0,12/4/2015,"Our server, Edgar, was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and beers. The calimari was excellent and the baked ziti was great. Dining area was very clean also. My only complaint was the dim lighting made it difficult to read the menus. Fabulous dining experience overall."
Walter S.,"San Antonio, TX",308,321,1842,4.0,5/13/2013,"I totally dig and can get behind some BJ's.  We went on a Friday night, around 7:30pm to a, as should be expected, wait.  Half hour projected wait time isn't too bad.  And while we waited they brought around slices of cheese pizza to everyone.  Brilliant Idea!  And deff made the wait fly by, as did the killer drink from the bar.  For real, the bartender brought his A-Game and delivered.   After said wait we were taken to our table and our waiter introduced himself, offered us refills, and got dinner kicked off right.  He knew his menu, he knew his drinks, he knew his specials, and he knew how to treat a table right.  He had no issues with us customizing our orders and the kitchen delivered the food as requested.   Damn, I wish I had left room for dessert, because that pizookie was calling my name, too bad my stomach was yelling ""ENOUGH ALREADY"" as their serving portions are great as well.   Suffice it to say, we will be back.  And I'm super stoked to have this be just a short 5min drive."
Tori F.,"Arlington, TX",0,25,7,5.0,3/14/2016,The service was excellent I was asked if I was a member upon arrival. we were offered a booth in a nice and quiet area with the BEST server we have had in months! so great I would love to come back soon and we hope to have the same great service again!
J_ W.,"Spring, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/14/2016,"The hostess told us it would be 25-30 minutes for a table. After 40 minutes, and no help from the hostess, our party of four left. As we were leaving, we counted five empty tables of four in the adjacent room.  I guess BJs doesn't want our business, so good riddance."
Allison P.,"Waelder, TX",60,48,228,3.0,11/30/2014,BJ's is a great reliable place to go. The drinks are a bit pricey but the ahi poke Appetizer is something I can always rely on.  The drinks are always tasty but the prices keep me at bay. This is one of those chain restaurants you can rely on. it's not cheap but it is very decent. You know what to expect and it's always pretty good. Just a little pricey. I've been to BJ's in California and in Texas and they were both consistent wiith what I would expect from BJ's. Good place to go with the group and just hang out... If you got some money
Christine M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",235,320,53,4.0,7/10/2013,"Great beer selection, tasty food and big bar area that was free of kids (I'm not a kid-hater, just like to eat in peace sometimes). We did have a problem with our appetizer, the southwest eggrolls came out really cold, actually like they were probably frozen.  We told our bartender, and then the manager ordered us new ones and comped them.  Pretty nice gesture to make it right, I'm a fan.   Try the spicy meatball pizza.  Also if you're not in a beer mood, try one of their home-made sodas (like the cherry cream)."
YesPlease O.,"San Antonio, TX",12,29,17,5.0,7/9/2015,"Something for everyone here! From burgers, pasta, comfort food like chicken or jambalaya, or salads and appetizers, they have it all! The alcoholic root beer is amazing and finish off with a pazookie(giant warm cookie with ice cream on top)!!!!!!"
Dawnmarie B.,"San Antonio, TX",11,25,2,4.0,11/1/2014,Despite the very slow servic( 30 minutes to get our entrees) the food was decent and the beer choices left us in a quandry.  I ended up with the berry hard cider which was very light( be careful as you couldn't really tell it was alcoholic ) and the Jeremiah Red went down smoooooth.   But the star today was the corn fritter appetizer. So so good.  As a first time visitor I didn't realize that it is suggested that you order the pizookie with the entree as they are custom made. So we got the begniet  instead. Would have been better with just a drizzle of berry sauce and the ice cream on the side as it got soggy  quick
Amy H.,"San Antonio, TX",3,11,1,5.0,6/28/2016,"the pazookies here are DELISH!! the food is great, the employees are awesome. its a moderate price for an entree and drink. i will def be back again. its a great place to eat here with family and friends. my favorite thing to do is being able to dress up with my friends and coming to eat. thx bjs for being great"
Birgit H.,"San Antonio, TX",20,8,2,5.0,10/24/2015,Enjoyed our lunch today. Service and food was great. Definitely better than some of the other BJ'S I have eaten at. Will dine here again soon.
Mykee O.,"San Antonio, TX",43,36,619,4.0,5/15/2014,Wedge salad and what's funny they don't tell u the main cheese ingredient... And I'm a huge wine and cheese connoisseur.... Garganzola is there secret... Funny how I've asked both locations and they just say cheese.
