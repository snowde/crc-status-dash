Vinny H.,"San Antonio, TX",187,465,127,5.0,6/4/2014,"Good food, and a great beer selection.  I'm hooked on the Abby Normal!!  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I wasn't sure what kind of beer I wanted as they were currently out of my go to.  So the waiter brought me some samples after I told hime what I like.  I landed on the Abby Normal, and loved it.  The food is good and priced just right.  They have some really good happy hour specials and Wine Down Tuesdays!!  Plenty of giant TV's to watch your favorite game on."
Joseph S.,"San Jose, CA",116,1306,2413,4.0,7/21/2014,"The service is great, from the bar to the table, everyone was friendly and accommodating.  Beer selection is great for the guys (and some ladies), cocktail selection is great for the ladies (and some guys). Since it is my friend's party, after two rounds of some pink drinks, it was my turn to buy her a drink, I went to bar and just asked the bartender make me something fruity, bubbly and sweet for my friend. She made a great looking drink that isn't on the menu, my friend loved it, we named it ""The drink without a name"" Great time out for all of us. Highly recommended for group parties."
Vilma H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,13,5,1.0,6/8/2016,Front people are not attentive. I stand there for few minutes and don't even recognize you. She just carry her conversation with another employee. We sat down by the bar...it's open sitting. We waited at least 15 minutes before we were greeted. It wasn't busy at all. Two managers standing close by but didn't notice us. We ordered burgers and the bread and all was so greasy. Definitely will not come back.
Marilyn C.,"San Antonio, TX",8,38,7,4.0,7/29/2015,"Food was good today at lunch and service was good. Only negative was that for $6, I expected more than 1/4"" of soup in the bowl."
K S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,4,5.0,5/6/2016,I have been eating here for over 8 years. The beer collection & the pizzokie is pretty good. The happy hour is awesome & the appetizers are great. BJs brewhouse doesn't disappoint.
John B.,"Vallejo, CA",501,673,437,2.0,1/20/2012,"Stopped by BJ's on my recent visit to San Antonio. I was craving their avocado egg rolls that I had gotten on my last visit to a BJ's years ago, apparently during my non-vegan dark ages. I was saddened to discover that they were pre-made with cream cheese. Oh well, I had walked nearly a mile to get here so I may as well order something. The fried artichokes looked appetizing & were actually pretty good. They tasted a bit too eerily like chicken though.  The bartenders push you to purchase appetizers & entrees like a stripper pushing lap dances in one of those clubs that I have never been too... I ordered a few beers anyways since my walk had made me a bit thirsty. The ""grand crus"" that was suggested to me by the pushy bartender was my least fave as I'm more of a dark beer fan. The Tatonka Stout was much better. The super cute server almost made up for the overall lackluster experience."
Arianna C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,3.0,8/2/2015,"Food was good, service was terrible. Our waiter checked on us once when we were almost finished eating dinner. Silverware could've been cleaner. We won't be going back for a while"
Josie G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,1.0,2/13/2015,"We sat at the bar, the bartenders were rude And not friendly. I have been to the one at Alamo ranch and they have much better staff there. I was disappointed of the low quality at such a high end of town."
Steven V.,"Boerne, TX",0,1,,5.0,5/11/2016,"Great service, great sandwich, Thanks Tyson. Great place to meet for lunch.  Service always fast and delivered with a smile"
Samira T.,"Grand Prairie, TX",42,123,185,5.0,11/17/2013,"The service was awesome. They knew the menu really well. They gave us great suggestions and we loved it. Our appetizer was the avocado egg rolls which were really tasty with the sauce. The salad wedge salad was great. Could have used a little more dressing. They ask you to cut your steak when they bring it to the table to make sure its cooked to your liking. Then the Pizookie for dessert was the bomb. We had the Macadamia Nut, which was fresh out the oven and so delicious! I couldn't finish my steak and potatoes. But everything was wonderful. I am definitely going back again!"
A D.,"San Antonio, TX",14,71,9,1.0,12/13/2014,Not deserving of a star. The plate presentation is poorly executed and comes out not appealingly. The service is mediocre as the staff seems to just do enough to manage a tip. Pricey for the low cost service and food choices. In my opinion this is Ch:/is older brother and I prefer the baby brother vs this. Save money and eat wiser and not with all the pomp and circumstance.
Alecia Y.,"Stafford, TX",3,15,7,2.0,9/1/2013,"Poor service.  Our order was not correct and we got charged for the incorrect item. Never told us how long the wait was for our order to be corrected. The waitress acted clueless about the mistake when she was the one that took our order. We were one of only two tables that she had, so it could not have been too difficult to remember what we ordered. We were done with the food that was initially brought by the time the corrected plate arrived. Food was ok. Will not return."
Melanie J.,"San Antonio, TX",191,324,974,4.0,12/20/2011,"Love coming here because of the huge variety on the the menu.  Even ordering off the appetizer menu is filling.  Love the immenseness of this place and pub like atmosphere.  Lots of brews begging to be tasted.  I try and order something different everytime.  Don't really have a favorite yet, although I was on the sausage flatbread appetizer for awhile.  Even a great variety for the kids menu too!"
Matt S.,"Austin, TX",110,56,7,4.0,4/30/2013,MMMMM I like their food. The service was decent but not stellar (the reason for the loss of a star). I'll be going here again since it is pretty close to my work. I would recommend this place to a friend.
Jennifer S.,"Converse, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/25/2014,"My sister and I came to this location which is kind of sad that my review is one star because this was actually my first time ever eating here. Our waitress was incompetent at best, but it gets worse so we both ordered the burgers with bacon, grilled onions and cheese. My burger was missing the bacon and my sisters was missing the bacon and mushroom she ordered. So then she tells the waitress who had by then brought out her fries that were burnt and had no bacon on them. She told the waitress who after she messed up our orders the waitress then brought out her bacon and mushrooms / onions on the side. We asked to speak to a manager and she huffed as she stomped off. We eventually got to speak to management and normally I leave a tip bad service or not this is where it got incredibly distasteful we asked for the check. Of course the waitress brings it and we are sitting there discussing things and she's eyeballing us. My sister paid and we sat for a bit she didn't leave a tip, and the waitress came by and picked up the check sat down at the table where she was folding napkins or whatever opened the booklet thing and rolled her eyes and huffed again. I ended up tipping her on the way out despite her behavior. Very unprofessional. immature and bad customer service on her part. We won't be back."
Aliyah K.,"San Antonio, TX",244,430,294,4.0,2/11/2013,"We went to the opening of this location a few years back and it was an awesome time.  The pizza is crazy decadent so I was so thrilled when a location made its way down to SA.  Over the years this location has been perfect for a drink and some grub between running fun weekend errands - there are plenty of places at the Rim to shop around at. The service has been good.  Pizzas are consistently tasty and reliable while other dishes should just be avoided.  The place is so big it is almost hard to keep some dishes hot from kitchen to the table and some just don't translate well being prepared on a large scale - like the mushroom small plate appetizer.  The wedge salad is a waste of calories.  The pastas are generally overpriced as dry pasta with peekaboo veggies is a waste.  Most recently I had to send back two glasses of wine - each had started to turn.  Shame on me for ordering a glass of wine at a place known for their beer - and - as the waitress mentioned - one was an $11 glass of wine.  Again, shame on me. Regardless -  Kid's menu with crayons (and well priced 'small plates' that are kid friendly) Lively staff Insane pizza Shopping nearby Plenty of TVs during sports seasons VIA route 97 a step away"
Kathy J.,"San Antonio, TX",2,27,13,3.0,2/17/2016,"This is a good place to go when everything is closed. The food is good but we were freezing with the AC, even the waitress admired it's cold in there. Told a waiter and a waitress to turn the AC temperature up dos us but nothing was changed. My friend had to order a soup because of the cold. We have to rush out when it got too cold. Well, I just wish the staff care about our experience a little more"
Melba T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,34,,2.0,6/17/2014,"Beer was cold.  Not a fan of overly sugary pretentious craft beers though. Don't waste your time with a bison burger.  Poorly constructed burger, too much lettuce, too much onion, greasy bun.  Doesn't come with fries.  Came with some kind of rabbit food/coleslaw concoction that had cumin on it.  Blech. Heard good things about this place, but it's not for us."
Bryana C.,"Fillmore, CA",161,153,24,5.0,9/7/2014,I love this place but it is a place that's from home for me so I really enjoy the California style food with all the avocado people in San Antonio but it's definitely tasty I've never had anything I didn't like off the menu everything's pretty tasty and the hand crafted beers or something to try
Tina E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",114,291,348,4.0,7/30/2013,"We started with the eggrolls and I have to say, I'm not a fan of hot mushy avocado.  My husband said they were better once they cooled down but I didn't try them again.  The burger I had was delicious (and I'm a burger lover and very picky) My husband and I tried a couple of their beers and they were tasty."
