Erica S.,"San Antonio, TX",60,172,438,4.0,8/15/2017,"Somehow I've never been to a BJ's before. I found this place looking on yelp for somewhere on my way home to get ahi poke (I was really craving it). I was really happy with my experience here - I sat at the bar during happy hour. The poke was so fresh and super quick to come out. It had a bunch of different veggies and a great poke sauce. I enjoyed it so much I ordered another togo for lunch the next day. Just under $11, I wish they would discount it a little on their happy hour. I also got a glass of wine that was on happy hour. It's a 7oz pour of Dark Horse for $5. Good deal. The bartender was attentive, quick and friendly to everyone. Just what you want when you're sitting at the bar. I'll definitely be back!  Bonus- they have a lot of lower calorie items on their menu that sound really good. Which is hard to find when dining out."
Kenny P.,"San Antonio, TX",14,25,3,2.0,12/16/2017,"Ordered appetizers and asked to get the appetizer first before entrees. Received the appetizers about 10 minutes later, about 30 seconds before the entrees arrived. They took the entrees back and brought them back well after appetizers were gone. Looks like the food was thrown back in the oven to keep warm?. Everything was well done. Shrimp don't taste good well done. The menu picture of the shrimp, asparagus and penne plate showed about 9 pieces of penne pasta and several more shrimp. My plate arrived with 5 shrimp and boat load of penne pasta, 50 or 70?? People who are watching your carbs... don't order this over priced plate of mostly pasta.  The Arnold Palmer was great!!"
Peter N.,"San Antonio, TX",1,10,1,3.0,10/23/2017,"Used to love BJ's (the restaurant, sicko...), but now everything feels rushed like you're in a chili's.   Really did enjoy the broiled Brussels sprout appetizer that was a feature item. Room was clean.  Service was ok."
John S.,"Ventura, CA",63,456,132,4.0,12/30/2017,"I had the weekend special of the double bone-in pork chop and it was delicious and huge! No skimping around the weekend pork chop special! The wait staff was pretty darn good, the starters came out and the mains came out efficiently and with good timing. I usually like BJs for their happy hour specials and TVs but tonight's dinner with the family was excellent. Place is packed on weekend nights, reservations are good but we were able to get a seat as a walk in party of 5 on a Saturday night, barely."
K H.,"San Antonio, TX",1,20,1,2.0,1/1/2018,First and last time we will visit this restaurant. We had a party of 7 and were seated right away. The table we were given was dirty and crumbs all over the seat - it had been wiped but not very well. Still had dry ketchup and other sticky smears on it. When we told the hostess she gave it a half hearted wipe down and said it was just the granite variations and gave us attitude.  The server was nice enough. Food took a long time to come even though the restaurant was half full. Tells me they don't staff the kitchen appropriately.  Burgers we ordered were good and the fries were really good. One of our party ordered a salad and had to send it back. Lettuce was very soggy and wilted. As if they put dressing on way before bringing it out. Flatbread pizza was not good as well. Crust was chewy instead of crispy that you would expect. Wings were good but unevenly coated in the sauce.
Tanya L.,"San Antonio, TX",189,60,184,5.0,7/19/2017,"I've been here twice and the food and service has impressed me both times, especially since it is a chain! I appreciate the smaller, trendier places to eat, but was pleasantly surprised with BJs. Im not a fan of the menu because it is enormous and I am indecisive but I wouldn't let that affect the stars since That's a personal problem  Lunch was the easiest time to go because the menus is smaller! I ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my friend got the shrimp cous cous - both choices were great!! I went another time and ordered the ahi tuna salad, also can't go wrong there   Make sure to check this place out and don't be intimidated by all the options!"
Ceze V.,"Temple, TX",15,178,45,3.0,10/22/2017,"I love this chain and was expecting a huge wait on a Sunday afternoon, but no. We were very happy to be seated relatively quickly. Our server was attentive, amiable, and knowledgeable about all the specials. We already knew what we wanted and she put our order in really quickly. We were very happy with our service and quality of our meals. This particular location is doing a great job vs others in the Central Texas area I have purveyed.  Keep up the great work."
Lesley S.,"San Antonio, TX",939,1200,1290,4.0,10/1/2016,"BJ's is a place I would frequent when I went to California. Now that I've moved to Texas I've been to the 3 near me as well as one in Austin. BJ's favorite deep dish is my go to pizza with its concoction of meats with olives, tomatoes, onion, bell peppers and mushrooms. I finish it off with their Jeremiah Red beer. BJ's has a large line of their own craft beer. Their Oktoberfest and Hefe is pretty good too.  I like the Nutty Brown if I'm just getting apps because I get way too full.  Other faves:  Watermelon and feta salad. This is I believe seasonal. I like it so much that I sometimes remake it at home however I don't have that honey vinaigrette down pat yet.  Crispy artichokes are by far my favorite app. Artichoke with a lemon is fireworks in your mouth. So much robust flavor  that you don't know what is going on.  Bad dish I've got? Ahi poke.... I actually got it at the other SA location and yes I know 3 years living in Hawaii you can't judge Texas poke. However I'm rating it against the few times I've had it in Texas and it was horrendous. A slab of chunked ahi with nothing on it. I know I'm not on Oahu anymore but places in Houston, Austin, and even Yard House make better poke.  Service is usually good. Busy."
Nicole C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,4,5.0,10/19/2017,Bartender was awesome and very helpful. Happy hour specials are worth wanting to be a regular
Terri E.,"San Antonio, TX",94,119,37,3.0,5/4/2016,"My son and I just ate here today for the first time for lunch.  Was seated quickly, was not too crowded for lunch. People here and there.  I ordered the grill cheese sandwich and tomato soup. My son ordered their bison burger which he enjoyed. The tomato soup came out before my sandwich. I was expecting it to come out with my grilled cheese. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said oh sorry. That's it. (the proper thing for him to have done is brought out another hot soup with the sandwich) I don't know about you but, I like to eat my grilled cheese sandwich with the tomato soup and not as a appetizer.  We waited quite a while for our meals. My grilled cheese was not hot. It was warm same with the fries. I mentioned to the waiter and he said he could reheat it but, I never send any food back in fear of someone doing something to it in the back. So I ate half of the sandwich and gave the other half to my son.  I feel they are quite pricey for what you get. The Pizzas are super expensive and that is what the waiter said is their signature dish.  Not sure if I will go back."
Tiffani D.,"San Antonio, TX",87,64,73,4.0,5/4/2017,"Haven't been in a while love the new menu better selection on food ,apps,ext.... they have half price wine Tuesdays which is a plus for sure . Always clean and very friendly staff .... also don't forget to download their app on iTunes you can order , make reservations ext on the app plus you get deals offered on there as well....."
Eric B.,"San Antonio, TX",31,300,197,4.0,5/12/2016,"The place is ALWAYS Packed and for good reason... the food is good.  Just make sure you have time to sit and eat.  We had to rush as we stopped in for dinner and hour and a half before a movie... needless to say, we should have planned two hours.   Excellent Food... something for everyone and don't forget desert!! :)"
Bob T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,3,2.0,12/8/2017,First let me say I have been a fan of this place with no less than bi weekly visits for the last 5 years. I love the waitstaff there they make the place work. That being said the last few visits will be my last due to the fact that they are misrepresenting there value . The happy hour specials are smoking mirrors I ordered there JN burger what the fail to tell you is that the burger on the happy our is 1/2 the patty you get when you order it on the regular menu I brought that to their attention also the sliders are a patty cut in 1/4 that's not a true slider . It side be 4 -2 oz patties again smoking mirrors. In short if your going to offer happy hour specials don't advertise at the normal menu items for a better price then cut back on the portions that is misleading the customers. By the way when I brought this up the manager never even came to the table . To many other places to get treated better especially after being a loyal customer for years
Gibbie D.,"Schertz, TX",0,4,1,5.0,6/22/2017,We always go to get dinner over there and we love fried calamari. That appetizer is the best. We have tried calamari from many restaurants but you guys 's calamari is the best. We also love steak and pizza   Thanks for a fantastic food and nice service. We will go back
Steve B.,"Spring Branch, TX",303,264,592,4.0,12/3/2015,"It's funny, but  BJ's has become a tradition for my brother and me to buy each other's birthday lunch.  It's one of our few times to get together without wives or kids:) This time, there was a large crowd waiting to get in.  We got in line, and it moved fast - probably about 15 minute wait.  We followed our hostess to the table and were immediately met by our waitress.  She had a very bubbly personality, and when she heard it was my brother's birthday, said she had something special for him (dessert). My brother, being the healthy eater in the family, always gets a salad (and it is a large one).  I go for the French dip sandwich.  Food was delivered quickly and was very tasty and pleasing to the eye. The waitress kept coming by to check on our progress.  I think she was really seeing when it was time to bring him his dessert.  She kept our glasses filled the entire time, and we never wanted for anything. She finally saw we were finished and brought his dessert.  Of course, my brother wanted to share with me, but I said it was all his. Will we return.  For sure.  I may have to start going for something besides our birthdays as it was good food and is easy for us to get to."
Diane M.,"TX, TX",0,3,3,1.0,8/17/2017,"I was here with my husband and our party after our wedding a while back and was terrified to come back after a very disgusting problem with their sourdough bread bowl/soup combo. While I was about to finally finish my ""meal"" (I adored this meal a lot and go there for it!) I noticed dark green mold under my bread and reported to the waiter. The waiter was very unmoved when I told her about the mold- she assumed it was dye until she brought it to the kitchen then the manager who was slightly defensive about how ""this never happens""- eventually  paid for our food.  I'm fine with what happened and it was all sorted out. But by how large the mold under the bread made me feel nervous on how long the other breads been there. It's been months and my whole group of party members are aware when they saw it. It will be a while till I come here. Good thing there's plentiful restaurants out there at least!"
Justin W.,"San Antonio, TX",4,16,,5.0,7/29/2017,"I love this place. The food is great, lots of healthy and delicious choices, great beer selection, and the staff/management are very kind. Great times with some buddies at the bar or with the family."
Tomas K.,"San Antonio, TX",3,11,2,4.0,5/1/2017,The food is 5 stars quality but the price could be better for SA. I really like the Ahi Tuna Salad. Excellent execution of dishes and very sophisticated flavors. Beer taste always good here.
Gary B.,"San Antonio, TX",7,135,161,3.0,9/20/2016,"Not quite a 4. This is one of our default go to places (We are members of their rewards club) when we want to go out for something above a sports bar. Their beer selection is pretty good (not a Yard House by any means) but a nice variety. I especially like their flat bread 'entrées and their take on spring rolls. Their pizza is pretty good, certainly not a Grimaldi's or Dough category but not bad, especially if you are watching a game with a good draft. We were there about a week ago and I had the tortilla soup which didn't set well, but that may have been me. My wife that evening had the clam chowder in the bread bowl and that was great. Overall, pretty consistent service and food."
Madeline T.,"San Antonio, TX",307,1,,5.0,2/14/2017,"My bf and I had a great experience at BJs last Tuesday. Our server, Blake, was very attentive, was super knowledgeable of the entire beer menu and had great recommendations for my dinner (I have annoying dietary restrictions). Will go back 10/10"
Daryl Y.,"San Antonio, TX",70,70,5,5.0,8/11/2016,"This review is more about an employee than the food.    While the food was solid and nobody was left wanting more, the service was Great!!!   Zach took great care of us!!!  His attentiveness and awareness is hard to find today in my opinion.  The fact that my 21 year old son mentioned that was the first time he had ever felt like tipping the server with his own money is a big deal.    Here is the story. My son is profoundly deaf and while far from a disability at times people have a hard time figuring out how to communicate with him or even relate to him for that matter.   At some point during our dinner I guess Zach saw my son looking over his shoulder to watch USA basketball.   Zach took it upon himself to change the TV nearest to us, swinging by casually, tapping my son on the shoulder and pointing at that TV.  All without my awareness or need to translate.   While a little thing - the effort to make that change on the fly and not making a big deal of it meant a great deal to my son!!!    Thank You Zach for your attentiveness and awareness!!!      D."
Kay J.,"San Antonio, TX",569,281,658,5.0,1/19/2016,"We frequent BJ's at least once per month.  The homemade root beer is delicious and not too sweet, the beer selection is vast.  Appetizers are great (favorites: Fried artichokes and chips and salsa), the variety of menu items=huge (favorites: cheeseburger, flatbread pizzas, chicken tacos and crusted Parmesan chicken)!  You definitely need time to ponder over the menu. One thing you don't want to miss is the deep dish pizza!  It's flavorful, thick and loaded! And..... For dessert (you HAVE to save room) - Pizookies!!! A warm soft cookie baked in a tin pan with a heap of ice cream and whipped cream on top (Oreo- my FAV).  ** I'm very allergic to avocado and once they accidentally put it on my sandwich anyway. When I brought it to their attention, they quickly took my sandwich away. The manager came over and apologized profusely. She realized that my family was finished eating by the time my meal came out and apologized again insisting on another meal to go.  She even gave us a gift card for our next visit for the trouble. Now THAT'S customer service!"
Carol F.,"Pensacola, FL",17,44,3,3.0,10/4/2016,"Good food. But the slowest service we've experienced in a long time. It took 15 minutes to get our order taken. And every time our waiter left to get us something, he was gone another 15 minutes. Either they were seriously understaffed for lunch, or he was badly trained. It took over an hour and a half for lunch, and should have taken under an hour. Need to get better service training in place."
Brian K.,"San Antonio, TX",1,43,,5.0,4/22/2017,"BJ's has a LOT going on.  Ridiculous menu, full of stuff, just an absolutely insane amount of choices.  I would hate to be a cook there. I really like their wedge salad, it's crazy creamy bleu cheese goodness.  The pizookies are a ridiculously rich dessert, and very good. Their clam chowder is hearty and good, their other soups are not good, they could definitely use a soup makeover.  Caesar salad is good.  Ribs are good, but of course I recommend going on Thursdays for the Rib specials where they are significantly cheaper.  Service is usually on point.  Prices are okay, but if you are able to take advantages of their M-F specials, or lunch specials you will get more bang for your buck."
Troy T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,8,,5.0,5/19/2017,"Consistantly great food and exceptional service! My wife and I go back not for the food but for the superior customer service we get from Debra. Somehow we miss the two for ones, but we are always welcomed and that friendly face brings us back.  Superior customer service needs to be acknowledged!  Debra rocks you will be blessed to have her"
Craig M.,"San Antonio, TX",13,10,,3.0,3/13/2017,"Long wait time for appetizer and food, long wait time for waiter to check on our table...food was adequate, nothing to get excited about. Price range was a tad high for what was served. Deserved a three...not more, not less."
Joyce F.,"Denver, CO",91,1501,203,5.0,6/27/2016,great experience.  I've been to a few bj's in California but tried this location with a couple other peeps.  plenty of parking and the hostess sat us right away.  our server came and took our drink orders while we decided what to get.  I was craving for the fish and chips which I like with the wedge salad and wedge fries.  there was so much fish I didn't finish my fries.  I tried the Brussels which weren't my thing with the spicy flavor but of course enjoyed my corona!
E. F.,"Bonsall, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/19/2016,"I ate here with a large group, 25+ people. When the staff set up the tables into 1 very long one, they put our party against the wall. The table was so close to the wall that when you were scooted up to the table the back of the chairs still touched the wall. There was no room to maneuver out to get to the restrooms etc. For those of us sitting against the wall it was a solid 5 degrees warmer and uncomfortable. One person in our party is Gluten-free by necessity, not choice. They requested a Gluten Free menu upon entering the restaurant and was told they had to go find one. This never received it and had to look up the GF menu online on a phone, only to see that BJ's Gluten Free options are very few . . . 2 steaks, a few salads and GF pizza. As we were ordering, we were told that one of the pizza ovens was out. Later we found out they were down 2 cooks as well. Our food took forever to come out. Our party had many children. One of the waiters was taking food orders directly from children, not 10 or 12 year olds. She took food orders from 3, 5, and 7 year olds without consulting the parents. The parents had already ordered a pizza for their kids to share, to make dinner not so expensive. The parents ordered the pizza with one waiter, while the waitress took the kids' order without checking with the parents. When the food came out there was a pizza and 3 kids meals, and some upset parents.  All the kids' food came out middle to last of all the orders and missing their sides. My daughter had not been served all her food by the time I finished my meal. Two of the 3 steaks arrived at the table well done rather than medium rare as they had ordered. I ordered a steak and potato and although my steak was cooked properly (unlike the other 2) it was one of the most flavorless cuts of beef I have ever eaten. My husband ordered a burger and found it to be mediocre.  Menus were not removed from the table. Our table was not bussed when plates emptied. Friends in our party had to move the plates to another table so that we had room on the table, or so that empty plates would not fall off the stacks of menus in the middle of the table.  This will be my last visit to BJ's."
Christina R.,"San Antonio, TX",2,16,4,5.0,9/3/2017,"Loved the food, for a responsible price.  The atmosphere and hospitality was great.  Ask for the waiter Ricky, from Brooklyn.  He is fantastic!! We will definitely come back and ask to be seated with Ricky."
Sally L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,40,1,3.0,3/1/2017,"We normally love BJ's.  Ordered through   tonight. Two burgers, with fries and a salad.  All is great, however, gotta say REALLY?  BJs. Come on. $3.50 for a wedge salad and this is what showed up?  Ugh. Never ordering that again. Have a talk with the kitchen.  Portion very small. We planned on splitting. This much iceberg lettuce with a small sprinkle of bacon and tomatoes is laughable."
Debbi D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,7,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Went late on a Sunday night, ordered 2 entrees, 1 house sirloin and 1 parmesean crusted chicken. Server brought out both entrees but steak was under done, we asked to put it back on a few minutes as ordered medium well. Waitress came over to check on us and we told her the steak was undercooked and we were waiting on it to come back. Split the chicken entree while awaiting the steak. Steak never came out. Waitress came to check on us  again and we asked how long for the steak as it had been well over 15 minutes and we were done with the other entree. She checked and came back and said it would be a few minutes. Manager then comes out and says, sorry I dont know what happened but here is your steak. He cut into it and it was more undercooked than the original. I said to forget it and we will pay for the chicken but not the steak. Another server brought us the bill and the manager comped the steak and half the chicken. The issues isnt the mistakes but that no one seemed to care. Manager should have handled more professionally and apologized and brought the check herself and explained. If you dont care then neither  do I and we will not return. We were never rude or unreasonable."
Nichole W.,"Centerville, GA",22,11,7,5.0,8/5/2017,"Great service, large selection of beers, great food and atmosphere.  Everyone was friendly and professional from the time I arrived.  I was sat in a nice and very comfortable booth for two. I am not a huge beer drinker but decided thats what I wanted to try today. They had a nice sampler option to select four beers to try which will be more than enough if you're a lightweight like myself. I recommend the Founders which is a beer and cider if you are also not used to drinking beer. It has the slight bitterness of beer but the sweetness of a cider. The Shandy was second on my list which is a golden beer and lemonade, the third is the Hefeweizen which helps you smoothly exit out of fruity and into the world of beer without a kick in the mouth!  This is smooth, not overwhelming and just right to make the transition. I was not a fan of the Jeremiah Red because it was too bitter for my liking.  As far as the food The golden beet and arugula salad was delicious as was the prime rib. It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. Also, I might add, it was huge and the meal comes with mash potatoes, asparagus and dessert! Very well done.  Prices are also not overwhelmingly expensive ($$).  I will definitely come back to visit."
Venkat G.,"San Antonio, TX",1,14,7,4.0,1/25/2017,Things I would recommend at BJs : Fried artichoke hearts Deep dish pizza Pizooke I have tried the veggie burger here it was alright but not great.
Catherine T.,"San Antonio, TX",1,24,3,4.0,4/14/2017,"Previously visited restaurant out of State. Excellent Customer Service Stone Oak location, great place for friends & family. Plenty of handcrafted beverages and food to choose from, including non-alcoholic bevs."
Molly S.,"Fort Worth, TX",24,84,117,5.0,5/21/2016,BJ's is one of my go to restaurants I always get their pizza and avocado rolls but this time I decided to get the hickory brisket and bacon burger which was delicious!! We went on a Saturday night and were sat right away. All around great restaurant
Dusty A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,94,13,2.0,12/14/2016,"Ewww not a favorite place.  We've been here three times expecting better but service is always very slow and food just has no flavor no matter what is ordered.  Tonight we tried Lemon Thyme Chicken and Pasta with Meatballs.  Food was cold and the chicken way overcooked with gummy rice and burned Brussels sprouts.  Pasta was dry with no sauce and tasteless.  Prices are not low either, we always feel cheated when we leave."
James P.,"San Antonio, TX",10,16,,4.0,6/8/2017,"BJs is one of our favorites. Did not disappoint. Service was excellent. Chowder was warm and tasty. Mediterranean chicken tacos were fresh and flavorful. And, as always, Beer was cold and plentiful."
V S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,27,,2.0,7/29/2017,"The kale salad was delicious except that it's supposed to have cheese. It had, literally, less that a teaspoon of cheese. I wouldn't call that an ingredient! Thought I'd be getting some cheese!"
Khian R.,"Universal City, TX",92,91,235,5.0,7/24/2015,Love the pizookies they are my favorite ! Always happy times when my family and I come to BJS
Miguel B.,"Chicago, IL",11,133,44,5.0,4/25/2016,My review is ONLY for the beer.  My friends and I only had beer.  Our server was very pleasant and courteous.  Their selection should satisfy the pickiest palate.  I had one of their apple ales and I was informed that it was only available in San Antonio.  I wish I remembered the name. Definitely one of my stops when I return to San Antonio.
