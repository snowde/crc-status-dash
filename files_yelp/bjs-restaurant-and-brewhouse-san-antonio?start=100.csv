Tina B.,"San Antonio, TX",223,89,158,5.0,2/7/2014,Nice location...off 281! Service was great & timely! Barbecue chicken pizza deep dish with pineapples was yummy! Black & blue flatbread one if my favs always a good starter! Moroccan spiced salmon was melt in your mouth even though the couscous needed more seasoning in my opinion! We had a nice dinner was too stuffed for dessert!
Tyler M.,"San Antonio, TX",2,6,4,4.0,4/16/2015,Everytime I come the food is great but sometimes my servers are lackluster. Today was especially good however.
Taj C.,"San Antonio, TX",76,75,37,5.0,5/6/2013,"I want to add an update to my previous comments on BJ's. If you read them, you know I was very unhappy with the treatment I received from the manager on shift the evening I went. This follow up post describes how BJ's management made every effort to right a wrong! How awesome is that?!! Too often these days people & business do not hold themselves accountable. I was very happy to see that in this instance BJ's did the right thing! Not only did I post a comment on Yelp!, but I also contacted BJ's directly through their website to make them aware of my experience. Shortly after, I was contacted by Eli, the Operations Manager for BJ's. Eli inquired about my experience & offered his apologies, he strongly, yet politely expressed that the treatment myself & my family received is not representative of the customer service promoted by BJ's. He seemed sincerely concerned that one of his managers would be so rude to any of the patrons. Eli stated that he would be coming to the restaurant to provide this manager with further training in how best to handle the situation I described in my earlier post.  In addition, Eli invited myself & my mother to the restaurant to treat us to lunch as an extension of his apology. My mother & I went for lunch & had a fantastic experience! As I had said in my previous post, I do love the food & the service was fantastic! The Ahi Poke & the Strawberry Patch are to die for!! Thank you Eli! I greatly appreciate your attention to my email :)"
Raven H.,"San Antonio, TX",18,30,5,3.0,2/22/2015,"The food is great, but the service is pretty terrible. I have been here more times than I can count, and have consistently good food, with consistently bad service. The waiters are knowledgeable, but it takes ten minutes to track them down when you need something, then you have to ask multiple times before they remember to get fulfill your request. The fish & chips is my favorite, and their wedge-cut potatoes are superb - ask for the burger sauce to dip! Great atmosphere, but the bad service makes me just want to order take-out so I don't have to leave a shoddy tip and ruin someone else's night."
Matt P.,"San Antonio, TX",2,15,2,5.0,6/30/2015,Love the atmosphere! A bar that maintains a family friendly atmosphere! Their deep dish pizza is delicious and their appetizers are fantastic. Good service and tidy interior!
Tim J.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/14/2014,"Apparently the area manager is new and is a major douchebag.  Its the worldcup and he refuses to allow the local manager to turn on the sound to the game.  If you like sports ignore bjs.  Also if you think the customer should be made feel comfortable, skip bjs.  Apparently this guy is high on his rules, regardless of what is right for the customer Vote with your wallet and skip bjs"
Alethea A.,"San Antonio, TX",279,152,72,2.0,7/17/2013,"My daughter and I stopped in here the other night so we wouldn't be starving during our shopping expedition. We ordered the Chicken Club Flatbread, Chicken Wontons, Corn Fritters and Bruschetta Bites. All of these were appetizers, so we were assuming they wouldn't take too long to get... we were wrong. Nearly 45 minutes after ordering, we received them.  All the appetizers were good and solid, but nothing I would go back there to have. The fritters were disappointing, more like fried hushpuppies with a bacon aioli sauce under them, the sauce was good though. And, they didn't seem to have any corn in them, just on top of them. If I were starving, I would stop in again, BUT, in an area that has so many restaurants, this one will not make my list."
Christina M.,"San Antonio, TX",29,69,,3.0,9/24/2014,"This place has it's ups and downs - I vary between a 3 and 4, and sometimes we walk away thinking it's a 5. Kids love the Pizza, I'm a fan of the salads, Thai Shrimp Wraps and every now and then a Pizookie. The Parmesan Chicken is also consistently good. It's more of a family place for us, but we've been known to grab a seat at the bar before a date night out a the movies. I rate this as my favorite chain restaurant, for sure!"
M T.,"Jupiter, FL",0,64,23,3.0,4/3/2015,Are the fish and chips - Queso with salsa verde. It was decent. Iced tea brewed a little weak. Nice ambiance -
Melissa D.,"San Antonio, TX",89,80,12,3.0,3/27/2013,"In my previous Yelp life, I 5 starred this place.   Since that time I have had 2 visits (out of 5) in which the food was a problem.  1) the margherita pizza was undercooked and  slimy 2) a serious fish taco issue in which the eventual food was overcooked but we were visited 3 times to inform us the dish was being re-made.  The homeade root beer and the Jeremiah Red beer are both amazing! These two drinks will be enough for me to brave a couple more visits... I've loved this chain for a long time and will continue to go, but this needs to stop or we could have a problem."
Brett B.,"Lincoln, NE",99,44,31,4.0,6/14/2011,"""Hand crafted cream soda"". Really, what more needs be said? Since this is a review I'll assume I need to writ e a bit more than that.  No problem. First, since BJ's is a chain this review is about my experiences with the whole chain as opposed to just one restaurant. I first dined at this brew house in Oxnard, California in 2003 and have been a patron at several others in the years since. Being a chain the experience is almost always the same, which is to say really good. I keep going back so it must have something to offer. I'm not much of a beer drinker so the appeal for me is the menu. From their pizza to their gourmet burgers, BJ's offers a very expansive menu that's sure to offer a little something for everyone.  For me my favorite is the French Dip. The au jus is pretty good, could use a kick up in intensity but what sells me is the horse radish. Flavorful without causing tears. Just the way I like it. As for the side, you can't go wrong with the skinny, thin cut fries. Crisped to perfection. Another thing I like about the BJ's chain is the locations themselves. Always roomy with high ceilings they are able to put a lot of people in one place without it feeling too crowed. Plus they always have a vast assortment of HD screens dialed into any number of sports. That always works for me. And oh yeah, about that cream soda. Don't think about it, just order it. Unless you're looking for something with a little more kick. Then I recommend The Captain's Mug, detailed in their menu as ""Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum, Root Beer Schnapps and BJ's handcrafted root beer"", it too is fantastic."
Justin W.,"Universal City, TX",0,22,15,5.0,5/17/2015,Came here on Mother's Day with my wife and 4 month old. They were very accommodating with our son and helped set up a sling for our baby's car seat! Excellent service and excellent food. This is the way a restaurant should run! Even though they were busy food came out fast and this time my wife got the bread bowl soup and loved it! I had gotten one of there flat bread pizzas and was very impressed with the quality and taste of the ingredients. The manager of the restaurant even had time to go around and ask how things were going. She was very sincere and made me feel that this restaurant was just an extension of our home! Not to mention they also have there own house beers on tap! We recommend to all!!!
Brandy W.,"San Antonio, TX",103,1,,5.0,3/11/2016,Audrey was an amazing server! She was a breath of fresh air!! Service was prompt and food was delicious!!
Marisol M.,"San Antonio, TX",248,107,45,4.0,11/1/2012,Three words.  Irish.  Root.  Beer.  You must try it. The food is pretty good.  I adore the smaller plates and the access to a gluten free menu.
Chris V.,"San Antonio, TX",25,24,,3.0,10/29/2013,"My second time at this establishment. Service was okay. Really nice staff but a little slow.  Had the jambalaya but asked to substitute steamed veggies for the rice. This substitute seemed to make the overall portion smaller. I actually left hungry, which is unusual in today's restaurant world. I will say, the chicken, shrimp, and sausage were seasoned really well.  The rest of the family enjoyed their food. Again, the adult portions were a little smaller than expected. Kids' dishes were good (taste and portion side)."
Liza J.,"San Antonio, TX",3,23,8,1.0,9/10/2014,"My party was served by a trainee tonight, alone. He brought us the wrong pizza the first time, we corrected our order, and AGAIN were brought out a wrong pizza. The manager came to ask how we were doing and he offered to replace the pizza but after being there for over 45 minutes, we gave in and ate the pizza anyways. He comped us on a free soup/salad but my party wasn't really interested much. Then, we ordered a fresh mozzarella and tomato salad to-go and it has no dressing. What? How? But that's the best part!!! So disappointed in the service."
Kim C.,"San Antonio, TX",50,140,12,3.0,11/18/2012,"I'm not a big fan of chains or bar food, but whenever I'm having the craving for something really bad for you, BJs will come to mind (and also because it's close to the house).   My husband and I will only go to BJs if we can make it for happy hour.  I enjoy the half-priced apps and $5 mini pizzas.  The only thing I can really rave about are the avocado egg rolls and the spinach artichoke dip.  Everything else is meh...."
Amber S.,"Sugar Land, TX",244,311,44,5.0,7/10/2012,"We went to BJ's for a late dinner last night. We requested a booth so the hostess asked if it was okay if she sat us in the bar area, which we had no problem with. Our server, Claudia, was AWESOME. We got some of the best customer service we've ever had. She was very receptive in refilling our drinks and getting us exactly what we wanted in a timely manner. We ended up getting the bang for our buck since it was happy hour. We both got mini pizzas (half off) and had the southwestern egg rolls (half off) as an appetizer. I got the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza and Mr. S got a custom made one with wheat crust, pineapples and grilled chicken. I was a HUGE fan of my pizza. I usually get the buffalo chicken pizza but this was my first time getting the flatbread. Mr. S was not a huge fan of the cheesiness of this pizza, but as a cheese lover, I thought his looked awesome.  We ended up getting a chocolate pazookie for dessert, which was awesome as usual. This meal only costed us $30 (with both of us getting soft drinks)!"
Tomas S.,"San Antonio, TX",81,136,78,3.0,7/22/2014,Here's why I love this place: It stays open really late so if I have to take a late dinner its the best place to do so. They have a huge menu so if you dont feel like american you can do bbq or itailian or gumbo. Its a huge menu with nightly bar specials and yummy desserts. Join their rewards program if you eat here a lot. The food isnt award winning but you will enjoy majority of it except their wings. The wings are frozen not fresh so they will come out soggy. I recommend their salads.
Chris G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,67,,1.0,1/1/2015,"Ate here 12/30 at abt 6pm in the bar section,,,hostess was pissed abt her life.  I sat in a small booth and a waitress came to take my order,, i askd for water to start.  I asked her if the food was fresh or frozen,,,she did not want to answer...i dropped it.  I ordered the tortilla soup, small feta/watermelon salad, mahi mahi and scallops.  I also askd for an extra bread wedge. Waitress never came back to take my drik order...so i just drank water (at a brewhouse),,soup came first-tasted from a can (was able to get a taste from my fork-server never gave spoon) so, i just stared at it. Meal came out..mahi was over-cooked, asparagus was under-cooked, scallops were penny-size, waiter forgot bread. The bill came and i was over-charged for a side that was included in the entree.  Thats when i asked for the mgr,, he came by and compd the meal.  I was not going to complain abt the meal,,,but, when I saw the bill was screwd up, that put me over.  He then said the gm would call me at ten AM the next day.  I gave the mgr my number...no phone call yesterday."
