Bill R.,"San Antonio, TX",10,138,6,4.0,6/18/2014,Wife and I enjoy lunch here once a week. We enjoy the consistency of food and service. Love the clam chowder and half price wine on Tuesdays.
Glen C.,"Seattle, WA",180,32,7,3.0,6/27/2012,The tomato bisque was decadent and utterly superb. I would go back again just for this. The service was appalling. I've never been when I didn't have some sort of problem with the wait staff. I would put up with that again for the tomato bisque.
Sheila B.,"Dorchester, MA",103,171,27,4.0,1/1/2013,"For a chain place they have a great selection of food, beer, and the pazookie dessert WOW.. what's even better is that they give a portion of the proceeds from the Pazookie to CF foundation, which I support. I have been to this place twice now and I reccomend it. good food, nice atmosphere and good for kids."
Dustin W.,"Bulverde, TX",1,7,8,5.0,10/18/2014,If you want great appetizers and pizza this is the place!! The crust on their pizzas is amazing! The only thing better than their pizza is their drink selection!! Great variety of draft beers and delicious mixed drinks for the ladies... plenty of tv 's if you want to catch a game and the management is very engaging with their customers. ... the only other place that has pizza as good as this place is the mellow mushroom..
Jessie A.,"San Antonio, TX",3,5,,5.0,10/14/2014,They have absolutely amazing food here and a great atmosphere! The servers are all delightful and always willing to get you exactly what you want!
Angela F.,"San Antonio, TX",493,464,1669,4.0,3/5/2010,"I'm a bar fly at BJ's. Have never sat IN the restaurant and never will...too many kids!! I'm a huge fan of their brews - my fav is the Jeremiah Red and the Pale Ale. If you prefer a lighter beer, the hefeweisen is decent and very drinkable.  Their happy hour prices are fantastic (weekdays til 7pm) and I looove the mini veggie pizza (only $5 on happy hour!). I've had other apps there that I wasn't impressed with. One being the spinach artichoke dip. Their wings are pretty dang good.  The bartenders always take great care of us [could be because my friend I go with all the time supposedly looks like a chick who works there. We don't see the resembelence]. Our food is always delivered quickly and is consistently good. Great place for happy hour! Good home brews and great pizzas at a low price!"
Adriana T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,6,2.0,8/19/2012,"The BJ's Favorite pizza was nothing more than cheese bread with toppings. Also, the only thing deep dish about this pizza was the pan. The Chocolate Chip Pizookie was delicious and definitely saved the meal."
Kelli B.,"Houston, TX",0,33,8,5.0,8/19/2014,"I love this place. Food is always great. I sat at the bar. Bar staff was nice and attentive. I started with a Jerry burst. It is a combo of the Jeremiah red and the berry burst cider.  Yum! It takes the bitter out of the beer and cuts back on the sweetness of a cider. I had the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. They have the best of any I have tried. I got the Mediterranean chicken pita for dinner. It is light and refreshing yet still satisfying. I could only eat 1 of the tacos. Too full for dessert, I just got their root beer to go. Root beer out of a tap is better than any bottle. It was creamy and hit the spot."
Amber G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,5.0,11/18/2014,"I have yet to have a bad experience at this location. Service is fantastic, food is great, beer is better. A+++"
Adam G.,"San Antonio, TX",250,259,349,5.0,11/28/2009,"As everyone knows, i am a strong proponent of BJ's worldwide. Restaurants, brew houses or otherwise, so I was ""very excite"" to come out to Stone Oak and check out the new pub that will be built out at Alamo Ranch, close enough to me that I could stumble home if need be. It was a long drive but what the hell. I got the time.  From the outside it looks like a Ruby Tuesdays. From the inside it looks like a pair of Ruby Slippers. (that one was for you Monte Vista)  An assortment of 7 concurrent in house brews and 1 seasonal brew to accompany their fine selection of commercial taps.  A  ubiquitous warehouse decor permeating the hip trendy pub landscape these days with exposed painted air ducts and simulated glass garage doors complete with operational tracts for lifting and lowering. I don't know if they are functional but they sure are eye catching. Leather parabolic booths, half booths, pub tables and a crescent shaped bar accommodate any and all who have come for the deep dish pizza or the hand crafted brews. LCD TVs are strategically placed at all angles to divert the attentions of disinterested family members forced to sit at a table swamped with inane holiday banter or worse yet, no conversation at all.  Black Angus sliders served on buttery soft brioche buns with miniature tomato slices, pickles and lettuce on the side. Savory, meaty and perfect with the seasonally spiced pumpkin ale. Fiery roasted salsa served with tri colored chips for dipping was a nice compliment for the nutty BJ blonde. And when I say nutty i mean a handful of hazelnuts nutty.  For dessert I had the rich roasted coffee and chocolate scented Tatonka Stout with a creamy frothy head. It was nice to sip that while watching the ladies devour the homemade, fresh baked, triple chocolate pizzoni cookie topped with chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup.  I wonder if the dishwashers have any idea that these dessert cookie platters even exist. After encountering countless empty miniature pizza tins with no more than an occasional chocolate streak running across the bottoms, I'm sure they have grown curious as to what could have possibly existed within those circular borders  Good luck fellas. You have a better chance of finding a golden ticket.."
Christine N.,"San Antonio, TX",23,153,88,4.0,4/14/2012,"I'm a fan! I enjoy this place. I love the wide variety of foods they offer and the drinks. Try the rootbeer in a cold mug too! I love getting the half baked potato and soup. A whole potato is huge, so I always go for the half. The mac and cheese is pretty amazing too!"
Jason A.,"Austin, TX",55,41,5,2.0,12/30/2011,"My girlfriend and I shared the Mediterranean Pizza.  The toppings were excellent, but the crust was generic Pizza Hut-type blandness.  It was called deep-dish, but only because the pan it was served in was deep. The crust was quite thin.  Also, serving drinks by gripping the top of the glass is a no-go."
C C.,"Key West, FL",2,15,3,5.0,3/16/2014,"Bj's is great. Their pizza is highly recommended- especially their deep dish sweet pig. Definitely not healthy in the least, but split a small or mini with a friend.  No words to describe the pizooki except for delicious. Also, the strawberry lemonade is fantastic! Never had a problem with service, and I love the decor. You can do casual one day and date night the next.  Also, I've ordered online and picked it up. It's always been exceptionally well prepared. Everyone seems to be on the ball here!"
Kelly W.,"San Antonio, TX",61,84,115,4.0,8/6/2012,BJs sports a great Gluten Free menu....pizza crust rocks.... Really!!!
Rachael R.,"Selma, TX",39,11,,3.0,2/27/2015,"Ahi tuna salad is delicious! And pizookies are chocolatey melty goodness. Service could be better, but large selection of quality food."
Melissa F.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,4.0,9/2/2014,Tonight our server was Matthew and he was great! He knows the menu very well and his recommendations were a huge hit! The Bolognese was perfect and so were the other meals. Some of the plates were licked clean (well some were lol).  In comparison we were here last night and the chicken was burned (chicken tenders from my salad) and the parmesan crusted chicken was heavily battered and tasted like egg. They then brought out the Fish and Chips and even the fish was over cooked.
Phil O.,"Vancouver, WA",60,34,2,3.0,2/26/2014,Slow service on what looks to be a slow evening.  They forgot the salad... fish is very good and is exactly what I imagined... I've seen better performance out of this place in the past.
Ryan M.,"Fayetteville, NC",14,26,22,5.0,3/22/2014,"Love BJ's! I moved out here from California and thought I'd never see another one again, glad I was wrong. Love their food and beers! Great restaurant!"
Kel S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,5,1.0,5/27/2015,"Second time we visited this location and the service is horrible!! We wanted and asked for a booth twice as my hubby has a back implant, both times there was the excuse that the tables were dirty or not ready, yet we passed two and pointed that out.  Next after moving to a booth my husbands mahi mahi came out without sauce or veggies. I asked for a small side of broccoli that I never received .....My son was refilled with water instead of sprite and the list goes on.....We will head over to 54th street next time......"
Brad B.,"San Antonio, TX",12,42,,5.0,8/22/2011,"Five stars for good beer, nice bar and a big TV. And, it's close to home. Always ask what their seasonal beer is. It's not on the menu and the servers sometimes forget to tell you they have them.  Food is great! Avocado egg roll and flat bread pizza appetizers are awesome. My favorite entrees are the turkey burger (one of the best I've ever had), meatloaf sandwich (this is a knife and fork job. Ordering this puts you in the splash zone) and the shrimp tacos for something light. Yes, the pizzas are really good too. Tip - DO NOT order the personal size. It is too small and it ends up being a pan of dough with very little toppings. Order a bigger size and take the rest home. The pizza will turn out much better. Dessert - get the Pazookie sampler.  This is by far my favorite chain restaurant."
