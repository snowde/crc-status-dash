Devin K.,"San Antonio, TX",160,61,,4.0,8/13/2011,Been here many many times and will keep going back! Love Love Love their pizzas and awesome beer selection is very impressive. I love the PM Porter and the Great White Pizza. (nice lil combo I gotta say) If you go to this location they've got Alamo from Real Ale Brewing Co. on tap and its probably one of my favorite local beers. They've got NFL Network too Gents so this is a def. spot to roll into during football season. BJ's is an all in all success and I'd recommend it to anyone passin through or looking for a new hangout.  TIP** if your goin to BJ's on Thurs-Sunday call and make a reservation for party's bigger than 2... it gets slammed and you'll find yourself waiting around for a table for a while. (but service is still good even when they're packed... not to worry)
Oscar S.,"Tracy, CA",41,37,,2.0,4/19/2013,"Food isn't that great, small portions...good beer! I personally think they need to review some of the food line ups and either replace them for try to make them better.."
Gerson R.,"San Diego, CA",16,27,2,5.0,6/8/2011,"I've been to this BJ's 3 times, and I've been to the one at The Rim once, and I've simply indulged with absolutely no problems EVERY SINGLE TIME! I've always hit the booths when I come here. You should too. They're really comfy. BJ's is nicely decorated, and they have TVs all over the place, including big TVs at the bar area. If you didn't know, BJs brews their own beers and root beer. Their beer selection is fantastic, as are all the beers I've tried there. I've had the Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Piranha Pale Ale, Jeremiah Red, and the Tatonka Stout. Those were actually in order from lightest to darkest. I highly recommend the Hefeweizen if you like in between light and dark. The Jeremiah Red is really good too.  On top of having really great beer, this place has the best Spinach and Artichoke dip I've ever had. It's seriously amazing. I pretty much run a train on it every time I come here.  I've only had their pizza, so I can't vouch for their other food, but you MUST try the Great White Pizza. It makes your taste buds scream. This pizza is comprised of rich and creamy Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. It's simply the best pizza they have. I've also had their Buffalo Chicken pizza. If you like Buffalo Wings, you'll love this pizza.  I've never had an issue with the wait staff except for a time the waitress forgot to give us our spinach and artichoke dip before our pizza. The waitress was kind enough to give the dip and a dessert on the house though so I really couldn't complain. Conclusively, this place is a great chain. One of few chains that I would give a highly regarded 5-star Yelp rating. I am definitely going to be back here. Papa Bear. Out."
Vanessa K.,"San Antonio, TX",4,65,,4.0,9/16/2013,"Okay, so the food is about average--I've never had a problem with it and I've been here dozens of times.  But the REAL reason I come?  The pizookie!!! It's just to die for and I try to order a light meal so I can save room for this dessert!  The drinks are made fairly strong--normally.  On one occasion, I believe they actually forgot the alcohol all together in my husbands drink, but quickly corrected this when we brought it to their attention. Waitstaff always seems to be friendly and attentive.  Of COURSE I'll be back!"
Abe C.,"Spring Branch, TX",18,10,4,4.0,1/2/2014,"Great happy hour specials! Their appetizers are really good! Try the Thai wraps or the personal pizzas, the calamari is just ok ."
Kay T.,"San Antonio, TX",1281,645,677,2.0,10/5/2010,"So, I don't typically review chains. But, because of the increasing popularity of this place, and the fact that I seem to frequent it for birthday parties and big gatherings, I feel the need to speak up on my experiences here. I've visited BJ's a number of times, everything from a date to a group of 10+ people. Each time I could sum up the experience in a few words: the beer is great, the food is generally decent (at the very least end your meal with a Pazookie and call it a night) but the service leaves me vowing to never return. I continue to go back because, like I said, BJ's seems to be a frequented spot for birthday parties and groups and I'm not one to miss a party. But, seriously, the service here is just plain bad. Well, when you can get a waiter to pay attention to you, they are friendly and outgoing and helpful, but the norm tends to be that they disappear for long lulls of time in which your drinks empty and your glass just sits on the table waiting to be filled.  Having waited tables in the past, I understand what a hard job it can be. And I can be very understanding of a waiter who is busy with lots of tables in a crowded restaurant. But, at BJ's, I have sat and waited on the server to return while watching him or her stand and chat with coworkers like they're on a break. It's frustrating to know you're paying for a service you aren't getting. And that is how all of my nights at this place have left me feeling: frustrated and thirsty."
ELIAS G.,"San Antonio, TX",13,10,3,5.0,9/24/2013,Great food every time I've been. Menu is extensive so there is something for everyone. Nice selection of brews especially seasonal items. Service has been above par and very clean. Lunch specials are priced very well I honestly don't have any complaints about this place.
George B.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",3,5,2,4.0,8/8/2013,I was looking for a place to enjoy the afternoon and see a golf tournament on TV. I found BJ's and it turned out to be an excellent choice. The Angus sliders were great and they had a good selection of draft beers. I was lucky on my  visit to San Antonio from Los Angeles. The locals told me the food is always good as is the large selection draft beers
Javier B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,31,,2.0,7/19/2010,"This is a tough review to write.  This place has terrific food. A lot of recommendations to give.  First, the deep dish pizza is ridiculously good, although it is a bit expensive.  The veggie burger is great.  The wedge cut fries are equally good.  The beer is fantastic. I'm vegetarian, so my options are limited but the options that are there are great.  Unfortunately, the service is terrible--among the worst I've had.  The waiters and waitresses take an UNBELIEVABLY long time to initially take orders, bring checks, and check up on customers.  I've also had the incorrect order taken a few times. I would definitely recommend getting take-out or sitting at the bar."
JoAnn O.,"Red Rock, TX",0,153,5,1.0,9/3/2013,This review is for the 1604 and 151 location. The service is very bad.  We had a big party and we arrived there before 11:30 on a Friday.  The table they put together for us was too small for our party but they will not add another table so we can all sit comfortable.  They are very short staffed.  After we finally got our food our waiter pretty much disappeared and never did come back to check on us.  They had my order wrong as well.
Jenna A.,"San Antonio, TX",14,41,6,2.0,3/4/2010,"I've been here three times so two stars is not being given lightly. I want to love BJs because I love great ""bar food"" and great drinks, but the operative word is ""great"" and BJ's is nowhere near great. The first time to BJ's, I had the grilled chicken club sandwich. Good concept but the ingredients were not top quality. It was mediocre and flavorless. The second time to BJ's, I tried a calzone. I seriously could have built a tastier calzone with some refrigerated Pilsburry dough and Hormel pepperonis at home. Not good enough. The third time to BJ's, I had the California Burger. For something with green chilies, pepperjack cheese, and chipotle mayo, it dumbfounded me how they made it so tasteless.  I must say, however, that the one really great thing I have had at BJs is their avocado egg rolls. They use perfectly ripened avocados, crispy wonton exterior, and a yummy tamarind dipping sauce. If you must go to BJs, get these. I feel obligated, no matter how revolting, to tell you the reason I will NEVER be returning to BJs again because I am so horrified. It is so disgusting that my husband and I made a pact to never mention it again. But for you, my fellow yelpers, I must tell you what happened. Okay, here it goes...we had the most horrifically snotty-nosed waitress. I am so not kidding when I tell you that she stared straight into my eyes as she took my order as SNOT dripped out of her nose. And she didn't wipe it. Or acknowledge the drip. Or excuse herself. So, let me excuse me as I go barf..."
B M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,1,2.0,10/12/2013,"Wow, what a deal. Anyone ever get the royal run around at BJs? It took 4 hostesses to seat us. What's so hard to understand about we 're 2 of 4 in our group, we need a table for 4? What's so hard to understand about we want a table not a booth? What's so hard to understand about we do not want to sit at the bar? We would've left if we weren't meeting another couple there. I gave the waitress my premier rewards ID number, but I discovered later,  I didn't get credit for my purchase. Bummer! I should not have been surprised because the waitress was too busy talking and not listening. Trying to be polite, and making small talk, we commented: You're having a busy night. Her response: Oh! I just love it when we 're so busy, I make so many new friends. ... Well, looking back you didn't make any new friends here!  As far as the food it was good BJ's is usually always good but they have some real ringers for waitresses and waiters. As far as the waitresses & hostesses we will give them 2 stars, they are out in left field somewhere ;as far as the food 5 stars; but I'm going to mark this thing but 2 stars, maybe someone in the managerial staff will see this. BJ's seems to have the corner own dingbat waitresses and waiters, I've had goofballs like this before, good thing the food is good."
Lee M.,"Houston, TX",0,23,4,5.0,3/25/2013,"Great service, great food, and great beer.  Sweet pig pizza is the best."
Jay T.,"Austin, TX",20,22,,3.0,12/10/2012,"We have gone here a couple of times for the reverse happy hour. Certain appetizers are half off, and drink prices are not terrible. I have found the food to be a tad bit salty for my tastes. Overall it is not a bad stop for some late night food."
Zain B.,"San Antonio, TX",194,97,20,3.0,9/3/2010,"Of course, it's just another corporate chain restaurant, right? Meh, for the most part, yes, but one of the better ones. BJ's falls in to the same catergorey has chilis, applebees, and other finger food restaurants. Though, its's spacious interior, and attractive exterior set it apart from the rest--along with the housemade root beer! This location has a friendly staff, and alot of seating, which really comes in handy over the weekends, when they are swamped with guests! I personally find their Buffalo Chicken Pizza and housemade Root Beer to be a perfect pairing! One of the best pizzas you can get from a chain restaurant. The crust is tasty and fluffy, and doesnt taste like dough, compared to other restaurants.  As for lunch, Im always partial to the fish tacos. They arent the best, but they are pretty good, not gonna lie! AND THE PAZOOKIE!--an oversized cookie, topped with ice cream. Does it get any better? No, it doesnt. One of my favorite desserts, for sure.  Love the vibe of this place, along with the numerous TV's. We visited a bit too often during the World Cup this past summer, each time was a great experience. You can see the TVs from almost any seat in the restaurant. The decor is a mix of a lot of different styles. I've noticed roman columns, along with a ""transformed"" faux-garage as the addition for more seating. BJ's is very eclectic in this aspect, which gives it a well-rounded, relaxed feeling! Nothing is over-done, which makes you feel less bound by a certain ""code of reaction"", if you will. BJ's isnt the best food you can find, especially in this side of town, but they do put up a good fight against the other corporate food service  initiatives. Even though I dont always make it my choice, it's always a consideration. And really, thats a pretty big thing...always in the back of my head.  Good Pizza, Great Root Beer, Nice Atmosphere.  AND TAKE OUT! WOOT"
Robert W.,"San Antonio, TX",11,23,37,4.0,7/22/2010,"Met some friends here late on a Friday. We sat at the bar , so we were seated as soon as we walked in.Started out with the Flatbread Appetizer, We had the Margarita Fresca great choice. For the main meal we split a pizza. The waitress suggested that we could get half one way half another, so we did. We had half Sweet Pig, Half BBQ Chicken. I much preferred the Sweet Pig , not that the Chicken was bad just liked other better. When the pizza showed up i thought that it looked kinda small, it was Deep Dish so ended up being very filling . Overall BJ's was a good time Great friends, service, and food. Thanks Krys don't know how i forgot""The best dish at BJ's is the cookie ice cream dessert. Y-U-M! """
Lynda H.,"San Antonio, TX",16,2,,5.0,10/20/2012,"This place is awesome. A little cold inside, so bring a light jacket or sweater. The pizza is to die for! The service is excellent."
Susan H.,"San Antonio, TX",1,29,5,4.0,7/24/2010,"Fish tacos. Yum. I admit I was so put off the 1st time I got them as they are a freaking fish stick but I found myself craving them so back I went. and again, and again. They are really nice.  Oh and the brownie desert. OMG. Try it. It's fabulous. Seriously."
Wilma D.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",452,419,1367,5.0,4/2/2012,I am the Duchess and dont have a review yet?  Awful of me!  We love BJ's!!  Seating and service is fast.  We order small plates and love them all. Mac and cheese are too die for. My comfort food. I love the gold fish sprinkled on top.  Artichokes are delightful with dipping sauce. Meatballs are flavorful. The mozzarella and tomato salad is our favorite with the balsamic glaze. Mini bruschetta are good as well.  We have tried wontons and like the Thai style but not a favorite.  Drinks are good as well as the ambiance.  We enjoy coming here every time.
John R.,"San Antonio, TX",3,13,1,4.0,8/11/2009,I like this place for a number reasons 1. It is about 2 minutes from my house 2. It is not as bland and boring as other casual dining chains 3. I see the GM walking around every time i go there 4. The food is good for the price and they have a variety of offerings  5. The wait staff has always been pretty good (an accomplishment these days). Drawbacks-Everyone else in stone oak likes this place for its convenience and decent offerings! Turn times are rough and that makes me think twice about going. Oh and the thin crispy fries are my fry krptonite.
