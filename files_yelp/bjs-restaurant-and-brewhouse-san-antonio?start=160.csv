Brian Z.,"San Antonio, TX",61,19,5,3.0,6/26/2009,"BJ's at noon Went to BJ's off of 281 and Stone OakPkwy/TPC Pkwy. While i have been there before many times in California, this was my first time there in Texas.  I must admit that it's not quite the same (even though they are a chain). I would say it's relatively close though.  They are known for their own beer and pizzas. While i didn't have any of these this time, it was nice to see that the options were still there. They have a pretty good lunch menu. Very similar to Applebee's, Chili's, TGIF, etc...  They have  a full bar and a bunch of TV's on sports channels. The building is very modern and everything is open which almost gives is a feel of eating at a cafeteria... but only not!  If you're new to BJ's... try their beer... try their Pizzas... you can't go wrong with either."
Keith A.,"San Antonio, TX",484,93,32,3.0,1/15/2012,"Great selection of beer. Tried the beer sampler.  Atmosphere was a bit standard with tv's, etc but service was excellent.  Slider burgers were good but pretty salty.  Breaded artechoke hearts were...artechoke-y.  Didn't like em. BJ's was good enough to return but I'll try others restaurants in the area first."
Michael J.,"Greenville, SC",148,25,,4.0,10/29/2009,"I have enjoyed eating at BJs several times and have especially enjoyed the beers and appetizer specials that are offered at happy hour.  Not sure why another reviewer claims that they only have their own brews on tap.  Trust me, they carry several other popular brews on tap! My only ""gripe"" about this place is that:1) waits can be long during peak times; and 2) the prices are a bit high.  Nonetheless, this is a great place!"
Shianne K.,"San Antonio, TX",14,141,38,4.0,8/15/2011,"This place does get packed!! I have been there a few times where the food was forgetfull However, most of the time I really enjoy it. I tend to stay away from the sandwiches, because those are so so. The pastas are very good, we had the shrimp scampi and the chicken tascano lime pasta. The chicken was succulent and tender and it was nice and light- not heavy. The great white pizza was absolutely fantastic for a deep dish. It was not drenched in sauce and the flavors worked so well together. We also tried there seared ahi tuna appetizer, it was very small but extremely tasty! it was also only $2.95 so I'm ok with it being small.. I'm always a fan of their beer as well as the Alamo on draft (one of my favorite beers!) Service is usually a little slow, so if you are in a hurry it is probably not a good idea to come here. make sure you order your drinks  a few minutes before you finish your most recent one. The TV's are great if you like watching sports, my husband loved it! Sometimes it is hit or miss here,but a good place to go for a few drinks and good food."
Richard S.,"San Antonio, TX",94,20,,3.0,6/3/2012,The food is usually good and the kids like it. I have to admit that I usually have trouble ordering because nothing really thrills me here.
Jeff Y.,"San Francisco, CA",32,177,2,4.0,6/19/2009,"There's a BJ's in San Antonio!  Albeit, it's pretty far north up 281, it is a Bj's nonetheless. They serve BJ's own brew of beer -- served ice cold -- try a pitcher of the BJ's Blondie if you're not sure, pretty decent deep dish pizzas, and lots of funky fusion foods.  The best fusion is the dessert pizookie.  It's a cookie cooked into a deep dish pizza shape covered with ice cream -- I recommend the macadamia nut. *EDIT: New Discovery!  Try the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps!  Taste good with the Hefweizen!"
Scott R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,38,4,3.0,2/27/2013,"I had a great experience on my first visit (though sticker shock!). Yesterday I returned - my daughters love the avocado spring roll appetizers and wanted me to try them. The rolls were good but not awesome. I remembered the root beer was pretty good last time so I ordered some of that. It was FLAT so I asked the server ""isn't this stuff supposed to be a little carbonated?"" She looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""not really."" So I tried some more but it wasn't right. When the appetizers were brought by another server I asked her about carbonation she said ""yes"" and agreed that it would be gross without bubbles. She took it back. Then our server sheepishly tried to act like it was a misunderstanding. But in fact, she lied and made us feel stupid. We left a tiny tip and even though I understand this was an HR issue, I won't be back after spending $45 for an average lunch and no respect."
Tiffany M.,"Lometa, TX",0,11,,4.0,3/15/2014,"Our Saturday lunch started off really well. We were seated right away and put in our drink order within the first 2 minutes. It went downhill from there. I gave it 4 stars, however, because the food was actually really good. It was the service that ruined our meal. Our server introduce himself by saying he'd only slept 4 hours the previous night, not information we needed to know. He was distracted, never smiled, and was extremely slow. He dropped our pizza on the floor as he was bringing it to the table, which happens and we were understanding, however, when we inquired about the said pizza and what size had been ordered he told us that we were wrong, that we didn't know what we ordered and then proceeded to show us his order pad in further proof that we were wrong.  The manager did give us a small discount on the pizza and offered us free dessert. If we ever go back we will avoid this server at all cost!"
Matt C.,"San Antonio, TX",9,49,91,3.0,8/14/2008,Ok so as much as I'd like to give this place a higher rating I was extremely disappointed by a couple of things.  First off I'm accustom to the Austin location which has a wide variety of beers in addition to their own brews. However the San Antonio location only serves BJs Brews and nothing else.....extremely disappointing!  Also our waitress was very inexperienced with both the menu as well as the beer offerings.  I understand that this place may have only been open for a month however I don't think its unreasonable of me to expect at least the same level of service that BJ's should be known for!!!  My food came out piping hot and was pretty delicious.  My guests were not as thrilled about the place as I told them they would be which is a bit of a disappointment to me considering I know that BJ's can kick butt!!!  I hope that over time this BJ's will train their employees better as well as expand their beer selection.
Lisa R.,"Wyandotte, MI",2,41,1,5.0,11/12/2011,"I had the personal pizza with mushrooms, the meatball appetizer and a side salad with honey mustard and it all tasted great.  The price of the appetizers and food was around $ bucks for lunch, which I thought was a great deal.   My friend had the Avacado Egg Roll, which she also loved.  My other friend had the flatbread pizza with salad for lunch and loved that too."
Annie B.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/23/2010,"We stopped here for a late Sunday lunch; we should have kept on driving.  The food -- chips & salsa, Lettuce Wraps, Turkey Cobb Sandwich, and a Santa Fe Salad -- was mediocre at best.   But the worst came later -- all four of us were sickened by a terrible case of food poisoning that night.  None of us were able to work or resume our regular daily activities for 36 hours.  We reported the incident to BJs corporate office and have received no follow -up other than an automated ""thanks for your email"" response.  We also reported our illness to the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District -- they will be sending out a staff member to inspect  this restaurant and review food handling procedures."
A M.,"San Antonio, TX",25,31,3,1.0,8/27/2012,Lousy service and expensive food/drinks. Definitely not worth the time or expense. Used to be good but gone downhill. Staff needs to relearn what customer service means.
Joy M.,"Mountain View, CA",46,20,,4.0,1/22/2010,"Great restaurant and food are awesome, server are much likable and wonderful for the family and friends to hang out and dine in. The ambiance is also good."
terry w.,"Austin, TX",397,137,90,1.0,12/25/2009,"the food and service here were extremely sloppy! i had the pot roast and my wife had the baked potato with chili. the pot roast was mostly fat, the carrots were uncooked, and both the celery and the onions were untrimmed. who wants to eat onions with the dirt-ridden roots still intact? my wife's baked potato was even worse. the giant potato looked like a pretty regular-sized russet to me. and the heaping ladle of chili? it was only about 1.5oz of liquid sauce speckled with 6-7 bits of ground beef.  our waiter was playing hide and go seek the entire night and only refilled our drinks when he brought us our check. the manager was abruptly intrusive. when he came back to check up on us, he interrupted our conversation by slamming his palms against the edge of the table and asked how we were doing. i later went to the company's website, read their ""our promise"" section and decided to write them about our terrible experience. it's been over a week and they still haven't done any type of follow-up. we ate here as a last resort cause there was too much traffic on 281 for us to drive around looking for food. needless to say, we won't be making the same mistake again."
Jaime G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,17,3,4.0,9/18/2011,I go to BJ's quite often when I am in the area. I have never been dissapointed with any of there meals. The large tv makes even more enjoyable to watch games.
Beer P.,"Asheville, NC",27,15,31,4.0,10/19/2012,"Awesome Oktoberfest (what? those aren't awesome!?) and an IPA that they said had 6 different hops and actually tasted fresh... in San Antonio...kinda, is this Bulverde up here already? Oh, an the Pook's Pilsener- I have had it a few times now and it's always nice; dry and crisp with a substantial malt character that is completely balanced and nuanced by the spicy hops. That beer is one I would buy to take home. Also, the pumpkin ale was one of the best pumpkin ales I have had. Very spicy and kinda heavy/sweet, but overall a very drinkable beer around 5% abv. It's easy to overspice a pumpkin ale, but this one was very smooth and not astringent or ""bitey"" at all. The happy hour in the bar makes it a great time. As long as the Pook's Pils or the Hopstorm IPA is on (or the Oktoberfest) I will keep coming back for the 1/2 price boneless wings... M-F 3-7pm. Great job St. Arnolds for the brewing and right on BJ's for the great customer service and product knowledge. I hope the other locations are just as diligent."
Theresa D.,"Spring Hill, FL",2,20,19,5.0,8/15/2010,"I would rate this a five for a sports bar.  We had a party of 12 and did have a reservation. Our waiter, Shiloh, was AWESOME ... which can be a feat with such a large party.  But he made sure all of our special requests were taken care of spot on.  We had a range of items from the wide variety of choices.  I had fish and shrimp tacos - one of each! Very good! The rest of our party had burgers, shrimp pasta, clam chowder, club sandwich, assorted flatbreads ... And everyone really enjoyed their choice.  I tried the Blonde Beer, and it was nice and smooth ... You may as well give the microbrews a try since that's part of the ambiance. It was a bit noisy ... But it is a sports bar with TVs strategically located.  All in all I thought it was a nice place and Shiloh is a great waiter."
Stephanie S.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,9,,4.0,3/25/2013,"This place is a step above Chili's or Applebee's. Food was good, and we're not easy to please (see my review of 54th Street Grill, which is nearby.) The margarita flatbread and spinach artichoke dip were actually really tasty.  Calamari was just so so, though. Handcrafted Margaritas on the rocks were really, really good (memorably so). Our server, Spencer, was very polite and professional -- not intrusive, just right. He did an excellent job and it made our experience pleasant. The decor is interesting and comfortable. All positives except that the hostess gave me the hairy eyeball and looked me up and down both times we went there, which was weird. This is a tasty place worth spending your pesos at... Two thumbs up!"
Traci D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,2.0,4/29/2012,"Follow up review.  Last couple of times we've eaten at BJs, its been disappointing.  The management seems to be at the center of the problems.  Plus, they have raised their prices and the size of their portions are smaller (i.e. gluten free pizza).  Guess they thought we wouldn't notice."
Breanne S.,"San Antonio, TX",227,97,38,4.0,7/17/2008,"I was lucky enough to be able to attend the soft opening of the first BJ's Brewhouse in SA. The waitstaff was fresh-faced and new, the decor was beautiful and cozy, not yet having scratches on the floor or gum under the tables. The employees were all REALLY great and helpful and seemed happy to be at work... however, I am taking that with a grain of salt, since they've been working there for only a week or so at most. I'll reevaluate the waitstaff in a few months when they've had time to realize how much people can suck when you're serving them (and when they don't have a trainer staring over their shoulder, watching). Right now, though, they are all top notch! Now, if you know anything about me (which you don't), you know that I love me some fish tacos. These were pretty freakin' good, which I was not expecting. Panko-crusted halibut in tortillas that were just thick enough not to bust through, with chipotle mayo and an avo cream sauce and salsa. YUMS. The table next to us ordered a mouth-watering (looking/smelling) deep dish pizza from which I had to restrain myself from yoinking a slice. Our table was generally pleased with what we ordered - my fish tacos were the winner of the flavor contest and a salmon fillet came in second place - and I will definitely go back to try that pizza. From what I understand, the burgers are also great, and they have a dessert called a pizookie (giant hot cookie, ice cream, spoon, mouth...) which I'd like to have a taste of as well. A++, would eat it again!"
