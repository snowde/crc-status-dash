JoAnne B.,"Universal City, TX",0,2,,2.0,11/5/2011,Last night this place was awful. Our service was terrible. The waiter brought the wrong order to someone in our party. He was very late getting the order correct. The bill was incorrect....we were there over 2 hours just to get hamburgers. I hope they improve.
Alyssa C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,5.0,5/16/2011,"Never had a bad meal here. Good food, beer, atmosphere, and pazookies!! Prices are really good too."
Micah C.,"Berkeley, CA",71,1,,4.0,9/7/2008,"Great beer! Good service.  I went there twice, which is a compliment since the first time they screwed up our order pretty well. The reason I'm still impressed with them is they bent over backwards to fix it.  They straightened out the mix up and comp'ed our meal. The waiter did a great job of making sure we were taken care of and happy, despite the mix up.   They also make their own root beer which is delicious. And give them a bonus in my book."
Kent W.,"Austin, TX",1,11,4,5.0,1/31/2012,"Utterly unfamiliar with San Antonio so I couldn't tell you which one we were at, except it was near the Alamo Drafthouse. Honestly from the name we were expecting a Hooter's/Twin Peaks kinda place, and in that respect only was I disappointed. We ordered a mojito and a ""BJ's Irish Root Beer"", which was Jameson's, Bailey's, butterscotch schapps, and their home-brewed root beer. The mojito was good, the Irish Root Beer was fantastic. I drank it too fast, so just had the home-brewed root beer after that, which was every bit as good by itself. The menu was overwhelming; wonderful selection, and it took me a good 20 minutes to narrow down to one dish, and 10 minutes of that was between the jambalaya and the parmesan-crusted chicken. We had the pork chops, and the jambalaya; the pork chops were very good, and the jambalaya was as good as jambalaya gets outside of New Orleans. Hate to gush, but I was VERY impressed with everything we consumed. The service was adequate to good, but the cuisine more than made up for any shortcomings in any other category. I will be back, and very soon."
Ron L.,"Houston, TX",0,145,,4.0,9/12/2010,"We had a really large group on a busy night but with the help of the staff, were able to put some tables together in the bar area and avoid a long wait.  Most of us ordered pizza - they have a ""happy hour"" during football games (basically all day Saturday) with half price mini pizzas.  They were small but very tasty and with some appetizers enough for a meal.  The BJs beer was very good and they also have a really good selection (20+) beers on tap.  Lots of TVs to watch football/sports.  Bar area was large and a lot of fun.  Will defintely return."
Colin S.,"San Antonio, TX",12,21,7,4.0,9/5/2009,"Loved it! I got the Beer taster. My wife got the Tropical mojito. Mine was awesome hers was OK. We both agreed that that the mojito was a little too sweet. Our waitress Helen was a doll, and she gave great suggestions and service throughout our meal. We ordered the Avocado egg rolls which were great until our entree arrived. My wife, who claims she always gets ""Out Whataburgered"" by what ever I order, decided to get the calzone. She said that it was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I ordered the Angus California burger and it was excellent! it had a few different cheeses on it. The bread was similar to Texas toast only better. The Angus was exactly how I ordered it, medium and was plentiful and juicy. My wife agreed that it was one of the best burgers she's tasted as well. After we were thru with our meal, Helen our waitress was right there with our check and just enough smalltalk. I'm sure you've been to restaurants where the wait staff is too chatty. ""Would you like some more soda? Ya know I just can't drink those anymore. They remind me of my step father. He had boundary issues. I'll be right back with your check."" Helen wasn't like that at all and the wife and I had a great night out."
