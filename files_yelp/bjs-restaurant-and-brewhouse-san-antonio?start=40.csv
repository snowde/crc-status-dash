Julie D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,35,14,3.0,12/19/2016,"My husband and I go here for their happy hour. It's not the best happy hour, but their BJ's brand beer is very good, so we'll get that. I wish their happy hour food was better than mediocre."
Sally R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,1.0,6/20/2016,Very disappointed the service was horrible and the food took forever to come out  Will not come back  This place is a joke
Wendy B.,"San Antonio, TX",6,85,31,5.0,1/10/2016,Amazing food and great service!  The manager came by to check on us and refills were fast.  We also saved $10.95 with the coupon here on Yelp!  We will be back soon!  :)
Aly V.,"San Antonio, TX",0,20,1,5.0,3/16/2016,Awesome place. Very clean n comfy.  We went at lunch hour and the food and portions were perfect.  We are definitely coming back!
Texas001 M.,"Spring Branch, TX",7,49,,5.0,10/5/2016,"We have eaten at BJs many times of the past couple of years and were pleased with the food and service most of the time.  Last night we had a real pleasure to be served by a young lady named Jordyn.  She was really knowledgeable about the menu but was really ""on her toes"" with the service provided. It was almost like she could read our minds when we wanted something she appeared as if my magic.  Was so impressed with her I left her double the 20% I normally tip.  Hope she is our waitress next time we go, actually I think I will ask for one of her tables."
Jennifer D.,"San Antonio, TX",42,151,447,4.0,12/21/2014,Yummy lunch with the family after church today.  Soup in a bread bowl hit the spot   I'll be going back for another really soon
Erik G.,"Converse, TX",68,6,,2.0,10/28/2016,This was my first time at this location and it was horrible the service wasn't prompt. I receive my appetizer with my meal after 20minutes. I could tell my appetizer had been sitting there because it was already cold. However the entré was delicious so I would give it 2 stars.
Gil C.,"Spring Branch, TX",172,68,143,4.0,7/31/2016,BJ's is a very nice restaurant and the food and service is great.  Great incentives when using the mobile app.
Jazmyne B.,"San Antonio, TX",39,39,111,4.0,9/28/2015,"My boyfriend and I were driving around the shopping center and debating where to eat. So happy that we chose BJs. We were craving steak and mixed drinks so we were hoping for good service. And indeed we got it, EVERYONE REQUEST Willy Daniels for your server. Best server I've had in San Antonio, extremely nice, knowledgeable of the menu, and really helped us throughout our meal.  My boyfriend ordered the Long Island and i a had the white peach margarita. Personally not my favorite neither myself or my boyfriend could drink it. There was a gracious amount of alcohol in my drink. Don't get me wrong I love alcohol but this drink was 85% of it. I don't know, the peach and alcohol just didn't mix well. I asked Willy if I could try the strawberry margarita instead and he said no problem and gave me a strawberry one instead. The strawberry margarita was delicious, much better choice and our server was super cooperative and polite about it.  I than ordered the broccoli cheddar soup and the steak meal. Everything was delicious.  What made this trip worth coming back was our server, I'm in the food industry myself and I always appreciate great customer service. I'd refer BJs to anyone because my experience was wonderful"
Jodie B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,2,1.0,4/15/2017,"My husband and I for the third time went to this restaurant! It was 4:30 not a busy time the host was complaining and stating they were short handed and out of silverware! We sat down I explained to our server I have allergies I specially asked for the salmon I had the previous time, with nothing but mashed potatoes as a side.  My husband was served his ribs 10 minutes before my meal came out he was eating alone when they brought mine out on a bunch of cooked veggies and mashed potatoes under with some sauce.   In addition there was no seasoning on the salmon.  They took it back and brought out the same piece of salmon now over cooked, and still on top of the vegetables and mashed potatoes.  And that point, I was aggravated, my husband was done eating, and I told the waiter to forget the salmon and just bring me mashed potatoes.  I said forget it, and I asked to talk to manager.  she said she wouldn't charge us for the meal !  She then had the same plate brought out, and said she had the cook re-fire it, FOR THE THIRD TIME!  It was like like a piece of leather, still on top of the veggies and mashed potatoes with the sauce I didn't want.  I didn't touch it and left it on the table.  We still had a bill for $30.00, which we paid because that wasn't the issue.  Horrible experience, I didn't get to eat..., very disatisfied with the service"
Krista G.,"Blanco, TX",84,1,,4.0,9/25/2016,I just had a great dining experience. Valerie was awesome. I had the Texas style chicken fried steak at first. It was a little spicy for my liking. But it was no problem Priscella the manager came out and made sure I got something that I liked and made sure my fiancé had a drink he liked. I ended up with the Atlantic grilled salmon and 3 top shelf Margarita's. Make sure you re willing to pay 10 bucks a piece for those. Overall was good and I would not have even made a review if Valerie and Priscella didn't stand out as the awesome people and servers that they are. Thanks again for a great time and ill be back. Oh and don't forget to try a pazookie they are to die for :) thanks again
Krystal S.,"San Antonio, TX",34,145,19,2.0,12/6/2015,Food is decent but service is HORRIBLE I have never had such bad service. Waiter literally dropped our food off and never came back to check on us or refill our drinks. Didnt even know what seasonal beers they offered!
Tyler T.,"San Antonio, TX",174,7,,4.0,10/4/2016,The beer is better than the food and the food is pretty good! It can be pricey but they have a great happy hour. The service is usually pretty good but no one that's amazed me yet. Overall I enjoy going here.
David S.,"Los Angeles, CA",194,27,37,4.0,11/22/2015,"Good service. Good food. Great desserts :) I love their pizookies (pizza cookies). They have a seasonal pumpkin pizookie and it's amazing. I don't care for pumpkin pie so I was skeptical, but the flavor was excellent."
Roger P.,"Austin, TX",13,20,3,4.0,7/12/2016,"Four stars for wait staff, five stars for beer, two stars for the steaks. Cooked perfectly, however, tougher than an old sneaker. Hey BJ's we're willing to pay a little extra for a tender steak."
Christopher James L.,"College Station, TX",0,2,,5.0,7/31/2016,"The staff at the bar were fantastic and knowledgeable, the FOH manager Priscilla had a great personality and the best presence. I'm so glad we stopped in for a couple beers before we caught a movie. Best date night we've had in a long time. Thank you BJ's"
Scott C.,"Cypress, TX",17,3,,1.0,4/28/2016,"One of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. Avocado egg rolls were cold, one had a finger print very little sauce. Service was terrible no small plates provided, had to wave down a waiter after five minutes of looking for ours. Pizza was terrible as well. Service was slow with  no attention. Will never go back."
Hilda R.,"Converse, TX",0,14,1,1.0,1/28/2017,This restaurant was alright. My boyfriend and I went for his birthday. He enjoyed his meal but I didn't. The pasta wasn't all that great but he enjoyed his burger. I did try some of his fries and they were pretty good. The service wasn't terrible it was good. It's just the food. They have a big menu but their plates are plenty plain.
Jonathan G.,"Edinburg, TX",0,19,13,5.0,10/31/2015,"We love this BJ's- always excellent service and delicious food! This time around, we tried the carnitas fries (I believe that's what they're called) as an appetizer and we absolutely loved them! They were delicious! I will definitely recommend this place!"
Kat S.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,10,4.0,7/13/2016,I've come here a few times and the service was mediocre as well as the hospitality. The food as well. Today was different. Don't mind the PokeGo fanatics out there ( they don't really bother any and I can't complain I stocked up on some balls while here). Upon entering they greeted us kindly and asked if we were rewards members. I said yes and gave them my information. They then welcomed us back and say us. The waitress was great and personable. When I ordered my food I verified there was no mushrooms as I have allergies and she confirmed there wasn't and also said that they had me marked down as having a mushroom allergy on her notes. Something they added to my profile. I was impressed as it made me feel like I was not just another customer. Even if I was but in my head we were friends lol. Anyhow kudos!  Will be back.
