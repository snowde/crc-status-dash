Gina F.,"Munster, IN",31,20,2,4.0,3/24/2016,"Family stopped there in way to JW Marriott Resort.  After a long plane ride, we ordered up a lot for lunch.  Don't miss the potato skins or the tortilla soup.  Lunch special of half sandwich, tortilla soup and tomato and mozzarella salad was  perfect ...lots of yummy flavors!  Excellent service.  Family friendly.  Great price for great food."
Aaron B.,"North Canton, OH",5,64,45,4.0,8/12/2015,"Great food, great beers.  A very cool atmosphere. The staff is the best part. I accidentally slammed their revolving door on my way out and no one got mad."
Lance C.,"San Antonio, TX",1,22,2,3.0,11/11/2015,"We went to BJ's during a very crowded Veteran's Day lunch rush.  They were giving discounts to veterans, and I salute them for that.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  No big deal.  We selected fried calamari as our appetizer.  It came out in about 15 minutes.  Overall the dish was below average -- over breaded and somewhat overcooked.   Did I mention the place was crowded?  We had to wait another 25 minutes for our main dishes.  My entree was the Parmesan crusted chicken, which was pretty good, though it appeared to have spent more than a couple minutes under the heat lamps awaiting the other items on our order.  Anyway, the sauce was quite tasty and the sides were fine.  I wish the chicken had been a little more tender.  It wasn't tough or stringy, but I've had a similar dish from Cheesecake Factory more than once, and I could cut CF's chicken with a fork.  A knife was required here.  My wife said her club sandwich was good.  Our daughters liked the pepperoni pizza from the kids menu.  I sneaked bite and it had good flavor. We will probably give BJs another shot because it's so close to our house; our waitress, though very busy, was fairly nice."
Brooke S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,5.0,12/10/2016,Had Alissa and Brad as bartenders tonight and what an awesome experience!! They are super friendly are amazing people with great personalities! The atmosphere at Bar Louie is fun and exciting! You can listening to the music or watching the games!!
Christina K.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,1.0,12/5/2016,Been here twice. On two different Saturday nights. And both times the food hasn't been prepared correctly. Disappointing.
Jason W.,"San Antonio, TX",21,1,,1.0,10/25/2015,"Multiple trips: Not only  do the never have what you want,  when they bring you something it contains hair. Placing an online order, they again didn't have what I ordered.  I was told that I should call in to verify my online order...."
Ron S.,"San Antonio, TX",76,9,,5.0,1/26/2016,"Outstanding service and food, an outstanding dining experience.  A very enjoyable place to dine"
Kim P.,"San Antonio, TX",16,30,46,4.0,5/22/2016,The lunch specials are fantastic here! I wish they would have them on the weekends! The 1 topping Pizza with the tomato/mozzarella salad is my favorite. The salted caramel pazookie is sooo yummy! Good service. Quick seating.
Linda M.,"San Antonio, TX",32,15,,4.0,1/23/2015,"Excellent ... wouldn't know that it's a chain restaurant. I brought my elderly parents here for an early (11:30) lunch today (Friday). It was a first visit for all of us, and we asked for their quietest booth. Although there were TV's playing, the noise was not overwhelming where we were seated. The ambiance is young but not noisy/crazy ... more professional and Yuppie. Now for the food.  Our appetizers were the fried calamari (a large portion of tiny squid cuts, lightly battered and crispy) and the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli (basically, 4 large, soft hush puppies, only much tastier, and with a spicy bacon-y sauce!). My Dad ordered the House Top Sirloin at $13.95 and he said it was excellent and cooked perfectly to his order. He also ""accidentally"" ordered the tomato basil soup and said it's the only time he's ever enjoyed tomato soup! I tasted it, and it was truly delicious ... thick, chunky and fresh.  My Mother had the chicken tortilla soup. It was the creamy type, with nice chunks of chicken as well as fresh avocado. There was a fresh slice of lime floating in it, in case you wanted an extra zing in your soup ... a nice touch. Her hamburger was perfectly cooked also. After our appetizers, I didn't want a big entree, so I ordered the appetizer portion of Gourmet Mac and Cheese. This was my only slight disappointment.  It was described as ""Rotini pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and garlic. Topped with seasoned bread crumbs and smoked bacon."" However, I was unable to discern any cheese except perhaps some parmesan in the topping. The pasta was served in its baking dish and was quite tasty in its butter-and-oil with the seasoned topping; there was not much, if any, cheese that I could tell.  Nevertheless, at $4.95 for quite a large appetizer portion (which included two large garlic breads), I was very satisfied. Our waitress, ""Sam"" was outstanding. She was on the ball, paid extra attention to my elderly parents, and I even saw her practically running several times when things got busier. She definitely earned her 20+% tip. This place was a winner for us, and a return trip is already planned."
Mike E.,"San Antonio, TX",4,23,1,5.0,11/1/2014,"Took the family there last night. Great service great food,  great fun.  I had the house sirloin,  only 13.95.  I was worried it would be bad due to the cheap price. It was awesome.  The half price appetizers was great also."
Kelsey B.,"Boerne, TX",271,7,,5.0,3/9/2016,"I went to this location once and it was not the best first impression the first time I went, but I did try it once more and they were amazing. Very quick with the food and drink! The food was hot and fresh! I went with my friend this time and her baby and he was not a happy camper. First he knocked over some plates and I was amazed at how fast the staff ran over to help and clean up and make sure everything was okay . the manager Priscilla was super sweet and helped calm down the baby and was there to check up very often. From first giving this place a 1 star I'm happy to give it the 5 stars to an incredible experience! Glad to give it another try!"
Ryan M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",45,87,20,3.0,1/3/2015,"Came here with my family the very first night of our vacation to San Antonio as it was on the way to the hotel.  I'm not sure what to say other than to say that BJ's as a chain is consistently good, and this one is no exception. The food was very good. I can order a pizza or the french dip anywhere I know it will always taste similar to what I except and that I will like it. The food came out in a timely manner. I would highly recommend this restaurant over the Chili's next door which I reviewed recently as well. See my review there and you will know why. The restaurant is laid out exactly like many of the others that I have been to. It's nice and large. There are plenty of TVs so that you can always see the game that you want to see playing. Or if it's not on, I am sure you can ask to have it put on.  Overall a nice restaurant to stop by with the family if you are looking for a reasonably priced meal with good food.  Enjoy!"
Mike G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,,5.0,1/28/2016,"Great service and friendly...hard to beat at a restaurant such as this...our first time here and recently moved to San Antonio; good welcome meal for sure and the food was very good including the Jambalaya (nice and spicy!) and the perfectly grilled salmon, so we'll be back. It isn't hard folks...keep up the good work!"
Michelle H.,"San Antonio, TX",45,820,6542,5.0,5/20/2013,"We always get the Grilled Turkey Burger here and skinny fries.  DELISH!  Tried their hand tossed pizza (5-meat) for the first time--wasn't too impressed.  Had better.  Strawberry mojito was good, but wished they left out the mint leaves that had ""black""  on it---made it look not-so-fresh.  I could barely taste the alcohol---which may or may not be a good thing, depending on your preference.  I've had flatbread appetizers here--pretty good.  Our server was great--attentive.  Oh, their oh-so-popular Pazookie is to die for!  Unfortunately, we have been pretty stuffed the past few times to even order dessert. Maybe next time!"
Bryan H.,"Bulverde, TX",1,18,12,4.0,2/1/2016,I come to this bjs quite a bit due to it being right down the street from my apartment. The food is very inconsistent. Sometimes it's the best food I've ever eaten and other times it's not very good. I will continue to chance it and eat at this bjs.
Monica W.,"San Antonio, TX",1,5,,3.0,1/10/2016,"I have always loved coming here. Such a casual, yet classy place. But when my husband and I came today for lunch, he went to unfold his napkin and inside was a dirty fork and knife. So much so that there were even food crumbs on the napkin. We asked the waitress for a new one, and it even looked dirty. Think they need a new dishwasher. Not a good sign- makes you wonder what else is not clean?"
Joseph R.,"San Antonio, TX",52,71,111,3.0,12/8/2014,The food is good but the portions are sooooooo small. I don't want overkill but at least a decent amount of food. The photos they show are deceptive. I wish they would serve bigger portion.
Lady R.,"Austin, TX",10,270,79,1.0,11/22/2015,"What a great place to go to for microwaved, cheap, super processed food. It was horrible. My chicken was the rubbery, fake, cheap kind with fillers in it. But before I go on to the food, let's go onto the beginning. It wasn't busy and the hostess had had her back to us for a while. She was not paying attention and she turned around and apologized because she wasn't working because there was only two people in the entire restaurant. We ordered food and our waitress forgot our drink. App came out swimming in oil and undercooked. Seriously? It's fried... How can you undercook something that is fried. And the app came with such little on it. We hardly touched it even when we were hungry. We got our entrees with still no drink, and there fake chicken and with a fake pita stared me in the face. I have got to say this was by far the nastiest food I have ever had. The entrees look NOTHING like the picture and everything rings cheap. This place has high prices for what?  And thanks to the waitress who kept on flirting with my friend's boyfriend who didn't end up paying. Wrong way to be a server. Everyone counts.  To end, we were charged drinks that we never got.  I don't recommend this place even to the people I dislike. Yes, it was THAT bad."
Scott R.,"San Antonio, TX",220,123,46,4.0,6/17/2015,"A Jeremiah Red is a great way to ease into an evening of Women's World Cup action, or any other sporting event, for that matter. I always sit at the bar - the service is consistently better and the multiple televisions offer plenty of entertainment. Of course, if you're with a spouse or other special person, a table would be more appropriate. The Happy Hour fare and prices are great, so swing by for that. Overall, the pizzas rock, the salads are huge and tasty, and the craft beers satisfy. Oh, the double chocolate pizookie is a definite!"
Shawn M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Went on a Friday night. Hostess was very polite and courteous. An accurate time was given for our party to be seated. However, that concludes the my compliments of this establishment. Once our waiter, Blake, heard we weren't ordering alcohol, he decided our party was far less important than his other tables. Seldom seen from that point forward and never with a smile. Food took over 30 min from the time we ordered. I watched other pizzas be brought out that were ordered after mine by our waiter with no explanation. The deep dish pizza I finally received had a few meatballs in the center of the pizza with a couple diced tomatoes in the same area, but I basically paid $20 for soggy cheese bread. Awful. No silverware till minutes after our food was brought and our waiter was nonexistent. Save your money, time, and aggravation. This place is not worth any of it."
