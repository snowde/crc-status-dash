Lorina A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,5.0,4/26/2016,I love bjs brewhouse. We go to the one 281 almost 2x a week. They have some of the best pizzas. My daughter  and i special order the fettuccine alfredo and substitute the chicken with the grilled salmon. My husband loves the parmesan crusted chicken. I appreciate the vast beer offerings. I highly recommend to sign up for the bj's rewards program. It is so worth it
Joe H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/2/2015,"I've been to this location multiple times and just received the best service in my life, the young man goes by Manny, but I believe his name is Manuel. He was extremely polite and followed up with awesome suggestions. I will definitely be going back very soon."
Cyrus S.,"San Antonio, TX",25,38,168,4.0,9/14/2014,"First time at BJ's in a long time. Never had bad meal here. Open late, great brews, good food, and an excellent staff. Had the wings.... Spicy and BBQ, a Nutty Brewnette and the Smores dessert with peanut butter..... All delish. A quality late night bite!"
Kim T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,7,,4.0,8/15/2015,"this is my fall back place. Can't every go wrong with them.  Good food, average to slightly above average prices, good lunch menu.  Cool inside them."
Helena M.,"Bulverde, TX",0,2,,2.0,2/16/2017,"My friend and I went in on a Friday night and it was busy as expected. We sit down and our waitress comes and takes our drink and app order. She gets out the drink and later some other guy gets out our app. We had the entire time to eat our appetizer plus 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by her again. (25 total) then she took our actual entree order. She left and a new guy brought out our entree about 20 more minutes later. She didn't check up one time to see how our food was or anything. She did give me dipping sauce which I will count her for. I checked to see if she was busy, at some points I saw her laughing with some friends, engaging with other tables and not once did she with us. So when we actually finish our food she gets a box and we order a pizookie. It takes a good 15 minutes for her to even come over to us and say I'll go see where it is. So finally another guy brings it up. It was stiff, ice cream barely melted. Terrible. I was dissatisfied so was my friend. I was also pissed she was so engaged with other tables and refilling their drinks and when it came to us we were just a hurry up table. She gets our checks out and cashes us quickly. Then a manager came up to us and for the first time during the night we were asked how things were. I told him how unsatisfied we were and he took care of our meal. The waitress came and snatched the change and gave my 20 back. And passive aggressively asked what she did wrong. First time I had a bad experience, won't be at this location for a while."
Greg E.,"Bulverde, TX",27,99,16,2.0,4/9/2014,"Careful what you get here. The sliders are bland & tasteless but were hot at least, unlike the fries, cold frigid things. Stick with the pizzas which, by themselves, deserve 3* or 4*. Their craft beers are decent, easy to drink. I had the Red this time, but these are craft beers meant to have broad appeal, don't expect them to be adventurous.  Our bartender/server was okay, bit a bit arrogant. We usually stop at a BJ's once a year. That will probably continue, as there's little compelling us to return often."
J O.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,3,5.0,1/3/2016,"Great ambient, beer and food. Had the Guacamole Bacon burger with a Jeremiah Red! BEST BEER!!"
Michael W.,"San Antonio, TX",168,37,74,5.0,9/11/2012,"Darn good food & better drafts! I do see a lot of negative posts about BJs (mostly in other cities) but I highly recommend the store on Hwy 281 & TPC. The GM, Kip Welsch is top notch and his staff is as well. If you have a problem, bring it up with Kip or one of the duty managers and I guarentee you that it will be rectified. BJs is rolling out some new thin crust pizzas as well as adding some seasonal plates in time for Oktoberfest! Speaking of Oktoberfest, be sure to attend the beer dinner on Monday, 24 September. Excellant beer paired with delicious food!"
Rick W.,"Plainfield, IL",40,7,2,5.0,6/23/2014,"This was the first time I have had the privilege to eat and drink at this establishment!   I have to say that this place is at the top of my list of brew houses!   Not only was the food excellent, the long list of brews have  awesome signature flavors.  I was so impressed with the service and atmosphere.  Great place...definitely would come back when in the San Antonio area."
Erik M.,"Kempner, TX",4,26,1,1.0,9/10/2014,"Received a Yelp message from a person claiming to be from BJ's brewhouse... wanting to speak to me about the incident described in my review.. I have called Tiffany at the number she left, always goes to voicemail.. left messages, never get a call back. Sent an email to the address she posted, no response. Seems to be a trend with the Management and leadership of this company...."
Ryan C.,"San Antonio, TX",5,7,7,5.0,4/27/2014,"This particular BJ's is my favorite, my girlfriend and I are always seated quickly and we know some of the staff, very nice environment and staff. As for the food, the pizza is our favorite to share, the deep dish is more to our preference but thin crust is great too! Everything on the menu I have ever ordered is excellent, 5 stars indeed!"
Trisha A.,"Torrance, CA",1551,393,1576,4.0,1/13/2014,"my family and i came here on football sunday because all appetizers/ wings/ pizzas are 50% off! whenever there is a professional sport team playing, the bar section will offer happy hour specials. this deal only applies when you sit at the bar area so make sure to come early because it's first come, first serve.  we ordered the avocado egg rolls ($5.25) and it was filled with loads of avo, followed up with cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices. what makes it great is the sweet tamarind sauce. it really compliments the rolls. if you love avocados try this dish out! reg. price ($10.25) my favorite was the tuna ahi poke ($4.95) it had a great fresh taste to it. the only thing i didn't like was the crisp wonton chips, although it was good, every time i scooped the tuna the chips would break off. i just had to use my fork and eat it separately. it wasn't too salty or sweet and there was a right amount of poke sauce. the entree also included avocado and green onions, yum! reg. price ($9.95) my little cousin got the angus beef sliders ($4.95) and for $1 more you can add thin or wedge fries to your order. this dish was okay. i wouldn't order it for myself because it's too dry for my taste. each order comes with 3 mini sliders and the usual cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, pickles, and a side of ketchup. reg. price ($9.95) we also ordered the traditional wings (bone-in) ($4.75) we got the garlic parmesan because my little cousin can't take the spiciness. the other flavors offered are hot, spicy buffalo, exxxxra hot - 5 pepper buffalo, brewhouse BBQ, maui sweet or the teriyaki glaze. the wings were tiny and on the fatty side but it was still pretty good. im glad it comes with ranch on the side. reg price ($9.50) unfortunately for our pizza, we had to return it because the dough tasted funny... we think that it wasn't fully cooked through but im glad our server didn't have a problem with it and she gladly took it off our bill. the service here was spectacular. the manager was going table to table greeting everyone and asking if everything was okay. I'm always used to an overly busy packed BJs but this location wasn't crowded at all. my family and i had a great time! we paid around $20 and it fed a family of 4!"
Andrea N.,"Boerne, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/16/2016,"I love this location in San Antonio! They were very accommodating for our group when the party size changed, and although they were busy, our service was quick and precise. Jeremiah was an excellent server with a wonderful countenance. Our table was lucky to have him waiting on us for my friend's birthday."
Knox K.,"Dallas, TX",3392,172,368,4.0,1/7/2015,Solid establishment.  Happy hour = good prices and good food.  Always been impressed with the service too.  :)
A Z.,"South Hadley, MA",1,141,32,4.0,9/18/2014,Nice selection of their own brews. The wheat beer is too recommend. Good food selection.  Fast and friendly service.
Bob F.,"San Antonio, TX",0,8,,5.0,8/31/2015,"Every time we go here, great food, great service and really good beer. Chains can be spotty but mostly consistent.  This place is consistent over the years.  Good food, good service.  Highly recommended."
Teresa B.,"Helotes, TX",10,34,18,4.0,2/9/2014,"My first time to a BJs Brewhouse. Loved it. It is a chain restaurant, but quality food. We had the BJs favorite deep dish pizza and a side salad. A medium for 3 of us filled us up.  Server was pleasant and attentive. We will come back and/or visit other locations."
Mykee O.,"San Antonio, TX",43,36,619,4.0,2/1/2014,"Needed a change of scenery! I've always came in the evening but the Hops is popping here this afternoon.Not too fond on there steaks because they never seem to get it right,but there pizza and wings are great! Always ample space in there as well...great place for friends to mingle...."
Stephany P.,"Bulverde, TX",0,34,10,5.0,6/22/2015,We love BJs! The food is always great. We usually sit in the bar area so Aaron waits on us. He is the best in the universe. He can almost read our minds! Their new tavern cut pizza is great & the lunch menu is wonderful!
Michael M.,"San Antonio, TX",1008,35,83,5.0,9/12/2013,"The food was delicious, the service was fast, and I was truly impressed with the wonderful assortment of alcoholic beverages! The price was a little bit above average, however, I didn't mind paying extra and tipping extra because I was so thoroughly satisfied with everything. I am definitely coming back to this location and I want to try the other one in the La Canterra shops."
