Karla M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,3,1,5.0,12/31/2017,"was out in san bernardino with some friends for the weekend to go to the rolling loud music festival and were staying at the fairfield inn, which is next door to this bjs. on a sunday morning we were hungry and decided to head over there for brunch, since it's only a couple steps away from our hotel. we sat in the cocktail area because there was happy hour, and close to the tvs for the football games. we started off with one server but got switched over to elyssa while she goes on break. elyssa was amazing, she took good care of us and recommended their seasonal grand cru, which i really like. if you ever head over to this bjs i would suggest asking for her, you won't regret it.  happy hour is a great time to go for the bjs beers, only $4! and really good apps for $6. if i'm ever in this area again i'll definitely be coming to this bjs."
Liz A.,"Riverside, CA",40,14,2,1.0,1/2/2018,"***NOTE: This review is based solely on customer service over the phone. It's pretty bad when you don't even go into the restaurant before posting a bad review***  First of all, BJ's and I don't have a lovely history, but I decided to give it a try today anyway. I have a meeting coming up in a few days and I was looking for a place with good food and thought, ""why not BJ's?"".... Yeah they reminded me why not BJ's. I called to set the reservation and this is how the conversation went.  Phone rings. Employee answers.  Employee: Thank you for calling BJ's. How many I help you? Me: Hi. I'm looking to make a reservation for a meeting on Monday. We are looking to have about 12-15 people. I'm wondering if your restaurant would be conducive to a meeting of that size? Employee: Sure, I'm going to have to get my manager for you. Please hold.  ***Hold for about 3 minutes** Employee: Thank you for holding, just give her a few more minutes and she will be with you.  Me: Okay ***Hold for 15 minutes*** Manager: Hi. Thank you for holding. So you want to have a meeting here. When are you looking to hold it? Me: Monday, January 8 at 11:30am. We are looking to have 15 people there. Would that work with your location? Manager: Okay. Let me put you on hold and check my calendar.  Me: My last hold was 15 minutes, would it be sooner than that? Manager: Yes. I'll be right back.  ***Hold for 10 minutes*** Manager: What time did you want to have your reservation? Me: I was on hold for another 10 minutes. Are you guys okay over there?  Manager: **giggles** Yes, we're just really busy because it's our lunch hour and I'm trying to make sure everyone gets served. Me: Right. But it has taken me 30 minutes to make a reservation.  Manager: **ignores my comment** May I have your name and phone number for the reservation? Me: No thank you.  ***end of call*** I called Macaroni Grill to make the same reservation and it took me less than 5 minutes and their manager was very friendly over the phone."
Ross T.,"Highland, CA",2,118,88,3.0,12/2/2017,"Take out service is excellent! Staff was organized and presented our order immediately upon our arrival.  In restaurant service was sub par. Pancakes were very heavy even though they say ""fluffy"". I sent them back because they not editable, but egg whites were well done."
Acela G.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,14,1,5.0,1/6/2018,"This BJ's has AMAZING customer service! The hosts were polite, our waitress Tasha was awesome, and the manager Lindsey was very accommodating. They were all very hands on and attentive. The food was brought out fast and was delicious. This place deserves more than 5 stars in my opinion. Keep up the great work BJ's!"
Robert V.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/5/2018,Love love love this place I go there all the time best food best service. I usually always go for my birthday and I've had two graduation parties there buffets style. Plus manager gave me my first legal shot when I turned 21
Manali P.,"Fontana, CA",15,3,,5.0,1/2/2018,Excellent food  Good service  We are fully satisfied  Every Saturday we are enjoying the food me and my family particular this branch  They treat us very nicely
Lizeth M.,"Las Vegas, NV",287,60,35,3.0,11/19/2017,"Oh why oh why do I keep trying chain restaurants?...Because in a town like this, that's the only thing that's open at this time.  Tried the beer taster with appetizer. Was not impressed by either.  The sirloin burger was dry and fries were cold.  The server was pleasant but not attentive.  I've visited several Bjs and still have nothing great to share."
Tony M.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Wow, I've never been treated so poorly. Very disappointed service was bad, food was also not good!!!the older white blonde waitress was so rude. I will never go back!!!  The entire staff was unprofessional and had terrible customer service... and my wait was 1 hour and 30 minutes so sad!!! Happy new year"
Zach H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",97,179,826,5.0,11/28/2017,This place has amazing happy hour and weekday specials. Monday thru Thursday they have 1/2 off all large pizzas which is an extremely good deal. The size of their menu blew me away as well with plenty of choices from unique appetizers to one of a kinda Pizookie desserts. They also brew beer here so you'll get the freshest hops and malts! So glad I finally tried this place definitely going back as their menu is endless!
Eric C.,"Crestline, CA",55,3,1,4.0,12/27/2017,The waiter was great while they were exceptionally busy! The food was good but I wouldn't say great. I got the deal of the night that was priced very well. I'd give them a 4.5 star but not 5.
Danielle T.,"Bloomington, CA",0,75,32,5.0,12/21/2017,"Was here on Monday to watch Kobe's jersey get retired on t.v. and I was blown away by the service!  Our waitress was excellent!  I am sad that I did not get her name, but we were there Monday around 6:30-7:30 p.m. and sat in the bar area at a booth. She was so fast, checked on us often and our food was excellent.  Great job especially since the place was packed."
Leydi L.,"Yucaipa, CA",10,10,,3.0,12/16/2017,"Delicious pasta and wings, not sure about the pizzas , the one we ordered for our Xmas party of 30, the dough were so thick and we were told that they have the thinnest pizzas in town. A bit disappointing, the dessert just ok, The servers were too busy to serve us properly so. 3 starts for me to this Rest."
Sol A.,"Minneapolis, MN",30,90,142,3.0,11/20/2016,"This place is generic. You are not taking your loved one here for valentines!. The food was okay, the drinks were mediocre.  I sent back my frozen strawberry splash for its utter blandness. It tasted like a milk shake. My BLT salad came complete with a twisted thread from someone's hair. I sent it back. The quinoa and Salmon was good, the salmon was not overcooked.  Had to wait a while to be seated while the hostess gathered menu from empty tables. Overall, this is the place you go when its 10pm and you are just landing at your hotel and need food."
Sarah B.,"Tempe, AZ",63,19,2,5.0,10/15/2017,"The timing was perfect, as our party of 5 barely had a wait.  The team was prompt with drinks and the kid appetizers (free, not to mention brilliant!!)  Our orders were a little of everything, arranging from steak to salad to pasta.  Each dish was cooked perfectly, and came out at just the right temp.  The alfredo was a little skimpy on the broccoli, but once my husband mentioned it, a side of steamed broccoli was brought out almost immediately for him to add to his existing dish.   Their signature dessert was on sale, and ashamed to say-we bought and demolished three of their Pizookees.   Must say the hostess was very entertaining and energetic and was shocked at our first visit, but made sure we had all the details need to make our visit special!"
Reanon G.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",83,13,1,5.0,12/3/2017,"Great location, friends staff and great deals. The foods good, our drinks were a little on the weaker side, but I'm more of a beer person. The hosts were very organized and on top of things with updates and the server was even nicer. Would def go back."
Joy Beth W.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,8,8,5.0,9/27/2017,Love this place. Love this location. The service is great. The servers are really nice and frienly. They seem to know be but maybe it's because I do come in so often. I do like sitting in the bar just because I the area better when I go with my husband but my parents I'll sit in the restaurant.but I love the food no matter where I sit.
Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",298,1007,958,3.0,1/20/2017,"Let's face facts. If you've been to one BJ's, then you've pretty much been to them all. What separates the harlots from the hoez' is by FARRR,..........the customer service and overall flare of the location itself yet, ......this particular location, resting off of Tippicanoe, fellow pizookie loving Yelpers, may just leave you with blue balls and a need to dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT caus' I've certainly put better into my mouth..... Wait a minute. That didn't come out quite right, lol. What I meant was..... uhm..... Better yet (leans back.....) let's just commence within this review...... * * * * * ""Eeenie weenie, teenie weenie, shriveled little short short ....."" Sauntered in on a Friday evening. My sister made the trek from Vegas to celebrate her 13th ""21st"" birthday and with that in hindsight, the least I/we could do was drive from LA to meet up with her and her crew, right?  Fortunately we were stuck in traffic stemming from the rain and EVERYONE knows that Californians can't drive in spit.......let alone condensation. Consequentially, this better enabled my sis' and her posse' to wait (within our absence) and better secure seating, and we were able to walk in - to VIP treatment, bypassing the unprivileged to join her party.  In advance, I find this ironic but AIN'T IT A SHAME THAT WE HAD TO DRIVE OUT FROM LOS ANGELES TO ORDER AN ""L.A. WATER""????  From sit down, were we all addressed and our server was outstanding until he went on break and his replacement went MIA.  Y'all know, I'm from ""the city"" and indicative of such, I reserved no hesitation in ordering a round of shots! For just around $80, we were all able to ring in the night and this, seemingly set the tone for our miserly session of dining whilst in the lovely I.E. (spoken with all due sarcasm).  While the place was packed and parking was a clusterphuk, the server did his best in getting our booze back to us at light speed. Hardly hungry and still pissed from the previously endured gridlock, I requested 'artichoke dip' ($8.95) as well as a side of --something-- else.....and in all truth, had it been any bit revolutionary, I'd probably recall the name of it right now.  Need I state that upon downing a tablespoon of both items, they were duly rejected; quicker than a hooker caught without her paperwork.  I viewed a number of folks requesting additional items; from pot stickers to calamari and nachos. * The irony however, is that NO ONE cleaned their plate, nor did they request a doggy bag, ""to go""!  Now I ain't one tuh' gossip, .....but isn't the TRUE testament of consumer satisfaction when a guest unbuckles his/her belt after licking the plate clean? ----- I'm just sayin'.  Monica Lewinsky must've taken a off day.  It's a brewery so I'm certain the beer is fine, thereon, I'm more of a wine/cocktail fella' and regrettably I'm unable to report on such. As a last method of recourse, I ordered the clam chowder.  (sighs........)  Suddenly it became so dayum clear that I was just NOTTT meant to be at this place. I haven't been this bamboozled since ...(thinks to self), I mistakenly went to 'The Chicken Ranch' in Pahrump, NV and attempted to order buffalo wings.  O__o Perverts, feel free to read on that experience here:    NC-17 colloquialisms aside, I'm obligated to render the following assessment. BJ's has presented itself as being a marginal franchise's attempt in conveying nothing short of meager American cuisine, with hit or miss service and lines that rival the DMV just to get in.  Hadn't it been for the booze and customer service, I'd just have easily provided this location 1 star.  Further placing things into perspective, EVERY guy loves a BJ yet this particular location provided somewhat of a disappointing ""Happy Ending"". By no means am I taking this place completely off of my list, if anything, now it's just muddling around the bottom like ......that one hot chick with syphilis that you have to think twice on texting at midnight.  Factoring in all of the other options around (which doesn't say much when in San Bernardino).........you might go so far as to request Uber pick her up, but you for damned sure know that she's not worth traveling to."
Ronny P.,"Rialto, CA",0,7,2,2.0,12/2/2017,"I order my food online, I walk in and there is a girl on the phone ! Does not tell me anything but look at me ! All she is doing is talking orders and I still have to Waite. Another lady asked me can I help you!! I can't believe the services at this places !! I won't come here anymore!!"
Wade B.,"Colton, CA",185,54,179,4.0,2/6/2017,"This place is my go-to for late night eating in the I.E. The service is usually pretty good, the food is tasty, and the beer is really good. Their pizza is a long-time favorite of mine. Their ""Nutty Brunette"" and ""Jeremiah Red"" beers are my faves in the beer category. I have never had anything that I hated here, but I can't really recall anything that made me HAVE to come back and order it again.  I will definitely be back, because all the other restaurants in town seem to close at sundown."
Amanda C.,"Colton, CA",0,10,3,1.0,11/19/2017,"Ordered to-go, curbside service. Paid and the girl told us 20 minutes. So far it's been 43 minutes and still haven't gotten our food."
JuicyJayBun ..,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/29/2017,"The chicken Alfredo pasta taste like $3 pasta from Walmart. Bring your own pasta and eat there, you'll also save 45 minutes of waiting on your $15 Pasta that tastes better when coming out my @ss."
Chris C.,"Upland, CA",0,19,24,5.0,8/24/2017,Good food great atmosphere . The servers always know how to make you feel at home . Good food strong drinks.
Ray A.,"Highland, CA",39,26,10,5.0,9/2/2017,Fast seating only waited about 5 min and it was busy waitress Jenna was awesome and the clam chowder was really good lots of clams. Thank you Leo for your response customer service is a must with me and from the minute we walked it we received great customer service..
Cyndi B.,"Grand Terrace, CA",8,3,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Awful Experience!!!!! I made reservations online, we got there and still had to wait 20 minutes to get seated. People that came in after us, were seated first. We were finally seated, but they crammed us at a table for four people and we couldn't even move. My dad went to the manager and said can you please move us to a larger table, which they did finally after giving excuses that tables are already pre-reserved. Our waitress was awful, she took our order, other people served it, 5 out of 6 plates  were cold food, and the 6th plate was a wrong order. Never once did our waitress  come back, to refill water, coffee, etc  On any of the beverages that we had. We finally had to call a manager, and explain to him that our food was cold and the worst service that we ever had. He comped a meal off of 2 tickets, but it should have never gotten to that point. Worst experience ever!!"
Nicho S.,"Redlands, CA",16,661,411,4.0,12/11/2016,For a chain restaurant I give BJ's their due. Beautiful and very nice set up they have going on. The customer service is excellent all the way from the greeter to our waiter. The food was very good. My favorite dish to order at BJ's is their pizza and desserts. One small detail at this location is that the service is a bit slow. They are very busy location so it might take a while depending on the time.
Patrick A.,"Anaheim, CA",7,284,58,3.0,1/9/2017,"We were stuck between soccer games and couldn't find too many local options where we wouldn't mind spending a few hours with the kids.  Luckily we called and found Rock & Brew did not allow kids so this was our 2nd choice. Food, service and beer were all ok.  It took a little effort for them to get the Raider playoff game on the big tv but it finally happened.  If you're stuck out this way and looking to kill some time, this did the trick."
Dana S.,"South Pointe, San Bernardino, CA",4,2,,5.0,11/9/2017,This is the greatest place food is excellent try the desserts awesome service could be stepped up a bit but otherwise all the way around a wonderful place drinks so good
Donna M.,"Mentone, CA",86,18,4,5.0,10/22/2017,"First they said 25 minute wait, as they were extremely busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes and our waitress had our drink order right out... they have a new rib eye steak that is fabulous, had it with the Mac n cheese couscous , which was bomb... appetizer was the avocado egg rolls that were delicious!!! We had a fabulous server who earned every bit of her tip... her name was Nicole Z and she was fabulous!!!! Thanks for making our night great!!"
Linda S.,"Beaumont, CA",2,16,3,5.0,6/13/2017,"I'm sorry to say I am now giving a negative review..went to dinner and was told there Salmon was fresh water. I ask both waitress and manager, they said there cook confirmed this, fresh sea salmon. When I received my Salmon  dinner the Salmon  had a noticeable  bad flavor not pleasant not fresh.Before I ordered  I told the manager I get sick if I eat  farmed, as farmed salmon has many unclean foods feed to it, I won't put the details of there diet , not good, look it up. I left w I  a stomach upset. Called next day and was told,"" yes they only  had farmed Salmon"". Very disappointed  to be lied to...Don't go here!!!"
Matthew R.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/6/2017,Had a great time there celebrating my friend having his first child. The waitress Vanessa really treated us well and just made the whole overall experience of the night fantastic! 10 out of 10
Sam S.,"Loma Linda, CA",23,53,154,4.0,6/25/2017,"This BJs is pretty consistent with their food, and great service at %90. It's a go to place when I can't find anything on yelp or pick a favorite place to go to. If you are a sports fan and needing of a refreshment, go strait to the bar seating instead of the wait for tables area."
Diane H.,"Colton, CA",39,5,,5.0,10/28/2017,"Went to BJs in San Bernardino tonight with my daughter and two year old granddaughter. Food was great and service was fantastic! Thank you to our server, Anthony, for exceptional service and also to Mikhail for going out of his way to bring us extra napkins, waters etc and he was happy to do it! Also to the employee (not sure of his position or name) who knew that two year olds get cranky and brought her a dish of fresh fruit and a delicious looking roll and said ""we are pretty busy tonight so this will keep her happy until your food comes out""  Worked like a charm as she really enjoyed it! Thank you again for the exceptional service and we will be back!"
Deanna H.,"Highland, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/7/2017,"I came to BJs to celebrate my birthday and it was a bust!! I ordered a burger with a veggie patty as a substitute and the kitchen got it wrong, not once but twice!!!! I'm completely annoyed and regretful that I came here on my birthday!!!! Worst dinner ever!!!! The 2 stars is for the drink I had, that they got right!!!! D."
Suzanne L.,"San Bernardino, CA",84,31,55,5.0,6/24/2017,"Had a great dinner sirachi Brussel sprouts, gluten free pizza with mozarella tomato salad and a mojito.  Excellent service and sat in the bar area."
Healoha P.,"San Bernardino, CA",75,59,123,5.0,10/7/2016,"I've never experienced bad or slow service here. Today we sat in the bar and there was no wait for a booth. Within a couple of minutes of sitting down, someone brought us menus and took our drink orders. The appetizers and entrees came it within a pretty decent time frame and our servers were very friendly. Our waiter checked on us several times during lunch. The place was rather busy with it being late lunch time and the Dodger game playing. Still we didn't feel rushed or neglected.  The food is always really good, with generous portions. Today I had the poke appetizer and it was amazing. The fish was fresh and it came with some fried won ton chips. I also had the peanut sauce soba noodles which was soo good. My husband had a gigantic burger with bacon and BBQ rib meat in top of it. It was awwweesome."
Rachel K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,4,1.0,10/10/2017,"I used to love BJ's. But this time was the worst service I have ever gotten at a restaurant. Every piece of food was cold, even the pizookies. Had to ask for water multiple times and still did not receive it. Awful. Left thirsty and unsatisfied. Mostly with the service. And secondly with the food. On top of that, I looked through past comments and see the same kind of complaints. The manager responds to each bad review with the same generic response saying to contact him. This seems to be his ""solution"" instead of fixing the root of the problem."
Teresa G.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",156,458,687,1.0,2/28/2017,First time and last time I will come here. I ordered online and went to pick it up outside. Got my bag and went back tot he hotel. My mistake for. It checking my bag but I was missing my salad. Called them back and he said he would refund me. Didn't ask my name or anything but said it would be done. I asked how he would refund me without my information. He asked for my receipt number. I still don't think I will get my refund and plan on calling in and writing a review on their website. Poor customer service. Food was gross. I got the artichoke heart which is normally good but not here. Also ordered guacamole and it was spicy.
Blessing N.,"Loma Linda, CA",165,134,239,4.0,4/15/2016,"My friend and I always come here every other Wednesday just to chill at the bar and vent our troubles away. Daniel the bartender is awesome! Never disappoints us.. His knows his drinks well and always eager to educate. The location is great cause it's next to a hotel in case you can't drive after. Easy for Uber drivers to find you.  For food, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken takes the cup!!! Their mini deep dish pizzas are also a great pair with any of their beers. If you haven't tried their beers start with the Jeremiah Red. For the ladies, if you want something lighter I recommend the Blonde.  The crowd is awesome any day of the week.. It does get crowded over the weekend but that just shows it's a great spot to go to with family or friends :-)"
Daniel C.,"Arcadia, CA",4,30,75,5.0,11/15/2017,"I am amazed how a chain restraurnt has such great food!i come here because my girls go to school near by,there is always a wait,now i know why,great great food,everything i tried has been delicious,great fiid and good beer selection,and of  course a pazookie,cant fo here without a pazookie,"
Edward J.,"Victorville, CA",1,6,,4.0,9/27/2017,Always my go too. Try the house PM Portor! Can get up there in price if you don't watch yourself. But as always great service and food.
