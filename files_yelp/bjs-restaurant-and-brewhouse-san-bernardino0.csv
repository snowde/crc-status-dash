Todd N.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,583,496,4.0,11/18/2012,"How can you go wrong with some classic BJ's??? I was coming back from a retreat up in Big Bear, and some friends and I stopped at this location.  It looks, feel, and has the same environment as any ordinary BJ's, so this review will be relatively short.   This time, I ordered something a little outside my normal Chicago Pizza that I know they're so famous for, but I really wanted to opt for something else.  I ordered the Chicken BBQ sandwich with SWEET POTATO FRIES! The reason why I highlight this is because I just asked on a whim if they even had this delicacy and they did!  We were a relatively large party of about 10 or so, and they were able to sit us almost immediately.  The server seemed to be very attentive to what we wanted and made sure that all our drinks were always full."
Rebecca D.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,21,17,5.0,1/5/2016,"I ate here two nights ago and my food was delicious. I was bummed that they no longer have the snack sized Mac and cheese, but I still had a great experience."
Saul F.,"San Bernardino, CA",26,9,2,1.0,11/20/2015,"I've enjoyed coming to this place for years. So it pains me to write this review... So. Long story short, the two bartenders (bearded Napoleon and mustache dude) were just plain rude. Just rude. And one of the girls as well. I will not return. Ever. I'll tell people my story every chance I get for the rest of my life."
Jay H.,"San Jose, CA",38,68,471,4.0,9/24/2015,"Wonderful dinner at #bjsbrewhouse #bjsrestaurant :- tomato mozerrela salad, Hawaiian mahi mahi and beignet dessert. Very casual atmosphere , delicious food and best for desserts! Good beer and blended beer selection. $$"
Ryn A.,"Redlands, CA",6,77,38,5.0,11/18/2015,I love going here for their to-go and if I'm not already in my pj's we dine in. We live close by and eat late so it's great having this option. Everything on the menu is great and the service is great as well. Never had a bad experience.
Eric S.,"Big Bear, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/27/2015,"Very sad I really like the food here but this time we came in at 5 o'clock and asked about any happy hour specials she told us, only if we sat in the bar, we had our granddaughter with us and really prefered to sit in the restaurant, that kind of took the wind out of our sales so we decided just to have our drinks and leave at that point she said oh well if you want the happy hour special now I'll give it to you to try to get us to stay, for that offer I give them a second star I politely declined as we were out of the mood at this time as we were leaving the restaurant we told the maitre d of the situation and they told us that only if we sat in the bar we could have the specials apparently they're not very family friendly.  we decided to go up the street to Buffalo Wild Wings where they went out of their way to make us welcome!"
Erika E.,"Riverside, CA",41,25,3,2.0,5/15/2015,"Wow, our server really needs to get his sh$& together!!  We were ignored until the manager alerted him, and then it took him over 10 minutes to get our drinks. My husband's salad was dropped without utensils and it took forever to get our bill!! The food here is always great, so at least the cooks have a clue. All in all, it took us over an hour and ten minutes to grab a couple of salads and a bowl of soup! Unacceptable for lunch!!"
Ruby S.,"Long Beach, CA",9,25,,5.0,10/17/2015,"I was amazed by the service yesterday from waiting to the end of our meal. When we arrived there was a long waiting and was surprised when an employee walked around offering mini pizza slices which was awesome you don't expect that from a corporate restaurant, they definitely got my fiance with that he hates waiting! As we sat down service was super quick! Overall an amazing experience. :)"
adda w.,"Los Angeles, CA",738,244,562,4.0,6/29/2012,"Whole wheat, half BBQ chicken/ great white pizza. The BBQ chicken was on point. I didn't really like the great white, only because I didn't taste the alfredo sauce. The red velvet pizooki was way too sweet for my liking. Service here was pretty good. The only thing that suck, was waiting forever for our table and food."
Staci F.,"Highland, CA",45,13,1,5.0,5/21/2016,"We are a difficult party because our daughter has many food allergies. The server was immediately accommodating and wanted to know all of her allergens. We asked about a particular allergen in the roasted chicken quinoa meal and she went to the kitchen and returned promptly. She was patient, and I was a little worried when she introduced her replacement. However, he was great too. Overall great experience for an allergy sensitive party. I also really appreciate the top 8 allergen menu on the website. BJ's has done a great job and we will continue to look to them when we dine out."
Vivi H.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,11,17,1.0,5/15/2015,"(This is solely based on customer service) I've been here once before a while back and it was awesome so I decided to come back today for my birthday. My boyfriend and I got here asked for the wait time and the woman said there was no wait for two people she pointed at the table and we sat down, the other hostess comes by and says ""next time wait for us to seat you"". Then came the waiter asked if we wanted drinks then later comes back and says ""you guys know we have to seat you first right?"" OK WE GOT IT THE FIRST TIME. (Are they all just talking about it while they stand there and chat with each other?) It was very rude the way they said it, if they wanted us to move they could have said that, so we left. Thanks for ruining my birthday dinner with your gross attitude and crap customer service."
Jas S.,"Bloomington, CA",50,160,19,1.0,8/1/2015,Service is so bad here. Second time here and watched several groups of people getting served before us. Asked to talk to the manager. Just said it was busy and nothing else. Took our food to go. Like so many places around San Bernardino I don't see it being open much longer.
Loly H.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,35,1,1.0,5/2/2015,"I sure hope that management from BJ's  reads this, it's so important for their own good and good of there business.  The Fairfield Hotel is literally 30 feet from your restaurant.  I would say that the hotel is about 90 percent business, they don't have a restaurant therefore BJ's is the prime restaurant to go to as it's just 30/50 feet away...  I called to order some food delivered to our room... they actually hesitated to deliver, they said that their delivery guy was on a break- ""okay""- I said we are just across your driveway, maybe just 30 feet walking distance, they said,  okay... then they delivered the food.  The delivery gal came to the door, she said: ""are you aware of the $25.00 delivery minimum, we said, ""no, we are not""'- we couldn't believe that a hotel literally in 30 feet from BJ's could even charge for delivery, this is a no brainer to BJ's Restaurant should take priority to Fairfield Hotel, Inn, owned by Marriott.  If BJ's was smart they would take advantage and treat Fairfield corporate clients as VVIP's- this is an easy sale and revenue... walk over, deliver and that's it, no gas, a server or staff member could deliver this and make revenue easy  gratuity in less than five minutes!! -wake up!! Think about it, their front desk.peolple at Fairfield could even help and refer you!!!"
Kent S.,"San Francisco, CA",53,63,6,5.0,6/28/2015,Nice to see bartenders working as a team and taking care of all customers together. Happy hour rocked and this might have been the best BJ bar I have ever been too!
Cinamin C.,"San Bernardino, CA",11,5,,5.0,1/1/2016,"Sometimes the wait is pretty long, but it is worth the wait once you get seated. They will let you try a beer and if you don't like it, you can try another until you are happy with what you have. If you describe what flavors you like, the servers will try to match the beer to your taste. They make mouthwatering pizza and all sorts of other super yummy menu items. They are a bit spendy, but as a treat, it's worth it."
Mary J.,"Highland, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/25/2015,"It took me a week to get this off my chest.  I was so upset at how we were treated that it literally took my Christmas spirit away. With everything that San Bernardino has endured over the last month, you'd think that a business would want to do everything to keep customers. We had our Christmas Party here and between what the company spent (over $700.00) and what the bar made in adult drinks (over $300) I will never go back there.  We were asked to move our own tables around to accomodate an addtional 5 guests.   They told us that the ""other tables"" were for their ""other guests""  what the heck?  Poor managment and poor customer service.  We literally chose the buffet meal so the waiter's job was very easy.  All this restaurant had to do was make the guest comfortable.  Obviously, the managers at this location have no business sense and surely not a degree in business. Mike the male manager never spoke up to the very rude female manager who was telling him what to do. I am big on keeping business local however,  this location lost a loyal customer and 35 other families who will never go back there."
Shaun P.,"Fontana, CA",30,17,,4.0,5/12/2015,"The sweet pig pizza is not to be missed if you like Hawaiian style, order that with their stout or porter and you'll be in hog heaven. Be sure to check their website because there was a sweet 5 bucks off coupon. Take your wife or date, sit in the bar area and watch the game guarantee good time and full belly!"
Boricua L.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/2/2016,"Yummy! Clean, professional and courteous environment. Great customer service."
Dennis P.,"Colton, CA",4,21,1,1.0,5/7/2016,"Still have not been back since my original post.  Made several attempts to deal with the promises from the Corporate office but they never followed up either...  So for run down purposes, they lost my business, they lost my every other week gathering where between 8 to 12 friends gathered there, they lost my wife and her thirsty thursday group, they lost my daughters business and I talk them down to anyone I know.. And of course, they are still in business, I am never going to change that, but, I will be satisfied that people I know will avoid them..  All over the fact that they just flat out refused to ask about my glasses and keep their promises."
DB Z.,"Loma Linda, CA",5,139,42,4.0,5/9/2015,We always enjoy our food at this BJ's location and the service is really good. Of course the pizza is great and the BBQ Baby Back Ribs are really amazingly tender and flavorful with a terrific sauce. The Margarita Flatbread Pizza is a tasty appetizer and the triple chocolate Pizookie  is fantastic!!
