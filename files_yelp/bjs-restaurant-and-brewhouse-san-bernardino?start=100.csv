Brooke A.,"San Diego, CA",172,26,17,5.0,1/1/2017,"Normally I wouldn't give 5 starts to a chain restaurant but the service was great. Aaron, our waiter, was friendly, tentative and took care of our table. Also, food came out quickly. The food wasnt amazing but again it's a chain and it was good. There pizzas here are very devious and BJ's always has a large selection of food to choose from."
Anthony V.,"Loma Linda, CA",2,9,,2.0,1/16/2017,"Consitantly poor service and long wait for food. I continue to give them chances, and this is the case every time."
Dave H.,"Highland, CA",20,33,,5.0,12/19/2016,I recently attended a company Christmas party here and I can honestly state that their pizza is absolutely awesome! The place itself has a nice atmosphere about it. The staff are attentive and professional.  I will gladly endorse this place for future business.
Chip C.,"Colton, CA",119,18,,3.0,2/16/2017,"Your run of the mill American chain, nothing stands out but nothing is awful. Decent food. Decent beer selection. Place has gone slightly downhill with the constant staff turnover. At least the bartender Amy is still there."
Steve K.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,9,2,5.0,12/18/2016,Another great time and meal at B J's we love the pizza and desserts our server Maria was great thank you for the great food and service
Cham W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,2,1.0,7/12/2016,The food is excellent and I enjoy it but every time I come here the service is terrible. This isn't the first time either. I order my appetizer and finished eating before the waitress even took my order. We ordered our food and I ordered a drink. I waited and waited for my drink. My food came out and my drink still didn't come out. I came in excited for a good meal and the service ruined my appetite.  I was at Bj's a day ago and my gift card didn't work. Apparently the manager tried everything. I was told that there is a $50 balance on my card and that Bj's tried charging $50.88 instead of $50 that's why the card declined. I gave them my debit card to run the 88 cents but they didn't do it properly. I don't plan on returning to this location. They have the worst customer service.
Angela B.,"Beaumont, CA",0,2,1,2.0,7/26/2017,"I do love BJ's however just had a bad witness on Sunday evening Sarah, broke a glass on her beverage tray instead of cleaning it up she still chose to service our drinks while broken glass was on her tray then never checked on us one of the main dishes never came for a person in our group. Manager did come over and apologized. But Sarah never did. They should train servers to be kind and check on guest and not service broken glass to customers."
Linda M.,"Westminster, CA",63,304,190,1.0,5/4/2015,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would!!!  We decided to come back here with my in laws to celebrate an early Mother's Day.  After being seated, we waited 20 minutes before any service.  While we waited, 7 waiters and waitresses passed by our table.  I sat and counted.  While waiting I looked over at the hostess table and there were 6 people hanging around there.  2 of them looked like hostesses, one looked like the manager, and 3 were waiters.  Hmm...with al the waiters hanging around you would think service would've been awesome.  WRONG !!! While waiting, I had to flag down a waiter.  A random waiter.  Finally got some service.  He introduced himself and apologize that our waiter wasn't there yet.  After getting our orders in, we finally got our drinks and food.  After that another waitress came and said she would take over.  Take over for who?  Our waiter? Our waiter never came.  You mean you're taking over for that random waiter I had to call over?   BTW, the place wasnt packed or crowded or busy.  If it was then I would've been more patient and understanding.  Nope. Not the case here.   We will not be coming back here again.  I will email corporate about this since this is the second time we've been ignored.  I gave them almost 5 years to shape up (if you noticed my first review was in 2010).  You screwed up BJs."
Quinn C.,"Beaumont, CA",36,211,1,3.0,11/17/2016,"Food was good!  Loved the mozzarella sticks and pasta dishes we ordered.  Service was a little bit slow and it's on the pricey side.  I think we'll be back, though."
Kaylyn S.,"Redlands, CA",99,10,1,1.0,5/30/2017,"The service was awfullllll. I would  totally would recommend going somewhere else for lunch or dinner. Our waitress never filled up our drinks once, didn't bother to ask us if we needed anything. For starters it took about 5 minutes just to get water. Our food was OK. If it was crowded I would totally understand, but the place was EMPTY!! Never going back there again."
J W.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,98,59,2.0,5/30/2017,So I came today just to have a pizookie and I wasn't as happy as I should've been. And I let my waiter know and she said she would inform the manager. Well the manager gave her a message for me instead of coming and seeing what the problem was. So whwn the bill came I why didn't the manager come out and the waiter said they usually do but he sent a message this time which made her uncomfortable. So I asked to speak with him. So Jose came out and I explained I had an issues and I didn't want anything nut for him to address it and he indicated well he didn't want to argue. I was surprised he said that without ever speaking with me. That's poor customer service. If i have to start going to Rancho for BJ's for better customer service I will.
Margie A.,"Tucson, AZ",212,189,1851,4.0,7/18/2015,"I've been here on numerous occasions.  There usually seems to be a wait. Good for groups. The ceilings are high, so while nose level is usually up, it's not so bad. I enjoyed pot stickers, pizza and a pizookie.  Nothing sensational to report, the meals were fine. Nothing bad either. So, it was just fine and I provided an overly detailed report on ""just fine""."
Giselle S.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/7/2017,"I love their buffalo chicken pizza, their variety of craft beers are awesome, and their pazzokies are to die for!"
Kate C.,"Colton, CA",123,32,33,5.0,8/20/2015,"OVER THE TOP SERVICE! Food at BJs is always great, but our servers Kelsey and Michael were outstanding. My bachelorette party (8.8.15) had nearly 12 indecisive girls, myself included. They were attentive, patient, and suggested a peach margarita(?), which was SUPER delicious.  About 5 minutes after we all finished eating, they sent out three mini pizooki desserts with candles and led the group in ""Hip Hip Hooray"" for me. It was so unexpected and cute, it completely made my night.  As we picked them apart, they processed everyone's bills (which I'm sure were difficult with everyone buying each other drinks) and took care of everything so quickly. The bus boy had the huge table cleared of everything and was incredibly polite. I was so impressed by their teamwork and attention! I'd go out of my way to come back on either of their shifts. Great job. :)"
Heiki Q.,"San Bernardino, CA",43,4,,1.0,2/13/2017,Why is the pizza cold ??????  This place use to be thw bomb. What happen to it ???????
Andrea N.,"Fontana, CA",0,14,,5.0,12/2/2016,"My husband and I were in town and I really wanted a pizookie. We encountered a small hiccup with our order but the manager on duty and our server were awesome and provided us with great customer service. I ordered the Asian Chopped Salad and it was very tasty! My husband ordered  garlic shrimp and steak, which was cooked to perfection! Of course, I got my yummy chocolate chip pizookie! Thanks for the great dining experience BJ's!"
Lester C.,"Sacramento, CA",56,6,,5.0,5/30/2016,Avocado rolls are a must Mum loves the clam chowder in a bowl Mediterranean pizza & a piranha is heaven  White chocolate piezookie is the buisness I've never had bad service at ANY bj's
Joseph M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",39,68,49,4.0,2/28/2016,Not too shabby for a bar-and-grill style restaurant. The Pizookie desserts are #deeeeee-lish. I don't even eat desserts that often. The staff was great. The decor was nice. Wait time was standard for a Friday nite... 45-mins+. Nothing really memorable about this place though. Well... maybe the conversations heard by people sitting around you. (The things people will discuss out loud in public... #sheesh)
Jimi C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,3,1,1.0,7/3/2017,"Tavern pizza that i waited 20 minutes for doughy hell, as, no napkins, no peppers and cheese wtf has happened to this place.  Holes in the upholstery,  dirty bathrooms. Unacceptable."
Carly E.,"Yucaipa, CA",39,39,18,5.0,2/2/2015,The manager invites us back in for a complimentary dinner and the service and food  were fantastic. I suggest if you have issues to complete a BJ's survey. Thank you!
