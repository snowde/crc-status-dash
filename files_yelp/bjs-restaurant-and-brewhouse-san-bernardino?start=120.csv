Brosephhh ..,"Redlands, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/7/2016,"Food is great. My favorites are their burgers and pizza. The mini pizzas are only 5 bucks each during happy hour, one of my favorite places to eat."
Alec R.,"Highland, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/7/2017,Love this place cannot beat the pizookie and the pizzas! Come on mondays for half priced pizzas Ambers the best ;)
Kelly K.,"Torrance, CA",233,24,16,5.0,12/3/2016,"Love the pizookies.  My favorite dessert ever. If you're looking for a light meal i recommend the salmon and asparagus,  very light and just enough room left for dessert."
Robert R.,"Sun City, CA",37,231,2,1.0,9/17/2016,"When you're told the wait is 15 minutes, you'd think you would not be waiting 65 minutes. That must be how they get you to stay.... By telling you 15 minutes. We never would've waited an hour. Two thumbs down. Doesn't matter how the food is when they can't tell time."
Kenny T.,"Ooltewah, TN",66,180,46,2.0,12/10/2014,"I really should go under 2 star but the food is pretty good. Service is a bit lacking.  I'm from out of town and on business and j wanted to watch a particular game while I ate dinner. I asked if they planned to show it and a manager said that he could change the channel near where I was going to be seated. So I sat and started ordering. After a bit the channel never changed and I asked about it. Well, ""it's a paid channel and we don't have those""   So no game for me. Well let's be honest it's a part of NBA league pass. And if you're gonna run an establishment with ELEVEN Tv's you're obviously marketing the sit down and enjoy a game experience. And you're too cheap to buy league pass? Can't be because the place is packed on a Wednesday. Just dumb management.  My appetizer came out and I didn't have a napkin or flat wear.  So I had to wait for that. Pizza came out without parmesan and red peppers. First time to a BJ's where that has happened.  This was a pretty disappointing experience."
Leanna L.,"Loma Linda, CA",6,22,,2.0,2/27/2016,Worse curb side service ever!! They don't pick up the phone!! Not only that... They were not apologetic at all!! On top of that they didn't get my order right!! Disappointing service!!! I did try reaching back... The email he gave must not work anymore... Sent it twice... Hmmmmm.... So the general manager Brian Sunday managed to get in contact with me and apologized for what I have experienced and gave me a little something through the mail. I was not expecting anything after this experience. But BJs attention to this has restored my faith in their great customer service! Awesome. Thank you!!
Precious M.,"Menifee, CA",0,18,8,1.0,5/7/2017,"Just ate here with my sister, aunt and uncle. A girl by the name of Shannon started as our server. She took out order, then walked away. Few minutes later she returned with a new server and told us that she was going home. Well she lied, if you didn't want to serve us, that's all you had to say. We could of took our service else where. Shannon helped everyone around us but refused to come to our table. She wouldn't even look at us. I will never come back here again."
Mariah A.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",145,182,540,5.0,11/18/2015,"I went to BJs with a group of 10. It was a weeknight so not super packed. The food seemed to take quite awhile to come out but our waitress did a good job. She was nice enough to bring separate checks for everyone. I tried the clam chowder in a bread bowl...it was good not great. I really liked the fresh rolls and Marina! If I'd known about those I would have just eaten one or two with soup and skipped the massive bread bowl which I couldn't come close to finishing. The rest of the group seemed to like their various menu items...true, they'd already downed a pitcher of beer but I didn't hear any complaints! I think it's one of the few options that is good for food, beer, and a large group in the San Bernardino area. The menu is enormous so there should be something for everyone...it just might take awhile to decide what to order!"
Michael L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,74,77,5.0,5/4/2016,"BJ's. For a chain they are always perfect. Fast seating, friendly/professional staff, FAST service, CLEAN-cut servers, great beer, cold glasses. Music too loud, but always excellence here. Rivals TAP's in Corona and in Brea. I can really find no flaws. The specials are WOW. Food is great. Huge menu. Brian, our spectacular server suggested the Loyaly Program, earn points.... Great idea that rewards loyalty. Special App too to pre-order and you can pay by phone via the App. Tuesdays all day and happy hour 3-7pm and sun - Thurs 10 pm to close. I love BJ's! (LOL)"
Aspen H.,"Pasadena, CA",32,341,382,1.0,10/20/2014,"Stopped by this location at 11 a.m., ordered the calamari that wasn't good at all;  looked like it burned but batter was soggy, made you think it was from night before that re-cooked again and actually the inside of batter calamari was cold! Their signature pizza was over powered with tomatoes. - totally wasted time and $$. If you walk in before 11 a.m., not to expect to get noticed."
Melissa M.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,25,13,3.0,3/9/2016,"Great food! Server seemed irritated from the get go! I think he was new but rude....asked real quick what we wanted to drink (8 of us)....had no suggestions on what to get....and had to look at the menu to write down my order. Kept walking away real quick until my homeboy said ""hey wait""! He needed more patience, needless to say.  All hostess were great! Freaking cute, sweet girls! Food was great! Our only bad experience was that they have no cameras outside and my buddies motercyle got knocked over for no reason.....no proof on what happend. But his bike got a Lil banged up and ruined our night."
Chanica V.,"Los Angeles, CA",527,143,353,3.0,10/2/2015,"I came here on their national pizookie day so it was pretty packed because everyone came here for the free pizookie. I would assume that the restaurant would predict that the restaurant would be busy that day and hire extra workers. However, the service was as slow as ever. We waited 15 minutes to be seated for a party of two which wasn't that bad.  We sat down and waited 15 minutes before someone would come to take our order. Then another 20 for food and then awhile longer for the check. I had to wave down the waiter a few times to get my water refilled and the poor waiter of another table spilled food and water everywhere. It seemed like they just aren't ready for customers.  The food was all right. We got the deep dish bj combo pizza and the clam chowder. Clam chowder is something you could probably get out of a can. The pizza wasn't too bad but nothing special I would go out of my way to get again.  The only thing good about this place is the pizookie. Hands down the best dessert. We got the triple chocolate which was a chocolate cookie with ghiradelli chocolate chips with chocolate ice cream on top. It was basically chocolate heaven. I would probably come back here for the dessert because it is just as good as everyone says it is."
Gabriella S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,15,3,5.0,3/30/2017,"I am crazy hooked on BJs!!! I come very often during football season to watch the games with my sister. It seems like no matter where you sit you have a clear enough view of the game,if not they're fine moving you to where you are comfortable. I've come in for brunch and had an absolutely fantastic meal-country fried chicken with toasted corn and potatoes and gravy!! I love this dish-never take it away. I often order you ribs dinner because it never fails me,but your pizzas are to die for. I ordered a half and half to celebrate one of my staff members completion of his training and he was sooooooo happy! He loved your  delicious combinations! I will continue to recommend BJs to my guests because no other restaurant on Hospitality lane as lived up to their service,value,or quality of food. Thank you Bjs You make my job easier and my tummy happppppppy!"
Puneet D.,"Hercules, CA",2,55,12,4.0,8/5/2016,I've been to this location a few times and I always get prompt service. The wait staff is nice and polite. The facility is clean. Food comes out at good time and is always hot. Drinks are cold. This place is always a great backup when you don't know where to go.
Yvette G.,"La Habra, CA",8,9,17,4.0,12/2/2015,"Initial impression not good. We had a large party (27) looking to have lunch after an emotional funeral. The hostess at the desk had a stink face & not so inviting attitude about our polite request even after we advised her that we didn't need to all sit together and that we would be happy with just tables close to each other. The servers however turned that all around, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. They were Attentive and had great attitudes about dealing with a couple of separate checks and a big group. We got our food fast and it was yummy! My first buffalo burger, good stuff! Maybe the hostess could take a lesson or 2 from them and remember to be hospitable to groups of any size coming in because they are the reason she has a job."
Missy M.,"Yucaipa, CA",7,12,,5.0,2/28/2017,"We went with friends last night to the beer & food pairing. What a great event! It was well organized, the beer & food was delicious and the portions were very generous on both. Our servers & host Chris, Richard, Heime, Oscar and Brian were great and did their best to accommodate everyone, thanks for a good night and we will be back!"
Lori C.,"San Francisco, CA",98,133,50,3.0,9/12/2015,"Okay okay. So after my latest update, Brian sent me a direct message on yelp with two different emails I could reach him at. He definitely made the effort to reach out and try to make amends for my poor experience. So thanks Brian Sunday, you're an a-okay dude in my book!"
Karen V.,"Rialto, CA",100,40,63,4.0,6/7/2016,"We went on Friday lunch hour and we were quickly seated even though the restaurant seemed to be pretty full. We ordered our food and our waitress had a serious face while taking our order and wasn't really friendly. As an appetizer we orders chips and tomato salsa that came with free refills, but she never refilled it. I order a bacon and avocado cheese sandwich with potato wedges. I can't complain about lunch because it was delicious! Potato wedges had a perfect texture and taste. I also ordered a strawberry margarita and it was made just right with the perfect amount of alcohol. As for the appetizer, the chips were also delicious and crunchy. The salsa had a really good flavor and wasn't spicy at all. Overall, the location is good and the food is delicious but the customer service isn't that great. Our waitress passed by us several times without even asking us if we wanted another refill."
Matt T.,"Highland, CA",281,81,38,2.0,1/16/2016,"I don't know if it's just this location, but each time I come here the service is extremely slow. I'm big on service and that's what this review is mostly about.  The waiters are very polite, but I always get a sense of being ignored. My girlfriend ordered the Grilled Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo ($14) and asked for extra Alfredo sauce. We received the entree but we were waiting on the extra sauce and after 3-4 minutes of waiting we were so hungry we just started to eat. While we ate I was trying to flag down a server and finally when I was able to get a hold of one they said, of course, just to give them a minute. So when another 3 minutes went by I asked another server if they could get us some extra Alfredo sauce, and their response was, ok i'll let your server know. By this point we already gave up on getting our extra Alfredo sauce.  But, finally our server returned to refill our drinks and asked if we needed anything else. We discussed what happened and I guess she just forgot and the other server that said they would inform her never informed her. She apologized multiple times and seemed sincere about it, so we just left it at that. She was probably just having an off night, but besides that incident, the service I have received here  has been on the rather slow side."
Lisa W.,"San Bernardino, CA",10,5,,5.0,10/4/2016,I am so happy to say that this is the first meal in a long time that hasn't been hampered by either bad / uncooked food or poor staffing. I ordered ribs (after table appetizers of roasted Brussels sprouts and potstickers) with asparagus and a baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection and I was very impressed with the service (Maria). I'll be back!
