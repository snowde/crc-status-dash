Freddy F.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,3,5.0,6/25/2015,"I just want to say that I really enjoy the unlimited soups and salads for lunch... And our server today Maria (in the bar section) was wonderful. Maria basically made one of my favorite salads ""Mozzarella and Tomatoes"" into a new salad by suggesting having Roman lettuce tossed with it.  I understand it can be busy at lunch, an servers can be limited on time also due to lunch rush volume, but she went the extra mile with her skills an talents as a server ""Thanks  Maria""   BTW in case you didn't notice (lol) the chicken tortilla soup is my Fav lol (I'm open to suggestions)  I would also like to mention a manager name Melissa from Rancho Cucamonga who is here at the beginning of the month and made special comindation for Soup an Salad for my roommate who had a tooth extraction.. This is a place I'm constantly recommending to friends and family.. 5 Stars everytime I'm here..."
Sarah R.,"San Diego, CA",276,34,12,5.0,8/31/2016,"This restaurant is not one I would normally think of enjoying because I'm a health food fanatic, but I was surprised to find that they have something for everyone here. I would recommend any of the salmon dishes. Especially the salmon quinoa bowl: a generous mouth watering serving of salmon on a bed of quinoa, with green beans, roasted peppers and mushrooms. The taste is impeccable. This is my new favorite restaurant meal! It's filling in a pleasing way."
Mrs. D.,"Highland, CA",162,110,46,5.0,6/3/2016,Just picked up a very large take-out order for my daughter's middle school. They had it all ready and there was minimal wait. I parked right in front in the reserve spots for takeout and they helped me take all the food  to my car and it was very efficient. I would recommend using this place for takeout
Diane T.,"Redlands, CA",0,11,,3.0,2/10/2017,"Food good , drinks good, service good. Floors very slippery, notified management - they said they were aware but difficult to keep non- slick due to wood. I have wood floors and I can't skate on mine. So if you slip and fall they are aware of the situation."
Melissa G.,"San Diego, CA",25,2,,5.0,4/28/2016,Great place for a quick bite to eat and celebrate daughters birthday. Our server Michael was great. He was friendly and attentive. Will be back for sure.
Christine A.,"Beaumont, CA",25,32,,2.0,12/1/2015,The cooperate office changed the menu. We went there for Shrimp Scampi and it was gone! The manager said they don't even have some of the ingredients to make it. What happened to pleasing the customer?? My advice is check out their new menu before going there.
Lauren S.,"Garden Grove, CA",472,45,34,2.0,10/31/2015,"The food was great but the service was sub par.  I was really disappointed that they ""ran out of silverware"". Paying took about 45 minutes because their system was down and my group had to cancel our other plans because of how slow they were."
Thelma S.,"San Bernardino, CA",13,2,2,1.0,6/24/2016,"Me and my bf love bjs but this location had something off today. We ordered the best beginnings app, the mozzarella sticks were still cold as well as the wings. We ordered a pizza and that was cold too.  We let the server know that it was cold but we didn't want it replaced that it was fine,hoping she would let the cooks know. We ordered desert,a pazookie, and the cookie was cold compared to other locations. Sad to say this was a disappointing meal. At this moment we are still waiting for the check because their system went down -_-"
Lisa B.,"Lake Arrowhead, CA",63,23,11,5.0,3/2/2016,"We had a great time, great food and our server, Kristen, was wonderful. Last Monday we had an awful experience at TGIF's in San Bernardino. I will never go there again.  I got there before my friend and took a booth in the bar area. I was greeted immediately. I ordered a Diet Coke and the ahi poke while I waited. Kristen was super attentive. My friend came and got the avocado egg rolls. I then had the gluten free pizza. I told her I have an allergy and she was knowledgable about it and said she would let the kitchen know so my food wouldn't get cross contaminated. My friend had the kale salad. Everything was great. I think we spent about three hours there. We will go back often."
Jacki R.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,9,,3.0,7/27/2017,"This was my second time at this restaurant, when we walked through the door the hostess was very friendly and attentive, When we were seated and I ordered my water there was a piece of lettuce in the glass, I use to work at a restaurant so I understand it happens. But when I asked for a new glass the same piece of lettuce was floating in the cup. When we asked our waitress to take the dishes from the appetizer she literally rolled her eyes at us. We barely saw her our entire dinner. When we got our food there was a reacureine of things being in our food that should not have been. When we asked for our check we got more attitude. The only reason I am giving this place three stars is because of the quality of the food, when we got our food and it was correct it tasted great and the portion size was great for the cost. The manager handled the situation very well, he was extremely professional and we really appreciate how he handled everything. Besides our one server Cheryl the rest of the staff was extremely friendly, helpful and apologetic for their mistakes. Though our experience wasn't great we will be coming back."
Carly Y.,"Sandpoint, ID",1,18,,5.0,8/7/2016,"My favorites are: avocado rolls, nachos, and going on a birthday because FREE pazookie! If you've never been to a BJ's, definitely go it's absolutely delicious and there's something for everybody to eat!"
Darlene S.,"Colton, CA",116,40,17,5.0,5/8/2016,"Overall, highly recommended.  Love the food and the service, although I do admit that on occasion both of these things can be improved depending on the server and the dish. But again,  highly recommended."
Tarah T.,"Corona, CA",43,42,221,3.0,5/3/2014,"Cool environment, looks like an old warehouse. It is a chain restaurant, but the food is pretty good.  They have happy hours. I've been here for apps and drinks. They car environment is pretty cool.  My favorite meal is the BBQ chicken chopped salad. I get avocado instead of chicken because I'm a vegetarian. It's a super good salad. Get no cheese or corn and dressing on the side and cut your calories in half."
Dana V.,"Redlands, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/29/2015,"I want to give this place more stars but I am continually let down by the service. The food is always good (when it finally arrives) but the staff is lacking in true customer service. Tonight we sat for roughly 10 minutes at our table before even being asked if we wanted drinks. The drinks came with the appetizers. I never received the water I asked for. One of our meals was wrong. A dessert was wrong. I had to ask twice for something that should have come with the drinks. They sound like small things, which I would agree with if all the small things didn't add up after so many.  In the past my wife wanted to come here for her birthday. The entire family went. The service took so long for everything that my wife and family left and I still had to wait for her birthday pizookie in a to go container and the bill for almost 20 minutes. Pathetic.  Please train your staff to function as well as your food quality and I'm there. And it's not for lack of trying from a few. My waiter was busy. I get it. He wanted to do better. The real culprits were the waiters in the close area. One would bring some food item, I would ask for something that should have come with it and then 10 minutes later I would have to ask for that item again. We had a 5 minute wait to be seated and were there an hour and a half."
Rosa R.,"Azusa, CA",0,4,4,5.0,6/21/2016,"Ask for Tiffany. ""Bar Tender,"" she is amazing. I have been coming here over 1 year now. Best service from everyone, including manager. This BJs will take great care of you."
Vince G.,"San Bernardino, CA",52,110,39,5.0,7/9/2015,"A familiar go-to in the Inland Empire. The quality of service and food is always top notch. The overall selection is enormous, sometimes making it difficult to make a selection; they're all that good.  The also have quite the selection of in house craft beers. I've sampled many of them and have to say, I've not found one that I didn't like. They also have a great customer rewards program which I've used numerous times.  Give them a try, you won't be sorry."
Melissa O.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,6,1,5.0,11/17/2016,We made reservation for a party of 6 and everything went smoothly. We checked in and got seated within our reservation time period it was a busy Tuesday night but the server was pleasant and she gave great service. The food was really good we had appetizers so you order calamari and the avocado egg rolls. They were both very good. We had a great time there and I will return again to this location just because the server was awesome but I forgot to get her name. Since it was my friend's birthday they were little bazooki cookie pie with vanilla bean ice cream and it was also a delight.
Rachael B.,"Colton, CA",631,6,8,5.0,7/5/2016,My boyfriend and I always come here and have wonderful service and good drinks! He always gets the Mediterranean tacos and I always get their French fries with salmon!! So good! Never had a bad experience with them.
Zorek W.,"Fontana, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/2/2016,Poor service.......been to another one great food fast service.... but to bad San Bernardino location profiles you. Took way to long to even seat us with a 30min wait while other were being seated with the same amount of people 10mins. Talk to the manager all she said was they all had reservations. High unlikely.....I'll take my money some where else..... Don't recommend this location if your not dress right......
Doug C.,"Mentone, CA",18,20,,4.0,7/10/2015,"Love this place, still great food. I love the black and bleu burger. My wife and I have always enjoyed going in and ordering the Cobb salad. But unfortunately they removed it from the menu. The cheap version they made me today was still great, but still needs to be on the menu, they have all the ingredients .  Please put the highly sought after Cobb salad back on the menu. Thanks for great food and great service."
