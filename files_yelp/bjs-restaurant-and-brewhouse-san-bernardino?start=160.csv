J P.,"Colton, CA",3,27,9,4.0,1/6/2015,"We got great service, which is always a plus. New waitress being trained, we had no issues.  Atmosphere is good as well, lots if tv ' s for all the sports fans out there.  I ordered the New Orleans Jumboalaya,  it was great. My wife ordered the soup and salad. Tortilla soup was bomb. Really recommend it.    Would of got 5 stars but the beer was not that cold."
Francois M.,"Loma Linda, CA",7,10,30,4.0,2/8/2015,"I frequent this place because I have friends who work there behind the bar.  I good place to watch sports at the bar area because they have multiple screens and being a frequent patron, I get to watch hockey, which is still not a common thing to watch when competing sports like basket ball and football and spring baseball are also on.  If you are a draft beer fan, they have plenty to choose from, and the staff are friendly and welcoming.  This review probably will only apply to the bar area and not necessarily the dining area and that's why I gave it 4 stars. Yummy appetizers and meals can be had at the bar.  What more can a single man want?  Perhaps a good wife!  LOL."
Leon V.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,4,3,1.0,10/27/2016,"been coming here for over 6 years maybe once a month sometimes a little longer.  always loved the food, service has been great. usually come in for dinner and few drinks at a booth, never bar area.

Rosie R.,"Merced, CA",3,20,31,5.0,2/9/2015,"Went here with a group of 10 people. They were very quick to seat us which was awesome! We all ordered drinks and appetizers, I ordered a Jacks Berry Lemonade, Thomas got a soda, and we spilt a Mac n Cheese. Everything was delicious my lemonade was strong but so perfect. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken that came with a side of mash potatoes and and broccoli. Thomas ordered the Fried Chicken that came with a side of mash potatoes and this sweet / spicy corn. We ate everything! Lol it was so good! I also suggest their deep dish pizzas too! They are really good !"

David G.,"Loma Linda, CA",2,13,3,2.0,3/3/2015,We went to have a business lunch and the host wanted to sit 8 of us at a booth... Serious. Worst thing is when we asked to sit at a table the waitress got annoyed with us... This isn't the first time staff gets mad when we've asked for something from them...
Mike S.,"Beaumont, CA",23,134,104,4.0,6/11/2015,Great place great service  I had all-you-can-eat salad and soup I tried three types of soup all delicious Two types of salad $7.95 lunch special  Can't beat the price My wife had salmon excellent Will be back
Maritza V.,"Highland, CA",72,16,15,5.0,12/19/2013,"My friends and I went in on a Friday night. Thankfully, it wasn't that packed. We were seated about 15 minutes later and offered pur drinks and menus right away.  I wish I would have gotten our servers name. She was very, very polite. She came and checked on us often, refilled our drinks, and offered her help in case we needed anything else. She seemed very sincere and kind. I liked her. She even came and said goodbye and introduced us  to our new waiter when her shift was over. Moving on; The food was great! I ordered a steak, with cheesy potatoes, and green beans for the sides. I asked for my steak medium rare to well-done and that is exactly what I received. Very juicy, very well flavored. Really, really yummy. My potatoes were perfect as well. Not chunky, very smooth, and very cheesy! The green beans were also very nicely cooked. I added just a bit of salt to my taste, and they were perfect. The environment was nice. Very calm and quiet. The place is just a little too dark lol, but nothing to the point where I would knock off a star haha.  Overall, my experience was great. I will definately be going back go try more of their food, and I would definitely recommend!"
Sirena F.,"Redlands, CA",335,32,457,4.0,12/7/2014,"I love that this place is open til midnight on Sundays! Good food, good drinks, and usually great service here. Some of my favorites are the great white deep dish pizza with a yummy Alfredo garlic sauce n grilled chicken, Vegetarian option: any one of their great burgers w/ patty swapped out for a garden burger patty, and Parmesan crusted chicken is great too. My favorite lunch special is their tomato bisque (which is probably the best I've ever tasted) and a half sandwich blt or whatever. Their Irish root beer makes me feel very grownup. And the new-ish s'mores pizookie will put u in a coma...maybe opt for a lighter white chocolate macadamia nut one instead. The mood here is always positive and loungy."
Sergio L.,"Colton, CA",35,15,57,3.0,1/4/2015,"They get three stars because the food is really yummy the service isn't to bad. Our waitress did serve our pizza on our plates and that was nice. I don't know if anyone else has noticed but no one smiles, I think all the employees were switched out with robots or something."
Brian B.,"Redding, CA",0,21,5,3.0,4/1/2016,"Visiting from out of town. Decent service. Good beer. Good handcrafted sodas. Ribs were overlooked. Clam chowder was not bad, but average. Atmosphere was nice."
Audrey R.,"Corona, CA",35,14,1,5.0,8/20/2015,"I visited this location and was less than impressed with the food I ordered.  I know from past BJ experiences at other locations, this wasn't the norm.  I wrote a complaint and within 12 hours I had a phone call from Brian Sunday, the General Manager.  He apologized and was sorry I had such an unsatisfactory experience.  The fact that he responded so quickly was quite impressive...I also am in customer service and his concern was very much appreciated.  So even though the food didn't meet my expectations..Brian certainly went above and beyond.  BJ's needs more people like him!

Alex B.,"Arrowbear Lake, CA",23,13,,5.0,9/22/2016,"Buckle your seatbelts my friends because I'm about to learn you a thing or two about this place. So me and the lady went to this BJ's last weekend for date night (#SoCute). The hostess was quick and polite, escorted us to our seats and immediately got us set up with drinks and an appetizer order. The appetizer mozzarella sticks were fantastic, nice and garlicky (because that's a word now). Crispy outside, gooey center, the way a cheese stick is supposed to be. So that was tasty. For the main event, however, we ordered the lunch chicken Alfredo for the lady, and for moi, the 14oz rib-eye in medium-rare, because this is America and that's as close to tasting freedom as it gets without stuffing a flag into your mouth. Both dishes were brought out in good time, and the food was great! The meat was tender and juicy, but properly cooked. I also liked that the waitress didn't hit us up every 12.3 seconds to ask us if we were okay or if I'd seen the last season of LOST. All in all, it was fantastic. The bill kinda hurt, but I mean you pay for what you order, right? So, 5 out of 5! Thanks BJ's for the great time. Sorry we didn't get to hit up the pizookie this time but I'm already fat. Next time :D"
Maria G.,"Montclair, CA",47,6,,4.0,10/29/2014,"I am a fan of BJ's in general. My bestfriend and I come every so often to have a double berry beer and some appetizers and catch up. Normally I don""t feel the need to write a review, however after last night's visit I wanted to. First off I know that normally there is a wait when we arrive. Which I don't mind however this time the hostess didn't address me for some time and then when she finally did all she told that they would seat us after a couple that I saw standing. Well 10 mins pass and new people came in and were seated right away while we were still waiting. So of course that annoyed us and when we approached the hostess again she just said wait there. Not friendly or professional AT ALL.  After being seated we were approached by out waiter Anthony. He was great. He was all smiles and super friendly. You can tell he was a good waiter because when we asked for our Beers he carded us(which always makes me feel good) when normally no one even asks. After bringing us our first round he takes out order and must have put it in right away because we didnt wait long. He constantly checked in on us and our glasses were never empty! Anthony you are AWESOME!"
Mary L.,"San Bernardino, CA",230,110,103,4.0,12/13/2015,"I found a BJ brewery closer to home! I came here with my friends on a Saturday night and it was wonderful! The service was spectacular. We tried the small plates and the new root beer wings. Boy, was that delicious!"
Kevin S.,"Colton, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/24/2015,"This restaurant is me and my family's absolute favorite, we love to sit at the bar and for the life of me I can't remember her name but there is this blonde waitress that always waits on us and she gives outstanding service every time! I always get the buffalo chicken pizza and it always tastes great we end our meal with the Oreo pazookie and leave this restaurant with a big smile on our face! Highly recommend this place"
David S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",6,8,7,5.0,2/27/2015,The service is great! The food is great! The environment is great! House music is at an acceptable volume! Pazoooooookkkkkiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeee!!!!
Jessica G.,"Highland, CA",30,7,1,5.0,5/12/2015,"Ate here for the first time, place was great, it was a party of 9 and even though we were late we called in and they understood and was very nice and accommodating. Waiter started off a little edgy but soon got in the swing of things. Everyone was polite and food was delicious and came out at a reasonable time. It was my daughters bday she got a free pizookie and my boys had these achiever certificates so they got a free pin each for that.  FYI the pizza's are much bigger and filling then I expected. I got a large with a friend thinking that would be enough between the two of us and it was way to large. We ended up taking half the pizza home."
Kim A.,"Colton, CA",0,7,,3.0,3/9/2016,"I come here often and realized the food runners do a much better job than the waitresses. For instance last night Abe was friendly and very helpful getting us things missing for our dishes yet our waitress was blah not friendly and looked like she hated her job. Food is always the same good not amazing but good, which is why we come back. My advise hire waitresses who smile and at least pretend to like their job or make the food runners waiters and waitresses. It's not hard to enter food in the system and smile trust me."
