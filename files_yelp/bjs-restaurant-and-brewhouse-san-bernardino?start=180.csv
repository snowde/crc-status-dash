Lumin A.,"Beltsville, MD",8,5,,1.0,4/24/2016,"A party of 15 of my friends and myself went to the BJs in San Bernardino as part of a party of groomsmen after our rehearsal. We requested to be seated together and were told there would be an hour and a half wait. We inquired about an area of the restaurant that didn't have any people and were told by the hostess that this area was closed off for the night. In order to avoid the wait we sat in booths that were close to each other instead. As the night went on we noticed that another large party entered the restaurant and were immediately seated in the area that we were told was closed for the night. At this time the restaurant was less crowded than it was when we had arrived. When we inquired about this, the manger told us that the party seated there had a reservation and that's why she opened that area up. She was extremely rude and condescending during this exchange with us. This also didn't make a lot of sense because the hostess gave us a different story. Of course the manager didn't realize that we could ask the party in question if they did have a reservation - which we did. And guess what - of course they didn't. Now we were a group of guys that look Indian/middle eastern and the group that got seated in the area in question were all white. Did racism have a role to play in this situation- I'm not sure... You be the judge of that. All I know is we were extremely disrespected at this establishment and will not be going to another BJs again. We are also making attempts to contact BJs corporate to make sure that this manager doesn't have the opportunity to do this again."
Steve H.,"Rialto, CA",8,18,12,1.0,9/14/2014,This is a happy hour review.  The beer and food is good. The problem is their happy hour specials.  They have discounts on food but they also serve less food so where is the discount?  That's a real shady way to do things.  Stop being cheap bastards BJs! Offer some real specials!!!!
Gaurav C.,"San Fernando, CA",109,101,1,4.0,8/5/2016,"We wanted some good food and a drink or two and decided to go to BJ's. This BJ's in particular was awesome. The service was great, the drinks were served the way they should have been and the pizza was crispier and better than the ones I've had at most BJ's. Definitely coming back here next time I need a pizza and beer fix. Not to mention that their pizookie was great too."
Jackie C.,"Ontario, CA",56,6,1,5.0,3/26/2016,"Haven't been to BJ's Restaurant for about a year. Most recent visit was on a Friday and the restaurant was crowded during lunch time. We were seated immediately, and we placed an appetizer order and a lunch order for 2. We have received our lunch but did not receive our appetizer. We question the waiter and he said he would look into it and he brought out the appetizer. At this point we had let the waitress know that we did get our appetizer until our food came out. And requested for it to be taken off and sent back. The waitress took the appetizer off the table and went towards the back. The manager came to our table and explain  to us it was their error so they were going to comp the appetizer.  I would return to BJ's because they're excellent service we receive was very much welcome appreciated."
Nicole B.,"Beaumont, CA",155,24,3,1.0,8/20/2015,Got a comment from the manager left under my review saying to contact him after I had a bad experience. But surprise surprise I emailed him and have yet to hear a response after a few weeks. Seems like it looks like they want to act like they are making an effort to make a situation better or hear how they can make it better but this isn't the case. The comment was just for show. Really disappointed.
Daysi S.,"Highland, CA",2,4,,1.0,8/29/2015,"So I went to pick up my order I had placed on the app and I was going to pay using my debit card. Unfortunately I lost my license so I don't have an official ID but I asked the guy if my school ID will do, and he said no. I don't know why that ID wasn't accepted, it's not like they need anything official, all they need to see is a picture and if the names match, which they would. I asked if I could slide this one time because all I wanted was my food, but again he said no so I had no other choice but to leave because I only had five dollars cash on me (which I was planning to leave for the tip). I left very unhappy, I drove all the way over there for nothing. Service this time was horrible."
Patrick E.,"Redlands, CA",1,39,4,4.0,9/18/2014,"One of our favorite places to catch a game.  Love that they came out with an app to see wait time, pay, etc. Hopefully they find a tie in with the other wait time apps like walo ( ). It's nice to have one app to see all wait times and not one for every restaurant."
Nick B.,"Highland, CA",36,13,,4.0,5/26/2015,"ok i would have give 5 stars but, they tens not to being all of the food at the same time sometimes, and they can be a little slow, but it is probably because they are always busy. I like to go here for lunch, the lunch specials are great, and the food is very good, and at least for lunch they are priced very well.   go for the soup and salad lunch its all you can eat and its fantastic.  I did not care for the deep dish pizza so much because the dough is a little to light for me, and they hardly put any sauce on the pizza at all."
Katie W.,"San Bernardino, CA",53,28,,5.0,9/6/2014,"I have never had bad service or food at this BJ's.  The prices are fair, the food is delicious and they give you plenty of it!  They also have quite the drink selection, from beer, to wine, to mixed drinks. I once ordered a drink I ended up not liking as much as I thought I would, and the server had zero problems taking it back and getting me something that I did like.  I've tried everything from fish, to pizza and burgers, to salads here.  They also offer gluten free pizza for my gluten free hubby.  He loves it!  It is all good. One word of advice: you HAVE to have a Pizookie for dessert.  Don't look at the calories, JUST DO IT!!!"
Karen Z.,"Rialto, CA",0,5,1,5.0,8/8/2016,I'm a frequent visitor to BJs and especially this location because of the great food and customer service. I felt the need to write a review is regards to my visit last night during dinner time because it has probably been my best visit thus far. My friend and I had the pleasure of having Jeffery as our server and he was amazing! He was constantly checking up to make sure everything was going well during our visit and brought us refills of our drinks without even having to ask. He went above and beyond to make our visit a memorable one and I just felt the need to share. Great customer service is what makes a great business. Thank you for the amazing service and great food.
Melissa M.,"Dallas, TX",436,394,1490,4.0,6/21/2013,"Watched the NBA finals game here tonight. Crowd was great and not too rowdy.  We ordered the California chicken sandwich with Cajun wedge fries. Both parts of this meal were excellent. There was plenty of fresh avocado on the sandwich and the chicken was moist. The bread has a lot of flavor and has great texture. We also ordered a mini pepperoni pizza which tasted great and came out fresh. Crust was cooked well. For dessert, we had the pizookie with white chocolate macadamia cookie. This was also yummy! The prices are pretty reasonable here for the portions. I ordered a strawberry margarita though and that was a bit pricey. Good thing I didn't order more than 1. They are $9.50 a pop!! Our server checked on us pretty frequently for how busy it was and he was accommodating and let us stay until the game finished.  I definitely recommend this BJs. The only con is there seems to be a lot of homeless people that hang around the parking lot of this BJs asking for money...a bit of a mood killer after having a nice dinner."
Alexandra A.,"Perris, CA",28,30,9,2.0,9/19/2015,It's Saturday and it's not crowded at all but for some reason we've been waiting for our food for so long. Sucks! I finished my beer and no food yet.
Allison P.,"Big Bear, CA",33,4,3,5.0,1/1/2016,I ordered a small cheese pizza here and the dough was a little undercooked and in my opinion the whole pizza was kind of sweet and I was not happy with it but there is a reason why I am giving this place 5 stars. Our waitress was extremely helpful and understanding and when we told her we didn't like the pizza she offered us a new pizza but we had already ate food off other family members plates then she offered a free desert and we accepted and got the salted Carmel pazookie then other person from our party ordered a different pazookie and our waitress even put that desert on the house as well! Great service!!
Nancee Q.,"Colton, CA",5,51,20,2.0,10/7/2015,"Our server Jacob sucked. He took to long for anything that I almost got up and left before i ordered. He messed up on my drinks, didn't apologize and he came off as he didn't really care for his job or maybe it was close to his shift ending. Regardless of what it could've been, i hope i don't get him as a server again."
Sara T.,"Chino, CA",2,22,,1.0,6/5/2015,"I generally love BJ's, but I tried to go to this one on Wednesday and was sadly disappointed that my friends and I didn't even make it past the hostess station.  Here's what happened, and trust me, I wish I was making this up. We walked in and there was a woman standing at the counter.  We waited a few seconds and when she didn't greet us, I said, ""Excuse me...""  She looked up and said, ""Yea?!  What do you need?""   Me: ""Um...a table?  We'd like to be seated please."" Her: ""What do you want?"" Me: ""To eat here.  I'd like a table for three."" Her: *Sigh* ""What do you need from me?"" Me: ""I need for you to seat us...""  By this point, I'm really confused.  She's the hostess.  She's holding menus in her hand.  I mean...as the hostess, really, what did she think I needed?!  Now, another woman walks up.  She said, ""What's going on?""  The first woman said, ""Ugh, I don't know what their problem is and I don't understand what she's asking for, but I have to go help other people."" The second woman says, ""Oh sorry guys, what can I do?""  I said, ""We wanted to get a table for three.""  She asks our name and as I started to answer, the first woman comes back and sighs and says, ""I don't understand what their problem is and what they want!"" At that point, when the other woman asks again for my name, I said, ""You know, we're not going to eat here after all.  That was so bitchy that we won't be back,"" and we left. Now, I understand that people have bad days, but seriously?  Like I said, I love BJ's.  I typically go to the Rancho location or the one at Eastland, and I have never gotten less than fantastic service.  I would have expected better from BJ's, and I will certainly not return to the San Bernadino location."
Jerry S.,"Highland, CA",37,19,5,5.0,11/11/2015,Had lunch with my family here and it was a very busy Veterans Day. My sons burger came out a bit cold and over done. The waitress took it back and brought out a nice hot fresh one and it was good. The manager came to give his apologies and make sure we were ok and gave us a free pazooki. We will come back for sure our waitress was awesome.
Juan F.,"Monterey Park, CA",921,2004,4581,3.0,5/23/2014,"Just like every other BJs. Mediocre food, bad service, and excellent Pzookies..."
Susana G.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,1,5.0,2/11/2016,This place is awesome berry tasty food! Great customer service! Wait time was approx 10 min so not bad!
Mikey M.,"Ventura, CA",26,26,18,1.0,6/4/2016,"I normally only have positive things to say about these restaurants.  Sadly, my last two visits have been less than par. My associate and I came in to relax and watch the game. Our emails indicated that there was happy hour during the soccer match. We asked our server and she disruptedly said there's never happy hour on Saturday. As I questioned her about the email and about during football on Saturdays, she said theres NEVER happy hour on Saturdays and who cares about soccer. In relation to our food when we asked about getting the bone in wings tradition style she said, "" look at where is ok"". She also expressed great disappointment in a rude fashion when we moved from a high top in the bar to a booth due to discomfort and a wobbly table. Sadly it appears if she's unaware of BJ's rewards, promotions, e-mails, and store policies. Another note is I witnessed an employee fail to wash their hands after they used the facilities. Food was good with an exception to the root beer ribs. Those came out a bit charcoal. In addition our server presented our check without asking if we wanted a desert, had a BJ's rewards, or if we wanted to pay with our application  Yet, the rest of the food was great."
David S.,"Rialto, CA",0,4,2,5.0,2/9/2016,"I went there 2/8/16 my wife, my son and myself really enjoyed ourselves.  The food was excellent but above everythimg the service was so outstanding I felt like I was being taken care of personaly. Our waitress her name is Maria next time I go there i hope she is working because we will definitely ask to sit anywhere in her section."
