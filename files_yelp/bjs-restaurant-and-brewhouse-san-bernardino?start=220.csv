Ariel L.,"San Bernardino, CA",215,23,20,3.0,2/16/2014,I like this place and Their Jeremiah Red is a really good beer. I got their blackened salmon and it was very good. They put too much caesar dressing in my salad though. Pretty good place to go drink and their beer sampler is a must.
todd w.,"Temecula, CA",0,29,5,1.0,10/8/2015,Have been her several times food has been good in the past however today we arrived at 1130 and I ordered the Alfredo with chicken my pasta was overly al dent and the dish was Luke warm my wife ordered the broccoli cheese soup and a personal size cheese pizza the soup was Luke warm and the pizza was just thrown together and was not very appetizing in appearance come on guys you can do way better not just throw it out there where's the LOVE. Not a happy customer.
Jake M.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",4,127,20,3.0,8/23/2015,It's a decent spot for the area. Their food is good and their beer selection is good. We have been here numerous times and is a decent choice.
Warde M.,"Beaumont, CA",26,94,5,5.0,8/20/2015,Once again lunch at BJ's. The usual outstanding service above & beyond call of duty. Our favorite lunch place. They treat us oldfarts like royalty!
Breanna S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",52,82,4,2.0,6/23/2015,"Well... First off we were seated at a smaller table and upon asking to move we received a bit of an attitude. Once we were moved to a larger table we were told our server would be Melissa. Melissa stopped by about 5 minutes after we were seated and we were told she would be right back. I have worked in the food industry before (from hostess to server) and I know for a fact that there are food runners at BJ's. About 10 minutes and there's Melissa running food out to her table as we sit there without drinks. She finally comes over for our drinks, we tell her what we would like, she asks if we want any appetizers we order two (the calamari and mozzarella sticks) she asks if we're ready to order our meals as well.... UM HM... first you ignore us then you want to rush us? So she brings our drinks a few moments later and we're told our appetizers will be out shortly and that she would bring us some plates (there's six of us at a large table).Well as soon as she said that she would be back with plates our appetizers arrived. We were over half-way through with them before she came back with plates (about 6 minutes and yes I was timing her because I was extremely annoyed with our service). She took our orders asked if we wanted refills and we didn't see her until about 2-3 minutes before our food came out to clear off our empty cups and plates. Our food was decent, not the best I've had from this location, however. Once we were finished with our meals we were asked if we wanted dessert we passed and asked for boxes. The only time she even seemed remotely interested in being our server was when she set the check down (after paying) and told us to enjoy the rest of our day. You cannot provide horrible service and then put the book down and be cheerful at the end of our visit. She received at least the 15% tip but only because we do not dine and not tip.  If she had too many tables or too many guests she should've let someone know and the host or hostess should be instructed how to sit guests accordingly. Having an off day? Let someone know if you can't work through it. We all have bad days but you cannot let it affect your customers. We came down from Lake Arrowhead to enjoy lunch and that really didn't happen.  This was my birthday lunch and I can honestly say I should've gone somewhere else. Overall not happy with our visit to this location and probably will just make the drive to Ontario instead."
Wen R.,"Highland, CA",0,5,,4.0,11/29/2015,We love pizza there  and the pizookie most  famous and yummy.
Behnoush B.,"Bellevue, WA",0,10,,3.0,8/12/2015,Not bad! Just not a bad option when you are in nearby hotels such as Fairfield Inn and do not have many options.
Andrew And Reisa D.,"Folsom, CA",27,63,261,1.0,1/1/2014,Will not be eating at this Bj's probably never again...and it's a sad story too ;( because I really enjoyed this place. But that's what happens. Eventually there's only one way to go: and that's down baby!      Our service was slow and at one point and time very rude. We waited longer for our food than any other time I've ever eaten there with my wife. And here is the kicker: we ate there the night before and the service was awesome. Hey Bj's!! Your service should be awesome no matter what day it is!! You barely made the one star rating :/
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",600,1593,658,3.0,6/13/2012,"I've been coming here for a couple of years now. They are known for their pizza and their pizookies (pizza + cookie... actually its just a baked cookie in a pan with vanilla ice cream on top). Also they have a happy hour which is good, with $5 mini pizzas, good priced appetizers and drinks. While the pizza has been consistent in the past few times I've been here... the pizza I had just wasn't the same. The dough really makes BJ's a distinctive name in sit down pizza chains lol. While it was still a thick crust... it wasn't as soft and buttery as it used to be. Whatever.  Oh! We also got a ahi tuna salad last time I was here. It was good with the vinagrette and the nice amount of tuna slices around. It was big enough to share between 3 people with a good portion. Got a red velvet pizookie which has come to be my favorite. The other flavors are good as well (chocochip, white macadamia, oreo, just to name a few). For a regular size it was good to share between 3 people as well. On your birthday, you get a free pizookie! But again with these apparent changes... where the pizza lost its quality to me, the birthday pizookie has lost its quantity by being a mini size instead of the regular size. Whatever. As for other food, they have a wide variety but from what I have tried, it's nothing amazing. Just regular American fare. They do have a light menu, which looks appetizing but I never actually order anything from there due to my true fatassery...  As for the restaurant it is a very casual American bar like setting. Dim lights, American art everywhere, a big bar and multiple TVs around the restaurant. Service was good, always checking up on us. During the day, this place is pretty chill but by dinner time it could be crowded... I suggest calling in to get a table before your arrival. This is a good place overall, considering the variety of restaurants in the area (which really isn't saying much hahahahaha)."
Mss R.,"Chino, CA",5,46,14,4.0,6/26/2015,The food here is great... And the beer here is great too. For those that drink I love the individual pizzas .. Mediterranean pizza is amazing and a house specialty.  The pizooki is too amazing for words... Never had such a delicious dessert in my life! The service here is good however I have seen inconsistencies
Alex M.,"Loma Linda, CA",10,5,2,2.0,6/25/2015,"Bad service. They gave us plates with debris on it, when asking to have new plates we were given attitude.  Also we ordered spinach dip, the chips were stale. I usually have good service here but because of this instance of service I was compelled to write this review. The server's name is Anthony M."
Roland R.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2015,The food is getting better! It's now something to brag about. However I've come to terms with the fact that the servers are dismissive and unprofessional. So I just order take out now.
Joshua K.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,52,1,4.0,6/21/2015,"I was here with my girlfriend when I just started going out on a date with her. Typical Friday night and was full of people. But was seated quickly and the overall quality of this bjs was very good.  We had some pasta, appetizers, and pizza and it was all well cooked and would love to come back if I had time to come from la to loma linda."
Tara G.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,2,1,5.0,5/6/2016,I would have to say by far the best food and service we could have asked for. We came in on a Friday night for my sons birthday and had a party of 24 people. As we waited for a table because we didn't have reservations they did offer us a slice of pizza while we waited ( an hour) which was not bad for a Friday night walk in with a large party. Service was on point I wish a could remember the two girls that took care of us cause they were on top of everything. Food was great drinks were on point and my son had an amazing time. Thank you guys for the awesome service and great food!!! You guys rocked it!!!
Debbie M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",99,329,95,3.0,7/15/2015,"I'm only giving at 3 stars because of the rude hostesses when I came in the door. There are 5 hostesses... why you need five girls up front is beyond me. And not one of them looked at me. They were all too busy talking to each other. They all ignored me. And same thing on the way out, they did not acknowledge us even walking out the door. At the BJ's where I live, there is always at least one person that says hi to me the second I walk in the door. This was a total turnoff, and believe it or not, it ruined my whole experience. We had a great waitress and great food, but this behavior from the hostesses really turned me off. And for that, I will never come back to this location."
Matt M.,"Colton, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/4/2016,The food and service were great up until the end of the meal. We ordered 2 pitchers of beer and at the end of the 2nd pitcher there was a piece of chewed gum. We had not noticed until after we payed for the meal so it was obviously too late to affect the price of our meal. The bad part was that the manager made no effort at all to right what had happened.
Wayne W.,"Highland, CA",227,296,233,3.0,12/3/2013,"This is the only BJs I've ever been to and I must say...it's one of the most schizophrenic places I've ever been to.  On the one hand, they have a large menu with all kinds of food.  Their food is also very good!  One of their best values is their table for two special that gets you two soups or salads, a really good pizza and a yummmmmy pizookie for dessert!  The beers that they produce are also surprisingly good as well.  I highly recommend their Hopstorm IPA. On the other hand, however, is their quality of service.  For some reason their service always seems to be poor when we are there.  Now....granted...it's a busy social place.  But there always seems to be plenty of waitstaff to go around.  Without exception, they have been slow...forgetful...air headed...even rude sometimes!  A place can have a bad night, sure, but it seems to be every night we come there. Either way...you are taking your chances when coming here.  I'd recommend coming as a small group and seeing what the service is like before bringing a large group for any kind of large celebration.  Honestly...good food can often be soured bad service."
Yvonne C.,"Riverside, CA",1,1,,1.0,5/2/2016,"2nd time I had horrible service! First time I understood more of the reason because there was a server breaking our original server while he was on break, I'm a waitress I totally understand how it feels to have to break a server and be like ""uhh okay let me just hop in where you left off."" But the 2nd time I go I think our servers name was Lisa horrible job! We sat in her section for a while before even getting greeted like I said I am a server also so I know how it feels to be slammed but at least greet your guest and say your a bit busy and you'll be right with us, she wasn't even the one to greet us it was another server with a beard nice guy, he took our drink order & appetizer order both different timings because our server still wasn't around to greet us, by the time she came she said sorry. Cool! No worries.. She takes our order my bf orders something said ""scratch that"" IN that moment she was taking our order and had went with a different dish when the food comes out mine perfect & his was not the original meal he had ordered. Her excuse was ""I'm sorry I remember the pita tacos by memory"" okay??? Your writing our order with a book look down and read what you wrote. Another guest that was behind us the food runner brought there appetizers & food to us. So homegirl needs to learn her tables again that's not a big deal I understand that happens. But it was just the experience her customer service was bad she said she was going to give us a refill and the manger came and did it for us because she kept walking passed us not even saying a thing to us. I'm not saying I'm the best server we all make mistakes but girl at least let me know something I'm very patient all I ask is for you to at least let me know that your a bit busy shows me your acknowledging me but nope. Thank you manager for the discount nice guy you are. But customer service is everything please check that out. I will return again and see how it goes."
Sue M.,"Ontario, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/20/2015,"The food is excellent, particularly the Moroccan Salmon.  Perfectly cooked with a little kick.  Portion size was perfect as well as the side dishes.  Not you typical frozen mixed veggies. Deliciously prepared fresh pickled zucchini over couscous.  The best meal I have had in a long time."
John C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/23/2016,"Very disappointing, we entered at 1135 am and was told it was a 10 minute wait or we could go to the bar. We sat in the bar for 10 minutes before getting a menu. Don't understand why the wait since there was very few customers. We ordered the mini 1 topping pizza with Articokes and Buffalo Chicken Grilled  cheese sandwich. Neither item was that good, the articokes had a funny/funky taste and the buffalo chicken and fries were not hot, it seams that chicken was reheated and not freshly made.  We were disappointed with the food and service that was provided."
