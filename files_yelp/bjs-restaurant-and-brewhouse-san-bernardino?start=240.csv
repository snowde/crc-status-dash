Victor V.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/9/2015,I will not return we were seated at the farthest table but the worst thing was my burnt mahi mahi I was so hungry I ate it anyway overpriced for the quality of food oh and the bathroom stall door did not lock maybe it's just because its San Bernardino
Philip P.,"Winchester, CA",0,14,,2.0,9/22/2015,"I eat here all the time because frankly there are not many good places in San Bernardio to eat at lunch. Usually it is good , but today I had the Fish  & Chips and the fryer oil must have been 5 days old.  The fish and the fries were soaked in burnt grease.  Not very good today.  With that said the service is always fantastic."
Swak J.,"New York, NY",0,12,,5.0,1/10/2015,"We sat at the bar and needless to say, the 2 lady bartenders tonight killed it.  They handled the entire restaurant's dining room and busy game-night bar without a single flub.  Bravo!!  These girls need a raise. Food was great too, along with the BJ branded beers.  We had the Thai mango salad and BBQ chopped salad.  I highly recommend both.     We'll definitely be back!"
Cassadee D.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",113,15,4,3.0,4/19/2015,"I'll give it to them, the food was delicious. Sirloin tips were cooked perfectly, baked potato was great... But it's a brewhouse. We went there specifically to watch the Mariners vs Rangers game and they didn't have the MLB package! For the prices at a brewhouse I would have expected them of all restaurants to cater to the sports crowd."
Paul W.,"Rialto, CA",2,35,11,3.0,7/2/2015,"First time trying this restaurant, I decided to order a small pizza. It was pretty good, but it wasn't very warm when it got to the table. And it got cold really fast. Based on this experience I probably won't be back."
DeWayne F.,"Bend, OR",2,176,43,5.0,8/15/2013,"Ok, I am working and Geocaching in the area and I can walk here fr my hotel. No drinking and driving thank you;) I have eaten here 5 nights in a row and I have not been disappointed yet. Fresh food, hot, not too much salt and the beer selection is over the top.  Bar staff is friendly and not pushy at all. In fact they have made every meal a pleasure.  What a great place."
Michael K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",29,62,12,2.0,12/5/2014,"I usually like BJ's. Worst Calamari I have ever eaten. Limp, soggy and rancid. Manager was cool. Sent a new one. Even worse. Their oils is not hot enough, and they are not changing it often enough. Calamari is an enormously popular appetizer and bar food. Should be one of their signature dishes. Their burger was just ok. About like The Habit, but twice the price."
Angela P.,"Redlands, CA",1,13,,2.0,12/27/2014,"It was my first time visiting BJs and I was super excited to try out the food and experience the service there. Unfortunately I was highly disappointed. The food overall was quite delicious but it could have been warmer! The biggest disappointment was the service. Our waiter, Denise, took to long to approach us at the beginning when we were seated. She did take our order fast but after that she forgot about us. My husband had finished his first drink and needed another to wash it down. We waited about 10 minutes for her to come back to our table and another 5 minutes to relieve the drink. At the end another waiter saw our disappointed faces and asked us if we needed anything and we asked for our check. Our waiter came and gave us our check and I asked for a to go cup. We paid she took our check and never returned with my to go cup. I personally believe customer service is a HUGE factor that determines the quality of a restaurant and BJs needs to improve that."
Tawny D.,"Yucaipa, CA",1,8,7,5.0,8/15/2015,"My Husband and I went to BJ's for lunch this afternoon, it was a little busy, but we got seated right away. Our server was fantastic!!! I want to say her name was Melissa. (I'm terrible with names, but I know it started with a M) anyhow she was awesome!! She got our drinks right out.  A little bit later she brought out my soup & salad but explained there was a mishap in the kitchen and somehow my husbands pizza got lost, but it was in the oven and would be right out. She offered him a salad on the house. He didn't feel like a salad and we told her no problem.  Seriously, 2 seconds later the manager (I assume, he had a blue shirt and dang it I didn't get his name either) but he came to our table and apologized for the mishap, again we told him no worries. He told us if we needed or wanted anything to let our server know and the pizza was on the house, we told him it was no problem and they did not need to do that.  Literally half a min later his pizza came out! And it was perfect!!! They didn't charge us for the pizza as promised. If they hadn't told us that the pizza was lost, we would have never knew and wouldn't have questioned it taking a bit longer because sometimes pizzas take longer.  I was totally impressed with the service and really wanted to take a moment to share! My husband and I work in our family's business (RV repair) and things happen, things get overlooked, things get forgotten, that's all apart of being in business. And one negative thing about Yelp is that people LOVE to run home, hide behind a computer and bash a business because maybe they were busy and their drinks didn't come right out. Or perhaps the greeter was having an off day and didn't smile as expected. Anyways, I wanted to make a point to say we were totally satisfied and impressed with the service we received at BJ's today! Thank you!!!"
Kris E.,"Hayward, CA",209,20,4,2.0,3/27/2016,"My group and I were down here from San Francisco to attend the Self Help Festival at the NOS Center.  We were staying at the Fairfield Marriot right next door and decided to grab a bite to eat.  We waited patiently for seating and within 20 minutes, we were seated.  The table we were seated at was not even cleaned and was still being bussed as we were sitting there surrounded by dirty cocktail glasses.  The bidder came by and apologized, and we were chill.  He was a nice guy.  Made jokes...etc.  We were good.  However, when our server approached us, she spoke softly, had no sense of humor, couldn't catch her name, barely smiled, and seemed very irritated.  I work in the gourmet food industry so I can understand the difficulties that may go on behind the scenes.  Now in continuing with our service, my friend ordered a beer from her.  We waited a good while for the drink, and when she delivered it, she plopped it in front of him swiftly (almost dropping it) and just continued on her way without even acknowledging him.  Us at the table all looked at each other like ""What the hell was that?""  It was almost like she threw it at him.  We also had to wait super long to get refills on our waters.  Our food arrived promptly after ordering so shoutout to your kitchen for being awesome.  Our server had not suggested any entrees or whatnot.  She just basically wrote stuff down. (And yet still forgot to ensure our salad dressing on the side). We are generous tippers when we are welcomed with good service. We almost didn't want to leave a tip at all.  However we still did at about (15%). Cuz we're not complete jerks.  After about a 7 to 9 hour drive, she was a big downer to our vibe. Little advice.  Smile more.  Be personable.  Be friendly.  Be attentive.  Know your product."
Lisa W.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,27,,3.0,3/25/2016,"Good food, the waiters/waitresses are inexperienced and rude. Even the bill came out wrong."
Jugger K.,"San Bernardino, CA",59,40,127,3.0,3/25/2014,My favorite beer is the blonde! $4 beers during happy hour! I won't leave unless I have 2.  I usually have the shrimp Lettuce wraps but they no longer have and that's a extreme bummer those were super good. The mini pizzas are the greatest things ever on happy hour price of $5 heck yeah  This is my normal to go to place for a little kick back dinner and beers.  IM A REPEAT OFFENDER!
Julie E.,"Moreno Valley, CA",8,42,2,4.0,7/8/2013,"I love this location because they have a great selection and are open really late.  They really should advertise at the 66ers games since it's one of the few places open after 11 pm.  Every year we come after games with large groups and they are very accommodating.  The majority of the time we get great service and there aren't any screw ups when the food arrives.  Very hard to do when we have non English speaking people in our group. I normally prefer non-chain restaurants, but this place covers all the bases for fans and players late night dining."
Janine D.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,56,,4.0,3/6/2016,"For a bar and grill, this was great. My husband and I have written some bad reviews lately so writing this one is a joy. We were in the area and finished a golf match and decided to stop, 4 pm on a Saturday. Waiter Sergio at our table with a smile and great attitude. Huge menu. We asked his opinion on a few items. Ordered one he recommended (regular burger vs. bison burger and one (sriracha queso dip with pork chili verde) that he preferred the other chili topping. Both were excellent. The chips with the queso were fabulous. Sergio brought chilled glasses with every bottled beer we ordered. Looking forward to visiting again when we are in the area. So many dishes sounded appetizing."
Jeremy M.,"Ontario, CA",0,6,1,1.0,7/2/2015,"I have been eating at this location for five plus years now and in the last month or so it has gone so down hill. This new male GM is a prick and treats his staff like trash,right in front of the guest . We went into eat like normal and 1 server on with like 12 tables and the poor guy was running like a chicken with his head cut off. The kid server told us I am sorry like 20 times but it's not his fault he can only do what he is told. On 6/30/15 a couple of days ago same thing one Manger female this time and she was just a big of a AHOLE as that male manager food took way to long and she was not helping out her staff at all just yelling staff to move faster. I will be drive to a Rancho Cucamonga from Lake Arrowhead just to avoid this location from now on."
Juan M.,"Grand Terrace, CA",38,35,33,1.0,10/13/2014,"Yet another horrible experience. Let me begin by saying that the only reason that I gave them one star was for the hostesses and servers that have been exceptional when it comes to customer service. The management, both back end kitchen and front end are what drive down the rating to zero stars.  So on to last nights experience. I called in an order for curb-side and was told that curb-side ended at 9pm but that I could order take-out. ""No problem"", I replied. I then asked if they had the 2 for $22 deal which she confirmed they did have. Great. So I ordered our usual, A shareable pizza with easy cheese (lactose intolerant), seasoned tomato and extra sauce. Tortilla soup and caesar salad with a pazookie rounded out our order. We used to come more often but have stopped due to the increased level of poor service.  So off I went to go pick up the food. Then I receive a call from BJ's. The young lady that I just spoken with is now informing me that they no longer have the deal. She then asks if I want to cancel the order or order something else. Bewildered, I ask to speak with a manager. The young man gets on the phone and begins to tell me that the special ended Tuesday (Yesterday, being Friday). I then ask if it is now Friday why his staff has not been informed of the specials or lack there of. He then explains that he will allow me to have the special and repeats again that the special ended Tuesday. Great right? He handled the issue and took care of his customer... not so much. I arrive only to find that they have to remake the pizza order because the chef did not want to add the stewed tomatoes.  I waited another 20 minutes for the the pizza to be remade. Now here is some back story. I order that same pizza all the time. 80% of the time it comes out correctly. I have had it sent back multiple times only to have it be brought back incorrectly again. Easy cheese, Stewed tomato, extra sauce... a classic tomato pie... sounds easy right. One time, while dining with my wife, a good friend of hers and her son I placed the same order. The kitchen manager Horacio brings out the pizza personally to my table. When I tell him that the pizza he brought me is simply a cheese pizza (not even easy cheese at that). His reply was that he could bring me a side of stewed tomatoes to put on top. And then began to argue with me how it is the same thing as baking it with the stewed tomatoes and cheese and top. REALLY, THIS IS YOUR KITCHEN MANAGER!!! It is not the same thing. Should he actually try it sometime, he may actually taste the difference. So back to present day. So here I am waiting for the correct order to be made (Wonder who picks up the tab for all those sent back orders). Not once do I see the front end manager come out. It almost seemed like he was hiding in the back. When I asked to speak to the manager in person he finally surfaced. Believe it or not he begins to tell me that the problem is that the stewed tomatoes don't come on the shareable. SERIOUSLY!!! Now this is why I feel you need a new front end manager as well.  BJ's Restaurant has an app for smart phones that allow you to order ahead. I have used it several times. I encourage BOTH OF THE MANAGERS to follow along on their smartphones as they both, obviously, are in some serious need of training. Ok, so now open the BJ's app. Select curb-side pick up. Choose a shareable hand-tossed build your own. Select the veggies option. And whaaaat... SEASONED TOMATOES ARE AN OPTION for a hand-tossed. To Chris Fernandes, General Manager and Shareholder. Your company location deserves better management than this. You have some excellent workers in your servers and hostesses. But there is only so much they can do without the support of management. I hope that someone takes note of this, as this used to be one of my favorite spots."
Bryant C.,"Highland, CA",19,75,,5.0,4/10/2015,Today is my birthday so the family brought me to BJ's for a late lunch. I could not be more satisfied with both the service we received from our server Cheryl as well as the quality of the food.
Vanessa E.,"San Bernardino, CA",52,32,11,4.0,10/5/2014,Good variety of food and it all taste good. Deff worth the prices. If they make a mistake they are quick to fix it and make up for it by adding a desert or something. Excellent service almost every time. Tried the one in rancho and I would say the sb one is much better
Angie W.,"San Bernardino, CA",77,1,1,4.0,4/8/2014,"Restrooms were not amazing, however Kristy was super friendly, and was on top of things! When appetizer took longer than it should, it was removed from Bill without us asking.we had a great time!"
Devin R.,"Manchester, NH",14,98,37,3.0,12/5/2013,"BJs is ok. It's a good place to catch the game...a lot of TVs, and a nice bar. The servers are typically pretty distracted, so the service is kind of slow.  This is type of chain restaurant that has an enormous menu ( a la Elephant Bar or Cheesecake Factory), but nothing is particularly memorable. Gets the job done when you have low expectations for the evening."
