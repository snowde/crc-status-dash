Leticia A.,"Riverside, CA",10,25,42,1.0,8/6/2014,"Today's bartenders were ABSOLUTELY rude. They took forever to take our order and to cash us out (about 20 mins for each). The place wasn't busy (at all) they were just ignoring us!!! I have never been treated this badly at a restaurant. I wish I knew their names, but they didn't even bother to introduce themselves to us. We frequent this restaurant about once a week, and have never had these two girls as our bartenders (a red head and a brunette). Our entire group (filled with bartenders and waitresses) have never had this type of service before. We will no longer be coming to this location."
Sedna M.,"Yucaipa, CA",123,81,30,3.0,11/9/2014,Always busy but they have a large variety menu. Most of the staff is very friendly.  The food and dronks are consistant not gourmet food but you can always count on the same quality every time. The bar has a huge tv we go to watch the games and just relax
Giovanni O.,"Riverside, CA",24,19,19,2.0,1/21/2013,"Food was okay and the SERVICE was HORRIBLE!!! Here's what i ordered... Appetizer: Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms - pretty good Soup: Piranha pale ale chili - NEVER CAME :( Meal: Ordered Great White pizza in thin crust: a little dry Desert: Red Velvet Pazookie - NEVER CAME :( So I went here with my wife. We were served by some guy whose name escapes me. Well, we ordered an appetizer, soup and pizza. I got my pizza but not the pizza. So when I was half way done with the pizza, and realized the soup was not coming, I let our server know i didn't get the soup. He apologized of course. I told him i'd rather get a desert (pazookie) instead. So he encouraged to get the red velvet. So hey, we ordered it. Well, later on in the meal he comes with our bill and goes on a break.  The dude forgot two orders! Really? It wasn't even packed."
Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",416,873,603,4.0,12/16/2012,"I've been eating at this BJs since about the time it opened.  I'm a fan of BJs, overall.  I usually don't go 4 stars on a chain restaurant, but I love that BJs has an AWESOME beer selection and a huge menu with a big selection.  Some of my favorite things are that they have this section of small plates.  Super affordable and yummy little dishes so you can order a couple and have a few different tastes.  YEA!   Every restaurant should do this!  They have some amazing salads; I like the Market Veggie salad.  The pastas are tasty; I had the Cajun Pasta, which I have had several times and enjoy: spicy and the chicken is always cooked really nicely and moist.  The pizzas are good, but I rarely order those.  There is so much from which to choose from mac and cheese to steak and seafood.  The only thing I have not liked was when they first opened, I did not like the bun on the burger; I thought it tasted BAD.  Haven't tried a burger since. This location has always given me good service whether I'm sitting at or in the bar area or in the dining area. It's clean.  It's got good ambiance.  I'll be back and I'd recommend it!"
Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",231,590,1953,5.0,12/1/2012,"This is a regular stop for me and my friends to celebrate our birthdays because you get a free pizookie!  The pizookie is reason enough to come in (fresh baked cookie with scoop of ice cream) and now they even have a red velvet cookie, but we stuck with our traditional chocolate chip.  Yums!  In addition, they have lots of lunch specials.  I really enjoy their soups, especially the chicken noodle, chicken tortilla, and minestrone.  Great service at this location too."
Lisa P.,"Yucaipa, CA",31,16,2,5.0,3/1/2016,The food and service is awesome. We had the deep dish  pizza  and the blackened  chicken with black  beans  off the low  calorie  menu...chicken was to die for!!
Karen T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,9,1,1.0,1/3/2015,"Visited this location on January 3rd. We called to make a reservation for 15 people 20 minutes prior to our arrival. We were told by the hostess that  we wouldn't need a reservation and that we could walk in. We were told there wasn't a wait either. Upon arriving we told the hostess, Valeria, that we were a party of 15 and she rudely told us that there is a wait. There were about 8-10 people waiting to be seated. No apologies whatsoever. The manager told us that they do in fact take reservations for parties of 15. Again, the hostess never apologized and had such a rude demeanor. The manager Mike was more than helpful and apologetic, the saving grace of this location. I still won't be coming back and I will be sending a complaint to corporate."
Jonathan M.,"Loma Linda, CA",360,1,,1.0,6/6/2015,"I celebrated my 21st birthday at BJ's and the food was great. I ordered a pizza with a drink and it was enjoyable. However, I am giving them one star due to their customer service. As we were paying our bills, my total comes out to be $26. I told our waitress Patricia G. that I was going to pay with $23 in cash and wanted the rest on my debit card because I only had $20 remaining in my card, which would not have been sufficient to pay my bill. When she came back with our tabs, I noticed that my card was fully charged $26 (the charge took some of money from my savings account) and none of my bills were in the tab. She claims that she did not see any cash in my tab. I was confused because the cash was securely and visibly tucked underneath the card. I am not sure if the money fell out of the tab or she took the money (which I am just saying could be just a possibility, I am not accusing her of theft). They ended up taking the pizza off the bill and just charging me for the drink.  At the end, I still lost money. It was definitely not a pleasant experience, especially for a birthday celebration. I just wanted to let everyone know to be aware of your payment and make sure that the host charges correctly. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I definitely will not be coming back."
Veronica R.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,5,,2.0,7/19/2014,"We tried the fried stake with mashed potatoe. It honestly didnt hAve flavor, it could had used more salt, or something. They service was ok as well, it seemed more of trying to get us to eat and leave and not much of customer service"
Walter C.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/22/2016,"Ask for kristin, her wonderful energy, charming personality, and excellent recommendations, will make it well worth your vist. Thanks kristin ( i hope i spelled her name right)."
Joana F.,"Fontana, CA",335,176,315,5.0,1/17/2013,"BJ's is always a wonderful place to have dinner on a whim. I usually order the California Chicken Sandwich and ask for Jalapeños and Ranch on the side ... absolutely DELICIOUS! Since I've been trying to eat healthy, BJ's has a wonderfully tasty salmon entree as well as a mahi mahi dish that is served over rice pilaf and a side of steamed veggies! Love their Guilt-Free drinks as well!"
Will Y.,"Chino Hills, CA",19,121,2,4.0,6/20/2013,"My favorite joint for a satisfying lunch without busting my budget or my belt. The one I always order here is their lunch special; salad (substitute fries), soup and sandwich for a holy matrimony $8.10!  The tortilla soup is out of this world. The grilled chicken sandwich fresh and tasty. The caesar salad is not the best I've had, but above average grade for sure."
Heidi L.,"Beaumont, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Horrible service. Took orders from people who arrived after us, people got there food way after we ordered. Ridiculous! Had to give it one star because I had no choice."
Tyler W.,"Saint Paul, MN",6,14,1,3.0,12/16/2014,"Service was okay, a little too hover-y for me. The beer selection was good, but difficult to know what was on tap with the menu missing half their craft options. I had the ribeye which ended up charred out the outside yet undercooked. The atmosphere was great and the place is still a solid dinner option."
Krishelle H.,"Redlands, CA",110,110,70,2.0,4/20/2014,"BJ's, more like BS. Avocado rolls are always great and is the ONLY thing that keeps me coming back.  The Bartender yesterday afternoon (4/19/2014) was the worst.  She barely greeted us, then continued to ignore us.  We had two choices, sitting at either end of the bar, wrong choice was sitting at the servers end.  OMG, they all  stand there chatting and gossiping loudly.  I learned that it was some guys first day, how to tip out the bartender and a whole host of things I did NOT come here to listen to.  She never really took our order, I literally had to just shout it at her while she was pouring beer at the tap.  I watched her punch in my order and then put the receipt in the glass, I asked her if she got James' chicken wraps, Chicken wraps?  Yes, the ones we are trying desperately to order...blank stare.  Our food came out hot and was great.  James asked for more mustard and some girl did a drive bye with it and DROPPED it in front of me, what the F*%k ever.  After we ate our plates sat there....and sat there, I got so sick of it, I finally just PRE-BUSSED them myself, what a joke.  Here are reasons why people go out; atmosphere, so we DON'T have to listen to kids chatter (servers were worse than our four teenage boys), service, and not doing the dishes.  All we got was good food, it takes more than that to have a good experience for me."
Dennis P.,"Highland, CA",0,48,,4.0,11/20/2015,We do go there frequently even though it is always way to noisy.  I just call a manager and whine about the loud music and they will turn it down.  It has always been way to loud so just complain.
Hayley B.,"Highland, CA",17,11,15,3.0,9/29/2014,"Came here for the first time with my bf's fam and it was 'okay'. We had gotten a pizza to share with the whole family. Idk why everyone else says the food is good cause it's really not all that, always boring and plain. This last time we went here for my bf's coworker's bday and my food, shrimp scampi, was so bland, flavorless, and just not good at all. Very disappointed because I love shrimp scampi :( I did however LOVE the sante fe spring rolls! Those r amazing! So if I were to come here again that's probably the only thing I'd be getting..TO GO. Bf said the bartenders were rude too"
Mel L.,"Castro, San Francisco, CA",14,90,91,3.0,7/4/2014,"Love the pazookies, lettuce wraps, pizza and beer. Go for happy hour (M-T 3-7 AND 10-CLOSE) for the best deals."
Eric O.,"Colton, CA",17,108,1,2.0,10/14/2012,"This place used to be better. I ordered a California chicken sandwich which comes with avocado, however, it came with a watered down guacamole paste. Totally was not appealing.  Also, another person order a pizza with pepperchini's and was given pickles instead.  They must think the customer is really stupid to let this stuff slide.  Needless to say the server only asked if we wanted to order something else instead of rectifying the situation. Service was also lacking as once the order was placed the server disappeared. I still like the multiple tv's, but I could just go to a sports bar which would be cheaper and get the same experience."
Joyce F.,"Redlands, CA",8,17,,3.0,1/1/2016,"I was there at 7:30pm Dec 31, 2015. Food was good though portions small and service excellent. Football game on the big screens  excellent. I am only giving 3 stars because they allow vagrants to sit on bench right outside the restaurant and panhandle. I find this disturbing and unsafe. I won't go back."
