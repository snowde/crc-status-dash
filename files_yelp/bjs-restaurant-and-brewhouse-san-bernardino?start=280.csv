Jenny C.,"Redlands, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/28/2012,"The two stars are only for one thing: the red velvet Pizookie. Everything else, especially the service, need serious improvement. We come here about a couple times a month because the food is pretty awesome, the Pizookies are to die for, and my husband loves the Abby Normal seasonal beer that is sometimes available in a bottle by request in the off season (I believe it is a spring time seasonal beer) Anyway, there has only been one or two visits that we have had decent service. Every other time, it has SUCKED. We came one Sunday afternoon at 2 pm for my birthday. We called ahead the day before to let them know we wanted to have a party of about 10-12 people the next day. They assured us that it would be no problem, especially in the mid afternoon, not peak lunch/dinner times. Unfortunately, that was not the case. We spent a total of 4 hours there and maybe saw our waiters (I'm not even sure how many we had, we ended up just flagging down whoever was close by when we needed something, that's how bad it was) about 3 times. People in our party arrived all within a 15 minute window, but no one's drink was brought until our appetizers arrived, and we were all thirsty. I can't believe that with all the people ""serving"" us no one could get waters for anyone. It's not hard. I can understand beers or mixed drinks taking a bit at the bar, but water? Come on. Entrees were arriving sporadically, even though we all ordered at the same time. Some were finished eating completely before others even got their meals. Nothing was complicated, just basic pizzas off the menu and a few burgers. It was absurd how little attention was paid to us and how long we were there. My husband complained to the main waitress that was serving us after asking her for the third time for a water refill and she said ""OK, but we are all doing our best here to serve you, please be patient."" Ok lady, we have been pretty patient, considering I was ready to get up and leave after the 30 minute wait for appetizers and drinks. We don't have all day to spend waiting for lunch/dinner, be reasonable. I don't even think she believed herself when she said she was ""doing her best."" In the end I got a free personal red velvet pizookie so I was happier, but still disappointed overall. The added gratuity for our large party was just a pain in the ass since the servers really didn't do anything to earn it.  We continued to return after that experience and unfortunately it has not improved, maybe even gotten worse. Lots of people standing around when it's busy and customers need service. They just don't seem to have consideration for customer's time. We always spend way too long waiting and I don't want to spend my entire day in a restaurant for dinner. More than 2 hours from entrance to exit is too long when there isn't a sporting event to watch. Get some more attentive wait staff and this place would be 5 stars. The food is too good not to return and I consider myself a patient person which is why I seem to endure the torture of the horrid service. I plan on complaining to the manager if our next visit is anything like our recent ones."
L M.,"Peninsula, CA",1,27,,5.0,8/15/2014,"We had a good time at happy hour on a Thursday night. Got there just after work and there was plenty of room at the bar area. Our waitress came by quick, got us our drinks and took good care of us the rest of the night. They had some local brews (Ritual) and semi local ones (Lost Abbey). Overall I have no complaints and will come again for happy hour!"
Carlyn T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",28,84,9,4.0,7/12/2014,"One of my favorite pizza joints. I don't like olives and green bell peppers but on the veggie pizza they were tasty. Only complaint was that getting a glass of water, I had to ask twice and it didn't come until after other beverages were given to the table. Also recommend the beers, burgers, and avocado eggrolls."
Sarah S.,"San Bernardino, CA",11,25,1,3.0,3/29/2014,"I had to interrupt the hostess' conversation to get seated. When I sat with my party (I joined them a little late) I was not offered a drink. I sat without anything for a good 15 minutes. When I finally was able to order a drink and my food, I went another 5-10 without a drink. My friend actually had to remind our server that I didn't have one. Sure, we were a large group. Food was good. Food was served out very quickly. Customer service just ruined it."
Jeeper G.,"Arcata, CA",0,131,40,2.0,2/9/2014,"Usually I like this place, but my recent trip in for lunch left me wondering. The waitress took our order, and then we did not see her again for over 30 minutes.  Someone came buy and dropped off a soup and salad, but no drink refills, etc. in that 30 minutes. Finally, I see the waitress and flag her down and ask about lunch.  She scampers off and returns a few minutes later with our food.  It had obviously been sitting at the waitress station.  The food was luke warm at best. I would have sent it all back, but there's only so much time that can be spent on lunch. Hopefully, this was a fluke and just a bad waitress.  Normally, this place is 3 stars, and sometimes even 4.  But this visit, it did not merit even a 3."
Heath W.,"Hemet, CA",18,5,,5.0,7/1/2014,I come here mainly for the pizza's and their own craft beers of course!!  Plenty of tv's just wish they had sound for the games!!  :-)
Dwight C.,"Hemet, CA",140,233,76,3.0,6/24/2012,Food ok but not exceptional as would be anticipated Pizza all crust very little filling. Prices are upper end.  Not the best chain resturantn
Steven H.,"Murrieta, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/2/2014,Waiting for over an hour for the food.. orders wrong... But Excell at refills on drinks while waiting and waiting. Two hours now. Officially never eating here again.
Brodaeous M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",25,54,,2.0,12/27/2011,"This BJ's is not like the one in Moreno Valley or Chino. This one had very slow service and the pizza was sub-par. I typically only get their ""works"" pizza, so am fairly familiar with how it typically is at other BJ's. The other BJ's are better."
John G.,"Loma Linda, CA",76,2,,5.0,10/24/2015,"I have been coming to BJ's in San Bernardino for over a year and frequent I this establishment several times per week. The food is great but the employees are much better always there with a smile on their faces, always willing to help and I enjoy coming here for them. The management team lead by Brian, an with Vera, Mike and Mark have changed this place from being ok to fantastic. I love the bartenders, Aimee, Kristi, my two favorites, along with Sable, Tiffany, Erick, Crystal and Jaime are all fantastic, friendly and very knowledgable of their duties and people skills. Thank you all for always taking care of me"
Denise W.,"Highland, CA",12,24,,4.0,3/19/2014,We came here the other day to celebrate a birthday. There were about 20 of us. The waiters could have been friendlier. The food was pretty good as usual! Thee best pizza and spaghetti!
Ralph O.,"Chino Hills, CA",253,620,67,4.0,6/20/2012,"Wow, second time to a BJ's restaurant in 3 days!  No it is not my favorite restaurant but I do like their food.  I came here with the coworkers to celebrate birthdays. I got the sesame chicken salad (formerly known as the Asian chicken salad).  It was delicious even though there were no green pieces of cabbage (yes I know cabbage is mostly white but even KFC's cole slaw isn't completely white!).   Service was great, they each gave us our own bill and didn't charge a mandatory tip for our table of nine. Good place to go for large groups."
Mike G.,"Colton, CA",0,16,10,4.0,2/14/2015,"Depends heavily on the server.  I've had 5star and 2star experiences.  Food is generally good. Have had good experiences with management.  Nice atmosphere, as long as you aren't looking for a quiet place."
Mark M.,"Riverside, CA",79,207,2,3.0,3/4/2015,"Not bad. Not Great. But not bad. The lunch specials are really good. A personal pan pizza (very tasty) and a big salad for $7.00 I think?  Very tasty. Cold Sam Adams on tap. I think it deserves a 3.5 for lunchtime value over-all. Maybe a lunchtime beer special would put me at a 4 Star...come on....you can drop a buck off a beer for an extra star and still come out ahead BJ's. I saw the bad server reviews here, didn't get that. Ours was good. There's a lot of kids standing around as hostesses...maybe they could run food for these disgruntled. Seriously there were like 4 girls right out of high school greeting people. They can't run beer but they can throw down a plate of fries. Okay, we get it...BJ's has cute girls at the entrance!!!  This ain't Hooters and the servers are running their butts off. Now get your ass back to the kitchen and help run those nachos so the servers don't hate you."
Emilie N.,"La Jolla, CA",335,14,22,4.0,8/10/2012,"A few friends and I went here for a social for our class, so we made reservations in advance. Okay, more than a few because there were around 25 of us. BJ's staff was extremely accommodating by allowing us to have that many people in addition to offering split checks. I don't know about you, but I've noticed that a few places abhor you if you ask to split checks, especially with a large group! They include 17% gratuity for parties greater than 6, but that's only a little more than the usual 15% that you normally tip, and they deserved it after treating us so well and being so attentive. As for the food, it was good, but nothing too memorable. We shared pizzas (white and Mediterranean) which were both tasty and filling. However, the pizookies is where it is at! We shared two smalls among four people, and that was more than enough! A few friends also got a plate of three mini pizookies, which was an awesome idea. So, good (service and dessert). If you've never had a pizookie, you have been extremely deprived in the dessert department. Bad (food isn't shockingly delicious, but it isn't horrible either)"
Brian B.,"Bronx, NY",17,139,193,4.0,6/30/2010,"After being at the beach, at USC, and in traffic all damn day on the way back to my hotel, I decided I didn't want to drive far for dinner so I walked right across the parking lot into BJ's.   I was starving, which means I usually crave a beer.  So I ordered the BJ's PM Porter.  The bartender had let me sample the Porter and the Tatonka Imperial Stout.  The Porter has a very deep coffee/roasted flavor and went down smooth.  After that first taste, I noticed it was a nitro beer, and ordered my pint!  The Tatonka Imperial Stout, however, was carbonated, so I opted for the PM!  The porter was very sweet and smelled great.  As for food, I went with the Parmesan crusted chicken with lemon sauce, potatoes, and broccoli.  Again, I was starving, so I devoured the plate.  The chicken was crusted to perfection.  Maybe I loved this dish because of the fact that I hadn't eaten in over eight hours. The place looks very dark and almost rustic with many seats at the bar and high chair seating just behind the bar stools. The bartender was really awesome and very polite and hooked me up with a pint glass to-go!  Yeahhhhh, buddy!"
Gary G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,25,17,3.0,1/25/2013,"I got my food to go with curb side pick-up. Unfortunately, I had to get out of my car to pay because they only do curb side pickup until 9pm. Oh well, I guess the exercise walking in couldn't hurt. One thing to note: 2 cars were taking up 2 of the 3 curb side spots. When I mentioned this to the employee helping me she said, ""yeah, they aren't supposed to park there.""  I ordered a tortilla soup, large grilled chicken caesar salad and a mini pepperoni pan pizza. The total came out to $28.90. Not too bad. The service was good and the food was good also. However, the tortilla soup was a bit on the spicy side. I gave them 3 stars because the food and service was acceptable for the price."
Nia B.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,20,,2.0,12/24/2014,"The food at BJ's is usually good but the service always seems to disappoint. Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and they brought out the wrong kind, and not only that but even the waiter said the pizza looked kind of nasty. Then it took a very long time for our correct order to come out. This is the second time in a month that I have had a bad experience with BJ's and their service.!"
Christian M.,"Hemet, CA",14,34,13,4.0,5/16/2014,Buffalo barbecue burger is generally off the charts good. This time a little dry but still fairly good. For 10 bucks not bad at all.
BrYnell W.,"Philadelphia, PA",376,46,15,5.0,7/5/2013,"The Sevice was good and fast. Please make appointments before coming out to this reaaly up-beat and Lively  Brewhouse& Restaurant. I had the An American original! Lean, ground buffalo, boldly seasoned then grilled to order. Topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce. Served with tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinaigrette and topped with green onions. "" FANTASTIC"".   Greatness found in a Brewhouse  All at this very popular SPOT!  Come out and Enjoy with friends or family....."
