Leonard M.,"Palm Desert, CA",49,20,13,5.0,7/1/2013,"Stopped by here after a fun fill day at Splash kingdom. The place was packed, however the service, the food, and the ambiance was excellent. I had the Jambalaya and my kids had pizza and mini dogs. Again, all the food was really good and the service was great! Definitely will return!"
Justme O.,"Fontana, CA",0,49,1,1.0,12/28/2013,Was here on dec 28 and had to ask the hostess for a server. We finally got Erick as our server and was horrible we never got our water and drinks then he came to tell us he was going home and that another girl was going to help us. She was the one who brought our drinks and btw the entire time we were eating he was still working and helping other tables.

Sonia L.,"Redlands, CA",53,144,4,3.0,8/4/2011,"A few reasons I gave this place 3 stars. I kept giving a star and taking one away and so on... I stopped in here for lunch with some fellow students of mine the other day. When we arrived, the place was relatively empty. We were seated rather quickly (yay). Then we sat for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged and our order taken (boo). Then we waited 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive (boo). Then less than one minute later, our entree arrived (boo). Sounds bad? well the story goes on (lets be optimistic shall we?). I was kinda impatient as I sometimes can be. But in all honesty I was all ready in the restaurant for 40 minutes and had not even tasted one thing! I was sad :(  so i asked to speak to the manager. He was quickly ushered over by our server. I explained our situation and he was BEYOND gracious in apologizing and such. He said he would comp. my tomato and mozzarella salad (which was fabulous!)  Then something else happened... He returned less than five minutes later to explain that the kitchen was backed up with salads (?) . Sounded.... believable...????  He then said he then offered us dessert on the house. I am not big into sweets, but... The pizookie trio was, how shall I say this without wetting myself?... Kinda like a sweet ""O"" in my mouth. The red velvet pizzookie was nice. The Oreo pizzookie was even better. The white chocolate macadamia pizzookie has made me a believer in desserts once again! That stuff was great!!!  One of my friends had the stuffed mushroom appetizer that we shared (that was lovely). I ordered the gluten-free thin cheese pizza. That was the weirdest pizza I ever tasted. I still can't put my finger on it. We all tried it and agreed that it was indeed weird. It  was bland and can only be compared to a frozen pizza (a a bad one at that). Or a piece of cardboard that was put in the oven and topped with cheese (YIKES!). I would definitely steer clear of that concoction. Our bill arrived and we were stunned to find that our bill was say rather TINY... I wont say what or how much was given to us (after all, I would like to be polite and gracious). It was far beyond what was promised and we left with fat smiles and giggles (yes, i really did giggle). The manager is my new BEST FRIEND (ok not really, but he is a cool dude).  Definitely will come back to try some of the vegetarian selections (oh and lets not forget the beer). So three stars it is! Give and take on this review..."
Terry J.,"Carmichael, CA",1,21,,2.0,8/16/2015,"My wife and I stayed at the Residence Inn which is a short walk to BJ's.  We went there late on a Friday evening (8/14/2015).  Seated promptly, Kristen came and took our drink orders promptly.  We ordered our food and it went downhill from there.  My wife ordered the scampi pasta (spaghetti, all chopped up) and I ordered the jambalaya which was luke warm at best.  Didn't come around to refill drinks.  Refilled my coffee after I asked when we were given the bill.  Although convenient, there are too many other restaurants nearby that we will try when we return."
Kay L.,"San Bernardino, CA",40,211,123,2.0,1/2/2014,"Went today and I had a BJs Special pizza and stuffed mushrooms. So, I have to say that the service was fine. No complaints at all BUT I feel that the food has gone greatly downhill. I used to LOVE BJs and the deep dish pizza was always worth the cost. Today, $15 for a small pizza was NOT worth it. It kind of tasted like Pizza Hut with thicker crust and better quality toppings... but still extremely unimpressive and overpriced for the taste. The stuffed mushrooms were... gag! I paid about $45 for the small pizza, a mini pizza, the mini appetizer mushrooms and 2 sodas. Not worth it for the taste of the food. Too bad because I used to really love the pizza here about 2 years ago :("
Heather V.,"Riverside, CA",31,17,1,2.0,10/28/2013,"Let me start by saying, I love BJ's Restaurants.   I have been to this location twice, first time was a complete disaster and second time was just alright.   1st time:  Our server was unfriendly and not really interested in making sure we had a good time.  We ordered the calamari app, it was greasy, and tasteless.  We also shared a pizza, my favorite pizza, The Great White.  that was delicious, as always!  We also made a point to ask our server to make sure to wait on ordering our pizza because we wanted to enjoy our app first but to our surprise and we took our first bite of the calamari, here comes our pizza.  Ugh, really?!?  She did apologize but didn't ask if we wanted a new one or for even to be warmed up and brought out later.  Whatever, the calamari sucked so we dug into the pizza.  We were going to order dessert but decided to relax a minute first.  That's when it went from eh to let's get the heck out of here!  I used the women's restroom and was completely disgusted.  First off, our server came out as I was going in, so she saw how gross it was and we found out later did nothing about it.  One stall was so gross you couldn't use, another was occupied, and the last one was horrible!  Toilet not flushed, toilet paper everywhere, and then blood all over the ground and seat.  I immediately left and ask the hostess to have the manager come over.  When I told her everything about the evening and then the condition of the restroom her reply was ""Oh really, the girls up front are supposed to clean it.""  Really?  You are a manager, don't pass the blame.  Apologize and try to keep our business.  She never said sorry for anything.  We didn't want our meal free or even a discount.  It was crazy how it didn't seem to effect her in any way.   2nd time:  The ONLY reason I went back is because my dad got a gift card for his bday and we didn't want to drive to the Redlands location (we should have though) on a Sunday night.  This time wasn't as bad though.  We received our food in a timely manner and it was pretty good.  I just wish our server was a little more excited to help us out.  Not one smile from her that night.   My tip is just to avoid this location completely!"
Gabriel C.,"Petaluma, CA",105,32,5,5.0,4/9/2014,This is the best service I have EVER had at a bj's location. Our server Vance was the best!!!!! Better service than we are used to in thousand oaks....
Elvera 1.,"Running Springs, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/12/2015,"We went here after my sons baseball game.  I had never been... I was surprised by the food!!! The menu is giant!!! Salad, pizza, tacos, burgers, everybody in our party was satisfied!!! I have to say the service was amazing, if you dine at this restaurant ask for David!!! He knows the menu, helpful, patient, attentive, funny, and super nice!!!"
Ciara K.,"Yucaipa, CA",13,89,41,5.0,12/27/2013,Tuna and strawberry mijito every time and I'm happy! The buffalo chicken pizza awesome too
J D.,"Barstow, CA",1,6,,4.0,7/4/2014,"Came in for a last minute family lunch for the holiday, good service, we did a lot of talking and the server was consistent with refilling all of our drinks. Food wise everything was great and the pazookies are a must have."
Karen T.,"Yucaipa, CA",28,29,5,3.0,9/13/2014,"The Hostess was so sweet and friendly.  Our Server was incredibly attentive.  The food was delicious, as always.  The only negative is that TWO employees pulled up and parked in two of the four, posted ""To Go Pick Up Only"" spots, while we were waiting for our table, and after we left...2 hours later.  WOW."
Kelvin Z.,"Fontana, CA",0,29,3,1.0,4/26/2014,"This place is absolutely ridiculous. We tried to make a reservation for six but they told us they couldn't unless it was seven or more. Then they told us we could call ahead and to do so 30 minutes before we wanted to be seated. We called half an hour before we got there. When we got there,  it was pointless to have called ahead. They told us we had to wait over an hour or longer. When we told the hostess that we called ahead, she didn't care. This reflects poorly on the chain and management's lack of hospitality in a hospitality industry. Also the lack of caring and customer service is unprofessional. They won't even care that this review is poor. Why would they? That would require a professional management team and company."
The Foood L.,"Denver, CO",74,8,8,4.0,3/1/2012,"Giant stuffed potato!! that's definitely a way to go for BJs for me :) Love the  casual setting of this place.. always go for the booth with my husband they have a nice service.. and of course open til late.. so over all.. i love this place, the service and the food they give here.. don't forget to order their famous Pizookie.. yummy..."
Liz T.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",249,216,120,4.0,10/16/2011,"The service at this BJ's is always dreadfully slow, whether they are busy or not. But the pizza always comes out piping hot and my Jerryburst (Jeremiah Red + Berry Burst Cider) is always nice and cold. The happy hour isn't too bad: Half off mini pizzas $2 off  beers $1 off cocktails As far as the food goes, I really like the way this particular BJ's does their Bacon Cheeseburger pizza. It sounds like a horrible combination, but this BJ's really makes this pizza tasty (pickles and all!). It has everything you're not supposed to eat wrapped up in one carby bit of goodness.  Perhaps it's the nostalgia of all the 21st birthdays I've been to at this BJ's, but something about this BJ's keeps bringing me back. This is definitely one of my favorite spots when I come to visit my IE pals."
Clinton B.,"Beaumont, CA",5,86,4,4.0,1/30/2014,"Great food, though service could be improved. I should not have to wait ever, let alone the 15 minutes it took the server to get my drink refilled! A refill should be brought when my drink gets half empty."
Cathy S.,"Redlands, CA",38,74,20,5.0,1/4/2012,"We had a group of 15 on a Wednesday night and it was a treat for us all!  It was the week of Christmas and the place was packed but they were very attentive to us and our needs and the drinks and food came out in good time and tasted great. I had the Grilled Pork Chops with Garlic Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and they were fantastic!  Tender, juicy and really great flavor.  Just yummy! Others had the burgers which they raved about, the pizza's looked awesome and my picky grand daughter loved her dinner. All in all it was a great night, good food, good service!"
Tony S.,"Redlands, CA",4,16,8,1.0,12/27/2013,Have not come back for 5 years due to poor service. 5 years later service is still woefully lacking.
J C.,"Seattle, WA",110,46,,4.0,1/30/2012,"I've been to this BJ's multiple times and I'm not even from here!  Being from Seattle, we only have 1 BJ's and it's all the way in Southcenter, so I don't make it there that often (or  at all).  So whenever I'm in town visiting the gf, I try to make it here.  Large TV's, cold beer, deep dish pizza...what else does a guy need?  I haven't ran into horrible service (at least not that I can think of).  The beers are so-so (again, I'm from Seattle, so I'm a beer snob).  The deep dish pizza is amazing (although the last time I was there they didn't serve it in an actual ""deep dish"").  And if you have room for a piezookie, well, those are pretty ridiculously awesome as well. Some people hate these large chain restaurants, but I love 'em.  The best is when they do their 2 for $20 deals (salad, pizza, piezookie for 2 people, $20), but it's rare."
Gloria L.,"San Marcos, CA",14,26,9,5.0,1/13/2014,Large party of 25 and no reservation. They seated us quickly and the staff was incredible and efficient. Food was great. Service awesome!
