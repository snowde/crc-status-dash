Mike H.,"Visalia, CA",168,114,525,2.0,9/23/2011,"was in a group of 10. Food was good, price is great,Service is really slow.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad, got the salad, asked for the soup, asked for the soup, asked for the soup, asked for the soup,asked for the soup, asked for the soup, asked for the soup, asked for the soup, they brought the bill, I asked if the they were having trouble shelling the clams, a few minutes later they brought the soup. Each time i asked they said it would be right out. I guess since the tip was included, they felt they could give lousy service."
Lachelle I.,"San Bernardino, CA",168,163,306,2.0,6/24/2013,"Awful service awful but good food, even told manager about awful device he said I'll take off the pax police which is like $5 I told him I don't want that I want you to talk to your staff! He acted like we wanted a free meal or something! Grrrr! I want a waitress who doesn't walk past you 100 times without asking you if you're ok or need a refill or want dessert or ANYTHING! I love the jambalaya & tortilla soup but hate the service they're either rude or other times way understaffed its apparent they need more staff or people will stop coming because while the food is good, most people don't like waiting 2 hours for a refill, an hour for the check, then an hour for them to return with your credit card, not to mention good luck if you want a condiment! You'd have to trip them as they pass you buy"
Taylor H.,"Redlands, CA",61,90,43,5.0,10/23/2013,Great place to grab a homebrew (in my case a rootbeer) and watch your team win (hopefully)...
Matt M.,"Fresno, CA",42,436,48,3.0,8/22/2011,"Great pizza, funky beers.   Their cheese pizza is arguably the best I've ever eaten.  It's simply incredible.  The pizzookie (or however you spell it) is pretty effin amazing. The beers kinda suck but since I don't drink much it's not a big deal to me."
Teo M.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/7/2014,"This is my first time in San Bernardino.  I regularly frequent The BJ breweries in San Diego county, including the ones in La Jolla, Escondido and Mission Valley.  I sat at the bar and the red headed bartender girl  was very attentive to all my needs.  I  like This chain in general but have to admit the crispy calamari I ordered was kinda oily and did not look like the pictures of it in the menu.  The Santa Fe rolls I ordered were good and the chicken potstickers were good too.  Overall pleased with the bar tending service and experience overall."
Brandon L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",48,72,12,4.0,8/6/2011,"One of those places that keeps me coming back. Why? The Pizookie is one glaring reason. It's nearly impossible to resist ordering one. It might be my favorite dessert of all time. But I digress... I'm a huge fan of their grilled chicken pasta. I order it with a house salad and it satisfies every time. I've also tried their pizza, which is Chicago-style and instead of having sauce, has tomato chunks decorating the surface. It's quite an interesting change from the usual pizzas one finds, and luckily it's a delicious variation as well. I can also heartily recommend any of their burgers since the meat is exactly the kind of quality you expect. I'm personally not too keen on their french fries, but many people I know like them. They're more than decent, it's just I prefer mine to be a little thicker.  The prices here are fair, the music is sometimes great (think glorious 80s new wave stuff), and overall it's a very fun place to eat."
Giao T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",42,289,315,3.0,5/16/2011,"From reading all the comments, it looks like there's a real problem with their service.  However, I didn't experience any problems on this particular weekend with any of the servers or their level of service.   If anything, it was busy.  We managed to get there just a couple of minutes before several families arrive and a large ""call ahead"" birthday party of 25+ people.  We were seated promptly and our server took our drink orders.  That came pretty quick and I needed time to look over the menu and decide.  Asked for a couple of minutes and she came back literally within a couple of minutes.  So, as far as I'm concerned, everything's good so far. Ordered fish tacos plate, turkey burger plate and a couple of the kid's meal pasta plates.  I must say the portions for the kid's meals are generous, really generous.  And for what the kid's meals costs, that's a pretty good deal.  My turkey burger looked good, but unfortunately, it was overcooked.  The avocado made up for it, though.  The crispy skinny fries were only skinny - they forgot the crispy part.  The fish tacos tasted just okay, it wasn't bad, but it definitely was not tasty and flavorful; we've had better for less the amount.  One of our friends ordered the Angus sliders and he was soooo disappointed.  Right as his plate was set down and we saw what it looked like, he knew it wasn't going to be good at all. So, for me, it wasn't the service.  It was the food."
John S.,"Redlands, CA",15,129,9,4.0,6/11/2013,"I am more of a local small business, mom & pop type of places, but decided to eat here.. We had salads and beer.. The salads were very good; well cooked meat fresh veggies, and house brewed beer ( not actually at this one for some reason, but brewed at other of their locations). Their beer is actually REALLY GOOD!!  Will go again.."
Haylee E.,"Redlands, CA",178,218,3,4.0,7/6/2013,"They seated us the second we walked in. My gin and tonics were perfect. The calamari was a little underwhelming, but I wasn't expecting it to be that amazing. My main course, the Moroccan salmon, was AMAZING. My boyfriend had the mahi mahi tacos, and they were delicious too."
Eric V.,"Riverside, CA",41,12,,1.0,12/1/2012,This place sucks we sat down for 10mins and no one helped us horrible service will never go back
William S.,"Yucaipa, CA",27,197,6,5.0,6/30/2011,"The beer is very good. If you don't like their house brews just order something else. I recommend Hangar 24 Orange Wheat. The main knock on BJ's is the pizza which is sad considering it's a pizza joint. The problem is, its just......odd. Their pizza isn't Chicago style. It's not New York style. It's just odd. If you order the typical BJ's pizza, you get a thick crust pizza that is fairly light and crispy on the outside. It's good crust. The problem I have with it is the lack of sauce. They simply put cheese on the crust and then the standard topping, Roma tomatoes. If you like sauce, just order it on the side. The pizza definitely tastes better dipped in marina if, like me, you find the lack of sauce sacrilegious. The reason I still give BJ's 5 stars is that literally everything else I've ever ordered has been good. I like the burgers, the sandwiches, the salads, the appetizers, you name it, it's good. It's also quality food. You can tell a lot about a restaurant from the lettuce used in their salads. You won't find much yellow lettuce in their salads. It's quality ingredients through and through. For that, and the consistently good service, BJs is worthy of 5 stars."
Louloua J.,"Holbrook, NY",14,46,6,4.0,7/25/2011,"BJ's.. It's a big chain of restaurants and I have visited the ones in more than one location. I like the food here and the ambience is also very western cowboy style. Three is a great variety of sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, etc. My personal favorite is the (Best Beginnings) appetizer tray. We had it all gone in 30 seconds amongst 7 of us. I have had loads of friends rave about the sampler beer that they have to offer. They beers on tap are really good. Apart from that, I would like to add that they do a good job on their calzone menu. The items are tempting as well as low-calorie.  I had a little accident with them, when I ordered for a virgin drink and was served otherwise. But they did make up for that.  The usual Brewhouse, you'd like to go to on a Friday night."
Bobby S.,"Mentone, CA",281,118,100,2.0,11/15/2010,The food is decent. The service has a bucket of problems. I used to order food from BJ's until the 4th time I've received food prepared unsatisfactory. Came BJ's just give me what I ordered? The pricing is a bit unreasonable for the quality and quantity of food. I do remember a time when I had a good experience on a couple occasions. The meatball sandwich is good.
Erika A.,"Fontana, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/15/2014,"Was here on Thursday for a birthday lunch. Definitely the worst experience at this BJ's. The people in the booth next to us had their drinks and orders placed before anyone even came to our table to take our drink orders, even though they were seated almost 10 min after us. We let a manager know that we had not been visited by any server yet and she was very nice and had someone come help us. We placed our drink and lunch orders together.  15 min later and still no drinks.  After about 1 hr of waiting we decided we would just take our food back to the office so we asked that same manager if she could box them up. We get to the office and find that 1 of the orders is wrong.  I like BJs but the experience at this location  was definitely unpleasant."
Mike W.,"La Quinta, CA",32,26,7,2.0,6/24/2011,My Dad was with us with his walker and their put us at the farthest table from the front door. The manager was great and opened the back door so we wouldn't have to hike to get out. Food was ok and service was weak. But again management was very responsive. Just an off night for them...
Kathleen H.,"Redlands, CA",6,4,,4.0,12/18/2012,Today we went to have dinner at BJ's San Bernardino. It took awhile before a waiter came to greet us and ask us what we wanted to drink. We then ordered our meals. It took another while for us ti get our salads. My food order was wrong and the waiter acted as if I was wrong. Anyway....... We spoke to the manager. He was kinda enough to fix the problem. He is a true restaurant manager. Thank you! I wish I could remember his name.
Mark H.,"Highland, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/20/2014,"Why do I keep allowing this place to upset me? Two stars because the pizza was ok.  Went in tonight with my brother.  Seated within 5 minutes. Acknowledged by waiter 15 minutes later. He asked if we were ready yo order; I emphasized we had been seated 15 minutes and have been waiting th o order.  Ordered calamari and a pizza. Calamari was disgusting, pizza was ok.    We finished eating. Waiter never checked on us. After 20 minutes of waiting for the bill, my brother had to leave. He actually sent me a text from his home in Redlands to ask if I had left BJs. At that point I went to the hostess and demanded that I pay immediately or leave. I got the bill from the waiter, gave him my credit card.  He came back and forgot to put the receipt that I had to sign in the bill folder.  I called and spoke to a lady that claimed to be the manager.  I made it clear that I was already gone, not looking for a free meal. Just wanted to explain my disgust with this restaurant.   This took place Saturday December 20, 2014 at 9:45pm. BJs third strike."
Angelique Q.,"Highland, CA",283,276,240,3.0,7/1/2008,"The wait can be super long, especially at night and even more so on the weekends.  Why??? Because they need to build more restaurants out here! hahaha (*hint: we need more (variety please) and better places to feed me!) I love love love their Cilantro Pesto Pizza. :P**  I usually get that or their Sesame Chicken Salad.   I really don't care for anything else on their menu... oh except the occasional Pizookie.... Mmmm!"
Richard A.,"San Bernardino, CA",39,11,1,5.0,10/31/2013,"This Restaurant is great for almost any occasion. Its mellow and nicely adorned for dinning in, and the bar is fully stocked with a great beer selection and sports entertainment for casual happy hour visits. BJ's is an awesome place to visit after a long day's work."
Juan L.,"Rialto, CA",28,23,515,4.0,5/18/2011,Great place to have some drinks or wine. We got a table instead of the bar. Our server was Michael very nice young man keep coming around to see if everything was ok.
