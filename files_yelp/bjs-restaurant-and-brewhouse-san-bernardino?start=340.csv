Eric M.,"Riverside, CA",1,4,,5.0,10/8/2013,BJ's is one of my favorite places to eat. The staff is always friendly. The food is almost always out in no time. My girlfriend and i always share a medium chicken bacon ranch pizza. Its amazing! They have never let me down. :)
clay b.,"Redlands, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/22/2015,"I have frequented BJ's for several years and usually have a good experience at the Huntington and Newport Beach locations, this was not the case for San Bernadino on 1-21-15. Our party of 3 was quickly seated but the hostess was rude and short with us we weren't even greeted. Our server Beth was extremely courteous, friendly and attentive. Our drinks came out very quickly. Most other severs were not smiling or attentive as ours. Management walks around and does nothing and acts like they are above everyone else. I actually saw one male manager walk up to our server and say something that was obviously rude. Food was mediocre at best, the only thing that made it an exceptional experience was the service."
Harry B.,"Colton, CA",91,2,,5.0,11/13/2010,"This place is one of my go to restaurant in the loma linda, san bernardion, colton area. I've been to this restaurants SOoo many times the last couple years. I just love this place. One of the things i like about this place is the consistency of their food quality.  i'd rate it about 9/10, just because there were few instances that their pizza was a liltle undercooked. I know because i've had their pizza soo many times, that is the only reason why i noticed. Other than that, SUperb consistency. Pizza is 99% perfectly Awesome. Salad consistent as well. SERVICE - Its PRetty Darn Good. I can't complain about their service at all. They go great length to keep you a happy camper. Recent;y, the cook made us a small pizza instead of a Medium Pizza. i notified the waiter and they made us a Medium Pizza without any charge. Aint that awesome? I got to bring a Whole Medium pizza. Also, it took them longer than usual to servce us our pizzooki, the manager felt bad and gave it to us for free."
Mark C.,"Highland, CA",108,24,14,5.0,4/2/2013,"This place does not disappoint. Outstanding service, attractive staff and great food. As someone who appreciates good beer and good food, it always exceeds my expectations. Who would've thought??"
Diana R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",30,25,184,5.0,6/14/2012,I just simply LOVE Bj's ...Red velvet pizookie...nuff said : )
James S.,"San Jose, CA",8,123,1,3.0,5/1/2010,"It's a pretty good place for large groups or parties. They can accommodate large groups, though they don't have private rooms. The menu is fairly diverse so everyone from vegetarians to meat eaters can find something. Pasta, beef, salads, pizza's, everything. Beer is hit or miss--some are pretty good while others are worse than cheap domestic beers. They've got a sampler platter that'll let you try 5 or 6 of them. Give that a go before you declare it great or crap (it's clear some reviewers tried one beer and gave up). Biggest complaints... very long waits during peak hours. They refuse to split checks more than 2 or 3 ways. Their food can be quite inconsistent from day to day. Being next door to Sam's club, there's a complete lack of parking."
arik b.,"Phoenix, AZ",195,182,18,3.0,4/10/2010,It's hard to write a good review for this place. If anything I'm just putting my mark down.  Food was so so truck food. I got pulled pork sandwich and the pork wasn't shredded. Just chunks of pork. Bleh. Chain Hell in the late night San Bernardino.
Melissa T.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",138,209,6,3.0,10/4/2010,"I enjoy coming here maybe twice a year but can't do much over that.  The pizza is decent but I have yet to find an item off the rest of the menu worth ordering.  The food itself reminds me of a classier Applebees (barf!).  But the pizza is where to order.  They have a good beer selection & I particularly enjoy the Berry Burst Cider.  Service has always been excellent & I have never had a bad experience.  Perhaps if someone is being ignored (LH), it would be best to speak to the manager, or the hostess, as the serving staff may have been confused as to whose table you were seated at.  Plus you get free perks when a manager is involved.  (Or you should!)"
Michelle B.,"Fontana, CA",107,68,1,3.0,11/24/2010,"The lunch specials are pretty awesome! Service is great and the beer is tasty.  However, there was a baby spider in our chicken wings today...yuck! Also, the fries that came with my meal were cold. Fail...I didn't complain though, this is the first time something like this has happened.  Every other time, I've had great experiences.  My babes loves the blacked NY steak here.  I love their clam chowder, wings, the california chicken sandwich and of course PAZOOKIE!   Overall, this is a decent restaurant to come for a nice casual dinner or lunch.  I wouldn't recommend coming here for anything fancy or to impress a hot girl."
Jill C.,"Redlands, CA",54,6,,4.0,10/6/2013,"I am a huge fan of BJ's, and have been to countless locations. Our usual order is a little out of the ordinary, but not complicated, and we have had numerous negative experiences. We've been told by many employees that the Buffalo Chicken pizza comes with a mix of buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce to keep the heat down. I have even emailed a manager regarding this issue, and have been validated.  Unfortunately, even after this, I have been argued with and I have been told that I'm wrong. More often than not, I receive a pizza with BBQ sauce on it, or a pizza without ranch (which seems to be the general ""quick fix"" to a staff member who does not believe me or want to deal with me). I, too, work in the customer service industry, so I understand what it's like to be on the other side, and perhaps that is why I have never made a huge issue of this. However, when I order my pizza with specific instructions, pay 25 dollars for it, and receive it with BBQ sauce again, it kind of sucks! And it's even worse when we get hell from the staff when ordering it! We get our pizza made correctly about 50% of the time, and we get argued with about 80% of the time. It's an unfortunate trade-off. Tonight, we placed our order with an employee named Perry. Of the countless employees we've encountered, he had the BEST attitude regarding our weird order! Even if our pizza was made incorrectly again, it was certainly less glaring with excellent customer service.  We will definitely be returning to this location. =]"
Tony G.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,12,1,5.0,10/6/2011,"Love, love, love this place due to the fact that the great food they serve is consistently constant.  I've been here at least 5 times and we always get great service and great food.  Fun decor and good music and kind of loud..but that's the fun of it.  Has that upscale sports bar feel, but like no other. My usual is the California Chicken Sandwich w/no butter on the bread (as it's too salty for me) w/wedge fries.  The clam chowder is awesome.  The pizza's are amazing, especially the Spinach Artichoke & Great White.... Yummo!  My favorite appetizer is the Avocado Eggrolls!  Boy oh boy!   Great service!  Great prices & choices!  Awesome food!!!  Thanks!"
Rathnamaa C.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,7,,1.0,11/18/2014,"After reading the reviews I thought that atleast they serves good food. The food was terrible . I never ate that type worst food in my life. Everything is over priced and service sucks . I heard that Cajun Pasta is good but I odd not like it. We ordered lot of food I liked the egg rolls over there . Those are good. And the fish was awesome . But the remaining food was terrible which is harder to eat . Even the pizza also taste different . Which is un baked and does not give any taste at all. We can make pizza better in out houses even though we are amature at making of pizza.. An overall , it sucks"
Heath P.,"Palm Desert, CA",113,85,5,4.0,9/9/2012,"I've been frequenting BJs all over the southwest for years. I've even been to the original, can't believe how it's grown. Impressive. Everything is good. You cannot go wrong. It gets a little more corporate as the years pass, but it's always better than most restaurants you'll find at any given time in whatever locale you visit. Great go to place when you don't know where else."
Anthony R.,"Crestline, CA",18,133,,3.0,2/18/2011,"Their happy hour deals are alright, but for some reason (and this may just be me) their appetizers never really sit in my stomach that well.  So last night, I ordered just a hamburger and fries, and all went well.  Don't ask me!!   They pour a good Hef beer, and the waitresses are always friendly, even when it's really busy.  There's tons of other restaurants located nearby this particular BJ's, and in all honesty, you wouldn't miss much if you did your happy hour at some of the other restaurants on San Bernardino's ""Hospitality Lane"".  But if you're a fan of BJ's (sorry, I had to make that joke) then you won't be disappointed."
Gloria N.,"Perris, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/4/2014,"Loved this place! Food was always great and staff was always friendly! That is until last week, I planned a gathering with a group of friends and called to make a reservation for us, note 48hours in advance. The woman who answered the phone was very rude and flat out told me, ""we cannot accommodate your party""(12 people). Funny thing is I showed up here 15 min after my planned reservation and saw plenty of empty tables. Yet we could not be accommodated? I didn't know this restaurant turned service away. My company frequently orders large orders of take out for guests or board members, I am now more thank happy to take my service elsewhere. Tip to the person in charge of reservations, you don't have to be rude, you never know who is calling or how your actions impact business."
J H.,"Walnut, CA",1,94,4,4.0,12/23/2009,"Great place to unwind after a long day at work.  Happy hour is pretty generous with $1 off beer, $2 off appetizers, and 1/2 off mini pizzas! Ambience- Nice and relaxed atmosphere.  A bit on the dark side, though. Food- Great beer selection.  Can't go with their deep dish pizzas.  Remember to save room for the Pazooki!!! Stop by after work if you are in the area.  Again, they have great happy hour! Service- Service was more than acceptable, better than what you usually get at chain restaurants."
Anthony B.,"Riverside, CA",513,690,483,4.0,4/5/2010,"Went here a few nights ago for the first time in a year or so. The last time I was not impressed much with the place. This time however seemed to be a more positive one. The decore is excellent, on par with Yard House and other types of establishments. The place seems to be more of a 20-something establishment, as many of the patrons did not look that old. Food wise, we were happy with what we ordered. I selected the Roasted Turkey Cobb and my wife chose a Bacon Cheese Burger. The fries reminded us of the fries they serve at Stater Bros deli department (which is a good thing). For drinks I decided to try the 7 beer sampler set (Blonde, Hefewizen, Pale Ale, Red, Porter, Stout, and ""Nutty Brewnette""). Overall they were good beers which come served on a laminated placemat of sorts describing which beer is which. While the experience itself wasn't drop dead great, it was a wonderful time and would definitely recommend at least a visit or two."
Tanya H.,"Fontana, CA",349,45,22,5.0,9/24/2011,"Best pizza I have ever eaten! It is so good that I don't even need toppings just cheese, please. The crust is so yummy. The service has been good so far. They  have Hanger 24 so I'm happy. Prices and portions are good too! mmm...I think I'm going to go there today just thinking about it :)"
Ryan C.,"CARDIFF, CA",0,11,,3.0,4/22/2012,Their desert is just absolutely yummy. The pulled pork was ehh and the service was TERRIBLE!
Josie C.,"Redlands, CA",12,150,6,3.0,5/20/2012,"Aside from always being busy when I'm there, they are ok. Sometimes it takes forever to find your server or get your food. The food is pretty good. My kids love the pizzas they have."
