Adriana G.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/19/2014,I came in on my lunch time and this was my first time trying Bj's Pizza and it was awesome! I will be back again soon. This place rocks! Good place to come and hang out after work or just with friends or family.
Sal P.,"Chino Hills, CA",36,474,125,3.0,6/9/2012,"I think everybody knows what to expect from BJ's. Just like TGIF's, Chili's, etc... All in all a good value. Good food and friendly service."
Chris B.,"Danvers, MA",93,414,17,2.0,10/22/2009,"It's mass-produced beer disguised as a microbrew in a so-called brewpub.   Complete hit or miss in terms of taste & quality of what you get, I guess if you asked me I like the pale ale the best but that ain't saying much.   Food is edible.  Probably the best thing they have is that ridiculously sized cookie dessert thingie.  But hey, if someone else is picking up your tab, have at it! Support your local brewery instead."
Van H.,"San Diego, CA",5,52,3,4.0,6/19/2012,Orange Wheat Beer and Pirhanha are very good beers.  I recommend just getting the appetizer sampler for two and you have great food. I have eaten here  a dozen times and always go back to the sampler.  Mozarella sticks are good too.  I have always found seats for two in the bar area no matter how crowded the place has been.
Mrs. G.,"Riverside, CA",130,120,123,1.0,4/5/2012,"$7 chips and salsa, and the salsa wasn't even filled all the way. Watched our waitress walk into the restroom and 20 minutes later still hadn't come out. Finally had to get  the manager to help us. Crappy."
Lil' Chef F.,"Grand Terrace, CA",69,53,3,3.0,11/17/2009,"4 words: Be Prepared To Wait... 'nuff said!! Well almost enuf.. I think I've figured out why... Imagine ALL of going through this - You wait a good 20 minutes for ur table & when u're finally in, ur waiter introduces her/him self & disappears on you only to appear 10 mins later to take ur order & disappear again while u almost lose ur appetite or wish u wr elsewhere over the passing 20-25 mins. Assume you take 15-20 mins to drink & dine. Eventually, u're all set to go but the waiter's doin that disappearing act on u again for another 10-15 mins! Frustrated, u go to the cashier urself, only to be told u have to WAIT at ur table for the bill/check, when you've spent the last 1.5 hrs 'waiting' most of the time..  WE should be called the WAITERS!!!"
J D.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",0,9,,2.0,5/4/2014,Service was slow and the food was cold. Good wings and good beer and drink selection.  I think I will be skipping over that restaurant next time.
Dillane E.,"Calimesa, CA",65,143,232,2.0,3/17/2011,"I'm not sure what the hype is about.  I'm guessing people mainly come here for happy hour and the selection of beer on tap.  I would not come here just for the food.  I was invited to celebrate a birthday here with my family.  I ordered the calzone and it arrived at the table luke warm.  It was bland in taste and a little too doughy for my liking.  My mom ordered a specialty calzone and they delivered it to the wrong table.  By the time she got her dinner, we were ALL done eating.  Actually, I only ate half of mine because I really didn't care for it much.  The dessert was good, we ordered a triple chocolate pazookie.  I don't think I'll be a regular here.  I am not impressed at all and would rather go somewhere that I will be thoroughly satisfied."
Chris D.,"Calimesa, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/2/2012,"Bj's has been for a long time my favorite restaurant, but this one is just bad. They can't cook a steak right and it takes over an hour to get any of our entrées. Service isn't bad, but expect to not see your waiter a lot. In all a good chain that is misrepresented by this location. Been there 3 times and I think it's time I stop going."
Lauren T.,"Redlands, CA",3,95,4,3.0,5/11/2011,"It's okay, but not reasonable for a 1 hour workday lunch break. I learned that today. A co-worker and I went here for lunch on our lunchbreak, after hearing of their lunch deals. It only took about 5 minutes to be seated, which is good. Our waitress came fairly quickly and took our orders, also good. However, then, we didn't see our waitress for a while. A long while. We saw a lot of food coming out of the kitchen, but none of it was ours. My coworker finally caught her attention, and asked about our food. The waitress went to check and almost immediately brought it out. Only, by that time, it had been 45 minutes since we ordered, so we had to eat very fast to get back to work.  It's good that the business is busy and is doing well. It's just difficult to get in and out on a lunchbreak, unless you get it to go. If I went at another time, where we didn't have to watch the clock, it wouldn't have mattered as much."
Arnold B.,"Colton, CA",21,76,70,4.0,8/16/2009,"Hmm, it's weird to read so many people complain about waiting so long. Maybe I arrive at a reasonable time--before 5 or after 6.  If there are a lot of people waiting though, they bring out some delicious complimentary pizza, so you eat while you wait. Anyways, the food there is delicious, not EVERY BJ's is the same; there are different employees that make/prepare the food differently. I usually just opt for the BJ's favorite pizza or the delicious Balsamic Chicken, which is probably one of the best things on the menu--it has two pieces of white chicken breast atop baby field greens, caramelized onions, and a mound of mashed potatoes, not to mention they drizzle it with good balsamic sauce. To drink--I love the iced tea and hot tea, it's so good! To finish off my meal I just get the typical chocolate chip pizookie that comes out warm and delicious with about two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top."
Chris M.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,12,16,5.0,8/10/2012,These Buffalo Wings are the BEST.. The beer and the service is the best.. Great Bar tenders..
Gary M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",32,108,,3.0,6/25/2009,"OK. Once you've endured the unnecessary wait, you've experienced all this place has to offer. Food is so-so. Service depends on the crowd, which surprisingly seems not to diminish. How many first-timers can this place accommodate? Pizza disappointed my taste. The chili, however, is quite decent. I remember Merl Haggard saying during a recent show at San Manuel that the hardest thing about being on the road is finding a decent bowl of red. Try this place, but don't be too surprised if you aren't coming back anytime soon."
Jess Z.,"Murrieta, CA",31,40,17,5.0,6/20/2013,"So a group of us spontaneously chose to come here the saturday before fathers day to celebrate my quitting of my job beginning of this month. I myself had never been, but was pleasantly surprised to find it suitable for our celebrating purpose ;) Bar to the left, two separate seating areas to the right, it was not crowded by any means, but they were busy. Right away we were asked how many fathers were in our group, which I thought was nice, and at the time did not know they gave out free Fathers Day Beer Glasses, which we were given at the end of our dinner. Were seated promptly, given high chairs for our little ones etc.We ordered and ate pizzas and wings for appetizers.  Our male waiter, can't remember his name, was constantly around and ready to bring/order us anything we pleased.. Everything you could ask for when out with loved ones and friends. All went so smoothly we were able to thoroughly enjoy ourselves recanting goofy stories of us at work and other drunk adventures. We were a larger group so don't know if that had to do with how well we were treated judging by other reviews? All I know is we enjoyed ourselves, it was a great first timer experience for me anyway. Hell, even my lil brother enjoyed himself I think, a non drinker and also NOT a dad, walked out at the end of the night with a free Fathers Day Glass ;) Who could ask for more?"
Natali U.,"Redlands, CA",87,112,407,3.0,6/5/2011,"Been here several times. The food is average, but consistent. The service here generally sucks. Not so much rude... just slow and sub-par on a really regular basis! Keep coming back for that berry burst cider. Avocado egg rolls are great too. Love the loaded baked potatoes."
david k.,"La Mirada, CA",2,76,,5.0,9/30/2013,very simple 1. short wait time compared to other BJ's on the weekends 2. friendly service  3. not much 'order calls/pressures' but still gives good recommendations. 4. easy parking 5. great taste of course! =5 stars
Jesse S.,"Peoria, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2015,"This was probably the worst experience ever. Went on vacation to California. On the way back to Arizona I saw BJs from the freeway. I told my girlfriend hey lets eat there Ive heard great things. We were sat immediately.  At first the server was very friendly and seemed like she knew what she was doing. Took our order. First my other guest asked for no tomatos on her salad. Salad comes out with tomatoes.  My girlfriend and I ordered appetizers. Never came out. About an hour goes by before the manager comes to our table. He says ""How is everything""?  I say weve been here and hour and have not even recieved our appetizers. He proceeds to tell us that they had a computer malfunction and our food is on its way out. Which means the server forgot to ring it in. Food comes and he walks away while saying hes going to give us a discount. Food came out looking and tasting horrible!! They even forgot one of our appetizers. The server proceeded to ignore us the rest of the time. The manager didnt even check back to make sure things were better. I had to ask a busboy for my check. This is my first review. I am in the industry. I never complain. But something has to be done. If youre hungry and in San Bernadino, CA i recommend McDonalds."
John H.,"Beaumont, CA",4,46,,5.0,8/24/2011,Lunchtime at mid week was busy but we were seated quickly. Service was excellent. Good menu selection. Food was served on-time and tasted good. We ordered from the cheaper/smaller portion lunch menu and the price was fair considering the nice surroundings and amenities the restaurant offers. A pleasant dining experience.
Andrew K.,"Cerritos, CA",597,34,4,4.0,3/1/2011,"came here after a full day of snowboarding. i walked in and was greeted nicely with a really pretty blonde. wheeeee the server justin was really good. he refilled our drinks in a timely manner and everything came out perfectly....now to the food started with the spinach dip and egg rolls. egg rolls were bomb! i love avocados and egg rolls so it was just the perfect start. the chips for the spinach dip tasted a bit too salty and burned. the dip itself was great. pizzas were decent. great white, bbq chicken, and the hamburger. i wouldn't order the hamburger again but the other ones are a maybe. i think id just come here for the happy hour drinks.  dessert....yummmmmyyyyyyyyy...one of the servers hooked it up for us and my goodness...who can complain about a free pizookie? wheeeee"
Charles F.,"San Bernardino, CA",6,4,,3.0,1/27/2014,"On my recommendation We went for a birthday with family that had never been there. We were seated quickly the server took drink orders and returned with them quickly and then took  our food orders and we did not see her again for forty five min. When she dropped off the bill.  Different people did bring the food in a reasonable time. One meal was a fresh tuna salad it looked great, one was steak salad, a bed of greens with a whole steak on it. I had fried chicken and mashed potatoes, the potatoes tasted instant dry with no flavor and the two chicken breasts looked more like hummingbird breasts. We have been big fans of BJS for a long time but it will be some time before we go back."
