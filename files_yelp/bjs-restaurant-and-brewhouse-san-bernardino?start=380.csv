Patrick K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/25/2014,"Awesome place!  If you are here in January and enjoy beer, then try the seasonal Grand Cru.  My personal favorite is the Tatonka Imperial Stout. Food is very good, especially the burgers."
ZumaJay Z.,"Santa Monica, CA",123,255,7,4.0,6/24/2008,"OK... yes, big corporate chain.  And no, not much of a review since I didn't eat there... I just did pickup at 11am and then brought it back to the hotel.... but regardless: YUM. I was starving... woke up from a late night of training and felt the urge for their thin crust cilantro pesto pizza... which added chicken.  They didn't charge for the extra chicken... so yay! And to indulge, I also ordered chicken wings... Both hit the mark... except they forgot the celery sticks.  Bastards.  Anyhow, good joint... always good food... the server was a bit of a dick when I didn't tip him.  Moron... who tips on take out unless the service is REALLY that fantastic?"
Sherry S.,"Colton, CA",0,94,,4.0,5/11/2013,Went on a Thursday nite with 2 grand kids 4 and 1. They sat us in the back and I was happy with the choice. The waiter Jeff came over was very personable and paid attention to both kids. You normally don't find this. The food was good and the service was great.
Eldine M.,"Yucaipa, CA",212,229,103,4.0,1/24/2011,"My bf and I enjoy coming here a lot. Some friends have said they've received bad service here but I've personally never experienced it. I love the ahi poke and the flatbread pizzas. Also, the baked potatoes here are enormous!"
Royce R.,"Joshua Tree, CA",6,59,67,3.0,8/31/2010,"This is one of those places which is very well decorated, but feels just a little lacking in warmth. Perhaps I'm turned off by a particularly polished, corporate-esque feel, but I'm never quite as proud of patronizing these places as struggling mom and pops. If you're looking for someplace to have dinner and a drink that's a little more neutral for dates or business than a bar, than perhaps you'll take a liking to this place. Think Applebees or Chili's and you know what to expect. The pizza was good as well as the home made root beer, but the price definitely feels a little on the high side."
Lorly L.,"San Francisco, CA",186,31,5,2.0,6/8/2008,"What is up with the wait in SoCal? Freakin had to wait for my table. Wait for water.  Wait for anyone to take our orders.  Wait for 60 mins for our orders.  Look for any service person to refill our glass & Wait for them to refill it.   Wait 20 mins for dessert  menu & Waited 20 mins for the brownie sundae.  Last straw, waited 20mins for the check, thinking i should just walk out but my family was with me. OMg! are they tryin to keep me in soCal or what?! Waitin, waitin & waitin...."
Ana Michelle C.,"Rialto, CA",58,21,2,1.0,3/1/2012,"Let me back up my quick tip... I have always gotten bad service at this BJ's! Horrible! Especially on a Friday night. But I keep giving it chances and it doesn't get any better. Tonight... One or the books. We called ahead... Because they promote call ahead seating so we wouldn't have to wait, yet when we got there, we were quoted with a 15 min wait time. We waited 20 min... And once we were seated waited another 12 min for the rude server to even ask us for our drink order. Hannah clearly couldn't handle the hussle and bussle of a busy Friday night and a busy section. Rude. Rude. Rude. (I normally don't name drop, but in this instance I have to) when she finally brought out the drinks, my sisters drink didn't have a straw... She asked for one, and was clearly ignored. We set a timer and had to ask a second time for the straw... When she finally brought the straw she brought an unwrapped straw and tossed it. At that point we got up and left. I did have the decency to notify a manager about the service. He was very understanding and gave me a $25.00 courtesy card for giving them feedback and because we were starving. However, I won't be going back to this restaurant..."
Bob C.,"CA, CA",132,755,415,3.0,7/13/2008,"The only real reason to come to BJ's? The Pizookie, which is a ""freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.""  Tasty! Because we cannot live on cookies and ice cream alone, I usually order something from the menu.  On the menu, I enjoy their blackened chicken on the cajun pasta.  The pasta's just okay, but the chicken is actually quite good.  I think the blackened chicken is a feature you can have with various dishes, so look for it! Just like many chains, BJ's does some things well, and other things not as well.  Overall, everything is just so-so."
Keith H.,"Beaumont, CA",31,5,,1.0,12/19/2011,"The one star is based on a single experience. Normally the food and staff are great. This was not the case last night. My wife,4 kids and i arrived for dinner looking for some fantastic pizza. We arrived around 6pm. The only booth that was available that would seat my family of six was in the bar area. We took the chance and took the seat at the bar. The Sunday night football game was on the big screen and there were plenty of people watching the game. Our server Sandra started off good by coming around quickly and taking drink and appetizer orders. She quickly brought out drinks and the appetizers were soon to follow. It all went down hill from there. We finished our appetizers and drinks and then sat there waiting to order our food. Sandra finally came by and took our orders. She didnt refill the empty drinks at the table but finally came back 10 minutes later with new drinks. Having not had a soda in a while i drank mine quickly and then waited 15 minutes before Sandra took the empty cup. She took it and didnt come back with another for over 20 minutes and only after I asked if I could get my drink please. The food came out and the kids orders were fine but the great white pizza with extra tomatoes had very few tomatoes. There were several pieces that didnt have any tomatoes at all. When Sandra finally came back to check on the table i asked her if this was extra tomatoes. She said she placed the ordered with extra and this was extra tomatoes. She said that she would order a side of them from the kitchen and bring them out right away. 15 minutes later she brought out a side of tomatoes. The side of tomatoes was the equivalent of 2 pearl tomatoes chopped up.  This was not nearly enough to qualify for extra tomatoes for an extra large pizza. I asked Sandra again for extra tomatoes and she acknowledged that these were a joke and she will order enough for an extra large pizza. 15 minutes later she finally brought out a small cup of tomatoes that was finally appropriate. By this time unfortunately we were done with the meal. i only had one piece of pizza as well as my wife. We asked for a box to go. Sandra brought us the box and the check. I looked at the check and noticed that she never entered extra tomatoes on our pizza. She was just lying to us when she said she did. We immediately placed our card in the holder for her but she had left in such a rush she didnt even see the card. After waiting for ten minutes for her to take the check my wife took 3 of the kids to the car. I waited for a couple of minutes staring at Sandra take care of one of her other tables that were receiving prompt pleasant service and then finally asked the bus boy to take my check. He told me that he would let my server know that it was ready but I insisted that she was not helpful at all and I just want to leave. he took the check and handed it to Sandra two tables away. She now promptly returned with my card and bill. She had the first smile on her face I saw all night and told me thanks for coming in tonight and to have a great night. I have never not given a tip to a server, in fact it has to be mediocre service for me to even give less than a 20% tip. I worked in the restaurant business for many years and know that it can be rough. Sandra received NOTHING for a tip. She did not deserve a dime and I do not feel bad."
Febriana S.,"Redlands, CA",39,12,2,3.0,2/23/2012,"strawberry lemonade is bomb! santa fe salad is recommended, but saturday nights are worst. wait time can go up to 3 hours. no reservation."
Heather B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,24,13,4.0,2/27/2009,I go here only for the pizookie! It is just that awesome. The pizza is very good too. We've always had great servers. Thought we did get stuck in the rain for 3 hours waiting for a table once a couple years back. I really prefer the Location off of 4th St. in Ontario. The wait is never as bad and they have a larger waiting area.
James S.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,12,6,2.0,6/11/2011,Bar drinks are way over priced. Ask before you order. They charged us $8.95 for a small daiquiri. Not your neighborhood brewery if they gouge locals.
Kristin B.,"Redlands, CA",8,29,4,5.0,11/11/2012,"Love going here either for lunch, late night evenings, or casual dinners.  Always order something simple: chicken strips with wedge cut fries.  But it is always soooooo good!  And their strawberry lemonade has been perfection the last couple of times I have gone.  The thing you must always get when you visit, is the pazukki; a chocolate chi cookie baked gooey and to perfection, covered in vanilla ice cream!  It is to die for!  LOVE.  They have a good selection of other foods and specials as well.  Plus they are open real late so if you ever want good restuarant food late at night, they are open!  Love the atmosphere too.  It isn't crazy loud and it isn't too formal."
Lucy B.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/18/2009,"We hardly ever go to BJ's but ended up there last night as their kitchen is open late (that's the extent of the ""good"" part of my review).   When we arrived we knew the kitchen was open for at least 10 more minutes as we called on the way there (they are open until 12 - serve full menu until 11 and pizza/appetizers until 12 - we got there about 10:50).  We both wanted soup and salad.  The waitress was profoundly rude pronouncing that ""the kitchen is closed. you can order a pizza.""  She reluctantly agreed to check with the chef and when she returned she thrust menus at us saying ""I need to put it in right now.""  We told her what we wanted and she looked at us like we were crazy - ""Sometimes they put away the salad stuff early.""  WHAT??  I've been to BJ's.  Their ""salad"" is greens with a few croutons.  Apparently they only had enough soup for one bowl so DH ordered spaghetti.  After putting in the orders, she returned - ""Do you want drinks, too?"" Uh. Yes.  We're at the BAR!  Grrrr.  This BJ  experience left a bad taste in my mouth."
Mike J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,51,,2.0,5/15/2013,I ordered the mahi mahi with the grilled shrimp. It came with veggies. The only good thing about the meal was the fish. The grilled shrimp were a joke. It looked liked the shrimp were under a heat lamp for a few hours. I bit the first one and it was ice cold. I told the server if I could have another set of grilled shrimp. She took my shrimp and came back a few minutes later with the same set of shrimp after it was thrown into them microwave. I had eaten at BJ's in Westwood and was satisfied. After this experience I will never visit BJ's again. Have a nice day.
Adrienne D.,"San Dimas, CA",0,21,,5.0,7/3/2012,"Love this place! Came in for dinner with my date on Friday night 6/29/12.  The restaurant was very crowded but we were seated within five minutes.  The service was great, we did have two different waiters but they were both very attentive and very sweet.  The food was so yummy.  My date had the jambalaya and I had the fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken.  I would suggest that you try one of the many pizookie's for dessert they are all great...you can't make a wrong choice."
Rainelle C.,"Patton, CA",8,7,,2.0,9/20/2012,"I have only been here several times and truly believe that their menu is way to over priced with such small to somewhat moderate portions. The service was better the second time around, but would still not consider going out on like a romantic outing or by myself. Also the wifi is not really up to snuff so to speak. You can connect to the wifi and it will show up on your smart phone, but it doesn't really connect for you to be able to access the service."
Tony S.,"Beaumont, CA",174,328,23,4.0,1/3/2012,"generally quick service , menu has alot of variety, good place for a business lunch"
Jim L.,"San Bernardino, CA",32,151,,2.0,5/29/2010,"When we'd go to Ventura in July or August, to escape the heat of the Inland Empire, we'd venture over to Oxnard for lunch at BJs.  Bonus is that it's near the Borders Bookstore, which would be our next stop. Imagine our surprise when we found a BJs opening in San Bernardino!  We were quite loyal fans at first, then the pizzas and burgers just weren't as good as I remembered them.  The pizookies are great, though! We solved the waiting problem by going at off-times and sitting in the bar area, which is self-seating. The final straw came when they no longer were allowed to sell beer in growlers, since this location doesn't have an actual brewery on the premises.  Haven't been back since, and now we have yet another useless growler, since other places won't fill one with another brewery's logo. Also, for the location on Hospitality Lane, it seemed to attract a crowd that we found less than desirable."
Denise A.,"Colton, CA",30,59,9,3.0,7/1/2009,Ive never had to wait like everyone else has mentioned. maybe i go when its dead.  either way good food good drinks its a chain they got their stuff together.
