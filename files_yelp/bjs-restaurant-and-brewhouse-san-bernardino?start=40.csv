Michelle A.,"Fontana, CA",0,7,1,2.0,1/19/2017,Came here for the 1st time for lunch. Sitting here waiting for our lunch to come and just overseeing the place. I notice how dusty the middle dividers were. At eye level you can just see it. I literally took my finger to it. This is unacceptable. All that dust could be in the food I'm eating or YOUR eating. I had to take a pic and post. Won't be Back !! Guaranteed. Cleanliness Goes A Long Way!
Lupe G.,"Grand Terrace, CA",0,15,4,4.0,6/12/2017,I love it everytime i come here we are happy when we leave love the food and drinks!!! One of my favorite spots
Chris D.,"Redlands, CA",42,4,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Went for my birthday dinner with my wife and two girls. One guy took our drink order and then came back to our table with another girl and said she would be taking over while he was on break. Couldn't get any refills, messed up on our order and dessert order. Had a attitude with us and never told us sorry for anything. Got mad when we told her we had the wrong order. Definitely won't be going back to this Bjs. I even wrote on their website and I still haven't received a email back."
Jeneane A.,"San Bernardino, CA",101,4,3,1.0,9/22/2017,Poor service. The hostess seemed irritated when we asked for a different seat. The servers did not smile and were not friendly.
Stacia R.,"San Bernardino, CA",24,46,45,3.0,8/13/2017,"Went with my Aunt and Uncle for late lunch. Late late lunch. We didn't have much of a wait and the service was fine. We had a flat bread pizza, the Jambalaya and an Asian Salad. The waitress answered all of our questions and waited nicely for us to decide. My uncle really liked his pizza and my Aunt enjoyed her Jambalaya (only slightly spicy). I had the Asian dinner salad. It was okay. I wasn't a fan of the dressing. It tasted more honey mustard than honey ginger. Huge servings though so make sure you are hungry. I'd return with out or towners. There are enough menu options and they are flexible enough on changes that makes it a good place when you have several people to please."
Stephen C.,"Atlanta, GA",48,15,20,4.0,8/14/2017,BJs is BJs! They have excellent service and great food coupled with a great ambiance!
Lily T.,"Yucaipa, CA",16,4,,5.0,8/22/2017,"Went in for a drink with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the customer service of our bartender Justin. He gave us great recommendations on food, drinks and even dessert. He also made sure my water cup was full and never went empty which is huge for me! He was very attentive and made our night enjoyable."
Devynn P.,"Pomona, CA",163,26,9,2.0,8/27/2017,Horrible service. Great food.  Drinks were brought to table after our food was practically gone. And then the drinks weren't even what we ordered. No refills were offered and we never even got part of our food order.  Good was delicious and cooked well.
Cynthia M.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",76,147,360,4.0,7/26/2016,"Good place for lunch. We don't go to many chain restaurants but the bottomless soup & salad was a good deal. Soup-Broccoli Cheddar... Great! Soup-Tortilla... Pretty good Soup-clam chowder... Ok, not bad Soup-Tomato bisque... a bummer, clumpy and tasted burnt Salad-Wedge... Great! Salad-House... Ok, not bad Salad-Caesar... Yuck! The dressing was sweet Appetizer-Stuffed mushrooms were great!  Had a nice drizzle of lemon pesto over them.  Very tasty!"
Dorothy G.,"Colton, CA",147,52,204,5.0,12/11/2016,This is out favorite restaurant we love there drinks and there appetizers especially during football season Tatonka is our favorite we always try to get Justin as our waiter in the bar area he's just great and very attentive this place has delicious food and fantastic drinks for a great price love ambience of the restaurant though it's relaxing
Ronny M.,"Santa Monica, CA",7,47,49,1.0,6/22/2017,"So this is my second review for BJs in about a month. Last month we had a graduation luncheon at another location in Ontario. I posted a review and the general manager reached out to me to give BJs another shot. Well, we did. And I'm sorry that we did so. The service was terrible once again. My girlfriend and I decided to try the near by BJs in San Bernardino for Father's Day. My daughter showed up a little late and unfortunately also experienced a bad experience as well. Basically our waitress barked out quick sentences at us like a drill Sargent. ""Djou reddytoorder""!! Then would run away like faster than Forest Gump. I mean, geaze. The group next to actually got all their drinks, conversation from the waitress, and even refills!! I'm starting to wonder if these establishments don't like dark haired men with dark skin and beards!?!  I was not asked or offered water since I ordered the 4-4oz beer sampler. I was not offended another round. Was not asked if the beer was ok.  At first it was the 2 of us, my GF and I. I ordered a medium pizza for my daughter and I as she was late and on her way when I ordered. I also ASKED! Does the PIZZA a medium sized, PIZZA feed 2,TWO, PEOPLE!?? Hint hint!! That means there will be 2 people eating pizza!!  So when the tray arrives for the Pizza to sit on with a plate, not 2 plates, but 1 plate. We also at that point asked for silver ware as well.  Later about 5 minutes after the pizza arrived so did my daughter. I gave her my water after about 15 minutes of conversation and eating as the waitress did not ask my daughter if she wanted to order or a liquid drink?!! More time goes by as it is Father's Day and we are eating and drinking our soda and water? Yes, only 2 drinks still at a table with 3 patrons!! PLUS!! Our drinks are bone dry at this point. So we patiently wait, as our waitress zooms by like we don't exist, oh wait, she had time to slap a bill down and race away with our 2 drinks dry as a camels tongue!! My daughter even said that she never even saw the waitresses face she was so in a hurry helping everyone else but us.  This waitress was by far the WORST I've ever experienced. And I've been to Europe where they don't care about service.  Never ever giving BJs a chance again!!"
Becca B.,"Beaumont, CA",1,16,26,5.0,8/16/2017,"I came here with my family last week. The store manager, Gilbert, came to check on our table to see how we were doing. He was very professional and strongly believe he is a huge asset to the company. You can tell he genuinely loves his job and he truly cares about the people who come dine at his restaurant! WELL DESERVED 5 stars! our waitress was the best waitress we've ever had before!! Keep it up BJ's!!!"
Cynthia G.,"San Diego, CA",43,3,,4.0,8/16/2017,I worked with Miguel he was very kind even when I changed my reservation from 12 to 18 people to one hour before showing having to do a buffet style dinning. The staff was great !
Amanda N.,"Santa Clara, CA",222,328,568,4.0,1/2/2016,"Just wanted food after a 6 hour drive from Santa Clara to San Bernardino and Bj's was right across our hotel. Came around noon New Years Eve, and it was empty and relaxing. The service was good and appreciate those working on New Years Eve! Ordered the artichoke dip and the ahi tuna salad and they were both really good. Don't get mistaken the wasabi on the side of the salad for avocado because I sure did :( The salad had the right amount of dressing and it's a pretty big plate. Definitely can't forget about the pazookie when you come to Bj's!"
ko h.,"Riverside, CA",0,8,2,5.0,12/3/2016,"I would like to thank the managers and the servers who helped us with our large Christmas party of 104. The servers were exceptional and they always had a friendly smile. Food was excellent as usual. Thank you for making this party a wonderful experience.   Sincerely, Lucy Haag"
Alyssa R.,"San Francisco, CA",58,27,27,1.0,5/14/2017,"I get it, it's Mother's Day, they're bound to be backed up and busy... but here's a little customer service tip, acknowledge your customers and let them know you haven't forgotten about them. ""Sorry we're running a little behind, we'll be right with you. Thank you for being patient!"" EZ. Anyway, the 1* review isn't for the long wait and poor service, but the food itself.   Calamari:  Came with a slice of lemon, and no sauce whatsoever. Bland, unseasoned, with no dipping sauce. Parmesan-Crusted Chicken [sub mashed potatoes for crispy thin fries]: This is supposed to be topped with a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, but there was literally none to be found. It also came with regular fries that were nice and soggy.  Blackened Chicken Alfredo [add extra sauce]: They must have confused ""extra"" with ""light"" because if they had served it up with a tablespoon of pasta water it would have been more moist. For some added fun, there were undercooked, hard and chewy pieces of pasta.  Not only were they unable to deliver special requests but they failed horribly at the basic entree itself. If you're going to make your customers wait, at least deliver food that is enjoyable to eat instead of totally screwing up their dinner by slapping some sh!t together."
Marcia M.,"Redlands, CA",113,4,,5.0,11/4/2017,"Vanessa was our server and she was absolutely wonderful! My family and I will definitely be back because of Vanessa. She was efficient, always had our drinks filled, and anticipated our needs. Must request Vanessa for excellent customer service! She was truly a blessing!!!"
Flavio R.,"Santa Cruz, CA",3,5,3,5.0,10/25/2017,"I was asked by coworkers to pick a place for dinner so i chose bjs. I was a little nervous about slow service because it was packed. Nonetheless we had the best experience due to our server. Vanessa took great care of us and all my coworkers were impressed with her. Very attentative and she definately knew the menu! Her smile and her attitude were the best. The food was excellent as well. Not one compaint from our group. We ordered bonesless wings, sirlion steak, tuna salad, spinach dip and more. Some of my coworkers traveled from the east coast and had never heard of bjs. They were impressed! Thank you very much vanessa for allowing us to enjoy our experience."
Antonio F.,"Loma Linda, CA",420,1,,5.0,8/18/2017,"Tried the churro pizookie. I really hope it's one that sticks around for a while. Super delicious. One thing that made the experience for me was the service from the bartender, Justin. Although it appeared crowded and busy for him, he seem to make everyone fell like they were his only custom. Very charismatic and attentive. Willing to answering questions (and I had a lot of them) while providing excellent service. He gave me great food and drink recommendations which made my time there enjoyable. Definitely will be returning. Hope to have the same experience next time."
Left C.,"Banning, CA",103,44,17,4.0,6/29/2017,It's a BJ's....so if you've been to one you pretty much know what your in store for. Good beers and decent food...I give this BJ's 4 stars because of the bar service. They're personable and knowledgeable
