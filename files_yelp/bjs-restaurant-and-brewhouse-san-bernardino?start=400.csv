SR S.,"Apple Valley, CA",11,54,19,2.0,9/23/2013,"Visited this establishment on 08/20/13 for lunch, we were seated very quickly, received drinks and appetizer quickly.  Then it went downhill after that, we could see appetizers coming out of the kitchen and nothing else.  Almost an hour later we finally received our main entree like the others did.  Contact the store via email about the problem since this is the second time it's happened at the same establishment.  General manager responded with a reply to find out what happened that day and never replied back with a reason.  I have worked in food service before as a manager, many establishments have a reasonable time standard on when meals should arrive at the table and we still do not know what that is for this company since we never heard back.  Exceedingly poor service and will never repeat it again at this establishment.  As the saying goes, if it happens more than twice then shame on you for trying it again for the third time."
Lily L.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/14/2012,The food was alright..not that good and the service is terrible. I wouldn't go here again.
karl b.,"Grand Terrace, CA",6,112,,3.0,9/22/2011,"I'm sure this place appeals to some, but it didn't float my boat. Went with my sister because she likes the wines they serve. Thought i would give it a try. The people working here don't seem real. I don't need phoney smiles and shallow talk. Be real with me. If your having a rough day, tell me. I can understand. We are not living in a perfect world, after all. I dont want to be treated rudely but....you get the point. The waitress kept bugging us every couple minutes as we tried having a conversation. I'm sure that's what she was told to do by the manager, who came over and bugged us too. I should have asked him for a foot massage.LOL. I think it is better if the waiter walks by and gives you eye contact to see if you need anything. Not butt-in every couple minutes. This annoys me. I can't rate all the food here since i only tried the French Dip Sandwich. The sandwich was average to above average. Not great. The fries were just like Claim Jumpers fries. The cherry Pepsi was just like it came out of a can. Not mixed like the price would suggest. Oh well. Two and a half stars for this trip."
Harold S.,"Redlands, CA",0,25,,4.0,9/26/2011,"I have been going to BJ's once every couple of months since they opened and have found their food to be good, but service usually fair to poor. The only consistency was with the Pizookie and their beer. I went again last Friday and I must rate that experience as excellent. I had the Southwest salad and it was one of the best salads I have ever eaten. My wife had the beef dip and it also was excellent, the meet was both tender and flavorful. Our friend said that their cheeseburger and fish & chips were the best they had ever had at BJ's. Our server was prompt and efficient and our food arrived quickly and hot. I would give them five stars, but past experience hold me back. I will try them again and see if they can maintain this food quality and service."
Dia C.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,1,1.0,6/4/2013,"I've had 13 people with for my little brothers graduation dinner, I understand that a party of 13 is a lot, so I tried calling ahead to make a reservation. The woman who answered the phone told me they do not accept reservations. That we had to show up and wait for our  table. So, I showed up at 4:30 p.m. to get our table. I was told because I had such a big party I wouldn't get a specific time wait. I was already annoyed I am going to be spending  a lot of money at this restaurant at least I can have friendly service, but in fact I felt like I was a bugging them. The rest of my party showed up at 5. We waited and waited and waited until it was 6:30,  I had to go check what was taking so long. The hostess looked at me like she forgotten about me! I told her I've been here for 2 hours!! She told me that they weren't any tables ready yet. Only reason I stayed was because this is my brothers favorite restaurant. So, 2 hours later (for my party 3 hours for me) were finally seated. The waiter was friendly,  the food was cold, and overall experience was horrible."
Miguel H.,"Grand Terrace, CA",1,11,,5.0,4/5/2011,"I love this place, they have the best pizza and beer. My favorite beer is their Jeremiah Red and I love the South Western Pizza. They also have really good buffalo wings and they are actually spicy!"
AM A.,"Rialto, CA",0,67,2,3.0,3/18/2009,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the place can be crowded and the wait can be ridiculous.  The food is preety good, I usually order the chicken pasta.  The layout of the restaurant is very nice and roomy.  The reason I give it a 3 is because of their beer.  All of their craft brews suck!!!! absolutely terrible.  They offer crappy beer as well the coors, bud light crap. I like having a good beer when I eat out.  Go for the food, not the beer."
Rob G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",116,136,23,4.0,9/16/2009,"BJ's is never really a bad idea. I've eaten at the one in Cupertino, CA many many times. This one offered a dining experience very consistant with my experiences with the one in Cupertino, which is very desirable and can be difficult to come by in a corporate chain. BJ's was our preferred choice for dining (which our company was picking up the tab for). There was 17 of us and they accommodated us very well. What amazed me was the fantastic level of service that Crina D. provided us. She was our server both nights and, aside from being amazingly beautiful (I have Facebook: please add me haha) provided us with fantastic service. It was really the little things: how she managed to remember all of our orders (she even remembered what beer I'd ordered two night prior), what we were drinking, she knew when to check on refills, and her overall demeanor and ability was just amazing. I'd recommend coming here just to experience truly good service. Not every BJ's is necessarily great, this one just happens to be extremely lucky to have talent like Crina."
Diana T.,"West Los Angeles, CA",59,271,1,4.0,2/14/2008,"There is always a wait here--even at 4:45 pm.  I guess ppl eat dinner pretty early.  When you want good comfort food, BJ's is the place to go.  They have a great bar only happy hour from 4-7 which we didn't partake off since I don't like beer all that much. We definitely ordered too much since we were hungry.  My bf got the full rack of ribs which came with a HUGE potato w/sourcream, butter, chives, and either soup or salad $19.95.  I chose the appetizer chinese lettuce wraps $8.95 which came with 6 lettuce cups, a bowl of chopped chicken, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts in hoisin sauce, shredded carrots, and either thinned hoisin sauce or spicy mustard sauce.  We totally could've shared the baby backs or got a 1/2 rack.  The ribs were good with a decent amount of meat although dry without dipping it in more sauce.  The baked potato was fluffly and delicious and the size of a small grapefruit.  My lettuce wraps were quite good--refreshing and the mustard sauce def will clear your sinuses.  I was comfortably full w/leftovers but my bf insisted we try the pizookie $5.25.  They let u do 1/2 cookies here so I chose 1/2 choc chunk, 1/2 oatmeal raisin topped with 2 heaping scoops of vanilla bean.  Death by dessert for sure.  It was sooo yummy though--barely baked cookie with melted icecream seeping in.  Of course I then ended up eating too much but on rare occasions it was all worth it =)"
