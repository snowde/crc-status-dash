Ed L.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",118,119,2632,4.0,5/25/2016,"BJs, I like what you are doing. It has been awhile since my last visit. I came today with several guys and you did well.  I ordered the soup & salad lunch combo so I can try different soups.  The clam chowder was tasty with chunks of clams in it. Tomato bisque was good, and the chili was full of flavors. I am usually not a salad person but your wedge salad won me over.  I will see you again soon..."
Joy Beth W.,"San Bernardino, CA",4,128,107,5.0,1/2/2017,Love the staff always so friendly and very helpful. I have such a hard time deciding my meal so I always have tons of questions and the staff is so patient with me. I'd love to work here part time as a hostess or wait staff. It seems like everyone is so friendly and a fun place to work. I just love this place
J. D.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,94,,4.0,8/9/2017,"Great place to take the family, good food and friendly staff. Huge portions if thats what your looking for, tvs all over. Only thing its heavily popular so expect to wait, and floor is always slippery as hell. But overall great place and no complaints."
Eddie N' Hailee S.,"Running Springs, CA",20,136,22,4.0,7/25/2017,Bjs is pretty good. I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars but settled on 4 because their food is pretty consistent. What isn't consistent is their service. It often takes a long time to get your food but it is probably this way because its usually crowded. Pizookies are awesome!
Jane E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",173,130,85,5.0,4/11/2016,"My boyfriend's family decided to come to BJ's for his sister's birthday dinner. Having called in earlier and made reservations we were seated immediately once everyone was there.  Our waitress was nice and friendly. She took our order and was really good about re-filling our drinks.   I ordered the baked ziti and my boyfriend got the clam chowder, sour dough bread bowl. We had also ordered boneless chicken wings as our appetizer.  After about an hour or so we finally got our meals. It was so good! I loved the penne pasta baked and the garlic roll so flavorful! My boyfriends clam chowder melted in my mouth!! The best!  Our experience here was good and we will be back again!"
Gavin D.,"Burlingame, CA",119,6,1,1.0,6/16/2017,Waited for 1.5 hours from promised 40minutes wait. Ended up going to in n out. Don't promise what you cannot fulfill.
Allen H.,"Victorville, CA",168,1,,5.0,9/26/2017,great!!! i love the pizza & wings very tasty must try the bj's classic pizza!! Ive been comin for years always satisfied and full
Crisamar A.,"Chula Vista, CA",27,25,18,4.0,6/26/2017,Good take out ordering online. I tried their vegan lentil soup and sriracha Brussels sprouts.
Alka O.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2017,"Okay service. Worst food ever. Last three times I've been here literally the foods been crap. Order fire roasted Barbaco chicken( cold, part of rice was raw, drenched in tomato sauce) rib eye steak(dry and burnt). Used to have great service and good food but not anymore. If I could I would give them a 0 score. Don't waste your time or money at this overpriced place with terrible food."
Krystal E.,"Thousand Palms, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/22/2017,It was mine and my boyfriends first time at BJ's and let me tell you this place is amazing!! Our server Blake was awesome and not to mention the kitchen manager Garrett was amazing and attentive. Over all such a great experience and we will definitely be coming back!!
T H.,"Ontario, CA",0,9,,2.0,10/1/2017,"Unfortunately, this is the closest BJ's in the area where we work and needed a place to accommodate a party of about 12. Although the server was very nice, I think the technology used to take our order(a tablet) was more of a hindrance than a help. We were clear about asking about the fries with our order being hot (they were not on our last visit), however they were VERY cold by the time we received them. They actually had to replace 7 ORDERS OF COLD FRIES! come on now, that is ridiculous. The crispy jalapeno burger I with turkey instead of beef, had NONE of the toppings it was supposed to have ( red onion, tomatoes, lettuce) except the crispy jalapenos! It was disappointing to say the least. We will not be returning to that location for group events. We will have to find alternate ideas!"
Amanda R.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,48,8,5.0,5/12/2017,"Great food and service. Our waitress Alyssa was awesome! She did such a great job we were shocked to find out it was her first night waitressing at the restaurant. The food was really good tried the prime rib, fish and chips, and lemon thyme chicken and all were amazing! Don't forget to try the pazookies they are BOMB!"
Harrison P.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,7,,5.0,6/6/2017,"Always forget his name but his a chill bartender down to earth, and trustworthy on drink choices. I love bjs and always have but he makes it fun."
Lap L.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,96,135,3.0,4/16/2017,Good atmosphere for late night snacks and drinks.  But the drinks are not so great.  The root-beer bbq chicken wings were decent.
Isaac L.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/6/2017,"The service was pure quality. I was served by Vanessa and honestly had the best service I've had for a while. Though, it was a busy Friday night at the peak of its rush, I was sat no more than 40 minutes like they said and again, had a friendly and enthusiastic server. It definitely makes me want to come back again and spend time with friends again mainly cause you get a really good vibe here. She's definitely a hustler and hopefully if anyone else comes here they have the same experience as me."
Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",756,493,2422,5.0,7/27/2016,"We were out in San Bernadino for a training course at work and we all were ready for lunch right after.  So we decided to go and get BJ's.  We had a group of 11 people and we got seated fairly quick.  Our server was a very sweet woman who came to Cali from Missouri (or was that Misery...? LOL I've heard that there isnt much of a difference, no offense).  I ordered my normal strawberry lemonade and I ordered a Bison BBQ Burger and a house s.  The house salad is always a favorite at restaurants for some reason.  I love starting my meal off with a house salad and as usual, it totally hit the spot.  Then the Burger came out and it was a big burger!  I am personally a big fan of burgers from BJ's.  Seldom am I not satisfied with their burger.  So this was my first  time eating Bison!  I was so excited!!!  The burger was REALLY good!  It totally hit the spot and Bison (if that is real Bison, is REALLY good!  It cae with a side of fries, which I didnt really care for.  My co-worker got this spinach artichoke pizza which I jacked a few pieces of course!  The pizza was really good!   The service we had was awesome!!  I had to personally go to a waiter and tell them that we were in a bit of a rush and Man, oh man!! They all got kicked into gear!!  At one point we had like 5 servers bringing food out to us, checking on our drinks... it was freakin awesome!!  Overall, This was probably the best experience I've had from the staff to the food from any BJ's I've been to!  If you are in this area, you're very fortunate. Go and eat here!   Oddly enough, its in the boonies, in the middle of horse town, but man, they have their stuff down!"
Alicia A.,"Compton, CA",40,44,54,4.0,4/12/2017,"BJ great place to have drinks and finger food, not a good dinner family place."
Jeffrey B.,"Loma Linda, CA",199,169,150,2.0,4/3/2017,"I've been coming here since this particular location first opened. It's sad to say that the service and food quality has steadily declined since their opening. The pizza's don't taste as good and the service has gotten to be quite poor. Typically the staff are just bringing you your meal, initial drink, and expect a big tip. It's almost like they're rushing you out the door so they can get their tip and move onto the next. I will unfortunately not be coming back."
Natalie M.,"Redlands, CA",34,14,,5.0,6/30/2017,Took my boyfriend here for his 21st birthday. it was our first time coming here and everything went and tasted really well! the wings were amazing and really fresh way better than buffalo wild wings. we can't wait to come back here.
Mando J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",45,15,2,1.0,1/31/2016,"Was really good, even had a nice waitress , only thing was Margarita came in a weird cup with no salt also got one order wrong. The only main thing that bugged me was the front desk woman said a rude remark and I checked her on it (respectfully) but she was rude none the less Update: made contact with the manager and said he would like to make it up to me and send me something in the mail, a month later never got it. Total waste of time. I will not come back here"
