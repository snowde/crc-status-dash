J C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/4/2017,"A week or so ago, we ate in the bar area.  Our waitress was slow in getting to our table.  All we wanted when she did come was water, while we looked at the menu.  Time ticks by.  Nothing.  Then after a very long time, we notice TWO tables of people that came AFTER we did, got their drinks!  When I walked up to the hostess and requested a manager, this guy named Jose shows up.  I explained what just happened and he said, ""I apologize.""  But I wasn't done speaking.  When I told him that it wasn't right that the waitress did that, he said to me in an irritated tone of voice, ""ALL I CAN DO IS APOLOGIZE!"" Wow! I got his business card from the hostess and it says ""Senior Manager"".  Very unprofessional for someone of his status.  The service was slow.  Our waitress didn't check on us and the whole experience was disappointing.  I have celebrated many a birthday at this location, but never again.  After contacting BJ's through email from their website, I get a call back from the Gen. Mgr. Brian Sunday.  I explain the whole ordeal.  He was apologetic etc, and offered to make it right with a $25.00 gift card.   So last night, we decide to give it one more try.  ANOTHER HORRIBLE experience, but even worse!  We sat at the bar again, even at the same table.  Our waitress was extremely slow, worse than the previous experience!  After my friend waited and waited, she asked another server for the two samples of beer she was supposed to try.  More waiting...Finally it came.  After deciding which one to get, the beer came in a glass that was narrowed to a stem at the bottom.  This is important because that's where she was holding it while she drank her beer.  But then at one point she slid her hand up higher and felt something hard and crusty!  UGH!  No one wants to feel crusty things on the outside of their glass that they have been drinking out of, who knows what it is for God's sake!  When she told the waitress, there was no apology and she said she would pour it in another glass.  Another beer came.  I went up to the hostess desk and asked if ""Brian"" was there, and he was.  He came over, I reminded him that I had spoke of the phone with him a week before, and then told him what had happened with the beer glass. I also inquired as to how many tables a waitress has, and he said 5.  Again, he was apologetic for our experience.  He offered us a free pazookie and took the gift card paper, and brought us the receipt and said he took care of everything.  Good thing I looked at the receipt because the waitress had charged us for TWO beers!!!!!  I asked for Brian and he was in a meeting and we got ""Roxy"".  Had to explain the whole story to her, and then she went and fixed it.  In the mean time our waitress came by and said, ""Oh she's adjusting it.""  NO APOLOGY from her!   The pizza that I always order from BJ's is definitely NOT worth the horrible service!  I will NOT be returning to the San Bernardino location ever again.  Maybe on the way to the beach, I would stop at BJ's but not here.  There is something definitely wrong with the service in the bar area and maybe Brian should address that by reducing the amount of tables a waitress has so she can give better service."
Raeanne S.,"Coronado, CA",0,2,1,1.0,6/16/2017,"This restaurant has an app that works great! Rewards and other great deals to take advantage of. It allows you to view and reorder (if you choose) from previous visits. You can view and pay your bill at the table. Super easy and efficient. I used the app today to check in a party of 6. I immediately checked in at the hostess desk when we arrived, only to learn that the wait was still another 30-40 minutes. What's the point of the ""preferred wait list"" if you still wait until the lobby is essentially cleared? Disappointing."
Charlene W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",133,28,32,1.0,8/2/2016,"We ordered dinner from BJ's brewhouse restaurant and it was the WORSE experience. We found the specific location, menu, and pricing online. We placed the order and when the food was delivered the order was incomplete and we were all so  overcharged. I contacted the location and spoke with their senior manager Lindsey, and I sent her screenshots of the pricing. Her response was that that information was not for her location, although the website specifically provided there exact location and phone number. This was the first time we patronized that restaurant and it will be the last."
Derek B.,"Highland, CA",20,1,,2.0,6/3/2017,"BJ's used to be one of the places to go but today I almost slipped and fell due to the floor being greasy. When I mentioned it to the server he just shrugged it off. Won't be back, don't need to get hurt trying to walk across the floor. Sorry BJ's no thank you."
Lauren S.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"This is probably the WORST service I have ever gotten. Our waitress was awful, the worst actually. She took forever to take our drink order, once that was done. we asked for splenda, the splenda took about 20 minutes to get to our table. Our food order took her about another 25 minutes. All in all we waited around an hour to order food and drinks. Our soups and salads took FOREVER to come out. Also when my main course came to the table, she gave me the wrong meal!!!!! now came dessert, we ordered our pazooki, and we couldn't enjoy our dessert because our plates have not been taken off the table. I am so irritated, it was my birthday meal and it was ruined! we are still waiting for our check, it has been 35 minutes and we are still waiting for our check. WORST SERVICE EVER. if you come do not get the waitress Chaale B!"
Chelsea W.,"Ontario, CA",87,3,4,5.0,4/6/2017,"I don't come to BJ's very often but I was amazed by the excellent customer service they provided, esp the bartender Justin. He knows what he is doing and is very attentive, friendly and patient. The food is tasty for the price and the whole place is relaxing."
Christine N.,"Beaumont, CA",263,21,27,4.0,1/27/2016,"This place is always a good choice of you ask me. Even though it always takes FOREVER to get a seat. The food is always good. This time I got the lemon thyme chicken. It was light and cooked well. I didn't even need additional salt or seasoning so kudos to the chef!  The only con as I stated earlier is the wait to get seated. Sometimes the hosts forget to turn on your ""beeper"" and when you go and ask about your seat hey always seem surprised that you hadn't come up earlier.  They need to improv in that department"
Carolina M.,"San Bernardino, CA",3,3,,5.0,11/15/2016,My bf had surprised me with dinner here and upon my arrival the ladies in the front were keeping me busy and entertained while they sat my bf at the table they talked to him for some time me thinking it was odd but brushed it off continued our night . Then i was able to sit down after dinner we walked to pay for our dinner and the ladies in the front said oh give me one second sir you forgot this and then he got a tiny box from them turned onto one knee and asked me to marry him!!! I WAS IN SHOCK ! SURPRISED and so happy !!  i cried the lady said surprise !!! They knew from the begging which made it so sweet of them to show caring towards his plans and also be apart of it they took pictures and everything!  GREAT STAFF GREAT FOOD ! VERY HELPFUL and did above and beyond expectations
Richard E.,"Hesperia, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/14/2017,This was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. We were waiting for our drinks and appetizers for 45 minutes we had to ask other servers for help. Maybe the waitress was not trained properly and was clearly overwhelmed. I will never come back here.
Sharron M.,"San Bernardino, CA",11,42,24,3.0,2/21/2017,Usually an okay place and tonight was no exception...EXCEPT for service. This was the worst service I've ever received here. We were only two people and our server had a big party. Still no excuse to get left out in the cold. We had to beg servers to come to our table to communicate our needs to our server. Ridiculous! Asked for balsamic glaze...it took forever. Asked for dessert. 20 minutes go by. But they were fast with the check! I asked for the manager but didn't ever get one.
Chad R.,"Hesperia, CA",1,5,,5.0,5/8/2017,Had never been here before until my family suggested we go after a family get together. I was very impressed by how attentive and nice the staff was regardless of the volume of people in the restaurant. The food had a nice filling feel to it rather than an empty feeling from greasy spoon type food. They have a nice variety of menu items and the prices vary depending on what you get. All of us were happy with our portions and taste of our food. The pazookie thing that i had never heard of was extremely tasty as well.
Ashley S.,"Colton, CA",1,6,1,2.0,10/4/2016,"Good food, it was free pazookie day so that's why we came. If you dine here, don't let your server be Abraham. My honey & I were there for almost 90 minutes for a medium pizza and two pazookies. Abraham was not attentive at all, we had to wave him down 3/5 times we spoke to him. Our drinks stayed empty unless we waved him down to ask for a refill, we waited 20 minutes for a pizza box and 5 for two boxes for pazookies. I understand they were a little busy, but it is no excuse to ignore your table.  We saw the other server Emmanuel more times than we saw Abraham. (Emmanuel was nice from what we heard, so feel free to request him)"
Albert S.,"Grand Terrace, CA",0,35,2,5.0,9/4/2017,"Eat at the bar with Amy and the group! Great drinks, food , and service.  Doesn't get any better than that!"
Kandi D.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/19/2017,"This didn't even deserve one star.Planning on a reservation for Graduation, wedding dinner, birthday etc? Be careful when calling to make reservation here. Reservation placed weeks ahead with confirmation there was space. You want to go with a large party? Forget about it. They will say yes and then not have the reservation in the book. The management, ha that's a joke. It's like hot potato. One manager passes the issue off to the other, and then the general manager doesn't even call back. Spoke to evening manager (Monday)said GM would call next morning and still waiting for a call(Friday). This location is very unprofessional. I decided to call today (Friday evening) to see why GM hasn't called, and got a response there wasn't any room, and I couldn't tell you why he hasn't called you. Evening manager called GM and all of a sudden they had an ""idea"" of making room and ""keeping the business"" for the same date. Imagine that. No thanks, If the GM would have called following morning this may have worked. Good luck to anyone attempting to book a reservation here."
Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",581,846,10004,4.0,9/26/2014,"For my most recent lunch stop here, I enjoyed a very tasty Turkey Club Sandwich with very flavorful bacon, fresh tomato slices, lettuce, mayo, and thin slices of moist white turkey meat piled up in a nice heap between toothpicked quarters of lightly toasted White Bread.   Accompanying Potato Wedges were nicely seasoned, slightly crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside.  The individual wedges were more like elongated fat fries than classic wedges of potato.  Altogether they represented a hefty supply of America's favorite white starch.  Booth seating was comfortable, and service exemplary. 4-1/2 stars overall this time out!"
Aaron S.,"Palm Desert, CA",112,11,5,5.0,4/15/2017,"Great food, fast service, and only a 15 min wait for 2 on a Saturday night.... the steak was ridiculously good. Appetizers came out fast and hot. All around great place to go. Our server Abe was on his game. Even though it was crowded he made sure we were good the whole way through."
Brooke H.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",0,50,14,5.0,2/21/2017,"Great food, and plenty of seating! Has a sports bar feel, with large tvs  scattered throughout. For those who have never been to BJs restaurant you will expect big portions! For non alcoholic drinks the home made root beer is $5 but worth every cent. Order a pazookie (large melting cookie with icecream on top) about halfway through your meal because it does take about 20 minutes to make it. Join the rewards program as they always send discounts via email. Expect a wait on weekends."
Sylvia V.,"Beaumont, CA",129,20,30,2.0,6/11/2016,"Recently went to BJ's in San Bernardino.  Waited too long to be seated, only to find that they sat us in the bar area.  Food was great, service was not.  I ordered water with my meal, they  never refilled my glass. Silverware was dirty too. Yuck!"
Terrence M.,"Riverside, CA",209,2,,4.0,4/4/2017,Good stuff amazing food. Great service. Love this place. If you don't mind the price then its worth it
Richard S.,"South Salt Lake, UT",1,9,,2.0,2/23/2017,Had the root beer barbecued wings pretty good. Had the baked ziti had very little sauce and was very greasy.  My girlfriend ordered a pizza and the waiter did not give her a plate we asked one of the hosts to bring a plate and condiments he totally ignored us had to wait another 10 minutes to get a plate. Ordered a craft rootbeer was supposed to come in a frosted mug came in a standard glass. My girlfriend ordered a beer it was warm. Also several staff members were on their cell phones texting instead of helping customers and making sure they were satisfied and were waited on properly. Was my first experience at a BJ's don't think I'll go back and less the management makes it right.
