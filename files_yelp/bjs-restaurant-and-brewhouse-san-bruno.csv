Tiffany L.,"Burlingame, CA",107,112,415,4.0,1/4/2018,"This BJ's is located inside the Tanforan mall, so there's almost always a long wait at dinner time. I've been here a few times with my family and we usually have had to wait around 40 minutes for a table, but you can walk around the mall while you wait and they text you when your table is ready. BJ's has a huge menu, with lots of options for everyone. They have vegetarian/vegan, gluten-free, low calorie, etc. options to choose from. One of my favorite entrees is the kale and roasted brussels sprouts salad ($10.95). They're pretty generous with the brussel sprouts, fruits, and other toppings. I've also enjoyed their vegetarian-style Peruvian quinoa bowl, Italiano vegetable penne, and vegetarian deep dish pizza before. Their pizookies are a delicious way to end your meal. All the flavors are delicious, but they are super sweet and rich, so bring a friend to share with!"
Al a.,"San Francisco, CA",51,17,6,2.0,1/4/2018,"Food wasn't great and it wasn't bad. Service started great. Really fast to get our drinks and our salad....then all came down hill.  Waited a long time for our food to come out, they forgot to make my girlfriends food... so we waited an extra 15 min while my food got cold. After that our server went MIA for such a long time we just decided to ask for the check and leave. Taqueria near my house has better attention to their customers. Last time coming here."
Geny K.,"South San Francisco, CA",13,19,5,5.0,12/27/2017,"We love coming here for drinks and hanging out at the bar.  The appetizers are pretty good, like the boneless sry siracha chicken wings.  The drinks are good too.  As for the entries they could use more seasoning on some of their items. Overall though a good place to come and have late eats/drinks!"
Em P.,"San Francisco, CA",503,163,127,2.0,11/21/2017,"We came at 6:30 pm which we knew was going to be busy so we were prepared to wait but not for that long!!! They reception desk told us that we would get a text in 30 minutes that our table way ready but it was actually more like 50 minutes. We were seated at 7:30 pm and waited another 15 minutes to be noticed by our server. He got out our appetizer order, drinks, and entrees. We were waiting for our appetizers to come out and to our surprise the appetizers came with our entrees! Hmm totally defeats the purpose of appetizers. To make matters worse, the appetizers were cold and they got my order wrong. SMH... Long story short I talked to the manager and he gave us the appetizers for free or so we thought. When the. I'll came the appetizers were still in the bill so I again flagged our server to resolve the issues.  It was such a tedious time! We did not leave until 9:40 pm and that was mostly the waiting period. I'm pretty disappointed with my experience here which is a bummer as they usually have better food and service."
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,3.0,12/8/2017,"The featured draft, Grand Cru, has me coming back often (to any and all BJ's locations), skipping all the way from my car to my table, then after a couple of hours, staggering and falling to my car.  With a 10.00% ABV (alcohol by volume), in itself, is staggering. The beer, the pizza, and the PIZOOKIE: =============================== There known, mainly, for these 3 things.  They have nice selection of their own brand of beers, and name brands (with my aforementioned Cru).  The pizza (Chicago-style and a few flatbreads) is good, but not great (it's thick like focaccia, but in no way close to buttery biscuit-like from Chicago).  The PIZOOKIE is a must, a hot cookie with a scoop of ice cream -- believe me, INCREDIBLE, 8 flavors to choose from plus a monkey bread, too. For food, worthy items: ================== 1.  BBQ Chicken Chop Salad [$13.95, 5.0 stars] -- You can never go wrong with this, it's perhaps the best anywhere (CPK and Wood Ranch are the other worthy places).   2.  Southern Comfort Crispy Chicken Sandwich [$12.95, 5.0 stars] -- this could not be a better sandwich, it's perfect.  Crispy fried chicken, slice of ham, bacon, Swiss cheese, Alfredo sauce, Dijon, and a great toasted bun, and it's served with fries! 3.  Root beer glazed ribs [$10.75, 4.5 stars] -- 5 baby back pork ribs with a sticky root beer glaze with a side slaw.  Best, as a snack or appetizer, too good to share. 4.  New Orleans Jambalaya [$18.50, 4.5 stars] -- Chicken breast, shrimp, chicken-andouille sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, all in a spicy Cajun broth.  So good!  Location specific: San Bruno, CA ============================= * The food is consistent with any other BJ's locations, but the service is not.  Minimal, forgetful, slow -- not how any restaurant should be remembered.  For that, it makes it an average experience. * Attached the The Shops at Tanforan mall.  Parking is odd from the Target side, but plentiful near the BJ's entrance."
Derek L.,"Daly City, CA",478,68,401,1.0,9/27/2017,"Credit to the manager who was able to address our frustration with the terrible hosting job and the waitress who served us throughout the night!  I'm sorry but I still have to leave negative feedback so that this issue can be brought up and not happen to others. Originally my party of 14 had made a reservation at 6:45pm earlier in that day.  Once we arrived, the hostess assured us that the table would be ready in 30 minutes.  30 minutes pass.  No table.  So we ask again.  The hostess tells us to wait another 30 minutes.  Apparently, the party at ""our"" table wasn't leaving yet which I can understand.   We grow hangry so my friend goes around to the back to see that there is an empty table set.  We grow suspicious whether or not that table could be for us.  So once again we ask the hostess and she claims it's for another reservation.  Alright, we wait some more.  At this point were debating whether or not we should just go eat at the food court.  But we've waited so long so might as well wait a little longer.  Another 30 minutes pass. Finally, she seats us at the exact table we had asked about. Horrible management on their part.  What should of been at max a 2 hour experience dragged out to 4.  No one wants to spend 4 hours at a restaurant. Especially not BJ's. Thankfully, the manager subsidized us with complimentary appetizers and desserts.  Still upset and frustrated about the whole experience.  We had to cancel our plans afterwards because it had already gotten too late."
Danielle S.,"Pacifica, CA",284,43,61,5.0,9/20/2017,"Came back again for that 50% large pizza deal this past Monday night and it was very crowded! It looks like the news about their weekly discount deals has definitely gotten around because it took a 25-30 minute wait for my party of three. I totally didn't mind it though -- a crowded lively BJ's is much more of an enjoyable environment compared to a half empty one.  I just wanted to give an update at how much the service had improved the second time around. The servers were so much better this time around. My friend had spilled her raspberry lemonade on the table and he was kind enough to bring us a few towels to wipe it up. It would've been nice if he helped us clean up the table himself, but I mean we are big girls we can clean up our own messes. We all got unlimited drinks (strawberry lemonade and raspberry lemonade), so refills were free, but the nice thing this time was I actually got a good number of refills! I placed my empty cup at the edge of the table and within minutes a server was walking by asking if we wanted a refill. Much better service compared to the last Monday I spent here.  At the end of the night there was a mistake on our bill (they didn't price the pizza half off!) but my server fixed it quickly and it wasn't a problem.  Overall, had a good time with a great white and limitless drinks and I'd love to come back again!"
Alan F.,"Hercules, CA",67,383,62,4.0,11/14/2017,"I stopped in at the bar Sunday afternoon; big, happy crowd, many in NFL adornment.  However, as I have my priorities, my interest centered not on the on-screen action, but on BJ's rotating seasonal:  the 18th annual edition of their Grand Cru, in the style of a Belgian tripel or strong golden ale (the  boundary between the two styles is indistinct).  10% ABV, 11 IBU.  Slightly hazy amber, one-finger head, served in its own logo glasswear.  Nose is winy and ester-y, with a touch of ripe peach.  Taste is sweet malt, banana esters, and antihistamine, with a definite alcohol warmth.  Quite nice, and a bargain at $4.00; happy hour prices apply to all house beers during NFL broadcasts.  At 10%, one goes a long way. Surprisingly, the Niners won."
Libby J.,"Los Altos, CA",300,730,281,4.0,11/11/2017,"If you aren't a friendly feller, I suggest you not sit at the bar at BJ's because you are elbow to elbow with your neighbor. And if you don't want to wait then I suggest you avoid BJ's. If you do not mind either of these -- you are ready for deep dish pizzas, pizookies, and lots of beer and sports. I mean what's there to say about BJ's? Big tv's with sports, lots of beers, expansive menu, lots of calorically dense and greasy food. It's a chain.  The atmosphere is noisy, lots of families, lots of sports fan, lots of large groups. The floors here are soooo slippery -- I was wearing boots and felt like I was on a slip and slide.  You can frequent the minimal stores in the mall while you wait or before and after (Barnes and Nobles here!). This also brings me to my PSA (parking service announcement). Thanks the heavens for ample parking here since it is a mall with not too much going on.  In summary, waits, noise, sports, sports food, beer. The end."
Teena N.,"San Francisco, CA",80,282,1258,3.0,8/26/2017,"Second time here, first time dining in.  +Spinach Artichoke dip was delicious !! Creamy goodness. +The girl waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She made sure to check on us at the right time and was very informative.  -Deep dish pizza was alright, made with fresh ingredients, but seems like a regular pizza more than a deep dish. -Clam chowder was okay, creamy not too flavorful. Added pepper, still felt like it was missing something. +Poozookie, salted caramel was delicious, next time I order it, I would ask them to ease up a bit on the caramel.  Overrall, the waitress, appetizer and dessert was what stood out to me.  Definitely coming back for the spinach dip. Enjoy!"
Siai M.,"San Francisco, CA",12,95,71,5.0,12/29/2017,"My waiter Dominiq just gave us amazing service and it was very delightful to get great customer service this time of year. We frequent this Bj's a lot and 80% of the tie our waiter/waitress seem very unhappy and hardly ever smile, but tonight was not one of those times. My amazing waiter has given me hope that not everyone here is unpleasant, his genuine awesomeness and smile made all the difference. The manager Nathan was also very nice and was even the first person to greet us at the door. Great job tonight guys! -signed a very tired and (over the holidays) mother of two!!! You've both made my Friday better."
Vivian D.,"Menlo Park, CA",1,27,,1.0,1/3/2018,"Zero stars if possible- came here with a gift card and as soon as I tried the Baked Ziti pasta, I wanted to spend the entire gift card and never come back!  Food arrived cold, the waiter took it back but didn't really seem to care, whatever I'm not here to give anyone a hard time. Main course of pasta came before my appetizer which was also cold and missing part of the item (ordered the platter and avocado egg rolls were missing). The waiter brought them separately after he himself didn't notice (he slammed the platter down and left the table so he definitely wouldn't have noticed). I really just wanted to spend the gift card and leave. I didn't even ask for the leftovers to be boxed and I love leftovers :(."
Ben T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",91,36,19,1.0,1/6/2018,"Poor service, not one single worker there smiled and seemed like they hated working there. Called in a reservation for 14 and they took our reservation. Once we got there, they didn't have our names and ended up having to break up our party into 3 smaller groups. Food came out in a timely manner but was barely warm."
Diana C.,"San Francisco, CA",277,177,404,3.0,7/18/2017,"A little overpriced but for BOGO, sure why not? Definitely a sports bar feel with tv screens overhead and broadcasting basketball games. We sat near the bar which also was near the outside patio if you wish to sit by a fire pit.  The menu is extensive and makes one scratch its head on deciding what to get. We settled on pizza and pasta and got the chicken fettuccine alfredo and a small pizza that we did half/half for toppings - 1/2 Great White and 1/2 Gourmet Five Meat. I didn't realize they were deep dish pizza. I have to say that the Great White was my favorite because I love alfredo sauce. The pasta was good too but pretty simple dish.  I downloaded their app and was able to score a free mini Pizookie and got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. If you show your waiter your app code, you can get points for your meal and you can also pay through mobile. I wasn't sure if he was coming back with a paper receipt so I just ended up paying on the app.  I would probably come back for some pizookie or bar bites/beer for a game or if there's a BOGO happening. That's about it."
Chandra D.,"Redwood City, CA",62,467,659,3.0,7/11/2017,"Dude. I haven't been to BJ's restaurant in years. When I was younger, my youth group and I used to frequent this place after many church events. It was always open late, affordable, and had a variety of entrées to appease many tastes. After my husband and I watched Hamilton in San Francisco, we took a Lyft back to the San Bruno BART station where husband's car was parked.  It was close to midnight, we were hungry, and the only thing that was open was BJ's. BJ's closes at 1 AM! We were hesitant to go to BJ's because we hadn't been in forever, but since it was open we decide to give it a try. Okay, the food is not that great and there is nothing to write home about. However, if you've just gotten out of a movie at Tanforan, or you're in need of a late night meal, BJ's has got you covered. We started off with spinach artichoke dip, but my husband and I wished we would have skipped the appetizer and had dessert instead. The shrimp tacos I ordered were mediocre at best, and I kind of wished I would have opted to order a pizza. I ordered French fries, and those weren't that good either.  Our waiter was a little spacey, but he was trying to manage multiple tables after midnight, so I gave him a pass. He forgot my fries, and it took him awhile to notice. He also forgot to refill our water glasses. Sadly, I was too full to order a pizookie. That's what I wish I would have ordered. Honestly, this place is a two-star joint, but I gave it three stars because it stays open so late. If you enjoy late nights, like a sports bar feel, and don't care too much about the quality of food, BJ's is a good late-night option."
Claudia B.,"San Francisco, CA",35,4,3,4.0,10/10/2017,"I recently tried BJ's for the first time about 2 months ago and i've come back more than 5 times already. Theres usually a long wait of about 20-40 minutes before you are seated, but the wait is definitely worth it. The Ribs are a must!!! I've order the ribs 4/5 times that i've been here & they never disappoint me! The taste of the barbecue sauce has a mixture between sweet & spicy, its delicious!. I also always order the calamari to start. Here at the Tanforan  Mall location the calamari servings are smaller than shown in my picture (the pictures are from the BJ's in Sacramento) but over all its a great place to come with friends or family.  The servers are super nice & friendly most of the time"
Michelle S.,"San Francisco, CA",206,156,520,2.0,9/9/2017,"Yikes. So the venue itself is cool.  Nice decor, great vibe.  It looks like it's decorated for adults rather than family - which I like.  So I was excited. But again, yikes.  Food came out super slow.  It took so long we almost asked, and we never ask.  The server also put our appetizers in as entrees...so our apps came out at the same time as our entrees - which was pretty frustrating. Also, two of our dishes were straight up COLD.  Like not kinda cold, like cold. Like my sweet potato fries felt like they'd been sitting out for 30 minutes.  I sent them back and the server didn't seem surprised or apologetic.  Seemed kind of like the norm... The sweet potato fries were good, my fried calamari was okay.  Our garlic knots app was okay...the couscous mac and cheese was okay...everything was okay.   I would not recommend this spot.  Only if you live in the area and your options are limited.  Too bad, seems like it has a lot of potential just misses the mark."
Shubankan J.,"Raleigh, NC",19,12,,5.0,11/16/2017,"Absolutely love this place!! :)  Food: On point. There is such a huge menu with a variety of food options (whether you're feeling pizza, burger/fries, tacos, pasta, being healthy - salads, amazing dessert selection, etc. none of it is too pricey, either.) Drinks: AMAZING!! Where else in the Bay Area can you get a happy hour beer for $4 and well drinks for $5?! The beers BJ's brews are the best (my favorite is the light switch lager as it's low in carbs, smooth taste & you can feel fine drinking more than 1).  Atmosphere: Very clean (bathrooms too), clientele is mostly/usually well dressed, polite & friendly. Bartenders and waiters/waitresses are very nice (but sometimes slow - not their fault though, they're also super busy as the place is always completely packed?)  Prices: VERY GOOD. I suggest whether you're there to watch football, have a beer or just catch up with a friend, you go during happy hour times - the beers, food, appetizers are pretty cheap).  Other: They're pretty accommodating :) I asked them to put on the Panthers game instead of a NBA game that no one was watching & they were more than happy to listen to my request promptly. Other than that, service is usually pretty slow, if you're okay being distracted chatting it up with a friend, watching sports or scrolling Instagram on your phone, this place really doesn't have any ""negatives"".  Okay that's it! Go try it for yourself - I give it a 10/10 for sure.."
Finau F.,"Millbrae, CA",169,47,130,3.0,9/15/2017,This is definitely a place you can resort to if court food doesn't cut it for you in the mall!  Personally after trying a handful of entrees I only seem to get the two same things each time I come here Parmesan Chicken and the infamous cookies n' cream Pizookie!  There's always a long wait but it's nice there's a Barnes&Noble and different shops near to roam around until they text you with your table ready!  Customer service could be improved but in such a busy chaotic place that's obviously asking to much of these young waiters/waitresses.
Elijah B.,"Martinez, CA",200,362,440,1.0,9/27/2017,"Food is generic here. Came and sat at the bar, ordered through the app, got my food etc. Here is was triggered me; since me and my date were just here for a couple drinks and a pizookie, I thought I would just pay in the app early, since we already had a couple drinks and the pizookie.  Well, after I paid via the app, the server did not come by once ever again. Did not ask if we wanted anything else (we were actually gonna get another drink), or ask if we were ok etc. Anyway, we were there for another 30 minutes after I paid, and she did not come by. She did actually look like she was having a bad day, no smiling, legit just working. Sucks for you missy, but maybe be a bit more professional and not bring your personal life into the work place... Other than that, I always come here, but the service is always slow, why is that?!"
Monica M.,"San Francisco, CA",232,105,309,1.0,9/1/2017,Let me first off and say thank you to the manager and the server for trying to make a horrible night better . We had an horrible evening here due to the kitchen staff not paying attention to orders . We came into this location after a night of back to school shopping we made a huge mistake . We first started off with drinks then we order appetizer . We ordered chicken wings served with dirty celery (picture to follow) . Then ordered a split pizza that was suppose to be half combo and have buffalo pizza . The kitchen made it barbecue chicken not buffalo . Contacted the server and to make it right she was going to have a new pizza made and it came out barbecue AGAIN ! Not sure what's going on in the back kitchen but we will not be returning ever again . Oh and their floors are so sticky and slippery ! Could have fallen on their dirty floors !
Anita L.,"Union City, CA",347,627,385,3.0,8/18/2017,"The roasted shrimp peruvian quinoa bowl was surprisingly good and (supposedly) pretty healthy for you too. It was a win in my book. They also have a decent beer selection here. However, there are never any new offerings so the selection becomes a little stale. Being a ""brewery"", I would advise corporate management to really look at introducing more variations of beer.  The San Bruno location is always packed whenever I come and the wait is usually quoted at being close to an hour for two people. It's a 50% chance of being able to nab a seat in the bar area."
Deja O.,"Fallbrook, CA",11,101,55,5.0,11/6/2017,"After reading the bad reviews, I was prepared to have bad service. However, our waiter was fantastic. It was a busy night and he still managed to check on us several times. The food was great. He even gave us dessert recommendations. I wish I remembered his name though!!"
Seyla S.,"San Francisco, CA",60,5,18,5.0,8/18/2017,I'll been this place 4x now. Had a problem but once again the manager efraim made it all good very hospitable and nice. He made sure our food came out quick! Greet service!!! Thank you again Efraim ur the BEST!!!!
temo g.,"Daly City, CA",35,24,8,1.0,9/4/2017,"I went there with the family for a post movie meal. Huge mistake... I ordered the soup and salad. The salad was just okay with a bottle flavored dressing.  The soup, clam chowder was horrible. First off, it was supposed to be a bowl and not a cup so I expected a lot more. It did actually comes in a bowl but was only filled about 25%... I literally put my spoon into it and hit bottom! There was only about half an inch of soup! It was cold and nasty. Wife ordered the shrimp with quinoa. She had about 3 bites and said it was disgusting. The kids shared a brewery pizza. It was soo greasy and disgusting my starving kids didn't even finish a slice each. What hungry kids turn away pizza?! Never! This place used to be good. It just seems to get worse each time... Yuck!"
Eddy N.,"San Francisco, CA",39,259,2,5.0,11/3/2017,"When going to Tanforan mall, and wanting something outside of the food court, BJ's is the best choice. We went with our friends, a total group of 7 with kids, and we had a great meal. We ordered the spinach dip, avocado egg rolls, and they were both delicious. We ordered some sandwiches, tacos and salads, and everything was really tasty. The BJ's beers are solid, and they also offer other great local beers. Best yet, we got the pizookie (warm cookie with ice cream). Our server Heaven, was attentive and very friendly. We'll definitely be coming back!"
Chellez B.,"Oakland, CA",42,1,,5.0,12/22/2017,"Great food, great drinks and great service. The manager Efram is really good and helpful. He recommended some awesome food to try. Thank you will definitely come back again :)"
Debbie V.,"Clovis, CA",0,25,17,1.0,12/22/2017,"Waited 20 minutes for multiple open tables while the airhead teenaged front hostess staff f*cked around and talked about mindless garbage. After waiting for one of them to actually do their job we were told ""OMG yes! You can take one of those tables."" Glad I did her job for her or who knows how long we would have sat there. Waiter took orders from his section that we were sat in, gave us one menu, didnt ask about drinks etc. Runners brought out food and waiter continued to ignore our table. No waters, silverware, nothing-- we waited 20 minutes AGAIN. A total of 40 minutes we will never get back. Never coming back. Unless of course they can get a babysitter for the children running the place."
Joshua M.,"San Francisco, CA",161,407,1538,2.0,8/21/2017,"I've been to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse at Tanforan a twice to celebrate certain events. My first visit here, everything was decent in that the food wasn't all too bad nor that great. It was simple American food to make for a good casual dinner in a setting that is nice for conversation. I did really enjoy one of their desserts though which was like a giant cookie with ice cream on top. However, upon my second visit here, I ordered a potato dish that I just couldn't eat. I think they did a poor job cleaning their dishes because the potato had the smell and taste of washing detergent which really deterred me from coming back."
Joanna T.,"Fremont, CA",109,5,12,3.0,10/31/2017,"$3 Pizookie's for the month of October. My friend and I got our pizookie's before my boyfriend. My boyfriend received his after my friend finished his and I already ate half... give it a 3.5 stars, waitress checked on our order."
Dina Y.,"Burlingame, CA",0,3,1,4.0,12/9/2017,"For my family, BJ's is our ""go to"" restraunt.  It's close by, the food is usually good, sometimes great, and it's cost effective.  Being semi regulars at this establishment we are more than well aware of the exorbitant wait times that are fairly customary here. However,  good service can always make or break an experience.   We arrived last night around 8pm to get a table for 5.  The wait was 90 minutes. However,  bar seating is open and my husband was lucky enough to find us a table.  Although it wasn't cleared from the previous patrons we quickly ran over to proclaim it ours.  Anything is better than waiting 90 min for a table at 8pm when your hungry!  It took about 5 min to get the table cleaned and then a lovely waitress by the name of Sierra came over.  She was upbeat, extremely friendly,  helpful and was interested in making our experience as pleasant as possible under the extreme circumstances of having a full house.   She got drinks and an appitizer to our table as quickly as possible.  It still took an hour to get food but she kept checking on us (but not annoyingly) and kept our drinks full. She really is an awesome server who turned a potentially bad experience into a positive experience.  Thank you Sierra! You are awesome! Having a server like Sierra and consistently good food is why we continue coming to BJ's... even if we have to wait.   Sierra you get 5 stars for your service!   But I have to give an overall experience of 4 stars because we still spent 2.5 hrs there and only 30-40 min of that time was spent eating. #noonelikestowaitthatlong Ps. We did not like the Grand Cru brew at all! It tasted like rubbing alcohol...super strong like someone put 2 shots of cheap vodka in my beer! I Love beer and my husband and I love their Jeremiah Red and Oasis brew. I even like the bitterness of IPA's... but I didn't like the Grand Cru at all."
Diana G.,"El Granada, CA",3,130,49,3.0,1/29/2017,"Service was excellent. The young lady was very nice. However, the food was just okay. Calamari was minimal. For the price, we should have received an appetizer that could be shared. The size served could have been eaten by one person and they still would have left hungry.  We also order a BJ Favorites Deep Dish  pizza. In my opinion this is not a deep dish pizza and the name should be changed. This is a ""Thick Crust"" pizza and not deep dish. Was disappointed to discover that it was nothing but a bunch of bread with minimal toppings and sauce. It was just okay in flavor. The tomatoes need to me omitted or substituted for fresh tomatoes. They tasted like they were canned tomatoes.  Also had a beer and cider. The carbonation is way off. The cider tasted more like soda.  The stars all go to the young lady (Daniela, I think).  It's okay to come here, but be picky about what you order."
Jasmine N.,"West Menlo Park, CA",208,14,8,4.0,10/14/2017,"My cousin and I had gone to dinner here last night and had a wonderful waitress who seemed to care about us then not even 5 minutes into her shift with us, she had to go to the bar and serve drinks. She left us with a new waitress in which we were ok with. I had a parmesan chicken last night with mashed potatoes and broccoli! It was good but I did expect the dish to be a little hotter. I had asked for butter to put on my broccoli from my waitress and she forgot (I don't blame her for forgetting once).  I had asked for a water and she forgot again. Ok, that was not what I was expecting. She brought it over and then asked my cousin and I wanted desserts. We told her we'll wait for a few minutes to think on it. She came around literally a few minutes later and we were talking and she barged in just by standing there expecting us to give her what we wanted. It was us that held her up but at least she should've been more considerate in waiting til we were actually ready to order.  We finally ordered the Pizookies and enjoyed them fully! :) Our waitress came and gave us our bill and again, she expected us to hurry and pay it. We were still enjoying our desserts but seriously! She did this at least 3 or 4 other times which made me almost upset that I wasn't going to pay her!  I will eat here again but the service I was given, was just a 5 or less stars. Food is amazing thought!  I didn't like how I felt rushed neither forgotten about. :/"
Ricardo Y.,"Millbrae, CA",0,5,14,1.0,12/25/2017,Stay away.  Over priced.  App took 15 minuets to come out.  My lady's food came out 1 minutes after that and mine took 10 minuets after that.  Her sandwich if you can call it that had enough chicken to cover half the bun maybe and to top it off her night ended way later because she got food poisoning.  Won't ever be going to any BJ's locations especially this one.

The food is always good and my server was amazing. I think her name was Angelina. Super nice and was always checking in to see how i was doing and how the food was. I like when the servers actually dont forget about us customers. Thats happened alot at the BJs near where i live. Anyways Angelina was awesome, the food was great and ill be in again during my next visit out there."

My pizza needed  a few more minutes in the oven, I wish the pizza was a hot as the pan it came in was . A runner brought it to the table so I think it was sitting out for a bit. Some of the toppings were not even cooked Overall overpriced for below average pizza"

Ehm.aye T.,"Hercules, CA",67,19,19,1.0,10/25/2017,"I think the only things this place has going for it is that its: -Close to the airport -An alternative to watching a sports event     when Hooters is not an option Last night was the last time my family and I are going to frequent this location. The service was horrible and I will go into further detail as to how last night went. When we got to the hostess desk, she was having a conversation with a server. Judging from the site of it, it did not look business related since the server she was chatting it up with did not even bother to tell the hostess there were people behind her. I told her my group was a party of four; but the hostess there didn't even put is in the system. Another one who was passing by did. The first one was probably new, but I don't think it is justifiable by any means. Wait time was 45 minutes. But after a while the entrance had cleared out of people and there were only two groups of people left. THE HOSTESS WHO DID NOT PUT US IN THE SYSTEM ASKS IF WE WERE WAITING FOR A TABLE. We've only been in the restaurant for the last 30-40 minutes and you saw me come in and you ask me this?!? She says, ""Give me 10 minutes."" We waited and were getting impatient because my mother had a flight to catch soon.  The hostess found us a booth to sit in, but it was still dirty with food particles. She offered to clean it up - With the used napkin on the table and not looking at all the crumbs on the floor of the booth. It was only until the busboy gets the plates and silverware, she got a damp cloth to clean the table. This is just not acceptable, but she apologizes; and we politely accepted.  Our server Michelle seemed a bit apathetic. Maybe it was an off night? Or maybe they were short staffed because someone went on break. I am not sure. I think from the get-go it made our dining experience unpleasant. We actually ended up boxing up our food to go because my Mom was gonna be late for our flight. We weren't even offered dessert! All in all it, seemed like employees at this restaurant seem to be doing their own thing and were not helping each other. Again, perhaps it was on off night. But I will end here and say to my fellow yelpers: you have been warned. Slow, inattentive service. Please get your act together BJ's."

Also, you can get a full rack of ribs, with a salad, side, and dessert (or two desserts) for just $19.99. Overall a great value, very tasty, and it's not too crowded after 10pm."
