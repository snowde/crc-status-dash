David D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",218,21,29,1.0,8/14/2016,"Submitted a Complete Mobile Order at 8:10pm. Set my arrival time for 8:45pm. The system would not let me pay. I arrived to BJ's in San Bruno at 8:44pm. I was told by the hostess that there is a 24 minute wait for an available table, even though I placed my order 45 minutes previously. I was sat at 9:10pm, and given a menu, even though I mentioned to the server and hostess that I submitted a mobile order.  My server asked to confirm my order repeatedly....it's now 9:22pm....and we're leaving. We'll try again in 3 weeks when the schedules for a family of 6 can be coordinated. Been waiting all week for some BJ's pizza. Oh well. Thanks anyway.  And do me a favor, Do not send anything. No free food. A response is unnecessary.  We will do things right next time."
Mike R.,"Antelope, CA",0,10,,3.0,7/3/2017,"The place is a little dirty , not a pleasant feeling inside the restaurant. The food is good but I would recommend the manager to take a closer look at the tidyness of the place"
Nicole A.,"San Bruno, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/2/2016,"We've eaten here quite a few times. Always a bit of a wait to be seated, usually quite busy. Food is good though, I've never had an issue.  We've ordered to go 2 times from their website which could use some improvement but overall I'm not sure why this place is being rated so poorly."
Brian B.,"Columbus, OH",13,64,2,4.0,8/13/2016,"While vacationing in the San Fran area with my son and his friend (both 18), we stopped here for lunch and some shopping.  The service was great and the food was amazing.  While I was hesitant to eat at a chain restaurant, I was glad we did.  I had the Mediterranean Chicken tacos (amazing!) and my son and his friend had the chicken alfredo and chicken bacon ranch piadia - we were all happy and would definitely go back again.

Bryant C.,"San Francisco, CA",210,135,88,1.0,2/23/2016,"A sad shell of what this place used to be, they've kept their pizza and pizooki and streamlined everything else to be the next Cheesecake factory (or possibly Chili's). This place caters to the easy goers looking for a meal already decided for them and the business plan seems to be working out as there is always a wait. It's a comfortable environment to hang out and have a beer, but the restaurant has fallen to the wayside. FOOD: Avocado egg rolls were somehow served to us cold. Maybe they forgot to put it under the little heater as they waited to bring it to us (even though this was the appetizer). The whole thing was overly salted and the texture was as if it had been put into the fridge for a week then reheated. Then left out on the counter to recool. Then served. Stale. Terrible. The jambalaya was pretty flavorless. An incoherent mess of ingredients tried to be brought together in my usual favorite fashion: oil! Unfortunately, it somehow backfired and was terrible. Dirty greasy food is my favorite type of food and they still butchered it. An absolute travesty when compared to elephant bar's. Maybe I'm bitter that they got rid of my 3 favorite things (open faced chili cheese burger, nachos, and shrimp carbonara), but the food they served me was objectively bad. This used to always be a safe bet, but when you drop the ball like this, my opinions change. I simply cannot support a place that serves me food like this."
Nerissa V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/1/2017,"My family & I had lunch today & sat at an open table in the bar area. The waiter took awhile to clean the table & left the high chair from the previous people who sat there. The waiter was hard to hear & was not that friendly. He brought out the wrong dish, was not apologetic, but then brought the correct dish. He then told us he was not our waiter, pointed at another waiter & told us he was our waiter. My son accidentally spilled his water glass, the new waiter came to us to see if we were ok. We then asked for a towel or napkins. He brought us a rag & said ""here you you to wipe the water"". I had to ask for a drink refill & the check. They took a long time to pick up the check that I went to look for the waiter. We were not happy with the service."
Michael N.,"Daly City, CA",71,47,4,3.0,5/21/2017,"I like the new menu and the diverse offerings. It makes me want to come back and try different things. I just wish the service was better. My server started off well enough, but kept forgetting things after that. I had to ask for more water even though my glass was nearly empty. They brought the wrong side dish for my daughter. After I pointed it out, they made us wait only to bring the same wrong side dish again! I mean, really. I asked for a box for the leftovers, twice. I had a coupon that wasn't reflected on the bill. And so on. If they cared just a little they could get it right. I had a hard time tipping 15% today."
rob a.,"San Francisco, CA",143,22,9,1.0,5/9/2017,"Salad and soup are not unlimited here. Server said she'll be back but saw her after 20 min without my second soup and salad! It was mid day. Not even busy. Ordered from a kids menu for a 3 year old and he didn't get his chocolate milk until we were all done eating and ready for the bill. The server had never checked on us to see if we needed anything else, had to flag down the other server to get our attention. Very Bad service!!"
Kimberly G.,"Visitacion Valley, San Francisco, CA",32,16,38,1.0,8/28/2016,"** THE MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE ** I came in on a late Saturday night to grab a couple of drinks and have some food . This is how my experience went & why I gave it one star . The ambiance is okay not cozy , the food is bland there isn't that much flavor but for some reason I keep coming back . I had this elderly white man was our waiter he was disinterested to help us he did not seem to like us or he must of had a bad day & we ended up getting the short part of the stick .  We tried to order some drinks & for some odd apparent reason he would take years to come back with the correct one .  He was not consistent with us ; he would hardly pass by to our table  but he would go to the other tables more than he came over to here  : He was just not a pleasant experience I don't think I'm going to come back here . It's really not that good nor worth it .  So on that note . .  It was super crappy food & service ."
Daniel G.,"Suisun City, CA",0,5,1,1.0,6/3/2017,"I used to like coming to BJ's, the food was great and the beer selection was one of the better ones that micro brewery's had to offer.  This BJ's is one of the worst I've been too...I'm not sure if they got different cooks or the cooks there just suck all together because the food is mediocre at best...calamari is always way over fried, the service is terrible and I'm pretty sure my burger moo'd at me when it was brought out...the beer is still good but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here and have a drink....the only thing that would get me to come back is if they offered what their name suggests if you know what I mean"
Retired Reefer A.,"Daly City, CA",68,55,4,5.0,7/9/2017,"my family and i decided to give this place another shot after personally speaking to the manager Eugene Ochoa over the phone.  i described everything that happened on the night we had our terrible experience and he was very receptive to hearing all the criticism i had, where they fell short and personal recommendations on how they could do better.  overall the conversation was positive and left me optimistic for our next visit to BJ's. The next visit we took advantage of their online reservation system to ensure we wouldnt have to wait as long in the event that the place was busy. upon arrival we were seated within 5 mins with maybe about 4 parties already waiting.  my biggest gripe on the last visit was that we were unquoted on the waittime and ended up getting passed up by other parties that had reserved online.  had i known about this service i wouldve reserved online. ordered our food and drinks, both of which came out in in a reasonble amount of time. food was good and overall experience was similar to the positive ones we've had here so i chalk up the last experience of one that was a flyer. it was a busy night. there were some mistakes made that ruined our experience.  i applaud the management for actually reading these reviews and making attempts to try to improve based on real customer feedback.  thank you eugene"
Terri R.,"Sonoma, CA",1,18,5,2.0,5/31/2017,Food was good but the wait was ridiculous. 35 min for our appetizers then another 30 min wait for entrees..
Nisa B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/26/2017,"I've always loved coming to BJ's but last night the service was phenomenal! My server Michelle recommended great items last night and I was pleased with every one of them! The Brewhouse Blonde was great, not to mention only $4! The Portobello Mushroom Burger was awesome too and to finish it off with a churro pizookie for only $3? AMAZING. Thank you again Michelle!"
Cheryle M.,"Patterson, CA",0,1,2,1.0,5/25/2017,"I dont live in this city but often stay in the area when I'm on a business trip.  I really liked BJs until we visited this one.  We were immediately seated but once seated, the only time our waitress came back to our table was to  take our chair to another table.  The couple that came in 10 minutes after us (behind us) was waited on starting with the  beverages and then the order.    After being there 20 minutes we quietly got up and left.  We were not missed. Service was Below Stsndard and I will share this information.  Too bad I have to give a star."
Patrice B.,"Daly City, CA",0,14,3,2.0,9/8/2017,"Ordered online and our food wasn't ready when promised, which made my son late for work. 30 minutes waiting for food is pushing it when dining in, for pickup, unacceptable. Management needs to be upgraded."
Carolyn M.,"Outer Richmond, San Francisco, CA",1,1,,1.0,5/5/2017,Off tip this place SUCKs... when you first walk in the  host and hostess have not idea what customer service is all about
Mike C.,"San Francisco, CA",613,1037,3949,4.0,11/17/2015,"Echoing a lot of Cherylynn N's sentiments ( ) on chain restaurants, I tempered my expectations on a recent weekday lunch here.  Arriving around 11:30 am, the spacious restaurant was already about 1/3rd full with most diners in the bar area.  There are no shortages of televisions so I can imagine the vibe on game days or game nights; in fact, a friend shared that he had a ball watching the NBA Finals here in June.   After checking in, we were guided to a booth in the center dining area.  The menu is pretty large so, being my first time here, I quickly a checked the Yelp highlights for ideas.  Here's what I had and shared:  Shared appetizers 1) Potato skins ( ) - 2) Fried calamari ( ) - Entrée 3) Turkey, ham, and bacon sandwich with side of fries ( ) and a bowl of chili ( ) - I also started with a strawberry lemonade ( ) which hit the spot.  At $3.25 with refills, this also was a deal. The food was okay and better than average for the price.  My friend enjoyed her clam chowder and deep dish pepperoni pizza which I will try next time.  The two apps for two people with entrees were a bit much for us.  She took home about half of the calamari and I did the same with the potato skins.  There were a couple of service inconsistencies that dampened our experience.  Perhaps because we were slow in finishing our apps, the entrees came before we finished our bowls of soup which made the table very small.  Also, in trying to hail our waitress Jacqueline, we had a difficult time finding her as it seemed that she was busy somewhere else.  Looked like she was doing a solo for our area, the window sections had two waiters tending those customers.  Might consider the business flow in assigning the staff. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, a bit cheaper than Jack's, but with a larger selection of food.   Most of my Yelp friends gave two or three stars, but maybe I was just fortunate to catch them on a good day!"
Allison T.,"San Mateo, CA",0,22,,1.0,4/30/2017,Horrible service. Went with several family members and ignored for twenty minutes just to even get seated. Finally seated and then 20 minutes go by before we even see a server. Waitress helped a table literally right next to us that were seated around the same time as us but we were totally ignored. our food took way too long and thanks to the missing waitress we had to get up and hunt someone down to ask where our food was twice! The icing on the cake was that the food sucked definitely tasted like it had been sitting under food lamps and forgotten about. Pizookie  was hard and disappointing. They even had the gall to charge us. Poor poor service. Stay far far away!! In hindsight we should have just got up and left. Oh and this was for a visit yesterday evening 4/29/17
Larry F.,"Daly City, CA",31,37,16,5.0,12/20/2016,"I've never written an Yelp review for this place, until now! They kept on asking me why I keep coming here and never reviewed. To put it simple, for all the times I eat out for lunch, mostly, and dinner, BJ's comes to the plate and deliver a consistent service and very few ""hiccups"" that I've experienced in recent visits to other restaurants. Prices are reasonable and menu is robust. Will come again!"
Aaron M.,"San Francisco, CA",324,760,78,4.0,12/31/2015,"My parade of positive reviews of chain restaurants continues!  Look, BJs has great pizza, and decent beer, and it's open even after your movie on the other end of the mall.  The avocado egg rolls and the tuna poke are great too.  If you order anything else you're really gambling and I don't know why you're doing it (or why they even let you, to be honest).  Also, if you decide to (or have to) wait for a real table here, it could be awhile - snag seats at the bar if possible. The vegetarian toppings for the pizza are especially tasty, namely the ""seasoned tomatoes"" which is really just like the best chunky tomato sauce you've ever had.   Mushrooms and black olives also work well. Oh!  And they have an after-work happy hour on Fridays, a late happy hour after 10pm Sundays, and BOTH of them every other day of the week except Saturday when you get none.  The mini pizzas and beers (which are the only things you should be getting here anyway) are heavily discounted.  Do it."
