Kim L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,"It saddens me to write this review as I have been a loyal BJs guest for years.  Service has always been an issue at this BJ's (front desk greeters always seem too distracted by their phones or talking to each other to greet, waiters are moving too quick to listen to your order, food comes out slow, etc), but this experience was BY FAR the most disappointing I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I had just come out of seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi on a complete high.  We were pumped from the movie and ready to discuss more over some yummy food and potentially, a pizookie! We walked in, gave our name, and the greeter said ""Ok about 30-45 minutes."" Not a problem at all - a wait was to be expected on a Saturday night during primetime.  (not to mention we signed in and put our name using our BJ's Loyalty phone #).  About 30 minutes had passed by and we were starting to get antsy, anxiously awaiting the text message that our table was ready....45 minutes passed...still no text.  I, very nicely, walk up to the front desk guy to ask him if there was an update on our table.  The two guys at the counter looked confused when I said my name and that I have not received a text yet.  They said ""Ok - we will get you seated as soon as possible. It's going to be a minute or so.""  First of all, I've seen multiple parties of 2 come in and give their name and get seated on the spot, which was weird since we had been waiting nearly an hour.  Secondly, I've already been waiting longer than the original given time so ""a minute or so"" doesn't really give me any hope.  I sit down, annoyed but still understanding, since they seemed swamped.  An hour+ goes by and I see the couple that walked in right in front of us get seated, then more groups of 2. ...Finally about an hour and 20 minutes later, we finally get seated....we get walked to our table by a very nice lady, she seats us, we decide what we want to order, and we give the sign that we are ready (close our menus).  A waiter takes the order from the table right next to us and walks right by our table..not even saying ""hello"" or ""I'll be right with you"".  2-3 more minutes pass and we are still sitting there with waiters walking passed us like we were invisible.  After nearly 20 minutes of sitting at our table with NOBODY asking us how we were doing or even getting us water, we are too frustrated and decide to leave.  Not ONE PERSON said anything to us as we got up and left our table...I walked up to the front guy and shared with him how long we had been sitting there, with no one asking us how we were doing, my frustrations, etc.  I wish i could have spoken to a manager because, although it was not this guy's fault, he couldn't have cared any less that he was losing 2 guests who would have paid $50+ for dinner + dessert.   I love coming to BJ's for a good, well-priced meal but after this past Saturday's experience, I am going to have to reconsider coming back here for a while."
E F.,"San Francisco, CA",2,126,,4.0,8/24/2017,"Let's be honest - all the dishes are predictable American classics, but the execution is pretty darn good for a chain. Friendly efficient staff. Cool for hanging in the sports bar also cool for families in the restaurant. Much to like here."
C R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,14,5.0,10/17/2016,"Their strawberry beignet is delicious! Oh my! I recommend to share this dessert along with the churro pazookie. Just the right amount of sugar delights. The overall service can be delayed if it is busy. However, it has improved tremendously over the last year."
Olivia H.,"San Francisco, CA",152,55,9,3.0,3/28/2017,"The food is good and exactly what you would expect from a BJs. My friends and I are partial to their appetizers, particularly the spinach artichoke dip and Sriracha Brussels sprouts.  It's not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but this place is consistently overcrowded. Wait times in any time approaching dinner are out of this world, and we have frequently left after discovering it would take over an hour and a half to seat two diners. Since the service is generally slow, it's not too surprising that they cannot open up tables more quickly. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations, either, so there is little chance to get ahead of the rush. I tried the ""priority waitlist"" option they now offer throught the BJs app, and they did not grant us any priority, and one host acknowledged they had forgotten our names had even been put in.  The menus are sticky, and requests to change TV channels are rarely honored, although they claim they will do it. It's an overcrowded American-style chain restaurant--sometimes the tasty bar-food apps are worth it, sometimes they're not."
Denise B.,"Irvine, CA",2,14,6,3.0,10/14/2017,"My experience at BJs was overall excellent. My server 'Chelle was really really great, she made sure that we left with a smile on our face."
Jennifer M.,"Hayward, CA",2,10,3,1.0,12/9/2017,"Went here for dinner with friends and called ahead for a table. We got seated quickly, but we never had someone come to our table as a server. After waiting for 30 minutes and asking who our server was we decided to leave since no one could help us. This is the worst service myself and my friends have received at a restaurant. Never coming back to this BJs again!"
Shilpa S.,"San Jose, CA",7,43,132,4.0,3/12/2017,"Great neighborhood spot! Sat in the patio area on a beautiful sunny afternoon. Even though the patio was covered only by one server he provided great service!! Drinks came quickly and cocktails are made well :)  our server despite being so busy made sure he adjusted the umbrella so that our baby wasn't in direct sunlight.  Why I would go there again... Great variety of food and drinks, Indoor and outdoor seating, good service, clean bathrooms with diaper changing station!!"
Clifford W.,"Daly City, CA",13,409,1024,3.0,3/26/2017,"Snack here in San Bruno shopping mall. Ordered light since we had dinner waiting at home. Deep dish pizza and drinks were good, service a little slow for off lunch/dinner time, and tv to watch basketball while waiting. Only con was the plastic coated menus could use a good wipe down with degreaser/soap as both menus were sticky and grimy."
Alex B.,"Oyster Point, CA",47,24,,2.0,5/12/2017,"I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes, it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar, I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes, but of course, there are shining exceptions.  The food is decent for the most part, with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times, and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard, but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas. While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller, contrarily, entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much, but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable. Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food, but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth."
Joy W.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",187,441,2629,3.0,3/5/2016,"BJ's is on par with all the other chain restaurants. So, I don't see why people would wait an hour for a table at BJ's, except maybe because it's one of the only sit-down restaurants with waiter service in the Tanforan mall. *To reduce the wait time, you can  1. Call ahead to be put on the waitlist.  2. Now, you can also download their mobile app and use the Preferred Waitlist function.  3. You can even place your order for dining in on their website. 4. The bar area is open seating.* They try to cater to very different demographics. I get it, they're trying to capture as much market demand as the area has to offer. It's half a sports bar and half a family restaurant, which makes it rather confusing and not very optimal for either dining group. Sometimes you sit next to a tipsy frat boy, sometimes next to a screaming baby. Sometimes, you're within earshot of both. I'm just kidding...sort of. I've never been a fan because BJ's doesn't have many distinguishing signature dishes that sets it apart from other casual dining establishments. Wait, there are the Avocado Egg Rolls & Pizzookies...meh. Oh, and a decent beer selection. Avocado Egg Rolls - avocados, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, chipotle peppers & spices, with sweet tamarind sauce: Pretty good idea taking something good and fatty, wrapping it in spring roll wrappers and frying them. Crunchy & creamy, sweet and a just a little bit spicy.  Not bad, but I can't stomach too many, because they're so oily and heavy. After a couple of these, they just feel like a lot of mush in my mouth. One too many and it would make me a little nauseous. As for the Pizzookie - the beloved pizza/cookie (cookie large enough to share) topped with ice cream. Frankly, I prefer cookies that are already individual-sized so I wouldn't need the use of a knife and fork. Yes it's good. Cookies and ice cream tasting good is like telling me the sky is blue. It's also a fine example of taking something that already exists and giving it a catchy name. Good marketing, but not exactly a novel idea. That's a little harsh. They do come in different flavors, after all. For more of a substantial meal, I usually get a burger. Burgers are always a fail-safe option in diners. The beef is usually cooked nearly well done, but they're meaty and filling, and that's all that matters. The pizzas are not bad. Although, the deep dish pizzas really shouldn't be called 'deep-dish.' It's more like thick doughy bread with some cheesy toppings. Ever since the FDA required chain restaurants to include nutritional info on their menus, I admit it somewhat influenced my decisions...briefly. I tried a salad, which I rarely do, because I usually prefer to make my own salad than pay a high mark-up for a dressed up pile of lettuce. But it turned out to be a pretty good salad. Santa Fe Salad - romaine, blackened chicken breast, red peppers, jack and cheddar, avocado, corn, diced tomatoes and corn tortilla strips w/ Santa Fe dressing: I chose the Santa Fe, because I like crunchy tortilla strips in my salads. They're like less-dense croutons with the same satisfying crunch. The dressing was creamy, but not heavy. Chicken was seasoned well. The ingredients tasted fresh and crisp. Chicken Wings drizzled w/ buffalo & ranch sauces are A-okay.  We once received some raw chicken though. To be fair, it was only raw in the center. I understand mistakes happen, but they should have frying chicken down to a science. We told our waiter about the raw chicken and he was apologetic, super polite and friendly. They comped our chicken and brought out our second plate of cooked chicken. In my opinion, I kind of thought our meal should have been comped. Raw poultry is not to be taken lightly. Overall, the menu is, in a word, boring. That is to be expected, because it is still meant to cater to the masses. Still, I never find myself WANTING to visit BJ's. It's just an okay option if you're hungry after watching a movie. Mr. Joy likes this place for their happy hour deals, but after the raw chicken incident, I finally told him I have no interest in returning BJ's again. Raw food or not, there's really nothing at BJ's that I crave. On the plus side, I've always enjoyed the snakebites here.  Also, I've always found the service to be pretty damn good. I don't know if my server was gunning for a big tip, but he brought me a refill of my drink before I even took a sip of my first one.  Another time, I stupidly left my cell phone in one of the booths once. I came back all worried and harebrained, but my waiter kept it safe for me. What a great guy."
Dinna G.,"Berkeley, CA",0,12,,4.0,12/15/2017,"Xmas time is here again. For some reason I already seem to buy too many of their gift cards. But darn, those mugs are great. You have to collect them all! I just wish the wait for a table was shorter at this place."
Stephanie A.,"Millbrae, CA",0,5,1,3.0,8/20/2017,"Three stars for the food and ambience (let's face it, half the menu is frozen). But 5 stars goes to our waitress Asia. She was so sweet and attentive- she made an otherwise mediocre experience exceptional!  ** Added by my Mom: Tell them she was outstanding! Lollll"
Robert F.,"San Francisco, CA",89,658,4224,3.0,5/8/2016,"Came here about 2 weeks ago and it was an interesting experience for sure! When I arrived I was informed that the bar was open and that the floor seating was full. That was fine so my party and I decided to walk around and wait for a table to open up.  After shopping around at the near by Barnes and Nobles the timer went off and the table was ready. Upon returning to the restaurant my group and I were seated and handed menus. The menu is just as advertised. Lots of choices to choose from if you have a big appetite. If you like beer this place is for YOU!  There are several TVs here which is great because the NBA playoffs were on and that was a primary reason for stopping by to eat lunch. I wanted to at least watch till halftime before leaving but we left midway through the 2 quarter.  My issue with this place stemmed from the server. He was just not attentive or interested in serving anyone. The way in which he placed the plates on the table to serve us was nonchalantly. I mean, if you don't care about getting a tip or tipped well I get it. Or, maybe you just didn't feel like coming in today. I was not sure what the issue was but it was not necessary.  I will come back and give the bar a try next time. I have heard good reviews about the drinks and the bartenders. Also, the beer selection here is worthy trying as well."
Roni L.,"South San Francisco, CA",10,335,4,1.0,9/22/2017,"I get sucked in by the okay food and brews and then forget how sucky the service is.  It's sooooo bad.  Forgotten food, no refills, overcharges, the list goes on and on."
D L.,"San Francisco, CA",2,89,55,2.0,4/14/2017,"This place is just like being next to a college campus. The service is so-so, at best.  The table was dirty when the hostess sat us. The napkins withe the silverware inside... well just a fork.  When the food was dropped off and the server dropped it off and ran. I g ad to waive down the waiters to ask for ketchup, mustard, and some knives."
Vee T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2017,I had just flown into town and was starving.... my husband and I came across this BJ restaurant because it was close to our hotel. We got seated right away and were greeted by a friendly server. My husband ordered a hamburger and I ordered a salad some brussels sprouts and an appetizer macaroni and cheese. The salad came out first and it was missing almost all of the ingredients that were supposed to be on it. The lettuce was wilted and it was a shameful salad. I sent it back and asked for a new one to be made. About 10 minutes later a new salad came out and it was still missing some ingredients! I asked for the missing ingredients on the side and ate the salad anyway as I was starving. In about another 10 or 15 all of the other food came out. The macaroni was hard around the edges and ice cold in the middle as were the brussels sprouts so I sent both of them back to be remade. About five minutes later the manager came to our table and told us how sorry he was and that our meal would be on the house. We were still waiting for our food to come back out at this point. It probably took another 15 to 20 minutes for the macaroni to come out and it actually tasted pretty good. I am still waiting for my brussels sprouts as I'm writing this and I'm already at my hotel LOL!! Something is very wrong with the kitchen staff in this place. The server and the manager were nice and tried to make it better.  Everything took way too long and tasted like crap so overall I would never go back and I do not recommend it
Elizabeth R.,"San Mateo, CA",1,23,33,4.0,2/21/2017,"This is as good as BJs gets. I have been to many and I like this one the best. The servers are nice, sometimes forgetful, but still nice. I've been here several times with coworkers. They always have sports on TV and usually there are seats open in the bar area. I like the bison burger, lower calories than many items on their menu and it tastes really flavorful. I love the sangria that they have in the menu, pro tip, try it blended!!"
Prezell S.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,29,40,1.0,9/27/2017,"First of all our server was sent home apparently and no one came to help any of the 5 other tables including ours. I had to call for a manager and he did not even do anything for us. Server left, management is a shit show, and we came here to celebrate 2 birthdays while on vacation. Terrible. Just terrible..."
Ryan L.,"Daly City, CA",15,1,,5.0,8/1/2017,The best chicken wings I ever tasted the salad was awesome and the pizza was good but I wouldn't say it was the best but this is still the best food I tasted in like forever!!!
Jesse C.,"San Francisco, CA",52,240,434,4.0,2/13/2017,Jam packed on Thursday at 5ish Orr so ya digggg...first time here...will plan to visit other B.J. locations...
