Susie B.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/25/2015,"BJ's service is known to be slow, so I won't complain about that. BUT inexcusable to get an iceberg wedge made with CABBAGE, and a wine glass delivered covered with lipstick. Completely unwashed. The bathroom was a mess also. And we were there early-it was not crazy busy."
Stephy L.,"Millbrae, CA",813,199,616,4.0,10/25/2009,"Friday night, i came here with my boyfriend since we were already shopping at Tanforan, and we haven't had BJs for a while. We got smarter this time, and went in to put our names down, the waiter told us it'll be around an hour or so (this is Friday night), so i guess it was expected.  SO we went back to shopping. Once we came back, they handed us the buzzer, and in about 10 mins, we were seated.  In the beginning we seemed to be INVISIBLE. No water, waiter. nothing. But after 10-15 mins or so, our waiter for the night had came to rescue us :) he was very nice, friendly, and efficient.  We asked for his recommendations on which appetizers to get and he suggested calamari and oh gosh, it was the best. We also ordered a root beer float, regular root beer, and with entree Chardonnay shrimp pasta.  We WERE SO FULL that we couldnt get desserts :( the bill was $31.  Very good service.  Great food. :)"
Stephanie J.,"Singapore, Singapore",136,280,11,2.0,6/28/2011,"Disgusting. Never, ever order take out. No curbside though they advertise it. My wedge salad came looking half eatten while my fries were cold and soggy. If I'm going to eat fatty food at least let me enjoy it while it goes down."
Larry K.,"San Francisco, CA",9,24,,4.0,4/30/2013,"Got to admit I'm a little blown away by the quantity of bad reviews here. While the service is spotty and sometimes it's a long wait to be seated because the place is often packed (how bad can it be if it is almost always packed?), their menu is HUGE, and I've never ate a bad meal. So it's not the greatest restaurant in the world, but I never found the place dirty as some have mentioned, and I've never gotten sick as others have mentioned. I must have ate here a dozen times, and will certainly return next time I head to the mall."
Chris D.,"Spokane, WA",29,166,31,4.0,10/31/2013,"Came here for happy hour at the bar and service was excellent. The food and drinks were super cheap and still really good. I liked the multiple screen tv in front of the bar so I could watch 4 things at once. At shift change the second bartender wasn't nearly as attentive, otherwise I'd have given this place 5 stars which is something I just don't do with chains restaurants."
Amy A.,"West Covina, CA",4,17,,1.0,2/27/2014,"Horrible food and service. The food always comes out cold and ugly. The service takes forever even when its not busy. Every time I come here, im always disappointed. But I have to come here cuz its the only one thats close by. They need to hire new workers asap."
Nicole P.,"San Francisco, CA",3,55,144,2.0,2/25/2015,"I don't like writIng bad reviews and I'm not a big complainer BUT! These guys suck ...the service is horrible it's worse then horrible! I haven't left a review cause I thought maybe it was a bad waitress, or a bad cook, or maybe someone was having an off day....however every time we come here our order is messed up. The most recent experience was we ordered our appetizer and my sons food so he can eat immediately. Girl seemed nice enough and took the order and brought his food ASAP. Along with appetizer. So we ordered our main meal and 20.....30....40..mins pass by and she doesn't even come around we cant get anybody attention. Finally she comes around and we ask her for our food and she looks confused.says she will be right back.....15 mins later a different waitress comes and says the original girl needed to go to break.....ummm ok where's our food?? So she asked us what we ordered so she can check on it.....comes back out immediately and says it will only be a another 10-20 mins until it's done(I'm assuming just enough time to start cooking it) so we told her never mind just give us the bill for what we have on the table....the manager came out and apologized and comped the food....we told him we didn't even want it and he was pretty insistent that we take the meals comped.....we told him we will wait another 5 mins....and we would leave....been here over an hour and still haven't even gotten the soup?? Isn't that made already??? Whatever lesson learned if I want a pazookie (the dessert is the only reason I like to go and everytime we come I can't get pass the bad service to get to dessert)guess I will have to find another bj....also the original waitress who ""went on break"" was helping all the other tables around us....so mess up then hide...that's cool....the 2 stars r for the new waitress and manager who at least attempted to fix things."
John S.,"San Bruno, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/19/2014,"Very bad service, server was definitley one of the worst ever...and it wasn't that busy we went for happy hour but i wasn't to happy  at all..."
Rossi C.,"San Francisco, CA",82,67,,1.0,5/12/2013,"Quoted us 20 minutes for table, sat us in 45, 10 minutes at our table without even eye contact or a head nod so we left.......haven't written a yelp review for two years but BJ' s was beggin for it..."
Leonardo C.,"San Jose, CA",46,50,13,5.0,12/23/2014,"it's open, it's completely wheelchair accessible, always games on, and a good crowd every time. 5 stars."
Surge C.,"San Diego, CA",305,588,1302,2.0,1/4/2011,"What do I love about BJ's? Happy hour. What do I love about THIS BJ's? *pondering*...*still pondering*....Oh yeah, that's right-NOTHING. The service is absolutely atrocious. Yep, I said that pompous line. No other way to describe the ridiculously slow, ignorant staff here. My friends and I have dealt with the same terrible 20-something waiter twice and both times he screwed up. Once on an order. The other time he forgot my friend's food.  Now we only come here and sit at the bar because we have had more than 2 bad experiences at this location. It is unfortunate that this is the nearest BJ's."
Tom C.,"Fairfax, CA",171,167,6,3.0,10/23/2011,"After a half-dozen trips here with co-workers, for lunch and drinks after work, I gotta call this an average place. Food is decent, with big portions, but not exceptional.  Prices are ok.  Ambience is busy pub, generally noisy and crowded with a mixture of shoppers and folks who work in the area.  Service is highly variable, sometimes good, sometimes awful, never great. The beer is very good, with some nice microbrews.  And the drinks are ok.  There's nothing specifically wrong with this place as a restaurant, but there is nothing really special or fun about it either.  I will go there once in a while because it's convenient, but that's the only reason."
Jercams C.,"Pacifica, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/7/2014,Long wait even on a weekday. Poor service. Food is not good at all. Never will I comeback to this place.
Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,1.0,1/27/2009,"How do I rate thee? Let me count the ways... 1. Came into the restaurant around 9:30 p.m. on a Saturday with no front desk staff to greet us. Rather there were two girls in black shirts talking and giggling and pretty much carrying on until one finally nudged the other and motioned for her to do her job. 2. Sat down in the main dining room right next to a server station. No big problem there but you'd think if you're right next to the computer terminals and condiment station, someone would notice you after 15 MINUTES???? I watched an entire 4th quarter without someone stopping by. We even put the menus to the side of the table. NOTHING. 3. A female server comes by finally: ""Are you guys ready to order?"" ""I'll have an iced tea."" ""I'll also have an iced tea."" Tick tock tick tock...8 minutes go by. ""Here's your water and here's your iced tea."" (I should have known where this meal was going by then.) Not only did this chick not get the drink order right but where's the damn sugar?? We had a California Chicken sandwich and their Cajun Pasta. Now a few words about sandwiches: It should have lettuce on it. Some sort of vegetable-something with color, nutrients-SOMETHING! All I could see and taste on it was massive loads of butter, cheese, bread. That's it. Where's the lettuce, tomato, pickles-anything?? The only thing saving that sandwich was the fries which WERE hot. Cajun pasta had a horrible sauce that reminded me of Chef Boyardee. Now you all know Chef Boyardee from when you were a kid right? I'm not paying $16 for something that's coming from a can. I send the pasta back and you know what? She didn't look surprised the food was coming back. What's worse? The manager walks by, points to our table, look at our server then nods and walks away. Wow...not even worth his time for a quick visit huh? I'm not coming back ever then. The service was horrible, the food was disgusting and the way the management ran the place was awful."
Kayla S.,"San Jose, CA",26,28,10,5.0,3/15/2012,Yummy Cheese burger pizza and pastas !!! also good desert is the PIZOOKIE :) I celebrated my daughter's birthday here a few years back they have great excellent customer service the coolest part about this place is  inside the Tanforan Mall!! I get to eat good pizza with my family then we can do shopping after :) I love this place and I dont think twice on recommending to my friends and famiy.
Jannette A.,"Hayward, CA",89,2,,1.0,8/9/2013,Came here with my bf to have a nice meal We've come here for a long time always ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and nothing ever went wrong .... we went today ordered the same thing and it was made from tomato sauce not BBQ sauce (tomato doesn't go we'll with my stomach) so I told our server i couldn't eat it because its tomato she took it back and came back with the pizza and says no it's BBQ and that she asked the chef and the cooks blah blah blah ..... i wouldn't have been mad at all I was gonna just take the pizza and take it home to my brothers but then she has the fucking nerves to come sit next to me and say that if I didn't believe it was BBQ she would try it for me and tell me it was BBQ .....because obviously i cant taste the difference seriously?? This is ridiculous I just left bad service and even worse server hope this doesn't happen to anyone else
Alie C.,"Santa Clara, CA",576,683,14,3.0,9/8/2013,"Disappointed to say that I had a less than stellar experience here. We sat in the lounge area during football, which may have been our first mistake. The service wasn't good. We had one ""server"" but had to ask for help from several other people over the course of the night. Everything we asked for took forever. My margarita had something floating in the glass so they had to make me another one, which took another 10 minutes to arrive. They obviously didn't have enough staff working or the people they did have were not capable of handling a busy area. The silver lining of this place was the bartender. His bar was full and he was obviously busy, but he still managed to be charming and funny. I wish he had been our server."
Gerline R.,"Daly City, CA",16,64,19,1.0,9/9/2014,They never fail at giving horrible customer service!  and as for the food..  that is all.
Marie T.,"Daly City, CA",26,82,58,3.0,11/1/2011,"Ahhh....the ultimate hype of the ever famous BJ's. Do people come here for the food? Or is it the environment? Or could it be the service? Or maybe it's because of their cool bar area with all the TV screens? Whatever the reason may be...this restaurant is ALWAYS PACKED! They serve good food for a decent price. Because of the constant busy-ness, the service is not always the best, but they get their jobs done. The restaurant is in the Tanforan mall, so it's prime for bringing people in. The downside is that no matter what time or day of the week, there more than likely is a wait. Though it's been a while since I've actually dined in, I know there have been a few times where my quoted time was over 40 minutes."
Lawrence G.,"San Francisco, CA",1540,20,,4.0,2/23/2015,"I had a memorable time here and I took a girl here for dinner & we both had a good time on our official date people yadig! - You know Thank Goodness I call in advance like 2-3 weeks ahead of time, so we only waited for about 15-20 minutes, since they we're super busy.
