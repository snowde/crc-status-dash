Krystal F.,"South San Francisco, CA",49,47,2,5.0,7/13/2011,"Love love love this place even tho it gets super crowded at  times which is a drag but they go around giving out samples of food as you wait.  For the most part I sit at the bar just to get a appetizers and drinks. the staff is always friendly and upbeat which makes your visit even better. I always order a Ritatini, which I highly recommend if you would like to get a great drink and a good buzz. Its not on the menu anymore but they the bartenders always make it!  Service is always fast, never had to wait a long time for food or drinks.  Appetizers are my favorite, especially the potato skins. ( I highly recommend them)  Fun atmosphere, friendly staff, and yummy food!!"
Mikaela S.,"Pomona, CA",88,20,39,2.0,10/23/2011,"The stars are for the only 3 things I like: 1) the Parmesan crusted chicken, the chilli bread bowl, and their drinks. yeah that's 3 things but they really only deserve 2 stars. Other than that, this place has the WORST SERVICE EVER. Every time I go there something goes wrong, IE: my fries are burnt, they never bring me water, they bring the wrong dish (happened twice), they FORGET to order my drink... You would think by now I'd learn never to visit again, but maybe it's something in the food that keeps me coming back for more disappointment. It's pathetic how I still go there. It's a bad relationship that I just can't get out of. But the ""what-a-peach"" is my favorite drink. Tastes just like a peachie-o."
Donna R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,61,,1.0,3/20/2014,"This is a bar, not really a restaurant.  It's really hard to mess up a burger, but they managed.  Overcooked, way too salty and not anything like what is described on the menu: no onions, no special bun, etc. etc.  I couldn't even finish it.  Way too noisy for conversation; the only reason to come here is for a DRINK."
Linda G.,"Belmont, CA",33,21,3,5.0,3/19/2014,"I have had a issue with a lost charm,But the Manager John took it upon himself to make a bad situation right! He has asked me to lunch and then walk over to the place where my charm was purchased to replace it.Grant it they need to have a better lost and found system,But I love BJ'S food  and have NEVER had a bad food experience.One of my favorites are the potato skins...best ever!!!  Great happy hour as well!!!!!!GOOOd Beer!!!"
Maggie M.,"San Francisco, CA",218,74,3,2.0,5/9/2013,"I normally love BJ's. However, my experience tonight has changed my opinion in BJ's for a while. For the first time, I ordered BJ's favorite deep dish pizza. This was supposed to come with three meats, Italian sausage, meatballs and pepperoni along with some veggies. What came out was not what I ordered. For one, the crust was soggy. Two, pizza was cold. And lastly, THERE WAS NO MEAT ON MY PIZZA. I was too engrossed with conversation with my friends to realize this so I had about 3/4 of it before I realized it had no meat. I told the server about this and he said ge probably mixed up the pizza and offered to bring me another one but since I had already eaten most of it, I felt that there was no point in getting a second one. I was already completely full. Now, I'm really not one to complain about a whole lot, but I felt that there could have been something else done to fix the situation. My friends kept telling me to ask him to comp the meal but I felt that would have been kind of shady.  Oh well."
Irma R.,"San Francisco, CA",40,409,9,4.0,8/4/2009,"Great deep dish pizzas, good pastas, apps are good, the avocado rolls, spinach dip, mozzarella sticks. The portions are huge! But it works out cause then you have left overs. For desert the pazzokie is deeeeeeeelish! that's a must when coming here.  The place gets super packed, no matter what day it is. They let you call ahead for a table, so that's nice."
Mel T.,"San Francisco, CA",180,310,818,2.0,4/7/2011,"I don't drink, so I suppose if I were coming here solely for a pizookie, BJ's could potentially be a four star establishment.  Service is alright, and I like being able to watch sports from all the TVs displayed throughout the entire restaurant, but what brings this place down is its regular food.  Meh. We ordered: - fried calamari. I expect this to be a given at restaurants.  Here, the batter and actual calamari texture were off. - fried artichoke.  The one thing, other than the pizookie, we ordered that I liked.  - beef sliders.  Soggy bun.  Yuck. - full rack of ribs.  Dry.  Super dry. - bowl of clam chowder.  Okkkk, but too salty. - chicken marsala/chicken alfredo pastas.  Not enough sauce, dry chicken, pasta not thoroughly cooked. - cookies and cream pizookie.  Warm cookie with ice cream - you can't go wrong. Obviously I was expecting too much from BJ's.  This wasn't my first time here, but it's been a long while since my last visit.  Next time I'm eating beforehand and just coming in for dessert."
Karla C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/17/2015,"I decided to give this place a try and was I disappointed.  We waited, around (45minutes to an hour)  just to be seated, after this we  had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks (coke, water, beer) and then 45 minutes for the food. If you have all this time to wait for a simple meal then this is the place for you.  Food came and there was no silverware on the table waited another 10 minutes for someone to bring us that.  The waiter was well mannered but after a while the "" I am sorry"" just gets old and seriously doesn't matter anymore. if this is how you treat your paying customer I can't imagine why your employees would even care to work there.  Will not be coming back nor will I recommend your establishment to anyone for this reason."
Steven B.,"San Francisco, CA",119,516,79,3.0,10/9/2011,"There's nothing amazing about the food, but it's alright place to have a big group party. They have quite a big selection micro brewed beer from different micro brewery ranging from local to far. There's a full bar inside of this place also so alcoholic drinks are possible. The pizza here is pretty good. It's a personal size pizza that's a deep dish pie. It's really oily, but it tastes alright."
Tanya S.,"San Francisco, CA",162,31,1,3.0,10/3/2011,"This place is ok. They have a lot of food options and some great drinks, but the food never tastes that great. Except the avacado fried roll things....those are amazing! It's good for watching sports and man dates and the only decent place to eat in Tanforan mall."
Tim C.,"San Bruno, CA",72,51,1,3.0,12/18/2013,"This place is okay, its not really a brewhouse, i don't know how they get away with saying that.  I tired buying kegs here before and the manager was pretty confused, i guess i was like the second person ever. Pizza is not bad for Chicago style.  Although everything else i've tried here was pretty mediocre, not bad, just very average.  Lots of Tv's service is a little weird here sometimes, usually have to wait, bar should be more separate in MHO, but I would be down to come here with a friend.  Prices are a little tad higher then i would like."
Lillian O.,"Costa Mesa, CA",485,51,39,4.0,9/29/2013,"Hadn't been to Tanforan for years. Met for a meeting and explored a new drink, at yet another BJ's location! Got to try the Watermelon Mojitos, tossed with mint, and fresh watermelon. Yummy! So good! Great waiters as well."
Max-Adam A.,"San Leandro, CA",578,197,52,5.0,1/6/2011,"Pretty chill here on a weekday, i dont remember if i ate here or not.   Took a friend here because we couldn't decide on what to have for dinner that night.  When we arrived, we were informed that the wait was 45 minutes.  I put my name down and we walked around the bar area to see if any tables were open and to see if customers were on the verge of being done with their dinner.. We only saw one couple ready to leave as they were finishing up their pizookie, so we stood close by and patiently waited.  While we did, I got us some beers (I ordered the Hefe and she had a Raspberry Belgium beer) and she found a high top table in the bar.   After looking over the appetizer menu, we were contemplating on getting the wings which i always get yet she never had OR to go with something lighter and that neither of us had.  We agreed on the NEW Ahi Poke which was new to the both of us.  Seemed kinda weird for me to order that at an American chain restaurant...just saying.  For Dinner, she ordered the Sliders with the wedge cut fries and i settled for a small Cheeseburger pizza. Ahi Poke: WOW! What a suprise, this was definetely on point!  I can compare this Ahi Poke with a lot of asian restaurants and this can run with a lot of them.  You get that nice chunk diced cut of fresh tuna, the saltiness from the soy sauce and that refreshing taste from the sesame oil.  The ""lettuce"" slaw was a nice addition to it and had a nice little peppery taste to it.  The fried won-tons complimented the Ahi Poke extremely well.  Kinda felt like I was eating Ahi Poke Nachos (minus the cheese)...hmmmm Sliders: This is what she ordered.  She only ate one of the four sliders that were on her plate as she quickly became full.  Maybe the dranks killed her appetite? LOL  I picked off her plate and took a small wedge fry.  It was nice, crisy outside and tender on the inside, seasoned very well.  Cheeseburger pizza: Never a disappointment!  She seemed to be amazed by it as well as she was eating a slice of pizza that I put on her plate. Kindly took the diced pickles off her slice as she's not a fan of them.  mmmm thank God I ordered a small, HI-5 for leftover pizza!   Service: 5 stars.  Our server Mike was very kind and attentive to us. Was on point with his waiter attributes and always asked if everything looked and tasted good.  This had to be the first time a waiter/watiress asked if the food LOOKED good.  Interesting saying... Definetely will come back here, regardless of the 25 minute drive..food & drinks are superb, service is excellent!"
Lily S.,"San Francisco, CA",91,76,49,1.0,9/29/2014,"it has been a good while since we last visited BJ's but hey the BF and I thought we should give this place another chance. So we get there around 7pm and was told that there would be a 25 min wait, which was great since it wasn't an hour. So our buzzer finally rings and we get seated. Service was a little slow from the get go but it's okay since we weren't starving or anything. We start off with a pepsi and a jerryburst (1/2 jeremiah red and 1/2 berry burst cider which i had to explain to the server) then we order a calamari and a large pizza to share (half great white and half buffalo chicken. Asked the server to not put any mushrooms on the pizza and to add garlic. Got the calamari and it was cold and spongy not like it should be which is light and crispy ate it anyways. The Pizza finally arrives 40 mins later and guess what .. my side was covered in mushrooms. Flagged down the server and told her i asked for no mushrooms and she said yup i told them no mushrooms and i told her well why is it covered in mushrooms then.. she said she apologizes and that it was the kitchens fault and not hers so she takes the pizza back. She comes back with the same pizza and tells us that go ahead and keep this pizza and she asked the kitchen to make a personal pizza with no mushrooms of the great white. That's fine and all but as soon as the bf started to eat the pizza i noticed it was doughy so i asked him if it was cooked through, he told me to try it and i did and it wasn't cooked all the way. The pizza was hard to rip and the bottom was doughy and undercooked not crunchy at all, so we had to send it back. Management comes by and apologizes and tells us that he has a new one in the oven, i told him to cancel it and that i would just like the bill for the calamari and 2 drinks but management was nice and told us to not to worry about it and told us that when we were finished we could leave at anytime and to visit them again in the future. So 1 star for that! I don't know how soon we would return, but we probably will come again to see if they got better"
Emily V.,"South San Francisco, CA",150,25,18,1.0,9/18/2010,"This review is specifically for the server named Billy. I hope you enjoyed Table 601's note, and we hope you get fired."
Anio D.,"San Francisco, CA",74,69,2,3.0,1/15/2012,"I don't frequent these kind of places much, but I agreed to go last time to see a friend I haven't seen in a while. It was a Friday night, of course the place was full. I was given a pager for an hour's wait-- love that it's right across from Barnes & Noble so I had a place to kill some time.  Anyway. When my party of 3 was complete upon arrival, we walked around to see if there were bar seats. For a while, we waited and waited. Finally 3 stools opened up, so we cancelled our pager and just ate there. Food was good, and very filling..although I wasn't that hungry. I still ate 3 slices of the deep pan pizza. Service was okay, actually, pretty good for a place that busy.  It was a good experience, but personally, I hate crowded places just so I can eat. It's ideal, though, having 2 loud kids and not having to bother louder adults. But that still doesn't convince me to come in regularly."
Marie G.,"San Jose, CA",152,130,151,3.0,7/24/2009,"My friend and I came here (my first time) and he told me about the chicago style pizzas. We came here for lunch and pizza and beer which sounded pretty good to my stomach. It was around 2pm we came here and it was low key and not so busy seeing that it was a brewery and kinda like a pub. We sat at the bar in front of the 4 screens of soccer, ESPN, more soccer, and skateboarding. We ordered the Southwestern which was a new item on the pizza menu and beer. The bartender had to talk to his manager because my ID was outta state (OR). It was  inconvenient but it's protocol for them. Whatever.  The pizza was alright.. i think that's cuz i forgot to ask for tobasco sauce. haha whoops. But it was tasty and satisfied my palate. I was a little disappointed with the taste since my friend told me it was the best, minus a star. The amber helped me fill my tummy and get a little rosy in the face. I do like the fact that you can walk around in the mall after filling up the stomach. :D Minus a star since I don't come here enough so I gave it an Okay rating."
Aprams C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,15,,1.0,3/3/2015,"Worst service in the World, 100% AMATEUR, BJ staff told us to be on time for 5:00 reservations and we didn't get seated until 5:45.  I had to tell the mgr.  ""how does it take to seat 9 people?  we have been waiting since 4:55 pm.""  Mgr was watching all the monitors.  Half the staff was off and the new staff was coming on.  Our first waiter handed us off to a new waiteress.  No table ware, no plates. and one appetizer with 6 bread slices for a table of 9.  No water.  One waitress abandoned to take care of 9 and she was a NEWBIE.  Quality Inn Receptionist had equally bad service for his father's birthday party.  He couldn't run a tab because the San Bruno Bartender (NEWBIE) didn't know how!!!  Dinner was late & atrocious."
Jasnoor S.,"Brentwood, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/6/2016,"If I could leave zero stars I would. Our server was extremely rude. First, she told us that she would be right back to take our order and didn't come back until 20 minutes later to take the order. Not to mention, it took an additional 30 minutes for the food to come to us and when it did it was undercooked. The rice in my meal was basically raw. The server never once came back to ask for refills and only refilled after we asked for it. Then when we ordered our dessert but then realized we wanted to change it she told us she had already put the order in and couldn't change. She then comes back another 10 minutes later asking what we wanted instead because she canceled the order. I don't understand why she didn't do that in the first place when we asked her in the first place 10 minutes ago instead of waiting so long to cancel it. Not to mention the entire time we were there, she had an attitude and even brought us the bill before asking if we wanted any dessert. I've been to this location multiple times and recent decent service but this was unacceptable."
Olivia V.,"San Francisco, CA",293,118,810,4.0,7/5/2009,"I love BJ's...it beats the Elephant Bar at Serramonte hands down. But it's a bit of a drive from the city so I don't always find myself here. Boo. Yeah, it does get crowded and you are likely to have to wait for a table, but if you come around 5ish and avoid the dinner rush, the wait is nonexistent. They do handle large groups well though, and it's a nice place to have a party of 10+ people. They'll accommodate. I like their sliders, and they'll cook it to your specifications topped off with a side of yummy wedge-cut fries! They're fried to a crispy golden brown, yay. You wouldn't think that a place like BJ's makes hella good pizza, but they do. My ex boyfriend is a huge fan of the cheeseburger pizza, and it tasted like a cheeseburger...in pizza form. Um, what else? Awesome bartenders. They never get my ""Shirley Temple with a splash of pineapple juice"" wrong, and it's always consistent.  The food is typical for this type of restaurant: pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, salads/soups, pizza. But the servers are always efficient and on top of things by asking if you want refills and if everything is going well. There are flat screens all around the restaurant and huge ones above the bar, making it an ideal place to watch the NBA finals! There's an outside patio that I've been wanting to sit at for a while now...I'll just wait for the perfect summer evening. Ohhh, and the infamous Pizookie, 'nuff said. :)"
