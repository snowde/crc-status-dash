Ladi Da A.,"San Francisco, CA",661,494,194,1.0,9/2/2012,"F*ck! STOP! DON'T EAT HERE!!! I hadn't been here in a while due to terrible service and ridiculously long wait times. It's been over a year. So, maybe things have changed?  I decided to try the online pickup order. Pickup time...11:30am. Okay, so I call in at 11:00am to confirm my order's pickup time. Confirmed. Head over there. Arrive for pickup at around 11:35am. At 11:45am the guy working the pickup line is still on the first two customers he was helping when I walked through the door. The guy is obviously super flustered and cannot handle more than one thing at a time. I was there for 20 minutes, without ever being acknowledged! By 11:55am, I have sought out help from three other employees (host, waitstaff, etc.), because if my food is ready...then it's getting f*ckin' cold! Finally, at around noon, they gather my three item order. Yes, a mere three simple meals. Yet, they completely forget the soup on one order. I didn't even bother to call after I noticed it missing, because I could not deal with any more frustration for the day. One of three items was a pizza, which was super wet and soggy at the bottom! Totally gross! What'd they do? Mop the floor with it? I spent over 30-minutes waiting for an 11:30am pickup order. If I had this much time to kill, I would have eaten at the restaurant!!! I nearly missed a meeting, waiting on this stupid order! I love BJ's, but I totally hate this location. The management and staff are completely unorganized and the staff do not know how to work under pressure. Yes, the kid working the pickup/express line was totally green, but if he sucked, it was obvious that he had no training and they do not have a system in place to organize their food orders. The kid working the express line needs training. He also needs backup! There were three hosts just standing around doing nothing, while this kid was freaking out running back and forth from the front to the back, and frazzled trying to take phone orders (difficulty multi-tasking). The hosts were just standing around with their thumbs in their ass. Two hosts are more than enough--there were 3 or 4!!! Put someone else at the busy pickup/express station! The cooks/chefs aren't getting orders out on time! Who the hell is making sure that food is being expedited out of the kitchen? The manager(s) were probably shopping at the mall, because no ONE was managing SH*T! People need training and the higher up(s) should get fired or go back to waiting tables, because things here are run chaotically and unprofessionally!!! If you like BJ's it's worth the trip down to their San Mateo location. The location in San Bruno at Tanforan completely sucks @ss."
K M.,"San Francisco, CA",571,439,235,1.0,11/21/2012,"You get what you'd expect at BJ's. If you're stuck in San Bruno, this is unfortunately one of the only places to grab food & beer. I think they hire people without any waiting experience, which would explain why their waitstaff is aloof and confused. The host ignored us. The table we were seated at had food and what appeared to be love stains all over the seats. I had to ask for cloth napkins to lay down because it was slightly terrifying. Our waitress was completely absent. Not once, but TWICE we placed drink orders from the General Manager (who was great, actually) because she was no where to be found. Everything is really overpriced for the quality of the food (which is poor).  I don't even know why I'm writing this review. Duh, BJ's sucks. Hop on Bart and grab something fresh & local in SF if ya can."
Sunie K.,"Oakland, CA",150,45,1,1.0,12/28/2010,"Ok, I know I reviewed this before and it was a one star, but I have to update this because it seems to be going down hill. First, we sat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Several minutes pass, and the bartender didn't even say hi once. And no, he was not busy. In fact he was so not busy that he managed to make the people's next to us drinks and chat with his coworker (probably comparing goatees). So, we moved to the dining area. Big mistake, we should have just left.  NO ONE greeted us for 10 minutes, Not even a ""hi."" Luckily, Carlos, someone that we've met before was working and took our order even though he was supposed to be off. If it were not Carlos, we probably would have just walked out. I ordered fish and chips and my boyfriend ordered pork chops with extra mashed potatoes and clam chowder. We also had cheese sticks to start off. The clam chowder came out barely warm. Whatever, mood is sour, but I'm ok. Entrees came out and his mashed potatoes were COLD. Like just came out of the fridge cold. I've had enough after that. I told a manager and he was nice and comped our entrees. I NEVER complain about anything when eating out. This place is just awful. I don't care about the comp food I'll probably give it to someone homeless or maybe a dog since they have low standards for food. I would rather pay money for good service and even better food."
Carrie G.,"San Gabriel, CA",47,170,4,3.0,5/19/2011,"Had dinner here last night. I am used to the whiteness of Marin, and I always forget the abundance of Filipinos everywhere. So this was a welcome surprise. We got in around 745 an the wait for a table was about 40 minutes. I was about to get a beer at the bar and lo and behold 2 guys leaving as I am approaching the barkeep. It was great timing.  So he cleaned the area, but it smelled like gross bar towels, so I had to fare with that all dinner. Love that they have multiple games on the telly, except with my easily distracted brain, I had trouble focusing. The people watching here was good, the guys next to me I think was on a date and the girl did not wanna watch a movie with him, poor thing. I digress. Our food came out almost instantly, which is expected in a chain where they just nuke the food, but it was still pretty good.  The service was alright, if only the hot bartender paid us more attention Might have given this place an extra star. Alas our pizookie arrived and all the shortcomings left my mind. I would return again, if only to watch eye candy and eat a pizookie."
Bill L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2,251,,3.0,1/30/2015,afternoon snack.   calamari:  crispy outside (very good) - inside the squid was dry and tough buffalo chicken pizza - good good good bison burger - not bad
Jun R.,"Sacramento, CA",6,134,93,2.0,11/25/2013,"Service painfully slow, server not engaged and not particularly friendly. Too bad. This place used to be a pretty reliable late night dive with good food and service."
Amelia M.,"San Francisco, CA",50,349,38,2.0,11/15/2010,"Service? Doesn't really exist here. It has consistently bad service. I don't know if they hire a bunch of pot smokers or what, but I swear we always get the most ""duh!"" type servers.  The food is ok.... it is really nothing out of the ordinary. Your standard chain grub. Can't expect much, so I suppose it is safe to say that you shouldn't expect stellar service, perhaps they are short staffed, who knows.  You can always go to another chain down the road (Chilli's) that will most likely be faster to get seated at."
Razel M.,"Seattle, WA",149,256,44,3.0,2/19/2011,"I have been at this particular BJ's numerous times for various reasons. One consistent thing: service sucks here. I mean, really sucks. They either need to hire more staff, or they need to hire better staff. I have ended up sitting at the bar area more often than not, and still get pretty slow service. Why am I still giving three stars? Well, it is open late, in an area where a lot of spots close early. Particularly good that it is open late on Sundays -- yes, world, there are people who need food and a shot even on Sunday nights. Particularly so close to the airport, where Sunday is usually one of the busiest, most stressful days. Second reason is, the food is still pretty good, and they have such a large variety that you will definitely find something whatever you're in the mood for. And of course there are pizookies to enjoy, if everything else fails."
Hannah C.,"Castro Valley, CA",170,217,3,3.0,9/1/2011,"Unlimited soup and salad is a great deal for $6.95 for weekday lunch, but the food quality was meh. You get a choice of house or caesar salad and any of their soups (clam chowder, broccoli cheese, minestrone, chili). I went with their chili and a house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. All their soups are SO SALTY! A little less salty, and I would be down to go back here and there for this lunch special, but the excessive sodium intake was too much. The minestrone I got afterward was less salty, but still too salty for me to enjoy the broth. I just fished out the veggies. I might be back sometime to try another of their lunch specials, but BJ's soups are definitely not for me."
Paul G.,"Daly City, CA",132,107,50,1.0,8/28/2013,Drinks were? Till they mess the drinks up! We ordered a meat pizza that didn't have any meat.... Complain right away... don't let it lapse... the managers are lazy! We were never compensated... sad because I had high hope for this place...
Steve T.,"San Francisco, CA",123,79,7,4.0,10/10/2011,"Great Atmosphere. Good Food. Staff is adequate and attentive AT TIMES. TV's everywhere, great place to catch a sports game and have some beer. I come here all the time, mainly because my gf loves this place."
Kellie A.,"Las Vegas, NV",205,262,108,4.0,7/15/2011,"visit: 7/7/11 9pm I'm already a fan of Bj's in Vegas, this one is no surprise,still awesome. Had the tasters of 8 beers -berry burst, its already my fav. Got fish and chips which was delicious and hubby got fish tacos, which I tried, also delicious. He got the seasonal beer nitwit, which was ordinary,we both agreed. The hefewiezen was similar, but tastier. On a thursday night at about 9 this place was really busy. Too full for desert...from beer...only ate half my food!"
Hema K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",344,928,281,2.0,4/20/2011,Not the place for brunch for sure.  Preferably should stick with happy hour or weekday lunch specials.  Saturday brunch at BJ's while waiting for my car to be serviced at the nearby dealer.  Food and service sucks.  Ordered the classic sandwich.  Potatoes were not fresh and looked more like re-heated rather than prepared on the same day.
Sidz S.,"San Francisco, CA",3,8,,5.0,10/27/2013,"I've been going here over the years and I can say I have taken a liking to the place. I love that the menu has so many options compared to other places I've been to, I can always find something I can eat (veggie/pescatarian food). The very first time I went here I had fish tacos and a very very nice server! Too bad haven't seen her since. I usually get the fettuchini Alfredo and its always consistent. I like it here better than other places. And the strawberry daiquiri is bomb too. My usual order consists of those two plus a side of thick wedge cut fries! Yum! And they have lunch specials. Now I'm really craving some! There are also many TVs so when it's baseball season you know I'm there!"
Valerie N.,"San Francisco, CA",8,37,4,1.0,1/13/2014,"Do not want to get into the specifics but if you have a card and your friends are paying cash, check your account. Asides from that food was cold and service was not up to par."
Rylan C.,"San Francisco, CA",671,538,25,3.0,6/1/2011,"This place is ok. The pizookie is good and the refillable cream sodas are great but the rest of the food is just like all the other big-box chain restaurants.....unimaginative and mass-produced. However, I will point out that the service was great and my colleagues and I were pleasantly surprised with the dining experience. The food was ok and the service was good. I'll probably come here again just because the food is consistent. However, probably only for lunch. I'd prefer to go somewhere less crowded for dinner."
Emilia G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,82,,4.0,2/7/2015,"My third time here in the past 5 years.  No complaints.  The service has always been in the top 95%.  Food quality - pretty good!  Perhaps not like a San Francisco fine restaurant but for a chain, not bad at all and much better than others."
Erica A.,"Austin, TX",542,278,58,1.0,9/16/2010,"I really don't like this particular BJs. The food is the same as other ones, so this review is strictly for the service. Our waiter was a tall skinny man. He was friendly at first, I thought everything would be fine. He let us ponder our menus for TWENTY MINUTES. Two people do NOT need twenty minutes to decide what we want to eat. Oh by the way, I WAS STARVING. Thanks, jackass. There were two women at sitting behind us who had just arrived and he was treating them so much better than us. He finally came to take our orders and I asked for water. Did I get my water before all the food? NOPE. So he walks by, and I ask again. He apologizes and goes to the table behind us. He seriously gave them an entire tutorial on how to make their iPhones run faster because the new update made them slow. That took about 10 minutes. I wanted to get up and punch him in the face because NOBODY wanted to hear that. The women didn't even seem interested. They just wanted their food, not your damn advice. So along with being forgetful, he was ANNOYING AS HELL. I saw him the second time I went to this location and I was glad that I was just getting something to go. The second time, I was only getting the ahi poke appetizer because I was starving. So imagine how easy that is, okay? RAW FISH, CHOPPED UP AND MIXED WITH SOME AVOCADO CHUNKS. Well, there were some wonton chips on the side. 25 minutes later, I finally get my food. WHAT THE HELL? I SAT THERE FOR 25 MINUTES FOR RAW FISH. I would understand if you had to cook it, and it went wrong 3 times. BUT ITS RAW FISH. WAS IT KILLED UPON ORDER? On top of the long ridiculous wait, ALL the waiters seemed to just be chillin' at the front of the restaurant. Two of them were even cupcaking and grabbing one another's butt. WHAT THE HELL?"
Billy C.,"San Francisco, CA",173,81,38,3.0,10/14/2013,The wait time is painful.  Their brew selection has improved from their own home brews to outside selections. Food is good and such large portions...pace yourselves.
Christopher J.,"Glendale, CA",207,253,299,3.0,4/11/2011,"Well, I have to say that they make some pretty good Beer here. Good drinks, good friends, a great place to sit and relax and enjoy the night. The food is actually pretty good, depending on what you order. Not everything is good on the menu. But normally when I come in here, I order something to munch on, but mostly I'm drinking their beers with my friends and having a good time, I forget what I'm eating.. lol It's going to be loud in this place, so be prepared. It's vary spacious, lots of room to walk around and stuff. The service is pretty solid. The parking is at Tanforan Shopping Center so there is no issues with that. This place goes well in this mall since the mall looks outstanding now. I remember back in the days when it was all run down and nobody would shop here. Now it's so lively and crowded :)   PROS:: 1] GOOD beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer 2] Prices are average 3] Very spacious and you can be rowdy with your friends, its ok! 4] Tons of parking at Tanforan CONS:: 1] Not everything is good on the menu, what do you expect for American type food 2] Sometimes service is a bit slow, but depending on the night"
