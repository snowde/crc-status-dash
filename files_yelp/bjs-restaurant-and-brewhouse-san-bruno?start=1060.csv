Nina P.,"San Francisco, CA",33,4,,1.0,2/5/2014,"Me and my boyfriend came here last night to celebrate our anniversary. When we walked in we saw it was packed so we went to the hostess and asked if she had a table for two. She said she can sit us immediately so we got seated and waited for a waiter or waitress to address us. After 30 mins no one came to our table so we left and went to Red Robins instead. The most annoying part was the other tables around us got their food and the servers saw us but just kept on walking. Talk about crapoy customer service, im going to think twice before coming here ever again."
Fatima Rose I.,"South San Francisco, CA",148,3,19,1.0,1/5/2015,we used to eat here soo many times and never had a problem and yet this place doesn't even deserve 1 STAR. we reserved for 9 people at 8 pm. the lady said yes. we arrived at 7:55 pm said we had to wait another 20-30 mins. came back at 8:30-ish and our seats STILL WEREN'T READY. and now it's almost 9 pm and we still aren't seated. BULLSHXT.
Monlia W.,"San Francisco, CA",273,40,10,1.0,1/24/2011,"Now I have definitely had my fair share of BJ's visits across Northern California, but this one by far is the WORST BJ's that I have ever been to!!  The atmosphere is no different from any other BJ's but the customer service is crappy to say the least.  While we were questioning our not-so-fresh ahi poke appetizer, the waitress came over and asked for our assistance. She came and asked our table if we could help translate for some other patrons and assist in their order. My table chose me to assist and I did. I translated the WHOLE menu to them, both regular and the kiddie menu and they ordered a good amount of food. (Dessert too!) Not that I expected any sort of complimentary food or discount for my assistance, but the fact that they didnt even offer was sort of reflective of how lacking they were in customer service. C'mon now, its just business ettiquette if someone goes out of their way for ya!  Getting back to my friends, they had messed up our orders (which is something I have almost no patience for). We had ordered a Cajun pasta with angel hair (that we specifically requested), but they brought us fettucini instead. My order was the Thai Salmon dish, but there was nothing Thai about it...and the Salmon, like the Ahi, was questionable. The dish was served on a bed of white rice, which was undercooked; I would know, I'm chinese!  My friend's country fried steak had a consistency of eraser shavings, wrapped in soggy breadding. It almost reminded me of a wet enchilada. No bueno. Overall, I would say that by this visit alone, I would never go back to a BJ's if it werent for their pazookies."
Chintan P.,"San Francisco, CA",28,15,,5.0,11/10/2013,Best deep dish pizzas + awesome pizookies
Lisa H.,"San Francisco, CA",97,37,11,4.0,7/27/2010,"SIt at the bar! There's no wait at all! Lunch specials are like $7 and you get a TON of food. It was tasty and filling!  Plus their pizooki's are so fricking delicous, even if I'm super full i'll make room for one of these! YUMMY!"
Caryn B.,"Campbell, CA",23,153,6,2.0,5/20/2013,Bland white people food. Overpriced entrees. Stupidly large menu. Need I say more?
Mark E.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,2,4.0,4/20/2012,"I live in South San Francisco and although it is always tough to get a table within an hour on a Saturday night, this restaurant does a great job when the ""lights"" aren't on. If you go for lunch service, you will get in and out with some great deals too. A good add to the area all around"
Amanda S.,"San Francisco, CA",91,47,7,1.0,8/17/2011,"First time here, and I would NEVER go back to this location!! I went with a group of friends at around 11:30pm one night to grab a bite to eat. I was expecting the same kind of service at any other BJ's I've been to. We were assigned two waitresses--one was a total newbie and the other gave us a dirty look toward us at the end when we wanted to split our checks. Got the vibe that she was racist or something. RUDE. And they didn't even refill our waters at ALL. The new waitress got my boyfriend's order wrong--he ordered Maui Glazed Pork Chops but instead got regular Pork Chops. They redid the order but basically took one pork chop out, glazed the top with sweet and sour sauce, kept the asparagus, and threw in some potatoes that were COLD. Everyone else's dishes were cooked to perfection but I was very disappointed. Thank goodness the waitress got my order of the pizookie right, otherwise I would have raised hell!"
Ivan F.,"San Francisco, CA",38,98,6,3.0,3/25/2011,"Aaaaahhhhhh B.J.'s. The spot to go for San Bruno's suburbanites. They're version of a Cheers on steroids, but not.  As soon you walk in, you notice that the majority of the folks in here were either at the mall, attend SF State, or live out in glorious San Bruno.  Huge dining area and a long bar on the right as you enter. This place is aite. Your typical fare on a huge menu of various selections ranging from pizza and/or pasta to fish and chips and all that jazz. They've got a really good beer-on-tap selection (which is what they're known for...I assume) and, wait for it, PAZOOOKIES!!! What's a pazoookie you ask? Wow! You must not be living your life because pazookies are...bigass cookie pizzas. Um, ya. Stoners heaven. Decent place to go as a default joint. Especially if you got relatives from the Philippines and you want to impress them with what America is all about...excess. This is the place to go!  Unless of course Cheesecake Factory is closer."
Emily S.,"Stockton, CA",286,904,829,2.0,6/18/2008,"We ate here a few months ago.  It was just okay.  Really.   We were picking my parents up at SFO and they were delayed at customs.  That never seems to surprise me.  I rushed to the airport.... pretty much flew my husband's truck over the San Mateo Bridge.... BTW, I hate that bridge.  Nice view.  But why does it seem to get longer and longer every time?  And where do you 'break down'?  Especially with maniacs like me on the road flying at 90 mph.   Oh... I'm yelping.  Sorry.  The A.D.D. is in full force this evening.  I was just boiling eggs, feeding the dog (not eggs) and playing online black jack and now find myself trying to focus on this fucking yelp. The service was mediocre.  The food was just okay.  Our table was filthy and getting the check from our waiter was like trying to pry the shotgun from Charlton Heston's cold dead hands, God Bless that man... Charlton, not the waiter.  I asked for the check 2 times.  Shouldn't happen.  I shouldn't have to beg to give you money, asswipe.   BTW, yelp headquarters, if you read my reviews, I love the improvements.  The star 'roll over' thing, the 'write an update'.  I fucking love you people."
Daniel B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,7,,5.0,2/25/2014,"This place has one of the best selections of drinks and food around. It can be pretty busy around 7 pm but it's worth it. Great atmosphere, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. My favorite place to hang out on the weekend."
Steven S.,"Daly City, CA",526,87,7,3.0,6/30/2013,"BJs is basically another elephant bar except they have way more beer on tap.  I've had one really bad experience a couple years back which I still remember til this very day.  I order some kind of spaghetti which didn't even taste like spaghetti.  It tasted like cardboard with red sauce.  It was so terrible that I didn't even eat the majority of it even though I was really hungry.  I gave it three stars because if you avoid ALL of the itailan food, the place isn't that bad.  The pizza, salad, nachos are all good selections which I recommend.  Try getting their beer sampler if your food doesn't taste that good.  Everything tastes better when you're drinking!"
Y r.,"Daly City, CA",8,67,17,3.0,7/1/2011,"If your spending your day shopping and need to grab a bite or go see the niners whoop on the suckas from the other side of the bay here you go. The place is always pack so call ahead they don't take reservations but will put you down on the list like your there waiting. these has come in handy a few times.  The menu has the regular staple of burgers, pastas, and pizzas so you cant really go wrong with one of their deep dish pizzas.  The bar is always pack so plan to hoover around people till they finish to grab that booth."
Sharon V.,"Oakland, CA",202,47,12,4.0,8/12/2010,"If you go to BJ's without ordering the Avocado Egg Rolls, you are an ignorant fool. The end."
Joseph A.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,28,9,1.0,8/23/2010,"We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and we would have had a better time at the donut shop down the street. Lets start off with the waiter, he was hardly around. I had to lift my hands and hope  that ANY waiter came around. Forgot our bread, etc... The BBQ chick chopped salad was dry with no dressing and the pizza my friends ordered had little, if any tomato sauce. Waste of money. Stay away."
Simon W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,97,,1.0,9/10/2013,"A pretty awful experience. Ordered an appetizer and two main courses. The main courses of Moroccan fish came pretty quickly but looked like they'd been slapped on the plate and the food was barely warm. The appetizer arrived a few minutes after the main course. The server apologized and was sending the manager over but they never came. Ended the night asking them to call a cab and after 15 minutes they said it was here but it was another customer picking up takeout. 40 minutes later we get our own. Awful service, sub standard food compared to the other BJ  locations I've visited. If I could rate it with zero stars I would."
Jerry P.,"Daly City, CA",4,16,2,5.0,2/18/2014,"Since I fairly watch my diet, everytime I step into a restaurant the first thing I check is their salad then appetizers.  I just love their seared ahi tuna salad, soup and strawberry lemonade.  Plus, my 20-month-old daughter is always in a good mood throughout our meal.  We feed her with the kiddie meal while she enjoys her coloring book.  Will definitely come back....."
Diana P.,"Fremont, CA",361,159,301,3.0,6/15/2011,"I'm always at this BJ's. It's sort of the default if you're in the SSF or San Bruno area, plus, it's open late! There is ALWAYS a wait, but what's cool about this BJ's is during some nights, they walk around and give out free samples of pizza to those who are waiting!  The bar area is always pretty busy, but the turn around time is pretty good, so you can usually swoop a booth or hi-top table in this area.  I usually order the same stuff: berry burst cider, ahi poke appetizer, flat bread pizza, pizookie. TOO GOOD, I always want to order other things, but I can't seem to stray away from that pattern.  Other things I've tried here that have been good: California Club with shoestring fries, chicken Alfredo pasta with broccoli,  Best Beginnings Appetizer sampler..I really can't complain about the food - it's really good, at any of the other BJ's I've been to as well (Newark, Cupertino).. I haven't had the BEST experience with servers.. some of the servers I've had have been REALLY bad, I've never complained because I love the food at BJs so much, but some of them straight up forget about you or you're sitting in the area for hella long waiting for someone to take your order that you end up flagging down a different server. Some servers though have been OK, but as far as service goes, in letter grade, I'd give it a C+, and I'm a nice person, so that's giving them the benefit of the doubt that they just don't know how to multi-task or have poor situational awareness or need to be re-trained. I've ordered take out from here, I'd actually suggest that at this BJs. Super quick, never messed up my order, and no wait! Oh, and last night when I ate dinner here with my boyfriend and some friends - they ran out of my favorite, Berry Burst Cider. SO SAD. If you ever come here though, make sure to try it, it's DELICIOUS!"
Johnson Y.,"Hayward, CA",44,15,2,2.0,1/15/2014,"They get 2 stars only because the manager or supervisor did accommodate us when we complained the poor service.  I come here a lot, often with friends to watch sports.  That's when Buffalo Wild Wings is jammed pack.  But Bj's service is horrible.  I remember calling in just to reduce my wait time upon arrival and the rep stated that it would only be a 20 minute wait.  I ended up waiting an hour and 10 minutes.  Not only that, I asked the rep why I was told to wait only 20 minutes and she couldn't even explain.  All I wanted was a simple explanation and I was going to move on since my table was ready.  But then another girl, the so-called coordinator, butts in, gives me a bad attitude while explaining to me why the wait.  She had no idea I had called in ahead of time.  And to make matters worse, I was not even being rude or unreasonable to the rep.  How disappointing."
