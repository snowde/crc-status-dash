Albert W.,"San Francisco, CA",84,102,8,4.0,7/22/2011,"Good beer, decent food. 4 stars. Got the Jambalaya which was pretty good, but not the best. Prepare to wait on weekends if you want to eat here. Its that many people."
Abby E.,"San Francisco, CA",135,50,5,1.0,10/4/2013,"Bad service. We got there at 11am on a Friday. Note that the place was still empty except for two tables already seated.  By 12:15, we were still waiting for our soup, salad and fish tacos. The place was already packed with corporate lunch goers from nearby offices and most of them were eating already!! What's wrong with this picture? When I spoke with the server, he just came up with a bunch a bs excuses.. We even had to ask him for more water. Barely saw him an never checked up on us. When we asked to speak with the manager, he also took while to come over to talk to us. He listened and just apologized-- unconvincingly reassuring us he'll find out what's going on. Don't ever go to this one.  What a waste of money. Felt like we could have had a better lunch experience at the Five Guys food court nearby."
Victoria Y.,"San Jose, CA",239,679,,3.0,4/19/2011,"12:00pm, no wait. However, very busy and I didn't like that we sat in the back but whatever. Lunch is pretty reasonable, and I like the lunch special for the pasta where you can add a salad. I love their wedge salads. The 3 stars were because the waiter brought out the salad and pasta at the same time. And the only time we saw him was in the beginning."
Andrea B.,"San Mateo, CA",953,830,1271,3.0,3/20/2011,"I have eaten at few BJ's in the past and have never really cared for their food, however my friend wanted to eat here for her birthday, so how could I say no.  I ordered Chardonnay Shrimp PastaPlump shrimp, sautéed with garlic, basil, onions, fire-roasted red peppers, Roma and sun-dried tomatoes over rotelle noodles in a creamy Chardonnay wine sauce, topped with crisp Applewood smoked bacon, fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley.  AMAZING, it was so good!  I was impressed!"
Stephanie F.,"Millbrae, CA",226,25,8,3.0,6/2/2011,"Above all, BJ's sure is convenient.  For my friend's birthday today we couldn't decide on a place to go for a ""Surprise party"" luncheon, so when all else fails, you head to the mall. We had a very awkwardly large party of 15, and even though we didn't have a reservation, our waiter was great in accommodating our whole party and got us all to fit in one table. I usually like the Pot Roast here, but now they serve some lighter options under 500 calories, so I was suckered into their Tilapia and substituted the rice for a garden salad. Can't expect much from baked tilapia so it was pretty bland, and I ended up having a slice of pizza from the girl next to me.  Oh and who can forget the pizookie. Ice cream on top of a giant cookie, yummy, but way hyped."
Karina A.,"San Francisco, CA",21,206,37,3.0,5/31/2013,Decent happy hour drinks and snacks. But sometimes the drinks do taste a little watered down. I always asked for light ice!
Kaylee D.,"Daly City, CA",0,11,2,2.0,11/11/2013,"The food was good so no complaints there, but the service on the other hand needs improvement. We were lead to our seats by a rather unfriendly hostess who handed us our menus and left. We ordered two dishes and an appetizer from our server who seemed nice enough, but as we discovered later, had a habit of disappearing. Our food came quickly, but our order was messed up- when the right dish came it was only slightly warm. We spent half of our meal without drinks and when we asked our waiter for an extra ranch it never arrived. If we do go back, we will be sure to get a better and more attentive server."
Anita P.,"San Mateo, CA",2,28,,1.0,8/16/2013,"Horrible.  Dirty cups and utensils, even after requesting replacements.  Serving tacos with liquid avocado in California is stupid and cheap.  Second and last time that I will ever go there."
jason g.,"San Francisco, CA",862,711,104,2.0,4/29/2010,"This is for Happy Hour only. Bj's..............Happy hour!!!!  How can you go wrong right?!?  Please don't read between the lines.  I am really talking about bj's happy hour. Came here with a few of my friends last night and this place is a cool sports bar.  Bunch of big screens and the energy here is pretty cool. As for the server and the staff, they need help.  Franchise type establishments are known for not having good quality staff.  They don't seem happy working here.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks and when asked where the drinks? The server would just point and say "" it's coming"" and walks away.  No apologies, bad body language, and you know she wasn't having it today. The funny thing is.........every single one of the servers looked alike and had the same demeanor.  They don't smile, looked disgruntled, and looked overworked. So, we had 2 drinks and left for Intramuros!!!"
Mertani G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,287,,3.0,8/17/2012,"I'll come here just for the red velvet pizookie! Sooo many calories, but i don't care! I'll eat it on my ""cheat day."" If you're ordering off of the enlightened entrees, don't eat the mediterranean pasta. It was so bland! yuck!"
Eugenia X.,"San Francisco, CA",47,7,8,3.0,8/9/2012,"Came here because of the pizookies and the lunch deals they have from 11-3pm  Got here a little too late for that but definitely will come back next to try it.  We got seated right away, our waiter came right after I think his name was David. We order fried calamari, stuff mushrooms, mini great white deep dish pizza, the thai mango salad, and one of the mocktails i think it was a peachberry.  The food came kind of slow.. our appetizer (fried calamari) didn't come out first, came after everything was served. The mocktail was decorated with a salted rim like how a cocktail would. When I looked at it 3/4 of the glass was filled with ice, tasted watered down. I asked for another one with light ice, and more tea. He came back right away with a new one and it was much better. Fried calamari was a big hit for my boyfriend he loves that stuff, we're always looking for some good calamari. It comes with a ranch dipping sauce and a a lemon aolli. The deep dish pizza was pretty good, it had a lot of toppings on it they weren't being cheap! Thai salad didn't seem really authentic to me. Maybe it's because I know usually it's made with green papays, fish sauce, and soft shell crabs. Instead this was replaced witchili powdeh lettuce, some shredded mangoes, some bell peppers, some chili powder, some avacado, and deep fried wonton stripes. The stuffed mushrooms were my favorite. Small bites with bursts of flavors. After all of that we ordered the mini trio pizookie. White chocolate macadamia, red velvet, and oreo. When they came Ohmygod my boyfriend just grabbed the white chocolate one and NOMED IT ALL.. He was so amazed. They come with big scoops of vanilla ice cream. It works really well because the cookie is baked in a little deep dish, the pan is still hot and the ice cream just melts on the pizookie. It's heaven.. The food is pretty good, I love the bar. They have so much choices. They also have happy hour only at the bar area.  Our waiter was kind of mia and took some time to notice us. We caught him watching tv lol. Other than that I'm looking forward to visiting again."
Viel A.,"San Francisco, CA",15,18,15,2.0,12/17/2010,"This BJ's specifically only gets 2 stars because the other BJs back in my hometown is not like this one. SERVICE SUCKS. For some reason, our orders always take longer than they should take and it takes FOREVER for our waitress/waiter to come greet us and take our orders.  Happy hour is a plus but still, this place needs to work on hiring people that give better service."
Miguel C.,"Duarte, CA",12,15,5,1.0,9/19/2013,"Bad service,was told the wait was 20 minutes ended up waiting 40 minutes,I then decided to check with another hostess and was told I was never in the waiting list. After this, I went to Chilis and they gave me a table for 5 right away."
Una H.,"San Bruno, CA",0,37,11,1.0,12/29/2013,"Been here several time with ok service. But this time (dinner Dec. 29) bad experience. Our server was Miguel. 1.) Were told the wait is 20 minutes.  We got seated 50 minutes later.   2.) We asked for water, no ice. Got water with ice.  3.)  We already got our appetizers and salads, but no utensils and napkins. Took long time to get those.  What? You want us to eat like we're in the Stone Age?  With our hands? 4.)  Ordered Spaghetti with meatballs. No meatballs.  When brought to server's attention, was told they don't really have meatballs but only meat is in the sauce. But told him it says in the menu:            ""Spaghetti with meat sauce......$11.00                    with meatballs....................13.00"" Got the meatballs, ga-zillion minutes later. Cmon server, we're not stupid. You are stupid for trying to wiggle your way out of this one with the stupid, lame excuse for getting the order wrong.  Next time, just own up to it and fix it right away. 5.)  Dirty glass used for soda.  At first it was not noticeable because glass was full.  But  as I drink I noticed spots and solid, dried up stuff on the glass.  An unwashed, dirty glass.   These are not just honest mistakes. These were due to laziness, inattentiveness, irresponsibleness.  Clearly reflects on the character of this server.   And Miguel, you're lucky to get $3.00 for a tip. Suppose to be none because of the bad service you provided.  Wanna have bigger tips?  Improve your service.   And this is not an isolated incident with regard to bad service/experience. Check other reviews."
Timothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",457,282,129,4.0,3/27/2011,"High calorie dense food at it's finest. One person really shouldn't eat a single entree by themselves. But it tastes sooooo goooood! The wait sucks, but I think the wait is supposed to make you more hungry so their food ends up tasting really good. So smart!"
Alessa S.,"Daly City, CA",29,5,,1.0,5/2/2012,"DISCLAIMER: This review is in regards to large events/parties at this location.  1) LIMITED RESERVATIONS FOR FRIDAYS AND WEEKENDS: You have to work with the time they have available for large parties. Because of the busyness at night, they generally only do reservations on Fridays and Saturdays during the lunch/late afternoon schedule, which is really difficult on a Friday considering a majority of people in our party are working, and don't get off until 6:00PM. As result, I had to schedule the dinner for a Thursday night.  2) UNPLEASANT STAFF: In arriving at the restaurant, the manager approached a waiter to let him know he would be handling our party. Since finding out, the waiter (I wish I could recall his name and will update once I find it) along with another employee obviously did not want to serve our party. This was apparent in the fact that I heard them talking amongst one another about the burden of serving our large party and the constant disgruntled stares I received which made me feel VERY unwelcomed and uncomfortable.  3) RUDE SERVER: The 1 star review is mainly in part to the HORRIBLE service we received. I understand that our server was unhappy with serving our party, but he didn't need to make it so apparent. After the dinner, many people in our party expressed how un-attentive and just plain RUDE our server was. He had an attitude with every one of our guests, which was unnecessary. (Again, once I get his name, I will update)  4) NO BIRTHDAY PIZOOKIE: One of the perks of having a birthday at BJ's is you receive a birthday pizookie. Towards the middle-end of dinner I asked our server to please bring out the pizookie with the candle. 30+ minutes pass, it never comes. As he's walking by me handing out to-go boxes, I tell him that they never brought it out. He tells me, ""Oh yes, let me go check on it."" Another 30 minutes pass, he comes back with the bill, NO pizookie. I give him my card to pay, and tell him a THIRD time to bring out the pizookie. He takes the bill with my card and says, ""Let me go get it..."" I must have missed him, because when I come back to our table the copy of our check is there and our server LEFT FOR THE NIGHT. NO thank you, NO bye, and NO birthday pizookie for my boyfriend after asking THREE times for it. I then tell another server who walks by that our original waiter never brought it out, and still it never comes.  To add insult to injury, upon gathering our things and walking out, another server approaches us at the exit with a to-go tin and says, ""Here's your pizookie... TO-GO."" No ice cream, no candle, and cold in a box. What really upset me is the fact that they were never planning on bringing it out while we were there and had it waiting in a to-go box. *The only PRO is the food and alcohol selection they offer at the restaurant. Horrible service and was constantly ignored by the servers! I definitely do not plan on having a large group/party at this location again. For the amount of money and business we gave them, NOT WORTH IT.*"
DayDay D.,"San Francisco, CA",4,77,,4.0,6/10/2010,"Contrary to other yelp reviews, I actually enjoy this place.  I understand it is a chain restaurant, but it seems to stay consistent whenever I visit a different one, Fremont, San Bruno, etc. Service is on point, food is good, we usually order the same thing, side salad, xtra garlic dressing on the side, flat bread pizza, mozzarella sticks, and beers. If we decide to try something different, and we don't like it, we speak up, and they are happy to change it to something else or give you a refund. It's easy, SPEAK UP people! Great happy hour specials, and always sit at the bar to get the deal!! Don't wait for a table, it takes too long."
Chase L.,"San Francisco, CA",97,111,22,2.0,9/9/2012,"The food took at least 90 minutes. I'm not talking from the time we walked in... I'm talking from the time we order it. They weren't busy. It was 1130am on a Sunday. The food wasn't bad, but the wait made me lose my appetite. Our waitress was really nice."
Carnita M.,Bay Area,94,291,589,2.0,7/4/2010,"I came here on a weekday night at 7 p.m. and was told there was a 30-minute wait for tables.  30 minutes turned into 45 minutes before we were finally seated.  The guy who showed us to our table seemed upbeat and apologized for the wait so I thought we were off to a good start.  I was wrong. We waited a very long time (I didn't check my watch but believe me when I say LONG!) before our waitress came to our table to take our order.  I was expecting an apology for the wait but got none at all.  She was not very attentive and was hardly ever around to check in on us. As for the food, I usually get their deep dish pizza which is only average compared to other places but on this visit I decided to try their mac and cheese.  It turned out to be very good and I was very pleased with my decision, though not too impressed that they brought the food to the wrong table.  I ended up getting some fries too which were ok but did not seem worth the nearly $5.00 they cost!  Since I was at BJ's I couldn't end my meal without a pizookie so I got my favorite, the white chunk macadamia.  I usually find it so, so yummy but the flavor seemed kind of ""off"" that night.  Oh yes, and the spoons we were given for our pizookie were very sticky!  We had to ask for new ones. It was packed and lively in the bar area and whole restaurant and I even spotted what I would consider some eye candy yet that's not enough to make me return to this place."
Marissa T.,"South San Francisco, CA",33,49,24,2.0,5/16/2011,"This could be a great place with the exception of the following: The food is good but at times the service is POOR!.  It's also on the pricey side which I am not willing to pay for again with the poor service.   Not a very friendly place,  from the moment you walk in, unlike other restaurants where everyone who works there seem to be happy you have chosen their restaurant instead of the many others surrounding them, the people who work here seem unhappy :( I'd like to come back because my kids love their alfredo pizza and their pazookie but I'm not, unless these things I have issues with changes..."
