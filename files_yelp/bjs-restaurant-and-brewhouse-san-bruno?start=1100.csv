Christina X.,"San Francisco, CA",42,50,29,4.0,10/16/2010,"Oh boy. If you don't like sports, don't come here when the Giant's game is on.  There will be a LONG ass wait, and VERY obnoxious fans. Basically just a lot of crowd.. noises. Booo! Yaaay. Etc. I love the food here. But when there's a wait, it really sucks.  My favorite is the calamari appetizer and their steak! I don't like their pastas. Their bbq pulled pork sandwich was nasty too. Way too much sauce. I don't really care for their pizzas either.  You should try their fresh homemade kettle chips though!"
Eddie L.,"Burlingame, CA",13,30,2,4.0,7/30/2011,"BJ's is definitely a go to place for me when I'm in the mood for good Sodas and great food. The wait is always a bit long, but it's expected for a good place like this. My favorite dinner plate has to be either the Spicy Spaghetti with Grilled Chicken, or the Pork Chops, which I recently tried. Another awesome thing about BJ's is its happy hour. I love mini pizzas and their AHI POKE is amazing. You can never go wrong with calamari of course, and their wings happen to be better than Hooters'. Their sodas come in awesome flavors. I've tried Cream Soda, Root Beer, Orange Cream, and Black Cherry, and all of them have NOT let me down. I come here on the regular, enough said. P.S. Pizookies everytime, if not, try the beignet!"
Alex A.,"Round Lake, IL",5,62,7,4.0,6/19/2013,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and BEER is delightful (good/wide variety of house brew and the standard domestic/import). i always get the pizza-either hand tossed or deep dish and it is always a treat."
fitulimaitauese i.,"South San Francisco, CA",71,12,5,3.0,9/1/2013,"I've been here numerous times. Food is good here! The service is unpredictable though. Sometimes they are quick and food arrives on a timely matter, but sometimes it takes way too long. Three days ago, service was quick and our waitress was awesome. We didnt have to ask her for refills or anything during lunch with 4 other family members. Today, 09/31, my husband and I had lunch there and our waiter had us waiting forever after we were seated. i got pissed. i didn't get to eat a pizookie (dessert) because I didnt want to wait again for that."
Ashley G.,"San Diego, CA",51,31,63,2.0,6/9/2013,I've been to many BJ's in the past but this one was one of the worst. It was extremely crowded on a Sunday and the service was very slow. Our waiter left all our plates at the table and rarely cleared it. My advice would be to not come at a regular dining hour.
Anriella D.,"Daly City, CA",204,65,37,3.0,1/7/2013,"2nd time going here, My boyfriend and I went here for date day on new years! 5 minutes of waiting for seating, Great! We got seated. I had the chicken Alfredo pasta, and he got the steak! The date was going great. The waiter was barely around though. Especially when i wanted a re-fill on water. Even waiting for the check and paying took a long time, But other than that it was okay."
Marisa R.,"San Francisco, CA",200,195,16,4.0,8/2/2010,"Plus one star for serving Pepsi products! Plus one star for good clam chowder.  Let's just say you get clam in every bite. Plus one star for great baked potatoes! Cheddar, bacon, butter and sour cream? Yes please! Plus one star for their Pasta! Simple yet tasty! Minus one star for the wait and for slow service.  I seriously think that we got reasonable service about once. But, positives outweigh the negatives.  I love BJs. haha."
Leana L.,"San Francisco, CA",322,889,281,1.0,6/30/2010,"We came here once before and had to wait terribly long for both our food and the bill, so we didn't have very high expectations when coming here again. However, BJ's surprised us once again and this time we had even worse service. (If you're wondering why we even bothered to come back, we came here per the request of a coworker who was celebrating her last day -- and the reason why she chose this place was likely b/c she had a gift card to BJ's) After setting us up with waters, our waiter took our appetizer order and then told us to hold off on ordering our entrees so that he could put in the appetizer order. A good 10 minutes later, he came back to take our entree order. A coworker and I chose a salad to share (when he ordered for us, he pointed to the large size and even emphasized that we were sharing). About another 10 minutes later, our appetizers came and then about 15 minutes after that, our entrees arrived, all served at once by a few assisting waiters. When our salad came, it was the tiny lunch portion! We sent it back since it obviously wouldn't be enough for both of us, and emphasized that we ordered the full-sized portion. After waiting another 10 minutes while everyone consumed their food, we asked the waiter what happened to our salad. Apparently there was no communication and he didn't even know we sent our salad back to get a full-sized order! So he had to go and put in another order. Abut 10 minutes later, when our coworkers were done with their food, we asked again about our salad. He said it would be ready in 5 minutes, so we asked that it just be packed up to-go. However, when another 10 minutes passed and everyone was ready for the bill, we were so fed up that we decided to cancel our order. Finally 5 minutes later, our waiter came to us with the bill and our salad packed to-go. He said we had a choice to make: we could take the salad or not take the salad and he would deduct it from our bill. Even after such poor service, he wasn't going to offer the salad for free or at a discount! We were so over the thought of eating an over-priced salad that we declined and opted to just grab food from our much cheaper on-site cafeteria at Genentech. This is definitely the last time I'll ever go to this BJ's again."
Sandy L.,"Oakland, CA",6,56,,3.0,7/12/2011,"Dinner with BF and two of his BFFs. We had a hard time choosing from the menu because everything looked and sounded delicious, but we didn't want to be disappointed.  We ordered the Best Beginnings and Ahi Poke and devoured everything. The only disappointment with the Best Beginnings were the mozzarella sticks; I think they were underdone. I loved the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Eggrolls. Yummy! The boys each ordered a giant baked potato and an entree. BJs was not lying about the potatoes - those things were gigantic. I didn't get to sample because I was working on my own entree - Shrimp Scampi. I think they gave me three servings on one plate. Nonetheless, it was delicious (even moreso with Tabasco) and I think the breadcrumbs with the pasta made it a winner. I was disappointed with my Strawberry Mojito. It was gross. The Blonde beer was not bad - I'd drink it again. I took away two stars for the mozzarella sticks + drinks and my super sticky chair. When I left, I noticed my pants and my bag became all sticky - what was up with that?! Ugh. Not exactly how you want your customers feel when they leave."
Mark S.,"Hayward, CA",8,149,3,3.0,7/7/2013,Service better than food.  Food luke warm to say the best.  Fish in tacos small.  Pull pork sandwich is mostly bread.  Waiter had food prepared as ordered. Unfortunately the food was not hot. It would be a good place if the food was hot.  I would only come back if the food would be hot.
Nate P.,"Daly City, CA",106,127,48,4.0,4/21/2011,"Been here numerous times and reviewing it for the first time. Why? Who cares! :-P  Great place to hang out after a long day at work. Food is good. Vibe is excellent..and the drinks are decent. Not fond of the ""measure and pour"" tactics of the bartenders, but they do have rules to abide by. If one is looking to get drunk...either go to real bar or sneak your own bottle in. Just sayin.  Oh..and let me just say, if you haven't tried a Pizookie...well..try it dammit! It'll make you wet yourself. Ya..it's that good...."
Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,982,176,1.0,9/12/2010,"I've finally figured it out. I've analyzed my relationship with BJs because I've been coming here steadily (well, steadily across CA and AZ) over the past 8 years. I've always loved their salads. Always. I've sung their praises. I've written haikus over their pizookies. It was that good for me. Five years ago we moved out of the country for a year and then landed back in the US, this time in AZ. Low and behold...near our sketchy apartment was a BJs! YAY! ( ) Salads made me happy. Pizookie made me happy. Beer for hubby? Not so much. We moved in AZ, buying a home. In that area, just up the 202 towards Chandler, we found another BJs that was located in a mall. Hubby, being the beer man he is, was excited because this is the BJs where they brewed their beer and distributed to the other BJs across the state (or so he read in his research). Plus, the brew master worked there 5 days a week. I think he was having visions of beer discussions. Anyway, here is the review I wrote for that BJs -    Their service and salads sucked in the times we went. We stopped going there. Cupertino BJs, here's your review I wrote -   - despite the fact I've been here at least 10 times. I finally remembered to write a review thanks to the handy check in thing for Yelp on my iPhone. And this place, the San Bruno location, is the BJs that put the nail in the BJs coffin for us...We will not come to a BJs ever again. It's being removed off of our chain food list. How did BJs screw it up so feckin badly for us? A) The Beer. Over the years we've had consistently shitty tasting beer, but when BJs get their beer right we immediately overlooked 4 years worth of bad beer. But do we really want to wait every 4 years to have one good beer make up for the others? No. Like I said, we've finally figured it out. Just a note: if you're going to say you're a brew house/brew pub, your beer had better be fucking stellar. Fat Tire is not the be all end all. Fat Tire is one step above MIller High Life for n00b beer drinkers (that stunning analogy came courtesy of beer lover and consumer Matt) who think they know their brew. They don't. They really don't. On a final note, we don't know what the hell all the BJs do, but somehow, their beer consistently tastes old and stale. Like it sat out in the sun before going into refrigeration. How can all the BJs manage to screw it up? Maybe it's the distributor they use, but when you somehow manage to screw up a Guinness on tap, you're in big trouble. B) The Food. Over the years the food has gotten saltier. While I still enjoy their salads, I can't really deviate from anything else because the salt content is so high it adversely affects me - my fingers swell, I drink a gallon of water and then spend the rest of the day (or night) on the toilet. Sorry if it's TMI. C) The Service. I know that my husband can be fussy about his beer. He's not shy about sending it back. I'm not shy about sending my food back, either. We're not rude any time we've had to do it. But for some reason, the moment we do it, our table becomes a ghost town - completely devoid of service. On several occasions we've almost walked out because we were kept waiting for 20 minutes before our server would come back. This not only happened at this BJs, but the Cupertino and Chandler, AZ, one as well. Anyway, long story short...stick a fork in BJs for us. It's done. We won't be coming back. After 8 years, I'm finally kicking your restaurant to the curb. No more making excuses.  I will no longer be a victim to your bad food, bad beer and bad service any more."
Gayle Y.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",313,14,3,3.0,3/4/2014,Went here for lunch and everything was going well. Until we got to dessert and our waitress told us THEY GOT RID OF THE RED VELVET PIZOOKIE and replaced it with a salted caramel one. It's okayyyy. Not better than the red velvet one though. WHY!!!!!!
Anthony S.,"South San Francisco, CA",80,6,,2.0,6/15/2012,"I went into this place and waited 30 minutes to sit down. not complaining about that, i knew it was busy and i chose to stay. when i was getting seated, one of the hosts saw his friends walk in and wasn't subtle about saying, ""oh let me make room for you"" they didn't have to wait. aside from the hostess who I'm kicking myself for not getting her name, the entire staff was rude to us. we didn't get any silverware or napkins, and when we asked a passing waitress for them, she was rude about it too know your busy but come on. Also, a waiter slapped a waitress's ass as he passed by her. I didn't really want to know these two were hooking up, especially while i was eating. I talked to the manager, but he just apologized and didnt offer to compensate or anything. kind of a bummer cause i like this place."
Angela N.,"Oakland, CA",297,187,31,4.0,3/21/2010,"The great thing about Yelp Check-Ins, is that I realize how often I forget to review my ""regular"" places. I've been a quasi-regular at this place since it opened in the newly remodeled Tanforan mall. First, for late night noshing when I used to work graves, then weekend lunches when I was on the weekend shift...and now, the occasional mid day get away from work lunch or happy hour drinks and munchies. Great beers and beverages.  I love their clam chowder and salad for lunch.  The Thai chicken lettuce wraps and their Pulled pork sliders are also delish.  Oh, and if you're feeling indulgent, their spinach artichoke dip is great too.   This is a popular place, so get used to stalking tables at the bar or be prepared for a 30 minute wait.  The staff has always been friendly and will occasionally come around with appetizers while you're waiting."
Laurie C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2015,"I've been a regular at this BJ's for years, but I was severely disappointed tonight. I never do Yelp reviews, but this was enough to make me write one. At around 9:15pm, my boyfriend and I walked into BJ's, hoping to get a simple takeout of appetizers. I should've spotted a red flag when the total for 3 appetizers came up to $40. We waited about 20 mins for our food, and as we check the food before we leave - we realize we got the Sriracha bacon mac n cheese, when we specifically told the guy we wanted the appetizer one. My boyfriend hates Sriracha (I know, right?). Guess the guy couldn't figure out where the option for mac n cheese was on the register, so he just took the closest one. They also never informed us that the appetizer gourmet mac n cheese was removed from the menu. We return the mac n cheese, only to see there was nothing on our sliders except the beef + the bun. No tomato. No onion. Nothing. All the while, employees are on their phones, gossiping. I've worked in retail/customer service, and no supervisor of mine would tolerate having a phone out during shift or not keeping busy in some way. When the sliders came back, there was cheese, but nothing else on them - that alone took 15 minutes. The employee then told us, ""The chefs do what the chefs do."" After waiting for an hour and receiving no apology, we left very disappointed."
Flavia P.,"Burlingame, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/12/2015,"My boyfriend and I, come here almost every week and we decided to stop by today! We always have a great time, great service. But today wasn't one of those days... We had just a horrible server... She didn't care about taking our order, she was very rude and disrespectful!!!  Ohh well I guess, hopefully next time it will be better."
Girly Foodie F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,116,,4.0,12/10/2014,"My hubby and I come to BJ's for the baby back ribs, baked potato and wedge salad and the most delicious BJ Porter beer!  Large portions for the price and the ribs are usually very tasty and succulent. The shoestring fries are also great. Don't care much for their desserts (they need to expand the choices....Pazookies are just okay.) We have been happy 99% of the time.  It's delicious, reasonably priced and the restaurant is pleasant and nicely decorated.  We've always had friendly and prompt service, so don't quite get what the complaints are all about. There is often a wait if you come on weekends after 5:30pm and they can get very  busy, which is a good sign. It's a chain...and geared to families and people who want a decent meal, great beer choices and full bar, and reasonably priced food.  It's casual and pleasant. My only complaint would be that the restrooms need tending to more often. All in all, this is a fun, pleasant place to come have a decent meal. (I am only speaking about the ribs...that's all we ever get here.)"
Ben E.,"San Carlos, CA",2,11,,1.0,9/8/2013,"We have been a number of times and while I can't say I ""hate"" it, I will go to Jack's 100% of the time before I go to BJ's (much more friendly, family-run, and better quality food). My main complaint is with the service. Over the 6+ times we went there, every single time we had to wait a very long time for a server to come to us and about 75% of the time there would be an error with our order. I ordered a steak there twice and both times ordered medium-rate but it came to me well-done. Very slow service and an unappealing ""corporate"" feel to it. Certainly prefer Jack's even if the menu there is not as comprehensive."
Michelle B.,"Oakland, CA",762,362,450,3.0,9/20/2010,"This is our go-to place when we want to do the chain restaurant thing. Definitely a cut above all the chains I'd rather not mention. I'm a bit perplexed with myself as I only order one thing on this massive size menu - the spaghetti with meat sauce and an add-on of meatballs. Sometimes, when we feel like going nutz..we order the fried calamari - uh huh - we loco!  My girls love their kid's menu as do i for the bargain value and big portions - $5 friggin dollars and 95 friggin cents for an entree plus side PLUS a drink - free refills - with that kind of value we can do an occasional chain-restaurant visit.  The service is hit or miss...good thing tips are based on the service - cuz if you suck you ain't getting jack! comprende?"
