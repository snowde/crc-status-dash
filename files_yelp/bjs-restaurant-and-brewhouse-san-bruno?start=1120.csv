Fashionista M.,"New York, NY",2,34,,2.0,11/9/2014,"The 2 stars go to our server, who gave okay service. Every time we go here (mind you it's only after watching a movie at the mall's cinema) it truly sucks from the minute you sit down to paying the check. First the host sat us at an empty station (on a busy Sat night which I could only assume a server was on break). That said, a near 10 minutes went by and 5 different servers, 2 bussers and the manager passed us without any acknowledgement. The manager, an attractive woman in her late 20's, early 30's passed by at least twice and gave us no attention even though we sat there looking up at everyone waiting for service. I've worked in the industry for years and it's unacceptable. Next, the food is mediocre but we expect that, it's not even a real brewery, but we were starving and tired after the long wait. So, my main issue time after time with this restaurant is the service well lack thereof and the management in my eyes is not impressive. She could have at least stopped for a second to apologize. My friend who works for a secret shopper company will be hearing about my experience."
Astha S.,"Livermore, CA",0,164,,4.0,7/19/2013,"I like food and service here. Best BJ, I hate the foster city and east bay ones... pizookie is my fav, like the sandwiches and fries.."
Lisa K.,"San Mateo, CA",12,66,,1.0,5/29/2014,Horrible front desk service!  I was told 20 minute wait; after 30 mins I check with the front desk (she was very snotty today) she informed me that I was only waiting 26 mins not 30 and the tables were not ready.  It would be another 10 minutes.  After waiting an additional 15 minutes; we asked how much longer and were informed an additional 20-25 minutes. It's not their fault the timing was off.  Yet the people that came in after us that were groups of 4 were seated.  You really need to remove whoever the short hostess working at btw 6:25 -7:25. She was not someone you want representing BJ's  .
Amanda L.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,18,1,1.0,12/16/2012,"Horrible. They said I would wait for 15 minuets it took 30 minuets.  I have ordered the Bake Mac every time i come hopeing it is better than the last and every time there is something missing whether is the cheese sauce, or the crumb toppings.  Once i found an onion in it.  It also came with crunchy garlic cheesy bread sticks that this time was a soft plain slice of bread. I also waited 10 minuets for a scoop of ice cream.  After I finished the waiter walked by me 4 times before he realized the little bowl I had was on the other side of the table and I wanted the check.   Seriously never going there again!!!!!!!"
Kimiko Q.,"San Francisco, CA",32,335,32,3.0,2/10/2011,"Monday night dining.  Restaurant was only about a third full.  Chose this because it was getting late (pushing 9:30) and this place is open till 12am.  Unfortunately I was told the kitchen closes much earlier so we couldn't lounge around and see if we wanted more food down the road. Two people.  We ordered: Spinach & Artichoke Pizza.  Very cheesy.  Cream cheese on top.  Very skimpy with the spinach.  Mostly dried, tiny pieces that resembled the size of cilantro.  Not bad but not delicious either.  If it weren't a deep dish, it would very much resemble a fast food pizza. Grilled Burger Melt.  Extremely greasy.  Special sauce that resembled a spicy version of thousand island.  And cheese.  Lots of it.  Me, a meat eater, seriously thought it needed a good dose of veggies (tomatoes & lettuce PLEASE).  The skinny fries were good though. Grilled Chicken Pasta (w/Broccoli):  Disappointing.  I could make this at home.  Not enough broccoli.  What is it with this place and their ability to withhold anything healthy from dishes?  Cream sauce was nothing to write home about.   Waitress didn't refill our drinks.  I know it was towards the end of our meal but we were thirsty! Average food is average.  Oh yeah, we paid about $50 something."
Scott O.,"San Bruno, CA",11,39,5,2.0,7/20/2010,"The most important thing to know about going to BJ's is that the Hosts will never give you an accurate wait time. Take what ever time they give you and add 15 minutes... at least. Most of the time you're better off looking in the bar area for a seat, because they'll open up sooner than you'll get a table. Sadly you have to pay attention and be ready to move quickly, because there will be someone else doing the same thing. Once you get past the frustration of getting a table things are pretty smooth sailing. The food is what you'd expect, and the staff is ok... The management rocks, or at least the one time I had to deal with them it was great (new server gave our item to wrong table and we had to wait for a new one to be made. Manager gave us our meal for free.) But the frustration of waiting forever for tables, and since you sometimes get a crap waiter...  Cheers."
Brendan L.,"San Francisco, CA",439,180,6,3.0,4/24/2011,Meh...its salty...its slow....its average tasting...went for a happy hour and the drinks where not bad....the food was average.... DO NOT get the mini tacos....might as well go to the taco truck across the street to get more food for the price... The skinny fries were good...but got boring fast I have the burgers they are OK..... I got a Snake Bite (guinness+cider) it was good...but my friend got more cider than guinness
C T.,"San Francisco, CA",2,8,2,1.0,10/9/2014,"awful customer arrive or lack of. came in tonight a little after 11pm. we walked in and was not greeted by anyone, so we walked towards a table and a server/busser? was clearing a table and mumble something and pointed us to another area? we were so confused at what he was trying to say but went over to a booth and sat down. they still have a used table cloth in the booth and a tab from previous customer, we stood around waiting to see if anyone would come by but nobody came by.  as we sat and waited to be greeted and our menus. we sat and waited and waited some more. after what felt like 10 minutes someone finally came and grabbed the tab from a previous customer, dropped off our menus and said ""you water is on the way, any else I can get you?"" we obviously weren't ready and said to give us a few minutes.  as we look through the extensive menu on what to order, not once did anyone walk  by to see if we were ready or needed recommendations etc. I totally understand its later in the night, they close at midnight, but they were not crazy busy. I say half of the tables were occupied? but most of the folks were done? from what it looked like they had 2 bar tenders, and 2-3 servers and possibly 1-2 bussers?  finally a server came by with water! she dropped off 2 glasses of water when we a total of 5 people at the booth! she didn't say ""I'll be right back with some more water"" or ""we will be right with you"" or anything. just dropped off 2 glasses and dropped off the rest of the waters to another table that was seated AFTER us in a section that was empty when we walked in where someone had mumbled to us and having us sit else where.  as the 5 of us sit there staring at the 2 glasses of water and the servers standing around or going back and forth, still nobody acknowledged us or told us they would be with us. we looked around and other tables that were seats after us were having their orders taken, but not once did anyone look our way to see if we needed help or again let us know that they will be with us. we sat and waited and finally I decided I couldn't wait anymore. we all finally decided at 11:35pm to leave. 35 minutes for 2 glasses of water and nobody to check on us if we were ready. no thank you.  to the management of this establishment, you need more trained and attentive staff. I myself help bar tend and manage a very busy bar nightclub, and everyone that I was with is all in customer service related or hospitality fields and felt the level of service or lack of, was unacceptable. we will NOT be coming back ever. even if you retrain and notify your staff and offered us a discount or a comped meal/drink (cause it would probably take 45 to get that meal or drink) apparently we aren't the only ones that feel this way since a lot of the reviews all say the service is really lacking. good luck to whoever manages this place. and especially good luck to whoever tries to enjoy this establishment with some food or a drink."
Tyler L.,"San Francisco, CA",101,82,2,5.0,11/24/2012,"Just went to BJ's the other day for my first time and had a great experience! I was kind of surprised because I know it's a chain, but the food and service spoke for itself. I wasnt sure what to order so i asked our service, I think his name was Keith? and he suggested one of their pizzas. Since I already took his suggestion on what beer to have (which was AMAZING!), i figured i would take him up on his second suggestion. GREAT CHOICE! Great beer, great pizza and great service....3 strikes and you win! Will come back again soon!"
Jess W.,"San Francisco, CA",66,554,528,4.0,12/23/2010,"For $12 with tip and tax I got the grilled chicken pesto flat bread pizza. It was yummy. I have nothing to compare it to, but it was good."
Anthony M.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,4.0,10/8/2013,"I like their selection of food and the portion sizes.  Also a great place to watch sports.  However it is a huge chain, so it is ran like one."
Debby D.,"Burlingame, CA",3,147,2,2.0,5/25/2014,"okay, two stars are... just right for this place. food is cold, service was long, and some people aren't too friendly. the reason is that there isn't a one star is because of the desserts... its the only thing that I didn't mind. but I don't think this place isn't really ideal for a good place for people to have a deep conversation or you want a meaningful meal :-("
Andrew G.,"Daly City, CA",86,29,5,2.0,9/14/2012,"HOW ABOUT A NO. Not only does this place have the longest wait time in like all of California, but the service is pretty bad. This restaurant is a hell hole on Friday & Saturday nights! My friends & I, waited nearly 2 and a half hours one Friday night, just to be told that they are starting to clear up our table & should be seated within another 20-25 minutes. HOW WONDERFUL BITCHES. Once we are seated, our waiter seems to be within the last hour of her shift by never smiling & bringing our WATERS to us 20 minutes later. The food was pretty good, but not worth no hour of wait. IT WAS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS how one half of our party got their food 30 minutes before the other half. I mean like, c'mon people. To hell with this place! We drove up at 6pm, left the restaurant at 1045pm. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! Never again BJ's, never again."
Kimberly Y.,"San Francisco, CA",225,23,89,4.0,2/19/2011,"Well the best thing about this place is the PIZZA. I was never a fan of deep dish but after BJ's i loved deep dish. Not that I really like deep dish and I would never eat deep dish anywhere else but this place is the bomb. I got the sliders and they were great. The french fries were thinly cut and divine.  Every time i go to BJ's i get the strawberry lemonade and it was delicious. and THE GREATEST thing was the PIZOOKIE. Large cookies, melt in your mouth, and scrumdidliumcious(how do you spell that?) with ice cream on top made it one of best desserts i have ever tasted in my life. If you go there you it is a must order. The staff was okay. Nothing special but cordial. It was kinda loud and the food took a while to come but the pizookie made it all worth it."
Edom M.,"Tracy, CA",0,8,,5.0,10/21/2014,"Everytime I have come here the customer service has been amazing, STEVEN has been the best BY FAR, Steven was very attentive on a busy night, & Genuine."
kim p.,"San Francisco, CA",50,25,,4.0,8/1/2011,"i wanted to originally watch the giants game at home, but since neither my bf or i felt like cooking we yelped some sports bars around the ingleside/daly city area. I've only been to the tanforan mall a couple of times but i noticed this brewery on my way to ulta, and finally thought i'd give it a try. the decorum is standard, very clean, airy and spacious. we sat at the sports bar area at a booth and we had 3 tvs to view in regards to watching the giants/reds game that was on. the server was very friendly and accommodating. we ordered the spinach/artichoke dip with chips, fried calamari, small deep dish pizza, potato skins and a side of the friend aritchokes. we had more than enough food, with enough to take home. the pizza tasted just as good even the next day."
M J.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,177,334,4.0,3/16/2012,"My coworkers brought me here a couple of days ago for an ""Admin Lunch and Movie Day"". I didn't know what was good to order, so it took me quite a while to look over their menu and decide. I'm a heavy eater so I ordered their pot roast. It came with white cheddar mash potato and vegetables. It was yummy! I don't like too much gravy, so that kind of killed my plate. We ended up ordering their dessert since we had time to spare before our movie started. They're famous for their ""pizookie"" (soft, mushy pie cookie in an aluminum pan). I love red velvet, so I ordered their red velvet pizookie. It was a little sweet for me having too much sweet cream cheese and white chocolate chunks. It would have been perfect if it was a little harder. No harsh complaints about BJ's. Don't really have too much here in the bay area. They're all scattered and far from where I live though."
Mike T.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/28/2012,"We loved BJ's in Irvine a couple of years ago and also the one in Concord, so I was looking forward to going to the BJ's at Tanforan.  BJ's has CHANGED over the years, or maybe it's just this one at Tanforan: The BJ's Combination pizza just had a thin veneer of toppings on it. Just a few micro-pepperoni and some Italian sausage bits. Tomatoes. All bread, no substance. I was very disappointed. The good:  We were seated quickly. The pizza arrived promptly, after we sent back the first pizza they brought us because it was the wrong one.  The beer selection is huge, and the price for a pint draft is reasonable.  Medium pizza and two beers: $40 for two including tip."
Chris C.,"Las Vegas, NV",18,17,,2.0,7/20/2013,"For a place that prides itself on its pizza, this was an unacceptable experience. I ordered the BJ specialty pizza, expecting a deep dish. I did not get a deep dish (perhaps that was my fault for not checking to see), but what was worse was the fact that the pizza was soggy on the bottom. The top was cooked okay, but the bottom was soggy. The pizza was placed on a large place which may have been the reason, but the pizza was lukewarm and the bottom was soggy. It was pretty gross. My mom ordered desert and got their beignets (I can't remember how to spell the name). It tasted very generic. Too sweet, very plastic, very processed. It didn't taste fresh, it tasted heated up. I've had a number benaitslkwoiaiasdf from New Orleans to Disney World to fairs and farmers markets, but that was probably the tackiest benaipwnapsifjasl I've ever had. I've been to other BJ restaurants that were much better. The service was okay, but I definitely had to work hard to get some attention from our server."
Ally C.,"San Francisco, CA",238,184,96,4.0,2/21/2010,"Personally I don't think you can ever go wrong with BJ's. When all else fails, I'd like to say that I fall back on BJ's-- but strictly for the food, not the service. I have yet to try a plate from BJ's that will leave me with a sad face. So far I've tried a multitude of dishes, from their chicken wings, chicken parm, pizza, avocado spring rolls, Santa Fe spring rolls, spinach & artichoke dip, sandwiches, the list goes on and on and not once has any of these dishes left me thinking I've made a mistake.  The one thing that everyone needs to try when going to BJ's is definitely the pizookie. It's such a simple dessert concoction that one can easily make at home, but for some reason even knowing that I can simply save money and make my own, never stops me from getting one at BJ's. I think the reason why is because whenever I get one, I get one for free. The technique to doing so is to simply tell your server that it's your best friend's birthday while she's stepped out to the bathroom and VOILA you've got yourself a free divine dessert with no extra charge! Trust, it never fails... until one day BJ's management reads my Yelp entry and decides to enforce a ""check your ID to clarify your birthday"" policy. Great... Anyway, I stressed earlier that I come to BJ's for their food and not their service because I've had a handful of loony servers for the last times I've been here. Personally I think there's a difference between being friendly and being overly crackheaded happily friendly. The last two times I went here I had one of those servers which left me feeling reluctant to ask for another glass of water so I wouldn't have to hear how my server loved the new Lady Gaga album and how she's a ""free bitch"" and have to hear her sing broken lyrics to such a fine song. Geez lady, please let me enjoy my meal in sweet solitude with the occasional drink refills and ""how's your meal"" next time. Thanks!"
