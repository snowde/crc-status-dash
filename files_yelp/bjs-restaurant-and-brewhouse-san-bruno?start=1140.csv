Shirl C.,"Daly City, CA",23,80,55,3.0,9/8/2010,I love me some happy hour! I wouldn't pay full price for these even if it was cheap .. but definitely only during happy hour 2 dollars off appetizers from 4-7 M-F  Not a fan of everything on the menu just these; *Avocado Egg Rolls  *Tuna Tar tare  *Potato Chips  *Spinach Dip  *Fish Taco  *Mediterranean Pizza  *Bruchetta  * Chicken wings (not really cant beat houlahans)
Bella B.,"San Francisco, CA",364,612,364,2.0,1/31/2010,"What is the hype? I don't get it....the drinks were the best part of the $100+ meal... Had the skins (ok...) the spinach dip (yum) and the balsamic chicken (yuk) and my boy had the country fried steak (I liked it, but I could have made better) and we tried one of their pizzas which was pretty decent. But honestly for a 45min+ wait - it was just not worth a return trip for me."
Melissa G.,"Chicago, IL",27,23,,1.0,4/19/2013,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night, place was pretty busy but didn't seem too chaotic. We asked how long the wait was and the host told us about 15-20 minutes, she gave us a pager and told us we could walk around the mall but not too far. After 45 minutes we asked the host what was up and how much longer she thought it might be. She seemed a little flustered and said soon. I noticed some people just walking in and sitting at tables near the bar so I asked if we could sit up there and she said yeah all that is open seating, would have been great to know that to begin with but accidents happen and she probably just forgot to remind us or maybe thought we had been there before. The food was okay but some of it was definitely frozen and not fresh or made in house.  They have a ton of beers on tap which were all pretty good.  Service was okay, server didn't really check back on us, which kind of ruined it for me because I ordered fettuccini alfredo and it had been sitting in the window for a while because the plate was super hot when it was delivered and the all the sauce had dried up and the pasta was stuck together. We were almost done and the server came to ask if we wanted any desserts but I asked if he could bring me a side of alfredo so I could finish my dinner. He did and apologized for the way it came out but we never saw a manager nor did one come to our table.  Next time I will probably only go to have beers & appetizers on their patio."
Kari G.,"San Mateo, CA",236,754,221,4.0,11/30/2012,"This is my go to place for delicious pizookie. How could you not love a hot cookie covered in delicious ice cream? I seem to be biased towards their deep dish baking because my other favorite here is the pizza. It comes out in the oven dish piled high with all kinds of goodies. The sweet pig is the best! This BJ's recently added an outdoor patio. It has a big fire pit, plenty of warmers and glass windows around it so that you can stay nice and toasty even in the winter."
Larry B.,"South San Francisco, CA",27,170,113,2.0,8/2/2012,"This place always sucks for service. I am liking the food, it's close to home, but again, the service was the worst ever this time! We sat ""outside"" in the Mall area, and i think they forgot about us! I've been here before, and it wasn't bad, but still not great, they always seem understaffed and overstuffed with clientele. The happy hour is ok, and they have a late night happy hour as well, but it's not the greatest deal if you're hungry. Try the in house root beer on tab, it's bottomless as well, and pretty tasty. Enjoy, and good luck finding parking! : - |"
Sun T.,"San Francisco, CA",7,198,35,3.0,3/5/2011,I usually stay away from chain restaurants but ...  ya know for a chain restaurant its not bad at all. Came here for a last minute b-day dinner because no one in SF would accommodate 20 last minute guest  =P Ordered the Jambalaya and a Pilsner to combat the spicy kick from the Jambalaya.  BJ's version is dry and heavily spiced.  I wish they offered Étouffée but then again it probably wouldn't taste so great since its a chain restaurant. Some people ordered the deep dish pizza and it looked pathetic.  More bread and crust instead of generous toppings.  There were appetizers but nothing memorable.  I probably wouldnt come back.  In all honesty I only went because my friend ex-boyfriend was there and she needed a skilled c*ck blocker.  Its the least I can do because she's my wing girl. =D  Otherwise I would've stuck to the original plan which was dinner in SF with a smaller group and everyone would meet at Roe.   Ps: Roe sucks. avoid but if you must then bring good people with you and drink heavily because you'll want to forget the idiots you encountered earlier in the evening.  IE: when you were sober. =P
William B.,"San Francisco, CA",3986,482,4064,4.0,3/25/2012,"Its my very first time ever that... I have ever eaten dinner at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse of San Bruno... I have past by BJ's to many many times and have not eaten there... Except for buying a souvenir beer mug during the holidays of 2011 and used the restrooms many many times... Butttt until today, I finally walked in into BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse on a sunday night which was still day light with my family... When I got inside it was a little crowded at the time... The hostess told us it would be a half hour wait in which it didnt take that long of a wait... There were alot of customer that have left BJ's so that gave us a table of four without waiting that long... When we got seated by the hostess in which so was very friendly!!! As soon as we sat at the table... I was ready and I ordered myself a Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak... Which came out nice and hot I definitely would wanna come back to try another item to munch on the next time I come back... And one more thing like in some of my other yelp reviews... The restrooms of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse of San Bruno isnt that bad... I have used it before and it isnt really really that dirty!!!"
Brandon J.,"Fremont, CA",27,21,1,1.0,8/26/2013,"Hmm...what can I say about this place. BJ's is a great place with great food, just NOT at this location! Went in this past Saturday, and it was the worst experience. It was my birthday and I wanted a great lunch...Well it didn't happen! Got there and was seated immediately...Our server took our drink orders and 15 minutes later she still hadnt returned. Another woman came with drinks finally and announced herself as the ""new server""...She took our orders, but never returned...She comes back with another server named John...and said he was the ""rightful server""...I guess they name themselves all the special names. We were hungry and just wanted our food at this point...Our food finally did come...But our appetizer(avocado rolls) came AFTER our main entree. The manager came to our table with a blank face and simply stated, I will take these off the bill for you...He acted like he was doing us a favor for their mistake.  Our food was under-cooked, and sent back! Im assuming they were short staffed, which is common, but you should NOT seat people in areas where there is NO help. We would of been content on just waiting or going to another nearby restaurant...at this point, a Big Mac would of been better than the mess we were served! Although our food was under-cooked and cold, we still paid our bill and tipped John more than 18%...it wasn't his fault. He tried to do damage control but it was too late. I would suggest anyone coming here think twice about it...And if you feel like you just have to eat BJ's right now, select John as your server."
Nicholas G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,32,,4.0,10/29/2013,"The food here is excellent and the service is great.  I take my family here all the time.  If you have a child that will need high-chair, be sure to tell them when they put your name down on the waiting list.  There have been a few times we've had to give up our table because it would not accommodate a high-chair.  Also, the waits are often very long on weekend evenings.  You can call ahead to put your name down on the list but that often doesn't seem to help much.  For example, we would call and they would quote us about a 30-45 minute wait.  When we get there 30 minutes later, they then say it will be another 30-45 minutes.  WTF?!  The one nice thing about the wait is that you can walk around the mall area a little instead of standing in their small waiting area.  I know the buzzer works throughout the Barnes & Noble which is right across from them."
Crystal Marie O.,"Vallejo, CA",112,13,,2.0,10/1/2010,"I've been to this BJ's a total of 4 times and EACH TIME I've been here, I have almost slipped! Their floors are toooooo slippery, like seriously. I actually slipped in their bathroom BUTTTTT I didn't fall on my ass, I luckily caught my balance and grabbed onto the women's stall. The service was okay, attentive to myself and others that I was with. However, one female server was a bit sloppy and just didn't seem to care for our table.  The size of the place isn't too bad, rather large; there is a wait on busy days as it is connected to Tanforan Mall.  I think the only reason I'll come back here is for their PIZOOKIE. Other than that, their damn floors are tooooo SLIPPERY!"
Jessica O.,"Burlingame, CA",0,14,1,1.0,10/27/2011,The food is good BUT THE SERVICE IS B.A.D!!!!!!   Not good for large groups because it will take a while to get seated plus when we get seated no body great us to what to drink or even give us menu for like pass 20 min.  Then we all just walke out after that. DO NOT COME HERE GO TO ELEPHANT BAR IN SERRAMONTE OR IN BURLINGAME MUCH BETTER SERVICE.
Rachel H.,"San Francisco, CA",83,399,3,3.0,1/15/2013,"This place is huge, but it is always so busy! Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes if you come here for dinner. The service isn't that great, but the food is consistently good. There is great variety, so there's something for anyone."
Dalia M.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",184,503,10,4.0,10/27/2008,"Been here a few times. Wait is always an issue when we've gone but most of the time we have been lucky enough to find a seat at a bar booth/table. Waited once for about 20 minutes at around 8pm. The food is good, well priced and service is always really attentive and nice. They have their own beers which my boyfriend loves! Always go here when we're in the area."
Rhia R.,"South San Francisco, CA",256,600,483,4.0,4/19/2010,"It's often a hit or miss when it comes to the wait, but the food is pretty consistent. After enjoying a beautiful day in SF, a small group of us headed here and arrived just in time for happy hour. We helped ourselves to one of the empty tables (gasp) and were immediately greeted by our server. A few rounds of beer with Piranha nachos and chicken wings totally hit the spot. The nice weather allowed for some of the customers to use their outdoor patio, which is ideal if you want to engage in conversation without the inside noise. If I had room leftover for dessert, I would have loved to get a pizookie."
Leslie P.,"Torrance, CA",70,1012,1212,3.0,4/7/2010,"i used to come here a lot. and by a lot i mean 2-3 times a year. haha i usually like to try new places, and not frequent chain restaurants. but i would come here when my friends would roll deep like no other. this is a good place to have 20-30 people for birthday dinners, which is why i came all the time. my friends loved setting up dinners here for big groups!  the food: it's a brewery/restaurant, so expect american bar food. i liked the blackened chicken pizza. it was piping hot when it came out! most people come for the pizookies. it is basically a giant cookie pie brought to your table hot & fresh, topped with scoops of icecream (cookies n cream or vanilla). it's yummy, but VERY simple to make. and being a passionate baker myself, i usually don't rave about desserts that are easy to make, like this one. it's even easy for non-bakers... just buy premade cookie dough from your local grocery store, throw it onto a cake pan, smoosh it down a bit and bake. top with store bought icecream and ta-da! a homemade pizookie!"
Ali L.,"San Francisco, CA",52,115,1,3.0,1/5/2011,"This place is kinda like the last Jennifer Aniston movie I saw---I can't really remember how and why I got roped into the suffering.   We came here to kill some time because of my severely delayed flight and I found myself drowning my sorrows in their killer micro beer selection.  Seriously, they have Goose Island Matilda.   We ordered their flatbread to share and I got their pulled pork sliders.  Blah.  Nothing memorable.  But I will remember the $50 I dropped on lunch for two."
Rebecca N.,"San Francisco, CA",3,37,1,1.0,6/16/2013,"Five things about this place:  1. One time, I ordered a salad and I FOUND A HAIR IN IT!  I didn't even get to eat it. Lost my appetite by the time they ""remade"" my order. It was poorly plated the first time around and even uglier the second time around. It seemed as if they removed the hair and added more dressing to the plate since my lettuce was soggy.  2. Service is terrible unless the place is empty. If it's a busy day, don't expect your food to come quickly. You'll be waiting forever.  3. The servers love to socialize...with other servers.  4. The servers are too scripted. It's scary.   5.Every time I've come here, my food has been lukewarm.  Terrible. I can't even..."
Connie Y.,"Fullerton, CA",185,141,114,4.0,11/25/2010,"Delicious, good food. Great service, clean environment, &warm smiles everywhere. The prices are not that bad since the portions are big. Don't forget to order a pizookie after your meal ! *drools."
Aman K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,33,,4.0,7/31/2013,"One of my favorite spots in SF to just eat, talk and enjoy the evening. Great menu with a lot varieties from food to dessert to drinks. Pazookie (dessert) is a must for me at this place. The only reason i am not giving 5 starts is because of the wait and slow service during the weekend."
Kat C.,"San Francisco, CA",773,630,2420,3.0,10/11/2008,"Dude, their happy hours last till 8ish on a weekday...balls!  Too bad it's not downtown... The food is decent - I'll be satisfied with the chili cheese fries, hot wings, a beer, and a salad (for balance)  Haven't had a pazookie in forevers BUT I do crave it after I've had a salty meal or around 12:43am on a drunken Saturday night after eating taco bell while on my way home.  It's kind of expensive...there's definately a list of other places I'd prefer to eat than BJ's.  Service is usually pretty good and the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time...man, it's just alright. I DO recommend the hot wings and a cold beer...can't go wrong, son!"
