Joanne G.,"San Francisco, CA",403,662,65,3.0,8/16/2008,"Who else goes for drinks at 11AM?  Uh, me.   Alright, so I've discovered that BJ's really isn't that bad- apparently it just took copious amounts of alcohol to finally warm up to this place.  I needed to kill some time before my very delayed flight at SFO and thus ended up at Tanforan and BJ's. Tried their beers for the first time- I had the Brewhouse Blonde, he had the Hefeweizen.  Not bad at all.  The super nice bartender gave me a decent sized tasting on the house, and she even brought out some silverware when I asked if it was alright for me to finish up my airport lunch! Three orange stars for the awesome bartender."
Jer W.,"San Bruno, CA",81,279,,4.0,9/22/2013,"My friend called me to join here at bj on 9-22-13 1pm'sh for the 49er game.  I was able to snag a table at the bar area in front of the large tv screen.  This waitress was courteous/patient, I told her my friends will be joining me shortly.  I ordered the hefeweizin pitcher $16.75 and a classic burger about $9'sh.  Surprisingly the food is good (of course the experienced cook was there). Afterwards, ordered 1 pint of bj hef for $4 (reasonable prices/good service).  My friend had to speak to the mgr several times regarding the 9er game (where's the volume, should be a bigger screen for our home team (he eventually listened to him and he hear the other customers complaining)."
Matt G.,"San Francisco, CA",2159,1911,3823,1.0,6/24/2006,"My wife found a piece of hair in her Mashed potatoes and my Meat-loaf was still icy in the inside.The Beer is ok, Beach Chalet brewery is better,according to my wife. We won't come here ever, I would go to Iraq then going to BJ Advisory warning Do not come here, if you want a good meal, eat at the food court in the Mall."
Susy C.,"San Francisco, CA",702,1723,1209,3.0,12/17/2006,"It's a chain. Sometimes the wait is long, sometimes it's not. Sometimes it's crowded and rowdy, sometimes it's still calm enough to hear your own thoughts.  Food is decent, the prices are okay for the quality you get. It gets the job done when i'm shopping and starving @ Tanforan so what the hey. All in all, this is one of those mediocre places when you've really got nowhere else to go and can't make up your mind when you're nearby so you come here. outdoor patio with heat lamps is awesome after you've knocked a few back... or if you're in the middle of a heat wave."
Vivienne M.,"San Francisco, CA",31,6,2,4.0,4/6/2010,I went out to BJs with my husband last night! It was a hit.. I had the Parmesan Crust Chicken while he had the Balsamic Chicken Dinner... I really enjoyed my meal. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. The wait time was pretty minimal for a Monday evening (30mins)... Do try the Pomegranate Margarita..(ask for extra lime to even out the sweetness)...it was really DELIISH!!! Thanks for a warm setting and an awesome-wholesome meal!
Olma M.,"South San Francisco, CA",295,395,704,3.0,11/15/2006,"The multimedia side of me can really like this place - I like knowing that, at any given time, I can take a quick peek around and find the latest sports score.  I found the atmosphere and food to be quite pleasing, too (not the place to go if you're especially particular about eating 'healthy,' but they do offer a veggie burger). So, if I'm at a brewery, I'm pretty much gonna have something deep fried.  We started off with the onion strings, despite my table mates' advice against it.  They'd experienced a soggy order twice before, but this one was just right and crispy.   As if that weren't enough fried food, I just had to have my Fish n' Chips w/malt vinegar.  It hit the spot, but the fish tasted a bit too 'processed' for my liking.  If this were based on this sole dish and specific outing, I'd probably give it two stars;  However, based on two other visits to this location, and experiencing other dishes myself and through other's taste buds, I'm bumping it up to the average 3 stars.   I've been told that once I try the dessert, I may bump it up to 4 stars...  Looking forward to that day."
Dave B.,"Pittsburg, CA",2,111,,2.0,10/22/2013,"It was OK for what it was.  Lots of carbs, plenty of fried foods, and plenty of noise in this restaurant. They tried to seat is us in the outside Mall area when there were plenty of seats inside the real restaurant. We sat inside.  We sent back their micro beer. It was nothing like a Guinness.  My wife drank part of hers.  We then ordered wine.  The service was good.  The place was clean.  I ate my food and felt guilty for consuming so many calories.  Is BJ's a chain from Texas?  It seemed like it could be."
Sarina I.,"San Francisco, CA",111,202,23,2.0,5/27/2010,"I'm very picky when it comes to yelping stuff. I usually try not to yelp places that so many people have yelped and also chain places that are really hard to yelp. Last night, me and a couple of friends headed to BJ's for some apps and drinks. Here's my experience: First off if I come up to the hostess/host table, it's because my party NEEDS a table, not because I'm admiring how it looks. Lady needed to get a clue, since she asked ""What I needed?"" mmm anyways. We were seated and given our menus. We ordered: Potato Skins, Calamari and the Mediterranean Pizza.  I'd pass on the calamari unless you enjoy LOTS and LOTS of PEPPER. Potato Skins were alright and the Pizza was tasty.  Service pretty much sucked. We had to ask for small plates a couple times. Our drinks were alright as well. The strawberry mojito tasted the best, I would get that again. Overall, this is a place I hardly ever eat at, unless someone is paying (which is why I went last night ;) but since I'm closer to the city, I'd def find another place to grab a bite to eat for cheaper price."
Justin G.,"San Mateo, CA",18,126,17,1.0,1/8/2013,The night started off okay even though we had a party of 8 and they wanted to break us up in 2 separate tables away from each other really OMG not cool I like to be together with family not separate I ordered the flatbread pizza without tomatoes then it came with tomatoes. We were there for my niece's birthday and I wanted to surprise her with a nice desert with a candle at the end of dinner and THE WAITER told me that they don't SING happy Birthday???????????????? (Some policy). they bring it while we were in the middle eating WOW WRONG not when she was eating her appetizer then they forgot our calamari which the waiter did not charge us this place is worse than Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo YOU ALL LOST A CUSTOMER
Judy C.,"San Francisco, CA",94,114,63,2.0,1/7/2013,"I came here several years back for a friend's birthday and we had to wait quite a while because we did not have reservations and had about 10 people. I ordered a Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and it was totally not worth it, it was $14 without tax. The fettuccini was pretty mediocre, no wow factor present at all. I wonder if it's because I've order the wrong dish and if there were other better dishes here? I don't know...Sadly I felt like I could have had the same dish for a cheaper price and better tasting elsewhere. I can't say I'd come back unless invited to come. Hopefully by then, I can figure out what there is to order correctly.."
Jun W.,"Daly City, CA",11,117,,4.0,2/14/2011,"Went there on Sat. with gf with a waiting time of about 30 minutes.  But the wait was well worth it.  Service was excellent, the waitress was very nice and friendly, and comes over to check if everything is ok every 10 minutes. We ordered spinach stuffed mushroom and ahi poke for appetizer and chicken masala for main dish for sharing. Taste was good, especially stuffed mushroom and quantity was about right, in addition to fair price.  Overall, worthy place for a weekend visit and will want to go back there in a few months again."
Robert Y.,"Sacramento, CA",40,836,15,3.0,1/2/2011,"surprisingly this was my first time going to this particular chain restaurant as Ive driven by several of these places during my time as a pharmacy student. Anywho, this place is basically a somewhat typical American restaurant that is supposedly known for their deep dish pizzas, selection of mixed drinks and ales. and their large cookie dessert. I tried their deep dish pizza and I was not impressed. Theres too much dough and seemed to lack enough sauce as it seemed dry. I didnt try anything else but my friends got the 1/2 lb burger and the Jambalaya which looked decent but not worth the price. I think Id rather go to oliver garden if I had a choice between chillis, sizzler etc. Not impressed but will give a second chance as its seems like a good place for birthdays and large groups."
Pat W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,11,,3.0,10/14/2013,A sportsbar w/ multiple TVs; jam packed on a Friday night. 35 min wait for table for 2. Ahi Tuna Salad: very good Hawaiian Mahi Mahi: cooked fine; but could have used a dressing or sauce for enhancing the flavor.  Had to use the side of extra salad dressing from the Tuna.  This helped.   Orange Twist cocktail: nice  Atmosphere: lively  Service: ok
Angie B.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,26,,1.0,3/30/2014,"I used to love BJs for the laid back atmosphere and the fact that I could take the kids and not worry that their talking would bother other guests. We used to be regulars until we went there a few months back and had a horrible experience. Since we come quite often I know what their food should taste like. Our pizza was somewhat burned and after feeding the kids a slice each, I realized it was off. I lifted the toppings and sure enough the top of the pizza dough was slightly burned. No big deal, asked our waitress for another and she was totally cool with it. She went and told her manager and that's when the horrible experience started. I believe his name was Tracy, middle aged guy seemed like he was tweaked out on something. He came over very aggressively and said ""so what's the problem with your pizza"". I said it was slightly burned and that we wanted another one that wasn't. He walked away almost like he was pissed off at us. My husband sensed it right away but I told him no way, that's probably his personality--he is a manager after all so there was no way he would treat a customer rudely. After maybe 15 mins our new pizza came out and was much better. Tracey came back and asked how our pizza was (and for that split second I thought, ok cool we were just trippin about his rudeness) and when we said much better he proceeded to say ""ok, it looks the same to me. Let me know if you need anything else"". Are you serious?! Why would I make  my starving kids wait for a whole new pizza when there was nothing wrong with it? I was NOT asking for a free one, I just wanted a non-burnt one that I was paying full price for. Total jerk, def on something. Sorry BJs but how do you hire people like that let alone make them managers?!  Will not be visiting ANY BJ restaurants because of this experience. Too bad, cuz we were pretty good customers."
Denise C.,"Pacifica, CA",3,51,,3.0,6/24/2011,"Came here with my boyfriend, The atmosphere was fun,The lighting is nice  too. This place kinda reminds me of Jillians/TGIF's. EXACTLy. It's more of a group, hanging out with friends place.  My boyfriend ordered a pasta w/chicken dish. I took a bite. It was decent but noithing special, I just orderd the seared ahi appetizer, $4.oo for 6 little pieces. It was ok, I had better. Oh..before i forget,,for dessert order the snickerbobblethinga majigger. Not sure how to say it but its a chocolate cookie still in its pan with ice cream om  top..........YUMMY!! Nice thing to share with your love monkey. Anywhoo,,,i would go back but it would not be my first choice. Love, D"
Jory S.,"San Francisco, CA",205,119,2,4.0,1/29/2011,"Great beers, great place to watch sports, food is pretty good.  If you're looking for mainstream american food with a couple of creative twists at very fair pricing- this is the place.   The staff is hit or miss- the gal who ran our food to our table nearly threw it down and grunted something as she ran away.  Our bartender was attentive and and upbeat though."
Heidi S.,"San Francisco, CA",8,191,2,3.0,11/7/2010,"Every time we come here, there's always something very specific from the menu we have in mind. Baked potatoes, the blackened chicken pasta, jambalaya, wedge salad or the Berry Burst Cider.  The wait is atrocious, any time after 6:30, plan on waiting an hour and a half easily. Plan on having to come back after 20 minutes to get your pager. Plan on them not actually having one ready. There's a lot of planning that has to take place. It's a shame that Tanforan doesn't have more exciting mall type shops that make waiting forever worth it. Cheap, super trendy shops just don't have anything to offer me and sitting in Barnes & Noble browsing books for extended periods of time is fairly dangerous.  On our last visit, we noticed that they added another aisle to the dining floor and as a result have probably 16 more booths for parties of 2. Sadly, this didn't have an affect on the wait.  The wait staff is really hit or miss. Sometimes you get 3 water refills, sometimes you're left high and dry no matter how many times you ask for more.  They have a decent menu and great drinks (except that literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I have ordered a Mojito they have been out of mint!)."
Lorianne L.,"Daly City, CA",56,3,,4.0,8/6/2014,This is my favorite franchised restaurants. I've tried mostly everything on their menu and it's all good unless they added new stuff. The service is always good here when I come so no problem for me. Pizza is awesome and the dessert here never fails your appetite.
Peter T.,"San Diego, CA",302,835,382,5.0,8/18/2008,"i come here with co-workers maybe once or twice a month and are considered valued patrons by the bar-staff. Just as any ""regulars"" at a bar, we expect excellent service and have never received anything less.  Every food item i have tried was pretty solid, i just tried the California something rather sandwhich on grilled sourdough tonight and it was delectable. Roasted green chili's, pepper jack, chicken, chipotle mayo, what more could you ask for? Drinks are also poured and served well. Johnny black + the nit wit are my favs.  This particular location tends to get a bit busy so i suggest attending with an open and flexible mind. It is well worth it!"
Tiffany S.,"San Francisco, CA",212,277,70,2.0,4/19/2012,first time having drinks at BJ's!  had a taste of their blonde ale and it was okay. Not terrible but not memorable either.
