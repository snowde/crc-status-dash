D M.,"Vallejo, CA",232,20,11,1.0,12/17/2009,"This review has nothing to do with in-restaurant service. This review is for service over the phone. I called this morning to ask when was happy hour and what were the deals for that time. The person I spoke to was able to answer my first question, "" 3 to 7."" So no big deal. Great, he answered my question. But when I asked him what the deals that went on during happy hour. The only thing he could say was, ""I'm not really sure."" Then there was this awkward silence. I thought, ""seriously, you can't ask someone. WTF."" Then he ask, ""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" I said no. I was shocked by the whole thing. It's one thing you don't know the answer to something, but to not even try to find the answer was inappropriate in this setting."
Andrew Y.,"San Francisco, CA",179,1352,,2.0,4/20/2010,"We showed up at around 9:15PM on Saturday night. It was busy...but how busy, we did not actually know. Before we walked in, there was a flood of people leaving presumably watching the Giants game. However, when we got in, we were told the wait was going to be about 45mins to an hour. So we were okay with that since we were waiting for some friends, but then our friends showed up about 30 mins later. This was fine, but then as 1 hour approached, suddenly our time was pushed another 30-45mins. Needless to say, we were not all thinking happy thoughts. After a while, we began taking over seating as they became free within the bar area. It did get to the point where we were all pretty much seated and ordering.  Here's the sad part, we ended up getting seated at a table for 12 (which we needed), but 2 of our guests had already left because it was too late. And as we walked to our tables, we noticed a slew of empty tables next to the table we were going to be seated at.  Anyway, we decided we'd waited this long and we went ahead an ordered. Though we were left hanging out for almost 2 hours, we made the best of it. I'm pretty sure had we sat earlier we would have spent more. I guess there isn't strength in numbers.  Other BJ's locations I've been to, all good. Especially the one in San Mateo."
Anthony P.,"Daly City, CA",12,35,,4.0,2/22/2010,"Luv the happy hour. The beer was good, but really luv the $5 whiskey on the rocks. I came out with my girl and her co-workers and friends. We had a great time parlay and drinking.  Looking forward to try the dessert next time. Luv the deep-dish pizzas and the wedges."
MJ R.,"Miami, FL",3,90,,1.0,12/23/2009,-1 stars for watered down drink -1 stars for cold wings -1 stars for undercooked wings -1 stars cuz now im SICK AS A DOG the next day I'm done w/ BJ's.
Lina W.,"San Francisco, CA",27,42,,3.0,11/27/2010,"Is it just me, or does BJ remind you of a Cheesecake Factory or a Grand Lux Cafe??  Anyways, I'm usually not a big fan of these chain restaurants with their overwhelming menu, but BJ is great when you want to catch any sports game on one of their many TVs. In fact, if they're not showing it, they will offer to change the channel for you. Their customer service is excellent. I would give them 5 stars on just their service alone (but had to take away a star for their pizookie... so sweet it'll make your teeth hurt!) I came here the past 2 weeks and enjoyed the BBQ pork sliders and artichoke + spinach dip. Both were great! (I don't know why I said I don't like these chain restaurants... food was good!)"
Emily G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,,4.0,10/13/2014,Celebrated my husband's 30th Birthday here. It was a great evening. It was loud and busy as I expected because of the post season Giants game. I reserved a table so we did not have to wait. The server was great. Very helpful and attentive. Our food was very good. I ordered the pares an chicken. With garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. My husband ordered a steak. It came out perfect. We had a large party and 3 kids with us and you could tell they were busy but they still brought out great food and overall it was good. The only negative would be the kids macaroni and cheese. Looked and tasted like kraft. That was a disapointment. But other than that it was a great evening with great food and great service!
Scott C.,"San Francisco, CA",41,23,4,3.0,12/19/2010,"I go here A LOT the food is okay prices are a bit high, service usually sucks but I keep going back so it cant be terrible ;) The one waitress Jazz or Jazzy or whatever her name is, is awesome and a great server and not to mention cute  :)    had her twice and she was the best server there by far."
Teresa S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,5,2,2.0,1/23/2013,"Deja vu - once again, in less than 2 weeks, they messed up our pizza order. Once again, a manager, Spencer, offered to take care of  the bill - as he said, ""it's the least we could do..."" Do I dare return?"
Jon C.,"Daly City, CA",0,8,1,1.0,9/6/2014,9-6-2014 the service has been much better in the past. It has gone down hill! The waiters seem like they could care less the food is ok! I will not return. I will go to the. Cheese Cake Factory instead for better food and service for our party of six!
Fifteen F.,"San Francisco, CA",4,26,3,2.0,1/20/2010,Ok food for above average prices.  I hate the clientele there though. And the bartender chick likes to show off her tramp stamp.  Word.
Frankie L.,"San Francisco, CA",29,82,1,3.0,4/8/2010,OK food. OK service. OK beer. OK environment. Not so OK wait time. Very average with a couple of goodies on the menu. The pizzas are pretty good and the portions are huge. I just hate waiting forever for a table. The service there is a bit slow for my likings ... 3 stars A-OK
Josie W.,"San Francisco, CA",14,129,88,4.0,9/23/2010,"I love the chain restaurant BJ's. Last time the server was horrible!! The food was delicious though. Very good. Decor, atmosphere was nice. Since we were there for happy hour and we were just chatting and having a blast, we didn't really notice the horrible service.  However, upon evaluation again on the service, it was bad. So 4 stars for the initial experience there, but that could have been because of the good company of my friends. We had to flag the waiter or even other waiters down for any type of service. He seemed distracted and non-alert to our actual table.  The food: The pizzas were deceivingly small yet very filling. The Apple Crisp had to be shared. It was too big for me, but very yummy."
Lina L.,"Alhambra, CA",217,157,152,4.0,8/18/2010,Luckily BJ's was only like a 2minute walk from Speedee--while we waited for the car to be done we went to grab some lunch.  all the BJ's look actually the same to me. Enjoyed being there no wait & the services were faster than Speedee that's for sure!
James R.,"Redwood City, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/22/2010,"Food Sucks, Beer sucks and the service really sucks !!!!   This happened few weeks back. First they told me that's there's a hour wait then couple of hours later we were still waiting. I noticed that the people working in the front were letting there friends get in first and so I questioned them about that and they strictly denied it. I ask the lady in the front to show me the persons name on the list  that just walked  in and sat down immediately and she cannot prove it. Instead she made up this lie that they called few hours ago. I noticed few of the customers were losing patience. I remember this lady was so pissed off that she left and the people working at the front were mimicking her and they started laughing. Very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you want poor service. Go to Beach Chalet instead."
Miss Cristina O.,"Pacifica, CA",120,60,15,3.0,10/26/2011,"Food was good.  The servers have been trained well on how to handle change of shifts.   They take a little bit longer to check on your beverage, but they are overall nice people."
Kristen S.,"San Francisco, CA",546,907,495,3.0,1/22/2008,"Your typical burger joint.  Choices in San Bruno are limited.... otherwise I can't think of a single reason to go to BJ's.   I have to say, though, that their chunky seasoned fries are really, really good.  Pure satisfaction in each and every one of them.  For that alone they deserve an extra star.   But then again, that's also a reason to NOT go there."
Stephy K.,"Pacifica, CA",9,15,4,5.0,12/22/2009,"This is one of my favorite restaurants! BJs is great for casual dinning,party's (for a great price), and take out! If  its a busy day (mostly it is) then they would walk around and serve you samples while you wait sitting down. Its a very friendly  environment and fancy! Also the food is delicious and at a pretty good price. i HIGHLY recommend it."
Clarence A.,"Daly City, CA",496,1000,1995,3.0,1/7/2010,"interesting I swear I wrote about this place already.. oh well, at BJ's go for the snakebites at bar if not try the sampler of beers they have on tap, food wise chicken wings always good here, chicken fried steak is sometimes good sometimes not so good, meatloaf not very good, 5 friggin stars for the poozookie haha so to review chicken wings and huge cookie haha waiters are ok when they first opened and you ordered over the phone and came to pick it up at the designated time you would have to add an extra 30min nowadays they have kinda worked that kink out at most now you wait 5 min for a phone order.  Place is roomy with several tv's with majority of all the local sports teams playing if not recapping at the bar they got a huge if I remember correctly 4 or 6 tvs that are connected together to make one big screen depending on the game that is play they have one big picture or 4 or 6 several different games on they do got a happy hour = | food *** so so chicken wangs is 4 solid stars poozookie is 5 solid stars service *** phone orders sometimes on point sometime they lose your order, in house friendly and they try to never have your cup of water or cup of beer ever hit bottom they TRY!!! price $$ during happy hour food prices are decent regular hours though not so great but it is good food kinda haha ambiance **** super spacious, in a mall (blah), alot of TV's always good crowds of folks hit up this place newly familys, business meetings, blue collars, biotech employees, college folks, etc usually at the bar haha again to drink they make decent snakebites, to eat chicken wangs, dessert poozookie!!! haha"
Scott J.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",5,39,,3.0,2/2/2013,Overpriced and overloud but delicious nonetheless.  The beers are definitely worth a try.  Wait staff were highly efficient though changed 3 times in the course of the meal.
Lance O.,"Castro, San Francisco, CA",0,4,3,3.0,1/31/2013,"This is probably the 3rd time I've ever ate at BJ's and the stars are due to the first 2 times I've never had a problem. However this time around was ridiculous and not what I expect from a pretty known restaurant. I went with a group of people for a birthday and it all started when they tried seating us at a booth that didn't have enough seating for the whole group. Not only did the time we finally sat down, take our order and receive our food last nearly an hour, they lost someone's order. A burger to be exact which he wanted well done. Apologies were given and they said ""the burger was overcooked"" and they'll bring another, stat. When it did arrive, boom. Medium rare. Really, I don't ever remember food ever being wrong, or burnt like my friends  bruschetta, or a pizookie taking 20 minutes to make. Sorry to say but it was less than amusing."
