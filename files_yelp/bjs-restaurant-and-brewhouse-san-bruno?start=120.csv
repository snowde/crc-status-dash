Steven Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,1,1.0,12/7/2017,"I've only come here maybe a handful of times, 4 or 5 in total. Yet, somehow even though each visit is so widely spread, i always have a terrible experience. Mostly due to the staff, i won't comment on the food as i eat pretty strictly at home. The wait to get seated is as expected during peak hours but oh my goodness, the staff. They obviously all hate their job and it shows. My most recent visit, it took 20 minutes just for our server to come greet us after we had been seated. On top of that, another 15 minutes just to get the waters we asked her for. I hate this place and always tell people there are way better options. Only time this is a choice is when it's late and they're the only place open. Don't bother if you can help it, otherwise just go grab a beer at the bar and you should be good."
Taylor D.,"Escalon, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/11/2017,"Such an uncomfortable experience. Our waiter Jimmy I believe his name was, with a ""man bun"" hair style was awful. Took about 10 mins to even be acknowledged, another 10 for our waters, and over 45min for our cold food, with no apology. Had to get up find the waiter and remind him for items we had asked for. Such a bad experience, just felt trapped, wanting to leave. Staff needs help."
Hema S.,"Hayward, CA",187,13,,1.0,12/6/2017,"The worst customer service! waited 45 mins and nothing.  very pissed off, and annoyed. i just wanted pasta and a few drinks. but the worst customer service ive ever experienced. never again will i spend a dime in that crap hole"
Raneen S.,"Burlingame, CA",213,4,3,1.0,8/4/2017,"the only thing i'd give this place 100% is 100% no stars if i could. BJ's has the worst service i've ever experienced in my life. my family and i decided to come here for dinner wednesday night despite the fact that we've had multiple crappy experiences with them before. we thought to give them the benefit of the doubt-- not worth it.  we were seated around 9pm and ordered our drinks and food all at the same time because we didn't want to eat too late. we ordered an appetizer, a flatbread, salads, and soup... easy and quick meals to prepare. our appetizer came out fairly quickly, which was nice. but then everything went downhill from there. our waitress went MIA, we were waiting for an HOUR for our food, no one came by to update us or check on us, we began questioning where our waitress even was because we didn't see her walking around or tending to other tables. finally, we asked another waiter to find our waitress and when he came back he said she ""is looking for our food"" to which i asked, ""what do you mean looking for our food? do you put it any place other than the kitchen??? is it lost?"" like how does that make sense? so the manager comes out and tells us for some reason our food was just sitting at the counter the whole time and no one came to bring it to us and didn't want to serve us ""lukewarm food"" aka cold AF food and said they're remaking it. she offered to bring us out food that ""could be made instantly, like soup"" which is what we ordered an hour ago... so we told her no thank you and we got up and left. she comped us for everything, as she should've.  never coming back here again. BJ's was great when they first opened and now it's just trash. don't waste your time here."
Robin Z.,"City of Industry, CA",77,5,,1.0,9/21/2017,"Don't go here. Workers are rude. They told us they'd give our table away, literally one second after they told us it was ready. The restaurant wasn't event busy."
Destiny S.,"Sacramento, CA",23,2,,4.0,1/2/2018,"I don't know why this place is rated so poorly but for our visit here we received great service. My husband and I had just got married and we made reservation for a dinner party of 40+ prior to the wedding day. I called on the day of to confirm our reservation and they had us down and ready to go. We my guest start to arrive they began seating them and by the time my husband and I got there everyone was happily receiving their orders and eating. The only problem we had was with one waiter who took one of our guest order wrong and long story short was not being very corporative. We let the manager know and he helped us to have a better evening in the end. Everyone in our party had a great time and enjoyed the night. So if your looking to have a small or large party make sure you make reservations ahead if time and be very clear with them, then always confirm the day of to make sure. Bottom line is it wasn't all that bad."
haze a.,"Daly City, CA",101,10,2,3.0,2/22/2017,"Overall, my family had a typical ""dine at a restaurant chain"" experience. When we arrived we were told it was a 20-25 minute wait, which did not bother us. We were actually happy that they take down our phone number so they could text you when your table is ready.  Our waiter was courteous, but we could tell he hated his job. He forgot my daughter's order (because he didn't write it down) and didn't give us utensils until 10 min after we were served our food. Sad to say this is typical for restaurants in malls, don't expect warm and happy people working here lol."
Jessica S.,"San Francisco, CA",183,199,143,4.0,2/15/2016,"I only really come here when I'm craving pizza. I always get the deep dish pizza to share with someone, and usually the calamari. I also always get the pizza half and half-yummy. I love both dishes. I've occasionally tried other dishes like the ribs which were tasty as well. The only downside here is the service. It's super slow, don't expect to see your waiter again after they drop off the food or to refill your drinks. You have to really flag someone down"
Henry L.,"San Mateo, CA",2336,833,2811,3.0,1/15/2016,"The wait here is crazy long! Gotta get here early. The inside is decorated pretty well. The staff are young--not exactly experts in what they do, but pretty nice people. The food prices are ok, and the portions are huge. Especially the starter  combo--that was a lot of nachos. Overall, a good place to hang out and chill with friends."
Margaret H.,"Pacifica, CA",0,1,,3.0,12/1/2017,"Food was good, beer was good, service was excellent. However, when we walked in we spent time waiting in what turned out to be the take-out line rather than the waiting to be seated line BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SIGNS ON EITHER OF THEM! No staff paid any attention to the line and when we finally got someone's attention to ask where we should be, people behind us in the wrong line jumped in front of us in the correct line. So frustrating. Fix this BJ's!"
Hoa T.,"San Francisco, CA",5,111,30,1.0,3/5/2017,"Me and my family came here last night and it was the worst experience ever and the food was disgusting. waiter- worse we probably told her five different times for extra sauce and she kept coming back refill but not our sauce. ( if you don't remeber write it on a piece a paper geez!) food- we waited probably like 50 min, that is a long time and when it arrive it was so cold and we sent back. They made it again and it was disgusting. Their food went downhill,  i dont remeber the food tasting this horrible. even though manager didnt make us pay for the appetizer or the dessert, i would not come back not worth the wait or the food."
Dominguez J.,"South San Francisco, CA",36,29,44,1.0,10/28/2016,"Was quick to get seating. Took 15min just to get water. Food was not appetizing so didn't even eat much. Service was slow. Wouldn't want to come back, rather go to the Hillsdale mall location. Update. Getting a seat was fast tonight 10-26-16 but took 45 minutes to get our food!! Never again. I'm all done with second chances. This place isn't worth the time and the food was bland. Better off at red Robbin or jacks across the street."
Holly D.,"Apex, NC",224,4,,1.0,10/1/2017,"So sad! Love their food but my husband and I went there last night only to have every single order, including iced tea, completely messed up. I'm a vegetarian and ordered a veggie burger, when I bit into it, there was bacon on the burger! I was appalled. Everyone in our section's orders were also messed up as well as the table next to us having to wait 45 minutes for their check. We decided to leave because we couldn't take it anymore. The manager was very nice and comped our check as we left after an hour and 30 minutes, hungry. Not an idea Saturday at 3pm lol. Never going back."
Mercedes L.,"Anaheim, CA",15,68,,1.0,9/3/2017,"One star is far too generous. Incredibly disappointing as I love BJ's but this location is in need of some work. The server forgot about our food (actually questioned out loud if he even had put the order in), didn't bother apologizing when he did finally get around to bringing out our appetizer and by then the chips and spinach dip were cold. He disappeared, not bothering to check on us. Then another server came out with a 2nd spinach dip which was supposed to be ours...not sure where our server got the first one. The table sat after us got their food first and when our pizza finally came arrived it was mildly warm like it may have been sitting out. Though the manager was nice when we discussed this with her, I wouldn't return."
Camille F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,2,3.0,7/7/2017,"I've been coming here since they first opened! Every time I come, the ladies restroom are filthy. I had to check three stalls for toilet paper!! Not good, especially if you have a bar! I mentioned it to the manager the last time I came, and he said he would look into it and apologized! Very unsanitary. Do better BJ's"
Benjamin T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,,2.0,11/28/2017,"Like a recent previous customer (Raffy), I too came back to BJ's after a considerable time away.  (Drove over from SF to purchase a stove from Sears... and walk the mall again for ole times sake.)  Years ago, my wife's family and ours had a regular routine around dining at BJ's while shopping in the area.  Food was consistently good at that time; ditto the service. Tonight, unfortunately, was something of a slight disappointment.  Our waitress was cordial and attentive but also seemingly in a hurry for us to place our order.  (A beautifully illustrated, dissertation-length menu takes a wee bit of time to read.)  Our food took way too long to arrive.  I think there was a distinct shortage of staff for the number of customers in attendance.  My wife's sweet potato fries were cold and mushy in texture.  Her pulled pork burger did not have the advertised SHREDDED pulled pork quality.  Rather, the meat came in the form of large chunks.  Another relative and I both ordered soups: these had the right taste but were luke warm instead of piping hot.  His avocado roll and my California flatbread appetitzers were just spot on fine.  Anyway, we'd really like to a return trip sometime soon, just becuz the fine dining experiences at BJ's of yesteryear are still alive and vibrant in our memory cells.  :)"
Nyla K.,"San Francisco, CA",596,330,338,3.0,1/9/2017,Ordered beer and potato skins during happy hour.  The potato skins were just blehhh... not great.  Glad it was on happy hour cause I would be mad if I paid full price for it.  It was clean and not dirty like other people are saying.  There's free wifi.  Staff was friendly... I'd give it another go and try a different starter.
Marty J.,"San Francisco, CA",194,433,398,1.0,7/30/2016,"No surprise that this place has a 2.5 star average rating. The food can be OK. Anytime I go in here, it's always a long wait. For what? There's nothing special about this place. The best item they have is the dessert pizooki, but so does Elephant Bar and it's a much better experience. I had to write this review because my wife convinced me to do DoorDash and get it delivered. They forgot to put the Bison burger in the bag so the dasher had to go back and pick it up. When they got back there were no fries with it. Come on, what a waste of time and money. Instead of going here, go to Red Robin in San Bruno. Same type of food, just better and not much of a wait."
Kirstie P.,"Daly City, CA",422,92,1242,3.0,5/30/2016,"#75 I used to come here a lot before they decided to break my heart and take the BJ's brownie off of their menu. Unlike most people, Im not really into pizookies. I just think its way too sweet for me.  Alcoholic beverages aren't strong enough. I usually ask them to remake it. Service is always slow whether or not you're in a big party. The only reason why I still come here is because their food is consistent. For the past 5+ years, I've always ordered the same thing: Parmesan crusted chicken, avocado egg rolls, and their brownie before they stopped making it. Prices and menus have changed over the years but these dishes remain constant.  Recently I decided to finally try something new, so I ordered their deep dish ravioli. It tasted like a gourmet Hot Pocket but expensive. Not worth it.  I like the concept of their rewards program but last I checked, you couldn't give them your phone number and you had to bring your rewards card with you every time. That makes it difficult to accumulate points."
Lawrence L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,47,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Been here many times for years... never have been so disappointed. After waiting 1/2 hour for our very simple order of turkey burgers and baked ziti, we finally got served but had to ask and wait another 10 minutes for our silverware and napkins. The waiter asked if we wanted a ice-tea refill, but after another 10 minutes, we decided to just leave and asked for the check.  Well, he decided to bring us someone else's check for $130 and ran off.  After chasing him down and getting our correct check, we couldn't leave soon enough.  Was it busy? partially up front, but where they sat us in the back, it was less than 1/2 full.  Were we not served because we were Asian, or some of us were elderly? In addition, the floor leading to our table in the back was extremely slippery... were surprised that no one fell while we were there.  Also, the Men's room was disgusting as they obviously had not cleaned it since who knows when.  Don't know what has happened to this establishment, but it has gone WAY down recently."
