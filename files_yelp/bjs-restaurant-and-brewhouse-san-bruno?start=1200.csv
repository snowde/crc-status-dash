Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",281,247,83,1.0,8/17/2010,"I came here last weekend for my cousin's birthday dinner. What a disaster. We waited around 30 minutes for a table of 7 around 9:30. We got seated and decided what we wanted. Ordered our food, and waited. For some reason, it took REALLY long for our food to come, but it did arrive, but where were our appetizers? We asked our waiter where our appetizers were, and he said another waiter took our appetizers to the wrong table so then he canceled our order. And you tell us this NOW?! Then our waiter said he can make another order for appetizers, but we told him it was fine and that we could just eat our dinner instead. So the waiter gave us our dinner, but my friends got a mini pizza instead of a medium pizza like they ordered. Our waiter then said that he heard mini instead of medium, and that he was sorry so he gave us the mini pizza on the house. That was a kind gesture, but that was two mess ups already. I got the BJ's favorite pizza, and it wasn't that bad. I DID want to try the Avocado Egg Rolls, but the silly waiter had to bring it to another table... Ergh. The waiter apologized to us plenty of times and gave us 2 birthday pizookies instead of 1. This place has got to have the worst customer service, EVER. Never again am I coming back here, unless it's for a special occasion."
Jeanine J.,"San Francisco, CA",9,10,,2.0,3/14/2011,"Expensive: $25 for a sandwich and salad. Turkey sandwich and Ceasar salad were fine but defintely no wow factor. Service is weird: overly friendly staff and what seems like tons of people working there. Everyone is working the upsell to the point of overkill. I ordered take-out and even though there were three people at the take-out counter (seperate from the hostess stand) I had to check-in on on my order a half hour after I placed it because no one bothered to let me know it was ready. Seems like a case of a good chain gone bad - too many people with specific siloed jobs and not enough cohesion or love put into the food to make it a memorable experience. I blame the management at this particular location, and while I won't return to San Bruno, I may give another location another shot."
Alfonso D.,"South San Francisco, CA",2,21,2,2.0,9/14/2012,pretty good beer for all tastes and i love the avocado rolls. The entrees have never really impressed me though. Sometimes simple is better and I feel like they over do it with the presentations and not enough attention to the flavor.
Miss H.,"San Francisco, CA",262,324,262,4.0,4/13/2008,"This is the way to do it: Avocado eggrolls. BJ's favorite. Pitcher of Hef. Chocolate chunk pizookie. I did an eating & exercise log this weekend for a class assignment and I felt sick to my stomach when I realized my dinner was already 1100+ calories... and that was only pizza & beer. BUT!!!! that's ok because since you usually have to wait for a table, you can go ""exercise"" around the mall! Walking from store to store, carrying items, and trying on clothes is a workout."
crystal e.,"Daly City, CA",23,135,,3.0,1/2/2010,"Best time to go is during their Happy Hour M-Th: 3-7, 10-close and on Sundays from 10-close. Happy hour specials include have off mini deep dish pizzas at $5 each, $2 off appetizers and $1 off draft beers. If their pints of beer were cheaper, I'd come here for happy hour more often. If you have a group, pitchers are the way to go! Best choice appetizers: Chicken wings, hot artichoke spinach dip and avocado egg rolls Best dessert: Pazookies and BJ's Brownie Best Dinner Choices: Pastas, Pizzas and Sandwiches"
Edgar G.,"San Francisco, CA",220,404,9,1.0,10/12/2013,"I've dined at this BJ's many times for the past 7 years, but tonight was the worst experience ever. First, it took about 10 minutes for our waiter to introduce us, and by that time we were already ready to order out entree. In addition, we ordered two appetizers and he promised they would come out before our entree, but isn't that normally how it works? We waited another 15-20 minutes and for some odd reason our entrees came out before our appetizer. Our waiter also didn't notify us that he was going on break, so I informed his replacement about our appetizers. He made sure to double check on our order but it never came. We asked to cancel one but to bring out the chips and salsa since its easier to make and it would've taken another 20 minutes to make the mushroom spinach appetizer. I finished my entree before the appetizer even came out, so that frustrated me. The waiter told us it was coming and by that time I just wanted my check. I asked for the manager but he never came out. Was he that ashamed of his employees to not speak to a customer about their poor customer service? I don't know but I know he wasn't busy and was dodging my table. All I wanted to tell him was how disappointed I was with my dinner and that I've never had a bad experience prior. All in all, the manager really showed me what this BJ franchise is really about. I will never step foot in this particular BJ's again. The least the manager could have done was come over and apologize, comp our meal and wish we would come dine again."
Emily L.,"San Bruno, CA",0,5,,2.0,9/5/2014,"The service needs to be improved. One of our 3 meals was completely wrong, Im allergic to yellow cheese so i asked for white cheese and friend jalapenos on my burger.The waitress never came to check on us until we were almost done. Some busser sent our food back, the burger came back with yellow cheese still melted all on the sides and soggy half friend jalapenos. Whatever i can deal.. The waitress shows up to refill my water glass, with no ice, So I asked for ice and she came back with a huge glass full of ice slammed it on the table with the biggest attitude. After waiting for over 30 min for our check,still no sign of our waitress so I went to track her down. Only could find the hostess, who sent a new person with out check. We were on the patio because we had a dog, after we had our bill and were getting ready to leave, the waitress brought out a small bowl of water for our dog. WTF!! why would you wait till we are leaving. The umbrellas were also set up, but the wind was blowing like crazy, there were more then a few times my fiance had to catch the umbrella from falling on our table or hitting one of us in the head!! I'm very disappointed with this service, especially since it was so expensive. Seems that the staff needs some more training on customer service and listening to the customer."
Biemme B.,"San Francisco, CA",1,115,5,2.0,8/23/2012,"Meh. This place totally lacks the food presentation and the quality is just ok. My Thai salad was surprisingly very small ( although the plate where it's served is huge optical illusion ). The small 5 pieces of chicken in it where dried, very cold and chewy...not good. The dressing was lacking too and so the rest of the ingredients. My daughter Mac and cheese came in a huge big portion but the presentation was not appealing. You could tell that they didn't put any effort in mixing the Kraft cheese powdered with the macaroni. There were chunks of pasta attached together. Overall the kids menu' was a good value for money. The service here is great, too bad that the food presentation/ quality is lacking."
Alicia R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,2,1.0,8/29/2015,"I don't expect much from people who work at restaurants. I used to work in one so I know it's tiring. However the service here is probably the worse I've ever seen. I took my mom here for lunch during a week day and we got seated pretty quickly. The host said Mark or Matt or something would be our server,  we waited for about 15 min for him to at least ask if we wanted something to drink but instead he went to a table that got seated ten minutes after us. I made eye contact and said ""excuse me"" where he then LOOKED AT ME AND THEN LOOKED AWAY. I waited for him to finish taking their order but instead of coming over to us, he left. WOW!! I can understand if it was a busy day, but it wasn't, I can understand if it was loud and he didn't hear me....but it wasn't. Like I said I dont expect much , I just expect them to do their jobs. So we walked out and went to five guys in the food court and got ten times better service than both times I've been to BJ's."
Emily L.,"San Francisco, CA",129,276,119,4.0,1/26/2010,"This place is Great!!!! Doesn't take forever to get seated and the Bar-ish food is good too. I had their Oreo Ice cream trio and it was AMAZING!! Highly recommend it!! We went there @ 11PM and they were still open. EZ parking, good food! will definitely go back!"
Stacey D.,"Mesa, AZ",367,206,85,2.0,3/1/2012,"Hey bartender...my AZ ID is not fake...and I can hear you as you stand in front of me questioning if you should get a manager or if passports are easy to fake. What a horrible way to start my dining experience. Ever hear of whispering or going somewhere else to have your incompetent discussion? Tact is not everyone's strong suit.  Food was just ok - lettuce wraps are decent.  I asked for more peanut sauce, but it never came.  I sat that the bar since it was just myself, but think I would have got better service in the dining area.  Not going back any time soon..."
Rachel A.,"San Francisco, CA",132,487,14,3.0,5/16/2010,"The food isn't anything to rave about...except...of course...the PIZOOKIES!!! Those things are to die for. Anyways, we had a pretty ridiculous experience tonight. The waiters knocked over our water glasses, spilling water all over us and our table, TWICE in one night! It wasn't the end of the world, it's just water, but I just couldn't believe it happened twice. And then after they knocked water on my friend, she very politely asked for a refill...which they totally forgot about. HOWEVER, the managers were really wonderful to us. Most of our food and drinks were comped, and they continued to stop by our table every 10 minutes or so just to apologize and ask how we were doing. I liked that they cared enough about our business to take the time, especially on a very crowded Saturday night (and we hadn't even spent that much money).  Also, the Call-ahead service is amazing! You can just call them, ask about the wait, and have your name added to the list. We checked in when we got there and only waited 10 minutes! The best thing is the Barnes & Noble, because you can just browse the store while you wait.  I didn't love getting cold water dumped on me, but the managing staff and the pizookies saved the day."
Sanfranlifer B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,4.0,11/9/2011,"A fun place to watch the football games. A lot of TVs around the bar and restaurant. Beer sampler is not your average beer sampler, no short shot glasses here! Had the Pumpkin Ale on my most recent visit, very good! I agree with other posters about the inconsistent service and long waits which is why I gave it 4 stars."
Sami R.,"San Francisco, CA",8,170,,3.0,9/14/2010,"This place is okay, and an odd choice for our 100th review (woot!). The franchise is about on par with Applebee's (or a slight, slight cut above depending on who you ask), although this will depend on what you order as our experience relates. We ordered two pasta dishes, one was good with a hint of spice. A little different than what one would expect from spaghetti, but quite good all the same. The other dish, a cheese pasta, was very bland though. Not a lot of flavor, and something that we wouldn't recommend to anyone. All in all, this chain is okay, and this location is a decent one to try. We might hit up another place in the chain at some point, but won't be craving to do so."
Gigi K.,"San Francisco, CA",1,36,1,1.0,9/14/2014,"Everything about this place is awful, the staff, the food,,,,,everything!! Worst dining experience of the last 15 years maybe ever....stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Melinda J.,"South San Francisco, CA",16,21,1,4.0,1/12/2013,This is my go-to restaurant every time someone comes to visit.  It is consistently tasty and the service is good.  It is best to call ahead and get put on the waiting list though because the wait time here seems to always be about an hour.   My husband loves the Black & Blue burger as well as the burger pizza. I love the wedge salad and the jalapeno burger.
C K.,"Alameda, CA",1,10,,1.0,3/15/2013,"This place used to be ok. Maybe better than that. But we went by for a quick meal on March 11th about 4:00 PM and the place was a mess. We were served in the bar (the greeter said there were no tables for three but we could see them empty) . Our waiter  seemed to be the only one there and was running ragged. It also seemed to be end of shift . The manager should know better than to run a place like that. We ordered simple food. Chili for my wife and pizza for me. How could it be easier. Just get chili from a pot. I got my pizza after a while and luckily shared with my wife. Three quarters of an hour and several ""I am sorry"" stories from William M, we cancelled the pizza. No explanation. No nothing. Drinks were late too. I am not sure what was going on but do not go there execpt if you want to drink. And sit at the bar where you can grab the bartender. Food service was impossible. They need waiters and cooks--this is a big place. And then there were the bathrooms. They needed to issue wading boots to get to the urinals. The dirty paper towels were piled about a three feet high near the sink. And my wife said the womens was a mess too. So I do not know what happened to my old standby for quick food. But I gotta kiss you off after this. And I cannot put zero stars--I tried."
Melody T.,"San Francisco, CA",180,772,135,4.0,9/5/2009,I'm a big fan of this place.  Went there all the time in SD during college and was stoked to see when it first started popping up in the bay area.  Can never go wrong with the bbq chicken pizza or that balsamic chicken w/mashed potatoes...and pizookie for dessert of course.  Also love that they have wild berry cider - perfect bar drink with some happy hour pizzas.
Ron M.,"Burlingame, CA",78,17,40,2.0,6/27/2011,"So today we had the worst service that we've ever had in any restaurant.  1st and for most, Our waitress did not smile once when she greeted our table. I thought ""what ever, let it go"". 2nd her opening line was a couple of questions, that she didn't let us even answer, and an offer of an item then another question that she really cared less to hear the answer of once again.  3rd she never asked how our appetizer was. All in all we had the worst service from a waitress named Mariana. She didn't care we that we were there. She was an order taker. I don't normally tip bad but she earned her lack of a tip she received.  Hopefully, for her sake, financially, she was just having a bad day.  Being in the trade, being welcoming and personable pays off. The service here really needs to step up there game."
Hideo M.,"San Jose, CA",83,110,56,1.0,5/31/2012,"The food quite bad and I'm pretty happy that my customer didn't show up to my lunch meeting. Had lunch portion Salmon with vegetables. Salmon was overcooked but thank goodness not as bad as the veggies, or should I say Squash. The squash was overcooked so badly, I felt like I was eating baby food, Mush... Next time, I'm only having beer..."
