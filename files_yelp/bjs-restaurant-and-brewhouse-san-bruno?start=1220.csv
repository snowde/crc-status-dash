Kevin L.,"San Francisco, CA",79,15,3,3.0,7/16/2009,"I'll keep this short and simple!   The GOOD -Cool place for friends to hang out. -It's a brewery -Ample parking -Open reasonably late The Bad -The wait time to get a table is pretty hefty most of the times but that isn't the fault of the restaurant... its the flow of people. -The food seems to be overly salty.  I find that I have to drink gallons of water when I get home. The Ugly -Service most of the time is terrible.  It took us 20 minutes to order food and seemed to be skipped by waiters quite often. All in all, it's an okay time but I think the company you are with makes up for it.   Also, ask to be served by KIM, she's the best and made all the other times that we went worth it.  How often do we have personality with our waiters and waitresses?  She'll sit with you and joke around with ya.  She was so good, we tipped her 30%."
Kris L.,"San Francisco, CA",198,805,261,3.0,3/27/2010,"A and I dropped in for a bite to eat while we were waiting for our movie to start (Green Zone, if you're interested). We were there around 11am and here were only a couple of tables occupied. We were seated immediately and our waiter came by super speedy-like to take our orders. We split one of the flatbread pizzas for an appetizer - the chicken pesto one, I believe. It was good, but maybe because I love me some pesto! For my main course, I got the California Chicken Sandwich. Toasted sourdough bread, avocados, chicken, pickles, a little bit of a spicy kick from the mayo...it was really good. I'd definitely order it again. Oh, and don't forget to order the strawberry lemonade.  It's really tasty. The location is super convenient because it's in the mall and a good place to eat before or after you watch a movie at the theater."
Arnold W.,"Irvine, CA",710,1580,989,3.0,3/10/2010,"Great location...right next to SFO. Perfect for my 2.5 hour layover to Boston. Teresa N. picked me up and we met up with Hana C. Awesome for friends who live near airports. =) Food here is your normal BJ's like everywhere else. Service was a bit slow, even though it was late at night."
Karim R.,"San Francisco, CA",74,215,1,4.0,5/18/2009,I came to BJ's for my pre race meal with GG Saturday night .  It was a great  vibe in the spot and our bartender was GREAT! Shout out to Ruben who makes a mean Long Beach!  Ruben took really good care of me and GG drinks appetizers he handle the meal and still made drinks for others on the side.  We had the chicken wings and the spinach dip for appetitizers and they were so good.  I love crispy and spicy chicken wings and the dipping sauce yum!  The Spinach Artichoke dip was good too but I think I like the colorful chip better!  Me and GG ordered two sandwiches she had the turkey burger that looked very good with potatoe wedges and I had the grilled california chicken sandwich. This is a good sandwich but you need the avacado to make it complete! I know because I took off the avacado on one half of the sandwich.  Overall I can't wait to go back and get drunk at the bar ! haha just kidding!
John P.,"Millbrae, CA",0,2,,3.0,2/19/2013,"Service was horrendous. My group of more than 20 had a reservation and suddenly, at the night of our dinner, our reservation was gone-- perhaps because we all looked young and they did really not cater our needs. Service was rude, food took WAY TOO LONG, and the only good thing was the pizooki."
Sandra S.,"San Pablo, CA",206,506,145,3.0,3/15/2010,I've actually never been a fan of BJ's.  My sister was begging me to go and I figured I've avoided eating there long enough and should go with her. My last adventure to BJs many many months ago was not pleasant so I vowed never to go back. Only because I wanted to make my sister happy did I go. I was actually very pleased during my visit :) Since it as beautiful outside we decided to sit outside and eat.  Our service was excellent as sometimes I fear when you eat outside they forget about you.  They didn't :) I ordered 2 small mini meals that was new.  The hawaiian shrimp skewers and the Mozzerella and Tomato salad.  It was excellent!! Nicely seasoned.  A great portion.  I was definitely very satisfied :) And so was my sister :)
Nancy C.,"San Francisco, CA",201,220,71,3.0,1/8/2012,"Do try hard to conceal your girlish giggle (I'm pointing at you, guys) when your server says ""Hello. Welcome to BJ's. My name is ______ and I'm here to service you."" Yeah, I have immature friends. Men: can't live with 'em, can't send them off on a rocket to Mars. Moving on... What can I say about BJ's that hasn't already already been stated? The food is decent for mall fare. There's nothing outstanding on their menu but it gets the job done if you're hungry and you don't feel like getting something from the food court. It's good for groups if you want to sit for a while and catch up over food.The wait is always super long on Fridays and weekends so you might want to make a reservation if you know you want to eat here with a big group. I've been here many times and nothing has ever stood out enough to me for me to order it again on future visits. I will say that their salads are disappointing though. Stay away from them. The desserts are pretty good but it all sits on the cusp of overly sweet considering how their menu caters to the average American, so too much sugar is pretty much a given. The same applies for most of their food: too much fat, too much grease, too much salt, etc. When you come here, come for convenience and the social aspect. If you're here for the food, just expect average American fare along the lines of Elephant Bar and Cheesecake Factory."
Whitney F.,"Fort Collins, CO",5,5,,3.0,9/18/2011,"Food was okay, nothing spectacular.  Prices are pretty average.  The beers are pretty boring - not necessarily bad, but nothing to write home about.  I probably wouldn't come back.  I think I've been spoiled by much better beers."
Dan L.,"San Francisco, CA",68,64,,2.0,9/4/2012,"Have been to this restaurant several times before.  We went this Tuesday evening - and hoped there wouldn't be a crowd. There wasn't but took about 10 minutes to get seated.  I enjoyed their light lager beer - but food was hit and miss - daughter's pasta was bland - angel hair barely had any flavor (where were the sun dried tomatos and garlic). My thai mango salad was tasty but the portions were small. Plus service was real, real slow - about 1/2 hour wait plus 1/2 wait for the desert. Tons of people working there but they need to get their act together and get some quality in the kitchen."
Max D.,"San Jose, CA",24,20,7,1.0,9/4/2012,"Worst BJS by far. I don't mind slow service if I get good or DECENT food. I ordered a rare New York strip and it came out medium to well done. They redid the steak and it came out rare, happy right? Wrong! The steak was cold and had terrible sear, for $20 I expect a decent steak Jesus. I tried to call on one of the waitresses but she literally looked at me then walked a way. Long story short, no tip and last time I'll ever be back. Other BJs are MUCH better."
Neece S.,"Long Beach, CA",81,37,3,2.0,5/7/2012,"I don't know, the menu wasn't very appetizing to me. We went here for my aunt's birthday. Just a few of us girls wanting to go out and get a few drinks. This was my first time here, wasn't impressed. Not somewhere I'd go again, especially not for the food."
Shadi K.,"San Francisco, CA",6,66,,3.0,7/29/2014,"I would give 3 stars for the food, something is missing about the taste not sure what it is but would give 4 stars for the desert, which made me leave the place happy !"
Elsa C.,"San Francisco, CA",20,24,11,1.0,7/24/2012,"Probably the WORST customer service I had experienced ever...I had waited a while to write this review so it would give me time to cool off and put things in perspective.  My friends and I came in to watch the last game of the NBA finals because I remembered while eating here how many big screens they had everywhere, and the boys needed to watch their basketball. So, I arrive and the place is already packed but with less than 10 ppl in the waiting area. I walk over to the hostess podium and wait patiently for the golden haired hostess who is finishing up something on the computer to ask to put my name down. I wait, and wait...and she doesn't acknowledge me so I think I better get her attention by saying ""excuse me?"" and she kind of holds her finger up at me and gives me a fake smile and says that she will be with me in a minute with a slight edge in her voice. That's fine, you're busy, I work at a restaurant...I get it. BUT then on the other side of the large podium a line starts forming and another hostess appears, and proceeds to take care of that line. She takes the name of one party, and then another, and the golden haired waitress pays no mind to anything that's going on. Seeing that two parties already had cut me in the line to put my name down, I ask the first hostess - ""umm, should I be asking HER to put my name down since you're busy?"" And..the golden haired hostess totally ignores me! I'm pretty annoyed at this point, but I walk over to the other hostess, a dark haired girl, and I tell her I tried to out my name down with golden hair earlier but she blew me off. The dark haired hostess apologizes and gives me a pager, and takes my party of 7 down and tells me it's going to be about half an hour.  I wait patiently again for my pager to go off. 45 minutes later, I go back up to the podium and ask what the deal is, and a third, african american hostess takes my pager and goes ""hmmm...i don't seem to have your reservation in our system."" REALLY? After all that you lose my freaking name? How else did I get a pager if you didn't take my name down? Not her fault, i know, but I glare back at the first two hostesses I encountered. The third hostess apologizes and tells me she will see what she can do. She is probably the only capable hostess out of the whole lot since the others were either rude or incompetent to not even take my name down when I already stated how bad I was treated. I arrived at 5:45 to put my name down. When we got seated...guess what time it was? 8 freaking thirty...almost 3 hours because those hostesses were so incapable of doing their jobs. It was just plain ridiculous. I would have left if the guys weren't so adamant about not missing the game.  I am writing this to management of this establishment because I want them to know how poorly I was treated and how incompetent their hostess staff were. I never even got an apology from the first two, it was only the third hostess that looked really sorry and tried to help.  Also, when we finally sat down my friend sat down to a plate with leftover food on it. When he asked for another, the waitress gave him a replacement with an equal amount of leftover food, not once, but twice! Gross.  I will never EVER be coming back to this BJ's location again. Such a shame because I love their pizza and pizookies. I hope management cracks down and makes sure nothing like this happens to anyone ever again because I will say it again HANDS DOWN WORST HOSTESSES and CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER."
Gabe R.,"South San Francisco, CA",7,110,,4.0,9/9/2009,"REAL strawberry lemonade? Refillable? YES PLEASE! BJ's is such a nice resto-bar. Totally blows Dave & Busters out of the water (frankly, D&B does it overly with the games) the food from BJ's is pretty awesome. I mean, their pastas are always a sure thing for me. But i also LOVE their french dip. mmmhmmm. I tried this one thing, wild rice pilaf with prawns. it was spicy, but soo good. The lemonade with it was a sure win for me. But aside from the food and the (i cant emphasize this enough) amazing strawberry lemonade, I find myself watching the games in their multitude of TVs. This totally lives up to the resto-bar thing its getting at. BJs is always no-fail dinner for me. now to try their famous pizzookie..."
Peter C.,"San Bruno, CA",71,151,19,2.0,2/11/2013,"Haven't been back since my to go order was screwed up, complained via snail mail with no reply."
Amy B.,"Long Beach, CA",297,251,77,4.0,9/17/2009,"Good beers and a good happy hour. Can't ask for much more! I really like the sliders and the wings aren't bad. My boyfriend prefers the bbq chicken pizza. On the other hand, I really don't like the pot stickers. Which I mean to say, I don't really like the sauce. it's so salty and I really like salty foods so beware! But hey, half off at happy hour leaves me with not much to complain about, right?  I prefer the blonde and the nutty brunette for the beers but they are all very good! They will let you try a little if you want to try before you buy which I suggest you do!  The bar area is self-seating so no need to wait for a table and the big screen TV's are always showing a game if you're a sports fan!"
Janelle C.,"Livermore, CA",111,51,61,3.0,6/11/2010,"I get to visit for lunch every so often and I come back because it's clean, the service is OK and I know what I'm going to get (foodwise).  French dip and Tuscan tomato bisque are my favorites.  The crispy thin fries are usually a hit, but my last visit was a bit of a downer (not so crispy). If you're going to visit, be prepared to wait during lunch and dinner hours.  If you're trying to get a quick bite, I'd recommend bar seating or takeout (you can order online)."
Jenny L.,"Millbrae, CA",157,960,682,2.0,2/11/2008,"The BJ's in Foster City gets at least 3 stars for a solid sports bar, grill, and pizza joint.  However, the food and service at this chain can't compete.  My chardonnay shrimp pasta was diluted with water whereas my friend's cajun pasta was cooked too al dente.  Anything fried glistened in the light, which meant it was refried and had excess oil.  The only redeeming quality was ending the evening on a sweet note with the baked apple crisp. Parking is ample in this mall, but the long wait for average service suggests that you can find better alternatives.  Some of the waiters are sweet by offering a free birthday dessert.  However, the dining experience didn't quite pass my standards."
Jason W.,"San Francisco, CA",511,130,16,3.0,4/23/2012,"food is actually really good here. i can't complain much about it. the deep dish pizzas are delicious, all the chicken dishes that i've gotten (chicken limone, chcken parmigiana, lemon crusted chicken) were all extremely good. obviously to top off the night, you finish off with ""to die for"" pazookies, coming in assorted flavors such as oreo, white chocolate macademia, triple chocolate, original?, and their new red velvet flavor!!! the only thing that is wrong is their service. it's quite lackluster. they don't come to your table often and i've had to get up several times on numerous occasions to get my server and bring him to our table to either get our orders, get the bill, ask for more of whatever, etc. it gets frustrating when the customer has to get up for them. other servers that are not assigned to your table are pretty rude if you ask them to get your designated server (at lesat from my experiences of remembrance).  still food is pretty delish, though i truly wish they would get some bigger items for the larger eaters such as myself."
