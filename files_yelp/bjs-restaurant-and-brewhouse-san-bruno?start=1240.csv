Dominique S.,"San Francisco, CA",57,13,,1.0,1/16/2012,"Can I say that this is actually a .5 of a star?  This place is worthy of my first review for it's incredibly rude service.  After taking my son to hop and play, my hungry two year old, my disabled husband and two month old were excited to try out BJs.  We never go out considering how hard it is as a nursing mother and also with my husbands disability it makes things extremely difficult.  They told my husband a table would be ready in 45 minutes and not more than that.  After waiting for 47 minutes, we went in to check the status of our table.  The girl told us it would be another 20+ minutes.  At this point my son was fussing and my daughter was asleep.  I asked her ""why did you guys say it was going to be less than 45 min?  Now it's turned into an hour plus"". She snippily replied ""running time right now is 47 minutes"". I asked her how long take out would be and she said 15 minutes.  My son was in his stroller crying while we looked at the take out menu, and while the two hostess talked crap about us right in front of us about how we changed our mind.  This pissed me off because I could hear them and the other hostess looked at my son rolling her eyes.  She came by with some crayons and paper and gave it to him and said ""your welcome"" what a rude girl!   My husband grabbed the crayons and put them on the table because of her rudeness.  While we waited for our take out, they persisted with giving me bad looks and starring at my son.  We walked and waited outside because of how uncomfortable they made us feel and my husband walked passed the door and heard the hosting bragging to the cashier at the take out corner how she rudely gave the crayons to us to shut my son up.  My husband never complains.  At this point he walked in and she turned and said ""is there anything I can help you with?"" sweetly.   He told her ""no I didn't ask you to give us crayons and I didn't appreciate that.  And I don't appreciate you chit chatting to your friend about us either."" Just as he said that, the manager walked into the conversation.  We walked outside and the manager apologized.  He was nice but didn't offer any type of compensation for their rude behavior and our incredibly long wait.   It really isn't even about the long wait.  It's really about how these girls continued to talk crap about us while we were there.  Yeah it's loud in there, but I could clearly hear them.  It really ruined my night.   It was pretty over priced.  I payed 42 bucks for a large bj favorite deep dish pizza and sliders.   Then the icing on the cake!  My son and I were the only one who ate the sliders...and we got very sick!  Like sick to where my two year old was doing projectile vomiting and diarrhea.  I was doing the same for 2 days.  We were flying out to Hawaii 2 days later and it was the most miserable experience to watch your two year old in pain and you yourself is puking.  My husband can only help so much due to his condition.  Maybe they did something to my food because I was really pissed?  No idea, better to be safe than sorry.  NEVER EVER AGAIN!"
Tatiana S.,"San Bruno, CA",51,13,,4.0,8/18/2010,"A definite fave. Dinner time can get pretty crowded, so call ahead if you can, but seldom have a problem getting in for lunch.  The lunch specials start at around $5.99 and are great. The beers are awesome and they have a full bar with excellent cocktails (try the top shelf margarita!). Great place to watch the games on mulitple tvs or sit outside on their nice patio, well protected from wind and with heaters.  Good kids menu - my son LOVES BJ's! Favorite menu items - Grilled Shrimp Tacos, Buffalo Wings, Thai Salmon,  Thin fries and don't even get me started on the chocolate pazookie! (Tip: There's a kids one that 's a little smaller but still great for only around $2!"
Karlicorn U.,"Los Molinos, CA",3,201,7,1.0,11/3/2013,"I gave them another chance thinking there's no way they are still as horrendous and redick as the last time, but I WAS WRONG! It started with the rude girl on the phone when I tried to call ahead, which BJ's encourages you to do mind you...She made me wait for 3 minutes on hold just to give my name! We get there ten minuets later and are told it's a ten ,minute wait, which would had been fine had that been the truth. The truth was it was a 25 minute wait and we only went there because we had a movie to go to and we had just over one hour by the time the ten minute waiting time lie was told to us. Just as I was about to go set the stupid buzzer device on the counter and leave, it buzzed. Was a total mistake to stay! My sons dad had to seriously go searching for silverware and napkins! Seriously! He was actually told by a server that they ""were out""!!!! WTF!?!?! We finally get some that were so hot we had to let them cool for five minutes just so we could eat our side salads. They got my sons order wrong which was a super simple order too. Brought our drinks about 25 minutes after we had been seated and AFTER we were done with our salads and all we ordered was iced tea, oj, and a beer. OMG! Was like we were being filmed on a hidden camera show to test our patience. Just kept reiterating how this location does not deserve another chance. I have been to 6 other Bay Area BJ's and not one other one except the Tanforan location is god awful. I would rather drive to Santa Clara than go to Tanforan's ever again!"
Shine S.,"San Francisco, CA",160,177,49,3.0,3/12/2010,"Nice ambiance for a chain! The food seems like any other average restaurant but a notch higher. I ordered pulled pork sandwich, it wasn't bad but I was disappointed in the hamburger. Maybe next time I should order the steak *shrug* The dessert was great, a fresh cookie and ice cream. I don't like sweets really but it was really good!"
Theresa D.,"Daly City, CA",32,461,53,3.0,1/30/2010,"A good place to have a beer and catch up with old friends who like to be in loud and boisterous places. Nothing fancy, its basically a big sports bar with food that you would expect at  a place like this. Burgers, Pasta, Pizza, and some salads as well. But the major part of the menu is their drink selection. Good for small groups."
Joyce W.,"South San Francisco, CA",4,26,356,4.0,4/12/2010,"Love their Happy Hour menu! Awesome! Frozen Margarita (original/ Pomegranate) are always my favorite! Love to go there for lunch~~~ great size & price for half soup half salad,  pasta or sandwish!!!  Love their Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. Everything in that is just taste so good!!!!! But I always wish to have more tortilla chip~~~~ =P Love their PIZZA with thick bread!!!  Love their special HONEY-CRISP CHICKEN SALAD which is with honey mustard dressing!!! AWESOME* But........ Just always HATE to wait there for half or an hour!!!!!"
Dee V.,"Palo Alto, CA",787,434,1260,4.0,7/18/2011,"Was there on a Friday evening. Had dinner here at BJs on the way to drop family at the airport. We ordered the chicken wings for the appetizers. Shared a jambalaya between the three of us. The portion sizes are huge and as we were not very hungry, one dish was good enough. We also had the chocolate chip pazookie. Everything was good, though very oily and rich."
Anne E.,"San Francisco, CA",267,251,117,3.0,4/24/2009,"Every time I come here, I always order their Avocado Egg Rolls. I can just have that as my entree and I'd be happy. The avocado filling with cream cheese and spices is so delicious. I guess there's something about the crunchy outside and the creamy inside that gets me. Yummm...my pregnant ass is craving it right about now.  Other than that, everything else is just mediocre. It's BJ's. Can't expect 5-star quality. I'd put it in the same category as Fridays, Chilis and Elephant Bar. Although, I find that BJ's has tastier food than Fridays and Elephant Bar. This particular location is always busy....expect a wait during happy hours and weekends.  Note: You can reserve your table in advance. Call the restaurant!"
Chas A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",114,173,137,2.0,9/25/2011,A bit disappointed with this BJs location. Service was awful- we waited 15 minutes to order; it took more than 20 minutes for us to get our food; the waitress did not check up on us while we ate; the food was a bit cold (I could tell that it was sitting out for awhile before we got it); when we asked for a box to wrap our food we weren't given a bag; and they did not clear our plates while we had dessert (so our little table for two was filled with three dirty dishes and we ate our dessert over those dishes). The only positive thing about this place was that they seated us pretty quick after saying we'd have to wait 45 min. to an hour. I definitely will not be returning to this location again.
Tatiana D.,"Daly City, CA",360,356,69,1.0,5/31/2011,"Named appropriately so because it sucks. Service is bad and surly. The last time I was here, my poor little two year old niece yakked on the way to the bathroom with her mom (my sister Alexis D.). The wait staff didn't even offer to help clean up or provide napkins. Food is mediocre which shouldn't be too much of a surprise since it's crappy bar fare anyway. The only thing saving this place is the Pizookie which wasn't even that good the last time I had it, too doughy for my taste."
Claudia M.,"Fort Shafter, HI",160,316,200,3.0,12/18/2011,"Ok food, i had to wait awhile to get a refill on my drink....meh of a place"
Eva J.,"San Francisco, CA",11,8,2,3.0,7/29/2012,"omg this place was loud. typical american. great for large group gatherings but not so ideal for small dates due to the high level of noisiness. we went to celebrate a coworker's birthday, unfortunately we had to wait for a long time to get a big table. i think i heard about them not taking reservations OR we actually did have a reservation but just no big table available. either way, that was a long and awkward wait because some people got to sit at the bar, some had to stand and just awkwardly chatting amongst ourselves.  moving on to the food part, and thank goodness food was awesome so i can overlook the waiting experience. i forgot what i ordered but it was delicious. i tasted my friend's seafood pasta and that was also awesome (very spicy, loved it!). so yeah......again very typical of an american birthday party dinner at bj's :)"
Rich P.,"Antioch, CA",68,654,137,4.0,5/11/2012,"Outside patio is super nice on a sunny afternoon. Try the Great White, or the Buffalo Chicken pizza. I also really liked their new beer - hop-something-or-other. At any rate, it's really good. give it a shot. I also tried the watermelon and feta salad. Grubbin!"
Analyst C.,"San Mateo, CA",9,248,458,3.0,2/15/2013,Great Chines chicken salad; great place to meet GF's for a quick bite!
Montana R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,,4.0,1/2/2013,Awesome happy hour specials. Half-price flatbread mini pizzas are great. The bj's hefe is good too.  Nice big screen able to be seen from anywhere in the bar.  Only negative is that they don't play the sound on local 49er games??? :(  otherwise I'd give 5 stars.
Nicole H.,"San Bruno, CA",34,3,5,1.0,9/4/2012,We called in for a reservation and they asked for our name and when we got there they didn't even put the name down on the list. It makes me sad that the customer service is awful. I gave them many chances because I love the food but sadly the waiters and waitresses are disappointing. Most of the times ive been here the waiters/waitresses take to long. They rarely check to see how were doing and when i need something they are never around and take so much time just to get a bottle of ketchup!!!!!!!!!!!!! Big disappointment.
Braden K.,"Honolulu, HI",516,390,3,3.0,7/14/2011,"in my dirty opinion, the only BJ's that get 5/5 stars are 1. my favorite adult actress in my favorite adult film. and 2. my ex-girlfriend during that threesome on the beach with our friend jack daniels. just keeeding! on a more serious and appropriate note, I've heard nothing but hype hype hype about these famous BJ's spots.. I finally came through with some co-workers after handling some business and we all ordered different dishes. SERVICE: it was great up until about mid-meal when our waiter courteously handed off to another waitress who was friendly and perky though slow like yurtle the turtle.. ATMOSPHERE: sports bar theme. decent lighting, comfortable seats, several plasma televisions with all different sporting events going on simultaneously. my kind of place! too bad we were on the clock, otherwise i'd have ordered a few rounds! FOOD: I hate to sound like a snob and it really does take a lot for me to complain.. but for $12, I had expected a rather filling portion. the roast dip sandwich was tiny. a $5-footlong is twice as filling and tastes a lot fresher. the horseradish was the imitated substitute, diluted and not spicy at all. the worst part was the fries. they were soggy, thin like mosquito legs, not filling, soaked in grease, and obviously microwaved. the jambalaya was much tastier. spicy and tangy in flavor, each bite included pieces of sausage, shrimp, and vegetables. it resembled the way I like my women, generously coated in thick, cajun seasoning! just kidding, i'm done. my other co-workers ordered soup, salad, and sandwich combos and fish tacos. speaking of which, I never really understood the 'wedge salad' ordeal? whatever, I wasn't eating it haha   i'll keep it short and end on a good note. the PIZOOKIE saved BJ's life. this little baked cookie with two heaping piles of ice cream on top tasted like it was made from the breast milk of an angel. the combination of a freshly baked, half oreo, half chocolate-chip cookie base with two large lumps of french vanilla ice cream sitting on top was the crème de la crème! i don't even eat sweets. no candy, no soda, no cookies, brownies, etc. but that dessert was the BEES KNEES."
Janet S.,"Fresno, CA",150,1032,90,3.0,1/8/2010,"All right for a chain restaurant.  Ordered a chopped salad which was good; hubby had a burger melt.  He really wanted a patty melt, but BJs didn't have any rye bread.  So shouldn't a burger melt just be a burger?  I'm just sayin' . . ."
Diego A.,"Daly City, CA",89,93,35,4.0,7/17/2011,"BJ's is one of my favorites. It always delivers what I am expecting and brings good times to both my girlfriend and I everytime we go. It is nothing authentic but if you are looking for a reasonably priced, delicious dinner, out with friends or a loved one at a nice restaurant, BJ's is a great choice. I recommend ordering a blonde ale and some lettuce wraps to start, from their go ahead and make a delicious choice and enjoy the night. A great place for a restaurant dinner out!"
Mr P.,"San Francisco, CA",13,55,14,3.0,5/2/2012,"Went to BJ's in San Bruno last night for the first time. We ordered a Roast Beef Dip and the Mahi Tuna shown above, along with a couple beers which were wonderful. My dip was good, but sadly the cook had burned the Mahi until the corners were black. It was tough, not juicy and lost all its flavor. It was very busy so it was difficult to track down our waitress, but we did and she ordered up a second round of the Mahi cooked properly. It took an additional 15 minutes to get the second plate of Mahi, but it was cooked perfectly. It was excellent. Even though the waitress did an excellent job serving us, I was dissapointed there was no discounmeal for the poorly cooked Mahi the fist time, not even 10%. Dinner overall was good though, but I might hesitate going back."
