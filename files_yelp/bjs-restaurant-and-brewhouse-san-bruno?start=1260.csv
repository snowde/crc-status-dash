Sharon G.,"San Francisco, CA",326,255,137,3.0,7/5/2011,"This isnt a place I'd go to often since I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants. The wait on a Sunday night was decent - about a half hour. We got the great white, BJs favorite, BBQ chicken and spinach and artichoke. My favorites were the Great White and BBQ Chicken! ALSO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT HAVING A PIZOOKIE! The cookies n' cream pizookie was fantab! We also had the red velvet one - which tasted fruitier than I would've liked. That one was meh. I could pass. Overall, decent!"
Steph L.,"Daly City, CA",80,185,134,2.0,1/6/2010,"It seems that everyone i know loves it here, but I could live without it.  The last time I went my friend and I sampled about four different beers(all in fairly large glasses) which was pretty cool and reasonably priced.  To me the food is just ok and they do not have a large enough selection of deserts.  When i played softball in college my teammates and I used to order those big cookie things, and i must admit those are pretty good when you have a big appetite.  The pizzas are ok, but I dont really like anything else on the menu.  I'm never terribly excited to go there."
Chloe W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,,5.0,8/29/2012,"Excellent service, excellent mixed drinks and the pizzas are surprisingly good. Make sure to get the oreo pizzokie."
Tammy B.,"Pacifica, CA",24,76,4,3.0,7/8/2009,"Update; Now that restaurants have to list the nutritional information I have found out my fav Santa Fe Salad has over a whopping 900 calaries, so now I've switched to their grilled shrimp lettuce wraps and a small bowl of chile or a wedge salad for under 600. A much better choice."
S. M.,"San Francisco, CA",97,236,,1.0,4/26/2012,"Too many kids (aka servers) standing around flirting with each other or picking their noses. Not attentive at all, food is so standard that I won't be coming back anymore plus they always mess up my order anyways (How hard is it to remember dressing on the side?)"
phewoner T.,"San Francisco, CA",102,16,32,1.0,11/7/2011,"first time here and this place bites! I ordered my food and BULLSHIT Waitress looks at me crazy like I stole something from her..it ain't my fault you u got problems..DUMBASS! NO TIP FOR YOU!! and to top it all off the walkway near the back was slippery as a mutha, I noticed everytime someone walked on it they nearly slipped and feel..not a good look..NEVER GOING BACK and NEVER GONNA RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!"
La Toya B.,"Sacramento, CA",30,69,24,4.0,4/11/2010,"My husband and I came here for Valentine's Day and to our surprise it was not that busy and the wait was less than 20 min. As we waited we were served a slice of pepperoni deep dish pizza, which was so good it almost made me change my mind about what I was going to order.  The hostess and wait staff were friendly and accommodating and our food came out hot, fresh, and delicious.  Really not a place for the romantics, but if you just want to chill out with the other half or some friends and watch the big screen, this is your place."
Denny P.,"San Jose, CA",216,30,1,3.0,2/28/2012,"In all honesty I think that the better BJ's are located in the South Bay because after coming here, the service was just aaaite and the food is never anything to be excited about. It is a chill place to come with a few buddies to have lunch and catch up or talk about whatever but for the most part it's nothing more than mediocre at best."
Tamar D.,"San Francisco, CA",98,525,172,3.0,1/23/2010,"Remember that part in ""You've Got Mail"" where Tom Hanks's character is doing a voiceover, where he explains that the reason why places like Starbucks are so popular is because people who have no decision-making capability at all have the opportunity to make ten decisions at once, all just to order a cup of coffee? That's this place. I'm never a fan of the menu that reads for pages....and pages....and PAGES!!!  Like, why?  Really?  We can't even retain that much information in the space of ten minutes, especially when we're parched and have already consumed half of the pitcher of Hefeweisen that you put on the table.   I had the Santa Fe Salad with some salmon and called it a day.  One of our party of 7 had the Chili Cheese burger, but you know what?  The real name of the burger read like the names that you find at a dog show: Champion Kingsmire Chili Cheese Winnebago Bashful.   Crazy menu aside, the place is good with a rowdy group and a nice end to a couple of hours at the driving range."
Felicia G.,"Chula Vista, CA",90,32,1,3.0,4/8/2012,"Can I just say how convenient it is to live across the street from a BJ's? It's awesome & not so awesome (for my diet) at the same time. Some of our favorites on the menu come from the appetizer list. Specifically - the avocado egg rolls, the chicken wings and the artichoke dip. Don't forget to grab a cider and ale pitcher! I also recently had my first pizookie from BJ's evarrr. My tastebuds were thoroughly delighted. Great spot to take a group of friends. It's loud & lively so don't expect a romantical date."
Iroquois S.,"Daly City, CA",1,34,,4.0,5/13/2012,"This place is great if you want mouth-watering beer and delicious deep dish pizza. My only gripe is that the pizza is sometimes dry, extra sauce may be necessary. Actually, extra sauce is definitely necessary, request marinara dipping sauce for that pizza."
Virginia L.,"San Francisco, CA",315,181,8,4.0,4/13/2009,"Well shoot, what Bruin hasn't been to BJ's, being one of the standbys in Westwood?  I am no exception.  This had been a regular spot all throughout my undergrad, and I thought it was exclusive to Southern California.  I was wrong and I'm happy to see that NorCal loves BJs just as much as the South ;) I think their classic pizza here is the BBQ.  It's good, but I prefer their Great White.  Salads and sandwiches are good (not actually a ""healthy"" option, the way their built, but good).  Appies are standard American fare with twice the serving size and heartiness - just the way I like it.  Oh yeah, their seven beer sampler is one of the better that I've found in this type of brewery.   It's probably a true 3, but their pazookie bumps them up to a 4.  Plus, the San Bruno location had the best service out of all BJ's I've been to, from the host down to the bus boy.  A must try at least once, but only if you come hungry."
Tony L.,"Rota, Spain",153,539,2697,3.0,3/14/2011,"Went here yesterday with a family friend in tow and sis. The traffic was terrible and raining, but we were seated within 10mins as BJ's was as normal packed to the gills. We were seated in the ""lounge"", an area we haven't seen yet but from afar, way in the back and flat-screen television monitors all over the upper walls at every angle. I ordered a plate of fried squid which was very good, I was amazed. Our friend ordered a clam chowder but wanted the bread bowl to be served separately; they instead served it inside, so she sent it back. It was returned and seeing the inside of the bread bowl still wet, determined all they did was pour the chowder out and scrape the wet bread out. What kitchen knuckle-heads. Sis ordered a baked potato w/cheese and bacon bits, and a bowl of chili soup. The soup had to be requested again, and the potato had the cheese but no bacon. I have to hand it to our East Coast waiter because he was fabulous though the kitchen help was ""lost in space"" and hadn't found their way back to the kitchen....  or elsewhere! I tried a different beer this time and ordered a Lindeman Framboise Lambic, and made in Vlezenbeek, Belgium. WoW!! This is very unlike a beer - very dark but very sweet! Can hardly taste any alcohol in this, and is more like drinking a very strong fruit drink. Very nice if you like the fruity taste!!!"
Aaron Z.,"San Francisco, CA",21,193,95,1.0,8/21/2009,"I guess if you can get in this place you may like it, but I know I will never set foot here. I had a party of 8 and called around 11 a.m same day. Well they only take reservations 24 hrs. in advance.  Go figure that one. The girl told me call back 1/2 hour before we come that eve and they'll put our name on the list. So, I did. Then, that evening when I called she said it will be "" 3 hours before we can seat 8!!"" In the Midwest they do this too- so that people hang out, buy drinks and appetizers and make the place look really popular and busy, when really it is just poor management and not much concern for customers. We ended up in Burlingame , at Steelhead Brewery. I have heard from people who have eaten at BJ's, that the menu is nothing special.   I know after this experience, I will never give them my business."
Heather C.,"San Francisco, CA",1867,417,735,4.0,2/2/2009,I came here yesterday for the superbowl the drinks were pretty good (i think i had too many though.. -_-;;) and the spinach and artichoke dip were pretty good and so were the chicken wings! the waitress and the bartender were super nice!
Yvonne K.,"Belmont, CA",71,107,63,3.0,1/2/2010,"While I do enjoy BJ's food, the last 2 times I have eaten here I got sick after. :( BJ's is well known for their pizza and beer. I like the great white pizza and the Jerimiah Red beer. Mmmm... Beer! The potatoes are huge, so make sure you're really hungry if you order one. This BJ's location often has crowding issues since it is located at Tanforan Shopping center. If you are trying to go at a popular time, expect to have to wait. They have great happy hour specials available M-TH from 3-7.  They also have online ordering available for those that would rather forgo the wait. This can come in especially handy on lunch breaks at work. You can order it early, say what time you want it ready, and just pop in to pick it up."
Karen C.,"Castro Valley, CA",250,363,218,4.0,1/1/2010,"I usually come here at lunch time and arrive a little bit before the crazy noon hour, so I can grab a seat at the bar area. That's the trick, is to come on the off hours because it can get really crowded here! There's not much selection when it comes to restaurants in the Tanforan mall, so pretty much everyone ends up here.  I order my favorite, the barbequed chicken chopped salad...It is HUGE! The salad is so fresh and crunchy with just the right amount of toppings, chicken, cilantro, jicama, cheese....and drizzled with barbeque sauce. I love it! I usually pair it with a blonde or a hefe beer and it is a perfect lunch that will fill you up through dinner.  The staff can be just okay...especially when they are busy, but after coming here for so long, they now know me a little and are a bit nicer...."
Sylwia A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",120,224,5,3.0,5/21/2009,"This used to be our spot for Thirsty Thursdays....  Staff isn't bad, it's hit or miss, we've had good ones, bad ones, great ones, or not so great ones. Drinks are good, I'm a fan of their beer sampler and their girly beer. The deep dish pizza is really good and so are their humung-O baked potatoes. Oh ya, and who could forget the pozookie?!?! Save room for the pozookie, those things are worth it!"
Roy V.,"South San Francisco, CA",54,29,20,3.0,2/3/2010,"Always a decent choice when it comes to eating out past 9pm when most other restaurants are already closed. The food is mediocre at best, but there's plenty of room for large groups and the menu is diverse enough so that even the most finiky eater will find something worth eating. The quality of the food, however, leaves much to be desired. The ingredients aren't fresh at all and I have a lingering feeling most of the meals are prepared ahead of time and just need to be warmed or heated through.  Despite the generally low quality of the food there is a bright crayon among the box of dull colors. An absolute MUST at this restaurant is the pazooki. Imagine a giant freshly baked cookie served with ice cream. A simple treat that always delivers. Without this delectable dessert I don't think this place would be worth coming back to."
linda w.,"Redwood City, CA",22,29,,5.0,5/6/2014,"Was here for the 7th game of warrior vs clipper. The five stars are for the bar staff, Brandon, Sam and Trish. As busy as it was, they still manage to satisfied all my every demands. BJ you are lucky to have them, self motivator and professional."
