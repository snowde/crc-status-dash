Alex V.,"Boca Raton, FL",186,169,18,4.0,7/20/2009,"This place is cool. Kinda like a new watering hole for me. Just moved to Millbrae and found this place which is a bout 2 miles from my place. Next to a mall where I can buy my stuff and have an excuse to stop by and get some grub. Been there twice now and the bartenders are pretty cool. They are quick to serve your drink, always helpful and a pretty good pour.  Food, I had a Cobb salad the first time I went there and I gotta say, it was pretty good. I think it was like 12 bucks, but it was huge. Second time I went there I had the Cali Burger. MAN!!! I have never had a burger with Avocado. I must have avocado on my burger from now on. The prices are modest. The drinks are a bit high for outside for a suburbia chain kinda place. But I have to say it was pretty good. I will be back. Wait a minute, I think I have to go pick up some stuff at Target tonight, and  maybe stumble upon the place again..."
Mei L.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,28,,4.0,4/7/2012,Happy hour and buffalo wings!! Nuff said
Natasha I.,"San Francisco, CA",39,121,94,4.0,5/5/2009,"This time around I ordered the Iced Coffee which was truly wicked. The frozen glass with chocolate frozen of course, swirled all around and delectable coffee with the right punch of baileys,yes it was sinful. We had the ""all together"" appetizer-thats spinach and artichoke dip with multicolored chips and bruschetta. Loved the greasy treat. Rounded it up with the brocolli cheddar soup (again rich and amazing) and boy had the veggie pizza.  My only complaint-The waiter hardly checked on us.  (Well that and the aftermath of eating way too much. )"
Tim S.,"San Francisco, CA",33,43,25,4.0,1/19/2010,"Came here for a late dinner/ drink. I've been here many times before, usually for happy hour drinks and appetizers, but this time I got an entree and a beer. I ordered the Balsamic Chicken which was new to their menu. It was suggested by my waitress who said it was ""really good."" It came with two slices of chicken breast over a bed of salad with a side of cheesy mashed potatoes. The chicken was cooked just fine - I'm actually surprised as most of the dishes are dry or ""is missing something."" The seasoning was good and I can say I enjoyed the dish. I also had a Blonde beer which is the lightest of all the beers. I don't think it complimented the dish very well. Overall, I left satisfied. I'd go back again for some happy hour drinks and appetizers."
Jenn V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/4/2014,Went there on a weekday about 2pm for a late lunch. Service was good and we enjoyed our food. I thought it was on the pricier side but not expensive.
Daniel S.,"San Francisco, CA",402,271,32,4.0,1/16/2010,"I like BJ's, I come here whenever I can. The only things I order here is the deep dish pizza and split it with whoever I am with. i dont know why but thats the ONLY thing I like here. I have had a burger here once or twice but I usually go for the pizza's!  Beers are pretty good. They brew their own beer fresh! All of the beers are micro brew and I believe they have 7 or 8 different kinds. I have had a couple of them. For you non alcoholic drinkers. They have fresh ROOT BEER. I use to always order those (when I wasnt 21 ha) so yea great place. Prices are pretty decent"
Marie L.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,65,7,4.0,8/21/2011,"If you order take out DO NOT ORDER ONLINE. Apparently the screen cuts off the order so its always wrong, make sure to call.  I do enjoy the pizza, calzones, and the Southwest Salad, I think they took my favorite salad off the menu recently. Food can be greasy at times, but goes well with the beer. The desserts are great!"
JacQue S.,"Contra Costa, CA",28,97,24,3.0,2/10/2011,The food is either salty or bland.  For the price of food it's not worth it. But love the drinks.
Davon F.,"Vallejo, CA",59,98,55,4.0,2/20/2012,The food here was amazing! It was a little pricey but its worth it! Food portions are big! The service was a little slow and the gave me the wrong pizza. took me some time to get the right order but when i did the manager was the one to bring me my food and apologize he also paid for my food and dessert to make up for it! this place also has real good beer! This staff knows how to keep a customers happy
Albert B.,"Hercules, CA",0,37,,3.0,6/22/2010,"First, I would like to say that BJs is a chain of restaurants throughout the country. I don't normally yelp on chain restaurants, but this is worth reviewing even though there are 500 plus reviews.  My wife and I came here with the family last night and it was unusually busy for a Monday night around 10pm. Our host was friendly and greeted us immediately upon entering the restaurant. He informed us that the wait time would be approximately 15 minutes. We actually waited for almost 25 minutes.  The waitress that served our table was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the mozzarella sticks and the Mediterranean deep dish. The mozzarella sticks are good, but nothing special. I ordered the Nit Wit beer and it was okay. My sister ordered a glass of Pepsi and she stated that it was flat. My wife took a sip and she agreed. However, we were all surprised with the Mediterranean deep dish. Pesto, grilled chicken, fresh tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese, greek olives and jalapenos on the side. Pesto was so good with tons of fresh tomatoes and the right amount of cheese, this deep dish was so delicious. I really enjoyed the deep dish. It was filling and full of flavor. Pesto and deep dish. I never thought of it. A deep dish I highly recommend.  I haven't tried any of their other signature pizzas, because Zachary's in Berkley in my opinion is still the one to beat.  This is a place that is worth coming back when in the area. I'll definitely order the Mediterranean again.  A shout out to Lindsey who served us last night. You displayed a great level of customer service on a busy night. Thank you, Lindsey!  Here's a tip: while waiting to be seated, request a menu from the host so you and your party can decide what to order the moment you get your table."
Jorlyn W.,"Daly City, CA",202,52,12,2.0,1/8/2014,"This place is decent. Over priced food, medium sized portions.  Called in to put our name down and they told us 20 minutes got there in 10 and if was an extra 30 to see down.  Besides that we got seated at a huge boot it was a bit awkward but it's ok.  We ordered the shrimp scampi? BBQ chicken salad, and I must say the salad was really good and the scampi I would definitely pass on that.. Strawberry lemonade that my gf ordered was a bit too sweet so I wouldn't recommend ordering it. Service was a bit difficult, our server said they were understaffed, I appreciate the honesty but it sure didn't look like they were under staffed lol, they had people talking and walking around laughing.  Anyways the bill came out it was almost 50$ for 2 drinks and 2 entrees.... Wasn't really worth the amount of $ we spent.  I'm sure we'll be back to give it another shot.  The pazookie is definitely something to get I just didn't get it this time"
Frances V.,"South San Francisco, CA",22,183,245,3.0,2/17/2012,"BJ's is a good place to hang out for happy hour, that is if you are able to grab a table in the bar area and come early enough to. They have a large selection of beers (microbrews and imports) and wide selection of appetizers and entrees. Otherwise, there is nothing that really stands out here. Just your typical local restaurant and hangout spot. But I will always make room for their pazooki when I come here."
Julia R.,"San Mateo, CA",32,83,63,3.0,2/17/2012,"The food is tasty but the service is just awful. Either waiting for someone to take your take out order or if dining inside, its always SO SLOW! They have a wide range of food on the menu and everything is pretty delicious, the pizza's are pretty good as well, if only you could get some better servers then this place would be great!"
Cathy K.,"San Francisco, CA",492,583,848,2.0,1/8/2009,"So this is where all the people are on a Wednesday night at Tanforan Mall.  This joint was jumpin' for supper - a 45 minute wait. *Good energy. *Service so-so - maybe our server was new?  Didn't see much of her. *They brew their own.  Blonde Beer was good. *Good menu selection - salads, apps., soups, pizzas, sandwiches, pastas. *Fries not so good - I tried the Wedge Cut and Skinny. *Convenient to get to from San Francisco - take BART, get off at San Bruno station."
Tahira R.,"Millbrae, CA",0,10,,5.0,10/13/2012,"Ver helpful employees, extremely cooperative and friendly staff. Once our order was mistakenly understood by one of the staff and they could not deliver it to us because it was not in their stock. Then the manager came and apologised in very humble way and evevn was so generous that he didn't charged us at all . He mentioned that it was their misundersytanding that they thought that order was available in stock. He was apologetic for wasting our time while we waited for the order. Anyways, it seldom happens everuwhere and that was a very nice gesture. Their vegitable pizza and desert platter is always our choice whenever we go to tanforan."
Peter M.,"Daly City, CA",42,124,21,4.0,12/29/2009,"for a chain, this joint is quite good.  Lots of tv's...lots of beers...lots of fill-you-up-and-still-have-leftovers-to-box-up portions for very decent prices.  My favorites are the texas fried steak, buffalo wings, and you gotta save room to split a PIZOOKIE! pls take note that i'm speakin on the one in san bruno.  The one at bridgepoint sucks azz!"
Jae V.,"San Bruno, CA",27,38,,4.0,8/11/2009,"I usually eat here with my friends and it's a pretty good place to hang out and have some dinner.  The selection on the menu is alright and everyone is usually satisfied.   The servers are okay.  There are a couple of servers I've had that were great - friendly and communicative and tried not to keep us waiting too long, and then I've also had  one or two that forgot to bring the waters we ordered and one that lost our order completely. The wait time for a table is a little long and they don't seem to have an efficient way of serving the food.  But other than that, this is a cool place."
Linda C.,"San Francisco, CA",288,496,2513,3.0,11/23/2009,"Not a fan of chains, but I wanted pizza so we came here since it's open late. Service was slow and the place was still packed on a Sunday night.  - Classic Combo Pizza: classic with your basic pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, can't go wrong with that, but it's nothing special - Buffalo Chicken Pizza: spicy-my mouth had a nice burn the whole time, a little too creamy and saucy, chicken was good - Chips & Salsa: watery salsa, not spicy at all (i like my salsa chunky) - Piranha Beer: not bad We were too full to try their infamous pizookie. Next time! Great place to watch the game with lots of TV screens everywhere. Service needs work."
Rob L.,"Richmond, CA",80,211,3987,3.0,8/31/2009,"This place is a sports bar and restaurant combination where you take your boys or girls for an evening of watching the local team play an important game, or just a casual night out with friends. There's plenty of parking and other options for activity if you have some time to kill afterward, as it's connected to the Tanforan Mall which has movies and shopping if there's something you need.  Since this place is somewhat close to SFO, a traveler with over 2 hours to burn can stop by here before their flight and have a brew! This BJ's is easy to get to, as it's right next to the I-380 exit onto El Camino Real heading west. Overall, this is a chain, but I'd consider this place above average compared to other chain restaurants due to it's friendly staff and wall-to-wall HD TVs, though it does have it's weaknesses as a chain (i.e. long wait for a table during busy hours, basic chain menu of ""gourmet"" foods, etc.)."
Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",190,196,88,3.0,5/12/2009,"Solely a food review -  Only 3 stars because sometimes the wait is ridiculously long when the food is only 3.5 stars worth... The only items I order here are from the appetizers list: the onion strings (onion-y, greasy and so fun to eat) and the chicken lettuce wraps (can be a little salty but I feel like I'm eating a little healthier than most folks in there because this dish isn't fried). Sometimes like to end with a pazookie but usually am full from the two appetizers (even after sharing with my friends).  Tried the pizzas - wasn't impressed but many of them (the BBQ chicken pizza is okay... too saucy sometimes). And the rest of the menu is just bleh. Every sandwich has a cheesy bread, all the pastas have cream sauces - can you say heartburn? Or grease clogged arteries? I'll stick with my two appetizers, yay!"
