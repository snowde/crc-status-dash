Sarah S.,"Pleasanton, CA",94,94,4,3.0,5/22/2009,"Oh BJ's! I love you and hate you so much. I really only go here cause they have awesome music, and the avocado egg rolls and pazookie, but every time I try and bring someone here, we get totally jipped. FOR INSTANCE, Last night I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday.  I told the Peasant working the front desk that it was a party for two, she made a weird face and was like ""See, I can't even give you a quote time because there is a game"" And I am like, what does that mean? She explains that its the laker game is on and its only the first quarter and that it could be as long as an hour, HEY MORON, THAT IS  A QUOTE TIME. I ask her if we can at least have a pager, she says yes. We decide to wait it out. She was like, ok you'll have to come back in like 15 minutes for a pager. Whatever. So we can't have a pager? asshole.  We walk around and then go back in like 20 minutes. Still no pagers. This time its a different girl. and she is like I dont know come back in like 10 minutes.  We finally get a pager and the wait is only like 15 minutes.  Our waiter takes his sweet time getting to our table and then takes our drink order and appetizer order.  We get our appetizer order before our drinks.  He comes by and asks how things are going and my boyfriend tells him I would like a water. He says sure no problem as if I hadn't ordered one and been waiting.  The waiter sucked. SUCKED.  He brings us boxes and neither one of us had even requested boxes and both of us were not even halfway done with our food. He didnt even ask us if we wanted dessert, which we most definitely did.  I don't remember anything after that, the service was dismal and the food was so overloaded with butter that I couldnt even eat mine.  Stupid BJ's."
Mike D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/5/2013,"My girlfriend and I came in to get a nice lunch. To cut to the chase, after eating about half of her pasta, my girlfriend found what looked like a giant staple in her food. She informed the waiter, who was a nice enough guy, and he told us he would bring the manager who offered her another order of pasta. He told us it may have fallen in during cleaning?! Uhhh, that does not make us feel any better. Now she also has massive stomach pains. Awesome. If she swolled that staple she could've choked. The least the manager could have done was cover our whole meal, which was only about $20 by the way. So cheap. Never again BJ's."
Maria C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/21/2012,"This restaurant has deteriorated in both quality of food and service. We ordered a deep dish pizza. It took over 45 mins to get out the order. Worse yet, the pizza was not hot but lukewarm, like it was some leftover I warmed up in my oven. Service was really bad too. It took no less than 3 times to ask for refills on our drinks.  All in all, it took us well over 2 hours to finsh up because of the bad service. I have been to other BJs (in San Diego area) and they have not been this bad. This is easily one of the worst. I know I won't be going to this one again!"
Michelle Y.,"Daly City, CA",32,184,,4.0,1/17/2010,I've been here plenty of times. Mostly during happy hour. It's a good thing I have friends who aren't afraid to stalk and jump at the chance for an open table! hah!  The happy hour is pretty reasonable $1.50 off beers...half off pizzas...$2.00 off appetizers...its really not that bad and the food is pretty decent. (for bar food). You def don't come here in hope of having a fine dining experience. Great to hang out with friends and enjoy nice cold beers...
Mark L.,"San Diego, CA",462,244,87,4.0,12/4/2009,"one of the nicer lookin BJ's i've been to in California.  I've been going to BJs for some time, not like religiously, but a couple times a year. However, this was my first time really partaking in the happy hour deals...damn they have great deals in my time of being a broke grad student; combo that with friends and you get more bang for your buck! Potato Skins= yum Chickin Wings= yum Beer= yum $5 personal pizza combo= yum (made a sausage, mushroom, and japapeno one)  Cant go wrong. Really like the patio area outside with the fireplace.  Perfect for this winter weather up in Norcal."
Margarita G.,"Richmond, CA",0,3,2,5.0,7/8/2012,"By any chance, does anybody know a server or waiter there called John? If so, do you know his last name? Much appreciated.."
John-Michael C.,"Singapore, Singapore",1002,1228,300,3.0,10/30/2008,Come on....you know what you were thinking when you first heard the name of this place too. *evil grin It's was nice that I lived across the street from the place... made it a whole lot easier to walk back home after a drinking session.  Of course if you go earlier in the day on the weekend or so it can get rather busy....hell it can get down right ugly.  Scene - walking into BJ's stopping mid stride and watching a guy fly past me..... and finding myself face to face with an unruly crowd going after said aviator.  Otherwise the place isn't bad for a chain micro brewery. Go there after hours and catch the happy hour it's nice.....enough. This particular branch sometimes lights their outside gas fire place.  Word to the wise - don't try to light your cigarette while it's still in your mouth.
Sheree A.,"San Francisco, CA",77,120,9,4.0,3/24/2011,"I love the clam chicken wings here and the Pirana Pale ale, nothing beats a long day of work like some Chicken wings and a nice COLD beer! Its also a great place to watch sports.  The service is also better than at Hooters which also has chicken wings and beer, but the girls always have a bad attitude!"
Cee L.,"Daly City, CA",257,28,9,1.0,8/18/2011,"Ok I had enough of this place been here twice now the first time was BAD but thought i give it another shot.....ummmm bad idea I second Amanda S. review (previous yelp post)  Its funny how i see that someone went through something simular as me and we probably ran into the same waitress.  SHE WAS HORRIABLE~ i think it was about that time to take a break or go home for this waitress.  She probably only cracked a smile when she was getting ready to seat us then after that it was all down hill.  Rushed us to order our food,  rolled her eyes while we are trying to figure out what we want and took our order down wrong.  Now we ordered lots of food and to have lots of food you would think to fill our waters as much as possible but to have our ice melt and our glasses down to the last drop and have to wait 5-10 min for someone to notice and she came to our table to finally notice we told her more water she walked away w/ slight irritation and forgot to get our water.  I won't return i can go on more but i'm pretty sure this sums it all up.  She was lucky i didn't call the manager cause that day she should of learned a lesson but it was closing soon and i had a long day so the only thing I was thinking about was to go home.   FYI:  ""FISH & CHIPS=SALLLLLTYYYYYY"" if you want high blood pressure or diabetes go ahead and eat some fish & chips....yuckkkkk never again...basically there was more batter than the fish and to have it so damn SALTY that killed it...I said i wanted the fish NOT THE OCEAN WATER!!!!! good bye BJ's"
Rebecca O.,"Livermore, CA",13,15,12,4.0,1/16/2011,"the food was really good..i had the cajun pasta..my virgin mojito was kinda crappy..not worth 5 bucks. anyways, my friend's drink really sucked too, and the waitress forgot to get her another one. then when the bill came we were all figuring out how to split the bill and when the waitress walked by, she mugged us..ok...pshhh low tip for you lady! haha! anyways, the food was great, it's a nice place and i had a good time with my friends"
Chris B.,"Providence, RI",30,122,21,5.0,5/5/2010,"Great beer, attentive service. The flatbreads and the Porter are awesome!"
Bee O.,"Daly City, CA",50,22,8,5.0,3/16/2012,"Great food great service waitress mariana what awesome ,she knows her menu well.. We will come back"
Penguin S.,"Houston, TX",140,713,169,5.0,6/16/2009,"Always a great place to meet a friend or more for a bite to eat and a brew. The service is hit or miss, often it's a little slow, but other times just fine and always friendly.  I love their pizza. A favorite of mine is the half a baked potato and wedge salad at lunch. Everything I've had here is really good. For beer, I always get the Blonde, being a fan of Belgium style wheat beers. Never fails to quench! Anytime I'm meeting anyone for lunch and we can't decide on a place, I always suggest BJs. My only issue is that they often don't have servers for the outdoor seating area. But after ordering at the bar, someone will bring it out to you."
Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",315,377,127,3.0,4/1/2011,"$32 for Ahi Tuna salsa, CA Chicken sandwich and CA steak sandwich both comes with fries. Service was good."
Jennifer W.,"San Francisco, CA",217,7,,2.0,3/3/2012,"I'm only giving this place two stars because my waiter was nice. Other than that, I had a party of 10 and we waited for 2hours. Even then, we had to ask and annoy in order to get our table. When we finally got our table, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THREE OF THE PASTA ENTRIES. This place is ridiculous. I do not recommend coming here."
Frances L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,3.0,8/15/2012,"Definitely mixed reviews for this place. The wait time can be ridiculous depending on what time you go and also the day of the week, which is the main reason to why only 3 stars for BJ's. The call ahead ""no wait"" system they have only works if you have a party of 7, which most times we do not have that many. Even for a table of 2-4, it's about an hour wait! The food isn't bad and there are many options to choose from to conquer any craving. The pizookies are great too! Although this place is great, don't know if it's worth waiting hours for a table. I guess you can go shopping until the pager beeps."
Monica V.,"Valley Glen, CA",140,75,21,4.0,12/12/2011,Decent food. Decent service. I like the casual sports atmosphere. Ate in the bar area. No complaints.
Cher B.,"San Francisco, CA",23,63,,2.0,12/4/2009,"I've come to this BJ's twice...and twice too many!!! The first time I came here, I felt like we were on candid camera--the service was SO BAD.  we waited an hour and a half to be seated, we waited even longer after being seated bc the waitress kept forgetting our order, she made us feel awkward by blowing kisses at us (this isn't hooters!!!), food tasted BAD (it was like the toppings melted together and i didn't know what i was supposed to be eating), and by the end of the 3-1/2 hour debacle, we vowed never to return. fast forward 8 months later and there I am at BJ's again, waiting to be seated. we were literally the first customers there and still waited 10 minutes (i don't get it??).  the food was pretty bad.  My grandma called my pizza soggy, and that woman knows what's up!  The only reason I'm not giving it two stars is because the server was normal this time and my brother really liked his BBQ beef sandwich. I went to the BJ's in LA frequently and the service and food was always amazing. Maybe it's just BJ's San Bruno that sucks.  i am NOT coming back --for real this time!!!"
Joe V.,"Boston, MA",182,137,3,4.0,5/27/2012,This place is kind of on the hipster California-style places to eat. Food is good with a very large menu to please almost everyone. The environment is a bit noisy but still acceptable to me. Me likey!
Ann T.,"San Francisco, CA",376,350,2972,3.0,4/13/2011,service is just so-so... but they now serve gluten free pizza?! and it's delicious?! LOVE! berry burst cider is also a WIN!
