Mike D.,"Penngrove, CA",15,59,9,3.0,11/26/2011,"lunch is okay, the beer is okay, the food is overall okay. There is way better food in the area, Lucca sandwiches are incredible but have no seating... Good for having a bigger crowd. Sports are nice because of the amount and size of TVs. I do like beer and it is a bit of let down. The competition is tough in norcal... I think dinner here is over priced"
Serge K.,"San Bruno, CA",1,42,11,4.0,3/27/2010,"Great beers and beverages. I love their prime ribs and snack sampler. The lettuce wraps and their Pulled pork sliders are also delicious.  This is a popular place, so get used to stalking tables at the bar or be prepared for a 30 minute wait. The staff has always been friendly and will occasionally come around with appetizers while you're waiting."
Alice E.,"San Francisco, CA",146,407,28,1.0,4/26/2009,"Seriously?   Service was allllrrigghhhttt.  The servers seem overworked.  Maybe its a management thing - stretching their employees too thin.  /shrug Food was bleh. Mozz. cheese sticks - came out kinda cold so cheese was kinda hard. Garlic bread - overpriced for 4 pieces..  Shrimp Scampi - no flavor!  my bff didn't even eat 1/3 of it. Buffalo wings - my husband seemed to enjoy it. Fish n chips - batter wasn't fully cooked, leaving a nasty taste in my mouth.  also the fries weren't yummy :(  Def was not worth the money I slaved for lol.  I am NEVER coming back here... ever ever ever. I feel so strongly against it lol."
Mark L.,"San Francisco, CA",16,27,,1.0,5/3/2009,"I was looking for a nice beer and some good avacado egg rolls before a bit more shopping with the girlfriend so I suggested BJ's.  We walked in just before 5 PM and it wasn't that busy.  We sat down in the bar area, not in the middle but off to the side.  Clearly in the ""Do not serve"" zone. After 9 minutes and being walked past at least 8 times after we started counting, we walked out.  No one even said ""Thanks for coming in"" though that would have been a bit funny. BJ's in Cupertino is fairly good.  This branch is just cashing in."
Edward W.,"Cotati, CA",1,4,,1.0,5/16/2012,"Worst! Ordered all you can eat soup and salad, received 1 soup and 1 salad before our waiter disappeared for 25 minutes. Asked another waiter for refills, got the ""I'll let your server know"" line. After finally locating our waiter (my sister YELLED 'Hey dude!' across the restaurant to get his attention), he said he would be right back with refills. This never happened. The next time he appeared was when he was apologizing to the table next to us for mixing up their credit card with another table's and charging the wrong amount. He then asked them if it was OK if he left it that way! When he finally brought our check (still no refills), we insisted that he take the soup and salad off. He did, and also stated quote,""Sorry, I'm not a very good server."" LOL! He then reassured us that it was OK if we didn't leave a tip. Thank goodness... I was torn about that HA! This place blows."
R L.,"Millbrae, CA",0,13,2,2.0,2/8/2014,"I'm giving this a 2 star primarily because of their front of the house hosts.  We did a 'call ahead' for 2 people to avoid waiting since there was a 15 minutes wait.  When we got there 15 minutes later, they told us it's another 10-15 minutes.  10 minutes later, I asked how many more people ahead of us. I was told we would be next and to just wait until the pager go off.  We watch 6 more groups of 2 go, finally 15 minutes later we were called.   So lessons learned, just get there, get a pager an wait.  Don't bother calling.  The front hosts are rude and unorganized."
Lizzie C.,"San Mateo, CA",412,204,22,3.0,10/23/2008,"For being another generic restaurant chain, they sure have some good fucking appetizers. The chicken wings are only drizzled with sauce instead of doused in it so it's not as messy, but it's still really good. The nachos are good, too, and the pizza is okay. They have a pretty good lineup of beer as well. I really like their Oktoberfest beer. The only thing that keeps me from going here is that it gets pretty busy and often times there's a long wait. Though, they do have heated outdoor seating, and having a pitcher while sitting out on a [rare] warm Bay Area evening sounds pretty good right about now."
Melinda B.,"Daly City, CA",0,22,20,1.0,6/21/2012,I had a lunch and was totally disappointed. The pasta that  my nephew ordered was not al dente. I can cook much better pasta than the chef. Then my Fish was so dry and the bruschetta which I expected to be great just tasted plain. I think the chef located in Foster city is much better. The service was not great at all because the waitress did not even got my soda & told her to cancel it.
Colin P.,"San Francisco, CA",27,597,43,3.0,6/19/2012,Had bit of a wait for a Saturday night. Our dessert took awhile but was later comped. But the pizza was delicious. Friendly staff.
Lily S.,"San Francisco, CA",37,86,276,2.0,7/18/2009,The food at this location is Terrible .. We ordered fish N chips and the fish was raw in the inside!!! We were lucky we didn't get food poisoning ! We only come here if we are killing time waiting around for a movie @ the Century.. Get your buzz on.
Shermaine S.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/17/2012,"Never coming to this place again! After waiting half an hour to be seated, our waiter was rude and not a people person. She seated us and didn't ask for our drinks or anything. So we waited another 30min assuming she would come around and ask what drinks we wanted. But NO. We had to call her over.  The only good thing about this place is there pizookie. Its just as good as the cookies and creme. I highly recommend red velvet. Come here only if you want your time wasted, tasteless food, and slow service."
Chocoolate I.,"San Francisco, CA",0,468,752,3.0,6/12/2012,"Located in a newly remodeled mall, BJ's has a huge menu, tons of parking and televisions all around. This is a great place to see an important sporting event. The wings are great and, being a brewery, that have a great beer selection. The service can be a bit slow all things considered it is a great place to watch a game provided you show up early to get a seat."
Sam W.,"San Francisco, CA",44,122,,4.0,5/16/2009,"Came here quite a few times with my friends, and my most recent one was tonight! We had 8 people, and we waited for about 30 minutes. This is considered pretty short for BJ's.  I shared a large half/half pizza (Mediterranian and BJ Cheese Burger) with 2 other guys. I also shared a pitcher of beer (Cherry Burst Cider... this is really good! I recommend this!). The pizza here is always very flavorful and absolutely delicious. This time, we didn't order any appetizers, but their appetizers are generally pretty good too.  This is a sports bar/restaurant. So there are TV screens everywhere with sporting events. But, sometimes the wait can be really long. But if you can wait it out, I think the food and beer are worth it!"
Glenn L.,"San Ramon, CA",20,494,,4.0,10/11/2009,"Yeah I know it a full-on chain, but it is dependable.  I like the wings - juicy with  a slight drizzle of buffalo sauce and ranch.  Just realized I had not had their deep dish pizza in years.  We always lean towards appetizer fest - nachos, wings and a cold beer.  What else do you want? Oh, be sure to avoid this place Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights - just overrun with people."
Jean A.,"San Francisco, CA",148,192,,4.0,12/11/2008,"Going to chain restaurants after living in the city always seems like a sin.  But sometimes, when you need the dose of comfort, this is exactly what the doctor ordered ... and always enjoyable with good company.   BJ's is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the 'burbs after The E-Bar and Chevy's.  Much better than Chilli's and Friday's and millions times better than Applebee's.  I never bother waiting for a table at this place since the wait is always at least 45 minutes.  So we always end up gravitating towards the bar and try our best to bring out our vulture-like habits.  Works like a charm.   A few of my favs include the Spinach Artichoke Dip, their deep dish pizzas, grilled burger melt (not for the faint of heart), garden vegetable potato, and of course their pizookies!  The beer's are alright, nothing to rave about.  But definitely a step up from your typical 'burb restaurants.  Oh and did I mention, their service is great - quick, friendly, cuts to the chase - what I would expect."
Dana F.,"Pacifica, CA",0,38,,2.0,1/31/2011,"First off the food is usually excellent at this Bj's, so the cooks have it together here. More than can be said for other BJ's but what this place is lacking in is competent servers. The greeters are all very friendly and competent, but the servers are worthless. Thank god the food is not delivered by these morons or the food would always be ice cold.     This place can get pretty busy, but the only two things they do is take orders and serve drinks, thats it. And theres a dozen of them on the floor so they couldn't possibly have more than 5 tables each.     Every time I find myself with empty drinks, every time I find myself waiting eons for the check, or the check to return. Every time I start out planning on giving a 20% tip, but usually theres only a dollar or so left after put one, by one back in my purse for every minute watching the waitress pick her nose."
Jojo N.,"Pleasanton, CA",736,430,188,2.0,7/31/2010,"BF and I came here after he picked me up from SFO from my awesome VEGAS trip with my girls! Anywho, I was very disappointed at the food. The clam chowder was so salty, my sandwich was disgusting, and the only thing edible were my fries. BF wasn't impressed either. Wait, we did think the Oatmeal Pizooke was pretty decent. They also gave the pizookie for free since it was my birthday. :)"
Steph W.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,128,1,4.0,10/25/2008,"Mouth..drools..for..PIZOOKIE.  Okay, have to save the best for last. Must resist from writing a paper on the wonders of the pizookie. I've gone here a couple of times and I tend to always order the scampi pasta. I adore the bread crumbs they put on it and there's not that much sauce. Just the way I like it. And the noodles are thin and easily wrap around your fork. I've also had the grilled chicken pasta but the chicken is a bit dry for my taste.  Appetizers I've ordered are the chicken wings, mm mm good! Avocado wraps and the bruschetta were yummy too, but oh my god the deep dish pizza. To die for. I think that's the best pizza I've ever had. Beats Pizza Hut by a mile. Soft, fluffy, god goodness in a dish.  Okay, PIZOOKIE TIME. No matter how full I am, I always leave room for this gooey heaven. The chocolate is warm and soft and the vanilla ice cream just tops it off. Cold and warm mixed together. Can't go wrong. You have to, have to order it every time you come here.  Good service & athletic feel with all the sports games playing."
Misha F.,"San Francisco, CA",533,546,194,3.0,1/1/2009,"Uber crowded for the 10pm happy hour deal. Love their deep dish pizzas (BJ's Favorite), and the delciously fresh pizzokies (cookie topped with ice cream). The beer is good too!"
Rovie T.,"South San Francisco, CA",264,58,67,5.0,11/14/2008,I HART this place because: *Its one of the few that are still open when i get off work. *I welcome gluttony  when it comes to my thin-crust basil sausage pizza and berry cider. *One of the server (Reuben) looks like Jesus on dreadlocks. Luv it! *Manuel is the sweetest server because he held my money book when I left it. *Happy Hour late night  -nuff said
