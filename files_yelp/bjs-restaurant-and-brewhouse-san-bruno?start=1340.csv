Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",32,92,14,3.0,10/18/2009,"Still the same 3 stars. I came here again on my B day. I have to say when you go here for your b day. Things really do change. You get better service, no joke. well of course when it is your b day they give you a desert for free. I forgot what the name was, but it is ice cream on top of a cookie that just basically came out of the oven im guessing. but the custormer service was way better than before."
Allan M.,"San Francisco, CA",90,214,23,3.0,9/21/2008,"I'm usually pretty satisfied with BJ's...Yeah laugh it out! =] Seriously though, I enjoy eating here...but I feel like my experiences havn't been as great lately. Today, I went with my best friend, Helen V. She'll be a yelper soon! Anyways, our intention was to just come in for a pizookie and then walk around the mall. But we ended up ordering a few drinks and an appetizer, the tomato basil with Italian sausage thin crust pizza. We weren't really hungry...so that was good enough to munch on before we had our pizookie.  My problem tonight was that the service was a bit sketchy. We got a table in the ""open-bar"" area...so you don't have to wait. That's better than waiting 30 minutes for a regular table. But, I felt a bit neglected here. We ordered a half and half oatmeal raisin/chocolate chip pizookie at the beginning so that it would come out right after we finished our pizza...but I think she forgot to put in the order for it. Then when it came out...it wasn't what we ordered. I still ate it though because it was hella good.  I use to really enjoy the pizza's here...but I think that I'd rather stick to the privately owned joints around the city than to come here again."
Theresa A.,"CA, CA",16,34,1,2.0,10/8/2008,"Okay... I enjoy BJ's for the food and the company I come with. Apparently, I've come to the conclusion that this particular BJ's at Tanforan Mall HATES LARGE GROUPS.  I just can't seem to win.  I bring business, they don't want it.  I call for reservations and they tell me they either don't take reservations or they already have 2 -3 groups that are coming in that day... seriously?!?!  In always giving other people and establishments the benefit of the doubt, I decided to have dinner there with my cousins for my birthday. I walk in (knowingly that I may have to wait 1 - 1 1/2 for a table) and approach the hostess to put our name on the list for 8 people.  We tell the hostess and then she turns around and walks away without word... apparently she left to ask the manager on duty.  She comes back and tells us it will be a 3 HOUR WAIT for our table.  SERIOUSLY??? 3 HOURS??? end of story.. we left shocked and i called Foster City BJ's who were so much more accomodating (see my review on them) conclusion: go to this establishment if you are a party of 4 .. actually that may even be stretching it .."
Molly T.,"Oakland, CA",4,10,10,5.0,4/27/2011,"This is my all time favorite BJ's around! Why you ask? Well I'll tell you. It was my first BJ experience-which was only just a few weeks ago, sad I know- and I had the best time ever. The wait wasn't that long, just about 20 minutes. Once inside, you're greeted by the best staff ever! My waiter's name was Will that night, a handsome young gentlemen with blonde hair who thankfully assisted me in choosing my meal. It was his favorite, the Chardonnay shrimp pasta, I put all my faith into him and trust me I was not disappointed. Light, creamy and savory, the pasta was like heaven in my mouth. I also had the egg roll appetizer, which my best friend had picked and that was just wonderful! I was not dismayed by any wait time as it was speedy in my eyes and also I was occupied by the games on the various flat screens around the room. Then to top off the night, when I was already a plump marshmallow, dare I say it I had the pizookie. Half chocolate chip and half cookies nd cream(or Oreo I'm not sure what the difference in those terms are). It was the most amazing thing you could ever have in your mouth! I was just in euphoria from all its cookie, ice cream goodness. If you want good, filling food, this is the place to be! Thanks to Will and the Chef's of the night, I will see you guys again soon!"
Luis A.,"San Francisco, CA",2,16,,1.0,3/6/2014,"I came in today with a group of co-workers to celebrate my promotion. Now, I had been here before and had a great experience, however, this time it was not what I would expect. The staff sat us down, at first the server was great, he then had to take off for lunch so we were introduced to another server. This new server was bad. He ignored us for 15 minutes, until one of my co-workers got up to call him to our table. Before the food arrived, we, once again, tried to get his attention for drinks-- no luck. Once again, my co-worker gets up--success, drinks. After we finished our meals, we lingered and chatted. We asked for dessert menu, no luck. (How rude!?) Finally, my manager had had it! she asked for bill...it took about 15 minutes to get it. She was fed up, got up, and asked him for amount. He gave it to her, with a snarky attitude, she gave him exact change and we left. We did not even bother speaking with manager. I don't think I'll be returning anymore."

Mel R.,"Pacifica, CA",14,61,2,2.0,1/20/2009,"I CONSISTENTLY receive bad service here. I love BJs especially the locations in SoCal, but this San Bruno restaurant is by far the worse of the chain. I always think I go during an off or busy day, but NO - every time I go there's something wrong: the super long wait, the rude greeters who give attitude and don't know a thing about customer service, the inexperienced waiters who lie and mess up orders, the sub-par food quality that made me sick... I'm giving this an extra star because I know the menu offers great food. Too bad this location ruins the BJ's reputation. My suggestion?  Do yourself a favor and drive an extra 20 miles and visit the one in San Mateo."
Susan Y.,"Da’an District, Taiwan",240,358,544,3.0,7/16/2011,"I've come here multiple times but I haven't gotten around to reviewing until now. The first few times, service was great. Didn't need to wait too long for a table and the servers were very friendly and accommodating.  When I came here a few days ago... Not only was it unsatisfactory for me, but my friend was also irritated at how badly we were treated. The hostess said we'd wait around 25-30 minutes for a table. Okay, that was fine since it was around the dinner rush. We were given a pager and walked around in the mall for twenty minutes. We come back. Ask the hostess to see if they've called us, just to be sure. They haven't yet. We sit down on the booths provided for us, to wait. 45 minutes pass. Nothing. An hour pass. Something's wrong. Both me and my friend approach the hostess. APPARENTLY, they HAD called us. Uhm, no. The pager didn't vibrate or light up. She asks to check it and what do you know.. THE PAGER WORKS. Alright, strike one. You lied. We were seated quickly. Good. I ordered the creole tilapia with an iced tea and my friend got the flatbread pesto pizza with strawberry lemonade. It took the server about 10 minutes to come and take our order. And we got our food within the next twenty minutes. The food tasted amazing, which is why I'm not gonna give this place less than 3 stars. It's everything else that prevents me from giving a better star rating.  It almost 9p by the time we got our food so we pretty much ate everything within 10 minutes. Not once did the server ask us if our food was okay or if we wanted refills. I know we ate quickly, but seriously? Ridiculous."
Mark T.,"Millbrae, CA",185,102,7,2.0,2/22/2011,"All I can say is this restaurant is always so crowded and noisy and the service is mediocre.   If a table isn't available, which is often the case, they'll be happy to seat you in the bar area to eat where you'll then be forgotten about.  The food isn't much to brag about although the cocktails are good.   Just don't come here if you intend to eat and have conversation unless you enjoy yelling the entire time."
Judy K.,"San Francisco, CA",159,276,118,5.0,5/21/2009,"We come here often and it's turning into one of my favorite restaurants.  The service is always friendly & efficient and the food is much, much better than most chains- such as TGI Friday's and Applebee's, etc.   Order the BRUSCHETTA- although not traditional, their version is very good.  It helps that the bread is fresh baked.  I think they use their pizza dough.  Any of their PIZOOKIE desserts will NOT disappoint- although the Apple Crisp is surely the best one.  One PIZOOKIE is enough to feed at least a few people after a full meal.  Do try the BJ'S FAVORITE Pizza also! During peak dinner times on the weekends, it can take quite long to get a table but you can call ahead and still be placed on the waiting list.  Once you arrive, they give you a buzzer...we like to kill time at Barnes Noble."
Alma C.,"San Bruno, CA",22,28,5,4.0,12/20/2011,"I know it's a chain, but it so good! The mozzarella sticks could use a little more goo, but aside from that, I love this place. It's usually quite busy, especially during the holidays so definitely prepare to wait for a table. It's good, they have a lot of TV's and it's young. Happy Hour wine Tuesdays are good thing to have on your list of things to do during the week. Good stuff!"
Alex J.,"Daly City, CA",37,2,,1.0,2/2/2009,"In a way it is cruel to critically review a mid-tier causal dining place like this...kinda like booing at the Special Olympics, but these guys took an inordinate amount of my money, so I feel justified in exacting a little payback. It is hard to put the mediocrity of this place into words; in a genre of restaurant defined by the relentless pursuit of the lowest common denominator, BJs is the Platonic Archetype...the sort of place where you can hear 3 consecutive Smash Mouth songs...really. I happened to be at Tanforan and wanted a salad and my friend convinced me they were the only viable option, so in I go and am confronted by a menu that I can only assume was constructed by the culinary equivalent of madlibs , where ingredients are randomly juxtaposed (can you even taste aioli under bleu cheese?) (side note: Feta is apparently the new ""it-cheese"" of corporate executive chefs everywhere it was on at least one-third of the menu items, so some industrious sourcer must have hit the motherlode).   I choose the Garden Salad (w/o Feta) and for 4 bucks more I have them slap some flame-broiled Salmon on it (gots to get my Omega-3 on)...after what seems like 8 Nickelback songs later, the waiter finally shows up with my order and tells me it's because the salmon takes so long to cook (uh-oh!).  The Salad as it turned out was merely a low-tech delivery system for basalmic vinaigrette (I could have used a straw) and was nearly inedible. The staff was nice and the service was attentive (though no one was wearing enough flair for my money) although there was a weird interlude right before the check when my waiter noticed my fiddling with my iPhone and out of no where goes all Steve Jobs on me, demonstrating all the sweet apps he'd downloaded from the app store. Like I said, a bit unfair to hold a place like this to any sort of elevated standard, but when I get charged 13.50 for vinegar-logged lettuce and particle board salmon, I must raise a voice in objection."
Daniel A.,"Alameda, CA",7,471,8,1.0,10/31/2011,"The food is ok,  but the service has been terrible every time I have been there. I work in the service industry so I have a lot patients, but after coming here 3 different times, the servers just don't seem to care.  It's serving 101 to simply keep the drinks full and check up on your table at least once during the meal."
Kat N.,"San Mateo, CA",79,85,8,2.0,9/21/2011,"this review is mainly for the service, and not the food. bjs food is basically the same at every bjs, and sadly enough, so is the awful awful attitude of their employees.  i called ahead at 7pm, for a table for two. i spoke to a girl, didnt catch her name, she told me it would be 45-50 minutes. i walk in with my husband, exactly 43 minutes later, and i go to the host desk to check in. the asian girl (so so incredibly rude) tells me that ive only been waiting for about 20 minutes, and its still going to be another 30 minutes. I tell her, no, I called in 45 mins ago. she tells me well, you have only been in our system for 20. I pull out my phone, and i show her my timestamp. she says ""oh, well maybe one of our take out people took down your name and gave it to us 20 minutes late. your wait is still another 20-30 minutes.""  1. regardless of the fact that this situation is just plain stupid, the girl had the audacity to say ""you've only been waiting for 20. you still have another 30 ahead""    look, you are wrong. and not only are you wrong, you should have said something along the lines of ""im sorry ma'am, we show here you just checked in 20 minutes ago"" but instead she got super attitudey like i was being an obnoxious guest, pressuring them for a table.  she says theres nothing else she can do, gives me a pager, and tells me i have to wait another 20 minutes. fine. i take the pager, and sit down, very upset that this little biatch is speaking to me very rudely when a. i am the guest and b. i have already been walking around the mall for 45 mins waiting. i return to the host desk 20 minutes later, ive now waited an hour+ a few for a table for 2, when i was quoted 40-45 minutes. the SAME RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE asian girl says to me ""no one has been seated. there are still 12 people ahead of you."" now, I used to work for bjs, for 4 years. i started off as a host. I was a host before they had the computers to do all the math for them, i had to use my brain and estimate wait times myself, and coordinate tables and stagger seating myself. i also was one of the first people to use the new posi system for table management. i also was in take out, i was a server, and i was a trainer for all three departments. I KNOW HER JOB, IVE HAD HER JOB, AND I KNOW YOU DONT TALK TO GUESTS LIKE THAT.  but, far be it from me to say to her ""look bitch, i am the guest. the GUEST, not the customer, the GUEST"" instead i just bitched my husbands ear off and sat in the corner with a very upset look on my face furthermore, i know bjs is the type of corporate restaurant where you talk to a manager for one little thing, BAM free dessert or comped SOMETHING. but no, i didn't take advantage of that, i didnt throw this girl under the bus, i just silently stewed.  i am clearly irate at this point, and the girl is adamant about making me wait an hour and a half on a damn thursday for a table for 2. the very NICE girl behind her (tan, maybe hispanic girl, wearing glasses i think?) said ""we have a table, we can take her"" UH? HELLO? anyway, our server was great, she was like a robot, ""have you made your selections or would you like a few more minutes"" type thing, everything was to bjs fantastic corporate standards. food was bjs, and as usual, i tipped 25%, because, i know a server doesnt live off of compliments or warm fuzzies. heres a tip, hosts, you are the face of the restaurant. you are the first person the guest encounters during their meal. if you fucking piss them off with your snobby ass holier than thou attitude, you're just setting a bad tone for dinner, and a bad tone for your servers' tips. its customer service. expect to be shat on, expect to be treated poorly, by people many levels below your social class. but its your fucking job, do it right, be grateful you have a job in this economy, and try to keep it."
Danny C.,"Oakland, CA",225,43,2,3.0,9/20/2011,"I've always been a fan of BJ's. This one seems alright, but the past couple times I've come here the waiter has forgotten to give me the HH discount and needed to be corrected. Not that I blame them too much since it's always really busy."
Evan Y.,"San Bruno, CA",239,26,,5.0,10/21/2008,"I really love this place. Food is great, service is excellent and not to mention the wide variety of food. I love this place more then E-bar. Despite the long wait for a seat, they have many different kinds of options that you can do. You can call in for a table for 9 or less. You can actually set up a buffet if you have a party of 15 or more.  If you do not plan ahead like say 2 days ahead you'd probably end up waiting 2 hours for a big party. Overall, 10 or less you should be able to get seated within 1 hour depending on the night. This is the one of the  places I am willing to spend $40+ everytime I go there.  Great food, if you go and crave for monster dessert cold or warm, buy the Pizookie! Great place for beers, especially if its birthday and you want your friend to get effed up! :]"
Ryan D.,"Bellevue, WA",34,61,24,2.0,6/28/2009,"I'd say the place was about 75% full when I stopped in for dinner.  Server took my order and that was the last I saw of her the whole time I was there...  this was pretty bad as there was no sign of my order and my drink had gone empty after 30 minutes.  I was ignored for the whole time...  I should have napped.   My salad arrived after 45 minutes (on the dot).   The place was clean, outdoor seating available, TVs to watch while you wait forever, and the salad was good, so there's the 2 stars, but it was a salad and I was hungry before I decided to go to a restaurant. Your time is valuable...  I don't recommend eating here because I know you have important things to take care of."
bob l.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/7/2013,"This place is very disappointing to me. First off I called at exactly 7:00pm to prioritize my wait on a table for 7:30pm. I arrive on time and was told my table would be available in 15 minutes. I got a table at 8:30pm. I politely asked what was the point of calling in to reserve a table if I still have to wait an hr.  Then this coordinator girl ease drops on my conversation with a nice polite girl and explains to me why in a very rude way. I wasn't even talking to her in the first place. Then I sit down to eat and order a fried calamari that probably got reduce by 50 percent while charging the same price.  I know this cause I come often, twice a week at one point. Service is bad too. Never again !"
amelia g.,"San Francisco, CA",370,190,8,3.0,6/27/2011,"i've never had a bad experience here! the staff is always on point but the food is not consistent. sometimes it will come out super salty... and sometimes it comes out perfect. wtf!? buuuuuuttt!!!!... as for some plus's.... i usually order very specific things or ask for special instructions with my food and they put up with it every time. in fact.. they ENSURE that its exactly what i want before they bring it out to me... THAT my friend, is impeccable customer service! AND!.... their bbq chicken salad is always fresh, always delicious! definitely a pretty chill place to eat and drink."
Bobby T.,"Pittsburg, CA",78,122,86,5.0,8/6/2009,1. Pale Ale 2. Beer 3. Nachos 4. Deep Dish Chicken Pizza 5. Chicken Fried Steak 6. Pizooki! total: $75.00 with tip. and I tip BIG! Dinner with Boyfriend: Priceless The service here was impecable. The waitress was totally hitting on both of us.. it was kinda fun. Water was always filled. I love this place.
