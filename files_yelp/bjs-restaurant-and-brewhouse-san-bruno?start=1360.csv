Jennifer G.,"Alameda, CA",23,65,18,4.0,8/6/2011,"I've been to this location twice now the first time a 5 star the second more of a 3 star. Great Place to watch The SF Giants Games! The first time: We got seated and our server was super nice and honest about what dishes he liked and why (always a plus) then after our drinks arrived he was going on his break and the server who was covering his tables was also a really nice. There cream soda (w/free refills) are so yummy and comes in a frosty mug. I had ordered a crispy chicken salad w/honey mustard dressing it was HUGE but sadly my leftover didn't hold up because of it being mostly iceberg lettuce and a lot of dressing...next time I decide to order this I will ask for it on the side. Also there Pizzokie (pizza-cookie) the red velvet w/white chips and a scoop of vanilla yum.  The second time I came here for dinner: while waiting one of the staff came around and was offering pizza...um okay...Mmm yummy well that was my appetizer. Got seated  server seemed to have other things on her mind since she kept looking away while we asked questions, got the orange soda this time since it looked yummy the last time...it came in a mug but wasn't cold and they don't put ice in the sodas. I got a side salad to start and two small plates the fried Artichoke hearts and The Mac and Cheese...lets just say I don't remember on the menu that there was bacon in the Mac and Cheese...that was only in the bottom of the dish slightly cooked :/ gross! But more leftovers to take home on Bart is always a good thing :)"
Angel G.,"Union City, CA",227,205,122,1.0,9/6/2010,"oh dear God...I drove up & thought to myself let me give this a try again!  we got here and told the hostess  ""5 including a baby""  she said no ""4 he doesn't count"" i was like well he's human! so he should!  hostess:""we have a table but you have to leave the stroller up front""  me: ummm no i'm not hostess-well you can wait for a table me: whatever are you gonna replace this stroller if it gets stolen?   hostess-no it's your responsibility me-well i'll just take it hostess-you can't there's no room, the table is high, so i'll give you a booster seat for the baby me: ugggggggg we get to the table & ordered.  our drinks came & there was stuff floating in our drinks. FAIL we are still waiting...more than 40 minutes later, our food arrives.  it was ok. i forgot to add...the booster chair she brought was crap! my kid is 17 months old so he moves a lot...i mean a lot! the kid kept slipping from under the table because this crappy booster seat doesn't have a belt!  it's my daughters birthday so i ask for a pzookie with a candle & she brings it...too bad my daughter was at the bathroom.  after WE sang happy birthday we get the pzookie & the damn thing was ROCK hard AGAIN! major extreme FAIL!  never again will i come back to this place!"
R M.,"San Bruno, CA",1,15,,1.0,8/14/2014,"I am giving this restaurant 1 star because two times in the past month my service was terrible. When I went about 3 weeks ago i got a cheeseburger and it was very good but the fries were cold -_- both me and my friend asked for ranch 2-3 times to 2 DIFFERENT waiters and after 15-20 minutes we received it. that forced us to only leave a very small tip. Thinking I would have a better experience I returned today. I ordered a half sandwich/soup combo. I received my sandwhich eat before the soup ( I thought it makes more sense to bring soup first) and also again the fries were cold. So when I ask for ranch this time tell me why it was THE SAME SITUATION?? literally asked 2 different waiters for ranch 2-3 times and took around 10 minutes, they did a lil better. When I told her I never received my ranch she didn't seem to care and said, 'ok I'll get it now' and she wasn't on game with my refills either. this time again, very little tip left and i will most likely not eat here again.."
Andrew B.,"San Francisco, CA",78,103,,5.0,1/18/2012,"Seriously, what's not to love about this place, especially the post-9PM happy hour?!?! I do love BJs Brewhouse. They have great beer, good drinks, and amazing happy hour (mini pizza, mmm). I've been there with friends weekly for several weeks now and love it. The great white is my favorite, it's chicken Alfredo pizza. The only advice I'd give is to avoid the patio. The servers only seem to come around on occasion, and I think it's the ""you're stuck with the patio"" kinda thing, so they're usually not friendly like you get inside. Maybe it was just a couple bad experiences for me, but just an observation. All in all, this is one of my favorite happy hours in the burbs, so I highly recommend both the drinks and the food. And it's a lot of fun. If you're a sports fan you'll love the place too, I'm not so it''s not a big deal to me."
Meesh K.,"San Francisco, CA",122,174,34,1.0,9/24/2008,"Had a brain fart after my hand and ass clenching experience at the dentist the other day.  Hours after starving myself and starting to come off the numbing lidocaine, for SOME reason I was like, ""Screw it, BJs it is"".  And BTW, Tanforan Park Mall...with all the renovations and big sparkly lights...it's still a joke (Except for ULTA, I can dig that).  Even my fiance was like, ""Really?""  I must have been trippen, had a quick mental image of a great cheeseburger, or something.  I didn't even order one.  To tell you the truth, the sandwich and soup lunch combo is worth it.  I actually liked the clam chowder, and turkey club with thin fries.  Our waiter was what friggin pissed me off, and I didn't even get his name.  You know why? Because we BARELY saw him.  He took our order, and pretty much delivered our check, and that was about it.  Other workers were serving us, and tending to us (Thank you, nice, non-neglecting workers).  Our waiter seated another couple AFTER us and they were served food BEFORE us.  Decent grub, but shitty service.  I don't think I'd even want to go back after that.   Pizookie-shmazookie.  Go to Lucky's and buy some cookie dough, and vanilla ice cream.  Head over to Bed Bath and Beyond, and buy a small, shallow, metal baking pan.  Stuff the pan with your cookie dough, bake at 375-400 degrees for 10 minutes.  Pull it out, scoop ice cream on that bitch.  Serve it up to the homies, and watch them oooh and ahhh.  THERE YOU GO, I just saved you a really crappy trip to BJs."
Maggie H.,"San Francisco, CA",213,97,4,4.0,6/9/2009,"The food is consistant and reasonably priced. The wait (if I could underline, I would underline WAIT) staff is always friendly, which means the hostess' always seem to have a huge chip off (on?) their shoulder. (The phrase kinda of slips my mind at this time... ha.) The wait for a table is a nightmare but time can pass by quickly if you are with good company. The happy hour starts at 10:30PM and appetizers and pizzas become pretty cheap. And make sure you save room for a pazookie, mmm."
Nha H.,"Antioch, CA",319,248,58,5.0,5/4/2011,"5 stars for great service. I normally don't like Bjs because they don't have great food selections and service is blah, but this location is great. My friends ordered a pizza and our waiter caught it right away that the pizza that came out was incorrect and even the manager came out to offer free soup or salad while we waited. That's the type of service that deserves to be recognized for."
David M.,"San Francisco, CA",22,26,4,2.0,9/28/2011,"came here on a monday, server forgot to give us utensils, gave us the wrong deep dish pizza we ordered, had to ask for napkins since we didnt have utensils and gave us some after like 30 mins. ordered ribs, dry not as good either. btw ordered Italian sausage with mushrooms deep dish, instead we got italian sausage with tomato deep dish, was good but prefered what we.did order."
Mikhaila A.,"Los Gatos, CA",2,217,27,2.0,4/24/2009,"This is just a review on the service...other than this, BJ's food has always been great and yummy..but the service here is terrible!  I've come here multiple times and always think I'll be greeted by a friendly waiter..but no. The other day I came in with the bf and we ordered a salad and a burger..He asked for the 1000 island dressing that came with the burger on the side.  We got our food and his burger had the dressing on it and when I told our waiter, he was totally unapologetic and acted as if we didn't tell him when he probably forgot...It took 10 minutes for a new burger. And thennn, he never checked with us to see if our food was okay or if we needed more water (which we did). And as a waiter, the rule of thumb is either ""two bites or two minutes"" meaning check in with your table asap and he didn't...And we were never given any silverware so I had to hunt down other waiters for that. Boo.  Our food was good though, I really wish BJ's corp or higher authorities could hire more efficient people to accompany their great food."
Deborah V.,"Emeryville, CA",41,77,32,5.0,9/9/2010,Went with UCSF last Thursday and I introduced everyone to the wings...After 6 orders I say they're hooked!!!
Judd H.,"South San Francisco, CA",29,38,,3.0,2/5/2009,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewery has become somewhat of a stomping grounds for me and my cronies, but the question is why? BJ's is located on the outside of the futuristic looking Tanforan mall. You will know you have found BJ's when you see what looks like a poor mans spaceship, if you see a legit spaceship you have probably walked to far (New Mexico). Now the service really depends on what time you get there. If you get their at prime times, you'll be seated promptly and taken good care of, and by prime time i'm thinking 7pm to 7:03pm. The service here is pretty poor. I've actually got my meal and desert and check before I even to a glass of water, amazing right? Now the food is pretty good, I mean nothing outstanding just good. However, the prices are quite ridiculous. Pasta is at least 12 dollars (you can get a way better pasta for that price almost anywhere else). Appetizers are at least 10 bucks (other than the wings you are being ripped off), basically you are paying for somewhat high class food but receiving low brow hobo food. Now I posed the question how has this establishment became a common stomping grounds for my cronies and I, well one reason is it opens late, but there is another reason. The same reason why i've given this place 3 stars instead of negative 2. Every weekday night from 10pm to close BJ's has a special, a happy special, where for those 4 hours everyone is happy, and joyful, and and the costumers are happy because of this special, I forget the name, but I think its called ""10pm to Closing costumer joyful hours"". Whatever the name is, it is awesome Mini Pizzas prices are 50 percent off (still amazingly it cost 43 dollars), appetizers are 2 dollars off, and beer is also 1 to 2 dollars off. However you have to sit at the bar or bar area to receive this behemoth of a discount.  All in All BJ's sucks for like  10 of the 14 hours it opens, the other 4 hours are Meh..."
Brian J.,"San Francisco, CA",12,13,,4.0,2/2/2015,"i was pleased with the food but i don't feel they lived up to their ""name"" with the rest of the ""services"" they provided...."
Gustavo C.,"South San Francisco, CA",108,63,3,3.0,6/27/2011,Good beer/drinks and atmosphere if you just wanna kick back and grab a quick bite. Food is nothing special though. Friday and Saturday nights can get kinda busy so make a reservation to be safe ;-)
Csndra L.,"Anaheim, CA",5,93,2,1.0,8/5/2008,"Alright so I'm sitting here right by the bar at the moment, service at first was efficient until we finished our appetizers. Although I did wait 5 minutes for my fucking shirley temple..ANOTHER waiter brought it out. Our waitress gave us our check and we ordered a pizza that we never got and it wasn't even on the bill, so we flagged her over here and we complained about it. Not admitting at fault, she makes up this bullshit that she couldn't hear us ordering a pizza when she took our orders. Ok so when we got the manager, he gave us a complementary courtesy card worth $25. Then he even said he'll pack the pizza on the house with no charge, I was thinking ""hmm how redeeming of him giving us free pizza."".....but it was too fucking good to be true, I got home and I was gonna have a slice when I notice the damn thing wasn't even cut. How annoying...."
Elliot Y.,"San Jose, CA",109,211,103,3.0,4/7/2009,"Tell me why there is always a waiting list for this place even though there are tables/booths that are empty.  Standard answer 15 mins - 45 mins eh?  Good thing there is a shopping mall to walk around at while they set up the empty tables.   The food here is ok.  I ordered the ribs, for few dollars more you can have a full rack plus a side!  A meal here is not complete without a beer.  The appetizers are standard and worth it to share with a group of friends. Plus stars for the interior and exterior decor!"
Deborah A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/15/2011,"1st and foremost the service SUCKS!!!! So I came here for my brothers birthday with my family. The wait was about 25min it looked busy but for 25min. why not wait. Anyways after we were sat we waited about 15min for the waitress to come. Finally the waitress came, introduced herself took our drink orders, went to get our drinks came back took our order and everything was fine until she let us know she was going to go on her break.   Well, she went on her break and the server that was suppose to take over never came to introduced herself or anything! Plus she had a horrible attitude prob. All she did was drop off our food and walked away never came back to check on us not once! 15min. went by and still no one came to check if we were ok or if we needed any refills etc. When my father wanted to order another beer and I wanted to ask for a glass of water we waited until one of the servers walked by and actually paid attention to us to actually help us.  20min after we had already finished with dinner  the server came to the table dropped the check didn't say anything and walked off! Didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything just dropped the check off and walked off with a stupid bitter look on her face! At this point I was upset and mind you I am server myself and I understand that when you're busy, you're busy but at least ask one of your coworkers to check on your table if you cant.  I went to talk to the manager and explained to him what had happened and that was a mistake. When I told him that I understood the restaurant was busy his response was ""we're not even busy it's pretty slow"" needless to say I became livid!!! If its not slow then why the f*ck is the service so shitty???? He offered to discount the bill but at this point I just wanted to leave and did not want to wait another 30 minutes for my bill. I just wanted to get the f*ck out of there and go home. He ended up discounting the bill.  The server was lucky I left a damn tip but I wasn't going leave without A.writing on the check how much she f*cking sucked so she can read it and B. telling her to her face that she fucking sucked and that she was lucky i still left her a f*cking tip. 15% grat too!!  Never again will i come back! food was decent service was SHIT!!!! 2stars only because the food was decent."
Christina D.,"San Francisco, CA",13,45,,4.0,5/31/2008,"Let's be fair, while you might always have to wait for hours on weekends to get a seat at BJ's (in our case, the server told us THREE hours for a table of 8), which chain restaurant doesn't?  We don't go to chains for top notch service, we go because when you don't feel adventurous to try a new place, you always know what you're getting here.   BJ's is one of my TOP TOP favorite chain restaurants.  Good atmosphere, awesome beer & drinks, and even better food.  I LOVE their deep dish pizza: order the works or BBQ chicken and you won't be sorry.  The crust is so moist and soft, and the stuff on top complements each other perfectly.  I'd take that over many sworn by pizza joints in SF like Amici's anyday.   The best way to enjoy this place is to go with a group of 4-5, find a seat at the bar area so you can avoid the hour long wait of the restaurant, and share a pizza with several appetizers follow by the famous pazookie.  The appetizer that I absolutely love is the chicken wings, comes with 8-10 wings drizzled in ranch and hot sauce; crispy hot and juicy, yum!.  The pazookie never intrigued me as much, but you should give it a try.  C'mon, we can all ovenbake a cookie and top it with some ice cream, doesn't take a genius to make.   Lastly, they have a great happy hour from 3-7p M-Thur.  1/2 off on mini pizzas, and some discounts on appetizers and beer."
Terry S.,"San Francisco, CA",18,108,2,3.0,3/30/2011,"I love going here, the food could be better. But i definitely like the appetizers and who can deny the pizookies?"
Yen C.,"Oakland, CA",155,121,2,3.0,4/30/2011,"came here with bf and a few friends.  it was a nice day out so we sat outside, but it got a bit windy. anywho, service took FOREVER.  we asked to get new glasses for our pitcher of beer because the ones we received were dirty.  waiter goes on to say that the reason why it looks dirty was due to the dishwashing liquid.  however, i had to point out that there was some leftover food on the glasses.  ew!  although the food usually is always good...i always have to mark them down for their service and non-cleanliness of the dishes."
Mark Q.,"San Jose, CA",77,66,30,2.0,6/11/2009,"Casual dining with a nice cold glass of beer but nothing special. Menu: Wide range of appetizers, BJs Pizzas, pasta dishes, GIANT baked potato and burgers. I always go with the deep dish BJs Pizzas. The great white is my favorite. The food is good and nothing fancy about it. Portions are big especially if you get the baked potatoes.  Drinks Wide selection of beer from ales, lager, to stouts. Small wine selection. If your not sure what beer to get, order the beer sampler.  Service: I've been to this BJs several times (5+) and each time the service has been lousy! The service is slow, they don't check on you, the food took too long, servers didn't take our order in a timely matter, or our drinks were never refilled. I'd give this place 3 starts but the service brings it down to a 2.  Location: Adjacent to the Tanforan mall. Ambiance:  Very casual sports bar look with a couple big screen TVs in the bar area. Great place for a casual group lunch or dinner."
