Sam T.,"San Francisco, CA",221,367,217,4.0,6/9/2008,"It is incredible how many LA sports fans show up during big sporting events. The Lakers, Dodgers and even Angels?  I thought the Angels were the other other LA baseball team.  Crazy how many Angels fans popped up during the World Series. That being said... That also goes for all the New York and Boston fans. I enjoy grabbing something to eat at BJ's because I can hang out at the bar area and catch a game on one of their many tvs. Much like Elephant Bar, I do not come for fine dining.  I come for some drinks, brew, fries, wings, chips, burgers... while I can cheer on the Warriors, Giants, & Niners!"
April D.,"Oakland, CA",78,368,6,4.0,2/13/2009,"So maybe the deep dishes here are not classic Chicago style, but they're still pretty dang good. I really like the buffalo chicken pizza. Mmmmm. And the pazookies are good too. I mean they're nothing that extraordinary, but a big ole cookie in a little pie pan with a scoop of ice cream on it is a cute idea for a dessert and it's yummy. I like the feel of the place too. You get the warm family vibe, but with much more appeal than Denny's, IHOP, or Lyons. Most likely because BJs got the booze."
Tanya P.,"Lafayette, CA",340,857,82,3.0,7/29/2008,Beer is the most interesting thing here. And looks like the space can be converted for office parties. Food is all over the map but the most reliable choice in the area. Loads of healthier options if you don't want the battered and fried. Have yet to experience a perfect ordering and receiving experience but staff is very efficient and friendly and eager to help.
Mashimaro M.,"San Francisco, CA",12,234,6,5.0,3/2/2011,"I know that they are all chains but I prefer this location. The staff is a lot friendlier and it's less crowded. This last visit, all we did was order tons and tons of appetizers at the Bar. We wanted to try a bit of everything so the 4 of us ate $100.00 of appetizers alone. LoL."
Bubba L.,"Belmont, CA",60,22,12,4.0,9/30/2011,"The wait here is usually long round dinner time but the servers are always very friendly and polite. I have three children and Bj's always has a booster or high chairs available. The menu is growing and the beer is good. The tv's are always tuned to multiple sports so waiting on your food isn't as big a deal as other places. I love the wedge cut fries and sandwiches, I also recommend the parmisian crusted chicken! The loaded baked potato is a little big but decent. My family and I enjoy Bj's when we have the time to wait."
Diane M.,"San Francisco, CA",1658,405,2872,2.0,8/30/2008,There really is nothing great about this place. It's just a typical chain with mediocre food and service. It seriously is a place to go if you happen to be in the area. You seriously are better off at either the Olive Garden or Red Lobster. Better food at similar prices.
Katelynn L.,"San Francisco, CA",74,406,889,4.0,3/7/2009,"I highly recommend calling in to put your name on the list, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  It's usually an hour to an hour and a half wait but at least you can be doing something fun while you wait instead of hearing everyone at the restaurant b*tch and whine about how long the wait is. I came here with my boyfriend last night because I was craving some Chicago deep dish pizza and theirs is pretty darn good.  We got a large pie (half Mediterranean and half Great White) as well as the soup and salad combo (we chose the clam chowder and Caesar salad).  Their pizza really hits the spot.  The crust is amazing ~ very crispy and not doughy at all.  The clam chowder was also surprisingly good...actually better than a lot of the ones I've tried at other places.  The Caesar salad was okay...you can't really screw that up. All in all, it was a pretty good dining experience.  Our server was nice and checked in with us at the right times.  But the service there is really hit or miss.  I've had some not so great service from them before (i.e. our server would forget to bring us stuff, or they would disappear for 10 minutes before finally getting us what we want). Oh yea...you have to try their pizookies.  Who doesn't love a fresh baked cookie with ice cream?  But if you're watching your diet, then skip dessert at BJ's and head on over to Orange Tree for some fat free fro-yo ;)"
Attila H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/29/2010,Placed an order online and when I got there to pick it up I found that they messed it up. Thanks BJs!
Eudora Z.,"San Francisco, CA",224,52,26,4.0,7/24/2010,"Always a good place to hang out and relax with some friends while eating and drinking. Friend of mine needed to relax and drink away all her stress and problems; Thus, I suggested BJ's.  Beer + cocktail drink + thin-sliced pizza + appetizer= great afternoon lunch. If I were given a choice, I'd choose B.J.'s over Elephant Bar."
Angela H.,"Daly City, CA",119,497,,2.0,3/28/2008,"I don't know why and how I got the impression that I would be getting Chicago-style pizza from BJ's, but I did and I was super disappointed to have got what I did during a lunch there.  Though they promised ""a culinary masterpiece"", what I got instead was a humdrum, run-of-the-mill pizza. I decided to go with a BJ's Favorite mini pizza, which was $8.90 for a lunch portion- a little steep considering that it wasn't that much different from the pan pizzas I could get at Target's Pizza Hut Express.  Unfortunately, the crust was pretty greasy and unappetizing.  I thought that perhaps the toppings (meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and fresh tomato) would help, but they didn't because there wasn't all that much of them.  There wasn't enough sauce and the cheese wasn't completely melted.  Ughh... I wouldn't be back for the pizza, but I may be for other items on the menu.  The burgers looked good..."
Leah A.,"San Diego, CA",206,104,19,4.0,4/9/2011,"I like going to BJs because they have good deep dish and I love love love their Pazookie's.  This location also has tons of TVs for you sports fans out there and their beer that they brew is really good also.  However, the main reason why I won't give them 5 stars is because for this location...i'm not a fan.  I personally don't like having such a huge crowd because of the mall.  The location is convenient for where I live but I prefer some of the other locations that they have."
Yanni Z.,"Daly City, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/16/2012,"Well, the reason I gave this place a 1 star because I got food poisoned by their food.  I ate burger pizza, spegghi.  Mostly I believe it's their can tomato coz both of them have tomato.  I felt dizzy and throwed up later.  Headache whole day the next day."
Leslie K.,"San Francisco, CA",230,102,4,2.0,3/31/2010,"I've had my BJ's cherry popped at this location and like many people and their first time, it could be looked back on as an unpleasant experience. The first time it was a crowded afternoon and of course, I didn't mind waiting for a table because it is expected of popular chain restaurants like these. My friends and I were finally seated and more than ready to order. Our server comes and he looks less than enthusiastic to serve us. We're an understanding bunch and we know that it was probably an overwhelming day for all the servers, but would it hurt to not look like you just want to get the hell out of there? Anyway, we ordered some fries, honey chicken salad, a pizookie and consulted him about one of the dishes on the menu because my friend, who has zero tolerance for anything spicy, asks him about a dish and how spicy it is. He says that it's not spicy at all and of course, we trusted the guy. The time comes for our dishes which were to say the least alright. I'll admit, I had high expectations for a place this popular but I would compare my chicken salad to something I would get at Applebee's. Not that great. My friend gets her appetizer that is supposedly not spicy. She tried it and her face dropped. The appetizer wasn't as mild as we were told. I tried it as well and I love spicy food, so when I tasted it I knew my friend couldn't handle it at all. Strike two against the server. I think the only redeeming quality of our meal was the pizookie which you can't really mess up. After we were done with our meal, it took forever for our server to come back to us with the check. We paid and I thought that the first time shouldn't make me hate the place. But the second time I came back to this establishment, they did not redeem themselves. The second time I went here was for my roommate's birthday. We were a huge party of 14 and they had reservations for us. It took awhile for us to get seated. Understandable. Until we realized the place was slightly more empty than expected and there were a couple tables available. Then we were finally seated and lo and behold, the same server from the first time I came to BJ's is serving us. He took our orders, which most of us had the same choice (Chicken parmesan) and my friend and I had the chicken fried steak. After some waiting, all of us got our orders at the same time. All of us except me. I thought, oh okay, it's a steak, maybe it's taking a little longer than usual. Then I notice oe of the food servers was looking over our table and noticed my ""WTF where the f*** is my order?"" look. Our main server comes over and asks what I ordered. ""Chicken fried steak."" ""Oh, okay. *has an OH SHIT look on his face*"". So it turns out that he didn't write down my order. Okay, so you wrote down 1 chicken fried steak even though we specifically ordered 2? Wow. Awesome. He asks if I would like a soup or salad while I'm waiting. And pay for an additional order while I should be enjoying my main dish? Thanks, but I'll pass. So my order comes in, fresh off the grill and I can tell it was made in panic. At that point I was pissed off and didn't really enjoy my meal. I ate most of it because I was hungry and saved my appetite for that night. We got our checks and he had this idea to split the checks into 2 separate tables in order for it to be easier for us to pay. Also, that DOUBLED the gratuity for himself. Smooth move. I was just glad to get out of there and go home after that. Needless to say, that was the second and definitely the LAST time I'll ever go to that BJ's."
Paul J G.,"San Francisco, CA",47,39,9,2.0,6/22/2009,"THIS PLACE SUCKS... No pun intended.   These two stars are meant to be a solid 1.5 (they have nice art deco train paintings... And ok beer). Servers are career sh!t head service people who think they're in the movie Waiting... I have huge respect for servers and the Food industry, this place doesn't get it... Will be back if I'm in the mall and I want a beer at 10am... Once again, this place blows...  No pun intended."
LovesToEat S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,55,,1.0,11/8/2011,"I don't know what it is about this restaurant as a whole, but the service all the way down to the chefs who cook, really show that they don't care about their work.  They are only there for their own benefit which is...*it's only a job that pays my bills*.  Come on...we're pretty much all in that situation, and this specific restaurant brings down the BJ reputation. I'm not gonna trash talk the bad experiences I've had at this specific restaurant, but I'll tell you this.  I would ONLY EAT at this restaurant if someone Paid me. The only item I'll eat that I KNOW they can't mess up on is their pizookie."
Cindy G.,"South San Francisco, CA",9,27,4,3.0,7/27/2009,"This place is always packed. When I don't feel like dealing with the parking and traffic woes of SF, BJs is a good alternative for some food and drinks at the bar, especially during happy hour when you get more bang for your buck. They also have a heated outdoor patio with a fire pit for those sunnier days, which don't come often enough in San Bruno.  I usually order a bunch of items from their appetizer menu to have with a Nutty Brunette (she's my beer of choice there). Their chicken wings are the best. The sliders are good too, even better with cheese and bacon. I also like their chicken wrap, but be careful with the horseradish sauce. It looked like some kind of mustard sauce so I poured a generous amount onto my wrap, which gave it so much kick that it brought tears to my eyes. If you have a bigger appetite, you can't go wrong with their pizzas. SO good. I just wish their entrees were better. Oh, if you do get dessert, try the pizzookie. It's a giant chocolate chip cookie in a pan straight out the oven. Pretty darn good, but then again, I'm a sucker for warm chocolate chip cookies."
Steven T.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/3/2014,"Worse experience ever, went here with my brother for lunch before we go shopping and i regret it terribly. We got seated right away, but we waited 20 minute for our waiter to come take our order or at least take down our drinks, but no one came. We ended up having to ask the host who our waiter was, waited another 5 min and we were just fed up and was about to walk out when the manager came by and apologized and he didn't even know what was going on, we ended up ordering here, we were hungry and didn't want to look for somewhere else to eat. I ordered a ahi tuna salad and a drink and my brother ordered a crusted chicken dish with soda,  he tried offering us appetizers but i didn't want any. We waited for about 15 minute for our food to come, while i waited i see the manager chatting it up with the waiters and waitresses near the computer where they input orders. I was disappointed i paid 15 bucks for a plate of crap..i literally got a plate of salad with maybe 2-3 piece of ahi tuna which was covered in tons of wasabi and the size of a quarter, it literally looked like i got scraps of whats left over, the whole plate was loaded with fried oily crisp, and throughout the whole time we still had no waiter. We ended up paying full price for our food. Lets just say..this is the last i will ever eat here."
ally o.,"San Francisco, CA",12,165,3,1.0,3/12/2010,"i don't know what was up with our waiter when i went. he spent more time trying to flirt with the ladies than wait on tables. i happened to be here in a group of four (two couples) and it took close to half an hour before our waiter picked up our check that was ready to be paid for. there happened to be a table of ladies next to us who were tended to for a good 15 minutes.  it was as if the waiter was expecting to get laid that very second.  to top that off, he was also trying to holler at his female co-workers with shoulder massages while they had no choice but to endure it as they were cornered while ringing up bills for their tables at the register. those poor female employees. subjected to his touchy feel-y antics while at work.  hey waiter named EDWIN O. - you have NO GAME. females talk to you because they want to ORDER food.  i unfortunately witnessed it the entire time i was there while you chased after ladies pathetically. i'm sure the manager of bj's brewery enjoyed my table lamenting about the horrible service and how his employees should be re-trained and/or demoted to another position."
O'Shea J.,"San Francisco, CA",32,162,6,1.0,9/17/2008,"""I've never had anything good at BJ's."" That's what I always say when someone suggests going here.  Been here 4-5x and not once has my meal been any good.  They have a good selection of beer, I'll give em that.  The pizookie also gets two thumbs up but do yourself a favor, eat elsewhere and tell your friends you'll meet them there after for drinks."
Karen K.,"San Francisco, CA",428,215,1,2.0,2/20/2008,Uh I went to BJ's expecting a good time and when I got there I realized it was a restaurant? Mutha... The only good thing about this place is the name. EDIT: this was written by my friend Jeanette C. when I wusn't lookin' earlier on dis fairest of eves:(  I'll keep it here in memory of our new rattails...
