Bruce B.,"Armona, CA",0,25,6,1.0,8/28/2017,"Horrible. Small tables, lousy service. The waiter was slow. I had to ask for a refill of my Pepsi. Both glasses were watery.  I asked if my lunch was ready when he brought my refill. He brought it out. It could have been good. Portion size was small. Food was cold. I have eaten at BJ's in Sacramento. That was a superb restaurant. This one was poor. I am sad I wasted my appetite on this place when I had so many choices. I did not think it was real busy but it tool a half hour for a refill and over an hour for 2 tacos. After receiving the response from general manager ochoa, I read through other reviews. Sad to say, many other people had similar results at this BJ's. I see that Mr ochoa likes to give a form letter response to bad reviews. Not very professional or caring.   He acted much like his employees. Hmmm."
Hnin T.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,2,,1.0,9/11/2017,"Went for lunch on 09/03 mainly for strawberry margarita.  After 25 min we got some fries & salad but no drinks.  Check with our waiter and said someone from the bar will bring it.  It's for him to go & get our drinks.  When we got it the frozen margarita is already melted.  We told the waiter, he went to get and added more shaved ice.  We said it was not the margarita taste.  He said he will get us the new one & didn't get at all.  Pizza was cold also.  Never had that bad experience before.  When the bill came they charged for the drinks and we pointed out for the charge for the drinks. Bad.. really bad service."
Merrick W.,"Pacifica, CA",16,166,6,3.0,6/3/2016,"I understand the lack of enthusiasm for this place -- it's because of the lack of enthusiasm from its kitchen.  The hostess was great,very friendly and helpful and got me a great table.  Took a bit for my server to ask for drink order, but that's ok, she made it up in friendliness and great service, and was pretty prompt in getting my order. Ordered soup and entree salad -- only problem was that salad came out first -- pretty quick, which I appreciate, but the cup of soup should have been first and I had to WAIT on that.   To me, kitchen's fault more than server's.  When I finally got the soup, it was lukewarm.   I told server not to remake, just nuke.  Got the soup and it was good. Then tackled the Asian Chopped Salad, which had been sitting on the table all this time and although great ingredients, it was pretty uninspired.  It just had no kick to it like other salads of this kind, and the chicken was just OK, like it had been sitting around all day and was thrown in the salad, not fresh.  And that's the thing -- the whole salad was missing freshness. I really think you guys (BJs mgmt) need to take another look at how things are prepared in the kitchen, how incoming orders are processed, etc.  I don't see the problem as much being the servers and everyone in front of house, who are all working their butts off, as much as those in the kitchen and back of house -- maybe they don't have enough support? Excellent menu, so BJs does got it going there, but the operation of it all really needs a looking at and an overhaul."
Ana H.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/6/2017,"Amazing service from Jocelyn and Rhaliza , food came out super fast , strawberry margarita was so good ! Manager Rochelle super nice ! Definitely recommend this place!"
Waine r.,"Daly City, CA",131,21,259,1.0,7/6/2016,"Wait time for 9"" pizza is 15mins. They served our pizza but forgot to give us fork and knife. Ordered another glass of lemonade but forgot to serve. Ordered Monkey Bread, waited 15mins.."
Julia B.,"San Mateo, CA",65,8,,1.0,9/9/2017,"A while back I went with a friend for happy hour and was very disappointed with the rubbery calamari. we complained to the manager and we started talking in further detail about how long he had been there. And he was telling us that he had just a started there and that he was planning on making a few changes. We were super impressed by his confidence. we gave it another chance and went back a month later and it was so much better. The service was wonderful!....  Last night... ugh! I know it was a Friday but the service sucked! We had called an hour before we arrived to get our name down because we were a larger party, we did and the person that took our name said it would be an hour and half wait. So we took our time getting to the restaurant because of the wait. We get there and we confirm with the hostess to get another estimate because it had been an hour already. the Hostess then told us that it would be 2 hours. We were so frustrated, so then we thought oh maybe there will be a few tables that would be available at the bar area. There wasn't but a few tables looked like they were finishing up so we were diligently watching. I asked the host stand if that manager was here and they said he had moved to a different restaurant... what a shame!! He ran that restaurant very well.  This family walks in way after us and a server walks up to them and greets them as family and whispered to them oh yeah there is a table that is about to be getting up... I'll save it for you. I was so pissed at that point because we had already been waiting for an hour. I think the servers name is Jon. I wont be going back there. Terrible service!"
Angela K.,"Novato, CA",186,536,98,4.0,5/21/2016,"Did anyone say ""pizookie""?  I am obsessed with these naughty delights at BJs.  Always warm with a dollop of ice cream, they heavens answer to what a cookie pie should be.  And if you're not in the mood for a large one, there are mini versions, too.  Aside from that, I love their burgers and shoe string fries.  This last visit, our waiter was very quick and helpful. Despite being very overwhelmed in his section with over twenty tables to serve, he made us feel heard.  My hub and I never had to ask for a refill for our drinks and he knew when the check was needed.  The food alterations were also followed through.  We were very thankful and ate a delicious meal."
Rosalyn L.,"Elk Grove, CA",121,133,1905,2.0,5/26/2016,"I've been occasionally going to this BJs whenever I'm in the area. Most of the time the food and service is decent and it's a great place to catch up with friends, who like me, are indecisive when it comes to picking a place to eat.  They have a wide variety of options including pastas, pizzas, burgers, steaks, and they even have healthier (low calorie) options for anyone who feels like eating light. My last experience here started off really well. My family and I started off with the avocado egg rolls and clam chowder in a bread bowl. The avocado egg rolls are always a must for me because I love avocados and these are just deep fried rolls of creamy and cheesy goodness. The clam chowder was also really good. The bread bowl was crisp and light, with the perfect chewy texture.  After our appetizers, it didn't take long before our main entrees came to the table. What prompted this review and a two star rating was that our dessert took well over 50 mins to get to the table. Every 15 minutes or so, our server came to our table, apologizing for the long wait and stated that our pizookie would be out shortly. I didn't mind at first because I was enjoying my company and conversation. After the third apology I was gonna call quits on the dessert but thought ""what the heck, I've waited this long what's another couple of minutes?"" BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! Finally, we were told that they would give us another pizookie on the house because of the wait.  To my utmost disappointment, not only did we not get the second pizookie, our original one came wrapped up in foil packed as a takeout!"
Jerrayah W.,"Gresham, OR",111,1,,3.0,11/16/2017,"Love the food but I hate the service... they're slow when it comes to being seated, getting the food or rounding up the check. I ordered food to go today and watched the wait staff at the front ignore the phone which was ringing off the hook to have a conversation! On top of that, I sat around and waited 20 minutes for my food which was already done. Like I said the food is really good but if your not a very patient person like I am I suggest eating at another BJ's establishment."
Nikki Q.,"San Francisco, CA",111,17,6,2.0,9/8/2016,"Came here a couple of days ago with the boyf. It was an hour before closing, (& we hate ourselves for being those type of people) but we just wanted a drink & to share a plate. Service here kind of sucked, even though there was barely anyone in the restaurant.  We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip. I kid you not, they tried to play me. Literally only half the bowl was full. Being the socially awkward person that I am, I didn't want to complain but three chips in & I could already see the bottom of the bowl. No Bueno. Our waitress saw how little of dip we got but I think she was just hoping we weren't going to say anything. We did & got another small bowl. So not satisfying."
Aaron C.,"San Francisco, CA",107,5,1,1.0,8/9/2017,"Came here for Happy Hour today, horrible service. My expectations weren't high to begin with but failed miserably. How many times do I need to request utensils so that I can actually eat the food brought to my table? Do you not have enough utensils to go around or what is the issue? How do you have people that say they will be right back with it but completely disappear?"
Angelo H.,"South San Francisco, CA",62,16,9,1.0,8/13/2017,"Horrible service. Staff never apologized for missing orders, wrong order given, and ended up waiting 1 hour for food when the place had only 6 full tables (excluding bar area), and plenty of staff just crowding around laughing among themselves in front of me. One hour, and none of them followed up."
Crystal G.,"Colma, CA",129,28,2,1.0,1/13/2017,"I don't know where to start.. I had an upsetting experience this past holiday season. I called to make a reservation for 12 people, all of which were family members coming from different places. My reservation was confirmed and they even took my contact information down. When we arrived, we were told my reservation was lost and they had a larger party of 40+ people and wouldn't be able to accommodate our party.  I was embarrassed with my family and asked them to go across the street to Jack's where they accommodated us in a short period."
cynthia K.,"Burlingame, CA",0,17,3,1.0,8/28/2017,"I've eaten at this restaurant  a few times and service was always really bad, today I decided to give it another chance as it's close to my work, went to the bar area, no one paid attention no menu so I went to the bar, bartender didn't pay attention either, I saw a server looking at my direction but decided not to pay attention either, I'm almost running out of my lunch time so I decided to leave infuriated, so people,  go somewhere else as these people at this establishment doesn't seem to care about customers who walks to their door, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME EATUNG OR DRINKING AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!"
Lin Z.,"San Mateo, CA",142,105,318,3.0,12/24/2015,"The service at BJs often leaves something to be desired. However, their happy hour is good! 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas is a good deal. Though this isn't really actual deep dish pizza, I still like the pizza here. Happy hour does start at weird times though, it's more like happy late hour for me because I usually can only go to the one that starts late at 10p.  The menu is pretty big but we'll usually get some combination of the following, all of which I'd recommend: crisp potato skins platter, calamari, BJ's classic combo pizza, and the Great White pizza. I've also gotten the Twisted BLT salad, which comes with spinach. Actually, that salad makes me feel a little less guilty about eating at BJ's late at night because I'll have it with a few slices of pizza.  All in all, BJ's is a good place to come hang out and get a beer and some decent food with friends."
Cherylynn N.,"San Francisco, CA",4767,1992,8315,3.0,8/3/2015,"Women (preggo or not) have the weirdest cravings.  Mr. NSS: ""Where do you wanna eat?"" Me: ""I want BJs."" Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh, you forreals?"" Me:  ""Yah."" Mr. NSS: ""I never knew you had 8====D envy."" Me: ""Who wouldn't be jealous of mandingo?"" Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh, is there something you want to tell me?"" Me: ""Geez, relax...I want to eat at BJs."" I'm not a fan of chains and I will never understand WHY people would wait up to 2 hours to eat at BJs, or any chain for that matter. But I have to admit, sometimes I need a little avocado egg rolls, cheap liquor, and pizookie (freshly baked cookie topped w/ ice cream) in my life.  We came here for their Happy Hour Specials that run Monday - Friday from 3 pm - 7 pm, and Sunday - Thursday from 10 pm - close: *$1 off guest beers *$4 craft beers *$5 mojitos, martinis & wine *$6 for slightly higher tier wine *$4-$6 apps: chicken wings, flatbread, spinach dip, sliders, potstickers, avocado egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and mini deep dish pizza (reduced HH portions so you're not saving that much in hindsight) I've visited BJ's more times than my check-ins indicate because my family like chains. I don't like waiting for a table so we usually try to snatch a table in the bar area since it's open seating. On our last visit, we sat in their outdoor patio and brought Tater Tot along:  .  As with any chain restaurant, I always come in with very low expectations. The safest bet on BJ's menu are their apps and pizzas. On our latest visit, we ordered their Avocado Rolls (HH - $6) to start:  . They tasted really off this time. It was sour like the cooks added too much citrus to keep the avocados from oxidizing. After downing two of my very stiff $4 Tanquerey gin & tonics (no top shelf gin), I didn't mind so much.  I wasn't feeling pizza so I ordered the Sante Fe Salad ($13.50):    which was piled high with crisp romaine lettuce, onions, red bell peppers, chicken cubes, cheese, and crunchy tortilla strips. The salad was lightly tossed in a semi-creamy dressing. Pretty decent and much better than the Sante Fe Salad I had the next day at nearby Nueve (Bayhill Shopping Plaza). Mr. NSS ordered the Ribeye ($23) which was awful! I told him that's not one of the items that you should order at BJs but hey, the man wanted steak. It was a cheap cut of meat with zero marbling. It was definitely not a ribeye steak but a sirloin or top round that was slapped onto a Forman Grill type of cooking device. There was grill marks but the rest of the steak looked so rubbery. He asked for rare, it came out medium well so he had to send it back. The second one was cooked better but it was just horrible quality; very tough, dry, and chewy. I had better steak at Sizzler's. Management, please take note: either you're scamming customers or your meat supplier is scamming you. Your ribeyes are not ribeyes, as another Yelper also seemed to have the same issue.  Anyhow, there was no room for a pizookie since we indulged in a second round of avocado rolls, even though they weren't that great to begin with. Dayam you, Mr. Tanquerey! Food has always been what it is for a chain: glorified frozen food but we've never had issues with any of the servers who are nice and efficient. We had the same server twice in a row and he was really nice to Tater Tot. He said, his ex-gf had a pom and that he missed him. He even showed us a pic. Awwww.....love furbabies."
Josephine W.,"DuBois, PA",6,2,,1.0,4/14/2017,Would give 5 stars for the restaurant itself because the look is amazing! But the service was very poor and our waitress didnt say one word to us or even smile! We didnt have silverwear for the first 20 minutes of our meal but the food was fairly decent!  I would not recommend this place unless you want to watch some tv and have a drink!!
Dorothy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,18,33,1.0,12/8/2016,"I like BJs but not this one. I went out last night with my husband and friend. We ordered an appetizer plate, 2 burgers and battered mushrooms along with 3 drinks. The appetizer plate came out first and all of the fried items (chicken wings/mozzarella sticks) were cold. We ate the rest of the items in hope of teaching down our waiter but he was no where to be found.  A different server brought us our food but we didn't have any utensils. When I asked for then she brought paper napkins but no rolled utensils. I had to go ask a different server for the utensils before we were able to eat. The burgers were sub par. My husbands was good but my roommates bun was extremely dry and everything was super oily. The family behind us was complaining about their meal S well.  The server only came back to ask if we wanted more to drink and never asked us how our food was. When I asked for the check he gave us the wrong persons bill then came back to return ours. Normally I don't complain, maybe he was having a bad day, or maybe he has too many tables. But overall service from all wait staff wasn't good.  I got home and I felt sick. I ended up getting food poisoning and was throwing up violently throughout the rest of the night.  I don't recommend this location to even my worst enemy. If your craving BJs go to a different location."
Skai H.,"Daly City, CA",0,6,1,1.0,10/31/2017,"Come here only if you have all the time in the world because you will seriously need it. These people don't know good customer service even if it hit them in the face. Hostess just had that I don't care attitude, and just drop the menu on the table when we got seated. The waiter could care less about us. He disappears a lot and never refills out water. The avocado was brown when our avocado egg rolls arrived and it looked very mushy. The rest of the dishes were average at best, but at least it wasn't bad. Our check arrived on a plate, and when we paid for it the waiter didn't even give us a pen for the signature and tip. Never again"
Stephanie S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,14,,1.0,8/12/2017,"If there was an option for no stars, I would have taken.  Pretty patient when it comes to busy Saturday nights and a party of 6.  However, when the entire table is served their food and the 6th person has to wait 15 minutes... It is totally unacceptable.  I believe since we complained, the  one meal was comped... But too little too late.  No more bj's for me or my family."
