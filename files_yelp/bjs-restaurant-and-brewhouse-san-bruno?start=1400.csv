John H.,"San Francisco, CA",180,52,1,3.0,12/29/2011,"Bjs has great food, and a great ambiance...here are the only issues I have...they always ask how I would like my burger cooked....yet EVERY single time it is cooked inccorectly...I dont mind and assume they will cook it incorrectly..but why even ask? its a slap in the face to ask and then do it wrong...mine as well just cook everyones medium or medium well....with that said, I frequent this location often and will continue no matter how annoying the servers are...i realize it is a chain and servers are required to upsell upsell upsell, but it gets sooooo annoying...if i want avocado eggrolls I will order them! :P all in all food is still great...but dont even bother asking how I want my burger cooked......"
Jenny W.,"San Francisco, CA",143,190,141,4.0,4/29/2009,"I come here for the happy hour, otherwise it's just not worth it! I like the mini pizzas yummy! It's $2 off appetizers, the avocado eggrolls are ok, but it tastes better a Cheesecake facory. $5 mini pizzas rule, I always get the great white with ham instead of chicken, it floats my boat =) The buffalo wings are ok too, so is the artichoke dip. I go here every couple of weeks, I like the pizza here better than pirro's. The pizooki is yummay! I can eat most of it by myself haha =D"
Gina K.,"Houston, TX",291,409,444,2.0,1/14/2009,"No hello or acknowledgment from our server until 10min after we sat down.  Their Pizza's and salads are ok and then it goes downhill after that.  Jambalaya tastes no where near cajun, it had not hint of spices, it was more like Chef Boy'R Dee.  All their food is bland.  The servers and a manager give off an distinct air of apathy that shows in their service.   The place looks nice with their lighting and tv screens and is great for hanging out with friends. Serving drinks until 11.   Pass on the food, way bland.  Actually had to send it back and just ask for the check."
Kerrin M L.,"San Bruno, CA",1,7,,3.0,8/24/2012,For a chain restraunt the food is ok. It gets crowded and loud and the service is hit or miss. The bartenders are friendly but its hard for me to accept that they card me everytime even though i go there a couple times a week for at least a year now. I know rules are rules but really? The staff knows i am over 21 at this point so why?
Kristina C.,"Kihei, HI",36,204,24,3.0,5/29/2008,"This place gets a star for the pizzookie alone! Me and my bud ate the apple crisp....glaachachaaha. That's what it made me say. There was a pretty good lunch special too. Had half a sandwich, soup, and fries. And the service was prompt. This place loses a star because it smelled like old sponge....."
Rosavida C.,"Santa Clara, CA",256,254,237,4.0,6/15/2008,"if you don't like the wait, grab a Hef from the bar and shut up. Sit outside and smoke. [you're not supposed to but people do it anyway] Besides, they make it up to you by giving you a free teenytiny slice of pizza, so no harm no foul. Teases. When you finally make it in there, get a BBQ chicken pizza or the wings. that's all I get and that's the only reason i come back. w0oh0o!"
hime s.,"San Francisco, CA",0,17,,4.0,12/17/2009,"1 star for refillable good strawberry lemonade 1 star for good service 1 star for restaurant appearance 1 star for the yummy cookie cake w/ ice cream they give you if it is your birthday typical american restaurant..overall good food but i did not like the spring rolls..there is some kind of curry taste to it..not sure how to describe it. Everything else was good. ordered pizza, fettucine alfredo, steak and mash potatoes, hot potato, artichoke and spinach dip, avocado rolls.."
Monica N.,"San Mateo, CA",47,141,33,3.0,8/3/2008,"I've been to this location countless times. I've never actually had to put my name down and get a pager, usually because of the fact that I refuse to do so. I normally head straight for the bar, but if tables are scarce there I just circle the area like a vulture until I find a space. This tactic hasn't failed me yet. Anyway I hadn't been back in a while and my cousin and I noticed some new menu items. Admittedly, one of them's a real winner: the Grilled Burger Melt. It's a whopping 1/2 lb. of Angus beef, with cheddar and Swiss cheese, plus my ultimate favorite: caramelized onions!!! What really makes it a standout is the grilled sourdough bread. Even better, I think it's actually garlic bread. I couldn't even put the thing down... seriously. It was that good. So why the average rating? Well, the place was hardly packed and service was slooooooowwwwww."
Cindy S.,"San Jose, CA",13,107,33,4.0,9/11/2010,This is the first BJ's I've ever been to and I fell in love with their deep dish pizzas and pizookie! It was a LONG LONG wait to get seated. They gave us one of those beeper things and we practically waited forever but the food was so satisfying the wait didn't even matter anymore. I have had some pasta dishes which were good but isn't to die for. Cheaper than the Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.
Jessica T.,"South San Francisco, CA",1,73,1,4.0,10/4/2011,"This place isn't bad. In the last maybe 2-3 years that I been coming here, they only messed up our meal TWICE. One time was that they got one of my dad's meals wrong so they had to completely redo it and the manager didn't charge us. The other time was because they accidentally gave our pizza to another table so when we told the waiter, he told us what happened and got to work making another one, again the manager didn't charge us. How lovely! For beginnings, I don't think you can go wrong with the spinach and artichoke dip. Just think about it. Colorful tortilla chips dipped in a warm cheesy dip. Oh man. It even smells good, too! Lol. Or you can order the Best Beginnings sampler platter that has a little of about 4 different dishes.  Their strawberry lemonade isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Sometimes it's not sweet enough and other times it's a little too sour. :[ For a meal, I usually order the grilled chicken pasta. It's good! BUT again, sometimes there's too much sauce and other times there's not enough sauce. I guess it depends on the chef's mood? If he wants to be generous or not..  But all in all, BJ's is a nice place to be with family. Or friends. But if you come here on a day where there's a major sports game going on, well.. good luck finding seats. And good luck hearing your friends talk cause it would just be way too loud!"
Teresa Y.,"San Francisco, CA",147,647,33,3.0,4/10/2008,Three stars for happy hour and the SECOND server we had tonight. Thanks Sergio! He was our second server. VERY attentive. No stars for the rude FIRST server who barely come to check on us. She helped her friends first! BOO! Sad face for the Warriors' loss. =(
Naji E.,"Millbrae, CA",11,122,17,1.0,7/1/2010,"Worst experience I've had my last visit.  My cousin and I get there 40 minuted before last call for food.  The only seating was in the bar area.  My cuz and I sat down and no one came to help us...I grabbed the waitress and asked for service....she replies....oh you guys are new?   It takes her forever to come back with menus.   They come back finally, get our drink orders...run off...the rest of our friends arrive and they give us more menus.....they disappear for a few minutes....I grab another waitor and he says...SORRY...our kitchen closed 5 minutes ago....when I saw our waitress again and asked her what happened...she pretty much ran away.  I came to later find out that she and a female at our table had personal issues and that is why she avoided our table.  THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!"
Conchita B.,"San Francisco, CA",174,163,1,4.0,1/19/2009,"Great place to hang out with friends on a Friday night. I only suggest that you get the basic things on the menu. Wings: AWWW so mouth filling these are better than Hooters. Baked Potato: Im truly a fan of it the regular cheese, bacon and sour cream. The potato is like on steriod or something it huge! Avocado Egg Roll: Hell YAH! the sauce is really good with these! Pizza: They have a good selection of them, I have tasted the great white and its good enough. As much as possible get the appetizers cause I think its the only thing you will not regret. I'll have to take one star off just cause its always busy here and the wait for tables are pretty crazy. There are times when they tell you the wait for a table for 2 is like 45 mins, 1 hours 15mins and some other crazy wait times."
Lynn V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,16,1,4.0,9/20/2010,"Love BJ's in Tanforan Mall! Fast service, friendly staff, and good food!"
Tiffany Y.,"Sacramento, CA",146,248,138,3.0,12/31/2010,"It was my first time coming here tonight. 25 - 30 minute wait. Wasn't so bad. I came here with my cousin. After we got seated, no one came and asked what we wanted to drink for 20 minutes. Pretty annoying. Food came fast. Got the cookies and cream Pizookies. It was delicious. But really sweet. After we got the check, they didn't take it for at least 45 minutes. So we were just sitting there talking. We had to hand our check to the waiter. Pretty annoying. Definitely would NOT come here for service. One of the worst service place I've ever been to. Food here is mediocre. Wouldn't be coming here anytime soon."
Hiromi N.,"San Francisco, CA",429,986,199,3.0,7/10/2008,"Okay, this isn't my first choice of places to eat, but it definitely is not last.  When in a pinch and running errands during my lunch hour at work, the proximity to Target, Petco and Ulta pretty much seals the deal for me. I've been here twice for lunch and I think that it is a-ok.  There is air-conditioning, which made dining there quite pleasant during our Bay Area heat wave. Here is what I ordered: ANGUS ROAST BEEF DIP au jus sandwich - $9.30 HOUSE CEASAR SALAD - $2.95 The roast beef was SUCCULENT and practically melted in my mouth and I LOVE the creamy horseradish sauce.  Plus, the seasoned fries are da bomb (they are steak fries) and the thin, crispy fries are also very tasty. All in all, I was pleased and would go there again."
Tiffani D.,"San Ramon, CA",59,7,,4.0,9/25/2009,"BJ's is definitely a place friends and I go to a lot! The prices are good, food is great, unfortunately the service is slow! But that gives you all the more time to enjoy a relaxing meal. Don't go here if you are in a hurry to eat! But if you don't mind a wait to sit- walk around the mall!  The pizookie's are amazing (and free for your bday!!)  the avocado egg rolls are to die for!  Go during happy hour (great times that happy hour occurs) for great deals!  Enjoy!"
kaitlyn s.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,7,3,1.0,9/20/2013,"I come to this restaurant once a week. Every time Ive came it takes on average 15 minutes just to get greeted by a server and when the server finally arrives none of them seem the least bit happy to serve you. (Based on my prior experience I would give this place one star) Until one night Stewart served me and he changed my entire mind around about this restaurant. He's always in a great mood, and knows everything I need before I even ask!! I made a yelp just to write this review on what excellent service he provides. Tonight I came in and didn't seat in Stewarts section so I expected to wait 15min before getting greeted (which I did) and eventually I asked a server ""Do you know who the server is for this section? I've been waiting for a while."" Vlattamier replied saying ""Either you wait to be seated or wait for your server, that's how it works here. He will come around, just wait!"" I was so upset! Moments later Stewart came over with water and said he can be my server. Even though I wasn't in his section. (Which he's done multiple other times) From that moment I realized I'd never come again unless Stewart is there to help me! So I give BJ's a one star and Stewart 5!"
Edward B.,"Metairie, LA",495,55,68,3.0,12/21/2010,"stopped here for a quick bite before taking a redeye from SFO to ATL.  Had the ""classic combo"" pizza and a couple of porters.  Pizza was good, beer was good.  The place was packed, so I was at one of those extended bar sections. I'd go back another time."
Wenn C.,"San Francisco, CA",115,162,24,4.0,1/5/2009,"All I ever get here is the amazing grilled salmon caesar salad. It is amazing the salmon is grilled well, is very tender and flavorful, the greens are always fresh and the super croutons are delicious. Mind you I am VERY picky about how my salmon, or any fish for that matter, is cooked, and this place knows how to cook it."
