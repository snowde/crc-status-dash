Evelyn L.,"San Bruno, CA",7,13,2,2.0,9/13/2013,Food is good but the reason the 2 star that the service sucked! Well maybe it was our service....she was horrible! She asked other  people if they needed anything but us! So if u happen to be at the booth near the window on a Wednesday night and its a girl with a pony tail..asked to be re-seated!
Ari C.,"Daly City, CA",169,356,443,2.0,8/17/2007,"Under normal situation, I would give BJ's 3 stars because I like their pizza and calzones. So why the two stars? First of all, the waiting sucks. Then the food and drinks are just okay. But the reason they get only 2 stars is because, make sure you make a mental note of this, ONE OF THE WAITERS STOLE MY FIANCE'S AND HIS FRIEND'S CREDIT CARD NUMBERS. Yes, someone who works for BJ's STOLE OUR MONEY. We have no idea who it was and a police report has been filed. I'll still go to BJ's, but I WILL NOT pay with credit/debit card anymore and I suggest you do the same. I realize two stars sound a bit generous considering the crime that took place at that, but it is an isolated incidence and it's not BJ's who stole the money, it's the people to work there. Other than that, BJ's is a decent restaurant."
Stanley K.,"San Francisco, CA",711,574,331,2.0,8/14/2007,"I am not a fan of slow and poor service. We had no table utensils. We had no one to check up on us, no refreshing of our drinks, no pre-bussing, and one of our orders was not fired. If I had to rate this server, he would be retrained again. I don't understand how you can make money serving unless you give them proper service.  I must admit, I am a king, I deserve great service at all time. After all, I will be mayor of San Francisco one day."
Mike A.,"San Francisco, CA",3,83,,5.0,8/17/2010,"Ok first of all the host told me the table for our party wouldn't be available for another 20-30 minutes so I walked back to my family waiting outside and discussed it with them and they said just tell them we're in a rush; let's just go to Chili's. As soon as I go back to tell them to just cancel our party the host tells me a table has suddenly become available. That is very good customer service if you ask me and an awesome way to keep guests from leaving.  Second of all we're Thai and there was nothing Thai about the ""Thai style shrimp lettuce wrap"", appetizer we ordered, plus it only came with 4 wraps...our party had 5 people including me. On the contrary the other appetizer we ordered which were the buffalo wings had a nice crisp and I found it hard to keep myself from pigging out on them so I could save room for my entree.. good sized juicy pieces too if I might add, not small and shriveled.  Third of all the entree I ordered gave me the choice of either salad or soup, I opted for the salad...nothing special but the portion was ridiculously huge (ok overexagerating but it wasn't small), definately not your appetizer sized salad here. Now onto the steak (my entree)...omfg it was so good, dry aged (supposedly) and cooked perfectly medium rare just how I like it. You'd be suprised how many places that get this packed end up messing up how well you want your steak. Better than Outback's if you ask me which is funny considering Outback is supposed to be a ""steakhouse"". And like the salad, the size of the baked potato it came with was f*ckin ridiculous, I've never eaten anywhere ever that gives you a baked potato that big...it was bigger than the size of my fist! (that's what she said). Last but not least....my family are probably one of the most irritating people to deal with but the server was incredibly patient with us. 2 thumbs up to her and the host for the good customer service. BJ's wins on all counts in my book, EXCEPT for that terrible ""Thai style shrimp lettuce wrap"".... I mean common guys seriously if you can't do it right don't do it at all."
Danny H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",342,252,80,2.0,8/26/2007,"From the parking lot you'd think ""Tied House"" or ""Gordon Biersch"" or any number of large, clicheed ""brew pub"" restaurants.  Once inside I noticed that BJs had the additional cajones to lay claim to Chicago cuisine.  OH really?  I ordered a mini pan pizza, and was treated to a limp piece of bread with toppings on it, including those disgusting little ""rabbit turd"" sausagelettes you get at Pizza Hut, etc.  ""Dormitory pizza bagel"" would have been a more appropriate description. This place sucks."
Liz S.,"Portland, OR",606,1059,883,3.0,1/28/2007,"While it has that kind of TGI Friday's or Chili's vibe, BJ's is definitely a step up from those chains. I was here about a week ago for a work field-trip, and they served our table of 12 people very well.  They had the usual array of Big Salads, soups, and overstuffed sandwiches. I found the food to be tasty and of decent quality. I had the clam chowder and the half BBQ Chicken sandwich.  The chowder, while very flour-y, was OK, and the sandwich was good.  The fries were great. The place is huge and open, with good acoustics.  I eyed the big bar on my way out, which looked like a good place for a guy to watch a game while his wife shops at the mall.  Good for kids (the restaurant, not the bar)."
Jonas E.,,81,80,,3.0,12/19/2008,"Bj's is a good place to get a brew and some food. We came at the right time I guess around noon and sat around the bar area thinking that we were going to get prompt service. I'm guessing they were short staffed for the day but nonetheless the service was really bad the day I went there with friends and never waited that long for appetizer meals.    Besides the bad service, I got their light blond beer that almost tastes like stella but more crisp and to top it off, I order chicken tenders with wedges when before the waiter gave me sliders so I had to promptly flag the waiter down and inform him not to include this on the bill. In the future I will probably come back here and try some other item but hopefully when I come back, service better be great."
Chris T.,"San Francisco, CA",109,264,22,1.0,10/29/2007,"I usually don't review too many chains, but I will only when I had an exceptional experience.  Well, at BJ's I did.  I had an exceptional case of fast acting diarrhea. A friend and I had split a House Salad with some sort of creamed dressing... Bleu I believe it was.  Well, after paying for our mediocre greasy food we went to the neighboring mall to shop.  It was synced so well, both my friend and I got tummy aches at the same time.  So the culprit had to be BJ's rotten dressing.   Also, when I was sprinkling some pepper onto the same salad, well the lid fell off and I got a big mountain of pepper all over the place!  ACHOO!  Great!  Now I got boogers all over the place!  I know they must refill their own salt n pepper jars so did they forget to quality check this one or was this a ""Oh I gotcha this time!!!"" prank?  The ol' loose pepper shaker gag... At least this would have been forgivable. Our waiter seemed really confused on what to do.  He was definitely a trainee, but wouldn't anyone know what to do with a broken pepper shaker?  Toss it, apologize on behalf of the restaurant and help us clean up.  He had to summon a supervisor for guidance... dear oh dear. Only good part of this restaurant is that there are about 157 TV screens to watch a sports game."
Christy L.,"San Francisco, CA",289,741,33,3.0,8/21/2007,"With a name like BJ's, how can you go wrong?  Well, like a bad BJ, they  leave you with a bad taste in your mouth (yikes, did I really say that?!).  3 stars for the pizza only.  The service and everything else - nada! BJ's is really strange.  I don't know if you've ever seen the movie ""Waiting,"" but images of that movie totally come to mind when I come here.  I can just see the chef in the back surprising the waiter with THE BAT WING - oooohhhhh, it's so veeeiiinnnyyyyyy! Anyhooo...I think one of the qualifications you need to work here is the ability to either, 1) be totally stoned while working, or 2) just look and act totally stoned while working here.  In the case of our waiter for the evening, I really hope he was stoned because if he wasn't, I feel sorry for his dumb ass. We typically order the pizza or the calzone.  I can't say that I've ordered anything else off the menu, aside from the appetizers.  I really like the pizza, which is the only reason they get 3 stars.  Sweet pig is my favorite.  We ordered the chips and salsa for an appetizer - don't waste your money...Doritos and store bought salsa are way better.  The artichoke dip is usually a safe pick. Of course, the beer makes everything taste better...even makes the shitty service bearable.   Don't forget to order the Pizzookie, totally yum!"
Kenny C.,"Oakland, CA",28,223,45,2.0,1/20/2009,"Service was HORRIBLE! I have been to a few other BJ's prior and I always had a great experience but not this time. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed, which I expected so we decided to sit outside instead of wait 2 hours for a table. As we sat ourselves outside, we waited 10-15 prior to a waitress even acknowledging our presence.  After she was kind enough to find time to tend to our party, we ordered and for it to be so busy the food came out very quickly. When I placed my order I asked for a side of ranch and BBQ sauce and she completely forget, I asked her 4 times before she finally brought it. Also I had to ask another waitress to bring my drink because our waitress also forgot about that.  After we ate and divided up the bill we paid, and decided to leave a cash tip even though the service was bad. She noticed that no tip was added on the card and kindly told us we only gave her enough money to cover the bill, even though we left her a generous cash tip on the table. Needless to say we took back a few bucks after this. So my overall experience here was not good. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."
rhonda s.,"South San Francisco, CA",42,268,383,3.0,4/8/2009,"If you can't get here early, stay at home or go somewhere else.  The reservations 'policy' is bizarre...you can only get your name on a waiting list even if you call ahead.  Happy Hour specials are great, if you can get a seat--we've had to stand numerous times.  When the stars have actually aligned, we've had some great burgers/beers on the outdoor patio (with heatlamps).  Wish they'd move to an online reservation system so that it's a not a total production every time you want to eat here."
anne m.,"San Francisco, CA",68,176,3,3.0,7/9/2010,"This place actually is comparable to the Elephant bar but the one plus is they have outdoor seating. We like to come here when the weather is nice and ask for an outdoor table.  Don't expect anything spectacular in the food department-your basic salads, burgers and sammies."
Tracy A.,"San Francisco, CA",278,324,144,2.0,4/25/2008,I'll only come here if I know I won't have to wait for seating. Last time I went with a group of 9 and the host told me he had to get the manager out for the reservation. wth? you can't put our names down yourself? you need the manager? what? His manager came out but he didn't talk to us at all. The host told me it will be a 3 hour wait. Are you freakin' kidding me? It's 5pm for God's sake.  Other than that the food here is just OKAY. I rather pick Elephant Bar than here. I only come in if there's no line or if I'm starving in the mall. Other than that you won't find me here.
Kathleen M.,"San Jose, CA",936,1493,122,4.0,9/22/2006,"Yeah, it's a chain, but you know what? The pizza's pretty darn good. A small is enough to feed two people, and you get out of there only paying about $12-$14 total. The plain ol' cheese pizza (with a topping or two thrown on) isn't too shabby. The Chicago special with meatballs and pepperoni and sausage is pretty good for those times you don't mind overdosing on meat."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",213,642,274,3.0,8/11/2006,"Eh, just OK.  It looks like it's better for Happy Hour type stuff anyway.  I went there last night after work for some food.  I was hungry and didn't want mall food, but Fatt Dog looks interesting. Anyway, they have 162 TV's playing different sports, and I happened to be there on a night when the Giants were off.  They have lots of pizza, which it seems like is their specialty, but I didn't see anybody order any.  Lots of fried appetizers can be had, and lots of beer.  Too bad I am not a beer drinker.  So I settled for the BJ Burger with bacon and cheese.  The burger was rather small and thin, almost as thick as the thick sliced bacon, which was good!  But sad to say, the bacon was better than the burger.  The fries are thick and coated with seasoning, but I think just plain old steak fries are better. I added a wedge salad for about $2 more which was pretty good with blue cheese, bacon, tomato and onion.  Pastas and other salad items are also available. Looks like a great place for after work, munching on appetizers, drinking beer, and watching sports. Minor Update :  I tried the pizza and was REALLY disappointed.  I have been spoiled by Little Star.  Skip it."
Art D.,"San Francisco, CA",250,202,2,3.0,7/17/2006,"I've been to this BJ's a few times now, and it's been hit and miss.  The good - I really like their jambalaya, and their beer and cocktails are also pretty good. I've tried their hefeweizen and porter, and liked the hefeweizen better. The porter is a little to sweet for me to enjoy with food, but I'm also a guy who doesn't like to mix his savories and sweets too often.  The bad - I just tried their deep-dish pizza for the first time, and I think I'm finally getting over the heartburn! The pizza was very buttery and had almost no sauce, and reminded me of Pizzeria Uno's at their worst. This was disappointing, because I had heard good things about their pizza.  I guess the lesson is to stick to the jambalaya, and head over to Zachary's for my deep-dish (or stuffed) pizza fix!"
Ruben P.,"Daly City, CA",180,166,178,3.0,11/22/2008,"I've been here many times before for happy hour (after work and late night) and always had a good time. The last few times I went here I actually got a table to eat something other than apps.  The service is always generally good and the food is good. This past week I went to dinner and got a ton of food with my homegirl. We ordered the ""best beginnings"" appetizer to start off which was a decent sampler platter.  Nothing great, nothing really that bad.  My friend got the parmesan chicken for dinner which looked good and she seemed to like.  I ordered the ribs and chicken combo, which came with a soup.  The clam chowder here was actually very good.  I was surprised.  The ribs were decent and the chicken was okay.  We ended our meal with a black/white pizookie.  All of the food was good, not exceptional. I would have rated them a 3.5, but will round down because they were out of Hefeweizen when we went for dinner.  How the F do you run out of Hefeweizen on a Monday night?  There's football on!  Shame on you BJ's!"
Jay H.,"San Francisco, CA",771,991,21,1.0,4/18/2006,"So when you try BJ's at first you are a little apprehensive.   Do you really want to go down that route?  I mean BJ's is not that out of the ordinary.  The location is pretty damn convenient if you are looking for something to sate the hunger.   At first glance BJ's appears very tame and undaunting.  You've seen this environment before...a little different yet still the same.    So I put in to my mouth what BJ's had to offer and it made me sick.  This was NOT what I expected.  I mean I didn't expect it to be an amazing experience and I'm not looking for something perfect, but at least a satisfactory experience and possibly one that I may go back to.   No such luck.  I left with an uneasy feeling in my stomach thinking that I should have never even gone there.    Lesson of the Day: Even if you're ravenously hungry...be careful what you put in your mouth."
Dave S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,200,,3.0,3/28/2011,"5:30 on a Sunday and we have to wait 15 minutes? Holy crap, is there NOTHING else to eat around here? Umm, don't answer that. Look, I found the place by accident and it was better than my other alternatives. It's BJ's. It is what it is...but to wait at 5:30 on a Sunday?"
Charlie W.,"Oakland, CA",95,152,93,3.0,1/8/2009,It's a typical brewery. Nothing too special. Nice selection of beer. Bar drinks are a bit weak. Foods are ok. But nothing you can't have anywhere else.  The pizza is their speciality and the deepdish are pretty good if you are into those kinda stuff. BJ Special.. not bad.. service is good.. very nice servers.  I will go back again.. Good place to watch the games or a night out with friends... The environment allows you to be loud and cheer for your favorite teams.
