Kim D.,"San Jose, CA",489,603,6,1.0,3/3/2008,"I went here on a busy Saturday night. The restaurant itself had a long wait, the food is all that average. But what really it was - was that the waitress was rude after we scrambled to find a seat on the patio and didn't even knowledge our existence after 10 minutes. She even snapped at us. And it's the kind of situation where you wonder if you should leave because the experience will probably be shitty on out, or she will do her employment justice and turn our perception around. We didn't have that much faith. And to that we left. So for much for an excellent BJ."
Edwin F.,"South San Francisco, CA",159,31,3,2.0,7/18/2010,I really Luke the food here but the problem is that it's a crapshoot when it comes to customer service. Sometimes you get less than average customer service then other times you get abysmal customer service. Bottom line: Food = good; customer service = sub par.
Dennis A.,"San Jose, CA",211,64,20,3.0,1/3/2011,Get the ahi poke!! This location is very busy..took a while to get seated and to order. We were Hella hungry!
Toni T.,"Pacifica, CA",13,16,,2.0,8/1/2013,"Normally I can go to BJ's and count on good food and drinks and decent service, that is if I get there before noon.  If I go in at 2:00 PM (as I did today) I get terrible service.  It took over an hour just to get a hamburger.  I brought my guests from the airport and was very disappointed."
Lauren L.,"San Francisco, CA",31,69,15,3.0,8/20/2010,"So my experience coming to BJ's wasn't ideal, I came here with my FATHER and a couple of friends. It wasn't awkward. AT ALL. There was a half an hour wait which was dandy because sitting in silence on a bench with my dad and my friends was pure bliss. Fast forward to ordering our food, no one ordered a deep dish pizza which was kind of surprising. I ordered one of their pasta dishes with shrimp and it was rich. Really rich. I felt like making it rain in the club. I didn't finish my meal because there was a lot of pasta. But when I got home, oh my goodness, I had a really bad stomach ache. If I ever go back, I am not ordering a pasta dish. Unless I want my bowels to be emptied."
Jess H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/20/2010,"I've been to BJ's plenty of times in years past, but last weekend it was absolutely horrific. It was my friend's birthday, and we decided to take a little break from shopping. We stopped by BJ's for lunch/supper (Lupper?). Anyways, we ordered our favorites: Potato Skins, Sliders, Pasta, and Pizza.  First off, the potato skins were dripping in oil, and cold by the time it reached our table! Half of them didn't even have bacon on it. Then, when the sliders came, the bun was doughy and the patty was hard. My friend's pasta was bland and ""tasted like oil."" And not to mention the pizza was painfully plain. This is the last time I am EVER eating at BJ's."
Lileth M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,59,,2.0,3/18/2010,"I have been to BJs numerous times especially when we want something fast, good for large number of people, celebrating a low key family gathering - mind you my family is not small - immediate family is 18 ppl from parents to grandkids - let's not forget our extended family! Whew - tired already! Anyway, I stopped going to this location just because the management service I received on Father's Day in 2009 is lowsy. Yes, it's been a long time and I am finally writing about it.  The reason I called is because of the Mother's Day experience we had. We waited over an hour for a large group. While seated, one of the server told us that they were taking reservations - we were not aware that there was a policy in place. So I decided to call ahead of time and spoke to one of manager named Peter, and asked him whether we have to make a reservation ahead of time. The manager is not aware of the policy so he put me on hold, waited for 5 minutes and he came back on the phone and told me ""NO."" I reiterated 3x that I want to make sure that we are not going to have any problems come Father's day and said we should not. So on the day of, I came in really early and the hostess told me that we have to wait over two hours and we have to talk to a manager. I spoke to Mario one of the MOD and he told me that they have been taking reservation for over a week now. Mind you, there was lady standing next to me hearing the same thing. By this time - I was livid! I walked outside to talk to my sister about the reservation, and while talking to my sister, I saw him seat the lady who was standing next to me - the party of 13. While having the conversation with Mario, I explained to Mario that I work in a fine dining restaurant here in the city and we don't have this type of problem - not communicating nor getting a memo about taking reservations on large parties especially when it's Mother's Day, Father's Day or any holiday. Every restaurant especially a chain have a policy in place and to make excuses for a manager who's been for three years is not a good excuse. P.s. Mario quoted me a two hour wait. We called the other BJs located in San Mateo and quoted us a 15-30 minute wait. We made our reservation, drove to San Mateo and texted my family about the change.  I would give the BJs in San Mateo a 4 star, partly because of food but how they handled our situation! This place rocked! Better service and we were seated right away, the MOD/Proprietor was fantastic! The only reason we had to wait is because they want all of us to be there - I did not mind at all - we were all there within 10 minutes - traffic coming from San Bruno to San Mateo.  P.s., I emailed and complained about the service and yes, I received an email from the District Manager and said that he's going to talk to his manager. Whether it changed or not - I still do not know.  Living here in the Bay Area gives us a lot of opportunities to go and eat in a lot of fantastic places from taco trucks, whole in the wall places to fine dining - from $ - $$$$ - I've experienced it. Yes, I have been to Aqua, Silks, Masa's, and more."
Valerie N.,"San Francisco, CA",27,612,41,4.0,3/3/2011,"came with my girl friend and her brother for lunch. we got seated right away.  i got their handbreaded chicken parmigiana and gourmet mac n cheese. girl friend got cuban burger and mozzarella sticks. the little brother got the mini burgers and happy fries (i thought it was amazingly cute) food came out good. it was tasty! nomnomnom our waitress was alright.  overall, i would come back because food here is pretty good!"
U T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,4,1.0,12/27/2013,"THIS PLACE HOSPITALIZE ME FROM FOOD POISON! My buddy and I went to watch a movie, so conveniently BJ is near by. We ask the front person how long is the wait, she told us 20 minutes, but we ended sat down around 60 minutes. Not much promising estimation on seating. I ordered this Alfredo or cheesy grilled chicken with pasta. The next morning I came down with a stomach flu with a severe bug issue from the grilled chicken. I was hospitalize for a week and place on antibiotic for two weeks. I contact the corporate office, they apologize, but try to contact the restaurant and they told the restaurant what happen. I tried to contact the restaurant because the corporate advice me to, to complete the investigation, but with no response from this franchise. I ask for the manager, but end up with ran around. I am very upset with them for ignoring me. Gotten me so sick and HOSPITALIZE, ignoring to complete the investigation, this place should be shut down! All I want is an apologies from the restaurant, that's all! They couldn't do that!"
Jen P.,"San Francisco, CA",59,373,457,2.0,11/9/2008,"Came here with my sister last week for a quick bite to eat before shopping and heading to school.  We shared a BBQ chicken deep dish pizza. It took 15 minutes to cook. Our waiter, Paul, barely tended to us, took us a while before we could catch his attention.  I do not see myself coming back here."
Roni R.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,369,,4.0,4/30/2008,"I love beer tasting and BJ's provided that fix.  I felt like I was in a northwest pub w/all the taste of ""malt beer"" and ""red beer"" and crap ... just a less pretentious wine tasting up in the Bay.  They keep it real here and that is what I'm about ... also, that deep dish pizza does kick some ass.  Yum!   It's a stretch from SF where I lived but well worth the metro ride for a night out of the city.  :-)"
Annette Y.,"San Francisco, CA",91,9,39,3.0,2/22/2012,"Came here Sunday evening, about half an hour+ wait and ordered the roasted turkey cobb sandwich with wedge cut fries and a root beer. The root beer was a bit flat to start and the fries were yummy but some of them were kinda hard to chew? The sandwich was delicious UNTIL I got to my second half and WTF.. Is that PLASTIC in my sandwich?!! I pulled it out of my mouth and the turkey was stuck to the plastic. (apparently the turkey comes wrapped in plastic) i told the waiter, he apologized and alerted the manager who then also apologized and said it will be taken off the bill. Anything else they can get me? Uh.. No thanks! 3 stars because before the plastic the sandwich was actually good plus the way they handled it.. I guess I should credit them for that.. Yay for customer service! I would probably go back again.. I'm sure this was just a one time mishap..."
Meredith O.,"Menlo Park, CA",67,188,8,1.0,11/17/2007,"It was late last night and we needed food. This place was conveniently located and open. That is where our good luck ended.  vaguely similar... to Cheesecake Factory We were told it would be a 30 min. wait. After 30 minutes I checked the front desk again. Turns out our name and table had been passed by long ago and our beeper thing did NOT go off. They were apologetic and got us into the very next table. The front desk should get 2 stars for that but... It was another 10 minutes before our waiter showed up at the table (remember it is late, we are very hungry, and we just waited 35 minutes pursing the menu in the waiting area, we know what we want) So we place the order, the music is so loud, we had to review it thrice with the waiter.  1st to arrive at the table = salad (not beverages, nor a fork, knife and table set-up but salad.) 15 minutes (honestly) for the beverages and they were the wrong ones..... and then the pizza.... again there were no plates for the Pizza and we had to wait for those.... but.... the spaghetti was cooked sans the meat balls but it had meat sauce. Now I told the waiter 3 TIMES ""Spaghetti with MEATBALLS"" but with the noise level he could have legitimately heard ""Spaghetti with meat sauce"" excused...   I honestly believe our waiter was so fixated on collecting the checks and tips from other tables he forgot service should come before the bill.... and without service, fellow workers are not stealing your tips, people are just not leaving them. One star as the food did not make me sick?!@#!$&%^$*&^%"
Jennifer C.,"Millbrae, CA",14,8,,2.0,3/26/2011,Bj's is good but i have had experienced better. Especially for birthdays its not the greatest place because their reservation system is like non existent and they make you wait like an hour and an half. So if they could improve that then maybe there would be  better experiences.
Danelle F.,"San Mateo, CA",4,6,,1.0,7/4/2013,"We have never been to Tanforan B.J's location before, only San Mateo.  We were seated and our waiter came up and asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  My husband ordered a soda and I ordered a water.  After we did this he went down 2 tables down from us and was chitchating with some young people who looked to be friends of his. 8 minutes later he dropped off my water and my husbands soda and before my husband could even get a single word out that he would like a straw he was already back at his friends table just talking away.  Needless to say we were a bit frustrated but oh well we will just catch him when he comes back to get our orders.  When he finally came back he took our order and we figured ok fine.  So husband ordered pork chops and I ordered soup.  So when waiter came back with food he dropped off food as he walked by.  Not even stopping at the table he just kept walking until he got back to friends table.  My husband looked down and said where are green beans? and I just shook my head.  Meanwhile as waiter just walked past our table and went directly back to friends table at which time he spent 13 min talking to them.  Finally we asked another waiter to grab our waiter which he did.  The waiter comes back giving us a look like we have inconvenienced him somehow.  My husband asks him doesn't this come with green beans and waiter said yes.  Husband then asks him well where are they and the waiter looks at my husband and says.  They are in the kitchen. At this point we are very angry.  As a customer at this establishment I would never have expected such a fresh mouth from a waiter.  At this point we asked to speak to his manager and he said ok.  10 min later manager was at our table and we explained what happened.  At this point manager took over and took pork chop back and started over.  He brought pork chop back with green beans and potatoes but by this time we were just too angry to eat.  You would have thought that the manager would have comped at least my husbands meal at least knowing how inappropriate his employee was.  But of course he did not. We will NEVER return to this location and probably never back to this establishment because of the kind of service we got today."
Emma R.,"Daly City, CA",377,32,27,2.0,5/26/2008,"The first time I ate here was with Patrick and the food wasn't that bad but after eating here several times the service just sucks.. The wait just to sit can be up to an hour or two, and I don't really wanna wait that long just to eat, might as well eat somewhere else. I ordered some food there last night for Take out and the service was also bad,    yeah they gave me my food but I  I told the cashier  that there was no one helping me at the bar and I asked the cashier if she can get me a Virgin Pina Colada  to go she said she would have to put it on a separate tab but never rung me up for the drink.  So I just went back to the bar and I asked the Bar Tender EXCUSE ME! CAN I GET SOME HELP HERE PLEASE! I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 10 MINUTES AND NOT ONCE HAVE I GOTTEN ANY HELP! and the bar tender just looked at me and said to me OK  and didn't even say sorry for the wait. I would have given this place a three but just getting bad service from BJ's I gave them a two star for shitty service."
Belinda C.,"Daly City, CA",264,699,2962,3.0,2/1/2010,i came here on a friday night with my friend.. parking was of course easy. but i didn't think that i had to wait an hour for a table for two.   but it's ok cuz you can take your buzzer thing and just go to barnes and noble to hang out for awhile.i learned later that you can call ahead of time to reserve a table.. so i guess i learn my lesson. we got out table and it was nice that they gave us a whole booth for 2 people. we orderd the avocado rolls right away cuz we are starving and it came out fast! if you are an avocado fan you will LOVE IT! filled with so much avocado! and they had a sweet dipping sauce that i absolutly loved! our dish was the deep dish pizza. the waitress was nice and told us that if it's jut the two of us we should order a particular size pizza. it came out to be 6 slices total. iwe ordered the MEDITERRANEAN pizza and it turned out pretty good. i feel like like their deep dish pizza more compared to patxi's . i had one slice and i was done.. too full!  but of course there room for dessert! pizookie all the way!! i had the cookies and cream pizookie and my friend had the chocolate chip! i think i like the chocolate chip one more because the cookies and cream was chocolate overload. i wished i lived close enough were i can order a pizookie everyday.. not healthy but taste so good!
Jay R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,203,,2.0,2/6/2011,"01.10.11 with 4 others - ordered a bunch of appetizers to share (nachos, avocado rolls, spinish and artichoke dip, shrimp wraps) 2 star for the avocado rolls, the drinks and dessert (pazookie a must try!)  minus 2 stars for the really really bad service (if we even got any) minus 1 star for the looong wait!"
G R.,"San Francisco, CA",38,298,328,2.0,7/23/2007,"Had a craving for nachos and living in the City we don't have many options (I even checked what Yelpers had to say and I am afraid not much help). So after 30mins of searching we decided to go South and hit BJ's.  What can I say we were hungry.  Its one of those places you may go once a year to; I would never be a regular there. No offense to those who frequent the place (there was a 15 min wait to be seated).  But the beer is not that great, the only thing we ordered was the Nachos and they were respectable. Good amount of toppings, cheese well melted, plus it was REAL cheese not that Velveeta oozy stuff. Either we were hungry and ate the whole thing or it was that good; I'd say it was a combination of the two."
Sara M.,"Castro Valley, CA",34,89,88,2.0,9/27/2010,"I came here for my brothers going away dinner, we had about 10 people at the table, It was late. We had a 45 minute wait and got seated around 10pm or so. The waitress was real perky, but friendly. She took our drink orders which took awhile to get to us, then she took our food order, which also took awhile to get to our table. Mind you, it wasn't that full after 10:30pm, so we wondered why it took so long. She never came around to ask if our food was good or if we needed more drinks, since more then half of us had empty cups. She forgot one of our food orders, and when she brought it out after reminding her about it, it was cold! She then asked if anyone wanted refills on beer and drinks, she took everyone's order and skipped mine, even though my drink was empty before the food arrived.  After flagging her down to get my drink in, it then took another 15 mins just to get our drinks, while she came up with the excuse the bar was busy YEAH RIGHT!! we looked behind us and saw the bar was not overcrowded or busy whatsoever, majority of the tables were gone in the restaurant so what was so busy they couldn't get our drinks to us? RIDICULOUS! Other then that the the food was good, but the service sucked!"
