Jordan A.,"San Francisco, CA",36,174,13,3.0,4/16/2008,"I've eaten at this location a total of 5 times and 4 out of the 5 times I've had my food come mildly warm. I've had the pot roast, the meatloaf, some chicken dish and a burger all served almost room temperature. jeez! The food itself is pretty good but how about some steam flowing from the meals people!  However the Pazookies are damn good. I'd go just to have desert at this place."
Rebecca S.,"Pacifica, CA",5,30,3,4.0,3/12/2011,"I dream about their mac and cheese often, but everything I've ever had at BJs has been super tasty.  Love the drinks too. I would have given it 5 stars but the wait staff has never really been stellar."
Lynn Y.,"Costa Mesa, CA",5,25,10,4.0,12/25/2012,Food was good and our waiter was awesome and so nice on Christmas Eve.
Denise B.,"San Francisco, CA",551,1403,3,3.0,5/8/2008,"Um, not as good as the one in San Diego, or else my taste buds got better. But still satisfactory.  The fish tacos were huge, ginormous if you will!  But the fish was covered in more of that shredded cabbage mix than I wanted to.  In fact for a second I wasn't sure if they had forgotten to put the fried fish in there, since I couldn't see it!  On top of that, the spinach artichoke dip thing was good, and the bruschetta wasn't bad either.   I didn't get to get the pizooki this time, but if it's anything like the one's I've had in the past, then it's a good thing to order if you like cookies....."
Serena L.,"Alameda, CA",523,443,899,3.0,7/18/2008,"I enjoy the food here. they serve several flavors of beers, which is cool and they make it in the back of the restaurant. I think the meatloaf is one of my favorites. customer service was decent. this location gets pretty busy, so expect at least an hour wait on the weekends."
Eric M.,"Manhattan, NY",123,294,37,2.0,5/1/2008,"A friend and I came here after seeing Iron Man on her recommendation, not mine.  I saw the sign that said 'Chicago Style Pizza' and I was hooked.  As a Chicagoan, I long for the stuff and have tried most every place in the Bay Area that serves it (Patxi's,  , Zachary's  , and Little Star  ) and I have pretty lofty standards (Lou Malnati's  ).  I wasn't hoping for much when I came here, seeing that it was a California grown chain restaurant, but I still had a little faith. Unfortunately, I had hoped for too much.  The pizza, which is served in a heavy metal pan, looked doomed from the start.  First off, the sausage I got on top was little balls of sausage like you see on a Domino's pizza, not the thick hunks that grace a true deep dish pie.  Second, I could see the cheese.  This sounds trivial, but the cheese (a tangy mixture of cheeses, not the bland stuff on this pie here) should be buried underneath a thick coating of chunky tomato sauce.  Instead, there were a small smattering of tomato chunks.  Finally, the crust was all wrong, wrong, wrong.  Rather than being the buttery goodness, raised at the edges to hold in the overflowing goodness of the thing, it was thick and doughy like an overgrown thin crust. When I finished the pizza, I felt like I had a brick in my belly.  I still do. The service was alright, but nothing to write home about.  The beer may be good, but I didn't have it.  Whatever you do, don't get the pizza!"
Alex C.,"San Mateo, CA",744,161,37,2.0,10/2/2008,"OH BJs BJs....what do I have to say about thou..... ....honestly not much -_- Been here several times (usually on a whim) and everytime...I find myself very unimpressed.  I typically order the pasta here but I'm told the pizza here is delicious. I stopped by again today with a friend and decided to give their hamburgers a go. Ordered the Cheese Melt Sandwich and what I wound up getting was a very oily sandwich stacked high with a ton of onions. EWWW GROSS! I felt my mouth swimming in onions....and I couldn't really take em out without removing all the cheese (which was melted right on top of it). Only time I've ever only finished about half a hamburger and left. And it really didn't help that I had to wait 15mins just to get water. Service is not really friendly either. They barely acknowledge you as they seat you. And seem rather unhappy to have to come back to your table to ask how your food is. At one point, my friend needed some napkins and instead of asking what she needed when, the waitress immediately assumed that she needed ketchup (huh?) and plopped a ketchup bottle on the table and rushed off to the next table. I realize they get busy but geez!"
Ace V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,,4.0,4/16/2011,They have a huge menu and their deep dish pizza is great.  There are many beers on tap to select from.  I recommend the Bj's Blond.  It goes good with the pizza.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that the place gets crowded sometimes and the wait for a table can take a while.  Great place though.
Kim R.,"San Francisco, CA",473,378,68,3.0,1/28/2007,"I was starving so I am giving this spot 4 stars because when I got to the mall I found a close parking right away  also  there were HELL of people waiting and I eyespied 2 ladies leaving @ a small table near the bar and I jumped on it. The busser was real cool and so was the waitress , I ordered a french dip and a side cesar salad. It was decent I also ate 1 of  my friends chicken strips ( Tasty)... I also drank a  hefeweizen and tried the 4 beer sampler I like the blonds and ambers myself. Pretty good I would come here again and usually I hate these corparate places."
Lillian L.,"Oakland, CA",80,134,27,3.0,7/6/2008,"Coworkers and I frequent this place because it's reasonably close to work and has good happy hour specials. They like the expansive variety of beers on tap (popular among them are the Nutty Brunette, Jeremiah Red, and PM Porter), and I like that you can get 5 oz. samplers of the beers because I'm a lightweight. What I love most is that you can get Lindemans Framboise here. It's the first beer I've ever enjoyed (introduced to me by the lovely Mr. H), as I don't much like the taste of beer. It's a raspberry-flavored, fizzy drink that barely tasted alcoholic but definitely felt it when I gulped down half the sampler in a minute. I had to quickly rectify the situation by ordering an appetizer.... which brings me to the cons of the place. Firstly, the food is not great. As in... worse than at a baseball stadium. Everything tastes old and microwaved, except for the pizookie (a big warm cookie with ice cream on top), which is quite divine. Secondly, the service is sub par, particularly during happy hour. They're slow to serve and hard to hail down when you need anything. Perhaps these things are to be expected at a place like BJ's, and clearly we don't mind the shortcomings too much because you'll see us here on Fridays... and sometimes Thursdays... and maybe Mondays.... We're the group having a good time -- laughing and putting away the beers (with little help from me)."
Norma Denisse S.,"Mesa, AZ",175,458,296,3.0,3/13/2008,"I wasn't expecting much.  The place is actually really nice on the inside, they have a bar area and they have TVs on the walls in case you want to watch the game while you eat. They sat us near the kitchen so it was a little noisy.  The food was okay, I mean I was expecting a little bit more flavor but the Turkey Cobb Sandwich was like something I could have just made at home. The fries were tasty they were seasoned and crispy.  I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade but to be honest it was too sweet, I mean the kind of sweet that makes your stomach hurt plus they put sugar crystals on the rim of the cup. Overall, I think it was okay. It might be a better place for Drinks and Appetizers maybe watch the game."
Roy N.,"San Francisco, CA",43,243,13,5.0,4/24/2010,"went here for lunch, because I really ran out of ideas.  i had what was probably the best pizza I've had in a long time! it was crazy.  their deep dish is actually pretty damn good.  sports bar, yes. but the pizza.  man, it was good."
Shay G.,"San Mateo, CA",1,14,,2.0,5/25/2013,"So this is my favorite chain, but this location doesn't represent it well.  The fries are either super greasy or taste like they've fried fish in the same oil as the French fries, the service is slow (good luck getting your drink refilled quickly...they have a drink station that a specific person does refills for.  The wait is ridiculous and the quality of the food/preparation isn't like the BJ's in san mateo.  San Mateo's is MUCH better on ALL levels.  Sad to say, but its true.  I've been to both more than 50 times."
RICHARD W.,"San Francisco, CA",384,44,11,4.0,2/7/2011,"Great restaurant.. I love Avocado Egg Rolls, Pizza is great.. Always busy with lines but it's not a problem as long as I'm having fun.."
Peter W.,"San Francisco, CA",21,72,28,3.0,10/13/2010,"The food here is good, not great, but I've never really been disappointed at anything I've ordered here. (I'd describe this place as a slightly lesser version of Cheesecake Factory... without the cheesecake) For the price and the usual long wait (during busy hours) however, I usually don't bother unless someone I'm with REALLY wants to try this place. The beers are decent, food is decent, both of which I wouldn't exactly drive out of my way for and the single unique thing is the almighty PIZOOKIE. I admit, I love it, but I'd have to really question whether it's worth it for that alone. Plus it's a dessert so not exactly something you'd get with lunch or enjoy with each meal. Unless that's how you roll lol. They do have bar seating so you can grab that if you don't want to wait for a table."
BrendaJoy G.,"San Francisco, CA",101,67,11,3.0,9/6/2010,"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed BJ's yet! I've came here a several times, especially for their Thai lettuce wraps, spinach artichoke dip, flatbread pizza, & Pizzookie. Service here is alright. Friendly but the waiters take a while to come to you. Food takes forever to come out, but it's worth it. Portions are perfect for sharing .. or just for your hungry self. I've had many dishes from the menu & I'm willing to try more."
Kurt H.,"Normandy Park, WA",3,144,65,3.0,3/23/2011,Good food and beer. Service sucks in the bar. Prices are resonable.
Gerardo B.,"San Bruno, CA",10,13,,2.0,5/15/2013,"It was a hot day so my girlfriend and I decided to grab lunch at BJS. We got outdoor seating and the serves greeted us fast. I order a Mojito and a california club pizza with NO AVOCADO! my girlfriend got the Santa Fe Salad with prawns. Our drink was deliver fast and our food came at the right time about 15 minutes, only one problem, my pizza had avocado. I sent it back and they told me they make me a new one. I think our server realized he had made a mistake so he ignored us for 30 minutes. Our waters were empty and i wanted another drink but the server would just walk by and nothing. After about 30 minutes the manager walked out so i flagged him down and explained our situation, he said he would go check on it. Then finally our server came and i told him what happened, i order another drink and told him to make another salad for my girlfriend as the lettuce was all soggy from the sun. The manager brought me my pizza and it looked good, then i told him i had a drink so he had to go get it as the server didn't go get it. Then i look at my pizza and it looks like they had just wiped off the avocado as i can still see little marks of it, i had not eat 2 pieces. Finally we ate what we could and asked for our bill.The manager was remarkable but the server was awful, and the food time also bad considering it was only a pizza. Never going back"
Dani D.,"Northern, CA",149,559,,3.0,3/4/2008,"BJ's (interesting) Restaurant & Brewery located in the Tanforan Mall next to Barnes & Nobles.Two of us were headed to Barnes & Nobles to purchase some books & movies,but decided we were hungry and needed to eat before browsing & purchasing. Intro: BJ's..no high expectations.Just fill us up because we are hungry. It was quite early and not too busy when we entered.We were seated on the opposite side of the   was ok,comfortable and told the waitress would arrive shortly.She arrived and was quite nice and I am sorry I forgot her name because she kept checking on us throughout our entire meal here and was professional. First off,ofcourse they ask you if you want a beverage..alcohol beverage I didn't induldge   would have been nice,but I passed.The Espresso-Tini sounded tasty ,as well as the others and they had a decent selection of   this moment my focus wasn't on alcohol it was more about getting some good books after some decent food.  On to the menu and what we decided: Spinach-Artichoke Dip was very creamy with colorful crispy chips.Let me tell you we eyed the Bruschetta,but passed on it.Honestly,the dip was nothing fabulous,but satisying at the moment to the both of us. My friend decided on the Salmon Fillet w/rice pilaf,veggies and salad.He practically finished everything and  I decided to go with the Blonde Ale Battered Fish-n-Chips w/ fries.The fish was quite crispy and tasted ok,as well as the fries.Nothing extraordinary or over the top of being scrumptious,but  just fulfulling at the moment. By the time our main dish came out the place was packed.I think maybe because it is in a somewhat busy mall  with people shopping that is why most of the people come here.I may be wrong. I must say the waitress was quite attentive.The atmosphere was quiet in the beginning,but became busy quickly. Prices ok. Food varies. Parking is so-so."
A P.,"San Francisco, CA",1241,377,18,4.0,9/25/2006,"I gotta say I have always loved this place, I first tried it in LA, when the hubby took me for the first time.  He always tells me the story about how he used to think the name of this place was funny when he was in high school.  ""You know BJ?  Blow Job?"" I proceeded to remind him he was no longer in High School. Okay, while not fine dining or as good as some of the local mom and pop haunts we usually go to, I have to say that for a corporate model, I'll take BJ's over Elephant Bar or any other ""large format corporate restaurant"". Yeah you have to wait, it's busy most of the time, but just get a buzzin pager and walk next door to Barnes & Noble and browse some books while you wait, or walk through the mall when it's open. The Avocado spring rolls were good but it needed more of a lime dipping sauce, the sweet syrupy stuff wasn't cutting it.  I'm spoiled by Eric's.  The chicken tenders were great with honey mustard dipping sauce. The pasta's are underwhelming and but have some potential, it just needed something.   Their beers are pretty good and well priced too! The Pizza is good.  You see I like deep dish with the ingredients piled high, cheese and sauce oozing out.  But I also like a slightly thicker crust with lots'o ingredients but not completely soggy.  Depends on the mood.  I was in the mood for the latter.  Their BJ's Special (grin - yeah I know how that sounds) is great for peeps who love hot meat with their BJ's Special. PIZOOKIE!!!!!!!!!!! Can I say YUM!?!  A freshly baked humungo cookie piping hot with vanilla bean ice cream on top!  (we took this to go cause we had to go home and watch Desperate Housewives.)  Pizookie and Desperate Housewives are the perfect match!"
