Kat R.,"Los Angeles, CA",340,333,15,4.0,5/9/2007,"It's like a tgifridays but good.  Good drinks, good dessert, good food.  I love the tomato and cheese pizza and chocolate chip pizooki.   That's all I need at BJs.  Though their hard cider is good as well.  Reasonably priced and the only mall restaurant that really gets me going.  BJs and Monster Desserts in one place?  This is what makes San Bruno stand out in my book.   Mmm.....BJs."
Tracie P.,"San Bruno, CA",221,256,109,4.0,10/17/2005,"Update:  Well it can still get pretty busy here. And I don't think its the food (which can range from ok to great) but rather a great place to be and drink, dine and watch tv.  Service can be inconsistant but I still come here to grab a resonably decent meal. I really liked it.  We went opening weekend, so it was the zoo you thought it would be.  We were told 1.5 hr wait and we had put our name in before our walk throught the mall.  It was crowded and we ended up finding a table in the bar before we were seated.   The atmosphere was pretty rocking though maybe that was the Cal v UCLA game and its devotees.  The food was yum.  Still prefer the Cobb at American Bull.  Great children's menu.  We got to sample the pizza as they were handing out sample to those of us waiting and waiting.   Best feature:  The outdoor pation with heat lamps and a fire pit plus wind guard.   Last point, in spite of how much of a zoo it was with everyone wanting to get in, all the staff, had a non frenzied attitude and treated you like you were their only customer.  From the check in girl to the bus guy to the wait staff, they had great service.  I will be back and not just cuz I like their beer."
Barb B.,"San Jose, CA",134,619,30,2.0,6/3/2007,"So, I come home and tell my better half I visited BJ's  and had a fish taco with my two old Aunties.  He looks at me sideways, and asks, ""You did what where and with who?"" How else are you supposed to explain your mediocre lunch?  The taco was ok.....a lot of of lettuce filler and buried deep down was a fish stick (""you had WHAT??"") Like the BJ's down the peninsula, the place is not for those sensitive to auditory stimuli. The place is inundated with a plethora of noise from the TV's, loud music, cell phones going off, and loud talking all at the same time. If I had Tourette's, I might have fit right in."
Nancy T.,"San Francisco, CA",14,42,1,3.0,3/17/2011,"Food was good but service was horrid. We asked what was the wait time, it was an hour which was fine. We were told to come back in 20 minutes for the little beeper thing because they ran out, word? So wait time ended up being a total 1hr 30 min. We had two different waitress, the second one we had to flag down when we needed something even to pay. Three stars for the food and 0 stars for the service."
Barrett H.,"Redwood City, CA",1,36,7,3.0,3/15/2011,Had a lot of salad and soup for lunch and they were both mediocre. It's kind of loud but the decor is nice. The waitress was nice and helpful. Yeah the main dishes were pretty good if you are looking for a meal averaging in the low 2000 calories. I don't run enough marathons to deserve to eat at BJ's ...
Theary K.,"Oakland, CA",41,139,3,3.0,9/21/2007,"I never sat anywhere else inside of BJ but their bar area, nor have I ever ordered any entree items.  I'm writing a review for this place because I like their appetizers :D  My first time at BJ, I was taken by their chicken wings! It was yummy; cripsy but not dry at all. It was the only chicken wings I would crave. However, there was one time that the wings came out horrible.  I guess a change of chef or just a bad day.  It tasted like frozen wings that you over microwaved (and trust me! I know how that taste).  But other times, it's became good again(although not as yummy as my first time luck of the draw). I like their pizzas (1/2 off the minis during happy hours) and can't go wrong with the spinach and artichoke dip! It's a good place to go have your beer and good pub food to hold it down.  Their happy hour specials are pretty descent; I can't complain. Don't have much to yelp about their beer selection.  They do have their house brews with cute names, but a beer is a beer anywhere :) BJs statisfy my craving for beer and chicken wings.  I'm happy (and so is my tummy).  Writing this review is making me a little thirsty ;)"
Andy S.,"San Francisco, CA",27,120,12,3.0,9/26/2010,"A relatively dull, corporate brewhouse -- much like a Rock Bottom or similar. Not a bad place for lunch, but definitely not somewhere I would seek out for great California beers."
Katherine F.,"Seattle, WA",63,375,,3.0,6/17/2008,"This place is just alright. I like the atmosphere and the fact that it stays up until past midnight on a Monday night. I went here with  a total of 7 people and we sat into a great booth and most of us ordered different things. The deep dish pizza was good and everything else was pretty tasty. It's not anything that's ""wow"", but it's a great place to hang out late. My only complaint is that that server wasn't really that cool and my water cup was definitely empty by the end of the dinner....but I guess what do I expect for a little higher class Red Robin?"
Christina D.,"Belmont, CA",28,242,,3.0,1/3/2010,"Usually I don't go into Bj's very often but recently came in because I got a gift card. I ended up coming in for happy hour and the food tasted pretty good and didn't hurt my stomach like it used to. We got 3 mini-pizzas, chicken wings and 5 beers for about 45. Not bad!!! Can't see myself turning into a regular but probably will be back for happy hour."
Kara J.,"Pacifica, CA",14,12,4,5.0,11/26/2008,"What can I say, I'm a SUCKER for this place!! The Chardonnay Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta plate is probably one of my favorite dishes I've ever had. No joke. Not to mention their wide varieties of beers, dark and light AND all the different games they got going on the big screens. BJ's rules.No pun intended. EPIC WIN."
Amy C.,"San Francisco, CA",76,217,85,4.0,7/30/2010,"Nice place to have a small to moderate gathering of friends and family. But ideally it would be better for a group up to six max because its inconvenient for larger groups. Good food all around, no complaints. Everything is great!"
Charisse G.,"South San Francisco, CA",27,67,13,3.0,9/2/2008,Good times. I don't care much for the service. Bruchetta = awesome Crisp Potato Skins = awesome Fries = awesome Chili Cheese Fries = awesomer Avocado Egg Rolls = nasty Mozzarella Cheese Sticks = nasty Turkey Cobb Sandwich = awesome Turkey Club Sandwich = awesomer Cookies & Creme Pizookie = yay
Jake S.,"Palo Alto, CA",399,175,,3.0,7/29/2011,"There's not a whole lot of difference between BJ's and this one is standard.  It's always crowded and for whatever reason this particular location draws lowbrow clientele.  Every time I am here there's shit for brains at the next table so for that reason I don't expect a quality dining experience.  BJ's is good for decent pub grub and drinks, as others have noted, it is open late."
Quinallison J.,Bay Area,63,152,189,4.0,7/29/2008,"Me? Yelping a chain, no way. Okay okay so I do this only cause this is the place to be sometimes when you need a good chain restaurant to go to and you don't want to think about parking, if the food is good, if the place might be dead, too crowded, too overwhelming, yada.  Everyone knows the peak hours, everyone knows what they like here. There's never anything wrong w/ the food unless it's just ""one of those days"" when you're the unlucky one, but that barely happens.  I love the food, my favorite is the simple classic baked potato, huge and generous with the toppings. My friends and I ALWAYS get the nachos. Even 5 of us have a hard time finishing it off. The beer is always good of course (I'm a wimp, I like the berry burst cider) and the reason why we always decide to go... PIZOOOKIEEE!"
Gilbert C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,190,24,5.0,10/9/2008,Ive gone here to eat a handful of times since they opened the place.  The service is usually good and courteous and the food is good and on the bigger portion size.  I love their nachos appetizers....its friggin huge!  Their desserts like the pazookies are equally awesome....its quite a feat trying to finish it after having one of their big entrees. I'm also very much a sports fan so I love how they have tons of tv screens all showing sports related stuff.  They dont turn up the volume so I wish they turned on closed captioning. Never had a problem here at all....except sometimes the waiter/waitress seems to disappear after paying the bill (my friends and I sometimes just like to chill there a bit longer finishing our drinks and BS-ing with one another) but maybe thats just policy. Good for large groups too which is nice.
Alicia H.,"Daly City, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/6/2013,"My son (11yr old) and I walked into BJ's San Bruno today at 1055 am. We were seated a minute later. They had just opened.  You would think service and food will come out pretty quickly. Think again.  Server Alex took our order 5 minutes later. I ordered unlimited soup and salad, and my son ordered kids meal (ribs). Our food came out 25 minutes later.  My soup was warm but I didn't complain. Half way thru my soup, server Alex asked how everything was. I said good, but can I have another bowl of soup (knowing it would probably take a long time to get another one). Soup came out 15 mins later (really ?). There was a couple sitting near us who had complained about there wings not having enough sauce.  Alex took it back and it came back with more sauce in less than 2 minutes. Why did they get better service, maybe because their bill would probably be more, meaning more tip for him ???  I have done this job before and yes, unfortunately it does happen like that.  The bigger the bill the better your tip will be. Someone else brought the soup. I made the comment  about how long it took then asked her if I can have my soup to go. She said yes I can get that for you, but never came back.  I sat there for another 5 minutes waiting for Alex to come to my table. He never came back. So I finally waved down a manager, William, I told him all that had happened. He apologized and said he will minus my meal for the inconvenience. I did also tell him that Alex never came back to face me to apologize for anything. That is so freaking frustrating to be ignored when its their job to give you good customer service no matter what you order.  This BJ's Restaurant in San Bruno has gone down in service. They have hired people who do not care so why should the paying customers care to come back ???? I even gave him a tip !!! Why did I do that ??? I guess because my son did enjoy his meal. If you decide to come to this BJ's, lets hope you don't get Alex  or anyone like him as a server. No personality. This was not my first incident and it wasn't my 2nd. I just thought I give it another shot. Never again !!! I have never yelped before. Like another yelper stated....BJ's was asking for it."
Wilhelm Y.,"San Francisco, CA",706,1004,3592,3.0,1/28/2007,"After walking around Tanforan Mall for the first time since its renovation a friend and I ate here last night.  Maybe we ordered the wrong menu items, but my conclusion was this ... come for the beer, not the food. 6 PM on a Saturday night and this place is packed; there are about twenty people waiting for tables and possibly more outside of the restaurant.  The young lady at the reservation podium tells us it will be a 45 minute wait.  The Winter X Games are on several of the flat panel tv's that surround this restaurant.  It's the men's snowboarding half pipe finals.  We'll watch and wait.  35 minutes later and our pager buzzes; we're seated. I started out with the Brewhouse Blonde, and I found it a bit on the lighter side.  It was good though.  My friend orders the minestrone for starters and a meat lasagna.  I order the house salad with honey mustard and a pot roast entree.  The food arrived fairly quickly, and I must add that the two people who worked our table were superb.  I had a spoonful of soup.  It was good.  The vegetables on the salad were cold and crisp, but something about the taste of the croutons was very annoying.  My beer is gone by then, and I order a hefeweizen.  I enjoyed the flavor of this beer much more than the first.  The serving of lasagna was a bit small and smothered in way too much meat sauce.  The two slices of garlic toast that came with the entree almost equaled its size.  The pot roast was tender and flavorful and I liked the white cheddar mashed potatoes, but the whole plate was drowned in a salty brown gravy.  The steamed veggies served on the side were good.  Anyway I got a chance to view the conclusion of the snowboarding so I was happy. I'd give this place 3 and a half stars if I could.  Considering how many people were dining at the time, the service was excellent and the beer is very good.  Our food could have been much better."
Tony L.,"San Francisco, CA",663,1265,21,3.0,8/23/2007,"Yup, it's a chain.  And like all chains you get decent tasting food.  I don't know why knowing that the same dish you're eating is being reproduced at hundreds of locations across the country makes it less appetizing.  It's not that way with alcohol or other beverages.  Does anybody ever complain about mass produced sodas?  Not as much as chains. But whatever, if you're not here for the food, you're here for the alcohol.  What's even better is you can drink your alcohol while smoking beside a fire pit on the outside.  The food, yeah, it's alright.  And I'm pretty disappointed that management hasn't taken stock of the fact that their waiters need to kiss a little more ass with all these 1-2 star reviews. Nevertheless, I still have hope for this BJ's.  It's big, it's got a lot of large flat screen monitors to watch sports on.  And it's got a fire pit.  I just hope I'm not around when a fight breaks out."
Bing D.,"San Francisco, CA",153,472,65,4.0,8/23/2010,"why only 4 stars and not 5? they are slow.  i mean slow.  the mananger though is a great guy and he noticed that we had been greeted slowly and our orders came slowly too that he offered us a free dessert for 3.  we weren't greedy so we just ordered the trio pizookie which is ice cream over a fresh over baked cookie. i ordered the sourdough burger.  my father had the teriyaki salmon, i almost got the teriyaki chicken.  my mother had the fish n chips. all of it was cooked perfectly.  wish we had more.  the price could be a bit better but hell its a restaurant that has lots to order from and sometimes it takes some time to get it out to you. i've loved eating here and they have bottom less sodas...but better BOTTOMLESS HOMEMADE ROOTBEER."
Marc M.,"Redwood City, CA",537,188,,4.0,12/16/2012,Always a great Thursday Happy Hour spot. :)
