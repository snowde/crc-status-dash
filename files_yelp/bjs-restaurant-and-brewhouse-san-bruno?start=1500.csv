Bonita C.,"San Francisco, CA",77,121,32,4.0,1/13/2008,"i am never displeased when it comes to eating at BJs. It is a good location from my home and the restaurant is easy to spot...True, the wait is horrible but I've never experienced it since my friends are always the ones who have to do the waiting while I come in later. =) haha. We usually come to BJs for last resort or a semi late dinner. I've gotten a different variety of their foods so far. I love their sesame chicken salad, it is soo damn good. It was so good that I ate all of it last night, which I rarely do when it comes to salad, haha. Anyways, I would definitely come back again once in a while. yum =)"
Spanky M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,389,10,3.0,11/2/2008,"Actually 2.5 stars.  Nows I know the sandwiches and burgers here are decent, I have had them and they are not anything to write home about but the price and portions are proportional.  Also the aqppetizers are good, not anyting mind blowing, but good. However, the PIZZA...what a piece of $HIT!  I mean chicago style?  Listen just becuase you put your pizza hut crust (literally) into a pan that does not make it Chcago style.  I came in hopeing for atleast something better than Pizza hut but was given one of the biggest dissapointments of my life, next to my dissappointment of Zachary's ""Chicago style"" pizza.  I had to tell the server the pizza was absolute crap as a representatation of my home town.  It was basically Foccacia bread with vegetables and frozen meat products drizzled on top with cheese spotted over it.I Are you F'ing serious with this SORRY excuse for a CHicago style pizza.  As a Chicagoan I must say I am truely offended that anyone would even pass this off as Chicago Style.  I never even heard of BJ's in the Chi. No wonder people here think Zachary's is so great, the alternative is unthinkable."
P L.,"San Bruno, CA",0,28,,5.0,5/22/2013,This BJ's is great! The staff always remembers me and knows what I like to get. This is not common to find in big-name chains such as BJ's. Well done! I love to come in for lunch and get the endless soup and salad combo. The tomato mozzarella is so delicious and such a good deal!
David D.,"San Francisco, CA",83,328,2,1.0,2/8/2010,"First I would like to state that I'm a waiter. I know what its like and I know that servers are usually 10x more busy than the costumers think. But there was no excuse for the service myself and my friends received tonight. There were 2 of us at the beginning but we told them it would be 6 total. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to even greet us. Then took another 15 minutes to receive our drinks. But w/e, we're not stressing about it. At this point our friend joins us- now there are 3 of us. Another 10 minutes for the waitress to come by and take his drink order- we also order some appitizers at this point. As soon as they came out, our waitress tells us that her shift is over and asked if we could pay our bill, BUT THAT ANOTHER SERVER WOULD BE BY SOON TO TAKE CARE OF US. So of course we pay and wait for another waiter to come by. Now all 6 of us are here and we have not seen our 2nd server for 45 minutes. YES, 45 minutes. Not one waiter even looks at us. There are 6 of us at a table eying every server that walks passed and no one awknowleged us. We waved down two waiters, both of which did nothing. They gave us blank stares! ""Can we have a waiter?"" *Blank stare."" So we just got fed up and went to the bar tender who is on the other side of the restaurant to order drinks and food. Not being our server, we tipped him before we even received our food. So for the 3 hours we were in the restaurant, we went 2 hours without a server. And dont think for a minute that I'm exagerating this at all. All 6 of us, all waiters, said we would have been FIRED if we treated our costumers like we were treated. Imagine being a waiter and not helping a table for 45 minutes. Not to mention that no one even came by to pre-bus our table.The only reason we did not ask to see a manager is because we're friends with the manager and did not want to bother him. Oh yeah- the restaurant was only about 1/3rd full."
Carolina H.,"San Rafael, CA",70,98,99,2.0,8/9/2008,"My boyfriend and I stummbled upon this place while on a shopping excursion. I was looking forward to having a few cocktails before begining my adventure. The only problem at this place is their staff...They straight  blow it. Ten minutes before they ackonwledge you and five to take a drink order finally five more to get the drink. I mean look at this place! Great ambiance, plenty of entertainment and your located in a mall. All I wanted was a cocktail. How busy can a full staff be at 11:30am. I gave them two stars for the drinks they tasted great although the wait can be comical. Won't be stopping back here anytime soon."
Carlos W.,"Oakland, CA",56,62,6,4.0,6/29/2011,"Graet Corporate food. Allway good. Everything i've ever has has been good. Great Place to take kids. Clean, Safe, Easy to park."
Courtney D.,"San Francisco, CA",194,78,18,1.0,2/28/2010,"why! why! why! Do we continue to return to this place is the question, (glutton for punishment I guess) I can promise you it's not for the stellar service, these kids could care less if you ever get your food, that is if they even bother to PUT IN your order! One time the waiter actually came back to clarify what my friend had requested on her pizza, then when all the orders came, hers was missing!  I've been here with a large group & small group, either way it takes 45 mins just to get your drink order in, and that's on a good day!  So if you have time to kill this is the place to go, the only redeeming quality is the deep dish pizza, when & if they get it right or get it on the table at all!"
Jessica R.,"San Francisco, CA",105,371,269,4.0,10/20/2008,"Went to BJ's last night with the fam. It was all good foooood =) Had to spend time with my cousin who just came back from the Army and she was craving BJ's-- I think she loves this place, haha. BUT, we had a waiter then we got a new one. The one we had the first time took our drink orders and what not. It was funny 'cause my cousin kept calling him SEYMOUR and he was like, that's not my name. It was all fun and games, I had fun but the food took long and since we waited so long, I was no longer that hunger so all of us had to get to-go boxes. Yeah, pretty much. OHHHH, and try their bruschetta-- it's bomb!"
Jenny A.,"Daly City, CA",1,10,,1.0,5/2/2012,"My husband and I use to frequent this restaurant quite often. However, in the past couple of years the food quality has gone down hill. We would often order deep dish pizzas. The food would be delivered lukewarm with a thin layer of tomato sauce to cover the dough. The cheese would barely be melted and the crust would not be cut all the way through. For all these reasons, we have stopped eating at this restaurant."
Dave H.,"Saint Paul, MN",11,119,,1.0,1/16/2008,"It's always packed, I think because it's one of the few places in San Bruno that is both clean and unlikely to result in a mugging.  If you work in the office park, there are only so many times that you can eat at the decent Vietnamese place in the shopping center, and as amazing as Don Pico's is, it's too expensive to go there regularly. Location is apparently everything, because there is otherwise absolutely no reason to go here.  The service is abysmal; you'll often see 10 empty tables but have to wait 30 minutes to be seated, and when you get a table, it will take your greenhorn waiter 10 minutes to show his face.  Once you get your food -- it's laughable.  I've had salads with frozen lettuce -- no kidding, practically with ice cubes  -- and others with so much dressing that I couldn't see the ingredients. Like all the other suckers, I keep going here just for lack of other choices."
Emily M.,"Redwood City, CA",174,742,6,3.0,3/3/2007,"Pretty much what you would expect for a place like this. Service was pretty bad, but it was also quite busy on the Friday afternoon I went with my co-workers. If we hadn't found a spot outside, the wait would have been 25 minutes.  The company was paying, so I couldn't get too worked up about whether or not the food was good or bad. :) What I had was pretty good - fish tacos. Also had a Jeremiah Red beer, which was enjoyable. Anyway, not high class, but serves a purpose. Nice for a Friday lunch with co-workers, anyway."
Herb C.,"Bellevue, WA",34,118,,3.0,8/2/2006,"The service here at BJ's is hit or miss.  I've been there a couple of times and some times it's really great and other times, we watched in horror as plates of food made it out fo the kitchen only to be looped around the entire restrauant (becuase the servers didn't know their table #'s) and back into the kitchen.   If you're a fan of big portions, then this is the place for you.  I could just come here to share a plate of their nachos ($7.95) and that would fill me up.  Of course, I had to order a sandwich and a salad as well, so i was uber-stuffed since I was taught to not waste any food.    I've gone to BJ's at 11am on a Sunday and there was no wait.  I think the wait happens when people actually eat lunch and dinner since the kitchen service is kind of slow.     They have alot of flat screen tv's that broadcast whatever is on (mainly sports) but sometimes you can get your fill of infomercials.... although it's not as fun if you can't hear the people selling the product."
kim s.,"San Francisco, CA",33,27,,2.0,7/16/2008,"My daughter wanted to go here for lunch. I was hesitant, but hubby and I acquiesced in the end. WE got o the counter to give our name. The hostess ignored hubby and continues to chat on the phone. I go up next to him and she hangs up, still ignores hubby but talks to me. (Maybe she didn't like what he was wearing that day) I tell her we have two adults and one child. She looks at my daughter who is nine and asks me if she needs a booster seat. My daughter reaches just under my chin, so I'm thinking she doesn't need a booster seat, but ok. My daughter of course looks indignant at the thought of being treated like a baby We are seated about fifteen minutes later. The waitress comes to our table about 10 minutes after we are seated. We have already decided on what we want.  Peanut(my daughter) orders the chicken tenders and a sprite.  I order the turkey cobb on whole grain with a cup of soup. She asks twice if I said club to which I respond ""no, I said cobb."" Hubby orders the patty melt rare, with skinny fries and onions on the side.  Easy right? It was a bit after one o'clock so we didn't order any starters.   Waitress comes back with our drinks pretty quick.  About twenty five minutes later Peanuts food comes along with my cup of food.  Four other tables have been seated around us at this time. We see all of them get served and their orders come before the rest of our meal. It took about thirty minutes from Peanuts meal to arrive to the time my sandwich and hubby's patty melt comes.  I sez to myself they must've messed up the order. Sadly, the order was wrong. My sandwich was fine. But hubby got onions in his burger instead of on the side and he got the big steak fries instead of the skinny fries that he asked for. We didn't send it back because we are now  hungry.  Note, I think it's cool when you can memorize orders and not have to write it on tickets. But if you have suck memory, write it down. And if the order is messed up, have the decency to come tell us. It would have saved your tip.  Won't be back by choice."
Kimberly Q.,"San Francisco, CA",388,242,43,4.0,6/11/2008,"Thumbs up to: 1. big screen TVs with decent acoustics (perhaps my future home away from home during football season); 2. great beer/bar menu and a very tasty filty goose martini; 3. deep dish pizzas for which people crave and come forth from the city (my dinner companion chose to drive from the city to this joint because of the buffalo chicken pizza--oh, and um for me too); 4. big-ass parking lot; 5. avocado egg rolls; 6. jamie who gave friendly and patient service in the bar with personality. Thumbs down to the whole chain and/or mall thing, but it does lend to #4 above."
Denise M.,"South San Francisco, CA",202,1022,8,5.0,8/2/2009,"This review is specifically for the Pina Chocotini that I've been recently introduced to.  Creamy, dreamy, delicious.  Asked our bartender Steve for something a cocktail recommendation based with coconut.  Now I have to learn how to make this at home.  Malibu rum with pineapple juice, Midori, whipped cream and a swirl of chocolate syrup.  OMG - I totally could have skipped dinner and just had a million of these all night.   Instead, I just had two.  ;)"
Ivana C.,"San Lorenzo, CA",1,5,,3.0,4/21/2009,"It was my first time eating at BJ's when I went yesterday with my friends; it was a quarter til five, on a monday. I seriously never heard of this place before, but when we entered in, it reminded me of a high class applebee's... and i'm not complaining. But damn, they had hella plasmas. I didn't count, but sheesh, what happened to saving energy. The wait for our tables wasn't long; it only took about under ten minutes but I've heard it gets pretty crowded near the end of the week. The waitress showed us to our seats and gave us the menus. When I opened my menu, a little stick with a hook and brush one the ends fell out. My friend told me it was a tool to clean ear pieces for for those that can't hear well. I was kind of disgusted.  Our server was really nice to us. He even apologized when he gave us the wrong pizzookie. 0__o My friends also told me he was flirting with me. I should say first that I was fifthwheelin' lol. I thought that was amusing though. haha. What bothered me was how long the wait was to get our food. It took what.... 30 maybe 45 minutes to bring out three entrees. It took super long to me! I was so hungry because I had not eaten the whole day.  I can't lie, the food I ate was delicious. I ordered the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza. It was pretty good. My friends ordered some spaghetti dish and some small burgers [i don't know what it's called right now] with some crispy fries. Good portions, decent price for it i guess.  For desert we ordered the Oreo pizzookie and the triple chocolate chunk pizookie. Like I said earlier, the server messed up the order and instead of the chocolate chunk pizookie, gave us the original one. It took another 5 some minutes for our dessert, but at least he apologized. All in all, I would like to come back again, and I hope that their management would improve: three stars!"
Selene K.,"San Francisco, CA",369,219,,4.0,3/25/2008,"Came here tonight to watch the Warriors vs Lakers game.  We got here a bit earlier, anticipating a big crowd for the game.  At first, there were not seats or tables near the bar area, so they sat us down at one of the booths across the room.  We were able to see the screen, but it was still a bit far.  After 15 minutes at the booth, we noticed a table available near the bar.  At that point, we had already gotten our drinks and appetizers (the chicken lettuce wrap and basil thin crust pizza, both were good).  The hostess said it was fine as long as we told our server. Bringing out our entrees, I apologized for inconveniencing her, but she was totally cool with it.  She helped us move all our stuff over and introduced us to our new server.  He was very attentive, just like the first one and we were able to enjoy an exciting game with no issues whatsoever.  Our server finished his shift and introduced us to our 3rd server.  She was extremely attentive as well.  I have to say, for a sports bar/brewery/restaurant, whatever you wanna call it, the service here (at least tonight) is way above par.  Usually, when you get servers changing shifts, going on breaks...things can get chaotic and you usually get left behind.  But we had a great experience here tonight and we even thought about coming back here the next time we want to watch a game with a big crowd.   Don't expect gourmet food...but what you can expect is decent food for its price, a lively ambiance (during game nights) with great service.  The beer is pretty good too!"
Sabrina L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,8,,2.0,12/20/2008,"You know, this restaurant is really a shame.  It's big, it's fun, it's a cross between your Chilis/Applebees/Fridays chain and Cheesecake Factory with its sprawling menu.  The decor is fine, it's a good location, and the food is actually pretty decent.  But the service is terrible. 50 minute wait on a Saturday evening, impressive for a place of this size.  Then, my ""Shirley Temple"" came out as a Sprite.  Once it was ""shirleyed"" there was no cherry, which is a no-no in my book. Then when my sourdough bacon cheeseburger came out, it was missing the bacon and cheese.  When we alerted them, we were told it would be a moment and they would fix it.  About 15 minutes later, when everyone else I was with had almost finished, it finally came back.  The manager said it would be on the house.  Lo and behold, when the check arrived, we were charged for it. So I'm not a fan of the way they do business here. However, the food is pretty good.  We started with Best Beginnings, the combo appetizer plate of mozzarella sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, santa fe springrolls and avocado egg rolls.  These are personally the appetizers I would least like to have in a combo platter; I think they should offer some more choice in that regard.  The mozzarella sticks were appropriately gooey and well-seasoned, and the avocado egg rolls were pretty good - and I don't usually like avocado.  Spring rolls were fine, and everyone loved the spinach and artichoke dip, although I found it too creamy and flat in flavor for my taste.  It needed some kick. My burger was also quite good.  A little too big to eat, and the beef could maybe have had more seasoning.  The sauce wasn't exactly well balanced either.  REALLY good french fries, though. Other dishes I'm told are good are the meatloaf sandwich and the Santa Fe salad.  I will have to report back on those, if I ever decide to try this place again.  Iffy given my experience with the service. Don't expect much, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I went in hoping for more."
Rick V.,"South San Francisco, CA",14,178,3,1.0,11/10/2007,"Words I'll never forget: 'Let's go to Tanforan for dinner!' When waiting a long time to be seated, you expect some gratification from a dining experience. The service is pretty poor. The food didn't suck, I guess... it's just when and how I got it. I would think they would like having to prepare a steak medium rare... less cooking time, less work... Yeah, I sent the thing back to have them try again... baked potato was pretty good unusually large. And all the pizzas looked pretty good... lots of folks ordered them. Too bad... I wanted steak. Look at all of the pizzas that were being served... So they cooked me another steak. I couldn't wait any more... the potato was getting cold. You can wait by the register. OR wait at the bar... have a salad, gnaw on the sprouts, order another micro beer, watch Alex Smith get sacked again. Watch the pizzas go by... Just don't order the steak."
Chatree T.,"San Francisco, CA",36,198,82,2.0,11/22/2007,"1 star for the awesome tequila mocking bird drink, and another for feeding me while I waited. I had the fish taco, it was very fishy. BLAH. The pazookie or whatever is not that great. It's just ice cream on top of a cookie! Wouldn't dine here again."
