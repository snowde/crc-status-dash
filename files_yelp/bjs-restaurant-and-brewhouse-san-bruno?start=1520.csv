claudia y.,"San Francisco, CA",749,997,2370,3.0,7/9/2009,"we came here on a tuesday night and this place was packed with people!  maybe summer makes people came out.  for 4 the wait was 15 to 20 minutes but i think they didnt call us until half an hour later.  they do have a call ahead list so thats probably a smarter option.  we ended up just sitting at the bar and eating there. our bartender was super friendly.  the bar had two bartenders total and even the other guy came to check in on us every once in a while. i had a jerry berry which is the berry cider mixed with the jeremiah red.  pretty good.  we all shared the brushetta, spinach dip, shrimp lettuce wraps, cobb salad, meat loaf entree, and a mediterranean pizza. the bruschetta was almost like a french toast. the tomatoes come in a bowl and you scoop it onto the buttery bread yourself.  the dip was a good consistency and very flavorful.  it came with red, blue and gold tortilla chips.  the shrimp lettuce wraps were good but spicy.  cobb salad had just lettuce, turkey, croutons, and cheese.  not like other cobbs i guess.  the meat loaf entree came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. the mediterranean pizza was just ok.  the crust is too thick and bready for me.  and i didnt like the olives."
Mosey S.,"San Francisco, CA",187,148,10,3.0,5/23/2011,"It's not worth any type of a wait but as far as volume cooking goes, it's good. Their specialty is the deep dish pizza, but they offer a very comprehensive menu that may be a challenge to any first-timers. Stick with the simple pastas, they are cheaper and healthier. Good for groups, good for families, good for having a few beers and watching the game."
Amy B.,"San Francisco, CA",245,387,3,3.0,5/21/2007,"As you know, for every rule there is an exception. As a rule, I HATE chain restaurants. Hate them. The food sucks, the prices are too high, and often the people eating there consider the Olive Garden as fine Italian dining. The exception to this rule is BJ's brewery. I have eaten at multiple BJ's across the state and consistently enjoy their food. The avocado egg rolls are great; the salads are fabulous, and huge; the sandwiches are perfect; and the stuffed baked potatoes are good. Of course, the only reason to go anywhere is for its dessert. The chocolate chip pizza cookie thingie is so super yummy.  So why only 3 stars? Well, as much as I enjoyed my cobb salad at my first time at this particular BJ's, it's difficult to enjoy when everything is so disgustingly dirty. The table was greasy, the menus looked (and felt!) like they hadn't been cleaned in a year, and every single peice of silverware we had received had to be replaced. And then even the replacement had to be wiped with a napkin. Now, I'm not a finicky germ phobe in the least, but this place even made me cringe. As much as I love the food and vibe at BJ's, I probably will not be returning to this particular location."
Winnie L.,"San Francisco, CA",121,141,977,4.0,6/29/2008,"I love restaurants like these, serving American-Italian food and deep dish pizza!  We came by here for dinner after shopping at the mall. The wait wasn't bad, around 20 mins. It was my first time and my best friend's experiences held me at high expectations. We ordered the wedge salad, classic stuffed potato and BJ's favorite deep dish pizza.  All of them were delicious and scrumptious. Great place for some classier comfort food."
Tiff W.,"San Francisco, CA",322,1286,143,4.0,10/4/2009,"I know I know, it's a chain BUT the food was good. I liked it. generous portions, came here a few times and each time I had a great time with the exception of one thing, waiting."
Wilson C.,"Fremont, CA",170,177,,4.0,5/9/2008,"My friend said I was supposed to give this place 5 stars because of the pizookie alone but I think I'll give it four until I go back and try their chicken sandwich, which I hear is the best ever.   We came here on a Tuesday night for dinner and the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday.  We had to wait half an hour for our table, which I don't know was necessary or not.  I saw some empty tables on our way to be seated.   The menu is huge.  They have quite a few things to choose from so you wont have to worry about not finding something you like.  If you're a beer fan, this is another one of those microbreweries in the bay.  I didn't try any of the beers so I can't say if it's good or not.   We ordered a couple pizzas to share and from what I know, they're known for their Pizza.  They have the deep dish Chicago style pizza which reminds me more of Pizza' Chicago than Zachary's (not layered with sauce on top).  We great white pizza was really good and I would recommend ordering that.  I thought the dough was really good but to me it resembles Pizza Hut dough, which I also really like. My friend who's been to several BJ's says they have the best chicken sandwich in the world so I will try that next time and perhaps that will earn this place an extra star. For dessert, they have this thing called a pizookie, which is a fresh baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream on it.  Sure, it sounds simple but when you bite into the warm cookie with the ice cream, it makes going to the restaurant worth while."
Zac Y.,"San Mateo, CA",0,14,75,1.0,1/15/2013,"the only reason why i will give them a star is because they have good wings there, other than that is really no reason to go there, the staff is not professional, me and 6 of my friends was waited for 30 mins at the front desk, not even one of them come say anything, i wonder why don't these people just quit their job if they are so unwanted to service people."
Laura U.,"San Francisco, CA",57,8,11,3.0,8/21/2008,"My favorite is the avocado rolls..Yummm! Love them!  I enjoy their beer selection but when you sit at their bar, service takes forever!"
AhLin C.,"San Francisco, CA",127,575,6,3.0,4/29/2010,"Can't complain about their pizza really.  It's really good!!  However, service is not that great. There is a long wait all the time and of course us being San Franciscans turn our nose up at chain restaurants. But nevertheless, come and order their pizza.  They are like Cheesecake Factory.  It's really good and fun once in awhile."
Pauline L.,"San Francisco, CA",83,588,,3.0,6/2/2008,"You lost me at ""2 hour waiting time"". Our lively group of 8 which dropped down to 6 when we finally did the head count likened this place rather like reading a bad trashy novel with no plot and crappy love scenes. You think you're going to make it to the end, but it keeps going on and on..sigh... The food isn't bad when we weren't waiting for our food for half an hour. It's not that long to make a salad guys. I got the New England clam chowder. The clams were minced into teeny tiny pieces, not chunks...but the potato to meat ratio is quite good. The breadbowl is french crust, not sourdough...and they toast the top with garlic and parsley..yummers. Everyone else was losing what sad marbles we had left after watching Indy 4. The movie is definitely suspend the reality bit, but it was popcorn fare after all. 2 hour movie plus heavy food = sleepyheads. Good parking situation and nice food court. It's not Dave and Busters so the wait is kinda weird. Eh...you get what you get when you come."
Binary G.,"Austin, TX",2,14,,2.0,1/5/2011,"The four hostesses standing in front didn't greet us for about 2 minutes, even though we were standing right in front of them.  Our server was good, and the burger was really good.  The rest of the staff were on the rude side; hence the 2 stars."
S. H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,27,,2.0,4/13/2009,"This is the only restaurant where I have sent my food back on two seperate occasions.  The first time the deep dish pizza was ice cold by the time it arrived at our table.  The server said he forgot about it.  The second time (a seperate visit months later) the deep dish pizza was so burnt the server volunteered to send it back to the kitchen. There is always a line, but I dont think this is worth waiting for,"
Kevin I.,"Concord, CA",1,5,,4.0,2/26/2009,I love BJ's mostly because of the beer...I really enjoy the atmosphere. It is laid back and not too loud so it is easy to talk with friends and relax with some drinks and pizza.  I just tried the Pumpkin Ale on a whim and...IT WAS DELICIOUS. It definately has a different yet pleasant taste and now it gives me another excuse to go out there on the weekends.
Gracie-C Y.,"San Francisco, CA",76,307,2,3.0,9/9/2007,"Slummin' in the Peninsula Part IV Welcome to me and the wifey's fourth (and final) installment of what we call ""slummin' in the peninsula"". You see, we've done some soul-searching lately. Some people have accused us of losing touch with the ""common-folk""... of forgetting our roots. Well we decided to show them.  We'll prove to you all that we're not above the common man, that we'll get our hands dirty if necessary, and that we have a soft spot in our cold little hearts for the ""little people"". - I suggested to wifey that we stroll the Tenderloin, but she crossed that off our list because the parking's too tough. - Was gonna try Bayview-Hunter's Point, but I just had the car detailed. - Thought about giving Oakland a spin, but couldn't scrape together the change to cross the bridge. So wifey and I decide to mingle with the commoners on the Peninsula.   And what better place to rub elbows with the commoners than a brewpub? We saw quaint people, quaint food, and quaint beer. Food was good, nothing earth-shattering, but honest-to-goodness, salt of the earth type grub. Good pizzas, damn good pizookies! After our experience of bonding with the heathens, we went home and took a long hot shower to rinse the humanity off our precious skin and demanded our butler, Jeeves to burn our clothes immediately. It'll be quite some time before we mingle with the masses again!"
Neil A.,"Montara, CA",33,147,2,2.0,10/25/2010,"Minus one star for changing reservation policy when they feel like it.  Yeah that's right....  BJs is one of  those places that refuses to take reservations so when it's busy you just have to get the obligatory vibrator and wait your turn. That's how its always been so that's what you come to expect. I always sit in the bar 'cause that area is first come first serve. Well, when the Giants were playing game 5 of the NL series I decided to head over to BJs early to watch the game only to find reserved tables in the bar....  Total Bullshit to change how things are done for an important game.  If I'd known I would have planned accordingly and gone somewhere else.  Needless to say I won't be heading over there for any of the World Series and I may just write them off all together."
Leticia S.,"Daly City, CA",3,7,,5.0,9/19/2009,"Love this place!  This is the go to spot for me and my besties.  Sometimes waiting for a seat near the bar or even for a table can take forever, but at the end of the meal, I'm always in a happy mood leaving BJs.   I recommend the white zin, ""a drink like that"", and the berry burst cider for drinks...yum yum yum. And I just recently had the chicken pot stickers--not so bad--but my buddies and I always order the avacado eggrolls even if we're not that hungry! lol and if I'm feeling extra NOT hungry I order the chocolate chip pazookie. lol my favorite! everything else is good so I recommend ordering anything from the menu."
Tracy Y.,Bay Area,131,148,396,2.0,5/12/2010,"This place is REALLY slow. It's okay if you're busy catching up with friends so you don't notice that you've been sitting there for 15 minutes or more before they even take your order. The waiters don't really come to check up on you wither. Tonight was the third time I've been to this location and I ordered the meatloaf sandwich because I had that last time it was really good. The onion strings and mashed potatoes on top of the meatloaf and bread is so good. However, tonight's meatloaf sandwich was okay, but definitely not as good as it was last time. Also, their mango mojito tasted like orange soda somehow? I don't know, I think this BJ's failed me this time."
Jenny W.,"San Francisco, CA",6,26,,3.0,10/23/2008,"Came here for my sister's birthday lunch with the family. We had 2 different waitresses serving our table. The food portions are very generous and the prices are fair. They take reservations for large parties.  They messed up on my brother's order and brought out a garden burger when he ordered a regular cheeseburger. The manager came out to apologize, gave him the cheeseburger on the house. Great customer service!"
Peggy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,604,43,4.0,2/22/2007,"BJ's here deserve four stars for handling a group of 18 beautifully.  Waiter couldve been a little more friendly but the food came out at a good time and they worked well with me when I needed to surprise the boyfriend with a big cake.  Topped with free candles.  The food is consistent and I think it's a lot better than most other chain food restaurants.  It's a fun atmosphere, very laid back and we all had plenty of room to talk, drink lots of beer, and have a good time.  I like their bartenders too.  My recommendation for the go-to place for a large birthday party.  Variety in menu means something for everyone! But I just can't give five stars to a chain restaurant. But this is as good as it gets in surburbia!"
Melissa L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",109,38,,3.0,11/5/2007,"I have to say I like the layout of the restaurant.  It seems very spacious and open.  I like their bar area and all the tv screens they have.  This is a good place for college kids, and even for some business people (since it's located next to a lot of companies, like Apple), and It also closes late. I don't come here for the food because honestly its not very impressive.  However, try their beer; you can go from a blonde to a stout with everything in between.   The best reason to come here, and the reason I keep coming back is their Pizookie!  Basically it's a cookie with vanilla bean ice cream that you can probably make at home, but it's freakin good!  My fave is the chocolate chunk.  Mmmm. Yum!"
