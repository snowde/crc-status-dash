Angie C.,"Oakland, CA",119,430,6,4.0,12/3/2006,"Yes, it's a chain... but it's an awesome chain.  I used to frequent the one in Westwood back in my college years.  This one is just as good - actually better. It's bigger, with open spaces, and an outside area.  The outside area is great in nice weather.   They have a lunch special which I get often.  It comes with a small pizza and a salad.   I am in LOVE with their pizookies.  Oh my gosh, soooooo good.  I usually get chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top, but have mixed it up a few times and gotten 1/2 white choc macadamia 1/2 choc. chip.  Equally amazing! Also, they have good beers.  I'm partial to the nutty brewnette."
Larry A.,"San Francisco, CA",94,259,33,3.0,3/5/2007,"Typical chain experience here.  Nothing to add, except don't order the French Dip.   It's small and served on an over sized flimsy hot dog bun that dissolves when you dip it in the au jus.  I hate that.  Not a good value.  Shoulda stuck with the pizza.  My wife ordered the NY strip.  It came with a football sized baked potato.  HUGE!  The steak was...eh, not bad, but not worth the 18.95.  Not bad tasting, but not a great value either.    Despite the lack luster dinner, it's not a bad place to kill time while your wife spends your paycheck in the mall."
patrick o.,"San Francisco, CA",94,199,1,3.0,6/13/2007,"Like all good things you can't have it too much.  I have been here now probably about 5-6 times, everytime it seems to get worse.  The first couple of times, it felt like the spot to be.  Good beer, good pizza, a million tvs playing sports, good crowd, decent decor.  Then the pizza didn't taste as good, beer sets in as beer belly and all of a sudden theres a freaking bunch of kids running around like its chuckecheese.  Why does everything that adults like have to be pussied up for the kids?  Can't adults go anywhere anymore?  Vegas at first?  D&B's?  What's next kid platters at stripclubs?  This place is always crowded.  I don't think I have ever NOT had to wait at least 20-45 minutes.  The food isn't too bad, I like the Great white pizza, the pasta is bland and the appetizers can be decent from time to time as long as you're not outside and have the food turn to frozen in the San Bruno polar caps."
Carmina C.,"San Bruno, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/9/2013,"Crap service. We ordered over the phone, waited about an hour to pick it up, and when we got there, we were told no order under my name was in the system. They asked us if we wanted to order again, but we were starving and didn't want to wait another 30 minutes."
Ken B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,480,11,3.0,3/29/2008,"For what this place does, it's always incredibly busy during the lunch hour.  We choose this place for group lunches from the office.  I'm not sure why, because it's always very crowded at lunchtime.   The service is always friendly and attentive.  The menu is sufficiently diverse, too. A co-worker had one of those giant stuffed potatoes, it must have been some GM hybrid because it looked about 2-3 lbs!  I like the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  They use some nice multi-grain bread.   Of course the main attraction would be the big beer selection and sports on HDTV everywhere.  This isn't the perfect lunch atmosphere for me, and when you're not into the game, it is just useless background noise."
Lisa L.,"Millbrae, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/6/2013,I am a big fan of chain restaurants.  I've been here many times.  I usually ordered balsamic glazed chicken and parmesan crusted chicken breast....bruschetta to start with.  Food was great as always.  I gave it 4 stars because food portions are much smaller than it used to be.
Dee D.,"San Francisco, CA",300,455,2044,5.0,7/15/2009,"Wow, surprise, surprise, I have always wanted to try this place, and what a shock! Great service @ the bar, after 10pm happy hour, FREE BEER SAMPLES! LOVE IT! I will be back!"
A L.,"San Francisco, CA",5,77,2,2.0,11/30/2007,"I've been here a total of three times. The first time, not happy. The second time, super not happy. My freaking salad was 98.2 percent lettuce and the rest was a pinch of eggs, bacon, and other crap that I couldn't remember because why? BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE IT ON MY SALAD. The third time?  Not bad. You exceeded my expectations. Our waiter was good and the food was actually better.  Yeah for the angel hair pasta. BJ's, I sort of forgive you for my lettuce salad......"
kiki d.,"San Francisco, CA",24,238,,4.0,2/7/2008,"-great spinach artichoke dip (sometimes we get two orders) -Good deep dish is hard to find on this coast...nummy :) Takeout is relatively pain free. On a Thursday / Friday night, it takes about 30 minutes from ordering to receiving the food (including a deep dish pizza). Sometimes they walk around handing out free pizza...:)"
Omar B.,"San Francisco, CA",195,23,1,4.0,1/7/2010,bj's is cool..i've found myself visiting a lot more lately since i just turned 21.. haha..but anyway i tend to come here later in the night for either a quick beer and some quite tasty appetizers.. the main reason why i come here later at night is because i want a snack late at night and its open and the restaurant has a very comfy and cozy environment.. the thai shrimp lettuce wraps are SO GOOD! i pretty much only order appetizers here but if you do decide to order something larger...the deep dish pizza's are really good!! try coming by when its not typical lunch and dinner time because this place gets PACKED!..like over an hour wait PACKED! 4 stars!
Naima B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",60,36,,3.0,6/24/2010,"Although this may be a great restaurant for watching the upcoming game and having a few drinks, the food is so-so for dinner. One great dish that i had was the small appetizer- mozzarella and tomato salad, which was excellent and just the right size with great flavor. i was disappointed though with their calzone (spinach and artichoke) although the server seemed to rave about it....it just didnt seem to have much flavor. I would prefer to come here for lunch and grab a deep dish pizza with a salad for $5.95 and call it a meal!"
Jennifer H.,"Daly City, CA",0,21,1,1.0,1/15/2013,"Where to start! I guess I will start with the pros. BJ's have a great pazookie and the pizza and wings are pretty good! Okay, now with the bad.. This place does NOT have the best service for starters. Their drinks are expensive and nOT great.. Okay, here goes the bIG one- I have some teenagers from my work who went out to eat here. They ordered non alcoholic drinks seeing how they are NOT of age to drink and had no desire to do so. The server brought them alcoholic beverages which they were not aware until they took a sip of the drinks. This is unexceptable. If I were the parent of these children- I would have sued bJs, I wish the parents took it further, however, they did not."
Antonio A.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/12/2013,"Food was good and Customer service was alright but toward the end of our family lunch, we ordered 3 pizookies.  2 chocolate chip and 1 raspberry white chocolate almond. We waited for 30 minutes or so for them. The waiter brought 2 chocolate chips out but not the raspberry. He told us that it would take a few more minutes...we waited another 15 minutes until the waiter came by and told us the cookers messed up on the raspberry order and asked if i wanted to wait or remove that order from our check. I asked how long more would I wait for the raspberry pizookie and he said  10 minutes.  I told him forget it and just remove it from my check...but then, I waited for more then 5 minutes for my check (I could of just waited for the damn pizookie). They just didn't seem sincere about us waiting for so long."
An N.,"Hilo, HI",132,73,18,4.0,4/4/2010,"I love this place for Happy Hour.  The South Bay is seriously lacking a good place to drink post-work and this place has awesome food and BEER BEER BEER.  Nothing like a pitcher of Hef/Blue Moon to pair with a tasty pizza, hot wings or lettuce wraps.  Happy Hour discounts are quite reasonable too.  Half price on single sized pizzas and a couple of bucks off of beer.  Only downside is the lack of parking.  But Apple is very generous with their parking lot so that's BJ's saving grace.  Definitely try this place out for a casual evening with some friends."
E Y.,"Daly City, CA",0,9,,2.0,1/7/2013,"The food was ""ok"" but I could not enjoy it because the service was so bad.  I went on a Saturday night so I guess that was mistake number 1. I waited in line to put my name on the list and the place was so chaotic it turns out I was in the wrong line. Even though the person who told me this was standing next to the person taking names, she sent me to a different line. Then I waited for 25 mins just to get a pager! Finally I found an open seat at the bar instead. By the time I managed to get a menu my pager had finally gone off. Everything else was painfully slow. Getting a glass of water... ordering my meal.... getting a fork to be able to eat my meal....  at least I knew why my dessert took so long to come out... because it was burnt."
Efrain T.,"Pacifica, CA",46,146,45,3.0,3/25/2012,"Why do the appetizers always show up at the same time as the entrees? Even if I ask the waiter/waitress that I want to start off with an appetizer, they either bring it with the entree or completely forget it. Last visit, our Jay Baruchel-looking waiter delivered our pizza without our salad and fried artichoke appetizers. The artichokes came about 10 minutes after the pizza but we decided to cancel the salad. Granted the pizza is still good, but I think I might have to avoid going on the weekends because the staff doesn't seem to have their A-game."
Carol Y.,"San Francisco, CA",446,942,526,3.0,12/21/2006,"not that great and not that bad either. if i was to wait for a long time to eat, i rather go to cheesecake factory but Bj's is definitely a great place for beer and sports!"
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,6/30/2007,The atmostphere is nice and the service is good but the food is only mediocre.  The pizookies are tasty but not all it's hyped up to be.
Mike G.,"San Francisco, CA",78,67,21,4.0,9/5/2008,I think the food is good an d the portions are generous. Service is OK but could be better. My experience when I have gone there is that the waiter and the person delivering the food do not have a system of knowing who gets what. It really bugs me that the server is always asking us who gets what.
Jin B.,"San Francisco, CA",853,202,105,2.0,9/17/2009,"I don't understand why, but BJ's is ALWAYS so packed.  Hasn't the pizookie craze gone down yet?  Seriously?  And the beers are alright.  Why can't we make reservations ahead of time?  Someone needs to change that, because the first come first serve thing, ain't workin', and you lose business quick that way.  I used to really like appetizers.  But I think the quality has gone down due to the recession...?  Happy Hour is always great though here.  But if there were any OTHER bar availble in the San Bruno area...I would DEFINITELY much would rather go elsewhere than here."
