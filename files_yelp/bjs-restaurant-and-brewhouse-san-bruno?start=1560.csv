Nelson W.,"San Francisco, CA",145,363,133,3.0,11/22/2006,"OK, so when I see a new brewery, whether it is in a mall next to Barnes and Noble or on a corner in the Haight, I generally get kind of fired up.  I was fired up when I saw this place on the way back from a long trip to Lowe's.  After all it was 5pm on a Saturday and we had to eat *something*...(Translation, this place is in a mall next to a Barnes and Noble in San Bruno) We walked into this place, and for those who haven't seen it, it is a large restaurant room with a large bar area.  The bar has a massive TV screen that generally has ESPN or some other sports related thing on it.  The screen is big enough that there can be 4 different TV channels on it at the same time. So far so good. They have a full bar, and 5-6 micro brews (house beers).  Check. We order beers, and get the small novel that  they call a menu.  Typical stuff, upscale for an Applebee's would be my best description.  Burgers, salads, sandwiches.  They also have pizza. We got the beer, it was fine.  Nothing to write home about, but not Bud-Light-Ice-Dry--Ice-with-lime either.   Ordered the bbq chicken pizza.  It was pretty good.  It was very good. The service was decent, but they were definitely busy.  We had to wait a bit for the check.   In short, you could worse for a meal, but better is definitely a possiblity as well. I had the Jeremiah Red, which was kinda sweet.  The Porter is my favorite."
Andreia A.,"San Mateo, CA",4,4,,4.0,8/22/2009,"Loved the place! Had a fun time with my friends, good apettizers and drinks and fabulous beer! I will sure go there again!"
Sha s.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/15/2012,"Went for an early lunch with a friend yesterday and regretted it. Had a disinterested server who served tea late ( at $2.75 for one cup of hot water!) , failed to bring one of us water, was late with the check and never asked how we were doing. The food was barely warm. They were not busy when we went so can't explain this. I like their menu and prices but will not visit this location again!"
gordon g.,"San Francisco, CA",384,96,5,4.0,1/19/2010,"The wait was mighty long but we walked for a litle bit in the Mall.  We had da big ass Nacho's for appetizer. For mains we ordered my Baby back baby back ribs, ooooh they were so off da bone yummy and a deep dish Mediteranean Pizza. Everything came out tasty and hot, we were stuffed after eating most of it up.  Definitely the place to go if you're hungry cuz the portions are large enough to fill ya."
J P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",56,192,26,3.0,4/3/2008,"Slow service at the bar made this evening much longer than it needed to be. My girlfriend and I met here as a mid-point between her Marin apartment and my Peninsula apartment. I was a bit late and she spent the time studying the tome of a menu. We both had white wine from the pretty decent wine list. I had the fish tacos. Not great. The ""guacamole"" was this weird creamy bland concoction and the ""salsa"" was watery and boring - a little smoky, but otherwise flavorless. The fish itself was good, but the whole dish lacked spice. Just ridiculous. GF had a good-looking salad with breaded chicken and seasoned wedge fries. The fries may have been the best of everything; they were plentiful and really cheap - $3.95 I think. There were about three people behind the bar. Sometimes. Since I was never offered water, when I tried to order some there was absolutely no one behind the bar. We were asked once ""how is everything"", which is fine, but how often is it that you actually know what you need when they come by to ask? Almost never for me. So when I did need something, the place was a ghost-town. I'll be back (maybe) because the location is so convenient for us to meet, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."
Marlon E.,"San Bruno, CA",411,80,109,4.0,3/28/2008,"Whenever I go to BJ's, I usually get the Great White pizza and a chocolate chip pizookie.  Yeah, not ideal for those who are on a diet, but if you're in the mood for indulging, why not go all the way? I've had all of their beers, and...they were alright.  Didn't really blow me away or anything, although I'm not actually that big of a beer drinker. Yeah, the food is a bit pricey for its size, but it's oh so good.  Especially the pizookie--a big, warm, chocolate chip cookie with some vanilla ice cream scoops on top.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water, haha.  So simple.  What a great invention.  By the way, they give it away for free if it's your birthday, too. I've only been to 2 BJ's--the one here, and the one in Cupertino.  Overall, I would say that both are the same.  Pretty good food, average prices, good service."
Ryo S.,"San Jose, CA",35,172,16,3.0,10/8/2006,I love some of their own beer. The food tastes ok and they give you big portions.  BJ's is where I go to when I have a sudden craving for grilled food or I need to watch some major sport event on a big screen. (Any suggestion for other places with big screen in the neighborhood? Shoot me a message!)
kristen b.,"San Francisco, CA",144,87,14,4.0,10/28/2006,"Don't hate me for liking BJ's.  Come here for happy hour. It's great. The appetizers are such a deal at 1/2 price. The beer sampler is too - equal to about 3 beers. Great for watching sports on the many big screens. The mini pizzas are also 1/2 price.  I really like BJ's pizza. The crust is soft and thick. The pepperoni comes with diced tomatoes. Lovely.  The pizookies are delightful. A hot, fresh baked cookie in your choice of flavor(s) with a scoop of ice cream on top - how is that wrong?  The salads are ok. They're also extremely large. Almost too large.  The chicken tenders are yummy. A nice, seasoned, crunchy outside coating and tender, juicy chicken inside. MMmmmmm.  I always get excited when I can convince people to come with me to BJ's and prove to them that it's really not that bad."
Amber G.,"Campbell, CA",14,180,2,4.0,3/13/2007,"I like BJs Brewery.  Their food is good and service is usually pretty friendly as well.  We've been several times and usually we get a table right away. My son loves their kid's menu...although he usually only orders the Mac&Cheese.   My husband's fav?  The Meatloaf or Meatball sandwich.  (I forget the name). I have two favorites:  I like getting the Salad/Baked Potato combo:  Caesar salad and Broccoli Chicken Potato.  They even let me order this after 4 pm!  Usually they only offer this for lunch, but everytime I've ordered it at night, they give it to me--no problem! My other fav?  The Buffalo Chicken Pizza (Mini).  Aaahh!  Delicious!  Pefect mix of Buffalo and Ranch!  Be sure you order Ranch on the side as well for a few extra calories! Oh!  The Chocolate Chip Cookie!  We had a birthday girl last night and so they brought us one to share!  I think my son ate most of it!  Ooops!  I don't blame him!  Fresh Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream melting on top?  My little idea of HEAVEN! **CAUTION**  I give this restaurant 4 stars because of that stupid hardwood floor!  I almost break my neck each time I've been there trying to get into the bathroom!  I slip and slide all over the place!  I have to take little tiny baby steps to make sure I get there in one piece!  Make sure you hold onto the handrail!  Be VERY careful when you are on this floor...unless you are wearing sneakers!  They need more handrails and signs posted if they are going to keep such a dangerous floor!  YIKES!"
Henry L.,"Renton, WA",88,84,12,3.0,7/5/2007,"All that hype about this place. Once you've been here you'll be reminded of all the other places.  such as TGIF.  Food is what you can expect, it's good, but it's not extraordinary good......especially for the 2 hour wait.  The pizza was good, but still not worth the 2 hour wait. I think we ate more waiting at the bar area, eating appitizers, which was tasty as well, but not super good. 3 stars, subtract two for the wait and the variety of food that long of a wait."
Grace R.,"Cerritos, CA",45,62,,3.0,2/14/2010,"It's a really a-ok average restaurant. The wait is long depending on which day you go. Valentine's Day....2 hours last year. Yeah, it was a last minute plan. The food is pretty good. I always order the honey crisp chicken salad and I like the happy hours where personal pans are only $5 with half-off selected appetizers, but the wait after you get a table is ridiculous. I know it is not all of the waiters' fault because they seem like they're trying their best to hurry up and be on time, but I always notice that there are not enough staff working, especially during the busy times. I know BJ's might be trying to save a little money cutting down on the staff, but please, to an extent. Not 5 people working for 60 guests. Other than that, it's ok. Go here if you need a late night snack or if you have time to kill."
Lily X.,"San Francisco, CA",0,88,2,3.0,7/28/2008,"Good food, Long wait, reasonably priced.  Quite dark inside, but nothing wrong with that.. its got a comfy feeling to it.. :] -x3 shells"
Janell Y.,"San Francisco, CA",70,103,,2.0,3/3/2009,"The food here is like your average chain of restaurants like Chili's, Macaroni Grill and so forth so it's a given there will be plenty of good stuff on the menu that's a little over priced. Not to mention, their pizookies are the bomb but of course how can you go wrong with warm cookies & ice cream? Now I have to say most people come for the pizookies, pizza and alcohol because the bar is crackin and it's open late. They also make their own beers which are pretty damn good. By the sound of it, it would seem I'd rate this a 3 star at least but I'd have to say their service is horrible. It's not that their entirely rude or anything but it's just horrible. The hosts/hostesses half the time aren't paying attention and are busy chatting up a storm with each other. I don't really care much for it until it takes forever for them to stop talking so I can tell them I want to sit. When I do finally sit down, my server usually disappears or forgets something like my water. Or my salad. Or my dinner mates soup. Or an entire order while out with a huge group. I know service can't always be perfect but you'd think it would happen at least once, even when it's just me and another person but nope, it hasn't. The service is even worse when it's a huge group, it takes hours to get seated and they don't allow you to reserve. I don't know why they don't because the one in San Jose does and I believe they get a lot more business then here. I understand if it takes a long time to seat a huge party but for the times when it took forever (1-2 hours), the place wasn't busy at all. Eh. I've been here on more than several occasions, usually with a large group and I've been there a few times with just me and another and nothing has ever improved. I don't really know how to explain it. The place is alright but the service sucks and it's not the ""omg I can't believe that just happened"" type of service. It's the basic things they seem to have forgotten and if you can tolerate that then this isn't so bad of a place. As for me, this wouldn't be the first or really last place to want to go to with a bunch of my friends."
Hyung L.,"San Francisco, CA",217,414,12,3.0,8/24/2009,"Place is one of the few ""chain"" type Elephant Bar'ish type places open serving food until 11 on a Sunday. I used to live across the street also. It's pretty typical of a type place like this. Decent bar food menu. Pizza burgers. Gargantuan baked potatoes and deep dish is kinda their specialty. Nice bar. It would get more stars but in comparison to an Elephant bar the drinks are definitely pricier. It's decent though."
Marc E.,"Daly City, CA",63,172,4,3.0,9/15/2008,"Nice place to dine with friends and family. There's an outdoor area with heat torches to keep you warm if you decide to eat outside. Nice! They also have a nice bar area. Some great American food. They have some good appetizers. I loved the Cuban Hamburger and the Jambalya. I wanna try the other entrees soon! Parking is aiight, what do you expect, it's at the Tanforan mall."
Sal T.,"San Mateo, CA",0,15,2,1.0,11/1/2010,I have gone once before - and it was good.  A little pricey but worth it.  I went back recently - only to be snubbed.  My girlfriend and I went to try and eat there - I guess they just didn't want my money.  I say this because we never got any service.  Not even a drink order.  For a franchise this is a carnal sin - regardless of how busy you are. Checking. On. Your. Tables. Is. Key.  I think it will be quite some time before before I waste more of mine here again.
Tara W.,"San Bruno, CA",11,11,,3.0,5/17/2010,"BJ's is a place I have gone to quite a few times, in both, a small group or an after work dinner with my entire team.  Pizza, well they do have GREAT PIZZA! And well their Chicken Fried Steak is great and enough for two, just remember to ask for extra gravy!! I have had a wide variety of food choices and can't remember one that I didn't like.  Beer here is pretty good too, I am a stout girl myself , so sorry that is all I can judge.  But, the reason I am starting this is because they must have quick turnover on their waitstaff.  I can't ever remember seeing the same person in there twice and on my visit on Friday for lunch with two coworkers one of us received their soup (for the soup/sandwich combo) WAY before the other and we couldn't find our waiter in the mean time.  I just thought of that is very odd! Granted, I will be going there again!"
JessePanda C.,"San Francisco, CA",1346,371,17180,4.0,2/23/2010,"i always order my ""OLD FASHIONED POT ROAST"" man, its the bomb... ate it once and i always love it... customer service is ok, i won't blame it when its busy but im full everytime im out of this place... love the vibe and the atmosphere..."
Robin L.,"San Francisco, CA",12,335,216,3.0,1/13/2008,"The reason I come here is for the drinks. When you have plans with others and they want to head over to tanforan, get a quick drink or pitcher. It makes it more fun shopping.  Been here a couple times, service depends on the staff. Sometimes we get excellent friendly service, and sometimes it's the worst. The waiter takes everyones order but yours and walks away, then realizes later that they forgot to take your order.    The food here sucks, taste like every other franchise food place. Nothing special. Skip your meal and just get drinks. But the dessert pizookie is a must have"
Zell C.,"San Francisco, CA",70,425,23,3.0,12/13/2005,"On a Friday night, the wait was 45 minutes for 2. WOW! But since it was my first time at the newly renovated Tanforan, we spent those 45 minutes roaming around the mall like pubescents.   The food was okay, but nothing special. My portion of pasta was big enough for two meals. The beer was good. I was surprised that the service was pretty attentive, considering how packed the place was. I loved the chocolate chip pazookie (??) with ice cream on top---which was probably the highlight of my meal.   Overall, nothing really impressed me to make me want to come here often."
