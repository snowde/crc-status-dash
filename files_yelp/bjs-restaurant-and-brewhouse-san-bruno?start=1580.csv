Kel S.,"San Francisco, CA",119,290,42,3.0,3/9/2007,"Ever since this place opened up in Tanforan, the establishments around this area seemed to get hipper.   However, for whatever reason, this BJ's is still a notch below the BridgePoint one in Foster City. At this BJ's, you get everything you expect from a large-scale restaurant operation: good food, nice portions, friendly wait staff, and cool amenities (awesome bar for watching the game).   The menus are the same at every BJ's, so here are our top picks: Sante Fe Salad, Avocado Egg Rolls, Halibut Fish Tacos, Sourdough Burger, ALL of its Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas, and of course, the Pizookie-- a freshly baked cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream.  With all of this being said, you do NOT come to BJ's if you're watching your weight. The only grip we have about this particular BJ's is their service.  It's very inconsistent.  We hypothesize that it depends on the hour you dine, but it seems like whenever we go to the BJ's in Foster City, the staff is more attentive and responsive."
Jon D.,"Hayward, CA",34,142,,3.0,7/26/2007,"Setting:  I dunno, I've come here quite a few times, and it's getting less and less well kept.  The place is starting to smell humid, like old wet mops that's been used over and over.  The ramp going up to the bar area is slippery.  At least the restroom is still clean.  But if you're there with the guys to watch sports, you probably wouldn't care about the smell.  Lots of TVs to watch your favorite teams.  Still a fun atmosphere. Food:  The burgers aren't bad at all.  I've tried the Sourdough burger and the Crispy Chicken burger...very good.  Price is pretty cheap...~$12/pp. Service:  The wait can get pretty long.  It's a mall afterall, it can get very busy.  But once you're seated, you get full attention from the waiters.  They are very nice, always attentive."
Michelle W.,"Daly City, CA",225,280,4,2.0,8/13/2007,"I do not understand why this place is ever packed or why people would wait here.  The only reason I would come back to this place is for their Pizookie.  Everything else there is pretty crappy. I came here for my dear Erica's birthday.  It was a Sunday and we had to wait despite a reservation.  The beers kept us busy and they were good.  When we finally got seated, we got a chance to order.  I couldn't decide what to get because nothing was appealing.  I finally decided on a chicken tender sandwich with fries.  It was small and measly and $9 (so NOT worth it).   I would recommend that you come here if you like to waste your precious money on subpar overpriced food."
Elyn S.,"San Francisco, CA",3,22,,4.0,8/25/2007,"I've ended up going to BJ's a couple of times with different people, and I have to admit I've always had a really good time. Maybe I've been lucky, but I've also always had good service, including quick with the drinks.  I like their Brewhouse Blonde and the Berry Blast Cider (that last one is a first for me, I don't usually get sweet drinks).  Both served nice and cold. I usually get the fish and chips, beer battered.  They've always done a good job on the fish, not overcooked and dry.  Nice and moist. Their warm chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream was really good. And the bathroom was clean... always a plus."
Lily T.,"San Francisco, CA",128,206,11,3.0,9/13/2007,"Food there is alrite.. first time going there.. i ordered a mini dish pizza.. when it came.. i put pepper suddenly the cap fell out and pepper spilled all over my pizza... luckily the waiter saw it and he said he get me a new one... yippee... remember doing the same trick at a pizza joint.. who know..? it might happen to u one day.... their alcohol is kool, one tastes like root beer.."
Mark L.,"Newark, CA",6,37,,3.0,10/15/2007,"Came here to watch some Sunday football since Jack's in Fremont was packed with a huge wait. Immediately went to the bar and they didnt even have the Raiders game on. I know im on the peninsula but isnt this the bay area. After i asked for the raider game they put it on the small tv and left the Pats Cowboys game on the big screen. Ridiculous.... but there beers are good, and i highly reccomend the honey mustard chicken salad. Yes, its your typical chain restaurant food, but for the most part their food is well prepared and they have good service."
Sal L.,"Dublin, CA",147,47,9,4.0,3/15/2010,"You can never go wrong with there deep dish pizza, good beer, and a pozookie for dessert to top it off."
Jenn M.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/25/2011,The only reason I give this place one star is because their food is sooo good but the wait staff is crap. The first time my husband and I had a bad experience with our un-attentive waiter it took forever to get plates for our appetizers and our dishes were starting to take over our table and food kept getting brought out. We even piled our plates real high and placed on the edge of the table to see if our waiter or ANYONE would notice. Nope. My husband was pissed that all these waiters kept walking by and not picking up dishes he had to actually get up and place it on a table behind him.  we let it slide and went back another time. Another time our waitress was more attentive to the table of six behind us. Our last time our waitress was moody and it took her twenty minutes to bring out two waters and a lemonade for my son. Then our food is brought to us by our food runner and we needed a few things. Our waitress was no where to be found. Tried flagging down other waiters and they just quickly walked by our tables as if they didn't notice us. Then a waitress shows up at our table and informs us that she will be taking care of us while our other waitress went on a fifteen. So our waitress was acting like a huffy little bitch because she was due for a break. As we were walking to our car we vowed to never come back to this place. Deep dish pizza.... I will miss you
Peter T.,"Daly City, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/22/2010,Has gone downhill over the past year or so. Last two times were not good. Had the Pizza but both times under cooked and not very tasty. Might be good for the fun and drinks but don't go for the pizza!
Carolyn H.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,61,1,5.0,10/21/2006,Beer samplers and kick-ass deep dish pizza - just a BART ride away.   Heaven.  Just Heaven.
Justin L.,"Daly City, CA",189,151,1,3.0,2/26/2007,"FRIED FOOD.... Ok, so I should have had a little more input on the food i was consuming during my friends' bday celebration, but we ended up with the awesome blossom like onion appetizer, buffalo chicken wing pizza, and artichoke chip dip. The server was great, she was the most friendly person I encountered during that day, so hats off to the wait staff. My suggestion is salad if you go to BJ's"
K Dizzle C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/9/2012,"Second time here and had an even worse experience than before. Shame on me for thinking otherwise, I guess. We were sat down promptly, as it wasn't busy when we got there, but then our server disappears for 20 minutes. Finally, she comes around and gets our appetizers jotted down along with our pizza order. Then, a new waiter shows up and informs us that he would be taking over our table. Ok, that's fine, I think to myself, but then our pizza shows up before several of our appetizers and different waiters brought out each dish! So now we wait another 25 minutes before we see the second guy that helped us again and had to ask another waiter in the area to get him for us, and all he had to say was ""you ordered something else?"" We finally got our last appetizer after we had finished the others and the pizza, but of course it was already cold from sitting on a counter somewhere for too long. AND he forgot to refill our drinks after asking him TWICE. It wasn't even busy, but there was disoreintation amongst the staff that affected the quality of service to the point of a bad experience. As for the food, the pizza tastes exactly like Pizza Hut but with a premium price tag (no sauce, just cheap cheese and low grade meat on bland crust) and the mozzerella sticks leave a film in your mouth with a bad aftertaste.  The beer is good though, I'll give them that."
Dessa S.,"San Francisco, CA",8,95,43,4.0,3/25/2010,"I actually really like the food here. It's like an upscale chili's. also it's nice to come here to eat after spending a couple hours shopping in the mall. Their food is really tasty. the only thing is that the root beer isn't all you can drink which sucks because it's YUMMY, I'm a big root beer fan!"
Hazel S.,"Dallas, TX",2,55,8,5.0,3/21/2010,"I've been here quite a few times and the food has always been fantastic.  I'm absolutely in love with their gourmet mac and cheese.  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but every time that we've been told its 45-50 minutes, we always get a table before 30 minutes has gone by.  Every server we've had has been polite, fast, funny and gotten everything right.  We've also done take out a few times and that's been great as well.  I've never had the beer here but I like how they have pepsi instead of coke :)"
Darius A.,"San Bruno, CA",29,620,34,3.0,6/6/2009,I went here a few months ago and I cannot see what all the hype is about. I can get a better pizza at Costco for 2 bucks. The service kind of sucks and the food is overrated.
Stephanie K.,"San Francisco, CA",29,53,23,2.0,7/21/2009,Sucks the soul from your body and stuffs it full of baked potatoes and pizookies.
John M.,"Pacifica, CA",0,7,,3.0,8/17/2010,"This place is good for your typical 'I want a step up from fast food but don't want to pay for a french restaurant' meal. The service is hit and miss, some days it's flat out slow and sloppy, others you have one person who is really attentive.  I like their pizza. More specifically, I like the great white. That's the only one that really stands out, the rest are kind of mundane as though they're the same as you can get anywhere else.  I like their pasta's a lot. I like the cajun pasta and get it extra spicy. The grilled chicken pasta (with the alfredo and broccoli) is really good too.  The beer is pretty good. I like the jeremiah red and the porter best. It's not brewed there which I was sad to find out, but it's still good.  Overall I like this place and have no real complaints. There's just nothing really special that stands out about it."
Donna A.,"Daly City, CA",26,50,4,3.0,2/19/2009,"this location is sort of a hit or miss kinda deal.  i had actually come during the dry run, when they first opened because my friends sister was one of the servers there (free food aint bad at all!) and the service was great. but, it seems like the service during more recent visits havent been up to par.  i mean, i know that it gets busy, but waiting 10 minutes for water is ridiculous. maybe it's just me, but when i ask for a water with lemon, i kind of expect a water with lemon? i get a glass of luke warm water with 2 ice cubes and no lemon (i even asked the server twice for a lemon, after she had dropped off my water.. and then she never never came back!) well, dehydration aside, the food is never a let down. the cobb salad is delish! i've also sampled a few of their pizza's, but my favorite is the great white. and who can say no to the pazookie?  so, bottom line: come for the food, not for the service..."
Sang K.,"San Francisco, CA",12,22,3,3.0,9/26/2007,"Maybe its the 'tard in me, but I laugh every time someone says ""BJ's""  So with that said, I chucked to myself as I entered through the doors of the newly remodeled Tanforan Shopping Center.  They did a good job fixing up the mall, although the hoodlums still gather during school time and even more so after school.  The restaurant was pretty clean although I don't care for the all stainless steel bathroom stalls and sinks.  Its just too industrial, hard to clean and reminds me of jail.  Jail is Bad!~ Being the beer aficionado that my toilet could vouch for, I had to try as many different beers as I could before heading back to work (my previous employer who didn't really know how I spent my 3 hour lunch breaks).  The Harvest Hefeweizen was clean and crisp and even more refreshing with extra lemon.  The Brewhouse Blonde was also light and tasty.  The Jeremiah Red was full flavored and had a very strong kick.  The Totonka Stout is fun to say, but difficult to drink.  Its pretty much a generic/wannabe Guinness, but I still was able to finish my pint.  Beer is Good!~   As for food, I tried the Lunch Special half turkey sandwich and salad.  Nothing special, just a plain turkey-lettuce-bread and plain garden salad.  On my next visit, I did try their Roast Beef Dip Sandwich which I did really like.  The horseradish they give you on the side is a good compliment and helps you drink more beer.  Again, beer is Good!~ I sat at the bar the times I've been there.  That cuts down on the time the beer has to travel from tap to table.  There are huge HD screens near the bar but don't ask them to change the channel, they don't know how.   The waitresses seem like the typical ditsy 'oh my god' girls who would work in a place called BJ's.  I know, I don't know them, I shouldn't judge them... let me drink more beer so I can justify my opinions more.  Lastly, beer is Great!~"
DON G.,"Eureka, CA",21,24,,1.0,3/25/2009,This particular one is WACK!.. my friends and I had to wait 2 hours for a seat!.. we could have called in to make reservations but they do not take phone reservations!
