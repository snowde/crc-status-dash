Willis W.,"San Francisco, CA",92,3,,5.0,4/22/2017,"We've been coming here for a few years. The food and service has been on an upswing in the past few months. Come for the food, stay for the service.  Recent menu changes have been for the better too. They have legitimately great prime rib. If you don't want the full dinner, you can get the prime rib sandwich. Definitely worth a try. They do sometimes sell out as the demand is growing.  Definitely worth a trip or a retry if you quit coming more than a few months ago."
RM M.,"San Francisco, CA",32,1,,1.0,8/10/2017,Horrible experience!! I USED to come here a lot. and yes I did say USED to. But my mom wanted to check this place out since she never been here.  First our appetizer was burnt to the extent that it has a bitter after taste. Told the server that this is not what I expected since I've ordered this in the past. He said Brussels sprouts are suppose to be bitter. I partially agree to it but a bitter after taste tho? Plus you can literally see burnt pieces?? Uhhmmm maybe not.  Second was our main course... it took 42mins for it to be served. I was staring at our server since The table next to us arrived after us but got their meal first mind you we had similar orders except for my deep dish ziti which all came out warm and not hot. Fries were missing. You can tell our dish has been sitting out for a while.  And to top this wonderful experience of we were still on our tables getting ready to leave he took the check book to check if we left a tip. Ive never been to restaurant that checks the bill before we leave.
Charles R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,1,2.0,6/11/2017,"I have been wanting to do a review of this restaurant for quite some time now and even though it's been over a year since we last visited this place, here are my 2 reviews of both times my girlfriend and I went. 1)  This was from our November 12, 2015 visit:  On this day, I met my new future girlfriend for a 2nd date.  Even though it was late at night, we felt unwelcomed there.  Believe me when I say that this restaurant needs new management. Service was extremely slow. Sometimes, the servers don't show up for about 10-15 minutes and you're just sitting there waiting.  Yet, we were sitting at a table that made us visible to everyone.  After we ordered, our food came out warm, not hot. We only ordered appetizers.  The tv's are great, but the atmosphere is very bland. I also noticed too that the wait staff tend to hang around with one another, ignoring customers.  I actually saw one employee texting.  There was no evidence of management around to delegate authority, so the staff do what they please. It would be a great place to go to, if there was a manager there that would be more strict with the staff.   2)  On March 12th, 2016, my girlfriend and I went there again (last time was our 2nd date in November, 2015 (see above)), and it was the same story as before. When we walked in I approached the hostess counter and gave my name and for 2 people.  She said it would be about a 15 minute wait.  Well, after waiting at least 45 minutes, I went up to the hostess counter and asked them how much longer for a table (there were 3 tables open).  When the hostess asked me who I was, I told her and for 2 people.  She apologized as she said to me that they thought I was a party of 4. The other hostess couldn't distinguish between 2 and 4. I made it clear that we were a party of 2 and she put 4. Next, after finally getting to the table, we ordered drinks and ordered the Fried Calamari, Fish & Chips and the Deep Dish Baked Ziti.  When we got our food, it was lousy. Really poor quality.  The fried calamari was cold (we returned it and the 2nd order wasn't better), the fish and chips were so, so greasy, you can actually see the oil they deep fried it in shine off the fish and fries. And you can actually see the oil drip off into the wax paper. The Deep Dish Baked Ziti wasn't any better. I spoke with the Manager, and he agreed to remove the Calamari and I also told him about our past experience.  Now this manager was from Texas.  Why would you bring in a manager from Texas.  Was this location so bad that they had to bring him in?  Well, even with him there, it still was the same.  The only good thing was our waitress. She was very nice, professional and polite.   Overall, after our past and present experiences, I give that restaurant a Grade Rating D-.  The only reason as to why it is not a Grade rating F (Failure) was because of the drinks and the waitress.  As of today, we have not been back to that restaurant and I don't feel that we will be going back there anytime soon.  It's just not worth it.  I'm sorry, but that restaurant needs a major overhaul."
Sarah P.,"Petaluma, CA",0,6,1,1.0,6/21/2017,"Hour to hour 1/2 wait : after about 40 min. I went to the restroom .....not a single stall had tp and was filthy!  I mentioned to tonight's bartender., he laughed and said well did you just use your hand?  Whhha?  Ok maybe he was trying to be funny, but no apologies .. whatever our party of four decided to go someplace else. Better get your bathroom checks in order bjs"
Gustavo B.,"Fremont, CA",0,10,,4.0,5/3/2017,Been coming here for a while. The service has gotten better back and fourth. We were sat in the a booth today and waited for service. No one came for about 10-15 minutes so we waived the manager  Rustie down. Rustie ended up taking our order and getting everything for the us. Food came out quicker than usual and dessert came out quick. he offered us a pizzokie when we downloaded the app. Which we took of course. LOVE IT!!!
Serena  E.,"Stockton, CA",3,12,1,1.0,7/22/2017,Terrible service. Food was not fresh at all and I don't think I will be coming back to this specific location.
Sally A.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/23/2017,"I ordered the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl before and I was disappointed - too much tomatoes and maybe lemon juice that made it sour. The other veggie, I.e., spinach was cooked too much. I didn't see any red onions. Same thing happened to Shrimp and Asparagus Penne - too sour also. In fact, I was told not to pay for my dinner. Eugene approached me and offered to order another dish, but I just said ""I have to go."" Another disappointment was the Parmesan Crusted chicken. It was too salty because of too much Parmesan; the broccoli wasn't steamed and the size of the chicken was smaller than the ones ordered to eat in. I wasn't able to comment on these dishes before because I didn't have time and I felt disappointed. I have been a BJ customer for a long time. I wonder what happened. I used to live across Tanforan mall."
Lisa C.,"San Francisco, CA",17,8,2,3.0,4/6/2017,"I give the restaurant a 3 stars but the manager Efren a 5 stars.  Even though the restaurant is overcrowded and hectic, Efren made it all better.  He was accommodating and easy to talk to.  Even with screaming customers, he was able to handle the situation calmly. He made the whole dining situation a good experience."
Nikki Y.,"San Francisco, CA",12,1,,1.0,8/14/2017,"If I could I wouldn't give this restaurant a star at all... they are ridiculously slow and lie about waiting times with both  take out and dinning in. We waited almost an hour for 3 pazookies which we were told were only going to be 20mins, only to be given an attitude when given our order missing a pazookie and ice cream. I'm not one to make an issue at restaurants because I am understanding and try to avoid confrontation but this is something else. We had to return because the 2 we received at first were half ass and burnt. There were a few helpful workers that made a genuine effort including the manager but there were others that gave attitude and tried to give excuses. Overall I'd never return here, not worth the time or headache."
Tanya B.,"Millbrae, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/13/2017,"Took way too long! Mediocre food and service. To top it off, there was a piece of chicken in my dessert!"
Christine O.,"Burbank, CA",41,16,7,1.0,11/20/2016,"I don't know what happened to this place :(  I now remember why I stopped going here .   Even. G family members was like , why'd you go there ?? You know the service is  bad now there. And I agree ,The service is just super bad now. Besides the wait time where I was willing to wait anyways before because of the service and good food it's just not worth it now.  The jambalaya is so disappointing .it's just full of green bell peppers that's it.  The servers .. oh my I don't know they just look so unhappy to be there and it just reflects cause they don't care ...  they don't care about the costumers BJs , seriously good thing you guys got the franchise name  but oh my . Your loyal costumers are slowly going bye bye ."
Chris W.,"San Jose, CA",1,52,13,2.0,10/17/2017,"Food is ok if you can get by the poor service. We were seated promptly but then waited at least 15 minutes before any waiter came by. He took our order of drinks, brought the drinks but then realized there was no sweetener or silverware available. So as I am dying of thirst, we waited and waited some more to at least get someone's attention to ask for sweetener. finally sweetener arrived. Then we waited for our salad. Oh wait, we don't have any silverware yet. Again as waiter zombie after waiter zombie passed us by refusing to acknowledge our presence we finally found someone to help. Of course the waiter who took our order who said ""I'll be serving you tonight"" never brought our food; it was always someone else who didn't know what was ordered or who ordered it. Finally the main course arrived (45 min later) delivered by someone else and it was wrong, so again trying to get our server to it knowledge your presence was impossible. This dinner took about 2 hours way too long. At the end, oh look, pay on the app and get a free Pizookie! Ok paid. Oh sorry sir that will take ANOTHER 30 minutes. WTF! They owe me a Pizookie! Which I will probable never get."
Jennifer Y.,"Alameda, CA",81,50,3,4.0,3/30/2017,"I'm really never a fan of chains such as Cheesecake Factory, Elephant Bar, Red Lobster, etc. But BJ's is my exception! First off- they have HH until 7, where I can get their jalapeño margarita for less than $7. Score. Their bar bites are good as well. The root beer glazed wings are tasty af and of course- how can you say no to their pazookis? But yeah, their margaritas are what makes me want to go back."
Veronica P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/2/2016,Patio service sucks ass waited 2 hours to get some fish tacos and Spinach. Fuck this place
Leticia C.,"Millbrae, CA",11,2,,2.0,5/17/2017,"Our waiter was great! Took our order promptly and very polite. Food was good. Had a Cesar salad and pizza. It was the seating that was not cool!  Checked in and told it would be a 10-minute wait. Mind you, there were plenty of 2- seat tables available. During our wait another couple checked in. While we waited another couple walked in and before they could check in they were asked if they were 2, which they confirmed and they were escorted to a table by the manager. The other couple called it discrimination. Didn't cross my mind until I realized the couple they sat without checking in and the 4 of us that were still waiting. FYI, this is not the first time this has happened at this particular restaurant. Sad and disgusted with BJ's in San Bruno!!!!!!!!"
Abby C.,"San Francisco, CA",35,183,95,1.0,5/1/2017,"This BJ's has horrible service and staff.  Starting with the host station. The quality of food is also horrible.  Compared to the other BJ locations this one has probably been the worse location I have visited. I wanted to give it two stars and I've visited this location a few times, especially during football games and HH prices. But each time I went they always messed up on our orders, overcharged us and added plates to our bill. Also, many times our calamari would come out burnt and the portion would be less and less every time.  I would understand if the calamari was on the HH menu then yes, smaller HH portion but it wasn't.  All servers are pretty rude and careless to help other tables and even there own.  Takes awhile to flag your own server down too, and when you do expect to wait another 30-25mins for water, peppers and new silverware. ALWAYS check your silverware, there never cleaned and have food on them still, yuk.  If the Oreo Pizookie wasn't so yummy, I probably wouldn't have returned."
Rj M.,"Metro Manila, Philippines",32,18,2,5.0,3/20/2017,"Me and my friends came here for PIZOOKIE, and it met my expectations! A warm dessert topped with my favorite vanilla ice cream. Our server was patient with me and my friends since we barely know what flavor to order, and since we want to hit 3 birds in one stone, our server offered us the pizookie trio which comes in three different flavors. They have bar area and a porch/patio with fire place too! We'll definitely come back!"
Meagan C.,"Brandon, FL",52,4,,1.0,11/13/2016,"This app does not let me give negative stars.  My friend, my girlfriend, and I are repeat customers at this BJs for awhile. And now their service is just horrible. We got seating at 5 pm. And it is now 6:26pm and we are still waiting on half our food.  All of our meals first came out really burnt 20 minutes ago so we sent it back. And now we are still waiting for our food to come back out. If you want really good food and better service. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT COME TO THIS BJS in San Bruno"
Rich K.,"Mountain View, CA",34,42,23,1.0,7/9/2017,"Got there around 10pm sat.  But even though its late slippery floors and dirty bathrooms are no excuse(my sis said overflowed toilets poorly cleaned up, hard not to step in urine in men's restroom). Cupertino was a lot cleaner"
Susan M.,"Burlingame, CA",206,4,1,5.0,4/11/2017,"We've been coming to this location for a long time. And just this past year we have seen significant improvements to food, customer service and leadership! Mauricio stands out as a solid manager with exceptional leadership values and making this a star location!"
