Riza I.,"Pacifica, CA",0,11,,3.0,7/26/2012,"I went to BJs yesterday for my brother's birthday. I thought the food was pretty good however, the wait was longer than what they had expected and I felt like we were waiting a long time to get our food as well as any refill we needed on drinks. To me, customer service is of big importance and I thought their customer service was just okay. I was also surprised to find out that we had to wait about 45 minutes for baby back ribs to be ready because they ran out. I'm just thinking if you know that there if that is one of your best selling dishes, you should be able to compensate for this. My brother had to change his order since he didn't want to wait but he should have just ordered the baby back ribs anyways since the wait for the rest of the food was about that long too."
Scott C.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/14/2014,"I think this is the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. It was over 30 minutes before I had a drink in front of me. After the food was served we had to ask for silverware and plates after the food was served. We had to go to the bar to order the second round of drinks. A third round of drinks was never offered at the table. While watching college basketball the tv spontaneously changed to another channel. At one point 7 of 10 TVs showed the Minnesota vs Michigan hockey game, none were playing the local Sharks game. The food came to the table and then turned around because they didn't have a table stand for the pizza. The second round of chips and salsa we asked for never arrived. I would have liked a third drink and it was never even offered. My water was never refilled. I will not ever return to this location and can't imagine I would ever trust another BJ's. Next time I'll go to Applebee's or something, and I can't eat anything on that menu."
Chris B.,"Burlingame, CA",418,319,75,3.0,8/19/2009,"Great beers on tap here... Food is mediocre, I consider it to be just like fast food except its not fast at all. Service is even slower than the food. Anytime I come here though I have at least a nibble of an avocado roll and wash it down with a raging rhino red."
Duelcitizen B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,3,,1.0,5/7/2013,"I NEVER REALLY WRITE REVIEWS UNLESS IT'S NEEDED... I am very disappointed in this location! I was out celebrating with a friend yesterday May 6 around 6pm. I ordered an drink with alcohol and my waiter said he needed to take my driver's license to his manager to double check it because it's an out of state license. He brings my drivers license back to me bent completely in half! I ask him what happened and he said he didn't know the process but, that's how the manager checks the driver's licenses. He bends them in half. I am from out of state in school here. I will not be back home until this semester ends! What if he broke it. It would not be easy to acquire a new one being here in California. This business needs a machine or another way. I got no apology and I was treated as if it was nothing and no thought. I am very displeased about this service. I will take my complaint up the chain of command. Now I have a bent up card that will now not last nearly as long as it should."
Kimberly S.,"San Francisco, CA",351,158,44,4.0,2/15/2009,"I think it helps that their Strawberry Lemonade has complimentary refills. But their food is pretty damn awesome. Big portions for a girl my size. But just perfect for an average man. My friends and I come here just to hang and eat. Pizzas...entrees...PIZOOKIE. But make sure you don't eat too much, so you have room for that pizookie. Their food is pretty damn filling, in general. So you'd need to make room for a cookie measuring about 5 inches in diameter with two scoops of ice cream...my mouth is watering just thinking of it."
Annette C.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/26/2012,The worst. I had suggested it because the BJs in Newark is ok but the service was S.L.O.W! It was clear when the food came that at least MY food had been ready of a LOOOOONG time and had sat under a heat lamp. YUCK. Chicken tacos had become chicken jerky shoe leather tacos. I was embarrassed. We were on the way to airport or I would have sent everything back and gone somewhere else. Avoid it.
Chris C.,"Redwood Shores, CA",53,122,64,3.0,9/15/2007,"BJ's is a chain, it is good decent pub fair. the pizzas have stewed tomatoes on them, it's their thing. I don't really like that much, but you know, it's okay food and I will keep coming back for more.  on the plus side, the smiley face fries and pazookie are fun to eat. yes but being a beer guy, I come for the beer. their heff is decent, most of the brews are tasty.. it varies with each batch like small brews will. i will let you in on a secret. MIX THEM! not on the menu... but describe it and they will do it. Black and Brown - PM porter and Nutty Brewnette Jeremiah Blonde - Brewhouse Blonde and Jeremiah Red yay! if you don't really like the food, just sit at the bar, eat appetizers and drink up. They have TV's all over so if you like sports thats great. I am not really into watching pompous millionaires play a half-ass game of whatever * ..but to each his own.. most the BJs have DirecTV so they play Fuel, Speed, and the more interesting sports.. Each BJ's has a different atmosphere, if you don't like San Bruno, try Foster City or one of the ones that actually brews the beer on site. good for groups if you pick one that has a separate party/meeting room. Not all of them do!"
Kiki W.,"Brisbane, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/2/2010,"Always a good place to go, with friends or alone. Can be crowded, so we try to come during happy hour. Nothing beats their Berry Cider and Avocado Egg Rolls, but everything else I ever had there was good too."
Larry W.,"San Francisco, CA",30,62,6,4.0,10/18/2009,"We went to BJ's in order to watch a football game that our cable was not showing.  We got exactly what we wanted: plenty of table space (for the early game), good service, good beer and some snack food.  Their food is not gourmet but you know that going in.  It is in a mall, what do you want?  If you are on a diet, this is not your place.  There is no organic anything and their ""diet"" menu is nothing to brag about, like a wedge of iceberg lettuce with some dressing.  We knew all this so we were not disappointed.  Their beer is always good.  Our server (Matt) was great & the orders came quickly.  They made every attempt to keep the table clear and the kids happy.  Too bad my NY Giants lost!  Thanks BJ's for a good morning of football."
Angelina M.,"Allen, TX",176,258,43,4.0,1/25/2009,Went in today with the boyfriend and monster. I had the California chicken sanwich. Very tasty. I wished there had been some lettuce on it but o well. 5 starts b/c my son was at ease enjoyed his food and did not scream or throw anything. 1 star off b/c the last 3 times I had been in there was a hair in my cesaer salad. Why I feel the need to come back after 3 hairs...oatmeal raisen pizookie.
K C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,,2.0,6/7/2012,"Always a long wait to be seated, the service is never great. The food is ... ok? ... =/  Never a first choice but it's convenient."
tina b.,"San Bruno, CA",0,12,,1.0,5/31/2012,"Will not return; once again, last evening  waited over 90 minutes for a table, only to leave without eating.  Too long of a wait; impossible to get into the bar and sit.  When we decided we had enough, we gave up and handed the pager back to the reservation desk girls.  They never apologized for the wait; nor asked us to stay; it was just 2 less patrons that they would have to deal with.  Never again, will we go back there.  It does not matter if it is 1:00 PM in the afternoon or 8:30 PM at night.  They could of doubled the space of this restaurant, and it still wouldn't of been enough to accomodate.  This was a total BJ alright."
Vicky T.,"San Francisco, CA",3,12,,3.0,1/26/2010,"BJ's favorite is my all-time favorite here. I don't really come here for anything else because everything else is so greasy! Service is good, but sometimes you have to wait a while before your waiter finally gets to you."
Champ F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,36,,3.0,3/21/2010,"Food was good.  Service was somewhat OK, but a little on the pricey side."
Sydney S.,"San Bruno, CA",3,28,,3.0,7/22/2006,"BJ's is one of those coporate franchises that markets the image of a micro-brewery to sell drinks and food to the 20-40 something diners.  A representative customer is looking for an informal sports-bar like setting to watch the game on tvs while you have a drink or two with your friends. Ever eat anything at sports bars?  Yes, the menu has items like onion flowers, avocado rolls, and nachos to start, salads, soups, so-called ""gourmet specialty"" pizzas and other staple basic entrees like pasta and meat loaf.  It's incredibly uninspring and the prices are a little on the pricey side, albeit the fact that the portions are BIG.   The service is fairly good, except that the busy waitress took the wrong order twice in a row and tried to force us to eat whatever she assumed that we ordered.  Yes, I am a stupid customer who doesn't know what I ordered a moment before, duh! The food is mediocre and with attentive but misguided service, I would rather go and eat a slice of Costco pizza than eat here again."
stella m.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,6,,3.0,9/1/2007,8/23/2007 I always like coming to this place. The first place we went  to right after landing at SFO.  I like their avocado egg rolls. My kids like it too.  The only thing that bothers me is that the usual wait for dinner would be about 50 minutes!!!! The service is good.  I am sorry to hear that the someone from BJs would steal a customer's credit card. YIKES!
Mochi M.,"San Jose, CA",245,81,,3.0,7/24/2011,"blah. everything was too slow. i didnt get my drink til late because our waitress assumed that sum1 brought it out. I dont mind much because it wasnt THAT long. food tasted good, service was alright. pizookie made me fat. hahaha good place to chill though. HELLA busy but the noise level was good. i was able to hear my friend . hahaha so yea, i'll come back."
Dan L.,"Eden Prairie, MN",0,63,,3.0,2/28/2012,"Frustrating restaurant.  Sometimes the service is good and other times, just terrible.  The food is usually good, or at least what comes out is what was ordered, but occasionally,  the food is just not good.  Their clam chowder is usually great.  They have some great prices on lunch items.  I work nearby and come fairly often, so I guess there has to be some misses when you come here a lot, but when this place misses, it seems to miss by a lot.  But I will return."
Diane S.,"Houston, TX",306,948,153,3.0,5/27/2011,"i like their small plates so cute and tasty. me and my bestie like the tomatoes and mozzarella salad. at $2.99 Happy hour here sucks only $2 off and only pizzas are discounted i think $5 not appetizers lame. Loaded baked potato chicken Alfredo is good.  so is their fettucini Alfredo. In the mall, outside seating too. Pazzokies make everyone go crazy over here its a fat cookie the size of a pizza with tons of ice cream scoops go here for a birthday and buy your friends a pazzoki"
Maulie D.,"San Francisco, CA",109,206,1,3.0,9/5/2008,"BJ's serves up some great American food.  Pizza, Pasta, Salads, Burgers, and full American dinners make up this solid menu that will definitely please a picky crowd.  It's the deep dish, comfort food version of CPK."
