Kevin C.,"Millbrae, CA",94,68,,3.0,7/21/2008,"Well, This place is always a default place for me to go when theres nothing really better to do but it does have a lot of good points. Since its a Brewery they only carry their own brand of beer. If ya wanna get a buzz going on try the Jerimiah Red have like two or three of thoes and whew your are feeling pretty good. I'm stuck on the crispy chicken sandwichw/ a side of ranch for the fries. I normally get the Blonde or Heff brew.....mmmmm delicious !  Staff for the most part is friendly, except for the weekends they tend to get a little rude.  Always a cool place for friends. Sports always on, and beer always fresh, and a good time comes for about $19.00-$35.00."
Joey J.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/12/2012,"Food was ok.  Service well...  The problem I had was when we finished our soups, nobody got our soup bowls from our table.  Two of us ordered Tortilla soup and you know how big those soup bowls are.  The main dish was served but the soup bowls were not taken away.  When I asked our server to remove the empty plates he sure didn't appreciate my request."
Suelene C.,"Irvine, CA",368,76,11,4.0,10/17/2010,"LOVE BJ's! Happy hour is great too! PAZOOKIES!!!! all i can say is YUM! They are BOMB! And they have great beer as well. Their pizzas are really good too especially their deep-dish ones. Service is usually pretty good. The atmosphere is nice too, dimly lit, with usually 4-5 Big LCD TV monitors with the games on and an open bar area. The wait however can be a long one. So come early. The place is loud, not a really listener-friendly area if you're trying to REALLY get to know somene. Overall is a great place and is fun to be in too."
Tiffanie L.,"Daly City, CA",1,22,,4.0,4/12/2010,"It's always seem to be a wait when dining at this restaurant. This place sure has great food. We order artichoke dip,  hot wings and also pulled pork bbq burger. It sure took them quite a bit of time to make. I guess they were a bit busy or short handed. Service is not too bad, it's hard to even the drink refilled. I also try their root beer float- no complaint there. Good price and good food."
Ali F.,"Millbrae, CA",2,20,,4.0,3/24/2010,"The food is average (what do you really expect from a chain?), but BJ's is a great place for groups as the menu is extensive.  Sure to have something for everyone. Also, on nice days it is fun to sit outside and taste a bunch of different beers."
T L.,"San Jose, CA",10,38,9,1.0,2/2/2011,Thank you for making my gfs most horrible. Serving cold food and passing it off as new is bad business. No one wants someone else go-back. Shame shame on you BJs
charlotte s.,"Stavanger, Norway",92,1233,31,3.0,4/19/2009,"were in the area and didn't feel like eating at the food court so came here... had to wait a while for a table.  i think it was friday afternoon so there were some company group luncheons here and there in the dining room... service was decent to minimal...  had some pasta dish, which was ok....  if i had a choice between going to this chain or a cheesecake factory, i'd probably chose cheesecake factory...."
Chihiro O.,"San Francisco, CA",6,22,,3.0,2/6/2007,"I like there because.. i like their good happy hours, two times a day. i like their friedly service. i like their beer (one kind) i don't like there because.. we have to wait so long to get seated, some waiters/bartenders are rude.. well, however, why are we keep going there like once a week? BJ is easy place to go, i mean, not too pricy not fancy,  just go there to watch basketball or to  have fun time with your friends."
Jen N.,"Pacifica, CA",43,85,,5.0,5/12/2007,"I love eating at BJs!  Their Santa Fe Salad and Artichoke & Spinach pizza is the best!  And I highly recommend the Nutty Brunette & Jeremiah Red beers.  And make sure you save room for the Pizookie!! The only drawback is that they don't accept reservations, which sucks, especially on a weekend night because you might have to wait an hour and a half!"
Nicole S.,"San Bruno, CA",0,15,,4.0,12/1/2007,"I've been to BJ's three times, and each time it was a great experience. My best friend and I went on a Friday night and only had to wait about 25 minutes for a table (I was expecting upwards of 40). Another time I went with my Mom and brother. Again, about a 20 minute wait on a Friday night. We were given a device that would vibrate and beep when our table was ready. Family and I wandered into Barnes and Noble and shopped around for a while- and it went off in there! I'm very happy I can wander out of the restaurant without worrying if I'll lose my table or not. The food is always good. I've gotten pizza and sandwhiches, both of which have exceeded my standards. And their pazookie was amazing :-)! The waiters and waitresses and really nice and attentive.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be really noisy in there. When my family and I went we had to yell over the sound."
Allie M.,"Northridge, CA",149,21,1,5.0,6/3/2009,"5 stars for the service. The waiter misheard my colleague's order, apologized, had the manager apologize, offered soup until her order was ready, brought out her dish 4 minutes later, and took all of her purchases off the bill. Everyone at the table left happy. (plus the food was good! i recommend anything that is served with french fries!)"
Mimi S.,"Colma, CA",35,171,86,4.0,4/27/2009,"Food was great and inexpensive.  Love the vibe there, but our waiter (forgot homeboy's name), tapped me and asked what I would like to drink.  Maybe it was an accident, but I thought that was kinda weird.  N e ways, the service was great.  I barely ate my meal bc of the large pizza and appetizer we ordered mmm mmmm mmmm so YUMMY.  Minus one star bc the table we got was pretty small.  There were 4 men and 3 woman in our party.  And ladies we know how men like to sit, with their legs wide open and elbows stretched out WTF? yea so not enough table space for the food and the men to spread their legs and elbows.  Overall BJ I think is better than TGIF."
Krissel A.,"Pacifica, CA",97,52,4,3.0,7/9/2009,"This place is alright. I come here with my friends when we all want dinner together. We normally get a pizza & a pizookie. Good stuff. The service sucks. The wait sucks even more. The wait really depends on what time you go. But if you have your buzzer thing, be careful when you walk around Tanfo. It might lose signal (Treat it like a ghetto cell phone. You can't go far without losing signal.) & you'll end up waiting another (insert wait period here) minutes/hour(s). Don't be too frustrated at the end when your server doesn't come back with the check for awhile. Enjoy your time chatting with your buds. Other than that, everything's alright."
Brian R.,"San Francisco, CA",14,86,29,3.0,5/25/2011,"ok food, good price, lunch deal is pretty good,  got the clam chowder was so so, garden salad could have been better, peachberry tea tasted like medicine, overall 3 stars is being nice, probably closer to 2 and a half"
Bill D.,"San Bruno, CA",0,76,6,2.0,9/16/2011,"I dined at the bar for years, and enjoyed an exceptional staff.  The food was fair,  and the beer was good.  I was always shocked when I would go for table service, because it was consistently bad.  Then...the bar staff changed and deteriorated.  Management is clueless!  I don't go there anymore."
Scarlett C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,3,5.0,3/1/2010,"BJ's is always a safe bet. They have great food and drinks and I come here often since there is so much variety I don't get sick of it. The only complaint I have is that it's always so crowded that I end up waiting 45 minutes to get seated....but  it's honestly worth it since there isn't a whole lot of options around this area for good food and beer. I would LOVE if another BJ's opened up nearby in Millbrae, Burlingame or South City just so the customers could be more spread out and I wouldn't have to wait 45 minutes for a table."
Tahoe N.,"South San Francisco, CA",76,9,2,4.0,4/4/2010,"I went back recently, and tried a Belgian beer on their list. One word, ""Wow!"" was my description of the beer. I don't remember which one I got, but it was 12% and very tasty! Malty, spicy, hoppy, everything you love in a Belgian beer/ ale."
Sonlay V.,"Southern California, CA",221,917,283,4.0,6/7/2009,"I was so surprised when I found out they brew their own brewery. I tried a Blonde and damn it was good. I liked the environment because it was big and had man TVs. I did feel like it was the same layout as an Aber and Fitch or a Holister store, but it was nice. Food wasn't bad and I would definitely come back for another Blonde."
Lady O.,"San Diego, CA",8,66,,1.0,11/30/2008,"why is it when it comes to BJ, their service have never surprise me to resonate ALL of BJ's like in Cupertino and San Bruno. service is horrible as usual with their cheapness to employ more staff but i am a sucker for their thin crust appy pizza and avocado rolls."
Annie D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",353,740,191,4.0,2/18/2009,"This normally isn't the first place I would choose to come eat at, but this place is pretty decent. I always go to the bar seating area, most of the time you'll have to hunt for a seat. Service has it's ups and downs, sometimes they're on it and sometimes they forget about you. I'm a fan of their deep dish pizzas. I always ask for extra toppings and there's never a charge and it does come out with extra toppings! Their huge stuffed potatoes are pretty good. Spinach dip and fresh chips is a great appetizer.  Their fish tacos are surprising very tasty. Their beer is good, I'm a dark beer drinker so I always get their Tatonka stout. And of course for dessert, the famous pizookie never fails, warm chocolate cookie or white chocolate with melting ice cream on top, can't go wrong with that simple dessert or entree for some.."
