Sarah D.,"Seattle, WA",92,165,334,3.0,12/30/2008,On the prawl for new brews to try...from their website this place looks totally corporate. Like the Chilis of brewhouses. Even Pyrimid looks/is better. Before I totally slam them I must go and submit an update. But based on principal and the fact that my 3 stars wont hurt their score much I will end it at that.
Customer L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,,4.0,1/27/2012,"Even though they were super busy on Sunday, the service and food was good.  However,  waitresses speak so FAST.  Sometimes, hard to catch it up."
Jasper N.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/26/2012,went here for a friends birthday party. overall good food and our waiter was chill. the burgers and sandwiches are huge! i got a pulled pork and it was amazing.
Tracy T.,"San Francisco, CA",736,673,421,3.0,7/10/2008,"This restaurant NEVER fails to make me wait at least half an hour or more for a table no matter how large or small my party is. Whether it be  blossom hill, cupertino, los angeles, sacramento or this location, i've been to all, i've had to wait...somehow it's always a spur of a moment decision to go to BJs for dinner (esp. the ones in the mall: oakridge and tanforan), so I ALWAYS end up with a wait time for my tables. I even had to wait for the opening bar seating here when I went with my BF one night. Other than that, the service is slow. It can vary sometimes and the wait time can be interchanged, removed, added, whatever. But it usually goes like this: wait time for order, waiter disappears, wait time for food,  can't find waiter to request for something, wait time for whatever requested, wait time for check. Not a very intelligent choice when you are pressed for time for a quick dinner, but good for catching up with friends. Favs:  -Avocado eggrolls. I hate avocados, but this is good when dipped in the sweet tamarind sauce that comes with it to mask the avocado taste.  -BJ's favorite pizza/BBQ Chicken: Deep dish is my favorite, love the fluffy thick crust. BJ's fav is like a combination pizza with lots of meat and veggies. The BBQ chicken is made with bbq sauce and it tastes a little sweet and tangy.  -Stuffed potatoes: These are ginormous! It's really filling, but I'm not a baked potatoes kind of girl. A spoonful and I will be good without it for the rest of the night.  - Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta: My favorite dish of all time here! Not too rich or creamy. Just the right amount of light sauce, tons of shrimp and tomatoes. It's mouth watering just looking at it! -Bj's famous Pizookie: Can't forgot to top off your dinner with this hot baby. Oatmeal raisin, please! A warm cookie with ice cream on top. What a perfect way to end a night of being a heffer!"
Drew k.,"San Diego, CA",0,41,3,3.0,7/28/2011,"Food is pretty good but way overpriced. Long waits for a table or drink during weekends. Drinks are only reasonable during happy hour. Don't go here if you are on a budget. Wait staff are average but I found many of the female hostsses to be very immature and snotty. Most of the time I go, I get attitude or unfriendliness when putting my name in for a table."
Joelle L.,"San Jose, CA",147,68,11,2.0,9/27/2008,"I came here last night with my boyfriend, my friend & a bunch of his friends just to hang out. God, they need to turn up the heaters outside because SSF is freezing! Anyway, we were all just hanging out outside & talking. Ended up getting a few drinks because wasn't feeling beer at all at the moment. This is the first time I got mixed drinks from BJ's & I was disappointed. My boyfriend first got me an adios & it tasted so watered down. Then i ordered a Tokyo Tea. Tasted way too syrupy. I just finished it because I didn't wanna waste my boyfriend's money on it. At least my friend's watermelon margarita was good. I think I'd only go here to eat & drink their beer, not for their mixed drinks."
Chris N.,"Pacifica, CA",17,7,,4.0,7/18/2011,Best named restaurant in san bruno. Food is pretty good too.
Ana A.,"Concord, CA",2,19,,4.0,2/4/2008,I mainly come here to meet up with my girls. We sit at the same table and have drinks. Sometimes grab a meal. Every time we do come there is a wait.  We usually leave and come back or sit at the bar. They also have outside seating with outdoor heaters.  meals are big.. AGAIN we mostly come for the drinks and to talk where its not quiet. We are loud so it suits us.
Daisy S.,"Mililani, HI",53,490,196,3.0,3/1/2009,The athmosphere is good... the beer is good... but the food is average for me. Came here because it is one of the nearest places to eat outside the jacked up prices of airport food.
Engin E.,"San Carlos, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/24/2012,"OK food, horrible service, there are hundreds of servers around and they are all lost cases, our dinner was about to finish finally we got our drinks, do not blame the servers blame the management, we did not go there with high expectations but I wasn't expecting this very bad service...very disappointing, sad...."
Mike C.,"San Bruno, CA",246,243,2,1.0,5/15/2010,"wait time for a table is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! the service is friendly, but inconsistent at best, depending who you get and how crowded the restaurant is overall, which means it's usually below average. prices are more expensive than your average chain restaurant, but they do offer more variety off their menu. love the decor (including all the TVs and lengthy bar), location at Tanforan Mall and pretty noisy. the food... well, it's rich, heavy and over-seasoned. however, they do give big portions... once your food ACTUALLY arrives. consequently, i haven't been there in quite some time. i recommend just going across the street to Red Robin."
mitchell l.,"San Francisco, CA",79,76,44,3.0,1/9/2009,"Nice spot to watch game's with friends. Great beers on tap and lots of choices on the grub. Foods nothing special but decent I do like the deep dish pizza, Cobb salad, and jambalaya. Place gets packed there but you may be able to find some bar tables if you are lucky and not have to wait for the vibrating pager haha. Service has always been great and the prices are very reasonable."
Stephanie D.,"Millbrae, CA",1,54,4,3.0,7/18/2009,"The food is typical of what you would expect in any run of the mill restaurant.  The service is usually pretty good.  I would recommend it and I would even give it 4 stars, expect I think it's a little pricey.  Take about $3-$5 off each entree price, and I think the place would be great and I would go a lot more often.  Extensive drink menu is also a plus (but again, they come with a hefty price tag)."
Jennifer D.,"Alameda, CA",506,1721,81,3.0,3/1/2007,"I can never say the name of this place with a straight face.  Because I have the maturity level of a 10 year old.  But seriously, the fun is almost endless - ""How do you feel about BJs for dinner?"" ""Anyone in the mood for BJs?"" etc.  My mother does not really appreciate this, and as that's who I'm usually dining with when I go to BJs, well, anyway, I think it's funny. The food is what you'd expect.  I like it better than some other chains.  I like the cute names for the beer.  The pizza is decent.  There are a lot of TVs.  They have garage doors separating the space, and someday in a beer induced mischief session I am sure I will try to close them.  I almost always slip and kill myself when walking across the hardwood floor (what do they clean that shit with, Pledge? *cough Andrea O. cough *).  There are pictures of spunky half naked boys in the bathroom and it smells orangey in there.  It's in a mall.  You don't really need a review to know what you're going to get here.  The pizookie is a bit quirky and I just had sliders there (yay!) so they're slightly different than TGIChiliRobin's."
Neil N.,"Irvine, CA",83,248,36,3.0,12/22/2008,"I came here to get some food and watch the game with the guys. Unless you're sitting at the bar, the TVs aren't that helpful. They have corner TVs but they must be only 22-24 inches, and with no sound. So really, you're just eating but occasionally looking at the TV. For a place to eat while watching the game intently, go elsewhere. As for the food, it is good. We had the wings for starters and I had the BBQ chicken sandwich while my friends had the ribs and chicken fried steak. FYI, these are big portions. Luckily, I had some good brew to wash it down. Didn't realize it, but they serve pumpkin as their seasonal. I'll have to come back, as the last time I had great pumpkin beer was in Seattle.  Service was a lil slower, but I suspect it was because it was a Saturday nite and there was a huge xmas shopping crowd. Still took over 10 minutes for dessert, which was the brownie by the way. Excellent brownie, but way too much whipped cream. Reminds me of the ice cream sundae Bobby on the Brady Bunch when he was competing in the ice cream eating contest! LOL Overall, probably will come back, as it's better than food court food, but will stay with 21st Amendment or Knuckles to watch the game."
Elle C.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,47,5,1.0,3/5/2008,"this place is the epitome of watered-down, pasty white, blubbery, american ""culture"". i mean, if you couldn't guess already by these hints: 1. it's a ""brewery"" in a ""mall"" (does tanforan really qualify as a mall?). there is a holding tank for fermenting beer stuffs, not hooked up to anything, in front of the restaurant. ""ooh! it's a brewery! they have one of those brewery tank thingies!"" 2. it's in san bruno. san bruno is business parks and the golden gate national cemetery - that's it. i wanted to sit and bask in the sun on that patio! that's why i did not turn around when i realized i had just stepped foot in nascar haven. and after the blase hostess said it would be a ten minute wait for a table (there was like nobody in the place) and that ""she thought"" there was a server outside so i could sit out there with no wait. it took ten minutes for the server to come out. i got the chopped italian salad with no salami (don't come here if you're a conscious eater, ie: care about organics, not eating animal products). it comes, it's HUGE...which supports my first paragraph. way too huge. nobody can eat that much iceberg lettuce, mealy tomatoes, canned black olives, artichoke hearts, and wishbone italian dressing. the cheese on it was those teeny-tiny squares of mozzarella, the kind that really cheap pizzerias use.  i get my bill and it's $13; for an empty salad and an iced tea. watch though, i'll be back...that patio will lure me in again! it's the only sunny patio i can find in san bruno. next time i'll just drink beer and go back to work at least blurry to the fact that i had just been violated by a greasy man named bj who voted for bush both times!"
S F.,"South San Francisco, CA",8,194,81,1.0,8/18/2010,"Since my last review ,you would of think that they will get better at this .Sorry to say my friends that nope it's not.In 3 years since my last review,I went back with my brother and we got smarter this time by seated at the bar.Food is ok still and same with their drinks but I am so sorry to say that their service move in a pace of melting glacier.Sad but true.Was hoping that things will change but this wishful thinking will have to end here and now."
Andi T.,"San Francisco, CA",412,1080,327,3.0,12/10/2006,"The service was friendly, the beer (red) was decent, and the food was about what you'd expect from a place like this.  I give them an extra star for showing a women's basketball game on one of the bazillion TV sets and for having a few vegetarian options on the menu.  It's better mall food than the Olive Garden, but how hard is that?"
Carlo S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,29,1,3.0,8/12/2008,"ok food, but the servers are mia for the most part.  I had to wait about 15 mins to flag down a waitress because they did fly-by's and pretend to not look in my direction."
Donna H.,"San Francisco, CA",573,437,131,3.0,5/10/2007,"i go to bj's for the spinach artichoke dip, berry cider, and yummy pizookies..  the cider is way too carbonated.. ugh.. i burp all the time, but this was just ridiculous and uncomfortable. for some odd reason, there is always a wait.. every time i've gone there, it's been packed.. we had 22 tables ahead of us, but im guessing some folks gave up because we waited a little over half an hour and on got seated. last night was especially crazyyyy during the warriors/jazz game2.. i think that's the only time i want to go there now because it was amazing! the whole restaurant was roaring with simultaneous groans and cheers... if only the warriors had won...  Sooo.. if you're here for a game, you're bound to be in the vicinity of a tv.  the servers don't really bother you when you've got your eyes glued to the tv.. but will check up on you now and then. the bar area gets pretty packed, so get there early! not a huge fan of their chicago style pizzas and the rest of the food is typical american fare.. i like their potatoes, but i like all potatoes, so i can't rate bj's based on baked potatoes. not to mention you really can't screw them up..  service was fine. the food came quickly.. it was yummy.. donna was happy.."
