Stephanie B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,48,12,1.0,3/20/2011,"Everytime I have come here it has been a dissapointment. I came here for my friends birthday and there were 8 of us. Of course they don't take reservations so we knew the wait was going to be long, it was 2 hours. Two hours goes by and we ask them if the table is ready and they said not yet they were waiting for our table for 8 to open up. Then another 45 minutes goes by and we finally get called. They put us at a table for 4 people and put a small table on the end. WTF??? This was they table they made us wait almost 3 hours for. So, since we were all starving and didn't want to wait any longer we decided to just order. As we all sat way too close to each other we had told the waiter it was our friend's birthday, so they would sing and make him feel special. When our food arrived it was not worth the price at all, they put way too many spices on their food. Then our drinks finally came out  halfway through the meal and there was food in 2 of the 8 drinks we ordered, I don't know how they didn't see food floating in the drinks, gross. As we finished our meals we were waiting for them to bring the birthday boy his dessert, and at this time it wasn't busy at all. We kept reminding our waiter and we sat their for another 45 minutes just waiting. We decided to just leave because they obviously didn't care. As soon as we walk to the door the just handed it to him and walked away, no song or anything. An we had already left the table. This place is a huge dissapointment, and will not be getting my service anymore. The only reason they get a star out of me is because of the root beer they serve."
L.N. M.,"San Bruno, CA",46,30,,2.0,6/7/2008,"I don't know if it's a BJ's thing to have long wait time and lousy service -- the BJ's I used to go to in LA is just as bad. As everyone else says, the wait time is abysmal. The bar area is a great place to hang out after work -- if you can grab a table or a place at the bar. Again, be prepared to wait. The food is great though and the beer sampler is fun."
Larry L.,"San Francisco, CA",17,209,2,4.0,12/27/2008,"Recommend Happy Hour! I've been here many many times for happy hour and late night. Order the wings and bbq chicken pizza. Beer you gotta go for the ""Reds"" if your a dark drinker and or ""Pirana"" which is a little lighter."
Rick G.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,8,,3.0,6/7/2008,"The food's not bad. Service is decent...not the most attentive or lively..seems like they just want to get out of there..but I can see why, this place gets really busy.. It's just all about the pizookie! I'll be coming back for it often!"
Bernadette J.,"Brisbane, CA",0,15,,4.0,6/2/2011,"I love BJ's food and beer.  Expect to wait at least 45 minutes if you show up anytime near a normal meal time.  It isn't so bad though, because you can wander around the mall while you wait.  Their portions are massive, so essentially all their meals are half priced too, because you get a whole extra left over meal.  Also, PIEZOOKIE.  Winning!"
Michelle B.,"San Francisco, CA",344,147,20,4.0,10/20/2008,"This place has the best clam chowder! Their special lunch menu is the best too! You get half a sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder for around 6 bucks and that got me stuffed! Their pizza is good too, but a bit pricey. I'm definitely coming back!"
T H.,"San Mateo, CA",2,33,,2.0,10/21/2005,"You're experience may be different than mine, and there will certainly be people that really like BJ's.   However, after 2 visits, and a couple of hundred $$ later, count me out.  Don't get me wrong. The design and ambiance is interesting and new for our area. The beers taste tested ok. The music type is welcome. I really wanted BJ's to work out - we need another trustable restaurant.  The staff was fine; personable and caring.  However, there are so many different people interacting with the table that you don't see your waitperson that often. ) We requested ketchup with two different people and it never came. Finally, we scrounged a bottle off a neighboring table.)  But these recipes, and the kitchen, just don't cut it. Middle-of-the-road flavors. Nothing striking.  Not one person that went with us in two visits ever said ""wow, that's good.""   So I'll just list the various things that I thought, or others told me. (We did share bites off our orders.)  - No sauce or flavoring on the various dishes were anything more than bland. (Sauces with onion strings are mild and unopinionated. Chili is surprisingly pedestrian. Tartar sauce is almost certainly generic wholesale.)  - Potato wedges that came with a dish were cold - well the ones on the top were. The few on the bottom were lukewarm. But, the food they came with, (battered cod on the fish and chips plate) was hot.  - However, the fish was over-cooked, and, get this, tough and stringy. The batter was chewy, rubbery. Very strange. Not crisp.  - Fish tacos were simply average flavors.  - The Chili Baked Potato was gargantuan. I swear - it's just not a natural size. The chili served over it looked like it had been painted on with a paintbrush - really. Then cheese melted on top of that. The potato didn't ""flake"" when you forked it - it came apart in a kind of pasty chunk. I don't understand how you bake a potato and make it do that. It was cooked and done well enough, but the meat of the potato was like molded paste. I was really confused by that.  - Fiends we saw at a nearby table had a cheese pizza and the chicken baked potato on their table. Said the pizza was ok, liked the crust. The baked potato was being sent back as inedible (didn't like the texture of the potato either.)  There's more, and there were some things I did like (Like the various brews they create. I tried 4, liked all but one - liked the strawberry lemonade and the Pizooki dessert.)"
Marjorie B.,"San Francisco, CA",241,287,35,3.0,12/2/2006,"We were almost expelled for being too rowdy.  Mediocre service attributed to its popularity as a hang out dine and drink place after a full day of shopping.  Great appetizers and generally pretty good signature microbrews.  The amber ones are my favorite.  If you elect to try and finish the beer sampler by yourself, plan on having a barf bag at hand."
BigAppetite ..,"Pacifica, CA",4,63,7,1.0,8/2/2007,"I came to this location with my friend for dinner.  I ordered a burger and a pizza.  The burger was overseasoned...almost to the point of inediblness, and the pizza was below average.  Everything was overpriced in my opinion.  The only plus side was the service and even that was marginal."
Derek Alistair J.,"San Francisco, CA",89,146,,2.0,8/15/2007,"here's a little story regarding this place. a couple walks in. and decide they're going to have lunch. its summer, its hot and all they want is to sit in a relaxing place thats quiet, quant and can afford some privacy while being able to afford the food. this couple decides all these things are available here.  upon entering, they get seated. greeted by rather disproportionately shaped woman with dough eyes and smile. as the couple sits, they're greeted by a rather hulking gentleman. after going off on verbatim, he decides, to hit on the woman,  'hey where do you go?'  'UCSD' 'oh thats cool. yeah I'm studying stuff too. I really like reading and stuff.' 'oh you don't say?' 'so what are you studying?' 'astrophycists' 'oh thats so awesome. yeah I want a major where I can make some money too. I was thinking of going to SDSU.' 'oh thats interesting,' Kristin replys,  Steve coughs. 'oh hey man, sorry, what's up with you man?' 'good, just a bit hungry.' 'So Bro, Where do you go to school?' obviously angered that he hasn't even asked for their order, steve turns and smiles and replies, 'oh, I am studying at the School of Hard Knocks. Where I'm getting my PHD, my Playa Hatin' Degree.' Kristin, unable to turn away and then laugh, burst in laughter, he gets their order, returns with the cheque.  thats a true story. I kid you not.  so what's the moral of the story? never eat. here. ever. please. do you understand that friend? ugh."
Kathy K.,"San Francisco, CA",2,21,2,4.0,3/4/2009,"one word , pizookie xD!! cookie with ice cream on top =] wut a wonderful creation i liek this place...x)"
M J.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,36,5,1.0,1/27/2008,"Pretty bad service. They didn't greet us at all. Didn't offer to bring drinks while we looked over our menu. Our appetizer never came. Then when it came half way through our meal it was completely the wrong thing. They didn't get our order right and even when it was their fault they acted like it was our fault. One time during our meal some food came to our table that we didn't order - not very organized. Seems like they don't care about getting return business because they didn't make us feel very welcome.  It was pretty surprising that they managed to make every food completely swimming in grease -- yes, even our salad: swimming in grease. I guess since they have their own beer on-tap flowing they don't have to worry about keeping customers happy with their ""service."" Perhaps if we had a few beers we wouldn't have cared that they were so rude and slow."
Haven L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,,5.0,8/14/2011,"Their food and environment are great! What more can you ask for besides maybe complimentary bread at the beginning? Anyway, good place to go with friends. I recommend any one of their pizzas, the chili bowl, and of course, the chocolate chip PIZOOKIE."
Leroid D.,"San Francisco, CA",148,294,7,3.0,4/27/2006,"I give it extra stars for the convenience. It's a decent spot to hang out with the folks, watch sports, and knock back a few of their in-house ales (which are not so bad). Other than that, most of these ""comfort food"" chains are all the same. I can't think of one dish that stands out at BJ's. If Chili's, Red Robin's, or TGI Friday's too busy, you can go to BJ's. And vice versa. Got a large party of 10+, make sure to call 24 hours in advance."
Nathalie N.,"Sacramento, CA",215,309,319,2.0,1/31/2007,The place lacks service. I dont know how many times Ive had to ask my server for water and got it after I was done with my dinner. My boyfriend asked for bread with his pasta. And he didn't get it till after he was half way thru. The idea of waiting for dessert for 35 minutes is beyond me.
Ron J.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/19/2008,"Terrible restaurant.  The food is cold and generally flavorless (as well as overpriced).  The wait is typically long and the service is indifferent at best and downright rude at worst. This place will probably survive simply due to a highly desirable location.  However, I'd love to see it replaced."
Genesis K.,"San Francisco, CA",1673,17,,4.0,2/22/2009,"This place is a great place to watch SPORTS!  Well when bay area sports are good that is, on any night theres a big game or when the warriors are playing you have to wait at least 20-40 minutes, but other then that you got to love BJ's with its awesome root beer, and strawberry lemonade thats bottomless, you cant go wrong with bottomless drinks on top of great food, from great pasta, to great pizza, to great deserts, you got to love BJ's....When your there get their pizookie its a cookie pizza with ice cream on top which is BOMB, although you do get a stomach ache right after its worth it...Beware tho, you could easily spend 40 dollars for two people plus tip, so go there looking to spend money."
Posi P.,"San Mateo, CA",7,30,3,4.0,2/18/2009,The best BJ's! I come all the way from San Mateo to THIS BJ's just so I don't have to go to the one at Bridgepoint.
W W.,"Millbrae, CA",18,45,2,2.0,11/13/2007,Pricey.  The food isn't that great. Decent at best. The surrounding is nice though.
Tess E.,"South San Francisco, CA",14,142,,1.0,11/30/2009,"I gave this place 1 star, strictly for this location.  I've been to other BJ's and have always had a pleasant experience.  But I was severly disappointed when I tried this one in San Bruno (sadly since I really like BJ's otherwise).  It was mainly the service that made it such a horrible experience!!  We waited forever to place our drink orders, then another life time to place our actual dinner orders.  We could barely seem to get our server's attention, or any server for that matter.  I asked several people, including the hostess if they could find our server, only to be ignored and finally, I flagged down a manager but he was unhelpful as well.  They supposedly failed to communicate that our server had gone on break but either way NO ONE was helping us and even the manager seemed unapologetic.  Why did I stay for all that?? It was my sister's last night before moving out of state and it was already late so I just really wanted to have dinner (plus she hadn't tried this restaurant yet and I really wanted her to try their pizookies).  Too bad her first experience was like that.  It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  On the plus side (I will give them that much) I wrote a very lengthy and detailed complaint about this location on their web and I got a personal email and handwritten note from their general manager apologizing for the experience including a $25 comp card.  Since this is the closest location to me, I did go back to redeem the comp card---take out of course! I wouldn't subject myself to that kind of service again!"
