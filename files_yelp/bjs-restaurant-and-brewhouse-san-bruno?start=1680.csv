Lindsay M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,9/7/2011,"I like BJ's but their service isn't the greatest. They take a long time to take your order, and refill drinks. But other than that they are good. I just think they are understaffed."
Jody C.,"San Francisco, CA",429,36,4,2.0,10/17/2008,First off this place is always busy and I can't seem to understand why because their food is GROSS.  I have been here a couple of times and never by choice and every time we had to wait forever and then the food is crap.  Their drinks are OK but that is all I can really say.  If you have a large party good luck...you have to wait a LONG LONG time and then even with a small group of people you have to wait.  I don't even get it...how does a place that doesn't taste that great have soo much people...GO FIGURE!!!
Melody M.,"Glendale, AZ",7,52,5,4.0,2/7/2011,"My boyfriend and I have been frequenting this Bjs for about 5 years now and the experience really varies from time to time.  We've had times where everything was perfect from the hostess to waiter to food and bill.   But other times we've had horrible experiences where the food didnt come out right, took forever to replace the order, and didnt even bother to take it off the bill.  Then again, those were the best and worst experiences.  Usually its a decent place, great food and good service.  We've order a wide range of food and drinks.  We usually do our favorites such as the brewhouse nachos (my boyfriends absolute fave), the potato skins, the tomato bisque soup, the full rack of ribs, pulled pork sandwich, the burger pizza, the grilled chicken pasta, the shrimp scampi (my favorite!), the old fashion pot roast, the meatloaf, and lastly the pork chops.  The only thing there that I dont like is the lasagna, for some reason it comes out watery looking and tasting and was just wrong all over.  Oh yes, their desserts are awesome as well the pizookie is something to try =)   The wait times can be long on weekends and during sporting events so do a call ahead and theyll put your name in the waitling list and by the time you arrive, youll be seated!"
Mary P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,33,,4.0,7/19/2009,"Came here on a Saturday night around 7pm and had to wait almost an hour to get seated...fortunately there's a Barnes & Noble right across the mall so we could just sit and read.  Otherwise the wait would have been way too long.  The service wasn't great, either - my dad ordered the soup and salad, the latter of which arrived along with the rest of our food and the former of which didn't come for another half hour or so.  And the maitre 'd said that was a SLOW night for them!  I can't imagine how bad the wait and service are on a busy night! Aside from those drawbacks, though, the food was quite good and the ambiance was fun.  I had their root beer, which they brew themselves (YUM) and the parmesan chicken.  The portions were huge, and it was so good that I forgot about the wait :)"
Takeru A.,"San Ramon, CA",7,24,138,3.0,4/1/2008,"The taste isn't guaranteed, and the prices are okay, but I kinda like the huge, gigantic deep dish pizza which you can share with lots of friends. When I went there, the waitress was taking her sweet time, and didn't seem to be friendly, though it's probably because it was getting late, near closing time. The atmosphere and decor is fine, and I especially like the outdoor fire pit, which can be fun and useful during winter time!"
Florence W.,"Fremont, CA",122,281,27,4.0,7/30/2008,"Can I just say how fabulous their Pizookie's are?!? They are sooo yum yum in my tum tum and are baked fresh with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on them! They have multiple flavors but the best are choco chip and white choco macadamia. the best part--if you can't decide, you can get it half and half! I did that and asked for my ice cream on the side (i have this weird thing where my foods can't touch...too messy). The server, I think his name was Alex, forgot to do so and served it right on top of the pizookie. I didn't say anything because forgetfulness happens and when he realized it, he told me he'd take it off the bill. They have excellent service and didn't get mad that we just came in for pizookie's. Their pizookies are soooo fresh and can be the sweetest ending to any night!"
G L.,"Oakland, CA",1,32,1,2.0,4/10/2011,"Never heard of this place before I went for a work event. I thought the name was a joke, especially considering Hooters is on the other side of the mall entrance. Sadly this place is for real. Extremely large menu of mediocrity. I am no chain snob and have happily enjoyed many a meal at Olive Garden, Chili's, Red Lobster, etc, but BJs is worse than them all. Also the service always seems rushed even when there isn't a crowd."
Alex H.,"San Francisco, CA",22,42,,4.0,7/22/2008,"I love BJ's !!!! whether it's the one in Tanforan or Bridgepoint, I'm there. Avocado Rolls is a must for me.. and I also need my TOTONKA beer. Only one time they were out of Totonka... so my back up was the PM Porter... good as well. And then just end it with their specialty pizza. Always had a good time at BJ's.. never had problems with the staff, they are always ""mostly"" nice (  the food industry is a bitch... so I understand). There is always a waiting time on the weekends.. but it is always like that not matter where you go."
Michelle P.,"Oakland, CA",7,41,,3.0,12/20/2008,"i remember when this BJ's first opened.. everyone came here. why they always came here? because the pizookie is soooo good. other than that? i really don't know. i'll admit, the pizookie is really good. their artichoke dip is pretty awesome too. but the rest of the menu isn't that great. i don't know why everyone gets the pizza, i don't find any of their specialties very special at all (bad joke, i know). and yes, they have a very large selection of beers that are probably very good.. but i don't like beer. they do have one that i really like though, but thats probably because it doesn't taste like beer at all. with all the chain restaurants around, this place is definitely right up to par with the rest of them. nothing special. semi-decent food for the masses. but i will say, this is a really good place to come and watch the basketball game :]"
Lizzy L.,"Sausalito, CA",214,167,17,4.0,11/15/2007,"a pitcher of nutty brunette spinach artichoke dip & a white chocolate macademia nut pizookie i don't care about the wait, the price, or the damn pizza. give me these 3 glorious indulgences & i am set for life."
Jessica B.,"Millbrae, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/1/2013,"My party of three (myself, my husband and my 7 year old son) arrived at the restaurant around 5pm. It wasn't too packed as the wait was only 10 minutes. When we were seated we noticed many many open tables and booths yet they had a few people waiting up front. Once they sat us down they sat us in the back right in between two other tables. We moved to a booth and things seemed better until I opened the napkin to retrieve my silverware. All the utensils were spotted and my fork had residual red lipstick smeared on it and I opened all six napkins that were on the table.  Then we ordered our dinners. I ordered the baked potato. 45 minutes after taking our order the waiter brings my son and my husband's food and asks me if the manager has spoken with me. No one had. Apparently they ran out of potatoes. I was offered soup or salad after the fact. I declined and still no one came to talk with me. I watched my family eat and our waiter was nowhere to be found. I guess he didn't want to deal with us anymore because of the dinner issue. We had to flag him down to get our check because we wanted to get the heck outta there. Needless to say it was a horrible experience. On my way out I informed the manager of the issues and she told me she would look into it although she didn't ask me for any information so I think it is highly unlikely that she did. There was no service recovery attempted and I'll be damned if I ever eat there again. So not impressed."
Davvy L.,"Portland, OR",81,64,36,4.0,7/26/2006,Have a Taster Round... 8 glasses of 8 oz beer of each kind... Gotta love it...
Aaron G.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/8/2009,This place is way too crowded. I can't figure it out because the food isn't very good(I had a pizza and the dough was still raw). The waitress was rude to me and my guest and when I said something she went over to her fellow waitress friend and I swear she started talking shit. WHAT BITCH? I do like the bar though. The bartender is cool. He saved this from becoming my first one star review.
Jeremy W.,"San Francisco, CA",58,49,50,5.0,2/20/2007,"5 stars based on two experiences; one in Long Beach, one in the Tanforan Mall. LB yielded the best deep dish pizza I ever had (two pizzas total) with appetizers and dessert coming out to be about 40$, which was a killer deal. Tanforan Mall, had lunch w/ coworkers. I ordered the soup and potato combo for lunch; luckily I only got HALF a potato b/c that shit was huge; think the size of half a shoebox. All that for only 8$; incredible deal. Great food, nice atmosphere, will defintely go here instead of TGI Friday's (see my review for it)"
Y P.,"San Bruno, CA",68,67,60,3.0,5/20/2007,"For a restaurant chain it's a decent place.  The service could really be a lot better.  I've dined here at least 3 times and I hate always having to wait for a table.  My first time, the waitress forgot one of our appetizers and we had to wait so long.  She told us that she will not charge us for it.  So much for trusting people.....I found out I was charged for it and I was already home and too tired to go back to dispute $8!  It's a good place to meet because it's easy to find (especially when I have to meet with friends who are not familiar with San Bruno) but I'd rather have food in the food court than eat and be served in this place again.  If you want a drink....just head to the bar."
R G.,"San Bruno, CA",7,40,,3.0,12/6/2008,"This place is crazy busy on Friday/Sat. nights since it is the only place around beautiful San Bruno that isn't a fast food joint or one of the horrible Applebees/Chilis/TGI Fridays/Ruby Tuesday nightmares. BJ's has some really nice micro brews and a good menu selection. The fish and chips are the best I have had since visiting England last year and the halibut tacos are very nice. If there is a long wait, they have a large bar area where you can get full service. If you want to wait for a table, just get the buzzer and go hang out at the big book store across the hall. This place is a chain, but it doesn't give that feel of being at a Denny's in Green Bay, WI. like other places."
Ry T.,"San Francisco, CA",582,1509,1898,3.0,8/2/2008,"Not the most spectacular place for food, just another ""Elephant Bar"" chain.  Visually ease-dropping on surrounding customers, the deep pan pizzas were popular as were the baked potato skins.  The baked potatoes which came with entrees were huge.  We tried the sliders (Angus mini-burgers) which weren't that good.  The buns tasted bland.  It came with sliced tomatoes, pickles and shredded lettuce.  A side of their thin fries was an extra $1 only!  They were crispy and good.  The onion strings were extremely oily. Gasp, I could fuel a car with all that oil and save some money.  The Caesar salad wasn't too bad, a bit heavy on the dressing, no anchovies (shucks).  A large bowl of clam chowder was a tad larger than a cup of soup but it had a lot of minced clams in it, just too salty.  What did taste pretty good was the pasta and chicken and hubby liked his grilled chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes (taters were good!) and surprisingly, all 3 chicken dishes we ordered were cooked just right. The chicken was nice and moist.  Our server kept our glasses filled and was perfunctory.  There is an extensive beer and cider list and they make their own brand of ale.  Reservations are for 6 or larger but they'll write your name down and hold it until your name is called and if you don't answer, they'll give your table away.  Still, I wouldn't make a special trip to come here to eat."
J S.,"South San Francisco, CA",2,22,,1.0,2/21/2008,"At the end of my first visit I swore I'd never return.  After my second visit (yeah I know, shut up) I decided to write this review. Virtually none of the four or so dishes I tasted would I describe as 'good.' Most I would describe as very bad, including the nachos. I thought nachos were a safe bet. B.J.'s proved me wrong. The staff ranges from indifferent to downright hateful. The name is very fitting, 'cuz this place blows."
mario S.,"CA, CA",12,31,,3.0,7/27/2008,"BJ's has good beer but it ends there. Food here has the ""I've been frozen before"" taste. BUT.. this is a cool place to hang out have some beers and watch the game on the big screen HD tvs."
Peter L.,"Los Altos, CA",4,47,,3.0,10/12/2008,"Food here is just ok, not too good, not too bad.  If you've been to one BJ's you've been to them all, there is absolutely no need to come back here again and again.  It's got some big screens and many smaller TVs so it should be decent if you come here to watch games.   Their brews aren't bad, I'd say above average.  My favorite is the Red.  Our waiter at this particular was this no-so-bright emo kid.  Couldn't recommend anything to us, couldn't tell what's good and what's bad. We went on Sat night at around 10, a group of 5, and there was no wait to sit around the bar area."
