Shannon H.,"Reno, NV",19,20,,5.0,11/19/2008,"This was the first time I had every been to BJ's and I had an awesome experience! My Fiancee and I wanted to set at a booth, but the hostess told us that there wasn't a server for where we wanted to sit, but then Cory directed us to the bar area where we cold sit at a booth , and get money off of our appetizer and drinks... Thanks Cory! Our waitress Lee was also very cool. She kept on top of our drinks and was very helpful in my drink selection. Thanks Lee!"
Julie W.,"Daly City, CA",14,63,4,3.0,11/17/2008,"This place has great apps, though don't even bother on a weekend night or Fridays.  There will ALWAYS be a 1.5-2 hour wait for dinner.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants or places where I need to wait more than an hour especially for franchise type food.  It does deserve 3.5 stars really since service is friendly and food is decent, though quite greasy."
Mark D.,"Washington, DC",32,792,25,3.0,7/13/2007,"A chain amongst other chains...BJ's doesn't really distinguish itself too much.  The spinach dip appetizer was good, they specialize in pizza and it was only okay...a little dry and not saucy enough.  The beers were good but pricey."
Alia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",441,470,171,2.0,9/13/2007,Everything is really not that great. The only food worth noting is the cookie that comes in the pizza pan. Appetizers . . . eh. Main course . . . eh. Beer isn't all that special either. It is a large chain restaurant so expect the service and food quality of a chain. I usually get lured into comin back because of friends. Half the time we are ignored by the host and end up at the bar area seating. S'ok.
Patrick G.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,247,8,3.0,9/14/2006,"The beers are definitely worth your while after shopping at Tanforan, and the chicago-style pizza's aren't half bad. Burgers and sandwiches are standard fare for a place like this and you can't go wrong with those, either. Big, hearty portions. My only complaint is that the other customers seem to get kind of bitchy here. I guess that's what happens when you wait an hour for someplace when having few quality alternatives, similar to the Elephant Bar phenomenon at Serramonte. One time a person came up to my table, reached right in front of me to take a menu from the center caddy, but had trouble getting it out, so fumbled awkwardly for ten seconds, all the time her arm inches in front of my face, never once even acknowledging me. At that point she might as well have helped herself to a few french fries off my plate."
Mel L.,"San Francisco, CA",106,161,,2.0,9/6/2007,"yawn. food is nothing to rave about. it may be okay the first couple of times, but really after the 2nd visit you won't want to be back. the wait is horrible and bar is too damn crowded. service is lacking - i swear on my last visit the waiter was high. i shouldn't have to ask 3 times for a damn box or wait 15 minutes for you to get me a check.  if you, like i did,  have to go for work dinners or something else you can't get out of - just drink lots and lots of cider. that's the only thing on the menu that is good time after time. plus, they can't screw up cider, can they?"
Stephen P.,"Ashland, OR",100,100,14,2.0,7/9/2008,"Boring!!!! My my, what can I say about boring.  Lets see.  Best thing on the menu is...none of it is horrid.  Would I spend a dime over this place before going almost anywhere else.  Frankly no.  So why so down on old BJ?  Well lets see.  Beers are - just ok.  Food is Fridays quality and variety.  The crowds are - just that.  The service is ok.  I have gone at least 30 times for this or that reason and frankly - no improvement.  But it never gets worse.  So if you want to go where you can get a decent lettuce wrap or roast beef dip, go here.  If you want decent food and good beer.  Don't waist your time."
Dao C.,"San Francisco, CA",177,56,8,3.0,9/10/2007,"I personally don't like the food at BJ's.  The food is ""ok"". Actually, it's all ""beer food"". I wouldn't come here to find a wholesome meal. The only thing I like about about this place is their variety of beer. It's a nice place to hang out and have a party at."
Marciano P.,"San Francisco, CA",101,47,,5.0,3/18/2006,"Man, this place is the bomb.  They make their own beer, and it's cheap, 2.95 a pint.  The food is good.  The price is not bad, just think of TGIF's prices, but much better selection on food, drinks and dessert.  The Pizookie is frickin awesome!!!!  I will contuinue to come to this resturant.  I first went to this place in Colorado in Boulder.  I loved it then and love it now.  The wait could be long for seating, this place is always packed, but it is worth the wait."
Alberto S.,"South San Francisco, CA",3,62,10,3.0,3/16/2008,"The food is okay.  Not my first choice (or 10Th choice), but we go here for office lunches.  The place looks nice and it gets crowded at lunch time.  I haven't been there at night.  If you're in the mall and very hungry you may want to check-it out.  They have a variety of choices:  hamburgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta and pizza.  I had the chili once and was expecting something thick...I got more of a soup.  I recently had the sliders (small hamburgers).  They are listed on the appetizer section.  You get four small burgers with lettuce, tomato and pickles.   They weren't bad."
Heidi F.,"Oakland, CA",17,105,,3.0,8/6/2008,"The food taste good, big portion and decent prices.  Minus two star because like most people said, service is sooooooooo slow."
Mario P.,"South San Francisco, CA",101,232,264,4.0,6/23/2008,"The portions are plentiful and the food just tastes really good.  One of the better additions to the remodeled Tanforan Mall.  The wait can be a little long, especially when you have impatient kids, but worth it.  The club sandwich is yummy and ranks pretty high on my list (I've had some pretty bad ones at other places).  Their Cookie dessert is just too filling (eat light if you want to try it).  Don't get me wrong - it's delicious and you better ask for some cold milk (you can't drink anything else with it)!  Service varies depending on which server you get.  I have to say, the females seem to always have better service, but their was at least one guy who deserved a good tip when I ate there earlier this year."
adam m.,"Newtownards, United Kingdom",7,77,1,2.0,9/9/2008,"This place seems to rely on quantity and not necessarily quality. The servers were quite attentive and the food was good, but good in a ""it wasn't bad"" kinda way."
Cassie L.,"Arcata, CA",7,65,,1.0,6/24/2006,"This place is another TGIF, it sucks!  Plan on waiting at least 45 minutes up to an hour, for food that will take 40 minutes to arrive once you order it!  I would expect this from a restaurant that wasn't a chain, but this restaurant sucks!  Seriously there is not one ounce of originality within the walls of the ""brewery"" (their beer sucks too!)"
Michelle N.,"San Mateo, CA",261,104,107,2.0,3/31/2007,"EVERY TIME I COME HERE... I keep forgetting not to because the food is just, uggh.  At first, when i tried it, it was delish.  But you later on realize, its... JUST LIKE TGIF, and all those other chain food restaruants.   We came in between lunch and dinner, for some linner.  Even though I have been here multiple times, this time had to be one of the saddest times ever.  I swear, the employees had no enthusiasm.  When I used to work at a restaraunt, I had to be peppy and everything.  The hostess was like *eh* when she looked at us, and told her we have a table for two.  She slowly got us menus, dropped a bunch, picked it up... then brought us to the table... slowly.  Waiters around us were eh.  Our waiter was dull.  Well, maybe he was nice, but he was barely around so I couldn't even refill my drink.  boooo to that.  Ok so BJs sucks, pizookie? are good.  Food is eh."
Randy G.,"San Francisco, CA",13,1,,4.0,3/25/2011,"I LOVE this place!!! GREAT food, friendly service and YAY half price happy hour"
Michael R.,"San Bruno, CA",1,27,1,2.0,3/29/2007,"Great Beer & Mediocre Food. The main problem is the inconsistancy of the food & service, I have best results at the bar, but when eating with my family its always hit or miss. THe last time I was there with my Toddler I requested a high chair and kept receivng a booster, which is too big for her at 11/2 yrd old. Go for happy hour and the sports, forget the food unless you're to buzzed to drive. Great Sports Bar look with excellent TV coverage."
Arica V.,"San Francisco, CA",262,256,1,2.0,7/4/2010,"It's pretty bad when my bf encourages me to write a bad review on yelp.  He believes that you should go a couple times to give a more complete review.  BJ's is Shawn's favorite restaurant so we have been here way more than a couple times.  We stopped frequenting this location because of a couple of things.  We have on more than one occasion received a dead pager.  While we sat for an awfully long time in front of the check in stand and kept inquiring of our status, no one ever thought to see if our pager was working or to ask our names.  Then they acted like we had missed the pager going off with no apology.  Another reason was that I order the same salad every time and every time it comes out wrong.  All I ask is that I have a Santa Fe salad with NO red peppers and shrimp.  Every time it has peppers in it and one time it came out with chicken - this last time the shrimp came out  undercooked.  Our waiter was really cool but obviously this place doesn't have it together.  We will be venturing to Bridgepointe for our next BJ's fix - the food is much better and the service is actually good."
Alexandra A.,"Daly City, CA",34,44,5,4.0,8/2/2008,"Every time I eat here I am impressed by the food and the service. I guess that will happen when you sit at the bar a lot, even so when I would come here with friends the service was alway great. One thing I have noticed is that if you are seated at one of the table and don't  order a beer the service tends to go downhill a little bit. Maybe it's me but that's just my take. Anyway back to the review. My first time at this place I ordered a fettucini alfredo - regular size. Boy was that filling or what! I came out of there pretty satisfied. Here's a comparison for you when you order the same dish at the Olive Garden it shouldn't be dry and hard but moist and creamy. BJ's version of that dish was just what was expected. And the Olive Garden serves Italian food by default - go figure! It's kind of sad when another restaurant makes something better than you when that's supposed to be what you are good at. Some restaurants have some appetizers that just get you through the time until you get your actual meall. At BJ's just eating an appetizer alone can really fill you up. Now don't get me started on the desserts. They really take care of you here. The BJ's Brownie is really divine. From far away it looks like a small mountain of ice cream, whipped cream, fudge sauce and then the brownie that's slightly warm. Yummy! Thanks BJ's for making a fan out of me. I really love ya!"
Khan M.,"San Jose, CA",64,17,,3.0,1/28/2006,Man this place is loud never really noticed before but its hard trying to have a conversation with someone here. Lots of TV with sports which is always nice. Food is your typical brewery slash diner place. All the fattening food you can get your hands on.
