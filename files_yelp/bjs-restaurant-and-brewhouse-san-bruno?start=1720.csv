Vivian D.,"San Francisco, CA",153,351,106,5.0,5/14/2008,"Their food and service here is usually pretty good. Also, you can walk around the mall while you wait, which is a plus. =)  I would come here just for one of their pizookis! they're amazing!"
Johnny T.,"San Francisco, CA",21,98,7,2.0,6/23/2008,"Whenever I come here, I always try to get the most healthiest thing on the menu, but it's hard when everything sounds so greasy, even the salads. I can tell you, never order the lettuce wraps here! It's so damn oily and greasy! There is so much excess oil at the bottom of the boil of the minced chicken. Ewwwww. The only reason why I come here is whenever i'm feeling hungry while shopping and don't wanna eat in the food court. Even though I know I should of just eaten at the food court, 'cause im sure they have betters things there... for the future reference. Another reason why I come here is for the Kazookies! their DEELISH! Esp. the OREO one. Its a must def for whoever comes here! The wait for seats is really long espically on fridays/saturdays nights. So.. come early!"
Gary L.,"Oakland, CA",181,273,45,4.0,5/8/2008,"I've only been to this BJ's for Happy Hour.  There's a good HH selection of brews and bar food.  I like the brunette ale which is what I usually go with (what can I say, I'm a sucker for brunettes).  And now, HH starts even earlier at 3 instead of 4, so there's one extra hour to forget about the days work."
Alison N.,"San Francisco, CA",250,245,15,4.0,12/13/2007,"Fun place to go to with friends. I've eaten here twice, got the exact same thing. Chicken Caesar Salad with a root beer and a cookie dessert thing? They make their own root beer. Mmmmm. And the cookie thing....I really don't remember the name p-something? I dunno, it's good though w/e it's called. A WARM cookie with a load of ice cream. Delicious! As for the other stuff, I honestly could not tell you if it's good or not."
Mai G.,"South San Francisco, CA",5,84,3,2.0,7/11/2008,"came here for lunch...waited...waited...server arrived, took orders, food ok... came here for happy hour...waited...waited...waited...oh a table...waited...waited...server arrived...took order...waited...waited...waited...blonde's good...ask for lemon...waited...waited...waited...f%@k! where is that b*&^%ch!!! gave 3 pieces of lemons for a party of 8...come on!!!...asked for extra chair...rolled eyes on us... slow service with an attitude...ok food...ehng crowd"
Angelica D.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,44,15,3.0,7/10/2010,The food is good. Sometimes cold tho. In a word inconsistent!!! The wait is ridiculous and sometimes NOT worth the wait. The hosts are always rude and act like they don't give a crap. They aren't friendly AT ALL! I've had many horrible experiences here and only come back when I have no choice. Pizookies are amazing tho! Deep dish and margherita flatbread pizza are good tho. Pastas very dry never enough sauce.
Alvin C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,,2.0,9/26/2009,"I'd give them more stars (maybe if I bounce back from the next experience), but the last time I went there they told us the wait would be like 45 minutes. Which is fine because I know they get busy but we waited about an hour and when we finally got inside, the restaurant was EMTPY. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen, it's a terrible way to do business. I understand if you're understaffed for the lunch hour but obviously you get customers at that hour then they should be smart enough to hire more staff for those hours. And when we finally got in the service was like ""eh...okay"". We waited a long time to order and then longer to get drinks then longer for food. It's not even like dinner time, it was like the hour before dinner where only a third of the restaurant was full. Please please please work on your customer service."
Jay G.,"South San Francisco, CA",81,39,10,2.0,5/21/2010,"I've been here for happy hour, lunch, and dinner and can always say that i've never had good service.  Decent service, but never good and most of the time even bad.  I would recommend sitting at the actual bar, not the bar area.  The servers there just seem like they don't care.  Of course when they bring you your bill they are super nice and ask how everything was and if we need anything else.  The food is pretty good and it's very close to my house which is why I've been there a handful of times.  I would just hope that management does a better job of managing it's staff.  There's usually a long wait and sometimes people end up leaving, and this could definitely be helped a lot if the staff was more efficient.  I hate having to ask for the bill.  The last time i went we sat there with empty plates and empty glasses while people were waiting to take our table in the bar area for at least 15 min.  It was very evident we were done and ready to go but yet our server, busser, nobody seemed to care.  Other servers went by but always look like they don't care about us, which i can understand since we aren't their table but they can at least smile or tell us they'll get our server for us.  I would recommend trying somewhere else if possible."
Jason F.,"Denver, CO",56,297,72,3.0,3/5/2008,"I'd give it 3.5 stars. I loved ""A drink like that""! It tasted soooo good, had two and probably could have had more! The dish I ordered was pasta and chicken which was very good. For dessert I shared a pazookie which was fantastic. So fattening, but ohhh so good. There server was friendly and nice and the service in general was just fine. I enjoyed my experience here. I have been to other Bj's restaurants and its a good place for some food. I loved that they had a billion tv screens playing every kind of sports you can think of, that's a big plus!"
Mikey L.,"Daly City, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/13/2009,"This place was okay.  I went on a weekend night and it was a little crowded but that comes with the territory in the bay. I had a chicken breast dish and it actually was pretty good for what I would expect at a restaurant like this.  It was some time ago that I went so I believe it came with vegetables and mashed potatoes and again, these were better than expected.  My companion has the pot roast dish and I tried some of that and it actually was decent as well. The sights were okay, I mean it is South San Francisco so you will see your fair share of trashy mexicans, stupid looking asians who are spending their parents money and goofy whites watching whatever sports are on so no surprise there.  There were no attractive females of note dining on that night, again, not a surprise.  The male waiters were dorks and the girls at the front who assign the buzzers had so much makeup on that I couldn't tell how they looked.  The female waitresses were pretty much blah, yes, that's how I would describe them.  My waitress however was the best of the bunch so i lucked out.  So was cute in that sort of could afford to lose 10 pounds, start of a double chin filipina way.  Anyway, if you know most flip females then you know I mean that lovingly right...."
Janelle H.,"San Diego, CA",866,324,766,3.0,3/14/2006,"Nice restaurant, sports bar-like, but family attractive! Tvs are everywhere,  so you don't have tot alk to your date! but...if u want to...its cozy and warm. they have chicago deep dish pizzas that are sizzling good. and for dessert...their famous pizookie! hot fresh baked cookie with a cool scoop of ice cream on top! way to finish your meal. service is a little slow."
Nat K.,"San Francisco, CA",103,381,3,4.0,1/31/2006,"I adored this chain when I was in college and it was somewhat less of a chain.  Yeah, the food can just be all right, but honestly, it's chain food, and I only go to chain restaurants when I crave chain food.   The beer is good, the pizza fulfills my specific craving, and the pizookie -- hot freshly-baked cookie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream -- is the stuff dreams are made of."
Chris F.,"Littleton, CO",22,260,,3.0,1/29/2008,"I've eaten at my fair share of BJ's in Cupertino and down in SoCal, so I wasn't surprised at how my experience at this one turned out. It's a typical burger joint, bar, sports bar, and pizza place. The food is good and the portions are huge. The service was okay, nothing extraordinary or noteworthy. Nothing much more to rave about, since it pretty much compares to other restaurants that serve American food."
Jason A.,"San Bruno, CA",871,586,342,3.0,4/19/2006,"I really hate chain restaurants!  The food here really isn't good at all.  The deep dish pizza has chewy dough and lousy sausage and the rest is your typical wings, etc.  I did like the vast amounts of flat screens all around, one of those lighter beers they serve, and the one food item: avocado egg roll dish!  Being in San Bruno, we just don't have that many options for food and beer."
Mei N.,"San Diego, CA",126,251,39,3.0,7/1/2007,"um don't you have to be of age to serve alcohol??? none of the staff there looked a day over 18.  we got seated fairly quick. i think we only waited about 20 minutes on a Thursday night. service was, eh. our kid of a waitress was a little weird. she never checked up on us and we had to flag down other staff members for lemon wedges or to add something to our order. oh yeah, at one point we had so many dishes on our table, we had to stack them ourselves. luckily, there was only 2 of us. as for the food. it wasn't too bad. as a main course we got a cesar salad (kinda expensive for the size) and a pizza (the bbq chicken). the cesar salad was a little salty. and we weren't offered extra grated Parmesan or anything. everything was mediocre with the wait staff being a little less than mediocre. yeah, this is kinda  a blah review but this was what this place was. kinda blah."
Kymberli C.,"Clayton, CA",136,1486,5781,3.0,12/18/2007,"I was dissappointed when I went to the BJ's in Maui because they didn't have the stuffed potatoes there but they had them here!!  But i was dissappointed at the potato here because they cut it in half and just topped it... it wasn't a stuffed baked potato... I remember the location in LA had a whole stuffed potato, not just one sliced in half.  This location is really nice and a good place to watch a game because theres a million and one tv's in here.  They also had a really good cocktail with don julio called ""El Diablo"".  And you can't forget to get a pizzookie!! yum!"
Veggie J.,"Daly City, CA",4,151,15,4.0,4/9/2008,"the first time i went to BJ's was in cupertino. my cousin said they had ""potatoes on steroids"" (i'm picturing potatoes as big as my head) and the BEST root beer ever. i soon found out that the potatoes weren't so ginormous, and the root beer tasted pretty much like any other root beer i've had. well, that's what i get for having great expectations. anyhow, i still like to come to this BJ's for the typical american food. it really helps when you're with people who all have different tastes. so pasta, pizza, potatoes, meat...i'm sure everyone will find something. for appetizers, i've tried the avocado egg rolls and wedge-cut french fries, both of which are good. i mean, come ON! avocados and french fries! two of the best things on earth. but the REAL DEAL is the cilantro pesto appetizer pizza. normally, i absolutely detest cilantro, and eating it will result in some throw up-age. but for some reason, i am able to eat this pizza! it's topped with yummy tomato bruschetta stuff and this is the reason this place gets four stars. the next time i go back, i think i'll just order one whole thing for myself. AWESOME. their salads sound pretty good, although i've never tried it. i'm not really big on getting a salad as a meal, but i would definitely try one of them out someday. the pasta and potatoes aren't too bad. they pass. there's quite a few vegetarian options, so it's good to not have only one thing off the menu to choose from. it's almost always a must to get a pizookie after a big artery-clogging meal. seriously, there's never any room to force a frickin' cookie with ice cream down your throat, but somehow, we manage. it's a big cookie. how can you resist? so all in all, typical restaurant with typical food. nothing super spectacular. every time i've been here, the people working have been super nice and friendly. maybe i'm lucky, i don't know. one annoyance about this place, though, is the noise level. i can never hear what the person sitting next to me is saying. and even then, we have to scream to each other. and then it results to eating silently as though we were mad at each other or like we haven't eaten for days."
Matt J.,"Omaha, NE",9,164,13,4.0,2/20/2008,Typical brewery/restaurant.  Decent beer and pretty good food. The pizza was great and the wait time doesn't seem so long since you can wander in the mall while you wait.  Although I can't recall what we had for an appetizer (some sort of shrimp roll or something) it was really good as well.
Cecile R.,"South San Francisco, CA",24,68,40,3.0,10/11/2005,"The first brewery in the San Bruno-South San Francisco area! Many screens. Many options on the menu from appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, desserts and of course, their deep dish pizzas. The place just opened up and it is ""crowded"". I would place your name for a table but hang out in the bar and grab a table there. I must say, for a pretty new place, the service is keeping up. The staff is courteous. I don't have to travel to Elephant Bar in Milbrae anymore and I'm sure this takes the load off of nearby Chili's."
Victoria R.,"San Jose, CA",189,302,7,3.0,5/24/2006,"I had a good experience.  My girlfriend and I ate in the bar area.  We both enjoyed what we ordered.  For appetizers we ordered the Avocado Eggrolls (if you love avocado in any form, this is delicious).  I ordered the Santa Fe Salad...yummy more avocadoes.  this one is similar to the salad from Elephant Bar (Santa Fe Chicken Salad).  It is a good filling salad!!  My friend had the meat loaf sandwhich.  She enjoyed hers as well, but saved it to make room for the dessert.  We had something Oreo.  It was ok.   I would go back and try other things.  They a large appealing menu.  I couldn't decide what to order at first.  So many choices."
