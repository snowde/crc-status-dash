Mikey D.,"San Francisco, CA",211,175,147,4.0,5/28/2009,"i gave four stars only because they have the best root beer.  you can't get good beer anywhere than of course bj.  they make their own root beer, how cool is that.  okay for the food.. bj's pizza are the best, if you like thick crust.  the spare ribs are good too, but again... what resturant can't make good ribs.  if you do go to bj's remember pizza and beer.  that's all you need for a good dinner.  anything else i heard wasn't that good.  i had the spaghetti something.  let's say i had only a few bite before i gave it to my dog.  sorry Brownie! he seems to like it.  but again, dogs like anything than salad.  okay enough said.  remember Bj's pizza, beer and really big tv's screen to watch sports.  if you like the atmosphere, go there."
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,1888,1488,2.0,12/14/2009,It takes super long to get a table here! I do like the pizookie so I can't complain too much. I think the service at the San Mateo is a little bit better because they aren't as crowded.
Heather I.,"Spokane, WA",0,39,,2.0,8/29/2008,"The only reason this place gets more than one star is the pizookie, that item alone saves this place. Otherwise, the service is horrendous! We went here for a friend's birthday, called in advance since there was a big group of us, and still had to wait an hour over the hour-long wait they quoted us. WE had about 3-4 different server exchanges during the dinner and nobody seemed to communicate with each other. Our dinner orders turned out fine, but dessert was another mess (took forever and then they brought out the wrong thing). But, man, that pizookie, esp the peanut butter one, is to die for...."
Deb B.,"South San Francisco, CA",6,115,20,3.0,12/16/2009,"We revisited BJ's last night and found it to be improved from our last few visits. The food was much better, and the beer was as good as ever. I would've given it four stars except for two important issues: 1) We were told we would be seated 30-40 mins upon check in. That was fine since we love their beer. 45 mins later we checked with the hostess and she said we had three people ahead of us. We were not seated for another 15 mins...so they were off by 30-20 mins and that's a bit much. 2) While waiting for our table we drank outside on a fairly cool evening. We asked twice to have the gas lanterns turned on for heat, and were told twice someone would be sent out. No one ever came until a bus boy cleaned up and we asked him to turn on the heaters. After starting to get warm our table was ready! My husband had a burger with avocado, bacon & pepper jack cheese. He liked it very much but commented the burger was skimpy on avocado. I had the scampi pasta with so much shrimp i was amazed! i only ate 1/3 of it and took 2/3 home. the garlic cheese bread was fantastic. we will come back again since this was a better experience."
Sonya T.,"San Francisco, CA",112,232,34,4.0,10/29/2005,"Despite the kinky name, this is a great place to eat.  I've been to 3 of them in the Bay Area and like them all.  They brew their own beer -- I tried one and it tasted good.  They are known for their Pizookie dessert, which is a gigantic cookie with ice cream on top."
D J.,"San Francisco, CA",13,247,3,4.0,3/25/2007,"This place is good for what it is. I usually am here later in the evening and reap the benefits of happy hour. I think it starts after 10pm. Dollar off beers and half price pizza. The pizza isn't that bad. They do have some good combinations for toppings. The service was prompt and friendly the few times I have been there. Good for a ""chain restaurant"" and I would be there everynight if it was closer to my house."
May A.,"CA, CA",59,188,,3.0,5/16/2007,We actually like the food here and the beer is awesome the onion appetizer is to die for but what we can't stand is the service.  We've been here enough times from the opening to current and still we can hit or miss with the service.
Jen P.,"South San Francisco, CA",64,279,3,3.0,7/18/2007,"mmmm....p'zookie.  i would come here just for that giant chocolate chip cookie served all warm & gooey with a scoop of ice cream.  just don't expect me to share! this place is okay.  i agree, a step up above tgif's but not that much higher.  your typical microbrewerie/pizza joint i guess.  yummy apps to start your meal like minced chicken/lettuce cup and spinach dip/chips.  personal size pizzas are also good, especially for the kiddies.  i like the selection of beers (i think it's the blondie that i usually order, i can't remember),  i keep meaning to come check out the happy hour specials but never make it!"
Jen Y.,"Oakland, CA",146,474,54,3.0,9/17/2007,"This place reminds me of Elephant Bar mixed with a sports bar. The food is not bad, not bad at all. The seats and booths are comfy. I like that I could watch Giants games on the huge tv screen while eating my meal. Completely satisfying. Great for a casual weekend lunch with the fam."
David M.,"San Francisco, CA",73,159,1,4.0,9/24/2007,"Everything is great except for their pizza in my opinion. There are many interesting styles available in regards of pizza, but not many are great combos. I rather order their other dishes, such as pot roast, salads, and sandwiches. Have fun with acouple of people sampling their own brews because some are quite good and flavorful. Try them out and while you wait for your seating go to barnes and noble next door."
Angela Y.,"Fremont, CA",36,253,22,4.0,12/22/2007,"The deep dish pizzas are delicious and loaded with toppings. The drink menu is creative and long. I hate the long line at the restaurant.  I would come here again if I have a reservation. However, the happy hour here is awesome and full of good times."
Cary W.,"San Jose, CA",29,196,26,3.0,7/22/2006,"Another company with SoCal roots, this location is popular during weekday lunches, and that's about the only time I'll go here. Not saying that the food or service is bad, but in the SF Bay Area, there are so many restaurants (including the taco trucks) to choose from, that why would you want to go to a cookie cutter chain? The food is dependable so if I'm taking a client out to a quick lunch in the South SF to Burlingame area, Elephant Bar or BJ's is the safe, quick choice. I do like their Pazookies. So really 3.5 stars then."
Jason C. J.,"San Francisco, CA",1500,983,612,4.0,5/2/2007,"The service isn't bad. Their drinks are good especially the ciders since their sweet and give off that buzz if you are getting away from a hard day's work. The food is pretty filling. If you love pizza, order the Great White. You'll love it!"
Stevezee C.,"Millbrae, CA",7,240,,4.0,7/22/2007,"I'm usually not a fan of chain but this is not bad.  The avocado egg rolls are crispy, soft in the middle and comes with sweet and sour sauce.  Its a little pricey but not bad.  The pizza is good enough but I'm not usually a fan of deep dish so I usually get one of the sandwiches.  I had p'zookie and it just too big but very good."
Tracy C.,"San Francisco, CA",6,11,,1.0,6/29/2009,"I came here for my Birthday with my parents.  We got a table pretty quick and after the waitress took our order, she disappeared.  Oh wait, she came back with our drinks, THEN disappeared.  In 45 minutes, no one had come to check on us or let us know the status of our meal. Didn't even refill the drinks.  They weren't even that busy! I was tempted to just walk out. THIS SUCKED.  So we finally get our food and our lovely waitress never said anything to any of the three waiters about my birthday. WHERE'S MY FREAKIN BIRTHDAY PAZOOKI?!? My mom tells one of the waiters again and they bring one out.  The waiter didn't seem to enjoy working there. I think he smiled once. The pazooki was good, but not worth the wait and lack of service. Never coming back to this BJs."
Tastebud S.,"Union City, CA",0,48,,1.0,3/18/2012,"Each and everytime I come here, whether a Tuesday afternoon, it seems to always be busy.  This business does not allow any reservation unless it's for a party of 9.  Well here is how I rate this business. It's based on location/parking, service, price, quality/taste of the food, cleanliness.  Alright here it is. Location/parking of course it's in the Tanforan Shopping Mall so parking is difficult.  I usually end up finding parking farther from the entrance and more closer to the El Camino Real street.  Service is like horrible. Waiter/waitress would try to be nice and friendly but getting them to come to your table once you have been seated takes another 10-15 minutes. So I would end up just placing all my orders and not try to order the drinks like they would normally do once they approach your table. And then the other thing was that it takes them 30 minutes to make Mac-N-Cheese for a child.  Now give me a break, it looks like the pre-packaged microwavable Mac-N-Cheese.  So why it took so long I could not tell you but I had to get the manager involve.  He too could not give me an answer as to why it took so long to get it ready, when I specifically as for it to brought to our table as soon as it was done because I had a child who was hungry. I did also mention that to them. But of course that didn't matter to there establishment.  So if you have a child who is diabetic, don't even try taking him/her here or otherwise they would end up in the hospital.  Price for what in on there menu is not at all worth the money.  I mean, come on, Mac-N-Cheeses is that even worth $6 or more?  It came slightly over microwaved because it was almost dried out of the cheese.  Quality/taste of the food, well as I mentioned already, it's not cracked up to be with what others have rated this business.  Cleanliness it one thing that is good which is why I give them this 1 star rating.  Sorry, for the being honest but I hate to read reviews and then finding out the opposite. Now other yelpers have given good ratings for a Pizookie.  Now it's not that great.  It's just a chocolate chip cookie with an ice-cream on top.  There is nothing special about that.  The twice that we have ordered this so-called pizookie, it was hard (over-cooked) cookie.  I could hardly cut it with a spoon or fork to give some to my son.  I can go on with food we have ordered that did not cut-it or even worth the time it took or the price for it.  So let's just say this is not something to brag about to someone because you might be looked upon that person as not having good taste for the right type of restaurant."
D R.,"San Carlos, CA",11,306,,1.0,5/22/2009,"This review is based on my one and only experience at any BJ's, granted this was awhile ago.  Went with some friends and we ordered a pizza.  The thing came and we are eating it and everyone is looking at each other, and finally someone copped to ""it's not cooked!"".  The dough was quite raw, despite the fact that from the top it looked ok.  So we sent it back, and the kicker is when they brought it back, it was still not cooked, still raw dough!  Yuck.  And they didn't really apologize or take it off the bill or anything.  Horrible."
Eazflo Z.,"Solano County, CA",21,245,,5.0,1/23/2008,"Yummy Yummy. I love BJs pizza. It is warm and thick it reminds me of the BEST version of round table if it was doing Chicago Style. Coming from Berkeley, people seem to push really crap pizza and call it good. NOT so at BJs it hits my pizza button right on! Plus, add the chopped salad and you can make a meal for 2 with a small pizza and be full."
vernice l.,"San Francisco, CA",6,152,,2.0,10/20/2006,"We decided to check this place out since we were out in the suburbs with two little kids.  One of the little girls wanted clam chowder in a bread bowl so this was the closest place.  We waited for about 35-45 minutes even though it was Thursday night.  I was not expecting much, but my dinner entree was not even hot.  I ordered the ribs and it was still cold. It took a long time for them to reheat it.  I had a little bit of the Cajun Pasta.  It tasted like something that could have been made at home.  My husband said his chicken fried steak was too dry.   I took a little bite of my friend's Chinese chicken salad and that tasted pretty good.  If you have to go to a chain out here, I would vote for Mimi's Cafe!!"
larry s.,"San Francisco, CA",6,117,25,3.0,10/21/2007,"well i have tried this place several times & come to the same conclusion.  the food here is decent but the service here is pretty mediocre.   the buffalo wings are pretty tasty, the mozzarella sticks are not good at all.  the burgers are pretty decent & made to order.  i agree with the other reviewers, pass on the pasta. all in all, its another option for a place to grab a bite to eat & hang out.  the food here is okay, pretty average nothing super special.  the restaurant can get quite busy so be prepared to wait, we came here for lunch with 5 people & did not have a long wait.  another time with came with a group of 10 people after a lion dance performance & we waited for about 45 minutes plus we could not get seated together.  however, they did give us these pager things to carry about, so we were able to walk about to kill time."
