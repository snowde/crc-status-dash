R A.,"Daly City, CA",7,18,1,4.0,10/27/2007,"I enjoy coming here for their pizza. But let it be known that their host staff are such air headed tards! One busy evening, my wife and I step up to the front counter and the hostess is talking to what I can only guess is her imaginary friend. Another gentlemen at the front counter (looks like one of the shift managers), grabs the hostess shoulder, and turns her around to face us....you know, the customers. My wife and I ask how long the wait is for two people; hostess says it will be around 50 to 55 minutes. I confirm with my wife, and we agree to wait it out - so the hostess takes my name. But then she tells me to come back in twenty minutes to get a pager, to which I acknowledge. Not more than 5 minutes later, my wife decides to ask for a pager, and voila! Pager available. So we're waiting in their establishment, because I never trust the true radius of those restaurant pagers, and lo and behold, two more hostesses appear and join the first one at the front counter. I swear it looked like a Jan Brady convention up front; only with the ditziness of younger sister Cindy. The shoot the breeze amongst themselves, as I watch customers walk in, stand for a good five to ten seconds before one of the Jans greets them. Either I was that bored to be easily amused, or they were so ridiculously moronic that I couldn't resist watching the live version of Dumb, Dumber, and Dumbest. OK, enough of the tards..... Our server was awesome! She was prompt, courteous, and sounded pleasant to talk with. Very professional indeed. Although we usually come for the pizza, we decided to go with the steak and potato dish. Good eating! The steak was prepared the way we like it (rare for me, medium for her), and the potato was more than filling! I suppose any Clam Chowder expert would say that the Chowdah isn't that great, but to my chowder loving taste buds, they were good enough to enjoy like any other. The establishment is similar to anything else like it (brewery), and that's just fine with me; it's what's expected."
Rebecca J.,"Nashville, TN",33,101,21,4.0,1/3/2008,"I really do love this place. Mainly because it reminds me a bit of the city in Texas I used to live in. Great atmosphere and known for their beer samplers, pizza, and lively bar with big screen TVs. I go for the blackened chicken baked potato."
Izzy L.,"Paris, France",282,9,7,1.0,10/9/2008,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. Justin, the manager of that place should be fired. We had a Corporate event for Bank of America and they told us that we would have to wait 2 hours on a WEDNESDAY NIGHT for 15 people around 700 pm. They wouldn't let us call it in. Then while we waited we could see empty tables but they told us that they were waiting for one table to leave. it was plain bull. After an hour and a half we asked if it there was a table available and they said, it has not been two hours yet. After two hours we asked and they said that a server had closed the back area so we couldn't sit there. WHAT????  So my manager went to the BJs manager and told him the situation and how we had been waiting for over 2 hours for nothing. His comment was, We quoted you two hours and it's been two hours with hella attitude. My manager got angry and said we were leaving. She was so disappointed because we all wanted to eat there and it was a complete waste of time. It was a going away party for 2 people and it was so embarrassing for her. We had spent so much money buying drinks and a couple of appetizers while we were standing around at the bar and waiting for two hours. What idiots!!! Did they not want our business??? After my manager told us what he said, he came over and said that they didn't have enough servers. We said that they could have at least had us sit down, because we didn't care if we waited. But he said, again, we quoted you two hours. We were like, WE KNOW but stop concentrating on what you said, the point is that you kept us waiting for nothing. Why would BJs keep a manager like that??? That is the fastest way to go out of business. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.  The waitresses are nice but they should get out of that place and go somewhere else. The hostesses were idiots. I could have done a much better job organizing it so people could sit down. If they dont' have staff then they shouldn't have a big restaurant. We will never bring them business or recommend them. Seriously, big and small parties, beware this location and this manager. Did I say how freaking horrible they were? HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only reason I'm giving them a one because one of the waitresses was really nice and tried to help us. she is the ONLY reason."
Mooky G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/25/2010,"I'm giving this place one star because the food isn't that bad, but i had such a negative experience with a server that i don't think i'll ever go back again. She was probably the rudest server i've ever encountered in my life. She reminded me a lot of Vagita..."
Andrew P.,"San Bruno, CA",0,34,,4.0,7/21/2008,"The bar is always busy, no matter what day Ive gone its been slammed at the bar. Nice tv's alright food there own beer selection, i liked the red and the stout. dont get angel hair pasta, horrible. pizza's are good though"
Spencer G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,7,,2.0,5/13/2008,"I would stay clear if I were you. When I go to eat I want to sit down order drinks, order food and then be served. The problem with this is at BJ's that isn't how it happens. It took over 20 minutes for us to get drinks, and another 50 to get our food. The food was good the deep dish pizza was delicious and everything was good but not worth the wait. When the waiter finally got around to asking us if we needed anything else I asked for a refill on my Root Beer (which they make there, very good). Took over 20 minutes and he brought it to us with the cheque. The total for the 6 of us was around $130. If you like to talk and socialize then this is the place for you if not bring a magazine."
Rico d.,"San Francisco, CA",41,9,,3.0,9/13/2007,"I agree with some of you folks out there.  It's typical bar food, but the Pazookie (chocolate chip pizza a la mode) is awesome!!!!!!  Fresh bake with either milk chocolate chip or white chocolate.  Hmm, Hmm, good!"
Lady K.,"San Francisco, CA",39,143,19,3.0,9/13/2007,"s'okay.   i dont know if its worth the wait, but HAPPY FACE FRIES PLS!"
Matt S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,84,2,4.0,2/19/2010,Cant go wrong with this place... Yeah its a chain but SO WHAT... The only thing bad about this one is the wait...
samer j.,"Millbrae, CA",0,11,4,2.0,2/4/2010,this place is always over packed and service sucks...when they 1st open they had great prices and now not as good...the good is that they are open late and have good beer
Scott R.,"San Mateo, CA",0,33,,1.0,9/4/2007,"The food is just barely passable, which entitles this chain that does not know how a one star rating from me.  Unfortunately (for me), three out of four times I have gone to BJs there has been a serious problem with service.  Either kitchen sends out someone else's food, ours never arrives or the server goes awol on a break or a shift change.  I was compelled to write this review after my four and last time (I swear) visit to this lousy chain restaurant. If you are going to do big box chain with the kids, do Cheese Factory as they most often times get it right.  Plus their food is far superior."
bruce h.,"San Francisco, CA",1,6,,4.0,3/15/2010,"I really like this place. Great atmosphere, nice and mellow, dark but not so much that you're tripping over people's feet. The food is great. If you haven't tried the honey mustard salad, then you honestly haven't lived. It's absolutely heavenly. The waiters are usually pretty nice, too. The only complaint is that the seating takes quite a while and it is a tad expensive, but otherwise, this place rocks."
Kim A.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,12,,1.0,12/20/2008,"We waited more than 35 minutes for our food. Our waiter didn't care nor did the entrance staff even after we brought their lack of service to their attention. We left. Horrible, horrible service. We intend to never visit any of these restaurants again."
amanda p.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/14/2011,"love the soup plain and simple, and the parm crusted chicken is the business"
Jeremy B.,"San Francisco, CA",375,45,99,4.0,2/10/2009,"bjs is pretty crackin. the prices are like and other chain. some of the beer are coo even though i dont really like beer. dereks meatloaf sandwich is the bomb and the cookies and cream pazookie is hella good too, but usually im too full to get one. oh and if ur gonna get a mixed drink try the poison caramel apple (HELLA GOOD)"
M.E. W.,"Lynnwood, WA",24,44,27,2.0,8/16/2008,"I had some pretty good food here, the waitress was nice, but we had a really crappy experience with the hostess. We showed up and nobody was waiting for a table but us. We asked how long the wait was and tney said 10-20 minutes. We said ok, and wandered over to the bar area to see if there was anywhere to sit there. There wasn't, so we came back and sat down on a bench in front of the host area. We sat there and waited for about 15 minutes and noticed a lot of people coming in and being seated. Then we noticed that they all had pagers. One of our party went up and asked the hostess how much longer it would be. Apparently we weren't even on the list because ""we walked away"". We had been sitting there in full view of the hostess the whole time. The bench we were on is no more than five feet away from the desk and there was nobody else sitting there or standing in that area but us. She gave us a pager and made us wait 10 more minutes, and she kept giving us dirty looks the whole time. I don't think I'll be going back."
kimberly m.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,,5.0,11/13/2009,This is my FAVORITE place to go to watch a sporting game. The only bad thing is it is ALWAYS packed but I guess that it just because it is SO GOOD. Their wings and potato skins are my favorite. If I can I like to sit by the bar so I do not have to wait for a table. I have always had the BEST customer service when I have eaten here. I will def. come back here as much as possible. I think they need to open a restaurant in SF so I dont have to drive as far.
Kevin S.,"San Francisco, CA",405,1595,278,3.0,1/26/2006,"Jeezuz, what happens when you work in a place like this?  Do you lose your sense of smell?!  You can't tell that one of your bussers is running around with a nasty, sour old dishrag wiping off people's tables and stanking up the place?  PLEASE.  Wash the damn things out with hot water and let them dry.  This is pretty basic!  Wipe off the tables so there is no food residue!  It's not that hard!  A powerful sour dishrag smell nearly flattened my party of four coworkers on our way in here.  Not promising.  And I'm afraid this place lived up to its lack of promise.  Very uneven food--my sourdough (hmmm--sourdishrag?) burger was tasty but way over-lettuced (that shredded, rapid-composting kind of lettuce), while my friend's clam chowder was bland and his salad unappetizing.  Another companion's Asian chicken salad was much zestier.  My iced tea was cloudy and more or less flavorless, and sugar was not to be found to sweeten it up.  The service was scattershot.  It's a cavernous space but seems like it has too few seats for the size of the place.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  I doubt I'll be back, it's just not worth dealing with the mallish crush."
Ezzie M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,46,2,1.0,8/4/2008,If I could give no stars I would!!!!! The service is the WORST.  Get a table right away ... wait 45 minutes only to have a manager to tell me our order was NOT entered. What the Hell is that lame ish?????  This place has the worst staff ever.  How lame can you be NOT to walk over the machine and enter in a pizza and pasta?  Isn't that what you are suppose to do after you take someones order?!  Unprofessional - both server and manager.
Shauna L.,"San Francisco, CA",237,100,275,3.0,3/14/2009,it's ight!!! id honestly rather come here to drink rather then eat.. food is okay.. typical american food
