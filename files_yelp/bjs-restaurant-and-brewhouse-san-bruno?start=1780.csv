Martin G.,"South San Francisco, CA",307,198,17,1.0,8/7/2008,"I have had back to back  bad times at this place!!!!! we went at 3pm one day and it was very slow there. we got seated right away, the waitress took our oreder and off she went, My one year old was fine playing and looking at the people around us. we orderd wings, a pasta plate and a kids pizza. 20 mins go by and no food, people were getting seating around us and there food would come right out, when I asked the waitress what was going on she just walked away. At this point my son is crying he is hungry and bored of sitting there. they bring us the food and it is all cold. I as for the manager, and so when we got the manager, he gave us a complementary courtesy card worth $25. Then he even has them bring us a new meal to go. That was fine we go back two weeks later and the same thing happend again this time with the manager giving us two 25 gift cards I say now thanks and walked out. I will not stepping into that place again!!!"
Maya L.,"San Francisco, CA",106,97,10,1.0,3/13/2007,"My first time here was my first and my last. We went on a Thursday night and the place was packed. I approached the counter and asked for a table for 2. The hostess told me to come back in 10 minutes for a beeper and she took down my name. We went and came back. I asked and there were beepers yet..10 more minutes. My date and I sat for a good 30 minutes (lucky we had good conversation) when I look over at the hostess podium and she is there giving out beepers and buzzing people in. The kicker came when I saw people who came in after us get a beeper right away...I got pissed and went you to the podium and with an attitude (yes, its been 45 minutes at this point), I ask, ""Where's a beeper???"" She gives a funny nervous laugh and goes, ""oh yeah here"". So then we waited another 10 minutes after getting the beeper to be seated. The food was unimpressive and you could get better food anywhere else in the area. The girl who waited on us was sweet but seemed like it was her first day as a waitress and was so nervous. She was nice though and is the only reason I'm giving this place one star as opposed to none."
Ryan F.,"San Francisco, CA",3,27,4,1.0,5/18/2013,"me my mom and my two aunties went there yesterday around 3pm. from the host down to the table and server was so nice... food is great... but the server is not honest.... after we order pizza bj's favorite, 2 pasta the chicken alfredo and scampi pasta, beers, soda and tea. my mom paid everything in cash about $90 something and we saw that... the server even opened the check book. then my mom decided to order again in a different check, 2 beers and one spicy wings w/c cost only 16 dollars including tax. after that they charge my mom $105 something.... and we called the manager in regards of the issue being double charge w/c we already paid off the first check w/c about 90 something... the manager talked to the server and the server denied that we did not pay him for our first check. i told the manager if he can review the camera coz the server is lying... as a resolved the manager gave us a gift card... and the manager apologies but the server did not even showed up and talk to us in regards of the issue...  the server is a liar!  that makes the restaurant bad... and i will not go back to that restaurant anymore... instead of giving us the money back for the first charge since they charge us double... they gave us a gift card! what a stupid idea! the server already took the money and bj;s will give us a gift card? its not right! i dont even want to accept the gift card! but since thatbi dont wanna argue in regards of money we let it go!...."
homer S.,"Brentwood, CA",0,35,2,1.0,7/9/2008,"pasta was too cheesy, pizza too oily, cabbage salad was mostly fried strips, and beer was sub-par but cheap. So if for any reason to go it's at the mall and there is cheap beer."
carebear l.,"San Francisco, CA",16,147,15,2.0,8/11/2007,"What I like about this place is that it can accommodate a large group. We had a group of about 9 people with no reservations. We had to wait about 15 to 20 minutes. We went to the bar and had some house beers. I had the blonde beer and it was pretty comparable to a Heifenweizen. When we were seated, the waiter introduced himself promptly. We all ordered from the menu and the food came promptly. I ordered the sliders, they were decent but would have been better if the patty was the actual size of the bun. Yes, the patty to bun ratio was not good. I also asked if the patty could be cooked medium rare. I thought it was a reasonable request. I mean it's a little patty, which doesn't take long to cook anyway and when I asked if it could be cooked medium rare the waiter said the chef usually cooks it well, but he'll write it down that I wanted the patty med. rare. Well, needless to say, the sliders did not come med. rare. My bf ordered the roasted chicken and ribs combo. The chicken was a little dry and the ribs were too. All in all the atmosphere is fun, but the food is nothing to brag about. I would come here with a big group again, not for the food, but for the atmosphere. There is outside seating, which would be good for a big group on a beautiful night."
Rick H.,"Oakland, CA",401,1285,1012,4.0,11/27/2005,"This is indeed an exciting development and welcome addition to the northern Peninsula area, as there are few (if any) large-format microbrew restaurants here.  The interior decor is as you'd expect from a suburban microbrewery-sports pub: a wide open space with gaudy colorful murals, lots of roomy booths, a long bar, numerous flat screen plasma tv's lining all the walls playing a variety of sports events and an overall brassy finish.  The place has a few flaws as pointed out by family members, never one's to keep our opinions a secret.  It was duly noted by my cousin that the place had an obvious draft due to the proximity between the front doors and dining floor, the server had to be asked for beverage refills, it was quite boisterous and loud, and the chairs were slippery (hey, don't shoot the messenger).  Nonetheless, the hot roast beef dip, sourdough burger with bacon and cheddar, and the seasoned wedge fries (""broasted"", according to my uncle) were all very tasty.  (And no, I didn't order two sandwiches, my mom and I traded halves.)"
Tracy P.,"San Francisco, CA",64,62,17,5.0,11/26/2006,My favorite happy hour place. Jeramiah Red rocks and the I love their Cobb Salad.
D C.,"Daly City, CA",157,85,8,1.0,10/24/2007,"The service was horrible & the food similar.  I've gone to the one in S. Cal 2x and had exceptional service, plus food was decent.  We were a party of 5 during lunch time enjoying the 84 degree weather outside seating.  Our server took a long time to get to us (most of the lunchtime crowd already gone), take our order, get our crummy food out (my goddaughter never got her food even after she said she'd check on it), get the bill.  I had gone to the bathroom 2x (lots of water) and there were plenty of servers chit chattin and standing around.  When we finally got our salads we didn't get any utensils, so I got some for us. My half sandwich would've been great had they not served it on bread that sucked the saliva out of me.  2 of my cousins got the same, but different sandwiches and neither of them ate 1/4 of it.  The only thing that seemed to be a hit were the sliders.  Don't come here...we live in an area where there are lovely places to enjoy a solid meal!"
Steven O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,712,1,3.0,1/31/2009,"Yummy Chicago style pizza and potato skins that hit the spot everytime.  The wait for a table can be a bit long but worth it when you're craving deep dish pizza.  The service can also be a lot better...noticed a couple that got seated at the same time as us and still hadn't ordered while our food was coming out...needless to say, they left."
Philipp S.,"San Carlos, CA",3,27,6,4.0,6/11/2007,"food was good, love the steak, long wait is the problem, tho they have heat lamps outside, so its ok"
Marc A.,"San Francisco, CA",35,69,,2.0,7/8/2008,come here a lot because it's close to work and open late every night.  good place to have some drinks although the food is mediocre kind of on the same level as tgi friday's.  try the chicken lettuce wraps with the wasabe hot sauce!  the service is also something that needs improvement otherwise a good casual dining environment
Jonathon C.,"San Francisco, CA",29,92,47,3.0,6/1/2008,this place is great if you go to the bar area. the food is alright but nothing to be excited about. i just enjoy trying out their different variety of beers and catching up with friends there. its always a great atmosphere but sometimes its got its quirks on certain days like bad service or dirty glasses which is common anywhere. the dirty glasses seem to be frequent though so minus one star for that and the service isn't always great so another minus star for that.
Steve K.,"San Francisco, CA",91,142,1,3.0,8/30/2007,"I gotta give this place no more than 3 stars. Don't get me wrong, cool place, spacious, nice booths...but it's very ""chainy"" and the wait staff has a high turnover and service is only mediocre. But ups for their halibut fish tacos, they are SCREAMING (but over-priced at $9.25)...Beer's good too and pluses for the 48 tvs in the place."
elmer d.,"Daly City, CA",62,170,,1.0,12/26/2007,its jus a place to be seen~no one here knows whats goin on in sports~its a hang out~it figures its south city & no one here is into sports...all this bar has to do is turn up the freakin volume!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....numerous tv's....but no sound....get a clue~its a sports bar....this place would make sooo much money & maybe compete with knuckles....but no sound....ruins the whole experience
KC F.,"San Francisco, CA",1,12,1,3.0,1/2/2011,decent food and service. only been here a few times and it was because it was with a group. there is usually a wait time and i am not sure if it is worth it. the pizza here is ok and the sandwiches here are decent. it can get a little pricey but not too bad.
BENITA L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,2,,1.0,10/30/2010,"DO NOT COME HERE ESPECIALLY DURING THE WORLD SERIES.  why are giants fans coming here for the games?  to watch and LISTEN to the game on all the TVs that you have placed all around the restaurant. last night EVERYBODY who came to BJs was there for the game (and certainly not for their overpriced skimpy-azz mediocre portions of apps). even after several attempts by various patrons pleaded with the manager, jeff, to turn the volume on (it was only on low in the bar area), he REFUSED to do it claiming it's not their policy. ok, then why was it on the previous saturday during the giants clinch w/phillies? if i had known that, i mosdef would not have wasted my time going there again. we were all there to cheer on our team. we're not deaf!!!  come on, BJs, get with the program!!!  this is our Giants in the World Series; doesn't happen every day; make an exception to your dumb rules.  none of my friends nor i will ever set foot into that dump again!!!! no stars for u!!!!"
Nelle A.,"Burlingame, CA",216,389,23,4.0,7/25/2006,"definitely way better than chili's and tgif. they have delicious thick crust pizza, nice, crispy, delicious salads, their nachos are tasty and best of all they brew their own beer."
Stephanie C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",11,54,3,4.0,3/27/2006,"Love love love this place!  I missed this place from when I lived in Southern California, and then I would made the trek down to the Cupertino location, so I was very happy when this one opened up in San Bruno.  My favorite thing to eat here is the pizookie - a deep dish cookie, served warm in its mini-pie tin, with a scoop of ice cream on top.  So simple, yet so delightful!   I have converted many people to the pizookie worship cult.  My strategy is to get a pizookie as an appetizer, because the worst thing is to run out of stomach room and not be able to get one as dessert!  I'd like to think that I am responsible for the restaurant deciding to place the item on its appetizer menu.  Go me!  Oh, the rest of the food is really good too.  The atmosphere is fun too - lots of spacious seating, high ceilings, sports on TVs everywhere.  My only complaint about this particular location is that it gets too packed.  But what can you do?  When a place is good people want to eat there, and I don't blame them.  Just grab beers while waiting at the bar."
J C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,35,,1.0,11/15/2009,"First, their hostess was rude and sorry to say but stupid. She treated everyone who was waiting for a table like they're bugging her while she stands there doing nothing. We waited our turn while she tells everyone where they should stand. Maybe she's having a bad day but whatever. Then we got seated, waited 30 minutes and no one ever came to tell us thst someone will be with us or what we wanted to drink. We stayed calm and looked around. Everyone who got seated after us already have water. The server saw us but never acknowledged us. It's just water we thought maybe we'll be next but hey no luck. Finally who the hell wants to wait an hour to just get water or be acknowledge that someone will be with us. All these time we asked ourselves if we did anything wrong but we didn't, we waited our turn, when we got seated we said thank you and that was the last conversation we had with someone who works there. IF A MANAGER OR WORKER IS READING THIS SERIOUSLY YOU GUYS NEED TO DEVELOP SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. We finally walked out and went to red lobster and even though they were busy we got seated fast, server acknowledged us that we'll be next and we had a great lunch. Thank God for red lobster."
Michael S.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,38,,4.0,12/30/2008,"Cool atmosphere!!! Nice place to meet friends or have a business lunch meeting. Service can be slow at times, but definitely improving. I love their salads."
