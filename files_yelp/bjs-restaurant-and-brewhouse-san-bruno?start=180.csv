Iishia S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/22/2017,"The service was horrible, they didn't bring me one of our side dishes. Rude waitress with no customer service skills."
Jeannette F.,"South San Francisco, CA",24,44,4,5.0,3/13/2017,"I love it here! I've been a regular here for5 years. I eat here several times a week. I love the soups and salads. I have my own menu item: ""Jeannette bread"". The staff is wonderful and welcoming. It's like being Norm at Cheers. Eugene, the manager, is a wonderful guy."
Fred H.,"San Bruno, CA",2,22,2,1.0,2/11/2017,"2-10-2017 Back again.  What a horrible experience.....waited forever to get seated (no reservations allowed).  Between the drinks being wrong, the food delivery staggered and overall, taking forever, good bye BJ's.....what a mess, bigly. I love this place.   Wonderful atmosphere, the food is top drawer, and the service is crisp.   So, why two stars?  Got my salad, my wine and then into the twilight zone.  No food, then, no food, then, no food, then I complained, then, food. I don't know who is responsible for the kitchen but they need to be fired or given additional training. The place wasn't particularly busy, but the wait for food was eternal.   So, good service, good food and a most unpleasant dining experience.  Hoping that tonight was a glitch, I will go there again. I love this place."
M M.,"Daly City, CA",12,10,27,2.0,6/16/2016,"The ahi poke is something that I hold true in my heart, of course Hawaii has the best poke and I'm sure some fancy restaurants carry the best but hear me out!! Bjs in San Bruno was one of my go to places ahi poke places, everytime I would order it would come with a mountain of fresh red tuna, w avocado and poke sauce. It was heaven! And then the fairytale ended, my family and I celebrated Mother's Day at Bjs. Obviously I ordered the ahi poke, when it came out it was light pink almost brown, there was less fish, and it was cut horribly!  It looked like the chef just threw it on my plate! I asked my server why it looked like that and asked for a new one. He said it was because they had a new ""salad guy"". I got my new one, it looked the same, whatever I ate it.  A couple weeks later, I came back and ordered the same thing. It looked like the same thing, but this time, they put less fish! Wtf. I sent it back and ordered something else.  BJS PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD ""salad guy""   I used to love your ahi poke."
Charlotte T.,"San Francisco, CA",3,12,8,1.0,3/26/2017,"I've worked in the food industry for almost 20+ years there's no reason why a server should lie and say he's leaving and someone else is taking over and don't introduce them on top of that he was still there. Fire and hire new staff past and present if BJ's General Manager don't get it together the restaurant will close. Hire me I'll have the best team, bring revenue, and great food in 2 weeks flat. It's just said that an establishment that stays open till 1am don't have people lined up outside."
Shira S.,"San Francisco, CA",65,17,8,1.0,12/10/2016,"I came here after shopping with my mom and dad. We have come a few times before (maybe 3-4 times), years ago, and we remembered enjoying it. Sure, it wasn't AMAZING but we didn't really have any complaints.  After come here today, we will not go back. You're better off going to the food court. After entering we should have left. There was a smell of grease and fish (not fresh fish, which I can handle, but almost an unclean, old fishy smell that turns you off food). We ordered a tea and coffee first (both were lackluster in taste - quite frankly the worst coffee ive had). Granted they are not particularly known for tea/coffee, it just was bad.  All three of us ordered burgers. My dad got the bison burger(comes with coleslaw) and my mother and I both got the bacon cheese burger (comes with fries). Immediately upon seeing our dish come, we noticed how greasy the fries were. Little did we know, the fries were the best part (and they were pretty bad).  The burgers were cold. Like... barely warm cold. Tr buns were cheap, not very tasty. The beef was eh, theyre a decent size but lack flavor. They dont skimp on the lettuce, tomato and pickles which I guess is good? My mom only took two bites. We should have sent them back but didnt want to make a fuss (though given the price for cold food...).  Maybe it was an off day, but given the other reviews, I doubt it."
Celine K.,"Daly City, CA",0,7,1,5.0,9/20/2016,"Awesome experience. The place had a buzzing atmosphere and busy, probbably what you'd expect from a Sunday night. The food was perfect, modest portions and speedy service which always makes for a better evening. While enjoying our food we met the manager Debbie young and super sweet woman. Debbie was spot on all night long, let us take our time looking over the menu, answered all questions quickly and well and was very complimentary towards everything . Ambiance at this local is pleasant, noise level is average, staff seems very efficient) food was good, prices decent. All in all, a very good dining experience and we will return."
Nataly B.,"Charlotte, NC",27,11,,1.0,6/27/2017,"We were seated fairly quickly however our server didn't show right away.  Meanwhile we looked at the menu decided what we were going to order and yet no server. Once he arrived (15 minutes after being seated) we orders our drinks and right away we order appetizers and our meals. After our order was placed we waited 10 additional minutes for our drinks. We got our soup (which was cold) before appetizers. Once  our appetizers arrived we got our main course about 15 minutes later. We had asked our waiter for refills and he forgot! He laughed and walked away. Didn't bring our drinks. When we saw him again we asked once again for our refills which he replied ""oh yeah right"".  Given our experience we will not be returning to this establishment."
Danika S.,"South San Francisco, CA",3,10,3,1.0,10/2/2017,I only go here because I live by this bjs and I LOVE this place but lately there service hasn't been up to par .. the service is not good at all anymore and hasn't been for a very long time . I see new people every time I do decide to come here and they're either looking like it's the worst job ever or they're nice but still look lost . Just a couple of random things to throw out there I took my husband and mother in law out for lunch here (cause I haven't been here for a while) and the guy that helped us was really nice but seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . I brushed it off . We've all been there before especially if were new to a job . I ordered a sunset peach tea and it taste like regular unsweetened black tea . I asked for another one and I got a unsweetened black tea . Then a female waitress said they're really similar in taste . Like no there not . Black tea and sweet are two different things when it comes to taste . Trust me I drink tea everyday lol (I know it's bad) but rewind . I didn't even finish my order and our waiter was just chit chatting like there was no tomorrow  I mean I know we like to talk to our Co workers here and there but sheesh there's a time and place for that and that wasn't the time . I asked for a house salad and a different waiter just tossed it on the table and left . Like I didn't even know who it was it was so fast . My salad look like I could've just got a bag of salad from Lucky and made it myself . I'm not asking for a gourmet salad but really? I have very good long time experience in customer service . I get it there's days where we're like f*** it but what I like to do is to always tell myself 'put yourself in the customers shoes' and even though some customers can be whack you gotta be the stronger person and just handle it . If you can't do that you shouldn't be dealing with customers at all . I even asked for a manager about 4 times and still NONE . I decided to be one of those customers and call the next day . I don't want any free stuff or discounts I just wanna have a good time with my family the next time I go there without any problems concerning the staff . Whoever is the manager really needs to retrain the staff or get experienced people . - rant over lol
Hayley H.,"Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, CA",162,33,21,4.0,9/11/2016,Came in for a late night nite and they're open until 1am! Found a seat in the bar right when we walked in and ordered the Seared ahi salad and artichoke dip. The salad was delicious! Waitstaff was very kind and efficient! Come here for a beer and food for your late night munchies
Stefanie D.,"Millbrae, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2016,"I had a HORRIBLE take out experience this evening. I ordered food in advance (by 2 hours) on line to be picked up at 5:15pm. My husband and 4 year old went to pick the food up and arrived a few minutes before it was meant to be picked up.  The man at the pick up counter, Ernest L., went to check on the food in the back, came back, and told my husband it wasn't ready. That was it. No other explanation. So my husband asked if he knew an ETA? He said no. And then he continued to help numerous others who went to the counter to pick up their food. My husband stayed near the counter while Ernest would look up at him occasionally.  Forty five minutes later, my husband asked again where the food was. He was told it was ready, but they were still waiting for the beignet and ice cream. Seriously?!? The food was cooked at 4:55pm, and my husband hadn't received the food until 6:00pm. By the time we ate it was cold. The fries were soggy. I didn't get the honey mustard I asked for, and one of the items I ordered with my beignet was absent. This was an inexcusable experience with Ernest being a real joke. Never again will we be going to the San Bruno location, and I suggest others do the same since they obviously don't care about their customers."
Luke Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",20,76,9,1.0,11/28/2016,"I love eating at BJ's restaurants and stop at this location when I'm in town. This place isn't warm n cozy like others. Their front staff/ host are always looking unhappy. The food doesn't taste great like other locations.  The veggies still had dirt from the field on it, when I told the lady she just threw it away.  But that's all I have to say!"
Natalie C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,5,3.0,6/18/2017,"Oh BJ's.  You are one hot mess.  My boyfriend and sat on the patio today to enjoy the weather.  We witnessed 2 hours of wrong orders, dirty glasses, waiters who didn't know the menu, and all sorts of shenanigans that had us just laughing by the end at the circus that was the staff.  This was a repeat performance of the other time we've been here.  Upside?  We got to know the other restaurant patrons who were just as disappointed/entertained as we were."
Star_smog T.,"South San Francisco, CA",38,4,10,5.0,2/11/2017,Very nice place. My wife and I went there few days ago. We had a great time and delicious food. Price wise is average. I strongly recommend a place for a good date.
Lauren C.,"Alhambra, CA",317,27,40,2.0,3/22/2016,"This seems to be the go to place whenever we have large parties to feed. The portions are big and there's a wide selection for food. We almost always have left overs which is great for a midnight snack. I especially love getting their burgers with fries. My favorite is the guacamole burger. It's so filling and their fries are always so crispy and golden.  For appetizers, I love their avocado eggrolls and lettuce wraps. I'm hooked on those two dishes. Lastly, let's not forget about the pazookie! If you've never had one before, it's basically a freshly baked cookie topped off with icecream. I feel like it's a tradition to get a pazookie with every visit. If you're with a couple friens, I'd recommend the Pizookie Trio because then you get to three different pazookies instead of one.  Whenever I'm here, the service is great. I've had some bad experiences in other restaurants where waiters were inattentive and didn't want to deal with such a large group but not at BJ's. Our waiters were always coming in to check up on us and refill our water. I realize it's hard dealing with more than 20 people so I appreciate that they were extremely nice and organized with our party.  The reason for my low review isn't the food but the cleanliness of the utensils and tables. I wish I had more pictures from past experiences but a majority of the times that I have come, I have had to flag down a waiter because there's stains on our utensils or lipstick on the cups.  It's made me extremely paranoid every time I come here. The last time I came, I was about to dip my spoon into my soup when I realized there was some weird red gunk on it. Then I realized it was on some of my other utensils too. I think I'm just unlucky every time I come here, but also I really do hope that the staff double check their utensils before they give them out to customers."
C. T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,255,,2.0,6/30/2017,"If this bar/restaurant wishes to get beyond a 2 1/2 * rating overall then they ought to take seriously the complaints & actually do something about the problems.  But apparently nothing changes to improve. Why on a weekday with a number of servers walking the floor were patrons forced to wait 20-25 minutes to be seated?  Especially when there were empty booths to one side & later on they accommodated others.  Even the 'hostess' was unfriendly & indifferent.  But overall our server was all right.  It's just that the timing of our orders were just questionable:  Appetizer arrived with the main, drinks took forever to reclaim from the bar, and dessert was even tardy.  Of course, our server apologized profusely for the delays, but this should not even occur.   The food was okay nothing outstanding.  The fried calamari looked great, but it was disappointing that the batter was not crispy.  And the presentation of some of the meals was just not appealing.  For instance, the fish and chips was plated in a metal tray.  Others were plated on wares.  I just do not get the metal tray choice as it looks terrible like if it's a huge TV dinner container or something an institution would provide its inhabitants; it certainly does not belong in a restaurant. At least the cocktails were pleasant. All in all this revisit was just all right.  We would not purposely dine here again unless as in this instance it's for convenience."
Max B.,"San Bruno, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/14/2017,Excellent experience again at BjS . Our bartenders ray and Vicky were so great. My Moscow mule was fantastic and they made my time drinking with my mother very fun.
Justin J.,"Daly City, CA",534,8,6,2.0,11/12/2016,"I don't have high expectations when I go to BJ's. I love the traditional wings and for the most part that's one thing I can order that consistently comes out the same. This last visit I decided on starting with a different appetizer.... disaster. I ordered spinach stuffed mushrooms,... kinda. What came out barely resembled what I thought I was getting. These were mushrooms the way raisins are grapes. The service was good, but the food was so disappointing, even the wings couldn't save this trip. It was pretty sad, reminded me of how I felt after hearing the election results this year."
Ximena C.,"Daly City, CA",11,33,19,2.0,4/24/2017,"A manager named Eugene reached out to me to apologize which I really appreciated. He really owned the negative experiences and assured me that he would hold his staff accountable. Really, the only way to see if he's sincere is to give the place another try, which I may. For his follow up, I give them back a star."
Ed H.,"San Francisco, CA",47,17,,1.0,8/13/2017,What happened to this place?!?! I used to like coming here because the service was good and the food quality was good.  Now it seems like no one wants to work here and the food quality has gone down. I had to ask 3 different people for condiments and of course only 1 brought them after 15 minutes. I also ordered a Caeser salad with extra croutons and dressing.  Come with neither.  Had to ask for the croutons and dressing 2 times and they made it feel like I was bothering them and it was my fault.  Looks like BJ's is going the way of Elephant Bar that was at Serramonte.  Never coming back.  Paid $50 for lousy service and food!!!
