Barn M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,274,,4.0,5/11/2008,"I thought this place is nice for a weekend dinner.  The wait is usually not too long, and the place has a nice vibe to it, without being too noisy.  The food is nothing exceptional, but usually great, and the portions are sizeable, which is important for me."
Fresca T.,"Chicago, IL",19,38,,3.0,1/18/2008,"Never...ever....EVER order the pasta here. Don't order any pasta. You may end up sick. Otherwise, I am a fan of the open face burgers and pizoooookies. Yum."
Miss D.,"San Francisco, CA",3,70,,2.0,7/30/2008,"The past three times in a row that I've eaten here, I've found ""metal stuff"" in my food. Next time you eat here you should watch what you put in your mouth because you never know what you could be swallowing, especially if you order pasta. Besides that, the desert is wonderful. I love the p'zookie and the pizza."
Coco C.,"Daly City, CA",209,116,2,3.0,7/2/2007,"i dont get all the hype. my friends love this place! but somehow, i dont find it as appealing as they do. the foods good. ok good, not HELLA good. the root beer is HELLA good. service is pretty good, waiters are nice. its an ok place."
Johnny O.,"San Francisco, CA",103,285,55,3.0,10/31/2005,"Perhaps I expected a little bit too much from this place since my friend really talked up the pizza, but I was not impressed. I usually don't go for deep dish pizza, but if that's your thing I think you would do better with Zachary's in Berkeley, or any Uno's. Not bad, just not that good. Crust was so soft, it was almost the consistency of Wonder Bread. Other than the pizza, the rest of the meal was ""too""...That is, the jambolaya was too salty and too mild, the rice too soft, the strawberry lemonade too sweet. However, the service from everyone was really great. TIP: The signal on the pager they give you while you wait for your table will reach all the way to the Barnes and Noble magazine section, so read on. Overall, there are just too many better choices in SF, or Walnut Creek, or Berkeley for me. If you are stuck in SSF, then I can see the appeal. Sad to say, but probably one of the better restaurants in South City. I will go back when...honestly, I can't envision a scenario in which I would go back."
Chanel C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,15,,4.0,8/13/2008,"i love BJ'S! me and my boyfriend always dinner at this place .. its like one of our fav ! haha their Avocado Egg Rolls, Chips& Salsa are really good &which we will orders every time we dinner there."
mel t.,"San Bruno, CA",16,58,6,3.0,7/27/2007,"it's a running joke with my friends and family that your order never comes out right the first time at bj's tanforan. we still go for the ok food and convenience of location. all the appetizers are great. the service is just so-so. i only gave it 3 stars, but i'm sure i'll eat there tommorrow, in the hopes that my order comes out right. *crossing fingers*"
Sloane G.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,115,10,3.0,10/2/2007,"yea i agree it is a ""comfort food"" chain...but i've heard that the house ales are pretty darn good and theres this sampler thing you can get and sample all the drafts they have, which is pretty cool.  the portion sizes are rediculously massive. i got a half a baked potato with the fixin's and i  could barely get through half of that! We were there during the lunch tie too! so that means that if i ordered that during dinner , it wouldve been double that!! craaazy big portions, i guess i'm used to the smaller foreign food portions in san francisco.  other than that its a fun and different resturant than the small ones here in the city.  i plan on coming back probably somtime when we cant decide on what we feel like eating. lol...this is a good default resturaunt"
erick m.,"San Francisco, CA",6,15,,3.0,8/12/2007,"so its a Friday and you say ya don't have anything to do? go to bjs. sweet pig pizza, and a pitcher of their hef, and its a wrap."
Fred P.,"Redwood City, CA",2,14,,3.0,3/25/2008,"My first experience with BJ's was when my kids bought me a t-shirt that had their logo on it....my mind wonder at what it stood for?...the mall at Tanforan was being remodeled and soon a sign came up that BJ's was coming in as a local brewery/eatery.  What was my impression?  A sort of bland place at a mall to have ok food, their menu is very extensive, but some how it all tastes pretty much the same.  The brews were all microbrewed but not at the San Bruno location, they have them shipped from Rocklin, CA and besides the stout and blonde, I've found the rest to have that blandish taste, no real character out of their beers.  Passable, but not my first choice, however, the appetizer menu does have some gems, like the thin crust pizza or the pot-stickers are great, one time I wanted buffalo wings, but they were not on menu, the bartender got them to make them for me for the same cost....now that is cool.  Overall, I like the place its bland etc, but ok to go and watch sports while the family is shopping at the mall.  I also frequent the one in Foster City and feel the same.  So that tells me they are consistent with blandness....but still a good place to kick back and accept suburbia..........where are my sketchers.....and my anarchist shirt I bought at HotTopics?"
Maureen D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,,4.0,2/11/2008,"Been here twice now, be warned portions are massive! If you're thinking of having appetizer first you may want to split it! Tasty food both times, great service, had a 20 minute wait roughly which isn't bad, guess they must be doing something right eh! Knocked one star off because music is a little too loud 4 a restaurant. Apart from that no other probs, will go back!"
Christa J.,"San Francisco, CA",20,58,18,1.0,12/13/2007,never eat here! waste of time and money. food and service sucks.
