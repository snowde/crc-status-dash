Monica M.,"Millbrae, CA",0,17,5,1.0,5/7/2017,"Super inconsistent. The servings are definitely not worth the money. If you are taking out to go, you are more than guaranteed to be skimped. If you get a soup, be aware that you are paying $6.75 for less than half of the cup that they serve it in, literally 4 scoops and your $7 soup is done. Unless you get the bread bowl, even then they don't fill up the cup all the way. Obviously to worried about losing money but I mean they definitely are because they just lost another customer."
Osi F.,"Daly City, CA",27,47,15,1.0,11/29/2015,It's ok place we got the table . Table is not clean no plates and no forks  The serve the food and after that they provide plate and silverware. Don't like it at all !!!!
Dawne L.,"San Diego, CA",375,250,4011,1.0,10/21/2014,"I've had a few work lunches here, but it's really more out of convenience then service or selection. However, our last lunch really pushed me to write this review.  We made reservations for a big group for lunch hour and they sat us in the back. Ok-- that's good, some privacy for our team. Although that quickly turned more into neglect as we barely saw our server. When we did catch her, it was to remind her that 2 people have yet to get their food after 40 minutes of waiting as others finished their meal.  Apparently, one of the dishes met an unfortunate accident. But as for the other one, she just totally missed. The manager did comp my friend a salad, but at that point, he was too hungry to care. Oh, and the ""reserved"" back seats were dirty when we got there -- I have pizza stain on my backside as proof.  Crossing this off from our work lunch list!"
Md G.,"San Bruno, CA",0,31,2,2.0,9/3/2017,"This is a tip regarding the enlightened cauliflower tacos: Don't. I like cauliflower, but it really doesn't work as a taco filling in these. The pita was fine as a substitute for the tortilla and the other taco fillings were fine, but the taco-seasoned cauliflower? Nope. Also, this is served with ""seasonal bistro grains"" which turned out to be plain brown rice. Plain. Brown. Rice.  There is some good stuff on the menu. Order something else."
Alireza G.,"Alcova, WY",3,12,2,1.0,2/3/2017,"This place ruined bj's for me forever.  1. The wait was 1.5 hours when they said it was 30 min. 2. The hostess just looked at our group and didn't say a word and expected us to read her mind. We didn't even know if she was showing us to our spot or another group.  3. Sat down and did't get helped helped for 17 minutes.. 4. Ordered and waters took another 7 minutes  5. Drinks came back and one was missing  6. Avocado egg rolls were great no complaints here 7. Ordered side salads and they didn't come out...  8. After another 30 min we asked about them and she blamed the ticket getting lost  9. We got our pizza and salads at the same time, pizza was cold and not cut. 10. No water refills  DO NOT EAT HERE"
Randy J.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,2,1,5.0,4/24/2017,Great service. Food is really good. Monday 1/2 price pizza and $5.00  margaritas. Definitely come back.
Matthew L.,"San Mateo, CA",627,470,3806,3.0,12/17/2014,"Came here twice for lunch.  Both times took over almost two hours...on a weekday. Service here can be kind of slow.  It can take a long time to get water, and even longer for any alcoholic beverage to make it to your table. Definitely don't come here if you have an hour lunch...you're not going to be able to make it back to work in time! I've been to BJ's in other cities, and the food is comparable to the other locations that I've dined at.  At this particular location, I had the country chicken steak, the seared ahi tuna salad, and the clam chowder in the bread bowl.  All were pretty tasty - especially the seared ahi tuna salad, which was surprisingly good.  The clam chowder was not bad either, although it tasted kind of like Progresso's canned chowder.  Hopefully all the food they make is in-house and not anything canned or store bought. Parking can be a nightmare here, only because it's part of Tanforan Mall...so if it's busy with weekend (or holiday) shoppers, parking can be kind of difficult. The times I've come here I've had to park kind of far away... but I guess that might be a blessing in disguise since I can walk off a few extra calories with a farther away parking spot! Overall, this BJ's has a solid three star rating as it offers pretty good tasting food but with slow, slow service.  If you plan to dine in, you should only come here if you have two or more hours to kill.  Not recommended for a quick lunch break unless you're planning to order take out. Good luck!"
sam n.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,,1.0,10/15/2017,We eat at the BJ's near our hone quite regularly (2-3 times a month) so out expectations are realistic. This was by far the worst service I've received at a BJ's and amongst the worst I've experienced at any restaurant in the past year or so. Our entire party left hungry and went to eat elsewhere. The server (Randy) was polite but could not have been more incompetent. We had a party that fluctuated from about 6 to 18 and spent about 3 hours there. The tab was extremely low as it was taking an average of 18 minutes to get a pitcher of beer. We managed to get 7 pitchers over 3 hours. Most glasses were empty throughout most of the night. We had 3 appetizers that took about 40 minutes and came out Luke warm. We weren't even asked if we wanted more food or beverages. As a manager you would expect a large profit off of a large group but the manager did not care. Twice he said he would stop by the table to follow up and he never came by. I'll continue to visit the other locations but this one is forever dead to me
Sandy V.,"San Francisco, CA",49,27,32,1.0,10/17/2015,"We got here at 4 o'clock we ordered five minutes later and now it is 4:55 and our. Food still not here. The people next to us got here fifteen minutes after us and they got their food already, and the worts thing is that the restaurant is not that busy. Forget this place this is our last time here very bad service."
Scott P.,"Los Altos, CA",173,727,511,2.0,9/25/2015,"Full disclosure, never a big fan of this chain, but went with a group from work despite my misgivings. I moderately enjoyed my one beer, their porter. Everything we ordered arrived at wildly different times and was delivered at a snail's pace. When we wanted the check split up, the server proceeded to complain about how difficult that would be for him. Our immediate reply was: every other place can do it.  The server disappeared and the manager had to come take over.  I didn't like that the server punted us to the manager instantly. We were nice and willing to assist the server in dividing the bill but he was not interested in communicating.  The manager did manage to smooth things over, but I am still puzzled as to what the big deal was about?"
MaryElise C.,"Pacifica, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/6/2017,Very slow service. Had to wait 45 minutes for a glass of wine and then had to track down the server to order our food. The food was barely warm when it was finally served. Not pleased with my experience.
Christine A.,"Santa Barbara, CA",8,27,5,4.0,12/19/2016,"When you walk into a BJs, you know what to expect. While the kitchen staff was terribly slow, our wonderful server made up for it. He was so sweet and super attentive, he made the experience that much better. If a manager reads this, please give props to Mario H., he was awesome."
Jonah V.,"San Bruno, CA",1,7,,3.0,9/11/2017,"Meh. The interior is large and nice. But the food portions aren't. Great place for a starvation diet.  I ordered mini pizza once, expecting it was personal pizza size. No by mini, they meant microscopic. The next time I ordered fish tacos. They bring you two measly bland tacos with some unidentifiable cold rice pilaf. Don't bother with dessert. The only thing they have is a pizzookie. Which planet is that from? Then after you order you have to wait15 years before they bring you a dessert the size of a quarter. Here is my advice:This being a restaurant, the food matters."
Kimberly S.,"San Francisco, CA",2,51,,4.0,6/17/2016,"I love BJ's Resturant over in Tanforan Mall. It's a convenient place to grab a bite before seeing  a movie or just wandering around the shops walking off some of the calories!   We've had lots of waiters over the years but Mark G, Shay and Briana are just my absolute favs!  They always greet us with a smile and never rush us or our order. We always feel like we're around friends when we go here.  Just wanted to give a shout out so Management knows they've got some great people working the floor!  We are lucky enough to have time off during the week so we can go when it's not super swamped and have a minute or two between appetizers and the main course to have some friendly convos with them when the restaurant isn't busy and they stop by the table to see if we need anything. The food at BJ's seems to change every now and then, but you can always find something tasty on the menu.  The beers are obviously a focal point and I like the darker end of the taps, but that's neither here nor there. (The new derby cobb salad is pretty darn good and not pre-tossed like the last one, so there's a plus!!!) I wish they had growlers to go, but .... they don't. I guess it's because they don't brew on site - except for their sodas, I think. Unless they do something awful with the service or food, I'll always choose it first over Hooters or the food court on the other side of the mall! Do yourself a favor and sign up for the rewards program, take advantage of their smartphone app and try grabbing a pizza to go - every aspect of their service is great."
Brenda L.,"San Francisco, CA",423,325,782,3.0,12/1/2015,This place falls right in the middle for me. Good for their craft beers and other selections on tap. Multiple screens to view the games and a good sized bar area (which is first come first serve). They also run certain hh specials during major televised games and parking isn't an issue (located in the tanforan shopping plaza) There really aren't many sports bar options around the area so it's probably your best bet after buffalo wild wings. The food is average - similar to an applebees. The quality is a hit or miss. The wings were fresh out the fryer one time I went and another time it was dry as cardboard. The clam chowder in the bread bowl was delicious - not the best clam chowder but definitely the best bread bowl I've had - baked with garlic butter - mmm. Skip the flatbreads - I've yet to find one that tastes good. The fries are thin shoe string fries - not my thing. The spinach artichoke dip was eh - the cheese looked like ricotta/ chunky and not really melted.  Their craft brews are good - I like the hefeweisen and berry burst cider - the best thing is you can get a beer sampler which comes in 4 small flights - if you like variety this is a great option to sample 4 of their craft beers. The service has always been great so no complaints there. The multiple tv screen set up is pretty nice as well. Overall a good place to a grab a drink and watch the game. Don't set your expectations too high on the food however.
Alex J.,"Burlingame, CA",51,139,63,2.0,6/21/2016,"The BJ's I've been to in the past have all been solid choices (not mind blowing but not disappointing either).  This is the first BJ's that I've been to where I left unhappy.  I went prior to a warriors game hoping to enjoy a beer and watch the warriors game.  I called ahead to make sure I would be able to get a seat and was told that the wait was only 15 minutes.  I reached the restaurant and was told that the wait would be 15 minutes (again).  I left my contact number and received a text 1.5 hours after telling me that my table was ready.  I came back to try the food and called ahead again and was told that another 15 minute wait would be ahead of me.  My girlfriend placed her name on the call ahead list on the app and we were seated immediately (very strange).  Once seated, the service was a little slow.  We placed our order and the food arrived (slowly).  We ordered the seared ahi salad, shrimp and asparagus penne, and the fried calamari.  The fried calamari was small but good.  The seared ahi dressing was a bit strong (if you do order, dressing on the side might be a smart choice).  The shrimp and asparagus penne was strange; the it seemed like the dish was slopped onto the plate.  I think they should have remade it because there were BLACKENED asparagus tips in the pasta (clarification: blacked on one side and green on the other side).  Our waiter (who was a social butterfly and seemed to tend to the larger parties that were seated next to us) refilled our water, but I kept on noticing black specks in our water....they might have been using a Brita filter which would explain it, but nothing that i couldn't scoop out.  But on a good note: Pazookies are good...yum.... TL;DR:  Not the best food...sometimes solid flavors but perhaps sloppily prepared with semi slow service...Pazkookies are the good point for all BJ's restaurants.  I might recommend going to another BJ's location"
Ash C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,3.0,4/16/2017,"I drove to pick up a togo order, and upon my arrival my food was ready to be taken home. I paid and left to find out our Atlantic salmon had no sauce on it(it was super dry) and the vegetables weren't even cooked!! I felt so bad for my mom because her entree was not a pleasant experience at all :( atleast my entree was good so we shared mine :)"
Audrey L.,"San Francisco, CA",60,3,,1.0,4/11/2017,"If I could give this location either no stars or a half a star I would. The food and drinks are good. But on countless occasions when I've come to this specific location, we have had really terrible service. The food doesnt cone out at the same time. I usually order soup and salad and my husband orders a burger. Usually they bring out my order first and we are waiting on his burger. Then when his food comes out his fries are usually cold. If we lived closer to the one in San Mateo we would go to that one."
Candy W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,28,9,1.0,8/11/2017,"BJ's is one of those places we go to when we realize, ""Oh let's go since we haven't been there in awhile"". We arrived around 5:30ish PM on a Friday and it was a 20 min wait before we got the text notification that there's a table ready for us. I looked around the restaurant and it wasn't all that busy, despite the fact that it's around dinner time.  Our waiter (from what was stated on our bill) was ""Jimmy A"".  A tall gentleman with a man-bun and a tattoo on his neck. It took awhile for him to take our orders, which was fine since I saw him talking to a party of 4, two tables down, across from us. For drinks, I had ordered the refillable strawberry lemonade. I finished it fairly quick since the cup was full of ice. He hadn't offer me any refills until my boyfriend asked. The calamari we ordered tasted old, cold, soggy, and the batter was falling off. We had to use our hands since we didn't have utensils on the table. I didn't get the chance to catch his name but a different waiter (tall, slim, African American) had brought out our entrees and he was so apologetic, I wanted to give Jimmy A's tips to him instead.  Not once were we checked up on, but I've seen him with the same table of 4 across from us, at LEAST 5 times. What's up with that? My boyfriend insisted on not leaving a tip, but I still left 15% because I work in the food service industry as well. I would get it if maybe he was having a bad day but the service was so terribly poor, I didn't care enough to put that into consideration anymore. The least you could do is say ""thank you"" when we give you the check/tips."
Kristine S.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,17,8,1.0,6/22/2016,"Extremely slow service .. For takeout. They forgot the Bacon part of my Bacon burger, so I came back to get what they left out. Then ordered an appetizer because their portions are significantly smaller than I remember. It's been almost half an hour and still no appetizer or stuff that they forgot to put on my burger. They don't seem to have any urgency to update you or apologize that it's taking so long. Meanwhile the rest of the food is getting soggy and cold. Highly disappointed. The servers/hosts have no professionalism, they rather gather around the front counter and talk than pay attention."
