Franko F.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Hello I came to this restaurant but it is bad service I sat in the patio to order a beer wait 44 minutes with no costumers.. and no one approached I went to order at the bar and pay at the bar. Very poor service I do not recommend it....  :(  ,,"
Irving S.,"San Francisco, CA",18,26,15,1.0,9/9/2015,"We waited for 1 hour for our food and the food was cold. I really don't understand how anybody can actually like this place, I guess they don't know what good food is. I'm trying to give this place a chance  The owner is a cheap sob not to hire and extra waiter. I can't even pay the bill and still here waiting. The toilets are very dirty and people don't flush the toilet horrible place"
Lauren W.,"South San Francisco, CA",14,30,17,1.0,6/7/2016,"I swear, EVERYTIME I come here it's a problem. Last time, I was told a 20 minute wait.. I come in 25 mins later.. My food isn't even started being cooked. Because whoever took my order didn't think to mention the Santa Fe rolls are on recall, so they just changed my order to wings.. I walk up to pay and the lady says so what kinda wings you want? Confusing when I never ordered wings & a bit rude to not explain why your asking me about wings. I ask for s manager, he was very understanding and seemed to actually care about the customers feedback which was nice. I came back honestly because he was so genuine & seemed really concerned w/the well being of the staff & store, but god forbid BJs take care of my order properly.  I come in tonight, my food was just sitting on the counter, not in the oven.. For 10 minutes while I waited to even be helped & another 8 for the girl to ""find"" the rest of my order. I asked the lady how long my food had been sitting out & she had hella attitude like ""Uhm only 5 minutes since I just walked up here 2 seconds ago.."" Meanwhile I was already waiting 15 minutes & saw my food sitting on the counter the entire time (just didn't know it was mine)  I get home, they made me the wrong salad, my potato wedges were fried to a crisp with hardly any of the toppings, just Dry potato skin which is disgusting, they didn't give me the side of sour cream either. Plus when I called, I specifically asked them to make sure they were cooked properly b/c if I don't mention it there burned & dry. The SAME girl who had the attitude at the To go table is the girl who took my order & when I asked them to make sure it was cooked w/all the toppings she's like ""Obviously it will be on there if that's what comes with it or I can charge you for extra"" like obviously I wouldn't be asking for it to be cooked properly if there was no chance it would be cooked wrong.  My boyfriend ordered an appetizer plate of chicken tenders yet they gave us a lunch order with fries which isn't what he asked for. The fries that came with it were so chewy & gross. Probably from sitting out for so long  On top of all that horrible food, I figured there's no way they messed up my pizookie.. So I just threw my order in the trash & BOOM! My pizookie & my boyfriends pizookie were burnt. Hard as a rock. Even the ice cream wouldn't soften it up.  Such a waste of $60 .. I would come back & tell the manager, but every time I come here it's like I have to talk to a manager or I won't get treated properly. If I'm a paying customer I should just be treated kindly & have the proper food cooked. Of course slip ups happen. But it is EVERY TIME w/this location. Come to BJs throw your money away on burnt food & help yourself to some crap service & nasty attitude from the Take out girl,  Verryy disappointing !!"
Rosallie B.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,9,,5.0,5/24/2017,"Came in on a Tuesday right before the dinner rush. Did not have to wait for seating for a table of four. Anthony was our server and he did an excellent job, he made sure are drinks were filled, also checked back to the table often, overall great customer service. Food was delicious!  And very prompt the appetizer and the kids meal were delivered a couple minutes within ordering them. Would come here again!"
Chrys S.,"Burlingame, CA",250,334,681,3.0,4/13/2016,Good lunch specials but it is loud. Great stop if you want to catch a game on TV. Lots of TVs from every seating vantage point.  It does get very busy at lunch. Ample parking since it is at Tanforan mall. But you can also get here via BART. The San Bruno station is just a hop and a skip away. The food is average American fare but they make their own root beer and have a vast array of beers on tap. It is a good option if you just need a standard meal and want to catch a game on TV.
Chiquita B.,"New York, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,It's really sad how Bjs has gone down in every way!! But thank you Andrew for stepping in.
LoveFood W.,"San Francisco, CA",273,47,2,1.0,12/22/2016,"This review is based on just the clam chowder. It was so heavy and creamy and way too salty. For being house-made, it did not meet my expectations. It tasted like it came out of a can."
Debbie S.,"San Bruno, CA",157,62,11,1.0,6/18/2016,"I would give this place a BIG FAT ZERO if the option was available. YOU MUST READ MY REVIEW FOR YOUR SAFETY!  Considering I live in San Bruno, I've only come here three times and the last time I was here was three times too many.  When they first opened, I ordered a salad and wanted steak on it (steak salad). Well I was charged for a large salad plus charged for a steak dinner. Their reasoning was that a steak salad was not on their menu.  Well now it is.  Maybe my complaint made it to the top.  Second time, it took 15 mins to get attended to by a server and 35 min wait for our food. The last time I was here, I ordered the Chicken tortilla soup at 11Am when they first opened as I had a business lunch meeting. It was convenient. I took my first bite and on my second bite something scraped and stabbed my tongue as I forced to keep from swallowing it. OMG! It was a SHARP PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS! Called the server and told her to go to the kitchen and not to serve the soup to anyone then I told her to get her manager.  Filled out an incident report since the glass cut my tongue. They did not charge me for my meal BUT NEVER ASKED ME IF I WANTED SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT. So my lunch meeting turned into a water drinking meeting. Then the server had the nerve to tell me that I was still welcome to leave anything behind for her?????!!!!!!????? Really! Corporate office sent me a $50 gift certificate. My tongue was sore and swollen for 10 days and I received $50. What a joke! BJ's San Bruno is only good for their beer and TV's. I will NEVER be back to this BJ's."
Leslie C.,"San Francisco, CA",26,88,1478,3.0,12/3/2015,This BJs is at Tanforan mall. It's a nice restaurant with a lot of TVs but the service is extremely slow. I ordered chicken wings ahead of time through their mobile app but still had to wait an hour for it after being seated. It was hard to get the waiter's attention to order our dinner and again for drinks. This BJs is a major disappointment.
Rachel R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",42,9,5,1.0,11/28/2016,If I could give this place no stars I would.  Not only did we have three different servers come tell us they were taking over for the other but none of them asked for our drinks until we were sitting down for ten minutes.  Then when we did order they took forever to bring our food. Naturally we asked for ketchup and some extra sauces which did not come till we were all done eating.  Our drinks were not refilled the entire meal and neither of the three servers who said they were taking our table checked on us.  You would think that getting the check would be the easiest thing but they couldn't even get that to us. We eat out quite a bit and had friends with us from out of town.  This was by far the worst service we have encountered.  I would rather drive to another location than come back here.
Kent S.,"San Francisco, CA",53,63,6,2.0,7/8/2016,"This is our go to place each week since it is close to our work. We have watched this place decline over the last three years. There are two waiters during the lunch period that are outstanding, the rest need to go. Food is slow to come out and many time the main entree comes out before the soup. salad etc. Waiters do not have certain areas with tables , but are roaming all over the place covering tables, it is very unorganized. We challenge the management of this place to contact us and let us share our experience with the restaurant etc. While we would hate to go to another venue, this place is becoming more of a 1 star venue than a 5."
Anh N.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",17,29,19,1.0,11/23/2016,"I haven't been here in years and I now remember why I stopped going.  Came with a group and they decided on BJ's. Wait time was over an hour to get seated. We get seated and there's no menus or utensils waiting for us. We had to grab them ourselves bc our server ran off somewhere. They forgot my daughter's meal, and her friend's meal and that took over an extra hour from when everyone started eating. The waitress said she ""forgot"" and apologized. What's the point in writing orders down and making that excuse. Also, when we had to check on the missing orders, we had to ask a different server - bc ours was no where in site. He had to place the order bc there was none made by her.  I don't know why I came in expecting this place to be different, but I guess it did change- it got worse. If you have a LOT of time to spare, are with a small group and like to be literally left alone by any service- then come here."
Jasmine L.,"Albany, CA",0,24,6,1.0,11/20/2016,"Bad service, slow service, cold food, not seasoned. We had s party of eleven and 5 orders were messed up!"
Ruby R.,"Daly City, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/27/2017,"We came on a Thursday evening, the place was a little crowded but we found a space in the bar. The food came out fairly quickly but the service was mediocre. Nerves got plates for our appetizers and our silverware came halfway thru our appetizer. I'm the end we orders a mini churro pazooki, and the churros were not dusted with cinnamon sugar. How am I suppose to eat a churro without cinnamon sugar. That's what I get for giving chain restaurants a chance."
Gabe T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,43,3,1.0,2/20/2017,"Horrific service and food poisoning received. My girlfriend and I were told a 20 minute wait and ended up waiting 35 minutes. It was no big deal but then we asked if we could ask for happy hour prices, the waiter was great but said he would ask the manager because we had an unexpected wait time; then the manager comes out and says she would comp an appetizer, which really confused us because we were looking to pay and had no complaint at first...she comps is wings and hours later we're having diarrhea and nausea. This place is a joke and now I see why the reviews suck."
Madison C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/20/2017,HORRIBLE SERVICE & SUB-PAR FOOD! Do not come here unless you want to wait over an hour just to be acknowledged and get water.  I am usually a huge fam of BJ's but this one fell short.  The waitress was extremely rude when we had to continuously ask for water and once we finally got our stuff we still got attitude because she was frustrated with us when we tried our best to organize our orders.  Do not come to this BJ's unless you want to wait very long for your food.
Clemencia C.,"Beachwood, OH",0,22,,5.0,4/3/2017,"I was here with a large group of young students, and the team at BJ's was simply great!  They were flexible, attentive, and made us feel very welcomed and cared for. Our space in the back was separate, and thus perfect for our group. They graciously accommodated some special requests (gluten-free, lactose-free). A terrific experience!"
Ben L.,"Burlingame, CA",22,232,210,3.0,4/24/2016,"I don't come to this location very much. It was standard BJs. Not too busy for a Sunday afternoon. The pozookie's are still a good buy. The deep dish pizza is underrated but could use a little more sauce. I tried the hoagie sandwich. Not bad but I don't think I'd get it again. I don't like Dijon mustard, so make sure you tell them to switch out to normal French's mustard if that's your preference. Service was really good here."
Nerissa D.,"Daly City, CA",92,146,885,3.0,8/3/2014,Had to take girls for dinner and BJs was the pick of the night.  Food is ok!  The pizza was just ok. Clam chowder was a tiny bit salty for my taste although it's very filling  Service- we had several ppl and one of them was pretty helpful.  Our waiter was attentive and apologetic for keeping us waiting  If it's crowded see if you can just grab a table near the bar area. It's first come first serve. We saw ppl waiting for tables and when we walked in we found a table and say down.  We are done w dinner and I see ppl still we airing for their table.
Yosof R.,"Daly City, CA",1,21,52,4.0,7/14/2015,"This review is a sum up of all the times coming here. First off, its a good location to meet if youre in the peninsula area for food. Next to mall and near freeway exits.  The food is usually good, nothing special or a must have here. The soups should have MORE in he bowl but whatever.  The better reason I dont even complain is usually because the waitresses are young and cute here. The one girl i got the other day could of been more of a talker but she was so broad. She needs to tell her boo thang to hit it right.  The host was banging! Pretty face and bbw, damn. I wanna take her out but she might get it all the time.  On another note, be careful who is sitting next to you. I get the feeling ex felons and drug dealers come here for their sit downs. Speak soft. Mind your own business."
