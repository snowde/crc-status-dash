Lyz A.,"San Francisco, CA",135,7,2,1.0,4/21/2015,"I had a moth in my salad- enough said. It's little tiny legs were still moving sprawled upside down with its wings lodged in my watermelon feta salad.  We told our server and she shrieked with disgust.  She said don't worry I'll take care of it... We got the bill, nothing was taken off. My boyfriend approached her and she apologized and took off fukn 4 dollars off the bill! Really!!? 4 dollars? My boyfriend told her to put herself in our shoes and she replied with ""I'm a server"" what does that even mean? You see these dirty critters creeping around all the time in your restaurants food? On top of the unsanitary facility, the service was slow for a Sunday night at 830pm. Even when the busser said its a really slow night.   Make a choice, come here or not- just be careful and make sure you check your food before you put it in your mouth becaus"
Janelle M.,"South San Francisco, CA",52,75,559,3.0,9/16/2016,"Always come here for a last resort thing if I'm at the mall. Food is alright, but the place is starting to smell like stale beer, I think they need to deep clean their carpets."
Bianca G.,"Daly City, CA",161,4,4,2.0,4/2/2017,"They need to get nicer workers. Every time I come here, someone got an attitude. And they ALWAYS take forever with everything. Forever to take our order. Forever to get our food"
Elle C.,"Milpitas, CA",37,37,8,1.0,5/31/2016,"My daughter had a show nearby last December and we wanted to celebrate with our family that drove out to see her. BJ's closes late and can fit a large amount of people so we decided to come here. Biggest mistake! By their wait staff's behavior they obviously dislike each other and hate their jobs. We arrived at 9pm and got seated closer to 11pm. They kept saying 20 minutes, 20 minutes. If they just told the truth we could have gone somewhere else. A few of my family members that drove 1 1/2 hours had to leave before we were seated because it was getting so late.  We finally get seated and placed our drink order and waited 15 minutes for that. When our waitress came to take our food order another waitress came by and said she was slow and she can help but our waitress was salty and told her to bounce. We waited another 45 minutes before our food finally came out. She rarely came to our table to check on us but she was very attentive to a table across from us. While we waited for our drinks to be refilled a male waiter was passing by and my son said ""excuse me"" to get someone's attention. That male waiter kept walking and said ""I don't work here"" but entered the kitchen. Ew. We finally got the attention of another male waiter who started checking on us because our chic wasn't. He got our dessert order but got it wrong and we waited another 30 minutes for that and then another 30 minutes for our bill. We were frustrated with waiting and for being ignored we were complaining to each other about the horrible service. The male waiter that supposedly didn't work there and another one were sitting at a booth nearby giving us nasty looks for complaining. By the time we left it was almost 1am. Never ever again. My daughter has another show coming up in July and this time we won't be coming here nor would I recommend it to any of the 100+ performers and our 900 guests."
Roselle B.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,2,,4.0,3/8/2017,"After not receiving our ice cream for our piezookie with a take out order, the Manager actually called us to advise the ice cream was missed.  To make good on the situation, the Manager offered us 2 free pizookies.  When I went to pick up the gift, we actually were given a gift card and a free pizookie.  Very nice gesture from the Manager cuz we weren't even going to say anything.  Then 2 days later, after his time off, the Manager followed up to ensure we received our compensation.  Very pleased with the service and follow up treatment.  Always happy with our food from BJ's restaurant.  Thank you for the good service."
Tara A.,"San Francisco, CA",1549,454,1257,3.0,5/16/2014,"Came here for takeout on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy, but we got our food in around 15 minutes. I was a little irritated though because they got my pizookie order wrong... And I was really excited for the one I got haha (that seems bratty.. oh well). We ordered: Avocado eggrolls: my favorite!! I love them both here and at the Cheesecake Factory. They give you 3 big eggrolls and they are cut in half, so you can definitely share! They come with a sweet tamarind sauce that goes really well with the avocado. Hawaiian mahi mahi: Pretty disappointed in this dish. I think I paid $15 for it and the fish portion definitely did not look like it was worth $15!!! Maybe like... $7 lol. And that's being generous! The fish was also pretty dry and I didn't taste the soy glaze that it said it came with. However, the pineapple fried rice that came with this was delicious and made up for the lack of taste in the fish! Chicken bacon ranch pizza: Cute personal sized pizza. Didn't really taste the ranch so I wish it came with extra ranch for dipping hahaha Choc chip pizookie: Pretty standard, very delicious and soft even after we took it for takeout. We ended up putting it in the toaster oven to heat up and it was perfect! Still had crunchy edges and a soft inside. It was smart of them to give a separate container for the ice cream too. Only downside of this was that I actually ordered cookies and cream!!!!!!! :( Was so disappointed when we saw that it was chocolate chip.... Sigh.... Prob won't get over it until I actually get my cookies and cream pizookie lol. Only 3 stars because I was really disappointed with the fish for that price. All the other food deserves 4 stars! This place is pretty pricey thoguh."
Cassie S.,"South San Francisco, CA",288,1,1,5.0,3/12/2016,The food here was amazing. My omelette was perfectly shaped and well put together. Definitely recommend BJ's brunch menu. Our sever Russell was great as well. Greeted us right away and anticipated our guest needs very well. Definitely going back!
Jon T.,"San Francisco, CA",146,10,4,1.0,12/14/2016,I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip as a starter. The dip had a layer of oil settled on the top and the nachos were soaked in the oil that it was fried in I couldn't even finish because it was so greasy. The deep dish pizza (if you can even call it that) tasted like it was from pizza hut with the crispy oily crust and one thin layer of toppings. The opened faced late night burger with the chile verde was a weird combo and the two flavors just didn't go well together. When I lifted the bun off the plate it was glistening and dripping with grease. The meal was quite disappointing and I definitely won't be going back for the food.
Andria C.,"Fresno, CA",145,7,,1.0,1/3/2017,"If you like warm food, don't come here. Waiter wasn't  attentive, messed up our order (it never got received to the kitchen so we waited an extra 30 minutes for food). AND the kitchen gave me my food ice cold (I ordered a burger). Waste of time."
Oog B.,"Vancouver, WA",0,80,1,2.0,6/6/2017,"Two stars mostly for the food, because it's not bad. But the cleanliness and services not good at all!  I'm finally getting around to writing this, since I plan to every time I've been here.  As usual, there's a weird dead smell upon entering, and lack of communication from the host makes things confusing. She said to wait, that someone was coming to seat us, so we did.  Finally host and server speak and look around, I assume to decide who to seat first, although no one else was waiting. No smiles from anyone at all, so weird. Even as we were seated there was only a blank stare and monotone speaking.  Employees here are like zombies. After repeating my order three times and having the server repeat it back incorrectly every time, I was ready to give up. It wasn't difficult, a salad with added chicken. I wasn't really in the mood to have such a difficult and weird nachos experience.  I'll cross the street to Jacks next time."
Edward K.,"Pacifica, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/23/2017,"This was once one of my favorite brew pubs but lately it just seems to get worse with each visit. I brought my family here for lunch yesterday. It wasn't crowded and we were seated after a 15 minute wait. But it was all downhill from there. The waitress got part of our order wrong, we had to ask for utensils and napkins, the order came out staggered, with the final item arriving an hour after we were seated. Again, it was not crowded, there were open tables everywhere. Just a terrible experience, yet again. There was a time I would have rated BJ's five stars but that time seems like a distant past. I simply cannot recommend this place."
Steve N.,"Fremont, CA",0,14,4,1.0,7/1/2017,"This BJ's has no understanding of the cooking term ""blackened"". I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos. First, I was brought plain shrimp tacos. Luke warm shrimp with no spice whatsoever.  Not blackened. I returned it and in about 5 minutes they brought my order back with the exact same shrimp, now cold, with a little cajun spice sprinkled on top. Still not blackened. Server agreed it wasn't right and offered to refire. I asked that he send the manager over. She apologized, said it would be free and offered dessert for the people eating with me since they'd be finished by the time I got my food. (Table got a tasty pazookie and a scoop of ice cream.) 20 minutes later, I got shrimp cooked without seasoning and then rolled in way too much seasoning. Very salty. Still not blackened. Everyone else was done and I gave up. Another 10 minutes or so to get a manager over (different than first). She apologized and offered me something else to eat, but by this time everyone was ready to leave. She asked what she could do for me and suggested perhaps a gift card. She sent me away with a $25 gift card, but I'm not particularly anxious to come back, especially after this experience (and seeing their 2.5 star rating here.) Tip to BJ's: Rather than just compensating an unhappy customer, alert the kitchen that's about to refire a poorly prepared meal to put a rush on it and to make sure it's what it's supposed to be. Also, have your chefs see  In addition to the above, my wife's bison burger was not cooked rare as requested. We told the waiter to let the kitchen know, but that we didn't want to return it since she was particularly hungry. Tasted charred, but was edible."
Rochelle M.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",96,151,230,3.0,6/16/2015,"A great sports bar to meet up with friends and also a great place to have lunch with family.  The food was ok, the pizookie was good and great to share with others.  The staff was attentive and friendly. It took awhile for our food to arrive but it wasn't too long, maybe 25min at most.  The fries I was a bit disappointed in. They are super thin and oily. I got more a bite of oil than fries.  The burgers are good but also a bit greasy.  Can't complain, I'll be coming back if I can't find a place to eat."
Jamie B.,"Chandler, AZ",296,404,726,3.0,4/30/2016,"Food was great, but the service was a bit slow for lunch service.  Also the hostess was a taken back because we did not want to site outside in the mall patio."
Shannon C.,"San Mateo, CA",212,74,121,4.0,10/5/2015,"Going to try and make this review quick. Came here twice. Both times food was good. I could do without the lemon zest chicken though. The buffalo wings are the best. First time I went, the waiter was absolutely terrible. I don't remember his name but he literally looked completely out of it. (-1 for that) Second time, the waiter was much better. He was helpful and nice. It was around 10pm when I came with my family and I was really happy to see that people didn't look annoyed that they were working a night shift. Go you guys. Overall, probably would come back."
Anne R.,"Hercules, CA",5000,829,322,3.0,3/22/2015,"Possibly one of worst customer service experiences ever. Came here pretty late and an hour about closing time so you would think service would be better, even though it was busy. We got seated right away and our server greeted us and asked for our drink order and shortly after we ordered our our meals. I will also add that the bjs menu is really large so you have plenty of options to choose from!  Once we got our food, which was pretty good by the way, our waiter was never to be seen again. We waited around for about 40 minutes or so after wards and he still didn't come around, not even to refill our drinks. We he finally showed up to help the table across from us, we asked for the bill and he apologized for the wait as it had been busy.  Overall, the food was good and the place was large and full of life but the service could have been much better as it was a bit on the slower side and the waiters didn't show much interest in the customers at all. So would I return? I would give it another chance because the food was that good but hope that customer service returns. There is plenty of parking as there is a parking lot right in front of the restaurant."
Katie P.,"Daly City, CA",474,100,234,4.0,5/4/2015,"I'm personally not a big fan of American... type Fried Food but BJ for sure one of those that are worth going back again.  *Service: our waitress was the best! Her name is Xinia and she super nice. We had small conversations here and there and although she was super busy busting other tables, she still stayed a few minutes here and there just to chat with us. She always had a big smile on. *Food: We ordered a bunch of appetizers. My friend ordered this American Burger but turned out to be sandwich bread instead of burger buns, which I find odd. The Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wrap is really good, especially that sweet tangy sauce they have. We also ordered fried calamari and it was so crispy...! My favorite was that Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. We asked for extra jalapenos and it was just the BEST. The fries were soft and adding that cheese + jalapenos ... *drool. I can just eat the whole thing myself! *Atmosphere: super chill. It is that perfect sports bar but with lots of food along with it too. They have dim lights with lots of TVs channeled to different sports channel. Big booths with also good ground tables"
Shawn S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/16/2017,"Well everyone, Bj's needs experienced help with table setting service and utensil maintenance...went there tonight, order appetizers, waitress put apps. on table but, no plates or silverware. Once silverware got to us, had to give back 3 times because of  food residue harden on forks and knives. Salad was great but pasta severely undercooked. Management was excellent on handling mishaps but their in need of professional kitchen help...hope they get it."
Saurabh C.,"Burlingame, CA",0,22,6,3.0,7/18/2015,"Good food, good service and overall a good experience. We all liked our food. The pasta, the soup and the flatbread were all satisfactory. My friend liked the beer he selected. Our server was very, very polite and took good care of us. What I hated was that two out of our six water glasses were extremely dirty (thankfully from the outside.) My friend's flatware was dirty, too but he got it exchanged. I do not understand how any place can slip up in something as basic as clean utensils?  Makes one think how they wash them in the first place.  If I go here again, at some point in the future, and I see clean utensils with everything else remaining the same, I might add another star."
Marie Antoinette L.,"Broadmoor, CA",179,10,1,1.0,12/30/2016,"I ordered pizza for pick up here, took it home & ate it. After already eating most of it I found a strand of hair that was deeply baked in my pizza. The most gross thing ever! Ever since then I never came back."
