Fiona B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,47,119,3.0,10/27/2015,"Walked in and staffs was kind of talking amongst themselves, they saw me but didn't say anything. Same time, a family of 3 came in, they were slow to greet them as well, but they were seated first even though I came in before them.  This guy seated us, walked reallllllllllllly slow and allllllllllllllll the way to the back even though the front had seats, and our section smelled like garbage. Service was slow, waited 8 minutes til a waitress came to give us the menu and ask what we would like to drink. Another 5 minutes pass, we ordered.  Waited for 15 to 20 minutes for the food and the food was just okay. . .  Couldn't wave down any other waiter to get the bill.  I don't know if I'll ever go back, unless if friends go there or I'm desperate,"
Janeth L.,"Novi, MI",34,2,,1.0,7/1/2016,"The service was horrible! They never checked on you, never refill our waters, and had to wait over half hour for food when the restaurant wasn't even busy at all!  The food was tasteless, lukewarm, and messy. It looked like someone's leftovers that they didn't want and tasted just like that.  I will never come back to this place! Complete disappointment."
Nicole S.,"Brisbane, CA",6,49,,2.0,3/27/2016,"The service is always bad, and it takes forever for the food to come out.  The food is mediocre at best. We had the clam chowder, and it was lurk warm.  The ahi tuna salad was bland as well. I don't know how this place is always packed."
Courtney C.,"San Bruno, CA",376,23,9,2.0,12/12/2016,"The service is always awful. They're slow, forget stuff, and it seems like they just don't care. I do like their berry burst cider and pazookies but it's honestly not worth the wait."
Jess M.,"Corona, CA",4,9,4,1.0,11/29/2016,"Worst service here. I came here after a flight and waited ten minutes at my booth before I was even greeted by my waiter. I had to get up and find someone who was sitting on a counter to get my server. There were easily ten employees that walked by without any regard to me as I say waiting. Needless to say, if I wasn't so hungry I would have left. So disappointed in the service here. No thanks!"
Mary S.,"Auburn, CA",2,18,,2.0,6/10/2016,"I've been BJs at least a hundred times over many years at six locations in the Western US. This is hands down the most unusual and worst BJs location I've been to. The service is slow and the waitstaff seems to care less. There was a new guy training tonight (with potential to be great), but service tonight was on par with the reviews...bad.  The kitchen needs work also. It took over twenty minutes for my two appetizers to be served. The guacamole was good, but it was served with stale chips. Chicken lettuce wraps tasted good, but chicken was served in big chunks...it's usually cut up into small centimeter cubes to make it easier to eat with the lettuce leaves.  Sad."
Sam V.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,12,1,3.0,2/27/2017,"The food is pretty good here but the service ALWAYS sucks! It's super packed and seems like they cant hire good servers or the kitchen is backed up. Either way, if your looking for good service and quality food, I would go across the street to Jacks. If you want some decent happy hour deals but don't care about frustrating service, then go to bjs."
Tracy C.,"San Francisco, CA",99,80,12,4.0,5/7/2015,"Made a takeout order a few days ago: a half sandwich lunch special w/ fries and tomato mozzarella salad. When I picked it up and brought it back, my fries weren't in there! I sent in an email complaint just to let them know, and the next day Crystal, a manager, gave me a call and offered to offer my next meal free of charge. When I came back today, the manager John came out (Crystal told me she'd be out the day I wanted to come) and personally apologized and thanked me for coming in, and made sure to double check that everything in my order was there.  Sure, BJs isn't the most upscale of restaurants, but I do appreciate the attention they took to rectifying the small mistake. The great customer service did not go unnoticed, and I'll definitely be back for more take out orders."
Jerianne G.,"Daly City, CA",1361,387,719,3.0,1/27/2014,"I'm rather surprised that I haven't made an actual review for this place, I've been here a couple of times already. This place is basically like Elephant bar. Its family friendly, and its adult friendly, since there's a bar there also. The lighting here has always been dim, so be orepared to squint while reading the menu. The menu varies from pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches, to seafood, light food, and desserts. This place also has several ""customize yourself"" items. When this place first opened up, it really was something big. Over the years, their quality of food sorta went down in a slow descent. They added the ""small snacks"" portion, but some of these snacks do not fit the description of ""small snack"". They've also increased the prices for many of their entrees, but the portions are always smaller than the price you pay for. Some recent additions that have been made are the additional tables outside the restaurant and inside the mall. More seats = more people accommodated = better business. Service here is amazingly slow. I understand that it gets way busy on weekends, but sometimes people who come here after you will end up getting their food before you. Some waiters here work well, while others don't. There was an instance where my family and I had waited about 30-40 mins for our food, and when they brought it to our table, they just slid the plates across the table rather than gently pass them to us. They didn't even have the nerve to apologize, they just walked off afterwards. I get that people have off days, but you chose to work at a restaurant that gets busy. If you can't work well under pressure, then throw in the towel and get another job. Some foods here are definitely not worth the price. Back then, their presentation of foods were on point. But over the years, that has changed. Their pastas sound so good through the description, but when they come out, they look like something anyone can cook within their own homes. I'm not down to pay $15 just to eat pasta that looks like it was splashed in sauce and dumped on the plate. Recently, I waited for a California chicken sandwich and when it came out, it was just a basic sandwich with fries. Did I really just wait 30 minutes for a simple sandwich that I could've made myself?  That and the chicken was burnt also, it tasted like charcoal. Big ups though for the pizookies and other desserts. This is a place I would prefer to seldom go rather than be a regular."
Kevonna M.,"Redwood City, CA",18,2,,1.0,1/5/2017,Waiter was not on point at all! Brought us cold fries twice and put everything on my food i told them not to. Do not waste your time or money here you've been warned.
Ken W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",120,185,1068,4.0,4/30/2014,Get a pizookie Nuff said.
Bill S.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,28,4,1.0,10/1/2016,"Of course, I'm thankful because I know there are less fortunate out there that don't have the opportunity to eat out or even eat for that matter.  Service at this place horrible, we came in on a Saturday evening, I anticipated it would be busy and it was. The patio had a lot of open seating so we opted to sit out there with the kids. We were seriously looking for other locations to go eat because after we sat outside, it took about 15 minutes for a server to come out. Our server was very nice and professional, the few times we saw her, it appeared she was a little overworked or maybe this place was understaffed.  After we ordered our drinks and food, multiple servers came out with a little here and there. When the food finally came, it was cold. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich that I can equate to a gas station grilled sandwich. My wife's personal pizza looked decent, she didn't have any complaints.  I like BJ's restaurants but don't be fooled by this one."
Jenny L.,"Jamestown, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/28/2016,"This was my first BJ's experience and also my last.. service was poor due to our waiter watching the football game on tv instead of doing his job. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.. very dry.. my friend had the bacon cheeseburger with avocado, nothing special. They are overpriced for such poor tasting food."
Tanya O.,"Montclair, CA",5,15,154,1.0,8/21/2016,"Rude waiter, never coming back.  Had to ask for silverware, never checked in on us, slow service..."
Julie L.,"San Francisco, CA",471,1078,2157,2.0,2/13/2015,"Plenty of seats but we still had to wait a little. Hmmm. Appetizer sampler was a good deal since we wanted variety. Didn't enjoy the avocado egg roll which was too mushy. The mozzarella sticks, dip and etc. were ok. For dinner, I had the Atlantic salmon. As always, the fish turns out dry but the amount of sauce/butter ladled onto my rice made it yummy. Enjoyed that more than the actual entree. The veggies were a bit soft. I tried the other dishes and they were also dry.  Prices of entrees range from $9.50-$22.00. Worth it? Not so much."
Sandra H.,"Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, CA",181,4,,1.0,11/16/2016,"Used to love this place.  But don't give your seat up to a single guy when you're chilling with your boys.  As soon as they see you are not alone, they decide to disrespect you and call you every name in the book.  Best part of it all, the manager Andrew (or whatever his ""real name is"" (good job on hiring practices BJs) tells you that you are kicked out for standing up for yourself.  Wow!!!!!!!"
Angeline M.,"Martinez, CA",28,2,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Maybe I'm just not a fan of BJ's. We were in the area and craved for their chicken wings (we usually go to the BJ's in Concord). However, our wings were super dry! We also ordered poke, pasta w/ meatballs and they tasted horrible! Brussel sprouts was ok though.. Service was very slow too... Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"
Grace M.,"San Jose, CA",201,35,7,1.0,4/29/2016,"Pay with cash don't use a card! It's BJs, a classic with mediocre service and decent food and desserts but this location has lost my business. Our service was almost non existent from the start. We only saw our original server in the beginning and assumed she went on break or something when a new server (who looked under the influence)  came back after we were done and gave us the check and took the card for payment. .   The transaction took longer than normal which I thought everyone here was just slow due to the service we received, but within the next week I received fraudulent charges on the card I used there.  It was a card infrequently used and the only place where the card was out of my sight.  I didn't want to post if I was wrong, but just recently a friend had a mentioned  how his card got fraud charges after paying at BJs this location with a card.  This was too much to be coincidence so watch your cards and be careful when it's out of you sight!"
Lisa H.,"San Francisco, CA",168,60,63,1.0,2/21/2016,"This place has the absolute worst service ever to be known in the world. What restaurant has 1200k+ reviews and still remain at 2 stars?!!  Currently sitting here after waiting 15+ minutes to have our drink orders taken and when the waitress finally arrives, she was not even the slightest apologetic. It's understandable if she was busy but at least acknowledge our existence and let us know if you plan on coming to our table.  This place is only good because of its hours and its prices for the amount of food. Don't bother coming here any other time of the day, it'd only ruin your day."
Mary-Helen A.,"Daly City, CA",168,109,12,2.0,4/26/2016,"I'm back... I barley go here and most of the time I don't have a problem, but I took my son out here today for his 5th bday. food was good! Our server on the other hand... He was missing ol not once asked how we was. I asked a few other severs for things including the check 3 times! Over heard the others asking where he was... No where to be found. well I mean that not my problem but we were scheduled to watch a movie after BUT now we missed it because of the lack of our server... honestly, it's not only the servers but it wasn't a full full house so managers be on top of your toes and keep watch of your staff. because customers like me would complain, I just didn't have the time to."
