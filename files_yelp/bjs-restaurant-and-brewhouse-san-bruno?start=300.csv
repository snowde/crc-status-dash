Jill S.,"San Leandro, CA",5,24,4,2.0,1/28/2016,"Dined here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend & siblings. Service was slow & inattentive. *Unusual, it was not busy for a weekend night* Waited about 40 mins to get seated, (Used the text app to get alerts of when a table is available). We were finally seated, & got our drinks promptly.. But I felt like we had to wait another 30-40 mins just to place our order!  So, by that time, our drinks are gone.  about another 30 mins after we finally placed our orders, home-girl comes back around asking how we're doing & if there is anything else we need.. I mean, if you see all these empty cups on the table, and STILL WITHOUT FOOD... Yes darling, We're just F*CKN PEACHY. um, maybe a new server would be nice. Yeah, wouldn't come back here unless I don't have a choice."
Jack R.,"San Francisco, CA",1931,1174,1327,2.0,2/26/2014,"I think my friend should have her own reality Tv show. Something that's a mix between The Real Housewives of San Francisco and The San Francisco Mafia Wives. She's tough, and when she says ""I'll cut you,"" you best believe she means it. And though I haven't seen it, I'm sure she carries a machete, chainsaw, and some Rocky and Bullwinkle bombs in her purse. So when she says she likes coming here, I'm not going to disagree with her. At least, not to her face. We used to work together, and are here to catch up. She orders beer, and I order an ahi tuna appetizer, and spicy buffalo wings. I wanted to order the rootbeer float, but when I ask the waiter how much the rootbeer float would be as opposed to a regular rootbeer he says he doesn't know.   And since he took away our menus awhile ago, and since I don't want a rootbeer float that badly, I'm not going to fight with him.  But when she starts asking him about what kind of vodka they have at the bar, and if he can make this or that drink, and he says ""I don't know,"" I began to shake my head. I hoped he would see it. It was my way of warning him that he better run and get those drinks she wanted, and quick too.  You don't want to get on her bad side, I tried to convey to him telepathically, as I looked at him, and back at the bar. Hinting that that's where he should be. Not here, answering ""I don't know"" to what drinks they can and can't do. Fortunately, he lived to bring out my appetizers, the tuna had no flavor, and the buffalo wings tasted like Tabasco sauce. Both mediocre. Like the service.  But, unlike him, I'm not going to say a word.  I just sat there and agreed when she spoke about how stupid he was, and was thankful that she didn't break the cosmopolitan over his head."
Bing W.,"Daly City, CA",94,32,8,1.0,5/9/2016,"Things have really gone downhill at BJ's and its no surprise to see so many bad reviews.  Just went there today for lunch and stood in front of the hostess counter to get a table for 5 minutes without even being acknowledged.  There were two hostesses there just chatting it up and didn't even care that customers were waiting on them.  It's like BJs management just hires people for the hell of it and aren't supervised so these people are getting paid to socialize.  Lucky them.   After being ignored, I just found a seat at the bar instead.  Service was slow as usual, tables sticky/unclean, and the menu is now a disaster.  It seems as if BJs is trying to mimic cheesecake factory's menu but failed miserably.  Ordered the new baked ziti dish and the bottom of the dish is literally all oil.  I understand maybe some oil due to the cooking process, but the pasta was floating in oil.   To say that least, I highly doubt I'll be going back.  There are other places in the area that are at least cleaner and hostess more professional."
Merie M.,"Marina, CA",23,9,1,1.0,5/8/2016,"Kinda of disappointed. Chicken lettuce wrap... Not what I had expected. I've been to several BJs and I'm sure that they use ground chicken. The food wasn't satisfying. Not worth it here... I also ordered the calamari, the sauce was all over the plate. What waste of my money. They can do better- common guys- get it together like the other BJs"
Margarita L.,"San Francisco, CA",62,20,8,2.0,4/30/2016,"Steak sirloin burn from outside and raw from inside, kids cheese burger old lettuce and tomatoes Services the stupid  waitress Overall not worth it"
Leilani Z.,"Lake Forest Park, WA",772,4,,2.0,10/28/2016,"I know how the restaurant industry works, so I try to be as patient as I can at restaurants. My experience at this location was very poor. We sat in the open seating bar area around 4pm and didn't get greeted until 413. Before then I had to get up and grab menus myself from the host. Since we knew what we wanted right away, we ordered with our first waiter. I get this is transition time, so 10 mins later the same server came by and introduced us to Lovely and said she will be taking care of us. Cool, no problem. We should be getting our drinks in 5 mins now. Nope. Add another 10 mins and we finally got our first order of drinks. For the rest of our evening our server checked in with us maybe every 15 mins. Or was at least in the same vicinity every 15 mins. So when I wanted to order my last drink, I had to bother a different server with a different section to have our server see us. I am not familiar with this menu, and on the first page of beers it shows one stout. I figured you guys only offered one stout so I ordered ""one stout please."" It wasn't the one I thought I was getting. My server should have specified which stout I wanted... Unless she is just new? She should ask what kind especially for beers, or any kind of alcohol that has different flavors with its (example, beer) family. To me, this problem is the same as me ordering ""one beer please""... Obviously the waiter/bartender would respond, ""which kind?"" Also, I know I could have approached my server to solve this solution but it wasn't until I got my bill that I realized the stout situation.  Overall, I'll still come to a BJ's, but never this location again. Although this leaves me skeptical that other locations have this same inattentive service...."
Ellie V.,"South San Francisco, CA",6,16,3,1.0,11/18/2016,Really disappointing. Came in for dinner before a fun movie. Mozzarella sticks were cold.  Potato skins weren't fully melted and also not hot. Endless wait for dessert. Server kept disappearing. The bathroom was a swamp. But hey at least the check came. Before the dessert???  Not sure it's worth coming back after this one.....
Jes W.,"Oceanside, CA",18,33,,1.0,9/25/2016,"I debated writing this review. We were in last night and I gave it a day to consider. I decided to write it because if I can save someone some cash, I'd like to. We came in last night for dinner and had apps and dinner. Food was subpar, but the server would never know since we barely saw him. It was the worst service I've ever had. I've never contemplated leaving no tip before last night, but I couldn't do that. I was under the impression that if you were a bar server, you had to be a phenomenal employee? We were never checked in, never got refills for drinks, and still spent $57. Unreal. Save your money, go somewhere else. And please BJ's, retrain your service staff."
Mam C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,58,15,3.0,10/30/2016,"Good variety off beer, numerous selection though house beers tend to be on the light and watery side. Porter is smooth and chocolate, stout 4 - slight bitter dark chocolate with slight raisin, nutty brunette 4- slight smoke and brown, pumpkin ale (seasonal) 4.1- smooth light pumpkin taste is flavorful enough, Hefeweizen is citrusy 4.2- slight clove banana though still light in taste, wide range in between. Food good but pricy for the portion size Ahi tuna salad , jambalaya"
Terry S.,"Daly City, CA",113,163,131,3.0,10/18/2016,"As much as I like BJ's, be forewarned of take out when ordering bowls of soup.  This place is a big rip off when it comes to that.  They really short change you with take out and barely give you 6 oz.  What a jip"
Lin G.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,3,,1.0,5/30/2017,"Terrible service. Very limited gluten-free...unreliable protocol for cross-contamination. We were given food with no utensils. Stopped waiters going by to ask. Asked for manager twice. Finally got forks, with one knapin used. Manager finally brought knives. Food got cold. I took a chance on a supposedly gf quinoa dish. Didn't feel well afterwards. Two family members ordered jambalaya, and one was too salty to eat. I was visiting CA from NJ. I must seek out places that do gf well, and go to places that have gf options on menu. Manager comped the meal due to terrible service, but I'm never going back there. One waiter we asked for silverware walked off and promptly started horsing around inappropriately (groping!) with a female waitress, in clear view, in addition to ignoring our need for flatware."
Scott L.,"South San Francisco, CA",106,58,40,5.0,3/6/2016,"Tom, the GM, immediately took care of the situation. The kitchen manager came out as well and they brought out an order that was made to perfection. It's amazing how better something tastes when made properly. It was night and day. If those boneless wings come out correctly each time, they will be my new favorite item. Like I'd said before, I hated leaving that review. There are amazing people who work here and I love coming back for good food, good beer, and good company. Faith restored."
Ashley F.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,4.0,5/28/2016,Here waiting .... I understand it's busy but lack of communication is the issue.. The waiter walks by 15 times looks at us and keeps walking ordered the drinks 30 mins later they come and 2 is missing 15 mins later they come and we order apps I had to ask the guy 30 mins after to please take our order. We have no silver ware menus are sticky! And are waiter just says he is busy! I mean I worked at a restraunt and this is just insane. Drinks are empty and still waiting for food. Such awful service !  Update!!!!! The Gm tom got my alert and came over to apologize to me and my party. The fact that he took the time to completely apologize and help out with our order. They were busy and I understand that. Thank you so much the fact that you recognized the issue and took time out of your duties to help us with our order was completely nice of you. Thank you Tom! Ashley
Roger P.,"South San Francisco, CA",655,366,3614,4.0,10/29/2014,"I came back to give it another try. I have to say it's been a big improvement since I last came. The menu has changed, the service is prompt and my food was hot when it came! The menu has taken on more of a fresher look to it. The grilled chicken, the new choices of salads, just a nice refreshing choice of food items. I had a nice grilled chicken pasta. Juicy chicken with broccoli in a yummy Alfredo sauce. I'll be back to try the other items for sure"
Wayne Y.,"Daly City, CA",0,13,3,1.0,4/23/2017,"Ordered Gourmet Five Meat Deep Dish pizza. The only taste is salt. Ordered Crispy Calamari. The portion was really small; you can fit the calamari into a small McDonald's french fry bag. The calamari was barely warm, and was soggy, not crispy."
Oliver L.,"South San Francisco, CA",66,16,7,3.0,1/31/2016,"TL;DR Reviews! Happy Hour Review Pros: +Great craft beers. Jeremiah Red is my favorite +Good tasting food, for the price +Lots of TVs in the bar area. Great for sports +Free pizookie on your birthday Cons: -Customer service is a crapshoot. Has gotten worse over the years -Food is SLOW -Getting drinks can be slow too -Gets crowded, long wait at times for a table -Takes forever for a waiter to serve you when you arrive Tips: Flag down a waiter if you don't want to wait forever Go there if you have all the time in the world"
Caitlin T.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",318,43,43,1.0,2/13/2016,"Wow. Terrible experience. Food tasted as if it were made out of a box - I mean completely unpalatable. Mashed potatoes were tragic. ""Italiano penne pasta"" was confused. Calamari was rubbery. Sent one dish back. I could've made better food at home.  Needless to say, I will NEVER come back to this location. They totally ruined it for me."
Ringo M.,"San Francisco, CA",556,309,918,4.0,10/29/2014,"It was Game 4 of the 2014 World Series and the Giants were in a dire situation down 4-1 by the end of the 3rd inning. It was at this trying time, with morale low and beer warm, that the KC Royals pitchers decided to do an Oprah imitation... ""You get a HIT"" ""You get a HIT"" ""You get a HIT"" ""EVERY GIANT GETS A HIT!"" Blanco, PANIKtime, MVPosey, Panda, PenceIntense, Belt, Perez, and my fave Giant Brandon Crawford (aka Jon Snow) all got hits!  Suddenly, the beer was ice cold again, the pazookie sweet as ever, and I didn't even notice that there weren't enough cheese on the pizza. High fives were flying everywhere like Royals pop outs, and we were scoring runs faster than I could eat the Sampler. Some 20 TVs that surrounded the perimeters of BJ's were flashing a score that all of Bay Area wanted to see: ""Giants 11, Royals 4"" If you are considering BJ's for Game 7 tonight, I definitely recommend it. It'll take forever to get a table, but you can always grab a drink by the bar. Mike the bartender was helping me by the bar last time, and he was as awesome as the Giants victory. Time flies like a Home Run ball when you're watching the World Series and you'll get your table in no time. Here's to the Royals giving up hits like Oprah gave out cars for Game 7.  GO GIANTS!!!!!"
Cassidy P.,"Burlingame, CA",141,2,,1.0,11/29/2016,"C'mon bjs. Terrible bar service. I know there was 6 of us but our server could not be bothered. Again, I know it's busy and the bar is complicated but we got fully ignored. Seriously terrible. Good food and good happy hour horrible service."
Xuan C.,"San Francisco, CA",1697,375,437,5.0,6/5/2016,Their fried calamari is really good. Tuesday they have half off their wine collection. Needed it since being in the hair industry is stressful.
