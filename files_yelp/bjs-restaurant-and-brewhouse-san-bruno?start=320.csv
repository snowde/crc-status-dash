Joseph D.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,8,,4.0,8/8/2016,I will make this short and sweet: If you have come to this restaurant and have not had an enjoyable eating experience GIVE THIS RESTAURANT ANOTHER CHANCE. They have a new guy in charge at this restaurant (Eugene) he seems to have his act together and has a real concern about the people that come to Bj's. We had a great experience here and I recommend this restaurant.
John C.,"San Jose, CA",102,101,3,3.0,9/27/2016,"I stopped in for a quick lunch.  Sat at the bar and had a nice French Dip with grilled onions, mushrooms, and Swiss cheese.  Served with shoe string onions. It was pretty good.  A l;ittle peppery, but I enjoyed it"
Iris B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,,5.0,5/18/2017,"I made dinner reservations for a high-school baseball team of 20 and a group of 12 parents.  We arrived early but Efraim, the manager on duty, was able to quickly accommodate us.  I believe he helped with setting the tables and designated one or two waitresses for our party only.  They were friendly and patient and available when we wanted something.  Everyone was served in a timely manner and there were no mistakes with the orders.  The food was good, something for everyone, and Efraim stopped by to make sure everything was to our liking.  Upon our way out he came to say goodbye and thank us for our visit.  Super service, great food.  Thank you!"
Jeannie T.,"Milpitas, CA",65,73,20,5.0,2/5/2016,"I always have dinner at BJ's, so it's obvious that their food is amazing, but what makes me give this review a 5 stars is the server we had. AL was phenomenal! He took on a huge party of 40 for a gender reveal party on a busy Saturday afternoon! Not only did he get our orders correctly, but we looked forward to conversing with him the whole time we were there. If you go to BJ's, hopefully you get to sit where AL is serving. He should get promoted wink wink"
Kim C.,"Pacifica, CA",1,29,62,1.0,10/16/2016,Friend suggested this place. For some reason I really didn't want to but decided to just go. Very minimal service. Asked for the strongest drink on the menu and it was watered down. Calamari was extremely salty. My burger had no sauce in it so it was super dry. No mayo no ketchup or mustard. Just dry. It came with fries that tasted old and stale. I asked for ranch and it was just as watered down as my drink. I should've went with my gut and suggested a different place. Was not worth it eating here
Greta R.,"San Rafael, CA",60,522,57,5.0,2/25/2015,"We like the menu at BJ's but the five stars is for our server Al who was awesome.  He check in frequently, made good recommendations, etc - all with a brace on how wrist that made carrying beer not especially fun.   The BBQ chicken salad was excellent and the stuffed mushrooms we their usual yummy. I think it's the beer that brings is back to this chain on a regular basis.  It's not super creative, but it's just good solid beer.   My fav is the piranha pale ale."
M Andrea M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2016,"Where do I start? When we entered there was no one to greet us,  there was NO clean tables and the ones that were clean were closed, the bartender couldnt recommend a good fruity drink so he handed me a novel which is the menu and.its printed so small you cant read it. Now we have been to many BJs especially Stockton where the food is AWESOME and so is the service. We finally got a table with no help from the staff and was ready to order, OUR Server Rob showed up with the brightest smile and personality which made things much more bearable. The bathroom was disgusting and no stalls had toilet paper. This was the worse experience ever."
Carol C.,"Newhall, CA",88,18,6,4.0,1/8/2016,"Me and my friends always have gone to bjs to hangout and celebrate after grueling exams and also just for casual evenings. We have always had great service.  So when a family friend wanted to go out for their birthday we suggested this place. When checking in at the front we experienced a customer service hiccup that left us feeling a sour taste in our mouth, but when bringing it to the managers attention he was apologetic and quick to address it. Our waitress Jessica was awesome and so nice ! She was very attentive and always kept us hydrated. The food was good as usual and the best part was that we got to watch the basketball game on top of the birthday dinner. I would go again and would still recommend this place to others :)"
Rois L.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/11/2017,"It would have been nicer, which is I believe to be part of the customer service to check and ask the potential clients/customers if they needed help when they're standing there, looking so unsure and uneasy. I was standing in front and actually have fallen in line by the take out service area and I agree, I should have looked closely around and read whatever was written but I didn't. But then I patiently stood there until 2 of the people in front of me were done. I still patiently stood while the manager was speaking with one of the staff manning  the area. There was another staff on that same spot that wasn't saying anything and was just giving me side glances until I finally deicided to approach to ask if that is were I need to ask for seating. She pointed me to the direction of the one on the right side which clearly I didn't notice. It was btw so close by my right side while I was patiently waiting in line. I've been to other restaurants and bj's brewery restaurant in the Bay Area and the minute I walked in and stood there looking unsure, some staff will always approach to ask if I needed help. The bottom line, poor customer service and considering there were staffs available milling around while I was standing, no one bothered to ask while I try to give each and every one that look of someone needing assistance. It was so uncool and disappointing. I hope this feedback will help the management focus on how to improve their ratings."
Josh L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",28,276,71,2.0,3/9/2015,"Came for happy hour on Friday with some coworkers. We ordered one salad which was almost delivered to the wrong table (our server had to go back to the kitchen to get it). The presentation of the salad was terrible and it looked very skimpy on ingredients. We also ordered plain nachos, but ended up with a fritos/sour cream concoction (eventually the right order came out). I had the chicken wings, which were meh... they looked so small and weren't as meaty as before. The dipping sauces were watered down and had no consistency. Pizza wasn't bad and the servers were friendly. The kitchen staff needs more attention to detail and presentation."
Jayme N.,"Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA",3,12,,1.0,10/7/2016,"Seated before 5 pm on a Thursday and waited more than 20 mins with zero service even tho everyone around us got served, including 3 tables that came in after us. Approached a manger who basically shrugged it off. This location always has terrible service but this exceeded the usual."
Tim B.,"Novato, CA",70,278,8,4.0,3/4/2015,"So, after our wonderful excursion to Cambria we drove up Highway 1 to Carmel, then battled obnoxious traffic coming into Santa Cruz. At first I'd contemplating continuing following the coast to check out the newly constructed Devil's Slide tunnel just south of Pacifica. But the Big Sur experience had tested our patience - it being Presidents' Day, there was more than the normal share of touristy drivers - you know the type, not staying at any consistent speed. Or direction. Because of that we elected to travel Highway 17 to Los Gatos, then 85 to Mountain View where it intersects with Interstate 280, and then travelled up the Peninsula until we reached South San Francisco and got off at ""Interstate"" 380, all 2  1/2 miles of it. That proved too long as we exited that freeway at El Camino Real and thrust our car towards the legendary Tanforan Park. Back in the day Tanforan served as the quintessential aging 1950's/1960's mall, and by the early aughts it was playing that role in an unfortunate way, as tenants were deserting the shopping centers like Bill Cosby supporters. The powers that be decided that a renovation was in order, and by the time I returned in 2006 after a five year absence, I barely recognized the place. One can argue about the goods and evils of renovating the center, but I do think the addition of BJ's was a boon - before all the shopping center offered was food courts and a few forgettable cafes. Our 2006 trip to this location was the first BJ experience we had (insert juvenile joke here), although in the meantime we have also perused the Sacramento and San Rafael locations. This time, we arrived at about 2:30 - I was thinking it'd be rather quiet, but it was about 90% full. In spite of that, our service was prompt and professional. We each ordered from the light menu, and were satisfied for most of the rest of the day. Buffalo Bison Burger, baby! I guess my only criticism of this location is that I wouldn't be able to distinguish it from the other franchises - maybe there was something to highlight the fact that it was in South San Francisco as opposed to Sacramento, but I missed it.  And, you'd think that something with the word ""Brewhouse"" in its name would, you know, brew its own beer. Perhaps I'm naïve, however it is good that the place is reliable and consistent."
Gracie M.,"San Francisco, CA",29,2,1,5.0,5/4/2016,"5 STARS is definitely well deserved for the server we had tonight. :)  My little family has been a loyal customer since our son was a baby (and he's 6 now!). It's our favorite BJ's location and we have a lot of memories at this place like multiple birthday dinners, staff lunches, and family Sunday brunches. We often are lucky to always receive good service here, but tonight was GREAT SERVICE. Our server NICK H. was the best! It's our first time having him and let me tell you... he was just so genuinely nice, quick, and my family just enjoyed our time after a long, busy day. I'm a working mom from 7am-6pm so I'm always on the go and family dinners are so important to my family and me.... So when we get service like tonight, I'm not going to miss a chance to blog it (and I RARELY post)! Also, the new manager Tom was so pleasant to talk to. He has really good vibes and he even set my staff's dinner coming up with no hassle. Again, I love this place... My hubby loves it (especially the root beer!), and if my son loves it.. It's a done deal, we are coming here always. Lol  This place deserves more stars. Good food, good bar, great service, and fun location. Ask for Nick H..... AWESOME SERVICE for sure."
Aliza W.,"San Leandro, CA",93,67,38,1.0,4/2/2017,"this BJs needs some work . The wait was okay . The service  needs work as well im not sure if they were understaffed but just a little work on that maybe the experience would have been better  . Our waiter kept forgetting about our table and he got our order wrong as well . Eventually the manager came to help him . The food was okay . I got a vegan soup which was nice and hearty and a hot tea , great for a cold night ."
Kelly B.,"Daly City, CA",197,1,,1.0,11/9/2016,I usually never write reviews but tonight nick the dick deserve this one! I ordered a medium rare steak and got medium well.... when I told him to it was wrong he disappeared for a good hour and a half . Not only was my order wrong but the whole party's order was wrong. He wasn't around much to help us fix it. He didn't come to check on us. Another server is now taking care of us. We got here at 5:30 and it's now 8:32 and we are currently here because NICK sucked. We were sitting here for a good hour and a half with no service....
Debi L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,105,,4.0,12/22/2016,"Went here today for lunch with my mom. Being that I am a gluten-free girl, it's always a dilemma of where to eat (gluten is hidden everywhere, not just in bread). Low and behold, BJ's has gluten free items on the menu. Even better, they have gluten-free hamburger buns. This made my day so I ordered a burger. The burger was good. Instead of fries (yes, they can be gluten-filled if tossed in flour) I got a house salad instead. The salad was a good size and very good. My overall experience was great. Our waiter was also excellent. I would go back again. Also, the prices are very reasonable."
J L.,"Fremont, CA",25,27,4,1.0,1/4/2016,"Second visit to this location.   First was okay, food wise, but service was below part, but first day on the job.  This visit,  I would question if ANYONE working here has ever been in food service before.   What kind of ""Hostess"" puts a party of 10 in a section where the Wait Staff has been working  one day?  Adding auto tip for ""large party"" seems like just another was to scam consumers.  Doesn't it matter that TIP IS FOR SERVICE not an automatic ""gift""?  Especially when the order is wrong TWICE!??!   Auto tipping should be illegal but it does guarantee extra income.  Disappointing and costly  to say the least!"
Vanessa M.,"San Francisco, CA",35,4,1,1.0,10/29/2016,The worst service ever !!!! Came in at 9 and left at 11 just because my food didn't arrive until 10:25. Never
Tamara W.,"Lee's Summit, MO",0,1,,2.0,4/30/2017,"BJs is a busy place. The staff is nice and was extremely busy. The food was fair to ok. I ordered a well done bacon cheddar burger. The burger was pink throughout on an oversized bun with hints of aged lettuce. On the plus side, the Jamison Amber Ale was good."
Nicole F.,"San Bruno, CA",16,42,45,1.0,8/20/2016,"Terrible experience just now. I generally like BJ's, but I'm super irritated right now. My mom, fiance and I came and were told we'd have a 25-30 minute wait. That really ended up being only 15 minutes or so. We got seated outside in the mall seating area, waited about 10 minutes or more and nobody came. Then a waiter who noticed we'd been waiting came and said he'd get someone to check on us. Nobody came for another 10 minutes or more. I finally decided to leave. When a waiter saw us leaving, he apologized and said he could help us right after delivering a plate. Not his fault, but we declined. We were already tired of waiting over 30 minutes so left. Moral of the story, if they don't check on you within a few minutes, leave."
