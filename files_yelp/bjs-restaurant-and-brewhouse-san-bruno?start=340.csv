Bruce H.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",1,107,345,2.0,2/23/2016,"I eat a BJ's quite a bit when I'm on the road.   I dig there late night happy hour, and like the ambiance of sitting in a noisy sports bar when I'm away from home.  This location was pretty bad.  It took too long to get a waiter,  then they never returned to see if I wanted another drink.   I get the Ahi Poke  all the time.  The one I got here for starters,  looked like crap!  In addition,  the Ahi was cut too large and almost frozen.   This place seems disorganized and possibly under staffed. Recently was working in South Sacramento and had been going to the BJ's in Elk Grove....awesome service, fast, good food."
Stefany Z.,"San Francisco, CA",310,112,188,1.0,1/5/2016,"I've been to this BJ's location plenty of times but never took the time to review it. However, this past Sunday I experienced the worst customer service I have ever received at a restaurant, it bothered me enough for me to share with everyone.  Here's why I'm giving it 1 star after this past visit: 1) We waited 40 minutes to get seated on a Sunday night; we were a party of 3. 2) Our server, ""ALEXIS C."" looked as grim as ever when greeting us. It was a forced, ""I hate my job"" kind of greeting. From the start I knew it was going to be a bad experience. 3) We had to ask our server for everything, including plates for our appetizer, for which she looked bothered when asked. 4) THERE WAS AN ANT ON MY PLATE. And the server didn't even bother to apologize. Honestly, I always tip regardless of terrible service...but this was just overwhelmingly bad. My friends felt sorry for the girl, so they tipped for our party. That server did not deserve a tip. No matter how shitty things are in your personal life, you're at work and if you want to earn a good tip, you should be a good server. Period."
Shin T.,"San Bruno, CA",1,164,18,4.0,8/29/2016,Servers are kind. But the beer sampler came out luke warm. My complicated salad order came out right. All other dishes are delicious and perfect!
Audrey K.,"San Francisco, CA",179,285,303,4.0,1/2/2015,"this is my go-to place for american food! You can never go wrong with a menu full of selections. What I love is that they are consistently updating their menu here and there. I've tried many things, from appetizers, to salads, to pizza, pasta, and the delicious and oh so deadly desserts.  My go to appetizers would have to be spinach artichoke dip with chips, avocado spring rolls, calamari, and the bruschetta. My go to salad, is the crispy honey chicken, it's so deliciously good! (If I want to be on the healthier side haha) And go to entrees would be the chicken alfredo(sometimes it's done nicely, and sometimes it can be bland). Pizzaaaaaas are always deep dish! Because it's delish! Went with the bj's favorite, which consists of onions, olives, bell peppers, mushrooms, tomato, pepperoni, and sausages. It's so good and I normally dislike pizza, but when it's gourmet and deep dish.. I can't say no.  Can't forget about the dessert! ALWAYS, pizzokie. When I can't decide, I go for the trio(consists of 3 of your choice). But, established that the white chocolate macadamia is always going to be the number 1."
Ryan M.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2016,"This place smells terrible, like every beer in the world exploded on their floor and became rotten. We had to leave before we were even brought water. The smell was unbearable."
Alissa K.,"Burlingame, CA",0,22,2,1.0,10/15/2016,"This is the second consecutive time my fiancé and I have had a terrible experience at BJ's in San Bruno. Last year we came here quite often and never had any issues, in fact we used to quite enjoy it. However we both agree the service and food at this location have gone downhill significantly in recent months. To sum up today's lunch  experience: - slow, careless, rude service - flat, stale tasting beer - food so terrible we could barely eat any of our appetizer or entree I noticed we weren't the only guests that were frustrated & unsatisfied. If this place wasn't in such a highly-trafficked location, it would have no chance at surviving. We definitely won't be back."
Ale N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/24/2016,"Sad to say WE has a HORRIBLE experience here at BJ's.  My suggestion for every one wanting to stop by and eat here would be to just stop at Red Robbin. Your better of having a great family time and SERVICE!!  We had a family dinner last Friday. My sisters food never made it to the table. Our appetizers arrive FROZEN to the table, not once but twice!!! Horrible experience.  Lastly, the manager was not helpful at all. But ""our fryers must not be working properly"" I made this yelp account just to write this review.  Hope you all can see how disappointed we all were with this service and food!!!"
Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",124,506,,2.0,1/1/2016,Lukewarm avocado egg roll appetizer that was probably placed in the microwave before being brought to the table.  Lukewarm pizza supposedly straight from the oven. How can the pan be hot yet the cheese on the pizza is barely melted? All the toppings would fall off each time a slice was taken from the pan.  The only thing that was at the correct temperature was my wedge salad. -__- I've been here many times and I don't remember the food ever being this bad. Perhaps everyone was hungover from nye celebrations?  Service was alright for the most part.  Worst $40 spent on a meal to start 2016.
Jaymie G.,"Redwood City, CA",141,144,17,5.0,1/31/2016,"Not sure why this place has such a low rating.... Anyways! Came here on a Saturday afternoon for my friends gender reveal dinner. We had a party of about 40 people which was big enough to make service slow.  But that didn't happen!! Only thing that was ""slow"" was when we were actually getting our food. But come on! No one can bring out 40 plates at the same time. Lol.  Our server was AL.  He's the main reason I will come back to this establishment!  Talk about a man with a sense of humor!! I love it when you go out to eat and your server can laugh and just have a good time.  Not once did he give us an attitude about us asking for refills, to order more food, or bring out condiments (because let's face it, life would be too easy if we asked for everything at the same time. Lol) But really, AL was amazing! I recommend going here and requesting to sit in his section. I know I'll be back for a good laugh! Thanks AL!!!"
Brannon T.,"San Jose, CA",228,11,,1.0,8/22/2015,"So you may be wondering of why exactly I am giving BJs a 1 star review. Well basically, my girlfriend and I used to come here on a pretty regular basses even though every time we come, the service is literally the worst! Management I really hope you are reading this because I am sitting here right now, 20 minutes after being sat, our waiter still has not greeted us. This happens every time we come here. I go to a lot of BJs in the South Bay and never have this problem. The wait staff is rude, don't know the menu, ignore you when you are trying to get their attention, and this is the best one. Countless times when we want to order and our waiter is no where to be found and we ask the hostess to get our waiter or waitress, we ALWAYS get an eye roll. We stopped coming here because of the completely awful service even through the food is good. I hope you read this review to your staff at line up as I too were in the industry for awhile in order to put them in check or something. If you want to talk more feel free to message me, but this has seriously got to stop!"
Katie N.,"San Francisco, CA",106,82,82,2.0,7/29/2016,"This place is almost always extremely crowded, especially if it's a big game night because they have TVs. Expect at least a 30 min wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The service here is hit or miss, if you decide to sit in the open seating outside expect to wait a LONG time. What really stinks is that my order has been wrong at least once when brought to the table, but if you're craving a burger and fine with waiting to be seated and have your order taken then sure why not come here."
Carina M.,"San Francisco, CA",519,357,29,3.0,9/10/2014,"I like BJ's for a drink - especially a beer and to catch some sports television  However, with drinking, especially beer, one gets hungry! I just don't really like the food choices here - for the price, I feel like I'm eating way overpriced frozen food :/  What I do like is 1. parking is free (yay) 2. lots of parking 3. lots of space 4. tv's with games of all types on 5. beer selection"
Discourser T.,"Daly City, CA",1,32,,1.0,10/25/2015,"My wife and I stopped to grab an early dinner on October 25. After a brief wait, we were seated in the back room. Our server appeared and said he would be with us in a few minutes. No big deal since we were both looking at the menu. He came back about five minutes later saying he was going to check on our drinks. I looked up at an obviously ""high"" employee and informed him we hadn't ordered anything. He mumbled something and left, returning a few minutes later with napkins for drinks.  We ordered two waters and an iced tea. Since we were ready to order our meal we went ahead. We ordered tomato bisque in a bread bowl, an arugula beet salad, a flat bread pizza, and Mediterranean chicken tacos.  Five minutes later an expediter arrived with a bowl of tomato bisque and a visibly dirty spoon. A second expediter arrived in the heels of the first with our salad.  I was slightly irritated that our order was wrong. Mind you, I had heard the three surrounding tables complain that their orders were wrong as well. The manager had already come over to smooth over issues at one table. My wife could not get our server's attention and went to the bar to get an employee.  The employee tracked down the manager who never was able to find our table. In the meantime, our ""high"" server made it to our table where I explained what we had ordered, requested it be filled correctly, and to bring clean silverware.  By that time we were both frustrated with the lack of ability to take and fulfill an order, being waited on by a clearly intoxicated employee, and the failure of the manager to come to our table after being requested not once but twice by the same employee. We left our table and informed the host stand of why we were leaving. Not so much as effort to get the manager. It would appear this is a regular occurrence.  This BJ's has been a toilet for some time and I will never step foot in this one again. I will also alert anyone who is interested in the pathetic service and poor cleanliness of this location."
Akayla C.,"San Francisco, CA",480,14,25,3.0,6/30/2016,"BJ's is my go to favourite place- however, I'm really upset that they changed the happy hour regulations. I use to be able to order from the Happy Hour menu in the dining area but now it's only if you're seating at the bar area."
Robert G.,"San Francisco, CA",13,4,,1.0,10/1/2016,"Horrible service one bartender ignored me completely the other looks like Uncle Si from duck dynasty , the standards employers have set is why our work force is what it is SmH calamari was horrible left half the plate"
Elaine Y.,"San Francisco, CA",455,860,1388,3.0,7/1/2013,"BJ's has a very large menu (upwards of 15 pages) and serves a real hodgepod of items ranging from Asian fusion entrees to more traditional surf & turf dishes. Many of the dishes are calorie-heavy, so watch out.  I've come here multiple times and some of my choices were real hits while others were just mediocre. This particular time, I ordered a bison burger and subbed the coleslaw for a watermelon arugula salad.  My salad did not have arugula...it was a spring mix of spinach and red leaf lettuce topped with cubed watermelon and feta cheese. I found the mix very tasty. As for my burger, I ordered it medium, but it was definitely overcooked and almost tough to eat. I tried a bit of my mom's thai chicken mango salad. That was delicious. It had mangoes, avocado, sesame seeds, and a mix of bell peppers. Yum. I also tried a little bite of my dad's pulled pork sandwich. It was swimming in BBQ sauce, not really my thing. My brother had the chicken fried steak...it was a HUGE plate. It also definitely looked like a piece of steak compared to other places that serve it as a deep fried hamburger. It came with 2 large pieces served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of steamed zucchini and cauliflower. All in all, BJ's in comparable to the Cheesecake factory...but features some more unique dishes. It's also just a tad cheaper."
Natali R.,"Daly City, CA",9,56,20,4.0,10/28/2015,"My boyfriend, dog, and I go here very often as it is close to his home and it has outdoor seating with a fire pit and heater lamps. Food is always good. I love that they have a late happy hour. I enjoy their avocado egg rolls and craft beers (Jeremiah Red is a good one). Staff is mostly friendly but not always. Depends on who you get. Our food and beverages arrive in a timely manner.  On one occasion, my boyfriend and I went alone and sat inside. We ordered a pizza and a couple beers. The chef comes out a few moments later to explain that his staff burned our pizza just a little bit on one of the edges. He said that he is making a brand new one himself and that he did not want to send something unacceptable out. Wow! We were impressed. He said they would offer us a discount for the delay. Great, thanks! We probably would have taken the slightly burned pizza, but it was nice to know he cared! I would hate to ever run into a problem here, because I love it!"
tori c.,"Oakland, CA",53,5,5,1.0,9/27/2016,Went for lunch for the first time with my team the service was awful we waited over 45 minutes for a meal they were only 4 people the restaurant was not that busy our food came out cold they overcharged us won't make that mistake again
Amber U.,"Vallejo, CA",74,94,57,5.0,5/16/2016,"I love this place. We came for the GSW game early to get seats around 4:30. Wanted to Pregame a little! Had happy pizzas and beers, mmmmm so tasty! But right as game time comes the TV we are closest to changes to a hockey game... WTH?!!! Asked our waiter to change it, he had to ask the manager. Thankfully she came over and we mentioned how long we've been waiting to see the game. Not to mention 90% of the customers had Warriors gear on.... Had it changed back to Warriors. All is well in the world! Thank you, much appreciated!"
Uel L.,"Fairfield, CA",45,99,205,4.0,8/15/2015,I always come here for one reason. To eat their calamari and the ahi poke. They also have that pork chops and rib eye steak that my family loves to eat. Their clam chowder and tortia soup are their best in my opinion. I don't get tired ordering my favorite food if I'm in the vicinity.
