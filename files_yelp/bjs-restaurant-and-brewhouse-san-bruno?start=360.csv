Chris L.,"Portland, OR",105,690,65,2.0,12/11/2015,"Ugh, why did we come here after seeing the Yelp reviews.  Probably because there wasn't anything else better at the mall.  Anyway, the menu is huge and truly impossible to navigate & decide on what to get.  Ultimately I opted for just a basic burger, which was just meh.  The side salad was actually pretty tasty, but that did not make up for the mediocre foods nor the sub-par burger.  A silver lining is the baked cookie with ice cream (I called these skillet cookies), which was quite tasty.  But I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."
Gee M.,"Vallejo, CA",13,44,25,1.0,8/25/2016,If i could give this place zero stars I would. Our server seemed cool got us our first drinks...the food...cold food....no utensils ketchup or parmessan cheese or red pepper...after we asked for them. We asked for these things again and a refill on our drinks...he goes on break girl covering brings them over i ask for a box...she never comes back so I can ask for the check...check out my reviews i never really say anything negative but no this place has awful service...never coming back. The manager discounted everything but my two beers which is fine but still no not this bjs anytime soon.
Joe P.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/22/2016,"Came in for a quick lunch after running around in the mall.  My wife and I were seated pretty quickly since it was after lunchtime around 2pm.  The server took our order fairly quickly after serving us the water and lemonade we asked for as drinks.  My wife ordered the spaghetti and meat balls, and I the 'midnight burger'. As we waited for our food, a few minutes go by and we asked our server to add an appetizer, queso dip to our order.  No problem so far. We waited, and waited, and close to 30 minutes had gone by and no food, no queso either.  Then another person helping the server brings our food to the table.  No queso.  We asked about the appetizer, and the original server is asking us what we ordered?  We simply said no need for appetizer anylonger since food was here already. The seemed to have misplaced our appetizer order. The burger was still warm, but the spaghetti and meatballs were cold, so my wife asks the server to please reheat it.  The server takes the dish away.  Meanwhile, I am now eating by myself as my wife sitting across from me watches.  I eat slow waiting for the spaghetti to return.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Server comes by and says the dish will be brought out by the manager.  Waiting.  Waiting. Server finally brings the dish back, no manager.  My wife now begins to eat, meanwhile I am done and its my turn to watch her eat.  Shame, we were supposed to have lunch together.  Server says the manager will be by soon to chat with us.  Waited. And waited some more. Enough. Asked the server for check.  Paid the check and even tipped her (not as much as I would have otherwise).  On way out, the manager was by the door, I told him to read Yelp this afternoon about our experience.  The manager claimed he was not ware of this.   As we began to leave, on the way out, three servers by the door overhear my comment about Yelp.  One of them very pronouncedly began snipping and making remarks about Yelp, and making fun of both my wife and I. We quickly re-entered the restaurant and faced the person, whom quickly left toward the back.  We asked for the manager, and explained the treatment we as customers received by the servers representing BJ's.  I asked the manager to have the server come out and apologize to my wife.  To their credit, the manager and the server both apologized.   Its one thing to have mediocre service, and another to ridicule paying customers.  To the manager we wish best of luck.  To the disrespectful young server, we wish you well too.   We too were young once.   Hopefully we all learned something today...me, to rethink patronizing this BJ's ever again."
Jeff S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,47,,2.0,11/4/2015,This place has really gone downhill. Seems like management has lost control of their staff or they haven't trained them properly. The wait times for food are ridiculous lately and the last time i was there they completely screwed up our orders. I always get great service at the bar though.
Jia A.,"South San Francisco, CA",9,32,5,1.0,10/12/2015,"I haven't been here for a couple years, and BJ's never fails to disappoint me... Why did I go back? BECAUSE AGAIN JACK'S WAS CROWDED. Why do I keep making the same mistake?!  Here are my issues: - I ordered one of the lunch specials. It came with a salad of your choice plus a personal one topping pizza. When I started to eat the Caesar salad, the lettuce was wilted, rotten, soggy, and not crisp. Yum. Wtf?! So I sent it back. When I received it the second time, there was no difference. And by that time, I was over it. My pizza was honestly whatever.  - My mom ordered the chicken wings. They were SALTY AF and way overcooked and dry. - My boyfriend ordered the BBQ plate, which isn't even worth reviewing. The fries were the best part. -The service still sucks.  So over this place."
Kanoa U.,"South San Francisco, CA",98,86,367,2.0,9/18/2015,"I've been there a few times a typically they are fine. But I ordered their kale and Brussel sprouts salad and it just had the Brussel sprouts in it (with other things) but when I told the waiter that they didn't have any kale in this just lettuce and arugula, the waiter assured me that the arugula was their kale. In what world is arugula kale? I was so shocked by his genuine response that I couldn't even argue with him. Somehow he genuinely convinced my friend that I ate with.  When he left I pulled out my phone to show my friend what kale actually looks like and what arugula looks like. Anyways maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of this than I should... But if I order a specific salad, I'm hoping to get what's on it. That wasn't really what made this a 2.  The pizza was really bland. It was their ""most popular"" combo one we ordered. I love pizza, and I actually try not to judge a place too hard on it, although I've had decent pizza from BJ's before. That was the most disappointing part. Not sure what's going on over there but I hope they can turn it around. If you're going to grab a beer and watch the game, then it's probably fine, otherwise maybe just stick to their pizookies (pazookie... Or however you spell it). #Disappointed"
Steve J.,"San Francisco, CA",12,22,20,4.0,2/7/2015,"This place brings back the delicious memories from childhood of devouring a deep dish personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut - I mean that in the best possible way.  Bear in mind, I wouldn't touch Pizza Hut today unless I was absolutely desperate. But 20+ years ago, Pizza Hut deep dish was the best! I've been here three times now, and each time I've tried a different Deep Dish. The Veggie continues to remain my favorite - the the buffalo chicken is a close second.  To top it off, this place has a nice in house craft beer selection. My wife and I split two full flights (4 lights and 4 darks). I've consistently landed on the Oasis Amber as my favorite.  Service is on par. The Pizza will take a bit before it comes out to the table (maybe 30-45 min) - but that's always a good sign IMO."
LON B.,"Oakland, CA",1,14,,1.0,9/16/2015,"Very poor service, i ordered my meal, it took 30 min to come, and when it did the waitress threw it at me. I had done nothing, when i complained to the Mrg about it he said there was nothing he could do. This is the only Bj this has happened to me."
Gabe M.,"Bloomington, MN",0,6,,5.0,3/15/2016,"Me and my family ate at this restaurant yesterday before leaving to fly home from the San Francisco bay area. What first drew us to BJ's was the attractive building. We were not even planning on going to BJ's (we were on our way to Red Robin) and I saw the attractive brick building with great landscaping and a cool, shiny beer vat outside. I said, ""Ooohh! Look! That place looks good!"" So we made a split second change and tried BJ's. And it was a great choice! Food was hot, tasty, and came out in a timely manner. Our server, Matt was AWESOME!! I haven't had many servers as genuine and as caring as Matt was. His hospitality sure as heck was not forced, but very, very genuine and real. He was at our table every few minutes checking in on us, asking if we needed refills, or if he could get anything else for us. He even had around 4-5 other tables while having us, a table of 6. But he treated us like we were his only table! He even gave us a free giant cookie to share before leaving California. He set an EXCELLENT first impression of BJ's for us! Thank you, Matt!"
Francisco G.,"San Francisco, CA",46,53,1,1.0,11/3/2015,"Hella expensive, rude service, just straight shit. Unless you want a cold burger and cold fries for $50 bucks I recommend McDonalds. It's like they just stopped trying and knew you would pay just on location alone.  I mean they don't even wipe the tables off anymore."
Carlamae R.,"Burlingame, CA",27,42,9,1.0,9/4/2015,"Ugh I do not know why we come here.  Maybe cause of the pizookies.  But service sucks. Got here at 8pm, it is now 10:30... We are just sitting here waiting for our bill to be given to us. Not like we are a party of 12.. Its only us 2.  Food is meh. Service is horrible.  Pizookies i love."
Chelsea C.,"Yolo, CA",0,17,1,1.0,11/26/2016,"I love BJs but this place has one of the worse service ever. The guy hardly checked on us. We were literally done with our main meals and waited for 15-20mins before our server came by to check on us. He forgot he ranch after asking 3x. Ordered an extra side of fries when I asked for just an extra side of ranch and charged us for it. Forgot about my friends order who had a pazookie that came with her meal. Waited 10mins for our dessert. Another 10-15mins to get her dessert. Never refilled our drinks till the very end, asking us and we were done with our meal. He was no existent. We literally stayed there for a 2 hours when it should've been only 1 hour. Horrible. It's the holidays so I won't say our servers name but I hope he gets reprimanded for the crappy service he gave us."
Alvin J.,"San Francisco, CA",236,79,211,2.0,6/16/2014,"Our family came here on Father's Day (since our father craved pizza).  There was about a 30-min wait when we arrived around 1pm, but that was expected.   The hostess (w/glasses) was nice, warm, smiley, and accurate with our estimated wait time and once our hand indicator lit/buzzed - we were off to be seated.  That day had a give-away.  All the men at the table were given a beverage glass commemorating Father's Day.  I thought that was very nice! We did have a few mishaps during our lunch.  The first one was that the booth wasn't entirely wiped down and clean.  That was a bit awkward.  One side still had come crumbs and grease on the bench.  So we had to wait for them to get a rag to clean that off for us.   Once seated, we decided to order three pizzas: Gluten-free thin crust pizza; w/artichoke hearts, roasted garlic, and cilantro Hand-tossed pizza - BJ's Classic Combo (Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms) Deep Dish pizza: Chicken Bacon Ranch (Grilled garlic chicken, Applewood smoked bacon, jack and cheddar cheese, red onions, diced tomatoes and a drizzle of ranch dressing. While waiting, we were brought our drinks and soon after our plates. The second mishap was that the plates they brought were still dirty.  It may have run through their dishwasher, but there were dried up cheese residue on a couple plates and specks of ""I don't know what"" on another.  The waiter promptly replaced them after I addressed it.  This time, the plates were perfectly clean and spotless.  We had a well-mannered and polite waiter. It wasn't too long a wait for all the pizzas.  Looked good, but I didn't hear any ""mmmms"" during the meal.  I was average at best....but not terrible.  The deep dish tasted more like a pan-style pizza and had some crispy edges similar to Pizza Hut.  That had good flavor. The hand-tossed was a bit disappointing though.  It was as plain as it gets and the crust was flat in both texture and taste.  It reminded me of carnival pizza.  I didn't try the gluten-free pizza (which was for my mother).  She said that it tasted fine, but they forgot the cilantro topping.  That was the third and last mishap. I did notify the waiter who offered to sprinkle it on, but I just asked him to take it off the bill which he did. The place itself had high ceilings, nice crowd, and lots of TV screens for World Cup coverage and the Giants game.  Also - nice that there's a B&N next door. I really really really wanted to give a basic 3-stars, but there were just too many mishaps and I feel I need to rate based on my overall BJ experience yesterday.  However, minus the mishaps - I'd give it 3 stars."
Amy K.,"Santa Clara, CA",41,8,11,1.0,1/27/2016,"Slow slow slow too SLOW!!  I came here with three other girls for lunch...  We even ordered ahead for 11 o'clock...  We got one salad by 11:40 am and the others came 10 min later......Our waitress, of course, brought the pizookies at the same time as our food... with three spoons. We asked for an additional spoon, and she disappeared for 45 minutes........ Don't even get me started on the time we had to wait for one to go box and our check..... At the end, the only thing we wanted was getting out of here."
Mike L.,"San Francisco, CA",1140,1142,1765,3.0,10/18/2012,"Generally speaking, I try to avoid chain restaurants if/when I can.  It's not because I think their food is terrible (although it can be at a few places), but rather a preference to go somewhere unique...and likely better.  The two places I'd make the occasional exceptions for?  Cheesecake Factory and BJ's (insert dirty joke here). While I generally don't expect much from chain restaurants, the food at BJ's isn't too shabby (Cheesecake Factory is better though).  Granted, I've only tried a few things, but it' has been better than what little I've had from places like Chili's and TGI Friday's.  While taking in a Giants game after work, my friend and I decided to split an order of the Artichoke Dip appetizer and the BJ's Favorite Pizza (oven baked meatballs, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions, and roasted tomatoes). Compared to the Artichoke Dips I've tried at other chains, this one wasn't all that different ( ).  The dip was a little salty and rich, but I can't complain with the amount of cheese they threw in, nor the amount of chips they gave us.  As for their pizza, it's probably the best bet for something good ( ).  The dough was a little fluffy, but not overly so, and I liked the mix of ingredients (it's essentially a combination topping pizza).  Perhaps it was a little heavy on the tomatoes and salt, but no worse than some other pizza joints out there.  Really, no complaints. With a solid beer selection (both outside and house brews) to go with their decent food menu, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to making future trips back to BJ's (especially since Gordon Biersch is gone).  A beer, pizza, and a giant TV to watch whatever game is on?  Sounds good to me (especially if my team wins).  Too bad there always seems to be a long wait for a table though."
Sandy N.,"Presidio, San Francisco, CA",0,84,3,3.0,11/20/2016,"If I saw my restaurant with less than 3 stars I would take action.  Service has always hit and miss for speed and attentiveness.  This day we sat for 10 minutes before our server arrived.  Don't sit in the back of the restaurant it smells like a urinal, tho the bathrooms are quite a distance away.  But please rework your system I can imagine your staff doesn't stay long."
Johnny B.,"Reno, NV",57,362,76,2.0,10/13/2015,"I've never been so disappointed in service at a BJ's brewery as I have when visiting this location. It took over an hour to get our food from when we placed our order. We watched other people that arrived and ordered after us receive their food which was really frustrating. Had we lived in this town we would have just left and not waited. Unfortunately, we were from out of town and weren't familiar with the area which is what brought us here in the first place. I will give credit where credit is due, the manager did come out and at least acknowledge that it was an unreasonable amount of time that we waited for our food. He offered us a Pizookie on the house, I countered with what I thought was a fair resolution and he obliged. The food was still decent, once it finally arrived. Saved them from a 1 star review. I won't ever return to this BJ's."
Jackson L.,"San Francisco, CA",3,5,3,1.0,7/24/2015,"Vegetarian gets rash from Portobello Burger. Poor service overall As a vegetarian, I was very limited by my options. When I ordered the vegetarian-friendly Portobello Mushroom Burger, I bit into it and found a piece of beef patty in it. Immediately, I asked my waitress to check on my burger. I asked her, ""Is this beef? She confirmed it, and I told her that menu said the burger was vegetarian-friendly and only include mushrooms. She responded, ""No, it's not,"" and walked away without honoring my complaint.  I will not return to this restaurant.  If a vegetarian cannot order the only thing the menu that's vegetarian, then something is not right with the restaurant.  The $12 Portobello Burger gave me a rash."
Kai S.,"Daly City, CA",90,97,18,4.0,12/29/2015,"I've given this place a lot more chances lately & I honestly feel like the way that this place is set up now a days is so much better than it was in the past. I've received great service one evening from Camila R. and another from the server Tyler in the last couple of months.  Their service alone made me completely want to change my review on yelp from one star to a whopping 4 star review. Whenever I was seated, it did not take more than 10 minutes to wait, the food came out as fast as possible, and I felt very attended to while I was dining once with my best friend, and once with my entire family.  Both experiences were great!  I've stuck with the same dish for the longest time: Parmesan Crusted Chicken with Garlic Mashed Potatoes & Broccoli & i always get the pizzookie trio at the end of my meals, especially to share. I've not once in the last few times I've come here felt like my food was subpar or there was anything wrong with it.  My only complaint would be a question, WHY TAKE OUT THE BAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE SIDE :'( I loved getting that to pair with my meals, but I'll definitely live without it haha. I just was sad to see that it wasn't on the menu anymore.  Besides that small factor, I'm very pleased with how my service was at this location and look forward to the next time I go to BJ's in San Bruno!"
Riana C.,"San Francisco, CA",243,196,14,4.0,11/9/2015,"The food is standard BJs. This location seems to be consistently busy so make reservations! Had something happen with one of the orders in our large group, but management handled the situation very very well. Great to see customer service as a priority and management that takes the time to reach out to clients."
