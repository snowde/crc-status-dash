Jane S.,"San Bruno, CA",0,18,,5.0,8/6/2016,"I really like Bjs. I live right across the street so I like to come here often to have drinks with friends. But it can get a little pricey sometimes... I love their jeremiah red beer & most of their appetizers! My last visit here, my waiter was so great & attentive; his name was Billy & I also had a great conversation with one of the managers, her name was Rochelle; she was so cute & fun!!! I always a great experience at Bjs! So I don't understand the low rating! Cmon people! ;)"
Nicholas M.,"Orlando, FL",670,27,43,2.0,3/4/2016,"The reviews are true. Service is painfully bad with the food being somewhat decent. We had to beg the waitress to take our app. plates off the table, food came really slow, water came even slower.  If I do come back, it will only be for the dessert."
Maria C.,"San Francisco, CA",104,15,6,4.0,10/17/2015,"I see this place has got some not-so-hot reviews.  I've always had a good experience here; but I feel like you gotta know some things.   1st this place is ALWAYS busy! So if you come during regular hours or with a big party, expect to wait. I generally come here with my BF and we always come after 9pm. We've never had to wait for a table.   2nd we almost always order the same thing: avocado egg rolls, the BJ's Classic pizza and the Southern Fried chicken; we've never been disappointed! If you know when to come and what to order, this place is pretty good!!"
Octavia B.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,4,1,5.0,3/20/2015,John the manager was amazing! They have a really great team and I can see why! Alicia the server did a great job at making sure my order was correct and I am so happy with that because that's really hard to come by! Overall everything was great and if you want to go to a BJs come to the one in San Bruno! They are truly awesome!! Sincerely a well more than satisfied customer :):):):)
Karleen T.,"San Francisco, CA",14,4,1,5.0,4/21/2016,Always a pleasure to come here! The staff is always kind. Never have to wait for more then 5 minutes and super fast service!!
Nicole B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,1,5.0,1/30/2016,Miguel was are waiter and he had really good customer service and made our time at here great. The food was good too.
Samantha K.,"San Francisco, CA",25,14,3,1.0,5/15/2014,"Look at the last picture, a friend ordered calamari to go, she got a little ways through and then looked at the piece she had just bitten into.....there was blue gunk oozing out of it. Long story short, she has been in the hospital with Food Poisoning. BJ's you are REVOLTING!"
Ashley L.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,9,1.0,8/30/2016,"Rocky was super unpleasant as a server. Not only did he get the order wrong, he charged twice for an item that took 20 mins longer than the rest of the food to come. Once we made him aware of the double charge, he then SNATCHED the receipt from my mom's hand. Rude! He also thought it was important for us to know he ""is being sent home early"" and someone else is taking over. That is no way to transition your customers from one server to another. Quite frankly, I understand why he was being sent home and why the other server was taking over. It's too bad it wasn't before he started serving us."
Mom Of T.,"Visalia, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/13/2016,"Veryyyyyy poor service tonight.  Wait was so long and there were lots of empty tables.  Got out food and my med rare steak was almost well done and the tacos with no cilantro were covered in it.  We politely brought it to the servers attention and all he said ""ok"" and walked off."
Nile A.,"Carlsbad, CA",213,102,32,2.0,5/19/2014,"If you live in the area and you're looking for a place to meet up with some friends and grab a beer, then it works. But if you're looking to sit down and have an enjoyable meal, forget it. Service sucks and food takes forever to come. So disappointed I almost want to say I'm never coming back but.. Pizookies!"
Frank C.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",103,14,9,1.0,7/28/2016,"One of the worst BJS restaurant Ever .. I was waiting with my brother in law and my nephew who's 2 years old only .. They let us wait for over 45 minutes because they didn't  have a table for him ( ""a chair for him"") So stupid .. When he is just 2 Years old .. How sad this place is ! Just the waiter "" Taylor M "" saved the customer service in this place !"
JD G.,"Austin, TX",318,182,52,3.0,7/24/2015,"This place is ALWAYS packed and the experience is never that great. It starts out in the crappy mall parking lot that needed to be re-surfaced 10 years ago, with no parking. Once you're actually able to make it inside, you have to wait forever to get sat. This would be understandable at most popular restaurants as they can't seat everyone at once, but when you do get sat eventually, you realize that the reason you've been waiting for an hour is because the kitchen takes an hour to even bring out your food once you order it. I went with a couple friends and after telling us the wait was 30 minutes, it ended up being an hour. The greeters were apologetic about it, and once we were sat, the server was very friendly. We ordered our food and waited...and waited...and waited. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is pre-made, with fries. My friends also ordered entrees that would have been pre-prepared so there was really no reason for the wait. What made it worse was once I got my sandwich, it had maybe a spoonful of pulled pork on it. I never ask for a manager but I did to ask if that was a normal portion for that meal, and he took one look at it and before I even said what was wrong, he apologized and took it back to get a larger portion, which took another 15 minutes. He was extremely apologetic and, while I didn't ask for any compensation, he gave me my meal for free. The pulled pork, though, was amazing! And the fries are so good as well...definitely some of my favorite fries of any restaurant (except McDonald's of course). I've been to this location several times and the experience has always been similar (friendly staff but long waits). I like the food, but the experience keeps me away unless my friends are hellbent on eating here."
Tyler H.,"San Francisco, CA",193,131,6,2.0,12/4/2015,"It had been a bucket list item of mine to actually visit a BJ's, and I'm beyond disappointed. Our server meant well, but was just inexperienced and poorly trained. Took a long time to take our order, bring us drinks, etc. It was the middle of the day, not too busy and I was in a party of six. They completely forgot the order of a college. By the time his food came out we had all finished. Even after we paid, all of our dirty dishes were still our table and it was just a mess. We walked away and saw the dirty dishes piled up from the people next to us who were leaving as we sat down. Such a poor experience. I'd rather go to Subway."
Alexis B.,"Alameda, CA",264,9,2,5.0,5/21/2016,"Jasmine, I think that's what she said her name was, was the sweetest person there! She was definitely very helpful and charming. I give her 5 stars!!!"
Ahmad K.,"Daly City, CA",15,7,9,1.0,2/5/2016,"This location is the worst place I have ever been in.. BJ's is known to be great.. Food always tastes good.. However the front disk at this location is awful, unwelcoming & total waste of time.. They always lie to you about the time u need to wait.. & even after you wait longer you get someone rude to tell u ""Well we paged ur waiting device but you wasn't here"".. This is not one time thing.. This is like something I know I will have to deal with every time I go with my children.. I done with this location today.. I will make sure everyone I know will hear my story.."
Shaun E.,"Milwaukee, WI",499,298,680,2.0,6/29/2015,"Great atmosphere! The service was wonderful! The employees were so, so nothing special. Food was ok."
Cassie T.,"Western Addition/NOPA, San Francisco, CA",422,101,142,4.0,10/5/2014,"I really have no complaints for this restaurant. Good food and good service! I shared calamari with 3 other people, then split a Black and Bleu burger (so good!) and the Cajun shrimp pasta (even better) with someone and spent about $20 including tax and 20% tip. Not super expensive, and pizookies are always a good dessert!!!"
Melissa C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,7,1.0,8/5/2016,"First off, BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants and I absolutely love the food (especially the pizookies). However, today was not a good day for them. I placed a to go lunch order online at 11:30am and indicated a 12:15pm pick up. I got the BBQ pork sandwich with a side salad. I figured 45 minutes would be enough for one sandwich. WRONG! I got there at 12:10 and was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes, because there were several large orders ahead of mine. I did not leave BJ's with food in hand until 12:55. It took them AN HOUR AND A HALF to cook my one sandwich and a small salad. There were two groups of people ahead of me and each bad 10-15 entrees PER group. So I had to wait while 20-30 entrees were prepped ahead of my ONE sandwich.  While I absolutely understand the importance of making orders as they come in, this was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. One sandwich should not have taken an hour and a half to get to a guest. I waited to arrive to pick up my food for 45 minutes, and then I waited another 45 minutes in the restaurant. Not cool. The only plus is that the employee at the take out counter was friendly and kept apologizing and volunteering to go check on my food for me. I will not do a to go order again here."
Joyce B.,"Daly City, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/16/2016,"Service was extra slow today, not sure why since it was after the lunch rush. Asked for a free pizookie since I have rewards from the app, took about 30 minutes or longer to get it sent to the table. I also had to ask for a booster seat 3 times before one was brought to my table.  Server was rude as hell. My aunt had asked for some sugar and the server's response was, ""I asked you earlier if you wanted some and you said no."" WHAT THE HELL? You don't ever respond to a customer like that. Suck it up and bring the damn sugar. It's not my fault you signed up for this job! I won't be coming back here."
Donna L.,"San Francisco, CA",78,161,223,3.0,9/22/2015,we had the deep dish pizza and other appetizers a couple of weeks ago.  The drinks and apps were fine.  The deep dish pizza tasted like baked bread with toppings on it.  I prefer to have my crispy crust.  oh well.
