Kathryn Y.,"San Bruno, CA",19,228,1179,4.0,9/9/2017,"My boyfriend and I went here for a date night. We haven't been here in ages and it did not disappoint. We shared a deep dish pizza and then did the pizookie trio. Food was delicious, our waiter was terrific and was on top of things. This was definitely better than previous experiences. We'll be back."
Circadian R.,"San Francisco, CA",39,17,2,5.0,9/9/2017,"The location, service, and food was excellent.  I'm a celiac and was scared to order. Food was delicious.   I'm posting this 3 days later to say my stomach hasn't hurt and I haven't had any symptoms. They really make sure that cross contamination doesn't happen!"
Erik C.,"San Francisco, CA",78,8,1,4.0,12/22/2017,This place is always busy regardless what time you arrive. Of the many visits that I have had the shortest wait time was about 20 minutes with an hour being the longest. The food itself is very good especially the deep dish pizza that they have. The burgers are okay but a little dry for my taste. The price is also a little bit high for the quality of the food. I do feel like they make up for this with their happy hour specials that they have. The happy hour specials make it so that when you go eat with a group of friends or family you won't break the bank. The atmosphere of this place feels fast paced with multiple TVs around the restaurant and a small bar that gets rather full very quickly making it a little bit difficult to find seating in this area. Overall not a bad place to eat at all. All my experiences have been great
J M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,115,192,4.0,4/27/2017,"I figure I left my two star review on here long enough, since it was all about a disappointing hamburger, which I won't order again.  But since then, I've eaten many different menu items, most with satisfying results. My favorites are the thick and juicy pork chop, the weekend prime weekend special and the spare ribs.  I also like the buffalo wings as an appetizer.   Other good dishes are the shrimp and mahi mahi tacos and the Californian grilled chicken with avocado sandwich.  Service is typically above average, with few exceptions. And sometimes the food delivery is not spaced well, but it's not a perfect world either.  I still come often, so that says a lot."
Raina S.,"El Granada, CA",386,567,340,1.0,8/29/2017,"Wow, the food here is just awful.  It fuels my theory that, the bigger the menu, the harder it is to make anything very well. Service was a bit odd.  Our first server walked up to our table and just stood there.  No, ""Hi, my name is...""  nothing.  Her shift ended after she took our order and another person took over.  He was a bit of an improvement.  My husband had a burger.  He didn't like it, but ate some.  My daughter got a French Dip.  The meat was cold.  I asked her if she wanted something else, but she opted to got with no food over bad food.  I ordered the cauliflower tacos.  I don't see this often on menus but when they are done well they're delicious.  No surprise, here, BJ's doesn't do veggie tacos well.  Very little flavor, and the veggies were past their prime. Their beer is decent, hence the star.  I got a blond ale.  The flavor was better than I'd expected.  I wish I'd just stuck to beer for lunch. When our new server came to clear the plates, there was no mention of ""Wow, you guys didn't eat much.  Was everything okay?""  I'm thinking he already knew the answer and just doesn't bother to ask anymore."
Adrienne B.,"San Mateo, CA",108,23,452,5.0,9/3/2017,"This is a long overdue review. First and foremost, out of all the BJ's restaurants that I've been to, this branch is my favorite. The hosts are very friendly here and always have a smile on their faces when you walk in. I've also never had a problem with any of the servers here.  My favorite server is Katrina B.! If you go to this branch, and have her as your server, you will get above and beyond service. If you see something wrong with your dish, she will deeply apologize and immediately have it fixed. If you need extra condiments, she'll get them right away and won't keep you waiting. She always checks up on you to either make sure you're enjoying your meal or to ask you if there's anything she can do to make it better. Top notch service! Thanks Katrina B.!"
Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439,1.0,10/12/2016,"I don't know - I'm just not a real fan of BJ's. I honestly prefer Red Robins in terms of food. SO wanted to stop here for an early evening dinner before the movies. It started off with waiting 45 minutes for a table. There's almost no seating in the lobby so many patrons just had to stand with kids running around all over the place. Then once we finally got seated and my SO ordered a beer, it was on to more waiting. 15 minutes until our waitress finally came back with the beer and we could order. I remember looking at the clock constantly because I didn't understand how it could take so long to make an appetizer and pour soda on to ice cream. Another 20-30 minutes until our food and my drink came. Finally our California flatbread arrived. It was surprisingly good. Bacon, avocado, and ranch and are a winning combo on anything, but the portion was very small and not filling. Definitely meant to be more of an appetizer. I ordered the orange cream float, that came with free refills, but didn't receive any because our waitress just never looked back after dropping stuff off. It took so long just receive an appetizer and drink, we didn't dare order anything else. We were already late for our movie at that point and just wanted the check. It took 30 minutes to ask for a check and pay. No one paid any attention to us and my SO had to aggressively flag another waiter down. Total of 2 hours. 2 hours to get some flat bread and a drink. We couldn't get out of there quick enough and haven't returned since."
Julie T.,"Jackson, CA",4,21,8,5.0,11/9/2017,"Love BJ's menu.  It's a great place to have ""date night"" and also a great place to have 10+ for a birthday dinner.  There pizookie (cookie with ice cream) is fabulous and you get your own on your birthday.  They also have a large pizookie with four flavors of cookies and ice cream in the middle that you can share with a big group.  The prices are not cheap, but you pay for atmosphere and a big menu that has pretty much something for everyone.  Oh, and if you like beer, they have a big variety of that too.  I like wine, but everyone I go with likes there beer selection.  Service is consistently good and they hire really nice staff.  Overall, a great chain that you count on."
Carpe D.,"San Francisco, CA",4,162,6,2.0,10/12/2017,"First HUGE complaint: The wait time to be served after being seated it never fails. I have been there 30 times probably, but the last time with my 3,5 year old took the cake: 40 minutes that is AWFUL and unacceptable. One of the last time, we took something from the kid menu that was fired and clearly it was old. Again really NOT Ok. The plusses are easy parking, great menu with light options, affordable, family friendly."
Ellen H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,229,121,4.0,9/25/2016,"I was going to leave a 1-star review because of very slow and inadequate service, but the new manager, Clint, stopped at my table and personally took care of our food/service. Clint really helped make our lunch a good experience. Below was my experience prior to Clint: I am writing this review as I'm sitting at the restaurant. Usually, the food is pretty good here and service so-so, but today the service has been so slow that it is very frustrating. We've been sitting at our table for 30 minutes and we're still waiting for cream and sugar for our coffee even though we've asked our waiter twice. He just put down our appetizer without any plates. Then when he brought us plates it was covered in blue dishwashing liquid. The waiter did not ask me how I wanted my steak and when I remembered, I tried to tell him ""medium"" but he didn't appear for so long; when the steak arrived it was extra rare. Another employee came over and explained that he's the new manager (Clint). He was very apologetic and explained that he knows there are problems, and that him and new management are trying to fix things. Clint ended up taking care of our table, ensuring that we got clean plates and cutlery, and had the kitchen make me a new steak. Clint checked on us several times and was able to turn what was originally a frustrating lunch into a nice lunch."
Tanya F.,"Fairfield, CA",88,21,33,1.0,9/10/2017,Seriously the worst restaurant ever: Slow service Wet plates Bad customer service Do Not  Support!!
Mark R.,"South San Francisco, CA",91,121,286,1.0,3/19/2017,This place really disappoints me.  First the hostess was unfriendly.  My family and i wanted to sit outside and she said they don't sit people outside till 5pm.  I told her its 4:55pm and she said that's not 5pm.  And she said the wait to be seated outside was 30 mins.  So we're sitting there waiting around 5:15 I saw the other hostess starting to put people outside.  I was thinking they had a reservation.  After ten minutes I went up the the hostess that I was talking to earlier and I asked her about the outside tables.  She said she forgot to text me and we're next. No sorry from the hostess.  Our waiter looks like she didn't want to be there.  Our food looks good but my order didn't look like what was on the menu.  My order looks like it came from the kids menu.  The portion was so small.  Sorry BJs but you failed and we won't be back.
Breanna L.,"San Bruno, CA",92,1,,5.0,11/3/2017,"I usually get ok service here in their lounge but recently I got the BEST service from Rhaliza. She was attentive, polite, and efficient. This review is for her. I will say there is one server I have gotten twice and I will REFUSE her service from now on. She is a taller and bulkier woman with black hair and an accent. She will make you wait over ten minutes to be greeted and then another ten just for one beer and this is not even when it's busy. She is very rude. BJ's should think about what shifts they give her and give Rhaliza the better shifts."
Jen H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,57,13,1.0,10/14/2017,Goodluck paying for a pick up order scheduled 35 minutes ahead from their app. Won't be ready or be acknowledged for pick up when you get there.  Check in service is not great by kids with automatic sass. Do they bother to ask how long ago a pick up was made? No. Maybe bj's should pay their wait staff more to actually be kind towards walk in customers. Eating here is like any other standard restaurant. It is decent if you don't feel like cooking.
Jessie K.,"Pearl City, HI",1,9,8,5.0,8/11/2017,This place has always been one of my favorite places to eat of all time. First time today that I tried their beer and I have to say that their gluten free beer is the best one yet. Their chicken is the best. What I got to eat for lunch is the lemon thyme chicken and it was bomb. The waiters do their jobs phenomenally.
Simran K.,"South San Francisco, CA",66,1,,1.0,12/12/2017,"We go to BJ's all the time but this Jimmy our server didn't even show up to the table until 20 Minutes. Once he finally Showed up he didn't even smile or asked us if wanted something to drink, instead he just left Menus on our table and left. After another 15 minutes he finally Took our order and still Didn't try to have a conversation. Rude!"
Craig F.,"Fullerton, CA",0,16,2,1.0,12/10/2017,"Used to come here every once in a while back in the day. Was in the area so decided to stop by. Upon arrival, the host didn't greet us and just asked how many? After being seated, we sat for 20 minutes and not one single server checked on us or asked to take our order. We left and won't be coming back, we definitely should've checked yelp first and saw those 2.5 stars! I wish I could give this place no stars."
Melody H.,"Madison Heights, MI",55,5,1,1.0,10/13/2017,By far worst experience dining! We have our salads no drinks. The server is horrible. Waited forever for our server to come to the table and then he reported they were out of their drink specials. So unfortunate we came here on the day of our wedding. Was hoping for much more. Go to the location in Concord. Much better
Anna C.,"South San Francisco, CA",1,7,2,1.0,12/4/2017,"I'll start off with a phone call as I was in the mall to place an order for dinner while my plan was to shop at Target for groceries.  It rang about 10 times and no one answered.  I have the number programmed on my phone and have called in the past so I know it was the correct number.  I decided to walk there since I was so close anyway (near Mrs Fields).  I was there within a couple minutes at the most.  To my surprise, there were about 4 people in the to-go side (left corner side) and then, about three more employees in the host box (center).   No one could pick up the phone??  Then, I ordered my three clam chowders.  When I get home after a long day of work and trying to squeeze in groceries and Xmas shopping, we open up our clam chowders, they are all small cups and they are all half full.  I measured it and the total came out to be  1/2 cup total.  I had to add more to it and really didn't want to cook!  Hence, I got take out.  Lastly, the soup had broccoli in it.  Whoever heard of broccoli in clam chowder?  We concluded it didn't taste like clam chowder, and that it was broccoli and cheese!  The picture should clearly speak louder than my words.  We tried to look for the clams, but no clams to be found!  Very disappointed."
Beth A.,"Fresno, CA",18,8,,3.0,1/2/2018,"In town for just the night and needed an easy dinner place before heading over to SFO to pick up incoming family. Found BJ's on Yelp and went on over. New Years Day at 6:45 pm.  Hostess said there would be a 30-40 min wait.  They obviously were short staffed because there were plenty of tables. Got the text 30 mins later and was seated in the back past the roll up doors. Hostess seated us and it was at least 10-15 mins before our waiter showed up.  Our waiter was super nice but it still took another 15 minutes for a H2O and Black Cherry Soda to come out. Placed dinner order when we gave our drink order.  Took probably another 30-40 mins before our plates came out.  I had the Spicy peanut chicken with Soba Noodles and the Mister has the BBQ chopped salad.  Both were very good, but his was missing the bbq sauce. However practically all the tables in our row had issues and needed to talk to a manager.  We ordered the monkey bread pizzookie and it was delish!!!  It took us 2 hours to have dinner and dessert at a BJ's.  I couldn't imagine how a regular night would be.  We'd still be there .  We usually prefer local restaurants but being Jan 1, many were closed so we picked what was familiar."
