Nayo M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",75,8,21,4.0,7/18/2015,The calamari is always delightful and the drinks are strong. Good experience and reasonable service each time.
Thomas W.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/20/2016,"For my first experience at a BJ's restaurant, I could not have asked for a better experience. I went in with an open mind, unlike most first time customers in restaurants these days; however from the moment I sat down until the moment it was time to leave... my expectations could have never been more inaccurate.  For me, it's all about the service. I'm a people person, who hates people. Weird right? But like anyone out there, I create a great relationship with someone who shows interest in me and my friends and provides an environment that I feel as comfortable as eating at home in my own living room.  My server Chaz, was more than I could ever ask for. I felt as if he was my best friend from the moment we sat down, receiving an oddly-familiar welcome from a very unfamiliar friend... and I use the term friend loosely because regardless that I had never met him before he left such an impression that I felt inclined to invite him out for a glass of wine with my group after he got off work.  He was unusually personable, in a great way, and it was one of the most pleasant experiences I've had at a casual dining restaurant in this area. Bottom Line/TLDR: Go to BJ's in San Bruno and ask for Chaz, and whether you are expecting a fun dining experience or not, you'll definitely get one."
Richard C.,"Carmel, CA",30,8,11,1.0,1/2/2017,"Slow service and the staff seemed to be just hanging out. We had a 40 minute wait while there were empty, but dirty tables. There were also other empty tables, but not sure why they weren't seating people there. The Salinas location is much better will not be back to this one."
Michelle T.,"San Jose, CA",46,54,69,3.0,6/15/2015,"We had the saddest looking (and tasting) Watermelon Salad here - greens weren't fresh and were swimming in Watermelon juice, along with Ahi Poke, also not fresh, Crispy Calamari and Pizookie Trio (wouldn't miss that!).  Fortunately, the (pizookie, as well as) staff here are attentive and nice, which somehow made up for the subpar quality of food preparation."
Tim O.,"Evanston, IL",11,28,1,2.0,12/31/2016,"Every single time I eat here something goes wrong. Whether it is he glasses that don't feel completely clean or a waiter that forgets about m3z. I go here for work, but other than that this is not a great option."
Denise I.,"San Francisco, CA",23,40,19,2.0,5/29/2016,"Ended up here yesterday b/c my out-of-town, ex-inlaws chose it. Service was slow and inattentive. Took at least 45 minutes to receive our food, they forgot the fries, never refilled the empty water glasses. Food was solidly mediocre, but wasn't expecting much to begin with, so on that front it didn't disappoint."
Maria O.,"San Bruno, CA",1,12,1,2.0,7/13/2016,"Had lunch on a Wednesday with 5 friends. First problem was our drink order. Asked for a margarita top shelf. All I could taste was the sour margarita mix. When we let the server know he said "" we can remake it or you can order a shot of tequila. We got the extra shot with a x bill for 9 dollar. So the margarita was 19 dollars. Sean asked for Long Island ice tea. It was also weak. Then to top it off one order was skipped. We waited and waited. I'll skip BJ's in the future"
Vicky H.,"Millbrae, CA",118,143,436,4.0,7/15/2014,"We went to BJ's for FIFA World Cup Final on Sunday morning, arrived around 11am and got ourselves seated at the bar area, right in front of the big screen TV.  :D  The bar tender/server introduced himself as Keith as we browsed through the menu almost as thick as a ""textbook"" (similar to the size at Cheesecake Factory).  We found Keith being personable and put in an effort to engage in a conversation, asking which team we support and how we'd see the outcome of the match.  He maintained a smile at all times.  We appreciated his courteous service and friendliness as he still attended to us given the chaos and packed crowd that later gathered and surrounded the bar area once the match began.   At BJ's, their traditional wings are to die for, an appetizer I highly recommend.  I also prefer their Great White pizza since I am not a big fan of red sauce.  From their own line of brews, I've always liked Jeremiah Red, an ale that is rich in flavor but not overly bitter, as well as Nutty Brunette, a chocolate-flavored dark ale, delicious!  One funny incident worth mentioning is that the guy who sat next to me at the bar area wasn't from the neighborhood and it was his first time visiting BJ's.  He was totally impressed by the menu selection (he ""studied"" for quite a while) and said it could be a dangerous place should he come more often.  I could tell he was quite happy with the experience even though the team he cheered for ultimately lost--sorry Argentina! Overall, it was one good FIFA Final experience and kudos to Keith for the good service provided.  I am glad that the crowd wasn't overly rowdy or obnoxious as people could get emotional cheering and rooting for their favorite team to bring home the trophy.  :)  It is a fun sports bar and restaurant to watch a game.  One tip: Get there at least an hour EARLIER to secure better seating for big events like World Series, Super Bowl, etc.  :P"
Ro A.,"San Francisco, CA",26,9,8,1.0,6/24/2016,"WORST service ever!!!!! HORRIBLE!! Took them 45 minutes to bring a wedge salad. I ordered a rib eye steak and an hour & 15 minutes later and still no steak. We finally had it and complained to the GM. He was very apologetic and offered to pay for our meal. That's the only good thing that happened. If I could give them zero stars, I would."
Ahna B.,"Montara, CA",760,151,16,1.0,8/6/2015,"Wow! I am not impressed at all with this place. BJ's used to be so good when it first opened. Not sure what happened. Service is not so great anymore. Pretty disappointed food taste like its from the freezer and I am not sure who cooks at these locations but yucky. Used to love this place. Don't think I will be returning; there are to many places in the bay that provide quality food, cocktails and service. Server needs to remember he is at work not on the street not to mention he doesn't remember what people ordered and having one bartender during a game does not work after 5 pm. Waited 30 minutes for my cocktail. The only person providing exceptional service is SHAY out on the patio. She should be a manager and she should get a big fat raise. She's efficient, consistent and a very good multi-tasker. I had to send one of my cocktails back because the soda was so flat that it tasted like plastic."
EL P.,"Daly City, CA",0,33,72,4.0,11/9/2014,"My wife and I come here about once every 1-2 months.  The last time we ate here, my wife ordered Thai shrimp lettuce wraps, and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  Thirty minutes later, our food had not arrived.  A kitchen manager then came out to say that the shrimp did not pass their quality testing, so the kitchen was making another plate of shrimp lettuce wraps.  My wife was given a free bowl of clam chowder while I ate my burger.  The shrimp wraps came out shortly thereafter.  The kitchen manager also gave us a free pumpkin pizookie (the reason we came for lunch was to try the pumpkin pizookie!). Later on, another manager came by to apologize for our wait and offered to take the shrimp wraps off our tab.  I ended up just having to pay for my burger.   We will likely still come back.  My wife wishes the pumpkin pizookie was on the menu year-round!"
Eric C.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, CA",222,24,16,5.0,5/31/2016,"Heriberto M, the waiter was extremely friendly. He even offered and helped my friend wipe down his jacket because my clumsy friend spilled water all over himself. Jimmy and Dahlia our server was extremely nice and our food was served in a timely matter. I highly recommend coming to this restaurant and definitely give them a little more tips!"
Vivian T.,"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/20/2016,"I came here on a busy Saturday afternoon with my friends and we were seated in the indoor patio area in the mall. Why there was an outdoor patio inside a mall, I'll never know, but it was so worth it because we had the best service through our waiter Matt. He was approachable, kind and attentive with us. I had no idea what to order because I wasn't very hungry, but Matt recommended the Chicken Tacos and it was perfect. I have also been watching my weight for the last few weeks and it was both a tasty and lean meal. He also recommend that my friends and I share a pizzookie for dessert. Probably the best thing I've ever eaten in my entire life! Overall fabulous experience."
Amelia D.,"San Francisco, CA",67,15,83,4.0,7/19/2015,We went here for lunch time and we had to wail long time ( about 1 hours) for food . The food is great but the services have some problems. I hope they improve not to keep customers waiting !!!
T M.,"Richmond, CA",0,25,1,5.0,6/19/2016,"I have been to a number of BJ's and haven't had as good a service as I received last week from a young man named Tyler. Tyler immediately helped my friend and I as we entered happy hour on a busy weds evening. We had, had reservation for 8ppl in the larger part of the restaurant but a few people cancelled and the service was SOOO good we remained in the bar. As our friends trickled in Tyler promptly took their order, he checked on us regularly and even let us know when he went on break. We will surely be back the food an drinks were equally as good!!!! Best BJ's by far!!!!"
Sarah L.,"San Francisco, CA",31,4,,1.0,3/31/2016,"Waited for over an hour just to walk away from our table. Normally we would have waited but seriously the front of house staff need to learn not to roll their eyes at guests or give so much attitude. We came here to have a nice family dinner, not to get turned around by such poor customer service. All I wanted to do was feed my kid. Jasmine, I hope you learn how to be courteous to your patrons next time."
Doris M.,"San Bruno, CA",0,35,,4.0,12/4/2016,"Was kind of leery coming here after reading the recent reviews about the poor service. We only had to wait a few minutes before getting seated.  Matt took our order for food and beverages and both came in a timely manner.  He finished his shift during our meal and introduced us to Asia, his replacement.  We received thoughtful service from her.  I had finished my food but asked for more water.  Asia brought 2 waters in to go cups so that we could take it with us. My husband needed a box for his left over French Dip sandwich.  She provided a container for that as well as one  for the au jus without us asking, which is rare in any restaurant."
Baylie C.,"San Carlos, CA",14,15,2,1.0,1/14/2016,"I've been to this location numerous times, and every time it's been a failure. There's never silverware on the table, and it takes about 15 minutes AFTER your food has arrived to receive any. The front desk people are so unorganized. There will be 3-5 people standing there and they'll do nothing, while 1 employee does all the work. It seems like they hire underage staff who know nothing, just for their looks. (Most of the girls have resting b*tch face) (One girl with a star tattoo on her neck seems to be the only one who knows how to do her job and has customer service skills)  I'm absolutely fed up of giving this location chances."
Amanda N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/12/2017,"This location seriously is need of a serious clean up. Upon entering the restaurant there is a terrible smell, like mildew or something. That smell just ruins the appetite. They should shampoo the rugs, wipe the tables thoroughly and mop the floor by the bar area and of course clean the bathroom from top to bottom."
Robert T.,"Alameda, CA",0,52,2,4.0,6/28/2016,"Good food and great beer.  This may be the only chain restaurant that I really love.  The beer is excellent, I wish they'd sell it outside the restaurant, particularly the red, brown and Pirahna  pale ales."
