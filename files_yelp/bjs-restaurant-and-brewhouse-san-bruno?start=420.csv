Diane C.,"San Mateo, CA",59,1,,1.0,6/24/2016,"Ordered a pizookie to go today. That was it. Not only did it take 40 minutes to get it, when i opened it up the cookie was burnt to a crisp, hard as a rock. The ladies at the take out counter were rude and seemed uninterested in helping a paying customer. Ok, maybe i didnt order the entire menu but I do frequent this restaurant...was hoping to get treated better..."
Sarah B.,"Chicago, IL",252,249,126,2.0,7/5/2014,"I had a late lunch here the other day, and the service was subpar.  The hostess was nice and greeted us immediately, and she let us know it was happy hour in the bar area.  We wanted to sit at a booth, so we said we would wait for the booth in the bar area to be cleaned.  The waiter tried to tell us to sit elsewhere, and we said we didn't mind waiting for the table to be cleaned off.  No one came to clean the table for a couple of minutes.  Once the table was cleaned off, it was neve wiped dry.  Our server handed us two menus, didn't bring us silverware, didn't introduce himself, and took our drink order.  Our drinks came out promptly, and we placed our order.  Our server never brought us or informed us of the happy hour menu.  Our food was okay, it came out promptly and was accurate.  We had another guy come refill our water, but my glass was left empty for quite some time.  Neither of the guys were friendly, at all.  Maybe they were having a bad day or maybe the hospitality business isn't for them."
Tim L.,"Honolulu, HI",21,533,3210,4.0,6/13/2014,I just drank here so no food review.  BJ's has a large selection of draft beers including Guinness.  I was about to do a Guinness but tried their dark beer (forget the name of it) and went with a pint of the home-brewed dark.  It was quite good.  I happened to be there in the late afternoon and got the happy hour pricing of $4.00 for a pint.  Great deal!
J G.,"Burlingame, CA",64,26,10,1.0,5/15/2016,"Terrible experience tonight, and we've been to BJ'S many time. For starters we had 7 in our party, appetizers came pretty quick and we're good. Drinks also came, we'll 6 did the 7th took about 15 minutes. Meals came 5 and of 7 INCORRECT, Asked for no mayo, my burger came fully loaded with mayo. My mother asked for extra mayo and wedge fries, hers came with no mayo and skinny fries. Both of those are manageable, so we ate with no complaints. My 2 young daughters had kids meals, one with chicken  strips and apple sauce, of course they bring it with fries and no applesauce so my toddler had a meltdown. They finally bring her applesauce but NO SPOON, we asked 3 different people for spoons, another 15 minutes with NO spoon. Another meltdown. My other daughter ordered the kids cheeseburgers, they come and NO LIE, the burgers were about the size of a half dollar (one bite) and the bun was trippen the sz, we all laughed about it but the server or manager did nothing about it.  Last but not least was my teenager ordered a turkey club with no sauce, garlic, mayo or ranch. She hates sauces/condiments of course it comes with all the white gooey garlic/mayo sauce dripping from it, she wanted to puke. We told the server which of course they had to make another one. By the time it came, 15 minutes later, everyone was done and wanted to get the hell outta there she took a few bites but was no longer hungry. You would think they would compensate something but nope nothing, our server didnt even care about all the screwups..we spent over $125 for Shitty service, and mediocre food. Not to mention 2 got diarrhea and I have vomited twice since coming home.  It's going to be awhile before we go back to any BJ's."
Hen A.,"San Mateo, CA",3007,3154,4803,3.0,1/27/2015,"quite busy and long waits for tables, but open seating at the bar...bar stools or tables mostly full, but pretty easy to spot a table nearly finished...literally under a minute and finding a table at the bar...same menu and better view of sports on the screens...various burgers, pizzas, brews and more...similar larger scale chain restaurant to a gordon biersch or elephant bar...calories on the menu items making choices quite hard...taking the lower calorie option, $10.50 bison burger with a slaw salad...actually quite good...quite juicy...other taking the $11.25 jalepeno burger...gut-busting, messy and good...fries to add even more gluttonous calories...decent food, large space, sports and good cheerful crowd...plan ahead if you want a table...very busy weekends..."
MJ C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,44,1,3.0,7/6/2016,"I am giving this a three star simply because of my server, Joe.  He was friendly and professional. He made up for the could-not-care-less receptionist with the eye glasses.  Quality of my ribs was also good.  Too bad no free bread.  My side of steamed broccoli was a total of two pieces - really?! I have been to the same restaurant in Bridgepoint, San Mateo.... i will never go there again.  Noisy and service bad and always makes a mistake with the order."
Chris S.,"San Francisco, CA",10,99,33,1.0,5/15/2016,I've consistently had really bad beer that lacked carbonation and any depth of flavor. I'm not just talking about their own brew but also any other beer on tap like new castle or boddington. Also this isn't the first time that I felt this way since the last time I came it was the same experience. It even happened to me when I came here for a work lunch and ordered a soda. Even that was flat and desperately needed carbonation. Lastly the service is always horrible at the bar where the bar tender don't acknowledge you. I'll never return!
Elizabeth S.,"San Carlos, CA",323,780,360,4.0,3/23/2014,"This place has pretty damn good American fare with a page numbered menu.  -quite a novel here!  There is literally something for everyone, and you can have some good beers or interesting beer concoctions with your meal.  I tried the Irish Berry Burst with the Berry Cider and Guiness.  It was kind of sweet yet refreshing.  -probably not for guys though.  My bf hated it. Honesty, all the food we ordered was great.  They have a plethora of enticing appetizers.  So we did it tapas style and feasted with a menu on the side in case we were hungry for more.   The Thai shrimp wraps were about as Thai as the lemongrass included but really scrumptious all wrapped in butter lettuce with a sweet soy sauce to dip in. The stuffed mushrooms...  We inhaled them! The Santa Fe spring rolls were filled with chicken, black bean, red peppers and other fresh ingredients resulting in nuances of flavors.  They also came with two delectable dipping sauces.  That avocado one and some sort of spicy aoli were so good, we were dipping the fried artichoke hearts in there too. All this was not enough, so the bf ordered a cup of chili and me the minestrone.  What a way to end a fun meal.  The chili was robust and flavorful.  My minestrone totally exceeded my expectations with the loaded vegetables, kidney beans and some fusilli.  It came with some parmesan to sprinkle on top too. This place is super big and lofty.  It has a fun atmosphere with tons of TV's, festive beer motifs and some ornate accessories like fancy mirrors and chandeliers.  The murals on the wall are great too.   This was our first time at this location, but our server was great.  I wish I knew his name, but he was an older bald Asian guy with glasses.  -very attentive, personable and solicitious.  He got me to sign up for a rewards card and explained the point system.  All this great service and knowledge with a joking personality to go with!  You bet we'll be back!"
Eman D.,"San Bruno, CA",0,16,22,2.0,6/18/2016,"We come here for the pizookies and Mark the waiter (who never disappoints to be awesome). It is loud and the wait is usually long on the weekends, holidays, and when any major game is on. Gluten free pizookies are worth it though!"
Liz E.,"Elk Grove, CA",100,48,4,2.0,5/13/2016,"2 stars for the useless call-ahead service. I called at 6:38 and was told it was a 35-40 minute wait for a party of 2. Get to the restaurant at 7:08 and then I'm told it's another half hour wait but I'll ""be at the top of the list"". Fast forward to 7:55 when I have to get up and ask them how much longer because they've called 6 parties of 2, a party of 7, and a party of 3. Girl checks the computer and realizes we called ahead and they finally seat us. Ridiculous if you ask me."
Leah H.,"Killadangan, Republic of Ireland",0,2,,3.0,6/14/2016,"Took an hour to get my food, it wasn't busy, everyone else got their food, terrible service at first as our waitress went walkabouts for about an hour and didn't come near our table. Eventually the manager Erin came out and personally apologised to us. I got my food and didn't have to pay for it at first, I had a previous review up complaining about the service and when Erin saw it she immediately came over and insisted that we not pay for our food. We got a free meal in the end. Erin is very good at her job and dealt with the problem very well."
Lizzie G.,"San Francisco, CA",27,342,9966,3.0,12/30/2014,"I think this is maybe my second or third time I've been here the service always sucks the food is mediocre. I had to call the manager over and tell him that our waiter had too many tables, and we had to flag him down to ask him for too many things and then I told him the fries gave me tasted old the good thing was that he gave us the fries on the house. but it took forever for the food Once they give the food they don't come back until you want the check, and then that takes another hour you just Beetlejuice in waiting seriously it was on a Monday. was kind of packed because a holiday and everybody is on vacation but if you're going to have these waiters have more than one table you need to do your job be a little bit quicker be a little bit friendlier, and fast with the food yes I know it takes time to cook but we were there for half an hour waiting get with the program."
Jillian C.,"South San Francisco, CA",190,13,23,1.0,3/5/2016,"Literally just left BJs because we were seated for over 20 minutes and no one acknowledged us. I even made eye contact with servers and the manager and nothing. The tables around us were being tended to except us. And just as we were getting ready to leave, the server from the table next to us comes over to wave n play with my baby then walked away. No asking of drink order, no asking if we've been helped or I'll be right back to get your order. Nothing. Thanks BJs. My kids are now hungry n tired from waiting so long."
Kimberly E.,"Hercules, CA",985,175,494,1.0,1/1/2015,"Very, very disappointed about the service AND the food tonight. My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner here after a New Years Day adventure. And wow... I don't even know where to start.  First off, we found an open table at the bar area, so we sat down and waited for someone to serve us. Not long after, someone came up to us, cleared the table and asked us if we would like anything to drink. We ordered two beers, she checked our IDs, and then left us a menu. Just one. And by the time she came back to give us another, we were already set with what we wanted to order.  For appetizer, we ordered the the deep fried artichoke hearts. For entree, my boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and I ordered the soup and salad combo (I picked clam chowder and a house salad with vinaigrette on the side).  First thing that came to our table was my boyfriend's pasta and my clam chowder. The moment the soup touched my lips, I knew it was not the right temperature. I mixed it and tried to see if it was just the surface that was cold, but my second spoonful clarified that the soup was in fact lukewarm.  When the next food-runner came and brought us our appetizer (yes, our appetizer came after our entrees), I sent my soup back to be warmed. Keep in mind that I ordered a soup and salad combo and my salad still hasn't shown up.  Since my boyfriend's pasta was fine, he was pleased. I decided to try the deep fried artichokes. And let me just say... everything in that dish was sour. The artichokes were sour. The dipping sauce it came with was sour. The lemon they garnished the plate with was sour (hahahaha). I ended up asking my waiter for ranch, because it was overbearing.  When my warm soup finally came back out, my salad joined in and by that time, I was already losing my appetite. I did take a few more spoonfuls of the soup and a few bites of my salad. But after that, I gave up.  Overall, I don't expect much from chain restaurants. But this was just a huge miss."
Jessie F.,"South San Francisco, CA",155,54,6,5.0,8/16/2015,Great place to eat at! Got the potstickers for an appetizer and the burger with cheese. Everything was as expected and we had a great server. Will def come back here again!
alexandria s.,"San Francisco, CA",5,42,,1.0,11/7/2016,"I went with my friends to celebrate our birthdays. The service was lacking. It took a long time to get our drinks and our food. Food was cold. My friend's salad had wilted lettuce and chew holes in it--I do not know how that got past quality control. We had like 3 different people serving our table and they did not know what was going on with our order--really big lack of communication. We ordered an entrée to go and twice they brought it out on a plate. We asked for our dessert like 3 times before we got it and it took forever to get it. The bill took a long time as well we had to keep asking for it. The lady at the table next to us, kept having to ask for her drink. It was an overall unpleasant experience :("
Johnny M.,"San Francisco, CA",11,17,3,4.0,4/28/2016,I love going to BJ'S to watch the game and drink but the food is kind of basic. .. don't get me wrong it is really good but it would be better if it were a little more like Cheesecake Factory.  Service was decent and this def a good spot to eat for a bday but better for a game day!!!!#
Rachel A.,"Goleta, CA",156,2,,4.0,5/31/2016,Sienna wants her manager to buy her dinner. This place is fine. Pizza was cheesy. Beer was boozy. We left content
Janice R.,"Pacifica, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/31/2017,"Bj's really needs to hire more competent people ! With better personalities .. the young short Filipino hostess has absolutely no emotion when greeted, and as far as the young clean cut short Hispanic waiter , VERY unprofessional to show favoritism to customers walking in and not paying any attention to others sitting or greeting others in the same manner . But then again it is only BJ's.. You get 1star only because you have to in order to continue. I made a reservation specifically for 10 people with 2 high chairs for my daughters graduation we were told that it would possibly be 2side by side booths or tables  which we were ok with ,and when we got there they took us to the back and we had what looked like a table for 4 with a smaller table next to it ,not even the same size . It looked tacky and all the hostess stated was , that's all the tables  we had left ! WTF?? Completely unacceptable!! Luckily we had 2 tables in the bar area while we were waiting for this reserved table .. This completely ruined my daughters celebration and hope for all of us to sit together as a family . The older gentleman we had as our server looked a lil over whelmed,  but was very nice ( thank you )and again , thank you BJ's for for ruining what was supposed to be a preplanned good afternoon ."
Chele D.,"Campbell, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/15/2016,"We have been to BJ'S about a half dozen times to the San Bruno location. Tonight was by far the best service we have had here. Normally drinks, appetizers and food take way longer than expected but Jimmy made it happen tonight. He was attentive and on it with the service. He was on top of every table he had tonight that was around us. Super friendly and personable.  The only way we are coming back to this BJ'S is if Jimmy is our server again!"
