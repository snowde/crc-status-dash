B T.,"Tracy, CA",0,206,61,4.0,10/14/2016,"Good came out cold, had the food returned and the assistant manager had everything remade and food was perfect. Great sirloin good service friendly staff. We did not have to wait at all when we walked in."
Matthew R.,"Manassas, VA",16,14,4,1.0,5/15/2016,"Wow, should've paid closer attention to the other reviews. Bathroom was nasty which for a guy that loves dive bars is saying something. Additionally, our server forgot our orders, we were told the kitchen was backed up and the manager came out to apologize. The apology would've been nice but he didn't even offer to comp the drinks or the app we ordered (so kinduv an empty apologize). In total we spent $60 for a pretty shitty experience."
Dave R.,"San Mateo, CA",0,9,11,5.0,12/12/2016,I do not get out to eat much anymore but I think BJs has come a long way. I really do not like to eat anywhere else. Everything I try is pretty good!
Marcela M.,"Daly City, CA",0,15,1,1.0,11/13/2015,Very bad service. Ask for a little something for a friend that was his birthday took them 40 min to come to us and to top it off told us they don't do those things in there. We had about 4 different people in our table. Servers need more training. He was really worry about us paying the check and forgot about providing a decent service.  After I talked to the manager which was really nice and hope they will something about it. Don't plane to go back any time soon.
Josseline M.,"Daly City, CA",0,11,4,1.0,3/8/2016,"3 people got food poisoned from this place!!! people be aware my mom, my sister and i got food poisoned from this place!!!!! be careful people called today to make a complaint manager acted like it wasn't a big deal plus she kept hanging up the phone !"
A. J. Dex C.,"San Francisco, CA",160,27,6,1.0,2/2/2015,"Walked in the bar which was empty at the time. Instead of getting helped, was ignored by every waiter that insisted on helping everyone who had sat down after me....I wouldn't expect amazing service in a self seating bar, but I am incredibly disappointed in the wait staffs inability to communicate their assigned tables to each other. Sitting for over 20 minutes waiting for someone to help me is a bit past forgiveable. Being curious I waited for how long it would actually take. Once she dropped a menu she proceeded to help two other tables that had just arrived. It took about 30 minutes to get my drink on a slow Monday. Let's not even talk about how long it took to get my food order in. Sad."
J L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,19,5,1.0,5/12/2016,"Our waitress was horribly rude. We ordered ""boneless wings"" and they came out cold to the touch. The waitress told us that was impossible, and picked up several to feel for herself. She finally takes them back, and when she brings them out, they are 3 different colors. We said we were no longer interested in the wings (for pretty obvious reasons, I'd say) to which she lectured us that they are not ""wings,"" but in fact ""nuggets"" and refused to take them from our table. After waiting 45 minutes for our table, we left without eating."
HEATHER S.,"South San Francisco, CA",43,6,1,5.0,4/30/2016,Went to BJ's today for dinner and our server Jessica was amazing! Her bubbly personality and attentiveness made this dinner stop worth while! Would come back again just to have her as our server!
Edward G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,17,4.0,6/9/2016,"The Southern Fried Chicken sure is top of the line. The boneless, thin slice sits on mash with the works. The caveat is the portion- sadly only one piece. However, this dish makes fried chicken possible on a date or important meeting."
Mona A.,"Daly City, CA",23,36,49,5.0,3/25/2015,"I always get good food and awesome service when I come here! The food was very fresh & tasty. I was seated within 2 minutes of walking in. Btw, Alaa is an awesome waitress!"
Christine W.,"Hamburg, Germany",125,331,263,2.0,1/14/2015,"Where do I begin?  Don't expect amazing unique food or stellar service either. I called ahead on a Friday night for a party of 5 and when I arrived they said it would take about 30 min. I'm not sure how long it would have took if I didn't call ahead and it looked like there were a lot of people waiting for a table. My family and I just browsed around the bookstore before our table was ready so there were no problems there. We were seated in their confusing 'patio' area which is pretty much part of the mall area. Though it was quieter then being seated inside, we barely saw our server throughout our dinner experience. When we were first seated by the host, it looked like someone spilled their drink or something and so the booth seating was wet so I asked if we could sit at a different booth. The host obliged but, they didn't do anything to fix the wet seat booth that we moved from. They sat a different party there and they said the same thing that the seat was wet and all they offered them was a napkin to place on the wet area.  Anyways, for appetizers we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the cheesy fries to start. The appetizers came pretty quickly but we didnt have any utensils or plates. I asked the server and he said ok.....never did it....I asked again, and we finally got utensils, but by this time we finished the apps and had the greasy fingers to prove it. For an entree we shared a large pizza and it was fine. Standard pizza with a pretty good deep dish crust. Overall the experience was meh... I do love their beer offerings but everything else is not what I'm willing to pay for or have the patience for when thinking about where to go for a nice dinner."
Kristen F.,"Washington, DC",69,59,,3.0,6/3/2016,"We stopped in on our way to the airport for some dinner before an east coast flight.  Service was good, but a little slower than we hoped.  The food was good.  The new fried cauliflower appetizer was really good.  The place did have a ""wet rag"" smell."
Natalie M.,"San Francisco, CA",301,502,366,4.0,4/3/2014,"I personally enjoy BJ's. The food isn't AMAZING but it's pretty consistent, but it's pretty darn good. Get the stuffed mushrooms, and try the lettuce wraps with shrimp. Delicious. Also, deep dish pizza anyone? They are so great. I've tried the bbq chicken, and vegetarian. Deep dish is so delicious. They also have great flatbread appetizers (California club). Their happy hours are at random times (I think even at 10pm on some days), but they have great drink specials. Some of their drinks are strong. They have skinny margaritas as well. Woo!  Fun place but it gets super duper crowded. Sitting at the bar, you don't have to wait as long but those seats fill up fast. Expect to wait from 30 min to an hour."
Jaymee F.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,8,4,1.0,5/1/2016,"Today is the first time my husband got so pissed of with a server/host that he decided to leave and eat somewhere else. It was me, my husband and our 11 mos baby thats sitting in his stroller. We come in at 11am the place is not yet full and there's 4 of them at the door. My husband said table for 3 with a baby, the guy didnt say nothing then looked at the girl beside him, disnt even bother to greet us or just say ok or anything!! Then ny husband told him that maybe we could just leave the stroller somewhere so he can sit us already cos he heard them talking about our big stroller. Then he AGAIN did not bother to say anything. Then they sit us in a round table without a highchair, do you want us to carry the baby while we eat? I dont know whats wrong with these people. It seems like they're not even thinking at all! Worst restaurant ever!!"
Cindy G.,"Dixon, CA",119,137,579,3.0,4/27/2014,"I've been to this location three times and the only word I can say is: SLOW. The first and second time dine in during lunch and it took forever to get our appetizer and then the entree. I would say a good 20 minute for our food to arrive. But wasn't satisfied with the service and the food was blend.  The third time is for happy hour, again it was slow and waited for 5 minutes until this one server greeted and apologized the long wait.  But the drinks came in less then 5 minutes and the food, for a good 7-8 minutes. I order the wildberry mojito for $4.00 and it was pretty good. Then the food: first the California club flatbread was good and crispy with various of toppings that is healthy but good. Then chicken potsticker are really delicious along with the  avocado roll that has a kick of flavor but at least my friend and I had a pretty good dinner.  Then the mini pizooki, I order the cookies and creme pizooki while my friend order the chocolate ghirardelli pizzoki which she said it was moist and sweet. As for the cookies n creme, very creamy and sugary.  I would come back but only for happy hour since there is no chance that I'll dine in unless there training the server to be quick."
Nunya B.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,12,1,2.0,3/25/2015,"I was looking for a nice place to eat close to my hotel & thought I would check this place out.  First, several parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Then I realized if you go here with children of ANY age (mine was 11), you will be exiled and made to sit in the indoor 'patio area' directly in front of the malls main entrance.   At this point the restaurant feel is gone as you watch herds of shoppers coming in and out of the front door, not to mention the loud echoing, which overall makes it feel like an overpriced meal in the mall food court.  When directly asked about the children issue they denied this was there tactic. I went to this mall the next two days and all the tables on the 'patio' were filled only with families with children. So wrong."
Chris S.,"San Francisco, CA",123,121,76,2.0,3/18/2016,"The service here sucks.  It took several minutes for a server to come with menus.  We ordered two drinks and buffalo wings.  The wings took over an hour to come to our table.  I've always come here, but it seems like the service just goes down the drain each time.  I'm taking my money across the street to Jack's!"
Maysa S.,"Sacramento, CA",246,4,,5.0,5/27/2016,Tyler Mack is literally what we have been waiting for as a restaurant!!! He's been the best server ever and so sweet!! Thanks Tyler for a great grad experience!! B
Coco C.,"South San Francisco, CA",50,97,2830,3.0,5/17/2015,"My hubby wanted to eat lunch here today and the service is never consistent.  Good thing our food was great and yummy.  As far as our waiter that looked like Pierce Brosnan...he was so unpleasant, I should have something to the Manager in charge. 04.29.15"
Ana O.,"Miami, FL",0,7,5,1.0,11/6/2016,"I'm on vacation and this place was convenient. What a terrible experience this was. From the service to food quality, everything lacked. Our order was wrong, very delayed and consequently it was cold when it got here.  We asked for the manager twice. When she finally got here she was very apologetic and covered the bill. Overall a bad experience."
