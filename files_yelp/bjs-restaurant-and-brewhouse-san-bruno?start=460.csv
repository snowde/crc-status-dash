K T.,"San Francisco, CA",4,62,27,4.0,6/23/2015,"MAIN COURSE: 3 STARS  DESSERT: 5 STARS  I ordered the sirloin with cheesy mashed potatoes and string beans (about $16...this steak dish comes with two sides that you can choose from like soup, fries, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc. ) I was very excited, but when I got it, everything was in very small proportions--I was shocked! The string beans and mashed potatoes were great, but the steak was not. When I order sirloin elsewhere, it is not grainy (for lack of a better word...please reference my pictures). It was juicy, but the texture was so off putting! It did not taste like steak at all.  The dessert was AMAZING. We ordered a 3 pan pizookie plate (about $10), and it was so worth it. You get to choose which three cookie flavors you'd like to have. We chose the double chocolate, white chocolate and macadamia, and a regular cookie--all topped with vanilla ice cream. The white chocolate was surprisingly less sweet compared to the other two. The double chocolate wasn't as sweet as I had expected it to be. The regular cookie was my favorite though.  Bottom line: -BJ's can be pricy, but there are more budget-friendly meals on the menu.  -do NOT order the sirloin  -GET THE 3 PAN PIZOOKIE PLATE. SO WORTH IT."
workout n.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,1,1.0,4/23/2016,Bad night for BJ's called in the order got there after 35 minutes had to wait another 30 minutes to an hour for a takeout order
Pj A.,"San Francisco, CA",630,136,5,3.0,4/2/2016,"Been here many times and every single time I always end up regretting what I order due to everything being over priced for the portions,taste, and quality of the food. The place is nice. The service can be a little more attentive, but maybe they were having a bad day. eh."
Lisa W.,"Pacifica, CA",25,3,,5.0,5/23/2016,"My son and I went for lunch this Saturday. I love the food here, but usually the service is slow due to the volume of customers. Russell was our waiter and he was an excellent server! For being such a young man, I was very impressed with his attention to detail and promptness. I asked to speak to the manger Andrew to praise Russell's work ethic. They were both very appreciative to get the positive feedback."
Michael K.,"Honolulu, HI",39,45,,1.0,12/17/2015,"Waited over an hour for our food tonight.  Unacceptable when you have a hungry toddler.  Yet could have at least gotten her food out first. When our food got here,  they forgot my wife's pizza. Waited another 20 min and still no pizza.  We decided to leave without it.  Asked for water. Never got it.  The thing that kills me is all the servers walk around like they don't care.  They don't care that you've been waiting over an hour for your food and it shows in their demeanor.  If i could, id give this place zero stars. Don't waste your hard earned money here."
Alan S.,"Redwood Shores, CA",66,60,70,1.0,11/6/2015,"Went to BJ's at 1pm on a Friday. Not busy at all, and we were seated promptly. Things kind of went downhill from there. Tried to order a Coke, but they don't serve Coca-cola products. Ordered a root beer, and was told the taps were broken(?). Finally able to get an iced tea. Ordered a bison burger and chicken flatbread. Items took a bit long to arrive, esp considering the place was not busy (I'm guessing it was 20 min?). Then the topper: the server delivered my meal, but then proceeded to pull a hair out from the burger. Yep. I guess it was good that he spotted it, and he did ask the kitchen to re-make the order, but it was pretty gross... Burger was delivered a few minutes later by the manager (why did it get delivered so quickly this time?), but kind of lost my appetite at that point. Took forever to get the check (server seemed to be talking with another customer throughout our time at the restaurant). When the check arrived, we expected the burger to have been taken off the menu at least, but instead, we were charged TWICE for the order. Finally able to get the second charge taken off but no offer to take off the first or even an apology from the manager. I have thought long and hard about writing this review, especially given the rating, but I think it's completely appropriate given my experience this time, and the 3 other times I've attempted to give BJ's a shot (two other times at the Foster City location, another time here). Every time I've had either lost/wrong order, slow service, food return, etc. I don't consider myself picky, but just not acceptable. Message to BJ's: you are really a disaster. Maybe I've been very unlucky, but I'm not coming back here again and recommending against anyone ever wanting to go there. Your prices put you in competition with places that offer far better quality of food and customer service. I hope you figure it out for the sake of the longevity of your company, but it will not be with my support."
Luke S.,"San Mateo, CA",477,1211,,3.0,3/30/2014,"This place has great beer .  I gotta give it to them for that.   The ribs I thought were pretty bland , very easy to get off the bone tho and the baked potato was ah okay.   I like the crowd here and all the tv's they have . The service is really good too cuz although they get really busy they make sure to still give excellent service."
Paul B.,"San Bruno, CA",6,19,,1.0,4/6/2016,"This is the LAST TIME I will ever eat at a BJ's Restaurant! I keep returning, hoping it will change but it just gets worse.  I have operated businesses for over 20 years and can't think of a chain restaurant in more diss array.  The management obviously doesn't care about their customers or the business.  Here's what's wrong with BJ's:  1. Food is below average at best!...always undercooked, overlooked, missing standard ingredients/accompaniments, 2. Slowest kitchen in the area, hands down, 3. Your order will almost always be a mistake, 4. The manager will be non existent & often playing with his/her staff in the BOH or FOH, with no regard for their actual job, 5. Your waiter/waitress will be brand new with little to no experience and often leave for lengths of time with out checking on you, 6. YOU WILL WAIT (on avg.) ""1 hour"" MIN TO RECEIVE YOUR FOOD, 7. You will ask to talk to the manager about your food delay and he will cower in the BOH & never come out to address the problem., 8. You will make a reservation only to find out that once you arrive, you will wait another 20-30 minutes while they lie and say ""we're clearing your table now"" (that means they never took your reservation). Bottom line....been here probably 12x, with varying size parties, always a problem, managers are a joke, wait staff untrained at best, food is substandard, food is always a hellacious wait, restaurant is dirty, and overcrowded.  I feel like applying to run this restaurant as it has so much promise but so much of it is broken!  Does the Regional Manager even know what's happening with this restaurant?  Does the corporation even care?  Whomever is the CEO of BJ's should be ashamed of this location!  It's down right awful. I would never recommend this restaurant to even an enemy!!!!"
Lana T.,"San Leandro, CA",48,18,24,5.0,3/26/2016,Shoutout to the best servers James and Rudy for your awesome service tonight! You guys seriously made my night!!
Kevin Z.,"San Francisco, CA",124,34,13,1.0,12/28/2014,"Mediocre service. I brought my girlfriend in for dinner and after waiting, we were seated to a table that had not been cleared and cleaned yet. Waitress paid no attention to us it took 10 minutes before she approached us to offer us beverages or starters. We were given dirty plates with dried sauce still on it, to use for the pizza. After telling the waitress, she disputed my claim by saying that's nothing on the plates before I corrected her and gave me replacements. It didn't help that she came out with the wrong size pizza I ordered and tried to blow it off by saying it was what I ordered. This is not to mention, she never came back with the ranch dip i asked for! 30 minutes later and I'm still sitting here waiting for my pizza.  Also, beware of the sanitation of the restaurant staff. My girlfriend saw a waitress in the restroom not wash their hands before returning to work. YUCK!"
Merly I.,"San Francisco, CA",8,124,15,2.0,3/16/2016,"Typical sports restaurant/bar chain.. Would suggest going for the Happy hour deals -check on their website for times!.  Today, I was passing through San Bruno and decided I wanted to watch sports, so I decided to stop in BJ'S .  My waiter at the bar area was swamped with tables and I had to flag him down just to refill my water!. :( I ordered the Ahi-Salad!. Surprisingly, the salad was enough for one person!. the Ahi slices were fresh (could had been more) ;( but it was full of flavor and texture for my enjoyment. So, during all that time from me flagging down waiter to refilling my water ...he never came back to see how I was doing? Or if I needed anything else?!. I am One paying consumer if I get Great Service I tip very well!! :D in this case, sad to say..I tipped waiter way under (sorry to do that) due to his lack of attention to my table..I was ready to hand him a $10.00 bill..that changed to $3.00 :("
Audie C.,"San Jose, CA",191,11,1,4.0,12/6/2015,The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was good. I enjoyed it. The waitress was nice. Her name was Daniela T.
Jason S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,3.0,4/30/2016,"we've been going in this restaurant for a while now. every visit is different.  worse experience is they serve food w/ out water, and utensils on top of that our food is served after 1 hour we ordered. great experience is just recently w/ the server named lovely and she attend us very well."
Yesenia C.,"San Diego, CA",671,235,106,3.0,11/22/2013,"Bj, love coming here mainly because I absolutely love the avacado egg rolls and the wedge salad is super good.  This location has a pretty small bar and not many TV's it's actually overall a smaller location so it gets really really busy. The service is just ok I been here a few times and nothing too special.  You can call ahead and put your name down over the phone as long as your there with 30 minutes."
Joey V.,"San Mateo, CA",50,5,,1.0,4/27/2016,I just tryed the new hickory bacon burger took 4 bites out of it and had a freaking screw in my burger I mean seriously a screw in my food... I'm pissed right now what if I swollowed that shit... It was even a clean screw it was a dirty one... This is not sanitary just be care what u eat and eat slowly...
Eva K.,"Daly City, CA",302,20,4,5.0,3/31/2016,Antonio is hands down the best server at BJ's. He makes me feel welcomed and at home. He knows the menu inside and out. When I asked for a recommendation he quickly knew what I would like. I would definitely come back because Antonio made my experience worthwhile.
Jose O.,"Belmont, CA",35,18,2,1.0,2/2/2014,"My girlfriend and I walked in and there was no wait. We were sat right away and were greeted by the waitress within a couple minutes and had our drinks a couple minutes after that. We ordered cheeseburgers, figuring that they'd be fast. 20 minutes later, still no food. The waitress walks by and apologizes for the wait. 20 more minutes pass, people that showed up well after us got their food. The waitress completely disregarded us and even walked the long way around when she picked up dirty plates. I waited 5 more minutes and walked out.  Horrible service. I'll never go back."
Janet T.,"San Mateo, CA",3279,189,1,3.0,10/7/2014,"Oops....almost forgot to write this review from last week. Met my BFF here for just a beer and the Avocado rolls here after we went shopping for an upcoming event.  It was one of those HOT days, we decided to drop in since my BFF lives not far from BJ's. Anyway the Avocado rolls were delicious and darn that beer (Corona) tasted good. But service was a little spotty. But that's typical. I've been to BJ's many times over the years. Parking was tricky. BJ's was very busy!"
A M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,28,1,2.0,10/24/2016,"It was my first time there. I made a reservation 3 hours in advance and ended up waiting an additional 30minutes. We went because it was online as a sports bar and we wanted to watch the baseball game. There are tv screens all along the perimeter but they are on all different channels. We had to request a table and wait longer to be able to get the area to view the baseball game on a specific tv. My reservation also had the request but we didn't get seated appropriately. Don't ask me why they couldn't change the channel. Anyways, too large and noisy to enjoy a game anyways. No captions on any tv with no volume. Do not go there to watch sports!!! The 20 televisions are just for decoration."
Jimmy R.,"Easton, PA",15,20,,2.0,10/24/2016,Had / Has potential....just too much bad to write about...a bad night for BJs...Let's just leave it at that.
