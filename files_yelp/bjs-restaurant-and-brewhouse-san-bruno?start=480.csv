Cathy G.,"San Bruno, CA",19,47,,2.0,3/20/2017,"I used to really love coming to BJ's, but the last few times I have come, it just has not been that good. Today was by far the worst service I think I have ever had. My daughter and I arrived before 3:00 to find the hostess on the phone, which is fine...she stated that she would be just a minute. Also fine. At least she acknowledged us. Fortunately there was a couple of servers up by the host station, and one of them seated us. Our waiter came almost immediately, which was awesome. My problem starts after we actually placed our order. Because of a rainy day, my daughter and I decided to stick with the chicken tortilla soup. Great soup kind of day. Gave our order to our waiter and proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for two bowls of soup. When it arrived, the bowls had hardly any soup in it and what was there was barely Luke warm. Mine had one piece of chicken and one tortilla strip in it. My daughter at least got two chicken pieces in hers, but alas, no tortilla strips. It's really too bad because the tortilla soup is really good! I also had a cup of coffee, which no one ever came back to see if I wanted a warm up or another cup. Our waiter only came back to give us the bill, which he promptly picked up. Took a while to get it back though. By this point, we could hardly wait to leave. I was really very disappointed today"
Liz G.,"Bayview/Hunters Point, San Francisco, CA",0,11,5,5.0,7/7/2015,"I love Bj's its my favorite restaurant so far! I always get the parmesan crusted chicken. Tastes so delicious  and the drinks are nice it would be nice if they always had special drinks tho but cant complain love this place!!! Forgot to mention the staff is very nice and accommodating, the service is usually busy but to me they always try their best to give customers a good service"
Jim C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Absolutely horrible experience. Ordered large pepperoni pizza, got slab of dough with almost no sauce and only a little cheese. And one pepperoni per slice. Don't waste your money on this dive folks! Sad, because the chain in Southern California is fantastic."
Catherine T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,17,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"Terrible service. Incompetent staff, mediocre food and way overpriced. You'd be better off driving through a McDonalds then getting anything from here. Had to wait over 2 hours for 3 items to get delivered when I live minutes away. I called and the girl who answered knew nothing, just repeated it would be there shortly. As expected it was cold. Cost me $70 to wait over 2 hours for unsatisfactory food and even worse service."
Tori M.,"Alameda, CA",29,29,22,5.0,11/22/2015,I talked to the manger Tom and he was very apologetic for the poor service. He accommodated me with a gift card to dine there again and the service and food was great this time. Definitely will be coming back. I appreciate how he reached out to me. It shows how they strive to please their guests.
somel y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,,1.0,10/1/2016,"Do not understand why people eat here.  Why oh why are there lines!?!  Actually waited 45 minutes for cold fries, lukewarm appetizers (oh wait, make that part hot, part cold, part something in between), and funky fish.  The ""deep dish"" pizza was all dough, very little toppings.  However, unlike the other reviews, my server was actually on top of things and friendly."
Thomas P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,1,1.0,4/16/2016,Waited over 20 minutes just to get my waiters attention JUST for a dessert ..... 40 mins later I got the dessert horrible just horrible
Robert F.,"Daly City, CA",1,5,,2.0,1/18/2015,"Went there for Sunday Brunch. There was no wait and our server arrived promptly. He politely took our drink orders and came back with our drinks and took our meal orders. That's when our good luck ran out.  My coffee arrived in a dirty cup and with a soup spoon. We got that resolved when our waiter finally brought the appetizer but were then left to enjoy it with our hands until the waiter swung by again to check on us and noticed that we had no utensils or napkin setup. This was also resolved with its attendant wait so that when the food arrived, we were ready to eat.  Unfortunately, while the food was just fine, my order was incomplete. This took more time to resolve.  We had earlier mentioned to our server that we would be ordering more food to go and when we added this to our order, the waiter took great care in making us believe that he was paying attention to get it right. Unfortunately, when the check came, it was incorrect. We got this additional problem resolved and decided to not protest the $3.25 charge for toast that I thought came with my meal. We're were treated to watching the folks at the table next to us arguing over their check with their waiter and wondered if there is a training issue here or a deliberate pattern.  We finished our meal and did not have to wait long for our takeout. We discovered that the $5.25 charge for Mac-n-cheese bought us about 7oz in a 16oz cup. The drink was $9.95 and the Bison Burger was un-satisfyingly small.  My final impression is that while the food is fine and the waiter personable & accommodating, the sheer number of issues that needed to be resolved, coupled with the cost, and wait all combine to put this place on my avoid list."
Michael L.,"Oakland, CA",1270,568,2315,5.0,5/30/2011,"I love BJ's.  Probably even more than the next guy.   I really think a general rule for most writing reviews is to give chain restaurants one less star just because it's a chain restaurant.  I refuse to fall in to the category. The BJ's here at Tanforan mall is a great place to meet up with friends, enjoy good food, and hang out.  Not formal at all, so my jeans and t-shirt work fine.  Flat screens all around to satisfy my sports needs. When with a date, the game is a great way to change the topic with my date if I don't like where the conversation is going. The buffalo wings and avocado rolls are scrumptious.  Southwestern Pizza is a delicious, high caloric nightmare-ish treat.  And if you want to leave feeling like a real fat a-s, a baked potato and a pizookie will finish the evening off perfectly. At BJ's you are gonna get good basic brewery food.  Don't expect Joel Robuchon to be cooking in back.  Expect pretty decent bar food, with good beer, and ok service."
Bella J.,"San Francisco, CA",1,5,3,1.0,4/10/2016,"Came here for lunch today with my family and it turn out the service and food quality went down hill.  We ordered the bbq chicken salad, bj pizza, shrimp panne pasta and 2 kids meal and some drinks.  We waited almost an hour and all the entree came and the pizza was not hot and the bbq chicken salad was still not ready so we end up canceling the salad. After eating I started having a up sad stomach!!! Probably will not come back again!"
Chef B.,"Belmont, CA",45,12,5,1.0,1/2/2015,"UNSANITARY alert :  I ordered the jalapeño burger MR and fries. Took  45 minutes to arrive  1) the food was cold ..not even room temp..it was cold, when I asked the waiter to throw it back on the grill I got major attitude he took it and came back 5 minutes later with the same cold burger..I was too hungry at that point so I just started eating it .. BUT..the major and very nasty thing happened when I realized there were bits of white paper towels (not the same color of the napkins that are on the tables ) IN my fries...I mean it looked like they tossed the fries with bits of white paper napkins...when I told the waiter he looked at me like I just cursed his mother and asked if I wanted another one....when I said no just take it off the bill , I got nothing but more attitude ... Health code violation seems to be a norm here , I know because I'm a chef and have worked in the field as a professional for over 10 years ...  Not only is the food nasty, service slow, and waiters awkwardly rude, but don't be surprised of you find unsanitary things in your food. The front of the house manager replied to my complaint by saying ; yeah I'll let the kitchen know ...if those where my cooks, they'd be written up/fired so serving unsanitary things. I'd recommend no one to waste money or risk a food borne illness from this place. I still feel a bit sick after eating here . Waiters are awkwardly rude, service sucks, food is unsanitary and management doesn't seem to really care . Hopefully they get a health dep. inspection in the very near future ."
Lynne F.,"San Jose, CA",5,41,,3.0,9/28/2014,"It's reassuring to read everyone else's reviews about the horrible service because I couldn't believe how badly we were treated like at this place. BJ's San Bruno: A series of unfortunate events: 1) 10 minutes before we had anyone come to our table and ask us for our drinks (11:40am on a Sunday) 2) Our server handing me 5 sets of utensils to distribute to the rest of our party instead of laying them on the table 3) Our ""deep dish pizza"" looking like DiGiorno's in depth and taste  4) Our server saying that that really is how they serve deep dish pizza and pointing at the pizza tray as if ""deep dish"" refers to 2-inch baking sheets and not type of pizza we should be expecting. (For the record, we've been to other BJ's locations that had true deep dish pizza, in baking accessories and in actual pizza.) 5) Another server admitting that there was something wrong with their fridge which is why the pizzas weren't coming exactly like they normally do, but doing nothing to improve the situation. 6) Our party looking for the manager and finding no one. 7) Overall douchiness of our server. Think Mendez from Orange Is The New Black.  We were really debating on whether or not to pull a LeSean McCoy and give a $0.20 tip. We didn't end up doing so, but I totally understand where he's coming from. 3 stars because the tomato bisque soup, french toast and spinach and artichoke dip were actually decent. Don't get the Happy Hour boneless wings because you'll get 6 teeny pieces of chicken."
Allie W.,"Alameda, CA",172,96,12,1.0,11/4/2014,"I was just going to let Sunday pass, chalk it up to, ""Its a stupid chain like they give a shit about food."" But when your WHOLE TABLE gets FOOD POISONING the next day, SOMETHING IS UP.  - Forgot we signed up for a table, when we checked in 20 min later to show our buzzer the front desk claimed we never signed up. ???? How do we have a buzzer if we never signed up? Yeaaaaaaah... - Two of our cups of water and one of our forks were filthy. Like...Food caked on it filthy, what the fuckery.  - Food was meh, I had cesear salad and clam chowder. Tasted like everything came from a can, including the lettuce. My brother asked for avocado  on his sandwich and only one side had it - had to flag down the waiter to get an extra piece. My boyfriend was happier that he was done with his sandwich and didn't have to deal with his meal vs ya know...actually liking what he was eating.  - Oh yeah, the food poisoning. Had a great night spewing shit outta both ends of my body. Thanks BJ's!"
Marion S.,"Berkeley, CA",155,9,54,1.0,1/21/2015,"I'm with a group of nine. We've already had to change our waiter. The service is EXTREMELY SLOW, our first waiter was a caught by the person at the end of our table rolling his eyes and sighing after being asked for something by the person at the opposite end of our table. When the manager was told how we felt like our table has been neglected, he's simply said "" let me see what I can do about that"" then simply changed our waiter. No apology, or anything.  The second waiter tried to make up for the first one. He did ok, but our table is full of dirty dishes as I type this. Oh, we accidentally knocked over a half full glass off soda, none of the staff offered to help clean it up and didn't even offer us a towel. I had to ask for something to clean it up. Then when he (the first waiter) returned, he just dropped a stack of of small square napkins on the table and walked away.   If we weren't hear celebrating something, and NINE of us, we would have just left..... The manager never even came by the table to check on things after changing our waiter. Smh.. Oohhhh, now that were asking for the corporate number the manager comes back out and now offering to comp our bill.   We would have taken better service!!"
Michael C.,"Daly City, CA",284,31,,4.0,1/5/2015,"Pizookie: Hot Cookie + Cold Ice Cream.  Also pasta, pizza, sandwich, original beers on tap. Family and friends will enjoy this place."
Annie J.,"San Francisco, CA",318,118,,4.0,3/27/2015,"I like this place! Always easy to pop over for a drink, and the bartenders are super nice. Pizookies are awesome (be careful, they are little but pack a punch).  I've also had the deep dish which was OK, but overall great place to come in the san bruno area if you want a quick bite and good atmosphere.  Also a great place to come for a game."
Bill F.,"Burlingame, CA",0,32,,2.0,1/13/2016,"I was there early before the lunch hour with a party of 7.    The food was good but the service was poor. 1.   After ordering, we had to wait 40 mins before our food arrived.   2.   We had to ask for refills for our drinks. 3.   Our glasses were not clean and still had lipstick on some of them. 4.   We had to ask for our check twice. It's a great location and I like the interior of the restaurant but service needs to improve."
Liz D.,"Sacramento, CA",109,417,50,4.0,1/19/2014,"Every time I come to BJ's sit at the bar.  It's more entertaining. Keith is ALWAYS awesome.  My sister and know him on a first name basis.  He's super friendly. I see how he introduces himself to customers. Dante is also super.  I thought Dante was a bartender, he's not. He's working to get promoted to waiter. He should be, he's ready. Very friendly and helpful. It's the great service that keeps me coming back at BJ's. I do wish they offered more vegetarian options such as a portobello or a roasted vegetable sandwich. I usually ordered appetizers that have no meat. Also I love the Grand Cru beer. It's their seasonal beer and it becomes permanent.  It's super delicious."
Marie M.,"San Diego, CA",0,105,4,2.0,3/14/2016,"We were starving and in the area so we popped into BJs.  Unhappy that I didn't read the reviews first.  It was pretty busy so we grabbed a seat in the bar.  Our server came over and because it was raining we chose not to risk drinking.  We ordered waters and we got an eye roll. It may have been imagines so I ignored it  We ordered dinner and my mothers meal was incorrect.  She ordered tacos and got a sandwich.  The runner said he'd look into it.  Our server came by a few minutes later and said she misheard but then said she only ordered to what my mother was pointing to. She never pointed to anything, her hand was resting on the menu  She said the order would be expedited and it would be 5 minutes tops 15 or 20 minutes later as my food sat iced cold she said that shrimp took a long time which is why it couldn't be expedited.  It was sautéed shrimp 3 minutes on each side.  The entire meal and evening was ruined by someone who couldn't do their job"
Tiff C.,"San Francisco, CA",1132,1047,1737,3.0,4/17/2011,BJ's is ALWAYS packed.. and I seriously don't get why?? I mean yes it's better than EBAR.. thats for d@mn sure.. but the food is mediocre.. when there are games on like the other day when I went... the place is full of bandwagoners who like to go out and grab a beer or two and ACT like they are watching the game.. We had a 30 minute wait which is pretty ridiculous.. and usually I wouldn't wait that long for a place like this but we wanted to be at a place where we could watch the game while grabbing dinner... what IS cool about BJ's is that they come around every so often offering mini slices of pizza to their waiting customers.. that's good CS right there. Ended up getting a seat at the bar area since its first come first serve... service was okay.. kind of slow.. food was okay..
