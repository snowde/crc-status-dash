Venus L.,"San Bruno, CA",187,607,1204,1.0,6/30/2013,"After my visit to this BJ's, I came home sad and with a tummy ache.  I know that experiences at restaurants could be a hit or a miss depending on when you go and who you get as your server. In this case, I guess it was a HUGE miss.  First off, we had 7 people in our party so they sat us as one of the booths on the right side. Unfortunately, my dad is a pretty big person so one side sat 3 people and the other side sat 4. It was painful since we were pretty squished even with ""skinny girls"" and another guy. We weren't able to put a chair at the end of the table because that's considered a fire hazard which we totally understood. But it was just a painful dining experience.  Next issue? The pizza. We ordered a large BJ's favorite and there was barely any toppings on the pizza which led us to think that we had gotten the wrong pizza. (We didn't. Boo.) And the pizza crust seemed WAY thinner than usual. Seriously? It became our least favorite thing on the menu.  The rest of the food came out about 15-20 minutes after the pizza. And well, I'm not sure about the others but my grilled chicken pasta came out cold. Not even slightly warm. Just... cold. And the chicken was dry. Needless to say, I was bummed but choked down the meal with the help of my root beer. And service? Our waiter was not in tune with our needs. And most of the time we had to flag him down. Which was not cool, especially since we saw him ask the tables around us repeatedly if they need anything. We felt ignored.  So overall, eh. We agreed that it was gonna take A LOT for us to give this place another chance. I dunno. Maybe it was just a miss this time and next time it'll be a hit? We'll wait and see."
Donyell A.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",182,35,36,3.0,1/26/2016,Stopped in for a quick bite during happy hour. I've been here plenty of times. I ordered hot wings ( flat pieces only) and something for my daughter. My order came and it wasn't as I ordered and the waitress said they didn't have any extra flat pieces??????  This is not my first time here or ordering this way. The waitress ordered me a new plate so I was satisfied.
Chito D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2016,Worst service experience yet. Waited for more than an hour to get a dinner table and another 30 minutes to wait for a server to give our order. We just left. Cant wait any longer. There were vacant tables and they are not short of servers.
Tina C.,"San Mateo, CA",15,27,55,1.0,10/26/2014,Literally was just at this BJs like 20 mins ago. When we walked in the hostesses just looked at us like why are you here? They didn't say hi or anything and we had to ask for a table for 2.  We got seated and after a few mins the waiter came over and asked us if we wanted drinks and appetizers. We ordered waters and told him we were all set to order. He said okay and then he left without taking our orders. Then 5 mins later another girl came and brought us water. The waiter didn't come back so we drank the water and left. Now we are at Chili's down the street receiving much better service.
Melissa S.,"Reno, NV",40,148,43,4.0,1/14/2015,"I go here when it's late and I'm hungry, because it's open until midnight. The service is sometimes slow. Nothing to really complain about. I really like that they have plenty of different things to choose from. Pizza, sandwhiches, burgers, soups, salads...... And a lot of alcohol. If you don't like to watch drunken people eat, do not come here. However, if you enjoy decent food or need to get something to eat after a mall trip, then this is a good place for you. I'm a sucker for salmon. I recommend their Atlantic salmon and their avocado egg rolls."
Allison M.,"Daly City, CA",3,17,4,2.0,11/16/2014,"The only reason i am giving this a lower rating is their service. Where do i begin... I LOVE BJS. I have been to many bjs and was excited to find one in tanforan. Boy was i wrong. I will not be going back. This is my 4th shot trying this one out .... And i know why my boyfriend hates coming here. Service is slow.. They always forgrt something... Their drinks are... Eh. I ordered a side salad last time. Did not arrive. I ordered appetizers this time... They tried to put them AFTER our food came out, apologizing that they never made it out. I think i will pass. So unfortunate because i truely love a pizza or appetizers and drinks here. I tried!!! And now i wont be back... Maybe just to go."
Sonny Q.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,81,18,1.0,11/16/2015,"Ordered avocado roll, spinach artichoke dip and fried calamari. Got the spinach (bland) and calamari (average). After a few minutes they brought us a wrong order for the avocado roll. Name of server is Alexis. I end up having the avocado roll for To go. We ordered also hot green tea and raspberry ice tea. When we got green tea, it was warm & on a mug. Usually they give you an envelope of the tea & hot water. Alexis probably just re warm the mug after we complain. Also I asked for refill of my raspberry tea & she just added water over it or the refill tank for the tea was empty. Poor quality of service. We were suppose to get entry food but end up going home. Try Jack's across the street  or Crepevine in Burlingame next time."

Kirandeep S.,"Stockton, CA",14,13,11,1.0,8/12/2014,"Where do I even begin....  This BJs restaurant, is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to in terms of service!!! I asked for a spoon and the waitress NEVER came back with a spoon for my soup.. So I sat there and stared at it, until I could get another server's attention, and he took his sweet time too.  I've been to this restaurant about 6 times, each time I go in hoping for things to be better but I'm disappointed every time. Also, BEWARE, sometimes if you ask to speak to a manager, some of the servers will come to your table posing as a ""service manager"" to try and resolve matters on their own without involving the REAL manager! The food here has not been satisfying, either...almost as crappy as their service!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
Amber Leila E.,"Norristown, PA",22,16,18,4.0,3/2/2016,Decent mojito good aps!decent mojitos.. Don't muddle mint properly.  Good appetizers wanted the avocado egg role but it's like1080 calories!!  Nice server
Aileen C.,"Cupertino, CA",242,97,345,4.0,2/28/2013,"Great food and great company!! This was my first visit at the BJ's in San Bruno, and I have to say that the food was better than my expectation. I have been to the BJ's in Cupertino a handful of times and each time I went, my expectations were lowered.   I came here with a party of eleven (three children) for lunch on a Sunday. When I first came in, I went straight to the hostess to ask for a table; she told me that it would be 30min to 1hr. She never mentioned that we could sit outside, which would be immediate seating, until the rest of the party came in. -______- If you sit outside, it does get a little noisy, as the airplanes land.   As a group, we shared various appetizers.  We had the buffalo, orange chicken wings and boneless wings, and potato wedges.  The potato wedges were BOMB!! very crispy, right amounts of cheese, bacon, and green onion.  I think the best thing I ate that afternoon.  I also shared the Cajun chicken with my cousin.   When the plate came out, the food was very hot, which I LOVE!  I had imagined it to taste some what like jambalaya, but it just tasted like grilled chicken :(  I also had a rib, which was DELICIOUS! :)"
Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4220,3902,30007,3.0,1/17/2011,"I have to admit that the only reason I've ever come to BJ's is the convenience of its location en route to SFO. There is really nothing distinctive about the menu compared to a Chili's or a Hard Rock Cafe or an Applebee's, and the service is basically the same as those chains as well. What struck me about my visit there was the prominence of the calorie counts under each item, and the fact that they actually influenced my choice.  Y'see, I was on my way to the airport to start a 2 1/2-week holiday in Iberia and Morocco fully recognizing that I wasn't going to make nutrition a huge priority when I crossed the pond. In fact, I could have used a calorie count on the bowl of snails I ate at a random food stand in the expansive night market in Marrakesh. BJ's doesn't offer snails, but they make decent Fish Tacos. Panko-crusted and lightly fried fish served in corn tortillas with a chipotle mayonnaise, Santa Fe dressing, and shredded vegetables (see photo).  It was satisfying especially with some tortilla chips and a couple of dipping sauces - avocado cream sauce and fire-roasted tomato salsa. I added a side salad for good measure, dressing on the side of course (see photo). It was a perfectly acceptable pitstop on the way to the airport, and the timing was right since the baby brigade started rolling in as we were about to leave. I was particularly impressed with a young mother who tried to feed her two toddlers only to have one boy shrieking like a banshee and forcing her to abandon her plans of a quiet lunch. The snails don't seem so bad now, do they... FOOD - 3 stars...like pretty much any other chain that serves basic brewhouse fare but at least with a calorie tracker  AMBIANCE - 3 stars...what you'd expect from a family-style mall eatery  SERVICE - 3 stars...I honestly don't remember  TOTAL - 3 stars...if you need an inoffensive bite before your flight"
Rick K.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,105,34,2.0,12/7/2015,"Been to the bar here many times for sports events. Never had a problem.  Dining at this location has always been a crap shoot.  Last night's experience was no different.    BJ's is ""churn and burn"". Servers are young and often inattentive.  They attempt to take your entire order, stack each course up on the table before you've had a chance to enjoy or barely taste your appetizer, salad or soup.  There were 4 of us this evening and no one got a refill, 2nd beer, ice tea, etc without first flagging down a staff member who then called our server.  Being familiar with this style of service, I simply don't order all at once which forces the server to space the courses out a bit and actually allows us to enjoy the food.  It wasn't a Friday evening with a long wait.  There were several empty tables in our server's station and he could have done a little better.  Our appetizers were tasty, but my wife's Asparagus salad didn't come with its asparagus.  We mentioned it...  but it never came.  Another member in our party never got her salad either.  Once again, we mentioned it, but it too, never came. In the end, a manager ended up crediting us for about 1/3 of our bill.  We didn't ask for this, but clearly he was aware of the mistakes, which didn't seem to stop.  We skipped dessert."
Toni S.,"Daly City, CA",3,30,29,1.0,8/27/2015,"Horrible horrible service. Server was non attentive, order was wrong, couldn't get the attention of the server to even make the correction. When the order finally came it was burnt and had to be sent back, which took another long wait. Really don't plan on coming back........"
Samantha T.,"Berlin, Germany",229,136,17,4.0,12/31/2014,"Love this place!!! They have a huge menu and everything I have tried has been delicious. One star off because their house kölsch would make a real german sad, but their other beers were better. Service is good, food is yummy, atmosphere is fun, and prices are justified. If you're coming here for dinner, prepare to wait! This place is usually pretty crowded at night."
Emma L.,"Tahoma, CA",30,29,2,2.0,11/1/2014,2 stars because our server was nice. But the pizza would have been better if it was made out if card board. My mojito was 9.50 and literally had no alcohol in it  I'm Offended and will never be coming back
Lisa D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,2,5.0,12/10/2015,Love their egg rolls come here all the time friends family its awesome service is great I recommend to come to this restaurant with friends family
Brittney V.,"San Francisco, CA",60,31,,1.0,9/23/2014,"F!! F F F!! I've given this place so many chances and every time I have had shitty service. Waiters are slow, hostesses have attitude, and every time a manager has to step in (which is often), it's always someone new. Hmm... I am done with you BJ's. I don't care how close you are to my apartment.  And your tap water actually tastes like tap water!!"
Shadi K.,"San Francisco, CA",93,175,115,1.0,11/7/2014,"Ordered some food to Go.  Half way thru the salad, long black piece of hair appears.  Group had to stop eating and dispose of all the food, waste of money and time.  Sanitation is a MUST and should be taken more seriously. Please don't tamper with people food and enforce a better cleanliness policy because apparently  the existing one isn't working."
Ema M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/28/2017,"This place is ridiculous. I called on a Saturday and asked them if they would Be able to accommodate a party of 9. They said it would take an hour, so I put my name on their wait list, showed up an hour later and when checking in they told us they can only seat us in two separate booths that are next to each other. I had explained to them that when speaking to someone who put my name and party size on the wait list that I was not told it would be in booths. The host called over the manager and she talked to the host right in front of us and then the host relayed the message, the manager didn't even have the curiosity to talk to us (we were literally standing two feet away).  The host said their tables were booked for the whole night and said they only had booths and told us to next time tell them we want a table.  Why would a party of any size want to go out to eat to be seated separately ?! Needless to say we had to find a restaurant last minute to accommodate our party."
