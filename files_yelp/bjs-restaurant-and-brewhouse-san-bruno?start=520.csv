Leina K.,"San Francisco, CA",71,436,467,3.0,11/19/2013,"ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS BUSY! No matter when you want to go, it's always busy. The best thing to do is to do call ahead seating where they will put you on the waiting list as though you were there. I will usually call an hour ahead and still end up waiting 5-10 minutes."
Rebekah T.,"El Cerrito, CA",4554,2003,10334,3.0,1/20/2011,"I had not been to Tanforan in years and since before it was BJ's, but I had to go to Target and needed to pick up some dinner. Deciding between the food court or chain restaurants. :I A place called BJ's Restaurant that serves beer and steaks? That's where I'm going. I ordered a BJ's Harvest Hefeweizen with my 1/2 pound Grilled Sourdough Angus burger with cheese and grilled onions. I asked for medium and the burger came out pretty good. The beer was fantastic, crisp tasting with hints of orange. Went well with my meal. He ordered the Flame Broiled NY Strip Steak with the Gigantic Baked Potato and a small Chicago Style Classic combo pizza. The steak was good, but the pizza tasted exactly like Pizza Hut. It was pretty average and forgettable with a oily crust and I didnt eat more than a couple bites. There were some great points to BJ's and for a chain restaurant they have good beer and decent steaks and burgers."
Dustin P.,"Millbrae, CA",0,17,27,5.0,5/9/2015,Krystal the manager and Rob our waiter provided us with excellent service! They treated us extremely well and made our dinner fun and enjoyable! Thank you Krystal and Rob!
L D.,"Raleigh, NC",0,37,,1.0,9/9/2016,"By far the worst service we have had at a restaurant in a long time. Waiter was happy to take drink orders, awhile later took food and drink refill orders. We were a table of four, it took about 45 mins before everyone was fully served. First food came out after 20 mins, next order 10 mins later and last order 15 mins later, only after we flagged someone down. Then came the drink refills. And the place wasn't even crowded. Only go here if you aren't really hungry or in a hurry. Def we aren't returning. Oh, no apologies from anyone nor a manager-type to visit our table."
Dale B.,"Shingle Springs, CA",10,66,3,2.0,3/15/2015,"Service lousy, ribeye mostly fat. Mashed potatoes stone cold. The server never even came back to see if everything was ok, after forgetting the silverware and my NA beer. This place has truly gone out of fashion. I'm being generous with 2 stars.  The local small sushi places knock this out of contention normally.  But I was feeling like a decent steak tonight...Fail!  I always leave a tip but I can't even do that here tonight."
Silvia B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/4/2015,This used to be one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants.  The past couple of times we have gone the brought the wrong order to our table and we had to wait almost an hour for a hamburger while all the people around us got their food right away.  The waiters don't seem to be as attentive as before. I wonder if the Manager has changed? services seems to be going downhill for sure!
Andre D.,"San Bruno, CA",15,72,24,1.0,2/19/2016,Just got here they seated us and had us sitting in the back for 10 min before some one asked us if we had a server. We said no. Waited 5 more min and walked out. I'm goin to round table!!!
D M.,"San Jose, CA",34,8,1,2.0,3/4/2016,More of bar food rather than restaurant food. Calamari was not seasoned but sauces were provided on the side. They had very small crispy fries which might as well be called potato sticks/chips. Meat lover's pizza was extremely salty with an overwhelming flavor of ham. Service was okay but a long wait for the food when it is pretty packed.
Justin B.,"San Francisco, CA",117,116,197,3.0,8/1/2014,"I have been to this Bjs a few times and had good experiences.  The food is always consistent and fresh. They have great lunch specials that hit the spot and are very affordable.  Service is pretty good and we usually get seated quickly during lunch. Most of the time we are in and out within 30-45 minutes. Great location too,  right off the 380 and 280.  Today we ordered the bbq lunch slider special and was delicious.  Only $6.95 and came out 10 mins after we ordered it. They also have a great rewards program where they give you free desserts based on points and sometimes discounts."
Kelley w.,"Pacifica, CA",17,25,24,5.0,11/17/2015,I don't know why people bash this place. It's pretty cool with a large menu and TVs everywhere. 5 stars for a nice clean bar and great job from Keith made my meal great.
Don M.,"Corona, CA",0,8,6,1.0,11/30/2016,"If I could give it a zero I would. This is not typical of service I would expect at this restaurant. This was a not overly crowded night at all, we were seated immediately. I had to get up out of my seat and ask another server to locate my server after several servers passed by. The service was slow, And although our server was nice it was overshadowed by the slowness and inattention to getting orders serving the food and overall non-customer friendly atmosphere. food was OK, at least we didn't get sick, and my strawberry lemonade was lukewarm with approximately five ice cubes in it. I had to ask for water twice before I received it after another long delay. there was no silverware at the table.  When I receive good service, I will be the first to write about it, but the service was absolutely unacceptable. If not for the fact we just arrived out of town on a flight and had no other restaurant alternatives nearby we would've gotten up and left. I intend to write the corporate office and hope that this location will be contacted and some additional training or soft skills maybe offered to it's employees. if I could have located a manager I would have expressed my concerns and dissatisfaction to them but there was none to be found. You've been warned."
Rich L.,"South San Francisco, CA",5,25,1,1.0,7/4/2014,"Very disappointed. I've been to a few other BJ's locations and they were much better.  We had a party of six and one in a highchair. We asked for Gluten Free menus ( which they advertise they have) but were told by the manager that all they had were ""these"" and were handed a nutrition information flyer. She also said that some of the things on the flyer weren't available here, but never said which were or were not available.  When we did receive our order one entree was wrong (why would you put onion strings on a Burger you acknowledged and referred to as Gluten Free), one was missing and didn't arrive until everyone else had finished and we never got a refill of our drinks.  The place was packed and had a wait of about 30 minutes for a table, so they have no real motivation to improve things.  Won't be going back to this spot...ever!"
Julie M.,"Daly City, CA",300,2,,1.0,11/16/2014,"I've always come here to be greeted by friendly hostesses and waiters. Last night, I was truly disappointed. Not only could our waiter speak proper English but he was TERRIBLY slow. It took about 40 minutes to receive our food and it took about 10 minutes for us to devour our food from our longing hunger.  To make things even better, I came home to a wonderful sitting of diarrhea and woke up at 4am to spew my guts out to my toilet. Thanks for your wonderful FOOD POISONING."
Andie T.,"Glendora, CA",310,5,,5.0,3/16/2016,"ate dinner on the patio tonight and the service was great! Ordered a beer and a couple appetizers and the meals were coursed perfectly! Our server, Charles, checked back regularly to make sure everything was great. The manager Krystal came by and touched the table and made the experience that much better. Would definitely recommend!!"
Russ T.,"South San Francisco, CA",20,20,,1.0,3/21/2015,"Usually, we get good service & good food here at BJ's. Tonight is not one of those night.  Tonight, my wife got the pulled pork BBQ sandwich, the thin fries & an ice tea. I got the unlimited soup & salad with a diet Pepsi. My wife's dinner was fine, but had to ask for sugar; no problem. But I asked for the chili & a house salad; the salad wad fine but the chili was a bit too salty & not very good.   Then the waiter picked up the dishes & my wife had to remind him I got the unlimited soup & salad. I ordered a broccoli & cheese soup, a caesar salad & a refill on my drink. First came my drink, then the soup but the salad never came. The soup wasn't good either & I had enough bad service.  I asked for a box & our check. The waiter knew him blew it & sent another waiter to deliver the check. Just as I paid the check, the salad came.   The perfect end to a crappy meal.  Get some better help, BJ."
Nida K.,"Oakland, CA",20,379,62,2.0,12/8/2012,"Okay. So the food was greasy and incredibly oily. Wait... those two things are the same thing, huh? Well anyway, the food was nasty and I got stomach aches from it through out the night. Also, the restaurant was very dirty. It looked like they hadn't dusted in weeks!! It was just unsanitary!  The strawberry margarita was yummy and gave me a buzz which helped me swallow the food.  Okay... so, I added 2 pictures at the end of the picture roll of how DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY this place was!! Please check them out! Pictures # 449-450 - to see my finger filled with the dust I swiped off the counter!"
Jay D.,"Concord, CA",106,38,1,1.0,3/15/2017,"So I have a number of issues I have experienced during the last month which is funny since we go on non peak times when most of the staff are just standing around. Being the supposed decent dessert place opened late in San Bruno, its not like there is another alternative to go elsewhere so apparently give BJs more chances than it deserves, though HOOTER's San Bruno has permanently burned a page in my book. Honestly you'd think the pazookie was one they have mastered and could not screw up. WRONG! So we ordered a total of 5 pazookies, which normally they are cooked well with crispy bottoms. though these was really doughy, had a grainy consistency and by morning I at least know two of us experienced stomach issues. It honestly does not seem like things will get better, which I agree with other posts that if it wasn't the closest thing that sold dessert opened late, it probably wouldn't still be in business. You can view by amount of dislike for the brand that if another late night spot like a buffalo wild wings came in that it would destroy the BJs since people like Diane who work there give it a lousy name though she is one of a few people who work for the BJs brand who experience a piss poor attitude and lack of urgency that they experience more time fraternizing and ignoring the request of their clientle. Probably also would have been better if they at least acted like they wanted to help and smiled. I hope BJs does what Chipotle did and hold a company wide meeting to improve quality and the face of their brand. Oh and I forgot to add that my appetizers tend to be non existent since they usually are burnt beyond the point of where they can even be consumed where my potato skins essentially were literally just the skin since they were burnt to the point where the potato itself didn't exist anymore."
Mike L.,"El Granada, CA",613,115,,1.0,8/6/2015,"Service could be a bit faster. Need more servers especially the one that served us, made it seem he didn't want to be here. Now food is good and cocktails. Servers being at lunch at too late of an hour. Entrees came out in time. The server also said they only have one bartender is clueless. They should hire a second bartender inexcusable. Repeating the menu over and over again. Like he's not paying any attention to us. Poor quality service. Now Shay provided excellent service by checking in with her staff now that's a good person to have as a staff person. Dessert Poozookie Oreo Cookie outright deserves this as a 5 star dessert."
Charlene H.,"Chicago, IL",0,23,,2.0,10/17/2015,We are on vacation and tried this restaurant.  The ambiance and modernization of the building is enticing which is how we entered the restaurant.  The host was non friendly.  Our waiter was nice enough but slow with our order and revising out table.  This is all forgivable.  The problem was the food.  Everything was overcooked.  Out calamari came out dark brown and super crisp.  Then our chowder came out watery.  Then the ribs came out overcooked and dry.  And last our dessert the cookie came out overcooked and hard to get out the pan.  We complained to the manager who was very apologetic but this did not change the quality of the food.  If you like dining out and want a wow experience run from this place.
Hank F.,"Rialto, CA",20,21,,3.0,7/24/2016,"The food is good, service is a mixed bag. All all friendly but it's kinda messy upfront getting checked in no real line people get help out of order. Mostly putting this review out because the carpet really stinks. Especially the whole back area. Please, steam it or just get rid of it!!!!!"
