Jonathan W.,"Western Addition/NOPA, San Francisco, CA",158,4,7,3.0,2/21/2015,Went there last night. It was busy and a long wait so I hoped in the bar area got a seat pretty fast. The Food. I order shrimp tacos. The are on the shrimp did not have any flavor. There was only 2 tacos  and some chips and salsa. Should have had 3 tacos or more chips wasn't full after eating The drinks. I had a strawberry mojito pretty good  The desert. Mini bouzouki I think that how it's call pretty good ice cream on a warm cookie The SERVICE. This is why only put 3 stars  Our server was attentive at first then disappeared after ordering. My friend order a salad to come first and he had to tell her again. Then the salad shows up a min before the food. Then we finish eating and waited 20 min until we got our check.
Jeremy O.,"Mountain View, CA",1,15,,4.0,10/3/2015,I eat here very regularly like probably twice a month.  The only reason I do not give five stars is I have had subpar service once but usually the service is great.  I love the food here.  The Baked Beignet I think its called is great for dessert.  They have awesome ribs here.  They make great pizza.  Drinks are all good.  I highly recommend this place and I am actually surprised it does not have better reviews overall.  This place is definitely a lot better than the two stars I see a lot of people giving them.  Maybe not worth five stars but definitely 3 to 4 stars.  Kind of feel when I read people's reviews that have been here multiple times they obviously like the food but get one subpar experience and only do a review then.
Christina X.,"Millbrae, CA",249,46,12,4.0,1/5/2016,"great atmosphere! servers are usually super nice and helpful. the seating is super comfy.  good place to watch sports! the bar is the best place because the TVs might be hard to see in the regular seating area. The bar is first come first serve so it might be a little hard to find a place to sit on game days. Happy hour is extended when there's a football game on!  Great place, but I give it 4 stars because they stopped putting a sugar rim on the cup of my strawberry lemonade."
Richard S.,"Fairfield, CA",0,8,2,1.0,3/8/2016,What a miserable experience. Mens room was something straight out of a nightmare. Urine all over the floor plus after mentioning it to the bartender nothing was done even after he said it was. Kind of hard to eat a meal after you use the restroom wash your hands and feel like you need to shower afterwards. Never again will I eat or enter this place again.
M T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,199,,4.0,8/22/2016,"Lots of menu choices for food, beer, and drinks.  Prices reasonable.  Portions large.  Service was excellent the night we went for dinner in August 2016 (party of four).  Bill was $113.90 before tax and tip, for which we got:  1 appetizer, 4 entrees, 4 alcoholic drinks (one glass of wine, two beers, one prosecco), and 2 desserts (both single scoops of ice cream).  The most expensive entrée our arty ordered was the full rack of BBQ ribs ($22.95).  The least expensive entrée was the beef sliders with fries ($11.50), but even at that low price there were four medium size sliders and a lot of fries (a good value. I will return."
R. A. D.,"South San Francisco, CA",32,71,107,2.0,9/13/2014,This place is always overly packed in weekends.  Which is why I did a call ahead.  Called ahead and was quoted for 25 min wait time. Added name and arrived 20 minutes later.  Checked in and quoted for another 25 minutes. Call ahead was extremely pointless. Two stars are for the location and the usual food I always order.
Caitlyn C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,10,12,1.0,11/22/2016,"My boyfriend and I tried to give BJs a second chance after a bad previous experience months ago. When we came in tonight we waited 25 minutes to be seated, neither of us minded. Our waiter was amazing and very helpful, but when it came to the food it was DISGUSTING and I would never come back because of it. I ordered a gluten free bacon guacamole burger, when it came out the first time it was on a regular bun...our waiter took it back and was greatly apologetic for the mistake. We waited 15 more minutes while his food was on the table getting cold. When I received my food again the bun was hard as a rock, I told our waiter and he offered to get me a new bun but I was so hungry I declined and contributed eating. As I took a bite nearing the center of the burger I found myself with a mouthful of cold uncooked ground beef. Although the staff was willing to make amends for the food, I would never come back again."
Jordan S.,"San Francisco, CA",101,42,16,1.0,12/8/2014,"One star, only because of their service. I've been to BJ's many times throughout the years, and the food is reasonable, and I like their Pazookies. However, today the service was really bad. It was bad enough for me to finally write a review.  My girlfriend and I were very patient with our waiter, Mark, and he completely ignored us throughout our time there. We counted 6 specific times he checked on everyone in our section EXCEPT us. We were planning on eating dessert but the wait was so long, and basically killed our entire mood there. I had to physically get out of our booth in order to pay our check. Huge disappointment."
Sheila M.,"Daly City, CA",0,6,4,2.0,9/4/2016,"First and most likely last time here. Swrvice was very average. We sat waiting for our food for nearly 20 minutes and our server never really checked in to see how we were or let us know what was going on. Yet he was *very* attentive to the table next to us. WTF? Food was not thrilling & when they brought it, one of the sauce containers had spilled all over the entree. Definitely NOT coming back. Ever."
Jacob K.,"Fresno, CA",1,4,,1.0,2/16/2016,Horrible service. Got seated and waitress forgot about us and got other people that had been seated after us their orders first. Food was ok but nothing to brag about. Just got back into the US and was hungry and it was not what I was hoping for.
Joan H.,"Moorpark, CA",0,20,,1.0,9/3/2016,"I was visiting my daughter and before dropping me off at SFO we decided to stop and get a late lunch. It started out fine, got seated quickly, waitress took our order. When our salads arrived they looked great. As we started eating a beetle crawled out of my daughters salad! I tried to flag down a server with no luck. I went up to the front and  interrupted 2 employees chatting.  The guy came to our table and saw the beetle crawling on the plate and removed the food to the back and said he would have someone come over. After waiting 10-15 minutes and no one coming to our table I went up to the front and asked the hostess to get the manager. I waited there for about 10 minutes and asked again for manager. She said he is in his office and said he should be out soon. I waited up front a while longer and could see the manager coming this way but stopping to talk to some staff along the way. When he finally got to me he asked what I wanted. I told him about the beetle and instead of apologizing he asked what type of beetle it was and what it looked like! When I told him I didn't know what type and did that really matter, it crawled out of the salad! He said he would give me a gift card if that would help. I did take the gift card but I'm not sure if I will ever go to a BJs again and I know for sure I will never go back to this one. This was the worst manager I have ever dealt with and they need to have better kitchen health department checks."
Haley F.,"Plymouth, NH",0,1,,5.0,3/13/2016,"First time coming here while vacationing from New Hampshire. I've heard all about the pzookies so when I saw one was near our hotel I knew I had to try it. Our server was Tyler and he was super friendly and very attentive. We got an appetizer and then we waited a little while for our meal, but we were both fine (I'm a waitress so I understand when things can take more time than others). Even so the manager made sure to stop by and apologize for the wait. Food was all absolutely delicious, overall a great experience."
Peter A.,"Pacifica, CA",23,165,16,1.0,10/16/2014,I sat down for a brief  lunch here last weekend and it was so cold I had to go back amd get a jacket. I ordered the cheese burger and fries. The burger was small and the fries so greasy I could not eat them. The menu is so big and the place is very loud dont waste your money. Better options are near by but this mall is a schlock fest of lcd everything.
Lauren K.,"San Francisco, CA",390,553,2093,4.0,12/20/2010,"This is one of the favorite restaurants among my friends and family. There's usually a wait so what I usually do is call in ahead of time and put my name down since they don't take reservations. I've eaten here during lunch before where they give you food while you wait (I've gotten pizza slices before!). This BJ's is at such a great location and even though there's a long wait at times, I just grab the pager I'm given and go shopping! Today, with 9 of us for my friend's birthday, we were told the wait would be 1 1/2 hours (on a Sunday night). It took a littles less than that and after checking in a couple of times, we were seated. I ordered the Chicken Pesto Flatbread and that was enough to fill me up. My friends had the potato skin appetizers and they said that filled them up so much that they could barely finish their entree! Service was great as usual. The waiter was friendly and we instantly connected. He even cracked some jokes and was really patient with us even though we were a bit loud and indecisive at times.  Food came out fast and no one had complaints. I loved what I ordered even though usually I order Cobb Salad, Turkey Avocado Sandwich, or one of their deep dish (Buffalo Chicken) pizzas.  I love coming here on birthdays because they give out complimentary mini Chocolate Chip Pazookies with a candle. Prices are decent. It's not cheap but it's pretty worth it for the portion size. I guess price is normal compared to they're competitors: Chilis, TGI Fridays, etc. I always come here like everyone else: for a good movie and delicious dinner!"
Christian B.,"Hayward, CA",5,8,12,3.0,8/19/2015,I went here @8/17 around 1ish. I was with my girlfriend. Knowing I had work in an hour 1/2 I tried to squeeze in a quick dish and dessert and see if they would serve pretty fast. We were seated right away and took a quick second to look at the menu. I was able to use the restroom and the server still did not come to our table yet. He took about 10-15 mins. Joseph our waiter had a very soft voice like he didn't want to be there/careless. We ordered a personal pizza with one topping and a salad side and a cookies n creame pizookie. Salad came out pretty fast but the pizza took a little long and our pizookie didn't come out until I had to leave. I just wish our waiter was little more caring about his job. The pizza was delicious but my topping was like only 3 pieces of pepperoni while my girlfriend had a lot of pineapples.
Cameron C.,"Tustin, CA",0,15,1,1.0,3/1/2016,Just arrived to the unmanned reception. Waited 7 minutes and got a lecture from the hostess. Sat outside another 15 watched people seated afterwards get served. Finally gave up and left. Never again!
Christopher X.,"Millbrae, CA",62,92,86,4.0,9/29/2014,"I'm being nice with this place by giving them 4 stars because I know they can do better. First off, the food was great. They screwed up on some things, though the pizza was fantastic. I ordered the bison burger with fries, and it was delicious! A bit over-cooked, but what do you expect from a place like this? I can tell you that our server was nice, but she left for her break in between without warning, and came back later! This place is also prime vampire territory. I know it's for the ambience, but the restaurant is so poorly lit I might as well guess who I'm talking to. Overall satisfaction for me. Drop in for some good finger food and football."
Jason C.,"Manhattan, NY",388,541,490,2.0,12/9/2012,Gone downhill over the years. Buffalo wings were just chicken tenders with some sauce poorly tossed in. I can still see the breading. Pizza was poorly made. Toppings were all just on one side of the pizza. The pizza was hardly even cut. Pizza no longer served in pan. Took 10 mins for server to refill drink Pizookie was still good.
Alyssa M.,"San Francisco, CA",88,78,26,1.0,6/27/2015,"I would like to start off by saying I have only been to the San Bruno and Foster City locations.  Foster City: service is slow. Staff is attentive to their designated tables. Good customer service. Sometimes I've had to flag another waiter to get my tables check because our waiter went MIA. Overall descent.  San Bruno: service is slow. Staff is not attentive to their designated area. Customer service lacks any sort of quality. The wait is always long because it's a smaller location inside a mall. On my most recent visit, I walked in and saw an empty booth I wanted but was dirty. I stood there for a few minutes and no one came. So we sat at a high top table. There were 3 servers all helping tables around where I was sitting and it started to feel awkward when we weren't being helped. It was out lunch break and we didn't have time to sit and wait for someone to never help us. After 5 minutes a waiter walked over to the table next to me, that sat down after me and he took their order. He walked right by me and wouldn't make any eye contact. If I was sitting at a table where no one was working, one he could have told me he would take care of us or had us move to his section, maybe a table over. But no. Him and 3 other servers kept walking past us. Didn't ask us anything and weren't planning on helping us at all. I walked up to the bar and the bartender just so happened to be extremely apologetic and hospitable.  However my order came out wrong and it took forever to fix and by the time I got it and started to eat we had been there for 45 minutes! I do not recommend the San Bruno location at all. I overheard a server say it was going to be a good day for him because he got 20% on his first table. Wow. There were guys that sat down after U.S. But behind us and they got up and left about 15 min of waiting and no one came to help them.  As a former server, I felt so angry at the workers for not informing me someone wasn't here yet, they could have helped me! But they didn't and they just lost my business and anyone I ever talk to!"
Mimi M.,"Redwood City, CA",2,11,,4.0,12/24/2014,"I love BJ's! (You can take that absolutely any way you want and you're probably not wrong) I'm a fiend for the Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I can never finish it and always have leftovers for the next day or later that night but I always forget to get the darn Pizookie!!!!!! Some day....  I'm a hard customer, though! (Gosh! So many references!) keep the refills coming and the tips are sure to come!"
