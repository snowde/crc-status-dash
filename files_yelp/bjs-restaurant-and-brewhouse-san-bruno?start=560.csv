Jackie M.,"South San Francisco, CA",15,77,31,1.0,6/14/2014,"This review is only based on the service we received tonight. I come here at least 3 or 4 times a week and we always have great service especially with Kelly my favorite here but tonight our server was Jeffrey, didn't check on us until 20 minutes into eating my food, didn't bring us silverware had to ask another server for it. And when I asked for a re fill I over heard him saying ""It's not even finished"" to the bevtender. I'm a server also so I know what good customer service is and him thinking he's such a great server makes him an even worse one. Rude and fake service."
James A.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,2,,3.0,8/22/2016,"Been coming here for a while and man, it sucks that the quality of this place has gone down quite a bit. The service is alright, but the food is beginning to taste a bit plain. I'm worth giving it another try but only as a last resort for a night out."
V W.,"Las Vegas, NV",572,602,197,2.0,5/14/2014,"I really wanted to give BJ'S at least 3 stars, but unfortunately I can't.  Here are the two reasons why I'm giving them 2 stars. I came in last weekend with my husband and I ordered an asian salad off the light menu and they got my order wrong twice.  I had request no onions or bell peppers in my salad and both times my salad arrived with those items on it. By the third time I was just starving so I ended up picking out all the items off my salad. In all honesty I would have enjoyed my salad if I hadn't spend so much time picking through it. The other thing that made this visit very memorable in a bad way is that a few hours later my husband began to feel queazy and we figured it was the burger he had. He ordered a bison burger done medium well and it was obviously undercooked and or mishandled. My husband spent the entire night vomiting with other symptoms, which only means 1 thing. Food poisoning!!! I'll say that I've been to other BJ's many times and everything was about a 3 star review, but this visit was probably the absolute worst and most likely I will never come back or recommend this place to anyone. My idea of a positive dining experience includes not getting sick. This place is definitely without a doubt 2 thumbs down and if you come here don't say you weren't warned."
Kjeld P.,"San Francisco, CA",84,11,,4.0,9/28/2015,"I'm writing this because this place doesn't deserve a 2.5 stars rating. I think the expectations for it, is high, because the way the place looks, and a bit on the prices you expect maybe a little more. Most complaints have being on the waiting time and on the food not being close to the amount it costs, their prices are on the 10,20s range, the salads could be less, and cost the same amount of the burgers. I always went with a burger and a beer, and left satisfied, if their selection has fewer things they could maybe get a better rating. I never had the waiting be too long, maybe came here on a weekday and lucked out. But again if you compare a 2.5 star place with this you know this is better, and I'm happy to have it as an option as there aren't many places like it around. As for the people running,  -less on the menu, make it tastier, fresher -keep the good waiters, they have them, be more efficient on unattended tables."
Tina M.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,2,7,3.0,2/2/2016,"Last Saturday we were there for dinner my friends and I. At the beginning the service was terrible!!! There was a waitress by the name of Jasmin. She must have been the rudest waitress, the way she talk to my friends. My friend asked to talk to the manager. The manager's name was James, he was very respectful and helpful. After we had an encounter with James. The service was much better.  The waiter we got his name was Miguel. He was a very good waiter.  James the manager made sure that the night would be pleasant for us.  If more managers like James in restaurants would have a five-star review from other guests!!!"
Wayne W.,"San Francisco, CA",81,98,2,4.0,7/3/2014,"I came here a few times but the latest one was with a group of good friends from work.  The food is great and the atmophere is wonderful.  The prices is not too bad actually.  If you are into sports and you want to keep up with whatever event is going on then this is the place to go to.   Staff is friendly, the wait wasn't too long so no complaints.  The deserts are to die for and not to mention their chicken wings.  My friend Pinky ordered them and I tried one, wow!  Better than Wing Stop.  Highly recommend this place, parking is easy too!"
Kay M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,12,3,3.0,9/18/2015,"I come here often out of convenience and its late hours however, the service is just ok when sitting in the dining area. My boyfriend and I prefer to sit at the bar, the service is better your food comes out faster and you've got drinks in front of you to make it all 100 times better. As much as I would love to give this place 5 stars for being that convenient, awesome, I'm obsessed, I can't.  PS DO NOT ORDER THE GOURMET MAC N CHEESE (it was less than half a cup of microwaved hard rotini noodles slopped with bread crumbs and bac) my advice is make your own at home and it will probably  come out way better"
Margarita M.,"San Francisco, CA",26,42,14,1.0,6/12/2014,"Should I even put a star? If there was an option for no-star, that's totally what I would put. Here's the reference number for the receipt: 0612010000452 Feel free to contact me for more details.  I hope you all don't just ignore your customers on social media. First, let me start off by saying I totally understand that today is a busy day. Game 4 Spurs vs Miami, you know everyone is at BJ's trying to catch the game. We ordered food for pickup and our friends went ahead and picked it up for everyone in the house. This is what we ordered: 1. Bison Burger 2. Shrimp Scampi Pasta 3. Cajun Pasta 4. Shrimp Tacos Once there, my friends were told that the order will be ready in less than 10 minutes. An hour later, they were still waiting for the Shrimp Tacos. They left before the game started and came back after half-time (imagine that-- 10 minutes my ass.) Secondly, when the food arrived, we found out that the Scampi Pasta wasn't even there. We got Alfredo Fettucine instead. SERIOUSLY?! It was already an hour long and then you couldn't even get the order right?! Then when we tried to call Mr. William Morthole, the Senior Manager (he provided his card and told us that he will take care of us next time--thanks for the gesture) and he was busy on the phone and couldn't call us back. We called again to get assistance from a different manager and the ""best"" she could do was price adjust the meal.  I'm sorry. That's not the best you could do. I ordered a Shrimp Scampi and got forced to eat a bland fettuccine alfredo. What if I had been a pescatarian, would you have told me that the best you could do was price adjust my meal that I couldn't even eat? Should I even be paying for a meal I did NOT want? NO. This meal should've been given to me for free. And as I just got off work and was ready to eat dinner, I ate it. I sucked it up and ate a meal i did not want.  This is what I think BJ's should've done: 1. Don't tell us that the meal is ready in ten minutes when its not. Say it will be ready in an hour if its going to be ready for an hour. 2. Don't offer your card and contact number if you have no interest on following up. 3. Don't let your customer pay for food they didn't order -- clearly this is a fuck up on your end--this means it should be on the house. Oh, this incident literally happened just about an hour or two ago. Wound is still very fresh."
Donald W.,"San Francisco, CA",115,187,1326,1.0,8/5/2014,"I've got to say that this is by far the worst BJ's that I have ever been to, and I personally used to love this location. This is now the fifth time that my wife and I have come to this particular location in hopes that Service would've become better and within a year and a half span it has only gotten worse. The only reason why I didn't that place a one star is because of two really good employees. First, is the senior manager named Brandi Jordan who's leadership skills showed that she cares about the customers, and although the issues didn't happen on her watch. She made sure to comp our dinner and even invite us back for much better service in the future.  Second was a wonderful waitress named Kelly Liu. She wasn't even our waitress been made sure to constantly check up on us after our poor service and continued to apologize as well as do her best to make us happy. It really meant slot because her section was on the opposite side of ours and yet she still made sure to make a terrible situation decent.  Now back to the review. It first started off badly when it took 30 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge the fact that we were sitting down in a booth waiting to be served. I had to forcibly grab a waitresses attention just to be given our water. As she was delivering them she gave my wife and I terrible attitude and begin to roll her eyes as if we were disturbing her at her. Really, you have an attitude because paying customers wanna be served. Get over yourself lady. I then asked to speak to the manager on duty which was Brandy. She was just as troubled as to why there was such awful service. This is now 45 minutes into being at BJ's and we still have not received one dish yet. It took another 15 minutes to receive our appetizers by then it had been a full hour since we arrived and we just received our appetizers. Unfortunately for us the cheese sticks were barely warm and the spinach & artichoke dip we ordered were completely cold. So cold and that we sent it back after one bit. An hour and a half after we arrived we finally got our main dish and our mixed drinks. I was truly disgusted to find cakes on filth surrounding my drinking glass. So bad it was everywhere as if know one attempted to wash the glass. I had to send my drinks back. But once again Kelly made sure to apologize for the mix up and made sure that our main course was hot and satisfied our needs. She even brought over new drinks for us and would leave until we were happy. She constantly kept a smile on her face and made sure to explain what was going on. I've learned that no matter how many people they hire and how much time goes by the service at this particular location just continues to get worse and worse. Occasionally you'll find a few diamonds in the rough like Kelly, who really take their job seriously and treat their customers with compassion but unfortunately there's not enough of her to turn around this said establishment.  In my opinion if you do go to BJ's only go when it's slow. Otherwise you will be set up for disappointment and considerable letdown. At this point I'm done with this place and refuse to go back, no matter what!!!"
Jeremy E.,"Pacifica, CA",97,11,,1.0,2/24/2016,"Called in order for pick up at lunch,was told be ready in 15 mins. 5 employees standing around,no acknowledgement. Poor customer service,all these chicks were mean mugging. Food still not ready 90mins later.When finally got food SURPRISE...ITS Cold. The entire experience made me lose my appetite. Go to RED ROBIN!!"
Johnny G.,"San Francisco, CA",287,214,38,1.0,4/21/2014,"Everytime I come to BJ's, it's a disappointment. The wait for a table here is outrageous. Honestly, if you want a place to kick it with friends over beer and food, BJ's would be the ideal place right? This place looks great based on their menu but their service is SLOW and the wait here is stupid LONG.  My friend got here at 7PM on a Thursday night to grab a table for 7. Keep in mind that it's Thursday night and the tables weren't even filled.  I arrived at 7:45 PM, 45 minutes after my friend already put his name down for a table. As soon as I arrive, I asked the lady in the front how much longer and she said 15 mins.  So I sit back down and wait patiently. 20 minutes later, I ask her again and she tells me another 15-20 mins. Ok...you said that 20 minutes ago and we already waited a little over an hour. How about you give us an accurate time? 20 minutes later, I ask her AGAIN and she tells me they're ""setting"" up the table. Long story longer, we waited damn near 2 hours for a table here. My friend got here at 7PM and we didn't even get seated til damn near 9PM.  Funny thing is they decide to open up the back tables after WE were seated. They had a bunch of OPEN seats in the back. There are definitely BETTER places to go for dinner/beer with your buddies. THUMBS DOWN for BJ's."
Jean Paul D.,"Daly City, CA",162,1,,5.0,1/14/2016,"Today was a good day. Rome was not built in one day though if your server's name is Leggio you may find yourself in the best seat in the house with classy, friendly service that makes you want to eat as slow as possible. Haha, it was really good service today though. My girlfriend and I had a bogo entree that expires today at 3. We walked in, did not have to wait at all. The hostess carefully walked us down the busy walkway and that's when Leggio noticed my awkward gait and offered to seat us in his section. ""VIP"" he adds. He chose to seat us at a large booth that could have accommodated a small family or a group of friends. We had a lot of space which was great for me because I hadn't taken my medication yet and my legs were hurting. And so we ordered a Dr pepper and a glass of water which were promptly delivered. We then started with calamari and potato skins. For our entrees we chose the unlimited soup and salad and the portabello burger with thin fries. Before the appetizers came out I finished my doctor pepper and Leggio quickly notices and refills ""back with the doctor"". Just what I ordered. The food was amazing. By far, one of the most memorable experiences at bjs. My baby and I can eat here forever. :)  Build dat rome"
Kelly Y.,"San Mateo, CA",73,263,342,4.0,10/14/2012,"Food: I had the honey crisp chicken salad.  It was good.  There were a lot of ingredients.   We had a personal pizza as well.  They were all ""ok"" - because we tried to get lower calorie foods.  There are a ton of things on the menu.  I love it when restaurants show the number of calories.  The calamari is more than 900 calories!!  It's a classic American restaurant - lots of high calorie food, but I'm sure it's awesome!  Next time I'll get some of the higher calorie foods.   Service: They were super busy, even though we went on a weeknight and already 8pm or so.  We had to wait 30 minutes.  Our waitress was fine, no complaints. Ambience: Nice decor, see-through garage doors, lots of wall mirrors for some reason, sports on the numerous TV screens.  Cozy booths."
Komal D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/13/2016,"The food is amazing and filling. Everything is so worth it there. They have the best service. The waiters are so nice and treat you like you're good friends. Shout out to Chan, our waiter. He was so chill and made us want to stay longer. The was the best!"
Lourdes A.,"San Bruno, CA",8,47,2,2.0,6/29/2016,Slow service that is all I can say!!! Waitress does not come to our table to ask if we need anything else or how we are doing. Need to hire more waiter/waitress
Van N.,"San Leandro, CA",0,380,483,3.0,11/4/2014,"Drinks are not strong. Not as strong as if you go to local smaller places. AMF sure was blue [correct] but tasted like juice, so no. Margarita might be a better choice. Ordered nachos in the apetizers. SO small. and they werent nachos. they were fritos. literally. The pizza is great. Shareable. Ton of parking."
Alize R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",108,120,40,4.0,9/7/2014,Food was good. The pazookie is delicious! Tv's everywhere so you don't miss a game. Service was lacking. I think we had 3 different servers. I liked the first one the best.
Olga B.,"San Bruno, CA",315,249,893,5.0,12/27/2012,"Incredibly delicious food here! Came to celebrate our friends present to his bride - two brilliant rings.  Ordered steaks, beer, salads. Spent approximately 80 $ for 3 people.  Steaks were done perfectly, with mushed potatoes, mmm, and German beer :)"
K G.,"Shreveport, LA",0,1,,4.0,8/6/2016,"Mark made our visit perfect!  Between his fun conversation,  great food recommendations,  and directions to local attractions,  this first stop in the San Francisco area was perfect!"
Jenn T.,"San Francisco, CA",85,97,32,1.0,10/8/2014,"Worst service ever.  No one ever came by to take our order, some waitress dropped off TWO glasses of water for our table of 5 and just walked away to help a table that was sat AFTER ours! Didn't say I'll be with you in a minute or anything. Just dropped off 2 glasses of water and walked off. (This was after 10 minute wait already).  We waited another 5 mins another waitress took an order of the table next to ours (which just sat down). We left.  I always have really bad food here (nasty mushy burgers) and just God awful service. Trust me your job is not that hard. Figure it out. Never coming back again. Gave it a few tries. Not worth my time or money"
