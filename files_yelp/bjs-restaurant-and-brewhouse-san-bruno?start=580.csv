Rodney H.,"San Francisco, CA",4966,1198,4064,4.0,12/19/2010,"Ever since TGI Friday's closed down, there hasn't really be a go to sports bar spot where everyone can meet up, so BJ's at Tanforan has been a welcome sight.  I've been here quite a few times since it opened.  I love how they have a massive menu so you can go many different routes depending on your mood.  You can have Pizza, Steak, Salads, Burgers, and even Small Bites. I've had my fair share of food from here: Very first thing I ordered here was their Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizza.  I ordered a Medium, but that sucker was huge!  But if you know me, I usually stay committed to finishing my food and killed it.  It was pretty good, but it won't be for a while if I choose to order it again considering their robust menu. Next time I visited I tried their Jambalaya, with blackened chicken, shrimp, chicken-andouille sausage,bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce all over a bed of rice.  While I remember liking it initially, I totally remember it spiciness kicking my ass!  I have also had their Santa Fe Salad, romaine lettuce, red onions and fire-roasted red peppers tossed with the house Santa Fe dressing and topped with jack and cheddar cheeses, sliced avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crisp tortilla strips and blackened chicken breast.  Definitely not the healthiest of salads, but it was very satisfying! Then I've had Derek's Meatloaf Open Faced Sandwich ( ).  It's another crazy dinner that was really tasty, but will be hard to order again because of the menu as well. And on my most recent visit there, I went a little crazy and ordered their Angus Sliders and Mac & Cheese Small Bite.  It's really hard to not like Sliders, but they were really good and they come in fours instead of the usually two or three ( ).  And then Mac & Cheese ""Small Bite"" was incredible!  Rotelle pasta with three cheeses, chipotle, and garlic topped with breadcrumbs and bacon ( ).  That was so good, that I put some of them into my Sliders and made Mac & Cheese Sliders!!!  OMG, YUM!!!! So call me a fan of BJ's since it's a great spot for gatherings and watching sports and great bar food."
Maybo L.,"San Francisco, CA",331,159,208,3.0,6/9/2014,"I guess I should expect a 45 min wait from a restaurant inside the mall, but at least there's a Barnes and Noble right across where you can look around and check out some new books for a bit until your table is ready. Even ended up finding a book I wanted to read and I usually don't have time to read!  I ordered a medium rare steak and when it came it seemed as if it was more like medium well. I barely saw any red parts. This was probably due to the chef overcooking it since the waiter knew I ordered a medium rare when I told her it was overcooked and tough. My friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was really good but it had a whopping 1790 calories! One sandwich is almost a whole day's meal worth of calories! Crazy! It didn't seem that fattening though!  Service is bad, I got two knives on my steak order with NO forks... I don't think anyone eats steak with their hands. It's not ribs. It was hard to flag down my waiter to ask for a fork, just a bit frustrating when you have waited so long for a table and food and just want to finally eat!  Even though the food is mediocre and service doesn't seem to exist, I always end up coming back for their pizookies! Its just so good!"
Petunia L.,"Pacifica, CA",668,501,319,1.0,3/28/2014,"Super bad experience, ordered a burger & it was horrible, complained to the manager(Tracy) who promised to rectify the situation & nothing... We were promised a new meal etc & we never received anything....we didn't eat our meal and waited anticipating our new meal and after 30 minutes got impatient and left....Horrible!!!!"
Michelle B.,"Daly City, CA",3,36,92,1.0,11/20/2015,"Friendly staff but horrible ticket times. Not even a sorry your shot is taking 20 minutes. Food is great but not worth the wait. Prices are booboo, too. Go to Elephant Bar in Serremonte. More for your money and time."
Christan G.,"Daly City, CA",7,5,1,1.0,8/4/2015,"The food is decent, most of the time. But good takes long. Service is the shittiest I've ever had. It's always packed. And the food is way overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Jack's"
Heather K.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",1474,903,1578,4.0,3/22/2011,"These guys have really stepped up their game recently! I used to dislike coming here for dinner cuz the food was just kind of blah. But my hubby and I came in while waiting for our car to be serviced this weekend and I was really surprised at the new menu. Tons of new dishes have been added AND....they now offer beers other than their own! Yeah, Hoegaarden!!!! I had a seared ahi salad that was delicious. We also had the stuffed mushroom snack....tiny but very tasty. Our server was Miguel, who was very nice and attentive. Bummers: the wait can be very long here and the noise level can reach redonkulous levels. But I'm actually quite looking forward to coming back :D"
Michelle L.,"South San Francisco, CA",32,32,101,4.0,8/19/2013,"Great for a hungry party of three. But hey, it's BJs, so you'll be bound to find a clone someplace else. We came here for lunch at 1pm on a Saturday, and it was still fairly packed. The service wasn't bad either, as our waitress was attentive and quick to refill drinks. TV screens are available in every corner you look. The appetizers were the best part of the meal."
Erika G.,"Livermore, CA",368,754,449,3.0,8/3/2012,"I came in during the week for lunch with co-worker.   Service was eh, she seemed preoccupied, not in a fun joking mood. Just all business.   I ordered a lunch size pasta dish and it was good enough for me to eat it all.  I don't remember the name of it but it had angel hair pasta, sundried tomatoes, garlic and i think feta.  It wasn't stellar because I really can't remember exactly what I ate. My friend also ordered a lunch pasta dish.  Similar to mine. We also shared a mini pazookie.  Regular cookie size but a warm freshly back chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream scoop - that was awesome!!   Prices were reasonable, wait during lunchtime wasn't too bad. Sign up for their customer card - you get points for free stuff."
ramon p.,"San Francisco, CA",1,14,2,4.0,7/26/2016,"We came here Sat evening and as expected the place was packed.  We personally received outstanding service and the place was spotless clean.  Pizza, soup in a sour dough bread were pretty tasty.  My Jambalaya was a bit too spicy for my taste, but not bad.  Salmon was cooked to perfection.  TVs for me were great, not a date night for taking ladies.  Full bar, very convenient for us coming from San Francisco.  Beer and cocktails about normal of what you expect for a big place like this.  I felt this place was low priced.  I love the atmosphere."
Kimberly T.,"Valencia, CA",10,44,71,5.0,9/10/2014,Jalapeno burger is amazing. Chicken post stickers were delicious and the pink lemonate is just the best.
Marcus F.,"Daly City, CA",329,4,18,3.0,11/4/2015,"I usually like the food here but today it was just ok. First of all they took one of my favs off the menu the shrimp scampi. Second, I ordered the deep dish ziti and it looked like a flat bread pizza in a deep dish container. It was tasty but not nearly what I expected or what it looked like on the menu. Lastly and what topped it off, my sister ordered a portobello and asparagus salad, instead of getting portobellos she got white mushrooms and didn't bother telling her!  Luckily we all noticed and they did get the right mushrooms but gave a lame ass excuse for not putting the right mushrooms on in the first place. It wasn't a total loss though. We got $50 off from the rewards points and the baked beignet was pretty good"
Mr.biggalsworth D.,"Daly City, CA",87,12,1,3.0,10/14/2015,"A bjs. Better staff than most. During lunch it can be a hit or miss in terms of speed of service. Recommend only coming for happy hour and for sports games. ALSO! shots are overpriced, mixed drinks aren't so bad. Definitely, you are better off just getting beers $4 dollar happy hour $6 dollars regular price. Their seasonal beers are usually really good so please don't forget to ask, you may miss out on something great."
Regina D.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,10,,2.0,4/19/2014,"I have never been very impressed by this location but my visit last night was the cherry on the top. To start off, our waitress smelled like she had just been chain smoking right before she came to our table. The bathroom smelled like there was some sort of sewer leakage and the garbage was over flowing. Every single stall was dirty/out of toilet paper. I used the only clean stall but I had to go find my own toilet paper to bring in with me.  The bathroom looked like no one had cleaned it at all the entire day.  We ordered the potato skins which were actually very good (and the only reason that I'm giving the restaurant 2 stars) The pazookie was over cooked Overall it was not a pleasant experience and from now on I'll just be going to the BJ's at Bridgepoint"
Angelique B.,"San Bernardino, CA",38,107,50,5.0,10/13/2014,Wonderful food and great drinks.  Joshua was very poliTe and very attentive.Great lunch items to choose from.    Would highly recommend and will be looking forward to coming back.
Isaac H.,"San Francisco, CA",45,523,459,4.0,10/12/2014,This is a good restaurant to go to at the Shops at Tanfroan mall. I came here with my mom and her girlfriend. I ordered the lemon chicken. When it camp to my table. They for got the bell peppers and the red onions. I had to tell my waiter that they forgot. She went back to the kitchen and go the red pins and the bell peppers. For dessert ordered the brownie and chocolate ice cream. It did not come to my table the first time. So my waiter had to go back to the kitchen and get my dessert. I loved the BJ's root beer. I would come back here when I am in the area.
Maurie M.,"San Francisco, CA",126,40,,2.0,4/14/2015,"My best friend and I came in to have dinner. Our server was a friendly young woman. She took our order we both order 2 types of wings, salad and fries. Our wings arrive and we both took a bite only to eat ice cold meat . I told the young lady about our food she took it back but my mood did change . when our wings arrived it just felt like they warmed it in the.microwave. I wasn't going to say anything again just ate  a little more then asked for a Togo box. Dessert was delicious. I have had better food I don't think I will be back again. The 2 stars are for the young woman who served us."
carmela s.,"San Francisco, CA",5,41,16,1.0,7/12/2015,"The wait list here is a joke! We called ahead and were told we would be the first to be seated upon arrive. 30 min later and 50 people later we were still waiting! You need a new manager who knows how to run a restaurant. You should also invest in training your staff, especially the front staff."
Crystal C.,"San Francisco, CA",584,453,87,2.0,4/4/2014,"I have such mixed feelings for BJ's that I had to give it only two stars. While they do offer a nice location (right at the end of the mall) and plenty of booths, TVs, indoor/outdoor seating, I just never get a good vibe or hot food when I dine there. The servers are always nice, but regularly switch shifts in the middle of our meal. I don't need to get to know you, or your co-worker, this isn't fine dining. But ok, they are friendly, espcially when I've gone in with my BFF and her baby, everyone dotes on her, offers baby-appropriate snacks, etc. but the hosts/hotesses could use an attitidue adjustment. Um, I'm sorry, am I inconveniencing you by asking to be seated while you're working? Is that not your job? Have you ever heard of smiling/greeting customers? We have ordered the Flatbread Pizzas, but they have never really been hot and the flavors are  just kind of... bleh. I had the clam chowder followed by a Pazzuci (sp?) that I shared with two friends which gave me an awful feeling and caused me to be sick when I got home. I have also tried the Halibut fish tacos and they were bland. I think it really depends on what you order. When BFF got the baby a chicken tenders with fries meal, baby mushed up the fries, we ate the tenders which were really hot and yummy, but that's such a basic item that anyone could get right.  I will say that I like their Cider/Heff beer cocktail. Overall, there are plenty of other places to eat, like the food court or 5 Guys which appeal to me much more."
Lawrence S.,"San Francisco, CA",59,16,2,5.0,1/24/2016,"Rochelle is fabulous  Daniela is equally amazing Thanks for your help!  Word of advice to management, keep them around."
Alexis I.,"Inner Sunset, San Francisco, CA",174,11,2,2.0,10/26/2015,Dirty plates. Dirty utensils. Dirty table. Smh. Had to ask 4 different workers for new plates and utensils. Asked 3 different workers to wipe down our table. The food was okay though.
