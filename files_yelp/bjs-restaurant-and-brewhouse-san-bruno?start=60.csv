Allyssa V.,"San Mateo, CA",464,2,4,2.0,6/18/2017,"Let me start off that my family and I aren't even done eating here. Just finished our apps after 15-20 mins of ordering. Still waiting for the main entrees.  It's fathers day and i understand that wait will be long however, Our server is this old man who took 10-15 to greet us, came and said he'll be back. 7 mins later, where's he at? Had to ask the front for our server. Food abnormally taking forever. Ive eaten here plenty of times and wait time between apps and entrees are never this long, esp on a holiday. Currently, looking around and the other tables have the same issue as us, looking around for our food and server... just checked the time, and its been an hour and we dont have our main entrees out yet..."
Ti S.,"San Francisco, CA",106,140,137,1.0,2/25/2017,"Friday 2/24/17 around 11pm. Wow, where to begin?  Co-hostess/usher makes comment in front me (paying customer, mind you) that she has to bring another party to their table. Yup! No professionalism or customer service here.  Chili came out luke warm. Just from the looks of the spinach and artichoke dip (warm), I already knew it would disappoint. The dip had an extremely liquidy consistency. I can only describe the dish to look like light green milk with bits and pieces of spinach and artichoke. Is there a spinach shortage that I'm unaware of? First thought in my head was there must be lack of staffing in the kitchen.  I had the full rack of ribs (actually hot) with fries and chili. The ribs were the most edible item I had there all night. Fries were doused with salt (extremely over seasoned). The bf had the ribeye steak with Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. After trying a piece of the Brussel sprout, I dare not try the rest. It was probably frozen, reheated, frozen again, and reheated until overcooked.  Granted our beverages came out way later (no refills on waters or soda), our utensils came out way later, and our condiments came out way later, we were shocked we actually even got the items.  All and all, one of the most terrible dining experience yet. Never expected this from a known establishment. First time here after a few years and this experience just reminds me of why I shall never return."
Karen C.,Hong Kong,35,1,,1.0,12/1/2017,"It's a poor service restaurant. I ordered online delivery and they delivered an hour late, food is cold and taste very wrong. And I found they charged me twice and took forever to take my money back."
Blyss L.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",0,18,19,3.0,6/29/2017,"Hit and miss. It can be really great and consistent and then you'll hit a few waiters or nights in the kitchen where you're like what the heck is this (which I know happens, and that's fine) but on two occasions now the waiter/waitress have done less than impress me to make it right.  1) broccoli and cheddar bread bowl. Instead of coming out to tell me there isn't enough soup I waited until my bfs burger was delivered and beyond with repeated check ins with my waiter. When my crusty half full bowl of soup arrived it arrived without the bread bowl. When I inquired about this I was then brought out a bread bowl on the side...even though my crusty cup of soup was cold and basically done. I was still charged though...I let it slide.  2)tonight, I came in to Mary dianna as my server. I'm writing this complaint with a compliment oriented goal because she knocked my socks off right off the bat. She delivered perfect service from polite greetings, suggestions, service of refills, attitude and personality anddd listening!!!!  I asked for the brussel sprout appetizer with extra sauce but not on the side ideally because it's cold and would taste so much better hot. Her and the cooks delivered! Omg! Soooo yummy 10 stars.  And perhaps Mary Diana and the cooks set the standards too high but when she had to go on lunch break and I attempted to tell it to my new server the results were less than satisfactory.  1- it came out without the extra sauce..honestly less sauce than normal (I come here way too much for this dish) and huge half cuts of dry sprouts that they would normally cut again.  2-after requesting for extra sauce and explaining that I don't like the cold sauce it comes out with the cold sauce on top.  3-after again explaining my poor dish goes in again 1 more time and returns drowned in oil and less sauce than I had to friggen start with.  4-with the look and expression of disappointment to my server about my oily sprouts in the end nothing was done to fix it. I wasn't even asked if I wanted a box for my oily sprouts to take home.  (Server number 8) It doesn't take much to make things right but for $7 I'll think twice about coming here again for the 2nd time in a week with my boyfriend because I don't want bad service.  I missed you Mary Diana after you left. You're a rock star and I hope to see you in the future if we decide to return."
Bono B.,"San Francisco, CA",6,116,5,4.0,7/24/2017,"Terrific service headed up by Efrom and the other attentive waitstaff along with decent food from the kitchen made an impromptu Sunday night out very enjoyable. I'd say the food is a solid 3.5 based on what we ate, and the great service adds another 0.5 star to the entire dining experience. I normally don't go to chain restaurants (nor give 4 star reviews frequently), but given our situation and choice, it turned out to be a great option. The Brewhouse Blonde Asparagus was nicely fried, with a nice, light crispy batter and a dusting of parmesan cheese on top. The creamy, garlicky and slightly tart aioli that came with the dish was a great foil to the appetizer. As with the fries, the frying on the asparagus was executed well, with no greasiness. The seasonal salad offering of watermelon, pickled red onions, crisp spring salad mix, and feta cheese crumbled on top was a nice, refreshing summer salad. The vinaigrette dressing was nice and tart, and worked well with the sweet flesh of the diced watermelon. The picked onions may have been a tad too salty, tart, and portioned too generously relative to the greens, but all in all, pretty good salad that I'd like to try replicating at home. BJ's Brewhouse Burger was surprisingly tasty. Maybe not as good as my fave burger from NOPA, but the patty was flavorful, the lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles were fresh and were a good match-up for the burger, and the parmesan crusted bun gave the burger a nice, buttery richness. Not exactly like a brioche bun, but in the similar ball-park texture wise. I didn't need to add ketchup or mustard to the burger - it was seasoned very nicely as-is. I would say it's up there with Super Duper and In-and-Out in terms of quality. And I mean this as a compliment without any irony. Those places make a terrific burger, and BJ's burger can go toe-to-toe with them. The accompanying fries were nice and crispy, just as they should be. The Shrimp & Asparagus Penne was the least favorite dish of the evening. I'd have to say the kitchen kind of killed the pasta - it was over al dente, nearly mushy in texture. I wasn't too thrilled with the marinara either. It was much sweeter than I'd prefer - it was almost like they'd put in too much tomato paste in the marinara. They may have been better off just making a simple tomato sauce with olive oil, thinly sliced garlic, black pepper, and sea salt, and sauteeing the shrimp and asparagus very quickly in the end in the sauce. In general, I think the simpler dishes fared well whereas the pasta dish that required more components didn't do so well. Perhaps something to think about as you navigate their menu and order your meal."
Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",34,114,653,4.0,1/26/2017,"BJs Restaurant in San Bruno is my favorite place to go for happy hour! Their cocktails are the best especially the strawberry margaritas and classic mojitos! Their calamari and stuffed mushrooms are so good. This time around, my bff and I had strawberry margaritas. We left BJs happy like always . Cheers!"
Jim B.,"Reno, NV",0,37,2,4.0,10/20/2017,"When u step into the ""wonderland"" of Bj's, you will be greeted by ""Mo"" who take you into the land of Oz!  Next to the bar (while waiting) you may meet Joshua (Cal Wilmer double). Almost everything you may try will be delicious!!"
Heidy S.,"San Francisco, CA",58,4,14,1.0,9/12/2017,"I waited for 30 minutes, and they let people in first  who just waited for 5 minute. DO NOT TRUST THE text message system, they will just leave you behind and wait."
Brian L.,"Houston, TX",452,88,98,1.0,7/1/2016,"Literally one of the worst BJ's I've been to. The wait staff is really friendly and accommodating but the food was horrible.  It was actually one of the best wait staff I've had from a BJ's, super friendly and understanding.  Beers were fine, and the appetizer was pretty good (got the Brussel sprouts). The main dish my girlfriend got was the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was atrocious. Breading was falling off, soggy, no seasoning. And they gave us two sides of broccoli instead of the listed broccoli and mashed potatoes. Manager took it off our bill but girlfriend left hungry. Won't be back."
Raffy M.,"Daly City, CA",0,4,1,1.0,11/25/2017,"i used to love this restaurant for their fast service and friendly crew but i guess it's going downhill lately... the waiters looks mad and unhappy doing their jobs on waiting tables, plus it takes time for the food to come, I literally starved to death before the food came""... Asking for a small thing like extra plates takes decades to come and you have to keep repeating yourself to the crew.  hopefully the manager would gather up his team  and have some performances evaluation"
Alicia H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/27/2017,"THIS IS HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!!!!!  Wanted to come here for an 18th birthday celebration&  We got seated after a whole hour, the waiters and servers did not attend us at all.  We constantly had to ask multiple different waiters for the same items, like for more water in our glasses, and napkins.  Our food took too long, far too long. By the time my pizza came to me, it was half cold.  I can't even count how many waiters I've asked to bring me water. WATER. We literally waited 25 minutes to have them refill our sodas for WATER.  We wanted to pay for our meal, and asked for the check, we got the ""we'll let your server know"" response, and I would watch my server not come to our table, it was as if they didn't want us to pay. I asked her so many times if we can have the check and she had us waiting for 30 minutes. At this point, my friend was literally sleeping on the table. We ended up paying up front just cause we had no one help us. For the whole 2 hours there, no one else up. Only when they took our orders and brought us water ONCE.  this is such a bad place,  DO NOT COME HERE."
Lynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",214,511,2093,2.0,6/29/2016,"I hardly come to bjs unless im having a pasta craving. I havent gone for awhile and found they discontinued the cajun shrimp pasta. It inclined me to get the chicken fettucine with brocccoli. The pasta was lukewarm. I was so hungry, i let it pass. The pasta wasnt cooked to al dente. It was still hard. There was 4 bits of chicken in it. Dont get me wrong, it was a hefty plate of 2$ worth of pasta. But i expect a chicken breast in a 16$ plate. My bf ordered the ribs with wedges on the side. The ribs were dry and the bbq sauce was subpar. The best thing about dinner was the wedges. They at least made that right, crispy outside, soft inside. He also had clam chowder as well. We expected a small cup of it and were pleased to find it was a large bowl. It was on the salty side but was okay. Didnt come with crackers :( Overall, i have come to the conclusion that bjs is a brewery and specialize in that. The rest is just there. I wouldnt order food unless it was their pizookis or pizza because they specialize in that too and i have had them before just not at this location. If they are going to serve expensive food, they need to make sure every dish they send out is hot and cooked well, not dry, not raw. I dont think ill return for their food. And i dont like beer, so not even for that."
Amanda C.,"Berkeley, CA",297,12,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Horrible service, very slow. Waiters need to stop catering so much of their time to  big families when there are other couples who need their order taken.  If you're gonna have such a big restaurant, please make sure you have enough wait staff to accommodate."
Amanda L.,"San Mateo, CA",83,224,145,1.0,6/9/2016,"WOW. You guys blew it tonight.  I understand there was a Warriors game on and the restaurant was more busy on a weeknight than it would have been had it not been for the game. But really? A friend and I came by to have dinner before watching a movie. We received our menus and were thus forgotten about. We waited for thirty minutes, we asked for help to a couple of servers passing by and they said they'd grab our waiter for us. Never happened since no one came to us. Mind you, WE DID NOT EVEN GET WATER. And when we decided to leave, we went to the front and told a server who was STANDING with the hosts doing nothing, that we were leaving because no one served us.  Is it because it was just a table for two? They decided to overlook and ignore us for the bigger tables where they'd get more business and thus bigger tips? Unacceptable."
Brian C.,"Reno, NV",291,182,262,1.0,12/6/2016,"Wow...I love BJ's...but I don't like this one at all...this location was filthy, filthy, filthy...the bathroom had only 1 working stall...piss and shit was smeared all over the walls...the service was horrible...the service was horrible...did I forget to mention the service was horrible...I was afraid to eat the food by the condition of the environment...it was a last ditch effort for something to eat and I chose wrong... Negative -5 stars if possible..."
Tiffany B.,"South San Francisco, CA",76,4,1,5.0,10/5/2017,"Wait was not that long. Shoutout to ANTHONY for the great experience! Very accommodating! Thank you for the food suggestions! Food was excellent  every time i go to BJ's I get a 3 star service but today's dinner was totally exceptional because of Anthony. I recommend getting the avocado rolls, peanut butter pizookie (BOMB). He recommended us the double bone in pork chop. Hella juicy and fully cooked. The peruvian quinoa with shrimp was very tasty. My only concern was the wings were served a little bit cold and the strawberry lemonade was too sweet. 9 stars for tonight's dinner!!"
Llewelyn L.,"San Bruno, CA",3,19,41,5.0,10/1/2017,"Five stars to the service that we received dining here. Ed is the epitome of great service. He was attentive, anticipated what we needed (i.e. provided lemonade refill ahead of time. Noticed we were going through the Spinach Artichoke chips fairly quick, so informed the kitchen ahead of time to give us chip refills) and he's so nice!"
Steve N.,"San Jose, CA",150,1,,5.0,11/26/2017,"This is a really good restaurant, I've been to a lot of the BJ's but I especially like this one. The service is exceptionally good at this location. Shout out to our server Angelina who was super knowledgeable, I hate when I go to a restaurant and the server knows nothing about the menu. Also she was super friendly so if you go there ask for her. The Food was good and service was prompt. I would definitely recommend this place.."
Jaycee G.,"Daly City, CA",0,7,4,5.0,12/3/2017,"The best foods and friendly staff, I kept coming back in this place so much fun , the place to be"
Natalie R.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",0,1,2,1.0,11/14/2017,If I could put 0 stars I would worst experience ever I will never ever return to this bjs location service was awful and to top it off I don't know what they served us and brought out wrong meals. I asked one of the waiters what he brought me and he couldn't even explain what it was! They offered us a free pazooki and brought out this?
