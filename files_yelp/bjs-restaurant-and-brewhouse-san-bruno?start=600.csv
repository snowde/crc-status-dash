Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",231,47,53,5.0,5/18/2015,"A huge THANKS to our server Steven C.!!! 8pm 5/18/15 ^_^!!! We really appreciated the great service and such politeness! ""My pleasure"" he always said and with a smile. Great attitude! The food! Oh gosh! It was delicious! I has a chicken Cesar salad, my husband had a Jambalaya and my mother-in-law had the ribs! Delicious! After that we had Beignet with chocolate chip ice cream as a replacement for the vanilla ice cream(they ran out) but it was just perfect! I would say it's better ^_^! We also had 2 tequila sunrises and an adios! Strong ^_~! Thank you! Great way to start the week ^_^!"
Alex L.,"San Francisco, CA",517,105,12,1.0,2/22/2016,"BJ's typically is your average 3 star restaurant... on a good day. Came here with my dad for breakfast, what a mistake that was. It started from the point of ordering. I ordered the California scramble, and my dad ordered another breakfast entree. The kicker is when they asked him how he wanted his eggs done. He replied poached. First, off the waitress did not know what poached eggs were, then she said they didn't do that here and it is not on the menu. Fun fact, none of the style of eggs are on the menu, I didn't see, ""choose your style of eggs, sunnyside, scrambled, over easy."" Anyway, they ""accommodated"" us, which lead to the manager coming over saying how they had to ""accommodate"" us since poached eggs is not a typical option and for us to not expect it in the future. I had no idea that poached eggs were so difficult. Following the egg debacle, the service continued downhill where they didn't refill our drinks when we asked them to. Furthermore, we had asked for a pizza to be prepared to take away at the end of our meal, that was forgotten, extending our horrendous dining by another 20 minutes while they made it. The list goes on and on. They deserve negative 1 star for this experience and management needs to get a handle on their employees."
Jessica C.,"San Francisco, CA",22,108,12,5.0,9/17/2014,"I do not know where else I can get good food and delicious drinks near my house! When my friends and I come we usually get some apps (i've tried potatoe skins, avocado roll things, calamari and mozarella sticks and they were all good). My favorite thing to get though is the great white pizza. Ohh that garlicy goodness.... As for drinks though I've only actually enjoyed the strawberry splash, strawberry patch and strawberry mojitos (if you cannot tell by now I really like strawberries). In my opinion there is not a strong alcohol taste which is perfect for me.  Sometimes the wait can be a bit lengthy. I came here on friday around 7 and the wait was about a little over an hour. Not bad though."
Kao S.,"San Mateo, CA",485,259,1305,3.0,1/29/2013,I like this place.  I used to come here after work for HH.  Great beer and snacks but the parking kinda sucks..  Otherwise great place to mingle and have dinner.
Tajanee D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,9,1.0,11/16/2015,"Came to BJS last night for dinner with my baby and friend. I will first begin by staying I have been to BJS on multiple occasions. But this experience was by far the worse. I always get the same thing: Shrimp and Fettuccine Alfredo, but this time it was different.  The Alfredo sauce was not creamy at all, it was very very watery. Usually that have a while grilled chicken breast slices on the side but this time it was chicken chunks in it that tasted like something out of a frozen TV dinner. I had to wait 15 minute for a waiter to even come say Welcome to BJS would you like a drink ? Then an additional 10 minutes for some type of silverware.  Every Time the waiter came he left before I could finish what I was saying, sometimes in the middle of it.  We waited forever for a salad, forever for our dinner, for ever for water, forever for him to get dirty dishes. The service was horrible. I have them 1 star because the garlic knots, my friends steak dinner & our desserts were delicious (minus the they were too heavy with the salt on the Salted Caramel Pizzooke. It was super crowded as always but since we called ahead we were seated promptly but that wouldn't matter based on how slow the service was. DIM after he gave us our bills he apologized for the service because he was working two sections? Too late for that buddy. I'll probably come back if I'm desperate but no more pasta ... AT ALL."
Casey T.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/13/2016,"waited for a solid 10 minutes before they even acknowledged us, very dismissive service and I am not impressed. all I wanted was my Oreo pazookie and I am leaving very sad"
Erica T.,"San Francisco, CA",428,318,639,3.0,5/8/2012,"Like all of the other reviewers, every time I come here, there is always a 30+ min wait. A table of 4, we decided to find a seat at the bar area, wait time = less than 10 mins (if you get lucky and snag a table before everyone else does).  Crispy Jalapeno Burger - Fried jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomato, lettuce and chopped cilantro. (med rare with wedge fries) $9.95: Cooked perfectly. This burger was pretty awesome. So much meat and so much toppings and the chipotle mayo (but next time I will ask for it on the side because there was a bit too much mayo). Fries were also awesome. Thick cut wedge fries... MMmmmmm. This burger was so big that I wasn't able to finish it. I gave my bf the other half and still was stuffed after. I soo recommend this! New Orleans Jambalaya $15.50: This was also really good, a lot of peppers (so if you don't like peppers, don't order this dish). The shrimp is also big enough to notice and taste. Downside to this dish is that they didn't cut the sausage up completely, so you get one whole sausage slices connected by the outer skin... no bueno. But dish was full of flavor. Service is really slow, we didn't get our drinks tell really late and didn't get our check for the longest time. We started to get anxious because we had a movie to get to."
Howard K.,"Redwood City, CA",59,15,6,2.0,6/12/2016,The watery Queso Dip showed up cold twice (even after sending it back) - so gross. Bathrooms covered in urine. They did let me order the Chili Burger off menu - they was cool. The kitchen simply could not execute.
tere p.,"Daly City, CA",28,22,35,1.0,6/11/2016,"As of 330pm today. We went to bar area lounge, server serve as water then took our order. Wings, grilled cheese, chicken tacos, avocado rolls. After that, he turn to other table to take order. Time passed like 10 min or less. The order infront of us arrived and our server went to the restroom. Time passed by like 12  to 15min and i asked help from a busser/server to assist following up with the food. And the busser said yes. But he went instead to the bar and took the drinks to serve in other tables. One woman server I asked help again. She mentioned table 802 when i pointed where we were seated. And our server  I saw coming out from the restroom. I asked him for follow up on the food because my 19 month old  baby is hungry. And he said he is also waiting fot the food and turn his back right away. HE SAID THAT WITHOUT EVEN GOING TO THE KITCHEN AREA AND CHECKING OUT. HE SAID THAT THEN and went to THE TABLE infront of us to TAKE ORDER!!. Pissed us off right away. We walked out and talked to the mgr on duty and the mgr is offering us food and I said no more. So here is your YELP REVIEW. No wonder it's 2 stars only."
Sharon L.,"San Francisco, CA",213,88,158,4.0,1/8/2013,"Went last night: Avocado eggrolls: DELISH! should have tried this sooner!  Mac and cheese appetizer: Good dish for someone not too hungry Salmon creation: (broiled) oh my gosh. the salmon was fresh and tasty. the top broiled was crunchy ans not too burnt. so good with the sauce. the rice... could eat it for days!!!! has a fair amount of veggies that balance out the dish perfectly. PLUS, had a bowl of soup in the beginning (clam chowder! :) ) Almond raspberry pizookie: not my fav :\ it was alright but wouldn't get again. had alot of almonds. im not a nut person (the BF is)"
Scarlet R.,"Daly City, CA",52,24,6,2.0,10/13/2014,"Just finished having a late dinner with my boyfriend for happy hour. Everything was fine except the fact that the food runner was pretty disrespectful. We ordered three appetizers and he approached our table rudely asking with two more plates, ""you ordered more food?!"" He said it in a surprising tone, and that was the only thing he said to us. We were just missing our mini pizza dish, but what if we did order more food? That's not the way to approach a table. He didn't even say hi. On top of that when we were leaving, the same food runner hogged up the whole aisle as we were passing by each other and didn't even give me room or said excuse me.  I don't usually yelp bad reviews, but I was really unhappy with the way he handled things. Hopefully nobody else has to experience it, but other than that everything was just alright. Our server was nice and sweet, but the pizza came out pretty cold. There will be better days!"
Darrell N.,"Ingleside, San Francisco, CA",415,33,7,4.0,4/30/2014,"Lots of good items on the menu!  Lots of TVs if you ever want to go to watch the game. (Very little seating at the bar though) I recently came here to order takeout. The waitress was nice enough to stop assisting her tables and took my order, while she was at the register. Took about 20 minutes to get my food though...you need to make sure to tell them your name at the desk and remind them because they forgot to call out my name when the food came. I waited an extra 10 minutes when the food was there the whole time...I guess everybody was busy because the restaurant was packed that night due to the NBA playoffs. Overall, BJs would def be an option for me whenever I am craving pasta! I ordered the Grilled chicken pasta and it was just perfect!"
Colleen M.,"San Francisco, CA",653,518,359,2.0,4/23/2010,"There's something wrong with a restaurant when the workers can't explain what the name ""BJ's"" stands for... Just kidding, I'm sure it's just a name. They gave me the weirdest look when I asked, though. You would think that they get it a lot! The food was so sub-par that I don't quite remember anything about what I had ordered or eaten. Some kind of deep-dish pizza, I think. The service was slow, and the food came out lukewarm. Ah, THAT was what happened. If not for the pazookie - which I found AMAZING; former pazookie virgin here! - I wouldn't even bother giving this place two stars. I might even choose to head over to Chuck E Cheese instead. Their name makes complete sense, they have a skateboarding rat as a mascot, AND their pizza is made both hot and quickly. Winner!"
Melissa C.,"Pacifica, CA",56,11,4,1.0,9/20/2014,"The last time I came here I had the worst experience of waiting over 30 minutes to order, over an hour for two drinks and one appetizer, and another 30 minutes for my check. I only came back because after the horrid experience and complaining to the manager, they comped our $20 bill. For a Friday night, it was not busy at all, yet it still took more than 15 minutes to be acknowledged in the bar area and only AFTER our friend went up to a server to ask for menus/service because another table who came after us (that wasn't even fully seated yet) was being helped first. From our previous experience, we wanted to order our drinks ASAP for we feared we wouldn't get to order at all, we got the drinks in an orderly time, but had to wait to order any food. About three wrong orders of Hennessy&Apple Juice, a pizookie, and waters(with four full waters sitting on our table), our server saying they're still ""cooking"" our chips, her handing us plates for chips, and no extra napkins and 35 minutes later, we receive our correct order of CHIPS AND FRICKEN DIP. Literally, the only reason why this place gets a star at all is for one, yelp doesn't allow less that one star and two, the dip was kinda good.  Service can really make or break an experience and its terrible that I've had nothing but horrible service in this establishment."
Love Food And Wine W.,"San Mateo, CA",8,61,18,1.0,4/25/2015,"Very slow service here like the one in San Mateo. Thought maybe the San Bruno location would attend customers faster and boy was I wrong! Waitress took too long to take our order and we waited a long time to get our order. The mini pizza lunch was okay not good or delicious like I expected. Honestly, the Pizza Hut personal pizza from Target does taste better. Umm, you're a sit down restaurant and should serve a delicious gourmet pizza. What happened BJ's with your  food quality, taste and temperature of food? It is definitely off on all levels including service and dirty utensils. Definitely this restaurant is in need of major improvement in all departments!"
Erika C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",144,32,5,2.0,5/25/2016,"So lets start out by saying we informed the waiter we were on a time restraint. Our waiter was this young guy by the name of Michael B. So I wanted to get relaxed as I was catching a redeye flight to Miami. First off there were three of us that had ordered alcoholic drinks. Michael felt the need to have me go back out to the car to get my I.D,;however he didn't card my sister or my other buddy. Michael literally didn't put my drink until I returned with my I.D. Okay, maybe he really thought I wasn't 21!!! Hmmmmmm So we put our order in 20 minutes had passed and the waiter had yet to give us utensils or go and check on our order. The manager was soooooo compensating for this young punk's arrogance ass attitude. My sister had waved to get our waiter's attention and he sent another staff to help us out. As a matter of fact all the other staff was very helpful accept our own waiter. So now I'm growing impatient and I ask the waiter if he could see how long b4 our food was ready. He stated that he hadnt had a chance to check on the food. MICHAEL B had checked on every customer 2-3 more than he had on us. The manager again stepped in and apologized and had comped some items due to dumb dumbs lack of customer service. I had asked the manager if she could get our bill because we needed to leave. The manager complied and got the bill for us. As we sat there our waiter again, continues to ignore us as if we weren't sitting there..I go up front to pay the bill and the young lady tells me only my waiter can close out my bill. The staff goes to relay the message as she sees that I'm frustrated and growing impatient. Michael B comes to close out the bill and literally starts walking slow, talking to his co-workers and just taking his sweet time to swipe my card. I had to just be silent; otherwise I would've grabbed him by that punkass ponytail and went Bam Bam on him!!!! I am very gracious and good about compensating and giving waiters tips,but this imbecile deserved absolutely nothing but a punch in tha face!!! If I should ever go back to that BJ's I will refuse service if he has to wait on me. It is very sad to have an asshole like that while all the others are working diligently to satisfy the customers! His parents must own the establishment because I do NOT understand why he is still employed there!! MICHAEL B, YOU are exactly the first letter or your last name!!! I'm so glad that I have grown to become a bigger and better person and for that I Cant not DEAL WITH YOU!!!!"
Dean N.,"San Francisco, CA",39,108,95,2.0,6/5/2016,"Walking in I was struck by the lack of character. I was not expecting much, however I had a recommendation and their previous recommendation was not horrible. Then I got my hopes up remembering a great microbrewery in Boston and a couple in NYC. I didn't have any beer there, so maybe if I had then my experience would have been different.  However their home-brewed soft drinks were undrinkable. I would list those drinks on my ""the worst thing I ever ate"" list, so even if I tried their beer I doubt any changes. appetizer was potato skins, which I almost stopped ordering because they are horrible so many places, these came out looking good, but no sour cream and fake bacon. Glad I was hungry.  For entree I had a steak, potato and asparagus. Steak was cooked almost correctly, at least rare and two bites were amazing. If they had talent or skill amazing things could have happened in their kitchen. Baked potato was blah. Asparagus tasted liked they scraped their shrimp sauce off before serving, even served cold. Finally, for a tie breaker I had dessert, and since national donut day was last week I decides to try their beignet. I mean... how can they mess those up. Well they far exceeded their incompetence. The gelato was one of my favorite brands, but hidden under their canned whipped cream and strawberries that were sour, and had a weird oily covering I guess to supply the flavor that was lacking. Two stars for the attempt to cook a steak. At least they achieved a correct internal temperature and two flavorful bites."
C K.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,3,2,1.0,6/19/2016,"Horrible, service and food. Unfortunately I took my boyfriend here for brunch on father's day only because he didn't want to wait 45 to an hour for all the GOOD food places we stopped at. Like Jacks across the street. We came to bj's and sat in the bar area. We waited 10 mins before someone came to clean the table we wanted to sit at and another 20 before someone took our order. Mind you I had to stop someone in the area and ask who's the waiter or waitress. After no one acknowledged our presence. That guy ended up taking our order. They were no where near busy. We ordered from the brunch menu. Bj's should not have brunch as a part of their menu! Eggs were rubbery and the cheese I asked to be scrambled into the eggs was almost nonexistent  ""Apple wood smoked bacon"" was thin like paper and French toast was blah. Coffee was watery. I'm not a huge fan of Bj's already this just confirmed why."
Matt Y.,"Lahaina, HI",198,383,2248,3.0,12/24/2012,"12/23/12 Lunch Your regular fancy-diner-in-the-mall type of place. We came here to take a break from shopping and took refuge from the crazy blustery day. This restaurant is huge with so many booths. It somehow reminds me of Elephant Bar. For a brewery house they have good cocktails. The ""Guilt-free Cosmo"" (with Ketel One, Monin sugar-free triple sec, cranberry juice and fresh lime) is good without that horrible after taste from sugar substitute.  Food is okay: *BJ Favorite pizza - thin-crusted, loaded with bell peppers, lives, and bits of sausage. It's tasty but not as good as California Pizza Kitchen.  *""Enlightened"" Thai mango Salad - just what I expected, with mixed greens, arugula, slices of mango, avocado. Would be perfect if they put less dressing since the salad is all soggy at the bottom. Service was prompt and friendly."
Rena H.,"San Francisco, CA",22,44,24,4.0,6/19/2013,"never had an entire meal of food here, but it is a pretty great place for a dessert and booze with the girls.  I have come here for pizookies and cocktails on several occassions and have always been treated very well, even though I'm not ordering a whole lot.   pizookie...."
