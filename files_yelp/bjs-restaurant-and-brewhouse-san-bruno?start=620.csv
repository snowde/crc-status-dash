William A.,"Juneau, AK",49,33,6,2.0,10/21/2015,"The service was slow and very generic. It took 15 minutes to get water served after we sat down. The wait staff who served us were pretty mechanical and not very engaging. This is the 2nd time I've tried their beer and it was flat and warm again. The atmosphere is decent but I can't say the experience either time was enjoyable. I'll be steering clear of this brand from here on out,"
Dave F.,"Santa Monica, CA",301,1475,174,5.0,8/4/2012,"This BJ's has a 5 star staff!!!!! I was enjoying a casual meal here, but was in a bit of a hurry to go home to Santa Monica. I paid the bill and bolted to SFO rental car return. On my way to the terminal, I realized I left a really expensive pair of sun glasses on the table. No worries, because I had the receipt with the kind server's name. After calling the restaurant and speaking to the manager, they actually returned my sunglasses all boxed up in a nice USPS cardboard box!!!!  Wow, great service. What more can I say? Thank you, BJ's--San Bruno! You guys rock!"
Gage S.,"San Francisco, CA",6,32,21,4.0,10/16/2014,"Food is always fantastic and seems like a clean place.  I like the deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. Their pastas and burgers are great as well. But the BACON AOLIE CORN FRITTERS are like $3 and they are the best appetizer ive ever had. Stuffed mushrooms are great too.  So now the service is spotty and ranges from amazing (like when Jennifer B worked there) to not soo good from others. And the wait kind of sucks because its usually busy especially the weekends. But the atmosphere and food are worth it as long as you get seated.  And please please please if anyone knows where Jennifer B works now it would be greatly appreciated,  please message me or give me her number, she told me but i forgot where she was going,  my gf and i loved her service."
Judith L.,"San Francisco, CA",306,140,311,3.0,12/6/2012,"BJ's is always a good place to go for a quick bite if you don't know what you're craving for. It has a wide variety to choose from and there's bound to be something that will catch your eye..or should I say your stomach?   If you're looking for something small, I'd say try the gourmet Mac n cheese.  ""What makes it so gourmet?"" ""I don't know...the bacon? The bread on the side? The bread crumbs sprinkled on the top?"" I don't know if that makes this Mac n cheese gourmet or not but it definitely makes a good snack. It's pretty cheesy and best eaten when it's hot, so remember not to leave it for last.  I've also had the ahi-tuna salad before. It was after the gym so I had to have something light or else...man, all that effort wasted. It was definitely a good choice. It was filling yet light. The tuna complimented the salad well.  The chicken quesadillas were so-so. It's a cheap meal for lunch, but not satisfying. D had the Chicken Marsala once and he said the noodles were a bit hard. But definitely get the pizookie if you want dessert!! I get the red velvet one every time. Super delicious but not something you can finish by yourself (unless you have a super big sweet tooth). Long story short: The food can be a hit-or-miss but BJ's is just one of those places where you don't pay for amazing food or expect too much. The service is definitely forgettable though. Sometimes you have to ask five times just for a glass or water. Just don't have too high of an expectation and you'll be satisfied enough."
Chanel E.,"Palo Alto, CA",51,20,3,2.0,10/12/2014,"Absolutely disappointed!!!  45 minute wait due to heavy crowd watching Giants Post Season Game, OKAY understandable.  Hot Spin/Dip was cold and served with a bunch of broken bottom of the bag chips The GF ordered a Chicken Cobb Salad, FIRST bite she bit included a 1 inch piece of plastic! Manager came to ""check it out"" she took the piece of plastic and salad and brought a ""fresh"" one out which had no chicken!  I order bread bowl clam chowder and wedge salad combo. The bowl was actually 1/4 cup of warm soup in a huge bread bowl. The wedge had NO dressing.  The staff was flustered trying to keep up with demand of the dine in guest. Understandable but the quality of food shouldn't change due to high demand.  2 stars are for the kids meals and tvs. Kids enjoyed food it looked fresh. I'm disappointed I couldn't say the same about the adults food."
Elan K.,"Oakland, CA",121,13,1,2.0,11/9/2014,"The good?  The bathroom was clean. We got seated quickly.  The bad? Everything else. Bland Bloody Mary, my breakfast pizza had a piece of blue plastic in it, the bacon was all limp fat with almost no meat on it, 2 of our 3 orders were delivered incorrectly - despite being ordered directly off the menu with no substitutions, we never got a side we ordered but they still tried to charge for it... Yuck yuck yuck."
Jim P.,"Mountain View, CA",396,489,146,3.0,1/4/2015,"Good food, great drinks, tons of TV's for sports.  Since this place is in a mall it can get slammed with people sometimes, making the service sometimes slow and the noise level over the top.  Best bet is to get into the bar section for faster service on drinks!  When it's quiet this place is great, but when there's a ton of families it's horrible!"
P. C.,"San Francisco, CA",69,56,3,2.0,4/27/2014,"If I was rating the food, it would get 5 stars!! I continuously come back here to see if their service would change for the better but sadly it's still the same. I even decided to come at a not so busy time too. The hostesses care more about talking about their personal lives and other co workers than they do their customers. That is not ok with me. Being seated towards the middle area, I notice it's always a social gathering spot for the waiters/waitresses to hang out and make fun of customers. I CAN HEAR YOU!!!  I really hope management steps up and properly trains their staff more!  Your food is so good!!!! Get the staff to match it!!!"
Tiffany W.,"San Bruno, CA",35,638,5,1.0,11/13/2012,"We came here for dinner tonight b/c we had to order something at Sears. I wanted to go to Jack's across the street but my partner wanted to come here. I ordered an Atlantic salmon & he ordered Mahi Mahi over fried rice.  I ate 1/3 of my fish and 1/2 of my rice. Rice was bland. Steamed veggies consisted mostly of steamed squash. It was bland and horrible. Almost not consumable. It came with a soup--I had the tomato bisque.  His dish was not enough for him and he wanted to order more. Since i wasn't too thrilled with my order, he ended up eating the rest of my meal.  Food took a looong time to come. Prices were abit high, especially for such poor quality food. I'd go to Jack's next time. Not only better food, bigger portions with lots of veggies. I've been here once before and i had the chicken salad but you can't really screw up on salad."
Helena J.,"San Mateo, CA",0,18,17,5.0,10/9/2015,"LISTEN PEOPLE. LISTEN UP. If you want to relive your childhood dreams of Pizza Hut in its glory days, this is the establishment for you! But with beer. Delicious, glorious beer. BJs (and just try to type that without laughing) is incredible. The beer is cold and refreshing. The pizza is served on a spaceship. And the bartenders are top notch. What are you doing with your life?! What. Go to BJs. You won't regret it. *high fiving a million angels*"
jack d.,"San Francisco, CA",5000,339,,4.0,12/5/2014,"Took my son to BJ''s Brewery for his birthday and was pleasantly surprised with the very good food and good service, Everyone enjoyed their meals as well as the Pizooki that we had afterwards. I tried their local ale which was OK being a brewery and all. The server, Jeremy was very good and efficient, The only drawback is the wait for about 50 minutes but it was worth it."
Bree B.,"Ventura, CA",10,26,2,1.0,5/3/2015,"Waited at least 10 min for the server to acknowledge us. Then had to ask for silverware,  napkins, plates. Asked two times for extra sauce. They got my entree wrong. Didn't deliver my fiances, when they finally did, it was wrong too and undercooked. Terrible Terrible terrible service. Steer clear of this place. You'll regret it if you don't."
AJ C.,"Daly City, CA",49,150,402,5.0,5/25/2015,Al is the best server ever! Thank you so much for giving my table a lot of attention. You made my night
Stephanie M.,"Kapolei, HI",150,62,243,4.0,7/15/2014,"I have been here a couple times. The service is pretty good. There are a couple workers who could improve their attitude a bit but I'm sure it will improve over time.  The food did take a while to come out, and some dishes are a hit or miss. Their pasta dishes, calzone& pizzas are really good. But I would probably spice up their artichoke dip and Santa Fe egg rolls.  Them make their own root beer &cream soda; both of which are sooo yummy. And free refills. (Win!)  Their drinks are also really good. Their strawberry &wild berry mojitos are very good. They have a good selection of beers including ones that are brewed by them. And you can't leave BJ's without having a pizookie. The best invention. We got the salted caramel pizookie &it was sinfully good. It was a caramel cookie with toffee bits topped with vanilla bean ice cream, caramel drizzled over and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square for the final touch. Heaven in my mouth!"
Kat S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",221,48,23,1.0,12/29/2013,"My uncle and I came here today for lunch and we waited about 20-25 minutes. When we were about to be seated the table wasn't even cleaned off or sanitized off. So we were just standing there waiting for a busser to come clean it.  Our server didn't provide utensils before our meals arrived and had to ask for them, which took a while. At this point we were kind of irritated already. I had ordered a side salad with my entree and my server didn't write it down and I never received it. And when we ordered our dessert it took maybe more than 20 minutes just for a pizookie. And we even got our check before our dessert was even served.  So disappointed at this location because all the other times I've been to Bjs service had been great. Sad to say that I won't be returning to this location."
Norm D.,"San Francisco, CA",54,130,415,2.0,9/5/2015,"Located within the Tanforan Shopping Center next to Barnes and Nobles Books. Came in here with a friend to have a few beers, food, and some conversation. Wasn't very crowded in the middle of the day in a busy shopping center. The layout of the restaurant is similar to all the other BJ's I've ever been at in Northern California. We sat in the bar area and ordered their hefeweizen beer and some appetizers. We ordered their Chicken Wings (with the hot sauce on the side), the Pepperoni Extreme flatbread pizza, and their Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. It had twice cooked shredded pork, roasted green chili sauce and jack and cheddar cheese, and was topped with freshly chopped onions and cilantro. Frankly, the Carnitas Fries was not very good in my opinion, as it was rather bland and the shredded carnitas themselves were disappointing. Service was reasonable, but we had to ask for small individual serving plates and silverware. It's what I expected from BJ's, a chain brewery hangout. Wasn't bad, but wasn't great. It is what is is, hit and miss."
Courtney Q.,"San Francisco, CA",451,137,71,2.0,7/22/2014,"BJ's just aint what it used to be.  I've ordered the chicken baked potato every time ive been to BJs for years now and it just isnt up to par with what it used to be. Went from delicious to just a meh super starchy thing. The size of it also went WAY down. I remember the first time I got it, my eyes lit up as they marveled at the sheer enormity of the potato. On the plus side, it comes with a salad now. You have to find the potato on the lunch menu (you can still order it for dinner) if you want to order it. It wasn't just the potato that lost its grandeur though. My friend sitting next to me got one of their pastas and she said it used to be super yummy but was just bland now. The server was accommodating for our large group of 10 or so, and you still get the birthday pizookie."
Vinnie P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,10/18/2015,Still crapy service and terrible customer treatment. Walked in today at 4:50pm and stood right in front of the Spanish guy working at the hosting station and for 2 or 3 minutes and never even acknowledged me. Thought I'd try them again since the last review and never even made it to the table this time. I will never ever go back to BJ's in San Bruno again as long as I live and will inform everyone I know!
Jade T.,"San Francisco, CA",156,325,1069,2.0,5/25/2014,"Came here because one of my friends and I like to have Pizookie dates once a year.. and we didn't like our experience at this one at all. The decor feels a bit outdated compared to the other BJs, with low ceilings and very dark lights. It was incredibly busy on a week night (and hearing from others, it seems like it's packed everyday) and the servers just seemed really unprofessional. They were commenting on other patrons, rolling their eyes and two walked by adjusting their pants.. enough that they should have just done it in a back room / bathroom. Nobody wants to see that while eating, c'mon. My pasta dish was okay, while the salad was so bland that my vegetarian friend couldn't even finish it. We were sure some ingredients had been left off of it. The funniest part was when our Pizookie came. It looked burnt all around the edges, and when my friend tried to spoon some.. she couldn't even break through the top crust! We laughed, which attracted the attention of our server, who asked if it was too hard. When we said yes, he said he thought so... then why would he still bring it out? He ended up replacing it with a ""good"" one, no harm done. Overall off experience, but hey.. at least it's only once a year! I gotta say though.. a hard Pizookie is a very sad Pizookie!"
David M.,"San Francisco, CA",169,34,16,1.0,4/1/2014,"Don't be fooled. This ""brewhouse"" is just another corporate sham. The service is shoddy -- bring the wrong food out, apps coming out at the same time as entrees, lack of customer service -- the food is meh, and their ""Deep-Dish"" pizza has nothing deep dish about it. It needs to be re-named ""Thick-Crust"" pizza. Deep dish pizza has sauce on top with pie-like attributes.  As Kevin Sorbo once said, ""DISAPPOINTED!"""
