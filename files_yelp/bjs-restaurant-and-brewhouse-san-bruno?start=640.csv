Tee L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,196,3,2.0,7/15/2014,"Stopped in to meet a friend for a light bite/ happy hour I m not a beer drinker, and happy hour menu is limited Service was ok, had to call out to find our waiter, as we found a table in the bar area ,looks like the previous people did not like their burger was barely half eaten. Got our waiter to clean up and take our order.. Lettuce wraps was ok , nothing to write home about, yes the avocado rolls were slightly better,,, sliders a little overdone. This is my first visit here, I think I' ll pass and go somewhere else, next time."
Cheryl M.,"San Francisco, CA",98,11,2,2.0,2/16/2014,"* wrote this review at the restaurant as it happened - host told us it was a 20 min wait for two people. After about 35 mins, we decided to go inside to ask how much longer. They messed up and said the reason why it took longer is because they put us down for four. Uh doesn't make sense. - got seated outside (area by Barnes and Noble) at a table that's seriously hidden which also didn't make sense because there were two booths open. When the host brought us to our table, we saw that there were still plates and cups. - waited about 15 mins for our server. - complained about how there was something in my water and got no apology. - all the workers that came to our table were impolite   Literally 5 mins after we got our food we decided to just take the food to go. The stars are for the food..and how much tip I left. Ha!"
Samantha A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,5,1,2.0,11/8/2015,"I went here a few weeks ago with my friend. I rated this 2 stars because the service wasn't great. They were slow at getting our food and check. They brought my friend the wrong drink also, and our server was no where around. Needless to say we had about three different servers. On the bright side the food was pretty good"
Keng G.,"South San Francisco, CA",147,56,5,1.0,7/8/2015,"The hostesses are very welcoming. Some servers lack customer service such as checking up on the table even if it's every 10 minutes. Food quality is getting smaller and worse. Chefs lack presentation as well as the quality of the food. They suck. If Chef Gordon Ramsay were to review this BJ's location, he would cuss out the managers for allowing this to happen. The drinks/beers are good though. I'll give them that."
Sid G.,"Union City, CA",6,64,153,4.0,1/20/2012,This BJ's is a life saver in the area where there are very few choices... The service here usually is prompt...the only thing abt this place is the wait time... The best thing to do is to  Their brewery beers are top notch... I  like the jermiah and the heff..
Teri C.,"San Bruno, CA",141,10,5,5.0,11/6/2015,"We were part of a large group tonight with about 20 people, including 3 children. I was impressed with our server, her name is Eva. She did everything that she could to accommodate our large party. Some of us arrived late and she rushed our additional food orders. I will definitely return to BJ's! ! The service was great tonight! I asked to speak with the Manager so that I could provide this feedback and he arrived at our table within a minute and asked if we needed anything.  Great service and great food! ! Kudos to our awesome server --- thanks Eva for awesome customer service !!"
Michelle A.,"Lyons, CO",0,16,4,2.0,11/6/2015,"Sad. Waited for our drink order. Husband likes IPA. Server comes back and says they are out so H orders a different one. Server comes back, now they are out of all tap IPAs.  Really!?! On Friday night? H gets a bottled beer. He asks for a glass. When it comes the outside is dirty.  We then order food and a salad. Wait wait wait. Salad finally comes, then we get our food 2 minutes later. The bill comes promptly of course. On our way out we see the happy hour sign. Beers should have been $1 off each one.  But it just wasn't worth the hassle. First and LAST time there. Stay away from this awful service. The food was fine but extremely overpriced."
Nichole P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/4/2015,"No stars! I have no idea why I eat here but this is certainly the last time. Was seated and waited for 15 minutes, no one and I mean no one stop by our table. Yet the people seated next to us (who came in afterward my party), were served drinks before us. Finally just got up and left. Took my money to Red Robins!"
Christina P.,"San Francisco, CA",6,120,7,2.0,6/15/2014,"Service - super friendly Food - meh... to lackluster. And this is based on some of the menu items recommended by the waiter. My $12 pasta tasted like Kraft dinner. My friend's pizza was teeny tiny and burnt.  The reason that this place isn't demoted down to 1 star is because of the wait staff that really did try to be friendly and helpful, and because of its location. That mall has only few sit-down and dine options within the mall (others being Hooters, and Vietnamese restaurant)"
Patricia G.,"San Francisco, CA",14,43,15,1.0,7/22/2015,"Use to like BJ's but not anymore. Beer selection is pretty good! Service last night sucked. Waiter only check on us twice! To get our order and to refill my drink! Waiter was nice, but was too busy with his own friends to pay attention to our table. Would've wanted dessert but I decided against it because of the bad service and I didn't want to wait for him to forget my dessert. Bad birthday dinner, all I wanted was the pizookie! Over BJ's!!!"
Tiffany C.,"San Francisco, CA",299,312,316,4.0,1/3/2012,"I came here a couple of time and usually there is a wait. Most times the wait isnt too bad. However, the last time I came here, it was Monday nightfoot ball. This place is crazy. We made reservations for 6:30 but didnt get seated till 8! Super crazy, but I feel that for football fans its a great place. Everyone cheers when something good happens and yells when something bad happens. Its very spirited and my friends loved it! But personally I just wanted dinner. They have TVs everywhere and I am sure that from every booth anyone can get a good view.  I love the deep dish pizza, esp the great white but this time I tried something different. I tried one of the low calories dish and to my surprise it was super delicious too! I forgot the name to the dish but it had grilled fish with rice.  I will definitely come back but probably no on a Monday night."
Kristen T.,"Beverly Crest, Los Angeles, CA",2,11,1,1.0,4/2/2015,We were told it would be about a 20 to 30 minute wait to be seated when 30 minutes was up we were told another 20 minutes on top of that. After about an hour wait we were finally seated with no silverware and our waiter took another 15 minutes to get our drink orders. Another 30 minutes later our food finally came and it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time because the noodles in my pasta were crunchy and stuck together and it was not warm. We still had no silverware. The manger did have new pastas made which took another 30 minutes. Another girls avocado egg rolls were made with rotten avocados and looked brown and mushy! This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant!
Deira R.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/29/2015,I would come here with my best friend and family all the time but their service is just awful. The last 3 times I was there. Again 3 times in a row we waited for an hour for our meal and another 45 minutes for a dessert after we complained about the service . keep in mind the restaurant wasn't even busy. the food is cold by the time we got it which sucks because we already waited an hour for our food. Just no I don't know what else to say.
Eugenia F.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",1,53,22,2.0,8/5/2015,"I heard that it wasn't so good so put off going. Finally hubby went and liked it. We went on a Tuesday for dinner. We were seated after 5 minutes as promised   I had the clam chowder, Brussels sprouts, and we split a full rack of ribs. All were mediocre and the atmosphere was not cozy.  Probably will try again for the thin pizza. Service was slow and we had to direct someone else to get check."
Judy P.,"Moraga, CA",1,15,1,1.0,6/5/2016,"This is the worst BJ's ever! It is hard to mess one up, but they mastered it. Horrible service, 45 min. to just get my dish, Mahi and shrimp, but my husband's ahi salad, had not arrived yet. How long can it take to make a cold Ahi dinner? The Mahi was Luke warm when it arrived, inedible . The garlic knot was hard as a rock. Called the manager. She said she would get me something else... Let me remind you the ahi salad... Still not arrived. So I ordered the kale brussel sprout salad, which she said would be ""super speedy"". 15 min later both showed up. Unfortunately you could not eat the brussel sprouts because they were not cooked fully. I guess that would have taken another 15 min. No wait, it's a cold salad and they should have been ready ! Good news is the ahi salad was edible . They also charged us for everything which if they were smart they might have at least in good faith have given me the salad. Oh and the bill it took 15 min after asking the waiter for the bill for it to arrive. Never will we return!"
Rikki S.,"San Pablo, CA",89,78,59,3.0,1/29/2014,Not a big fan of thier food but def like thier beer and pazookie!! Love the pazookie!! My fav is chocolate chip with ice cream.. very traditional yet very good. After work I was craving a beer and a pazookie soi went to bjs with my brother and had one. Didn't get a beer bit tried thier mojitos.. It was good but I still prefer skates mojitos better ..
Will M.,"San Bruno, CA",13,1,6,5.0,8/4/2015,Very impressed by our server: Andrew. I've been to this BJ's so many times and Andrew is by far the best server I've had yet.
Patricia S.,"San Francisco, CA",132,13,14,3.0,1/16/2012,"Came here with some friends the other day. First off, the waiter was kind of rude. I think his name was Tom but I'm not sure. We asked for separate tabs and he gave us some look like, ""Uhhh, wtf? Okay? Fine."" Uhhh hello! Some of us like separate tabs so that we don't have to deal with who owes who what.  Then, my friend gets his chili and it's lukewarm! Last time I checked, chili is supposed to be hot. We explained this to the waiter and we get another kind of look except it wasn't as obvious. (He probably heard us talking about the first time and giving a low tip because when he would come back, he was more energetic and upbeat with his tone.) So now I get my crispy chicken sandwich with fries. I love their thin-cut fries. Mmmm! As I was eating the sandwich, I noticed that the tomato was MUSH! Gross. It looked like it was a spread on my chicken instead. I tried to take it off but only the rim came off. That's how bad the tomato was. C'mon BJ's! If I'm paying $10 for a sandwich, the least you can do is give me a fresh tomato! And I'd like to add that another time I came with a group of friends, our waitress was kind but was rushing us. It felt like she was trying to get us out asap. RUDE. About only 30 minutes into our meal, she was already asking us if we needed boxes. We weren't even done yet! -___- And this last time (I mentioned above), our waiter was really slow. I needed a few more minutes to decide what to order, and he comes back like 10 minutes later and it wasn't even busy. Now I need a refill which I told him, and I wait another 5 minutes.  BJ's needs to work on their service!"
Addy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",424,53,148,2.0,1/7/2014,"It was an alright experience. I don't think it was worth our wait nor the cost of food. We waited over 2 hours for a table for 8. Yes, my friend didn't make reservations prior, but I think it's reasonable to let your customers know you can't sit there forever. After quite some wait for the waiter to come around with water, then to take our orders, I asked for the BlueHouse cheeseburger w/ wedge-cut fries. The fries were good, but the burger was nothing special nor worth the $9-10. It was just a bit over the size of an In-N-Out burger, and the meat was dry and flavorless. My friends ordered some drinks, and the cider was fruity, fizzy, and you can hardly taste the alcohol (I'm not saying this is a bad thing, though!) Regarding the service, some of my friends ordered thin-cut fries but received fries that were wedge-cut. The waiter informed us after we all received our dishes that they had ran out of thin-cut fries. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but customer service-oriented workers would make sure that their clients knew what they would be paying for beforehand. I, for a fact, would've ordered a salad if they ran out of wedge-cut fries. We were celebrating my friend's birthday, so we ordered a 3-set mini pizooki platter: red velvet, double chocolate, and white macadamia (not sure of the actual dish names). The dessert took a while to arrive, but eventually, out of the corner of my eye, our waitress seems to walk in slo-mo as she delivers our pizooki topped with ... half-melted vanilla ice cream. This was the most disheartening part of the night for me. I've been to BJ's before and I was never served dripping, melted, sad ice cream. Considering that the double chocolate cookie was very yummy, its presentation was a huge disappointment. Also, my friend ordered a pasta dish and got food poisoning the next morning."
Grence Whinsel D.,"Pleasanton, CA",21,5,,3.0,8/18/2015,Hit and miss with the service here. Youre mostly paying for the environment. Food is mediocre. Theur desserts are the only thing worth buying but thats just my opinion.
