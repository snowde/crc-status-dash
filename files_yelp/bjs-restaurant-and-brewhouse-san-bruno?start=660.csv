Shae B.,"Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, CA",0,5,23,1.0,3/14/2014,"Really good food however, take out service is horrible. Called to order before I came and still had to wait 20mins. Once my order came it was very incorrect. I took it anyway but the decided to come back to return it after taking a peak at it in my car. When I told the takeout server I didn't want it and could the remake the correct order, she said yes and I had to wait an additional 30mins. While waiting I overheard other dissatisfied takeout customers and the server repeatedly apologizing."
Kevin T.,"San Diego, CA",274,9,9,1.0,12/23/2013,"Went with family here to eat for dinner after the 49ers game. The lady at the counter was very polite after we waited for a table. It took 30 minutes for the food to come out and that was only the salad. They even served us the salads without utensils. In addition, our waiter just disappeared after placing our order. I managed to flag down a different waiter to request cheese for my baked potato, but he never came back. Our main server hardly checked on us, we had to call three different waiters for our requests, such as sauce, condiments, and the bill. Overall, the service was horrible. We  had to call a different waiter to tell the manager to get our bill.  The food quality lacked. I had the New York steak which was on the dry side. My sister ordered the Top Sirloin with Lobster and the lobster didn't come out. We requested a separate dish for the lobster and ended up with a whole new plate including the sides and top sirloin; we got charged twice.."
Craig T.,"San Jose, CA",95,51,3,2.0,6/27/2014,"Inconsistent-ville.    It's really hit or miss with this Bj's.  Tonight I was served a wilted warm Caesar salad and a ribeye well below the requested medium cook temperature.  If it weren't for a great waitress I'd give this place a single star since you cannot give a zero star.  Some nights it's great service and food.  Some nights not so much.   Rather annoying.  I guess the smoke and mirrors of serving ""hand craft beer"" is enough for some.  Starting to wonder if BJs has outgrown themselves and is becoming more of a Chili's."
Robbin P.,"Pacifica, CA",0,6,,2.0,5/10/2016,The brussel sprouts are hard as a rock  .  Wait staff and cooks do not communicate at all.
Cyrillo N.,"Daly City, CA",143,20,3,1.0,8/8/2014,"Hello!! I went to BJ's last sunday on lunch time and I got surprise with the customer  survice  from the bartender he's name is ""JAMES"". My girlfriend had asked to him: Hey how's ur day going?? And JAMES just looking to my girl on bad face and saying to her: my day is not doing good.... Is not good!!!!!  At the same time I tought really??? That's the way u have to say for my girl??? Hummmm... Ok..... We wish to cancel the bill but we was soooo f... Hungry  Food was good anyways... My deal with BJ's from now is: if I go there next time and see "" STUPID JAMES"" over there, I'll asking for leaving!!!! I'm sorry BJ's. Thank you."
RW M.,"Yuba City, CA",0,30,15,4.0,5/25/2016,"Came here twice today this evening was a great experience.  Excellent drinks. The strawberry margaritas were very good. Our server, Nick was awesome. He was very attentive and on top of everything. A great night overall."

Jen C.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,1,1.0,10/4/2015,"We were turned off by the slow service.  Waited forever for our food, and did not receive any updates from the server in regards to the delay.  She seemed more interested in one of the male servers than in her customers.  I kept seeing her just standing there talking with this one guy, which is cool if you would have taken care of your customers first.  My pizza was served cold and not even cut through into slices."
Adorable T.,"Burlingame, CA",50,206,134,1.0,10/21/2013,"I didn't think this could happen, but I had an even worse experience than last time.  The server was a sweet gentleman, but could not get the order right for half of the table. We came with a table of 9 around 7:45pm on a Sunday night to watch the game. The wait was about 45 minutes. I ordered the chicken club (recommended by the server) without mayo and with the bacon on the side (to share with my sister).  Food came with mayo and with no bacon. I let the mayo slide although this could be a health request. Nevertheless, I reminded the server that I wanted the bacon on the side. Another person at my table did not get her correct order either. It was also my sister's bday, so we wanted to get a pizooki sampler (3 small pizookis). I asked him quietly on the side to present it with a candle to my sister sitting a few seats away from me on the other side of the table (which I pointed out). He comes back with one chocolate pizooki with a candle and asks me which person it goes to. Not the right order. Not longer a surprise. Not happy at this point. I mentioned to him that was not what I ordered, and he immediately put in the request for the pizooki. By that time, no one wanted to eat a pizooki anymore. Literally 2 minutes after I asked for the order to be cancelled. He ""asked his manager"" and couldn't cancel the order because they were in the process of making the platter. .................................... Really? For someone who keeps on f'ing up orders, the least you can do is to  cancel this. No one wants to eat the mediocre food anymore. Get the pizooki, no one wants to eat it, asked for the check. Split the checks with 3 cards (the limit) and wrote the card names and totals at the top of the bill. He came back with some random totals for each card. Wth??? He also said one of the cards declined... which was weird, because it worked earlier for this person. Confused. When he I returned, I told him the totals were at the top and that he mischarged multiple credit cards. He apologized and went back to fix the mistake. This included running my friend's card again which went through fine. Service is a huge part of the dining out experience! I should not have to feel stressed or annoyed when I'm eating out. Not sure what's up with the waiters here (or manager for not cancelling a pizooki order--seriously, it's worth $ and can be disposed of), but I would not come again. Food is mediocre at best."
Nick L.,"San Bruno, CA",1,121,1,5.0,8/2/2015,"OK...this place is probably actually only a 4, but I decided to give it a compensating 5. People downgrading a restaurant because it is always packed really have Yogi Berra's disease. Food is consistently good - never had a bad meal there (out of 10 or so meals). I bit understaffed with waiters, but they are consistently of decent cheer. It's unlikely that you'll get a bad meal there and will sometimes have a great one."
Sarmad N.,"San Leandro, CA",468,288,145,4.0,5/10/2014,I made reservations here for my wife's birthday party about a week ahead of time. They told me they would not allow a party our size to split our check. This caused issues but none the less we still decided to deal with it. The day off they called and confirmed our party. When we arrived we were seated quickly and they got drinks to us very fast. However it seems like some of their wait staff didnt show up and they seemed like they were short staffed despite that they delivered good service. They didn't rush us on leaving even though the restaurant got filled up and they did allow us to split the checks as apposed to having me pay and then get paid back from my group. Over all this was a very good experience. I would return and highly recommended them. The food was good. Too many items with high amount of calories. They did have alternatives with healthier options.
T. W.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,426,202,3.0,3/24/2015,"It's your typical BJ's.  Diverse menu, mediocre food and service."
Janice C.,"San Francisco, CA",528,2174,5892,4.0,7/23/2009,"I like BJ's. Why?  Because they offer choices that will feed even the pickiest of eaters. My gfs and I took our time deciding what to order, because frankly, there are 100 items on the menu.  Between cocktail and beer choices, pasta, sandwiches, salads, house entrees and of course, deep dish pizza.   Since I'm still a novice when it comes to the beer world, I just stuck with a Hefeweizen. I thought it went well with my BJ's favorite pizza -- meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, green peppers, olives, onions and tomatoes.  My mouth was going chomp, chomp, chomp and I couldn't stop!!!  The chicken parmesan with mashed potatoes was also good.  For dessert, of course we had the pazookie! Chocolate ice cream on top of dark chocolate chip cookie, with a Ghirardelli chocolate square.  Triple chocolate overload! (but in a good way) Our server Carlos was efficient and didn't bother us too much as we were too busy catching up on the gossip.  Towards the end of the meal, he informed us that another server is taking over.   15 minutes later, the substitute waitress asked us if we want the bill.  My gfs and I looked at each other.  Is she sub-consciously telling us that we need to vacate the table??? * I glanced at the time.  Holy Mackerel!  8:45pm! * We've been here for about 3 1/2 hours!!   With all that chomping and chatting we've been doing, no wonder my jaws hurt!"
George S.,"Vallejo, CA",9,63,2,2.0,10/10/2013,"Two stars is so misleading because the food is actually incredibly good. Came here late night with my girlfriend and ordered the shit outta all the appetizers which are surprisingly filling when you buy aLL OF THEM. But mostly I subtracted 3 stars for the poooooor pooor soo poor service. Front lady seemed like she didn't know where to put us, asking if we wanted to go to the bar even though there was like so many tables open literally like 5 x more tables open that we could have sat at then space available at the bar. But she spoke as if that wasn't an option. So we just sat at the table instead and let her know. And she just like .... decided not to inform any of the other waiters. So we sat there for a long time going unnoticed until I finally got annoyed enough to wave down a passing waiter who was just like ohh she'll handle you pointing to some other waitress. Then that waittress was just like I'll be right with you. And I was just like omg. I've worked in food service before so I know how NOT HARD it is to give good service. You smile and attend to a customer ASAP andleave them with absolute confidence that someone will help them soon. Instead of just a bunch of ""I don't knows"" and passing down the service to another and another and another person. So step your shit up BJ's. Because next time I'm here I'm going to take lots of photos and videos of each of your waiters and waitresses and note names so that I have a clearer review next time I'm annoyed."
Andy C.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/13/2016,Food was excellent. Drinks were tasty.  Brittany gave us excellent customer service and made sure we were taken care of.
Brandon Y.,"San Jose, CA",827,615,1134,2.0,3/27/2012,"It was one of my first happy hours with co-workers about a week ago, and I was looking forward to appetizers and drinks after a long day of work, so we decided to come to this BJ's. There weren't too many people there on a Wednesday afternoon, so seating 12 of us was rather easy, except for how we had to squish everyone in at those high tables. $2 off appetizers was nice, and I got potato skins, which were surprisingly good with the sauce they provided..it kind of tasted like a bleu cheese dressing almost, but that, along with the company was probably the best part of the gathering. BJ's Blonde Ale was just alright, and I finished it pretty quickly, but the trouble came when the waitress delivered the check...first, she refused to split the check by person and then gave us a max of 6 transactions, forcing a lot of us to use cash. Not only that, but after we figured out how much everyone owed with tax and tip included, we put the amount we wanted charged on each card on the receipt. Upon getting the cards back, not only did the waitress charge someone twice, but there was tip added on to the amounts that we had written down, and cash was given in a ten and a five dollar bill...we were so confused as to why she did not take the cash and charged what we had asked on the cards. Being way too confusing to work out each individual person's, we just coped with it and attempted to split the cash afterwards, but that latter part of happy hour was mostly raised eyebrows and arms as to why the waitress did this... I guess next time, we'll just have to come with less ppl so it is less confusing for them?...hrm."
Shaufaye Y.,"Cupertino, CA",15,22,30,1.0,10/28/2013,"Use the google offer to have brunch here, the weekend brunch is good deal, but taste just okay. The server is rude, took away my iPhone when I show her the offer. Feel not good about the service."
Mychael H.,"Hayward, CA",528,48,3072,5.0,3/2/2014,This is one of my favorite restaurant to go to because I like the food here is good and the alcohol is good it's a great place to watch your favorite sport team here. Rather come on Happy Hours.
Amanda B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",4,92,356,1.0,2/22/2015,"Avoid this place like the plague!  Slow service and atrocious communication between servers and kitchen staff. Even after discussing all the problems we had with the manager, we felt like our complaints fell on deaf ears. On top of that, when our second waiter of the night brought the bill, he said ""the manager took care of you guys, so have a good night."" Which sounds to a reasonable person as though our bill (which came to about $40) was comped. Nope!!!! They basically took off the items that we ordered and showed up AFTER we finished dinner, and that had been screwed up. Which we should not have had to pay for at all - so glad we didn't - but don't say the manager ""took care of"" us and mislead us about how you're making up for horrendous service! What a joke. Go anywhere else."
Smitha S.,"Millbrae, CA",1,12,34,5.0,5/23/2015,"Love love love their balsamic chicken. Its the third time I have been to Bj's and I have ordered the same dish all three times:). Also tried fried calamari, flatbread with chicken and avocados. They turned out great too. It is slightly expensive but the quantity and quality of food you get is impressive. As most of the reviews suggest, the wait time is really long. For us it was one hour. We spent the hour at the mall and when we came back our table was ready."
