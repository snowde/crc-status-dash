Calvin John B.,"Honolulu, HI",364,118,49,2.0,1/4/2014,"Of the three times that I've eaten there, never have I been completely satisfied with anything other than their beer. Whether it be service or food, most things I've experienced here were just sub-par. I'm not one to complain  too often, but you start to question what is acceptable in terms of the standard of food preparation, quality, taste, and so forth. I'm a pasta person. Parmigiana's, lasagna's spaghetti's and linguini's are my cushion so if it's there, I'll go for it! Every time I get those here, they for some reason end up with only a scoop-full of sauce with the pasta as dry as the desert. Steaks, chickens and other meats are a toss up. Sometimes they're well cooked and other times they're just plain chewy. My most recent trip, and one that nudged me into writing this review, was with a group of co-workers and I for a holiday dinner. One of us ordered take-out from our server for a steak. It came out burnt. We told the server what had happened but in turn we were told that cooks had already been told to prepare it the way we asked. Truth is, we were never asked. Adding to that, when we were ready to pay, we tried raising our hands each time he passed but it wasn't until fifteen minutes later where we eventually asked another server for ours to come by. At times, we even caught him helping other tables out then leaving for the back room again. When he finally came over, he collected our cards and didn't come back for another couple of minutes or so. The entire experience made us pull hairs, as we'd already had a long day at work to begin with. But not all is completely lost. There was a server that sat us and took our orders just fine. He talked stories for a bit, told us he'd been doing this for a very long time/ You can tell by the way he acted towards us - friendly and courteous. I would've been just fine with him as our server, but his shift was about to end and instead we got a newcomer. I'm not denouncing them, but I'm sure the more experienced ones have been through all sorts of craziness. At this point, I'm just going on a rant, but it really makes me think twice about planning another outing to BJ's again - at least to this location."
V B.,"Burlingame, CA",195,554,24,4.0,7/26/2013,"My first meal back and you want to eat at BJ's?  I came in with low expectations but with an open mind and very empty stomach. And in the end I walked away with little nod of approval. BJ's is not pretending to be something it's not. If you want Gary Danko then go to Gary Danko. But if you want a place that 1. Has choices pizza to steak to ""I'll try the halibut"" 2. Comfortable casual setting with good bordering on great service. 3. Easy access right off 280 with miles of parking. Bingo Bango Bongo! The tri-fecta! So I have to ask, why the three star rating? The wine list doesn't include a vintage Burgundy? It's a beer place! If you want a dirty gin martini, sure you can get that (and actually they make a good one) but the beer list is attraction."
Ariel S.,"Mountain View, CA",3,33,,4.0,7/29/2015,"They have good pizza, plenty of healthy entree choices which I enjoy, and lots of good appetizers. My favorite appetizer is the avocado eggrolls that I get with my family every time we go.  They also have a good alcohol selection which makes sense seeing as it is a brewery as well.  I like going here and frequently do with my family as a tradition."
Niko P.,"Sacramento, CA",6,10,,1.0,9/9/2013,"We decided to give BJ's one last good faith chance after our rough experience last time. What a mistake this was. BJ's has officially hit the bottom of the barrel.  The experience started with the initial phone call to put our name down on our way in. We have never had a problem with this before and they supposedly welcome call ins. At least you would think so. The girl who answered the phone was rude and snarky. After 5 minutes of telling her that we had some it before she finally allowed it. She was rude from the get go. We should have taken that as a sign. Foolishly we continued forward.  Next, terrible staff. Complete rush job to line their pockets. They rush you to order and are rude about it. I barely finished my order before the menu was ripped out of my hands. Same goes for my dining companion.  While waiting forever for our food, we had a hovering employee literally standing behind our table starting and just waiting. Making us very uncomfortable. Also, it is quite apparent that texting and phone calls are more important than doing your job and talking care of the customer. I watched one girl flat out ignore a customer directly in her line of sight. Only to pull her phone out and type out a lengthy text and then walk away from said customer.  Management isn't much better. Didn't care about any customer concerns or lack of customer service by his employees. He just stood there at the drink station doing nothing. Also having a terrible attitude.  Finally the food gets there. This was after watching 3 innings of the baseball game totaling about 30 minutes. The pizza we ordered was very dry. Little to no sauce whatsoever. That is sad some their pizza used to be awesome. The cajun pasta was undercooked. Very stiff rubbery noodles. Couldn't even flag anyone down to bring it to their attention.  The second it looked like we were done eating, the plates are snatched away and the check was on the table. Good thing I was done with my pasta. I wouldn't have had time to tell them I was still working on it.  This is the worst experience I've had at BJ's ever. There will be no next time from us. Save yourself some money and go somewhere else. Even Hotdog on a Stick would be better than this. There are better places to go."
Alayna's Momma S.,"San Bruno, CA",1,104,23,5.0,6/29/2015,"I came here a few times, and I've always walked out satisfied! Stuffed mushrooms are my favorite."
Shaft S.,"San Francisco, CA",53,7,,1.0,1/24/2015,"My wife and I were having repairs done on our car at Sears and walked over to BJs for lunch.  While the menu posted outside suggested above-average bar food, our overall experience was awful.  I hate writing that, but my wife and I want to make sure people know what this place is like.   We walked in and the hostess doesn't talk to us, picks up two menus, and as she is walking into the dining area says ""oh, if you want to sit in the bar it's open seating.""  Based on her surliness, we chose to sit in the bar.   We sat in the bar, were given menus, and introduced to our waitstaff rapidly. They took our drink orders promptly and came back shortly thereafter to get our food orders.  We ordered the buffalo chicken wings for an appetizer, and my wife chose the Barbecue Chicken Chop Salad while I had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich.    20-25 minutes later our food came out.  By ""our food"" I mean a salad without dressing and a cold beef sandwich. I am sure you are wondering about the chicken wings... So were we!   We were half way through our lunch 15 minutes in) when a waitstaff (not our waiter) brings out the chicken wings.  I sent them back and asked they be taken off our bill, but not before seeing a plate of what looked to be chicken pieces from birds ravaged by tuberculosis.  In the long run, we are healthier for not getting them. When our waiter finally came back to our table, about 30 minutes after the last time he came by, he apologized for the wings and we asked him for some salad dressing.  He comes back several minutes later to crack jokes and let us know the chicken was taken off the bill, but forgot the salad dressing.   The kicker of the meal - before we could give our waiter feedback on our crappy experience HE WENT ON LUNCH BREAK!  We were passed to another waiter who also avoided our table for another 20 minutes.   My wife and I do not openly complain about things, but this experience was the worst we have ever had in a restaurant and we will not be going back to this establishment"
Lyn D.,"San Francisco, CA",48,12,13,4.0,6/3/2015,"Good service, I had spring chicken burger with bottomless fries. Good place for comfort food. The server is nice and friendly."
Muncea M.,"San Mateo, CA",1,5,,2.0,7/23/2014,"Terrible food good service  So we visited the restaurant on a Wednesday it was pretty packed. They first sat us on a dirty table wtf??? Then our waiter came and took our orders. He was nice and all but he forgot our appetizer plate. He ended up not charging us though, And the food sucked! The salmon was smelly and totally not fresh and the pasta with meatballs had no flavor whatsoever. Awful food seriously"
Rich M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",20,19,,1.0,1/24/2014,"We visited again and it went down hill. How many tables should I watch the manager visit and apologies to before I become concerned? I ordered a steak salad - the steak should have been medium, but it was well done. I would have said something but it already took 45 minutes to arrive so I figured it wasn't worth it. I ordered soup, but it arrived about 5 minutes before my entree They should take one of the dozens of floor staff members and put a few more in food prep."
Sara N.,"South San Francisco, CA",5,16,19,3.0,7/18/2013,"This is just an easy go-to place for happy hour. The food isn't amazing, and the staff can be hit or miss. I've been lucky to get very good service the past few times I've been here.  I think the drinks are over priced, but the food is better than similar chain restaurants.   Love (4+ stars) 1) BJ's Famous Pizookie - Really indulgent dessert that I love.  Hot of the oven large chocolate chip cookie w/ vanilla bean ice cream. Can't go wrong with this one at all!  2) Pizookie Trio - Three small cookies topped w/ ice cream. You can choose between Chocolate Chunck, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter, Oatmeal Raisin Walnut, Cookies 'N Cream or Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli. Haven't tried the Oatmeal or the Cookies 'N Cream, but all the other flavors are great! Like (3 Stars) 1) Great White Pizza - Deep dish pizza with Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. I don't enjoy this pizza as much as the first time I ate it a couple years ago, but it's still a good go to.  2) Chicken Wontons (Thai style) - These are good small apps with a great Thair flavor. Nothing amazing...sometimes too oily, but they're a pretty safe bet. 3) Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Nothing special, but they're still pretty good. They do get soggy, so eat them right away! 4) Chicken Potstickers - Really good app, but over priced! I could honestly buy a bag of frozen Potstickers and make the same thing at home. But my gripe is w/ the price, not the taste of the dish. 5) Boneless Chicken Wings (Maui Sweet Teriyaki Glaze) - very good and if you go at the right time they're part of the happy hour special. Great portion size, and great flavor. The glaze was a bit sweet and spicy. Defiantly a safe bet. 6) Island Sunset, Tickled Pink,  & Peechy Keen Snagria - They're all OK drinks, but nothing special at all. Pass (1 or 2 stars) 1) Chicken Wontons (Buffalo style) - These are a hard pass...the flavor just is not there! 2) Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms - These are small app that I thought were VERY bland. 3) Avocado Egg Rolls - Really heavy and greasy.  I can't say I dislike them all together, but I felt a bit sick after eating them they're so rich. 4) Crispy Calamari - I should know better than to order calamari here...it was terrible. Not crispy at all, just chewy and really room temp. The lemon garlic aioli was so incredibly bland. Just BLAH all around. PASS on this one for sure!"
Kiho K.,"San Jose, CA",1,17,,1.0,5/29/2015,Worst experience  ever! Manager was an idiot! Food was just okay! Server was okay! Experience was the worst ever! I will never step my feet into that establishment!!!!
Cody R.,"Daly City, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/21/2015,"NEVER-EVER-EVER order take-out from here. Here's the timeline... I ordered online far in advance at 7:40 for pickup at 8:20. At 8:20 I arrived on-time to pick up, before being told it wasn't ready. Time waiting before food was ready to go... 8:55. So ultimately, I waited 35 minutes AFTER my pick-up time. All that extra time they needed, you might think they would use a few minutes to make sure the order was correct, NOPE!"
Diane E.,"San Francisco, CA",195,3,,4.0,7/18/2015,"Every time I go here I get a burger, fries and a mimosa. Both are always good and the servers are nice. The bartenders are very nice as well."
Jeff G.,"San Francisco, CA",197,339,9,2.0,12/7/2014,"Ehh... The food is always dependable.  It's better than Chili's or Applebees.  I guess what bugged me though was how slow and non-chalant the service was.  We had just gotten back from a trip, it was our last opportunity for some late night, decent food.  We were hungry. Really hungry.  So to wait 15 minutes at a table without any greeting was almost enough for us to leave.  We stayed out of hunger pains but still weren't impressed.  Having been a server before, I always followed three rules:  greet someone as soon as they sit down, keep drinks full and take care of the check quickly.  Our server was 0 for 3.  Knowing how difficult the job can be, I still left a decent tip.  It could've been an off night or maybe he was having a rough day.  Still though, it was an expensive meal for such crummy service."
Chris T.,"San Francisco, CA",321,53,14,1.0,11/3/2013,"I took my son here for what I hoped would be a fun ""guy's night"" dinner where we could watch some college football together. We got there a bit before the rush. It was busy, but since we were only two people, we were seated quickly. Most groups waiting and that were already seated seemed to be 6+. I overheard the manager telling someone who had walked in with a party of 10 that their wait could be 2 hours. So keep that in mind. The food is that kind of perfectly chewable, extremely-loaded-with-calories-and-salt lab-created food that large chain mall restaurants have. It's good because it's engineered that way. I had a french dip that had the most bizarre au jus I've ever tasted -- it was like teriyaki, but not. The server sized us up as being a cheap bill immediately and behaved that way. He asked us if we wanted to order right after being handed the menu, and if I wanted dessert with my mouth full of my entree. Anything that could have gotten us out of there faster would have made him ecstatic. He also had rehearsed jokes (""I'll have a french dip"" .. ""he just left!"") and kept nudging me on the shoulder when he wanted to say something to me. The other thing is, along with the menu, he presented me with a frequent diner card form and said I should fill it out. Throughout the meal, he kept trying to upsell me this stupid frequent diner card, saying things to my son like ""Dad let you use that pen instead of filling out the card"". Now, whoever at Corporate HQ thinks that pushing these frequent diner cards are a good idea needs to have their head checked. It's terribly annoying for customers and I can't imagine the upside is worth annoying a potential return customer with the hard upsell. If servers are incentivized to push this thing, seriously, stop it. We contemplated dessert but our waiter started paying more attention to the table of 10 that walked in next to us. So my son and I had the highlight our of meal, which was sharing a dip code at the nearby DQ. I recommend going there instead."
Kathy B.,"Daly City, CA",115,16,42,1.0,5/3/2015,"Don't really know what to say. We had bad service right from the beginning. We took a table that a server was starting to clear. He didn't come back to finish clearing it until six minutes after we sat down. When he took our food order, he said he can't guarantee that the appetizer will arrive before our main meal (what about placing the appetizer order first then put in our dinner order a few minutes later? Just a suggestion...). We told him it was fine. Dinner plates came, no appetizers. Ten minutes into our dinner, I asked if the appetizers were still coming. ""I'll check on it for you.""  Really? We ended up bringing the appetizers home - took three requests to get to go containers. The only thing he did fast was get our bill to us."
Brandon N.,"Redwood City, CA",174,160,10,3.0,3/24/2014,"Had lunch here today and was greeted by a nice host and waiter.  Our table had a slightly peculiar odor surrounding it, but it didnt bother me and my party enough to ask for a move.  Had the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. Caesar salad had a few pieces of limp lettuce, so I didnt ask for 2nds. 1st bowl was the clam chowder. It was one of the better soups at BJs. Pretty good amount of some good-size clams and creamy but not overly creamy soup. Next was tortilla soup. At first, they give you a dry bowl of tortilla chips, avocado and lime. Then they have a secondary container where the pour from to combine the soup with the dry ingredients, right at the table. Pretty cool from a presentation standpoint. Tortilla soup was overly salty but good.  Last up was the chili. I didn't have any, but my friend reported that it had an ale flavor about it. Not my cup of tea  so i passed. 2 stars for the food, extra star for the employees."
Nanooje N.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,18,,1.0,7/12/2015,"Service is great and the beer is good. Food tastes like it has been microwaved and served. Pizza is a pile of grease, sliders look like they have been stepped on, and the ""fresh avocado rolls"" are a fresh shade of brown."
Alessandra T.,"Brisbane, CA",1,71,76,4.0,5/21/2014,You have to know what to order here. My son loves the kids MAC and cheese so if he is happy I am happy. Normally they serve lots of food do we eat it for dinner :)
Krystal S.,"Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, CA",70,48,61,4.0,12/19/2013,"This place has really big TVs all around the joint so it's an ideal place for watching any type of sports, on the bad side this place gets pretty packed any night of the week so you can be waiting for up to 45 minutes or longer that is the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars. The food is awesome tho...I've had the pizza, pasta, salmon, appetizers and even the drinks are yummy!!! The service isn't bad either I have never had a bad experience with a server so far. So if you ever get hungry after a long day of shopping and do not want food court food come to bj's at Tanforan you won't be disappointed! Oh I forgot to mention they brew their own beer here and I have tried the pale ales all the way to the dark and they are sure to have one for every type."
