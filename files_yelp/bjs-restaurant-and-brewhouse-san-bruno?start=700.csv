Neysa O.,"Plano, TX",124,6,1,1.0,12/6/2014,Terrible customer service! Were told the wait was 45 min. Turned into a hour and 10 min. There were 3 of us. They brought the first meal before anyone else's. The second meal came 10 min later but was brought out wrong. So waited another 10 minutes or so for the fixed meal. Then we had to ask for the third meal. Which came out 25 min or more later. Never coming again.
Frank B.,"Bay Area, CA",0,14,,1.0,4/23/2013,"Service at the front of the house was amateur. Server was friendly, but food took nearly an hour to arrive.  Food was expensive and mediocre. Our entire family became violently ill directly after eating here.  First time catching a foodborne illness.  Terrible!"
Jenna H.,"San Francisco, CA",376,235,15,1.0,10/16/2013,"I wish I could give a review for the food, but sadly never got that far. I'll admit it was bad thinking on my part to come here on football sunday, but I was disappointed with their inaccurate and unorganized manner. Initially came and was told a 20min wait. My boyfriend and I put our name on the list and waited. We noticed there was a side area to eat in (in the mall) was was fairly empty. There were maybe 3 current parties in this section, and plenty of 2 or 4 seat tables. We asked if moving ourselves to that list would expedite our wait. One of the hostesses went to check, and said there were several parties on that list and it would take approximately 15 minutes. We thought it was odd, cause it was fairly open, but we decided to keep to our current estimated wait.  25 min later: we asked the hostess where we were on the list. She approximated another 20 minute wait. The boyfriend was too hungry so we decided to find something faster in the mall. As we walked out, we noticed the side area had maybe one larger party of 5 (in addition) that was in the area, but there were a couple 2-seat booths still available. Smh..."
Nobu K.,"San Francisco, CA",1530,966,45,2.0,4/23/2013,"Jim Bean Bourbon Burger, at Carl's Jr. 6 bucks. That's the most great deceptive advertising burger ever as we all know. It just doesn't look like the TV ad, at all. I think Carl's Jr. always does that deceptive TV advertising using fashion model to fool guys around.  A guy like myself.  I am a fool. I really wanted to get the Bourbon Burger, at Carl's Jr. And I did the other day. It was a creepy bad disgusting burger ever had. I believe it was soy-sause mixed w/ high fructose corn syrup plus msg for kick, and calling Bourbon Burger. False Advertising. But, if, you are having a burger is not better than that, that'll be a problem. I had a bacon Cheese burger at BJ's. I was with my friends. My friends like BJ's. I think because those TVs on the wall. I have been avoiding coming here so many times with them but I could not say No to this time. I just did not like the hamburger, OK? The burger patty was dry, not moist at all. It was cold, I hate eating cold burger. I am very sure that my burger was sitting in the kitchen for a while because the place is really big. That is very hard for all wait-staff. We were sitting near by the kitchen so I have heard the commotions from the kitchen and waiters hit the door very hard and came out. That's not good sign seeing and making a bit curious possibly a fight between kitchen staff and waiter, no matter what. All kitchen-staff in any restaurants in California are basically own by Mexicans, right? It's pretty rough in there if you don't speak Spanish. They will tear you down. They'll talk bad behind you back. We all do, don't we? California kitchens are all rough world. But, they should keep their problem more quietly in the kitchen. I felt bad for the waitstaff because our waitress was good. They must have a bigass kitchen, many people working really hard, but a big restaurant like this, I don not know how to manage people, how to control orders and who gets 1st, and what not. So, I do feel sorry giving the place 2 star. But, Hey, my hamburger was not that good. Bourbon Burger at Carl's   better. So, I still try to avoid the place. I hate my friends, sometimes."
Azinda M.,"Chicago, IL",28,289,8,2.0,3/14/2014,"I usually love BJs, and their food is great, so no problems there. I recommend their spicy tomato pasta, tacos, any of their pizzas, and especially their pizookies-- YUM. My favorite is the Oreo, but they're all good--definitely get one if you're here. As for the service, it was HORRIBLE the last time I went. They took 10-15 minutes just to get us water!!! That's absolutely ridiculous, in my opinion. I couldn't believe how bad that was. Not only that, after they took our order (2 appetizers and a pizookie), we waited another hour for our food to show up. Horrible horrible service. Go here if you don't mind using the wait to chat with your friends or family, but definitely not if you're in a rush."
Aaron W.,"Davis, CA",1,26,7,2.0,6/29/2015,"The beer is just ok, the ciders are too sweet and the appetizers are meager: we got 5 potstickers for $11. That's US currency!"
Mike P.,"San Bruno, CA",1,9,,3.0,7/28/2015,"I've been here a number of times over the years since they openend.  They have decent food, but slow service.  Parking in the Tanforan lot can be a chore.  Prices are decent for the quality of the food, but there are much better options in the area. They do have a broad selection though, including some gluten free itrms, and if you like beer they have several pages of options. If you're meeting people or want something better than food court fare at the Tanforan mall, it's ok.  Otherwise, not really worth the wait."
Sai K.,"San Francisco, CA",119,23,3,4.0,6/26/2015,I went here like 5 times until now. I really love this place. very courteous staff. nice big menu. delicious food and the seating is really good. not too loud and not too calm. I like their drinks too. I always get the skinny rita
Diana S.,"Daly City, CA",261,6,2,2.0,11/18/2013,"A year ago--- I had a party of 12 to celebrate a friends birthday. We gathered our party to the bar area and was able to seat ourselves.  First server was very nice but left us to another server. She was nice, busy and could do better in making is feel welcome to her section. We ordered. We waited for the whole party to join us than order so more. She didn't ring up our food up until we are all ready as a whole group. Finally we waited. Got our drinks, food and appetizers. THE FOOD RUNNER was absolutely rude. ""I have a pizza"" stares at us with a mad face making us feel we order something wrong. Simply made the mood of party a bummer. I let it go but my party was upset for the rude service. He comes back with more food and just stands there waiting for us to grab it and pass  it down the long table. he goes ""I have a bunch of pizookies"" glares at us with an angry with the ""I don't like my job look"". I get upset and so does my party. Our server is trying her best to accommodate us but I felt she rushed us and could of gave us a better service but her efforts were there even though there was ALOT of mistakes. But this review is for the food runner. The overall tone was set when he rudely came up to our table. I took matters in my hand and asked for the manager. Great Guy!!! Heard me out and I explained to him our problem and overall experience. He apologize and was able to comp out desert. Overall I wanted to leave the store and let the manager know the situation. Business is based on good service and great food. I thank the manager for the time and hearing us out. One star more just for his accommodation."
Nelle L.,"Monterey Heights, San Francisco, CA",0,108,12,4.0,5/2/2014,Extensive menu. Nice smooth handcrafted beer. Especially favor the hopstorm ipa. Appetizer is Ahi Poke just light  and refreshing. Ahi poke pairs very well with the sante fe spring rolls.  Must try the clam chowder with loads of clam.  Next try the deep dish pizza. Just robust enough.  Overall come in for the hand crafted beers and many tv screens.
Kamal S.,"Mountain View, CA",0,4,1,4.0,6/18/2015,"Aft the hooters today Bjs gave us great feel , wonderful , thanks a lot because aft a long time I saw my bestiesssss  but it's such a great dine today thanks a lot !"
Moss A.,"Napa, CA",9,6,,1.0,5/20/2015,"Hours later, I am still reeling from the pure chaos of this place. I won't even spend any energy explaining what happened, but from the many, many negative reviews I have read hear...stay away..stay far, far away."
Jialy Z.,"Daly City, CA",7,9,1,2.0,4/24/2015,"The food is just OK. But the service here is a joke. Because it's inside the mall, usually pretty busy here and has a long wait. Takes forever to have someone to take your order, and the moment you finish your meal they like to rush you out. If you like to stay longer to watch the game or just chat with your friends, you better order more stuffs. Or they will keep coming to check your bill."
May B.,"Daly City, CA",2,8,1,2.0,5/16/2015,"I am sitting in the restaurant as i type this review. My boy friend and I have been sitting here for 30 minutes now and drinks have not been served and a group of 4 were seated AFTER us and have already placed their orders and received their drinks! If it weren't 11:15pm, we'd leave and find somewhere else to eat but since it's late, we'll have to settle. I understand that they are busy, if that is the case dont seat us at a table and have us wait while we watch others who were seated after us get served."
Brad D.,"Pismo Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/9/2015,"Absolutely the worst place I have ever been. First and foremost, you don't turn away money ever. We were a party of eight eaters and drinkers and they said they can't seat us because it wouldn't be fair to the other small parties. Wtf!!!! Money is money you dumbass fucks!!!! You don't ever turn away a paying customer. Btw, the idiot you have working the checkin station, is the biggest problem. Get your head out of your asses and learn how to run a hospitality business!!!!!"
Elizabeth G.,"El Cerrito, CA",95,163,490,3.0,2/2/2014,My first Time at BJs and i liked it the food was good and service was great. Order the potato skins and Cajun pasta dish  and it was spicy and tasty garlic bread was good. The ice tea was unsweetened and i didn't know it order a tropical Ice tea and it was bitter. was seat by some very loud people had to change booth but waiter was really good.
Tony Y.,"Alameda, CA",46,82,9,3.0,1/30/2014,I have been coming here for years. Nice spot to hang out with your friends and drink. Food is decent.  Service is OK I either come here or goto Hooters when Im in the area and looking for a drink
A b.,"San Francisco, CA",367,31,252,3.0,3/18/2013,"I can only give this place 3 stars.  Everytime I come with my best gf for a catchup sess, its great. Everything is great, no complaints. Everytime I come with my bf, they mess up his order! every single time! Hit or miss!"
Newton K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,10,5,4.0,5/7/2015,"Senior Manager Krystal and General Manager John did a stellar job at turning a negative experience into a positive. For that I am grateful and will return as a customer. Above all, the food was great! Thanks."
Angela S.,"South San Francisco, CA",51,164,115,3.0,3/25/2014,"When a business takes the time to read the reviews and make a comment, it tells me they care and it can change my opinion/feel towards the business. I plan to go back this month thanks to the owners comment. The food is always ok but not astounding. I don't really come here to dine. I come here to meet friends for a drink. My girlfriend and I met up for some appetizers and drinks. We had the following appetizers with the Root Beer drink with alcohol in it: Artichoke - they were ok Fried Calamari - it was just like any other Avocado Egg Rolls - did not look anything like the picture. i've had them before and they were pretty good. these ones were like pink and super spicy. did someone change the recipe to hot egg rolls with hidden avocado and not update the menu? no likey. Chicken Lettuce Wraps - these were the best. They were really good. The drinks were really good...when you could get them. While our waitress was nice she was mostly absent. I don't know if they were super busy (didn't look like it). We literally had to flag our waitress down for more drinks, water, water refills and she was short with us when we ordered dessert. We were both wondering what she was going to bring to the table as we both ordered the same thing and she started to walk away saying ""ok one of each"". We were like wuh?  She didn't make eye contact with us when walking by our table. Thank goodness my friend was loud when she said ""excuse me"". We were there for over two hours. In her defense, we were talking and visiting so I can see why she didn't want to ""bug"" us but it was pretty bad still.  It won't stop us from going back because we do get something out of it but I don't go for service or food really. Just convenience of location, pretty good apps and drinks."
