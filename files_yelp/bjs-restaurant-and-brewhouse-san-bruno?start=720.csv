Raquel Q.,"San Francisco, CA",58,54,61,4.0,3/23/2014,"Went for lunch w a friend and I had the low calorie shrimp tacos plate and a mozzarella ball salad. I love that they offer a low calorie menu for those days you just want to eat lite. Our waiter was great, he was very attentive. We were seated right away. I've been here many times and it's usually a good experience. On warm days I love sitting on the patio which is first come first serve. The bar areas fun too. But crowded. Lotsa TV's and music playing. I like it here."
Brent W.,"South San Francisco, CA",1,5,,5.0,7/3/2015,"This place was really busy and I assumed the service was going to be slow but luckily our server Miguel was extremely attentive and professional.  The food was well prepared and brought out fast, the drinks were never empty.  Great experience!"
Ronnie Q.,"Stonestown, San Francisco, CA",1,6,7,1.0,11/1/2014,"Worst place ever. They tell you one hour, after an hour they tell you at least another half an hour to an hour. Don't ruin your mood just go someplace else!"
Erica A.,"San Francisco, CA",75,7,19,1.0,4/10/2014,"I just checked my reward account. Apparently, Aakash didn't even credit my visit onto my reward card. But, I figured how to add my points manually on their web page."
Jo S.,"San Francisco, CA",43,168,3,4.0,6/27/2013,PAZOOKIE PAZOOKIE PAZOOKIE!!! Who can resist a warm cookie top with ice cream. Soooo GOOD!!!! You can order a personal size or a party size to share. Food is good also. Service is a hit or miss.
V L.,"San Francisco, CA",233,29,13,1.0,3/20/2014,"First time experience at BJ This is not really an impressive experience. The service is extremely slow and somethings they will even forget you was sitting there waiting for the plate. Secondly, the food was just ok. They are over the salty side a little (it may be great for drunky). The salad that I ordered have way too many toritos chip instead of lettuce. It made me wonder am I really eating salad or what. The soda that you can get there is like water, totally not carbonated."
Casey K.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",2,6,,3.0,5/1/2014,"Cons:  - Don't come here hungry. You're gonna be waiting for a while. I've been to this place a few times, and I usually have to wait an average of 10-20 minutes to be seated. - Aside from a few dishes, most of the food is highly processed frozen/pre-made chain food. (Think TGI Fridays but with better beer...) Pros:  - The menu is large... so if you are grabbing some dinner with a group of friends, it's an easy choice. - The staff is always friendly."
Valissa A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/28/2015,This service is ridiculous. I'm writing this as I'm sitting here. Its been 15 min since we've been waiting for a refill and our server has just been chatting away with the people at the next table. The steak was very dry even though we asked for medium. We will not be returning
Infodiva B.,"San Francisco, CA",1888,750,590,3.0,12/7/2014,"I am trying to like this place as I don't have many alternatives in this neck of the woods. I like beer and the brew a nice selection and there is a full bar. I have tried two types of pizza, a variety of beers, appetizers and I feel the food is lacking and too salty or no taste at all."
James C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,164,3,2.0,4/29/2015,"Whenever I ate here, the staff looked tired and over-worked.  As a result, the service was subpar.  Don't be surprised if they mess your order up."
Pablo J.,"San Francisco, CA",38,41,,5.0,7/17/2015,"Everything, from the appetizers to the main course was fresh and delicious. I tried the cherry glazed salmon and loved it. Nicky, our waitress, was excellent!"
LuLu M.,"San Jose, CA",554,515,115,5.0,10/27/2013,"I don't remember much about the food to be honest with you, but I do remember getting the best service I've had in years - not just good, but over and above what this guy was required to do and it made our day to be served by him. So Derrick, in the bar, thank you again for the stellar service. I hope you enjoyed the big tip and that we pulled the manager aside to let him know you deserved a raise and promotion!  And just kidding, the Asian sesame salad was delicious by the way!"
Vanita N.,"Daly City, CA",0,8,10,1.0,3/4/2016,The service sucks most of the waitress disappears for 30 to 45 minutes they all go to the back and food comes after 30 to 1 hour after ordering..not worth it
Jason S.,"South San Francisco, CA",54,79,18,2.0,3/17/2013,"Wa-womp- I went here with some work friends. even though we mentioned to our server that we had a movie to catch in 1hr, the pizza I ordered didn't get to me until 45 min after I ordered. After we paid the bill. The lesson here is to not go to BJ's if you are in a rush. Which is a shame since it is so close to sfo and is walking distance to a movie theatre. It wasn't a total loss. The server let us have happy hour prices for beer and mini pizzas (aka the one I didn't get until after we paid) even though we were there at 11am and the happy hour menu clearly stated the first wave for discounts was at 3pm.  Plus the guy was nice. By the way the server apologized for the pizza coming in late. The reason was because my mini pizza went to another table somehow and they had to cook (reheat?? idk!) a new one in the kitchen for me... In any case I may find myself coming here more anyway since we do a lot of shift dinners from here and I'm a sucker for their pizzas no matter how crap the punctuality and prioritization of the general service is."
Wine Advocate A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/23/2014,"Food is great with vast selection of beer and wine.  Their happy hour is seriously unbeatable with the best value, and yes, tasty! Only problem is that the service is too slow.  Extremely slow.  The staff is friendly and I don't understand how they keep a smile when there are so many people complaining about the slow service (like me).  Kudos to them for a great attitude. Definitely a nice place to hang, if you're not in a terrible hurry. TIP:  You must try the Cheeseburger pizza.  It's a concoction of Pizza & Cheese burger - Amazzz.  But you do need to walk a mile or two after."
Ayana K.,"San Francisco, CA",546,246,66,3.0,8/19/2013,Late Night Drinks and food with the BF. WE got 2 Wildberry Mojito's which were really good. Our server also threw in a Watermelon Mojito which was even better.  Angus Sliders w/ cheddar cheese & bacon...Tasty Chicken Pot Stickers... I've had better Boneless Wings... kinda bland.. Balsamic glazed chicken... Tasty
Tina A.,"San Francisco, CA",2,59,8,4.0,9/19/2013,"I should start by saying I've only had takeout before and usually my husband picks it up. It seems like most people have a problem with the bad service at this place, but this review is only based on the food.  I've had their pizza, crispy chicken sandwich, pot roast, and a variety of their appetizers. The crispy chicken sandwich is DELICIOUS! It's pretty big (for me), so I usually eat it for 2 meals, and it heats up nicely. I wasn't a fan of their thin, crispy fries (might be because they got soggy since we did takeout), but the wedge fries are decent. Overall, I think the food is above average. There have been a few appetizers that I didn't care for like the wontons, but most things I've had here, I have liked. This is our go-to place if we work late and don't have time to prepare dinner."
Char N.,"Portland, OR",27,15,1,5.0,3/10/2014,"I love BJ's. It is what it is, which is a restaurant in a mall, so it is inevitably busy during rush hours and full of people I'd rather have nothing to do with, but for what it is, I adore it. I visit San Bruno frequently, and I eat at BJ's every time, because it is close to where I stay. And there are four great things going for this restaurant: -Despite being busy and having a large staff, a few members always recognize me and have a few words to say. (Chris is one waiter who always stops for a word, since I met him on his first shift.) -They have a large selection of good, imported beers, which I like, since I am a fan of Belgian-style beers--saisons and trips, etc. -Whenever they have been out of a bottled beer I have ordered, a manager comes to apologize and is more than eager to make sure I'm %110 happy. -The tortilla soup, oh my god, the tortilla soup. I could eat it every day and still crave it. Over all, this is a great place to eat, if you realize it is a high-volume, busy establishment during peak hours for lunch and dinner. I work in the industry so I get it and I am not annoyed when I have to wait, especially because the staff is seemingly so genuinely friendly, and will remember you and what you like."
Jasmine M.,"San Francisco, CA",11,1,,2.0,4/21/2015,"Carlos sucks ass as a waiter and did from the beginning. It wasn't as busy for a Tuesday and he took long to bring our waters and walked around like he had a stick up his ass and gave me attitude when I asked him to bring us another bottle of ketchup. First of all, why would you bring an empty bottle of ketchup to a table? He lagged and was full of attitude. I was not happy with the service at all. Only left him $8 for a $120 bill. He didn't even deserve a tip. Do your job right dude and or at least fake it to get through your night. Food was good, service was awful. We even had to approach another waiter to bring us what we wanted because we needed to remind Carlos 3 times to do so."
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,1.0,12/23/2014,"DO NOT.. AND I REPEAT DO NOT EAT HERE! This has to to be one of the WORST Bjs experiences that I have ever had in my entire life of eating at plenty Bjs in many different cities! I have never in my life felt so disrespected and just unwelcomed at any restaurant until now. Upon arriving we were seated and told we would be helped right away. Well our definition and their definition of ""right away"" clearly is different! The fact of the matter is they weren't even that busy.. I then had a question about happy hour and so the waitress said oh yeah it's in the bar area! No keep in mind prior to my party moving over to the bar area we were unaware of the fact that it's not offered on Saturdays! Why would the waitress tell us this before we moved over there and made a fool of ourselves asking for items off the happy hour menu? Things just went downhill from there because once we got another waitress about 15 minutes later she then comes over and takes our order and recommends the worse pizza ever! It came out so dry and barely and cheese or sauce! I wasn't going to pay for this $20 supposedly signature deep dish pizza that I couldn't bought in the frozen foods section ion and got an even better quality! Well once we decided we would like to switch the pizza our waitress was no where to be found and then  we saw her walk over to what must be their ""clock out"" station with food in her hand ready to go home! Completely unprofessional because what most professional and accredited restaurants do is smoothly transition the new waiter or waitress to the customer. To add insult to injury my birthday happen to be this night and my friend communicated this to this waitress and do you think she cared enough to pass this information onto the next waiter? Absolutely not! Well this wasn't the case at all. Our new waiter Jeremy had to be one of the worse waiters I've ever experienced too! He had a very nonchalant attitude about our complaints and when my friend got up to complain to the manger she seemed just as unsympathetic about the situation as her staff and that's exactly why I believe they behave the way they do because management itself just doesn't care! My advice is if your unhappy with your job then QUIT! Maybe somebody will read these reviews and actually care from the upper management or maybe we should get the corporate contact number and have them be aware of how this place is being ran because I'm sure it's far from the standards that BJs implements for its staff! Completely disgusted!"
