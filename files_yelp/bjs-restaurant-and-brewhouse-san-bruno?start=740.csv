Jenny H.,"San Francisco, CA",147,10,,1.0,8/4/2014,"Bad experience overall, nasty food and horrible service. My server was Delene. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta and it was soggy and too lemony. I asked my server if the pasta was supposed to be soggy and soft and she's like no it's supposed to be al dente and I told her it was not and she was like ""oh I'm sorry"" and walked away. Never coming back here again!"
Jackie M.,"San Bruno, CA",0,21,,4.0,7/9/2015,"Love the food, love the drinks, love the fire pit and happy hour. Not giving 5 stars because for some god awful reason the women's bathroom has stunk like a sewer for months. I cannot breath at times. Probably not their fault and haven't gone in a month. Hopefully its better."
Diane C.,"Brookings, OR",3,503,5,3.0,12/9/2014,"hubby ordered chili, which came out immediately. he said it was good, but not as good as the last time we were there. about 10 minutes later, my quesadilla and his side of fries were delivered. needless to say, we should have been served at the same time, and there was no reason for his chili to be served from the pot so early.   my quesadilla was alright - mostly tortilla - with a a few pieces of cubed chicken. one of the quesadilla quarters had one small chunk of chicken. accompanying the quesadiilla was a very small bowl of black bean soup. i had to ask for a spoon - a bit difficult to eat with a long-tined fork. i had to ask for what seemed to me an obvious refill of a soda glass - lying empty at the table's edge.  rodolfo was our server, friendly, easy to talk to, but had to be nudged for the refill."
Ellie D.,"San Francisco, CA",9,39,2,1.0,7/20/2014,"If you're trying to place an order over the phone, calls are routed to a call center! Whoa! I learned this for the first time after I was placed on hold for 15 minutes by Jake from State Farm errrr BJs Call Center! Customer service at this location has been declining over the years - I've had a number of not-so-great experiences here and it doesn't seem like management cares to up their game. While I did get a small apology from their manager, Brandy, it was more of a forced apology rather than a genuine one. So I'm writing this review as I'm waiting another 45 minutes on top of my promised pick-up time for my order and I'm wondering what the hold up is to pop out 2 pizzas from the oven. There's another guy waiting next to me who's been waiting for over 30 minutes for his order, too. After 30 minutes, I overhear the staff saying there's a problem with my order, something about the cooks not seeing online orders on their end, so obviously that meant my order hadn't even been started yet at that point. I contemplated walking out but I had already stood there for over 30 minutes.  If you read my other Yelp reviews, I'm a very reasonable person. I don't write negative reviews just because an employee was rude or just because my food didn't come out as expected. But this review is a result of cumulative wtf experiences here. And management doesn't care to improve. If this was a dine-in order, there is absolutely no way someone would wait 45 minutes for a pizza. So it is absolutely unreasonable for a take-out order to take 1 hour for 2 pizzas when typically, as I was told, take-out orders are ready in 15 - 20 minutes. And although Brandy heavily discounted my order, she seemed hesitant to do so and quickly walked away after giving me my receipt without any explanation as to the reason for the long wait.  My other experiences at this location were just as ridiculous. I remember a few years ago when I had a newborn and BJs just started brunch hours (10am I think?). My family and I were there right as they opened and I politely asked if I could be seated somewhere where I could keep my stroller next to me (as I had a baby sleeping inside), and the server looked around the entire restaurant and said ... NO, sorry, we don't have any seats available where you can keep your stroller. What the?! I looked around the entire empty restaurant, as we were the first ones there at 10am, and explained that my newborn was sleeping and being that the restaurant was practically EMPTY, could we just sit in a corner or anywhere for a quick brunch as I had not been out of the house in months (newborn, remember) and she just looked confused and explained that strollers have to be stowed in the front and blah blah blah, I stopped listening and wanted to strangle this b*tch who did not understand how parents of newborns were lacking on sleep and super exhausted and how much effort it took just to get dressed and get a baby out of the house. Excuse the language, it was like de ja vu all over again. In the end, a manager came out and apologized profusely and explained the fire hazard with a stroller blocking a walkway, but offered to let us sit at any corner table or against the wall or somewhere in the back, and practically begged us to stay as we were getting ready to walk away, but I was too upset at that point. And there was this one time we sat and waited 30 minutes at a booth at the bar and the servers were pointing fingers at each other about who was supposed to be taking care of our table. And another time during lunch when we all ordered from the lunch menu or the soup/salad combo and were charged full meals for each item and the server said, ""Oh, I didn't realize you wanted a lunch portion."" But I clearly said, we were all ordering from the lunch menu. And then that started a train of confused servers who were bringing out our meals and then taking them back so that it was a smaller lunch portion. My favorite is when they bring you someone else's order and when you tell them that's not what you ordered, they get upset like it's our fault they're holding 3 dishes in their arms and they don't know where to go. The 1-star is for Vicki, who was incredibly professional handling take-out orders. I would actually give her 5 stars for the way she handled everything. Not once did she roll her eyes or even give me the slightest bit of attitude whenever I came up to ask her how much longer my order would be. She was calm and apologetic, and told me she completely understood why I was so frustrated. She seemed more pulled together than their manager and the other employees. This was probably an off night for take-out orders because I watched her apologize to every single person for the delay with their take-out order, but nevertheless, she was professional. I'm glad to see people like her at the front lines handling all that stress."
Angie L.,"San Bruno, CA",26,54,71,4.0,3/3/2015,"Their food is great! And great place to meet your friends  for Happy Hour! Only Con: They take no reservations, but you can call two hours in advance to be put on the waiting list, so when you get there you don't have to wait so long. Parking can be a nightmare here, only because it's part of Tanforan Mall...so if it's busy with weekend (or holiday) shoppers, parking can be kind of difficult."
Soul G.,"San Bruno, CA",8,23,,1.0,5/10/2014,"This BJ is the worst I have ever had and I have never had a bad one in my entire life!! If you don't care about service, ambiance, hot food or your precious time that is constantly leaking from its unknown reservoir, this is the eatery for you! When I walked in the music was shouting out of the speakers, fighting for attention with the hockey game and it's witty announcers.  As I was speaking with the hostess she seemed to be slowly falling asleep so I tapped the counter to wake her up. After some tapping she came around and gave me a buzzer which would notify me when my table was ready for my lovely bride and I to feast on some BJ pizza pie!! 45 minutes later we were seated, 10 minutes later our waiter came by, he was completely stoned on some of Northern California's finest marijuana, we ordered two cocktails which we never received. During our time at the table, we were offered several different dishes that we did not order because we had not ordered yet ! Our waiter came by and asked us if there was anything else we needed, I started laughing so hard I almost woke up the hostess! After he took our order he came by and informed us he was leaving and that another waiter would be waiting on us. Turns out we were the ones waiting. Food came out wrong, cold and long after my hunger pangs left me lost in the glow of shit pop music and dim witted unkempt servers. We left and walked across El Camino Real to Jack's restaurant where the nightmare pressed on. ""Once more into the breech dear friends"""
Regine L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,1,1.0,9/10/2016,"Terrible Experience. TRISTAN WAS TERRIBLE. We came in on a slow day around 3 PM. We were sat at the balcony section and was approached by our server. He came and did not introduce himself, but instead said ""want somethin' to drink? Ready for your order? Or did you just sit down?"" All in one breath. Luckily, we're regular comers so we knew what we wanted. I ordered strawberry mojito and my friend ordered a strawberry margarita. The strawberry mojito had no alcohol taste but had plenty of soda. I asked for a different drink and it still tasted more as a soda than an alcoholic drink. As for the appetizer, we ordered a lettuce wrap that came with a half-ass presentation of sloppiness. Then he asked if we wanted plates to go with that. Why would you ask if we want plates?! YES WE WANT PLATES. LET ME EAT OFF THE DAMN TABLE. To make matters worse, we also had to ask for silverware and napkins, since he didn't give us any. Waited an average of 30 min for our appetizers. Not once did he check up on how the replacement drink was nor the appetizers. For entrees, I ordered a cherry chipotle glazed salmon and my friend ordered a burger. Waited another 40 min. Total wait was more than an hour. Once again, the server did not check up on how our meal was. Our server name was Tristan. DO NOT GET HIM. Oh and he had the audacity to run out and yell if we payed. Ummm.. Do you want to see my receipt?"
Dylan V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/25/2016,"I would think that coming to this BJs would improve, but they always fail in service, food quality, and wait. I ordered food and it took 20 minutes longer than everybody else. And as soon as i got my food they didn't even have the whole meal ready. They had to give my fries later and that additionally took another 15 minutes when i was already almost done with my food. This BJs just sucks in general and id rather go to the food court then pay for this over priced shitty food. Additionally, out waiter Matt just sucks as a waiter. He didn't give any refills on water or soda through our whole stay, and didn't even to check how our shitty food was. If you get Matt prepare yourself for some shitty service."
Larry D.,"Isla Vista, CA",4,7,1,1.0,8/14/2014,We must be invisible because our server never gave us any service. What a waste of fucking time. Oh and the food is salty.
Joyce E.,"Daly City, CA",138,1014,2098,4.0,2/27/2012,"I really don't have anything to complain about except the wait! The wait usually averages to be about 1 hour-1.5 hours depending on the time, day, and amount of people in your party. Good food, decent prices, amazing service, and amazing rootbeer and pizzookies! Definitely better than the Cheesecake Factory!  P.S. Our last waiter was Samir and he was awesome despite the amount of tables he had to serve that night. Excellent service!"
Jerome B.,"Alexandria, VA",43,89,11,1.0,7/27/2013,"Good god!  This when I was here with my wife, I was immediately assaulted with the reek of weed. And although I try to be pretty accepting of today's youth - this place was over-ridden with a bunch of young gang bangers (infested seemed too strong a word, yet strangely appropriate).   To top it off - the service here sucked, and the drinks are suspect (would suspect that if inspectors came with a hydrometer - they would lose their licence).   Been to other BJs - was expecting at least a standard equal to those... but this place seemed hell bent on lowering the bar.  Kudos team - mission accomplished."
Dave S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,128,4,2.0,3/14/2013,"We stopped by here last Sunday for a quick lunch on our way up to the city, and were not impressed.  We all decided on different versions of the pizza and salad combo, and while they were tasty, there were only about 9 bites worth of pizza (and those would have been small bites).  The prices seemed really high for such small servings, but I guess they do have to pay their massive staff.  I didn't count them, but it seemed like they had waaayyyy too many people waiting on the customers (the place was only about 20% full).  The staff was attentive- too attentive- they kept asking if we wanted drink refills, even when the glasses weren't even half empty. One last note to the wait staff-  if you want to tell your co-workers about the itchy red blotches and pimples on your legs, please do it somewhere besides the dining room...    Yeah, we heard the whole story! I won't be going back."

Vilma C.,"San Francisco, CA",21,21,10,1.0,8/14/2014,"I really hope that the management is reading this...  I went to Bjs yesterday dinner time around 6:15 Wednesday aug 13 and the hostess who helped us was ok, she quoted us 20-30 mins so we waited. After 45 mins of waiting I checked up on how longer was going to be, she told us we were next and three parties went ahead of us. I was patient so they finally seat us. Moving on, the waitress who served us was TERRIBLE! We had to wait over 40 mins for our food and when we finally got our food my party and I had to ask for napkins and silverware! They never refilled our waters and when I asked one of the runner guys if I can have hot salsa, joking he told ""NO"" now I wanted to go nuts on his ass but i remain on my seat. I didn't tip for crap! Bad service and I recommend everyone to go somewhere ELSE!!! Do not waste your money or time!!! And who ever is the CEO I will recommend  to fire the management cause it obviously isn't teaching the servers any customer service skills!  Thank you!"
Vanessa K.,"East Bay, CA",130,1017,485,1.0,10/8/2011,"HORRIBLE!!! I've never had a bad experience with any BJ's, with the exception of this location. I shall NEVER return: -food is COLD -pizza is doughy, and did not cook long enough in the oven -waiter spilled water all over us, and all we got was a simple apology -chicken fried steak was cold and dry All of it was atrocious. Worse $78 meal ever."
Briana W.,"Oakland, CA",111,241,93,3.0,9/12/2014,"Food was good! Sat in the bar area to avoid waiting 30 min for a table. It was pretty packed because there was a baseball game on. Our waiter was not very attentive, and noticed other waiters having problems too. Anyways I ordered the bacon cheese burger and it was delicious. I had the house Cabernet and in retrospect should of ordered a beer to go with my meal. My colleague wasn't happy with the service at all. The guy was young and could tell was a little distracted. Oh well, still enjoyed my meal."
Maria S.,"Brisbane, CA",367,634,1931,3.0,10/1/2011,"Places like BJ's makes me feel old.  Ok, I am old, but that's besides the point.  Probably if I was 10-15 years younger I would love hanging out here with friends after work or on the weekend to share some brews and appetizers while catching games on the multiple flatscreens throughout the place.  But alas, (do only old people use the word alas?) I come here rarely when the family needs a bite to eat and we can't decide on anywhere else.   For me, it's your standard menu, thought I do like the mini appetizers and can just order a bunch of those to nosh on.  The place is definitely loud, which again, reminds me that I'm old and too sensitive to grey noise now.  Service is ok, nothing over the top and nothing that would piss me off, so that's a good thing.  Only caution I would give on going here is that their service for large groups can be slow if you aren't doing a buffet thing.  I've gone with co-workers here for lunch a few times and each one had us late getting back.  If it's a small group, then you should be fine.  Cheers!"
Natalia K.,"San Francisco, CA",458,181,52,3.0,9/24/2014,"I love BJ's Restaurants for their consistently great food and outstanding brews. Also, they have great lunch specials that are a total deal, like the unlimited soup and salad for only $7.95 (you can change up the soup and salad with each order). For the beers the Jeremiah Red is my favorite, as is the Berryburst Cider (also good as a half and half ""JerryBurst""). My only complaint is that the service here is SO slow. Everyone is friendly, but I every time I have come to this location I have had to wait extremely long for the food to arrive. One time it took 55 minutes after ordering my meal at lunch time to receive my food, and my sandwich was cold while my friend's food was hot. This location obviously needs more food runners or something because waiting 20+ min to receive any food (such as apps) is just too long at lunchtime."
Lila S.,"Daly City, CA",0,17,,5.0,5/17/2015,"My husband and I came here for dinner last night and it was great. Al was our waiter and he provided us with outstanding service. He is personable, charismatic and attentive. He has a great sense of humor and is the type of waiter that makes you want to come back. Thanks again Al we will see you soon!"
Janice V.,"San Francisco, CA",369,600,798,4.0,3/20/2011,"I've been here a couples of time already to have dinner with my boyfriend or out with friends. I came here for my boyfriend's birthday and we had a big party. I called the day before to make a reservation but they said they weren't able to take reservations after 5:30pm. My boyfriend and I decided to come really early around 5pm since we were planning on having the dinner around 7ish to ask if we can reserve a spot. I guess all that wait was worth it because we were able to get a spot despite of how pack the restaurant was at that time.  The waitress that we had was really nice and very attentive. She really wanted us to have a really great experience at BJ's which she did. This restaurant is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the area probably cause I'm able to watch sports here, haha. Their pazookie is my favorite dessert ever. I tried to make my own pazookie at home but it doesn't taste the same as the one here which is why one time I was craving it so bad that I got it to go, lol."
