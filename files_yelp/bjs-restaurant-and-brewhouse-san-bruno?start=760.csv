Catheria S.,"San Francisco, CA",239,65,8,1.0,6/11/2013,"Came here for my birthday to get the free pizookie (no shame). We sat in the bar for the happy hour menu. The drinks took 10 minutes to arrive and the HH food (such small portions they may as well be appetizers) took 45 minutes to reach our table. Oh, and the angus sliders plate looked cluttered with random scraps of lettuce falling off the edge of the plate. Not to mention another 20 minutes for the check. Lunch ended up being 2 hours long. Luckily for Steven the server, it was my birthday so I wasn't in a complaining mood."
M D.,"San Francisco, CA",12,91,980,3.0,6/18/2011,"If you can get a seat at the bar, the Happy Hour selection and deals are great.  A lot of groups meet here for all occasions.  TVs all around which makes watching sports even better. I do love their food and the huge selection.  Same goes for cocktails, beers and desserts. The service is iffy, I've gotten both excellent and crappy service as many times as I've been here.  I can't stand the wait for a table though, it's always longer than what they tell you!"
Lisa K.,"San Mateo, CA",0,5,,4.0,9/9/2016,"Stopped in to pick up some food to go with my 92 year old mom on the way back from Kaiser. Of course, she was tired (she's 92!), so when the guy who took our order said 20-25 minutes, she said that was fine, she wanted some books from Barnes and Noble anyway. I set my phone timer for 25 minutes, and when it went off, checked out of the book store and headed back (making it 30 minutes). I was told it would be another 15 minutes or so. I told the guy we weren't going to wait, just give me a refund. So the manager comes over and said ""You asked for a manager?"" and I told him no, I just want my money back and be on my way, we can't wait any longer. He apologized sincerely, refunded my money, and asked if I could wait ONE more minute. I did, and our food was brought out and given to us free of charge. I honestly wasn't expecting a free meal, I was just incensed with the poor service. This has happened before at this BJ's with my daughter, and she told me to not leave a tip. I left a tip because I believe it is not the fault of the servers, but is due to poor management and training. The manager that took care of me today was new, and said he was aware of the problem, and was working on it.  He handled my situation impeccably! I walked away from there happy and delighted instead of upset and thinking I would never go there again. This new manager is going to get BJ's 5 star ratings! Thank you"
Anthony D.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/27/2015,Liked the pizookie! Waited a little longer for our food. Server is attentive  & courteous
Carla F.,"Millbrae, CA",492,360,940,4.0,2/14/2011,"I love coming to BJ's, when I am craving a good hearty meal. The meatloaf is off the hook, I wouldn't say its better than mine but for sure it's good. The flavors are all there and the mash potatoes compliment the meat loaf. I've also had the New York Steak with a loaded baked potato, this is by far my favorite!! You must come with a big appetite cause the steak is a good size and the baked potato it's huge (especially with all the fixings!). I love their potato skins!! I love all their beer except for the Totonka!!  Too Dark for me but my husband loves it!!!"
Adam X.,"San Francisco, CA",381,451,1609,3.0,11/15/2010,"Never had a more doughy pizza. Its like they believe the bread (deep dish is not bready, its buttery and crisp), makes up for the lack of authenticity. It doesn't. They do have nice beers. 2 stars for the Beer selection... -3 for purporting to be Chicago Pizza. +1 for a great looking pizza however. (Photo in the Gallery) You have a great kitchen, I'm sure you can produce a real pizza. what you served me was not a real pizza, it was like kids food. Here is a comparison you might get: A great kids movie appeals to both kids and adults (i.e. Shrek); a good/great meal that is for all ages should do the same."
Julian B.,"Belmont, CA",3,41,6,5.0,5/20/2015,This place has really good food. All of there dishes are really on point. Especially the deep dish pizza. You just can't find to many restaurants like this anymore. Awesome awesome.
Cathy N.,"San Francisco, CA",99,98,32,3.0,12/4/2014,Their food is average. Nothing to die for. I only come here when I'm at the mall and have absolutely no where else to eat. Their pizzas are pretty good though and the only thing i'm really obsessed with is their pizookie.
Jana L.,"Millbrae, CA",1,10,,2.0,4/21/2015,Waited 1/2 hour before food was served.and they didn't get us out appetizer. One dinner did not get the avocado as requested.  Had to ask for water a lot. Waiter seems very new and apologized for the kitchen forgetting the order.  But the bacon burger was good. Mediterranean taco was good. Fish n chips at good. Just the wait and perfection of the dishes and orders need wotk
Rebecca M.,"San Francisco, CA",12,52,16,3.0,12/21/2014,"Watched part of the niner game at Bj's last night. they seem to always be pretty busy but I got a seat at the bar section right away.  Ordered chicken wings I bit into one and it was ice cold in the middle. Told the server and they replaced it, thankfully I did not get sick. I ordered chicken tortilla soup and wedge salad combo both were very good. My boyfriends steak was also good. Atmosphere is nice."
Tim F.,"Millbrae, CA",5,53,,4.0,2/20/2015,"Located inside Tanforan, this is a really convenient BJs as there's always a wait, but at least there's a mall to walk around. The food is typical Pub food and I like the pizzas. Wings are great too"
Jesse S.,"Daly City, CA",265,350,471,2.0,3/28/2013,"For a mall place during lunch time. The service should have been better. seated in a couple of minutes, (Lot's of open tables and servers present ). Ordered , appetizer came. ate all of it, food came out slow , table next to up seated after us got their food first. Didn't order anything special. food came out warm. So,  if you can the food court is better."
S Y.,"San Francisco, CA",285,387,5880,1.0,9/23/2010,"BJ's does not like me haha! To summarize my past experiences here; sipping my drink through a straw, I look down and a lipstick stain on my glass... barf.  With a group of people, an hour wait for our food and my Scampi Pasta comes out topped with bread crumbs- NO sauce... WTF?! Ordered the Calamari appetizer and was served with no dipping sauce, they ended up being out of it and offered ketchup or ranch... GROSS! BJ's solution to these issues... FREE PIZOOKIE! woopty doo... So it was a nice day and since I had to do a few errands in San Bruno, BJ's outdoor seating sounded good at the time. Our waiter, Billy (name on the receipt) was nice, but very busy. Ordered a Hefeweizen for the bf and a Peach Mojito for myself. A different waiter comes by and places a glass of beer on our table that is not Hefeweizen and walks away before we can even mention it. We tell Billy and he said he'll check on our drinks and to keep it. 15 minutes later, another waiter comes by finally and hands me my Peach Mojito, then looks at my bf- looks at the beer in front of him and offers the Hef. As we start to explain we were given the wrong beer earlier, he makes a face and tells my bf, ""that's not a Hefeweizen but you drank it anyways?"" Let me just say this before I go on, my bf is very well mannered, very laid back-and woulda let that comment slide. Me, I can be, but not when I'm spoken to like that. So I looked at this crazy waiter and said, ""Excuse me, but we have been sitting here for 20 minutes without our drinks, in the sun- you're damn right we drank from it. But since you've finally decided to bring our drinks-TAKE IT!"" And this waiter really did take it. Ridiculous. We get our pizza. I take a slice out of the deep dish pan and put it on on my plate. I touch it, and it felt cold. I touch the slice everywhere, hoping it was just the tomato or something- everything wasn't even warm to the touch. I touch the pan thinking that at least has gotta be hot. Nope. At this point, I just grab the pan with my bare hands. WTF? A deep dish pizza that was just served I can hold with my bare hands. What is wrong with this picture? I walk inside, pan in hand and a waitress asks me if she could help me. I told her to have our waiter take it off my bill. Our waiter comes by and apologizes and asks if I want anything else, but why would I? To prove our waiter was sincere in his apologies he spoke to his manager. The manager came out to apologize and handed me a $15 gift card. Overall, if I was starving I woulda been a straight B****! But I came with the intentions of chillin' in the sun, having a drink and pizza- all I ask for is my pizza to be hot and for the drink waiter- DO NOT GIVE ME ATTITUDE! Who wants this damn $15 card? Cause I sure as hell ain't gonna use it!"
Frances A.,"San Francisco, CA",28,10,4,1.0,3/12/2015,"I'm so fed up with Bjs service. I'm never one to complain but tonight just tops it. Server was in such a hurry. Took our orders, and left. Entrees came before appetizer. Waiter/server never came back to check on us nor refill our drinks. He was checking out every single table around us, but us! Are you kidding me? I literally had to ask the hostess for out check! Seriously don't think of ever coming back because of tonight!"
Lisa N.,"San Francisco, CA",44,455,52,2.0,4/25/2013,"bartender was ridiculously rude.  waitress seemed overwhelmed. she had to be flagged down several times for the same things.  what is alll the rave about? pizookie is just a flat brownie?! what the hell For some reason I was under the impression that a pizookie was some sort of amazing dessert. (when we got it, i was so disappointed when I realized I could easily make it myself. -_-) perhaps I'll come back for happy hour, seems then is when its more worth it."
Mai W.,"San Francisco, CA",480,123,365,3.0,8/24/2011,"Create your own Ahi Tuna Salad at $11 instead of $12.95 1. Go during LUNCH 2. Order Unlimited Soup and Salad Combo. (Get the house salad w/ vinaigrette) 3. Order Seared Ahi Tuna from the Small Bites section Some friends and I went here for lunch and were all craving Ahi Tuna Salads. One friend ordered the real deal and two of us created our own combo. After the comparison, our own creation was way more worth it. We even had soup.  The staff was great till the very end. We kept asking for a box was ignored."
Larry L.,"Oakland, CA",37,145,17,3.0,7/28/2014,Convenient place to go to for happy hour. The food selection for HH is limited but I won't go hungry at least.  Clean place.  Service is on the slow side.
Tara T.,"San Pablo, CA",107,48,31,5.0,1/8/2015,"Went here with co workers , we had a new server tyler. He was awesome the food was great I also had the macaroni and cheese it was so good . Tyler was great he kept making sure we all had what we needed, and was super patient when all 17 of us has to split the bill ! Thanks for the great service tyler !"
Sheryel C.,"San Mateo, CA",4,7,,5.0,2/20/2016,"Probably the best experience I have ever had coming in here thanks to our wonderful server Fadi. The wait wasn't to bad for a friday night first off. After getting seated, literally the sweetest server ever, recommend soups to start our meal off, brought them out right away. Took our order, I had the fish tacos(asked if I wanted them grilled or fried!!) my brother had the chicken club sandwich. This is where it got a little iffy, we don't eat bacon, and the sandwich came out with bacon, BUT after pointing it out to Fadi, he took it right back to the kitchen and brought us out a new one without the bacon of course. After dinner we didn't have room for dessert but as an apology, Fadi brought us out a chocolate chip pazookie(my favorite). I would have to say, literally the best experience I have ever had here thanks to Fadi! Will defiantly request him to be my server next time I come in!"
Mat T.,"Daly City, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/30/2014,"The outside of this restaurant looks very promising however the food is below average, IN-and-Out is 5x better. Sucks.."
