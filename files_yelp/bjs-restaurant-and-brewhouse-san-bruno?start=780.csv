Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",71,128,39,2.0,7/22/2014,"Went here for the first time with my family today. We got calamari appetizer, full rack of bbq ribs, salmon dinner, and shrimp scampi pasta. The calamari was great. Very crunchy and decent sized. The bbq ribs were nothing special. Salmon dinner smelled really burnt and was the size of my palm. Shrimp scampi was the most disappointing of all. I looked at it and knew it wasn't going to be good and i was right. It was flavorless. Everything looks better pictured in the menu. The shrimp scampi, ribs, and salmon dinner from elephant bar are 10x better than this place's. Service was ok. Bill came out to be $75 not including tips. Extremely overpriced for the poor quality food. Will not be returning."
Jessica H.,"Healdsburg, CA",1,12,6,2.0,2/24/2015,Went here today for my son's birthday and it was not good. The appetizers were the best thing we had oh and the water...lol. My house steak was burnt the broccoli was dry and my soup was cold. My son enjoyed his jalapeño burger. The waiter was very rude and unprofessional. Kept calling me lady...smh. We asked for a glass of water with no ice and was given a cup of HOT WATER!!! Probably won't return again for dinner only appetizers...oh forgot to add the strawberry mojito was GROSS!!!!!
Esther Y.,"Emeryville, CA",611,1589,1568,4.0,6/20/2011,"Great service, great consistent BJ's food and drinks. My only complaints are about the patio, which I understand BJ's can't really do much about...if you're sitting outside on the patio, the planes flying overhead from SFO are deafening! It can also get pretty windy and cold out on the patio, and the outdoor heaters aren't too effective against the wind. Thankfully, the patio does have clear walls that help retain the heat just a bit. Anyways, onto the food! I absolutely loved the angel hair pasta dish, and the flatbreads are good too. You can't go wrong with the signature deep dish pizzas, and remember to get their infamous pazookie (giant freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top!) for dessert. Good selection of beers (I'm no expert in that area) and cocktails, and the mojitos are delicious!"
Kevin C.,"Hingham, MA",10,46,,2.0,11/14/2013,"I heard this chain was good and thought I'd check it out for lunch.  Boy was I disappointed.  I wanted to eat somewhat light, so I didn't go with the pizza or burger, which was probably my  mistake.  That's their signature items.  They have a large menu, which is a big mistake for a chain like this I think.  They should stick to what they do well. I got a side salad....it was mostly white iceberg lettuce, very little green, and what was green was very light green.  Then the shrimp tacos.  The tacos were decent, but it came with tortilla chips, a small ramekin of salsa and one of a creamy avacado sauce.  Well the chips were greasy, which was unappetizing.  We all know chips are made by deep frying but they don't usually come out and stay shiny and wet with grease.  Then the ramekins were so small, you couldn't dip your chip into the salsa or sauce.  That defeats the use of chips.  Just dumb decision by the restaurant.  Service was good (I ate at the bar).   I didn't try the beer, but maybe that would be their saving grace."
Kevin L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,14,,1.0,8/26/2014,"I walked in myself into the bar yesterday around 4:00 intending to order a few of their happy hour specials.  I sat there for more than 10 minutes without anyone so much as saying a word to me.  No ""Hi, I'll be with you in a second"" or not even a ""Hello"".  I walked out trying to figure out why no one greeted me.  Was it because I was dressed in a suit?  Did I intimidate the staff too much?  Was it because I smelled?  Because I remember taking a shower.  Was it because I was by myself and maybe I looked like I wasn't going to order a lot of food?  Whatever the reason, if you don't want my business, I was glad to take my money elsewhere, thank you very much."
Vivian T.,"Redwood City, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/31/2016,"Just ate here with my family. Miguel served us and he was the best! Very attentive and made sure we have everything we needed. If you ever eat here, definitely ask for him by name."
Juvy G.,"Burlingame, CA",135,38,30,2.0,8/7/2012,"Visited on Saturday around 5pm. Normal dining.  Got sat really quick, no wait. Server, Donia, was friendly.  However, food took 45 minutes to arrive. Server kept saying the food would come out soon but it never did. She said she let the manager know already, but it seemed like the manager didn't do anything about it since it was 30 minutes ago since she told him and the food was still not out. I could have understood if the place was busy-- but it wasnt. Then when my food came out, it was incomplete. But she insisted that everything was there. But when i looked around-- the vegetables were missing. So i asked for the manager-- which took 15 minutes. When the manager, Spencer, came out, he said, ""So I understand your food took too long to come out? Just for future references-- it should not take more than 8-10 minutes for a steak salad."" He then apologized but just took my plate away. He made sure i didnt think the server forgot to ring in my food--but the way he said it made it seem like he was covering for her.  OKAY SIR. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.. you and your staff should take note of that and you should have intervened ASAP once the server told you it was taking forever. And as a manager, you should have personally checked in with me... and explained instead of waiting for ME to ask for you.  anyways--didnt feel like ordering anything else. lost my appetite.  this place is only good if you want to get drinks at the bar and make use of their TV. other than that-- service sucks. food takes forever. Management clearly does not care if customers leave unhappy. They totally need to work on that."
Andrew K.,"San Francisco, CA",2028,4644,,2.0,5/23/2013,"Chain reminiscent of the chains from my childhood. Clean space, nice waiter, long Cheesecake Factory-type menu. Very cheap - especially for lunch - they can't be using good ingredients. Made a few substitutions on my salad and kitchen was so confused that they took an extra 45 minutes for my food to come out. Food tasted so-so."
Cheryl Q.,"San Francisco, CA",80,210,217,4.0,9/17/2012,"I used to come here frequently for birthday dinners, get-togethers, or just casual dinner/lunch.  I haven't been here for about two years.  A friend and I were studying across the way in the bookstore and decided to grab some lunch before leaving the mall. BJ's is just as how I remembered it!  Good food, attentive staff, and clean.  I ordered brunch-eggs with a bunch of veggies and avocados with wheat toast while my friend ordered his usual, the tilapia.  Although I've been here plenty of times, I've never ordered anything from the brunch menu.  My order was simple, satisfying, and delicious.  We were eyeballing the bar as we were finishing our meals but had to make that flight to vegas! Make sure you order a pazookie  (a freshly baked warm cookie topped with a large scoop of ice cream! DROOOOOOOOOOL) and if you're a fan of beer, check out the beer list which is listed from lightest to darkest!"
B W.,"Chicago, IL",7,14,7,4.0,2/8/2014,"Ok so Saturday night at 1900 is sorta a dumb time to come but they got us in quickly, the waiter (although SUPER busy) was quick and personable! My wife and I shared the chicken bacon flatbread appetizer and it was PLENTY for the entire meal for both of us!! With leftovers! The hard cider was pleasant and the people watching... Fantastic!!"
Danny C.,"South San Francisco, CA",105,1290,451,2.0,5/18/2013,"Two redeeming qualities - pizookies and friendly, quick waiters. Otherwise, this place  is pretty bad. Deep dish pizza - nothing baked into the pizza. Not a deep dish, just a very fluffy, doughy pizza with the toppings on top. Nachos - almost nonexistent cheese and minimal pico de gallo. Potato skins - again, almost nonexistent layer of cheese. Cobb salads - under-dressed pieces of small iceberg lettuce with soggy croutons. Mozzarella salad - one piece of lettuce. Now, the pizookies were good, but you can't go wrong with ice cream on top of a fresh cookie. I recommend the cookies and cream kind. Otherwise, find somewhere to eat that won't cost you this much money for such poor food."
James D.,"San Francisco, CA",64,44,3,1.0,10/12/2012,"I used to really enjoy going to BJs because they had decently priced food and drinks but sadly I gotta say they've gone downhill in recent years. The food quality was never top notch to begin with (though that's kinda expected) but sanitation has become an increasing problem in my recent visits. I had ordered a mini pizza and as I began digging in I noticed an incredibly long hair baked into my pizza. I was offered a new pizza but I declined and the manager actually came to apologize. I didn't get anything complimentary but he removed the pizza from my bill so I didn't stress the issue. Fast forward to today and I am being served by someone who I'm assuming is a nice lady but was either trained improperly or does not seem to understand how to read the menu. For starters we were told we weren't allowed to get a specific soup because it was neither a Wedneday or Saturday which apparently are the only days the soup is available. Upon looking at the menu it listed that the soup was ""Served Wednesday-Saturday"" and when we brought it up to the waitress she said that it was only for those two specific days listed. WHAT?!?! The last straw came with our bill. We ordered the lunch size pasta which comes with a soup or salad and is $1 off the regular price. My GF substituted the Shrimp for her meal bringing the regular price up about $1 and it was listed clearly that the total should be $13.95. Let's do simple math here: $13.95 - $1 because of the lunch special = what? If you said $12.95 you are wrong because it's actually $15+. When I addressed the error she took it to her supervisor and came back stating that I was wrong and even after pointing out the errors on their part she continued to insist they were right. Finally after some back and forth she came back with the ""corrected"" price of $13.05 and I realized that it would be a waste of time to wait for them to get the correct price of $12.95 so I paid the extra dime.  I won't be coming back here for awhile and if you read this far, you may wanna stay away too. There are great servers here but the bad apples spoiled the bunch for me. Btw, even though our waitress (I won't say names) checked up on us maybe once every 15 mins, once I was supposed to sign the bill and leave a tip she decided to check up on me every 2 mins. Great prioritizing.."
Megan R.,"San Francisco, CA",7,22,1,3.0,7/9/2014,"Come here for lunch, and while the food is okay it's an awesome bar to watch sports in! Tons of TV's you can see from almost anywhere! Just wish they had more of La Liga or the Premier League playing..."
Karl K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,232,10,3.0,6/23/2013,"Who are we kidding? You'd only ever eat here to watch a game with your friends. Not my first choice, but in that whole South City/North of San Mateo area, you could do a lot worse. I'd definitely come here before Hooters. Not all the seats have good views of the TVs, so arrive early and claim a table with a good angle. Section near the bar is open seating, but it's really hard to get a good seat before a big game in that area without showing up 90 minutes before tipoff/kickoff."
Bobbie B.,"San Jose, CA",0,52,,3.0,1/7/2015,"I expected to not  like this chain restaurant with a massive menu but actually the unlimited soup and salad at lunch was quite good.  The four soups on the menu were well-prepared with good flavor accents, not over salted, and served hot.  The four different salads were also well-prepared with fresh and crisp greens and good dressing. The price was excellent.  There were service problems though.  The food took too long,  the appetizers were served after the entree.  Idle wait staff ignored requests for silverware (yes a basic fork) and water.  Although the restaurant was only 1/2 full they seated our party of 5 large adults in a too small booth.  our waiter  though was friendly and helpful but just overworked."
Paulette A.,"San Francisco, CA",1,6,,1.0,1/7/2015,Worst BJ's I've been to. Had us wait half an hr+ to be seated then forgot our reservation. Food was cold/ half cooked. They forgot to order half our order. Then tried to compensate with a dessert. REALLY?! At least the last waitress was nice.
Rick M.,"Chicago, IL",0,24,,2.0,5/17/2014,We ordered soup and a pizza.  The soup was pretty good but the pizza was not much better than a frozen pizza. The Goliath IPA beer was very good.  The service was very poor.  Inattentive and unfriendly.
El A.,"South San Francisco, CA",9,127,40,2.0,7/18/2013,"Went to BJ's yesterday with a party of 7.  In addition to appetizers, we ordered a couple of large specialty deep dish pizzas.  Although the service was great, we were so disappointed with the quality of the pizza.   Let's see, how can I put this nicely?  The deep dish pizza was 80% bread.  I've tasted better quality pizzas at Pizza Hut and Dominoes."
Nathan H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/4/2015,"Got the bbq bison burger. Incredibly shitty. Came late, asked for medium rare came back very well done. Bunch of 'Cole slaw' on the side which was really just chopped up cabbage. Just generally a horrible meal."
DJ Nocturna R.,"Honolulu, HI",1172,172,570,1.0,7/14/2014,"Im sorry I have to be blunt. I will never go here again. It's was my first and my last. The service was terrible. My food was very late, I got no apology or explanation and they charged us for it. The food was not even good. For a big party, you need more than one waiter. If it wasn't for the great company, I would have complained."
