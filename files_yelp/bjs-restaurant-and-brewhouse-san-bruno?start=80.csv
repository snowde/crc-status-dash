Mikey S.,"San Francisco, CA",49,38,3,2.0,10/25/2017,"My first time here and unfortunately my last. Two of us were seated before 1:00pm and waited for a wait person about 10 min. We were ready to order and we're told our waitress was busy but this waiter could get our order in. We waited another 20 min, them 30 min. Waiter apologizes and says he'll check. Then he tells manager. We finally get the two salads we order 45 min later while people seated 15 min after us already had meals (although we overheard an apology how long their order took as well). As far as the food, they messed up my friend's salad and out chicken on it when she ordered shrimp (they out both) and she doesn't eat chicken. I ordered the ahi tuna salad for $16 and there were 8 small bites of tuna on it. It was all very mediocre at best."
Anny W.,"San Francisco, CA",427,151,60,2.0,11/5/2016,"Once in a while, I'm craving something hearty. So I suggested to eat here for dinner on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. First off, the wait was 50 minutes. Fine- I get it if the restaurant was packed. I walked by the windows that were faced towards the mall and saw a whole row of empty tables/seats. That could've easily fitted 4 parties of 4 and 4 parties of 2. How is that even efficient? 50 minutes passed and I didn't get a text. I went to check with the host and he got extremely defensive about it: ""Sorry mam. I gave you 50 minutes as a estimated time that you'll be seated. We can't do anything to make it any faster. We have customers who are just sitting there after dinner. You will just have to wait."" That was a total uncalled for response but whatever. My boyfriend and I sat in the waiting area for another 10 minutes. So the total wait time was  WHOLE HOUR. The waiter that served us was not attentive and seemed to be all over the place. We ordered appetizers, soup, beer and two entrees. I can officially reward this BJ to be the longest wait time in the world for an appetizer. We waited a whole 30 mins for Avocado Spring Rolls. To put the cherry on top, we didn't have any utensils OR plates. I had to ask the waiter TWICE for it. Then my boyfriend's beer came, he just slammed it down and walked away! Maybe he felt bad and came back to ""check"" up on us to see how we liked our egg rolls. If you plan on getting the steak with sides of veggies, please do yourself a favor and pass on it. The veggies were really dry and overcooked with no seasoning. I got the bacon avocado burger and my waiter didn't even ask how I wanted my patty to be cooked. I got a well done burger patty and I only eat medium rare! Total fail. When it was time to pay, I asked the waiter for two box and a check. He was wandering around and checking up on tables around us. He saw me glaring at him and he already forgot to give me the things I've asked for. I waved my hands to get his attention to ask where's the box and check? He apologized and said he totally forgot *rolls eyes*. He came back and said the printer ran out of receipt paper so he has to get his manager to re-print it the receipt. This means ANOTHER wait?! Omg someone please pass me a beer. This was my fifth time visiting BJ at this location and I vow to never return. The last time I went, they forgot about utensils, plates and the wait time for the food was ridiculous as well. The management needs to step their game up because Red Robin is nearby and they can steal your customers and business in a heart beat."
Hector B.,"Littleton, CO",64,216,13,4.0,6/6/2017,"The best part of BJ's is their salads! There kale and brussel sprouts are amazing, add grilled chicken and it's only 660 calories. You will be full and really enjoy it. Their seasonal beers are best! Great place to go without spending a ton! I go at least once a month with my wife!"
Aaliyah T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,2,2.0,11/13/2017,Good food. Service was terrible. Like honestly awful. Ordered appetisers 40 minutes ago and no one has been back to my table yet. Not even a refill.
Wendy H.,"San Francisco, CA",104,1308,331,4.0,6/2/2016,"Came here for lunch on Saturday.  Place wasn't so busy but we waited a long time for our food.  Minus one star for giving me stone cold fries.  Seriously they felt like it was cooked and dumped in the fridge for 5 minutes. That's how cold the fries were.   However, the server was quick to correct the problem.  I got fresh hot fries as soon as I flagged him down about the problem.   I did like my portobello mushroom burger.  That was super yummy."
Vincent J.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/26/2017,"As a reader of signs, the Monday special of $5 margs and half off large pizzas enticed me. But what really stood out was the high-end service Michelle (shelly) offered to our party. She was attentive and caring about our culinary interests. Her beverage recommendations were top notch as well as her ability to run the food and drinks to our table at a divine pace. Everything was exquisite to a tee. I'm quite satisfied and will definitely be returning. Well hired, management."
Roman T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,7,1,1.0,7/5/2017,"A training on how not to treat a customer is how we treated by our server. When we left the restaurant, even tho I wanted to just brush off the terrible service, I felt we were rudely served  from beginning to end by this lady server that I felt the need to call the restaurant to speak to a Manager.  I recounted to the Manager (Rachel) how we were not given utensils when our order came and when we brought it to her attention, there was no apology and gave us two sets when there was three of us.  No offer for condiments was made altho one order was hamburger w unlimited fries. No refills for fries was offered during the meal. We of course, started noticing this inconsistencies including refill for the drink which she never made until I asked for the bill.  After sharing this with the Manager and she apologized and said this would help them in their personnel training. Not worth coming back here."
Jenny O.,"San Francisco, CA",351,2,,5.0,9/26/2017,"First time coming here and was not disappointed one bit. Our server, Michelle, was very friendly and attentive. She gave us great suggestions and convinced us to try their new churro pizookie. It's a must! Definitely coming back and requesting her!"
Sarah B.,"South San Francisco, CA",4,11,14,1.0,9/13/2017,"I'm someone who's been here multiple times and had never had a problem before. However after one bad experience, it's pretty safe to say that I'll never be back. Long story short, I ordered one of my favorite meals, Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and I ended up with food poisoning hours after. I wasn't mad at the place, I just wish that they would know better and not serve or prepare expired/ bad food to guests. Afterwards, I contacted the establishment online to let them know about my experience and to please try to avoid it from happening in the future. I received no reply or apology whatsoever. Not that I was looking for any kind of sympathy, but if your food gave someone food poisoning, wouldn't you feel bad? Definitely not saying this will happen to everybody, but if you want to order the Clam Chowder after reading this, lol go for it."
Keith A.,"Oceanside, CA",703,331,5347,3.0,7/14/2016,"Typical BJs set up, decorations, motif. Same menu as other locations. Location is in a mall near a freeway.  Servers were nice, friendly, expedient, got the order correct and followed up a few times. Food was good, warm, came out fast after ordering. Plenty of TVs to watch sports."
Rach Q.,"Concord, CA",141,14,3,1.0,8/17/2017,"Whatever wait time they estimate, add on an extra 45 minutes. Ridiculous. Once we got seated and ordered, the appetizer they brought us was burned!"
Angelina H.,"San Bruno, CA",264,12,34,1.0,11/8/2017,"I live super close, and love the food here. It's a shame that the service is awful. They really need new management."
Mike O.,"Daly City, CA",22,115,43,3.0,6/7/2017,"I used to come to BJ's for lunch quite often when I worked down on Sneath Lane. They have quite a good and filling deals for around 9-12 bucks. The menu changes up every so often. At lunch time there usually is no wait to be seated, but if you have a huge party you may want to call in ahead of time. My favorite deal for lunch is the unlimited soup and salad. I would usually order the Caesar salad and like 3 rounds of clam chowder. There was one time they ran out of clam chowder and we had to sit and wait for 30mins just so they could make a new batch. The other issue is that even if they have it ready, the waiter takes almost 15mins to bring another bowl of soup after the first round. The overall taste is fine, but there's just a lot of waiting to get your food. I do occasionally stop by with my friends for dinner as well. They have pretty good deals for Happy Hour; I think 50% off select appetizers, and cheap drinks. Again, it's pretty hard to flag someone down to put in your orders and then again to pay your bill. In conclusion, food is not bad, but they need a bit of work on service. Warriors game nights can be fun here!"
Nick T.,"Belmont, CA",18,17,15,1.0,10/4/2017,just got a pazookie to go. 10/4/17 @ 4:20 ish and when i got it opened on yhe way home its a burnt af cookie.  U LITERALLY HAD ONE JOB ffs
Michael L.,"Daly City, CA",410,36,36,5.0,4/20/2017,Haven't been to a bjs in around 5 years. Only went because I had a gift card that was given to me and a coupon for $10 off $35. Man was I surprised. We got the prime rib special and a breakfast omelet to meet the $35. The prime rib also came with a pizookie and soup which we got the clam chowder. The food came. Wife and I pretty much only finished the prime rib items because there was so much food. Clam chowder was a huge bowl and had a generous portion of clams. Prime rib was huge and the pizookie was delicious. Ate the breakfast food for dinner. Very satisfied.
Blake H.,"San Francisco, CA",6,24,12,4.0,9/10/2017,"The menu is outstanding. I mean it's really impressive how many options they have. In addition to options being good sized portions, most menu items seem to be really tasty. The prices are fair for the portions, but it's not an amazing deal or anything. Definitely a fun place to watch big sports events. For the warriors championships, it's always packed out with a great crowd and great vibe. The ONLY reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars, is because it's not a 5 star restaurant with 5 star service, like a Gary Denko (5x as expensive). BJ's is an excellent 4 star choice."
Darryl B.,"San Francisco, CA",124,7,11,1.0,8/16/2017,If I could give a zero I would! Terrible tasting food. Less than mediocre service. We will most definitely not ever come back. Did they microwave our food??? Let's not even talk about the pissy non taken care of bathrooms . Thumbs DOWN ! We should have went to Jacks !
Kira S.,"Oakdale, CA",172,11,2,5.0,8/29/2017,"Its a great place to go for a quick bite or for a family outting! Everything is served right, and when it isn't, someone always smoothes it over. Everything on the menu I've had so far has been pretty good. I really enjoy that they have lighter options."
Emily N.,"San Leandro, CA",40,4,9,5.0,4/5/2017,"Party of 15 people for a birthday dinner ""Elda"".Reservation outside patio by the fireplace. Server was awesome and one of the manager there name ""Efraim"" was awesome and attentive too and made sure our food was hot knowing we were eating  outside! Food and drinks was delicious!Good servers starts with how well your managers are with you....Thanks to one of the manager there name""EFRAIM""."
Jaine L.,"San Francisco, CA",55,28,,1.0,8/30/2017,About a month ago my friend was having a drink and a rat ran up her pant leg!!! Why is this place still in business!! Shes not the type to write a bad review or any reviews for that matter so I took upon myself to inform people that go to BJ's at tanforan that this place is probably infested with rodents.  All management did was to offer us a discount ! Haa... what a joke!!! Not sure why this place still gets some 4 stars reviews...but overall there must be a reason why this place has 2 and only stars!!
