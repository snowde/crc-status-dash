Gary B.,"San Antonio, TX",5,5,,2.0,12/30/2014,"I don't know why service was terrible tonight but it was. Could've been the cooks, the waiters' forgetfulness or the amount of customers."

Briana M.,"San Francisco, CA",2,9,,1.0,12/29/2015,Terrible. Worst Service I've ever had. Our waitress was not attentive at all and gave me attitude when I asked for another salad ( I ordered unlimited soup and salad). The only plus is the $3.95 beer happy hour.
Eric L.,"Oakland, CA",1,24,1,1.0,4/14/2014,"First of all if you have any hopes of getting seated inside be prepared to have to wait 45+ minutes just to be seated. On this occasion we were forced to sit outside on the patio. Upon sitting down on this chilly day, we realized the outdoor heaters were not turned on so we asked our waitress if she could turn them on for us & she quickly mentioned she would get her manager.  This alone struck me off guard since she worked there and should know how to function the heaters on her own for the customers.  I did not want to make a scene to require the manager to personally attend to us for something that could have and should have been done by the server. After finally getting our heater fixed, we ordered our drinks & either the waitress was new or didn't know her stuff but she kept telling us certain things were not on the happy hour menu when we were reading right off of it.  I know it may be a lot to remember but certainly something that should be able to grasp after a while.  STRIKE 1 After finally ordering our drinks, we had to wait a solid 10-15 minutes before getting them served to us which was horrible. The foam on my beer was gone and the evaporation on the glass showed that my beer had been poured a while ago & was sitting on the counter not being delivered to us. Upon receiving my beer, I noticed a little spec of dirt near the top which I had to fork out. At this point, I was pretty dissatisfied but still determined to make this a good experience for my girlfriend & I so I ignored it & drank the beer anyways.  I took a sip of the beer and thanks to the combination of the horrible pour by the bartender and the slow delivery by the server, one small sip equated to nearly an inch of the beer in my glass gone! Ridiculous! It seemed that the servers there were all inexperienced.  Every time one of our dishes was on its way to come out to us, it was as if the server was playing a guessing game.  They would go up to two tables before finally figuring out it was our dish.  I mean how hard could it be to deliver the food the appropriate table number? This is just plain inexcusable, get it together! STRIKE 2 One of the only reasons I decided to go back to this restaurant after my first awful experience of getting cold food was the fact that I had purchased a fundraiser card from our local little league team. Once our ""stellar"" waitress came back to drop off the bill, it turned out she brought us out someone else's bill with OUR discount applied to it. After waiting another 5-10 minutes to flag her down & let her know that she had made a mistake, we finally got the right bill.    Our bill came out to $31 & I reluctantly handed over my credit card to escape this hell hole.  Upon getting my card back I realize that I was charged for $33 dollars instead of the $31 that was on the tab previously.  WHAT TYPE OF RESTAURANT CHANGES A BILLS TOTAL AFTER THE FACT?  STRIKE 3. My girlfriend thought it was ridiculous & suggested to simply not leave a tip, but I didn't want to be rude.  I flagged my waitress down & mentioned it to her & she seemed to have already known of the problem.  If she knew, why hadn't she mentioned it to me!? Apparently the machine was having trouble honoring my discount and ended up charging me the full amount, which would have been nice to know.  Upon the managers arrival he said their machines have been messing up and such.  I did not want to hear this after the fact of my card being charged an amount I hadn't agreed to.  You could tell some of the managers buddies were also in the patio area since he was raising his voice & making a scene out of it.  I did not want to look like the petty guy complaining over a couple dollars but that is exactly what he tried to make me look like.  I was arguing more over the principle of what had happened.  Instead of being relaxed and care free, I was being annoyed. He mentioned, ""oh you want me to log the $1.70 discount? I mean I can easily do that if it will make you happy"" & he chuckled and said it in a way to belittle me in front of his friends.  I eventually started ignoring what he had to say as he didn't seem to get what I was arguing over & I wouldn't be surprised if he was under the influence as well.   I still ended up giving the waitress her tip & paid the tab (without my discount) just so I could leave and not have bad karma laying over me.   To sum it up, the wait staff is inexperienced, the servers are incompetent &  the managers are unprofessional.   The only thing worth anything at this place are the pazookie's which if I ever get the urge to have one it certainly won't be from here. I will gladly drive the extra 30+ miles just to not have to ever lay foot in this specific location ever again."
Tom A.,"Amarillo, TX",0,6,,1.0,2/1/2016,"I usually don't do reviews, but this place deserves it. Sat right next to the bar, still had to wait 20 minutes for a beer, while watching others around me get served. Waited almost an hour for dinner, just a burger & salad. It came out in 3 deliveries, forgot the fries, forgot the salad, the burger had been sitting a long time waiting to be brought out, so it was cold & obviously just slapped together. If the food was worth waiting for, that's one thing. But between being ignored & bad food & service, no more bj for me. There's plenty of other decent places to go."
Alicia W.,"Daly City, CA",1,24,24,1.0,4/15/2014,Worst place ever came here at 11:00pm no one wanna serve us bad customer service if I can give zero star ill give them zero people who work here r rude sit down for 10min not even a cup of water or menu we have to wave at the server to ask them if we could have a menu!!! After we got the menu the server said he will b right back 10 min pass no one came back we have to look for our server I guess they r in a rush to get off work and don't wanna serve..the manager here really need to retain all their staff....this is the worst customer service restaurant I ever been too and I would never come back for sure
Sean-Paul G.,"San Jose, CA",257,38,30,3.0,7/27/2010,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon round 3.  Joint wasn't too crowded so my buddy and I came in for a bite to eat...you know...get some energy in for the perfect shirt search ahead. We took a seat in the bar area and after a couple minutes, a server came by and handed us menus and took our drink order.  I had an iced tea while my friend had an Arnold Palmer. My iced tea was a little watered down and his Arnold Palmer was waaaay too tart.  Like lip puckering tart.... We were served our meals without silverware or napkins (not that you need silverware for burgers and fries...but you'd think they'd provide it just in case you wanted to cut the burger down more into manageable bites. Had to flag the server down for that... I ordered the Cuban Burger with the wedge cut fries and my friend had the Classic Burger with the crispy thin fries. Our burgers were excellent.  Perfectly cooked...grilled with just a little pink in the middle.  The ham really set my burger off...so yummy. Now onto the fries.... The wedge cut fries were great...each one was crisp and warm....ranch is a great dipper with these suckers. The crispy-thin fries...not so great.  They were a little warm and soggy.  Seems like they were sittin under a heat lamp for quite some time. The server didn't come around as much as we wanted him to...but he was nice and responded to our requests with the quickness. It was an OK experience...but nothing to write home about.... Writing to Yelp it...that's a different story."
Sonya S.,"New Orleans, LA",30,147,94,1.0,12/5/2012,"In fairness, the Beer should get 5 stars, but the food here was so bad, that this place deserves 1 star and they should be ashamed! I have eaten at Bj's in Orlando and Las Vegas and both times had really good food and beer, so we were both shocked that the food here was worse than Mc Donalds- and I HATE fast food! First, my partner ordered the Turkey Burger which came with fries. The fries came out stone cold. When we finally tracked someone down we told them and they eventually brought some more fries, which were also stone cold!! They were obviously from the same batch and had been sitting for some time. Really? Did they not think to check the temp as the issue was the fact that they were inedible cold, not that we wanted piles of fries! Burger was also tasteless, though the roll looked good. I had a Tomato and Mozzarella salad and a thin crust pizza. Pizza actually tasted remarkably like a Tonitos that you buy in the grocery store for .99, but I was paying $10.50. It was obviously frozen and I only ate 2 of the 6 pieces because it was gag worthy. Considering that on occasion I eat Little Cesears $5 Pizza Pizza, my standards  are reasonable. After living in Florida for the past 5 1/2 years, I'm used to blah pizza, believe me! the fact that this was actually inedible really says something. The little salad was OK, though they put overwhelming seasonings on it which kind of ruined it. Just a drizzle of Olive Oil would have been fantastic. I was so annoyed about the food, I refused to get a 2nd beer because they do not deserve any more of my hard earned money! It's a shame because the Red Beer is really tasty. Also the service was horrible. trying to get the attention of a waiter was impossible. My partner joked about tossing his empty beer glass on the floor as they walked by to try and get the attention of someone-anyone! Ugh! Skip this place people, unless you just want beer. The food quality is really, really depressing! We stopped at the Wendy's on the way back to the room as neither of us ate much of our dinners and we were still hungry!"
Sandra L.,"San Jose, CA",1,87,5,1.0,2/15/2015,"Our waiter was the White Bald guy with green eyes; he was very Rude and he gave me attitude when I asked which drink was the customer across from me drinking.  He responded and he said, ''I'll speak to you when I'm ready to speak to you.'' I was in shock that our waiter acted Like a Diva drag queen.  He should not work there if he is going to give bad customer service."
Rose A.,"Daly City, CA",368,622,3017,4.0,3/29/2011,"BJ's has a huge menu!  Their clam chowder is really delicious - thick and creamy.  Their wedge salad is yummy, too.  They have a lot of really good appetizers and cocktails as well.  Of course their pizookies are awesome!  I was; however, disappointed with what they call deep dish pizza.  The service is usually good but the restaurant usually gets really crowded so the wait for the table can be a bit long."
Mai H.,"San Leandro, CA",179,149,38,4.0,9/24/2012,My 4 stars still stands. Came here last night for dinner. We had a total of 4 adults and 3 kids and its a really good place for kids. They have crayons for the kids and beer for the adults haha The chicken wings here are so good! I love it!!! Cajun pasta was pretty good too. The shrimp was well flavored.  The pizza has a little too much dough for me.  The oreo pizookie was so good!!!! Definitely come back just for wings and pizookie!
Carina L.,"San Francisco, CA",109,34,14,2.0,4/15/2014,"I don't know if it is just me but is this place over priced and overrated or what? I had a server with me and my boyfriend who was giving attitude and for some reason all those servers think too highly of themselves. I used to come here all the time because it's a sports bar and cool hang out spot, but I'm cool of the waiters if they are going to serve and give me attitude."
Stephanie B.,"San Francisco, CA",1,12,,1.0,11/22/2015,this location has VERY POOR management and hostess that cannot read or hostess that have a sense of time we waited 2 hours for a table an hour for food and they melted our ice cream cake because the hostess put it in the cooler. idiots
Monette P.,"Vacaville, CA",69,70,72,3.0,7/19/2013,it is the best you can get for a mall restaurant.  I don't mind the food but the staff can really be hit or miss.   25% of the time i get really lucky and have a fantabulous waiter who is on top of it and friendly to me and my kids.  about the other 75% of the time i get some rude inattentive person and have to run laps to get someones attention for a refill (i've walked up to the bar myself a couple of times).   I go here often because of its location and late hours.  I just wish their staff was better trained in customer service and organization.
Patricia G.,"San Bernardino, CA",9,46,24,4.0,10/14/2014,"Went with my sweetie for lunch and was very impressed with service and atmosphere after reading the so-so reviews on Yelp.  Our waiter Joshua, was great and very accommodating.  Had a great meal food was good and lunch specials are very filling, had to get the Pizookie to go! :)"
Iris L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,73,3,1.0,5/25/2014,My friend was hospitalized from eating Calamari take out once. She found blue substance in her food. She doesn't want to say anything to the company because she likes the place. But I'm not afraid to speak out for her. This is unacceptable. (See photos. I'm not the only one posting the calamari with blue substance)
Alyssa S.,"San Mateo, CA",133,120,,3.0,6/7/2012,"I wish people would stop celebrating their birthdays here.  During my college years, I came here WAY too often.  If I had it my way, I'd opt for Hooters instead.  Their menu, while extremely (and over-overwhelmingly) extensive, is pretty average if you ask me.  I can say that everything that I've tried there isn't something that makes me go ""YES that's what I want every single time"" (which is what I usually do when I like something--very Sheldon-esque).  Plus the food is overpriced and the wait is freakishly long.  Its advantage over the one in San Mateo/Foster City is that at least it's in Tanforan and I can do some shopping while I wait. The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars over 2 stars (and really the main reason why I ever go to any BJs) is strictly for the pizookie.  Hot chocoloate chip cookie with some ice cream on top?  TO DIE FOR.  Why can't all restaurants just offer this so I don't have to resort to BJs?  I recently tried the red velvet white chocolate chip pizookie.  Also very good but a little too sweet even for this sweet tooth so I'll still with the classic moving forward. Other positives: beer selection is awesome, there's an abundance of TVs, and their Happy Hour makes it worthwhile (but its only available in the bar area which fills up quickly). I will say, service has always been decent.  Nothing bad to report with that.  Just the food in general is just MEH."
Manny O.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,7,2,1.0,8/3/2014,The only good thing I can say is that the beer was cold-ish!  Took 10-15 min for someone to take are order....
Bobby M.,"San Francisco, CA",19,10,,1.0,1/7/2015,"Took my daughter to this location for her 18th birthday on 1/6/15. Previous visits to BJ's in Tanforan were pretty good, but for some reason this visit was the worst. Food was mediocre and our waiter, Rainier, disappeared before serving my daughter her birthday Pizookie. A waitress asked twenty minutes later us if we were still waiting for our Pizookie. So much for the surprise. One came to our table ten minutes later. And then another PIzookie arrived ten minutes after that. We had asked Rainier to split the bill 50-50, but he didn't do it because he never returned. The waitress kind enough to help us with my daughter's Pizookie brought the entire bill to us. Totally unprofessional. Never going to that place ever again. Stay away from this place - it's just a waste of time and money."
CR C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,,4.0,11/8/2013,"Food: The food is very good but many times very salty. Service: The staff is very kind. However, there is a very high turnover as it's constantly busy, but we don't usually wait too long. Ambiance: Casual chic and they are always welcoming of our service dog, which is great."
