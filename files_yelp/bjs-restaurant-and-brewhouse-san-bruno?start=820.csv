Gotta love Bjs, will be back!!!"
V U.,"Daly City, CA",80,152,5,3.0,6/3/2012,"This story is based on actual facts.  My cousin visited from the Philippines and I wanted him to experience all the things in my city that were worth eating.  Have you tried a pizookie? No.. What's that? A Peezookey? *Dead silence as I gasp in disbelief* Two days later, he's scooping warm gooey soft chewy cookie with vanilla ice cream in his mouth and is staring at me in bewilderment.  Where has this been my whole life! I'm telling myself the same exact thing.. Now, he dreams about pizookies. Sure, they might be a little overhyped but their delicious. And it only took me til now to realize that pizookie is a short for pizza cookie. Lol"
Ben T.,"San Francisco, CA",393,185,14,1.0,4/12/2013,"What can you actually like about this place?  I had a friend reserve a table for 20 for her 21st birthday at 9:30. That seems like a pretty decent hour to seat a table of 20, right? Most people would clear out, you can set it up in the back, try not to double stack tables, and we're all good, right? How did they manage to make us wait over an hour and half for the table? Despite my pleas and begs to refuse our business to this place, we ended up staying anyway. The bar barely stocks call liquor. The food is a mediocre greasy mess. Our waiter was trying his best, besides being fairly inept at taking a large group.  Even an avocado egg roll didn't cheer me up after this fiasco."
Lori L.,"San Bruno, CA",7,1,,4.0,1/21/2016,"I had a great server named Monica.  Beautiful, friendly and attentive.  Greeted us with a nice smile and all of our orders were timely.  Food was good but service was excellent for the first time in a very long time.  Thank you Monica"
Mike G.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/21/2016,"In May of last year We experienced some rather poor service and issues with our food.  At that time the then manager, reached out to us and we noticed that on our next visits things had improved greatly.  Although the service continues to be below par, the food is almost always what we expect.  This past weekend, We ventured to BJ's for lunch before a movie.  Walked in, got seated immediately, server quick to the table to take our drink order.  Took about 10 minutes to get two beers, which is about the average wait time for drinks there.  Ordered our appetizers, the chicken wings with parmesian sauce.  Waiter looks at me and says ""how would you like them""?  After explaining again, he leaves.  Appetizer comes, but wait!  No plates, no napkins no utensils.  We had to ask for them after we have been at the table for almost 20 minutes.  Our food order came in a nice amount of time, but wait, my burger which says it comes with ""special burger sauce"" alas had no sauce!!  This is the second time I've ordered the same burger and no sauce!!  When I asked about the sauce the waiter said ""Oh do you want some""?   Long and short service was about 2.5 out of five, food 3 out of 5, over all I've noticed that the servers don't seem to know the menu, they are slow, lots of mangers walking around, but appearing not to notice things.  This is stuff we noticed in the past.  Also seems to be a high turnover rate of servers and managers.   We probably won't be back for awhile, just isn't worth the aggrevation."
Tom C.,"South San Francisco, CA",44,514,30,3.0,6/23/2013,"Wow, I guess there is no where else to go on a Friday night at 11pm - it was packed.  I tried the new Bison Burger - it was very slow coming out, very slow - and it was cold when I got it. I didn't say anything because I didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes for another one. BJ's is usually pretty good - I just think they aren't prepared for a busy crowd."
David I.,"South San Francisco, CA",217,8,,1.0,12/28/2014,"Not what it's cut out for. This use to be a decent place to eat on special occasions but the service is far from special. This is the second time I call in a reservation and they they ""lost the reservation"" and I'm places at the bottom of the list, even after speaking to a supervisor. The waiter was nice but forgot about us after a while. ""Second to none."" More like second to RUN!"
Raquel G.,"Millbrae, CA",11,18,9,1.0,9/3/2013,"Tonight I ordered food online to be ready in time to grab on my way to pick up my bf from work. I show up on schedule to pick up the food and no one seems to know where my food is so the to go girl goes in the back to check with her manager. She returns about 5min later to let me know they aren't sure why my order was never made and that she already put in the order to be ready in 10mins. That made me feel ok so I say and waited. I paid full price for my late order and didn't even receive an apology from the manager which felt like poor customer service. She showed up in about 15min with my order. In a hurry I didn't have a chance to double check the order.  My bf and I get home, take out our food to discover that his food is perfect and mine is a mess. My order was a Santa Fe salad with blackened shrimp.  -My blackened shrimp was not blackened and barley cooked -The lettuce was wet and soggy even though I didn't even have dressing on it -There was no corn or cheese  -There was a piece of chicken -There was a piece of something that resembled grown beef I brushed off having to wait for my order to be made but to serve me something incomplete and unsatisfactory was unacceptable.  I will never order food here again after my horrible experience and I do not recommend this place to anyone."
Nellie N.,"Daly City, CA",0,42,1,2.0,12/4/2012,"BJ's is always crowded, one would hope this is because of the quality food, unfortunately there must be other reasons, as the food is consistently disappointing and orders are routinely missing requested options such as ""dressing on the side"" resulting in a salad smothered in dressing. Pros - -brewed beer -lots of HDTVs -location -options on the menu Cons - - Woefully under-staffed take-out area -orders are incorrect 80% of the time (missing sauce, items, side orders etc..) -food is highly processed typical frozen/pre-made chain food -so many items on the menu, but only a few are half decent -management unable to provide direction to army of kids doing the work -cooks/food prep lack skill and direction.   Everything is microwaved/salty/fried -bagged / pre-chopped lettuce  -long waits for take out or seating  -potential gold mine location is mismanaged  as some staff stand around with nothing to do while others are overwhelmed and backed up as orders sit and get cold For a chain restaurant, BJ's would receive high marks.  It's certainly much better than Applebees, or Olive Garden, they brew their own beer, and have a wide variety of items that are a bit more modern than the fare at Applebees. The main problem is many of the ingredients are clearly ""pre-prepped"" items.  This is standard for many chain restaurants and unfortunately even local places take this short cut.  For instance the salad uses chopped iceberg lettuce and pre-made boiled eggs.   I suspect the lettuce is cut and bagged, the reason I suspect this is because of how dry it often is and many times there is a lot of browning around the edges of the chopped area. The chicken fingers on top of the salad are clearly pre-cooked, frozen variety, Safeway frozen food section quality.  Is it really that hard to use fresh chicken on a salad?  Apparently this is a money/time saver.   It's very simple to make your own breaded chicken breast, it's borderline insulting to use frozen/pre-made and then sell it on a restaurant menu. Probably the best items I've had from BJs are the ""small bites""  fried artichokes and chicken wontons.   While these also taste pre-made/frozen, it's the type of food that holds up ok to being processed.  Dipping fried wontons in hot sauce and blue cheese is a classic experience that is difficult to mess up. But BJ's has managed to mess it up by routinely forgetting to include the blue cheese with to-go orders. The take-out section is woefully understaffed.  Usually by 1 or 2 very young kid is tasked with handling the ever-ringing phone, walk in orders, and bagging and sorting it all.   Meanwhile a middle aged manager usually roams around pointing and making conversation with seated guests.  At the hostess area, a group of young kids usually stands there aimlessly and making small talk with each other while the take-out area is 5 orders deep, and having difficulty arranging it all. You have to wonder if BJs management cares at all what anyone thinks.  They are constantly crowded, and consider it's much better food than the nearby ""Hooters"" you have to assume that ""good enough"" is all they are concerned with. Truthfully, if you are in the Tan-Foran mall, what else are you going to do?  Hooters, Food Court, Red Robin are your options.   All of them poor."
Jansine G.,"San Francisco, CA",106,6,3,3.0,11/3/2015,Service is sooooo bad at night! It isn't even that busy but they take forever to serve. I'm usually just here for the drinks because food is ok.
Tim L.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,17,1,2.0,1/25/2015,"A year later, we were at the mall and decided to give them another shot.  Verdict: much improved (or maybe we got lucky) so I'll add a star back on.  At this rate we'll get them back to a 3 by 2016, no problem!"
JJ S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",101,91,128,2.0,9/24/2014,"Service - our first server was great! She came by pretty often and checked if we needed anything but our second sever, I wished I remember her name, was horrible. We asked  2 times for a refill of our coffee and strawberry lemonade and I had to get up and request it a 3rd time by looking for her. The Ahi Poke wasn't too good. Just going to end it here because I can write more but it just isn't worth my time."
Krystal M.,"El Monte, CA",11,30,19,1.0,9/22/2015,"My friends and I came here for a birthday celebration so we needed a table for 6. They told us there would be a 45 minute wait so we walked around the bookstore next door. We waited for about 20 minutes and our table was ready so that was a great start. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn't social and we would have to ask for refills constantly. Once we got our food, one of us got a dirty spoon. We just had to constantly ask for everything and the waiter wasn't checking up on us. We had to ask different waiters and waitresses. Overall, the food was good but the service was not great. Also, we told them it was one of our friend's birthday and they forgot. We also had to split checks and that was the worst thing ever! We took about 30 minutes because then the waiter split up the checks wrong and it was just horrible. Then we were fed up so the manager came and fixed everything. This was such a horrible experience."
Eva L.,"San Bruno, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/19/2014,"The service is really slow. Our server was rude when asking for our orders. She took 20minutes just to serve us water. Overall, we walked out because the service was terrible. I don't recommend this location to go too. Other BJ's are way better to enjoy the food. This location is ran by unprofessional management. I don't know why no changes have been made. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE."
Ashley M.,"Eugene, OR",542,461,939,4.0,7/8/2012,"I came into BJ's on a Thursday afternoon with my brother to grab some lunch. This place is huge! Many tables inside, a few outside, and even some in the mall where BJ's is attached. The staff greeted us kindly and we were seated immediately. The place was busy but not packed and soon I was sippin' on a watermelon mojito (one of their signature drinks). The mojito was alright, all I could really taste was the Watermelon Puckers they pour into it but I knew I was chancing it with something that was watermelon flavored in the first place. My brother works at a BJ's in Sonoma County so he knew what to order and what to not order. We had the potato skin appetizers and the California club flat bread. Both were tasty in an artery clogging sort of way. I had a few bites of each and man did I feel 10 pounds heavier. We packaged up most of it for the people back home and ordered our main course. The ahi tuna salad was giant and satisfying. I asked for no bell peppers and Voilà! No red bell peppers!...(I swear every time I ask for that no one can handle it). When I saw the tiny drops of wasabi around my plate I thought I'd have to order more but I was wrong. The wasabi is SOOOOO SPICY! I can handle a good amount with my sushi at most authentic Japanese restaurants and eat more than the average person but this stuff was lethal. I liked it.  My brother had the crispy chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. The potatoes are really cheesy but yummy none the less. We were stuffed but decided to share a mini Oreo Cookie Pazooki. It's a scoop of Oreo Cookie ice cream on a chocolate cookie with oreo cookie mousse on the side. It was the perfect small size for a few bites...unlike the table next to us ordering the 7 scoop, giant cookie party Pazooki! Damn!  The music they play here is completely random so be prepared to hear quite the variety while enjoying your food. All in all this is a great restaurant for all ages and types of people. They have a large menu with tons to choose from drink and food wise. It's very similar to the cheesecake factory, minus the cheesecake."
Christy V.,"San Jose, CA",90,22,3,4.0,5/24/2012,"I feel so weird when people write bad reviews for a place and then I write a good one. Especially when I know the bad reviewer *ahem* Jessica A. hahah.  I never had a bad experience here (knock on freakin wood!). I once left my backpack under the table and ran back to get it, and they kept it safe in the back for me. The wait can be long, but my bf and I usually try to snag a bar seat cuz it's first come first served.  I'm hopelessly in love with their red velvet pizookie, and orange twist drink! The portabello pizza is good too.."
Crystal Z.,"Daly City, CA",0,10,4,3.0,11/12/2014,"I really liked this place when they first opened up but now it's just not the same. The service is slow, they check on the table 30 minutes at a time, and they are forgetful. I know it's busy but wouldn't you want business to go smoothly with more staff? The food is good but I always get the same stuff.. wings.. pizza.. grilled chicken pasta. Overall service is poor and slow. Elephant bar has way more potential than this place. I don't even want to order more food and even dessert because I know they will take forever! If your hungry don't come here!"
Rob G.,"San Diego, CA",3,7,,1.0,12/10/2015,"We ordered a pizooki for takeout.  The guy took my name and said it would be 10 minutes.  I sat down right in front of him.  Twenty five minutes later, I ask him what happened and he says wait a minute and takes the pizooki out of the refrigerator and hands it to me.  HORRIBLE SERVICE.  No apology either."
Christine M.,"San Francisco, CA",479,607,210,3.0,9/24/2012,"HH! on a friday at 6pm, luckily someone was leaving and we didn't have to wait long for a table in the HH section. we ordered some drinks, i had a pomegranate sunset, kind of strong but yummy. nachos- good to munch on, not enough toppings though.... potato skins- crispy skin, but eh potato 3 mini pizzas- the hawaiian one, the original and the bbq chicken. i liked the bbq chicken best. overall a very chill HH, great spot for talking and catching up and watching the game. service was good, they checked on us often enough. decent HH price. and we finished everythinggggg fatties."
Albert L.,"Temple City, CA",318,177,61,3.0,3/20/2011,I only like 3 things at BJ's: 1) the Heff beer 2) the avocado egg rolls 3) the Pizookie And I suppose I like the sports bar type of atmosphere because you can be as loud as you want with your group of friends
