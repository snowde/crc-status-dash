Raeann L.,"San Jose, CA",66,3,,2.0,4/29/2014,"The service here is HORRIBLE. First of all, the whole time we were here, we were not offered any water or given any water. I understand that we went during a playoff game and it gets super busy but that is no excuse for good customer service. Second of all, they had a shortage of glasses and pitchers and asked us to chug our beers so they could use our glasses. Although I agree that beers should be chugged and not sitting on the table waiting to be consumed, it's kind of rude to ask us to drink all our beers so you could use our glasses. If a customer wants to take their time with their drink, then allow them to do so. It's not our faults that you aren't prepared enough to provide glasses for customers to drink their beers especially since this is a popular place that allows customers to watch sports especially during big NBA playoff games with a Bay Area team playing. Oh and did I mention that another server came to our table and told us to pour the rest of what's in the pitcher into our glasses.  Third of all, the server we had was not nice at all. She never came to our table and asked if we needed anything else or if we were doing okay. When we asked for a beer menu she kept walking away as she agreed to get it for us. And then just dropped it off at our table without acknowledging us or being polite about it. AND all of a sudden we had a different waitress. Nobody informed us whether the first server we had was going on a break or not. We had to find out by seeing her picking at her teeth with her finger nails.  Fourth and foremost, they took away my salad that I didn't finish. They didn't ask if I was finished or if I wanted to take it home. There was still plenty left to eat and it irks me to know that they took it and didn't even dare to ask me if I was still eating it.  One of the worst services I have ever experienced. If it weren't for the pizookies and avocado egg rolls, I would give this place one star."
Rosalind S.,"San Francisco, CA",252,737,237,3.0,2/1/2013,"This was my 2nd time here because we needed to find a book store and there happens to be one across the way.  I guess it was breakfast time so I got a breakfast pizza.  I had one slice but polished off the potatoes, YUM! Washed it down with a bloody mary.  Boyfriend got some sandwich and a mimosa that was made with bad sparkling wine.  He's picky because he's French.  haha"
JJAMZ C.,"El Cerrito, CA",63,392,22,3.0,3/4/2013,Ok place. Friendly staff - with the exception that they should know how to pour beer in a brewhouse without overfilling and letting it foam over. My son loves their desserts! The pazooki is what he always looks forward to. The burger I had was good.  was cooked just right and had crispy bacon and soft bun. The clam chowder was a little on the salty side. My sister always orders their ahi tuna salad.
Rhonda D.,"Roseville, CA",0,34,,3.0,6/19/2016,"We went here for lunch before taking our Paris friends to the airport for their return to France, and it was opening day of Euro Cup 2016 which they did not want to miss.  We called ahead to see if they would be playing the game and they told us just to ask and they would make sure it was playing when we came.  We arrived and sat in the bar, and the manager worked quickly to not only have it playing, but had it on the huge screen as well as 2 additional screens!  Fantastic!  For this part we were thrilled.  Now, the food is always fairly good at BJ's but at this location we had the same problem as at our local one in Roseville, CA. - sloooow service.  It took forever to get our food.  The server was very nice and seemed experienced so it wasn't his fault - probably the kitchen.  Each time we go - which is fewer and farther between - the service is the same.  What's the problem BJ?  Get it together! No excuse.  Hire more cooks! You make us stay away and we eat out a lot!"
Jennie C.,"San Francisco, CA",58,28,34,1.0,10/4/2014,Came in waited 10 min before getting a table. The place was half empty. it took another 15 min before the waiter took our order. 25 min later my food is still not here.. slow slow slow service..
Jessica A.,"San Francisco, CA",638,215,416,1.0,2/22/2012,"Yeah, I KNOCKED DOWN TWO STARS from my previous visit. I feel like my experiences here keep getting worse & worse. BUT..a different situation. I didn't even physically make it to BJ's & still had a bad experience. What's up with that?! Okay, so it was a Friday evening two week ago & my family wanted to go to a mini-celebratory dinner. I have the number saved on my phone, so I decided to call ahead for a party of 5. I called a little before 6:30pm & was told that the wait would be 1-1.5 hours. I put my name down. It was super busy on the streets & freeway, so it took awhile to get in the area. Before exiting, I called to see how the wait was at that moment since a bunch of time had passed since I called. I was told that the hostesses were busy, so whoever answered the phone would check himself. Let me put it out there now..I WAS ON THE PHONE FOR 16 MINUTES!!!! ( ) I'm a pretty patient person to wait that long, but 16 MINUTES just to see what our wait is?! & I got PUT ON HOLD THREE TIMES & had to ASK THE SAME THING TWICE. Also..I came to find out THAT I WASN'T EVEN PUT ON THE LIST IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!! What's the point of having a call-ahead service?!!? I don't care that it's a busy Friday night..if you're going to advertise the call-ahead option, GO BY IT & PUT PEOPLE DOWN!!! I was so fed up on the 3rd hold that I just hung up & WE TOOK OUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!!! Way to bring down the mood. I was in a really good mood..hence the MINI-CELEBRATORY DINNER...but yes BJ's, YOU RUINED IT!!  Who makes a customer wait 16 MINUTES..actually MORE than that since I got so fed up that I hung up. I don't know anyone else who'd wait on hold for 16 minutes for ANY business. That's just ridiculous. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE..even over the phone. I have yet to go back & not really sure if I even want to anymore. The service keeps getting worse & I'm not even sure that it's worth it. Maybe the drive to another location is more worth it."
Jeanely H.,"South San Francisco, CA",61,25,,3.0,10/26/2014,"Came here a couple of times now.  Service has been okay and food was good. My husband wasn't thrilled about their blackened chicken pasta; average at best he said.  Both times the place was really busy, but was seated within a reasonable time."
Jessica S.,"San Francisco, CA",154,20,3,5.0,4/24/2012,"I won't lie. The service is decent here. Sometimes we get a grumperton and sometimes we get someone awesome. I really believe that if you're nice to them that they are nice to you. I come here often so it's very seldom that I get someone grumpy.  This review mostly goes out to Ruben, James and Christina (which is why I gave them 5 stars). They are my 3 absolute favorites here. They are ALWAYS so friendly and they make me happy. Ruben and James also bartend and they make my drinks perfect every time. They take care of their people and I appreciate it so much.  BJ's is VERY busy almost all of the time so I don't mind if I have to wait around. This place really doesn't get you in and out all the time. If you're not prepared to wait then don't come here. However, if you end up getting Ruben, James or Christina... you won't be disppointed."
jennifer f.,"San Francisco, CA",211,47,2,4.0,2/23/2013,"BJ's is always a hit or miss. but as always, you don't come to a place with 20 big screen tvs for fancy service or good food... you come for the 20 big screen tvs.  This is a great place to watch a game (baseball season is coming up!). especially if you're rooting for the local team, guaranteed the whole restaurant will root with you. (my personal experience from going to BJ's during the giant's 2012 world series games) Makes for a fun time, guaranteed. Besides the tvs, their variety of beer is always a must try. i've done the sampler twice and now i know i hate dark beer. Their berry cider is a must try for newbies (really sweet, tastes like soda). Another thing that is unique to BJ's is definitely their pizookie. who would've thought? a giant cookie topped with ice cream to share.. genius!"
Tiffany H.,"Davis, CA",146,75,20,4.0,2/20/2013,"BJs is the restaurant of choice whenever we plan a group dinner. Not for their food, but for their atmosphere and large tables.  This is the place to be if you want to go out to watch a game. The food is good, but not superb. I'm a plain Jane and always order the same thing every time-- their spaghetti with marinara sauce. That and their minestrone soup when available. We don't go there for good food we go for their atmosphere. Waiters here are also very nice and accommodating. The wait here is usually an hour, so remember to call in and reserve a table!"
Michelle H.,"San Francisco, CA",33,13,3,2.0,6/16/2013,"This place feels beyond generic.  We went on a Friday night and sat in a booth in the bar area.  The service was incredibly slow - I understand Friday nights are busy.. but it took ages to get our drinks and almost 45 minutes for our food (half of which was forgotten by our waiter and brought out 10+ minutes after everyone else's food had arrived).  The food was average at best - while the food prices weren't bad, nothing on the plate stood out and could probably be found at any other chain restaurant. I was in awe of how expensive the drinks were - I got two ""Arnold Strongers"" and was shocked that the were almost 10$ each.  They certainly didn't /taste/ like 10$ drinks. The atmosphere wasn't bad.  They had TVs set up in the bar and would be a great atmosphere for groups or families. I'd maybe come back for Happy Hour.. but definitely could find far better food and service elsewhere."
William S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,23,2,2.0,5/19/2014,"My attorney and I were seated just before lunch time.  There were many open tables at 11:30 a.m. on a Monday.  The hostess seemed to be too preoccupied chatting with the help to notice us at first and left us waiting for about three minutes while she handled some administrative chores.  Not a good start. We made THREE requests before and after being seated to TURN DOWN THE MUSIC.  Enough Ike and Tina Turner!  We couldn't even hear one another.  NOTHING was done about the shrieking music even after I asked to speak to the manager (he never showed).  The volume and on-going litany of lousy music disrupted our conversation incessantly.   The service was 'perfunctory'.  The waiter only reappeared once:  at the conclusion of the meal to present us a check.  Receiving the food on the table took nearly 25 minutes for two hamburgers and fries!  Was BJs sending their own livestock out to slaughter first?   The burger was LOUSY!  It was covered with grill carbon - you know - the carcinogenic 'stuff' you're not supposed to eat.  And the meat had one flavor:  you guessed it:  CARBON.  Yuck!  The fries were not hot, but they were not greasy - a good point from a true fry lover. Overall, spend your bucks at In and Out Burger.  You'll be a more delighted customer with more change left in your wallet."
Glen S.,"Minneapolis, MN",29,243,3,2.0,12/12/2012,"Yeahhhhhh....I'll pass on writing anything too bad, but I mean, it's your typical chain. I really don't know I'm reviewing this.  BJ's isn't really a place someone goes to because they like it, but rather, there is no where else to go and watch some sports. It's TGI Friday's with a different name."
Panos M.,"San Bruno, CA",35,42,9,1.0,9/21/2012,"I'm not gonna spend too much time on this place because it's not worth it. If you want to cry, order the nachos.  Last time I was at this place, our waitress came by the table at some point to ask if we needed anything. A split second later, she is on her way before I, or anyone at the table, was able to say anything. Yes I need something, how 'bout some flavor for this cardboard you served us."
James L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",1,6,,5.0,11/12/2015,"Came here for lunch and sat at the bar. My day is done so I decided to have the Oasis Amber with the Chicken Club. Not to sound trite, but this lunch was easily one of the top 5 lunches I have ever had. The sandwich had so much flavor that I questioned whether this was a chain or a single restaurant. I can't recall ever having such good food from a restaurant chain before. Take note Fridays and Ruby Tuesdays, should a BJs open on your block! As for the Oasis Amber it hit the right sultry amber note with a moderate to heavy touch of carbonation; perfect for washing down a burger, pizza or in my case, an amazing chicken club. Service at the bar was friendly and professional, complete with the witty banter that makes the bar experience better than a lonely table. Living in NJ I was pleased to read that a location up north in NY opened just this year, about an hour drive from my home. I am looking forward to showing this place off to my wife and friends."
H G.,"San Francisco, CA",2,91,1,1.0,9/21/2015,"Really dunno why I came here. I tried to hide from the heat thinking they had AC, which they did. But I could barely make it home before I had the runs. Still suffering from it 2 hours later.  I suspect it was the unwashed raw celery. It looked suspicious but I was hungry (and dumb)."
Jenny N.,"Oakland, CA",600,471,331,4.0,10/8/2012,"Bjs is always Bjs. No matter which location i go to, its all gonna be the same. its just the servicing thats different. The clam chowder always hits the spot. And the Calamari is always crispy as always and yummiieee :D good place to watch sports while drinking beer too ;D"
Maggie C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",42,253,8,1.0,3/19/2012,"Probably my worst dinner experience ever! I'm sure they don't care about this review as their line is constantly out the door. I guess most families will not go to Hooters which is why they are all here. Go to the food court if you must eat inside the mall.   On a Friday night, we've waited 1hr 45mins for our table and we sat in one of the booth. Since we had movie tickets, we wanted to be sure we can get out of there on time. Service was slow and our server did not check on us at all. We need them to run our credit cards so that we can get outta there so we waved down another server. This rude guy refused to take it but then finally took it with an upset and annoyed look.  We've ordered majorly fried food entrees thinking you can't mess that up. Boy we were wrong, they tasted they were fried while they were still frozen, it has no flavor, completely over-fried and very salty. I ordered fried shrimp and I would've guess I ate fried plastic.  The cheese on their pizza chews and tastes like rubber. Is that industrial grade chhese? Gross.  The appitizer sampler was $16 and came with very little food.  I do not understand why people keep coming back and wait 1hr+ for food that's worst tasting than McDonald's but three times the price."
トモ T.,"Tokyo, Japan",3541,1760,23706,3.0,7/30/2007,"I left this place completely happy and satisfied for a weekend lunch.  Yet, as I was walking out, I said solid 3 stars.  Oh but wait, what more could this place offer to get 4 or 5 stars?   They had: Nice outdoor patio seating Quality TV monitors (saved me once during the NFL playoffs). Fantastic beer tasting deal Awesome nachos Good service Spacious seating Well, restaurant looks and feels like a chain restaurant - because IT IS a national chain. But so what?  Who cares?  If I had a good time, why not give them more stars? Hmmmmmm...that's true.  They don't have any gourmet food, but that's okay for a brewery.  They just need to have pizza, burgers, nachos, etc. that goes well with beer. PIZZA:  One solid criticism I could give is that their so-called Chicago Style pizza is not really Chicago style.  There is too much bread for the amount of topping.  One here is much like Uno's Pizza, which I also don't consider to be true Chicago style pizza.   So they probably deserve more than 3 Stars, but what the heck, I'll give them 3."
Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,4.0,11/20/2010,"B.J.'s has done something wonderful and horrible to their menus. They've added calorie counts (GASP! ACK! COVER YOUR EYES!) 8^O Yes, either I had selective inattention to the plainly printed calorie counts (both per slice or per dish--except for drinks) or they have recently begun to add this for the benefit of their chubby clientele.  From their website FAQ's: ""At this time BJ's Restaurants provides nutritional information for each menu item in California and Oregon.""   This actually made it harder to order than normal because now you are  painfully AWARE of the caloric damage that a BJ's Cuban burger (Calories: 1,249 (but also not in the menu: Fat: 73g, Carbs: 37g, 104g Protein)) or even their ""healthy"" Sesame Chicken Salad (950 calories) per salad, have LOTs more calories than you think you are getting as a single serving. With these subtle warnings in hand, we settled for healthier, lower calorie options [Appetizers comprised our dinner: really good California flat-bread and excellent BBQ pork sliders] but it really opens your eyes that even a mini pizza, and most of their dinner menu items, have enough calories (1,000 +- 100) to split, unless you like splitting your pants.  Service was excellent this time but this is not a consistent quality at this BJs. I did appreciate their call-ahead feature: you can call in ahead of your actual arrival, thus giving you a waiting place in line, so it shortens your actual waiting time there. Enjoy the more informative  BJ's menu! :)"
