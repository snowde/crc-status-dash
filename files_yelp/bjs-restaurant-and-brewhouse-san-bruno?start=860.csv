Julie Z.,"San Jose, CA",173,306,34,2.0,4/15/2012,"hit and miss. came here for a birthday party and then again for happy hour. Happy hour is just $1 dollar off drinks. =/ ehhhhh sat in the booth with friends. the waiter was attentive both times. I would say, skip happy hour and go somewhere else. it's really expensive here."
Jerry W.,"San Francisco, CA",166,280,177,3.0,5/29/2011,"We had large party with kids,  Service was quick and the servers were very attentive.  The menu was large and choices were hard.  This place only had Pepsi products so I have to give them 1 less star...just kidding. I ordered the Texas Style Chicken Fried Steak ($12.25).  It came with steamed veggies and cheddar mashed potatoes.  The steaks were a bit on the chewy side...could have used a pounding or 2 with a tenderizer.  The cream sauce was peppery and had a could texture.  The veggies were a bit blend, but they were fresh and not frozen, thank goodness.  Just dip the veggies into some of the cream sauce.  The cheddar mashed potatoes was very cheesy...really awesome and highly recommended.  Just a side note, you get 2 pieces of steak with this order.  The steaks were in the fryer a bit too long, coming out a bit on the dark brown side.  The batter used reminded me KFC chicken...I think the Colonel might have been moonlighting. I did taste the below items: Chicken Pesto Flat Bread Pizza - not bad, good texture.  The pesto was garlicky and gave the pizza a really good finish. Deep Dish Cheese Pizza - the bready crust was awesome,  but the sauce was nothing to write home about. Pizookie- this is a fresh chocolate chip cookie cooked in a small deep dish pan topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The cookie was good, the chips were warm and melty.  The vanilla ice cream was ... just vanilla...plain and without a bang...boring. Now for the restroom report - I went to the restroom 2 times about an hour apart.  The restroom had 2 sitters and 2 standees.  The floors near the urinals were wet and smelled of urine...the floors were sticky.  If I dropped a $100 bill on the floor in the Men's Room...I would probably just leave it.  The trash cans were full and needed emptying."
Abigail D.,"San Francisco, CA",470,185,59,4.0,3/26/2012,"Always been a staple for me. You can't really go wrong here. Pizzas, sandwiches, rolls, dips, and that pizookie! Oh my. I had it for the first time today and that sucker is dangerous! I probably could've eaten a deep dish sized portion to myself. I like the Oreo flavor! Nomnomnom.  It's really hit or miss with the service. The wait time is highly unpredictable. It ranges from no wait to hours. So be aware. Parking can be difficult, but that's expected because it's located in a shopping center.  My rec for pizza is their Great White. I get it every single time."
Liz W.,"Boston, MA",136,276,227,2.0,2/10/2012,"PIZOOKIE!!!!  & Pizza...the only 2 good things about this place. The lady at the front that seated us was so RUDE and AWKWARD.  She was uninviting and when she seated us, there was greasy food on the seat.  I pointed it out to her (she didn't even notice...) and she merely brushed a few pieces off with her hand.  The GREASE remained.  I asked if she could wipe it down, she rudely walked away came back with a NAPKIN and BARELY wiped it.  The entire time she had the look of disgust and anguish on her face.  The WORST customer service EVER. Thank god the food was alright, we had a pizookie, pizza, and jalapeño burger.  The burger was a 2/5, pizookie 5/5 as always, and pizza 4/5.  But the lady was so rude that this place just doesn't deserve a higher rating."
Stephanie M.,"San Francisco, CA",17,95,42,3.0,2/12/2012,"I love their Nutty Brewnette. It's spicy and hoppy and it makes me sneeze but I still heart it. Now for the longest run-on sentence of your life: I've tried the Spinach and Artichoke Dip (tasty, but I wish it came with bread), Avocado Egg Rolls (good), Original Roast Beef Dip Sandwich (solid and filling), BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich (tasty but too much bun), Buffalo Chicken Pizza (flavor is good but I'm not a fan of deep dish), Spaghetti with Spicy Tomato Sauce (I add chicken), New Orleans Jambalaya (huge portion but it's a little dry), Miso Salmon (the citrus glaze is crazy sweet, blech), Old-Fashioned Pot Roast (the portion could stand to be a little bigger). If your meal comes with fries, the wedges can't be missed. You know what used to taste awesome but was unceremoniously removed from the menu? The meatloaf. WHY? WHY DID YOU TAKE IT OFF THE MENU?! (A server actually told me a man became so angry it disappeared he yelled at the restaurant in general, slammed his menu on the table and stormed out. That's how good it was.) Atmosphere is typically semi-dark and bustling. Food is sorta pricey but usually portions are big. The servers are pretty on point about asking if you need help and bringing you extra stuff you ask for (aka Tabasco, more ranch, etc.). Waits can be horrendous, especially Fri-Sun when parents bring their six kids. I'll always find it strange going to places where there are giggling kids at one table and yelling single drunk chicks literally 10 ft. away. I really wish they would let me rate places half stars because I think this place is a solid 3.5. Side note: whoever designed the Tanforan parking lot needs to be punched in the balls (or the uterus, I don't want to be sexist here)."
Stella Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",819,704,512,4.0,6/6/2012,"Things I love: Happy hour!! On a lonely Monday afternoon, I grabbed a couple people for happy hour because I was craving a mojito. I got the white peach mojito which just hit the spot. It was sweet enough that you can only taste a hint of peach and mint but not too sweet that it tastes like syrup. $5 at happy hour.. I'm sold. Also got the artichoke and spinach dip ($2 off) that came out hot and gooey and big enough to share with many people. Also got 3 mini pizzas (half off)- vegetarian, 3 meat, white pizza. Each incredibly good in their own way; cooked to perfection and just enough cheese. Deep dish always has a place in my stomach.  One thing to note that is if you go to happy hour, it's free seating at the bar. I love how our waitress didn't even know that after we asked her. Also, service is basically non-existant. I don't mind that it's busy but try not to have me flag you down when you haven't come to my table for 15 min to take my order or give me my bill."
Sylvia J.,"Alameda, CA",1,7,,1.0,10/5/2014,Rudest hostess ever!!! Not sure what her name was but she was very pale and had a ton of makeup on. She got all crazy with me for asking a question very bad attitude. That ruined the whole experience.  Hire better people customer service is important!
Diana D.,"San Bruno, CA",0,6,31,3.0,10/3/2015,"Absolutely don't recommend their Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi. The fish is ""about nothing "", completely tasteless. Bison burger is not bad though."
David B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/2/2015,"I have been here a few times and the service has gotten worse each time.  This time was the last. 30 min to take an order, when the food comes out it was wrong and cold.  The manager was nice enough to comp our meal.  But this place has hit rock bottom."
Lisa L.,"San Francisco, CA",562,187,175,3.0,1/13/2013,"I used to come here so much when I was in high school because it was so convenient and I still see a lot of high school come here as well.  Mainly, it's the pizookie that gets the crowd going.  I mean, what's better than a warm, delicious cookie topped with ice cream? Yea, it's so simple but so amazing at the same time.  Not to mention, the portions are big enough to share so order something different.  Last time I came here, I had sliders, a pizza, and the avocado rolls.  OMG LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE AVOCADO EGG ROLLS ARE AWESOME.  I love the dipping sauce that it comes with!  Honestly, what takes away the stars is always the service.  I just feel like for the amount of people I see working there, it shouldn't take as long as it does to get the food and even just water.  When you have to ASK for your water instead of your waiter/waitress asking you what you'd like to drink -- that's already a minus for me, baby.  If the wait is long, there's barnes and noble right across and the mall's right there if you want to shop around as well"
Priscilla W.,"San Francisco, CA",219,54,341,4.0,1/13/2013,"Things that I always order because they're consistently awesome:  - Tatonka Stout  - ahi poke  - calamari - piranha nachos - spinach & artichoke dip - the flatbreads Things that I've tried and am pleasantly surprised about:   - Watermelon and Feta salad! It comes in ""a small bite"" - spinach stuffed mushrooms - their pizza!!!!  - pazookie (noms) The MEH: - avacado egg rolls, personally way too much avacado even for a single portion. The dipping sauce is it's redeeming factor. I'd go with Cheesecake factory's avacado egg rolls - Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. I love lettuce wraps, the only thing i'd change for theirs is the type of lettuce they use. - mini-bruschetta, don't get me wrong i LOVEEEE bruschetta, but this one is passable"
Jay S.,"Emeryville, CA",2,64,4,4.0,10/30/2014,This was our third time at B&J brewry when we walked in the wait was 15 to 20 minutes and finally we were seated. Several managers pass by our table so I grab one and let them know that our last past experiences at the restaurant was negative she promised that his time it would be good and it was so I'm going to give it a 4-star our food was excellent I can't promise the next time we go it'll be good I might just have to tell the manager each time I go about the negative experience I had several months ago.  My advice to people when you go to a new restaurant  rate each experience meaning each time you go back to the restaurant don't judge a book by its cover.
Cathy M.,"San Francisco, CA",146,151,447,1.0,12/21/2013,"NEVER COMING BACK. Got there with a friend around 5pm for HH last night on a Friday but we were waiting for 2 more friends to join us. So while we were waiting we ordered a total of 3 rounds of shots and some apps. Finally my other 2 friends showed up at 6:30pm so we ordered 7 more shots-almost a double shot per person and some cocktails. Since HH ends at 7pm we squeezed in 3 more shots. That's a total of 16 shots among 4 of us.  It may sound like a lot but trust me it wasn't.  They totally skimp on the shots..it's about 50% less than what other places would normally serve. That's why we had to double it up.   Right when we received all our drinks and our food and was getting ready to dig in and ENJOY our Friday, a manager named Cacy came over to us and starts asking us if we were ""OK"" and if we needed anything else.  We told him everything was good...but yet he still lingered at our table and gave us this weird vibe. We can tell his intentions were not simply just checking in on his customers. So finally I asked...""are you kicking us out?"" He replied ""No, but I won't be able to serve you guys any more drinks.""  WHAT?!!  We all just looked at each other in shock. Did we just get cutoff for the night??? At 7:05pm??? Yes we did!! His explanation was because we ordered too much within the last hour and he's concerned for our safety.  We told him that we've been here since 5pm...Almost half of it was ordered during that time and the last round we doubled it up because HH was ending.  Our drinks were still on the table. He can clearly see that. Furthermore, we were not loud or rowdy at all.  In fact the group next to us at the bar was pounding shots left n right, breaking glasses, and extremely loud but I'm positive that they did not get cut off.  What kind of BS is this? He totally offended and targeted us! Ok I can understand that you have your policies to abide by, but why not wait until we order the next round and then inform us of your ""cutoff"" policy.  Why do it RIGHT AFTER we received our drinks and food? How do you expect us as customers to be able to enjoy our dining experience?? This was just absolutely Ridiculous. We were so pissed it's not even funny.  We requested to speak to another manager regarding Cacy's offensive and unprofessional approach but it didn't get anywhere as well.  He apologized and we accepted his apology at the time but we will never come back. NEVER."
Miko A.,"San Francisco, CA",162,93,426,5.0,2/14/2013,Me and My Buddy come here for lunch or Dinner after Movie we have a Good time you Always got Drunk But we always have a Great Time
Deidra H.,"Lincoln, CA",0,35,3,1.0,10/26/2014,"Waitress stole money from us! We gave her $38 cash and told her to put the rest on the card. We saw her drop it on the way to the cash register and she left a dollar on the ground. She proceeded to finish our transaction at the register minus the dollar she dropped. She then walks back towards us and picks up the dropped dollar and slides it in her pocket, thinking we didn't see her. We all watched this happen and gave her the chance to give it back but she never did. I don't care if it was just a dollar, it's still stealing. On top of that she smelled of strong cigarette smoke and had a lot of attitude. She would've racked up a nice tip with us bc we spent a good amount. I rarely have good experiences here. Hope management did something about it."
Ligia A.,"San Mateo, CA",47,37,,2.0,3/26/2012,"Horrible! I  am  in a wheelchair and they tried to seat us in a booth, which made us have to wait another 20 minutes on top of the hour that we just waited... the manager said they would take care of our meal, they just give us a free dessert... I really do love this place, but just not this location."
Michelle M.,"Belmont, CA",197,1852,605,2.0,1/14/2010,"Not my favorite BJ's and that is because this place is super crowded.  The back room looks lame.  I went here for my work x-mas party.  It just felt like we were not important, even though we equal mo money!   The food is okay, feels like bar food.  So it is mainly a place to get together with some people and have a drink.  Nothing really big.  Oh and it gets super loud here, don't expect to hear someone on the other side of the table."
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,4.0,11/23/2012,"It's been a while but I've been here more than a few times... Recently discovered their soup in bread bowls... seriously you wouldn't think that some of the best bread bowls and soup are at BJ's. If you doubt me, give the tomatoe bisque or chili a try in a bread bowl. You will not be disappointed, especially during these winter days/nights. The take out is handled separately so you're not just in with the regular people dining. When I got some soup to-go, they included all the utensils and napkins that I needed. And it was just as good as when I had it at the actual restaurant."
Jorge A.,"San Bruno, CA",18,3,,4.0,10/20/2014,"Pretty good service here, I've had my share of very bad experiences with the food quality but they have been able to give me reasons to comeback again, the jalapeno burger is a must at this restaurant, always order take out since it's really loud in here, overall great food and pretty good service with the take out server."
Cindy W.,"Millbrae, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/18/2014,"I just came back from Bj's, I went two of my friends. The food was okay but I didn't really like the service. I didn't really like the service because this asian lady didn't want to separate our checks into 3 and told us just to put the money in there. So we ask another waitor if he can do it for us he said no our waitress has to do it and we also told him one of us is paying in card. She came back and we ask her again but she said to write down our total from each of us. We put in our money and she took it and she only gave us part of the changes. I even checked on my phone."
