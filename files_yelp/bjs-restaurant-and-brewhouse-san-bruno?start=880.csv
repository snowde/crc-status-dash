Jocelyn T.,"Hercules, CA",363,807,1133,3.0,10/6/2010,"Came here on a Friday night after a conference and I was famished. Usually on a Friday night especially after 8pm, the wait for a table is usually 45 min or longer so my boyfriend and I opted for the bar area to get a seat.  Trying to eat healthy, I ended up ordering shrimp tacos with chips and my boyfriend ordered the deep dish pizza size S. After I wolfed down my shrimp tacos, I was still hungry so I ate some of the deep dish pizza. The pizza was actually surprisingly good. The red peppers in the shaker bottle was uber hot, just the way I like it.  The only thing that made my experience lose a star was their satellite music kept going in and out because of the wind. It was quite annoying, otherwise I would come back again"
Elise S.,"San Jose, CA",2,74,2,2.0,10/17/2014,"Went here with my boyfriend last night and watched the Giant's game. We didn't see our server for about 40 minutes after we got our food. It wasn't like she was walking back and forth very busy, which I can definitely sympathize with having been a server myself. I didn't even see her at all, so we weren't sure if she went on break or forgot about us or what, which guests shouldn't have to wonder. Finally we got boxes and a dessert menu, but I had to go to the front to ask for a manager to help. The manager said she would pay for the dessert for us, but I got the bill and the dessert was still on there. I don't really mind if they don't offer to take anything off the bill, but at least do it when you say you will. Really poor service...the only reason I'll come back is for the food."
Khalif P.,"El Cerrito, CA",0,14,,4.0,8/16/2012,"BJ's is that place you visit when you wanna watch the game and drink beer while eating overpriced, but pretty decent food.  I usually enjoy myself when I visit this location (up until the bill arrives  ) The customer service is always top notch which is a huge factor in me making the trip all the way out here on Bart. The pizza is pretty darn good and the Jeremiah Red Beer will absolutely have you feeling right after your meal.  Shout out to Vladimir(i think that was his name, Jeremiah Red people!) for his great customer service! 4 stars"
Peta B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",15,34,2,2.0,3/2/2013,"Within minutes of being here, it became clear that this is the type of place that does not think much of it's clientele, so the staff doesn't feel the need to try very hard.  We ended up in the area and needed to grab a casual dinner.  We figured, you can't go wrong with a BJ's.  Well, we learned that you can. We got drinks at the bar while we waited for a table.  The bartender made 4 pomegranate martinis and topped them off with a clear liquid when they came up short.  I assumed the clear liquid was tequila but it turned out to be extra syrup.  The drinks were unbearably sweet and a complete disaster.  The service didn't get any better from there.  The food was mostly ok. Skip this one.  We've all experienced better!"
Aubria T.,"San Francisco, CA",44,14,14,3.0,4/8/2013,"Tasty food and very reasonable prices.  Sports bar type vibe. Watch the game, hang out with friends or quick bite to eat after shopping."
Allan A.,"Daly City, CA",10,68,151,3.0,8/22/2014,The stars are all for the service that i got ive been coming here for a long time and this is the first  i came in for lunch i ordered arugula salad with yellow bits let me let you guys know that it was the worse salad experience i ever had my entire life and im talking about from all the places ive been around the globe first salad that came in it looks like it was sitting for a long time the second time the arugula are all stale and yellow color plus forgot the dressing good thing this place have good server to cover the food because if it is not for the service i got today from the waiter i will never come back to this place
Joylne C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/11/2015,"Two thumbs up for our server Edward, he was very attentive at our lunch yesterday.  My father has Celiac and can't have any gluten and when we let our server know this he was very attentive and followed our order from start to finish.  Many times the server will take your order and someone else delivers it.  Not Edward, he made sure my father was well taken care of.  Thank you Edward."
Phill E.,"San Francisco, CA",4,64,11,2.0,1/12/2013,"This place has sadly declined in quality. Tonight was the first time in several months that i had visited, and decided to order take-out for the family. We had the Mediterranean pizza, 1 order of the wings, kids spaghetti with marinara sauce and kids chicken tenders. As soon as we arrived (~15 min after calling in) we were greeted by the take-out cashier, we paid for our food and went on our way. Opening the pizza box, to my dismay, was a pizza that looked very different than the ones I had ordered from there before. Quality was lacking; toppings were clumped together or spread unevenly, the edges had no form and lacked the crispiness they once had, and the pizza was barely cut. The actual key ingredients such as the chicken, were almost nowhere to be found!!! We ordered a large pizza and i could fit all of the chicken into the palm of my hand.... The wings had gotten worse as well, they tasted less like chicken and more like the fryer oil they are to be cooked in.  Kids meals....barely any sauce, garlic bread was hard but thank God for kids who aren't picky with their food. The kids chicken tenders were alright. Not sure if i'll return for the food if this is their new level of quality but i will return during happy hour for drinks!"
Kim S.,"Terrell, TX",4,25,,2.0,10/7/2015,"Seriously disappointed.  The place smelled like stale beer and .  Our waiter was absent most of the time we were there, food and drinks were delivered by other waitstaff.  Our food arrived before our drinks did."
Erica L.,"San Carlos, CA",158,428,90,4.0,3/11/2012,"I like their pizzas, especially the bbq chicken and great white. I recently tried their new portabello mushroom pizza and that was good too. -meatloaf! is really good here. I ordered that for the longest time, but I think i ate it too often.  -fries are great here. i like both their crispy thin and wedges! so hard to decide! -artichoke dip is always great appetizer to share with friends.  -BEER- im not a beer drinker but i do like BJ's light beers. Cocktails here are not worth it. its so small. -pizookie.... so Fattening!!! but so good! i love the which choc macadamian nut!! Service is okay. Sometimes too slow.  This is a great sports bar, I came here one time to watch a Giants game and they let us sit there for 3 hours! But if you want to catch the game. come early to get a table, it gets pretty crazy!"
Amy F.,"San Bruno, CA",0,8,,5.0,11/5/2014,"My son and I meet every Tuesday for dinner.  For the last three visits we have had an exceptional experience eating in the bar area with Alicia as our server.  I am one that usually alters the menu and demands a more customized selection.  By visit number two,  Alicia had it down and on the third visit I didn't even need to tell her.  She is awesome!  Love the food, love the atmosphere and especially love the service!"
Eleanor E.,"San Mateo, CA",290,89,54,4.0,10/9/2012,"A couple friends and I decided to come here after watching a movie on Friday morning.  It wasn't too busy so we were seated right away.  Our server arrived at our table at a reasonable time and asked for beverages, then about 5 minutes later he came back with our drinks. (The cream soda tastes amazing, by the way). He forgot to ring in our appetizer because I noticed that he didn't write anything down until he started taking our orders.  No worries, we still wanted the calimari after our meals. Oh, and the kitchen had an extra pizookie so he gave it to us :D"
Adel H.,"Daly City, CA",1,92,2,2.0,9/26/2014,"Service was pretty horrible.  How many times do I have to repeat myself to get something?  I told the server like 4 times for a to-go box and eventually got it.  He told me he would bring me back more water, but did that happen? Haha no.  No refill during the whole dinner.  The fresh Atlantic salmon was decent (hence the 1 extra star).  Everything else fails."
Nicole V.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/27/2015,"I ordered a cheeseburger and it was delicious! Our server was so kind and willing to make our dining experience memorable. I got the Irish root beer, which is Irish whiskey, root beer, and Irish cream all in a big chilled mug. Its to die for. I will definitely be back to this restaurant and recommend tit to my family and friends. Thanks guys!"
Jamie G.,"San Francisco, CA",34,45,984,4.0,10/21/2012,Sucky service but their chicken lettuce wraps and red velvet pizookie are BOMB.
Richard H.,"Fontana, CA",1,8,,2.0,9/16/2014,The maui glazed pork chop was dry and the service was slow for the restaurant not being busy on a Monday night.  I have eaten at many other B.J. and normally love the pork chop.
Elle N.,"San Francisco, CA",26,12,,2.0,2/12/2014,"The boyfriend and I decided to come here since we haven't been here in awhile. Was seated really fast, and food came out within 10 minutes. Why the 2 stars? 1 star for bring seated quickly, 1 star for the quickness of the food coming out. We waited about 30 minutes to get the check and maybe order dessert. I was planning on getting the pizookie but I guess I'm not. So many waiters have come and gone and not one of them asks us if we want the bill or if we want to order dessert. We saw many of the other waiters check up on their tables but we were totally ignored. We didn't even know where our waiter went. We've definitely had better service before. Would we come back? Don't know... Poor service."
Lethe S.,"Knightsen, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/16/2014,"Food is good.Service is ok. Womens bathroom is always durty, smelly and never seems to be clean every time I had to go there. I didn't feel like eating any more after I go back to my table. Yeeeecccckkk. So disgusting! Health Hazzard!"
Shannon T.,"South San Francisco, CA",226,54,5,1.0,11/28/2013,"I read the negative reviews on Yelp before going to BJ's yesterday afternoon for lunch with a friend and her 2 kids (both under the age of 4)... I was disgusted! We sat for over 25 minutes before having to wave down a waiter to take our order and then waited another 30 minutes for it to come... In the meantime, a few of the runners delivered her son his ""mini sliders"" meal. He picked up one to begin eating and they then realized that they had brought the order to the wrong table. They took the plate back and we watched them bring it to another incorrect table before finding the correct one. I had to go and find a booster seat myself and felt the customer service was awful! I felt bad for our waiter because it was not his fault... This place is disorganized and completely unprepared for big crowds which I would imagine happens daily... I would never go back!"
Oliver D.,"San Francisco, CA",87,68,58,4.0,10/29/2009,"YES! I'm a fan! And yes this place is a mainstream kinda restaurant, but they have pretty good food! Not everything on the menu is worthy of my praise but I gotta say, the deep dish pizzas are not too bad!  The chicken wings are tasty, but the reason why I go here is for the dessert! CAN you say PIZOOoooooKieeee!  If it's your first time here and you appreciate the pleasures of beer, its wise to try their beer sampler.  My only complaint about this place is that it gets really crowded during dinner hours with a usual wait time of 30 minutes."
