Cindy R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,21,,4.0,7/15/2013,Good place. Nice staff but there's a high turnover for some reason.  Very busy place and never had issues with our service animal.  We are regulars and like the food but some stuff can be too salty at times.
Joe L.,"Millbrae, CA",202,148,11,1.0,1/9/2012,"Not a full house but somehow being seated right next to the bar it takes 15 minutes to get a pitcher. It took over 20 minutes for the appetizers to ariive, but there was neither a nofication or apology for the wait. It gets worse, ladies and gents. When it finally comes, the appetizers were lukewarm, obviously from just sitting there for some time. The hyped promotional and cold boneless chicken wings were the size of a fifty cent coin, I kid you not. What a waste of 9 bucks. By far the most worst promotional item I have ever seen and eaten at a chain restaurant.  You know it's bad when you think the check would be the fastest thing to get back, but even that took another 10 minutes after I raised my hand like I was in school. It will be a long long time before I return. Geez what happened to this place. It used to be ok but now it's easily the worst BJ's in a 30 mile radius. I get it you're busy so the service can be forgiveable, but terrible food is a no no."
Lisa R.,"Daly City, CA",4,37,,1.0,12/11/2013,"If you're going here to watch a game, just eat somewhere else before you go, even if you go through a fast food drive through you'll be better off.  I'd been here a few times before this most recent dismal experience, so I knew to keep expectations low, but it was so bad I just have to warn people.  My boyfriend wanted to go somewhere to watch a game that wouldn't be on our home channels.   Just stick with beer for drinks.  My bf ordered a margarita that was so bad, it tasted like the cheapest powered lemonade mix and tasted so weird and artificial he sent it back for a mojito which also tasted like a cheap mix and you could tell they didn't muddle it, just threw a few mint leaves in there.   The food was worse; it seems worse every time I go to a BJ's.  Everything tasted like it had been sitting under a warmer for at least an hour.  My fish tacos were basically tortillas with some gross mayonaise sauce, and the grilled fish was one piece about as big as my pinky finger.  No kidding, it was like they put one really tiny fish stick in each taco.  No flavor.  Served with that awful fake guacamole, just horrible.   The server was trying to get us out as fast as possible because it was busy.  She pushed for our dessert order while my bf was still eating his meal. I will never go back to BJ's ever again if I can help it."
Paul O.,"San Jose, CA",3,18,,1.0,1/17/2014,"This individual BJ's is by far the absolute worst franchised resturant/bar that I have ever been to. If you are the manager, supervisor, or owner of this place - please keep reading this review, and know that you should never EVER think that you are running your business well.  EVERY PART OF THE EXPERIENCE AT THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE. My girlfriend and I went here just last night, around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. It wasn't busy, there was no line waiting for seats, and there were open tables through the resturant. We chose to sit at the bar area, at one of the two-top tall tables, in order to get served a little more rapidly, as well as get drinks quicker. We sat, and sat, and sat, and waited, and watched as many waiters, waitresses, bussers, and pretty much everyone walked by our table. No one said anything to us about being right with us, offering us water, menu's, drinks, nothing. Even the bartender, who was not more than four feet away from us, who was staring right at us, NEVER asked us if we needed or wanted anything. It was seriously about 10 mins before our waitress came up to our table with menus - and no I'm not exaggerating, the basketball game was on, we were watching it, and the full commercial breaks,and more game, and more commercials, while waiting for service... When our waitress came she was very nice - this was the ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS RESTURANT. She took our drink order - my girl got some pink cadillac cocktail, and I simply ordered a dirty martini. We also asked for the fried calamari appetizer, and we'd continue looking at the menu. When the drinks came, I sipped mine and immediately knew that someone screwed it up. I'm going to tell you something that may come as a shock - a martini is made with GIN... NOT VODKA. If I ordered a vodka martini, then I'd want vodka in it. When someone orderes a martini - that means GIN. Now, I understand that some people who order drinks may not know that, so it is up to the servers and barkeeps to specify gin or vodka if they think the person ordering it might be too stupid to know what is in a real martini. Also on the martini, a dirty martini means that you add some olive juice to the gin and vermouth as well, not just THREE OLIVES in the glass. (In case you were wondering, yes three olives is excessive for a martini) Now on to the calamari which came shortly after the drinks. They were overly fried (almost burned), and not seasoned with salt at all. In fact, the breading on it was so bland it made flour look spicy. The two dipping sauces which come with calamari are supposed to be tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Guess what we were given!! MOTHERFUCKING RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE.  Let me re-iterate that for you: RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE INSTEAD OF TARTAR AND COCKTAIL SAUCE. What kind of stupid ass, dumb fucks do you have plating in that kitchen? Next up our meal came. We ordered a buffalo burger and the ahi salad. When we ordered it, we asked for an extra plate so that we could split the two in half and share them. No extra plate came with our food. The dipshit that brought us the food asked us if we needed anything else, I asked for some horseradish dipping sauce, or something similar. He said no problem. He never came back. With no extra plate, I scraped the crap-salad off the plate with the burger onto a different, dirty plate (more on that later), and we made do with the rest. The burger was mediocre at best. There was very littly ""buffalo"" sauce on the burger, only a sliver of onion on it, and a single leaf of lettuce. The patty looked like a pre-packaged patty that you tear the paper off and slap on the grill when you don't care about quality. In all, the burger was sub-par. The salad, which should have been stupid simple was also screwed up. The ahi, which should have had a brief sear on it, was overly seared, though at least seasoned well. What completely ruined this plate was the wasabi paste on it. Now, I can handle spice - and I love wasabi. This shit was so in-edible, that you even put a small bit on the ahi, and you are tearing up. It ruined everything that it touched. Which was awesome, because some bites of sald would not have any on it (which was nice) and others would send me looking for my non-existent water glass. Which, btw, there was no water glass. Oh, and the shit cocktails were empty just after starting the meal. Nice, huh? The kicker of all this, was the dirty ass tables directly next to us. They were piled with trash, and dirty dishes the ENTIRE TIME WE WERE THERE. They didn't start bussing them until we were leaving - don't forget that this place WAS NOT BUSY! NO EXCUSE FOR THIS. This whole experience only cost me a little over sixty dollars.  I'd like to extend a very healthy FUCK YOU to the management team and owners of this establishment for allowing this kind of stupidity and complete lack of service that we got. I hope you loose money, and go out of business."
Patricia G.,"Emeryville, CA",68,325,20,2.0,10/27/2011,"You know, I get it.  It's a family restaurant, it's busy and all but really??  Ten minutes to get your server's attention after sitting down is not acceptable ANYWHERE.  Then it takes you another 10 minutes to grab your server for extra croutons.  Granted she got it to you right away but man...  **woosaaahh** Lunch time? Man I hope you have more than an hour.  The service doesn't get any better in the afternoon.  Again, it gets busy but shouldn't you expect that?  The prices obviously are almost split in half.  But, if you only have an hour, you're gonna be cutting it close. Late night eats.  Decent place.  Price?  Well, again I say, late night eats.  Where else are you going to go other than the Jack in a Box drive thru?  I don't mind paying the money but the service is ridiculous.   Happy Hours are a plus.  I think it's from 3-7p at the bar location only which is fair and then again from 10p to close.  Watch out for the table stalkers, but don't worry, they just literally want your table and nothing else. Pazookie.  YES.  They've opened it up to quite a few more options.  Made me feel like I was at cheesecake factory on which one I was going to order.  Red Velvet, Oreo, Chocolate Ghirardelli Fudge... the fat list went on and on and one... must if you're up for the 1600+ calorie dessert, GO FOR IT!"
Michal W.,"Burlingame, CA",1,7,,5.0,6/25/2013,Eating here for years-certified GF menu! Just had the best Ribeye steak ever (perfectly seasoned and cooked!)-I ate at 615pm-prime time and packed. But was greated in 2 minutes and given super service by Brandon T-he notified a Floor Manger I had ordered GF-who oversaw the prep of the dish-dinner got to me in under 15 minutes during their busiest time-you guys always do it right!! See you soon- Michal
Ashley J.,"Dallas, TX",79,270,40,2.0,5/29/2012,"I love BJ's Restaurants... just not this one. The food is always a solid bet and the beer is fantastic. I love the atmosphere, especially when a local team is playing and the games are on.  I was there for lunch on Memorial Day Monday and seriously waited 15 minutes for WATER. It was another 10 minutes for a pint of beer. It was busy, but not out of control busy so the fact that it was 35 minutes for our food to come out was basically unacceptable."
Anthony S.,"London, United Kingdom",0,2,,1.0,8/30/2015,"Waited 45 minutes for a pickup order when I was told 15 minutes,and was told it would be 10-15 more   they clearly never took my order and tried to pass it off.the manager didn't really seem to care when I told him I was going across the street to jacks."
Lindsay C.,"Daly City, CA",0,10,1,1.0,3/6/2014,"Called ahead of time to put our name on the list. When we arrived they told us to wait 20 minutes. A little over 20 minutes went by so I asked and they said we'd have to wait another 20 minutes. After waiting and waiting over 20 min. I asked how long and they said 15 minutes. A party of 6 of us decided to leave. It's too bad you couldn't  stick to your words. Never coming back, this was ridiculous."
Katie W.,"San Francisco, CA",48,14,,2.0,2/16/2013,"Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse used to be a lot better; however, in the last few months, it seems they have dropped the ball in the service department. First off, I do love the actual facility as far as set-up, decor, and atmosphere.  It always seems to be packed with patrons and the hosts at the front are friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, the service here has gotten pretty crappy lately.  My go to items to order are the California Club pizza & the Red Velvet Pazzokie.  Both are usually great.  My fiancé and I have eaten there/ordered food from there maybe 4 times in the last 3 months.  The last time I ordered the California club pizza there was extra flour caked onto the bottom of my pizza, it was gross.  Service was alright.   3rd to last time we were in there was the worst.  We dinned in at the Brewhouse this night.  It took 5 minutes for us to even be greeted by our server, who then disappeared for an additional 5 minutes without even taking our drink order.  After sitting there for 15+ minutes, we finally ordered drinks.  My fiancé ordered a steak and I ordered shrimp kabobs and a lobster tail.  When our food arrived, mine was cold.  Now I've been a server at numerous restaurants and I know how tough the job is, and it takes a lot for me to actually complain about something.  This is the first time I have ever actually had to ask the waitress to take my food back to be warmed up.  My fiancé was nearly finished with his food before I got to begin eating mine.  Thats just not acceptable when you're spending $80+ on a dinner at BJ's (which is a lot for this place).  We clearly weren't a priority on this night. 2nd to last time, was mid december of 2012.  We ordered the curbside take-out for the first time.  It was simple enough to order online and the wait time wasn't too long.  We ordered a personal pizza, the meatball app., and the gormet Mac n' cheese.  I was very disappointed with the mac n' cheese.  The bacon in the mac n' cheese was burnt to a black crisp.  It tasted disgusting!  The worst part, is that someone clearly didn't care that they were putting charcoal into my dinner...  I tried to pick out as much of the bacon as I could and tried to eat around it. The last time we ordered food was Feb. 14th, 2013.  We ordered the curbside take out again online.  We ordered about $45+ of food, including one of their baked potatoes.  When my fiancé went to pick up the food about 40 minutes later, he arrived to find out they had no potatoes left.  They had made the rest of the food; however, never called to inform us that we needed to choose a substitute, so I didn't get dinner.  My dinner ended up being the pizookie, they gave us for free (which we had already ordered) to make up for it.  There is no excuse for not calling to get a substitute choice, for 40 minutes!   Seems as though this place may have a high turn-over rate of servers.  Whatever the problem is, I'm to the point where I'm simply going to go over to Jack's for dinner.  They have never gotten our orders wrong, left us sitting at the table with no greeting, and the food is always great & also affordable!  BJ's needs to step up their game, they are displaying a message of ""We are trying to accomodate for more patrons than we can handle, so some may suffer.""  Not worth it to me."
Jay H.,"Florence, KY",270,235,175,3.0,1/23/2012,"BJ, Not to bad for a chain food restaurant Brewery. Good place to watch the 49's vs the Giants in the play off 2012 I first order there light draft beer. Not to bad of a taste. We order the sampler it had 4 avocado rolls were very good. Would order this again. The spring rolls and the cheese sticks were OK. Artichoke dip with chips was also OK. Next time I would only order the avocado rolls.  The main part of the meal was really good. The cheese burger Pizza. Never ever had that. The crust was really good topping had pickles on it and ground beef peppers onions. Overall above average for a chain brewery. Would go there again to watch one football. Like the atmosphere."
Ray K.,"Charlotte, NC",38,10,,4.0,10/14/2015,Stopped in at this place while at the mall. Great eatery with tons of TVs! This is a premier spot for Sunday football in the area.
Katarina F.,"Walnut, CA",257,58,72,4.0,4/30/2014,"Whenever I'm craving good simple wings, I always want to go to a bjs because their wings are super delicious! I. Would highly recommend their Oreo pizookie because it is simply to die for!"
Mac C.,"San Bruno, CA",2,5,,5.0,3/14/2015,Great place for a sit-down dinner with friends and family or if you just want a quick pizookie. Our server Jessica was also very friendly and displayed exquisite expertise when it came to our questions about the menu. Fire
Leanne P.,"Milpitas, CA",346,800,158,4.0,6/1/2012,"This BJ's is a fairly busy one so everyone needs to understand--you're going to have to wait! I went here with my brother when our parents' flight got delayed.  We realized we had over an hour to kill.  We were both a little hungry so we decided to check out BJ's.  We've been to BJ's before, but this was our first time at this location.  There were a LOT of people waiting, so I was pleasantly surprised when we got a table for two in less than 10 minutes.  I loved the layout--its a smaller location (because its attached to the mall) but they had a lot of ""mini-booths"" that just sit 2 people.   Bro and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza and a tomato and mozzerella small salad.  I also ordered a root beer.  OMG everything was soooooooooooo yummy!  The service was super quick and our food was scrumptious!   I was only sad because I didn't have room for pizookie :("
Raysh P.,"Mission, San Francisco, CA",21,9,1,2.0,8/5/2014,Walked in here and sat down for about 20mins before a waiter said anything to us... And when someone did come he was just walking by not even a waiter in our section.. I think his name was mike he was coo.. Let this place be your last option to eat.. Shitty service just because about 8 waiters/waitresses walked passed us without saying a word.. Except mike only why I'm giving this place 2stars.. Food was alright 4.5/10
Sarah C.,"Redwood City, CA",335,284,124,1.0,8/31/2011,"What happened to this BJ's? I've been to other  BJ's and trust me their food is better and they're 10x cleaner. Ate here yesterday for lunch with my friend. The table we were seated at was dirty. The staff just wiped off the table but failed to check the floor. Food, utensils, dirty napkins you name it, it was on the floor of our table. I didn't want to make a big deal about it so I used my shoe to scoot all the junk to the side. Then we opened up our napkins to find dirty utensils. Old dried up bits of food were stuck to my fork. Yuck! The food itself was bland and nothing special. The wedge salad was watery and my grilled chicken and broccoli pasta had no flavor. The only thing that tasted okay was the fried calamari appetizer. Not returning to this location. Even a pizookie couldn't save this place. The location in San Mateo Bridgepointe is cleaner and for some reason has better quality food."
Elisabeth S.,"Napa, CA",0,1,,4.0,9/6/2015,"This is our first visit to BJ's Brewhouse, we had a fabulous deep dish pizza (BJ's Favorite!) and wonderful service from our waiter, Jimmy. Jimmy absolutely made our evening with his skill and kindness. In talking my husband mentioned my birthday was last week and Jimmy gave us a celebratory pizookie a-la-mode! I had no idea what this was, but it sounded absolutely delicious (amaze-balls) and we truly appreciated the gesture. Three cheers for BJ's San Bruno - especially Jimmy! Thank you for my birthday candle!"
Lisa K.,"San Francisco, CA",85,1046,21,2.0,5/8/2012,"We had take out at a work event, so I didn't have to deal with a wait, but also didn't get to have beer. The food has a fairly nasty Applebeeish vibe to it - everything is saltier and greasier than it needs to be. I personally found the 'pizookie' to not be worth eating and the avocado eggrolls were an abominable waste of an oddly decent avocado. The best I can say might be that the jambalaya was edible. I'll avoid this restaurant in the future."
Vika K.,"Hayward, CA",50,12,24,2.0,8/1/2014,"Service was horrible. It took our server 20 minutes to serve our drinks. Our table did not have silverware on the table. Our server was very slow, I don't know her name but she only checked up on our table twice. Appetizer (artichoke dip) was cold. They need a new manager or something. Other BJ's have better service."
