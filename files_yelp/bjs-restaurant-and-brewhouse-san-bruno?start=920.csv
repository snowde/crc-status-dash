Danny F.,"San Bruno, CA",43,160,60,2.0,5/22/2014,"Only ""ok"" thing was my pasta & it was overprived being $15. First of have been to this restaurant many many times its either a horrible miss or a awesome hit. It doesn't matter my experience should be consistantly good. First of I ordered Pasta with a side wedge Salad. All our food came out at the same time & my Wedge Saled never came. Our waitress totally abandoned us didnt get it till 20 mins after I had to ask again.....Cristal P you stink at your job im sorry. It wasnt just the service that was unpleaent. The pasta lacked quantity for the hefty $15 price tag I paid. The soda didnt taste good. Which is odd cause thier soda is known for being the best. Id recommend Chillis or Maxs instead of Bjs."
Adlyn S.,"South San Francisco, CA",176,113,35,3.0,1/19/2012,"BJ's is like that ex-fling that you just keep on going back to for convenience. It hits the spot when needed ;) lol And it's named BJ's?! There's way too many ""That's what she said"" jokes for me to handle right now lol. Ok now on to the real review. The servers here are great and my food always comes out in a timely manner. The avocado egg rolls, deep dish pizzas, and pizookies with a cold beer makes up a typical yet fulfilling BJ's meal. You really can't go wrong with that combo. I have to dock off a star from my recent front of desk experience. Usually when you walk up to the front desk with a hostess doing nothing, you'd expect a ""Hello! How can I help you?"" instead of a *blank stare* followed with me (THE DAMN PATRON) saying, ""Hi, I have a table for 3"" Clueless hostess, ""There's a 45 minute wait. *blank stare*"" So to the 17 to 20 something blank-faced Asian hostess, please remember that you're the first face I see when I walk into your establishment and possibly the last so you better be thankful for my business! Btw, it is a mall so I might have been willing to walk around and wait the 45 minutes instead of  going across the street to Jack's instead. I really hope I don't see her pulling the same schtick again."
Renata P.,"San Francisco, CA",224,80,1,3.0,9/29/2012,Ok the fact I expect a manufactured experience in any chain aside... The pot roast was pretty good minus the fact the vegetables were undercooked. The meat was tender. The sauce flavor filled. If they had only cooked the vege's in with the meat it would have been perfect. Instead it was sad.  I had a cocktail with my meal. The black raspberry margarita.... It was an interesting flavor which could have used less squirts of the manufactured raspberry syrup. I would have preferred they made their own syrup actually. Yes my palette can tell the difference.  Overall an ok experience. If in the area again I might come back.
Leanne K.,"San Francisco, CA",269,79,1192,3.0,1/17/2010,"I've been here since it first opened when they were giving out free meals to train their wait staff. All the waiters have changed and I think they need another training session. That's probably the worst part about it, some of the staff are just rude, I don't need someone to be passive-aggressive. It's almost like there's too much going on, they are overloaded and they don't care anymore either.  The line, the wait to actually sit down is horrible. Be ready to wait an hour or longer. Yesterday we got there at 5:25pm, sat at 6:10pm. We thought 5:25 was early, we kind of beat the rush that came after us. Even if you aren't hungry, go early you'll still have to wait, by the time you sit you'll be starving. TIP: get a pager and stand by the bar if your party is willing to sit there, they have a row of cushioned seats and tall tables that you can sit at. If you see a party almost done, go stand next to that table and SWOOP once they get out from their seats. It's brutal. You don't have to wait to be seated if you sit there. Then give the pager back and say you found a seat at the bar. Then you're covered just in case. Ok, now to the food. I had their New BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich which was really good. When i first saw it, it was covered in beer battered onion rings, I was thinking, ""where's the pork?"" It was there, good flavor and it's big. Served with a fresh coleslaw and either wedge-cut or skinny fries.  Sister got my usual, the Angel Hair Toscana with chicken (or shrimp). The pasta is good here. if you aren't in to oil, don't order pasta, it's very shiny, if you know what I mean. Very big portions so come ready to eat. Friends got the Jambalaya and the Cajun Pasta. Friend said the Jambalaya was too salty. From the bite that I took, it was eh, nothing popped in my mouth. The Cajun pasta was very shiny but my friend wasn't  impressed. After awhile he thought it was too spicy. Depending on your tolerance for spicy food. Oh the handcrafted root beer here is good. It's not so carbonated and you get free refills. If you like carbonation this isn't the drink for you. If you want beer but you can't choose from their selection, just get the sampler, you get to try everything (I think 6), about 6 oz or more of each. It might be a lot so if you have friends, share with them. In the end we ordered the Trio Pizookie. Three mini pizookies so we could try the flavors. We got the Chocolate Chunk, White Macadamia, and the Triple Ghiradelli Chocolate. After eating all the food before I'm glad we ordered the minis. Between 5 of us that was good for us, but it depends on how much your party wants, if you're still not full and you love desserts get the regular size or share the party platter (HUGE).  I always come back, but not that often, but if you want to watch a sports game or just hang out at the bar, it's a fun place. It's pretty loud in there too, so be aware if you wanted something more intimate, this isn't your place."
Gary G.,"San Diego, CA",2,2,,1.0,7/28/2015,"Last night I got into SFO late so I went by this BJs for dinner. They were fairly busy so I opted for a table in the bar. After sitting there for 10 min I was finally asked if I wanted something to drink. I ordered my drink and food at the same time. Tired from traveling I did not want this to take very long.  Drink and food came in a reasonable amount of time but my baked potato was cold. Hungry and tired I just ate. I noticed that the table next to mine sent several items back that were either cold or undercooked. I then waiting almost 20 min after I was done to get my check. I gave the waiter my card right away. Once I did it took another 10 min for him to bring the bill back for me to sign. At this point I just wanted to leave. In my haste, I walked off and left my sunglasses. Today I called around noon to see if I could pick them up. I called and was put on hold for nearly 20 min. Finally I hung up. I called back an hour or so later only to get put on hold again for 10 min this time. When I finally did get a response I was told that no my glasses were not found. I told them that I left them there and they should be in a lost and found. Nope. No such thing. No care or concern whatsoever that I lost them in that restaurant. I know I left them on the table so they should be there for me to retrieve. Am I wrong in this? I am disappointed at the amount of time I wasted last night, poor service, cold food, and people that just obviously don't care."
Carolyn S.,"New York, NY",2,12,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Came here on a Sunday at 5 and the initial interaction with the hostesses who ignored my brother to finish a conversation among themselves for several minutes shoould have been our first clue to not bother- but we ate here anyway.  We order food for 3 adults and 1 child.  The food comes for the three adults- but not the child.  My salad had a huge hair on it, so I immediately send it back with the same person who brought it over.  Fast forward 10 minutes- no waitress and no food for myself or my nephew.  I ask a waiter to go get our waitress. he returns a couple minutes later and asks what her name is. She never said, so we did not know, but cant you figure that out? She finally comes over- still with no food- and no apology or explanation. I ask for a manager. A woman walks over and is very nice and says she will go check. She walks away and doesnt come back.  Now a soup that was also missing arrives- still no salad sans hair, and no kids meal.  The missing food finally comes (its been about 20 minutes and the other two adults are basically done eating).  Another manager comes over and apologizes, gets us more water (we had needed water for a majority of this time) and makes adjustments to the check while promising our server will be attentive to us the rest of the meal. he was very nice and I appreciated his apology and check adjustment.  However the waitress did not come back, and when it was time for the check a waiter comes over and says she has gone on break but he will get the check.  Really?? The food was decent but certainly not worth the hassle.  As much fun as it is to make a two year old wait for his food for 20 minutes after his parents both have food and to receive a salad with hair in it, Ill pass next time and take my business elsewhere."
Dessert F.,"San Jose, CA",2,16,,1.0,1/19/2014,Recently moved to the area and went to BJs a few times within the first month. Our dine in experiences were pretty good but takeout experiences have been terrible!! Food for two people took a full hour longer than quoted over the phone.  Order was incomplete for 30 minutes while they waited for a side of steamed veggies. Staff were polite but were clearly overwhelmed because the 3 orders around me were also incorrect. It appears communication between the staff is lacking and all they offered me was a soda while I waited. And that came after I'd been standing there for a hour beyond the expected pickup time. We'll eat at any of the other local restaurants before returning.  Oh and avoid the berry cobbler. It looks and tastes like it came from an easy bake oven. Yuck!!!
Kristine K.,"San Francisco, CA",184,108,113,4.0,6/22/2011,Their grilled chicken pasta is so good! I love how they give a generous portion so that you always have leftovers. Their pizookies are to die for and the service is great. There are TV's all around so that you'll never miss a game.
Lily W.,"San Francisco, CA",128,9,,3.0,10/24/2013,"I came here twice in one week because of a Google Offer deal that offers a 3 course meal for 2 for $19.95. (It's still going on. Expires: Nov. 11. 2013) The 3 courses include your choice of soup/salad, medium pizza, and a pizookie! What a steal!  First time: Although I wasn't really in the mood for pizza, I was excited to eat at BJ's for the first time because I have been wanting to try the much raved about pizookie. My verdict after the meal: it was just....ok. FOOD: Soups: Clam chowder and Mexican tortilla. Before I mention taste...why was my soup lukewarm? It should be hot! On to taste:Clam chowder was tasty and had nice chunks of clams. Mexican tortilla was too salty.  Pizza: Deep dish BBQ Ranch chicken. I don't like dip dish, but the pizza was pretty good.I actually wouldn't even call it deep dish, because it was more of a thick bread with a semi-thick topping.  Pizookie: Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top. I can see why people like it because it was tasty, but it was way too sweet for me. I couldn't finish it.  DRINKS: Beer: 8 samplers, including the seasonal pumpkin flavored beer. They make their own beer! My favorite was the oasis and blondie, while my sister liked the piranha.  SERVICE: Where is my water??? My server seemed to have forgotten to bring my table water, so I asked the next server walking by for some water. He jokingly commented: ""So you must be thirsty"" before leaving to get my water ""Uhhh, yeah I'm thirsty. I have been sitting here for over 10 minutes without water"" is what I said in my head. He came back with ONE cup of water while my sister sitting across from me eyed me with disbelief. You're kidding me, right?! Another thing is that the waiter forgot to bring our to-go boxes after our meal. He only brought our boxes over after he saw my sister eyeing him with boxes in hand for another table while walking by.  Despite the mediocre service and food, I went back two days later with my sister and parents because it's still a good deal! The second time around, the food was still mediocre but the service was much better. Our server was very attentive despite making some mistakes. She gave us the wrong order. We ordered the BBQ chicken hand-tossed pizza and realized it was the buffalo chicken pizza after taking a bite, but we decided to keep it anyway since we already took a big chunk from the pizza. She also forgot to apply the discount at the end, but she realized her mistake before I spoke when she saw my phone in hand and apologized for it. We forgave her for her mistakes because our food came in a timely manner, she made sure we were enjoying our food and cleaned up the extra plates taking up space on the table without asking. As for the food that day, there isn't much to add, except to GET THE CRISPY POTATO SKINS!! I A bit pricey for an appetizer, but I loveee potatoes and these were perfect!   Overall, I probably will come here only when there is a deal."
Karl B.,"San Francisco, CA",104,19,,2.0,4/22/2014,"Food is not exciting , environment sucks. Waitress gave water to 2 other groups before serving me and my girlfriend who were seated 5 minutes before the other groups. Not a fan of this place."
Gibson J.,"Daly City, CA",56,40,9,1.0,10/7/2012,"Food service has taken a huge downfall.  Instead of explaining my very long story I will say this briefly.  Orders came in cold, the lettuce wrap was soggy.  The wrap could of been on the hot plate for a while, who knows.  We ordered our drinks but it came in a dirty glass.  Who serves Remy in a dirty glass?  I suppose this establishment.  And if you ask them to switch glasses, they give you an excuse to order a new one.  Why?  You serve us a dirty glass you should give us a new glass, not make us pay for a new drink.  Why do you switch waiters during a service, and having the second person covering not having a clue what we ordered?  Apparently this place since they can't remember anything you ordered.they do now remember what you ordered, serving you cold food, and making you wait a very long food.  And asking for a check... Really it takes 30 min for it? Well, with that rant out of the way... The food is either hit or miss... But the service... what happened?  It is just awful.  And yes, we got the manager involved and he comped a lot of our stuff.  But it still doesn't excuse the fact the waitress wanted us to pay for a new Remy when it was served in a dirty glass.  That is just inexcusable."
Yolanda L.,"San Francisco, CA",6,36,184,4.0,8/24/2012,"I love coming here for happy hour! $5 mini pizzas and 1/2 off appetizers!  For appetizers, I recommend: wings, avocado wraps or calamari! Or the sampler! I always leave this place pretty full and satisfied. I only docked a star because sometimes service can be hit or miss."
Bryan L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,29,44,1.0,1/24/2014,"this was the second worstest restaraunt experience i ever had. first, do they not clean there forks, knives and plates? every single one was greasy and had some kind of marks on it. asked waitress to replace it. it was still dirty. ended up using napkins and glass of water to clean them. also every drink we ordered also had greases all over the cup and the drinks. seriously, do u guys not clean them at all? me and my friends just walked out"
Paulina F.,"San Francisco, CA",151,251,743,4.0,3/24/2008,"The food selection is good. I'm very pleased with the clam chowder, baked potatoes, and scampi pasta.  It's a brewery. You can get alcohol, if you're in the mood.  Customer service is superb.  I don't like the noise level. Cozy, this place isn't."
Paula M.,"El Cajon, CA",27,3,,1.0,8/13/2014,"My family and I waited over an hour for a table that was supposed to be available in 30 minutes only to be greeted by the ditziest waitress I've ever had the displeasure of encountering in a food establishment. She took the drink order and then popped by 10 minutes later to say the drinks would be right up, implying that someone else was delivering them. But no, it was her, another 10 minutes later. When she finally took the food order, it started to arrive before we had silverware. I asked for silverware and a glass of ice. She came by to check on us a while later, but didn't bring the silverware or the ice, so we reminded her again, and she asked how many we needed, unbelieveable! She couldn't see? or couldn't count? The food was marginal at best, but it's the lack of service that will keep me from ever returning. This was the first time in my 50+ years that I didn't leave a tip."
Marc W.,"Chicago, IL",81,286,,2.0,10/21/2011,"The best part about this place is the beer.  I ordered one of their samplers and liked most all of the beers.   I ordered a hamburger with fries.  The meat of the hamburger was rather industrial (pre formed, pre frozen in disc form) so I didnt think much of that.  Plus it took a good 45 minutes to come out.  Fries were good though, nice and crispy. The service was characterized by young servers trying hard and doing a pretty good job."
E P.,"Atherton, CA",0,54,,4.0,7/9/2015,"This is a good place for a business lunch.  They have a pretty extensive menu.  I usually order a salad and go during off hours, so I don't know if they get really busy.  I never have to wait for a table after 1:30.  I recommend."
Samantha M.,"San Francisco, CA",458,55,52,4.0,4/29/2014,"I really like the food & beer/ drink selection. If you're hungry & in a hurry don't come here though. Unless you're lucky to snag a seat by the bar, the wait is usually long. Both for a table & for the service. The staff is generally friendly though so that makes up for some of it, & the food & drink options make up for the rest of it. If you work up an appetite shopping or want to snag a happy hour at the mall, it's a good option. I usually just get an appetizer & a drink or two. Wines, beer, martinis, all good options."
Kelly Y.,"San Francisco, CA",243,9,,2.0,8/6/2014,"It is what it is... I got the ""deep dish"" pizza which is more like a thick crust/pan pizza. Most deep dish pizzas have a lot of sauce, but the depth was mostly created by more bread :/ The soup/salad combo seemed like the best deal."
Meghan M.,"Spring, TX",103,31,35,3.0,4/14/2012,"This BJs is a hit and miss for me however my friends and I love coming here to unwind and relax after a long day at work. Last I came here was last week with my sis priscilla and we only ordered our fave pizookies that we were craving so much that week. This place is a great spot to watch sports and talk smack about our boyfriends ha. Lol jk but the staff is so-so, sometimes you get the waiter who disappears for twenty minutes and then remembers to take your order or the one who never comes back to give you a refill or you get the waiter thats on top of her shit ready to order you up a storm lol. so like I said.... hit or miss. Foods awesome never had a complaint... sometimes its crazy packed but what bjs isnt? And prices are reasonable.  I Loooove their pizookies and the stuffed mushrooms. My usual is the grilled chicken pasta or the turkey club. If I am feeling like a fatty I will order the rack of pork ribs. Any way cool place to be with your best friends or fam. The one time I drove over here alone to get a bite to eat was my last because I had some old dude insist that he take me out after lunch and insisted that he walk me back to my car ....that for sure wont ever happen again...but if you decide to come alone thats cool too. 3 stars because the service isnt always on point."
