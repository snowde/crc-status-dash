Marty And D M.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/4/2014,"Hand tossed pizza was a cracker not good not everyone wants to eat deep dish, how about just a good ole pizza thick crust. Bj`s call up a pizza parlor or visit one and see if you can learn how to make pizza. I'd say beer is not that big of a deal you can go anywhere and find beer. Your menu is deceiving the picture shows a hand tossed pizza with a nice crust NOT!!!. you`ll make a lot of money listening to the public."
Jeremy C.,"South San Francisco, CA",60,26,,3.0,2/5/2012,"Do you like waiting an hour and a half for a table?  Well if you do, then you have found the perfect spot for dinner!  Don't worry, if they tell you that you're table will be ready in 30 minutes, you'll get to wait 90 instead.  Gives you plenty of time to go to the Asian store a few stores down and rub some Buddha belly. As for the actual restaurant, we got put in the back on a Friday night.  The waitress was very busy and before getting our drinks or taking our orders, she kept reminding us that she was very busy and would take longer to do her job. I ordered a pizza and a cream soda.  The cream soda is BJ's own concoction which costs $2.99.  The trick is, drink as much as possible.  The idiots that I ate with also ordered drinks but only got maybe 1 refill.  I got 3 refills so my cost per glass turned out to be only 75 cents.  It's like printing cash. The pizza was ok.  I shared a large with a friend and there were a few slices left over.  On that topic, when someone says a couple, what number does that represent?  I always thought a couple meant 2, but having that discussion, other people said that they think a couple stands for 3.  I think they are morons.  End of story. Oh....for the pizza, the waitress couldn't find Parmesan cheese. I don't come here often but when I do, I always regret it."
Liz L.,"Pacifica, CA",43,14,1,3.0,12/18/2011,"I like going to this especially if its game night!!! Even though it gets really packed and crazy, they have tv almost everywhere.  For any other day, the service here varies! Some waiters might be very attentive and others might need to be more attentive.  Food are ok. The smoothes are really good!  Bar: a wide variety of drinks!!! Bartenders are really nice!!"
Rose E.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,,1.0,8/1/2015,"I've been coming Bj's since was newly open, I used to love this place, but now everytime I eat here the service and the food is getting worse. I will not come to Bj's again."
Oleg H.,"San Francisco, CA",208,561,28,3.0,2/27/2010,"""BJ? Sure."" I cant really be too negative here because everything met a certain level of quality. But definitely lacks authenticity, and reeks of corporate try hardism. What else can i say about a restaurant that bills itself as a brewery, has giant brewing vats all over the interior, but trucks its actually microbrewed beer from the more suburban country side locales where real estate's cheaper? Certainly holds the candle to the likes of TGI fridays and Chillis."
Monica M.,"San Diego, CA",67,56,37,3.0,1/26/2012,"Not too sure how to describe BJ's even though I come here pretty often. It's a good place. It's not like a place where you go often because you can't live without it, it's just a good restaurant that's close by and has some good selections. My favorite food to get are their appetizers. I love their avocado egg rolls and potato skins! Pizookies are good too, but I don't get them too often :]. My favorite pizookie is probably the white chocolate macadamia nut or oreo. I just wish they had happy hour. Service can go both ways, but it's typically normal. The prices could be around $8-$12 for an entree. The wait could be long/short depending on the time of day you go. Nights are typically the busiest. But, they do allow you to put your name on waitlist, so that's good."
Jacqueline L.,"Daly City, CA",2,4,,2.0,12/13/2012,"Well,This BJ's is not very good. I've been there twice and the first time I went it was disappointing for several reasons  one of them being bringing me 3 sides of smiley fries in one plate for a total of 6 smiley fries!!! One I mention it to the waitress she said she would bring some more but that never happened. Second time I went I asked for a plate and they gave me a dirty one,I told the waitress  the plate was dirty and she just said: 'oh'   and that's it no I'm sorry or anything. I've been to different BJ's and liked them but this one is not one of them."
Marycathry V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",128,83,25,1.0,10/7/2011,"The customer service here is terrible. I placed a large order for pick-up for myself and all my co-workers and had specifically told the girl over the phone that we only had a photocopy of our boss's credit card and if that would be okay. She put me on a brief hold, then said that it would be fine. I got there about 45 minutes later and waited in the line at the take-out counter. No one acknowleged me, and I even went to the host stand to ask if there was anyone who could help me with my order for pick-up. She just directed me right back to the line I was already in. So I waited another 5 or so minutes until finally someone came back and helped the frustrated customer in front of me. When it was finally my turn, all the bags were set and ready to go, so I handed the girl the photocopy of the credit card. All she says is, ""Ohhh...THAT'S what she meant."" So I said, ""Is there a problem?"" And she says, ""Well, the way she explained it to me made it sound like you had a photocopy of his ID, not his credit card..let me go ask my manager.""  Two minutes later, the manager comes up and says, ""Hi, unfortunately it's our policy that we have to have the credit card present because there's no way of us knowing that that person authorized you to use their card."" Naturally I began to say, ""Okay, well what if I call my boss to have him authorize the transaction.."" But he didn't even let me finish my sentence and cut me off saying, ""Yeahhh...we can't do that either."" I explained to him that I had specifically asked the girl about this over the phone before even placing the order and all he could do was shake his head and mumble, ""Yeah..sorry."" I have worked in Customer Service for over 7 years and even though I understand their policy forbids them from typing in a credit card number without the physical card present, I know that he, as a manager, could have made a judgment call on that one. Especially since it was HIS employee's mistake. I will not be returning to this particular BJ's."
Christi S.,"San Francisco, CA",131,275,203,3.0,3/7/2014,"Nothing to rave about. Typical restaurant joint like all the other chains. I guess the best is that they have happy hour. But definitely ""call ahead"" is the way to go if you're trying to make reservations for parties less than 6."
Palomita a.,"San Francisco, CA",1,8,,1.0,5/9/2011,"In general, I love BJ's restaurants and have visited multiple locations throughout California.  Good food, comfortable atmosphere and friendly/attentive service.  This BJ's restaurant, however, has consistently been a disappointing experience for me.  During my most recent visit we waited over an hour to be seated (not unexpected on a busy Sunday evening and for a larger party of 6), but the service continued to disappoint from that point on.  Our server was no where to be found, and only appeared after we called the attention to the manager (who seemed to be the only person available).  The food served last night was average, no one followed up to check on us during our meal and the wait for the bill was also painfully slow. I would write off this poor experience to a particularly busy (maybe short staffed?) night, however the last time I visited with just my boyfriend the service was also very poor.  We returned tonight to give this particular location a second chance, but the next time I will definitely endure the 15 minute drive to the BJ's restaurant in San Mateo. I will most likely return to BJ's restaurant - but definitely never again to this location."
Michael B.,"Union City, CA",44,12,21,3.0,12/28/2013,"Although the food is satisfactory and the pizookies are excellent as always, the hostess lost our reservation and forced my party to wait an extra 30 min, despite us calling in an hour ahead of time. Not only this, she did not put in an effort to resolve the issue, and whisked us away as if some nuisance. Umm ok?"
Tiff T.,"San Bruno, CA",26,9,10,1.0,5/3/2014,"This place sucks so bad. Our server was slow. Didn't know our order. He was more confused than us. Our food took 40 minutes to come and when it did, our entree was not complete AT ALL. We told the server that it wasn't what we ordered and that the picture on the menu didn't match what we got. He was still really slow and had no clue what we were talking about. The calamari was cold and soggy. The food was cold as well. I just wanted to come in at 10:30pm for a late snack after a long day to relax and this happened, resulting in ruining my whole night. Never again will I come here. Educate your servers. And tell them to give better customer service."
Denis A.,"Berkeley, CA",73,170,792,3.0,6/9/2012,"My grandma loves the fish n chips here, so we come to dine everytime we visit. Usually they are able to accomodate our party of seven including two kids, a  4 yr old.and 18 month. Our last visit didn't turn out so great with a table. That being said the servers are all kind. The beers are extremely tasty too.The ribs were a huge disappointment and the calzone I had on my last visit was ok. I hope to try their deep dish pizza next, but I have yet to try a dish that is incredible. They do have a huge menu so I'm bound to connect with something."
Lindsey S.,"Danville, CA",2,20,3,1.0,6/20/2014,"Walked into this place and the hostesses were talking and cussing about the people who came in before me who asked to be seated in certain section. After we got sat, our waitress didn't come over for 13 minutes to ask for our drink orders. She apologized for the wait but she was complaining about another table being a pain for her. When she served my salad... There were missing ingredients. The balsamic glaze was missing from my balsamic salad....? Along with no silverware. My husband started eating with his hands because he was so hungry and it took a good 5 minutes for me to get a fork after I had already received my salad. Then our pizza came out.... It was dough. We sent it back and apologized for being ""that person"". The manager came and brought a cooked pizza for us and didn't even say a word. There was no apology for the kitchen or the staff. The waitresses are walking around with their shirts untucked and talking to each other about their tables at the computers when people were waiting for drink refills.  They gave us our check, finally... And then there were two pizzas on there...? We sent it back and waited 15 more minutes for them to process our check because the manager was the only one who could comp it off... But the manager, William, was busy. I would have at least figured they would comp off some of the meal or at least offer....? Considering they made is late to pick up someone from the airport because it took 20 more minutes to cook a new pizza the RIGHT way.  Needless to say.... It was a terrible experience and there was no organization. There were several tables unhappy about the service and we will not return. Worst BJS I have ever been to. My family Is in the restaurant business and the major problem with this location is the management. William, specifically, was a terrible manager."
Frances T.,"South San Francisco, CA",2,5,5,1.0,4/29/2014,"So it was my birthday with friends and our food was freshly served, like you can see the steam from the pizza and everything. But waiter forgot our spare plates, so we waited like 10 minutes for them, thinking that we would get clean, newly washed plates. NO WRONG. We were served forks with chunks of spare food on it, plates with ketchup and mustard on it, and napkins that had stains on it. Let me add, it was not a busy day. Service was slow and the pizza was way too oily almost as if they drenched it and made it soggy."
Eleanor L.,"Las Vegas, NV",499,105,43,3.0,8/6/2011,"I'm not a huge fan of the food.  It's decent and I like to go here to watch games.   My favorite item is the patty melt.  It's simple, plain and fills you up with warm goodness.   Salads here are monstrous.  At almost all restaurants, the largest margin of profit for an entree is a salad.  Let me tell you, you get your money's worth here.  They're so large I've stopped ordering them because you can't take home left over salads."
Cameron M.,"Auburn, AL",0,20,2,1.0,5/21/2015,I had the worst service experience of my life here. Our waitress announced halfway through our meal that she was going on break. I had to chase down the new waiter assigned to us to be served. The food was mediocre. The only thing that redeemed the experience at all was the pizookie I had. I would suggest trying that to-go or at another location.
Joice K.,"San Francisco, CA",21,43,110,5.0,8/9/2011,"Love the atmosphere, love the food! Chicken wings with ranch dip are our favorite. But I'll never order food that comes with rice anymore. Tried that twice with fish and chicken. They were good except the rice. It was too firm. So next time, I'll go with fries or others than rice. Another flatbread pizza and strawberry margarita would be good on my happy hour session :)"
Anna T.,"South San Francisco, CA",61,39,15,3.0,5/22/2012,"The food here is decent, I've never had an actual food complaint. However, I do come here at night after work (after 10pm) and the wait is pretty terrible. The food is okay, nothing amazing. Happy hour is awesome, but service and waiting to be seated is pretty bad. Especially if you are at the first come first serve bar area. They usually forget to give me a menu and then after we hunt down menus for ourselves, it takes another 20 minutes before they get our orders and then another 20 for the food to show up. If I knew of many other options for late night dining, I'd be elsewhere for sure. I am hungry at after work!"
Raquel B.,"South San Francisco, CA",1,6,,1.0,7/13/2015,From the I wish I was elsewhere and I'm gonna let everyone know that hostess to the can I take your check yet waitress I was reminded yet again why I barely go there..at least the food was decent this time....
