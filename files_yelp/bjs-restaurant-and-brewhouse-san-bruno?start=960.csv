Danielle Cheri R.,"San Leandro, CA",27,16,,2.0,6/20/2011,"Took my daddy here for an early Father's Day dinner (Friday night). There was no wait which was surprising to me, then again there was only two of us. Our waitress talked way too fast and seemed in a rush for everything, which my dad and I didn't really like. My dad's not old but he couldn't comprehend what she was saying because she was in too much of a hurry for whatever reason. Even I took a few more seconds than necessary to fully understand what she was asking or offering. Besides the few annoying times she was around, it was a good time with my dad. I've been to BJ's a handful of times and none of those times are too memorable. A few times I just come with a few homegirls to share a pizookie because this is the only place I know that sells them."
Rachel B.,"San Bruno, CA",86,86,2,3.0,7/13/2011,"The food is ok but the wait times are too much. Evertime I visit I am asked to wait at least 30 minutes even when there are empty tables! If it's the middle or the week or a sarurday evening there is ALWAYS  await, some days as long as 2 hours.  Their giant stuffed potatoes are relly good and are the Pizookie but for the price and wait times I think I would prefer go to Chili's."
Washington D.,"South Reno, Reno, NV",4,101,3,1.0,7/7/2014,"I have to say I HATE THIS place sooooooooooooo much. My friend took me here, I asked him not to but, he resisted against my better judgement and boy did the verdict come back and it read, horrible food. I just hate the teenagers who are there yelling and just smickering and being annoying while you eat your food, you havea circus around you. Was one of the worst meals I have ever eat, never again!"
Kelly L.,"Daly City, CA",0,12,4,5.0,7/7/2015,"My experience at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was a terrific one. I invited my family to a dinner here last Friday. My experience with the food and customer service was excellent. Our waiter, Leo, was very patient and friendly. He smiled all the time and for the most part, he made sure that all of our concerns were taken care of. For example, we were worried because the pasta did not come out after about 30 minutes, however our pizza was already out. He made sure that the pasta came out and got to us. I admired him a lot because he had to tolerate my aunt who complained about the salad and mostly everything, which I give him props to. The deep dish pizza (BBQ chicken) was tasty as usual and the pasta (ravioli) was also good. By the end of this experience, I was pretty full, but as usual, we had to order the pizookie. The pizookie the best part of the whole food experience. The wonderful warm feeling of that awesome buttery cookie was just so yummy and delicious that it made my taste buds explode (not literally). And the combination of a warm cookie freshly baked with some vanilla ice cream just created such an experience that words not describe. I would be glad to go back to this place. Hopefully at least once, you will get Leo as your server."
Jonathan B.,"San Francisco, CA",49,33,539,1.0,12/11/2011,"NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. The people are rude and unaccommodating. I wouldn't have given it a single star if I didn't have to. Tonight I came here with my family. We anticipated that it would be busy so we called ahead to leave our name on the wait list, specifically saying that we need space for a car seat, which at least over the phone, was ok with them. We get there, and they set us up in one of the elevated booths. We pointed out AGAIN that we had a car seat and they insisted that we could fit it in the booth. So we go to the booth, and sure enough, the car seat does not fit. We ask them if we could get another table so we could all sit, and the girl that sat us rudely said that we would wait again. I told her that we are not going to wait again, after waiting for an hour since the time we called for another table to open up. So reluctantly, they gave us another table, and things didnt get any better. The waitress we got was rude, and she didn't check on us. Before we left, we spoke with the manager on duty and told him that we are not coming back anymore because of the experience we had. At least he apologized, but it was too little too late."
Blair Z.,"Millbrae, CA",2,28,2,1.0,8/23/2013,"LEMME TELL YOU ABOUT MY NIGHT.  I'm sitting in the restaurant. Right now. And this service is BEYOND awful.  Our waiter decided to go on break in the middle of serving us, so his 3 back up guys, who've I've seen maybe twice in the hour and a half of me being here, have taken over.  I ordered a pasta dish that was supposed to be filled with spinach and artichokes in a cream sauce with grilled chicken. What do I get? Barely any pasta, maybe 3 spinach leaves and 2 big ass pieces of deep fried chicken, along with no cream sauce. Delish, right? Wrong. Absolutely disgusting. I could've made this meal at home instead of paying $15.  I've been here multiple times before and my only complaint has been that their food is basic and kind of flavorless. Tonight ruined it for me. Never EVER coming back."
Hank Z.,"San Francisco, CA",10,36,,1.0,4/12/2014,Typical meet place.  Cannot recommend it if you want to have an adult conversation.  Music too loud and it forces everyone to speak loudly.  Food is no different from any other chain eatery.  Had reservations for 6 pm finally got seated at 6:45!  We had a party of 5 and requested a booth in the outside mall area be cause it was quieter.  We were willing to wait a bit.  But as we were waiting for the staff to get our menus another staff person walked past our party and seated 2 people in a large both.  All they could do was say sorry and told us had to wait for another booth to open.  We ended sitting in the noisey area.  No attempt was made to make us feel as we were important.  Never going there again.  Just let the children have it.
Ashley L.,"Clayton, CA",1,7,,1.0,7/3/2014,Food wasn't great. They forgot to bring out one of our kids meals and we got it after all the rest of us were done eating. No drink refills the whole time we were there. Wasn't impressed.
Durty D.,"San Francisco, CA",3,41,20,5.0,10/13/2014,"I've been here several times cause it's so close to my current residence.  I've had the Shrimp Scampi, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and a few pizzas.  Do yourself a favor and ignore the calorie count for everything.  I have always had worthy service at this location.  On two occasions I had an older gentleman as a server when I was seated in the back and he was on point both times.  I once got a younger awkward kid who hadn't been a server very long, or so it seemed.  The large amount of TV's airing the 49ers game made up for it.  I also had a new server named Lisa recently who was the brightest and bubbliest person I've encountered in a while!  She was great not only as a server, but as a person to talk to while waiting for drinks and my meal.  Hope you get her as a server if you dine here soon.  Definitely a place to checkout if you want to watch different sporting events that are all airing at the same time (thanks to the massive amount of televisions)."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",113,11,48,2.0,3/18/2014,"Maybe I set my sights a little high for ""mall food"" but when I order a hot dip or French fries, I expect them to be hot, and when I send it back to be reheated, don't stir it and put it back in front of me just as cold. Beers were okay, and atmosphere and presentation reminded me of a slightly upscale houlihans. I'll skip it next time."
Jade D.,"Daly City, CA",42,104,81,3.0,3/7/2012,"I hate Waiting to get seated, of all the places BJ's is the worst. It's effin ridiculous. I came here with my friend, and as we were waiting, somehow we were the last ones STILL waiting. Supposedly, they ""buzzed"" our beeper, but I swear, that didn't work. I doubt they did, but they claimed too. They apologized, and after almost an hour, we finally got seated. FINALLY. Ordered half/half of their great white pizza, which is really dee-lish! (and another half of their Sweet Pig. That was just alright to me.) I love their chicken wings, with ranch sauce, bruschetta, and their alcoholic beverages are pretty good too, but I haven't had a drink in forever. Oreo pizookie is a must, when dining out here, otherwise you're missing out!  Our waiter was really nice, and did a great job serving us. Yay to that, Boo to getting seated! It's a good spot to come here with friends, or your kids since it's a loud environment. First date, don't think so. Look elsewhere."
Julie T.,"South San Francisco, CA",188,93,71,3.0,6/27/2011,"Drinks are pretty cheap. It's a decent place to chat and have a few drinks. I've never been a fan of their food, but LOVE pizookies of course. Anyway, the last time I came here with my cousin, there was a hair in our pizookie! EW EW EW EW! the server took it off our bill but we were turned off.  We also ordered fries but they didn't seem like they were fresh? Id give any BJS 5 stars easily for their pizookies but minus 2 stars for the lame fries and pizookie mishap. I'm a little scared to order food again, but if I do get the courage to forgive, then I'll review again."
Cupcake 1.,"San Francisco, CA",2,81,14,3.0,3/14/2014,"I absolutely love this restaurant, the only problem is that the staff sucks. They are literally a hot mess and do not know customer service. We went here a month ago and we have a 5 and a half month old, they made us wait an hour and a half!!!!! Their excuse was because the baby chair is a safety hazard!!!!! That's ridiculous I could of put her seat in the booth next to me! Anyways we spoke with the manager and he gave us our meals for free due to the inconvenience! Besides that, the food is great!"
Jessica M.,"San Francisco, CA",48,125,292,4.0,2/3/2014,"Saturday night around 7pm...Talk about lucky. People were standing out in the mall, spilling outside the doors and impatiently waiting in the front of the restaurant staring at the hostess'. I walked right in, scoped the bar with the high cocktail tables and waited like a buzzard for a couple I saw paying their bill. 4 minutes later I was sitting down..ahhh... Larissa was our waitress..and was very busy but being a former waitress and also previously working for a BJ's I gave it an extended amt of time from the required 2 minute greeting. Had something different than I normally would. Typically the apps and pizza's are the homerun but we saw a salad on the table next to ours and wanted to eat it, so we ordered our own. Except it came out completely bare. Just tomatoes, it was weird. I mean I just ordered it straight off the menu so I guess it was the expeditors fault for not looking at what they were grabbing off the line. So I was patient, it's very important to be patient! =) So it came back with a few more ingredients but still not as the menu has it being prepared. It was a bummer but after mentioning it to Larissa she quickly explained it to the manager who then quickly came to our table to express his apologies for the mix-up.  When we rc'vd the bill the salad was taken off. They didn't mention it, just did it. So that was nice and appreciated!! I didn't get a POOZKIE but have many other nights and shifts but ya gotta if you like warm cookies..it's simply sinful."
Dominic T.,"San Francisco, CA",499,344,375,5.0,1/24/2010,"I love this place for any dining occasion. Service and food are A-grade. The pizookie here is good enough for a trip here alone. Don't miss out on the root beer float either. I usually have to order it every time. Call me weird but I only order the grilled chicken pasta. The food tales a while to come out from the kitchen so if you're extremely hungry, order an appetizer. I recommend the brushetta. Sometimes the receipt will have an invitation to a satisfaction survey and in return you get some kind of a ""reward"" (i.e., free mozzarella sticks). I didn't realize that my grilled chicken pasta only takes a few minutes to prepare. I was the last to order as I arrived late to dinner and I got my food before the three other people at my table. I guess it's to my advantage. The servers are friendly, for the most part. I always have the impression that those who work up at front desk have an odd attitude, but maybe that's just me. I come here about once per month and everything is the same. I hope there will be more new menu items offered soon. I want to pop the pasta bubble and try the many other offerings."
Richard L.,"San Bruno, CA",14,12,,1.0,4/2/2014,"Some of the worst service we've ever had. We waited for someone to take our order for over 20 minutes before we had enough and walked out. Nobody even came by our table to order drinks, or at the bare minimum let us know they were running behind. Shoddy service = Two less patrons."
Nat W.,"Ashburn, VA",6,77,23,2.0,11/4/2011,"First of all, the food is ok, the portion is a small, perhaps it's the SF's way of telling the rest of Americans how fat we are..... whatever, I am here to eat and enjoy the food. Second, because my buddy ordered a cake and ice creme does not mean that we are going to share it.  If we are going to share it, bring another plate, not two spoons!  As I said, this place is really close to SF. Lastly, the service is slow."
Mariela D.,"San Francisco, CA",1763,759,2657,3.0,1/26/2011,"For a chain restaurant, BJ's is above average. I've been here several times and the food has been consistently good (some dishes are better than others), although a bit heavy and greasy. Their desserts are too sweet for my taste, and I don't even want to know how many calories they have! Their most famous dessert is the Pazookie, which is a giant, fresh-based cookie topped with ice cream. You should definitely check out their house beers - they do brew their own, after all. They offer a range - from the pale ales to the dark Tatonka Stout that'll have your head spinning with its high alcohol content. If you're not into beer, they have a full bar and an extensive list of specialty cocktails. The bar area (if you're fortunate enough to grab a seat) has several large screens so you can watch multiple games at once. If you're still not sure, try them for happy hour: Happy hour is Monday - Friday 3-7pm: $5 mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers, $3 beers, and $1 off cocktails And on Tuesdays, you can have a bottle of wine with your meal for half off The wait can get long on weekends since this place is located in a mall, so be prepared."
Raymond L.,"Daly City, CA",0,10,1,3.0,11/19/2013,"3 stars solely based on the fact that I love the best beginnings and always get it for happy hour. The avocado rolls are the highlight of the menu. Great white pizza is undoubtedly spectacular as well! Minus 2 stars because the service is whack. Service is slow and we don't usually get checked on when we need something and food comes out when we're sick of waiting and ready to leave. However, food is great. Need some work on the service."
Brian A.,"San Bruno, CA",136,220,,3.0,2/19/2012,"This place is growing on me.  I really like the beer, especially the tatonka stout.  In fact most of the beer here is good.  My second favorite is the brown ale. This seems to be my go to for when I'm in a ""I want to go out for a beer but don't want to drive too far"" mood.  Also can't hate too  much on a place with HH after 10 pm. Now the food is still of the hit or miss variety.  Every now and then I'll get surprised by a dish or an appetizer, but more often then not the food is mediocre.... especially the pizza... the pizza is always mediocre. If I was just giving a review for the brews, I'd give this place 4 stars.  Unfortunately the food drags it down to either 2 or 3 star level."
