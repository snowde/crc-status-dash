Alexis E.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,7,2.0,4/20/2015,"Tonight a friend and I decided to go to this BJ's to have dinner. I primarily visit BJ's when I am home in Southern California and love it so I decided to give this location a try. Big mistake. It was a little crowded which I expected for a Sunday evening so we had about a 20 minute wait time to be seated which was not bad. Everything from that point was downhill. We ordered an appetizer and each ordered a small pizza we waited for about 35 minutes when a manager came out and told us that the pizzas were all taking about 20 minutes longer than normal. So, we waited. Our server hardly came to check on us and when she did we felt very rushed to finish our food. She kept asking us about dessert before we were done eating our food. The Pepsi that we had was extremely flat. We finally ordered dessert, two pizookies. Those took about 30 more minutes to come out and after someone other than our server brought them out our server came and told us she was sorry that the pizookies were also taking longer than normal. Overall, the experience was horrible and I will not be going back to this location. I will stick to going to BJ's in Southern California."
Matthew D.,"Tempe, AZ",898,663,399,2.0,4/19/2009,"The food here is 4 stars.  I've had great meals here.  Why only two stars?  I've got a two word response for you: THE SERVICE (or rather the lack thereof) We arrived fairly near closing time and the restaurant was not all that busy.  The waitress, however, was really hard to find and not attentive to us at all.  My wife had the BBQ ribs and really enjoyed them, but when she asked for a wet wipe for her hands (a standard thing to give to someone eating ribs), the waitress said that they didn't have any.  When my wife asked for a wet napkin, the waitress came back five minutes later with a cloth napkin with one corner wet with cold water.  My wife's second margarita took 15 minutes to arrive, and where was the waitress through all this?  At empty tables, checking the levels of the salt and pepper shakers and not really checking in with customers.  Either that, or we couldn't find her at all.   After looking for her for 10 more minutes to get the check, my wife expressed to her how disappointed we were with the service.  The waitress responded with a story about how difficult her job is and about all of the things that she had to do.  To me, this was the last straw.  We won't be coming here for a while. BJ's BLOWS.  Check other reviews below.  I am not the only one to complain about BJ's service, and this does not appear to be isolated to the Tanforan location only.  Something is definitely wrong here and I would suggest that people avoid this place until the management gets it act together."
Michelle T.,"South San Francisco, CA",852,312,3891,1.0,2/7/2011,"Tried to give this restaurant so many chances.... The service is terrible. I had a group on 15 people and waited sooo long to place our order and for our food to arrive.  In addition, everyone got there food except for one person.  That person was waiting on a bowl of soup and a Caesar salad.  We didn't want to start eating until everyone got their order.  I do not plan on ever coming back to this location again. Nor would I recommend it. You can get better service in Foster City.."
John F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,1,1.0,11/16/2014,Was told the wait was 20minutes and it turned to an hr and others just walking in were being seated before us. I don't mind waiting but my 1 yr old can't. Not cool.
Kristine P.,"San Francisco, CA",3,39,16,3.0,5/29/2012,GREAT FOOD BUT LONG WAITS! Make sure to call ahead and get your name on waiting list to avoid long waits (avg 30-45 min wait during dinner and any time during weekends). Their pastas and deep pizza dishes are NOM NOM!! I also love Chicken A La Fresca (healthy dish). And Pazoookie for dessert!
Fannie S.,"San Francisco, CA",27,1813,108,2.0,5/3/2009,"I had the California Chicken Sandwich, which was very bland and boring.  Their home fries or whatever it was were huge and over-seasoned (read: salty).  It's just another chain with american diner food.  Burgers, salads, pasta, sandwiches.  Large portions, overly-salty.  Apparently they have beers and deep-dish pizzas too.  *shrugs*   Service was not fast, and barely friendly (or caring).  Our server forgot to refill the water glasses, brought us the bill without a jacket (everyone else got one!), and knocked over one of our water glasses.   Ambiance, very open, dim-lighting.  Go here if the rest of the mall is NOT open.  (I'd rather eat at TanForan's food court which has decent food, and no need to worry about service, as it is self serviced.)  Although, my date and I were greatly entertained by our neighbors and enjoyed the seclusion of our booth. ;-) *snickers*"
Anu P.,"Philadelphia, PA",477,345,182,3.0,6/15/2013,"A very typical BJ's experience: poor service, yummy appetizers and drinks.  Service: My friend and I got seated pretty quickly on a Friday evening around 5:45pm. However after being seated, our waitress didn't come for about 10 minutes. When she finally did, we ordered our drinks and appetizers all at once. After that, it took her another 10 minutes to bring us water! So much waiting just for water. Our drinks came out quickly after and so did our appetizers. Again, after we finished eating, our waitress basically disappeared because she didn't come to check in on us (I wanted red pepper flakes for my pizza) and she didn't come back until about 15 minutes after we finished eating. I kept seeing her serve the high stool tables, possibly because they were for bigger parties (thus bigger bills and tips, as suggested by other yelpers). She kept refilling drinks and coming back for things they needed, but it took me forever to flag her down to finally get our bill. This is not unusual though--BJ's typically has very poor service because there are always SO many people around and each server has to take care of one too many tables. However, since it was happy hour and Friday evening, I understand why the delays were a little longer.  Drinks: The slow service didn't take away from the amazing drinks and food though! I ordered the Arnold Stronger, which as basically an arnold palmer with simple syrup and Kettle One Vodka. It came out stronger than I expected but after squeezing in some lemon juice, it tasted amazing. Refreshing, flavorful, and something new. My friend ordered the pear cider which he enjoyed as well. It was a half cider half beer type drink so it wasn't too sweet but still tasted much better than plain beer!  Food: We ordered two appetizers: avocado egg rolls and goat cheese flatbread. The avocado egg rolls are a favorite of mine and never disappoint. They are rolls of thin bread fried with avocado, cream cheese, some sort of chipotle sauce, and tomatoes. They come with some sweet sauce, but you really don't need it. The avocado rolls hit the spot everytime and I couldn't resist from eating most of the plate while sipping on my drink. Perfection! The goat cheese flatbread was tasty as well. It was a thin bread with goat cheese, zucchinis, mushrooms, tomatoes, and light pesto. The slices were light and flavorful. Only thing i didn't enjoy was how much goat cheese was on some of the slices, but if you like goat cheese, you would love this flat bread! The pesto was also a good consistency because it wasn't runny and oily on the flatbread either.  Verdict: Despite service issues, I always love coming to BJ's because their drinks and appetizers never disappoint me! I want to come back for the stuffed mushrooms...already dreaming of them!"
Jean T.,"San Francisco, CA",96,137,189,4.0,1/22/2012,"I like this place. Its a great place when we want a casual lunch for my family and none of us can agree on where to go/want to eat. They have a great variety of foods. The quality is decent, lots of flavor. They are a kid friendly kind of restaurant but also a great spot to hang out with friends and watch the game on tv. Service is pretty good, even when they're are busy. But be careful, they dont take reservations so if the place is packed, be prepared to wait 1-2hrs on weekend."
Tamara N.,"Peoria, IL",115,125,11,3.0,5/1/2011,"This place is solid, but averagely solid. It's always crowded, the service is really slow, and there's usually a long wait for a table just because the food options as far as real restaurants go is fairly limited here. I do like the food.  The spinach and artichoke dip is sinfully creamy and delicious, it's my favorite.  I usually go for a personal deep dish pizza or the open faced chili cheese burger with shoestring fries, yum. I love their pizzookies!!!!  A freshly baked cookie still piping hot topped with ice cream.  One time the server mentioned you can split the cookie if you want, which blew my mindddd.  I will never have to debate over a chocolate chip one or an oatmeal one ever again.... I can get BOTH.  You have made my inner fat kid so very happy."
J B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,9,1,1.0,4/4/2014,"Went to BJs to watch the warriors tonight.. Super packed as always.  We ordered the regular BJs favorite pizza-- this was no favorite. The pizza was raw! Looked done so we eat a slice wondering -is this what it's supposed to taste like? Wasn't sure but no one was around to say anything so I continued eating. We let the waiter know who happily took it away. The pizza got comped but I'm left with a crazy stomach ache.  Wish I could take it all back!! Good waiter and management did what was right, but take this as a warning! Rush hour means rushed food !"
Gen M.,"Concord, CA",44,117,6,1.0,1/15/2012,"I didn't know this time would come [read on if you know what I'm talking about]. Two days ago my boyfriend and I wanted to eat out, so we decided to eat here. We ordered the MAC AND CHEESE and deep Dish pizza. I tried it before, but not anymore. After an hour of eatting here, I got sick. Thats right, food poisoning. Nausea,  vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, and fever. I got food poisoning from the MAC AND CHEESE I believe. My boyfriend didn't get sick, but me. I had to stay up till 2am to see if it was out of my system.  Luckly my boyfriend was so worried that he had to stay up and make sure I'm okay. I never had food poisoning before till now. I don't think I want to go to BJ's anymore. Sorry guys, but it was a bad experience. hope you understand. :("
Jerico P.,"Oakland, CA",758,420,422,3.0,10/31/2011,"you had me at Pizookie -in celebration of one of my student''s eight grade graduation (Kyrene) her wonderful mother (Tita Lulu) invited me to join them for dinner. BJ Restaurant @ Tanforan was where I fell in love with you... ...Pizookie... -just the thought of the brilliant creation is enough to keep me coming back. warm freshly baked cookie, soft and chewy with a crunch, melting heaps of cool ice cream on top... -a word to the wise. call ahead. the evenings get packed and more so on game days. although you can always get the buzzer when you check in and walk across the way to Barnes and Nobles to take a look and enjoy a book while you wait. until next time cheers"
Gill C.,"San Francisco, CA",359,379,1573,3.0,12/15/2008,"OK, I've been to BJ's many times (mainly on weekends), and service hasn't been stellar. Yah, I know it's a chain restaurant, etc., but I've enjoyed most of my dining experiences mainly because of the food (minestrone soup, caesar salad, sliders, spinach artichoke dip, and pizookie dessert).  I was surprised to hear there was a 30-40 minute wait on a Monday eve. What the hell!?! We took a chance and found a table at the bar (woo woo!) There were seasonal beers, and stoked that they had a pumpkin ale. Yummy! The pumpkin flavor wasn't overpowering and just perfect. They had several new items on the menu, and was happy to see they have a tomato bisque soup (a fav of mine), and of course, ordered the soup and salad combo. The soup was steamy hot and could see all the herby tomatoey goodness, and was not disappointed. 'Twas good to the last spoonful. Of course, you can't come to BJs and not order a pizookie!!! Ohhh, I love the warm choco chip cookie gooeyness and two heaping scoops of vanilla ice cream. So sinful, but who cares!  Service was superb, and was pleasantly surprised. Our server cleared the table and gave us menus within minutes of sitting down. Food arrived after a short wait (and trust me, I've waited for over 20-30 minutes for food, which at times was the wrong order). When our server went on his break, he stopped by to announce it and introduce his replacement, who was equally attentive to us. However, my friend and I were there long enough for our original server to return back.  I was happy to end my long day catching up with a dear ole' friend (my childhood BFF), and enjoying a quite pleasant dinner at BJ's."
Serena F.,"Daly City, CA",130,487,107,5.0,11/21/2011,love love their tomato bisque! I love BJ's. Their service is fantastic here and their manager (former and new one) are awesome. I love that they have the call ahead service which makes everything so much easier.  I would stay away from their pasta though except their Grilled Chicken one. All the rest are a bit dry and overcooked.
Rich A.,"Daly City, CA",102,3,,5.0,8/29/2013,Went to bjs and sat in the bar area and was helped by trish and mike and just want to say they both were very helpful and met my standards in terms of exceptional service. They always checked on me and always answered any question and need I requested. I will definitely be back when they are working. They are a shining light in a corporate business that strives on sales and not neccasarily service.
Rob H.,"Pacifica, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/3/2014,"I have only written one other review on here but this needed to be done. This will be  and last time I will go here. Took My wife here for lunch. Worst service and food. We sat down and I ordered the classic burger cooked med and my wife ordered the unlimited soup and salad. After a few mins my burger came out, waitress drops it on the table and left. No can I get you mustard or ketchup. anything?  Just walked away. Let us sitting there for another 20mins waiting for my wife's soup and salad. No other wait staff would stop for us when we tried to flag the employees down for help Finaly was able flag down the hostess and ask for her order. She said she would ask the manager. ( just want the food) finally after another 10mins out comes my wife's food. The different girl drops it on the table and asked if she wants anything else and stats to walk off as I ask for ketchup. It didn't end there. But now to the food, soup was cold, salad was warm, burger was well done ( order was for med) and bun was stale and hard. we didn't complain we just ate. Waitress never came back to ask for anything else, wife had to flag down another waitress to get a refill for her soup ( menu said unlimited!?!?) got attitude for that as well.  Waitress wouldn't get more salad for her , and we had to wait another 15 mins to get the bill. After we go it we waited 10 mins before we decided to just pay cash , since nobody would come and get out credit card.  Worst food and waste of time ever. Don't go here"
Mary Ann M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",209,279,30,4.0,3/22/2011,"Pros:  spinach artichoke dip, calamari, ahi poke, deep dish pizzas, and PIZOOKIE!   Cons:  Long wait for food, sometimes waiters are not too attentive and you have to flag one down to get a refill on your drink, the bathroom isn't always tidy. Despite the occasional customer service downfalls, this is a fun place to eat  with good food at decent prices.  I also like how they customize my food the way I like it (for example:  just the hamburger patty topped with grilled mushrooms, sliced tomatoes and pickles on the side)."
S B.,"San Francisco, CA",7,92,8,1.0,2/14/2014,Mediocre take on the classic brewhouse. Menu items are boring and tired. The place is in a mall and often busy but dont let that fool you. Its main competition to the captive audience is a mall food court.
Tim R.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,6,,4.0,5/28/2014,Took my my buddies here last weekend to watch the playoffs in the bar. The waitress was very quick to get to our table.  The beers did take a long time to get out.  The place is load but everyone is having a good time.  The pizza was great. will be back
Dan B.,"San Francisco, CA",4996,595,383,3.0,11/28/2008,"In my search to try things pumpkin flavored or inspired, I find myself here. Each month BJ's serves a specialty beer and this month it happens to be Pumpkin. What are the chances? It's a decent brew -- not too pumpkin-ie, good frothy head, and has a nice deep amber color. The thing is I just don't like the idea of combining the sweet comforts of pumpkin with the affects of alcohol -- flashback to the days of wine coolers.   So I had my one glass and went back to drinking my standard Porter. I know BJ's is a chain place but it does have its good points. The one I appreciate most is the late night happy hours: half price on some decent appetizers and personal pizzas as well as a dollar off their tasty brew. Their biggest down point has to be the service.  It is either super attentive or down right absent.  I've learned to pace the drinking of my brew since I never know when and if I'll be asked, "" do you want another?"""
